  Well, gyus and gals, we must start with something and it can be the RIP label as well as any other. I don't know what will happen with Peaceville after incorporating into Music For Nations, but one is for sure - there is no more famous their PO Box 17 (at least in the form as it existed for some years by now), so I'll give no address to them (or to HIM - only Guru Hammy remained as the full time employee) - sorry. Herewith their last releases as the independennt label. Some are good and cool, some aren't - that's life. All I feel now is RESPECT & RIP.

 PENTAGRAM "Day of Reckoning" CD (Peaceville Rec. Vile 40 CD)
 Oooh, the most "oldie" from Hammy & Co, it was originally released in 1987 by Napalm Rec. andbecame really collector's item, beeing almost not-to-be-bought now (as well as then, hehehe...).
Musically, Pentagram are playin' the rock of the 70-ies as Black Sabbath, Led Zep or The Doors (yeah, yeah, I really think this way!), namely melodic "rock'n'roll". It's sounding quite....old for nowadays, but, hell, this is really underground classics. Definitely, not for everyone, but for those into real underground at the most wide definition.
 Playing time- 34:33.
 Pentagram: Bobby Liebling/vox.; Victor Griffin/g.; Martin Swaney/b.; Joe Hasselvander/dr. .
 Day of Reckoning: Day of Reckoning; Evil Seed; Broken Vows; When The Screams Come;
Burning Saviour; Madman; Wartime.
 When I'm writing this,the third, brand new album of the Pentagram is out.Watch out for it! The review must be (probably) somewhere around too.

 BANISHED "Deliver Me Unto Pain" CD (Deaf Rec. DEAF 13CD)
 Don't know how to start... There will be probably alot CDs as this one reviewed here, but anyhow I must to do a review despite the fact I am feeling really uneasy to write bad things about the music.So... Banished released an album very much alike their official debut, "The Dead Shall Inherit" out May '92. If you haven't heard it- I'll name the shit- NY death metal.You must be probably be tired of it as much as I am.... For I am tired really fuckin' alot (can I say in english something like this?). I even had no caurage enough to listen the CD to the end. I simply saw no reason to do so.It seems I know every riff and turn of their music. BOREDOM!!!
 Running time-44:59 (too much, too long)
 Banished: Gari Shipani/b (now out of the band); Rick Breier/ dr.; Dave Graiglow/g.; Tom Frost/vox. .

Enter the Confines; Through Deviant Eyes.

 MORTA SKULD "As Humanity Fades" CD (Deaf Rec. DEAF 15 CD)
 The same situation as with Banished. The second CD and absolutely nothing new and fresh in it,
let alone the fact that I've heard all this before for the countless times.Death metal with the touch of doom... Predictable and boring. Not for me, but if you are 12-16 years old...it could be something. I myself got tired, tired, tired, bored, bored, bored, sleepy, sleepy, sleepy...
 Running time- 50:20 (too much, too long).
 Morta Skuld/ P.O. Box 37413/ Milwaukee, WI 53237/ USA (send SASE. Outside N.America send 2 IRCs)

Relics; The Sorrow Fields; Through Obscurity; In the Shadows.

 ISENGARD "Vinterskugge" CD (Deaf Rec. DEAF 16 CD)
 Perhaps all of ya do realize that Isengard is solo project of Fenriz of Darkthrone,so you do know what to expect here.Namely, "Unholy Black Metal". Hehehe...One of the most "underground" releases in this issue, Vinterskugge is, unfortunately ,one of the worst ones.I've heard no the shit like this since the first Burzum CD. It seems to me, all this black metal wave is near to it's end, if the releases like this will follow from the unquestionable leaders. Frankly, I'll be happy about this, for I see no sense in all this black mevement. Yeah, I am supposed to be tolerant, but my tolerance has boundaries too...
 SHIT!
 Running time-64:40 (too much, too long).
 Isengard: Fenriz/ must play all instruments (human-orchestra? Hehehehe, he isn't able even to sing properly!).
 Vinterskugge;...oh, my god, too many songs (16, in 3 parts) to mention them all. My fave is
instrumental "In the Halls and Chambers of Stardust the Crystalic Heavens Open".

 TEKTON MOTOR CORPORATION "Human Race Ignition" CD (Dreamtime Rec.)
 This CD was waited for a very long time and released in about a year after the recording, when Tekton Motor had the material for next two albums. But that isn't our business indeed... Dreamtime was then strong label and I don't know why this delay was caused.
 Speaking about the music (about we're supposed to speak), it's perhaps one of the best electro CDs reviewed over here. Strongly influenced by Formula - 1 championship, this duo out of Slovenia produces  sounds & noises which are just perfect for the Formula-1 broadcasting background (where, as far as I remember, I've heard this CD for the first time - Eurosport (sport TV network in Europe) report from the races). Pure electronical sound with very rare vocals and sometimes very raw, sometimes quite cosmic melodies makes this CD extraordinary one for those of you into  cold electronic sound.
 TMC: "Magirus" Branko MRT; Goran Majcen.
 Human Race Ignition: TEK 1; TEK 2; TEK 3 (which are divided into smaller components).
 Running time- 46:47.

 DARKTHRONE "Transilvanian Hunger" CD (Peaceville VILE 43CD)
 Nothing new over here. Just in the vein of their previous offer - "Under a Funeral Moon". Half of the lyrics are written by Greifi Grishnackh (who's he?) right from his camera. Only one song in English - all other in Norwegian. Pure unholy black metal. Nothing more. Boooring...
 Line-up as previously (everybody knows them...).
 Transilvanian Hunger: Transilvanian Hunger; Over  Fjell Og Gjennom Torner; Skald Av Satans Sol; Slottet I Det Fjerne; Graven Takeheimens Saler; I En Hall Med Flesk Og Mjød; As Flittermice as Satans Spys; En A I Dype Skogen.
 Running time - 39:06.

 AT THE GATES "Terminal Spirit Disease" CD (Peaceville VILE 47CD)
 The long - awaited third album of these Swedes, techno deathrash gods was released finally and everybody just waited as this: "Will if follow the debut, incredible one or their second one, The Burning Darkness?". That was the main question...And the answer is - no one! It's something new, not so intense as in "The Red in the Sky"... and not so... deathy as in "The Burning Darkness". It's still At the Gates with their typical style and playing, but something new although. If you know, what I am speaking about, of course.
 6 new songs, 3 old ones, taken from their previous releases and recorded live (hardly recognizable though).
 For those who own previous CDs... For those of you who don't - my sincere wish - you must start with "The Red in the Sky is Ours" CD. It still rules! No one later work of ATG can't beat their debut compact...
 ATG: Anders Björler/ g.; Tomas Lindberg/ vox.; Martin Larsson/g.; Jonas Björler/ b.; Adrian Erlandsson/ dr..
 "Terminal...": The Swarm; Terminal Spirit Disease; And the World Returned; Forever Blind; The Fevered Circle; The Beutiful Wound; All Life Ends (live); The Burning Darkness ( live ); Kingdom Gone ( live ).
 Running time- 34:53.
 
 MY DYING BRIDE "Turn Loose The Swans" CD (Peaceville VILE 39CD)
 I'm sure all of you have heard this MASTERPIECE. No other comments will follow...
 Playing time is 58:15
 "Turn Loose The Swans": Sear Me MCMXCIII; Your River; Songless Bird; The Snow in My Hand; The Crown of Sympathy; Turn Loose The Swans; Black God.

 MY DYING BRIDE "I Am The Bloody Earth" MCD (Peaceville VILE 44TCD)
 Just 3 songs over here. The first one, title song is like the nostalgic anthem for the times long gone, when the band was releasing their legendary demo and not less legendary 7". It's like old song with touch of their new abilities and stylictic development. Second one, in contrary, is perhaps something like pre - advice of their new sound and style. It's more into industrial edge! Frankly, I never thought MDB can do something  like this...Not very good song, but outstanding one... The third one is original mix of Crown of Symphathy, one of the best songs from their 2nd full lenght offer. Excellent one!
 Playing such music as MDB does not requires big musical skill, but their abilities to CREATE are enormous! Guys seem to be one of the most creative bands in my experience. RESPECT !
 "I Am...": I Am the Bloody Earth; Transcending (Into the Exquisite); Crown of  Symphathy (Remix) .
 Playing time is 26:26

 We've finished with  Peaceville CDs. One more time - respect & RIP !

 EXCRUCIATING PAIN "Thou Shall Choose" CD (Black Dragon Rec. BDCD 056)
 Frankly, I'm impressed. Being, objectively speaking, just another death band, Excruciating Pain managed somehow to earn my good opinion about them. I really don't know how. But the fact is that I like them much more than Banished or Morta Skuld (watch the previous reviews). Perhaps they are much more underground-sounding. The Peaceville death bands sound clear and not raw at all. And perhaps that's the problem about them. Excruciating Pain captured an underground spirit and managed to get a deal under a little label (Avanzada Metalica, in the America). Black Dragon, a label not very big too, took the European duties and that's why I am reviewing it for Black Dragon's Anne-Sophie was kind enough to send me it...
 Well, what I must say about the music is that it isn't very technical nor professional. But raw, extreme and played with alot of dedication. Shortly, that's how death metal must be performed.
If there could be added some extra technical skills, this could be a real masterpiece. Anyhow, quite good stuff !
 Running time- 34:54.

 F " I - III " CD ( Ei Enää Rec. EICD 1)
 Being one of the most weird, innovative and technical bands in nowadays underground, F (formerly known as Funcunt) are what I can call "unique" in this kind of music. After 2 demos, 1 split LP/MC on Warmaster Rec. (all of them rule!), these weirdos finally have something more serious  to offer. The CD is self-financed, but that doesn't mean worse. Perhaps you'll have a little more problems with buying the thing, but if you are into superb-
technical, unique and never-heard-before form of thrash, these problems are really minor factor. Just follow the instructions below. And now just read my super-short music description.
 Well, you know already what kind of music F play. For me it's like mixing together Mekong Delta, Angkor Wat (yes!) and the Residents. Sometimes like moody eskimo folk song with tundra's rhythms and arangements, sometimes like grind core in it's worst incarnation, music of F just can left one speechless for while. For this band just can't have neutral approach to what they're doing. And  they are doing really incredible stuff! I am amazed for the thousandth time! I followed their way from the demo times, they are very (VERY) good friends of mine ( how else it was possible for me to be featured in the thanx list? Thank you, Jussi! ) and I just wonder why they aren't releasing their, say 6th CD under the label which name only can be enough for them to live rest of the life just making MUSIC.
 Get this!!! AMAZING stuff! $ 13/14 (or any other convertible currency) to: Ei Enää/ 29570 Söörmarkku/ Finland.
 Running time-43:55 (quite good time for 3 songs...).
 F: Jussi Saivo; Jukka Sillanpaa; Marko Paltomaa.
 Sorry, I don't know the songtitles (if they exist...).

 MYSTIK "Perpetual Being" adv.tape (Massacre Rec. MASS CD 028)
 Being the second full-lenght offer from this American power metal team, it quite differs from it's precessor, "The Plot Sickens" (read about it in T.K.C. # 5). Just listen to the last cut, "To Be Continued"! Generally I personally am not into the music like this very much, but Mystik deserves my highest praises for the technique and talent! Mystik features ex-Sinister (not the Dutch one I think), Purgatory and Spudmonsters members and they really are full (even exploding) of fresh ideas and I highly recommend this CD for the lovers of the thing rock dinosaurs are keeping calling "rock'n'roll". I myself am very enthusiastic about it, though, as I pointed out above, I am not die-hard power metal fan in any case.It's not very heavy, not very aggressive, not for the death fans, but it is of a kind that only few metal bands of nowadays are able to play to. Praise the Mystik!
 Massacre Rec. / Tel.: + 49 7062 64707, Fax.: +49 7046 64375. It's in Germany.

 THE JUICEMEN "Meta Luna" adv.tape (Massacre Rec. MASS CD 029)
 Infact, I was completely misled by the leaflet accompaning this advance, which says: "Post-punk acid guitar rock from Boston". Hell, what is "post-punk"? If this means sleazy rock, The Juicemen are playing, than I probably know nothing about the music!
 Well, as I've stated above, these juicemen are not making juice, but the music so juicy that I really can't avoid not to choke  over their music. What a hell here! Not any metal at all, but raw guitar-oriented harsh rock. Sometimes it's more hard ,sometimes more light and moody, but hell, allways quite enjoyable, melodic and mostly very groovy. Good stuff definitely. As the infosheet writes: "Who find himself too intolerant for this album will miss the thing!". I can't but to agree...
 The Juicemen: George Faulkner/ vox.; Christopher Hackett/ g.; Mike May/ dr.; Michael Milazzo/g.; Vic Vicks/ b..
 Meta Luna: Before the Wheel; Nobody Told Her; Broken Tooth; Mission Bed; Sleep; Child's Fear; The Voyeur; Dim Buls Sway; Downtime; Tuesday Evening; Dandelion.

 CREMATORY "Just Dreaming" adv. tape (Massacre Rec. MASS CD 031)
 One of the better ones of reviewed here, this CD is perhaps too melodical for being called death metal, but the fact is that this is one of the most aggressive and intense one I've heard. Heavy as shit, with the full, rich (tobacco taste! Hahahaha!) keyboards, this sound is the one to be definitely experience. It is really quite impressive, mystic and charming. I can call it "femimine". This is quite true for the female is playing keyboards in Crematory. Sometimes one can get impression that keyboards are the main instrument here. Frankly, I'm impressed quite alot. Thing definitely to own!
 This is the second full lengh offer of the band. The first one, called "Transmigration" was not less good and charmic! Definitely a band to keep your ears/eyes upon!
 Crematory: Gerhard Stass/ vox (god!); Lothar Forst/ g.; Katrin Goger/ keyboards; Harald Heine/ b.; Markus Jullich/ dr..
 Just Dreaming: Heavens Throat; Transmigration; Only Once in a Lifetime; Shadows of Mine; I Saw the Angels Fly; In My Hands; Instructions; The Prophecy; Dreams; For Those Who Believe.

 SOUL CAGES "Soul Cages" adv.tape (Massacre Rec. MASS CD 032)
 Well, well, well, here we have perhaps one of the best power/heavy metal bands in this issue. With these 7 songs + intro Soul Cages managed to achieve the best results of Manilla Road or Helloween! Frankly, the Cages style is something in between of these two giants. Playing mostly super melodic ballads, Soul Cages manages to keep them in a "smooth" condition, not making them look like selling out. Sure not commercial stuff over here! You have my word for this!
 In the other hand, just think - what stuff you can call "commercial"? Frankly, I don't quite know. Here in Soul Cages you can hear a woman vocals from time to time ( a sure sign of commercialism?), extra melodic guitar's solos, moody are almost all songs... Commercial stuff, one can think... No, just look above what I think about their "commercialism"...
 90 points out of 100!
 Soul Cages: Thorsten Staroske/ vox., g.; Knut Nitsche/ g.; Stephan Tigges/ b., b.vox.; Jorg Nitschke/ dr.; Patricia Trautman & Beate Kuhbier/ b.vox..

 PESSIMUS "Prayer to Fire" demo
 "VILE VIRULEND VICIOUS DEATH METAL"-so was ensured by their flyers...He he, Lithuanian bands know  how to pump money out of foreign undergrounders! Yeah, this is Lithuanian stuff, for the first (but not last) time in this issue.
 Being very good friends of mine, Pessimus intends this review must be good one. He he, no way! But... perhaps the best way will be if I will tell the bad things speaking by phone, and here just good ones. So, the good things are:
 -Playing technique;
 -quality of the tape (24 trax recording+digital mastering);
 -price (5US$);
 -the guys themselves (hi, Ramai!);
 -the lyrics ( must be on the cover...My tape is without it..sorry...).
 Well, the style was mentioned above...One of the best Lithuanian death bands. If you haven't heard any, this is quite good oportunity! Don't miss it!
 $5 to: Ramunas Platukis/ Saltiniu 12-4/ 4580 Alytus/ Lithuania.
 Prayer to Fire: Intro; Prayer to Fire; Lonesome Face; Disturbed; Morituri, Pessimus Vos Salutat; Strange Journey.

 HUMAN "Things That Make You Go..." demo
 Well well well my dears...That's new true death metal should sound alike! The guys must have good sense of humour to raise the whole thing to the level where balancing between the true attitude and mocking begins. They are like Carcass in somewhat, keeping their lyrics and songtitles so gory and scary that I wonder about their true intentions-were they to make us smile while reading? He he...I suppose they were!
 Musically, the demo is that old, stupid and primitive death, which we know from such classics as Scream Bloody Gore or Severed Survival. Frankly, lately I am not into music like this (except for the classic stuff) , but Human captured the true spirit of that times and that's why I feel big sentiment about their music. Good stuff for all the deathheads!
 Human made quite big step forward since their last "Vomit Discreetly" (watch #1) demo and that shows. Not the best death demo in my collection, but one of the most sincere.
 $ 5/6 to: c/o Vaughn / P.O. Box 2120/ Christchurch 1/ New Zealand.

 Things That Make You Go: Crunchy Frog; Turning Green and Starting to Smell; Trapped in a Meat Locker; Sperm Fire; Foreskin Face; Wave Goodbye to Both Your Hands.

 MANO JUODOJI SESUO "Reinkarnacija" demo
 The band's name in English will be something like "The Black Sister of Mine". I call it "A White Brother of Yours". But that doesn't matter. Called "Lithuanian Sisters of Mercy", MJS isn't what one can be supposed to wait from the band called like this... The music is rather pop than gothic, but the band tries to keep their gothic image by all possible and impossible means. Music makes the corrections to the image though. Pop gothic could be compromise of how the music should be called. It's really VERY popsy, melodic and mainstreamic. Never thought Sisters of Mercy played like this. It's really odd enough for the band to call  themselves "gothic" and to play kind of music a la ...( here I start to look after international comparison, but can't find any.Only stupid Lithuanian pops. Fuck'em all!). Sorry, guys...
 Haha, you all are dissappointed? No need to be! Despite some recording faults, this is the best issued/published Lithuanian demo I have ever seen. Full color cover, band photo, lyrics (not actual for you-they are in Lithuanian), printed cassettes, etc...
 And the music isn't so bad as I've written above. It's not hard or heavy in any sence, but very good stuff anyway. Well done, guys!
 Mano Juodoji Sesuo/ c/o Saras/ P.O. Box 114/ 3005 Kaunas/ Lithuania. $6 / DEM 10. Well worth your money!
 MJS: Mindaugas Budnikas/ vox., g., keyboards; Dainius Starkus/ b., keyboards.

 SICK OF SOCIETY "Bitch" demo
 One of those numerous bands who, formed in 1989 achieved almost nothing since then. The third demo is like debut of average thrash core band, nothing really special or outstanding over here. Just plenty good but old ideas respected in the similar manner like thousands do adding
perhaps a little bit more personal feeling towards what they are doing. The musicanship is quite weak, the style unoriginal and the whole impression isn't as good as I would like to...
 The style , as I've pointed out before, is something like thrash core in a veins of such bands as new Sepultura ( I must be kiddin', guys! ) ,Invocator (a joke too...) or Intense Agonizing (no comments). Very rarely some acoustic or keyboardic stuff is added to make the whole impression more positive. But most of all I liked quotes of Beavis & Butt-head and vomiting in "Lost in Korea" (as described on the demo cover-Korea is a cocktail made of 1:1 Romeo Lambrusco and Coca Cola). That is cool!
 The tape for me (or to be more exact, to Saulius) was useful for one purpose-when we start Windows 3.1, the computer vomits like as if drunk for several days in a row.
 $6/ 10 DM to: Oliver Kast/ Römer str.26/ 89269 Vöhringen/ Germany.
 S.O.S.: Thomas Gerstmann/ g., vox.; Oliver Kast/ dr.; Thomas Hübler/ g., synths.; Jörg Keller/ g..
 The song list is too long-sorry.

 ANGELKILL "Garden of Crosses" demo
 Angelkill were formed just one year before the SOS (watch previous review), but how much more progress they've gained in the years passed! I like Garden more and more with the every listening I gave the tape. Well, they play death metal, to be exact something like mix of everything (trendful thing to do? Not really if all is done with such perfection as in Angelkills case). Not supremalistic one, but very enjoyfull and catchy, with lots a rhythm changes, vocals ranging from death like one to the something King Diamondish. Guitarwork is something quite flat, but the studio wasn't so exceptional one too (the quality suxxx, to be frank), so I wanna hope this is the studios fault. Generally, the demo is well worth your hard-earned  tyanga (means banknotes in Kirgisian).
 $6 everywhere to: c/o Blakk/ P.O. Box 371/ Le Claire, Ia 52753/ USA. Everything comes with color cover, etc... Angelkill have also split demo with Polish "Battery". Only $5 worldwide.

 THE MOBILE MOB FREAKSHOW "Horror Freakshow" adv. tape (Primitive Art Rec.)
 The music is something metallic, but not thrash, doom, let alone death...It's somewhere between NWOBHM and grind/death, but not power metal though. Everything is quite heavy and hard(esp. the drumming is!), but sometimes not enough to satisfy the die hardest fan of the extreme. Infact, I do not know what band can be close enough I can compare the styles. Mobile Freak Show have something of Slayer, Iron Maiden, Sepultura, Saxon or whatever- you name it. I myself am confused.
 But not so bad stuff at all!
 SEK 100( $7 ) to: Primitive Art rec., c/o Staner, tel.: +46 35 108 562 (that's in Sweden).

 SOULGRIND "La Matanza, El Hymno Pagano" promo tape (MMI Rec.)
 One ex- Tenebrae member, named Jussi, went slightly mad and created a band with sound sampler. The result is the band named Soulgrind. I reviewed their Santa Sangre EP in Thy Kingdom Come # 6, but nobody noticed them there. It's a real pity for the band is the one of most original ones in today's underground.
 I can't say anything about the music for my copy is SO BAD that sometimes dissappear whole instruments (drums in 2 songs, for example); but anyhow I'll try. It's death/doom/sympho (???)/ black metal played with sampler. Sometimes it's getting really catchy, but mostly it's quite dull. The vocals are super-unclear, gargling and low. All songs are very different, ranging from quite ones, slow and melodic to the death riff-based, heavy and quick  (played without any skill though). I don't know what the final my statement will be... If you're gonna to pay $ 17 for the originality, this CD is for you. If  originality isn't enough for ya, well, look for something other.
 Soulgrind/ Kytösuontie 8C 35/ 00300 Helsinki/ Finland.

 INTENSE AGONOZING/NECROBIOSIS Split EP (MMI Rec.)
 Intense Agonizing is only band of Hungary I know. The  rumours about it were wide spread in the underground , keeping telling us that IA is actually one of the best bands out of East  Europe. Well, well, well, not agree with opinion like this. Again, I own the very poor quality tape (your fault, Markus!) and can't speak about musicians with all responsibility, but the music itself is pure/poor death/grind. I'm not sixteen any longer to like the music like this. Anyway, I must say that IA are playing quite well and even I liked some parts of the program (disliking the whole though...Sorry...).
 Necrobiosis (they're from Finland) offers us the same death/grind, but much complete and ideally finished. What really impressed me in this band are the vocals (2 of them) and drums sound. And the whole thing is done in the best traditions of the genre. Killing stuff! Get this EP for the  B side alone! Well worth your bloody DM 10/ $6!
 Look above for the label details.
 Intense Agonizing: Gach Imre/ 1071 Budapest/ Damjanich u. 36/ II. Udvar, Fsz.1/ Hungary.
 Necrobiosis: Pasi Kuronen/ Viklakuja 11/ 23500 Uusikaupunki/ Finland.

 AVULSED "Carnivoracity" EP (MMI Rec.)
 Avulsed, the band more known more as side project of David Sanches Gonzales (he's also Dave Rotten), ex- Drowned Prod, now rumoured to have new label Repulse Rec.. (Hey, David, do you hear me? No answer from your new P.O. Box for the months!). And ,well, as the ex-man behind one of the most influencial death label in the underground, David could perform better music...Though I have no serious faults for the musicianship and Dave's vocals are simply godly, but I can't say I liked the recording quite alot. I'll probably never listen to it again...Well, it's HEAVY (too many bands are such), EARCRUSING(my ears were crushed long before...by too many of the bands) and generally ORDINARY one...
 Hehe, Markus&David must be angry on me because of such shitty review...Guys, everything is totally different! I must say,that the EP, along with Necrobiosis part of the split EP is the best of death/grind MMI releases so far... Must to get for all death freaks! Extra stuff!
 No line-up of Avulsed is known, sorry.
 Carnivoracity: Carnivoracity; Cradle of Bones; Demoniac Possession(Pentagram).

 GUT "Pussyfied" EP -promo tape (MMI Rec.)
 COOL intro. What follows later isn't worth to be released even as the demo tape - senseless supposed-to-be grind death with super unclear vocals, super predictive melodical path and wierd effects. I wouldn't take this EP even free-it'll take too much place compared to it's usefullness.
 Gut: c/o Oliver Roder/ Klingen str. 46/ 74235 Erlenbach/ Germany.
 Pussyfied: Intro; Woman in Decay; Grotesque deformities; Disgusting Corpse Dissection; Bizarre Reality of  Bestiality. 

 GWB Productions
 Steve Cattle, a man behind GWB sent me a tape with several it's releases on and I am forced (?) to review them all here in a very good way for the Steve must be not so bad guy afterall, but firstly, the few words on GWB itself.
 GWB Productions comprises of a label and a distro. The label is completely devoted to the UK underground scene and was formed with the intention of only releasing items by UK bands. The tape I've got represent all the label releases to the moment. Namely:
 WINTER OF TORMENT ("Immoral World " MLP (limited to 1000 on green vinyl)). WOT are definitely not so bad thrash band, speaking about general appearance, but...without that...something  that makes thrash so exceptional enjoyable for the kids like me. Perhaps the drums skill, they sound like kitchen gear. Hahahaha! Anyway , I don't wanna to buy this MLP...The trax featured on the tape are: Slowly Ticking Clock; Words of Ammunition; The Sacred Words.
 CERECLOTH (" Encrusted in an Oaken Legend" 7"EP (limited to 1000)). Oooooh, my God!!! Are words powerful enough to describe my feelings towards this EP?! I wonder...This is one of the best releases of the death genre in general... Guitar work alone is so outstanding that my hair are standing straight and I simply am astonished, shocked and completely bewitched. The sologuitarist sold his soul - this is more than clear. Shorter-incredible 7"- legendary one. I think once sold out - it'll become a collector's item with quite nice price.
 Two songs on the tape - Encrusted in an Oaken Legend; Beautiful Lying Faces.
 REPROBATE ("Le Carceri" 7"EP (Limited to 960)). This is quite different from Cereloth, the heavy drumming with ultra heavy riffs, Reprobate in my opinion can win quite good prize in the competition for the heaviest death outfit. Music is very clear though as if recorded in the best studio, not just pouring senseless heaviness to the poor listener's ears. And that acoustic pause in "Le Carceri" rules!!! Generally, head and shoulders above all that death underground crap. Stuff to enjoy, if you are tired of these childish death bands.
 Two songs on my tape- Le Carceri; Hammer Onto Anvil.
 THEODICY (" Succumb" 7" EP). I remember I did a review of one of Theodicy demos in one of the TKCs , but frankly I do not remember anything...Sorry, guys, but I must start from the zero in this case. Well, they play kinda death/doom with superb drumming these double bass parts are driving me crazy !) with female vocals in the background. Very good stuff as for the 7" and definitely recommendations for the DEAF Records! (2 previous bands were the way better though...) (If DEAF still exists in our unstabile times...).
 Two songs on the tape: Succumb to the Sucuba; Hollow.
 MALEDICTION ("Chronicles of Dissection" CD) Brainsless death metal for the brainless ones. Nothing more. Songs-System Fear; Framework of Contortion.
 INTERNAL BLEEDING ("Invocation of Evil" 7"EP (Ltd. to 1000 hand numbered copies)). Look to the #1 of my newsletter to clear out what this band is about. My position hasn't changed - a mix of Cannibal Corpse + Pyrexia. Brutal! Brainless...Gutted Human Sacrifice; Ruthless Inhumanity.

 Well, the plans of the label include: studio CD of Malediction in late '94, compilation CD of Reprobate (early '95) and debut CD of Theodicy (mid-late '95). The later 2 are quite interisting ones in my opinion...

 IN THE WOODS... "Isle of Men" demo
 Wanna some black metal? Ooooh,sorry, sorry, SORRY!!! Pagan metal, I wanted to say! So is called ordinary black stuff nowadays, if you didn't know this so far...
 By the way , I wonder if Norwegians are the ones who know Paganism first-hand. If you wasn't aware of this- a little information-the last country in Europe which accepted Christianity was Lithuania. Formally this was done in the end of thirteenth century, but Pagan rituals existed for the long centuries to come as well... Some say that even nowadays... But our story is not about this...
 Frankly, I have nothing to say more...I've got headache...

 RADICAL RETARD "Once I Woke Up" CD (selffinanced)
 This is HC CD. Very well done, a little commercial as for the HC, but very joyful and well performed, melodic and hard blasted. Quite Webitish band...Sorry, I am not very big pro, speaking about HC, so...I'll better end here not writing bigger nonsenses.
 Radical Retard are very concerned about the promotion of their product, so it's sent to every zine they can reach...Otherway ,the CD is to be bought for $13/15: Dave Robinson/ Sluishoofd 50/ 3961 KW Wijk Bij Duurstede/ Holland; + 31 3435 76515.

 FEAR MY SOLITUDE "Dancing with Solitariness" demo
 I really was astonished to read their flyers saying that "Dancing" is the 7th (yes, SEVENTH!) demo! "What a dedicated duo"-I thought, thinking that FMS are refusing all propositions from the labels trying to stay independent and underground. But, after the demo was sent to arteFACTed headquarters, all my waste illusions became nil. FMS has super long way to get signed-this is the opinion I got from the very first listening. The band is duet, so the additional members could improve the situation, but situation isn't quite good... Actually FMS play doom; quite mournful and melodic, but absolutely unskilled one. The whole impression is very depressing, meaning that the guys are quite talented ones. Musically, but unskilled speaking about how to play what they have composed. Shorter, quite raw material, but poor product. NEEDS WORK!
 The demo is in original, normal cassette with quite good sound quality. Cover-b&w, photocopied. No lyrics.

 DWS: Solitariness; The Fallen; When the Night Falls; Outside the Blessed; The Souls of the Innocents; I Dance in Darkness; Longing for the Days Forever Lost.

 SARCASTIC MURDER "Cerebral Apoplexy" demo
 Quite impressive death metal. Not very technical, but... Impressive...That's the best expression I can give them. Mixing some parts from their Austrian fellow bands (Disastrous Murmur, Pungent Stench) with some other bands achievements, SM creates death metal quite pleasant for an ears. Not very heavy, but with excellent drumming and guitarwork that fits to the whole impression just perfectly. I really do not know what bands the comparison could be done, but generally this isn't anything new in the genre, just one more European band. Quite ordinary, but not less enjoyable.
 The band have released one more demo couple of months ago, so everybody is encouraged to write and to check them out. It will cost you $ 6/10 DM to: Martin Edtmayr/ Güttifeld 11/ A-4070 Eferding/ Austria. Tel.: 07272/ 4286.

 LYGIAILYJA "Still Alive" demo
 The fourth Lithuanian band in this issue is completely different of the previous three. Infact, Lygiailyja (what could be translated as "It's constantly raining" or smth similar) are alternative band.  Alternative in the most common sense of this word. Their music is combination of guitar rock, rock'n'roll, hc, punk and...alternative. If some of ya know band called BIX ,this comparison can be the best. For those of you who don't know BIX (99%) I don't know what band give as the idea of what Lygiailyja play. Perhaps the "lightest" releases of We Bite can be used as a headlines. But with some exceptions. Shorter-get this if you enjoy MTV's 120 minutes.
 $6/10 DM to: Sarunas/ P.O. Box 114/ 3005 Kaunas/ Lithuania. Tape is released by Bomba Rec., so the quality and whole presentation are blameless.

 TRAVAIL "Travail" demo
 American thrash aoutfit that pretends to be one of the best thrash tapes reviewed here. Guys decided to add some death to the music and this appeared to be the vocals, typically deathish quite plainly too, but the solos are godly! Abit sharp, melodic, they bring some new meaning to the whole, making it not so "In Your Face" (which I generally do dislike). Songs aren't very long. so not boring at all, some similarity between them exists though, so the whole product becomes not so desirable after a couple of listenings. Guys, don't you think you need a little more diversity? Anyhow, to become the major act, guys must work more...

 THE WHORES OF BABYLON "Promotape 93/94"
 Just short description-strange and weird music. Somekind of gothic mixed with pop and oriental stuff. Very doomy, melodic and breathtaking music. Frankly, I don't quite understand why the flyers of  W.O.B. are circulating in death underground....it must be electronic on least. Or avantgardistic at least. For the side B of the tape, featuring 2 techno hip-hop mixes of the side A songs is really worth to be on MTV Top 20 somethere between 2Unlimited and Capella. Hey, I don't  try to say that W.O.B. are as untalented as 2 aforementioned bands, but the music, hell, is quite similar, to say the least.
 He, he, just kiddin'! Seriously, the tape was kinda shock for me...For you it must be too, if death metal not deafened your ears completely, buy the tape before the CD will be released (it is actually (I hope) out when you're reading this).

 THE EVASION OF STAKE " Strangest Fun and Similar Dreams" demo
 Infact, the tape was released in January 1992, so it's really quite old, don't you think so? But it was sent to my attention I am very pleased to pass my attention to you in this case. The tape includes definitely 2 hits of dark electro pop, namely Prayers and The Last Day (both are on B side). Side A is more experimental, with some really weird effects and musical solutions. Well, I've wrote this and became not actually sure of this... The side is as experimental as B one, but ...with more effects-that's true.
 Speaking about the music itself-it's dark electropop (as I mentioned above) with gargling vocals and computerized rhythm machine and quite danceable (?) melodies. Fave trax- Tha Last Day & Blue and Away, everything is in C-30 cassette. DM6+ pp to: Beton Tapes/ Alexander Pohle/ Luruper Haupstr. 59/ 22547 Hamburg/ Germany; Tel.: 040 8323592.
 "Strangest...": Blue and Away; Death is Coming to my House; My Little Girl; Prayers;The Last Day.
 No line-up is known, sorry.

 A PARADISE FOR FOOLS Comp. tape (Betontapes BT 82)
 The same tape label has released this compilation of 10 German and one Greek band into electric side of the music. Infact I have not much to say about it, actually. Some bands are quite good, some are really shitty. I think it's common thing for all compilations. Frankly, most of the bands are of the later kind in this case.
 My favourite is undoubtely "Black Magic" by Greed For Life. And the worst band is undoubtely Die Tödliche Doris.
 In the other hand, the tape represents quite big spectre of German electro underground and anybody interested must check it out...But this isn't for me.
 Sound quality is quite good, cover-photocopied B&W. 
 Address is above.

 PRKLZ "Demo 93"
 A concept demo which has just one song title (in 7 chapters though). Infact, quite interesting and odd thing. The music is mix of progressive/power rock with some acoustic (unplugged) even folk tunes. The result is very interesting, something like Jethro Tull without the flute. I liked the demo but I rather wouldn't recommend it for some of you into heavy stuff. You must be at least a little bit openminded to accept this. Or ,in the contrary, quite mainstreamish one...
 The band also sent me some printed matter, but all is in German...Sorry, I don't understand a fuck...
 Cassette has 2 color cover, no lyrics, no photo, quite good sound on chrome tape...

 ACACIA "Funerals of State" demo
 Melodic powermetal with the musical approach à la early Viper, with quite high and balladish vocals reminding sometimes the bands like Helloween or the same Viper. Songs are very melodic and the vocals needs to be at least a little bit tighter. The stuff includes piano and keyboards what gives the necessary atmosphere, but... The music lacks of that something which makes it enjoyable.

 ALTAR "Youth Against Christ" CD-promo (Displeased Rec.)
 Infact, this band surprised me. I own everything they recorded in the past, namely the debut demo and one song in the past, namely the debut demo and one song in DSFA # 5 promo CD. And I got astonished what progress the band made since these times! Quite Deicidish death became much more mature and much more innovative though still without any compromises, in-your-face sound and general attitude. A must for all death freax.

 CELESTIAL SEASON/ LORDS OF THE STONE split 7" (Displeased Rec.)
 One of the best Dutch if not worlds doom/death bands joined their forces to publish one of the best 7" in this issue. A must!!!
 $ 5/6 to displeased Rec.

 BLESSED SICKNESS "Massacre The Holy" MC (PS Rec.)
 One of those "true" death bands who seems not to loose their attitude over the years passed by. But the metal performed by the band is quite good one, with some really aggressive, raw riffs, 2 vocals (one typycal in the vein of Mr. Tardy, other more blacky/sonorous) and really HEAVY sound. Infact, this could be one of the best death metal tapes I own, if the music itself wasn't so traditional. Psychodelic trip out of Ohio-for those with iron heads.
 $ 7/8 to: P.S. Records/ c/o Sean Pnek/ P.O. Box 22/ Belle Vernon, PA 15012/ USA.

 THEATRE OF TRAGEDY "Demo 1994"
 If there will exist  something like "arteFACTed demo of the year", this tape would be among the ones with very serious "pretensions" to win this award. The demo is really something exceptional with it's atmosphere, dark mood and INCREDIBLE feeling of the music performed. It's kinda doomy death woth unforgetable melodies, woman's vocals, deep lyrics, godly sound and superb packaging. Theatre of Tragedy are about to release their debut CD soon, so all of you must be about to buy it.. And I am proud to own this tape, it will be  kept among my best demos, between Anathema & My Dying Bride.

 TRAGEDY DIVINE "Apostles of Deceit" demo
 One of not so many power metal representatives of this issue. And that's their first tape under such monicker (infact they released demo 1992 as the "Variety of Arts"). Quite technical and melodic stuff with high pitched vocals, definitely one of those I will keep for the years to come...I enjoyed it very much, even despite my death/thrash past when I can't stand a music like this. definitely one of the better tapes coming out from Germany in this issue.

  ESOTERIC EMOTIONS "The Death of Ignorance" demo
 "Hateful, Drug-influenced, Tortured Doom"-as they describe their music brings me comparison with Winter, but Esoteric's doom is more...now to say...unclear. The vocals are SUPER unclear, as in the worst death band's case and despite 24 channel recording this fault is what keep me from writing the good review. One more thing is what differs Esoteric from Winter is their solos- Esoteric actually is sloing sometimes (quite rarely though) and not so badly... Otheraspects are quite similar and I rather will keep myself away from recommending the demo for your kind attention.
 But...if you insist...£ 3/2 and S.A.E.-to: Esoteric/19 Fairmead Rise/ Kings Norton/ Birmingham B38 8BS/ England.

 ANGELS IN EXILE "Demo-1992"
 It's perhaps the oldest tape in this issue, but, hell, not the worst one! I am not the big preacher of deaththrash, but what I've heard here was much much more of what I expected! Very technical & professional stuff with lots a drive and catchyness, piano here and there and much much of feeling and dedication. I simply love this band- as for 1992 they made very enjoyable demo.
 As far as I know, there is something new released right now, so keep your drunken eyes open!
 Chrome, high quality tape, b/w cover with band photo, no lyrics for $ 6 to: Angels in Exile/ P.O.Box 3712/ Albuquerque, NM 87190-3712/ USA; Phones: (505) 881-8479/ 299-0361/ 291-8056.

 Demo-92: Eyes to the Sky; Time for a Killing; I've Seen the Destruction; Metal Antics.

 KR' UPPT "Within the Asylum" CD (Rat-Face Rec.)
 As far as I know, the self financed CD which is rather hopelessly traditional and rather heard before too much times before. It's typical thrash affair, not very fast, not very aggressive, not very pleasant to listen to. BUT... it is not so bad all! The band is playing the music right from their hearts and, hell, they know how to do this in the right way! They hope to earn for living by playing. I personally think these hopes are rather overestimated, but who knows...
 Basically, the songs are rather lenghty, but not boring at all, vocals aren't deep, just perfect for the music, guitarwise the music is catchy with some "drive" in it having quite alot riffs and rhythm - changes to keep it from becoming very boring.
 Shorter-well done, but too traditional...Sorry...

 NETWORK "Perihellion" CD ( Hall of Sermon Rec.)
 Hey, that's totally different of what I've reviewed in past - EVER! For I see nothing in network's music except of pop rock!!! Perhaps abit electronised, but still in the veins of such bands as OMD, Pet Shop Boys (not so melodic though), etc, etc, etc...I just imagined how one can dance under Network's music...and know what I've decided - that I can't think about nothing except of Jimmy's Somerville homosecsualic ass - dance. Sorry for such comparison...
 I'll probably put this next Christmas, when my wife will host half a dozen of her fellow housewives.

 BLOCK HEAD "Trial of Tears" CD (House of Sermon Rec.)
 Quite hard electronic, but still very melodic and one of the best kind of this kind CD's I own. Band manages to balanse between pop - electro and industrial. But the material is very varied in this case. Sometimes even 2 songs, one after another, are very very different. For example Trial of Tears, which is quite emotional song is followed by very harsh and industrial Guilt... Contrasts are quite sharp indeed.
 Instrumentalicwise, there is no one "live" instrument used - just electronic programmable stuff and 2 vocals: male & female, both of them fitting perfectly to the music. Male's being abit sharp but generally very masculine, female's - in contrary - very feminine and enjoinable. Neat stuff!

 LACRIMOSA "Satura" CD (Hall of Sermon Rec.)
 This is the forth CD of these Swiss goths is definitely one of the best reviewed here. Frankly, Lacrimosa was the first my experience with gothic music (yes yes,...) but I think about it as about one of the most famous my experiences of this year. Lacrimosa are undoubtely one of the best classical gothic bands of all times and nations, despite you may like Sisters of Mercy or Dead Can Dance ( are they goths? - don't know...).
 Starting from the first impression- the cover is quite dark, black & white and GOTHIC itself.. Featuring woman's act in the deep panorama of the cathedral, above the alley of candles... Then comes the music... Depressing, doomy and, hell, gothic in the best meaning of this word. Perhaps only 2 cuts: Erinnering and Versuchung are less dreamy here - the rest is worth to be among the best "evergreens" of your mighty servant, editor-in-chief. One of the best CDs in the issue - doubtlessly.
 Lacrimosa: Sebastian Hausmann/ g.. b.; Philippe Alioth/ programming; Sabina Rehmann/ violine; Tilo Wolff/ vox..

 LACRIMOSA "Einsamkeit" CD (Hall of Sermon Rec.)
 This CD is infact earlier than above one - Satura, but I received it as the second, w e e k s after reviewing Satura, so I'll just let the things remain as this, OK?
 No gothic - metal cuts here as in Satura, but more some joyful marches... Generally, the music is more gothic, but less mature and, actually, magic... Tilo Wolff is making experiments with his voice... Sometimes even I think that it will be better not to use vocals at all... Tilo is supreme vocalist though and I didn't want to say that his vocals suxxx... I wanted to say what I have said only - that the music alone sometimes could be much more enjoyable... Anyway, I recommend this one as well as above CD. Good work, guys & gal!

 V / A "Fuck You, We're From Denmark Vol. 3" CD (Progress Records)
 The third CD of this set and one of the best so far. The best musically, but this music isn't quite in time. I got sick, sick, sick of these death metal demo - bands, all alike and fucking booooring too much time ago I could even think about enjoying this CD. However, some of the 15 bands presented here are worth to get a deal in a small company 'a la PS Records, etc... I'm speaking basically about Catharsis, Saturnus, Autumn Leaves & Coitus Interruptus. All others aren't even better than "to get laid in the whore - house" (so it's mentioned in the introduction to the CD). Sorry, if I forgot to mention few better bands here...

 WEJDAS " ........" ( "I tamsa" - it's written in runes, which we don't have in PC) demo #1
 Infact demo is for those loosers who're saying they're playing pagan music, but although it's only new name for the trendy death - black metal. Look, listen and beware, assholes, WHAT TRUE PAGAN music is alike!!! Look at you and look at this, suckers! Wejdas, the true pagan band from the last pagan land... Definitely a must, if you're tired of these clowns with painted skulls pretending to be a pagans.

 ALIEN SEX FIEND "Drive My Rocket" CD (Cleopatra Rec. CLEO 94122)
 This is the Collection's Part One. ASF's selected trax from the albums 1983-1992. Some of  them mixed specially for this compilation. Infact, I don't liked this CD.... I don't know why, perhaps it's because I was ripped off for the next time by this CD - it was stated in printed material that it's gothic rock... Hell, no way!!! It's rather electro pop industrial, but not gothic in any case, definitely not a music for me. You must be at least a little but crazy to listen to this. The very looking of the 2 musicians is something like Alice Cooper meets Darkthrone. Shorter -can't say anything good about this CD.
 I must be crazy writing such things about ASF...They're legendary band and I did quite a blasphemy with above. 
 Suspected line-up: Nik & Mrs. Fiend.
 "Drive My Rocket": Nightmare Zone; Drive My Rocket; Hurricane Fighter Plane; Isolation; Stressed out (brain drain mix); Back to the Egg; Now I'm Feeling Zombified; Get Into It; Attack; Crazier Still; I Walk the Line; Deprevity Lane; Sample My Sausage.

 BIG ELECTRIC CAT "Dreams of a Mad King" CD (Cleopatra Rec. CLEO 945-2)
 And the next case when "gothic" band has nothing in common with the whole goth concept... I personally saw nothic really dark in their music. It's something energetic, guitar based rock, in between, but, hell, never really DARK. I think it's because of the drum machine, called kindly Dr. Ruth (after the famous sex psychologist). It's rhythm is no more, no less but JOYFULL! I simply couldn't imagine until now gothic band with disco/ hip hop rhythm. Now we have the one (one? I doubt...).
 Anyway, this Australian band produced the music which is not so easy to listen and understand fully. It's popsy from the first listening only. Further ones reveale the hidden things not to be sensed while the first listening...
 Far from the being proclaimed the best CD of the issue, but even farther from being the worst...

 CHILDREN ON STUN "Tourniquets of Loves Desire" CD (Cleopatra Rec. CLEO 7208-2)
 And again the story is the same- proclaimed to be gothic, the band in my opinion has nothing in common with it... The first cuts (and the few next) are even...rock' n' rollish! But that's temporary illusion-the further trax are melodic (with very melodic solo guitars what makes really unique atmosphere) and more melancholic (but, still not gothic!) what makes them more valuable in my eyes than stupid rock' n' rolling. Anyway, it's something "wrong" with this music. Sometimes I get impression that the vocals are absolutely unnessary over here. The melodic solo guitar and driving rhythm section creates atmosphere where one more "brick in the wall"- vocals sounding in their own manner, no matter what musicians play, is simply destructive. If the band could fix that, I see no problem for them to be on MTV Top 20. Just joking, but who knows...
 Not the worst CD, but far to be the best...

 V/A "Trance in Your Mind- The Untoppable Trance Machine" CD (Cleopatra Rec. CLEO 9414-2)
 Very different from previous Cleopatra releases, Transe in Your Mind represented pure electronic music, I can even call it, hard (not meaning heavy or industrial) electronic. Infact, I am not familar with anyone of the bands presented in this compilattion, but for me all of them are very much alike. Not spacey, dreamy and melancholic as I like quite alot, but more into sharp side of the things, when the main aim is to make the ears bleed... I think it's the main reason I listened to this CD just once, and I have big doubts about will I ever di listen to it again. Stay away from this unless you're not TRUE MANIAC of hard electro...

 LIVING SACRIFICE "Inhabit" CD (Rex Music Rex 46004-2)
 SICK, SICK, SICK- THAT'S HOW I'M FEELING !!! Helpless death metal, outdated long before the album got released. Even the name "christian" death metal doesn't improve the situation even abit. Even the excellent thechnics of the players (esp. the drummer is good...) doesn't improve the situation even abit. For  die-hard fans only. If the idea behind the music is christianity- for the priests and pope also... But not for me.

 BURZUM "Hvis Lyset Tar Oss" CD (Misanthropy Rec.)
 As you probably know, Mr. Grev Grishnackh continues composing even in the jail, and here goes the fourth effort of  his solo project. Speaking frankly, much better than the previous CDs,
incorporating quite alot keyboards, melodic instrumentals (the last song, Tomhet, is actually nothing except keyboardic spacey experience, fitting more to some electronic bands than to black metal frontliners) and, actually, harsh vocals and unskilled guitars.- the later is usual black stuff.
 Some trax really good... If the majority of black stuff will be like this one, I may change my opinion about black stuff cardinally.
 "Hvis Lyset Tar Oss": Det Som En Gang Var; Hvis Lyset Tarr Oss; Inn I Slottet Fra Droemmen; Tomhet.

 PANDORA"S LUNCHBOX "Moody Yam" demo
 Frankly, I am abit confused. I do not know how to describe the music these motherfuckers are playin'. It could be named thrash/ grunge/ rock as well as punl/ hardcore/ accoustic/ metal. But the best way to describe the demo is just to say it contains music of Pandora's Box- one must hear it to make the conclusions himself- I simple refuse to do this.
 The tape is to be bought for the standart $ 5/6 from: Kenyata Sullivan/ P.O. Box 2071/ Wilmington, NC 28402-2071/ USA.

 GODSEND "As the Shadows Fall" CD (Holy Rec. HOLY 03)
 One man doom project, described by the label as "Gothic Depressive Doom" isn't as impressive as other Holy releases, infact, one of the worst ones released by it , but still quite fine and, hell, have I said that Holy Records have EVER released bad CD? No way! Perhaps the mixing is suffering from overtuning of high frequences/ trebles (and suffering ALOT!), but despite this songs are well built with remerkable melodies and good structures. Intrumentionwise though, nothing exceptional here. I really don't knoe how to describe my feelings towards this CD, because session musicians ( Dan Swanö/ vox and Benny Larsson/ dr. (both from Edge of Sanity)) did the best work here. The Godsend itself, incarnated in one man-Gunder Audun Dragsten/ g., b.. -is something not even well heard while listening... Shorter- not the best CD in my collection, but if you're die hard fan... Well, go ahead and buy!

 ASPHYX "Asphyx" MC (century Media 7763-4)
 Must I write here how do play these extreme death/ doomers? I suggest most of you know this better than I do... The same style, but this exactly is the worst thing here. I can understand and even honour the band which is keeping it's roots, but when the evolution as nihil... Well, it's obviously fucking bad...
 If you have previous releases, you must not bother with buying one more; if you haven't well, it's good chance to buy one of them to check Asphyx out.

 SAMAEL "Ceremony of Opposites" MC (Century Media 7764-4)
 The third offer of these premier Swiss blacksters (why blacksters I wonder- they play traditional death/ doom...) is something different from what they have done in the past ( 2 CDs and the first, underground EP- "Medieval Prophecy"). Band was joined by keyboardist/ smplist Rodolphe who brought some really cool ideas to the whole image of the band, adding some atmosphere to the previously quite plain ( and VERY enjoyable!) musical concept of Samael. This CD is something in - between of 2 previous CDs (Worship Him & Blood Ritual) and bands like Crematory (G) and Nightfall, if you know what I'm speaking about... Shortly, not so bad at all...
 Samael: Vorpalack/ vox., g.; Masmisein/ b.; Xytras/ dr.; Rodolphe/ keyboard, samples.
 "Ceremony...": Black trip; Celebration of the Fourth; Son of Earth; 'Til We Meet Again...; Mask of the Red Death; Baphomet's Throne; Flagellation; Crown; To Our Marturs; Ceremony of Opposites.

 GRAVE "Soulless" CD (Century Media 7770-2)
 Really one of the better death metal releases reviewed here! Grave are over the period when they were just another Swedish clone; now I can put them along with the legendary death musicians of Death, Obituary, Benediction and Morbid Angel. With this release Grave entered the elite of the genre. Good luck among the stars!
 Combining really extremely heavy death metal approach with some innovative ideas the band are driving audience just nuts; I dream about to see them live in action... The show must be something exceptional! If anyone of you have seen their European tour with Samael & Massacre, can you please let me know your expresions?
 If you are looking for good, technical death metal- this CD is definitely to own!

 MAYHEM "De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas" CD (Century BLACK 7767-2)
 And here comes the best black CD, but not only reviewed in this issue, but the best I have listened to EVER! Hell, but this does not than it's good- some of you do know my attitude towards black metal and the whole around it. But what I've heard here, in this LEGENDARY CD of the LEGENDARY band, just ripped my soul appart! The first listening to it brings nothing, only pure black metal noise. But starting from the second time, the things are slowly changing, and when one listens to the masterpiece for the, say, tenth time he can only think about it as masterpiece.
 You'll find Euronymous still alive here, executioning his guitar Hellhammer drumming and despite the original (?) bass player Count Grishnackh (whose bass trax were deleted- such was the will of Euronymous parents), bassing, the Hungarian Tormentos frontman Atilla Csihar vocalising. Isn't this trio alone worthful to check out? Hell, it is!!! Besides, this is the first and the last CD by Mayhem and not to own it can only complete stupid one...
 Mysteriis...: Funeral Fog; Freezing Moon; Cursed in Eternity: Pagan Fears; Life Eternal; From the Dark Past; Buried by Time and Dust; De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas.

 ENCHANMENT "Dance the Marble Naked" CD ( Century Media 77066-2)
 The first thing I've heard about this CD was a little story in Peaceville's (RIP) newsletter that Hammy, despite Century Media's media information, haven't produced it. Well, at last I own the CD and the media info, where I can read the actually he did...
 But, actually, if even he didn't, he can not be afraid someone will blame him for this! The CD is eventually excellent and powerful example of how must death/ doom played! Go out buy it!!!

 ZERO DEFECTS  "Into Your Lunatic Brain" demo
 Again electroact. Undergroundish this time. But I've heard rumours Zero Defects got signed by Zoth Ommog, so... look out for their official debut release. But I haven't it in my collection so far, so let's speak about their latest demo offer...
 As you probably understand, I am not very big specialist speaking about electroscene, so I can't manipulate with names, albums, etc, comparing them to reviewing release to make you more enlighted what kind of music are they playin'.
 So here I say it can be the mix of Depeche Mode with J.M. Jarre. Music is very danceable, vocals are very similar to Depeche Mode's, the whole is rather pleasant thing. Have no doubt the CD can be bought in tens of thousands.
 Well, no info where to get this; I got it from Jan Winterfeld (look the next review) free.
 Into Your Lunatic Brain: Hostages; Duracell; Firefly; L. S. E.; Planet Alert!; Overdose the Rapy; Braindead; Clean Slate; Clone Breeder; Transforme/ You.

 ELECTROPE Vol.1 "Never Judge A Tape By H's Cover" comp. MC

 EZOTERIC "Epistemological Despondency" DCD (Aesthetic Death ADCD 001)
 Ezoteric again. Though I've written that I do NOT want their CD here it is and I must review it... But, must I? I think if you'll read their demo review, all will be clear. Again 89 minutes of "hateful, drug-influenced tortured doom". You know , I agree with every single word of this self-description. If you want to know how tortured ones are "singing" doomy operas (one beat in 3 seconds), this is for you. For me too little is happening over here. I'm getting bored.... Sorry...
 $ 18/ 20 (Europe/ ROW)/ £ 10 (UK) for the double CD is fairly pricet hough. Pass them to: Aestetic Death Rec./ c/o Stu/ Silwood/ Pershore Rd./ Eckington/ Worc. WR 10 3AP/ England or to the band itself (look previous reviews for address).
 Epistemological Despondency: Bereft (20:29); Only Hate (Berserk) (2:47); The Noise of Depression (18:59); Lamented Despondency (20:29); Eradification (of Thorns) (7:19); Awaiting My Death (26:20).

 STRAPPADO "Not Dead Yet" demo
 Infact, I do not know what's the point to review the tape which will be reviewed below. It's perhaps the most legendary one here, of the most legendary band AND NOT AVAILABLE ANY- MORE! Infact nothing heartbreaking over here, but the only thought that the whole thing is played by one of the forerunners of the genre brings me so desirable confort and feeling that I'm listening to dinozaurs. The whole is abit naive death metal, but played with such dedication and enthusiasm, with so beutiful solos I can't resist to call it "charming". The itself remind me Slayer in their best times, but more deathy one. If you'll add a little bit more aggression, you'll get what Strappado are about! Sorry, I can't give you the price nor the address-the tape isn't available anymore, so don't bother yourself with such things.
 Strappado: Dave Hewson/ vox., g.; Bobby Sadzak/ l.g. ( thanxxxx!!!!); Brian Lourie/ dr.; Mike Dalton/ b..
 Not Dead Yet: Not Dead Yet; Flake; Threshold of Pain; Time Ward; Death Comes Ripping Through You; The Dark; Astral Projector; Telepathic Screams.

 STRAPPADO "Fatal Judgement" demo
 I can only continue the previous review here. The same band, the same music, only the demo is different.
 But while listening to Fatal Judgement I noticed one thing about Strappado- my good fellows from deathrash doom project Prosecutor are very much alike Strappado. Bobby, if you wanna, I can record for you Prosecutor's demo! Hehehehehe...
 3 songs (of 10) here are the same as in "Not dead Yet" demo and I haven't seen any big differences between the two versions...
 Shorter, no point to speak further; I have very big doubts about it's availability now. Great tape in any way.
 Fatal Judgement: The World Around Us; Fatal Judgement; Precious One; Not Dead Yet; Fuck of Death (F. O. D.); The Dark; Flake; Nocturnal Hell; Threshold of Pain; The Curse.

 INNER THOUGHT "Wordly Separation" MC (Dwell Rec. C-1003)
 This will be short- one of the best tapes over here. Bobby Sadzak (ex- Slaughter, Strappado) did his best work to date! Infact, the style changed abit from the Slaughter times-from death to melodical death/ doom, with strong accent to the death side, but very melodical, incorporating female vocals in one song, strongly built on the driving rhythm section which is able to drive me nuts, the Inner Thought music is definitely the one I was missing for so long in the death metal underground. Could easily become a tape of the issue, but I think I gave this title already...
 MY HIGHEST RECOMMENDATIONS!!!
 $ 10 for the MC, $ 16 for CD from: Bobby Sadzak. 256 Patricia Ave./ Willowdale, Ontario M2M 1JB/ Canada or Dwell Rec./ P. O. Box 39439/ Los ANgeles, Ca 90039.

 DAS ICH "Stigma" MCD (Dance Macabre Rec.)
 Electropop again. I am very uninformed about the scene, so you can's except the expert's vewpoint over here-sorry. But, well, Das Ich, after their great success- CD "Die Propheten" (more than 30 000 sold) are back after a long while with the new maxi single which proves the break was only good for the band.
 And, which one-song maxi single (the term "maxi-single" is fitting so good for this release as though speacially created for this one song variations CD (+ one quite the same)) this German duo just arrived in the place where we can call them a major act in the scene. Infact, this superb MCD makes the dancefloor move. You just turn on your player, and with every new incarnation of the "Von Der Armut" you get the dose of the hard dancebeats with quite dark electrosamples which makes your  adrenalin is up & up. To add the vocals means the picture is getting even darker, the adrenalin is on the top and the dancefloor is starting to move... Hell, what an experience!!!
 Nothing exceptional, I must add... (Thanx for Danse Macabre Presss sheet which helped to write this review...).
 Das Ich: Stefan Ackerman/ vox.; Bruno Kramm/ instruments.
 Stigma: Von der Armut (single edit); Von der Armut (extended edit); Der Schrei; Von der Armut (reverse edit).

 DOOMSDAY "CD promo tape '93"
 Post punk mdernism mixed with kind HC (!!!!), 70-ies stuff which is more likely presented in the magazine which publishes interviews with Nikki Sixx or Slash. Hehehehe, I must be joking... Infact, the music is "well considered mixage of symphonic & progressive rock, metal and classical music with a significiant use of (mellow) synths à la Marillion. Patterns are profound with quite alot of twists and turns including epic dashes, funky bass-lines, 70's dashes, flute & trumpet, hammond tunes and "free style" sections. Instrumentation is rather busy, vox are regular, but sometimes exagerrated in mobility & pitch and not always that steady but suitable though."

 DOOMSDAY "The Daily Junkfood" advance for the CD
 What can I add to the above review (taken from USR #12, by the way) ? I suppose I can nothing... But, I will.
 The Daily Junkfood is alot sharper, tighter, more melodical (melodies aren't so exposed here though as in Promo Tape '93) and more heavy/ metalic (???) as well. **Interesting**.
 Don't know the price, but you can try $ 18 to: Björn Göran Detjen/ Borsteler Dorfstr. 6/ 27283 Verden/ Germany. Tel. 04231/ 61534.

 AIRIJA "Yra:" demo
 The legendary Lithuanian band, in which the Maestro itself (Mieczyslaw Litwinski) used to play (the band decided that he overshadow their individualities and partied the ways with him); the Maestro is the person # 1 over here, but it is he who's overshadowed by some egos.
 Yes, the music... Melodic rock. I like it... Sometimes. But I think I'll give the tape to my brother-in-law who's the largest fan of this tape I've ever seen.
 I don't know what to add.... VERY good quality, full color cover, lyrix (in Lithuanian!), photos, etc... Can be good stuff, but I dislike the band's approach to the others ( M. L. in this case).
 No price, no address, no line-up & no song titles will follow, sorry...

 OSIRIS "Respectfully Stuck It In The Doorway" demo
 Thrash/ HC/ groove metal à la those bands who imagine themselves being similar to early Metallica and Suicidal Tendencies simultaneusly. It's hard, driving and "concrete", with HC vocals (what I generally do not like), driving guitars and that something what makes this recording so unique and same as thousands others simultaneusly. Did you understand what I wanted to say? I doubt...
 I liked the tape quite alot though but I doubt I'll put it on my tape recorder again, ever. Sorry guys, you're not my cup of tea (but see previous sentence- I liked you).

 MIRROR OF DECEPTION "Words Unspoken" demo
 One of those demos which once arrived once to my collestion never gonna leave it, kept in the most honorous part of it, not somewhere in the most farest corner.
 Received as one of the first ones for the #2, it is reviewed as the last demo as though the last word for the true underground music section in our newsletter. It's really worth this "honour" for I seriously think about this demo as about one of the best in this issue. Combining the best moments of both styles in this demo. Not accoustic & keyboardish stuff overdosed here as the most their fellow style partners did, just quite heavy (not very though) guitarworking along with melancholic vocals. 4 songs over here, all of them very melodic and enjoyable... Very good stuff!

 V/A "The Very Best of Progress Red Labels" CD (Progress Rec. CD 7913013)
 The reason behind this CD is one- no more Progress Red Labels. And to celebrate the beginning of the new label created on the ashes of the old one, the decision was made to release the CD where all the PRL's releases can be presented. And it was done in fall '94.
 Infact, ALL the bands of PRL are  here, starting from the very first release of Doubt, finishing with the last release of Illdisposed. 12 CDs all in all. Bands include Konkhra, Maceration, Iniquity, Dominus, Trend, Detest, Meatlocker and 2 above ones. Some of them are good, some are not, but mostly listenable with styles ranging from death/ grind to HC (thanx God, not to acid/ house).
 Unfortunately, as usualy with Progress releases, no any ordering information.
 For the label's address look F. Y. W. A. F. D. # 3 review somewhere above.

 CONSEQUENCE "Regression" CD (Human Deadline CD-02)
 Being labels head's (Michael Irmer's) band, Consequence is perhaps in better situation than other bands of Human Deadline, being the only band which solo project the label has released so far, so their will be no comparisons at all. I can say only that the music is very harsh and  sharp electronics with unlistenable (it's so indeed, Michael- my ears are definitely aching after 3 your songs what is a record if to think that I used to listen to Mr. Tardy on full...) vocals and quite unpleasant general sound. But if I'll say that Consequence is Michael Irher himself only and the music is only of one individual, well, then I can understand some sickness over here...

 FAITH OVER REASON "Easy" CD (Big Cat Rec. abb 63 CD)
 Well, let's start with the "words to use" (according to the label's press kit): unaffected, organic, innovative, timeless, sceneless, range, spacey, discordant, untogether. Words not to use: melodic, folk-tinged, rock, singer/ songwriter, sensitive. Now just put them to: "Their music has a........ quality that belies the fact that they have a history. With it's.........  style crossed with delicate......... influence, it's obvious the.............. of the music comes from a......... base."
 Got a picture how the label wants to see their band? He, he, he, he, let them have it!
 For those of you who still want my silly opinion about the CD I can add really very little- the supreme female vocals, the mostly accoustic stuff with some jazz/ funk elements ( I wasn't supposed to use word "rock"). Some songs aren't very  far away from those sung hear the bonfire late at night.... And, hell, this is so exceptional about this band! Not only this though... Very recomandable for those of you who think about themselves as openminded.

 SHUDDER TO THINK "Pony Express Record" CD (Big Cat Rec. abb 65 CD)
 The third full-lengh effort of the band and still beutifully hard to categorize. Melody Maker compares Shudder to Think to 15 artists; among them Queen, Gilbert and Sullivan, Helmet, Faust, Fugazi etc... And even "Shudder to Think are one of the freshiest, most exiting pop groups (pop ???- A. N.) to emerge from America's east coast since Sonic Youth". It's cool to sit in Melody Maker and write the reviews like this. Speaking about arteFACTed - well, the editor-in-chief has no his personal opinion about the band. But some things are for sure:- Despite Melody Maker, this is NOT pop group; - this is one of the most weird CDs I've listened to ever; - this is very hard to categorize indeed; -something like jazzy stuff- caty vocals with light guitars, everchanging melodies and the whole presentation like one of We Bite bands. I gave the CD to the friend for the airplay in Kaunas local FM radioshow- he told  me about phonecalls after the show.... Hehehehe- one is for sure- this stuff is only for those of you who feel to be superbly openminded....
 Must be available in recorstore near you...

 DRONNING MAUD LAND " Maelstrom" CD (Glasnost Rec. GLAS 29)
 Frankly, I am amased quite alot. I never thought that I can discover so many bands under one label which can be so enjoyable and love as most Glasnost bands are.
 DML is the perfect example what music I do like- mystic, charmful and melodic, but energetic, deep and hard simultaneusly, with wave influenced vocals and semi melodic, psychodelic, driving (me nuts) guitar work.
 The best compliment will be if I'll say that this record is worth to be released by THAT Peaceville
(sorry, Glasnost, but that Peaceville still is the best label I can imagine).
 Nothing to add- good music needs no advertising (you'll heard this several times more in this issue!).

 PARALYSED AGE "Nocturne" CD (Glasnost Rec. GLAS 26 P)
 I think this record could be described like "naive gothic". Naive, because the vocalist have a voice like the guy right from the centre of toy city taken from B class western. Gothic because it's more gothic of any reviewed here (except of both Lacrimosa) release. And it is really somewhat gothic. The sound is mostly electronic, the voice is naive (can think about no other description) and the whole is rather better than average. Not the best CD here, but far away of being the worst.
 Wouldn't advertise this band, but not because the music needs no advertising for being good. It's not the case...
 Paralysed Age: Michael Knust; Marco Neumann; Stefan Kirch.
 Nocturne: Intro; Nocturne; X-Mas-X; Morella's Sleep (Nocturnal); Famine; Thirst; Still I Can Hear You Singing; Exile; Hunger; Heaven; End of the World.
 Running time is 42:28.

 DROWN FOR RESURECTION "Sublunar Vacuity" CD (Glasnost Rec. GLAS 27)
 "Philosophic Electronic Cold Wave"- a name one can think about when listening to the second full lenght offer of these 2 German musicians. Seems all here is correct. Anyway I agree with it. Everything over here smells like Depeche Mode or Pink Floyd; or to be more correct, Depeche Mode meets Pink Floyd. The influence for the CD was the obvious exceptional over here. You are free to chose between buying or not, but I suggest the latter is the better....Sorry...
 Drown for Resurection: Helge Neubronner/ instr.; Andreas Fricke/ vox, instr..
 Running time is 66:13.

 THE PSYCHIC FORCE "Traces" CD (KM- Musik)
 Could be quite good electro CD- not very sharp (what I hate), kept on good tempo, sometimes (very rarely though) reminding me of such famous bands as Space or (Latvian) Zodiac (but again- both of them were without vocals- The Psychic Force has vocals (and sometimes the SHARP one) in some songs and generally, they aren't pop band...). Very contrastic CD indeed-ranging from electro-balads (Zeitlimit, Killing is an Art, Underart, etc) to the unpleasantly harsh and making my poor ears suffer cuts (Like An Animal, Gravity Is Present, Acceleration). He, when I do  listen to this, I use programming on my CD player. It helps alot here...

 X MARKS THE PEDWALK "Air Back Trax" CD (Zoth Ommog CD ZOT 118)
 Zoth Ommog, being the division of big musical conglomerate, Music Research Gmbh, is responsible for the electronic side of their business. And what I've get from Music Rsearch let me think/ suggest that this bussines is one of the most profitable for the label. Quite good CDs came to mail box from there...
 X Marks the Pedwalk is quite sharp for me, the beats are too heavyly bumpsing in my ears, the vocals is to sharply echoing, the whole musical imagination of the band does not fit for my "education" (I mean the stuff I've listened before).
 I don't want write any further- afraid to write nonsenses... Sorry...

 Running time- 66:24.
 
 BIGOD 20 "Supercute" (Zoth Ommog CD ZOT 122)
 Well, well, kids, this isn't the stuff for you... Martin Scorcese decided Bigod 20's dark music would set the mood for Cape Fear perfectly. I can call the Bigod 20 rhytmus and "aggressive pop". On one hand, it's techno kept in the best MTV top's traditions, on the hand, it's completely different- I doubt this music would reach even Top 40 or 50. Ever. Because something differs this music from stuff of 2 Unlimited or Kapella. The intelect- that's it!
 Having behing itself mastermind of all Music Research empire- Talla 2 XLC- Bigod 20 can research the terra incognita of today's music ground and feel free to do anything, when the selling isn't the primary pregorative. I think this record will sell in tens of thousands (at least) though. Because it's GOOD.
 Bigod 20: Zip Campisi/ vox; Jallokine & Talla 2 XLC/ producers.
 Supercute: One; Taurin; Plug it in , Otis; It's Easy; Slavery is Guaranteed; Retortion 003; Are You Horny Yet?; Swallow Me; Infidelity Groove; Be Liquid; Lazy.
 Running time is 46:51.

 V/A "The Colours of Zoth Ommog" CD (Zoth Ommog PCCD ZOT 121)
 The 2 bands above + many more, mostly unreleased material over here what makes this CD something exceptional, especcially if you own all original versions of the songs (mostly remixes here). But this isn't for me as I do not...
 To be frank, I liked not most songs here- I am not so openminded perhaps... But some songs really rule!
 Good oporunity for those of you who never met with Zoth Ommog- get this CD and you'll know what bands are deserving attention...
 Running time is 74:15.

 ORANGE SECTOR "Kids In America" MCD (Zoth Ommog CD ZOT 126)
 I liked this CD perhaps the best of Zoth Ommog production (along with Bigod 20, of sure), but, being unfamilar with original Orange Sector stuff, this MCD isn't right for me to make my own conclusions about them. You see, there is only 1 song (of 6) written by Orange Sector themselves- all other are covers of some famous pop stars, including Kim Wilde, Kiss (were they pop stars?) and Extrabreit. But the best song here is their own charming (yes, CHARMING), "One Day". But the 2 versions of Kim's "Kids in America" and old Kiss' classic "I Was Made For Loving You" were definitely more than pleasant to listen to again. And again. And again.
 Sorry, no line-up info.

 Running time is 25:09.

 V/A "Art of Gothic" CD (Talitha Rec. PCD SATE 12)
 "Dark Wave & Gothic Compilation" written on the cover. Well, well, don't think you'll find a gothic inside this. Or, to be more correct, it depends what to call gothic. But, knowing the fact that the majority of bands here are originally signed by US Cleopatra (watch earlier reviews), the meaning of "gothic" becomes clear- at least for me. It's more electro-pop à la Depeche Mode meets OMD. He, he, he; not all bands are such though! One of them- Canticum Funebris (look next review)- is really something special indeed. All others seems bearing one face...and playing the same song differently recorded only (well, not so bad indeed, but... nothing special in this compilation...). Sorry to mention this...
 Some of bands presented here are- Aurora Sutra, Executive Slacks; two Witches; Christian Death; Rosetta Stone; Screams For Tina; Usherhouse; Kommunity FL; Sex Gang Children, etc...
 Playing time is 75:48.

 CANTICUM FUNEBRIS "Endless" CD (Talitha rec. CD SATE 14)
 Frankly, I've never heard something like this before. Accoustic guitar with crystal clear feamle vocals and unforgettable melodies... Folk, gothic, rock, psychodelic- call it now you like, it keeps itself underscriptable, aside of any definition you'll name. For me it is just pure music- and I don't want to call it anyhow. I relax listening to it. definitely one of the highlines of the issue, if not of all my publishing carreer. A MASTERPIECE!
 No info about line-up, sorry.
 Endless: Fields In Summer-Part I; Winter of Life; Strong Captivated; Endless; In Between; (If I Had) Wings-Viola; Another Way; Hypocrisy; Rememberance; Fields In Summer-Part II.
 Running time- 56:08.

 ORPHANED LAND "Sahara" CD (Holy Rec. HOLY 07)
 The doom/ death CD of the issue! Is there something more to say?! I think it isn't...
 Orphaned Land's avangarddistic (including Tarbuka, Knnoon, Hud, female vocals, keyboards) approach to the death metal is bringing comparisions with the revoliutions in my mind which made My Dying Bride with their demo. Infact, it's another MASTERPIECE of the issue (it's quite rich having so much of them -don't you think so?).
 I love this record so much that any my recommendations wouldn't be too strong to make sure you'll get this.
 Album feature few songs of the band's first and sole demo (The Beloved's Cry), but the demo is still available for USD 7 from the label: Holy Rec./ 4 Bd. Gutenberg/ 93190 Livry-Gargan/ France. Tel.: + 33 1 43 02 24 20; Fax.: + 33 1 43 02 28 95.

 LYCIA "Live" MC (Projekt rec. PRO 49)
 This is beyond any description. The collection of noises, making graceful melodies, with rare vocal interuptions, this MC musically represents the style I cannot compare to anything nor describe by any means. It's something I was unconscously looking for all my conscious life. As simple as this. And as sad as this. Sad because the music is mostly sad and melancholic as the long and cold autumn evening...
 Watch out for this release...
 And for this label- THE LABEL OF THE ISSUE.

 V/A "Of These Reminders" MC (Projekt Rec. PRO 50)
 the event which this release is dedicated to remains to me unknown completely. But I do know the EVENT I owe so much! It's called Black Tape for a Blue Girl. It's the band of the head of Project Rec., Mr. Sam Rosenthal. And I owe his band for this release because in this Charming cassette are included only BTFBG cover versions done by projekt's bands, guest bands from America, Europe & Australia and even the fans, recording their expermental sounds in the home-studios; all of them inspired by the touching ethereal sound of Black Tape for a Blue Girls. This release is something incredible and I am not afraid to say- ABSOLUTELY RULING STUFF. It touched my very heart... I remain speechless...
 released as MC and limited edition (5000) double CD, it is obtainable and MUST for everyone into dark ambient...
 Some of the bands are: Thanatos; Bleeding Like Mine; Faith & Disease; Love Spirals Downwards; Soul Whirling Somwhere; Stoa; Lycia; etc, etc, etc...

 V/A " Beneath the  Joy Floe" CD (Project Sample PRO 14)
  Just look at the above review and imagine most of those bands are playing own stuff... Shorter, if not better than  Of These Reminders, then similar good touching, incredible and hardly describable music. Infact, some bands are better in my opinion (Soul Whirling Somwhere, Love Spirals Downwards, Thanatos, Black Tape for a Blue Girl), some are worse (no names will follow), some are 1:1 like Depeche Mode (Eden - here at least), but generally this one is the right to finish the issue's music reviews on. Projekt is, no doubt, THE LABEL OF THE ISSUE!!!

 I can't write bad things here- zine is done by very good friends of mine, but... Besides Audrius Simkunas, a truly dedicated guy, the left æ (Donatas & Ramunas) editors have nothing to offer except of dull interviews and 1:1 rewritten band bios. Especially Donatas is good in this...

 Undoubtely the best Lithuanian musical zine to date. Lithuanian only? I doubt... This is perhaps one and only zine out of my homeland I am not ashamed of... Besides, the zine, the guy has the tele show of everything connected with metal, so it's really good contact in Lithuania!
 I wouldn't harass you whom the ints are with... I hope this wouldn't change your mind to possess this one...

-BIZARRE # ???. 40 pages A5, xerox, $ ??? ( 2 could be enough).
 The zine itself isn't one of I can call interesting or worth your attention. Is the man behind it - A. Novak, figure well known in the circles of worldwide underground movement. Don't you know him? Hehe, I didn't too! Until he himself haven't wrote me, sending the issue of Bizarre, some ads of his activities and short proposition (if I am interested in further details- to contact) I contacted, but then followed the silence. Silence until now.
 Well, speaking about Bizarre, it's pile of electro reviews. They themselves are better than mines, but... the very presentation of the zine isn't the best, speaking frankly.

-GIBBERING MADNESS. 40 pages A5, xerox, $ 1/ £ 0.25.
 Literature inside this literaly fanzine brought me comparison with some horror writers (not with H. P. Lovecraft, S. King or C. Barker though) whose short stories I used to read when young and unexperienced. And, this is quite naive. Especcially poems (lots of them here). Stories are...how to say in better way... for the kids. One think I liked here are 2 video reviews- quite informative, revealing the basic plot and how much zombies one will see watching movie A or B.
 c/o Evan/ 59 Woodstock Rd./ Netheredge, Sheffield/ England.

-GLOBAL MAIL. 8 pages A4, pro print, $ 1 everywhere.
 Newsletter publication dedicated to the whole undergound with slight focus on E-mail, mail art, ustings of some really weird activities of some really weird individuals. For example, what you could think about " send something what you've found in the street" or " send me your birth certificate". Very good source of information, a kind of yellow pages for die-hard undergrounders.

-INTERESTING ## 1, 2, 3. pro print, pro-layout, $ 3 everywhere.
 The most interesting of reviewed here publications for the ordinary human (I mean not for the mole of underground). The editor decide to keep various clipping together and to make a zine. So inside each issue one can find really various thoughts of various people on various topics with slight focus on medical/ social things (the editor is doc himself, so this priority is understable). Many interesting stuff over here, but the  top of the tops was the last joke of the # 2. And generally, well worth the price. Only $ 3 you can pose between your pals quoting, for example, Nail Gaiman " Life is a disease, sexually trasnmitted and fatal". Or " it is a scientific fact that if you stay in California you lose one point of your IQ every year" (Truman Capone).

Hi, moles, here's Saulius from BALIONAS comics fanzine and my column  in arteFACTed about comics zines, magazines, books, newspapers or whatever you there are editing. And I want to sorry  that you'll be tortured with my "perfect" english . When I was a student, through English lessons I draw comics, not listened a teacher, my fault....

 NOITARUMPU #3 (The Journey to Hallucination), A5; 35 p.; $ 3 from: Pekka Ollikainen/ Viholanranta 3/ 37126 Nokia/ Finland.
  Do you know what does mean a title Noitarumpu? Sure you don't. But I know ( you're lucky that you have so clever journalist, heh...heh...m...heh...). It means The Witchdrum.
 Well, it's high quality comics  magazine which represents mysterious and dark (not always), sick parts of human soul. Also you'll can find some sort (as one of editors call it self) of mind smashing humour or stories which have roots in old Scandinavian customs and believs. In issue 3 you'll can find a comics Escape 1: "El Muerte" done by cult artist Jeff Nicholson. If you don't know his works, you can not read my column. Bye... For those which knows Jeff''s comics, I'm continuing my blahblahing. 
 Jeff is not only one non Finnish artist in this issue. Another guest is Sasa Rakezic from Serbia. Yes, yes from dishated by world Serbia. Of course we can blame Serbian politics for done war crimes in Bosnia-Herzegovina or Croatia, but we can't forget that there lives people which have feelings too. In comics of Sasa you'll can see another, unknown side of barikades. You must read two his comics, "A day in Serbia" and "During the days of a civil war in Yugoslavia".
 But what a Finnish magazine without that country artists. And we have bunch of them here. Not to much  place to write about'em separately, so it's will be good reason to buy Noitarumpu. I'll just write authors and titles: Marko Koskinen "The oak; Pauli Kallio/ Ville Pirinen "Ornete Birks Makkonen surprisingly stays in middle-Botnia and plans for the fruing of Pancakes"; Maria Björklund/ Pekka Ollikainen "Nikki and the star of Africa", "Continue on the comfort line", "Nikki's blues-four seasons of trouble" and Minna Rajamo/ Pekka Ollikainen "The Hitch-Hikker" ( the moral of that story could be such: guys, don't pick up chicks which have animalistic tatoos. Heh...heh...just kidding).
 By the way, all comics are in Finnish and those assholes which don't understand it (me too) get  English translations.

 NOITARUMPU # 4 (all as above)
 Pekka, sent me this issue, but he didn't enclosed English translations. He didn't explained why. So about this issue I can say just what I see. And I see some kind of novel (not comics)
"Petäjä korpi" by Toppo with ilustrations of Silja Siirila. What about is it? I don't know...
 Next on view we have comics in English (thanks God!) done by Jahnis "Folktale about that how brave hero Vanja gain ogre and how he save beautiful Vasilisja". Way how he did it is really fascinating. After happy end of that story we have another one Finnish language comics by Maria Björklund "Paluu". There is shown old female waiting for something near window. Something comes at last and says"Reikiä nolla!" that means nothing to my fucking brains.
 But Maria gaved mercy on poor non  Finnish readers and created two comics in English, "Awakenings" (girls and boys you must sleep together, because " sometimes you think everything's allright, but things are really much better") and "Dick's adventures:The erections disappears" (horror for impotents). After that we have bunch comics in Finnish: Toni Väisänen "Hirvi-Simuna", Janne Siltavuori "Vincen Poika", P.A. Manninen "Rakastin radioaktiiviseen moottorisahazombieen ulkoavaruudesta", P.Kallio/ K. Koskivaara "Painava sana". Oooops... it's difficult write words which you don't understand. There's also another English language comics by Gunni "Stulli in Summerjobbummers", but I was tired to read it so better be if you'll do it by yourself.
 Oooh, and I forgot. Editors of Noitarumpu have making reviews about comics in Finnish magazine "Rumba", it's a biggest popular culture / rock magazine in Finland. If you want to be reviewed in "Rumba" sent your comics stuff ( with English translation  with  full info about prices, posibility of trade, etc...) to: Noitarumpu/ "Sarjakulma"/ PL 56/ 70101 Kuopio/ Finland.

 KARNO'S KLASSICS #42 (Inside Karno!), A5; 16p.; $ 1 from: Mailbox Books/ P.O. Box 1278/ Roslyn/ PA 19001/ USA.
 Let's take a brake from Finland and look at Iceland/ USA. Why I mentioned those both countries? Because Kjartan Arnörsson, creator of Klassics,  the most his time is spending working in USA, but right now he's visiting his home land Iceland and soon will be year as he's there. In USA Kjartan is pretty good known as great artist of porno anthropomorphic comics. Don't afraid word "porno", because his comics as "Porno Babies", "Bull O'Brannon" or "Kitten Kelly" are very intelligently written and are not about just fucking. I'm not big fan of porno stuff (any kind), but I was admired by Kjartan's comics great art and big doze of not flat humour. I've hope all Kjartan's comics are available at address above. Check it out ! You'll not be disapointed.
 In Karno's Klassics you'll can find some kind of very popular right now on American comics scene of autobiographical comics (this time not porno stuff). "Karno exposes himself" introduce reader with short view of Kjartan's life, his family and his problem with "them". Who're those "them"? Don't be silly, just buy stuff and all will be clear. Also there's some kind of comics diary of Kjartan's trip to Europe and comics con in Denmark (for Lithuanian readers I can promise that this will be published in Balionas # 2 too).
 And one quote from comics "Shotgun fun!" : "(....) There is no all-powerful sadists in the sky.(....)". Gues who's sadist in the sky?...

AQQ - MAGAZYN KOMIKSÖW # 5, A5; 36p.; $ 1 from: Lukasz Zandecki/ Os. B. Chrobrego 31/32 / 60-681 Poznan/ Poland.
 Periodically published comics zine from Poland. The first one published professionaly from Eastern Europe and the best. All material is in Polish, I don't know how  things are going, but Lukasz promised to do English translations for foreign readers. Polish language it's not problem for me, so I can tell what about AQQ is. 
 The guys from AQQ are publishing only Polish young artists which have no chance to be published in official Polish press, dominated by Marvel and DC creaps. Structure of AQQ zine is very simple: more than half pages are occupied by comics, rest by news, reviews, articles, discussions and other things which are very enjoyable for comics fans, artists and critics.
OK, here's short  list of comics in issue 5: Witold Domanski "Ka...raz...ka...dwa" (by the way on the last year Polish comic con in Lodz he was awarded as most innovatory artist); Jaroslaw Zukowski "Sztuka zycia" (also one of the last years comic con  winners); Tomasz Piorunowski "Sexautomat" (erotic short comics in veins of Manara); Piotr Drzewiecki "Kapciuszek" (black humour); Piotr Tolysz "Bolterier"; S.Jezerski/ R.Maskoliunas/ T. Marciniak "Ten magiczny dzwonek"; Bartosz Kurc "Arbeit macht frei"; Ireneusz Kowalski "Ostre lata 60-te" (parody on Bill Clinton); Piotr Olszowka "Lonesome Dove". All comics are very professionally done and you want to be common with polish comics art this zine is the best way .
 
GOMIX #  5, A5; 40p.; $ 3 from Hans Nissen/ Juuttank 9/ 70500 Kuopio/ Finland.
 Another high quality underground comics magazine from Finland dedicated to dark philosophy as NOITARUMPU. And no english translation ( I didn't get it, but Hans said that transaltion are existing...) again. So my impressions are from that I see and I see  "Kissat" by Petri Tolppanen, "Mato"  by Maria Björklund (beware, vampire sworms are coming!), "Paskakeiju" by Juha Vuorma (big tits in closet), "Nuolia" Antti Immonen ( death, love and arrows), "Reincarnation" Saulius Kruöna (that's my not borned twin brother), "Iloinen Satu" Hans Nissen (editor of GOMIX is good artist ), "Virasto" J-P Pohjalainen (biurocracy is not Eastern Europe problem), "Iltayölla" M. Björklund ( two friendly skellets),  "Paska juttu" it's collectivelly done comics by Timo Raita, J-P Pohjalainen, Antti Immonen, Marko Koskinen. Eh, to put it in anoher way: don't trie this at home kids!
   By the way there's also available GOMIX T-shirts (the most artistic  T-shirt ever I have saw) and postcards ( if you wanna sent birthday card to your metal head gal/guy it is the best thing). Ask for details at address above.

VACUUM # 3 (1/94), A4, 34p.; $ 3 from Maria Björklund/  Ratakatu 12 As. 465/ 96100 Rovaniemi/ Finland.
 Who said that girls can not make good zines? VACUUM is good sample that girls  can make even better zines than males.Petri Bergman and Maria Björklund  are making amazing  comics zine in the  high artistic and technical quality in country which have not very higher number of population as Lithuania.  Lithuanian girls, what are you waiting for ?  Three zines (not comics), "Juodas Kraujas" ,"Dzirtas Akoscevinas" and "Dorado Raganos", here in Lithuania, it's not enough .
 Well as previous zines, VACUUM don't have English translation (just two comics in english), but editors ,  said that some stories is imposible to translate because it's understandable only for Finnish reader. That's not so bad. But you can ask me why I'm fucking your attention with  it if you'll not understand it? There's one reason- if you are comics artist send your stuff to girls and they'll print it in VACUUM. And  your work must be not published before in Finland. Simply? 
  Description of zine contest could be such: post punk/ modern / professionaly drawn comics zine.Sorry, but I will not write all names and titles of comics.  Also VACUUM have the most interesting looking editorial ever I have saw.
 Support VACUUM artisticly and financialy!!!

 That's all. If you want   that your comics would be reviewed in  arteFACTed # 3  you're  sent your stuff at this address: Saulius Krusna, Persekininkai, Parecenu p-tas, 4589 Alytaus raj. , Lithuania. Also you can ask (if you're interested) about my zine BALIONAS too.
