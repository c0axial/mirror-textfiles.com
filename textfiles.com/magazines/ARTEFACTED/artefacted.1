              You want underground? You've got it!
                          1994 spring

            Hi there!

    Ace of "arteFACTed" newsleter over here.
    You probably were familar with my 2 previous projects: zines
"Deathmare" (quite a morbid one, in Lithuanian; 3 issues out) &
"Thy Kingdom Come" (a lot better, but still not so good; 3 copies
out in English). So now my activities have decreased to the 
minimal level of the pro-printed NON-PROFIT newsleter with 6 - 8
pages. The circulation is one thousand copies and I usualy give
them for free, enclosing in all my mail I send out.
     So there are a lot of posibilities for you to be featured in
the publication. I don't ask for any demos or CD's (but if you
want to get a review, you must send me the example of your releases).
I fully realize that for some of you it'll be quite expensive.
Send me anything, it will be prompty reviewed and you'll be given
a free copy, of course.
     The free copy is already enclosed for I don't want you to 
think I am just another Lithuanian rip-off zine. Well, take it 
easy!

     W/B/S, take care and enjoy the publication, if it's worth
this. I thank you for your support & dedication. Don't let the
underground die!
  
                                Your buddy

NOTE: Well, this is an e-zine version of "arteFACTed" newsletter
      of my very best friend ACE. The previous two (very well
      known in Lithuanian and also in European underground scene)
      were oriented in Hard-Heavy-Thrash-Metal-Core-Techno-Industrial-
      -and-other-aggressive music, as the "arteFACTed"#1 is too.
      But an "arteFACTed"#2 (a little patience few weeks more and
      you'll see it too) will be more widely open to electronic,
      ambient, experimental & other very strange music and not
      only. ACE will try to creep in, may I call it "Art zone", 
      trying to bring you news of Movies, Books, Pictures and 
      other interesting Worlds... So that's it. 
       Any questions, suggections or your "what-you-think-about-it"
      are welcome at e-mail address:
              jurena@zalgiris.pit.ktu.lt
      Please keep contacts! All the best...

ENTRE LA BASURA "En el nombre del fraude,del fisco y de  los Estados Unidos,OK"
demo
What a title I must say.What a shit here, I must add! Something like thrashcore
with death metal vocals...I simply can't stand a combination like this.Besides,
the music lacks of creativeness and something  I  can  call  "charm". It's  not
catchy . And  these  lyrics  in  Spanish  about  Yankies  and how they colonise
Argentina(that's all what I understood) are at least stupid in my opinion . And
the whole band is,as well.
  Tape is pro copied on high quality cassettes,with full color cover,etc.,etc.,
etc...$5 to:Fabian Giacca/Ombu 2789 "D"/(2000) Rosario/Prov. Santa Fe/Argentina
  Entre la Basura:Negro/vox,git.,Fabian/b.,Gustavo/g.,Andre/dr.,Mateo /vox on 2
songs.

INTENSE MOSH "Dulce y Carinoso" demo
 Again Argentina;again that kind of stupid thrashcore , reminding me the famous
about that French scene;again the Spanish lyrics; and again they're political (
I gues-my Spanish isn't so good to understand something). I think this style is
dead and any attempt to rise it adding melodies, political actualities or color
covers of the tapes is doomed from the very beginning too. I don't know what to
add...

KOBALTO "Living with Disaster" (Kralendijk Prod.)
 These Argentinian reviews are in order of "the next the better". But  I am not
sure about this band,Kobaltos.They ,frankly , aren't supposed to be reviewed on
these pages,but...if I promised to be openminded to review everything I get , I
must do this!But I think I'm not openminded enough to accept THIS.In band's bio
is written they play "thrash".Hell,no way! It's lighter version of Helloween ,I
think.Or,to be more correct,the heavier version of Viper. Melodical heavy metal
with,perhaps,the worst vocals I've heard EVER.Maybe the music itself is worth a
little bit of your attention,but vocals just SHITS the whole impression.Nothing
more to add...
 Cassette is published with everything the full lenghth album needs: full color
cover,lyrics,photo,printed cassettes,etc. ... Sorry, I don't know the price,but
$8 should be enough.Pass'em to: Kralendijk Producciones / Sanches De Bustamante

Cavana/dr.

ABAXIAL"Neo-drama" demo
This is definitely  better  than  the  last one...But still not very pleasant &
original thrash . I can feel the same "influence" of the French "psycho" thrash
scene over here as in Intense Mosh's case. I really had no fun at all listening
to this 5 song debut demo.But,hey,I am not right here!The fun was to follow the
lyrics (printed on the cover!) when the singer sings ...Ha-ha-ha!!! I think the
guy never had heard how the true English sounds alike! But this seems to be the
common thing for all these South American bands...Shortly,the tape looks GREAT,
sounds EARACHE-ly (NOT Earache Rec.-ly!!!) . I don't know the price, but try $6
if you still want to send your bloody money to : Jose Bonifacio 103 / 1 # "C" /

DEVASTACION "Demo'93" 
This is much better than 4 last reviewed bands ! One  of  the  better  from the
South America in my opinion! Devastacion is just the great example of the tech-
nical, innovative and "positive" deathrash in the veins of Atheist, early Krea-
tor & Possessed. Sure, I don't want to say they're playn' the same music... The
style is, maybe, similar, but the means to achieve the result are abit original
. And I am killed by their section!!! The bassist is superb!!! Living God!!!
 Demo'93 is the first official tape of these Argentina's monsters ( as far as I
understood from the baby-English written bio ) and I think it's one of the best
debuts EVER! The band is quite mature though-formed back in 1987 , so the  guys
had enough time to improve their skills and explore their talents...
 Incredible demo! Get this 30 min masterpiece for $7 to: Gustavo Quiroga/Virrey
 Loreto 2665 Cap. Fed./CP (1426) Bs.As./Argentina.
 Devastacion: Walter Ortiz/r.g.,vox.;Gonzalo Giulano/b.;Gustavo Quiroga / dr. ;
Guilermo Lamadrid/l.g..
 Demo'93: Lost Youth ; Death and Destruction ; Great Imposicion ; T.V.  World ;
Dark Life; System of Putrefaction.

VIBRION "Erradicated Life" demo
Abit worse than Devastacion , but still good death metal . After  all these Ko-
balts & Intense Moshes it's very pleasant relief to listen to a  band like Vib-
rion: professional, seriosly minded, technical & catchy. And yeah , brutal too!
Maybe not so heavy as Obituary or Rottrevore are, but it's OK with me ! I fully
understand that sometimes heavyness and high technics aren't compatible . And I
can live without this. What about you?
 The tape is made really professionally, including ALL you can desire  from  it
(you know, maybe, the highest standarts for a demo, I want to hope). Sorry, but
no price is known. You can reach the band by calling or faxing (541)568-6039 or
writing to: Vibrion/Simbron 43044 to."A"/(1417) Cap. Fed. Bs. As./Argentina.

Cederborg/dr..
 "Erradicated Life": Massive Frustration; Immortal Class; Schizoid's Obsession;
 Legal Fights; Erradicated Life.

ISIS "I-don't-know-how-it-is-called" demo(?)
Guys, that's completely different from what i've ever got in the past! For it's
not even heavy metal, just rock in the veins of Nirvana, Pearl Jam or any other
famous act, the idol of teenage gals. But Isis are very professional about what
they're doing, a serious band with a serious future . I  even can't  count  all
Isis influences: blues, jazz, guitar rock, etc., etc., etc... One  is for sure:
this band is more than a trendy scarecrow/marionette copying any of the popular
styles. That's professional band with professional musicians  and  professional
attitude towards the music. Highly recommended stuf for all  OPENMINDED  metal-
heads!

INFERNAL BLEEDING "Invocation of Evil" demo
Oooh, my God, NY bands are so unhealthy for my poor ears! I think I've got int-
ernal bleeding inside my head... Can you imagine the mix between Cannibal Corp-
se and Pyrexia? So if you can, you know what's Internal Bleeding about ! By the
way, Darryl Wagner (Pyrexia) is the guest on backing  vocals over here ! So the
similarity is even more sensable. Shorter, nothing  original  here , but if you
are into sheer brutality, this is definitely a tape to own ! Get this quality ,
chrome, full color, lyrics, photo, etc...for $5 from: Chris Pervelis/ 18 Sunny-
woods Dr./Huntington Station, NY 11746/USA. Hotline: (516) 423-5213. Also avai-

V/A "Deaf Metal" CD (Deaf Rec.)
This CD/MC format release is supposed to hit the stores with the ultra low, low
price of L2.99 and hell, that's well worth it! For the compilation presents not
the well established artists of Deaf Recods only ( such as At the Gates , Bani-
shed, Accidental Suicide, Morta Skuld) with their old or completely new tracs ,
but also such underground legends as Dissection (Swe) , Chorus of Ruin, Maimed,
Eucharist, Doomed. Such ex-Deaf bands as Impaler , Therion, Pitchshifter & Pro-
phecy of Doom are also presented here. By the way , I completely can't underst-
and why they also took the bands of other labels (I'm speaking about Nightfall)
... Shortly, great thing for the great price ! Try  to  get  it from your local
store or directly from the label: Deaf Rec. / P.O. Box 17/Dewsbury/W.Yorkshire,
WF12 8AA/England. Ph.: 0924-45821; Fax.: 0924-455120.
 By the way, that's the only job what Jonny ( ex-Peaceville working " artist ")
has in his former label! RESPECT!!!

V/A "D.S.F.A.#5. Resurrection of Reality" CD
I hope you do remember D.S.F.A. from T.K.C. issues # # 4 & 5 . Don't you ? It's
GREAT promotion company of the Dutch death /thrash /doom/grind/core bands. This
time it's their 5th release, after 2 tapes (## 1,2), 1 LP (# 3) & 1 CD (# 4). 
 I can't say #5 is the best  of  their  releases for in the past they've worked
with such titans as Gorefest, Sinister , Acrostichon , Bluurgh , Beyond Belief,
The Gathering, Dead Head, etc.,etc.,etc... This one has no such big  names ( so
far at least), but hell, NO BAD BANDS HERE !!! So prepare yourself for some re-
ally amazing newcommers from the Netherworld! They are: Dead End ( melodic doom
death, 2 songs), Altar (raw death;watch the next review, 1 song ) , Sad Whispe-
rings (doom/death, 1 song; debut CD out) , Phlebotomized (really amazing sympho
death doom grind, 1 song), Lords of the Stone (doom, 2 songs), Korsakov (death/
thrash, 1 song), Etherial Winds (heavy death, 2 songs), Thy Shall Die (deathco-
re, 1 song), Stentorian (death, 1 song), Out of the System (progressive thrash,
1 song, ex-Abacinate). The CD has a cover ( of course!) with the band  photos ,
addresses, merchandise, thanxlists... $ 17, 500 BFr. or 20 DM to: Anthony v / d
Berg/ Bloemenlaan 181/ 4383 TC Vlissingen/ The Netherlands.
 Running time is 75:20.
 Besides, the guy has his own column in Metal Hammer/Aardchok with 29500 copies
 circulation mothly. So every band which wants to appear in the largest Benelux
 metal publication is encouraged to write and to send promos to  the  most busy
man on the planet Earth! ACT!!!

ALTAR "And God Created Satan to Blame for His Mistakes" demo
I'm really impressed by this Dutch death/grind outfit and this  demo . It's one
of the most brutal, unholy and earcrushing one reviewed here ! Though the track
in the D.S.F.A. # 5 (Jesus is Dead) was the best I've heard from Altar, the de-
mo's 4 ones are killing as hell too! These  satan  followers do know how to use
their instruments properly and how to play music so technical & catchy the same
 time that I want to call this demo one of  the  most  brutal thing Dutch scene
has ever bred. Speaking about the underground scene, surely. Not mentioning all
 these pestilences, asphyxes & gorefests...
 The guitar sound reminds me Death in "Leprosy" ; the  drumming with it's godly
heavyness- a band called Deicide; the vocals aren't very low , rather  normal (
speaking about the death scene, of course), but very  deep and well  used ; the
bass is rather a normal one too, it means "I'll cannot play like he".
 Get this for $7/10 DM from: Chris Meijdam Agency / Spaanskamp. 83/7771 BN Har-
denberg/Holland. Ph.: (0)5232-63639.
 Altar: Edwin Kelder/ vox.; Nils Vos /b.; Bert Huisies / g.; Marco Arends/ dr.;
Marcel v. Haaff/g..
 And God...: Throne of Fire; Forced Imprudence; Psycho Damn ;  Cross the Bridge
of False Prophecies/Dismantling the God.

EVE OF MOURNING "Acheronian Winter" demo
These 3(+1) guys out of Illinois created a  demo  even  the  godly Winter could
envy only. Being their debut release, this  45 minutes blood offering establish
Eve of Mourning as one of the new doom gods to  pay  your  attention  to . That
means they are as this: hop & on the top. Don't miss these 6 songs filled  with
desperation and sadness, these true doom operas, symphonies of the doom !!!  My
highest recommendations!!! Got it? Well, then $6/7 wouldn't  be too much for ya
to pass to: P.O. Box 306/Palos Heighs, IL 60463/U.S.A.. You'll get nicely wrap-
ped demo which sounds perfectly (perhaps abit "flat", but that's not the band's
problem) and the pleasure of being SLOWLY decomposed by:  Scott McElheney/l.g.;
Brian Whited/b.; Joel Leonard/r.g.; Alain/ session drums.

S.A.ADAMS "Exiled on Green Street" MC
There was a band called "The Fury" some time ago in a city called NY. It relea-
sed a cassette LP called "Sex..." after few successful demos  &  EPs . Now  the
band is split-up, but the man, called S.A.Adams continues the sound, the music,
the attitude. And if you were familiar with their earlier stuff , this  is just
continuation of it; but if you weren't, you must check out this reasonably made
 mix of thrash, hardcore and hell-knows-what-more! Good old rock'n'roll, maybe.
The result is angry, perhaps a little commercial , but  still very good anyway!
Rise up the banner of hate!!!
 No price info, but try $6/7 to: S.A.Adams/P.O.Box 57/Island Park,NY 11558-0057
 or call NIR Records: 516-889-3124.

Drain; Forever Yours; Animals; Pearls,not Diamonds; (Just a ) Reckless Fortune;
Chapter Closed.

FLYING SKULL "Darkness" MC
The band with such name must be nuts, I think; and not so little...At least the
music in one's imagination must have alot of unusual stuff in it . But hell no,
everything over here was heard by me for so many times that  I really have lost
the count. The band seems to be around since 1985 , did  a  couple of demos and
once appeared in one compilation LP and , finally , in 1990 they emerged with a
full length album called "Darkness". Musically , Flying Skull seems to be stuck
back in the eighties with their NWOBHM influenced stuff . Hell , I haven't said
it's bad or something! For the band is technical, openminded , 100% underground
minded (they are worth to sigh a deal right now , but  they  don't want to lose
their freedom). And the music is really worth to be checked out (not by the die
hard deathsters thouth): melodic stuff, riff-based with diuble bass-headed fast
songs to the must in this kind of albums ballads.
 25 DM for the CD or 15 DM for the MC  to : Roland Saager / Konigsforststr. 16/

HAGGARD "Proggressive..." MCD (1MF Rec.)
Another German band, but quite new one this time , formed  a little more than a
year and a half ago;new band is new style definitely .And the contrast with the
previous German act is more than obvious . In  other  words , Haggard with it's
melodic and powerful death metal differs a lot from  Flying  Skull  with  it' s
hard'n'heavy stuff of the seventies. Well, this MCD is  really  great  piece of
the way the bands like Torture and Nightfall were going earlier.Highly  techno-
influenced, melodical, brutal & heavy riffed death metal with nearly orchestral
arrangements is very enjoyable and really worth your pure $10 ;  but  check out
the CD availability before ordering! The circulation is limited to 500 !!!

IMC "Enter Delirium" CD
Frankly, I don't know what IMC means literally, musically they're another bunch
of motherfuckers who decided to mix all styles  together . Deathy  vocals  with
grungy & funky music sounds really original  and  fresh . Adding  the enourmous
sense of good humour makes IMC truly well  worth  your  attention  and giving a
good listening.This band, with some extra, rare instruments ( trumpets,trombone
& saxophone) really differs from the rest of death /thrash/punk/folk/doom/core/
country/sympho/etc./etc./etc. band wagon.Crazy stuff!
 $15 to: IMC/C.P.120/1911 Ovronnaz/Switzerland;

HUMAN "Vomit Discreetly" cassette-LP
 This is the first band out of the New Zealand I've heard  and the  fate is ro-
gue enough for me in this case,presenting the fun-death  project, the parody on
the whole scene and death metal movement's gory side.He he,the guys aren't even
trying to keep this in secret! Anyway, this 10 (!) song  underground demo-LP is
well worth to be released on the vynil! I'm sure it'll sell more than 1,000 co-
pies for the guys are really pushing everything out of themselves! The technics
aren't superb,but I can fell the spirit of the Scream Bloody Gore (remember the
legend?) over here. So  "parody"  isn't the exact way to describe this piece of
shit.It's much deeper and better thing than moshing around!

MOTOTRONKO "Bilize (Mototronkicide)" demo
Haven't you seen one the most original flyers in the underground with the real-
ly excellent idea behind it? It's the Mototronko's joke! By the  way, the sense
of humour is rather overdosed over here, even on the cover, not  speaking about
inside! But who cares! The music  is  rather  overtechnical,perhaps losing some
heaviness because of this, but  somebody called Mototronko an Italian answer to
Atheist.I can't be so brave to compare them to one of my all time faves,but one
is true-I've never heard anything out of Italy closer to the megatechnical Gods
of Florida.Perhaps Mototronko are a little bit thrashier, but, hell, the vocals
are of the such kind that most of the death bands could envy only.Incredible!!!

KILLING ADDICTION "Omega Factor" MC (JL America Rec.)
That's the first my experience with JL America records which is so hated by so-
me and so adored by others! I don't know about the label as the whole, but  one
of their bands can easily blow your little brain away! K.A., old & good buddies
of mine (hell-o,Pat!)  from Florida seem not to care very much about their lis-
teners mental health.More brains out-the better! Ha ha,I'm kidding,surely! But,
frankly, Omega  Factor  can be vital for some people without serios death metal
listening background. The stuff is REALLY BRUTAL and I'm NOT kidding here!!! It
differs abit from the brutality,say, Cannibal Corpse or Autopsy throw onto your
poor heads,but it's still quite solid piece of twisted  guitars , serious death
metal vocals (sometimes ultra low,sometimes even sonorous...) and  the  section
which is the main brainblower! Shorter,this is the thing for the SERIOUS death-
freaks only.

MOON OF SORROW "Crystal Emotions" CD (Ignition Rec.)
Undoubtely one of the best releases in this issue for me personally. Very moody
gothic/doom with simply excellent song structures,having NOTHING in common with
death metal but still heavy enough to rise up my interest to the point the ado-
ring of the band begins.Believe me,that's something new & special! At least for
your poor servant who writes these lines late at night (early in the morning?).
Nearly orchestral arrangements,intruments used for their direct purpose-to cre-
ate the melody and atmosphere,keyboards here &  there, sometimes female vocals,
sometimes light & slow,sometimes heavy & quick as  hell; that's Moon of Sorrow.
Recommendations!!! Sorry,no price & line-up is known...Ignition rec. is new Se-
maphore's label,so you can ask info either form them or from: Moon  of  Sorrow/

PSYCHOSIS "SQUIRM" adv.tape (Massacre Rec. MASS CD 018)
A bio writes that's really unique band with  really unique sound. Well,I don't 
aggree completely! For me that's one more band in the veins of ex-The Fury(S.A.
Adams & Co now).The sound,the same attitude,the same,angry maneer of singing(by
the way,the vocals RULE!).That's not death metal definitely,so freaks,keep asi-
de of this CD! That's the music for crossover,core & psychotic metal fans only.
Though the thrashers could dig it also. I  mean the stuff has something for all
above mentioned.But I repeat-no death freaks are allowed here!

HAVOC MASS "Killing the Future" adv.tape (Massacre Rec. MASS CD 019)
One more Morrisound "victim".Thrash metal this time. But hell,I can call it one
of the better ones EVER!!! Even some HC elements don't make the music less wor-
thfull! I don't know what to add! BRILLIANT musicians, not newcommers ( members
of the mighty ones:Fester and Savage!) made a band with really exclusively good
future.One of the best around,check it out! My highest recommendations for  the
thrashers!

WARGASM "Ugly" adv.tape (Massacre Rec. MASS CD 021)
Well, after their incredible debut CD "Why Play Around ?" on Profile Rec. I did
not  hope  they'll release something even more fantastic! Infact 5 years passed
away since then,the band did 4 demos but no label seemed to be interested.Until
the latest  demo reached Massacre Rec. mailbox.The band was signed immediately!
But,in  the label's place I wouldn't sign the band which plays music like this.
I mean  something like thrash/core with ultra weak vocals.The music style isn't
in my taste anyway and adding the weakest vocals I've heard doesn't make it be-
tter. So this CD isn't the most pleasant one in my collection. But as there are
the weak points,there are also one incredible thing-the drumming. Hell, these "
hit'n'pound" make me feel like I'm listening rather to Cancer than to the "thr-
ash/core metal legend from Boston,USA".

Army(5:38);Spirit in Decay(6:54);Dead Man's Smile(2:54);Dreadnaught Day(6:25).

LAVATORY "To Protect and To Serve" adv.tape(Massacre Rec. MASS CD 021)
I am not big expert in HC,so what you'll read in  this review you must not take
at face value.It's just my personal opinion.Well, Lavatory are from Germany,but
everything tells me they must be from East Coast ( NY I mean ) for the sound is
exactly the same as I've suffered listening to Cro-Mags or Sick of ot All.I can
bravely call Lavatory "techno HC".It's super-angry,super-earachely & super-dull
stuff in my opinion. I  simply can't stand all this political & social stuff in
the music. The  average  song is not longer than 2 minutes over here what makes
them even duller.How can I like the songs which have only beginning & end,with-
out anythig in between? Shorter,nothing special.Blind-hate-in your-face...
 Lavatory : Jurgen Konrad/g.; Wolfgang Kretter/vox.;Christian Frenzel/g.;Roland
Reisslund/b.;Jurgen Schwinge/dr..
 Sorry,the naming of all 19 songs will take too much space...

DARK MILENNIUM "Diana Read Peace" adv.tape (Massacre Rec. MASS CD 022)
 The second full lenghth effort of  these  German  gothic gods seems to broaden
even their first album's horizons! Even the word  "metal" does not fit Dark Mi-
lennium anymore for the guys set no  boundaries  throughout their land of melo-
dies.The music is dark,technical, complex and innovative at the highest meaning
of these words.If Moon of Sorrow were something heavier,Dark Milennium are more
free for they have no boundaries called "metal". Diana Read Peace is simply new
standart in the whole music.As simply as this... One of the best CD's I've ever
reviewed...INCREDIBLE !!!

ATTIKA "When Heroes Fall" adv.tape (Massacre Rec. MASS CD 023)
 When I listened to this band for the first time (it was only now,but this alb-
um is their second effort to date,the first official one though) I realised the
enormous potential in their songwriting.And more I listened the realisation be-
came more and more clear.Attika plays music which can be described as Iron Mai-
den meets Slayer. They have maydenish song structures plus vocals and slayerish
riffs (hey,hey,I know some purists  who  will send me to hell after this state-
ment,but this is my personal  opinion  only! ). This breeding seems to be ultra
successful! I am totally into this stuff! This seems to be something really new
in thrash metal,combining powerful high pitched vocals,intense drumming and he-
avy guitar playing with incredible solos there and here.GET THIS!!!
 By the way,write for promo video of "The Shame" to: Massacre Rec./Raucheckstr.

SICKENING GORE "Destructive Reality" adv.tape (Massacre Rec. MASS CD 025)
 Death metal a la Cannibal Corpse,Incantation & thousands of others.Nothing new
nevermind original or special over here. The market is full of clones as Sicke-
ning Gore nowadays.For die hard deathheads only !!!
 By the way,this Swiss band was known as Reactor some  time  ago, so if you own
their demo "The Tribunal Above",you know already what Sickening Gore are about.
But this needs no guessing I think...

DELUSION "Autumn Dawn" demo
 Not so much different from Sickening Gore. Perhaps a little more doomy.Solos a
la Carcass 2nd LP.Nothing more exceptional here. Brutality,braincrushing vocals
and everything else you'll need to clean the shit out of your pants.Who've said
death metal demo needs something more?

MERCYFUL FATE "In the Shadows" MC (Metal Blade Rec. 45318-4)
 I've heard the news that Mercyful Fate is reborn in the summer of 1993 but did
not believe my ears until I've got THIS...The news were so exceptional I simply
CAN'T BELIEVE them ! But... The MC is finally  in my taperecorder and I am sit-
ting on the sofa getting orgasms one by one ! The EVENT is OUTSTANDING  because
of it's unique value only,not paying attention to musical side  of  the  really
incredible album.Yeah,the legend is back with the CD which can  stole the title
of "the best metal album ever released" from "MELISSA". Oooh, I don't know what
more to add.Incredible King's vocals (he "plays" less here though) , incredible
guitar solos (King's bands always were famous about that) and  dark  atmosphere
make this record so exceptional.And,hell,this IS exceptional !!! All over, from
the first single,EGYPT,to the last track,the remake of the old one , THE RETURN
OF THE VAMPIRE,it just leaves no place for any kind of  the compromise. This is
undoubtely the best Mercyful Fate has ever released. I am proud to be among the
happy ones who've heard this masterpiece...

PARADISE LOST "Icon" MC (Metal Blade Rec. 3984-14021-4)
 Frankly,I waited for this album not less than to Mercyful Fate's comeback.With
3 previous full leght releases,Paradise Lost showed all their talents in my op-
inion.I think there's no need to name all of them to you,is there? I think Icon
just continues what Paradise Lost started  in Shades of God. For me, who looked
for something new from these gods of innovative and unusual,the album seems not
so original...I dig Shades of God more with their powerful sound and eerie mel-
odies.Well,Icon has the similar sound (but vocals are abit less rawful) but not
so catchy melodies as in AS I DIE or YOUR HAND IN MINE.Yeah,in Icon you can ha-
ve a little bit of beatiful stuff (True Belief;Shallow Seasons;Christendom),but
hell,no such international hits as AS I DIE.Is this good or bad? You must judge
by yourself...

BROKEN HOPE "Bowels of Repugnance" MC (Metal Blade Rec. 3984-14018-4)
 In Broken Hope's case the second album is continuation of their  first one, as
in Paradise Lost's case the 4th continues the 3rd one...Shortly,nothing new af-
ter their debut "Swamped in Gore" on  Grindcore International. The same intense
drumming,low guitars and raw  vocals. In  the  sea of today's death metal bands
they are at least a bit unoriginal.But,fuck,the music is super extreme and bru-
tal! I think they must be killing live, I  just imagine the crowd's reaction to
their eerie tunes.For maniacs ONLY! But anyway I wonder why such albums are re-
leased on & on.Will Cannibal Corpse be the next?

ATHEIST "Elements" MC (Metal Blade Rec. 45370-4)
 Ooooooooh,boy,I don't know what to write over here...Atheist is one of my fave
bands and what they've done in their 3rd CD just left me speechless.I can't im-
agine HOW the guys can play THIS.They must be sold their souls for such talent.
I don't know is this deathrash or it isn't anymore for the music is so much br-
oader and really setting the new standarts not for  the metal only. For Atheist
are not longer just a great metal band; they're  unqestionably the great band--
-period.
 I can't praise the album enough... And I  don't imagine myself  and my musical
education without "Elements".It's a must...
 By the way,the album wasn't recorded in Morrisound or any other famous studio.
Atheist went to Gainsville (FL) where dwells a person,called Mark Pinske.Speaks
Kelly Shaefer:"He's agenius! He's a sleeper talent hiding  in Gainsville and we
were lucky enough to work with him.His knowledge far  surpasses anyone in death
metal or for that matter thrash or speed metal. He's  worked with everyone from
Bobby Brown to Alan Holdsworth".And from Frank Zappa to Steve Vai,I can add.And
this Mark is producing incredibly! GET THIS!!!!!!

JACK IN THE BOX "Rockjumping" CD-EP
 Infact, I was quite surprised getting this CD from the former (?) Red Harvest,
Norwegian thrashers #1, menager without any asking and generally when our rela-
tionship broke too long time ago for the such kind of surprises... Anyhow I got
the  promo  and  I am proud to present you perhaps the best Norwegian band with
the CD out ( I am not speaking 'bout A-ha,of course.HAHAHAHA !!! ). Jack in the
Box play kind of thrash we are familar from Nirvana,Pearl Jam or the latest Me-
tallica achievements. Mostly  it's very melodicaland pleasant kind of thrash. I
can  call it even balancing on the edge of being so commercial that there could
not be a place over here for it to be reviewed. But no, stuff  is MELODICAL and
TALENTED but not commercial in any case. Perhaps not so heavy I  want it to be,
but really impressive! Jack in the Box can become the international star if the
menager's attitude will be at least as professional as are they . And I hope it
will !
 I don't know the price,but try $10-12 to: Anders Oddsberg/ Hertud Skulesgt.6 /
0562 Oslo/Norway.
 Sorry,I don't know the line-up as well...
 "Rockjumping":Incapable(3:30);Funeral Fake(3:54);See Paris and Die(4:38); Dan-
cing with Ethel(3:50);I Wish I Was a Galaxy(4:38).

DARK STAR "Headtrip" CD (Failsafe Productions FSCD 01) 
 Frankly,I am not sure are the pages of arteFACTed for the band like this...But
I don't care,until it's real underground.Dark Star fuckin' IS. Infact it's even
MORE underground than some of the bands reviewed here (look the next review for
example) though it doesn't play any kind of metal despite the fact their flyers
speak about "minimal techno metal" (why?-Ace).It's rather "minimal techno  ver-
sion of J.M.Jarre".And again the critics speak about such bands as early Kraft-
werk,Ash Ra Temple,Guru Guru or Tangerine Dream as their main influences. Well,
they know better...For me it's simplified version of any of the electronics di-
nosaurs with the addition of alot of psychodelic "philosophy" in it. LSD is one
of the main inspirers of the  stuff I think... This could  be  released through
Dreamtime Records if it was not so simple music(k)ally.Anyway it's quite OK for
the one way ticket to trancendellica...
 And hell,I know how it is to play electronics !!!
 Running time is 52:51.

TRANCE "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" CD (World of Trance,WOT 93-0601-CD)
 And again Germany attacks us with ultra commercial approach to the heavy metal
Being called one of the three (Scorpions/Accept/Trance) Germany's top metal
bands,Trance is perhaps the most commercial sounding one of all of them.I mean
musically,for the CD is done in the "best" underground traditions.It's produced
so badly that not every underground act could accept.But,hell,this is the 7th
band's album!!! Don't they have any experience yet ?
 Anyway,the CD is quite OK...For the HM fanatics I mean...Not for me though.
 The running time is 50:41.

MANILLA ROAD "The Circus Maximus" CD (Black Dragon Rec. BDCD 053)
 One of these non-typical thrash bands,Manilla Road seems to be also one of
these who decided to broaden the horizons of the thrash producing this super
non-typical CD.The band seems to be even lighter than Scorpions of the 90'ies.
Generally,music is something like Led Zeppelin meets Haddaway.There are easy-
to-become hits ("Throne Of Blood","No Sign From Above"),heart breaking ballads
("Lux Aeterna","Forbidden Zone","She's Fading"),not so bad cuts ("No Touch")
and the really bad ones ("Spider","Hack it off")...The left ones aren't so ex-
ceptional one can remember them.Anyhow,this is quite good and original piece
middle tempered,good shaped pop rock.Is this worth your hard-earned money ?
I don't know-I've got it for free...

THE ORGANIZATION "The Organization" CD (Unsafe Unsane Rec./Metal Blade)
 I want to hope you realize that The Organization is what used to called Death
Angel some time ago and my reminding was completely useless.So...Death Angel
were one of my cult bands with their first releases,but now...Well the boys are
making music for their own fun and pleasure.I didn't find it while listening
to the heavier version of Manilla Road (watch the previous review).I believe
THEY HAD FUN,but not me though...The guys are very talented and they deserve
the right for fun.But me myself have the right not to listen,haven't I ?
 The CD is distributed by Metal Blade in the US and by Intercord in Europe,so
it must be in the shop right behind the corner of your house.

GREEN JELLY "Cereal Killer" sountrack CD
 The first experience of this incredible band for me was their incredible video
for their incredible track "Three Little Pigs".I hope everybody of you have
seen it,so there is no need to describe their musick.No way,man!!!All the traks
are so fuckin' different that one video does not represent the whole CD in any 
way.Infact,the musick is mostly hardcore & funky thrash with lotsa humour and 
fun added,but there are such tracks as,for example,"House Me Teenage Rave"which
is rather full of effects story about one man and few sluts.That song isn't 
even thrashy! And yeah,there is much more fun in this CD: Anarchy in U.K.(with 
changed lyrics),Electric Harley House (of Love)(with Metallica riffs,included 
even in the lyrics) and much more trax which can be enjoyed & enjoyed.
 Incredible !!! Running time is 41:01.

THRENODY "As the Heavens Fall" adv.tape (Massacre Rec. Mass CD 024)
 Infact,this is completely different stuff from what we've reviewed recently,
for this is death metal again.To be more correct,death/doom.Not in the veins 
of My Dying Bride,The Gathering or Chorus of Ruin.For I senced no keyboards
used in this record.But the music is mostly doomy with lotsa solos and acoustic
parts.Vocals are usually low,but not so deep as I would like to.Guitars are low
tuned too,but not pushed forward as some other bands sometimes are doing.And 
generally this recording is very well mixed.Everything could be heard over here
even the bass,what is not so common thing in death metal.
 Well worth to get,but only if you can get it for free.I can't imagine somebody
paying money for this.Sorry...

BABYLON SAD "Kyrie" adv.tape (Massacre Rec. MASS CD 026)
 And again death/doom,a new (?) trend that seems to infest the scene.I 
personally can only be happy for this fact for I always enjoyed the stuff with
synths (not overdosed though!) and other unusual for death metal gear,so....
Speaking about the music itself,it's a little bit doomer than in Threnody's 
case (look the previous review),with the really deep & growling vocals (one
of the deepest in the scene I can guess...),changing to a very normal one
(perhaps,too normal) from time to time or even spoken in one song,and very
cold & robotic sounding the left instruments.Have you ever heard the early 
Bolthrower? I mean the 2 first their CD's? If yes,you must know what I want to 
say by the word "robotic".But despite this,the CD is killer! Get fuckin' 
obssessed by it!
 By the way,this is an official re-release of Babylon Sad self financed first
CD with one song added. That self financed CD must be very valuable these 
days when everybody seem to dig Babylon Sad.

BAPHOMET "Trust" adv.tape (Massacre Rec. MASS CD 027)
 German Baphomet winned the case against the US band now called Banished 
(Peaceville Rec. - Hello,Andy!) and after the some while decided to put
together their third full lenght effort to date,Trust.The style is changed 
slightly to the HC direction,but the earlier achievements could be heard also
(the "strongest" example,in my opinion,a "Intense"),combining screamy and raw 
vocals,high pitched guitars and "samba" drumming (???).The HC and punk 
influences are existing though and the strongest in the songs - Prove & 
Attitude.I don't know why Baphomet cutted off their roots of speed/thrash/power
metal with this release... I want to hope that's one fuckin' odd experiment
of the guys.For me their best CD was Last Jesus,a previous one... If you knew 
Baphomet before,buy this CD to get dissapointed.If you knew not,buy the Last
Jesus to start your very own acquaitance to Baphomet.Trust anyway can't be 
your first album of these Germans....

SEVENCHURCH "Bleak Insight" promo for the CD (must be on Noise Intl.)
 Just 2 songs here,but what ones! Sevenchurch are continuing their 
extraordinary demo "Nefarious" (for extra details and tasty interview watch 
Thy Kingdom Come #5, $3 to my address) with this outstanding CD.Sure,I can't
speak about the whole CD having just 2 songs,but I've heard these ones aren't
the best... If this is true - Bleak Insight must be the best doom release of 
1993!!! I am nailed!!! I don't know how to express my feelings towards the 
atmosphere of the CD which is absolutely depressive,doomy and fuckin' heavy!
"Heavy?"- you may ask if already have heard Sevenchurch.. Yeah! - I can scream
as the answer! Heaviness isn't the normal one though,but something like...
unconcious...or what... To make the long story short - this must be one of the 
best releases of 1993.Just go outdoor,behing the corner and buy the fuckin' 
shit! 6 songs here,but the running time is over 70 minutes,I was told.

PROSECUTOR "From Despair to Notknown" demo
 Lithuanian band here... Perhaps the one and only in this issue (what doesn't
mean the one and only in Lithuania if you aren't aware of this fact).Very good
friends of mine,so I wouldn't tell you the bad things about their music here
(I told them already by the phone).
 Well,let's start with the general presentation of the demo.Hell,it's the best
one I've seen in Lithuanian underground! Full color cover (what was impossible
to imagine for me when I was told they plan to do it...),high quality tapes
with high quality recording (not on tape I own,so ask to check out quality 
when ordering!) and so on... Generally, presentationwise, the impression is 
excellent.
 Musicwise,it's thrashing death-doom (as their flyers say) played with all 
their skills and dedication (recording in 8 trax studio can't really express
all the skills but dedication - yes).What I really liked in Prosecutor are 
the vocals.Not deep and gargling like in most death metal bands case,but very 
simple,low and because of this really charming.The bass sound perhaps too 
overwhelming (or,in other words,the sound is "overbassed" a little),but this 
seems a natural thing for the band with one guitar.The drums,in contrast,are
a little bit low mixed.I don't know why:is this how Prosecutor wants to sound,
or is this studio fault.Generally,definitely not a shit over here! $6 to:

ATHEIST "Unquestionable Presence" MC (Metal Blade Rec. 26717-4)
 Quite old,almost classical release.I've got it upon my request from Metal
Blade (Jorge,you rule!),so anyhow I must to review it .But,hell,does it need
any reviewing? If you say yes,you are fuckin' asshole and my fuckin' newsletter

CONSPIRACY OF SILENCE selftitled demo
 Saulius,my good mate,artist,"lay outer" (he made the lay out of all our zines 
and this newsletter,by the way) and partner got this tape without any asking 
and gave me it to review.Well,I must to...Anyhow this is rather pleasant thing 
to do for the music is so good I really am proud to present you one of the best
 Belgian bands (just behind Ancient Rates and Exoto in my opinion).
 So Conspiracy of Silence (what a monicker,by the way!) are plain' thrash with 
some HC influences here and there.Well, I personally hate these HC parts and I 
think without them COS could be one of the better thrash bands I've heard this 
year.But perhaps it's quite fashionable to add grunge or HC elements to the 
music now.I don't know...What I can say without any prejustice- COS is good
band (haven't I said this yet?) and I'm looking forward for their future 
releases if they'll quit this experimenting with a sound.Must be killer stuff!!
 Sorry,I don't know the price but I think $5 should be enough for photocopied 
cover + good sounding tape (CrO2).Pass'em to : Van De Meutter Geert/Schoolstrat

MORTA SKULD "Dying Remains" CD (Deaf Rec. DEAF 11CD)
 There must be the second CD of Morta Skuld out by now,but I haven't heard from
 Peaceville for several months by now,so probably it wouldn't be reviewed here.
Sorry...
 As for the first one,I can say it,s quite common,standart death metal with the
 slight touch of doom.You'll find nothing (really nothing !!!) special over 
here even if you'll listen to the CD for the ages (I've listened for 3 months 
specially!!!).Speaking about myself - I've got tired of it...

BEWITCHED / F-UNCUNT split MC (Warmaster Rec. WAR 002)
 Bullmetal's (ex-Masacre (Col.)) label was something new for me when I've 
heard about it for the last time.And the second his release is reviewed 
below split LP/MC.Yes,released in 2 formats,it contains 2 very different, 
different to the extreme bands.
 Bewitched (it's part on the LP/CD is called "My Death For You On a Night Of 
Cursed Fullmoon") play very melodical and generally quite pleasant death/black 
with lotta solos and really cool melodies.I love this record very much though 
it has no any techno parts (which I enjoy a lot) or anything of similar 
trendiness.Enjoyable stuff anyhow!
 Bewithced:Aldo Araya/Las Mercedes 7763/La Florida,Santiago,Chile.

 "My Death...":Hibernum in Perperum;Semitarus;Souls Tears;Serene Sorrow;Tardil 
Mio Cor.
 And F (previously known as Funcunt) are really one of the most weird and 
strange underground acts compared by everyone who've listened to it by acts 
like Mekong Delta,Sieges Even or even The Residents.And,yeah,I can agree with
all comparisons with above mentioned acts.F,combining technical thrash with 
some ultra weird effects,tempo & mood changes,vocals ranging in really wide 
range made something I can call "shyzo thrash" or "shyzo metal",not meaning 
it's for mentally weak ones or created by those,but that there are parts in 
this song (by the way,F's part in the record is one song called "Pronimo") 
taken as though from the strongest albums of the Residents.Shorter - get this!
 You can get also the first or the second demo of Funcunt for $5 or blank tape 
+3 IRC's or both demos (which are great too,by the way!) for $6 or blank tape 
+4 IRC's from: Jussi,Saivo/29570 Soormarkku/Finland.Great guy,by the way!
 And the split LP (only 600 copies print!) or MC you can get from:Warmaster 
Rec./A.A.056642/Medellin/Colombia.The prices are:LP - $14(Europe,Asia,
Australia),LP - $12 (America),MC - $12 (everywhere).Includes 2 fold out 
pro-printed posters and stickers.Is this worth the price? I don't know...
I can't speak about the LP,but MC comes with white/on/black cover,with 
lyrics,band members and other usual shit.The tape itself isn't the best one 
I've ever seen (the quality not so good as one might desire from the 
professional label's production),but the music can satisfy if not everybody, 
then the most.

VICTIMS OF INTERNAL DECAY selftitled MC (Grindcore Intl. GCI 89817-4)
 I am really happy to ba able to review Grind Core International's stuff for 
you all again after some break,caused by reasons depended not on me.And the 
first thing I want to present you this time is quite impressive! Victims Of 
Internal Decay (VOID),being located just between Seatle and California 
developed a sound most critics are calling "sludge grind".I can call it 
"grunge grind" or "grunge death".Names don't mean anything.One thing that 
matters speaking about a band with CD out is the music.And the question: why 
this band got signed?So,speaking about VOID,everything is clear.Music is 
"sludge grind" and it got signed because of this music.Why I'm writing these 
nonsenses? It's because I don't know what more sensefull could be added before 
I'll mention the fact that the music is absolutely great.Well,it's death.I 
think I need not to mention this fact...But with the sound so different from 
the thousands,that not to hear the difference is possible for the deaf one 
only.Vocals reminds me Chuck in his early days,everything else more or less 
innovative and original sounding with influences ranging from Napalm Death to, 
oddly enough,Afghan Whics.Good stuff! I really mean that!
 The CD/MC is distributed by Relativity in the US and Intercord in Europe.

NAHASH "Nocticula Hecate" (?) demo
 The first Lithuanian black band in my experience.Well,not the first one in
Lithuania though,but I never have heard earlier ones.
 And Nahash represents what one can bravely call the underground in it's
most classic form: recording took place in the rehearsal place (cellar/
basement so really Under-the-Ground!) with ordinary tape recorder and one(!!!)
microphone. Despite this the result is not so bad.I can just recommend the
tape for all the blacksters.That's hot! That's blasphemious! That's dark!
That's fuckin'black!
 The demo is provided with B/W photocopied cover,lyrycs,etc... I don't
know the exact price,but $3/4 should be enough.Pass'em to: Vytas Stankus/
Traku 5-2/3000 Kaunas/Lithuania.Phone:370 7 22-30-73.
 Nahash:Vytas/g.;Munis/l.g.;Nerijus/b.;Mindaugas/dr..
 Nocticula Hecate:Eko Azarak (Lycantrophy);Norticulla Hecate;Sabalyas;Thunor.

AT THE GATES "With Fear I Kiss The Burning Darkness" CD (Deaf Rec. DEAF 14 CD)
 The band I so adored and wrote so killing review in TKC #6,surprised me with
their last release completely.If "The Red In The Sky Is Ours" is really
classical CD with more undergroundish and "techno" approach,this one fails
any comparisons.Yeah,I can see some similarities with their incredible (I
really think so!) debut,but the Sunlight recording did it's "best".On the other
 side, the sound is even rawer than on "The Red...".but that's not good for the
 listening process.But leave this up to Tomas & ATG.
 Well, if "The Red..." was really melodical CD (if you knew where melodies lay)
,this one can be quite disappointing to some of you awaiting another masterpiece
 of techno-death-black-speed metal.Infact,some songs (Raped By The Light Of
Christ,Non-Divine or The Architects) can be mentioned as "melodical",but the
rest ones are much less impressive in my opinion.I don't know why... You see,
I'm not looking for melodical stuff/pops,but I hate the music I can't find
the melody at all,even hidden under 666 seals.Music must be at least listenable
 to me.
 Generally,the stuff is worth getting for all who enjoyed ATG debut,but not
for those who want to start their own one way journey in the depths of human
suffering (I can call the music Suffering Serenades).Have a nice trip!
 At The Gates:Adders Bjorler/g.;Martin Larsson/g. (Alf Svensson in the studio);
Tomas Lindberg/vox.;Adrian Erlandsson/dr.(cool!);Jonas Bjorler/b..
 With Fear...:Beyond Good and Evil;Raped By The Light Of Christ;The Break of
Autumn;Non-Divine;Primal Breath;The Architects;Stardrowned;Blood of the Sunset;
The Burning Darkness;Ever-Opening Flower;Through The Red.
 The running time is 45:42.
