 WN> Dan..

 MX> Hmm, and were you an ok hacker? What systems do you enjoy hacking?

 WN> Yes, I was not a "bad" hacker.. I was hacking only boards with stupid
 WN> sysops.. These guys who try to.. hmm.. (I'm not very good in english
 WN> hehehee).. to shit on other people hehehehe
 [ Well people who shit on other people usually have a sexual disorder. I
   don't think that's what he wanted to say. But that's crashing, no? ]

 MX> That's not hacking, that's crashing.

 WN> .No.. I was hacking some boards.. There wass a war anywayss.

 MX> ok, later

 WN> later?
 [ Obviously an explanation is needed, as his little hacker brain cannot
   comprehend that I wanted to get the hell out of there. ]

 MX> bye

 WN> why?

 MX> Well you want to keep chatting?

 WN> hehehe.. hmmmmmmmm.... well, texas.. hmmmmmmmmmmm..where is it?
 WN> fsd;kihuafdio;uhfd;akhu i forgot....%$#
 [ Dug, goonygoogoo, blah hmmmpf, grr. White Ninja dialect. ]


 MX> Texas. Area code 713. Houston to be exact
 [ Well you have to lie a little to get your point accross. ]

 WN> Hmm yeah.. did you ever go in quebec?

 MX> Hmm, canada? No never

 WN> Heheh yes.. I'm french.. but I speak english a little.. (I go in florida
 WN> each year...hehee)

 MX> Yes, FL, not bad. Anyways, so this 514 ac is in canada right?

 WN> Yep... Quebec.. hehee... Canada...
 [ Hehee, hahaa, hoho... A little to much beer maybe? ]

 MX> Ok, well are there many good h/p boards in this ac, I mean, are there a
 MX> a lot of boards worth calling?

 WN> Hmmmmmmmmmm.....only h/p?

 MX> Well anything, but as long as it has *some* h/p, since I don't do warez.

 WN> Hmm... yeah. but I'm not in h/p anymore... I don't like this.. anyways...
 WN> I have been bbsing for about 6-7 years.. and I'm tired to be "stressed"
 WN> with all those fuck%*& things.. hehe.. when you phreak, you never know
 WN> when they'll decide to retrace you and catch you..

 MX> Hmm, I don't think so. I don't know anyone getting busted for *only* pbx
 MX> abuse. Anyways, would you have names/numbers to some 514 (or other) good
 MX> boards?

 WN> Hmm not really hehhe.. I don't know.. II can't remeber, since I run my
 WN> baord, I don't call bbses.. I'm programming also... it takes a lot of my
 WN> time... and then, I just finished my new cbv .. hehe!.. By the way, in
 WN> Quebec, there's a lot OF PEOPLE that possess a Call Retracer.. in our
 WN> home.. and imagine what kind of retracer the companies can use if we
 WN> have our own in our house hehehe. anyways..
 [ Yes, ok, take a valium. People get so nevous when under pressure. ]

 MX> Well we have clid here to. Anyways, I'll check the board out. See ya

 WN> Hmmmm....ok.. I'll let you go now.. But I'll need the computer in about
 WN> 10-15 minutes... ok?

 MX> ok, bye

 WN> bye

   Guys,I am looking for information on those jerks,NuKE.I ain't a       
   cop or anything,i am just part of a newly formed "vigalante"          
   Corrupt Computer Underground Task Force.Their are to many stupid      
   people around who,if they keep things up will get the whole           
   Network Shut down.We are mainly going after Virus developers,         
   Phreakers,Carders and Hackers.The Pirates we leave alone,so long      
   as they don't Phreak.No doubt you guys have heard about The           
   Notso Humble Babe and The Grim Reaper being nailed by the FBI.        
   Those jerks were caught only because they were Phreaking. Of          
   course they sang like canaries,and it's no wonder that 95 % of        
   the WAREZ are coming out of Europe.They pretty much destroyed,        
   although temporarily, the North American Underground. I have          
   been assigned Montreal and Toronto by the FAT CAT. We are looking     
   to give NuKE a taste of their own medicine. Let's just say there      
   is a Worm waiting for RockSteady. I know Phrozen Virus logs on
   Devil's D. But i need to get on the inside.Any tips will be much      
   appreciated.
