         This issue of HDK is a little different than the previous three. The
    HDK04.ZIP package should contain the following files:

    [1] - README.1ST  : This file
    [2] - HDK04.TXT   : HiPPie DiPPy KluB Issue #4
    [3] - 514CU.TXT   : HDK submission #1 - Mechanix
    [4] - FOGNEWSL.001: Read this after HDK04.TXT, it will be funnier
    [5] - HITS.TXT    : A last minute addition - Mechanix

    HDK will, from now on, consist of two distinct parts:

    [1] - The original "joke" HiPPie DiPPy KluB file, written by Mechanix,
          with help from various other people, with the same "Flipper" format
          it has always had.
    [2] - Individual submissions. These texts will be printed in there
          original format, whatever that may be. I, Mechanix, do no editing on
          these, and the text is left entirely to the discretion of the
          author.

    Submissions:
         HDK has evolved from a senseless joke file to a point where it seems
    to be the only worthwhile echo of the 514 computer underground. Others
    have tried, but up to now, HDK has had the most issues and positive
    response. This does not include the various group magazines/newsletters
    that deal on specific themes (hacking, phreaking, pirating), but on texts
    devoted only to the 514 area code. It will now be used as a mouthpiece for
    anyone from 514 wanting to get an idea across. I will print anything that
    has a minimum of quality. I will not accept senseless rags (except as to
    be included in HDK) unless they are based on truth or facts. So, if you
    want something to be printed in the next issue of HDK, follow the
    guidelines below:

    [1] - Format your text in 78 columns (as this one).
    [2] - Do not use any system specific characters (ie: anything that is not
          on your keyboard) like extended ascii.
    [3] - On the first line of the file, include your handle, and a place to
          reach you easily (voice, board...). If you leave your voice, include
          your first name. If you leave a board number, make sure to include
          all I need to get an account (NUP). I do not accept anonymous
          submissions. If I don't know who you are, it will not get printed.
    [4] - Signing the text is NOT necessary if you do not wish to, but once
          again, I will not publish anything that is stupid and without merit.
    [5] - Compress your file in a ZIP, name it as HDKxxxxx.ZIP, where xxxxx is
          an abreviation of your handle (ie: Mechanix -> HDKMECH.ZIP).
    [6] - Log on to TPR at 514/738+2105.
    [7] - Hit '.' to set up for full line input.
    [8] - Type in 'hdksub'. This is a hidden command, so don't start browsing
          the help for the command name.
    [8] - Use the account name 'HDK', password 'SUBMIT'.
    [9] - Upload your file with a proper description.
    [10]- After the transfer, type 'logoff' to disconnect.

    Don't try to login with that account, it has no access, and will not even
    get you the system password.

    I will look over the file, and give you an answer in the following days.

    You get FULL credit for the file if it is accepted, otherwise, you won't
    hear from me again.

    Also, TPR is now a distribution site for the text-file group VAS. This
    means that TPR has all (over 80) issues of VAS, and we get them first. It
    also means that you may submit articles as described above, but please
    indicate that they are for VAS and not HDK releases.
