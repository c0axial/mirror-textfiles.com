    Well, I  had this issue  all set to  go out before  Christmas, and
then Yale went  down for vacation. Sigh. Well, I  guess late is better
than never.  In this issue we  continue with both the  Acquisition and
the Narret Chronicles,  thanks to Mari's staying up until  3am to type
it in. I hope  you enjoy them. There will be one  more issue in Volume
3,  which will  follow on  the heels  of this  issue, before  we start
Volume 4  and the Dargon writing  project. By the way,  I've rewritten
the  FSFnet sending  program again.  Anyone  who wants  to change  the
program I  use to  send their  issues please mail  me. You  may choose
from:  DISK DUMP  (class N),  PUNCH (noheader  class m),  and SENDFILE
(netdata). If anyone is really into CARD DUMP, I'll even use that!
    For those of  you who haven't heard, and didn't  notice, FSFnet is
being sent out from  a new id - CSDAVE at MAINE. Due  to the work I do
on CSNEWS, NMCS025  has been changed to CSDAVE.  FSFnets will continue
coming  out,  but  from  CSDAVE.  NMCS025  is  no  longer  in  the  CP
directory, so  please forward  any mail or  messages to  either CSDAVE
or LISCOMB at MAINE.
    Finally, just  when you thought  it was  safe to write  a Thieves'
World  review, TW  8  has  just been  released.  More  details (and  a
review) as soon as possible!

                         The Narret Chronicles
                             Book the Third
    "Dr. Ht  this is Dr. Terrence  Seni of the Armed  Forces Institute
of Pathology  at Sir Walter Reed  Medical Center, and Dr.  Adam Tristy
of  the American  College of  Surgeons.  They will  be examining  you,
with your permission of course."
    "Surely." said Samo
    "Dr Seni  is the nation's foremost pathologist, and Dr.  Tristy is
one our most prominent bio-physicists."
    "Really, well  this is quite  a reception... Pleased to  meet both
of  you gentlemen.  You can  examine me  if you  wish, but  I'd rather
provide you with  the data myself. You see, I  have all the  pertinent
information on  our physiology stored on  tape in my craft. Allow me a
moment  will you  and I'll  be  back with  the  data you  wish for  in
several of your languages.
    "Here you are,  'Yarg's  Complete Physiology  of  the Narretan'  a
Narret classic  physiology text. The  best ever produced!  That should
answer  all your  questions concerning  our physiology,  but I'll  bet
you still  want to know  about my  AND molecular structure.  That I'll
leave up to you."
    "Could we  take a small blood  sample to help us  study the makeup
of  your  circulatory,  respiratory, lymphatic,  and  immune  systems?
Such a sample  would provide us with the AND  molecular structure data
we also desire." asked Dr. Seni.
    "Sure." said  Samo "I'd be glad  to help in  any way I can.  I'm a
scientist myself.  I was only  kidding when I  said I hate  needles. I
was just trying to get a laugh."
    "Make  a  fist,"  said  Seni as he searched  Samo's  arm's  densly
packed molecules for a vein. "This may pinch a little."
    "No  sweat,"  said  Samo.  "What  you  gentlemen  will  really  be
interested in  though, is  the fact that  in the  counter-universe, we
are not solid creatures at all, as you know it."
    "Really?" queried Tristy as he took notes.
    "Yes, really."  said Samo.  "At home,  on Amrif  Arret, we  are by
our  own nature  of  a  gaseous form.  As  your  molecular forces  are
attractive  here,  ours are  repulsive,  thus,  we are  all  perfectly
non-solid, as opposed to your solidity."
    "How extraordinarily fascinating!" exclaimed Tristy.
    "In fact all  our worlds, stars, everything is  unbound but space,
which is the  solid through which we  all pass. That is why  I can get
here  so much  faster in  our system  of time,  our entire  concept of
time  is  based  on  density  of our  solid  space,  rather  than  the
vacuousness of yours. It  is far easier, I assure you, for a plasma to
pass through a solid than a solid to pass through a vacuum."
    "Ahh, I  got all  but that  last bit  then I  lost you,  could you
clarify the part about easier..." started Dr. Tristy.
    "Surely,"  Samo interrupted  "You see,  when we  pass through  the
solid  form of  our space,  we use  the actual  binding forces  of the
particles  in  motion   of  the  spatial-solid  in   order  to  propel
ourselves.  Thus  we  can  utilize  the very  nature  of  our  'space'
itself, as  a means, or  force of  propulsion. Do you  understand that
better, doctor?"
    "Much better, thank you. I must say this is all quite astounding.."
    "Not  at all,  simply the  state of  nature doctor.  Which reminds
me, I  wish to  make a statement  on the wisdom  of our  physicians in
the Narret  System. If you  would be so kind  as to record  it doctor,
I'm sure all of humanity will find it of great use."
    "Surely, any advice  you can give would be held  in highest regard
by our scientific communities." said Dr. Tristy
    "It  came to  pass, through  the thousands  of Losar  Cycles (what
you call  years) of our  existence, that  our physicians began  to use
the fundamental laws  of nature in their favor. Rather  than fight the
immune  system  for example,  they  found  ways of  strengthening  it,
bolstering  its abilities.  Cancer, as  another example  was found  to
contain  cells of  a  much  stronger variety  than  those  said to  be
normal. What  our physicians did was  to retrain the immune  system to
work on  the AND  structure within  the Cancerous  cells, so  that the
dominant  Cancer cells  were effectively  "programmed" to  conduct the
function  of  the  tissue  it   replaced.   And  this  new,  Cancerous
super-cell  was  stronger  and  better   than  the  original  cell  it
replaced, because  it lives  longer and is  less  suceptable  to other
diseases. Therefore  your physicians  should also  learn to  work with
and not against nature."
    "Thats absolutely  astounding. You've  just helped us  realize how
far we've  set back Cancer research  in the last 50  years. We've been
trying  to eradicate  it  for  so long  we  completely overlooked  the
possibility of trying to turn it into something useful. Incredible!"
    "I see you're rather enthused at the prospect." said Samo.
    "Enthused? I'm  simply overjoyed  at the possibility  that there's
a cure  for our  worst killer.  Cancer claims  millions of  lives here
each year."
    "Yes, I know..." stated Samo.
    "Dr Ht.  you have no  idea how  much just that  little information
you just  shared with  us means,  how many  millions of  peoples lives
this few  minutes you've shared  with us  will save. Mankind  shall be
forever in your debt."
    "Oh, I think  I do." said Samo "Remember,  peace and understanding
throughout these  universes is  what I  came here  for. And  sharing a
little scientific knowledge  in the process is the least  I can do. If
you gentlemen will  excuse me, I see  the colonel at the  door. I have
another  speech to  give,  and I  hope if  everything  goes well,  you
gentlemen may get a little more time to work on your medical problems."

                            The Acquisition
                                The Hut
    In the morning,  bright and early, Banewood and Sod  were woken by
the sound of  little marching feet. A troop of  gaily dressed Ludki in
tall, feathered hats approached them.
    "Hey Hyssop!  Hey Burdock!"  shouted Stickleburr  as he  clapped his
hands.  Immediately,  two  little   people  ran  forward.  Stickleburr
addressed Banewood and Sod.
    "Good  morning,  unless it's  already  mid-day.  My two  sons  and
myself  will accompany  you to  the borders  of our  realm unless  you
don't wish to be accompanied. First, though, you must have breakfast."
    Stickleburr clapped  his hands again and  several Ludki approached
with steaming  plates of food.  The travelers ate with  relish, though
there wasn't  any. From a nearby  keg they filled their  flasks with a
light mead and they were ready to depart.
    Banewood and  Sod followed  the Ludki as  they marched  off, their
pace marked by  the rhythm of the Ludki's singing.  Hyssop and Burdock
marched ahead while  Stickleburr walked and chatted  with Banewood and
Sod. He told them  about the paths ahead and how  they must not stray,
lest they tread paths  unknown. He told them to be  on their guard for
the Silvan Lord,  for these were his woods. The  Silvan Lord, or Lessy
as he  was better known, would  lead them astray with  his lies. Lessy
was  a liar  at  heart and  he delighted  in  deluding the  hopelessly
lost. He  would draw them  to one point and  then to another,  then to
another and  yet another.  However, there was  one way  of outsmarting
the  Lessy. It  was a  method  known only  to  the Ludki,  and it  was
Stickleburr's parting gift to the travelers.
    "Lessy  is a  liar,"  said  Stickleburr, "for  he  can't tell  the
truth. To  get to  the truth, if  it's lies you  don't want,  you must
wear  your  clothes  inside-out   or  outside-in  if  they're  already
inside-out. Your shoes  you must wear on the opposite  feet unless, of
course, your feet are already opposite.  Then you just wear  your feet
opposite."
    Banewood and Sod laughed aloud at Stickleburr's foolish words.
    "It  is  worthy of  a  children's  rhyme  even though  it  doesn't
rhyme," Banewood said.
    They all laughed again at the strange paradox of Ludki speech.
    After their  having walked away the  longest part of the  day, and
after their  having heard innumerable anecdotes  from Stickleburr, the
two  travelers  parted  company  with  the  Ludki.  Banewood  and  Sod
marched on  at a much faster  pace, since they needn't  keep time with
the short-legged  Ludki. Once  again, the  brightness of  sunlight and
companionship  dimmed   as  the   travelers  departed  the   realm  of
civilization. The  dark forest  seemed darker  without the  chatter of
the little people.
    A  dark,  sinuous path  pointed  out  by  Stickleburr led  in  the
direction of  the setting sun. The  roots of gnarled oaks  lay twisted
across the  path, occasionally catching  the carefully placed  feet of
the  plowman. Spider  webs built  across  the gaps  of branches  often
ended up  in the faces of  Banewood and Sod, tickling  their noses and
generally making  their way unpleasant.  Pale mushrooms of  the deadly
varieties  could  sometimes be  seen  lining  the  edge of  the  path.
Strange animal sounds echoed through the trees.
    After  hours of  walking,  the  travelers still  had  not found  a
resting place  suitable for a  night's encampment. Though the  sun was
possibly  an hour  away  from setting,  the way  had  become dark  and
difficult  to  navigate  because  of the  forest  canopy.  At  length,
Banewood and  Sod stopped to  decide which  way the path  was supposed
to lead. The forest  seemed more alive at this dusky  hour than it had
earlier  in  the day.  Birds  chirped  and strange  animals  chattered
beyond the distant trees.
    "I don't  know," said Sod,  "maybe we  should stop right  here and
wait  until morning.  I just  can't be  sure of  keeping on  the right
path if we go on."
    "Oh,  don't worry,  I'll show  you  the way  to go  from here,"  a
strange voice answered.
    Banewood  and Sod  quickly  drew their  weapons  and stood  ready.
Wolksmert glowed  reddish from  the light of  the evening  sun. Before
them stood an  eerie sight. A greenish man, or  something resembling a
man, though  much taller, stood  a dozen  paces before them.  His eyes
had  an  orange, malevolent  glow.  They  appeared cat-like.  Banewood
feared  the  worst,  for  to his  inexperienced  knowledge,  the  eyes
reminded  him of  Baba  Yaga's.  The apparition  was  dressed in  what
appeared to be leaves. A bird nest was perched upon the shoulder.
    Sod felt  the hilt of his  sword slide through the  sweaty grip of
his fingers.  His hand clenched  Wolksmert tighter. He  wondered about
what  action he  should take.  Quickly, he  decided that  it would  be
safest to let the creature make the first move.
    The  green figure  stood before  them  and made  a chirping  sound
like  a  bird.  He  clapped  his  hands and  then  smiled.  It  was  a
friendly, disarming smile.
    "Take the  path straight  ahead until  you come  to a  fork," said
the strange  apparition. "Then, bear  left until  you come to  a large
boulder  and proceed  to your  right until  you come  to an  old tree.
>From the  tree, go  left until  you meet  the next  tree, then  take a
sharp right to the first stream. You can't miss it."
    "Uh,  excuse  us for  a  moment,  if  you please,  sir."  Banewood
tugged at Sod's shoulder and pulled him away.
    "Oh  yes,  most  certainly,  yes, yes."  The  green  man  laughed,
clapped his hands and chattered like a tree rat.
    "What's  the  matter?  Who's  that?  What  are  we  doing?"  Sod's
questions came quickly and nervously.
    "Shhhh!" hissed Banewood  as he led Sod out of  sight of the green
man. When  they were safely  out of  sight, Banewood said,  "That must
be Lessy,  the Silvan  Lord. Stickleburr warned  us of  him. Remember,
he'll lie to get us lost. Let's hurry and turn our clothes inside out."
    As quickly  as they could,  Banewood and Sod pulled  their clothes
off  and reversed  them. They  turned the  insides outside  and helped
each  other button-up  from the  back. They  did the  same with  their
britches.  Then,  they   pulled  off  their  boots   and  placed  them
opposite: left  boot on right foot  and right boot on  left foot. When
they had  finished, they smiled  sheepishly and stepped back  out into
the open. Lessy was patiently waiting, whistling to himself and smiling.
    When  the Silvan  Lord  saw  how Banewood  and  Sod appeared,  his
orange eyes opened wide and  bulged.  He stood stiff with  his fingers
out-stretched.
    "Eeaarrgh! Owwww!"  Screamed Lessy.  He jumped around  and emitted
more strange sounds.
    Sod stood nonplussed, unable to move during the exhibition.
    Banewood  took the  initiative and  said aloud:  "Tell us,  Silvan
Lord, which is the way to the hut of Baba Yaga."
    "Eeaarrgh! Owwww! I'll  talk, I'll tell you the  truth, I promise!
I'll tell you anything, but pulleese! Straighten-out your clothes!"
    Banewood and  Sod felt sorry  for the Silvan Lord.  Evidently, the
truth was  so foreign to  Lessy that  it caused him  great discomfort.
When Banewood and  Sod had put their clothes  back on outside-outside,
they  returned  to Lessy.  The  Silvan  Lord  was now  docile,  almost
subdued; he was saddened by his loss of victims to his trickery.
    "Yes, most  certainly," said Lessy,  "I will  show you the  way to
Baba Yaga's hut. Yes, then you'll wish you were lost! Follow me."
Banewood and Sod walked behind Lessy as he led them through the dark
forest night.
    Since  they had  first  met  the Silvan  Lord,  the  sun had  set,
changing  the long  shadows to  a solid  smear of  blackness. The  two
travelers were both  stabbed by the sharp pang of  doubt as to whether
Lessy  could be  held  to his  word. Whatever  the  status of  Lessy's
honor, Banewood and  Sod realized that they were both  in the hands of
the Lord of the Forest.
    Lessy strode  before them, mumbling  to himself and  emitting more
strange sounds. More  than once, Banewood and Sod had  tripped on tree
roots and stumbled  to the ground. Low branches snapped  back by Lessy
often caught Sod  in the face and chest, leaving  him sore and scored.
The long hours of night were unbearably drawn out in this manner.
    When the slender  rays of first morning light  pierced through the
trees,  the  three travelers  found  themselves  on  the edge  of  the
forest.  Sod  felt   a  heaviness  in  his  stomach   when  the  first
realization  of  their  plight  hit  him: How  were  they  to  return?
Neither of them had thought of marking their way.
    Lessy  turned to  face the  exhausted travelers.  The faint  light
barely illuminated his  gnarled and worn face. Banewood  and Sod could
only  concentrate   on  the   eyes--  those  strange   cat-like  slits
surrounded by an orange glow.
    "Here is where  I'll leave you," said Lessy. "The  rest of the way
is  before you.  You'll  probably  reach the  hut  by mid-day."  Lessy
chuckled as  he pointed to  the path before  them. As quickly  as when
they  had  found him,  the  Silvan  Lord  disappeared into  the  green
growth of the forest.
    The path  lay before them. Banewood  and Sod stood on  the edge of
the dark  forest and  before a  vast expanse  of scrub.  Sod preferred
the darkness  of the forest  to what he now  saw: a thin  path leading
through  a  tangle  of  long-thorned   trees  which  were  so  closely
interwoven that they seemed inpenetrable.
    "Why don't you try Wolksmert on those branches," offered Banewood.
    Sod drew his  sword and swung lightly against the  tangle that lay
before him.  Sod was glad  for the chance to  draw his sword  and test
its edge. The massive, thorny growth fell to their feet.
    "Only Kathryn  could walk a path  like this," commented Sod  as he
continued to slice  his way through. "These branches are  so sharp and
tightly  interwoven that  only the  sow could  manage to  walk through
unscathed."
    The  plowman  and the  Shaman,  however,  could not  pass  through
unharmed. Even though  the path was partially cleared  by Sod's sword,
some branches  remained to tear  at their clothing and  puncture their
skin.  Punished and  brutalized  by  the last  leg  of their  journey,
Banewood and  Sod proceeded slowly,  their hearts heavy with  fear and
anticipation. By  noon, they had  passed through the forest  of thorns
and had entered  into a wide perimeter of tall  grasses and occasional
trees. Banewood sniffed the air and winced.
    "Look," he  said, pointing to a  large copse of assorted  and vile
smelling weeds. "This must have once been Baba Yaga's herb garden."
    The  expanse  of  foul-smelling  weeds grew  unbounded.  They  had
probably  been untended  for many  decades, but  they still  held firm
against  the  encroaching  forest  and field.  One  fell  weed  pitted
itself  against the  other  for dominance  of space.  It  was an  evil
looking  tangle. Banewood  hoped  he  could return  by  this path  and
gather  some of  the herbs.  A  few were  familiar to  him; they  were
shaman's  herbs.  Some  plants   had  divinatory  purposes,  some  had
medicinal  uses.  Other  plants  were total  strangers  to  Banewood's
herbal. These were the most curious to the novice.
    Reluctantly,  the  two pressed  on.  Because  of the  tall  grass,
Banewood and  Sod didn't see the  hut until they were  almost in front
of it.  The hut of Baba  Yaga loomed dark before  them. Centuries old,
the  hut was  partially  collapsed at  one end;  it  appeared like  an
apparition,  grayish  and  fragile.  The   grass  about  the  hut  was
trampled-- signs of  a current inhabitant. Banewood was  shaken by the
sight; it  was an eerie  recollection of his divinatory  dreams, minus
the malevolent red  eyes. Sod sensed the nervousness  of his companion
and  gripped  Wolksmert tightly.  He  glanced  over his  shoulder  and
searched  around them.  The  scene was  quiet. Not  even  a bird  song
could be  heard. Sod turned and  shook his companion's hand.  It was a
farewell  to their  past and  an initiation  to whatever  would befall
them in the moments ahead.
    Banewood and  Sod resolutely approached  the hut. It  looked weak,
but it  stood in evidence  of craftsmanship from a  forgotten century.
Patches of  straw, now  grayish, were  still attached  to the  roof. A
few strange  weeds had taken residence  on the roof in  order to catch
extra light. On the  roof's peak perched a dark bird.  It was a raven.
It  waddled about  and croaked  a few  times, picked  at the  wood and
then silently winged out of sight.
    Sod held  out Wolksmert and  walked toward the dimly  lit entrance
of the ramshackle  hut. Fat spiders retreated to the  shadows with the
approach  of the  plowman. Sod's  heart quickened  and his  whole body
started to  tremble slightly.  He placed his  feet carefully  to avoid
making any  sounds. With  Banewood close behind,  Sod craned  his neck
through the  doorway. It  took an  agonizing instant  for his  eyes to
grow accustomed to  the dim light. Was there something  inside? Had it
heard them  coming? Where is  it? Nothing stirred within.  Lying among
the cloven  tracks and  defacation, however, was  a flattened  pile of
leaves--  Kathryn's  bed.  The  stench   from  inside  made  Sod  gag.
Confirming their  worst fears, it  seemed that Kathryn,  the monstrous
sow which  had rampaged through  Gorod, was now  living in the  hut of
Baba Yaga.  Signs of the  monstrous  sow were everywhere. Most  of the
hut's interior  was badly  battered and  decayed. Scattered  debris on
the ground may  have once stood for a chair.  Few furnishings remained
distinguishable. In  the far corner,  though, near the bed  of leaves,
stood a  dark and  mouldering chest.  The brass  straps and  brads had
long  since   turned  green  and  disintegrated   from  the  moisture.
Banewood  saw the  chest  and  could not  restrain  his curiosity.  He
entered  the hut  and opened  the chest.  Most of  the wood  was badly
decayed, and  it fell apart when  it was disturbed. Inside  the chest,
however, the  contents were fairly well  preserved. Banewood unwrapped
a  book-sized,  oilskin-covered  bundle  which was  on  top  of  other
items. It was a book.
    "I don't believe this," whispered Banewood in awe.
    "Don't  believe  what,"  said  Sod, not  believing  that  Banewood
dared to utter a sound in the lair of Kathryn.
    "It looks like  Baba Yaga's book of spells. I  can't make out some
of the writing;  it's an old script.  This is one of the  books my old
master  told me  about. It  contains the  ancient secrets  of sorcery.
This is an unbelievable discovery."
    "Well, pack  up your  discovery and  let's get  out of  here. This
place makes  me nervous," said  Sod. His hands  began to sweat  and he
could feel the weight of his sword sliding through.
    Banewood hastily  rewrapped the  package and  stuffed it  into his
own sack.  On an  impulse, he  picked up  another small  bundle, which
upon  inspection,   contained  what  looked  like   a  Shaman's  smoke
mixture. Banewood  lashed the sack to  his belt and the  two retreated
back into the daylight.
    When  Banewood  and  Sod  stepped   outside,  they  saw  that  the
scraggly raven  had returned.  Seeing the  plowman and  his companion,
it  cried out  in a  raucous frenzy.  Through the  cacophony, Sod  and
Banewood  heard another  sound: a  terrifying squealing  and trampling
sound. Towering  above the  distant grass was  a massive  black shape.
Thin, gray hair  lay matted on its back and  around it's notched ears.
It was a  wonder that such a large beast  could have existed unnoticed
for so  many years,  but it  is true: The  forest hides  many secrets.
Clouds  and  fumes  emanated  from around  the  creature's  snout.  It
reared its head  up and Banewood and  Sod could see a  pair of blazing
red eyes.
    "It's Kathryn," thought Sod.
    "It's Baba Yaga," thought Banewood.
    "We're in trouble," said the two aloud.
    Sod was  possessed by a grave  doubt as to his  future being. This
whole  scene was  a nightmare  and he  wished he  could wake  up. What
finally woke Sod up  was the one thing which he  had most feared. Like
a fish,  Wolksmert's handle  slid through the  gripped fingers  of the
plowman and fell to  the ground. When Sod reached to  pick it back up,
it  immediately  slid out  of  his  grasp.  Kathryn was  charging  and
spewing  her  fiery  froth.  Banewood  loosed a  Ludki  arrow  at  the
charging Kathryn,  but it glanced off  of the sow's forehead.  Sod was
distraught, to say the least. His sword would not remain in his hand.
    Banewood,  seeing Sod's  plight, ran  forward and  shouted at  the
charging  Kathryn. A  spray of  singeing  fire told  Banewood that  he
succeeded  in getting  her  attention. He  ran around  the  hut in  an
attempt  to lead  Kathryn away  from Sod,  who was  still pathetically
trying  to grip  his  sword.  A bit  of  Kathryn's  breath caught  the
corner  of  Baba Yaga's  hut  and  ignited the  tinder-dry  structure.
Evidently,  however,  Kathryn's  fiery  froth  had  a  limit,  for  it
quickly  decreased in  range and  intensity to  the point  of being  a
caustic dribble.  Banewood took  advantage of  this and  became bolder
in his  taunts. He  loosed a few  Ludki arrows at  the enraged  sow in
order to  further torment her. It  worked. Banewood saw a  nearby tree
that  he thought  could hold  his weight.  He ran  to it  and limberly
pulled  himself  up  the  trunk.   He  had  previously  discarded  his
backpack and other  paraphernalia, but he neglected to  untie the tiny
old bag  which held  the ancient  smoking mixture.  It ripped  open as
Banewood shinned up  the trunk, spilling its contents  around the base
of the tree.
    Kathryn was  not an ignorant  sow. She saw this  grand opportunity
to harvest  the tree's single  fruit: Banewood. She ran  headlong into
the sturdy  trunk of the  tree and splintered  part of the  trunk. She
tore  at the  ground around  the tree  with her  hooves and  layed her
forehead against  the trunk in an  attempt to batter it  down. Kathryn
kicked up a  cloud of the ancient herbal mixture  torn from Banewood's
belt. Her two  wide nostrils inhaled part of the  cloud and Kathryn no
longer felt  any pain.  Hitting the  tree with her  head was  easy; in
fact, it was fun.
    Sod saw  the impending danger that  Banewood was in. It  was Sod's
fault,  he  thought, that  Banewood  even  came  on this  journey.  He
couldn't let him  die. Sod had decided  to go into this  quest, and by
his life,  he would  take it to  its completion. He  picked up  a rock
and  threw it  squarely at  Kathryn's rear.  Kathryn turned  about and
faced Sod.  He taunted her with  insults to her genealogy.  Sod hardly
noticed  that  he now  gripped  Wolksmert  firmly  in both  hands.  He
spaced his legs, hurled another insult and waited.
    The smoking mixture  continued to work on Kathryn's  brain. It had
a strange,  numbing sensation. Colors  burst before her  crimson eyes.
Directly in  front of her stood  a tattered and sweaty  plowman-- easy
prey  and a  quick  lunch.  Suddenly, though,  she  was  faced by  two
plowman--  no problem--  then a  third. Three  Sod's stood  before the
eyes  of  an  enraged  and   disoriented  sow.  Baba  Yaga's  mixture,
whatever  it was,  buzzed around  in Kathryn's  head like  a swarm  of
happy bees. Kathryn  decided that the plowman on the  left, Sod number
three, was  the real one.  It didn't  really matter; she  could always
come back  and finish off the  other two. She charged  with full fury.
Distance  between  the two  retreated  with  the sound  of  thundering
cloven hooves.  Sod number two,  the one  in the middle,  didn't quite
understand why Kathryn  was veering so much to his  right. No matter--
Wolksmert, guided  by the  plowman's strong arm,  swung with  the ease
of a baton but crashed with the weight of a boulder.
    Blood poured from  Kathryn's head. Blood ran to the  ground in red
rivers and stained  the dusty feet of the plowman.  Blood dripped from
the shining blade of Wolksmert.
    Kathryn was dead.
    It  was several  minutes before  either Sod  or Banewood  moved or
said anything.  Sod stood alone with  his sword dripping blood  to the
ground. Banewood shouted from the tree.
    "You killed her. I can't believe that it happened so quickly."
    "Quickly?" Sod thought hours passed during Kathryn's charge.
    "I owe you my life," said Banewood. "How can I ever repay you?"
    "Don't worry,"  said Sod, who smiled  for the first time.  "It all
comes out in the wash."
    Without having  to discuss  their next step.  The two  quietly and
deliberately set  about gathering  dried brush and  grass for  a fire.
It took  nearly an hour  to amass the giant  pyre, but it  was finally
built  and  easily   set  aflame  from  the  embers   of  Baba  Yaga's
smoldering hut. The  evening light was brightened by  the burning pile
of brush.  A night bird  sang vespers,  and the wind  whispered softly
over the plains, gently fanning the blaze.
