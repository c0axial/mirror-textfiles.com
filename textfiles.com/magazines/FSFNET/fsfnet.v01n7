   Well,  I must keep this introduction short.    Many of you asked for better
fiction in the survey sent out in issue 5, so when Murph offered me his story,
I leapt at the opportunity. Unfortunately, it is a little long for FSFnet, and
will span two issues.   Having been pleased with it myself, I am sure you will
enjoy it.   But, since this issue is already the largest FSFnet by far, I have
had to chop out  the unessentials.   So let me end this  editorial and let you
move along...

                            The Narret Chronicles
                               Book the Eighth
   There wasn't much ceremony.   Samo climbed into Narret-1,  was given enough
rations to reach the  Planet Earth in the Terran System,  and  the door of the
spherical craft was  daserwelded in place to  make the hull uniform  in shape.
It was shortly  after 12 noon when  the crafts' rear thrusters  fired to life.
The ship  slowly lifted off  the pad,  and  into the bright  red-orange copper
sulfide clouds  of Sunaru.   Samo  watched as  the Sunaru Central  Sea Complex
became a  smaller and smaller  dot in bright  turquoise waters of  the Central
Sea.
   He piloted the  craft through the Trixi  Division and tested her  out.   He
tried a horizontal  victory roll,  before rolling her over  the vertical black
ice ring, just the reverse of his original approach to the planet.
   Samo sat back in his chair.  The craft responded well enough. Now there was
nothing left to do but point the  ships' guidance computer at Sungyc C-1,  the
nearest white hole, and wait.
   "...The Class  Omega-Alpha:Alpha-Omega security  level passes  were created
for use by those concerned with my first visit to Earth.  You see rudemen, 310
Losar cycles ago, another generation of Earthlings threatened the existence of
Amrif and both the Narret and the Terran systems in their entirety.   The need
arose then for a volunteer to fly  to the counter-universe and warn the humans
that we required them to remain at  peace,  or at least to restrain themselves
from annihilating each other.    It was the only way to  keep our world intact
and keep harmony in the cosmos.
   So  you  see  rudemen,   I'm  actually more  than  300  Losar  cycles  new.
Chronologically,  that is.   Biologically,  I'm only 42 Losar cycles new.   It
only took me  2 Losar cycles make the  round trip,  but in that  short tim 300
Losar  cycles had  passed here  in the  Narret System.    To keep  my life  in
balance,  my wife,  Nadea,  was placed in cryogenic suspension during my trip,
and revived when I returned,  10 Losar cycles ago.   Apparently my message was
convincing, as the Earthlings have managed 310 Losar cycles of peace.
   Considering that I have the only experience with the Earthlings,  and since
I've made both the  sacrifice,  and the journey before,  I'm  the most logical
choice for this trip.   I believe that's why Commander Valtrep  called me here
from Amrif. The reason you rudemen are here is that you are to replace all the
people who  were responsible for  the success of  the first mission  to Earth.
Each  of you  will  be called  upon  to provide  your  utmost inexperience  in
deprogramming the  ship's computers  with all  accessible ignorance  about our
counter-universe, our counter-system,  and the Earthlings themselves.  Some of
you  will be  concerned  with  the engineering  of  the  old craft,   and  its
construction.
   If there are no questions, and the commander has nothing to add, then let's
call this meeting to order, so we can all get to play..."
   Samo recalled the events that led to this voyage to Earth.
   <<<Attention--Attention:Entering proximity  of gravity field of  Sungyc C-1
Prepare to fire the  T-A reaction engine in .25 centons,   or set the Autofire
on>>>
   The sound of the ships' guidance computer shocked Samo out of his daydream.
He reached down and switched the Autofire to the on position.
   "Time for final radio contact," Samo said aloud to himself.
   "Narret-1 to NSIS-1, come in NSIS-1."
   "Narret-1 this is NSIS-1."
   "NSIS-1,  Ht here.  Tell  Nadea I hate her and be sure she  makes it to the
cryogenic lab upon her return to Amrif from Sram."
   "Narret-1, Valtrep here, will do, bad luck Samo, and may DOG be with you."
   "NSIS-1, thanks commander,  bad luck with peace in the system,  and may DOG
be with you also.  Ht out."
   "Yeah, way out!" Samo thought to himself. "Well here goes nothing."
   He switched the audio countdown timer on.
   <<<Darktron warp in 0.10 centons, 0.09, 0.08, 0.07, 0.06, 0.05, 0.04, 0.03,

   "YEEEEEEEE HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!"  Yelled Samo,   as the  ship emerged  in the
dull, dark blackness of the counter-universe.
   His yell was one of delight.  Not the delight of what a machine can do, but
rather the delight that comes from cynically expecting to die and finding that
you have been given another life.

         All I want to do is sleep
         Where dreams like this are hidden deep.
         Peace of mind is found in sleep.
         Peace of mind is found in sleep.

   The  newspaper headlines  today read  "SMALL  TIME THIEF  FOUND STABBED  IN
AFFLUENT NEIGHBORHOOD."

   "This machine will be  the key to your recovery," said  Doctor James.   "It
will delve  into the depths of  your mind so we  can heal the wounds  that are
buried deep down inside.   The process will  take over two months to complete.
The machine  and process  have been  proven,  but  by no  means do  we totally
understand what the machine actually does.    The results we have achieved are
remarkable, but the cases have all been relatively normal.   Thus the going is
slow.   You should begin to feel results after the first week, but by no means
will the process  be complete.   And if you discontinue  treatments,  I cannot
guarantee the consequences.
   "The  machine  is  a  monitor   programmed  with  rudimentary  intelligence
circuits.   It  is the  only one of  its kind.   There  have been  attempts at
duplication and  all attempts have failed.    Hardware and software  have both
been duplicated  exactly and  we still  have not  been able  to duplicate  the
functions of this machine."
   Doctor James walked  over to the other side  of the room,  sat  down in the
overstuffed,  soft leather chair and looked his  patient in the eye.   "Do you
understand the risks involved, Mr. Sharmuth?  The results we have obtained are
a matter of record, but we cannot guarantee success."
   "Doctor James!"  Mr. Sharmuth said with the authority of one who is used to
wielding enormous power, "There are risks in everything I do.  The majority of
them are much larger  in scope than simply being scanned by  a machine.   I am
well aware of the risks,  however minimal.   Any risk is worth finding out why
I'm blacking out.   I  have absolutely no idea what happens  when I black out.
Sometimes I'm in the same place when I come to,  sometimes I'm not.   I'd also
like to know what happens while I am asleep."
   "Ok, Mr. Sharmuth.  We will start treatment next Monday.   You will come in
on Mondays,  Wednesdays,  and Fridays for an hour each day.   What is the most
convenient hour for you?"
   "Three o'clock will be fine with me."
   "Ok.  I'll see you on Monday at 3pm then."

   A beautiful  young woman wheeled herself  into Doctor James'  office.   Her
long,  shapely  legs were bare  to the knee.   Her  right calf was  of perfect
proportion.    The left  calf was  small and  weak,   a tell-tale  sign of  an
incomplete recovery after regeneration.  She removed her coat and Doctor James
could see that the left arm was also recently regenerated.  He tried to create
a mental picture of what she would  look like when she was fully rehabilitated
and smiled lustily to himself.
   "How recent is your regeneration, Miss Anderson?"
   "Maryann,  please.   I have  been out of the regen tank  for four weeks and
three days."
   "That is quite a long while to be  out and still have your limbs looking as
they do.  You look as if you just left the tank a day or two ago.  Who is your
therapist?"
   "My physical therapist sent me to you.   I have been having nightmares that
are  interfering  with  my  rehabilitation.   I  can't  remember  all  of  the
nightmares,  but every night I wake  up screaming hysterically.   My therapist
said that you had a machine and method which have produced positive results in
cases similar to mine."
   "The machine has been very effective in  other related cases.   I must make
you aware that there are risks though.  The machine is not guaranteed.   There
is a lot we don't know about it yet.
   "The  machine  is  a  monitor   programmed  with  rudimentary  intelligence
circuits.   It  is the  only one of  its kind.   There  have been  attempts at
duplication and  all attempts have failed.    Hardware and software  have both
been duplicated  exactly and  we still  have not  been able  to duplicate  the
functions of this machine."
   "I understand the risks, Doctor James.  I am willing to take those risks to
retain my sanity.    And I'd also like  to have the use  of my arm and  my leg
back.   I've been going through pure hell and I want to find out why.   I want
to know what is causing my nightmares!"
   "The  treatment will  take a  while.   I  want  you to  continue with  your
physical therapist.   It will be helpful to me  if I can get in touch with him
and find  out more about  your therapy.   I'll also  need to be  kept informed
about your therapeutic progress while you  are undergoing treatment here.   Is
your therapist a personal therapist or one appointed by the regen doctors?"
   "He was  appointed by the  doctors at  the regeneration clinic.    I cannot
afford a personal therapist.   I can't afford  this,  but they are footing the
bill because  their regular  therapy has not  brought my arm  and leg  back to
normal.    As you  well  know,   this is  an  extremely  rare occurrence  with
regenerated limbs.  The procedure has been refined and is almost foolproof.  I
am an  exception that they  cannot fathom.   All tests  show that I  should be
progressing normally.    There is nothing to  indicate that I should  not heal
normally.  It is, quite frankly, driving me up a wall."
   "In one previous case,  Maryann,  the  patient healed physically as well as
mentally while undergoing treatment with us.   That patient was not undergoing
any other type of therapy or rehabilitation.   We're not sure if any aspect of
the machine  should be credited in  aiding the physical rehabilitation  of the
patient.   That is another unknown we are faced with.   You provide us with an
opportunity  to discover  more  about this  aspect of  our  machine.   I  will
schedule you for three  treatments a week.   Each session will  last one hour.
What is a good time for you?"
   "My best time would be early afternoon.  How about one o'clock?"
   "I'll schedule you for one o'clock on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.  Please
do not miss an appointment,  Maryann.   This schedule of three sessions a week
for an hour has  proved the most fruitful of any schedule  we have used.   Our
optimum results have come  using this schedule.   I can make  no guesses as to
the effects of missing a session.
   One last question, Maryann.  What is the name of your therapist?"
   "His name is Doctor John Martin.   Thank you, doctor.   I'll see you Monday
at one o'clock."
   Doctor James  watched her leave  the office.    He truly hoped  the machine
would be beneficial for her.   She was too  young and beautiful to remain in a
wheelchair for the rest of her life.

   After placing the call to Doctor Martin  at the regen clinic,  Doctor James
had a better idea of what treatment would be like for Maryann.   He figured it
would be  a long  process.   She  had been  in a  horrible accident  involving
several ground vehicles.  No one else had survived the accident.  She had been
thrown clear upon impact.   She was lucky that  she was thrown out of the area
of the  explosion.   Her  left arm and  leg had been  severely injured  in the
accident.   Doctors could not save any part  of either arm or leg.   Each limb
had to be completely regenerated.
   Regeneration  of  part   of  a  limb  was  a   relatively  simple  process.
Regenerating an  entire arm  or leg  became much  more complicated.    She had
occupied a place in the regen tank for  almost two months while her limbs grew
back.   Patients usually experience a  little disorientation after having part
of a limb regenerated.   The  loss of a couple of days in one's  life is not a
big trauma.   Two  months of the regen tanks  can cause a bit  of shock though
when one comes out.
   Normal rehabilitation of a regenerated limb takes  only a week or two.   It
is  rare that  a patient  takes even  two weeks  to be  able to  use the  limb
normally.   Granted it takes  a little longer for the limb  to function at 100
per cent.  After a week, it is usually back to 80 or 90 per cent.
   Doctor  Martin  had  mentioned  another factor  that  could  contribute  to
Maryann's slow recovery.   Both her parents and her brother had been killed in
the accident.

   Floating...  in a sea of liquid, but not water.   It is thicker than water.
It's not touching me, but I can feel it.  The thin membrane covering me is not
enough to keep the feeling away.  The feeling makes my skin crawl.  The liquid
is like a gel, but not as thick.  I am able to breathe, but how?   I'm totally
encircled by the liquid/gel.  Suffocation is not a pleasant way to go...   But
I can breathe!  The membrane I am encased in must be providing oxygen.   It is
the only possible way.
   Wait.  I can see something out in the gel.  A shape.  Did it move?  Or am I
seeing things?   This gel is not exactly translucent, so I can't be sure.   It
is so difficult to  see anything out there.   Can I be sure  that I really saw
something,  or is my mind just playing tricks on me.   There's something else!
I  really see  something now.    It's  getting closer.    It's long,   perhaps
metallic.  Closer now.  It's a knife, no, a needle.  Closer...
   Maryann screamed.   Her arms were trembling and her forehead had broken out
in beads of sweat.
   Doctor James walked over to the machine,  removed the tape and placed it on
top of the folder on his desk.   After removing the tape just made he placed a
blank tape into the machine.
   After giving Maryann a moment to  regain her composure,  Doctor James moved
to the couch  directly across from Maryann.   "Do you  remember anything about
what you just dreamt, Maryann?"
   "No,  nothing at all.   I'm not sure if I want to remember it.   I feel the
same way as when I wake up in the middle of the night - terrified."
   "I will study the tape of today's session later tonight,  Maryann.   We can
discuss it when you come in on  Wednesday.   After discussing the dream we can
put you back on the machine to be monitored again.  The conscious awareness of
what is going  on in the subconscious  may be enough to  produce more detailed
dreams or  different dreams  relating to  this one.    And each  dream we  can
monitor can only aid in your recovery."
   "Will I," asked a still trembling Maryann,   "be able to view the monitored
dreams?"
   "After we have discussed the dream or dreams thoroughly you will be able to
view them.   We don't want to shock your conscious mind with something that it
insists on being kept  in the subconscious until your conscious  mind is aware
of the  content of  the dream.   Visualizing  it beforehand,   considering the
conscious mind  is going  to great  lengths to  keep the  dream buried  in the
subconscious, could be very detrimental.
   "I'll see you on Wednesday, Maryann."

   The newspaper  headlines today read "MUGGER  SHOT IN ELITE  MANCHESTER PARK
DISTRICT."

   Hatred.  Loathing.  Abhorrence.  Resentment.  Revulsion.  Humans.
   They do not deserve  to exist.   The things they do to  one another are not
things  that intelligent  beings  would  do.   They  kill  and  maim in  total
disregard of everything.    They do not deserve to exist.    They have devised
thousands of ways to kill others.   They do  this before they try even one way
to exist peacefully.  They do not deserve to exist.
   Hatred.  Loathing.  Abhorrence.  Resentment.  Revulsion.  Humans.

   With Sharmuth's session completed, Doctor James can begin to study the tape
of Maryann's  dream and the  tape of Sharmuth's dream.    He picks up  the two
tapes and reads the  markings on each.   He decides on  Sharmuth's tape first.
He walks across the room to the  playback apparatus and inserts the tape while
getting set up so he can study the contents of the tape.
   The sun  is reflecting  lazily off  the lakes.    Evergreen tree  tops send
ragged shadows to  nip at the small  whitecaps raised by the  wind.   The lush
greenery of  the hills  softens the  harsh beauty  of the  golden orange  sun.
Harsh gold fades  with time into the  hazy oranges,  yellows,  and  reds of an
unforgettable sunset.  Soon the sky is dark and the day grows cool.  Vision is
augmented by the illuminating whiteness of the full moon.   Moonlight reflects
lazily off the calm waters.   The ragged tree  top shadows have been worn to a
rounded smoothness.
   Sharmuth's tape continued like that.  Nothing but images of lush, peaceful,
sleepy land.    The entire  tape contained  only that  continuous dream.    No
people, no animals, no living creatures.   Only plants, trees, fields,  hills,
valleys...  All of them suggesting peace.
   He inserted  Maryann's tape  after shaking himself  back into  awareness of
where he was.  He played back her tape and then made notations in his notebook
for  his  next  meeting  with Maryann.    His  notations  concerning  Sharmuth
contained one word.   Peace.   He could  not possibly forget the feeling which
that dream had inspired.

   It is Wednesday.  Maryann has just arrived for her afternoon appointment.
   "Good afternoon,  Maryann." welcomed Doctor James.    For,  indeed it was a
good afternoon  as afternoons go.    It was warm and  sunny with only  a stray
cloud or two in the sky.
   "Good afternoon, Doctor." answered Maryann.
   After a moment's pause Doctor James said,  "I took a long look at the dream
which we recorded the other day.  Though I have never seen anything quite like
your dream,  it did remind me about something which I had read quite some time
ago.  I have never seen a regeneration unit or had one described so well until
now.  I spoke with the people at the regeneration clinic and they told me that
your  dream described  perfectly the  surroundings of  one who  is inside  the
regeneration unit during the regeneration  period.   Does this knowledge bring
anything to your conscious mind?"
   A hesitant "No, not really." escaped Maryann's lips.
   "Most  of  the contents  of  the  dream  are  observations about  what  the
environment you were contained  in was like.   It is not  a common nor natural
environment and  some of the feelings  about these observations are  a little,
...um, fearful because the entire situation is so foreign to you.   Throughout
the whole dream,  there is really nothing to be fearful of.   Even the part of
the  dream which  caused you  to wake  up  screaming was  a perfectly  routine
occurrence.   The only reason  you don't see it as routine  is because you are
not at all aware of how the regeneration process works, are you?"
   "No, Doctor, I am not at all familiar with it.   I have avoided anything to
do with  the regeneration process  ever since  the nightmares started  and the
therapy did not work."
   "Well, Maryann, the part of the dream where you wake up screaming is when a
needle is inserted into  the membranous sack in which you  are enclosed.   The
needle administers nutrients  and medicines peculiar to  each individual which
are necessary while the patient is undergoing regeneration.
   "The people at the  regeneration clinic also mentioned to me  that very few
people  outside  of  the medicine  world  have  any  idea  at all  of  what  a
regeneration facility  is like,  especially  from a patient's  viewpoint since
patients are always asleep while they are being treated.  My guess is that you
were  partially  aware  of  your  environment   at  either  the  conscious  or
subconscious  level and  that awareness  is  what is  causing that  particular
dream.   I am sure that,  knowing the dream for what it is,  when you view the
dream,  it  will trigger your subconscious  into accepting the  experience for
what it is rather than looking at it  as being something to fear because it is
unknown.  Do you feel you are ready to view the tape of the dream?"
   "Yes,  Doctor,   I think  so.   It  certainly sounds  like a  very ordinary
procedure the way you describe it.   I  feel so silly about being terrified of
something so ordinary."
   "There's no need for you to feel that  way.   You were scared of it because
it was an unknown.   Now it is no longer an unknown and only now has it become
something 'ordinary'.   Until just this moment it was not something 'ordinary'
to you."
   Doctor James  rises from  his chair and  motions for  Maryann to  join him.
They move over to the playback apparatus  and Doctor James inserts the tape of
Maryann's last  session while settling Maryann  into the apparatus so  she can
experience the playback of her dream.
   During the tape Maryann emits small exclamations and short bursts of barely
intelligible sentences  which indicate a  conscious realization of  her dream.
Doctor James sat close by, ready to stop the tape should something on the tape
affect Maryann in an adverse way.
   "Wow!  That is really something, Doctor."
   "I was hoping that viewing the dream would affect you this way, Maryann.  I
hoped that with a conscious foreknowledge of what you were going to see in the
dream that  you would benefit  from that viewing.   Since  I have had  no case
quite like yours, I could not be totally certain."
   "I remember that  whole experience now,  Doctor."   Maryann almost breathed
her sentences rather than speaking them  now.   "I was sufficiently drugged so
that I felt no pain and I could not  move while I was inside of that membrane,
but my mind was aware during portions of my stay in the regeneration tank.   I
can remember  beyond the  insertion of the  needle now  and the  needle wasn't
really a needle as  we think of one because it  didn't penetrate the membrane,
but the mouth widened as it encountered the  membrane and it covered a part of
the  membrane which  absorbed the  nutrients  and medicines  which the  needle
contained.  I feel awfully silly about being so terrified of THAT!"
   "Don't feel silly.   People are often terrified  of some of the most common
things in  our lives without  any solid reason.   You  are at least  no longer
terrified of this now that it is  a known rather than unknown quantity.   Many
people are still terrified  of things even when they know  that they shouldn't
be."
   "Well,  Doctor,   I'm glad  they sent  me to  you.   We're  making progress
already."
   "Yes, my dear, we are.  We will have to continue to make progress on Friday
though.  We have run a little over for this afternoon.   Try to write down any
dreams you  may have  between now  and Friday.    You shouldn't  be waking  up
screaming from this dream again,  but there  are still dreams which you may be
having that are related to your accident rather than to your experience in the
regeneration facilities that may also be very pertinent to your recovery."
   "I shall try, Doctor.  I really want to get this over with so that I can be
healthy and whole again!"
   "We will get you there,  Maryann.   As soon as possible.   Don't expect too
much too soon though.   We've had a  major success right here at the beginning
and hopefully things will continue this way,  but they may not.   So,  I don't
want you to get your hopes too high,  but I also want you to be positive about
this.  Ok?"
   "Yes, Doctor.  I understand,"  Maryann demurred.

   The newspaper headlines today read "BEGGAR FOUND STRANGLED."

         Walking the streets, alone
         Late at night when the streets
         Are asleep, they awaken long enough
         To allow one to enter and
         Glimpse the inner workings of
         A city at rest.  Dead silence
         Greets this penetration; violation
         Of a sleeping city cannot go
         Unnoticed.  Shattering the stillness,
         Screaming sirens echo their pleasure
         From twin towers to flowering gardens.
         Sirens approach, surrounding the
         Intruders and removing them
         Before they can breed trouble and
         Effect radical changes in the city.
         Silent screams awaken the city.
         Silent screams fall on deaf ears.
         Silent screams distinguish realities.
         Silent screams typify dreams.

   I cannot let myself get caught.  There is too much at stake.  These insane,
unjust humans have no right to exist.   I  must stop them.   If I do not,  the
world will become an  unimaginable place to live.   And there  is only one way
possible to keep that from occurring!

   The buzzer of the intercom sounded.    Doctor James pressed the talk button
and said, "Yes, Jan?"
   "Mr. Sharmuth is here," answered Jan.
   "Thank you.  Send him in."

   "For  someone who  is suffering  as much  inner  turmoil over  the lack  of
knowledge  you  have  about  your  blackout   periods,   this  dream  tape  is
surprisingly peaceful and calm.   The dream  contains only images of peaceful,
natural scenes.   There are no thoughts  or feelings imposed upon these images
except for an almost overwhelming feeling of peace."
   "Doctor,  I have never  been a very peaceful man.   I  need controversy and
competition.  They are as much a part of me as my heart and head.   I would go
crazy in a place such as you have just described."
   "Let's give you  a look at the tape.    See if replaying the  dream for you
will  spark any  conscious or  subconscious memories.    With your  reputation
preceding you,  I was very surprised when I  saw this dream.   It does not fit
your image at all.
   "Come sit  over here."   Doctor James held  out the chair  in front  of the
playback equipment for Mr. Sharmuth.
   Doctor James started the tape after getting Sharmuth set.   He sat close by
while the tape replayed the dream.  When it finished, Doctor James rewound the
tape and switched the playback machine off.
   "What an  eerie feeling,  Doctor.   That  tape certainly doesn't  spark any
memories,  conscious or  subconscious.   But it does give me  an awfully eerie
feeling.   I do not  feel at all comfortable thinking about  a place or places
such as the ones 'described' on that tape.  I am just not that type of man.
   "I had another blackout last night,  Doctor.    I really would like to find
out why  these blackouts  keep occurring.   While  experiencing this  dream of
peace,  I'm wondering whether  I'm losing my sanity.   I can  feel my grasp on
reality beginning to slide."
   "You have no recollection of anything during your blackout periods?"
   "None."
   "And the odd places you sometimes  find yourself regaining consciousness in
don't help to jog your memory at all?"
   "No,  I  can recall  absolutely nothing when  I regain  consciousness.   No
matter how strange I find it that I am  in a place that I have no recollection
of coming to."
   "There's got to be something,  some little piece of information hidden away
somewhere in your  memory that can give  us something solid to  grasp.   If we
just had one small clue to give us a start.
   "Shall we give the dream monitor another shot?"
   "You're the doctor..."

   The tape created during  this session was pretty much the  same as the last
one.  It contained similar images of the countryside and nature's beauty.
   And that overwhelming feeling of peace...
   Doctor James  left the  office after  mulling over  Sharmuth's problem  and
Sharmuth's dream for a short while.   "Perhaps  if I sleep on it," he thought,
"something will come to me."

   Off to the left were blurred colors of green, brown,  and grey.   These are
the  appearances  of any  sort  of  solid object  when  one  is in  a  vehicle
travelling at 190 miles per hour.   Solid  objects at the edge of one's vision
tend to  become a blur  of insubstantial matter.    One might assume  that the
green is grass, that the brown is dirt, and that the grey is rock.  All solid,
tangible, everyday items.
   Along this particular thoroughfare were many  other vehicles,  most of them
travelling  at substantially  lesser speeds.    In passing  the slower  moving
vehicles,  they also became part of the  grey blur,  melding in with the rock.
The sky ahead was beginning to dim.   The greens, browns, and greys now melded
into just one dark color.
   Out of the darkness  rose a shape.   Before it could  be seen clearly there
was a thump.  Actually, it was more like the sound of an explosion.
   Everything became red...

   Maryann awoke screaming again.  Her heart was beating in her throat and her
whole body was shaking again.  She was left gasping for breath.
   Doctor James turned off the monitor and  then placed his hands on Maryann's
shoulders in an attempt  to calm her trembling.   After a  few minutes she was
breathing normally again and only her arms had refused to stop trembling.
   "Do you remember anything this time, Maryann?"
   "All I remember is a lot of red."
   "Well,  I think that is progress in itself.   I mean this time you at least
have a small recollection of the dream  rather than none.   Does the color red
remind you of anything?   How do you feel about the color red?   Why would you
remember only the color red after waking up screaming?"
   "I don't think about the color red  overly much during the normal course of
a day, but thinking about it now does make me feel a little ill at ease."
   "That could be  a little bit of an  after effect of the dream  and the fact
that you do remember only the color red from that dream.  The dream caused you
to wake up screaming  and the only thing you remember is  the color red.   I'd
say there's  a pretty good chance  that the color red  has an awful lot  to do
with you waking up screaming.   You're also still trembling a bit.   The after
effects of the dream have not totally subsided."
   "You have a  very good point,  Doctor.    Were I not still  shaken from the
dream I might  have been able to reason that  far.   I do tend to  be a little
light headed after a I wake up screaming."
   "Well,  Maryann.   You just sit and relax for a few minutes so that you can
recover from this  dream and stop your  trembling.   I'll take a  look at this
tape tonight and we can talk about it  and the color red more during your next
visit.
   "Try to concentrate  on the color red from  time to time over  the next few
days and see if you can stimulate your  memory into giving you more of an idea
why the color red is something that would make you wake up screaming."
   "I will try, Doctor."
