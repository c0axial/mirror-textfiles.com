    To begin  the issue on  a serious note,  on the morning  of Sunday
May  8th, Robert  A.  Heinlein  died. At  age  80,  Heinlein had  been
suffering with emphysema  and heart disease, and although  the news is
not unexpected,  it does not lessen  the impact of his  death upon his
fans. Heinlein's  works span a period  of fifty years, from  the early
days of  science fiction to the  present. He won four  Hugo awards and
has written  such classic SF  works as  "Stranger in a  Strange Land",
"Starship  Troopers", "Time  Enough for  Love", "The  Moon is  a Harsh
Mistress" and many,  many others. His writing has touched  many of our
lives,  and there  is no  doubt  that his  works will  continue to  be
regarded as classic science fiction for years to come.
    In this  issue you'll find a  little of everything. We've  got two
SF shorts  which I'm sure you'll  enjoy, two short reviews,  and three
Dargon  Project stories.  We have  Becki Tants'  second Dargon  story,
and Rich Jervis'  continuation of the 'Spirit of  the Wood' storyline.
We  also have  the  first submission  from the  newest  member of  the
Dargon  Project, Jeff Lee.  I was thoroughly impressed with the story,
and I hope you enjoy it equally.
    As this is  the first issue of  the summer volume, I  find many of
the people  who regularly  contribute articles  and stories  to FSFnet
leaving the  network for the summer.  This means that unless  some new
people decide to  submit items, the number of issues  you receive this
summer  will be  minimal. I'd  like to  strongly urge  anyone who  can
write  to  consider  submitting  a   story,  or  possibly  writing  an
article,  review,  or  even  a  featured author  column.  If  you  are
interested, please  get in touch with  me, and I'll let  you know what
the  basic requirements  are.  Remember,  I can  only  print what  you
submit, so  if you want to  see something different in  the zine, feel
free to contribute something, and I'll work it in.
    With  that, and  a welcome  to  the new  readers, I  leave you  to
enjoy this excellent issue. Regards, all, and enjoy your summer...

                         For the Umpteenth Time
    Dr. Sherman Anderson  adjusted his device for  the umpteenth time.
He almost  had it  now; with  just a few  final adjustments,  his time
machine  would  be  ready  to  be   shown  to  the  world.  The  press
conference  was  scheduled  to  begin  in  fifteen  minutes,  and  the
reporters were already getting anxious in the auditorium.
    With  the help of an assistant, Dr. Anderson pushed the device out
onto the stage,  behind the curtain.  Then, shooing off the assistant,
he stepped out from behind the curtain and stood at the podium.
    "Ladies  and gentlemen  of the  press, may  I have  your attention
please?"  Dr. Anderson  said  into the  microphones. Slowly,  everyone
grew silent out of respect to this great man.
    "I have called  you here today to announce  the greatest discovery
of my  career -- indeed, perhaps  the greatest discovery in  all human
history. For centuries,  Man was limited to travel  in two dimensions.
We could travel  the length and the  breadth of the Earth,  but it was
only less  than one hundred years  ago that Orville and  Wilbur Wright
breached the third dimension and allowed Man to fly.
    "Today,  yet another  dimension has  been pierced  and opened  for
Man  to explore.  Yes, ladies  and gentlemen,  I am  here to  announce
that I  have assembled the  first device that  will allow Man  to move
through  the  fourth dimension  of  time  as  easily as  we  currently
travel through three.
    "Rather than giving  you all the boring technical  details now, my
staff has  prepared a pamphlet  explaining how this works.  Instead, I
offer you a demonstration, actual proof that this device is capable of
doing  what  I  have  promised. In  fact, so  confident  am I  of this
device,  I have  not even  tested  it yet.  Right now,  you all  shall
witness the miracle I have discovered as I turn time back 15 minutes!"
    A hush fell over  the crowd as Dr. Anderson threw  a switch on the
device. Then, in  literally no time at all, a  single impulse expanded
from deep within  the device to encompass the entire  universe as time
moved backwards precisely fifteen minutes.
    Dr. Sherman Anderson adjusted his device for the umpteenth time...

                          Stranger in the Mist
    The  cool white  shroud lay  like  a benison  over the  sweltering
city of  Dargon. Though the fog  seemed to crouch in  every corner, as
a hungry beast would  lie in wait for its prey,  the mist was welcomed
by the  inhabitants; it  was gladly  received as  an interlude  in the
incessant heat of this long, unusually hot summer.
    As  the people  relaxed  in  the early  evening,  a darker  shadow
clung  to  the wall  encircling  the  city.  Slowly  -- for  the  wall
glistened  with the  moisture of  the mist  -- this  shadow crept  yet
closer to  the top  of the wall.  It had almost  reached the  top when
its hand,  probing for a  minute crack with  which to pull  the shadow
further up,  encountered an  outthrusting of  stone, placed  there for
the very purpose of deterring intruders.
    The shadow hung  there for a moment, head bowed,  then reached its
hand up  once more.  Its fingers  pushed into the  stone as  though it
were  potter's clay,  and the  shadow pulled  itself around  the stone
barricade in  this manner.  When it  had reached  the top,  the figure
emitted a soft keening of shame.
    A dog  looked up curiously  from the  street, saw a  human sitting
atop  the city  wall,  knees tucked  under its  chin.  It wore  little
clothing, noted the  dog, who never had understood  why humans clothed
themselves anyway.  A cat's  piercing miaow  drew the  dog's attention
away, however, and it trotted off in the direction of the sound.
    Drawing a slim  cord from a pouch, the slender  figure slipped out
from the  embrasure between two  merlons and crouched on  the archers'
platform. It waited  until the moon was hidden behind  a thick bank of
clouds  before descending,  bracing  itself against  the support  beam
with the cord.  At the bottom, the glow from  a nearby window revealed
the figure to  be that of a  young woman, barely clad  in leather. Her
long  black hair  shimmered in  the yellow  light, and  her dark  eyes
gleamed as she scanned the streets and alleys.
    She started as  the sound of footsteps sounded at  the door of the
nearby house.  As there was  no cover near,  she threw herself  to the
ground  and rolled  up  against  the city  wall.  As  the chill  stone
pressed against  her flesh, she  prayed that  the fog would  offer her
enough cover to  escape detection. She shivered as  the footsteps came
closer, relaxed  a bit  as they  went off to  one side.  They stopped,
not  ten  feet from  her  head,  and she  heard  the  sound of  fabric
rustling.  Something  began splattering  against  the  wall where  the
walker was,  and an acrid stench  wafted her way. Trying  to keep from
gagging,  she  held  her  breath  and  prayed  that  he  would  finish
quickly. After a  while, the splashing faded, and  the walker breathed
a heavy sigh  of relief. He turned, finished  refastening his clothes,
and walked back to his house.
    She released her  pent-up breath, took three  shaky, deep breaths,
then  stood and  crept quickly  and  silently away.  By following  the
alleyways and  searching all of  the trash  heaps she could  find, she
procured  enough  clothing to  cover  herself  in  the manner  of  the
people she  had observed  from the  alleys. Noting  the glow  over one
part of  the city,  and hearing  the noises  from that  direction, she
surmised that there she would find a market.
    As she entered  the market, she straightened up,  seemed bolder in
visage,  and attempted  to  look  nonchalant as  she  gathered in  her
surroundings.  The babble  going on  around her  was incomprehensible;
among the  aspirants and palatal  consonants of her own  language were
harsher glottal and labial sounds.
    Nevertheless,  she could  understand only  too well  the rumblings
of her stomach,  which worsened as she neared a  baker's stall. He was
a big,  burly man,  face and neck  bright red from  long hours  in the
summer sun.  At the moment, he  was haggling with two  young boys over
the price  of a  sweetmeat. She  could see that  she would  receive no
help from him; from  the looks of things, the boys  had not eaten much
recently, and  had collected all of  the money they could  beg. It was
apparently not  enough to satisfy the  vendor. As the man  turned to a
wealthier client, one of the boys stole a small loaf of bread.
    Her eyes  widened; she emitted  a gasp  of disbelief. She  was not
naive,  and   she  had  seen   thieves  before,  but  she   was  still
unaccustomed to the idea of taking what one did not own.
    As the  vendor shouted for the  guards, the two urchins  sped from
the booth --  moving straight towards her. Still shocked,  she did not
think to  move until it was  too late. The first  boy, still clutching
the  purloined bread,  crashed  into her.  The back  of  her head  hit
something, and she lost consciousness.

    When  she awoke,  she  found herself  in  strange surroundings:  a
soft  bed with  a comfortable  pillow  under her  throbbing head.  The
grey  stone walls  about  her  held no  threat,  and  a washbasin  was
filled  with  inviting  water.  Her   clothes  were  gone,  but  finer
garments  than she'd  had were  laid out  on a  chair against  the far
wall. A  heavy oak  door, closed,  stood next  to the  chair. Sunlight
streamed  through a  high window,  bathing the  room in  a comfortable
glow. Although the day  outside was hot, and there was  no air flow in
the room, the staid stone walls kept the chamber comfortable.
    When she  had taken in all  of her surroundings, she  rose quickly
and went  to the  door. The sudden  motion brought a  stab of  pain to
her head.  Wishing that she  had the  healing talent like  her brother
had had, she  opened the door a  crack and peered out. She  was at the
end of  a well-furnished  hall with  many other  doors, most  of which
stood open.  She closed her door  again and moved --  more slowly this
time -- back to her bed.
    For a moment  she felt fear: although she was  not a prisoner, her
surroundings reminded her  all too much of her brother's  fate for her
to relax.  Almost without thinking,  she caressed the cool  stone wall
by her  bed, and  began to  apply the  "dielaim". Her  grief expressed
itself through  her fingers,  and she  molded a  small section  of the
wall into a sculpture of her brother's face.
    She  studied  it  for  a  moment,  adjusted  a  few  rough  edges,
re-hardened  the stone,  then softened  the section  of wall  directly
below  the  face.   Swiftly  she  molded  his   neck,  paying  careful
attention to  his marvelous throat,  which had  been the pride  of her
people. A wave  of melancholy hit her; never again  would she hear him
sing in  three voices at  once. Before she  could add the  one feature
lacking -- the manner of his death -- she heard someone approaching.
    She began pressing  the sculpture back into the wall,  for she had
not allowed the  neck to re-harden. She hadn't  finished "erasing" his
throat  when she  remembered her  lack of  clothing. Torn  between the
desire  to cover  herself  and the  need to  hide  her abilities,  she
wrapped  the sheet  around  her torso  and set  her  back against  the
sculpture. The nose pressed unforgivingly into her back.
    When  the door  opened, she  was surprised  to see  a young  girl,
perhaps  seventeen  or  eighteen  summers  of  age.  Strawberry-blonde
curls cascaded around the newcomer's shoulders.
    "I'm Tara," stated the girl.
    "I'm Sharin,"  she responded, surprised.  This girl, Tara,  had an
amazingly open mind.  Among Sharin's talents was the  ability to learn
language  from those  who were  "open". If  Sharin heard  a word,  she
could glean  its meaning if the  other person had a  strong mind. That
had  been one  talent which  she  and Relann  -- Oh,  my brother!  she
thought -- had shared.
    "I saw  what happened in  the market," commented Tara.  "At first,
the vendor  wanted you arrested, but  I convinced the guards  that you
had nothing  to do with  it. I think  having an important  uncle helps
sometimes. No, Zed! Get out of here!"
    Sharin  looked at  what Tara  was talking  to: a  Shivaree with  a
torn ear. Sharin  spoke to it: "Zed, lhi nielann  yonne." The Shivaree
couldn't understand  the Lanoam  tongue, of course,  but it  heard the
meanings. It  looked quizzically  at Sharin,  barked an  apology, then
started trotting out of the room.
    "No, that's  all right, Zed, if  she doesn't mind you  I guess you
can stay. What language was that? You're not from Dargon, are you?"
    "No. That  language was Lanoami."  Sharin wished she knew  more of
this language, but  she was grateful that Tara was  an easy talker. In
an effort to learn more, she asked, "Zed?"
    "Oh, he's  been my friend for  years. I found him,"  she said, and
now  her voice  took on  a tinge  of ire,  "in a  hunter's trap."  Her
voice softened  again. "I  took him  home and fed  him, and  he's been
with  me ever  since.  He's  not really  tame,"  said Tara,  obviously
remembering a  past event.  Tara fondled the  torn ear  fondly. "He'll
give his  life for me  if I'm threatened, I  know that. I  really love
him, at times he's been my only friend."
    "He love  you," said Sharin, who  knew that it was  true. She felt
a bond  with this  Tara, who  also loved  animals. Sharin  wondered if
any Lanoam blood was in Tara, for she obviously had a talent.
    "Why do  you say that?"  asked Tara. "I mean,  I know it,  but how
can you tell?"
    Sharin didn't  know the words to  express what she wanted  to say,
but  she didn't  want  to  songweave, not  until  she  knew this  girl
better. Songweave wouldn't  work on most non-Lanoam, but  Sharin had a
feeling that  this girl could receive  -- after all, her  bonding with
a Shivaree was  incredible. So she had to indicate  with her hands and
eyes that she didn't know the words.
    Frowning, Tara  ventured, "You can't  speak my language,  can you?
You're only using the words that I've said!"
    Sadly,  Sharin  replied, "No,  I  can't  speak the  language.  You
speak the words, I..." she pointed to her head.
    "Learn?" asked Tara.
    "I learn the  words," finished Sharin gratefully.  Trying to glean
the  most important  information as  inconspicuously as  possible, she
asked, "Uncle?"
    "This  is my  Uncle Glenn's  house.  He's known  here as  Adrunian
Koren, the Captain of  the Guards. I had to come  here when my... when
my  parents  were  killed  by   bandits."  Zed  nuzzled  Tara's  hand,
reacting  to  the strong  emotions  she  was projecting.  Sharin  felt
closer to Tara;  she understood the loss of family.  "Since then, I've
begun  learning  how to  defend  myself.  I've  had  cause to  do  so,
though. I  met a woman  who looked exactly  like me, but  that's where
the resemblance  ended. She was  going to kill  me, but Zed  saved me.
That's how  his ear  got torn --  she tried to  kill him,  but luckily
she missed. I'm sorry, I'm just rambling."
    "No," protested Sharin. "I learn."
    "No, I've completely  forgotten my manners. Here  you are, wrapped
up in a sheet!  Oh, I cleaned your wound -- you took  a nasty knock --
then I gave you a bath. I hope you don't mind."
    "I don't mind," said Sharin. She looked towards the clothes.
    Tara took the  hint. "All right, let me know  when you're dressed,
I'll  be outside."  She  went  out the  door,  closed  it behind  her.
Quickly  Sharin  turned  and  finished  removing  the  traces  of  her
brother's throat.  She was just ready  to re-soften the face  when the
door opened again.
    "Sorry, Zed's  still in here... How  did you DO that?"  Tara stood
gaping at the sculpture.
    Sharin was frozen  in horror. For a fleeting moment  she was angry
at Tara  for coming  in without  knocking, but  it was  overwhelmed at
the fact that one of her talents had been discovered.
    Tara came  into the room.  "I'm sorry,  I didn't mean  to frighten
you!  How did  you  do that?  It's beautiful!  Please,  I'm sorry  for
barging in here. Why are you afraid?"
    Sharin could  feel that  Tara really  was sorry  for what  she had
caused, so she  decided to take a chance and  trust Tara. She motioned
for Tara to close the door and sit down, and sat on the bed herself.
    When  Tara was  sitting, Sharin  began the  Songweave. Her  throat
opened,  and  the music  of  her  story  poured forth.  Tara,  already
conditioned  to  be receptive  to  animals,  heard  the words  of  the
Songweave as  though they had  been sung  aloud, and to  her surprise,
she could understand them perfectly.

    I  am  Sharin,  daughter  of  Oriann and  Niarda,  of  the  Lanoam
people. The song I  weave is of my brother, Relann.  He was beloved of
the  Lanoam, and  with the  voice of  three Winds  could he  weave his
tales. He was a  healer, a master of the dielaim,  and was born whole!
None were needed at  his birthing to assist his life,  and all who saw
him proclaimed that his place on the cliffs would be high!
    For  nineteen summers  he grew,  and with  each passing  summer he
grew  sadder. For  among my  people rare  is the  whole child.  At the
birthings are all  too often needed the strongest  healers, to correct
the children's bodies.
    Relann  said to  the elders  of my  people, Alas!  for we  are too
few, and with  each generation the children grow weaker!  We must find
help, and others who  will share our lives, that we  pass not from the
sight of the Sun!
    But the elders listened  not, for he was but a  child then. On his
eighteenth summer,  he again  petitioned them,  saying, Alas!  for now
fewer are born alive than dead! We must have help, or perish utterly!
    Yet again  the elders would not  hear him, and in  the next summer
he tried once  more, saying, Alas! if  you do nothing for  the love of
your children,  grant to  me at  least the right  of Quest!  For other
people have magics,  which we cannot use, and mayhap  I might find one
who can aid us!
    And to this  the elders consented, for the children  who had lived
had  been terrible  to behold.  All  were now  unblemished, but  their
visages at birth could rend the heart!
    Thus  in  that  summer  he  began  his  Quest.  To  far  lands  he
ventured, finding none  who would help him. Then, in  the next spring,
he  found a  noble who  was willing  to help  my people,  if he  would
receive aid  in return.  Relann showed  him what  he could  do: sculpt
beautiful works  in stone; strengthen  wooden bridges to  the hardness
of metals, so that they would not break; heal the sick and dying.
    But the  noble was black  of heart, and  forced Relann to  use his
talents in  other ways. At  first Relann  refused, for to  use talents
for ill  is contrary to all  of the laws  of my people! But  the noble
had naught  but scorn for  morals, and  maimed Relann until  he agreed
to do the noble's bidding.
    Relann's  wonderful talents  were used  to work  woe: rather  than
sculpt, he  had to soften the  stone defenses of the  noble's enemies;
he was  made to harden  wooden weapons,  that the noble  could conquer
less expensively; he was forced to heal only the noble's soldiers.
    Yet Relann could do  nothing; he had to keep his  life. One day he
coaxed a  sparrow to  him, and told  it to find  me. When  the sparrow
found  me, I  left at  once. Relann  would not  touch me,  for he  had
become corrupt. He sang  for me his Lifesong, as I  watched him at his
window.  Then was  the last  of his  three Winds  sounded, for  with a
piece of glass he released them.
    With  a  heavy  heart  I  returned to  my  people,  and  sang  his
Lifesong. With only one  voice, I could not express it  as he did, and
my heart  nearly burst with grief.  High on the cliffs  I sculpted his
death-mask.  In the  chasm  that had  been his  throat  nests now  the
sparrow, for it grieves with me.
    When I had  carved the mask, I continued his  Quest. None yet have
I found who could  aid me, but I will not ask the  nobles. I have used
my talents shamefully -- with dielaim have I entered cities unnoticed.
I have corrupted myself, but I shall finish  Relann's Quest ere I sing
my Lifesong. I thank you, my spirit-sister, for your hospitality,  but
now must I move on. May your Song be sung for Eternity!

    When the  song was ended,  both had  tears in their  eyes. Rising,
Sharin  kissed  Tara in  the  manner  of  her people.  Startled,  Tara
resisted, but it  was over. Quickly, Sharin  dressed. Wordlessly, Tara
showed her  to the door, then  hugged Sharin tightly. When  Sharin had
disappeared  from view,  Tara closed  the door  and went  back to  the
guest  room. She  caressed the  face in  the stone  for a  long while,
then went back to her own room.
    That night,  as the  mist crept  back into  the streets  of Dargon
City, Tara n'ha Sansela began to sing.

                         Review: "Hart's Hope"
    This  recently-released TOR  reprint was  originally published  in
1983, but received  only passing attention. Card  has received acclaim
for  several  well-known  works,  including "Speaker  for  the  Dead",
"Songmaster",  "Ender's  Game", "Wyrms",  and  "Seventh  Son" and  its
sequel  "Red Prophet".  There  has recently  been  some discussion  of
Card in  SF-LOVERS, as  well. Although  not a  member of  Card's other
collections, "Hart's Hope" is definitely a worthwhile read.
    "Hart's  Hope"  is  a  tale  of the  cruelty  of  mercy,  and  its
vengeance. The  story opens with  a count named Paliocrovol  leading a
successful  uprising  against  the  current king.  To  legitimize  his
power, he  kills the old  king and forces  his daughter to  marry him,
publicly raping  and shaming  her (a necessary  act to  legitimize his
assumption of the  throne). Against his advisors'  warnings he permits
the  woman to  live in  exile, under  the guard  of a  trusted wizard,
thinking  the woman  powerless.  However, the  queen secretly  studies
the arcane books  of the wizard, and  when she bears the  child of the
new king, she sacrifices it to give herself immense magical power.
    She then enslaves  her guardian and returns to the  city where her
king is  about to wed  a second time.  She interrupts the  cermony and
through her  magic enslaves Paliocrovol's  advisors and his  bride and
curses  and banishes  him  from the  city, ruling  in  his stead.  Her
magic  makes  even the  gods  powerless,  and  her reign  endures  for
centuries  as she  keeps  Paliocrovol and  his  cursed advisors  alive
through her  powers. The book  is the story of  her rise to  power and
how her  power is challenged as  it weakens after three  hundred years
of absolute power.
    The    book   is    very   well-written,    and   definitely    an
attention-holder. The  magic used  is complex  and well-characterized,
and it  is neither simple  nor overused.  The characters are  deep and
intelligent and very  well-developed. The book is written  in a unique
style, being  an open  letter to Paliocrovol,  raconting the  story of
Queen Beauty's  rule, and  it is very  easy to read.  One of  the most
admirable  aspects  of the  book  is  Card's ability  to  characterize
several different religions  which have followings in  the region. The
religion of the  Hart is a male-oriented belief in  the mystical power
of the  living blood; the  Sweet Sisters, a matriarchy  deriving their
power from  the secrets of  womanhood; and  God, a new  religion based
on  a monotheistic  pretext. Card's  use  of these  religions is  very
sophisticated,  and the  conflict between  the queen  and the  gods is
the underlying story within the book.
    "Hart's Hope"  is a fascinating  book, both for the  casual reader
and  the astute  fan.  Not only  is it  an  enjoyable and  provocative
read, but  its style is  refreshingly different without giving  up any
of its power to  take the reader away to a  very different world. Even
if your reading list is limited by time, as mine is, I reccommend it.

                        A Scent in the Air
    Summary -  Since it has been  so long since 'Winds  of Change' was
put out, I am going to summarize what happened.
    When we left  Ariel, she had just  left the  tavern in search of a
job.  She had  arrived in  Dargon the  night before,  exhausted from a
long journey, during which her lover, Stefan, had been killed.  Stefan
had been an Air Mage, under the  goddess  Iliara.  He had been  killed
because  of a  blood feud  between the  worshipers  of  Iliara and the
worshipers of the  earth god, Haargon.  They have been following Ariel
ever since, because  Stefan had been teaching her prior to his  death.
They do not know how far her powers have gone yet, so they have yet to
take action against her.  Just prior to leaving the Inn in search of a
job, Ariel received a  note from a priest of  Iliara along with a ring
that had belonged to Stefan.  The note merely told her that she was on
her own for now.

    "Following  this little  wench is  getting  to be  a pain!",  Alec
said as  he walked into  the back room of  the chapel. "She  has shown
no sign  of regaining her  powers enough to fight  us off, or  even be
considered an Air mage anymore. Why do we continue to bother?"
    "Patience,  Alec. Haargon  has shown  me  signs that  this one  is
dangerous, but  I don't  want to  kill her  until I  find out  in what
way. I don't want this danger to present itself  again.  What have you
learned?".
    Alec  looked at  the  old priest.  He was  dressed  in the  simple
robes that any  of the priests in this city  might wear, identified as
one  of Haargon's  followers only  by the  holy symbol  hanging around
his neck.  It was  the only  symbol of any  of the  Gods that  had any
value in and  of itself. The piece of crystal  clear quartz, encircled
by silver  in such a way  as to allow a  chain of silver to  be hooked
through, was  worth quite a  bit of money to  a jeweler or  noble, and
this specimen  was extraordinarily beautiful.  The priest had  had all
sort of  intricate carving done on  the medallion and had  gone out of
his  way  to find  the  most  beautiful,  double terminated  piece  of
quartz seen  in Dargon  in years.  Alec didn't  know if  the medallion
was magical  (although he assumed  it was), but  he did know  that the
priest would protect it to the death.
    "She is  staying at  the Inn of  the Golden Lion,  up in  the rich
section of town.  She went out this morning, wandered  around for some
time  going from  shop to  shop in  the market  area, as  well as  the
business district  and never came  out of Camron's Shipping.  When she
had been in  there for about 3 hours  I decided it was a  good time to
come report to you." Alec said.
    "Reasonable. Camron  has been  looking for  a good  bookkeeper and
from what  I'm told of  her history,  she would fit  that description.
She needs a job to pay rent here. That will work out nicely......."
    "Sir, then would  it be possible for me to  get paid?" Alec asked,
a bit  afraid of  the answer.  This particular  sect had  a reputation
for trying to  get you to convert and donate  your earnings as opposed
to paying for services. They were rumored to be VERY effective.
    "Hmm, uh, What?  Oh yes, your pay. Certainly."  Reaching under the
desk, he  pulled out a couple  of large denomination coins  and tossed
them to  Alec. "If you  are interested in more  of that, I  would like
you to follow  her for the next  couple of weeks. Just keep  an eye on
what she  does, who  she sees,  and if  she goes  anywhere out  of the
ordinary.  Also if  she moves  out of  that expensive  Inn. Report  in
once  a week,  or  whenever there  is something  I  should know  about
immediately. Interested?"
    Thinking how easy  the payment had been to get,  and assuming that
the rumors were  wrong, Alec said "Certainly, sir. I  will report back
to you in one week."
    "Wonderful"  the old  priest said.  As  Alec was  walking out  the
door, almost  as an afterthought,  the priest  added "Oh, by  the way,
are you interested in converting?"

    Getting a  job in Dargon  turned out to  be easier than  Ariel had
thought it would be.  She stopped at several places, and  had a job as
a bookkeeper  for a  nice, older  man by noon.  She worked  until late
that night  getting herself familiarized  with his system, then  had a
quick dinner at the inn before turning in.
    The next  morning, she  moved to  a cheaper  place. Her  new boss,
Camron  had a  cousin  who wanted  to  rent  a room  in  his house  to
someone,  and  the  arrangements  for   Ariel  to  move  in  had  been
completed the  day before. She  was shown  to a nice  room, relatively
large, with a  bed and a dresser  in it and told that  she was welcome
to eat with  the family. The rent  was 1/5 that of the  inn she'd been
staying at and  the atmosphere much nicer. Camron's  cousin Karina and
her  husband Marcus  were immediately  friendly towards  her. As  they
were eating  dinner that  night, they  got to know  each other  and by
the  time they  were done,  she had  both their  friendship and  their
sympathy.  Ariel did,  however, leave  out the  details of  the magic.
Karina and  Marcus struck  her as very  down-to-earth people  who felt
that magic  was a bunch  of rubbish, so  when Stefan's death  came up,
she told them that  it had been merely bandits in  the forest and that
they had  not noticed her  sleeping nearby  because she was  so rolled
up in her blankets.
    "You were very  lucky, you realize. Surviving  that little episode
as  well  as  getting  through all  the  intervening  distance  alone,
through some  rough territory, is  quite a  feat for one  as yourself.
You should thank  the gods for your life. Perhaps  they have something
in mind for you." Marcus said, as they were all clearing the table.
    "I have  thanked them over  and over,  but if they  have something
in mind  for me, they have  not yet deigned  to tell me of  it." Ariel
replied. She  liked Marcus. He was  a very caring person  who had done
all but adopt her in the short time they had known each other.
    "Well,  that little  adventure over,  you should  find yourself  a
good  husband, settle  down, and  marry.  My cousin  Camron hired  you
because he has a  soft spot for ladies in distress,  but a young woman
such as  yourself should  not be  working, but be  married and  with a
home  and family  of her  own." Karina  said. She  was definitely  the
practical one  in the family.  Loving, good, and practical.  Her house
reflected this.  Everything was  spotless, the  food was  fresh, good,
and prepared with all the love she could come up with.
    "Perhaps someday,  but right now my  loss of Stefan is  too new. I
doubt I  could love  anyone the  way I loved  Stefan right  now. Maybe
someday.... Now  if you'll excuse me,  I should get to  bed. Today was
a long day  and tomorrow will be no shorter."  Ariel said, heading for
the stairs.
    "Certainly,  dear. Sleep  well." Karina  said as  Ariel walked  up
the stairs.
    Up in her  room, Ariel pondered her new-found  friends. Marcus and
Karina  were both  young, hardly  more than  a couple  of years  older
then herself,  yet they  had been  married for  almost four  years and
there were  no children yet. "That's  why they are renting  this room"
she  thought. No  children to  put  in it.  Unfortunate. Karina  would
make a good mother.
    With thoughts of  Stefan, children, and homes  running through her
mind, Ariel drifted off to sleep.

    The next  day was indeed  a long one  and Ariel worked  until well
after  dark  trying  to  balance The  Dolphin  Queen's  cargo  sheets.
Finally finished, and  highly pleased with the work she  had done that
day, Ariel  headed out, not  really even  considering the danger  of a
female walking  alone at night. As  she came around the  corner onto a
side street a  few blocks from home,  she began to get  an odd feeling
that she  was being watched.  Glancing behind  her and seeing  no one,
she dismissed it as merely paranoia, but began to walk a bit faster.
    The  street was  deserted,  and not  very well  lit,  so when  the
bright light  hit her in the  face, she was momentarily  blinded. When
her  vision  came   back,  there  were  three   robbers  with  torches
surrounding  her, looking  at her  with a  terribly malicious  look in
their eyes. Out  of the corner of  her eye she noticed a  small man in
priestly robes  and Haargon's holy  symbol watching with an  even more
murderous look in his.
    As they  approached her, she realized  the danger she would  be in
if she even tried  to call upon her powers, and  did the only sensible
thing; She  charged at the  ones in front of  her, at the  last minute
ducking left and around  them both. Free, she began to  run as fast as
she could.  The ruffians were  not far behind her  as she ran,  but as
she  passed the  priest, he  merely smiled  and began  walking in  the
other direction.
    They were catching  up on her. She was very  slowly running out of
breath to run  any further, and losing this race  anyway. Without even
thinking,  she began  to  draw the  wind  to her,  to  move her  along
faster and to  strengthen her. Feeling little  response, she attempted
to concentrate  on Stefan's  ring and  do the  same thing.  This time,
there was  some help.  With the  wind at  her back  and in  her lungs,
strengthening her  and speeding her along,  she gradually outdistanced
the  ruffians and  eventually  they stopped  chasing  her. She  didn't
stop running  though. The  earth mage  knew that  she had  called upon
power...he had  to have known....  She was  once again in  danger from
the cult. This thought alone sped her along the rest of the way home.
    "At least they  don't know where I live," she  thought as she came
through  the   door,  huffing  and  puffing,   and  almost  completely
exhausted. Marcus  and Karina were  waiting for her,  looking worried.
Karina's  face became  even more  concerned when  she saw  how heavily
Ariel was breathing.
    "Good  Gods, what  happened? Where  have you  been? We've  been so
worried!  Are you  all right???  " Karina  said. Marcus's  face echoed
the questions, although  all he did was  lead her over to  a chair and
get her a glass of water.
    When she  finally regained her  breath, Ariel said "I  was working
late on a problem  I had all but solved. As I was  walking home, I was
attacked by  three muggers about  five blocks  from here. I  ran. They
followed for a  while, but I outran  them and they gave  up soon after
they realized  that. I'm OK.  Really. Just a  bit out of  breath. I'll
be fine."
    "Let me  get you  a some dinner  and then you  should go  right to
bed. You  know, this area isn't  highly prone to muggers,  but I guess
a single female  walking anywhere alone at night is  in danger. Please
be careful. Perhaps  you can get someone from work  to walk you home?"
Karina said as she  brought a plate of bread and cheese  and a bowl of
soup out.
    "From now  on I  will. Either  that or  not stay  as late.  I'm so
exhausted." Ariel said, immediately diving into the stew.
    They  sat in  silence while  she ate,  until Marcus  finally spoke
up.  "Ariel, is  there  someone after  you? This  is  the second  time
you've been attacked  recently, and I've seen this  man hanging around
outside quite a bit lately. Are you in some kind of trouble?"
    "No,"  Ariel said  hurriedly, "but  thank you  for caring.  Now if
you'll excuse me, I really need to get to sleep. G'night."
    As  she  walked  up  the   stairs,  Karina  and  Marcus  exchanged
glances. Neither believed her.

    "So she  does have some  of her  power back. Interesting.  Keep an
eye on  her and  report back  if she does  anything further."  the old
priest said. "We may have to take care of her soon. Permanently."
    Alec shivered at that last word and walked out of the room.

                               Necrolepsy
    Gregory Schaeffer  refused to  believe what his  associate, Martin
Johnson, had  just told him.  "There is  no such thing  as necrolepsy.
Someone   cannot   simply  die   and   be   revived  without   medical
intervention; it's just not possible."
    "I am  a doctor, Greg.  I know what I  saw. This man  just dropped
dead over  in Felder  Park. I  checked him out  personally: he  had no
pulse, no  breathing--nothing. CPR had no  effect on him and  when the
emergency squad came,  their shock pads didn't phase  him either. When
we reached the  hospital and checked him out further,  I had to report
him DOA.  But when  the men  from the  morgue came  up and  started to
take him  away, he  sat up  and said, 'Hey,  where we  going?'" Martin
glared at Greg as if daring him to say he was lying.
    "Maybe the  instruments are  on the fritz,"  Greg said.  "Or maybe
Franklin's been screwing with the settings again."
    "No," Martin  said, "Franklin hasn't  been around the  last couple
of days,  and everything has  been checked out thoroughly.  Nothing is
wrong with  any of  the instruments.  Face it, Greg;  we've got  a new
disease on  our hands, and the  only name that fits  is 'necrolepsy'."
Martin made sure Greg  was looking at him before he  went on. "He says
this has happened to him before."
    Greg  wasn't convinced.  "I  still say  there  is something  wrong
with  our monitors.  The tests  these people  run on  machinery around
here  would say  that a  blood pressure  cuff with  a hole  in it  was
working perfectly. Is there any evidence that it has happened before?"
    Martin sighed. "No.  He says he was always alone  when it happened
before. But  he claims to  have blank spaces  in his memory  where all
he  remembers is  standing  one instant  and the  next  he is  picking
himself  up off  the floor  with the  clock telling  him it's  several
hours later."
    "And you believe him?"
    Martin looked up  at Greg. "I have no reason  not to--I've seen it
happen once myself."
    "Marty,  do you  realize that  if something  like necrolepsy  does
exist, as you  claim, there are hundreds of people  that this hospital
alone has sent to  the morgue who may have really  been alive? For the
sake of my own sanity, I can't accept that such a disease exists."
    Martin suddenly  understood why  Greg wouldn't believe  him. "Yes,
I realize that, Greg.  But if it does exist, I have  to know. It's the
only way  I'll ever  be able to  do my job  effectively. If  there's a
possibility that  a disease like this  exists, I have to  know one way
or the  other. I've  requested three  nurses to  be assigned  to watch
him at all times. I want to know immediately if he drops dead again."

    During the  next two months, Mr.  Bowen had no more  seizures. The
nurses worked  in shifts, watching  him and taking his  blood pressure
and pulse every twelve hours. Nothing abnormal was found.
    After two  months, the  hospital's Chief  of Staff  approached Dr.
Johnson.  "I  can't authorize  three  nurses  to babysit  a  perfectly
healthy man any longer, Martin."
    "Luke, you have  to. If this man isn't  monitored regularly, we'll
never find a way to diagnose necrolepsy."
    "Martin, I have  to run this hospital according to  a budget and a
board  of directors  that gets  very upset  when I  take money  out of
that budget  and don't  tell them  exactly what  it's for.  They bring
this up at every  meeting. I can't avoid the issue  any longer and I'm
not about to  tell them what's really  going on. If they  were to find
out we  were just waiting  for a  man to die  again so we  could prove
that a  disease, which  half of my  staff is afraid  to even  admit is
possible, exists,  I don't know  how they'd react. I'm  sorry, Martin,
but I've got to recall those nurses."
    Martin knew  what Luke  had said  was true and  that there  was no
way  to convince  him  to keep  a  nurse assigned  to  Mr. Bowen.  So,
rather than trying  to argue, he left the Chief  of Staff's office and
started on his rounds.
    Meanwhile, all around the city, the necrolepsy spread.

                     Review: "A Man Rides Through"
    Mordant's  Need Volume  2: "A  Man Rides  Through", by  Stephen R.
Donaldson. Del Rey Books, 1987.
    In summer  of 1987, Stephen  Donaldson released the first  part of
Mordant's  Need: "The  Mirror  of  Her Dreams".  It  was  a book  that
realized   that   medieval   societies   have   government   intrigue,
corruption, and  war strategies  alongside the knights  and magicians.
"The  Mirror of  Her  Dreams"  spun a  magic  spell  and involved  the
reader  in the  various plots  of  the imaginary  kingdom of  Mordant,
where  Earthling  Terisa  Morgan   was  miraculously  transported  via
Mordant's peculiar breed of magic, which involves mirrors.
    "The  Mirror of  Her Dreams"  ended in  a cliff-hanger:  our hero,
Geraden,  who hopes  to become  an  Imager (a  Mordant magic-user  who
uses  only mirrors),  is  framed for  the murder  of  his brother  and
disappears into  his own  mirror. Lady  Terisa is  left alone  to face
the  ire of  the  crusty Castellan  and the  machinations  of the  two
traitors within the castle.
    "A  Man Rides  Through" opens  with  Terisa in  the dungeon  being
threatened by  the slightly  psychotic Castellan Lebbick.  There still
are traitors  loose in the  castle, and  an enemy army  stands outside
the walls in  an attempt at siege.  One of the princesses  is with the
enemy,  the other  is missing.  The King  refuses to  take any  action
against  the  siege.   Many  try  to  make   Terisa  betray  Geraden's
whereabouts (which,  incidentally, she does know):  the Castellan, the
King's Chancellor, one  of Geraden's brothers, and  one Master Eremis,
a  slick, lecherous,  and totally  unlikeable Imager.  The country  of
Mordant  is  being  attacked  on   all  sides  by  dangerous,  magical
monsters. Things progress from there.
    Donaldson's  style, as  always, is  captivating, varied,  and easy
to  read. The  story itself  is hard  to get  away from;  I dreamt  of
Terisa and  Geraden for two nights.  The plot (or should  I say plots)
of Mordant is well worked-out, and, in the  end, it all makes  perfect
sense.
    Of course, this  is a Donaldson book, and one  must expect certain
things. There  are no lepers in  this book, but as  usual, Donaldson's
usual  cast  of neurotics  are  out  in  full  force. There  is  Adept
Havelock, one  of the  most likeable loonies  in literature,  for one.
Castellan  Lebbick  impresses  me   as  a  sado-masochist.  About  one
character in three  has a superiority or inferiority  complex. Yet the
mild insanities  serve to  make the  characters more  realistic; these
are not token insanities.
    One  word  of  warning:  reading "A  Man  Rides  Through"  without
having  read "The  Mirror  of  Her Dreams"  can  be  hazardous to  the
reader's  sanity. There  are so  many plots  and counterplots  in King
Joyse's realm  that without  prior knowledge,  the reader  will become
quite confused.  But "The  Mirror of  Her Dreams"  is as  well written
and entertaining as  its sequel, and the only criticism  I can make of
either book is that they end too soon.

                         Spirit of the Wood: 7
    Loric's first  sight as  a man  was the  sun pearling  through the
caul that surrounded him.
    For a moment  he didn't recognize where he was  and struggled with
the  thin membrane  of skin,  flopping onto  the forest  floor like  a
ungainly hatching.
    It was  late afternoon by  the look of it  and the air  smelled of
impending  rain. He  took a  clean lungfull  and puzzled  over why  he
felt that it had been ages since he had done so.
    "OH"  said Loric  as he  looked  down at  the caul.  "I suppose  I
should eat you now.  I am hungry but not really  that hungry." He bent
down and  tore loose a dry  piece of skin. He  smelled it thoughtfully
and started to  put it in his  mouth when he caught a  movement out of
the corner of his eye.
    Loric whirled  and dropped into  a crouch.  He felt for  the press
of his  kesh-blade and was  relieved to find it  tied with gut  to his
side.  At first  he saw  nothing, only  shadow, then  he saw  a shadow
darker  than  the  others. A  moment  more  and  he  could see  a  man
standing next to a tree dressed like no other he had ever seen.
    He wore  an outer  piece of  cloth draped  over his  shoulders and
his  legs clad  in high  soft boots.  His right  hand cradled  a short
staff and  the left was  open and  held out from  his body. He  wore a
dusky  hat that  covered thick  curled locks.  Long sleeved  tunic and
breeches the  color of wet tree  bark blended so closely  to the woods
around him  that Loric  was unsure  where the man  ended and  the tree
began. The  man's face held  no menace,  though what inner  emotion it
did reflect, Loric  could not guess. Loric noticed he  had hair on his
face  and wondered  if  his tribe  had  marked him  as  an outcast  or
whether he had never passed his Shreaving.
    "You're  not going  to eat  that?" The  stranger's voice  was deep
and accented but  slow enough for Loric to understand.  He looked away
for a moment to glance at the caul and then back to the stranger.
    "I'm supposed  to. Part  of my song  will remain in  it and  if an
animal eats it I'll become a shapechanger under the moon's full face."
    "Has that  happened to  anyone alive,  or is  that just  what your
Histories say will happen?"
    "I  have no  doubt in  the  Histories! They  are the  blood of  my
tribe and  my song is  strong!" Loric rose  slowly to his  full height
and tried to  look menacing. He didn't like this  stranger and knew he
should  not  be   here.  "What  tribe  are  you?  And   why  have  you
interrupted  my Shreaving?  If you  know  of the  Histories, then  you
know I  am to avoid  contact with anyone, the  Shreaving is a  test of
my ability to survive on my own. Go away."
    "Do your  Histories tell you to  eat that goatskin by  itself boy,
or can you make it part of other foods?"
    Loric picked up  the caul and stepped back. "It's  not a goatskin,
it's  my caul!  If you  will not  leave, then  I must!  He turned  and
walked stiffly  into the forest  trusting his  hearing to tell  of any
pursuit. When  no sound  of the  stranger followed  him he  turned and
circled  back to  the  clearing.  He searched  but  found  no sign  of
anyone  ever having  been there  except his  own tracks  and those  of
some Downlanders six days stale.
    Satisfied that he  had traveled far enough to  avoid the stranger,
Loric set  about building a  shelter. He wove  a short length  of rope
stout enough  to hold his weight  and used it  to anchor one end  of a
limb to  a tree trunk  while wedging the other  in a fork  high enough
to  discourage all  but  the most  persistent of  hunters.  A roof  of
broad  leaves from  a fustian  bush made  a good  cover from  the rain
which had already  begun to fall in  loud plops around him.  He took a
moment  to gather  some dry  wood to  start a  fire after  the shower,
then climbed to the top of the trees and sang his song to the Spirit.
    After that there  was nothing to do but wriggle  into his shelter,
pushing the bundle  of wood ahead of  him, and wait out  the storm. It
was a tight  fit, but it was  dry and he could see  the forest rolling
away from  him in  a dense  canopy of  muted greens,  the sun  a white
disk  behind  the clouds.  There  would  be  time  to build  a  better
shelter later,  if the Spirit so  desired. He thought of  the stranger
and  what  he  had  said about  the  histories,  silently  admonishing
himself for  summing up the  Shreaving in such  a small way.  Was that
really all  the Shreaving was to  be, a test  to see if I  can survive
alone? The stranger  had disturbed something deep within  in Loric and
he found it difficult to turn his thoughts to the tasks ahead.
    The  sun crouched  low  on the  horizon when  the  rain ended  and
Loric emerged from his  'home'. By now he was ravenous  and he went to
the limb where he had hung his caul to catch the rain water.  He drank
deeply and then cut a piece to chew on while he hunted.

    The  Histories clearly  spoke of  what Loric  could and  could not
eat during  his Shreaving--especially since  he had not yet  eaten his
caul.  The easiest  prey  being  snail and  tree-crab,  both of  which
became active after  rainfall, and then certain of  the larger animals
that fed on them.
    Loric climbed  from tree to  tree looking  for signs that  a river
or stream  was near.  He followed the  lay of the  land and  found not
just  a stream  but several  small streams  that ran  together in  mad
confusion before falling into a gorge and out of sight.
    He  approached  slowly,hoping  to  find  howlers  there  that  had
caught crab  or snail  in the  trees and brought  them to  the water's
edge  to crack  on the  rocks. He  stopped a  short distance  from the
forest's  edge and  listened  intently. He  heard  the water  dripping
from the  trees and  the rub  of bark and  limb and  the voice  of the
Spirit  moving among  the trees;  sighing a  song about  rain and  the
life  it brought.  Then  he heard  the telltale  clack  and scrape  of
feeding  howlers. With  a smile  Loric moved  slowly forward,  knowing
that one  sound out  of place and  the howlers would  set up  an alarm
that would send the pack racing for the safety of the trees.
    He began  to weave the  wood-song about  him, slowly like  the web
of a spider,  a strand at a time.  I am the wind, Oh Spirit,  I am the
limb that  speaks loudly  to the  leaf, nothing  more. A  howler would
not be alarmed  by the sound of  a limb mumbling in the  shadow of its
brothers. Of  course not, how silly  it seems, when there  are so many
other things  think about  howler. The  sun is still  out the  pack is
feeding and there are meat-nuts to crack.
    Loric  kept  thinking  one   such  thought  after  another,  never
stopping  the  flow  of  thought   and  never  stopping  his  progress
forward. This  was the first time  Loric had put the  wood-song to use
on  his own.  In  times before  he  had his  grandfather  to keep  the
cadence and flow  of thought clear. He never realized  how hard it had
been for Oldsir  to carry the theme  of the song for  so long. Oldsir!
Loric  cursed  himself for  the  drifting  thought. The  howlers  were
sitting  in a  circle and  the  one closest  to him  an older  female,
stopped  picking at  the shell  she had  in hand  and looked  right at
him. OH  Spirit! Thought Loric furiously.  I am a log.  Many times you
have passed  me on your way  to this spot she-howler.  I remember your
first time  here after  I had  fallen. You carried  your young  one on
your back. How he cried! Where is he now, She-howler?
    The howler  blinked and coughed  once. The pack turned  and became
instantly alert.  A young male walked  out of the circle  and sniffled
in Loric's  direction. It  seemed confused  for it  could not  see the
source of  the images it  heard, it could  not see anything  where the
she-howler looked, nothing  but the forest and a pile  of dead wood at
the forest's  edge. Loric  turned his attention  to the  young howler.
'You are so  strong! Why do you  not lead the pack? Your  fur is thick
and  your  limbs  are  clean  and strong.  Surely  there  is  none  to
challenge  you.  You  should  have  your  choice  of  females.'  Loric
thought as  hard and sincerely as  he could. The male  was pacing back
and  forth  in short  tight  turns.  Weaving  in rhythm  with  Loric's
thoughts. Suddenly he  turned and barked at an older  male. A shouting
match began and the young male was chased up a tree by the leader.
    **The  pack-male is  jealous of  your  son She-howler,  and he  is
hungry. He eats too  much! He will eat all the  meat-nuts and you will
have none. He can  see the shells you have. He will  take them and you
will not eat.  Hide them! Put the  biggest ones where he  can not take
them. Look  around, where can  you put them, clever  She-howler? Bring
them here. Put  them beneath me. I  am a log. I do  not eat meat-nuts.
You can eat them when Pack-male is drinking. **
    The  howler looked  back and  forth from  Loric to  the Pack-male.
She  leaned forward  and sat  on the  snails. **No.  He will  see them
when the  pack moves. You are  clever She-howler, hide them  under me.
You can  eat them and pack-male  will not take them.  Look! Already he
has chased  your son up  a tree. Your son  will not get  any meat-nuts
to  eat.  Pack-male  is  eating  his  nuts.  He  will  come  for  your
meat-nuts...what can you do She-howler? **
    Loric  blinked sweat  out  of  his eyes  and  took  a long  silent
breath. The she-howler  looked around and walked over  to Loric' prone
body. She felt  under Loric's arm with a thin,  clawed hand. Her nails
scraped him  several times but he  put the pain behind  the wood-song.
There is  plenty of  room She-howler,  and I am  soft and  rotten. The
meat-nuts will get fat and juicy here. And pack-male won't eat them.
    The She-howler put  three snails in the hollow of  Loric's arm and
went  back to  her pile  of shells.  She looked  at the  pack-male and
then  back to  Loric.  Several times  she moved  toward  Loric and  he
stopped her with  a strong thought about Pack-male. Now  all he had to
do was get  the pack to move away  so he could get up  and stretch his
protesting muscles.
    It would  have been easy  to just get up  and scare the  pack away
or to  have killed She-howler when  she was in blade-reach,  but Loric
knew that  the Spirit was listening  to his wood-song and  gave it the
ability to  be understood  by the  forest. If he  ended his  song now,
with  death, it  could  sever  the bond  between  his  people and  the
Spirit of the Wood. And they would be lost.
    Loric watched the  pack move from tree to tree  searching for more
snails.  They would  move away  and drift  back. Never  going too  far
from the forests'  edge. He continued his wood-song trying  to get the
she-howler  to forget  about the  snails.  But she  would always  come
back and feel under his arm for the snails.
    'I am  weak Spirit,  I want to  eat these snails,  but I  will not
take them while She-howler can still claim them.

                    Show me a way to end the song.'

    The  howlers turned  as one  and  moved in  his direction,  having
scented  him and  saw him  for  what he  really was  during the  short
moment he was  distracted. The pack-male barked a  challenge and Loric
hurriedly picked  up the  strands of  the wood-song.  He did  not have
time  to try  and  spell  the pack-male,  so  he  concentrated on  the
she-howler, convincing  her that  the pack-male  had seen  her snails.
She ran ahead of  the male trying to beat him to  Loric, but he turned
instead to  chase her. The respite  was all Loric needed  to re-affirm
the  illusion of  a log.  But the  Pack-male was  agitated and  walked
around Loric,  sniffing and  biting at  his head.  The pain  was sharp
and bright  in his mind,  but desperation  drove him even  deeper into
the wood-song.  If he flinched  now the  powerful male would  rend him
into pieces  smaller than  meat-nuts. The male  could not  decide what
Loric  smelled like  so he  marked Loric  with a  spray from  his musk
pouch, kicked  a bit of  dirt onto Loric's  back and then  walked down
the  river bank.  His  actions made  it  clear to  the  pack that  the
mystery of  the log was over  and off limits.  In a moment or  two the
pack would  follow him to the  water's edge and they  would not return
to this spot. It was then that the chee'tar leapt into the clearing.

    For more  times than there  are rings  in a tree,  Silsia Tolorion
cursed the  recklessness that  made her leave  the Village-beneath-the
-Trees  without preparations.  To  avoid arousing  suspicion, she  had
taken only  a few ornaments of  mourning; A broadweave dyed  dark with
clay, a  few beads  made of  Keshwood, and  the wooden  whistle Oldsir
had made her.
    She  was supposedly  only  going  as far  as  Wood's  End, so  she
couldn't  justify the  provisions for  a long-walk  to Eadyie  or even
ask for  a Keshwood knife to  protect herself with. Eadyie  would have
sent one  of the men  in the village to  escort her--no doubt  one she
wanted Silsia  to dance  for. The  green-root she  had stuffed  in the
bottom of her slouchbag  was long gone as well as  the two quomo fruit
hidden away during the preparations for the next day's Shreaving.
    She took  refuge in the  trees and  avoided the paths  traveled by
the larger animals,  moving slowly in the direction  Oldsir's star had
gone.  It was  also  the direction  that held  Wood's  End, where  the
druid  Carson Feldspar  held  sway  over Wildwood.  The  thought of  a
single man guiding  the will of a forest frightened  her. Did it serve
him  or  he  serve  it?  What  noisy deaths  did  it  sing?  How  many
struggled and  withered while his  thoughts were elsewhere?  How could
a person's  spirit stand against a  land where everything had  a voice
of its own and gave heed or creedence to none?
    Here  in Silsia's  forest  the  Spirit of  the  Wood provided  the
harmony and the  song that all creatures sang. It  had been the rhythm
and reason behind  everything, and for as long as  man could remember,
it had fed her  people and kept them safe. Nothing  was asked of them,
save that  they also care  in return. It was  a circle as  the priests
explained  it; the  Spirit cared  for and  guided the  Upstem village,
and the Upstem  village cared for and guided the  Downland village and
they as a whole  cared for the forest. You sprang  from the forest and
lived in  harmony with it and,  when your song was  sung, you returned
to the forest.
    There had been  better times for the forest, and  what should have
been  easy  traveling  and   foraging  was  time-consuming  and  often
fruitless.   Her  slouch-bag   bulged   with  the   fleshy  heads   of
bread-plant; a  filling if not  very healthy-looking fungus  that grew
in the shadows of silent trees.
    Silsia  didn't care  for  their gritty  taste,  and they  provided
little in  the way of nourishment,  but the alternative was  even more
distasteful; an empty stomach.
    At  least  the  bread-plant  was proliferating,  there  seemed  to
Silisa  to be  more dead  trees than  she could  remember ever  seeing
near the  village. They were either  lying across her path  or leaning
heavily on their brothers, no longer able to sing for themselves.
    In places  it was like walking  in the wake of  a Djervish, seeing
the  results of  its  destruction, but  never  the destructor.  Silsia
could  not think  of  anything that  happened in  the  season past  to
cause so  many silent trees.  The winter had been  exceptionally cold,
but  that should  not have  killed the  fully grown  trees. Perhaps  a
Djervish did  walk these  woods. A shiver  of premonition  brought her
suddenly  back to  her surroundings.  She looked  about and  found she
had almost stumbled into a devatha.
    Child! she  admonished herself, Stumphead! The  only reason you're
alive is that it amuses the Spirit to observe your folly.
    The  odor of  wet mould  that always  accompanied living  devathas
had alerted  her when she  was daydreaming. Looking closely  she could
see the  ropey tendrils hanging from  the canopy of leaves  high above
her. The  devatha would have  been easy  to escape with  a kesh-knife,
she  thought bitterly,  but un-armed  as she  was she  could not  have
broken free at all.
    She  had  seen  the  devatha's  cruel  attentions  once  and  knew
exactly what  happened to  anything or anyone  unaware enough  to come
within its reach.  Its victims would be bound and  stung repeatedly by
one tentacle  while held fast  with the  others. Then they  were drawn
slowly upward  to the  waiting beak; a  bite on the  back of  the neck
ended any further  struggling, but did not kill. The  devatha left its
prey hanging  like quomo fruit,  full of the  juices it could  not get
from its host-tree. The death would be as slow as it would be certain.
    Thinking   that  she   would  feel   better  with   something  for
protection,  Silsia  looked  around  for a  weapon.  The  keshwood  is
forbidden  me,  and I  do  not  know the  song  for  keening its  edge
anyway. But  there must  be something  else as good,  or close  that I
can use?  I could  try making  a spear,  but I  do not  have a  way to
shape  the  tip. Sighing,  she  picked  up a  limb  that  was not  too
rotted, and hefted it meaningfully.
    With a  new sense of awareness  she moved in a  wide circle around
the devatha and into the lowlands beyond.

    Silisa was  deep into a  wooded valley when  it began to  rain and
she  moved into  the protection  of  a half-felled  tree. Parting  the
clinging  vines  that covered  it  like  a  curtain, she  entered  the
relative dryness  underneath. The  rain made its  own random  music on
the trees  above her  and was  echoed when  it made  it to  the ground
below. She  folded a  fusia leaf  and watched  as it  gradually filled
with water. Slowly  her attention pulled close about her,  and she let
herself be  taken away by  the reflections of  the beads of  water. It
brought her memories...memories of fire.
    Her  friend Yoni  was looking  at her  from across  the flames  in
surprise and  shock. "Silisa!  You don't  really mean  to take  one of
the  cauls?"  "Yess!"  She  whispered back.  Silsia  felt  deliciously
sneaky  and  daring,  both  by   shocking  her  friend  and  by  doing
something forbidden by  man. She and Yoni had spent  the whole morning
peeking  into Eadyie's  hut where  the  secret part  of the  Shreaving
preparations were hidden  from all but the Upstem  priests and Eadyie,
of course.
    After  what seemed  ages  of waiting  within  earshot of  Eadyie's
hut, Silsia  and Yoni slipped in  when Eadyie had left  with something
wrapped  in fur.  The single  large room  looked the  same, but  for a
pile of  goatskin and a large  black-wood bowl near the  cooking fire.
In  the bowl  was a  thin material,  all wrinkled  and folded  over on
itself. It  looked like  the goatskin, or  goat brains,  but stretched
impossibly thin, and  coated with an oily layer that  gave it the look
of being  fresh from  the animal.  Another skin  was hanging  from the
roof, drying in the heat from the cooking fire.
    Silsia reached out  and touched the drying skin, it  felt warm and
alive to  her touch,  it was like  the skin of  a lizard,  only pliant
and warm.  She saw  her shadow  dance on  the pearl-like  surface, and
looking through it she could she Yoni's nervous outline.
    Suddenly she  was moved  to action  and she  pulled the  caul from
the beam  and folded it  into a small bundle.  She tucked it  into the
top of  her sarong,  locking eyes with  Yoni as if  daring her  to say
anything.  It still  felt  warm and  alive, like  a  hand between  her
breasts,  a man's  hand.  With a  blush at  her  thoughts she  quickly
checked  outside  the hut  and  then  dashed  for the  riverbank,  the
astonished Yoni still in tow.

    It was  a stiffness in  her neck and  the gradual stopping  of the
rain's patter around  her that brought her back to  herself this time.
She smiled  at the  memory of Yoni's  face and  unconsciously clutched
the lump  between her  breasts. "Oh  Yoni, How  your eyes  would widen
now if you  knew what I was  about." Silsia stretched out  one leg and
then the  other and stood  up, pulling free  handfuls of vines  as she
went.  It seemed  to her  that no  time had  passsed at  all, but  she
could  tell by  the slanting  rays  of the  evening sun  that she  had
spent a good long time crouched beneath that tree.
    Almost  at once  two sounds  came  to her,  the distant  cry of  a
Chee'tar and  the very near  guttural challenge of a  wood-pig. Across
the  small clearing  she  could see  the outline  of  a creature  full
eight times her  weight, its snout lifted to show  its serrated tusks,
its red-pink eyes enflamed with rage.
    At first  fear did  not come  to her and  she stepped  forward and
said "Kom-beh,  tay-chee chee hai!"  The wood-pig snorted  and kneaded
the ground  with its forepaws.  The words  of warding rolled  over it,
but it did not flee.
    Wide-eyed, Silsia  tried to look  up at  the trees and  around her
feet for  signs that  the Spirit was  here. but there  was no  song on
the wind,  no constant  flittering at  the back  of her  mind. Somehow
she had passed beyond the forest--her forest, and into the Wildwood.
    Fear grabbed  her heart and  squeezed it tightly. She  felt around
her for  the forgotten  club she  had picked  up earlier  but couldn't
find it  within reach. The wood-pig  took one step, then  another then
charged her. It  held its porcine head low and  emitted a high-pitched
cry from deep within  it like that of a woman  in pain. Silsia reacted
blindly  and  leaped  backward  and  up  onto  the  fallen  tree.  The
wood-pig passed  beneath it, shreding  the vines like spider's  web as
it shook free and turned to attack again.
    Silsia ran  down the path she  had been following heedless  of the
scratches and gouges  from countless branches that sought  to hold her
back--to slow her down enough that the wood-pig could catch her.
    "Gorund de  nee-cha!" She growled  wunder her breath--"Get  out of
my  way!" She  could  hear the  wood-pig pursuing  her  but dared  not
spare a  glance behind her.  She followed the  trail and it  seemed to
become even more  close and resistant to her advance.  She was slapped
in the  face by a  thick broad leaf that  blinded her long  enough for
her to run into  a low limb. It took the breath  from her, but somehow
she  stumbled on.  "CROM VETH  NORLA TOVAY!!"  the path  beyond seemed
clear and  it gave her  a moment to wipe  the tears from  her smarting
eyes. She  saw a  wider path ahead  of her; the  trees leaned  away on
both sides as if they feared to block the trail.
    The  crash of  underbrush behind  her spurred  her down  the trail
before she  could question it,  but even with  a clear trail  she knew
the  wood-pig would  catch her.  Her breath  was a  fire and  her legs
jammed  blades of  saw-grass  into  her raw  nerves  with every  step.
"Spirit! "She  cried out, "my song  has been less than  true, judge me
not too harshly for I fear I am about to greet you!"
    She charged blindly  as sweat blurred her vison,  adding a burning
that  she hardly  noticed. Ahead  of her  a figure  broke free  of the
shadows--or perhaps it  was a stilla shadow or even  a dead tree-- she
couldn't stop herself in time to tell, or even cry out.
    Her headlong rush  was suddenly cut short by an  arm that shot out
and held her fast. She doubled over and blew out a loud breath.
    "Shade of the  Ancient Oak!" a voice  bellowed,"--a child!" Silsia
tried to retort 'I'm  not a child!' but could only  gasp and mouth her
words. If the man  had not been holding her, she  would have fallen to
the ground.  She tried to  twist free and look  at her captor  but his
grip  was like  the strongest  limbs  and she  had no  energy left  to
fight.  Suddenly he  seemed  to  become aware  of  the  charge of  the
wood-pig towards them.  He dropped Silsia without a word  and held his
staff over his  head. Then slowly he muttered to  himself and gestured
at the  wood-pig. The pig  tripped and slid on  its belly, got  up and
tried to  charge again,  but vines  and roots held  it down.  It cried
its  outrage and  tore at  the vines  with its  tusks. The  vines gave
away, but each time it moved closer, more took their place.
    "Come  on child!"  the man  said, "We  can be  far away  before he
gets beyond  my Circle  of Restraint."  With that  he strode  into the
woods with big  ground-covering strides. Silsia had  hardly gotten her
breath when she found herself laboring to keep up.
    "W-wait! Please, I've got to rest!"
    "Sorry  little one--there's  a rouge  druid loose  in my  wood and
this is no place for a girl-child to be playing."
    Silsia's response  was lost  on his  rapidly disapearing  back. If
she didn't  stay close she  would lose him  in the gathering  dusk. So
she followed doggedly and held her tounge. For now.

    It was  a tribute  to Loric's grandfather,  and to  Loric himself,
that  he did  not jump  up  and try  to  run the  moment the  chee'tar
arrived. It would  have been the last action he  would have ever made.
The chee'tar took  no notice of him and chased  several of the howlers
to  the river's  edge  cutting off  their easy  escape  to the  trees.
Loric  saw  that  it was  the  female  howler  and  one of  the  young
males--perhaps her own, that faced death in the form of the chee'tar.
    Loric had  a reluctantly clear view  of the tableau. He  could see
the fear  in the  howler's eyes,  the hungry  pacing of  the chee'tar,
its  very stance  implicitly  announcing  that it  knew  its prey  was
trapped. A  deadly game of  advance and  retreat began as  the howlers
would back all  the way to the  water's edge and then  having no where
to go would bluff  and charge the chee'tar into backing  up a bit. The
sight would  have been thought  funny if Loric  had not known  how the
dance would have  to end. Caring little for getting  wet, the chee'tar
was only waiting  for the howlers to  break for the trees.  He did not
know  a song  for taming  chee'tars, no  one in  his village  had ever
tried and then returned to tell about it.
    A stray movement  on his part could send the  chee'tar running, or
it could  just as easily  make it attack him.  Loric knew that  if the
chee'tar didn't  make a decision soon,  he would have to.  The wave of
energy that  flooded his stomach had  gone sour, bringing with  it the
realization  that  the howlers  would  be  free  if  he had  not  been
weaving  his spell  at them.  It  was his  responsibilty. Finally  his
energy spent  and he his legs  trembling despite his best  efforts, he
decided that  bluffing would  at least  give the  howlers a  chance to
get away,  and with  the Spirit's  good will,  he would  make it  up a
tree also.
    Loric waited  until the  chee'tar paced directly  in front  of him
and  then sprang  up howling  and waving  his arms  wildly about.  The
chee'tar  whipped  around and  backed  up  several feet  snarling  and
crouching  on powerfull  hind legs.  It bellowed  out a  challenge and
Loric  stomped his  feet  and  shouted "Hi!  Go  Bomcha Chee'tar!  Kei
Kei!" The  chee'tar seemed to flinch  at the words of  warding but did
not  run.  Instead it  un-coiled  its  lenght  in  a long  arc  toward
Loric's  head;  claws extended  and  white  fangs standing  out  stark
against its ebony fur.

    Loric  dropped to  his  knees and  slashed  across the  chee'tar's
belly as it  passed over him. He felt white-hot  fire pierce his skull
as the  chee'tar kicked down  and raked  his scalp. Screaming  in pain
and outrage  it turned to attack  again and saw Loric  leaping for the
lower branches.  It leapt  also, but  the branch  would not  hold them
both and  they fell together in  a flurry of leaves,  claws and flesh.
Loric slashed out  at the direction of  the pain and was  unsure if he
had  struck  the chee'tar  or  the  treelimb.  He  was pinned  to  the
treetrunk by a heavy limb and too stunned to even try to break free.
    Blood  ran into  Loric's  eyes  and he  heard  more  than saw  the
chee'tar struggling  to get free of  the limb as well.  It broke free,
then started  rolling and rubbing its  flank on the ground,  trying to
dislodge a short length of limb impaled in its flank.
    Quickly Loric  wiped his eyes  with a leaf  and broke off  a sharp
stick that  was jabbing  his chest. He  leaned to the  side as  far as
the limb would allow,  took aim and prayed to the  Spirit to guide his
hand.  He threw  in-expertly, and  the stick  bounced off  the enraged
chee'tar's  head. It  forgot the  pain  and charged  Loric again,  who
braced  his arm  against  the  trunk and  hoped  the  impact would  be
enough  to  drive  the blade  home.  There  was  a  loud thud  as  the
feline's hurtling bulk  hit Loric full force, and  then Loric's scream
of pain  joined that of the  chee'tar. The kesh-blade was  jerked from
his grasp and the  breath wheezed out of him in one  loud ooff! as the
limb abruptly broke free and dropped him to the ground.
    The  chee'tar   charged  into   the  bush  blindly   snapping  and
screaming  whenever  the  branch  in   its  side  would  snag  on  the
undergrowth.  Loric  slumped  and  leaned  against  the  tree,  trying
desperately to  summon enough strenght  to follow the chee'tar  and to
force  air  back  into  his  lungs. He  heard  the  chee'tar  at  some
distance,  and  by  following  the   sound,  he  found  the  dislodged
kesh-blade, and further  on the piece of wood. The  trail led over the
side of  the gorge, and at  the bottom Loric found  the chee'tar lying
on it's  side, it's fur matted  and dark with their  blood, its yellow
eyes were fierce in the darkness, full of pain, full of hate.
    Loric tried  to get close  enough to the  beast to finish  it off,
but the chee'tar  would rally at his approach, each  time roaring with
less ferocity.  Loric decided that  the chee'tar would die  soon enuff
and wearily  tried to  climb a  nearby tree.  With his  vision blurred
and his  footing unsure, he could  only brace himself on  in the crook
of two lower limbs  and wait for the Spirit to  claim the chee'tar. He
pulled  some leaves  to press  against  his throbbing  wounds and  was
unconscious before his hand was half-way to his head.
