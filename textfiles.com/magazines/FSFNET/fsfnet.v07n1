    Well,  greetings, all,  and welcome  to the  new year!  This is  a
notable time of  year, for three reasons. Firstly, we  are beginning a
new  volume,  number  seven.  Secondly,   we  are  marking  the  first
anniversary  of   the  Dargon  Project,  which   has  been  remarkably
successful.  And, finally,  it was  two years  ago that FSFnet's first
issue was sent out. So please excuse any sentimentality which follows.
    As we  enter our third year  of publication, I'd like  to send out
some very  special thanks  to everyone involved  in the  production of
the magazine.  Without their aid, FSFnet  would not have seen  the end
of the  first semester. I'd  also like  to thank those  who distribute
the  magazine onto  other  networks,  and who  knows  where else  (*I*
certainly don't)!  And, of  course, I'd like  to thank  the readership
for their  interest and support.  That's what it's all  about. Special
thanks  go  to  Joseph  Curwen,  Jim Owens,  Chuq  von  Rospach,  Mike
Murphy, Alan Clegg, Chris Condon, and Bob Boag.
    Well, enough  of the sentimentality.  Thank you, one and  all, for
making the zine a success. Best wishes, one and all.

                          If Looks Could Kill
    It  was already  late afternoon  and Tara  n'ha Sansela  estimated
that she  still had close  to three or  four leagues to  travel before
reaching Tench.  She didn't want  to stop,  but her horse,  Boxter was
an older animal, and  it was obvious that the rapid  pace she had been
forcing him  to go  was beginning  taking its  toll. At  the top  of a
hill, she  dismounted, leading  Boxter over  to a  tree, and  took the
opportunity to rest  herself in the cool shade. As  she sat down, Zed,
her pet Shivaree,  trotted over and curled up  beside her, immediately
falling  asleep. The  big  ferret-like creature  wasn't accustomed  to
running all  day. Several times Tara  had lifted him up  to the saddle
with her so he could catch his breath as they had traveled.
    It had  been two days  since her  parents were killed  by bandits,
and Tara still  hadn't managed to grasp the reality  of her situation.
It all seemed  like a dream. Each  morning, she woke up  with the idea
that it  would all be over,  and she would  be back in the  small farm
cottage where  she had  lived her whole  life. But it  was not  to be.
The cottage was  now little more than ashes and  her parents were both
dead. She'd  buried them herself in  their old cellar and  set out for
Tench, where she hoped  to find a guide or at least  a map which would
get her to Dargon and to her uncle's.
    As Tara sat  under the tree, she surveyed the  countryside. It was
still  green, but  there was  a chill  in the  morning air.  The snows
would come  soon. As Tara  scanned the  horizon, which held  clouds in
the  threat of  an evening  storm, she  noticed some  activity in  the
valley. In  the middle of a  clearing stood a fortress,  surrounded by
several  cultivated  fields and  three  oval  tracks. Looking  closer,
Tara could see  people scattered about, and as they  moved, she caught
the glint of  metal reflected in the evening sun.  Tara had never seen
so many people  in armor. Surely this  was an army camp  of some kind.
It was  hard to see,  but the people down  on the clearings  seemed to
be training, although  some could also be seen tending  fields. It was
all very  interesting,and Tara would  have liked  to stay and  watch a
little longer, but she  knew she had taken up as  much time resting as
she could afford. She would have a hard time making Tench by sunset.
    Tara had been afraid  that she had lost her way  in the dark until
she finally  spotted a  group of  lights, revealing  Tench's location.
The town was  nestled in between large, tree-covered hills,  and had a
small river running  through it. Riding down towards  the lights, Tara
was glad  this leg of  the trip was finally  over. It would  feel good
to have  a bed to sleep  in again. It would  also feel good to  have a
chance to  be around other  people, even  if they were  strangers. The
last two days had been lonely ones.
    Tench was little  more than a cross-roads town. As  Tara rode down
the main  road which provided  Tench with  most of its  travelers, the
few  buildings she  saw  were  either inns  or  taverns, with  stables
tucked away behind  them. She did notice a small  dwelling or two, but
from the looks of things, Tench had very few permanent residents.
    Tara had expected  the streets of the town to  be almost deserted.
In the  few tiny villages  located near  Tara's old home,  people went
to bed  shortly after sundown, raucous  laughter came from one  of the
nearby  taverns, and  several people  were wandering  up and  down the
road. Few  of them  took notice  of Tara, although  some took  time to
glance  suspiciously  at  this  strange girl  rider  with  a  Shivaree
trotting behind her.
    Tara was  looking the town over,  and she didn't see  the man step
in front  of her.  The horse  bumped him  in the  back, and  he turned
around  and snarled,  "Watch  where  yer goin',  or  I'll--" Then  the
man's face changed  from arrogance to fear, and his  voice softened as
he apologized, "I'm sorry  M'Lady. If I'd o' known it  was you, I'd o'
never...." And then he turned and walked hurriedly away.
    Tara had  started to  apologize to  the man, but  he had  left too
quickly.  His change  of attitude  was also  very puzzling.  He didn't
seem like  the apologizing type.  Too tired  to worry it,  Tara turned
her attention back to finding a place to stay for the night.
    The next inn  Tara found was in an old  well-worn building, but it
was well lit.  Tara read the sign  above the door: The  Lame Duck Inn.
It didn't look  like much of an  inn, but at least  the nearest tavern
was  almost out  of  earshot, so  she would  get  some sleep  tonight.
Cheered by that fact, Tara tied Boxter to a post and went inside.
    The  room was  dimly lit  and had  a stale,  musty odor.  A small,
balding, round-faced  man was bent  over a sheet of  parchment, making
a scratch here and  there as he counted on his  fingers. Tara shut the
door and walked to the counter. The small man didn't seem to notice.
    "Hello," Tara said shyly.
    "Evenin'."
    "Could  I get  a room?"  The  man did  not answer,  but seemed  to
count a little more furiously on his fingers. "Hello?"
    "Yes, yes, yes,"  the man muttered, recounting  his fingers. "You,
uh, wanted a room?"
    "Yes, if you have one."
    "We do  have one,"  the little  man said, and  then he  looked up,
and his face  immediately brightened. "Why didn't you say  it was you?
Tryin' to  fool me  again, were  ya? I thought  you were  just another
traveler come to interrupt my bookwork."
    Tara  put a  puzzled look  on her  face. Then  she answered,  "You
must have mistaken me for someone else. My name is Tara n'ha Sansela."
    "Oh, I see," the inkeeper laughed. "It's Sarah this time, is it?"
    "No, Tara. Tara n'ha Sansela."
    "Ah, good.  I will try to  remember." Then the little  man laughed
again. "Your usual room, uh, Tara?"
    "My usual room?"
    "Yes, the corner room at the top of the stairs."
    "Whatever you have."
    "Fine, fine,"  the little man  beamed. "Boy! Boy!" The  little man
grumbled  to himself,  and stomped  around impatiently  for a  moment.
Then he  disappeared into  the back  room, and when  he came  back, he
was carrying a young  boy by the back of the neck,  which he tossed in
front of the counter.  "Take her horse to the stable,  boy, and get to
it!" The  boy was little more  than skin and bones,  and bruises could
be seen  on his cheeks  and arms. Tara  started to say  something, but
then checked  herself. This was  no time  to get involved.  The little
boy said nothing,  but stared sleepily at the man.  Then he rubbed the
sleep from his eyes on his way out the door.
    The innkeeper  had noticed Zed.  "What's this?" he  asked, putting
his  hand out  towards Zed.  The shivaree  growled, baring  his teeth,
and the  man quickly pulled his  hand back, putting it  in his pocket.
"Never mind,"  he blurted out  before Tara could answer.  "Normally we
don't allow  animals to stay  in the  room," he continued,  "but since
he's yours, I'll make an exception."
    Tara just  nodded an acknowledgement,  and then she headed  up the
stairs. As  she reached  the top  step, the  innkeeper called  to her,
"You never  did fool  me. Not this  time. The animal  is a  new twist,
though."  Tara  thought  about  answering, and  then  decided  to  let
things lie as they were and disappeared into her room.
    Once inside,  she pulled off  her boots,  and layed back  onto the
bed to  rest a  moment. Zed  jumped up  beside her,  curled up  into a
ball,  and was  immediately asleep.  Tara knew  she needed  sleep, but
too many things  were bouncing around inside her head.  The inn keeper
seemed  to recognize  her and  even gave  her special  treatment, even
though she'd  never seen  the man  before in her  life. Also,  Zed was
always friendly,  but he  almost bit  the man's  hand. And  what about
the boy?  And the stranger she'd  bumped in the street?  Tara's turned
over the thoughts in her mind as she lay on the bed.
    Zed rolled over sleepily and settled his head on Tara's belly.

    Tara  sat up  in bed.  Midmorning daylight  was streaming  through
the window.  She was  disoriented for a  moment before  she remembered
where  she  was, but  she  didn't  remember  going  to bed.  Then  she
realized she  was still fully  dressed. Quickly  she put on  her boots
and made  sure she  still had the  small bag of  gold attached  to her
belt. As soundly  as she'd slept, she  was glad no thief  had taken it
in the night.  Then Tara walked to  the door. Zed trotted  up from the
corner, expecting to  go along. After thinking a  moment, Tara ordered
him to stay, pushing him back from the door with her foot as she left.
    Several minutes  later, Tara  was sitting  at a  table downstairs,
eating  the  best   breakfast  she'd  had  since   leaving  home.  The
innkeeper had  given her breakfast for  free, but when Tara  asked him
to have  someone take care  of Zed  for the day,  he agreed to  do so,
but it  cost her several extra  copper pieces. When Tara  finished her
meal, she went to find the things she would need to get her to Dargon.
    Tara soon discovered  that it was easy to find  supplies, but that
they weren't  so easy  to buy. Everything  was over-priced,  and after
purchasing  a  warm  cloak,  dried  food, a  couple  of  water  skins,
another blanket,  and some  bones and  meat scraps  for Zed,  she only
had half her gold  left. She also found guides who  were eager to take
her to Dargon, but  not for the amount of gold she  had to offer. They
did tell  her that  the road  to Dargon  was fairly  well-traveled and
she  could find  her  own way  there,  if she  lived  that long.  They
portrayed many  dangers of the  road for  a girl traveling  alone, but
Tara listened to  them with her father's teachings firmly  in mind. As
he used  to say,  "Those preaching  loudest about  the dangers  of the
night are the ones selling lanterns."
    It was  afternoon before Tara had  finished all her tasks  and had
started back  to the inn. Her  arms were laden with  her supplies, but
she felt  good. Things were going  as planned, except for  the message
she had wanted  to send to her  uncle to let him know  she was coming.
Such  a message  had turned  out  to be  too expensive  and too  slow.
There  was the  chance  she might  be in  Dargon  before the  message.
Then, suddenly,  someone stepped  in front  of Tara,  gave her  a bear
hug  and planted  a  passionate  kiss on  her  lips.  Tara was  caught
completely  off-guard  and dropped  everything,  but  as soon  as  she
recovered,  she  slapped  both  hands  onto  the  man's  head  and  he
immediately  let go  with a  yelp. "Yeoww!  What'd you  do that  for?"
Tara  didn't  reply,  but  drew  her sword  instead,  holding  him  at
sword's distance.  "What's wrong?"  he asked. "You  said you'd  see me
as  soon as  you  came back,  and  then  I find  you  out roaming  the
streets, so I come to welcome you back, and you attack me?"
    "You are wrong," Tara told him. "You attacked me."
    "No, Honey, I didn't. . . ."
    Tara cut  him short  with a poke  of her sword  in his  belly. She
didn't hurt  him, but it  was enough to  change his plans.  He quickly
mumbled an  apology, and  walked away through  the crowd  which always
formed  when ever  a fight  broke out.  When it  was over,  the people
also dispersed,  leaving Tara alone to  gather up her things.  She was
shaking and  had trouble hanging onto  things, but she managed  to get
back to the inn without further incidents.
    Once in  her room, Tara  calmed down,  and then realized  that she
was  hungry. She  decided to  get some  supper and  try to  figure out
whether the  man that attacked her  made an honest mistake  or whether
he had just  tried to protect himself after seeing  her reaction. When
Tara went  downstairs, she was  told that  the inn didn't  serve meals
in the evening, but  there was a good tavern just  down the street and
around the corner, so Tara set off in that direction.
    The tavern  served her  a good  meal. It  was a  little expensive,
but everything  in Tench was  more expensive  than what Tara  was used
to. She  ordered some  of the  strong, bitter ale  that was  common in
this country,  and found that she  couldn't stand to drink  it, so she
had it  taken away  and replaced with  a mug of  a sweet  cider. Then,
after  finishing her  meal,  she decided  to sit  and  relax a  little
before  heading back  to the  inn.  It was  going  to be  a long  time
before she had the chance to socialize with people again.
    The tavern  had been empty when  Tara had arrived, but  now it was
crowded,  and Tara  enjoyed  looking  at so  many  different kinds  of
people. Then she noticed  that one of them was looking  at her. He was
a tall man  with a powerful body  and hair blacker than  ashes. He was
also  a  handsome,  noble-looking  man, but  his  eyes  were  strange.
Hard-grey eyes, their  stare chilled to the bone. As  she watched, the
man said  something to  the serving  wench, gave her  a few  coins and
stood up. He's  coming over here, Tara realized  suddenly. She quickly
pulled  out enough  gold  to cover  her meal,  and  wrapped her  cloak
around her as she  headed for the door. The last  thing she needed was
another event  similar to what had  happened to her earlier  that day.
She didn't  bother looking back as  she rushed out, shutting  the door
behind her.
    She  only made  it fifty  yards before  several rough-looking  men
sprang  from  around  a  corner  and  surrounded  her,  drawing  their
swords. A short,  stocky man with a mouth that  wore a constant sneer,
blocked Tara's path.
    "You made  a big  mistake comin'  back here, or  are you  still so
scratchy that you  think you can't be beat?" Tara  tried to speak, but
failed to  find her  tongue. "This  time you will  not live,"  the man
snarled and  started towards her,  motioning for  the other men  to do
the same.
    "You're making a mistake," Tara blurted out, drawing her sword."
    "Not this time,"  the man told her confidently. "Last  we met, you
managed to  walk away with all  my money. You  made a fool out  of me.
Now  you will  die." With  that,  the man  swung his  sword at  Tara's
head. She  managed to block the  blow, but it sent  her sword sailing.
Quickly, she ducked  under the man's second blow and  tried to escape,
but all she  managed to do was trap herself  between her attackers and
a wall  of a  building. Slowly  the group closed  in. There  were five
brutes in  all, and the  burly man who had  talked before let  an evil
sneer  of a  smile crawl  across  his face.  "I will  enjoy this,"  he
beamed,  raising his  sword  for  the death  blow.  Then,  just as  he
started the sword  forward, a powerful hand wrapped  around the wrist,
squeezing so  tight, the  man let  out a painful  cry and  dropped the
sword. Then  he was  knocked to the  ground. It was  the man  from the
inn. He seemed almost to glow. This man was comfortable in battle.
    The  other  four  brutes  were  stunned for  a  moment,  but  they
quickly recovered.  Two on each side  of the man attacked  at the same
time, but  he glided smoothly  out of the  way, causing them  to clash
swords. Then,  in the blink  of an eye, he  had disarmed one  and sent
the  other sprawling  to the  ground. As  the other  two attacked,  he
again avoided their  blows, sending one to the ground  with a push and
swatting  the other  in the  side of  the head  with the  flat of  his
sword. He  took a step back,  ready for another assault,  but all save
one of  the attackers  grabbed their weapons  and scrambled  away down
the  alley.  The  remaining  one   was  on  the  ground,  unconscious,
bleeding a little where he had been struck.
    Tara stood  in awe a moment  before she recovered enough  to thank
the man.  Then she picked up  her sword, resheathed it,  and admitted,
"I'd be dead now if it wasn't for you."
    "Yes, you would."
    Tara was  surprised by  his frankness.  "Thanks anyway."  Then she
added, pointing to the man on the ground, "He isn't dead, is he?"
    "No. He will have a headache when he awakes. That is all."
    "Why didn't you kill them?"
    "I only kill when I must. These men couldn't harm me."
    "But there were five of them."
    "Yes, I believe  there was." Then he managed a  smile. "My name is
Sir Morion," he said, taking her hand.
    "I am Tara n'ha Sansela. Where did you learn to fight like that?"
    "That  is a  long story,"  he replied,  his eyes  growing distant.
"Instead I  should learn  of who I  saved. Come, we  can talk  while I
escort you home."
    "You can't  take me home,"  Tara said  sadly, "but I'm  staying at
the Lame Duck Inn." They started down the street.
    "You are very  foolish to wander about  these streets, unescorted,
after dark,  when you  cannot protect  yourself," Morion  scolded her.
"The sword  you wear implies you  can fight. That's a  bluff that will
only keep an honest and sober man from bothering you.
    "But I wasn't bluffing." Tara explained. "I didn't know better."
    Morion seemed unimpressed by her naivete. "Where are you from?"
    "From a  farm near Myridon."  Tara saw Morion's  blank expression,
so she  continued, "It's a small  village about sixty leagues  east of
here. I came  here because--" Tara paused, and then  changed her mind.
"I'm headed to  Dargon to live with  my uncle. I don't  know why those
men attacked  me. One of  them said  something about getting  even for
the last time we'd met, but I've never seen him before."
    "Perhaps they mistook you for Lana."
    "Lana?"
    "I almost  did myself, but  after watching  you a little  while it
was obvious that you weren't Lana."
    "Who is Lana?"
    "You are too  quiet and shy. Too well-behaved. You  didn't fool me
for long at all, but then, I know Lana better than most."
    "Who. Is. Lana?" Tara asked, stamping her foot.
    "She's  a  bandit  and  assassin   who  you  greatly  resemble  in
appearance. She kills  and steals in her travels and  then she returns
to Tench to  hide, usually in disguise and under  an alias name, until
whoever she has  wronged has stopped searching for  her. I'm surprised
more people haven't mistook you for her."
    "Ah,  I  understand," Tara  said,  her  face brightening.  "That's
what's  been happening.  The  innkeeper, the  man  who kissed  me--now
things make sense!"
    "Yes, well,  I would  advise that you  exercise caution  while you
are  in Tench.  Many people  know Lana  here. Some  will be  friendly.
Others will not."
    Tara thought  about that for  a minute,  and then she  asked, "How
do you know Lana so well?"
    "Everyone in Tench knows of Lana."
    Unsatisfied,  Tara prodded  him, "You  said you  knew Lana  better
than most.  If I  have to wear  her face, I'd  like to  know something
about her."
    Morion put  a nasty  look on  his face and  his eyes  grew distant
again.  He shook  his head  and remained  silent. Then  he sighed.  "I
will  tell you  the story  since you  have a  reason to  know." Morion
gather his thoughts  before he continued, "I run a  school about three
leagues north west of here."
    "That  must be  the army  camp I  saw yesterday  on my  way here,"
Tara blurted out.
    "Actually, it's  a Citadel containing a  school," Morion corrected
her. In  any case,  Lana came  to my  school four  years ago.  She was
very young, but she  had potential and money, so she  became one of my
students.  For  almost  two  years,  she was  trained  in  methods  of
fighting and  fitness. She  was always  a very  good learner,  but she
was  also always  a trouble  maker. Every  chance she  had, she  would
travel here  to drink.  Always a  fight would  break out.  Always more
men  were killed.  One  night  Lana--" Morion  stopped  a moment,  his
emotions catching  up to him, but  it quickly passed. "I  do not train
my students to kill for no reason. I expelled Lana from my school."
    "She sounds terrible."
    "She's  not bad  to  everyone.  Just those  who  cannot help  her.
Actually, she can  be a very nice,  sweet girl when she  wishes it so,
but I think she is too full of hate."
    "What's  wrong with  her? I  mean, how  could a  girl do  anything
like that?"
    "I'm  not  sure," Morion  said  thoughtfully,  "but when  she  was
drunk  one night,  she told  me  she never  knew her  father, and  her
mother was a serving  wench at one of the local inns  who used to take
men--" Morion cut off the thought. "How old are you?"
    "Seventeen."
    "You  look   older.  Let's  just   say  Lana  had  a   very  rough
childhood." As  Morion finished  his story, they  arrived at  the Lame
Duck  Inn. "You  will  be safe  now. Please  don't  travel after  dark
without  an escort  again." "I  won't. Thanks  again." Then  as Morion
started to  leave, Tara pulled some  gold out of the  pouch around her
waist. "Please take  this as a reward  for you help. I  can't give you
much, but--"
    "No  thank you,"  Morion interrupted.  "I could  not accept  money
for an act of kindness."
    "Please take it," Tara pleaded.
    "No!" Morion  growled, spinning  on his  heel and  walking quickly
away  into the  dark.  Tara  was confused  by  his  reaction, but  she
shrugged  her shoulders  and put  the coins  away before  heading into
the inn for the night.

    Tara  was up  early the  next morning,  eager to  get started  for
Dargon. After  she had saddled  up Boxter  and given Zed  something to
eat, she was  ready to go. Making sure she  hadn't forgotten anything,
she rode  out of the stables,  and found a cloaked  rider blocking her
path. Tara  tried to ride around,  but the rider grabbed  the reins of
her horse, pulling Tara up short.
    "Let  me  go," Tara  demanded,  raising  her head  defiantly.  The
rider  let  loose   a  defiant  laugh.  Then,  as   Tara's  face  grew
perplexed,  the  rider said  in  a  feminine  voice, "So,  they  spoke
truthfully. I do  have a twin." With that, the  rider pulled her cloak
away from her  head. Tara gasped. She was looking  an image of herself
in the other saddle.
    "I hope you have had fun, Sister."
    "I don't  know what you  mean," Tara  replied, trying to  pull the
reins away from the rider.
    "You have done  quite a job of ruining Lana's  good name in Tench.
It's  all over  town that  I couldn't  defend myself  last night.  The
story  claims I  had to  have some  man save  me." Lana  made an  ugly
face, and then  she spit, as if  the words had left a  bitter taste in
her mouth.  "Now every horny, drunk,  or greedy man will  think he can
treat me  as he would  any other woman. My  reputation was all  I had,
and  it was  much too  valuable to  allow some  miserable little  girl
with a nose like mine to destroy it in one night!"
    "But it wasn't  my fault," Tara explained. "I told  them they were
making a mistake."
    Lana  seemed not  to hear.  "Do  you know  what I'm  going to  do,
Sister?" she  asked in  her sweet  voice. "I'm going  to cut  off your
head and  hang it  from my saddle.  Then people will  know I  am Lana,
the  Snake,  to  be  feared."  Tara  was  frightened  now  and  looked
desperately around  for help, but  although a few people  had gathered
to watch, none  looked willing to get involved.  Franticly, Tara tried
to  pull the  ruins  away.  Lana held  the  reins  tight and  casually
planted  a foot  in  Tara's  chest, knocking  her  to  the ground  and
letting loose another laugh.
    As  Tara  lay on  the  ground,  desperately  trying to  catch  her
breath, Lana  jumped down  beside her.  Then she  grabbed Tara  by the
hair and  yanked her to  her feet. "You  really are a  wretched little
creature,"  Lana told  her, pulling  on Tara's  hair to  keep her  off
balance.  "You don't  deserve  to wear  my face,  do  you?" Tara  just
whined.  She felt  like  her scalp  was bleeding  where  her hair  was
being pulled.  Lana didn't  seemed satisfied,  and she  pulled harder.
"I asked you a question, Sister."
    Tara let out  another yelp of pain, and then  she managed to reach
up and  claw Lana's face. "You  little bitch," Lana swore,  letting go
of the hair  and reaching for her sword. Tara  backed away, dizzy from
the pain, and grabbed her own sword from where it had fallen.
    "Good.  At least  you are  woman  enough to  die honorably."  Then
Lana  stepped forward  and casually  flipped her  wrist, knocking  the
sword  out of  Tara's  hand.  "And you  will  die,"  Lana taunted  her
before  almost  leisurely swinging  her  sword  in a  horizontal  line
across Tara's belly. Tara  was trying to move out of  the way when the
sword  grazed across  her stomach,  just  below her  breasts, and  she
tripped and  fell over backwards. Although  the pain from the  cut was
terrible,  the amount  of blood  oozing down  her ribs  told Tara  she
wasn't hit  bad enough to kill  her. She looked frantically  about for
her sword, spying  it a few feet  away, but she never had  a chance to
get to  it. Lana  had grabbed her  by the hair  again, pulling  her up
enough to  expose her throat. Apparently,  she was going to  make good
on her original threat.
    Then, Tara  heard a  low, gutteral sound  as something  flashed by
her face.  Lana let  go, and  Tara rolled  away, hearing  Lana cursing
and  fighting. Tara  managed to  sit up  enough to  look over  and saw
that Lana was  on her back, her  sword several feet away,  and she was
trying in  vain to  fend off the  attack of a  large furry  animal. It
was Zed.
    Lana managed  to pull out her  dagger and swiped at  the Shivaree.
she missed  her mark,  but did manage  to take off  an ear,  which put
Zed into  a complete fury.  He mutilated  Lana's arm, and  she dropped
the  dagger, crying  out  in pain.  Then  she felt  the  bones in  her
shoulder crush as Zed worked his way, biting, toward the throat.
    "Stop  him, help  me! Call  him off!"  Lana was  pleading for  her
life now, and Tara  had recovered enough to call to  Zed. At first, he
continued to  maul Lana, but then,  when Tara called again,  he sprang
back,  growling, blood  dripping from  his mouth.  Tara never  dreamed
Zed  could  do anything  like  that.  She  called  him again,  and  he
trotted over to her as if nothing had happened.
    Lana was  still alive. She  was covered  with blood, and  her left
arm, which was  her fighting arm, was almost shredded.  With her right
hand, Lana pushed  herself up to a sitting position.  Tara walked over
to  help her,  but  Lana fended  off the  assistance  with a  menacing
gesture. "Get away  from me, you slut," she  growled, dragging herself
to her  feet. Then she hobbled  over to her sword  and dagger, leaving
a  trail of  blood. After  getting  her weapons,  Lana turned  towards
Tara, "This  is not  the end,  Sister. You  will not  live to  see the
Spring, and  the next time  we meet, your animal  will not be  able to
save you." Then Lana pushed her way through the crowd and was gone.
    The crowd  that had formed to  watch the fight had  not dispersed,
but were  shuffling in closer  to Tara.  Many of them  seemed troubled
by  the outcome  and several  were glaring  at her.  Tara was  shaking
now,  and  all she  wanted  to  do was  to  get  away. She  was  still
bleeding, and  so was Zed,  but she knew  she couldn't stay  here. She
managed to  fight off the  pain long enough to  lift both her  and Zed
to the  saddle. Then,  with a  touch of her  heels to  Boxter's sides,
she found her way through the crowd to the edge of town.
    Tara  dismounted and  found her  old  tunic, which  she tore  into
bandages. She tied  the large one around her torso,  and she used some
of the smaller  strips to bandage Zed's  head. It was not  a very good
job,  but it  would serve  to stop  the bleeding  until she  made camp
that night.  Once again, Tara  heaved herself and  Zed back on  to the
horse, and they headed out of town.
    As Tara struggled  in the early morning sun to  fight off the pain
and dizziness  just to  stay in the  saddle, she made  a wish  for the
rest of her journey to be much less eventful.

                             Glasmelyn Llaw
                        Part Five:  The Problem
    Je'en followed  Maks, who followed  Cefn, up the spiral  stairs of
the  fifth  and  tallest  turret.   Previous  turret  rooms  had  been
outfitted as sun  rooms, studies, or libraries, but the  last one they
came to  was very  different. Cefn  recognized various  trappings that
indicated  it had  once been  a laboratory,  but it  no longer  served
that function. The  walls were draped in heavy,  black cloth, covering
the windows that  certainly pierced the outer wall of  the turret. But
it wasn't dark  here, either. The same pallid green  light filled this
room,  and  the  source  was  obvious:  the  thing  that  sat  on  the
massively built table in the center of the room.
    The sight  of the thing  on the  table obviously confirmed  all of
Cefn's suspicions,  but Je'en and  Maks' attentions were drawn  to the
two  figures in  the room.  Against  one wall,  a low  table had  been
draped  with some  sort  of  silvery cloth,  and  a  black candle  and
holder  had been  placed  at each  corner. On  that  table, naked  and
lying supine, was  a lovely young woman who Maks'  moan told Je'en had
to be Syusahn.  She was breathing very shallowly, and  her skin seemed
to be very pale,  although that was hard to truly  tell in the strange
light. Standing by  the table, near Syusahn's head, was  the shadow of
a young man, or  something like a shadow. It had the  form of a medium
height, thin,  red-haired man, wearing  a strange clothes, but  it was
translucent - they could see the covered wall through the figure.
    Maks'  moan attracted  the  attention of  the  shadow-man, and  it
turned to  face the  three intruders. Je'en  nearly flinched  from the
raving madness in the washed-out grey eyes.
    When  it spoke,  its  voice  was like  a  whisper,  but it  echoed
strangely  in the  room,  so all  could hear.  "So,  more new  friends
brought to  me by my Hand?  The woman one  can stay, but you  two must
flee, or  I will  not like  you, and you  will die.  Ha ha!  Two women
ones! So long  alone, and now two  woman ones. When the  short one has
joined me out of her body, then it will be your turn, masked one.
    "Well,  you two,  what are  you waiting  for? Get  out! I  think I
don't like you. You better get out, before my Hand kills you!"
    Maks had  not stopped  staring at  his love on  the table,  and at
the  shadow's  words,  he  made  to  charge  the  shadow,  and  rescue
Syusahn.  But, Cefn  flung  out an  arm across  both  Je'en and  Maks'
path, and  urged them to  take a step back.  He said quiet  enough for
only their  ears, "I  know what is  going on now.  Have either  of you
ever heard of the Glasmelyn Llaw?
    Je'en gasped  at the  name, but  Maks shook  his head.  Cefn said,
"Long ago,  a very powerful  wizard enchanted  the tower he  had built
to protect  him from his jealous  peers. But, the spell  was too good.
It protected  him from  everything, including age.  I think  that that
shadow man over there is the magician Tarlada.
    "Over the  years, the tower had  been doing its job.  But, at some
point, something happened,  and it began to spread  its influence. The
vines outside  are the tower's way  of taking control of  the forest -
they are its link to the land around it. And, it is spreading.
    "That  object  on the  table  is  the  focus of  the  enchantment,
almost the brain of  the tower. If we can destroy it,  we can both get
Syusahn  away from  that poor  madman, and  free the  forest from  the
encroaching evil. Stand back."
    Je'en and  Maks took another  step back  as Cefn pointed  his wand
at the thing on  the table. It looked like a  cross between the tower,
a man,  and (perhaps)  a tree. It  was ugly, and  glowed a  bright and
sickly  pulsing green,  and  thin  little green  and  blue and  yellow
strands of  itself grew from it,  across the table, and  down into the
floor. Je'en  had been frantically  trying to  recall the tale  of the
Emerald  Hand, because  she  had  a nagging  sensation  that Cefn  was
making a  big mistake  by attack  the core  directly. But,  she didn't
want to say anything, because he was, after all, the mage of the team.
    Finally, just  as a  bolt of  light pulsed  along Cefn's  wand and
flashed  at  the thing  on  the  table,  Je'en remembered.  There  was
another tale  that concerned the  exact same spell  as the one  in use
here which told  of the only way  to defeat the spell -  and what Cefn
had just done wasn't it.
    Cefn's wand  began to  build up  a charge  again, even  before the
first had  hit its  target. Je'en shouted  "NO!!", causing  the wizard
to flinch. The bolt fired  while the wand was pointed at Tarlada.
    The  first bolt  hit  the thing  on the  table.  The thing  pulsed
brighter as it  did, and then kept getting brighter  and brighter. The
oppressive  atmosphere got  worse, and  Je'en knew  that the  presence
was finally  aware of them. Then,  the second bolt passed  through the
shadow  Tarlada, and  the  thing  began to  glow  with an  eye-searing
brilliance.  And a  sound  began,  a subtle  vibration  at first,  but
getting louder by  the second. It sounded like the  tower was roaring,
and that sound frightened Je'en.
    She said, "Run! We  cannot stop it now - we  don't have the proper
materials. Run  - it  knows we are  here and intend  to hurt  it!" And
she followed her own advice, turning and heading for the stairs.
    Maks, though eager to  rescue his love from what was  sure to be a
horrid  fate, especially  for  one of  the Wind  Riders,  also had  an
instinctive fear of magic. So, he followed Je'en without question.
    Je'en  reached  the stairs,  and  went  down three  risers  before
noticing two  things. The first was  a horrible pressure on  her head.
No, it  was not  on her head,  but on  her mind -  she could  feel the
essence of  the tower trying  to take command  of her mind.  And, when
she  turned  around  to  see  if  the  other  two  were  in  the  same
difficulty, she  saw that  Cefn hadn't  moved. She  was about  to turn
back to get  him, when she saw  a ripple of light cover  him, and when
it was gone, there was a flakey stone statue of him in his place.
    Her eyes  went wide, and then  she began to run  again, Maks still
at her  heels. The  pressure in  her mind was  getting worse,  and she
began  to  recite   the  first  and  second  Measures   of  the  first
Apprentice  Bard lesson  to try  and fight  it off.  She seemed  to be
successful - at least she was still running, and not a stone statue.
    They  reached the  sixth floor,  and headed  for the  next set  of
stairs. Je'en was  very occupied with trying to keep  the tower out of
her mind,  but she managed to  notice something odd about  the statues
around  the  room.  First,  several were  missing.  And,  another  was
moving. She  watched as  an inert  statue began  to shimmer,  and then
turn into  a man. But, before  he could raise his  sword, he shimmered
again, and  fell to dust.  One by one, the  other statues in  the room
came to life,  then fell into dust. As she  passed those pedestals she
had noted as  being empty, she saw  the little mound of  dust that was
all that was left of them.
    Je'en and  Maks hurried  down the stairs  past the  fifth, fourth,
and third floor,  catching glimpses of powdering statues  as the went,
as  the  tower  tried  to  use  previous  victims  to  snare  the  two
remaining interlopers. As  they reached the head of the  stairs to the
second floor,  one of the  statues that flanked  it came to  life, but
it didn't  disintegrate. As  it happened,  it was  one of  the younger
and more fit  of the gypsies that the tower  had captured earlier, and
now, with a vacant stare, and a menacing sword, he tried to attack.
    Je'en was startled  to see the statue come back  to life properly,
but  she was  so  keyed up  trying  to escape  that  her reaction  was
instinctive.  Her sword  came up  swiftly,  engaged the  gypsy's in  a
bind, and  then riposted right  into his  heart. She was  halfway down
the stairs before the body hit the ground.
    There  were two  more "alive"  statues to  be taken  care of,  but
they posed  little problem to  one with  Je'en's reflexes and  will to
stay alive.  When they  reached the  first floor,  the door  was still
open, and  they could  see the  vines that lined  the path  waving and
thrashing madly,  some even reaching  blindly into the  tower, feeling
for their  prey. Je'en  took several  seconds to  get out  her cutting
knife, and then had an idea.
    She dragged  a table under the  chandelier, and climbed up  on it.
She could  just reach the  oil reservoirs, and  she was happy  to find
that they  were not  fixed to  the frame  (for easier  refilling), and
also that  they were full. She  took several down, and  handed them to
Maks. Then,  she hastily lit  one of  the wicks with  a spark-striker,
and went  to the door.  Dodging out of  reach of the  thrashing vines,
she took  one of the reservoirs  and hurled it out  onto the left-hand
vine-wall. Then,  she threw another  onto the right wall,  making sure
that  the oil  scattered.  Then, she  lit  one, and  threw  it to  the
right, and another  to the left, causing the oil  already on the vines
to  catch fire.  She  was  gratified to  see  that  the vines  weren't
fireproof as  both walls  flared up,  the flames  eating up  the vines
like they were kindling.
    The tower  howled, almost  as if  in pain,  and the  vines stopped
darting around,  and tried to beat  out the flames, which  only caught
them on  fire. Maks and  Je'en waited for  the right moment,  and then
dashed between the  flaming walls of vines, unhindered  except for the
danger of the fire, and the heat it generated.
    When they  reached the forest,  Je'en turned  to look back  at the
tower. She  saw the vines  at the edge of  the clearing begin  to pull
back  from the  forest  itself,  creating a  firebreak.  As the  vines
retreated from  the forest, she  also noticed that there  were several
mounds that  ran along the  ground from the  tower to the  trees. They
looked like mole  tunnels, or maybe shallow roots -  and she knew that
even without  the surface vines, the  tower was still in  contact with
its forest.  She began to  run again while  the tower was  busy trying
to put out the fires at its base.

                          Part Six:  Solution
    Maks and Je'en  slashed their way madly  through the vine-infested
part  of the  forest, and  managed to  reach their  horses in  under a
day. Then,  by pushing the  horses and themselves  to the limit  and a
little bit  beyond, Maks and  Je'en managed  to reach Dargon  in three
more days.  When Maks complained  about the pace, Je'en  just reminded
him of  the fate  that was  creeping closer to  his love  every minute
that they were  away from the tower.  That made him shut  up and hurry
on in silence for a long while.
    She had  plenty of  time to  think as  they rode  dangerously fast
through the forest.  She wasn't exactly sure of the  fate of Cefn, but
having seen  him turned to  stone, she figured  that he would  be safe
for a while.  After all, those of the gypsies  that had been petrified
had been alive  when turned back -  those that had turned  to dust had
just been  statues too long, she  hoped, and the tower  couldn't truly
prolong their  existence so far  past their  time of dying.  She fully
intended to rescue Cefn long before he reached that limit.
    She knew  exactly what  she had  to do to  destroy the  tower. The
tale  she  had remembered  told  of  something called  'prenia'  which
acted as an  antidote, almost, to the specific kind  of magic that had
given a pseudo  life to the tower.  The only problem was  that she had
no idea just what  prenia was, or even what it  looked like. She could
only hope that someone in Dargon did.
    Pausing only  long enough  for a  proper meal  and bath  when they
arrived in  Dargon, both Je'en  and Maks began  to scour the  city for
anyone who knew  of prenia. They searched everywhere,  in the markets,
on the  docks, in the  business district, everywhere they  could think
of - and no  one had so much as a clue to  the identity or whereabouts
of the thing called 'prenia'.
    Two days  passed in their  search for the mysterious  element they
needed, and they were both getting desperate. Then, Je'en had an idea.
    The  secretary in  Kroan's  office knew  Je'en,  and admitted  her
with no  trouble into  his office.  They hadn't seen  each other  in a
while, and  they greeted each  other warmly. Je'en introduced  Maks to
her brother, and then they got down to business.
    Je'en told  Kroan why Maks  had come to  her and Cefn  (whom Kroan
had met  several times, and liked).  And then, of what  they had found
in the tower,  and what had happened to Cefn,  and what was happening,
hopefully very  slowly, to  Syusahn. And lastly,  of the  thing called
prenia that would save  them both. "I hope you know  what it is," said
Je'en, "because no one else in this town does."
    Kroan searched  his memory,  but found nothing.  He called  in one
of  his employees,  an inventory  clerk, and  asked the  young man  to
quickly ask around  about prenia. While the youngster  carried out his
errand, Je'en and Kroan talked trivially to pass the time.
    Finally,  almost an  hour  later, the  clerk  returned to  Kroan's
office bearing  no good news -  no one in  the employ of Fifth  I knew
what prenia  was, either. Je'en sighed,  and wondered what to  do next
as she  rose to leave.  Then Kroan said, "Wait,  Sis. Did you  talk to
the local physician  yet? His name is Aardvard Factotum,  and he lives
a little way from  town to the east. He has the  most knowledge in the
area about things magical and/or ancient."
    The man's  name hadn't come  up before,  but Je'en had  heard that
he was competent  if a little ostentatious. She also  knew that he was
unlikely  to part  with any  information he  had for  free, so,  after
thanking her brother  for the lead, she went to  the moneylender where
she kept  her savings and  withdrew almost all  of what she  had left,
converting the  disparate currencies into  gold marks. And  then, with
Maks still following her, they rode off to Aardvard's cottage.
    Ostentatious suited  Aardvard and his  home to a tee.  Displays of
his  wealth were  everywhere,  and  the cottage  itself  was almost  a
small  villa. Je'en  hoped that  Aardvard was  as knowledgeable  as he
was rich.
    They  were  admitted  to  a   large  sitting  room  by  Aardvard's
servant,  Hansen,  who  then  departed  with  Je'en's  request  of  an
audience with  the physician.  Hansen didn't return  for a  long time,
and Je'en recognized  the ploy from her years in  Court circles. Maks,
however, was not  so learned, and he was  pacing restlessly, fingering
the various objects  that adorned the tables, and wall  shelves of the
sitting room.  He almost  dropped a small,  delicate china  mouse when
Hansen  finally did  return, saying,  "Excuse me,  m'lord and  m'lady,
but Aardvard  will see you  now." With a  frown at the  sheepish Maks,
who had  returned the mouse to  its shelf, Hansen led  the way through
the house to Aardvard's receiving room.
    Je'en studied  the man sitting  with his  back to the  only window
in the room  as she and Maks  were offered seats, and  then glasses of
what looked  and smelled like a  delicate red wine, but  which tasted,
at least  to Je'en, like  grape-flavored water. Aardvard  Factotum was
as richly garbed  as was his home, and  he had the look of  a rich man
about  him -  well  fed,  a little  slothful,  perhaps  even a  little
bored. But  his eyes were keen  and intelligent, so that  Je'en wasn't
quite sure  how much of what  she saw was a  front that he put  on for
his rich clients.
    The  physician said,  "So, what  can I  do for  you, Je'lanthra'en
and Maks  of the Gold  Rim tribe?"  Maks couldn't hide  the astonished
look  on his  face when  Aardvard  addressed him  by his  full name  -
neither  he  nor  Je'en  had  given so  complete  an  introduction  to
Hansen. Je'en, however,  was amused by Aardvard's tactics,  and kept a
straight face.
    She  said, "We  heard of  your widely  renowned knowledge,  and we
have a question to ask you. Do you know of something called 'prenia'?"
    Aardvard's  eyes  narrowed,  and  he  took  a  few  puffs  on  his
scrimshaw  pipe. "What  might you  be needing  with such  a thing,  my
dear?" he finally said.
    "There is a  tower to the south and west  of here called Glasmelyn
Llaw. Long and  long ago, a wizard enchanted it,  and since then, that
enchantment  has begun  to go  awry. The  tower is  beginning to  take
over the  whole forest. Prenia  is the only thing  that can stop  it -
and save our  two friends, who have  been caught by the  tower. If you
have  any  information about  prenia,  or  even better  actually  have
some, we are willing to pay for it."
    Aardvard got crafty at the mention of money. He said, "How much?"
    "As much  as you  want, healer.  It is very  important to  us, far
more important that a few gold marks. Can you help us?"
    "Perhaps.  I think  I have  a book  in my  library that  refers to
this - what was it, 'pranya'? But I'm not all that sure..."
    Je'en  pulled  the  pouch  of  gold from  inside  her  cloak,  and
spilled it out  on the table. "It's 'prenia', healer,  and is it worth
thirty marks to you?"
    "My, my,  thirty marks  is rather  a lot  for just  a tiny  bit of
information, isn't it. Here, keep ten, and I'll go get my books."
    Aardvard quickly scooped  up twenty marks, and hurried  out of the
room. By  the time Je'en had  stowed the remainder of  her gold within
her cloak,  Aardvard had returned.  bearing three large,  musty tomes.
He placed them on  a table to one side of the  room, and began leafing
through  them. Je'en  rose, and  peered over  his shoulder.  He seemed
about to  snap at her to  stop it at  one point, but perhaps  the size
of  the payment  cooled his  temper, for  he just  turned back  to the
books silently.
    He found  what he was  looking for in  the first book,  and, using
some notations  in the  margin, quickly  found what  he wanted  in the
other two. He turned  to Je'en, and said, "As, I  thought I was right.
Prenia is an  ancient term for what  we now call ice-wood.  Its a kind
of tree that  has no color at  all: you can see right  through it. I'm
afraid  its very  rare, though.  I've never  even seen  a piece  - its
very, very valuable."
    "Ice-wood. Yes,  I've heard of  that - I've  even seen it  used as
jewelry in the  south." Je'en frowned. "Well we now  know what to look
for. Thank  you, Master Factotum. I  was sure you could  help us. Good
bye." She and  Maks retraced their way through the  house, and back to
where their  horses were  tethered. Aardvard looked  after them  for a
moment, then  went to stow  away the gold.  He briefly wondered  if it
had been fair to take such a high price - but, she had offered it.
    Je'en went  straight back  to her brother's  office when  they got
back to  Dargon. If anyone would  have something as rare  as ice-wood,
it would  be a large  merchant firm, and if  Fifth I didn't  have any,
then Kroan would know who did.
    "We  found what  prenia  is  - ice-wood.  Does  Fifth  I have  any
stored away anywhere?"
    Again, Kroan  had to search  his memory,  but this time,  he found
what he was  looking for. "Yes, we  do! But, gods, Je'en,  do you know
what that stuff costs?"
    "I  have  a pretty  good  idea,  Kroan.  But,  I have  no  choice.
Ice-wood is  the only thing  that will save  Cefn and Syusahn.  And we
need enough  to make two  small cages. I'll find  some way to  pay for
it, but I need it now. Please, Kroan, please..."
    Kroan was  not a ruthless  merchant, and  he knew that  his sister
was sincere. So, he  said, "It will take a little  time. I'll bring it
to your house, Je'en, in about two hours. Okay?"
    Je'en hugged her brother. "Fine. We'll be waiting. See you."
    As  they walked  their horses  back  to Je'en  house, Maks  asked,
"Why do we need two cages? There is only one core up in that room."
    Je'en  said, "I  know,  but we  have to  increase  our chances  of
success. You  felt the pressure  as we  were trying to  escape, didn't
you?  I don't  know  why the  tower was  'asleep'  when we  approached
before, but it is  sure to be awake and aware when  we return. And, it
will know that  we are enemies. I  think we can sneak  into the tower,
but the closer  to the top room,  and the core, we get,  the harder it
will try to capture or kill us.
    "Because we  are going  in, and not  out, it is  going to  be even
harder to  resist the influence of  the tower. There is  a good chance
that,  if  you  concentrate  on  Syusahn, you  will  be  able  to  get
through. I...I'm  not quite  as sure  about myself.  So, we  will have
two cages,  one for  each of  us, so that  whoever reaches  that thing
will be able to nullify it."
    All Maks could say in reply was, "Oh."
    By the  time Kroan  arrived at  Je'en's house,  both she  and Maks
were pacing.  Je'en was getting  more and  more worried. What  she had
told Maks  was the simple  truth. She knew  that his love  for Syusahn
was great  enough to  sustain him  through whatever  mental influences
that the  tower might throw  at him. But, she  had no such  anchor, or
at least not  such a strong one.  Cefn was - well,  a possibility. She
was extremely fond  of the wizard, and perhaps more,  but there was no
certainty, even  within herself,  much less between  the two  of them.
So, she  would have to rely  solely upon herself to  carry her through
the attacks of the tower to rescue Cefn.
    Kroan  was  carrying  a  large,  iron,  well-locked  box  when  he
knocked  on Je'en's  door. He  opened it,  using three  keys, and  two
secret levers,  in her  living room, revealing  a much  smaller cavity
within that  was full  of four  to six  inch long  twigs of  wood that
were transparent.  They did  indeed look like  ice sculptured  to look
like wood.  Je'en was sure that  the box contained a  kingdom's ransom
of prenia.
    He also produced  two spools of silver wire, and  then set to work
with Je'en and  Maks to build two  cages, each a foot  high, and eight
inches deep,  with open  bases. The  silver wire  served well  to hold
the  ice-wood pieces  together,  and  was sturdy  enough  to help  the
cages to  keep their  shape without a  lot of  wasteful cross-bracing.
When  the cages  were  completed to  Je'en's  satisfaction, there  was
still enough ice-wood in the box to make, perhaps, a third.
    Kroan  locked the  chest  back  up, kissed  his  sister good  bye,
shook Maks'  hand, wished them  both luck,  and left. Je'en  said, "We
had better get some rest. We leave tomorrow, as early as possible."

                          Part Seven:  Rescue
    Je'en and  Maks could feel the  awareness of the tower  as soon as
they saw  the first of the  vines. The sense of  an actively malicious
presence  was acute,  and the  vines themselves  were far  more active
than they had been before.
    It was  difficult, but  not impossible, to  move at  speed through
the vine-forest.  In about half  a day,  though, they had  reached the
point  where it  was impossible  to keep  going with  the horses.  So,
they dismounted, secured  the four horses, and went on  on foot. Je'en
didn't want  to further alert the  tower to their presence  by cutting
through the vines,  so, after a little survey work,  she and Maks took
to the  trees, traveling branch  to branch  up above the  ground where
the vines were much less thickly interwoven.
    By  sunset of  the  day they  left their  horses,  Je'en and  Maks
reached  the  tower.  There  was  still enough  light  to  notice  the
changes their previous  escape had caused - mainly the  absence of the
matting of vines  that no longer surrounded the  tower. Apparently, it
learned from  its mistakes. Je'en could  see that it had  re-grown the
vines that had  been burned away, but now they  grew straight down the
wall, and into the ground.
    They had  come upon  the tower directly  across the  clearing from
the door, and Je'en  was surprised and happy to see  that the door had
apparently burned away  with the vines -  all that was left  of it was
melted hinges,  and some of the  other fittings lying in  the ashes on
the  ground. Fifty  feet separated  them  from the  open doorway,  and
Je'en  could feel  the  presence  of the  tower  already beginning  to
weigh on her mind, though it didn't yet realize that they were there.
    She signaled  to Maks,  and they both  unlimbered weapons  and the
expensive  ice-wood cages.  Maks helped  her  attach her  cage to  the
bracer on her right  wrist - she hoped that she  didn't forget and try
to  use  the   bracer  to  block  a  sword-blow  if   there  were  any
animateable statues left within.
    Then,  at another  signal, they  both began  sprinting toward  the
tower.  Almost  immediately, vines  began  to  spring  up out  of  the
ground  and  catch  at  their ankles.  Je'en  almost  tripped  several
times, but managed to keep her balance and footing, and keep on.
    Neither stopped  running when  they reached  the door  and entered
the  tower, but  headed  directly  for the  stairs.  Je'en noticed  in
passing that  the fire had been  carried into the main  room, and very
little  was  left.  It  seemed  that the  tower  didn't  have  a  very
effective fire-fighting system.
    Nothing physical hindered  them inside the tower, but  by the time
they reached  the third floor,  Je'en could  feel the pressure  on her
mind  becoming  almost unbearable  already.  She  stumbled once  on  a
step, but  recovered and  kept on  climbing. The  little concentration
tricks that she  had been taught as  a bard helped, but  the pain grew
too great by the fifth floor, and she had to go on to something else.
    She continuously  glanced at  Maks, who  was still  following her.
There  was  a  faraway  look  in  his eyes,  but  it  was  a  look  of
concentration,  not  the look  of  possession.  They had  both  slowed
down, now climbing  the stairs to the sixth floor  at little more than
a  walk,  and both  beginning  to  sweat  from  the effort  of  moving
against  the will  of the  tower,  but Maks  seemed to  be having  the
better time of it.
    A  sword flashed  in Je'en's  line of  vision, and  reflexes alone
moved  her own  up in  time  to block  it.  She focused  on her  gypsy
attacker, wondering  how or  why the  tower had  kept one  in reserve.
She attacked back,  very glad that the  man was very young,  and not a
swordsman. Though  her movements were  slowed by the tower,  the gypsy
was  slower, and  in two  strokes, Je'en  had disarmed  him, and  then
disabled him with the flat of her blade on his temple.
    Then  she  dropped  her  sword,  and  began  ascending  the  fifth
turret's stairs,  pulling herself  along the wall  with her  good arm.
Maks followed,  oblivious of  everything around him,  his mind  set on
Syusahn who  was being slowly  robbed of her body  in the room  at the
top  of  the turret.  Je'en  tried  to  concentrate  on Cefn,  just  a
statue,  fated  to  be  kept  here and  to  be  used  against  further
intruders until  the time  when he  would be  reanimated, and  fall to
dust.  It helped  her,  that image,  but she  still  had to  struggle,
clawing her way  up the winding stairs  one at a time,  with the tower
beating incessantly at her mind.
    By the  time the  topmost room came  into view at  the top  of the
stairs,  Je'en and  Maks were  moving  very slowly,  with long  pauses
between movements. Je'en's  mind was moving in  tiny circles, thoughts
moving  at  random,  her  body  moving  automatically.  The  pain  was
intense,  crippling, and  only  the briefly  glimpsed  images of  Cefn
that  she  had  created  before,   but  which  she  didn't  understand
anymore, kept her moving at all.
    Finally,  with a  sense of  achievement that  managed to  pull her
fragmented consciousness  back together,  Je'en reached the  top step,
and  pulled  herself into  the  top  room.  Little had  changed  here,
unlike outside.  Tarlada-shadow still  stood next  to the  table where
Syusahn lay, and the  statue of Cefn was still in  the room, though it
had moved  against one wall. But,  the thing on the  table was pulsing
even  more brightly  now, and  there  was a  throbbing that  coincided
with its pulsing that sounded a lot like a heartbeat.
    She began  to advance on the  table, as slowly as  she had climbed
the stairs. Tarlada  turned at the sound of her  boots plodding across
the  floor, and  he said,  "Ah, the  masked one  returns! Good.  Good.
See,  the short  one is  almost ready  - I  can free  you very  soon."
Je'en  looked at  the  low  table, and  saw  that  Tarlada was  right.
Syusahn was  even paler than  before, and  her limbs almost  seemed to
be  as  transparent as  Tarlada.  She  took  another step  toward  the
table, and looked for Maks.
    The  gypsy was  there, right  behind  her, still  gazing off  into
nothingness,  but his  face  had  screwed up  into  a  fierce mask  of
concentration. His steps  were as slow as hers, but  Je'en could sense
that his  determination to free his  love was far stronger  than her's
to stay alive and free Cefn.
    Advancing a  step at a  time, she neared  the thing on  the table.
Tarlada  began  screaming at  Maks  and  her  after they  removed  the
cloths that  had covered  the ice-wood cages.  Je'en's cage  had taken
up the  greenish glow of the  core, and it  began to glow on  its own.
She hoped it was supposed to do that.
    The tower  redoubled its efforts  to halt Je'en and  Maks, causing
Je'en to  cry out, and  slow down. She could  almost see the  waves of
force directed  at her form  the core. She could  feel each one  as it
hit  her  body  and sent  lances  of  pain  into  her head.  When  she
couldn't  take any  more  standing  up, she  went  to  her knees,  and
pulled herself along. But, Maks never wavered, and kept going.
    Then,  just  a few  more  feet  from  the  table, Je'en  felt  her
control  slip.  Just for  an  instant,  but  it  was enough.  She  was
reaching out  her arm to pull  herself along another few  inches, when
she  found she  couldn't  move. Her  head  was up  enough  to see  the
table, and Maks,  but she could no longer make  any movement, not even
to blink  her eyes. Maks,  though, was  still plodding along,  step by
step closer to the thing.
    The statue  of Cefn was  within her range  of vision, and  as Maks
reached the edge  of the table, she  saw it come to life.  The wand in
his hand was  still raised, and it pointed at  the table. But, somehow
his cowl  had been lowered,  and just as  his body returned  to flesh,
and the wand  began to glow, Cefn screamed, and  covered his eyes with
both hands, dropping the wand which ceased to glow.
    Maks raised  his left hand, which  was holding the cage,  with the
same slowness  he had moved. Now,  his eyes were focused  on something
- the table  against the wall, and the attenuating  Syusahn. Sweat was
streaming down his  face, and his dark tunic was  visibly wet from the
perspiration that ran down his body, but still he moved.
    Enough  of  the  wizard  remained  in  Tarlada  to  recognize  the
composition and  purpose of the  cage that  was nearing the  core. The
shadow man  finally moved  from his position  by Syusahn's  table, but
he  moved as  slowly  as Maks  did. Curses  streamed  from his  mouth,
alternately  directed  at   Maks  and  the  tower   itself.  The  core
responded by  glowing even  brighter, and  the waves  of force  it was
sending out  really did become  visible. Je'en saw them  hitting Maks,
making him  stagger a little  or flinch,  but they couldn't  stop him.
The waves  got thicker, and hit  harder, but Maks was  almost finished
what he had to  do. The cage was finally directly  over the core, and,
as the waves  of force began to  draw blood as they  struck the gypsy,
Maks began to lower it over the core.
    Je'en watched,  motionless and  free of pain,  as the  cage slowly
settled into  place. She saw  the waves being  cut off as  they struck
the ice-wood  of the  cage as it  covered more and  more of  the core.
Slowly, with Tarlada  beating his shadow fists  ineffectually on Maks,
and Cefn  recovering enough  to slip  his cowl  back on  properly, the
cage trapped  more and more of  the core's essence. And,  just as Cefn
was groping for  his wand, ready to  make a last ditch  defense of his
master the tower, the cage touched the table.
    When it did,  the whole ice-wood construct flared  a deep, healthy
blue,  and  rays  of  light  joined  the  base  points  of  the  cage,
enclosing  the core  completely.  Then, blue  light  bridged the  open
spaces between  the lattices of  the cage, rapidly enclosing  the core
in a  solid form  of blue light.  As the last  opening filled  in with
light,  the  whole tower  shuddered,  and  screamed. Tarlada,  getting
even more  transparent, added his  thin voice  to the noise,  and then
Je'en was so suddenly and completely free that she collapsed.
    Relief washed  over her -  relief that she  was able to  move, and
free  of pain,  and relief  that the  spell on  the tower  was finally
broken. She picked  herself up slowly, and looked around.  She saw the
blue  box of  light  on the  table,  and noticed  the  vines that  had
connected the  core to  the floor  of the  room were  shriveling away,
having been  severed from the core.  She saw Maks, still  bloody, over
by  Syusahn,  who  was  still  pale,  but  no  longer  fading  in  the
extremities.  And,  she  saw  Cefn  slumped  against  the  wall,  also
surveying the room.
    After resting  up a few  minutes, she stood  up, and went  over to
Cefn. "Are you all right?" she asked.
    "I think so. It  was strange, though, to be in  the control of the
tower  like that.  Just  a momentary  confusion, and  it  had me.  And
then, I could  see and hear, but  not move. Even when  I was attacking
you two, I couldn't feel myself move. The tower did it all.
    "Well, think we should see about Maks and Syusahn?"
    She  helped him  up -  he seemed  to be  very weak,  but otherwise
okay.  They went  over to  the  table where  Maks was  trying to  wake
Syusahn  up. Cefn  knelt  down  beside Maks,  and  checked the  girl's
pulse. Then he  said, "She'll be fine,  but I suspect she  needs a lot
of rest. Je'en, if she could borrow your cloak..."
    When Syusahn  was bundled  up, Maks  turned to  the cage  with the
core  in it.  "What about  that  thing?" he  asked. "Will  it be  safe
there, or do we have to do something else?"
    Je'en said, "Once  the cage is closed, nothing can  open it again.
The ice-wood  will slowly leach away  the magic in the  core, and when
it is  all gone, it  will disintegrate, along  with the core.  We have
done all that needs to be done."
    "Good," said Cefn. "Let's get out of here."
    Maks  carried Syusahn,  and  they all  began  descending the  many
stairs  of  the  tower.  On  the fourth  floor,  one  of  the  shelves
standing next  to a wall  caught Je'en's attention. She  detoured over
to it,  and stared in  open-mouthed amazement  at what was  there. She
said, "Cefn,  Maks, come look at  this." They were both  as astonished
as she was, but for different reasons.
    Set up  for display  was an exquisitely  carved King's  Crown game
set. The  board was made of  dark, polished wood, with  inlaid squares
of  what  looked like  some  kind  of  ivory,  and triangles  of  some
lavender colored  stone. One set of  pieces were carved from  what was
probably sapphire,  but the  most astonishing thing  about the  set to
Je'en was  what the other  set of  pieces was carved  from: firestone.
Each  delicately carved  piece  had  an ember  of  fire imbedded  deep
within it,  and she knew  that that flame  would respond to  the touch
by flaring up and filling the whole figure with fire.
    Maks ogled  the storage boxes  for each  set of pieces.  They were
each made  of the same material  as their pieces, but  they were lined
with ysgafn, a kind  of soft stone that was a  perfect cushion for the
valuable game pieces.  And Cefn, alone among them,  recognized who had
made the set -  a Master craftsman from ages and  ages ago, whose work
was very rare and highly prized.
    Je'en  began picking  up the  firestone pieces,  and putting  them
away.  Maks followed  suit with  the jade  ones, and  found that  they
reacted just like  the firestones, glowing palely as  he touched them.
Je'en said, "I  wonder if Tarlada knew what a  treasure this is. Well,
he won't  be needing  this now,  will he.  I think  that this  will do
nicely in  lieu of a  fee, Maks  - it'll help  Cefn and I  through the
lean winter months."
    Maks just smiled, and continued to help her pack.
