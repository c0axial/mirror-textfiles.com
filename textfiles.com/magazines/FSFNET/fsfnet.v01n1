        Well, here is issue number one of FSFnet, and I hope
     you all enjoy it.   Since the first mailing, I have had
     a great  deal of positive  response,  and about  half a
     dozen  submissions.   In  this issue  you  will find  a
     scattering of reviews,  an amusing story I whipped off,
     and something I'd like to continue in future issues,  a
     featured author.   I would like to thank those who have
     contributed, and Lord Hagen for designing the header.
        A reminder to those who did not respond to the first
     mailing: this is the last issue you will receive unless
     I hear from you that you  wish to remain on the mailing
     list.   Also,  people  whose ids have changed  over the
     semester break, please notify me.   A reminder,  FSFnet
     will come  out as often as  I have enough  material for
     it.    This means  I  need  submissions and  ideas  and
     feedback to make this zine what it ought to be.  Please
     try to  submit something,  and  try to spread  the word
     about FSFnet to people you think might be interested.
        Anyone  interested  in  a  game  of  Diplomacy  over
     Bitnet,  please contact me.   I  will be running a game
     which will begin rather soon.    Maps and rules will be
     sent out.
        Well, enough of the editorial, on to the real stuff.
     Read on!

        Have you  ever heard of  the micro-games  Wizard and
     Melee?   If so, then you may know about the way they do
     ready-made modules.
          I am  working on a  labyrinth for FSFnet,   but am
     limited by  disk space  at the  present time.    I have
     requested additional space, and if I get it,  I will be
     able to send the dungeon by electronic mail.
           It would be geared to people making choices,  but
     not to  dice rolls.   In  any case,   as soon as  it is
     finished,  I will  be willing to send it  to anyone who
     sends me a self-addressed, stamped envelope.

                              DUNE
      (This review is directed at people who have read and
                         liked the book)
        The  movie   Dune  opened last  Friday and I  saw it
     over  the  weekend,   I   never  believed  that   Frank
     Herbert's  novel  could be  faithfully reproduced  in a
     two hour movie, and I was glad to see I was right about
     something this year.
        There  were some  minor  flaws in the movie  such as
     the   'Weirding  devices'   that   House  Atreides  had
     developed that were  used as the secret  weapon  by the
     Atreides instead of the Fremen,   in the book Duke Leto
     is planning  even  before  leaveing  Caladan to use the
     Fremen  against the Imperial Sardaukar.
        When  they  decided  to  make the  movie they  could
     have decided to  be true to the  book or  to really cut
     the book  to  make the screenplay work  but  they tried
     to do both  and the result  is a mediocre  movie from a
     great book  that would  have  made  an excellent  mini-
     series.
        The  most drastic  change  from  the book  was  they
     didn't take  the time and   give  us  the   history  of
     the  feud   between the   Atreides and  the Harkonnens,
     but they still had to get the audience  to hate them so
     they made the Baron into a diseased sadist,  instead of
     just leaving him  as a mean,  ruthless,   power hungry,
     aristocrat.
        For all  the  Police  fans out  there  Sting  played
     Feyd-Rautha almost  exactly as i  pictured  him  in the
     book however he  should have had more dialogue with his
     uncle the Baron.

                         Ornathor's Saga
        Once upon a time there  lived an errant knight,  and
     his daring life of gallantry and chivalry had won him a
     considerable  reputation  among  those  realms  he  had
     journeyed  in.   He  was  tall  and dark,   with  deep,
     piercing eyes,   keen as  the sword  which hung  on his
     baldric.  His armor and weapons were all of silver, and
     his huge stallion was a tarnished grey.   On his shield
     was  his coat:    suspended in  a black  night sky,   a
     constellation of five  stars in a rough  diamond shape.
     It was the  most prominent group of stars in  the sky -
     the Southern Cross.
        The  name of  the  realm was  Bukharim;    it was  a
     pleasing  and comfortable  kingdom  of green,   rolling
     hills and  cool evergreen forests.   The  silver knight
     was on an errand to Kulac, the central keep and city of
     Bukharim.    The  world  was   strangely  quiet  as  he
     approached the city  on the plains.   As  he passed the
     iron gates,   he saw a guard  poised to strike  a wench
     with the back  of his mailed fist.    The knight yelled
     out, a strange sound in the quiet of the city;  neither
     figure moved.    He examined them,   and saw  that they
     stood as still as if time  itself had stopped for them.
     He led  his horse  along the street,   and he  saw many
     frozen figures.   A guillotine hung impossibly,  having
     travelled halfway down  its lethal course.    An irate-
     looking peasant woman held a  young urchin by the hair.
     A  man and  a woman  were  climbing the  stairs to  the
     second story of a brothel.   Three veterans toasted one
     another.   Perhaps  they were  recently reunited,   and
     surprised to see one another  still alive.   Perhaps on
     the morning  they were  to be off  to the  next battle.
     None could ever read their faces.
        He  came to  the  keep,   and entered.    The  great
     reception hall was  a scene from some  warped painter's
     fantasies;   the  lord of Bukharim pointed  an accusing
     finger at a  figure who seemingly was  no longer there.
     On a  stone platform lay  a woman,  the  most beautiful
     woman the  knight had  ever seen.    She was,   without
     doubt,  the lord's daughter,  no  less than a princess.
     As  the  knight  approached his  vision,   he  heard  a
     sound...  this woman was  not captured in timelessness,
     but merely sleeping.   He could not help but feast upon
     the sight of her,  her beautiful golden hair,  her fair
     skin,  her perfect lips.   His  body longed to hold her
     and his mind  reeled with the desire to  kiss her.   He
     fell to  his knees,  knowing  that a single  kiss could
     restore normality to  this ghost realm,  that  he would
     marry the  princess,  and,   in time,   become lord  of
     Bukharim.   He recalled the guard, poised to strike the
     wench, the guillotine about to fall, the woman berating
     the urchin,  the  man and the whore,   the battle-weary
     veterans.   He silently cried as he lay down beside the
     princess and was  overcome by sleep,  never  to be seen
     again beyond the dream-gates of Ilek-vad, upon which he
     had stumbled in conscious dream.

                  Brisingamen, by Diana Paxson
        This  book  came  out   recently  in  a  mass-market
     paperback. The cover says: "The magic is back.  But can
     California handle it?".
        The heroine,   Karen Ingold,  is  a grad  student in
     comparative literature.  The book begins with her lover
     of two years,  Roger,  leaving to  go back to his wife,
     and telling her in the  morning as he leaves,  claiming
     he  didn't want  to spoil  their  last night  together.
     Karen goes  in to her  job in  the comp lit  office.  A
     package arrives from Sweden for  her boss,  Walter.  It
     proves  to contain  a  wedding chest  and  pieces of  a
     necklace, which we know (from a prologue)  goes back to
     the old Norse  religion and had to be  hidden away from
     the  Christians.  The  book  depicts Karen's  gradually
     learning to deal  with the fact that  the necklace does
     have power,  enabling her to  invoke the Goddess Freyja
     (whether  she wants  to  or  not),  while  putting  her
     personal life and career back together.
        The people in it are real,   as is the magic.  There
     are references to the Neopagan community, in particular
     a (presumably invented)  group that  works in the Norse
     tradition, and Paxson seems to be deriving her theories
     of  magic from  that source  as  much as  from the  old
     myths. She is conscious of how much we don't know about
     Norse religion, and uses that instead of trying to hide
     it.

                 Featured Author: M.A.R. BARKER
        Muhammad Abd-al-Rahman Barker,  creator of the world
     of Tekumel and author of the Man of Gold,  is currently
     a  full  professor  in  the  Department  of  South  and
     Southwestern  Asian   Studies  at  the   University  of
     Minnesota Minneapolis/St.  Paul.   He is best known for
     his work  with Tekumel,   particularly the  roleplaying
     game the Empire of the Petal Throne.   Recently revived
     interest in  the wonder  of Tekumel  has spurred  a new
     roleplaying game, Swords and Glory, and the full-length
     novel the Man of Gold, with more novels to follow.
        Tekumel first  was introduced to the  general public
     in  the  form  of  the   Empire  of  the  Petal  Throne
     roleplaying game,  published  by TSR in 1974.    It was
     expensive  for  it's  time,   and  was  considered  the
     'Cadillac' of  RPGs during its  time.   It  was heavily
     influenced by the developing  Dungeons and Dragons RPG.
     Today EPT is a collectors item.
        Swords  and Glory/EPT  is  a  brand new  roleplaying
     game,  also by Barker,  also  set in Tekumel,  an alien
     world of magic and  wonder.   Published by Gamescience,
     the S&G/EPT  will contain three volumes,   each costing
     about $25;  the first two  volumes are already in print
     and available.   Tekumel Games,  Inc.  (1278 Selby Ave,
     St. Paul,  MN  55104)  also publishes  several Tekumel-
     related products, including an official ongoing history
     of the world.
        However,  the  great amount  of attention  the games
     have received  obscures the  real reason  for Tekumel's
     existance.   Says  Barker:  'The  idea of  Tekumel came
     first,  plus a desire to  write fistion about it.   EPT
     was secondary.'  The Man of Gold, published by DAW,  is
     an excellent  look into the  violent nature of  life in
     Tekumel's  fantastically  alien  environment,   and  an
     excellent book.    It is  the tale of  a young  man who
     suddenly finds himself confronted  with being the focus
     of the attention of the  powers of the Tsolyani Empire.
     The  book  is  very interesting  and  well-written  and
     enjoyable,  although  the conclusion  is very  weak and
     leaves one wondering exactly what has gone on.
        Barker is continuing his writing.   A second Tekumel
     novel,  Flamesong,  is  already in DAW's hands,   and a
     further work  has been begun.   An  excellent interview
     with Barker,   discussing the  games,  his  books,  and
     himself  can be  found in  the Space  Gamer number  71.
     Tekumel  is  a  place that  once  visited,   cannot  be
     forgotten.    It's compelling  alienness intrigues  and
     captivates  us,   and  I  am  looking  forward  to  the
     publication of further Tekumel-related novels.
