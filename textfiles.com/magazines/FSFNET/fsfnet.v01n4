                                  Editorial
      Greetings, and welcome to the Howard Phillips Lovecraft special issue
   of FSFnet.   I must apologize for the  lateness of this issue,  but,  as
   many of you know already,  I am in the middle of spending three weeks in
   wonderful (?) New York City.   I hope that you will find the issue worth
   the wait.    Future issues  should be  forthcoming within  a few  weeks,
   depending on how things go here.
      Submissions and other response can be  sent to my Maine account,  and
   will receive proper attention, usually within one to five days.   If you
   have something that you would like to  bring to my attention,  I will be
   using TIGQC489 @ CUNYVM during my stay  in NYC,  which should last until
   the 20th of March.
      I would like to  thank the contributors for their help,   and I would
   like to apologize to Eric (@ UCONN) for having to ask him  to withdraw a
   fine submission,  due to length.   Merlin's overview of the Mythos is an
   excellent article,  and  Mike's CoC game review is lucid.    I hope that
   Lovecraft fans enjoy this issue, although there is not enough room to do
   his  work justice,   and I  hope that  those of  you who  have not  been
   introduced to HPL find this issue enjoyable and interesting.
      Issue five should  be following this issue rather  rapidly,  and will
   definitely appear in your reader queues before the end of the month.  It
   will contain sequels to stories that  appeared in issue three,  and,  of
   course,  another  featured author...  I  really ought to  start thinking
   about who...
      Well, you know how it is.  Enjoy, and spread the word!
                Orny  <NMCS025 @ MAINE and TIGQC489 @ CUNYVM>

                  Featured Author: HOWARD PHILLIPS LOVECRAFT
      H.P.  Lovecraft  has become one of  the most well-known of  the early
   writers in  the pulp  science fiction/horror field.    His life was very
   controversial,  and  there has been passionate  debate over how  much of
   Lovecraft's work was influenced by his early experiences.   However, his
   writings remain popular works of horror,  and HPL has had many followers
   and imitators.
      Lovecraft  was born  and lived  all  his life  in Providence,   Rhode
   Island.   His father was placed in a mental home when HPL was three, and
   died of paresis when Howard was 8.   His mother, from all accounts,  was
   psychoneurotic,  eventually  being institutionalized as well.    HPL was
   brought up in a very Victorian household, and therefore his emotions and
   imagination were  suppressed.   He  was taught to  read early,   and his
   childhood was filled with writing  experiments.   However,  Howard was a
   sickly child, and was not exposed to the world outside his home.  He was
   made very  aware of his  own shortcomings,  with  possible psychological
   implications.
      HPL  carried  on a  number  of  active correspondances  with  younger
   authors once he had  broken into the pulp market,  and  many people feel
   that if he  had spent less time on  his letters he might  have been more
   productive;  however,  for Lovecraft,  these  epistles were necessary to
   help him cope with his incredibly low self-image,  to help him deal with
   his loneliness, and to gather news and ideas from the vast world outside
   his experience.
      Lovecraft's style was heavily influenced by Poe,  Arthur Machen,  and
   Lord Dunsany,  although  HPL also filtered  his ideas through  his life-
   experience.   For example,  Lovecraft used very little dialogue,  for he
   did not have a  great deal of experience in conversation.    Most of his
   tales are located in New England, a fact which adds believability to his
   tales,  but also becomes redundant.   HPL  distinctly avoided sex in his
   stories, and any women who appear are as nonfeminine as his mother.
      One  of Lovecraft's  favorite writing  mechanisms  is the  use of  an
   ancient, forbidden tome, usually the Necronomicon,  a book originally of
   his invention,  though several hoaxes  have been perpetrated.   This may
   have been borrowed from Poe's "ancient  sources" or Robert W.  Chambers'
   "King in  Yellow",  but  no fantastic  book has  ever been  portrayed as
   effectively as Lovecraft's.   More recent authors have copied the tactic
   with marginal success:   Robert  E.  Howard's "Unaussprechlichen Kulten"
   and Robert Bloch's "De Vermis Mysteriis" being examples.
      Lovecraft's works  are many and  varied,  beginning with  his earlier
   tales, to be found in Del Rey's recent reprints "The Tomb" and "The Doom
   that Came  to Sarnath"  and culminating  in his  popular Cthulhu  Mythos
   cycle.   Most of his work is in  the form of short stories,  although he
   also wrote poetry  which is generally considered marginal.    In his own
   eyes,  his best work  was the story "Colour out of  Space",  followed by
   "The Music of Eric Zann".   I tend to agree with Lovecraft on this,  but
   would also suggest  "The Tomb",  "The Doom that Came  to Sarnath",  "The
   Call of  Cthulhu",  and the Charles  Dexter Ward novella.   The  Del Rey
   reprints  are  all excellent  collections,   and  many other  works  are
   available,  if,  like some of HPL's  characters,  one enjoys delving for
   arcane and wond'rous tomes of ancient lore.
      H.P. Lovecraft is a classic horror author and a must for horror fans;
   however,   it must  be  remembered  that he  wrote  his  works for  pulp
   magazines who were not interested in master works of style.  He wrote to
   earn his living, which was, at best,  meagre,  and his unique psychology
   and situation left many gaps in his writing style.  However, he was also
   a master  at certain techniques that  budding authors should  note,  and
   that horror fans would appreciate.

                         Call of Cthulhu GAME REVIEW
      Fans of H.P Lovecraft's infamous 'Cthulhu mythos' stories and general
   horror  buffs now  have  a role  playing game  designed  just for  them:
   Chaosium's fantasy  role playing  game 'Call of  Cthulhu'.   If  you are
   bored by standard  role playing games,  tired of the  old 'kill monster,
   take its  treasure,  go on  to next  monster...' limbo inherent  in many
   fantasy games,  or if you just want to try something different,  Call of
   Cthulhu may be worth looking into.   Based entirely on the world of H.P.
   Lovecraft,   where  mankind   is  beset  by  immortal   elder   gods  of
   mindshattering power and insane human  sorcerers bent on the enslavement
   of  humanity,  this  game  offers adventurers  a  different approach  to
   gaming;   Horror based  role playing.    In this  world,  players  fight
   sorcerers and evil  humans,  lose sanity,  and run from  monsters a lot.
   The enjoyment of it is derived  not from successfully killing the enemy,
   but from successfully running away before it eats your face off.  Combat
   plays a small part in this game,  which instead centers around detective
   work coupled  with a general atmosphere  of Gothic horror  and impending
   doom.
      The gaming  system is  remarkably simple,   and anyone  familiar with
   Chaosium's gaming system will find Call  to be similar to other Chaosium
   games,  such  as Elfquest,  Stormbringer,   and Elric.   Hit  points are
   computed in a  simple (some might say primitive)  way  by averaging size
   and con.   Sanity is a statistic unique  to this game,  and is used more
   often than hit  points,  with a character being shocked  into madness by
   'unspeakably blasphemous horrors',  as H.P.L.  might  have put it.   The
   overall game system is more logic oriented than most others, with a list
   of abilities and areas of knowledge somewhat similar to Top Secret, only
   more diverse and  lengthy.   Combat is simple,   with parries,  critical
   hits, and a percentage chance to hit any given target.  (Those who value
   greater  realism  in a  gaming  system  may  wish  to use  a  system  of
   'difficulty  factors'  like that  used in  the James  Bond role  playing
   game.  Assigning a constant chance to hit any target at any range with a
   given weapon is not exactly realistic.) However, a clever gamemaster can
   make up for any  deficiencies in the game system and  find a right blend
   of realism and simplicity.
      Modules for Call are not easy to find, being less numerous than those
   of many other games.  Most modules published by Chaosium are in the form
   of long campaigns,  with six or more modules usually linked by a central
   theme,  and flowing  nicely from one to the other.    These modules cost
   approximately ten dollars, and are well worth it since they provide many
   hours of game  time.   The modules state  that they will last  for sixty
   hours,   but a  gamemaster  well versed  in  Lovecraft's literature  can
   stretch it out  to at least a hundred  hours.   That comes to  a dime an
   hour,  a much better deal than most other games can offer.   Some titles
   to look for are:   Shadows of  Yog Sothoth,  Masks of Nyarlathotep,  The
   Asylum, The Fungi from Yuggoth, Death in Dunwich and others.
      The game itself may prove difficult  to find;  almost as difficult as
   locating books by H.P.L. The easiest way to get a copy of the game if no
   local store  has it  is to order  it direct  from  Chaosium;   there are
   advertisements  in Dragon  magazine  with  the address.    Modules  will
   probably be similar to  track down,  but an order form  is enclosed with
   the game, so that is no big problem.

   (Note:  try to get the second edition of the game.   The first is flawed
   in several ways, which are corrected in the second edition.  Corrections
   for the  first edition were published  as part some  modules,  including
   'Shadows of Yog Sothoth'.)

                                   THE BOOK
      My memories are very confused.   There is even much doubt as to where
   they begin;   for at times I  feel appalling vistas of  years stretching
   behind me,  while at other times it  seems as if the present moment were
   an isolated point in a grey,  formless infinity.   I am not even certain
   how I am communicating this message.  While I know I am speaking, I have
   a vague impression that some strange and perhaps terrible mediation will
   be needed to bear what I say to the points where I wish to be heard.  My
   identity, too, is bewilderingly cloudy.  I seem to have suffered a great
   shock -  perhaps from some utterly  monstrous outgrowth of my  cycles of
   unique, incredible experience.
      These cycles of  experience,  of  course,  all  stem from  that worm-
   riddled book.   I  remember when I found  it - in a  dimly lighted place
   near the black, oily river where the mists always swirl.  That place was
   very old,  and the ceiling-high shelves  full of rotting volumes reached
   back endlessly through windowless inner rooms and alcoves.   There were,
   besides,  great formless heaps of books on  the floor and in crude bins;
   and it  was in  one of  these heaps that  I found  the thing.    I never
   learned its title,  for the early pages  were missing;  but it fell open
   toward the end and  gave me a glimpse of something  which sent my senses
   reeling.
      There was a formula - a sort of list  of things to say and do - which
   I recognized  as something black and  forbidden;  something which  I had
   read of before in furtive paragraphs of mixed abhorrence and fascination
   penned  by those  strange ancient  delvers into  the universe's  guarded
   secrets whose decaying texts I loved to absorb.   It was a key - a guide
   - to certain gateways and transitions  of which mystics have dreamed and
   whispered since  the race  was young,   and which  lead to  freedoms and
   discoveries beyond  the three dimensions and  realms of life  and matter
   that  we know.    Not  for  centuries had  any  man  recalled its  vital
   substance or known where to find it,  but this book was very old indeed.
   No printing-press,  but  the hand of some half-crazed  monk,  had traced
   these ominous Latin phrases in unicals of awesome antiquity.
      I remember how the  old man leered and tittered,  and  made a curious
   sign with his hand when I bore it away.   He had refused to take pay for
   it, and only long afterward did I guess why.   As I hurried home through
   those narrow, winding, mist-cloaked waterfront streets I had a frightful
   impression of  being stealthily followed  by softly padding  feet.   The
   centuried,  tottering houses on both sides seemed alive with a fresh and
   morbid  malignity  -  as  if  some   hitherto  closed  channel  of  evil
   understanding had  abruptly been opened.   I  felt that those  walls and
   overhanging gables  of mildewed brick and  fungoid plaster and  timber -
   with eye-like,  diamond-paned windows that  leered - could hardly desist
   from advancing and crushing me... yet I had read only the least fragment
   of that blasphemous rune before closing the book and bringing it away.
      I remember how I read the book  at last - white-faced,  and locked in
   the attic room that I had long devoted to strange searchings.  The great
   house was very  still,  for I had  not gone up till  after midnight.   I
   think I had a family then - though  the details are very uncertain - and
   I know there were many servants.   Just what the year was, I cannot say;
   for since then I have known many  ages and dimensions,  and have had all
   my notions of time  dissolved and refashioned.   It was by  the light of
   candles that I read - I recall the  relentless dripping of the wax - and
   there were chimes that came every now and then from distant belfries.  I
   seemed to keep track of those chimes with a peculiar intentness, as if I
   feared to hear some very remote, intruding note among them.
      Then came the first scratching and fumbling at the dormer window that
   looked out high above the other roofs of the city.   It came as I droned
   aloud the ninth verse of that primal lay,  and I knew amidst my shudders
   what it meant.  For he who passes the gateways always wins a shadow, and
   never again can he be alone.  I had evoked - and the book was indeed all
   I had suspected.  That night I passed the gateway to a vortex of twisted
   time and vision,  and  when morning found me in the attic  room I saw in
   the walls and shelves fittings that which I had never seen before.
      Nor could I  ever see the world as  I had known it.    Mixed with the
   present  scene was  always a  little of  the past  and a  little of  the
   future,   and  every  once-familiar  object  loomed  alien  in  the  new
   perspective brought by  my widened sight.   From  then on I walked  in a
   fantastic dream  of unknown  and half-known shapes;   and with  each new
   gateway crossed,  the  less plainly could I recognize the  things of the
   narrow sphere to which I had so long  been bound.   What I saw about me,
   none else saw; and I grew doubly silent and aloof lest I be thought mad.
   Dogs had a fear of me, for they felt the outside shadow which never left
   my side.  But still I read more - in hidden, forgotten books and scrolls
   to which  my new vision  led me - and  pushed through fresh  gateways of
   space and being and life-patterns toward the core of the unknown cosmos.
      I remember the  night I made the  five concentric circles of  fire on
   the floor, and stood in the innermost one chanting that monstrous litany
   the messenger from Tartary had brought.    The walls melted away,  and I
   was swept  by a  black wind through  gulfs of  fathomless grey  with the
   needle-like pinnacle of unknown mountains miles below me.  After a while
   there was utter  blackness,  and then the light of  myriad stars forming
   strange,  alien constellations.   Finally I saw a green-litten plain far
   below me,  and discerned on it the twisted  towers of a city built in no
   fashion I had ever known or read of or dreamed of.   As I floated closer
   to that city  I saw a great square  building of stone in  an open space,
   and felt a hideous fear clutching at me.   I screamed and struggled, and
   after a blankness was again in my attic room sprawled flat over the five
   concentric circles on the floor.  In that night's wandering there was no
   more of strangeness than in many  a former night's wandering;  but there
   was more of  terror because I knew  I was closer to  those outside gulfs
   and worlds than I had ever been before.   Thereafter I was more cautious
   with my incantations,  for I had no wish  to be cut off from my body and
   from the earth in unknown abysses whence I  could never return...
                         Howard Phillips Lovecraft

           <>X<>X<>X<>X<>X<>X<>X<>X<>X<>X<>X<>X<>X<>X<>X<>X<>X<>X<>

                              THE CTHULHU MYTHOS
      The  Cthulhu  mythos  developed   from  Howard  Phillips  Lovecraft's
   experimentation in  the media  of modern  horror in  the magazine  Weird
   Tales in the 1920's  and 30's.   The Mythos embodies a  pantheon of evil
   beings  from other  space-time continua,   many of  whom possess  divine
   powers.   A fictitious  history of the interactions of  these beings and
   their alien worshipers on this world and other distant planets comprises
   the core  of the  Lovecraft mythology.   The  underlying theme  of these
   stories  lies  in the  attempts  of  these  beings to  achieve  physical
   manifestation on Earth  and the methods that foolish  mortals utilize in
   this goal.
      Because the idea  of a common mythos of places,   races,  and deities
   appears only gradually in HPL's work,  no  real attempt was made to make
   the cycle  logically coherent  until 1926 with  the publication  of "The
   Call of Cthulhu".   Further, HPL encouraged other authors,  particularly
   Clark Ashton Smith, Robert Bloch, August Derleth, Robert E.  Howard, and
   Frank Belknap  Long,  to enlarge upon  the Mythos in their  own fiction.
   Following HPL's death in 1937 a host  of other writers have made notable
   contributions to the Cthulhu cycle.  Thus, stories throughout the mythos
   are  often  contradictory or  overlapping,   making  a glossary  of  the
   elements of the cycle difficult.   For  reasons of simplicity and space,
   only those places,  races,  and deities which were mentioned in at least
   two of HPL's own stories are included.

   DEITIES:
      The Elder Gods  - Elsewhere referred to  as the "Great Ones"  and the
   "Other  Gods".    They are  a  group  of semi-benevolent  deities  which
   struggle  against  the  "Old  Ones".     HPL  left  this  group  greatly
   undeveloped and unexplored with the exception of the deity Nodens, "Lord
   of the Abyss",  who aids the  protagonist of "The Dream-Quest of Unknown
   Kadath".
      The Old  Ones -  The group of  evil deities  whose intrigues  are the
   subject of most of the cycle's  stories.   These deities often have both
   incorporal and corporal forms.   The primary goal of these beings was to
   extend their influence into the modern world.  All of the following gods
   are considered "Old Ones":
      Yog-Sothoth - The  "All-in-One and the One-in-All  of limitless being
   and  self -  the last,   utter sweep  which  has no  confines and  which
   outreaches fancy and mathematics alike",   Yog-Sothoth resembles an evil
   Brahma, the Hindu god of the unification of all existence.   He co-rules
   the pantheon  of Old  Ones with  Azathoth.   In  spite of  his seemingly
   indescribable  form,   we are  told  in  "The  Dunwich Horror"  that  he
   resembles "an octopus, centipede, spider kind o' thing" which is capable
   of physical manifestation on earth.
      Azathoth - "The blind idiot god who sprawls at the center of ultimate
   chaos",  "circled by  his flopping horde of  mindless amorphous dancers,
   and lulled  by the  thin monotonous piping  of a  demonic flute  held in
   nameless paws."  He,  "the Lord of all Things",  and his antithesis Yog-
   Sothoth the "One-in-All",  comprise a  dialectical universe.   Though he
   never visits our dimension,   he is seen by many astral  voyagers in the
   Mythos.
      Other Gods  - Often  confused with  the Elder  Ones because  of their
   name,   these are  the direct  servants  of Azathoth:   the dancers  and
   players.   They often  visit the highest peaks  of the world as  in "The
   Other Gods".
      Shub-Niggurath - "The Goat with a Thousand Young".  Direct servant to
   both Yog-Sothoth and Azathoth, he is the Pan-like fertility god.
      Nyarlathotep - "Soul and messenger"  of the Other Gods,  Nyarlathotep
   is represented  in two forms:    As "crawling  Chaos" and as  "The Black
   Man".  In the later form he is instrumental in organizing the ceremonies
   of witchcraft which allow the aliens to visit this dimension.
      Cthulhu - A semi-divine  being who is referred to as  a priest of the
   gods.   He leads an  aquatic race called the Deep Ones  who descended to
   earth from  the stars.  He  has been imprisoned  in R'lyeh by  the Elder
   Gods.

   RACES:
      The Deep Ones - A species of aquatic humanoids which inhabit the deep
   ocean trenches  of the  earth.   Most  attend their  god Cthulhu  who is
   imprisoned on the  island of R'lyeh,  though some have  chosen to settle
   near  coastal  fishing villages  as  demonstrated  in "The  Shadow  Over
   Innsmouth".   They  seem to be  governed by  Dagon who is  the immediate
   subordinate of Cthulhu.
      The  Old  Ones  of  Leng  - Ancient  race  of  aliens  who  inhabited
   magnificent cities near the southern pole.   They made a treaty with the
   Deep Ones to insure that each remains in their respective realms.   They
   are said to tentacled, barrel-shaped beings with starfish-like heads and
   membranous wings.
      The Shoggoths - A race of giant, amorphous creatures developed by the
   Old  Ones of  Leng  to be  used as  manual  laborers.   They  eventually
   rebelled and destroyed their masters' civilization.
      Mi-Go -  A race of  crab-like beings  which were identified  with the
   Abominable Snowman of the Himalayas by HPL.

   PLACES:
      R'lyeh - The  sunken island of Cthulhu which  periodically rises from
   the depths at different  points in the oceans of the  world.   It is the
   city of the Deep Ones and prison of their god.
      The Plateau of Leng - The home  of the Old Ones located in Antartica.
   "At the Mountain of Madness" gives the best description of this place.
      Kadath - The home of the Elder  Gods which lies in the "frozen waste"
   beyond  Leng.  It is the goal of all who seek truth and enlightenment.
      Arkham,  Massachusetts -  A fictitious town which was  the setting of
   many of HPL's stories.   It is patterned  after Salem and is the site of
   the Miskatonic University,  whose library  contains one of the forbidden
   copies of Abdul Alhazred's Necronomicon.
      Innsmouth, Massachusetts - Another fictitious village created by HPL.
   This town is  located near the site  of an off-shore settlement  of Deep
