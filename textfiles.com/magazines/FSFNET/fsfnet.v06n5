    Hello, all!  This is  the last  issue of  the 1986  calendar year,
and  the last  issue  of volume  six. It  contains  only two  stories,
although  I'm sure  that you  will  find the  issue highly  enjoyable.
Issue 7/1 will  be out soon after  the New Year, and  will contain the
second half  of John White's  story, as  well as an  interesting piece
by Glenn  Sixbury. That  issue will also  mark the  second anniversary
of FSFnet,  and it will be  our 28th issue.  I'll be sure to  write an
appropriately verbose editorial, of course.
    For  those of  you who  have not  received 6/4  (due to  a network
problem),  you may  request it  from CSNEWS  at MAINE  or TCSSERVE  at
TCSVM. I have (hopefully) corrected the problem for this issue.
    I'd like to  welcome our new subscribers, and wish  all and sundry
a joyous and fulfilling Yuletide. Onwards!

                       A Reintroduction to Atros
    My good  friend Orny  (well as far  as it is  possible to  call an
editor  a  friend)  has been  so  kind  as  to  point out  the  slight
difficulties   in  following   a   serial  which   has  been   running
intermittently in  FSFnet for nearly  a year now, especially  when the
last installment appeared  six months ago. Also, I'm  fairly sure that
several of  you haven't been  reading FSFnet  for that long.  This, of
course,  presents  a problem.  The  usual  solution  to this  sort  of
predicament  is  to remind  or  update  the reader  through  providing
clues  of  previous  events  in  the  story  line  itself  (e.g.  some
character explains  the situation to  a new character arriving  on the
scene.)  Well,  in my  opinion  that  sort  of  thing is  awkward  and
boring, particularly  for those who don't  need a review. So,  at this
particular point in time,  I refuse to do it. You'll  all just have to
bear it and be  lost. Touch luck. No, I'm just  joking. The purpose of
this introduction is  to provide you the reader with  a summary of the
previous  installments   in  the   Atros  serial.  This   is  intended
primarily as a  review for those who've read stories.  If you haven't,
I'd suggest if  at all possible that you do  so. Previous installments
are  "Rendezvous"   (VOL4N01),  "Dreamer's  Holiday"   (VOL4N02),  and
"Calls  of  Courtesy"   (VOL4N04).  All  of  these   back  issues  are
available from  TCSSERVE@TCSVM (preferably)  or from  CSDAVE@MAINE (if
you're  off Bitnet  or  have other  difficulties).  So having  cleared
that up, I'd best get on with it.

                        WARNING SPOILER FOLLOWS:
    The first  of "Rendezvous" introduces  the character of  Gilman, a
first rate  alchemist who is  a little  down on his  luck financially.
At  the opening  he is  awaiting the  arrival of  Atros, a  mysterious
street youth  who has  arranged for  Gilman to  prepare a  nepenthe of
Mahedeos,  a  powerful drug  which  prevents  dreaming of  all  sorts.
Atros arrives  in the  late in  the night and  asks for  the nepenthe,
but is  unable to provide  the final  payment. Gilman refuses  to hand
over the  drug and  is killed  by Atros  in a  moment of  anger. Atros
robs Gilman,  takes the nepenthe,  and leaves  the city of  Magnus for
the port  city of Dargon. During  the trip, Atros refrains  from using
the nepenthe and  experiences a remarkable dream  which symbolizes his
future. While he sleeps, Atros is watched from the shadows.
    In  "Dreamer's Holiday"  Atros is  enjoying  the life  of a  upper
class  merchant  in  Dargon's  autumn festival.  He  has  assumed  the
identity of  Raffen Yeggent,  a traveling merchant  who unsuccessfully
(and fatally)  attempted to rob him  during his journey to  Dargon. In
Dargon, he is  forced to attend stuffy noble balls  and ceremonies. He
is  adopted by  the courtly  couple Kite  & Pecora  (who spun  off for
their own  series in Orny's  "Respect thy Elders" VOL5N02,  VOL5N03, &
VOL6N01). At a  ball, they introduce Atros to Pravo,  a local scholar,
who is  working on a  book about  creation myths. Atros'  responses to
Pravo's  questions intrigue  and upset  the scholastic,  who cuts  off
the  conversation.  Later that  evening  on  the journey  home,  Atros
glimpses a  man who resembles Gilman,  the dead alchemist, but  due to
being separated  by a crowd, is  uncertain if it truly  is Gilman. The
rest of the  story is spent on Atros' speculations  on the survival of
Gilman and his purpose in Dargon.
    "Calls of Courtesy"  begins with Atros awakening  some weeks later
to find  the body  of Thad,  an old  acquaintance and  hired assassin,
draped over  his bed.  Thad has  been cleanly  murdered by  having his
neck broken,  probably in the  act of  killing Atros. Again,  Atros is
at a loss  to explain this. In  Orny's story, "Hands of  a Healer", in
the same  issue, it is  revealed that Thad was  involved in a  plot to
assassinate Lord  Clifton Dargon,  which was  first detailed  by Roman
in "The  Essence of Ur-Baal"  (VOL4N02) and "Ur-Baal  Magic" (VOL4N04)
(a soon  to be finished  trilogy). The  plot springs from  high placed
Dargon merchants  who wish to  subjugate the newly discovered  land of
Bichu for  their own  profit against the  wishes, and  foreign policy,
of  Lord   Clifton.  After   Atros  disposes   of  the   body,  Thad's
disappearance  cause some  concern  in the  conspirators, whose  ranks
included  the Royal  Physician/Healer,  all of  which  is detailed  in
"Hands  of a  Healer". As  the series  currently exists,  Atros is  as
unaware of the conspirators,  as they are of him, but  this is soon to
be remedied.  Later in  "Calls of  Courtesy", Darla,  a old  friend of
Atros' arrives from  Magnus bringing some of Atros  cached rare books.
She tells  Atros that  Gilman does  appear to  have survived.  He left
Magnus  for  Dargon,  soon  after  Atros  fled.  Not  wanting  another
another Thad like  incident, Atros takes Darla into  his confidence to
watch  over him  while he  takes his  drug controlled  sleeps. Without
his  knowledge Darla  browses through  his diaries  and papers  during
his sleeps.  The papers  tell of  the full lives  that Atros  has lead
during the  passing of  a single  dream. Again and  again, he  has led
tragic existences in  a variety of lives, all of  which he suspects to
be as real  as this. He has  sought out the nepenthe,  and other drugs
like it,  as his only  method of controlling these  tormenting dreams.
Atros fears that this  life to is only a dream  and stays distant from
everyone  because he  is  afraid  of yet  more  pain. Secretly,  Darla
loves and pities him.
    Well,  that pretty  much  concludes my  interruption  of the  real
submissions  to this  issue.  If  you have  any  complaints about  the
series or  the entire Dargon cycle,  do not fear to  write me directly
or  all the  writers  through  LISTSERV. I  sincerely  hope I  haven't
created more confusion than good.

                        Growing Concern: Atros 4
    A  sudden draft  of  late autumn  air set  the  handful of  tallow
candles illuminating  the interior of the  Inn of the Hungry  Shark to
fitful flickering.  As the tavern's  inhabitants at a few  hours after
midnight  consisted of  only the  sleepy-eyed staff  and a  few groggy
stragglers,  no one  had noticed  the soundless  opening of  the heavy
oak front  door. But  the prolonged  change in  temperature eventually
drew  stares.  For several  moments,  the  gray  cloaked figure  of  a
motionless  Atros  stood  in  stark contrast  to  the  overcast  night
beyound the  entrance way.  A change had  overcome his  appearance. He
no  longer bore  the guise  of Raffen  Yeggent with  its white  facial
talk  and near  foppish stylings.  Atros' long  brown hair  and somber
gray  floor-length  cloak fluttered  in  the  draft. But  more  subtly
Atros' eyes seemed  gripped by determination and touched  by a quality
of madness. It  was certain that most of the  tavern's clientele would
give Atros a wide berth and continual observation.
    Finally,  Atros  entered  and  quickly  located  the  night  shift
innkeep, a portly  war veteran whose strength and  firmness earned him
respect in an establishment frequented by roughens and cut throats.
    "I would  like to  speak with  you in private,"  Atros began  in a
low volume.
    "I'm  working. 'Sides,  if I  turn my  back for  a shake,  I'll be
robbed  blind by  customer and  lackey alike,"  the innkeep  answered,
clearing the bar counter of dirty mugs.
    "Perhaps that table  in the corner, you could watch  the room from
there," Atros suggested a bit impatiently.
    "Look here,  I haven't time  to spend  with every lonely  thug who
wanders in. Find  someone else to bugger!" The  innkeep's temper began
to show.
    "You..." Atros  began to raise  his voice, then thought  better of
it. "Perhaps  I should begin again."  Atros hefted a small  satchel of
coins onto  the counter but  kept his hand  on the bundle.  "Now, will
you talk?"
    "This way..."  The innkeep led Atros  to the corner table  and and
took  a  chair  with  his  back to  the  wall.  After  collecting  the
satchel, Atros selected the opposite wall.
    "What is this about?" the innkeep whispered.
    "I know  a man  named Thad  frequented this place  for a  few days
about two weeks ago."
    "There's many  a jack who  muster through  that door. I  don't let
names bother me much."
    "He  was exceptionally  tall and  broad, dark  black hair,  boyish
face  with  a  permanent  sneer.  A single  scar  here,"  Atros  added
pointing at his right temple.
    "Him. A bad sort, I hear rumors."
    "Whom did he  talk to here? Did he met  anyone? Get any messages?"
Atros asked eagerly.
    The innkeep seemed to  mull this over for a time  in his mind then
said "Let's see your coin. This'll take gold."
    Atros spread  the contents  of the  satchel and  added a  few gold
coins from  somewhere beneath the table.  As he was doing  this, Darla
entered the  tavern. Atros glanced once  at her and once  at a distant
empty  table.  Darla ducked  over  toward  that  table trying  not  to
attract  attention. The  innkeep was  so  lost in  counting the  coins
with his eyes that he missed this exchange.
    Seeming  satisfied,  the innkeep  began,  "He  spoke with  no  one
'cept the whores...and  some men who let a room  upstairs for a time,"
he concluded in a whisper.
    "Who were they?" he asked, trying to keep his voice from carrying.
    "Like I say,  I don't know names...except maybe  one... It'll take
the  pile,"  the  innkeep  pointed   at  the  coins,  "those  men  are
dangerous and kept to themselves."
    "Fine. What was the name?" Atros answered quickly.
    "That one  didn't come  much. He  was always  trying to  slip past
but  his fine  clothes made  him odd  enough to  notice. I'd  seen him
before...had him pointed  out to me at any rate.  He was," the innkeep
hesitated and  looked uncomfortable, "Dargon's  High Wizard...Griswald
Butsum or somethin' or other." His whisper was nearly inaudible.
    Atros could  not contain a  surprised expression as he  pushed the
coins  across the  table to  the  innkeep, who  eagerly gathered  them
into a pouch hidden inside his cloak.
    "These men, what did they look like? How many were they?"
    The  innkeep  delayed before  answering.  "I'm  already deep  into
somethin'  big. Somethin'  I don't  understand. No  more answers."  He
began to get up.
    "Wait!" Atros caught him by the wrist. "I'll double that amount."
    "What use  is gold to a  dead man?" the innkeep  pronounced, broke
free forcibly, and hurried into the kitchen.
    Atros stood, crossed the room, and motioned for Darla to follow.
    Once  they  had  left  the  tavern and  were  safely  walking  the
darkened  streets   side  by  side,   Darla  asked  "So   what's  this
tremendous thing you've learned?"
    "How do you know I learned anything at all?" Atros asked.
    "You wouldn't have given up a small fortune for nothing."
    This remark broke  Atros' stride for a moment but  he was quick to
recover.  "Be  that as  it  may,  everything  seems to  becoming  more
complicated."  As they  walked, Atros  quickly and  precisely informed
Darla of his discussion with the innkeep.
    "You haven't  any enemies in  Dargon that  I don't know  about, do
you?" Darla asked playfully.
    "No, not  that I know of,"  Atros answered, "I'm worried  that the
high wizard  was contracted  to finish  the task  that Thad  failed. I
generally avoid tangles with wizards of all sorts."
    "Seems to be a good policy," Darla responded.
    "You've  been around  me too  much  these past  few weeks,  you're
starting to pick up my dry sense of humor," Atros observed chidingly.
    "Perhaps," Darla agreed solemnly.
    Atros stopped walking  and waited until Darla turned  back to face
him. "Are  you mocking  me?" His voice  was steady,  betraying neither
anger nor humor.
    "No! Of  course not. I wouldn't  do a thing like  that." Darla was
perhaps over  quick to reply. "I've  just learned so much  from you. I
pick up things quickly," she finished weakly.
    Expressionless   Atros  began   walking   again.  They   continued
together some distance in silence.
    "If  you are  so quick  to learn,  why have  your reading  lessons
gone so slowly?" Atros asked looking forward.
    Darla  gasped quietly  then said  "I haven't  the patience  or the
time. I just can't see what use it all is."
    Atros began,  "Books are any  culture's, or any man's,  sole means
of  preserving themselves.  They  are reservoirs  of information  that
would otherwise be lost..." He continued in the same vein.
    The rest  of the lecture  was lost on  Darla. She was  overcome by
relief for  managing to distract  Atros from  her deception. It  was a
small  thing really.  But she  felt that  if her  ability to  read was
discovered, Atros would  lose all trust in her. She  felt guilty about
reading Atros'  personal papers and  diaries but couldn't  resist. She
was  worried that  her knowledge  showed.  She had  made several  near
slips over  the past two  weeks and  had thought that  Atros' question
about  her lessons  might have  arisen from  well founded  suspicions.
But  apparently her  answer had  placated him.  Caught up  in her  own
thoughts, she listened to Atros' voice drone with an occasional nod.
    Thus both  were being slightly  incautious when suddenly  a bright
light from  the alley way before  them stung their eyes.  The surprise
was complete,  their response  predictable. They  threw up  their arms
to block the  blinding rays of a phosphorus lamp  and were momentarily
stunned  into  inaction.  A  disembodied voice  to  the  right  called
Atros' name and  he turned removing his hand from  is face. An instant
later  he was  tackled  from the  rear. An  armored  man seized  Darla
while  another attempted  to bind  her hands.  As her  vision cleared,
she  screamed  and  fought,  kicking indiscriminately  with  her  feet
while trying to  break her arms free. Atros was  having trouble of his
own. Through  more accident than skill  he managed during his  fall to
break free  of the arms  clinched about his waist  and to roll  to his
feet. Atros' assailant  landed face first on the  cobblestones and was
slow to recover.
    Atros  took the  opportunity to  draw  his rarely  used sword  and
survey his  opponents. There were  three, all armed, all  armored, and
all somewhat  experienced. Atros  felt a  sinking feeling  his stomach
but  managed a  quick  flourish  and charged  his  assailant, who  now
stood  between Darla  and  himself. The  tackler  had apparently  been
chosen more  for mass than for  quickness. Still his armor  would turn
all but  Atros' best placed  thrusts. Atros  seemed doomed to  fight a
war  of attrition  with the  giant, who  now bore  a hand  and a  half
sword, a weapon  capable of splitting the unarmored Atros  in half. It
was  times  like  this,  that  Atros  wished  he'd  taken  real  sword
wielding  lessons or  at least  bothered to  select a  religion. Atros
cursed himself,  distracted by that  thought he had missed  a critical
opening. Atros  resolved to fight  instinctively and cut  off thinking
so much. He allowed his anger to flare. He must make it to Darla.
    After several  moments of  futile effort,  the onslaught  that was
Darla relented.  Without a weapon,  she could only  inconvenience, not
harm, her  two armored opponents.  It occurred  to her that  perhaps a
more subtle strategy  might be called for. Almost as  soon as her fury
subsided,   one   of   her  assailants,   noticing   his   companion's
difficulties  with Atros,  pronounced "Here,  take her",  shoved Darla
into his partner, and strode toward the more active melee.
    Atros was  tiring rapidly  now. He  was out  of condition  and the
nepenthe  seemed to  drain his  endurance. He  met the  entrance of  a
second  opponent  into  the  fray   with  mixed  emotions.  He  seemed
certainly  doomed  now, but  perhaps  Darla  could  find a  chance  to
escape. She'd done nothing; it must be him they wanted.
    The  outcome of  the  battle  had long  been  decided. Atros'  two
opponents  began to  jeer  and taunt  him, as  he  grew steadily  more
helpless. Atros'  anger gave him  some strength,  but it would  not be
enough. He  fought on,  knowing he appeared  awkward and  comical now.
He almost wished they'd end it quickly, if only to save his pride.
    At long last,  the obvious occurred to the ruffian  who held Darla
captive. "Wait," he  called out to his companions, "we  have the girl.
We can  make him  stop fighting."  He held  one of  Darla's arms  in a
painful  hold behind  her  back.  Still, she  did  not struggle.  Like
Atros, she seemed to have accepted her fate.
    "Why?  It's  just becoming  fun,"  the  taller opponent  responded
while swinging his sword in a wild, wide arc.
    "We  can take  them alive.  We'd get  more gold  for it,"  Darla's
captor  suggested.  Distracted  by   the  conversation,  his  hold  on
Darla's arm was loosening.
    "What makes  you think that?  Nobody said anything  about bringing
them in  alive," snapped  the third finishing  in a  child's rendition
of a fiendish grin.
    Darla  saw her  opportunity  and  took it.  She  clutched a  short
dagger from  her captor's belt and  attempted to drive the  blade into
his exposed neck.  Her aim was poor  but she did manage  a painful and
bloody gash to the base of his chin, just left of his Adam's apple.
    He  whirled,  cried  "Bitch",  and struck  her  across  her  right
temple  with his  gauntleted  hand.  She never  noticed  that a  small
punch  dagger was  affixed  to the  back of  his  gauntlet. The  blade
scraped  bone and  Darla went  down in  a slight  spray of  blood. She
lapsed into unconsciousness.
    Atros let  out a  piercing shriek  and tried  to break  through to
Darla, but  was prevented by  his two opponents. Confusion  reigned as
the combat  became a scuffle.  After a  few long moments  of wrestling
on  the darkened  cobblestones, Atros  felt the  weight of  his larger
attacker lifted  from him and  heard a resounding crash  some distance
away.  He looked  up to  see  the outline  of a  short cloaked  figure
leaning over  tussle. The man took  hold of his remaining  opponent by
the  head  and   quickly  snapped  his  cervical   vertebrae.  With  a
momentary feeling  of deja  vu, Atros pushed  the corpse  off himself.
His rescuer extended  a hand to help Atros to  his feet. Atros noticed
that  the hand  was  large, coarse,  and cool.  The  distant sound  of
fleeing footsteps could be faintly heard.
    "They're gone?" Atros inquired shaken.
    The  cloaked man  nodded  and walked  over  to Darla's  motionless
body.  Atros had  enough  sense to  fetch  the overturned  phosphorous
lamp to  aid in  examining her  wounds. He  stumbled a  bit, obviously
exhausted, but he couldn't ignore Darla's need now to rest.
    For the  first time, their  rescuer's face was illuminated  by the
light of the lamp.
    "Gilman!" Atros shouted, unable to control his surprise.
    "Gilman  no longer..."  He  spoke softly  in  monotone. "Though  I
remember  being Gilman  once." Looks  of fear,  comprehension and  awe
swept  across Atros'  features. He  stood stunned  while Gilman  began
binding Darla's wounds with strips of fabric from his tunic.
    "Who...What are you now?" Atros inquired softly, hesitantly.
    "A  servant of  our  master, yours  and  mine," Gilman  pronounced
ominously. "You understand." It was not a question.
    "My tormentor," Atros whispered under his breath.
    "Yes  that  too... You  must  go  quickly  now.  I will  hold  off
pursuit." Though  the opponent  had been repelled,  both instinctively
knew they would return soon in greater numbers.
    "I have so many questions," Atros began.
    "They will wait," Gilman cut in. "I have a message for you."
    Atros hesitated, reluctant to ask. Finally, he nodded.
    "All of your  preparations are unnecessary. To meet  the master of
your dreams you  need only to hold the desire  and to sleep." Gilman's
words rung like a muffled bell to Atros' ears.
    Drawing into  himself, Atros' only acknowledgement  of the message
was a soft grunt or moan. He had hoped that he was wrong.
    "Go   now...quickly,"  Gilman   advised,  lifting   the  partially
conscious Darla to  her feet. Atros supported her  and began hurriedly
limping away.
    After  a short  distance, Darla  could walk  no farther  even with
Atros'  support. Her  mind wasn't  lucid  then. She  hummed softly  to
herself and spoke  in fragments of remembered  conversations. No tears
stained  Atros' cheeks  as he  lifted the  semiconscious Darla  in his
arms  and staggered  under  his  burden, but  only  because Atros  had
forgotten how  to cry  long ago.  Atros knew that  she needed  a place
where she could  receive immediate medical help and much  rest, but no
such  haven existed  in  this  neighborhood. It  would  be foolish  to
return to the  flophouse now as well.  His best hope for  a healer lay
in the  wealthier areas nearer The  Keep. He was well  past his normal
physical  limits  of endurance  and  he  knew  that he  would  require
several days  recuperation himself. Trying  to block out his  own pain
and  exhaustion,  Atros  carried  Darla  though  the  empty,  darkened
streets  of Dargon  for  a time  that seemed  to  stretch into  hours.
Atros' own  mind began to lose  clarity and he lost  his direction. He
wandered aimlessly  for some time,  occasionally calling out  to empty
alley ways or vague shapes.
    As  he grew  weaker  and  his thoughts  more  primitive, his  only
desires  were flight  and safety.  The weakness  and pain  blurred his
senses. It was  in this condition that Atros, with  Darla in his arms,
staggered into a  darkly dressed gentleman stepping out  of a darkened
doorway. The  man cried  out in  surprise as Atros  sank to  his knees
still supporting Darla.
    Seeing  the blood  and bandages,  the man  exclaimed "She's  hurt.
Quickly inside,  in the light,"  and helped Atros carry  Darla through
the entrance way  into a dimly lit  foyer They placed Darla  on a hard
wooden bench cushioned  with woolen cloaks from pegs on  the walls. As
soon as  this was finished, the  gentleman turned up the  oil lamp and
turned  toward Atros  and Darla.  Without the  facial talc  it took  a
moment for  recognition to  dawn on  him. "Raffen!?!  Raffen Yeggent?"
he exclaimed.
    Atros  looked at  the  gentleman's  face for  the  first time  and
dimly remembered  speaking to the  man once  at dance hall  during the
festival. Could  it have been  only a  few weeks ago?  Atros' thoughts
cleared and he  remembered the scholar who studied  myths and legends.
"Pravo" he said weakly.
    "Who is  the girl? No, never  mind that now. It  doesn't matter. A
friend of yours, I suppose?" Pravo asked.
    Groggily, Atros nodded. He couldn't keep up with Pravo's words.
    "Don't  worry. I'll  take  care  of her.  She'll  be alright.  You
rest. You look exhausted." Pravo's tongue seemed hyperactive.
    Once again, Atros nodded.
    Pravo  set  to  examining   Darla's  wounds  while  Atros  slumped
against the  base of the  opposite wall. Pravo's hands  worked quickly
and  efficiently. He  seemed to  know  what he  was doing  and at  the
moment that was good enough for Atros who slid into a stupor.
    But Pravo wouldn't let him rest. "How did this happen?" he asked.
    "Muggers in the street," Atros answered barely conscious.
    "Where?" Pravo inquired.
    "Down by  the wharves  near the Hungry  Shark," Atros  smiled with
his eyes closed, seeming amused, but Pravo never looked back at him.
    "They take your purses? Why'd they hurt her? What's her name?"
    "Darla," Atros answered, slightly amused.
    "The  initial  bandaging was  done  quite  skillfully. She  hasn't
lost much blood. She'll be fine in a few days. Maybe a scar though."
    "Good."  Atros began  to chuckle  quietly to  himself but  stopped
when  he realized  it  wasn't really  funny. After  a  few moments  he
drifted into unconsciousness.

    Atros awoke  a few hours before  dawn on the entry  way floor with
a coarse  blanket over him.  He was confused and  slightly frightened.
But  after several  moments  of sitting  in the  dimly  lit room,  the
events of  last night came  to him. Darla no  longer lay on  the bench
and Pravo  was no place  to be found. Atros'  arms and legs  were sore
beyound  imagining. He  got up  slowly, stiffly  and wandered  further
into the house.  The second door he  came to was open.  A short tallow
candle burned on  a high shelf. Darla lay in  a large comfortable bed.
In the  soft glow she  looked very beautiful, very  vulnerable. Seeing
the bandages  covering her  temple, Atros  felt a  surge of  guilt. He
knelt beside the bed and took her hand into his own.
    "I'm sorry  Darla, I never meant  for anything to happen  to you,"
Atros began. Darla moved slightly in her sleep.
    "They wanted  me and  you were a  convenient tool."  His breathing
was irregular, his voice hoarse. Darla stirred slightly.
    "You  must forgive  me. I've  failed you.  I let  them hurt  you,"
Atros went on weakly, eyes cast downward.
    "Shhhh. Be  quiet, Atros....You have  nothing to be  forgiven for.
You  don't  don't have  to  protect  me.  I've  always taken  care  of
myself." Darla reached out to Atros and gently stroked his dark hair.
    "I'm no  swordsman...no hero. A quick  jab of a blade  in surprise
maybe, but  not a real fight."  Atros' voice cracked. Still,  he could
not face her.
    "I know,  Atros. I know.  But you are a  hero. My hero.  You saved
me and  provided for me.  My wounds are my  own fault. You  have cared
for me. You have nothing to be ashamed of." She was gentle, motherly.
    There was a long silence.
    It  was broken  finally by  the entrance  of Pravo.  "I thought  I
heard  talking," he  said entering  in  a nightshirt.  "You should  be
both be asleep,"  he said accusingly. "There will be  time for talking
tomorrow.  Darla  needs  her   rest."  Pravo  sounded  annoyed  though
inwardly he was  happy to find Darla  awake, it was a  good sign. "Oh,
yes Darla,  we haven't been  formally introduced. I'm Pravo,  a friend
of Raffen,  and master of this  house. You are welcome  here until you
are well  again. The  healer has  gone now,  but will  return tomorrow
and  guarantees that  you will  be well  soon. Provided  you rest,  of
course."  Pravo said  smiling. "Now,  if you  excuse me,  I will  show
Raffen to his room."
    Pravo took  Atros by the  hand and escorted  him down the  hall to
another  bed room.  Atros tried  to as  if he  were totally  well, but
Pravo could  not avoid noticing his  stiff gate. The room  which Pravo
gave  him  was  not  nearly  as grand  as  Darla's,  which  Atros  now
realized must be that of the lady of the house. Atros inquired.
    Pravo said, "That room is vacant. I live alone now."
    Atros  was  surprised, to  live  in  such  a large  house  without
servants was unusual. He asked, "You are widowed?"
    Pravo  answered  obviously painfully,"No.  My  wife  left me  many
years ago. I dismissed the staff."
    Atros was sorry that he had asked.
    Pravo changed the  subject. "There is water is  the pitcher, linen
in the chest, as well as some clothing that might fit."
    Pravo  turned to  Atros,  seemed  to consider  for  a moment  then
said,  "She calls  you 'Atros'....There  was an  'Atros' in  Arbor two
years back... Who are you?" Pravo asked, facing Atros.
    "What do you know of that man in Arbor?" he responded cautiously.
    "Very  little really.  He stayed  with a  colleague of  mine named
Baughis.  Baughis  wrote  a  letter  praising  his  Atros'  scholastic
talents and congratulating  himself for the find of  such a remarkable
young talent  in the slums." Pravo  paused a moment. "The  next letter
was filled  with curses upon  an ungrateful runt who  relieved Baughis
of  half his  library and  departed unexpectedly."  Pravo straightened
his stance and looked Atros in the eye. "You are that Atros, no?"
    "No.." Atros said  obviously lying. But after a moment  "Yes, I am
that Atros....You  must forgive  me. Those  books were  very important
to  me  at the  time.  I  took them  only  because  my need  was  very
great...You must  understand." A  distraught Atros  plead. If  only he
could justify himself to someone just this once.
    "Understand?"  Pravo watched  the youth,  made some  decision, and
chuckled.  "I  nearly laughed  myself  to  death reading  that  second
letter." Pravo continued  smiling, "Baughis is a pompous  old fool who
never finished  a book in  his life. It just  pleases his ego  to play
at being  a great mind.  He buys rare  books with inherited  money and
then  gets great  pleasure form  having more  renown and  less wealthy
scholars beg  to borrow some unique  tome. No, I have  no qualms about
that incident...But Raffen, Atros rather, who are you really?"
    A  moments silence  passed. "It's  been so  long...I really  don't
know anymore," Atros replied weakly.
    "Come now, you are still young. It could not be so long a story."
    "But  it  is.   A  very  long  story  filled   with  lifetimes  of
memories...They  all begin  to  run together...I  am  uncertain. I  no
longer know truth from lie, reality from dream." Atros mind drifted.
    "You are  still tired,"  Pravo says  sounding concerned.  "We will
talk when your mind is cleared. Sleep now." Pravo left the bedroom.
    Atros retrieved  the bottle  of nepenthe  from his  satchel, began
to unstopper the cork, and then hesitated for a long moment.
    "No,  despite  what  Pravo  thinks,  I  am  still  strong...Strong
enough for this."  Atros whispered to himself, then  returned the drug
to the  satchel. He  laid down  on the firm  straw pallet  and quickly
fell asleep.

                             Glasmelyn Llaw
                          Part One:  The Tower
    Deep in the  forestland south of Dargon there stands  a Tower, far
from anywhere,  off all beaten paths.  Sixty feet high it  stands, and
it  bears five  "finger"  turrets  that rise,  one  from  each of  the
above-ground floors, sixty  feet themselves - lifting the  roof of the
highest turret 110 feet above the leaf-covered ground.
    The  Tower  is a  marvel  of  architecture made  from  smooth-cut,
dry-set, green  crystalline stone  which, with  its turrets,  gives it
its name  - Glasmelyn  Llaw: The  Emerald Hand. It  is obvious  to any
casual observer  that it was  not erected  by mortal hands:  its lines
have an  ethereal, otherworldly beauty  and grace that  summons images
of equiraptors and gryphons flying about and roosting on its turrets.
    The Tower  has stood  for a  very long time;  since the  plains of
the  northwest  become  carpeted  with  forest;  since  the  land  was
colonized by  a sea-faring nation, who  built a fortress at  the mouth
of the  only navigable  river to safeguard  its cities  from invasion;
since that  colony eventually died out  as support was lost  after the
parent nation  was besieged  and conquered; since  the re-colonization
of  the land  by the  youthful, growing  kingdom of  Baranur, and  the
founding  of a  new duchy,  given to  an accomplished  young commander
named Anton  Dargon who turned an  old watch-fort at the  mouth of the
Coldwell into  the ducal  seat. And, the  Tower has  stood, unnoticed,
while Dargon (the  duchy) has grown, and Dargon (the  city) has spread
across the mouth of the river it sits upon.
    Its builder was  a wizard in the days when  wizards were as common
as  fleas on  a  wild dog,  if  a  little more  feared.  His name  was
Tarlada, and  he was very powerful  among his kind, mostly  because of
the extensive  research and collecting  he had  taken the time  to do.
His ability  made others  jealous, and they  imagined that  they, too,
could be  as powerful as Tarlada,  and without the time  he had taken,
if they  managed to  kill him, and  take the fruits  of his  labors as
their own.
    Tarlada was more  than just a scholar  of magic - he  was adept at
his  craft. Because  of this,  he  managed to  survive three  surprise
attacks  by   his  fellow  wizards   who  wanted  his   grimoires  and
artifacts. But he  knew that he couldn't hold out  forever. So, he had
his tower built  by magical means (untouched by human  hands, it was),
and hoped  that living in  it would be safer  than where he  had lived
before. He  was wrong.  Two more  attacks made him  angry, and  just a
little afraid. Afraid enough to take a rather drastic step.
    He knew that  eventually his attackers would catch  him totally by
surprise,  or asleep,  and get  the  best of  him, taking  all of  his
hard-earned  spell-lore  as  their  own.  So,  he  began  to  do  some
research into  several large  iron-bound volumes  for a  certain spell
that he had heard of once.
    It was there,  and it would do  what he needed it  to. He gathered
the  materials  necessary, which  took  several  months, and  then  he
began the rituals  necessary to activate the spell. When  he was done,
several  more  months  later,  he  had  instilled  into  his  tower  a
purpose. Not life,  but just a purpose  - to protect him  from harm in
any way  necessary. The  spell gave the  Tower enough  intelligence to
carry out its  job, and the means  to as well, in the  form of several
magical weapons,  and the  ability to adapt  several energy  stores to
contingency uses, as it saw fit.
    Tarlada was  well pleased with his  work, and he showed  it off to
any and  all. He was  now secure from  outside harm, and  finally able
to return his life to normal.
    But, his  enemies weren't so  pleased. They found  his enchantment
to  be  very  successful  -   anyone  who  attacked  the  tower  found
themselves  absorbed   into  the  energy  reserves   for  future  use.
Eventually,  the greedy  ones  began  to leave  him  alone, for  which
Tarlada was glad.
    Tarlada was  a solitary  sort of  person. He  had friends,  but he
had built  his tower so  far away from  everything that he  seldom had
visitors,  especially since  the attacks  stopped. Many  years passed,
and Tarlada barely noticed them, so wrapped up was he in research.
    And then,  one day he  was in  the laboratory when  the door-chime
rang. He  hurried down  stairs and  opened the  door, and  saw Lars'n,
his very  best friend and  companion all during his  apprenticeship to
his  master K'am.  But, Lars'n  appeared ancient,  all bent  and grey,
and  they had  been of  an age  when studying  under K'am  and Tarlada
both felt and looked no more than mid-thirty or so.
    Lars'n's voice was  as old as his appearance. "Ah,  my friend," he
rasped  weakly, "this  is  indeed a  marvel. You  haven't  aged a  bit
since last  I saw  you, what,  sixty or  seventy years  ago? Remember,
just after  Red Mergan tried  to attack your  tower? He was  the last,
wasn't he? So, tell me how you manage to look so young?"
    Tarlada was  stunned. Eighty  years? It  was impossible!  What was
going  on?!?  He  invited  his   old  friend  in,  and  they  chatted.
Eventually,  Tarlada told  Lars'n that  he had  no idea  that so  much
time had passed.  Lars'n looked thoughtful, and said,  "I feared this.
I think it  was unwise of you  to use that particular  spell. It seems
to be  doing its job  rather too well. Tell  me, friend, when  was the
last time you left this place?"
    Tarlada thought, and  said, "Well, I don't  rightly remember. Some
time  ago,  I think.  It  was  when Jiil  wanted  me  to come  to  her
wedding, I think. Just last year, wasn't that?"
    Lars'n  said, "Tarlada,  Jiil was  married seventy-one  years ago,
and  died  eight  years  ago.  She  outlived  her  children,  and  her
grand-children.  I met  one of  her great-grand-children  in Rihls  on
the way here, and  he is thirty-three years old. Come  with me back to
Irlenda,  just  for a  visit.  My  own great-great-grandchildren  have
heard stories about you - I'm sure that they would enjoy meeting you."
    Tarlada  was more  than a  little  frightened by  what Lars'n  had
told  him, and  what  he was  implying. So,  he  agreed. Without  even
packing, he helped Lars'n to the door, and tried to leave with him.
    But, he  couldn't pass the door.  Lars'n was on the  step outside,
watching  Tarlada's attempts  to pass  through the  door, shaking  his
head sadly.  "I'll try to help  you, my friend," he  called. He turned
away,  and began  to move  surprisingly  swiftly down  the very  faint
path that  led up  to the  door of the  Tower. And  that was  the last
time anyone left the Tower for a very, very long time.

                          Part Two:  The Prey
    "Are  you sure  that this  is really  a short-cut,  Maks?" Syusahn
asked. She really  didn't like the look of the  trees hereabouts, even
apart from  her natural  distrust of enclosed  spaces. Being  from the
south-eastern  steppes,  she  was  used  to  being  able  to  see  the
horizon,  and traveling  through this  forest was  unnerving. She  had
grown used  to it  a little after  the last five  days of  travel, but
the  forest  had  lately  changed  character.  It  now  seemed  almost
brooding,  or even  sinister. Perhaps  that  was due  to the  strange,
almost  iridescently   green,  yellow,   and  blue  vines   that  were
everywhere,  intertwined between  the  trees, across  the  top of  the
trail, and  even among the  grasses of  the trail itself.  Very little
sun managed  to filter through the  vines. The horses' hooves  and the
wagon's wheels  made very little noise  as they moved over  the trail,
and the  normal forest sounds -  insects, wind in the  leaves, and the
like -  were very muted.  It all made  Syusahn nervous and  anxious, a
feeling she disliked: ordinarily, she feared little.
    She  looked at  Maks,  her  betrothed, who  was  looking a  little
uncertain. Maks  was one of  the Rhydd Pobl, commonly  called gypsies.
He was  five foot seven, thickly  built, but not fat,  with dark brown
longish hair and  full beard and moustache. His eyes  were very black,
his  nose   very  large,  and   his  face  rather  squarish,   but  in
combination, he  was very handsome.  They had met four  months before,
when  his  tribe was  moving  through  her  homeland, and  had  fallen
immediately in  love. It had  taken a while  for his family  to accept
one of  the Gwynt Gyrun  - Wind Riders -  as Maks' betrothed,  but she
finally  convinced  them that  she  and  Maks belonged  together.  The
first  banns had  been cried  in  the camp  of her  people, and  Maks'
tribe  had sworn  to  cry the  second banns  when  they reached  their
spring camp.  She and  Maks had  tarried in  her homeland  for several
weeks, and then  had taken to the  road more slowly than  was the norm
for  a gypsy  caravan, but  when they  finally arrived  at the  spring
camp in  the northwest  part of  the Kingdom of  Baranur, near  a city
named Dargon,  the banns would be  cried for the third  time, and they
would be wed at the mid-summer gathering of tribes.
    Maks finally  said, "The maps  of my people  say that this  is the
shortest way  to the  camp site.  We are  children of  the road  - our
maps  do not  lie. This  is the  right way."  But he  wasn't truly  so
certain. The maps  of the Free People  never lied, but the  one he was
following made  no mention of  this strange patch of  forestland. What
really worried  him, though,  was the  fact that his  map had  an area
marked as dangerous just  a few miles to the west  of where they were,
and the description matched how these woods looked.
    Maks  glanced at  Syusahn, and  noticed  the worried  look on  her
face. He knew how  she felt about the forest, and  had thought she was
over it,  but the  strange feel  of the  forest here  probably brought
all of her fears back in full.
    For  Maks,  the happiest  day  of  his life  was  the  day he  met
Syusahn.  She had  come charging  up to  the caravan  on a  wild black
mare,  riding bareback  and brandishing  a slim  sword and  looking as
deadly  as the  fifteen other  youths -  mostly male  - who  were also
test-charging the  band of  gypsies "invading" their  territory. Maks'
people knew  the ways of  the Gwynt Gyrun  and held their  ground, and
the charging  riders veered off at  the last minute. Syusahn  had come
back almost  immediately, as intrigued  with the young  wagonmaster as
he  was with  her. They  had been  much together  during the  southern
trading  season, and  had very  swiftly declared  their love,  and had
taken the  matter to their elders.  Syusahn's father, khan of  a small
but fierce  khanate, had immediatly  given his permission for  them to
wed. Maks'  own people  were more reluctant,  but eventually  gave in.
They   made   the  Four-Ring   Promise   to   her  people,   and   the
Knife-and-Wheel Pledge to his, and plans were made for the wedding.
    Maks was  sure he could not  have done better for  a wife. Syusahn
was short  - only five  foot two -  but not tiny  in any way.  She had
long,  flowing  raven-black hair,  and  an  almost elven  face:  oval,
fine-boned,   with  high   cheeks,   arching   eyebrows  over   green,
silver-flecked  eyes, a  short  nose,  and a  full,  sweet mouth  that
flashed gleaming  white teeth whenever  she laughed, which  was often.
Her  body was  surprisingly full  at  chest and  hips for  so short  a
woman, and  her waist  was very  narrow - features  she liked  to show
off  by wearing  very tight  clothes, usually  in red  and black,  and
lots of  leather at  waist, wrists,  and feet.  She also  went heavily
armed, though  with more than  the slim sword at  her waist -  she had
at least  a dozen small, sharp  knives secreted about her  person, and
she was an  expert in either throwing them, or  close in-fighting with
them. In all, she  had such energy, such a joy in  life, that Maks was
sometimes amazed that  she would choose to settle down  with him - but
then, a gypsy's life is seldom dull, either.
    They  rode late  into the  night,  the lamps  on Maks'  wagon-home
lighting the  way long before  the sun actually  set due to  the gloom
of the  overhanging vines. Also, they  were anxious to make  good time
through  this strange  forest, and  so didn't  stop like  they usually
did at  the first sign of  red sky in  the west. They finally  found a
clearing in  which to camp  not more  than two hours  before midnight,
and ate  a hasty supper, then  retired to the single  bed together and
tried, with some  success, to blot out their  individual uneasiness in
the joy of merging.
    Syusahn awoke  about an  hour after  the two  of them  had finally
fallen  asleep,  feeling the  call  of  nature.  She hesitated  for  a
moment,  not relishing  the prospect  of going  into the  woods alone,
but then  she steeled her  courage, muttered  a prayer to  Karoga, the
Wind God, to keep her safe, dressed fully, and went outside.
    She was  returning to  the warmth  and safety  of the  wagon, when
she thought  she saw a  light flickering between the  trees. Curiosity
got the better of  her, and she tried to get  a better view, promising
herself that she wouldn't go far.
    Meanwhile, Maks  awakened alone,  and wondered where  Syusahn was.
He  pulled  aside the  curtain  on  one  of  the windows,  and  looked
outside  in time  to see  Syusahn disappearing  into the  trees across
the  clearing. He  hurriedly  threw  on his  pants  and  a cloak,  and
dashed out after her.
    Syusahn  found it  surprisingly  easy to  move  through the  trees
after the  light, but she  couldn't seem to get  any closer to  it. In
the heat  of the  chase, she forgot  all about her  promise not  to go
far. She didn't even  think about getting lost - it  was very hard for
a steppes-rider to get lost if the sky was visible.
    Maks  was having  more difficulty.  The vines  seemed not  only to
block his  way, but to actively  hinder him by catching  him, tripping
him, making  it very hard  to follow his love.  He called out  to her,
but she  didn't seem  to hear.  So, he  drew his  knife, and  began to
blaze his own way to her.
    Syusahn did  hear him, once, but  as she began to  turn to answer,
the  light seemed  to  take a  wrong  turn, and  it  got almost  close
enough to  see clearly, and  she took up  the chase again.  She didn't
hear  any of  his cries  after that  - in  fact, she  began to  forget
about everything but the light and the trees between it and her.
    Maks managed  to get  close enough  to his love  to see  the light
she  was   following.  She  saw   it  as  a   flickering,  yellow-red,
torch-like blob,  but he saw  that it  was really a  pale green-yellow
globe  of  light  floating  about   head-high  above  the  ground.  He
recognized  the  will-o-the-wisp,  and  called out  even  louder,  but
Syusahn was  deeply ensnared and  she didn't  hear him. He  fought the
vines harder, trying  to reach her, but the vines  were fighting back,
and now  the trees themselves  were joining in, throughsting  up roots
to  trip  him,  and  waving  branches  in  his  face.  He  fought  on,
following Syusahn  as she followed  the light,  for a very  long time.
He was nearly exhausted when he came to the end of the trail.
    And that  was a  tower. Huge  and menacing,  it was  surrounded by
vines as  thick as trees twined  utterly impassably save for  a narrow
pathway that led up  to the door. He saw Syusahn  enter the tower, and
the  door close.  He  ran up  the  path to  the door,  but  it had  no
handle,  no way  of  opening it.  He  beat on  the  door, calling  for
whoever was  within to  open it  and face him,  or give  back Syusahn,
but there  was no  answer, at  least not from  within. But,  the vines
that formed  walls that framed  the path  began to close  in, reaching
out  for him,  pulling and  whipping at  him. They  eventually got  so
violent  that  he had  to  run,  fleeing before  increasingly  violent
vegetation that  was driving him away  from his love, trapped  in that
strange, five-turreted tower.

                        Part Three:  Employment
    "It  was an  experiment," said  Cefn in  response to  the question
that Je'en finally got  up the nerve to ask. They  were sitting in the
common room  of the  Inn of the  Panther, at one  of the  rear tables.
Though they were  a rather strange couple, they had  spent enough time
there that  they had become  almost a  fixture and the  patrons barely
noticed them anymore.
    Cefn  was wearing  his  dark hood,  as usual,  and,  while no  one
could see  into the recesses of  the cowl, he could  see out perfectly
clearly.  It  had  taken  several  powerful  spells  to  contrive  the
special  darkness that  filled  his hood:  it allowed  him  to see  in
ordinary  light, a  simple feat  that he  would have  found impossible
without  it. He  stared  at Je'en  while  he told  her  of a  research
project that  had gone wrong, cursing  him with his glowing  blue eyes
and  a total  intollerance  for  normal light  of  any  kind. She,  of
course didn't notice  his staring, not being able to  see his eyes. In
that,  they were  evenly matched:  her silver  half-mask hid  her eyes
almost as effectively as his hood did his.
    He found  her fascinating.  He knew much  - if not  most -  of her
past,  and he  knew that  she had  an indomitable  spirit. Few  others
would have  been able to  start again in a  whole new life  as readily
and easily  as she had  done. And, being  a swordswoman suited  her as
well as being a Bard.
    He also  found her attractive.  She was  tall for a  woman, almost
taller than he,  and very sparely built. She  had sandy-blonde average
length hair  framing a  longish, well-formed face.  If trying  to find
faults, he  could have  listed her  nose, which was  too long,  or her
mouth, which was  too thin, but he liked her  hazel-grey eyes (when he
could see them,  which was rarely). Her arms and  legs were strong and
supple, and she  was long-fingered and graceful  (with allowances made
for  her near-crippled  right hand).  She was  wearing a  flatteringly
cut  green  and silver  tunic,  and  leather leggings  with  knee-high
boots. She  was armed,  with sword  and knife both  worn on  the right
side of  her belt. And,  of course, there was  the face mask,  and the
scar it hid.  Cefn was sure that  she still wore the mask  more out of
habit than  necessity: she  had built  up a  fine reputation  in town,
and no longer  had to worry about being taken  for a "poor, disfigured
woman".  Still, it  added to  her charm  and mystique,  and it  was no
odder than the hood he was forced to wear.
    Je'en  listened to  Cefn's tale  intently. He  seldom talked  much
about himself,  but then, neither  did she,  which made for  many long
silences when  they were together.  She had always wondered  about his
eyes, though,  ever since  she saw  the way  they glowed  so strangely
when  he had  rescued  her  from that  strange  limbo  place. She  had
seldom  seen them  since then,  except  at night,  or in  a very  dark
room, or  when he had  taken her to  visit his mansion-like  home, and
he had  used those strange golden  globes to light the  rooms. She had
been rather nervous  about asking him about them,  but finally decided
that she  wanted to know more  about this mysterious magician  who was
her partner.
    And,  perhaps there  was something  more. The  few times  that she
had been able  to see his face,  she saw that he was  very handsome in
an aristocratic  way. He had  short black  hair, and a  long moustache
beneath a perfect nose  and above a perfect mouth. She  had yet to get
close enough to tell  what the crest on his earring  was. He was tall,
six  feet or  more,  but not  quite  as tall  as her.  And,  he had  a
games-man's body, sleekly  muscled, not like what she thought  of as a
magician's body.  She had felt  an attraction  to him from  that first
day, but she was  wary of him, of his strangeness,  and of his powers.
She was glad  that he had offered  to be partners with her  - it would
allow them to get better acquainted.
    Much  had happened  between  that  first day  and  now. The  first
thing they  had done  as a  team was destroy  Lladdwr, the  sword that
the Cult  of Jhel had so  desperately wanted. That was  after Cefn had
gone to  a secret  meeting of  the Septent  disguised as  Brother Tri,
using  the  theryum to  help  his  masquerade.  He had  destroyed  the
entire  Septent, managing  to  take  them by  surprise,  and had  then
given the names of the other cultists to Dargon authorities.
    Destroying Lladdwr  should have been  easy, except that  the being
trapped within the sword  knew what was going to happen  to it, and it
did  its  best to  thwart  them.  But,  they eventually  succeeded  in
breaking the spells  on the blade, banishing the being  within it, and
melting  the shards  into a  surprisingly small  ingot of  very impure
iron. And,  the journey  back was  delayed by bad  seas, and  an early
winter. But, return they did, and safely.
    After that,  they advertised by  word of mouth  their availability
and  willingness to  solve problems  and  right wrongs  in and  around
Dargon.  They were  hired  to hunt  down some  wild  animals, and  two
outlaw bands  that were making  the frontier life even  more difficult
- nothing  too taxing to their  abilities. But, the last  of those had
been  last month,  and they  were getting  bored -  or at  least Je'en
was. She  wished for something  to do as  Cefn finished his  story and
went back to sipping at his mug of ale.
    She  happened to  glance at  the door  as a  very colorful  fellow
entered the Inn.  He was dressed in  a loose brown vest  over a loose,
multi-colored  tunic,  and  strange, flare-legged  black  pants.  From
that, and  his patterned sash,  she recognized  him as being  a gypsy,
probably  here for  the annual  gathering that  occurred just  west of
the city.
    He  looked  worried  as  he  scanned the  common  room.  His  gaze
settled on the strange pair at the back table and he hurried over.
    "You are Je'en and Cefn, the troubleshooters?" he asked.
    Cefn  spoke, somewhat  eeriely,  from the  recesses  of his  cowl.
"Yes, we are. Please, be seated. Can we help you?"
    The  man introduced  himself as  Maks, and  then he  explained his
problem. "Less than  a week passed, my betrothed was  taken captive by
someone who lives  in an old, vine-covered tower in  the forest to the
south  and west.  I  tried to  rescue  her, but  the  forest began  to
attack me  and drove  me away.  I rode  fast and  hard for  the spring
camp, to  get help,  but my  people had also  had several  losses from
traveling  that  track  and  didn't   know  what  to  do.  The  elders
eventually decided  to send for  help into  Dargon, and I  was elected
to  go. Please,  can you  help?  We have  heard about  you both,  even
things that  the gossipers do not  know, and the elders  are sure that
you  are the  only hope  for my  Syusahn and  the others  who vanished
into the forest."
    Je'en  was  immediately interested.  She  and  Cefn had  commented
earlier on a few  vague rumors that had been coming  in from the south
for a  few months  about strange  goings on in  the forest.  And, here
was  an   opportunity  to  investigate   them,  as  well   as  several
disappearances in the area as well. It sounded like fun.
    She said to Cefn, "What do you think?" while nodding her head.
    Cefn caught  her signal, and  said, "We will  do our best.  Do you
have a place to stay tonight? We will start at first light, tomorrow."

                         Part Four:  Suspicions
    Food for  the journey was  the hardest to  get hold of  before the
departure  time set  by  Cefn.  But, with  some  help  from Jann,  the
innkeeper of  the Panther, Je'en  and Cefn  managed to get  enough for
about a  month on the  trail, just in  case. The other  equipment they
planned  to take  came from  their  personal stock,  which wasn't  all
that large - Je'en hoped that they were adequately prepared.
    They all met  at the Inn shortly after sunrise.  With a minimum of
discussion,   mainly   about   their  initial   heading,   the   three
distributed the  equipment between their  horses, and set  off quietly
through the silent streets of Dargon to the south.
    Je'en  rode the  chestnut  mare  that had  been  Mahr's. Mahr  had
named  it  Chestnut,  but  Cefn  had  assured  Je'en  that  the  young
apprentice  had had  more imagination  than the  simple name  implied.
Cefn rode a  big white gelding called Streak, for  the red-brown blaze
between its  eyes. And  Maks rode  a bay stallion  that didn't  have a
name - it was one of his tribe's messenger horses, not his.
    They  encountered  the  strange  part  of  the  forest  four  days
southwest of  Dargon, and  all three of  them immediately  noticed the
change as  they entered  it. Sound  seemed to be  swallowed up  by the
ubiquitous vines, and sunlight was filtered almost to nothing.
    Another  day,  and  they  found  the  trail  that  Maks  had  been
following,  and shortly  after  that, they  found  the clearing.  They
tethered  the   horses  there,   shouldered  hastily  made   packs  of
equipment, and pressed  on on foot, using long, sturdy  knives to make
their way  through the underbrush  and vines to where  Maks remembered
the tower to be.
    It was  difficult going,  and Maks commented  that the  vines were
even thicker  now that  they had  been before.  Cefn was  very silent,
and spent a lot of time examining the vines.
    That  first day  afoot finally  ended without  the three  reaching
the tower.  They debated  continuing on, but  finally decided  to camp
and wait for the return of the meager sunlight.
    Cefn set  wards around the little  space that they had  cleared of
vines  while  Je'en and  Maks  gathered  wood  and  built a  fire.  He
assured the  other two that  the wards would  keep out the  vines, and
any luminary  visitors, but  they remained a  little wary  of sleeping
in the midst of the strange forest.
    Cefn had  long since demonstrated  that he was an  excellent trail
cook, and he  again managed to produce a hearty  meal from what seemed
to  be very  unappetizing ingredients.  Je'en envied  him that  skill,
and she  was taking  lessons, but  she wasn't very  good just  yet. Of
course, Maks was also  able to make meager rations into  a feast as he
had demonstrated  once at  an earlier  camp, but  he praised  Cefn for
his skill,  and said  that he didn't  mind not having  to cook  to get
good food on the road, as he usually did.
    When the  meal was over, and  the dishes rinsed and  repacked, the
three of them sat  for a long time staring at the  fire. They were all
wrapped  up  in their  own  thoughts,  and  stalling before  going  to
sleep. Maks  began talking,  almost to himself,  still looking  at the
fire, a haunted, pained look on his face.
    Je'en noticed him  speaking and started listening.  He was telling
of  how he  had met  Syusahn. He  described their  time together  with
such  emotion  and  such  clarity  that  Je'en  was  both  moved,  and
conscious of the fact that Maks would have made a great Bard.
    Then, he  told of the  night he had  lost Syusahn. The  light, the
vines,  the tower.  He made  her  feel his  fear and  concern for  his
love, and  his helpless rage when  the door closed on  her and refused
to reopen. Je'en  noticed that Cefn was listening as  intently as she,
but  the expression  on his  face was  not one  of sympathy  for Maks'
loss, or admiration  for his skill with words, but  one of thought, as
if he  were trying to understand  just what had happened  and why. She
got the impression  that he had a  fairly good idea of  what was going
on, but she knew  that he wouldn't tell anyone until  he was sure. She
hoped that he would be sure before it was too late.
    Eventually,  when Maks  had been  silent  again for  a long  time,
Je'en decided that  she needed sleep if  she was going to  be any good
for anything  tomorrow. So  she decided to  trust Cefn's  magic wards,
said  goodnight  to  her  traveling   companions,  went  over  to  her
makeshift bed  of green leaves,  pine needles, and blankets,  and went
to sleep. The other two soon followed suit.
    After a  light breakfast next morning,  they packed up and  set on
their  way  again. Je'en  noticed  that  the  vines grew  thicker  and
thicker,  and were  tougher  to cut,  as they  moved  south. She  also
noticed a  strange feeling in the  air as they proceeded,  almost like
a presence  that was everywhere, but  not quite aware of  them. It was
very disconcerting.
    Around  noon, after  breaking  through what  was  an almost  solid
wall of  vines, the three  came to a clearing,  and saw the  tower. It
was an  impressive and disturbing  sight. It rose majestically  from a
solid matting of  vines that covered most of its  first floor, sloping
away from  it into the trees  of the perimeter of  the clearing almost
50 feet away  from the sides of  the tower. It was  a brilliant green,
and  it  had  five  turrets  rising  to  various  heights  around  its
circumference. The  narrow windows  that Je'en  could see  looked dark
and sinister.
    They  pushed  through waist-high  vines  around  the edge  of  the
clearing  until  they  saw  a  higher mound  of  vines  that  probably
indicated the  wall around the  path to  the door. After  much hacking
and  straining, they  managed to  push  through the  wall, and  indeed
found the entrance pathway.
    The presence  Je'en had  felt earlier was  much stronger  now, but
Maks commented  that it  felt different  now than it  had when  he was
here  before.  Less  aware,  less active.  Je'en  worried  that  their
damaging  the vines  would  alert the  presence,  making an  intuitive
connection between the two, but that didn't seem to be the case.
    They walked  up to the  door, and, while  Je'en and Maks  tried to
force  it,  Cefn  carefully   examined  the  glittering  tower  walls,
particularly where  the vines came into  contact with it. After  a few
moments, he  said, "Je'en, Maks, come  look at this." They  joined him
at  the edge  of the  door,  and saw  what  he indicated  - the  vines
seemed to  actually be growing from  the tower itself. They  could see
dozens of  tiny green crystal nodes  dotting the tower wall,  and from
each  node grew  four  to  six blue,  yellow,  and  green vines,  each
thickening swiftly from  it's root and twining into the  mass of vines
that walled  in the path. Having  made that discovery, Cefn  turned to
the  door, and  took a  little  red pyramid  from his  belt pouch.  He
touched a  flat side  to the  door just below  the ornately  cast iron
knob. It glowed briefly, and the door opened just a crack.
    Before entering,  the three armed  themselves. Maks drew  his boot
knife, and went  in with both knives at the  ready. Je'en sheathed her
vine-cutting knife,  and drew her sword.  Cefn fished for a  moment in
his  belt pouch,  and  finally came  up with  a  short, pale-blue  rod
that,  for all  its  shortness, could  not possibly  have  fit in  the
pouch. Je'en  looked at him a  little strangely, and then  entered the
tower, with Cefn hard on her heels.
    The interior wasn't  as dark as Je'en had assumed  it would be: it
was  dimly lit  by  a pellucid  greenish light  that  cast no  shadows
whatsoever.  Moving  cautiously,  the  three of  them  began  prowling
around  the  first floor.  The  oppressive  atmosphere was  even  more
intense inside, but still there was no feeling that they were noticed.
    The  first  floor  was  a   well  kept  common  living  area.  The
furniture was  in excellent  repair, and there  was no  dust anywhere.
The walls  were hung with  beautiful tapestries, and  Je'en recognized
the  style of  a  few of  them  as very  ancient,  and very  valuable.
Around the  wall were about  a dozen statues  of men in  various forms
of  war  gear,   from  what  looked  like  many   different  ages  and
countries. They  were made  of a  strange, flakey  stone that  none of
them had ever  seen before. There were candles in  wall sconces, and a
huge chandelier  in the center  of the main  room that looked  like it
burned oil  from a score  of prism-enclosed  wicks. But, there  was no
sign of use,  and there was something about the  way everything looked
that made it seem as if nothing had been used in a long time.
    They  climbed to  the second  story,  and then  the third,  before
finding more  than dusted  furniture and  statues. Cefn  was exploring
the  alcove entrance  to  this floor's  turret, and  so  saw the  body
first. It was dressed  in much the same manner that  Maks was, but the
body itself  was dessicated to  the point  of looking like  an ancient
mummy. The other  two noticed Cefn examining the body,  and joined him
in the  alcove. Maks said,  "That was Neika, one  of those that  I was
told had gone missing  in the forest. See, that is  his ring, and that
badge on  his sash shows that  he was horsemaster for  his tribe. But,
he vanished not more  than three weeks ago. How could  he have come to
look so...so long dead?"
    Cefn shook  his head, and  said, "I  imagine that would  depend on
just  how  he died."  Then  he  turned his  back  on  the corpse,  and
continued to explore.
    Je'en and Maks  spent a moment more with the  body, long enough to
be sure  that Neika  bore no  visible wounds.  Puzzled by  the content
and tone  of Cefn's  last comment,  Je'en led Maks  up into  the third
floor turret after the wizard.
    That  turret was  empty,  as had  been the  one  below. The  three
continued up,  to the  fourth floor,  and then  the fifth,  where they
found  two more  mummified bodies,  again  identified by  Maks as  the
gypsies that  had disappeared on the  trail. On the sixth  floor, they
found another,  and Cefn appeared  to come  to a conclusion.  He said,
"Come on, it must be at the top of this last turret."
