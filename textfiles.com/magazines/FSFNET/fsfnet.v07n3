                       Through the Veil: Atros 5
    Atros dreamed  for the first  time in many  weeks. It had  taken a
great  effort  of will  to  break  the  bonds  of the  nepenthe  still
tainting his  blood, but  Atros had succeeded.  Still, there  was much
more to  been done, much  more to  experience. Atros should  not relax
now that he had overcome the first, and possibly the easiest, barrier.
    In  spite of  this, for  several moments  Atros hesitated  to open
his eyes. He  needed more time to solidify his  resolve. Atros let his
attention turn  inward. He knew  that he was dreaming.  Something deep
in side him sensed  it, but he also knew that this  was a dream unlike
any other.  His mind was  clear, unclouded  by the fog  of uncertainty
or  forgetfulness. Not  only could  Atros remember  his identity  as a
rogue  scholar in  Dargon, but  Atros could  also recall  in detail  a
hundred  other  lives  that  he  had  led  in  previous  dreams.  This
terrified  him.  He  remembered  the   pain  and  loss,  but  he  also
experienced  a sense  of detachment  that helped  support him  against
the pull of  insanity. His mind was very clear,  his thoughts precise.
>From a  solely inward inspection, Atros  could be certain that  he had
arrived where  he had wanted to  go. It was very  difficult to believe
that this was only a dream.
    Atros slowly opened  his eyes. He lay on a  vast floor composed of
huge,  gray  stone  blocks.  Above  him was  a  high  vaulted  ceiling
sloping gradually  down to the floor  on two sides. The  stone ceiling
bore criss-crossing  arches whose  shadows gave  the chamber  an eerie
organic  feeling. There  was  a  distant light  in  one direction  and
darkness  in  the other.  Atros  raised  himself  to his  feet  before
noticing his  clothing. While he bore  the same body that  had settled
to sleep in Pravo's  house, he now wore a soft  white robe belted with
a thick  black ribbon. He felt  very healthy and strong.  There was no
trace of  the fatigue  or wounds  that he had  received in  the street
fight only hours before.
    Atros' course  seemed obvious. Though  he was suspicious  of being
led, he  set out in bare  feet across the coarse  stonework toward the
distant  light.  After  several   hundred  yards,  Atros  could  dimly
discern  a  figure standing  before  the  light source.  Impatient  to
finish this destined meeting, Atros quickened his pace.
    The figure  was that  of a  healthy old man.  His face  was ridden
with the wrinkles  of age but he  stood tall and straight.  He too was
dressed in purest white  with a belt of black. Atros  took a long look
at the man's  smiling countenance then glanced down  as he approached,
unwilling to face him.
    "You have found  what you have sought. Though you  don't know what
that is," the man spoke mirthfully. His voice was deep, fatherly.
    "I thought perhaps you were gods?" Atros suggested rather weakly.
    "No, Atros,  we are not gods.  We are something other  than that,"
He  pronounced  and then  lapsed  into  quiet contemplation  for  long
moments. "Do you  remember reading Fendle, Jung,  Carstoe, Van Keltii,
Reinhelm, and the others?"
    "...yes..." Atros replied in a hollow whisper.
    "We are  a fraction of  Siger's world-soul, a splinter  of Byron's
oversoul, an  isolate disembodied collective subconsciousness.  We are
a collective  entity which germinated  in minds  such as your  own but
has  grown  to surpass  such  boundaries,"  he  paused for  a  moment.
"Well, at  least partially. Your and  our mind overlap in  a region of
your subconscious,  though only  a small part  of ourself  is yourself
and  vice versa.  You  understand that  I use  the  pronoun 'we'  only
because  such  constructs  as  'I/we/you' are  very  awkward  in  your
language.  I am  an individual,  a  collection of  individuals, and  a
portion of your  own mind. I am  empowered to speak for  each of these
entities. You have many questions which I now will attempt to answer."
    "What  are you  called?"  Atros' mind  was  struggling with  these
ideas. He cast out this question to buy the time he needed to adjust.
    "We  could  ask  the  same  of you.  At  this  instant  you  could
rightfully  answer  to  half  a thousand  names,  which  you  remember
bearing during  some part of your  existence. Yet none of  those names
adequately  describes the  individual that  you are  now. We  are much
the same.  We have both  too many names and  no suitable name,  but if
you prefer,  you may call us  Morpheus as that might  best describe us
from your point of view." Morpheus' tone seemed almost too friendly.
    "What is this  place?" Atros asked. He had decided  that if he had
to meet his maker,  he did not wish to show weakness.  And yet, he was
still  confused.  Too much  seemed  to  be  happening too  quickly  to
follow. Perhaps,  he should have  waited until he was  better prepared
for all of this.
    "A creation based  on patterns deep within your own  mind. We have
gone  to  the  trouble  of  making everything  appear  as  closely  as
possible to  the way you inwardly  expected it to appear.  Even my own
appearance  is drawn  from your  own  imagination. We  chose to  craft
forms that  would be  meaningful to  you, literally  and symbolically.
We wished  to convey our  message with  the least amount  of confusion
or fright." Morpheus spoke without gestures.
    "Then  you can  eavesdrop on  my thoughts?"  Atros asked  suddenly
feeling vulnerable. He  sought to conceal his  fright by straightening
his shoulders,  raising his  head, and peering  deeply into  the black
eyes of  the man/enigma before him.  In the long verbal  pauses, Atros
could hear only the sound of his own breathing.
    "On that  portion of your  mind that is  part of us  already, yes.
With  the  rest, let  us  just  say  that we  can  do  a fair  job  of
anticipating your mind," Morpheus answered meeting Atros' glare.
    "What do you want of me?" Atros asked trying to sound defiant.
    "Very  simply, we  would  like you  to  join us.  To  allow us  to
experience  a  greater portion  of  your  mind  and  to allow  you  to
explore our being  as well. We wish  to live with you,  teach you, and
work  with you.  We have  need of  you and  we have  much to  offer in
return." Morpheus'  tone was even  and his voice smooth.  He portrayed
no emotion except fatherly concern and fatherly strength.
    "What do  you offer?" Atros was  tempted to sneer but  he realized
that it probably wouldn't be convincing.
    "Power,  knowledge, a  near  infinite number  of new  experiences,
and  an  end  to  your  loneliness,"  Morpheus  offered  smiling.  His
mention of loneliness struck Atros as a blow.
    Atros spoke  before he  was fully recovered  from this,  "You must
know  that what  you imply  frightens  me. The  alienness of  it...the
loss of individuality."
    "Individuality  will   still  be   possible  in  a   fuller,  more
integrated sense," Morpheus pronounced with a glistening polish.
    "Integrated individuality? How can that be possible?"
    "You  are  accustom  to  thinking of  life  and  consciousness  in
discrete  organic units.  The separation  between souls  is much  less
distinct. Yes,  your consciousness would  lose its boundaries  but the
center   of   your  consciousness,   its   seat,   can  preserve   its
individuality untarnished," Morpheus replied.
    "After all that  you have done to  me...the torment...the anguish,
do you seriously believe that I will join you willingly?"
    "Perhaps we know  you better than you know yourself.  In time, you
may see things differently. Until then, you need not commit yourself."
    "But why? Why have  you led me into cycles of  love and loss, fear
and hatred?" Atros' shield of cool intellect was cracking.
    "We have  tried to  explain that.  You remember  the dream  of the
forge?" Atros  confirmed this with  a nod.  Morpheus' voice took  on a
lecturing quality.  "Pain and suffering  are the only true  sources of
wisdom  and  strength.   Think  of  what  you  have   undergone  as  a
necessary, if painful, initiation."
    "An initiation I did not chose to undergo," Atros accused.
    "No one  truly chooses their  role in  life. We believe  free will
to be be even more of a fallacy than it obviously appears."
    "You believe? You do not know?" he said with a touch of mocking.
    "We are not  omniscient. Not nearly so. Proof of  the existence of
absence  of  free  will  is  far beyound  our  means.  We  accept  our
beliefs,   and   in   fact   all  our   knowledge,   as   provisional.
Interestingly,  though  we  doubt  the  existence  of  free  will,  we
recognize  the force  of  will as  the  source of  our  power. If  one
considers it, this  is not contradictory. But even if  it were, we are
not above a  bit of hypocrisy if  such a stance is  the only pragmatic
solution." Morpheus remained unresponsive to Atros' jibes.
    "How do  I know that everything  you've said isn't a  lie and your
proposals a trap?" Atros proposed.
    Morpheus'  expression suddenly  changed.  He burst  into a  heavy,
haunting  laughter  that echoed  through  the  hollow chamber.  Atros'
anger  grew  with this  obvious  mocking,  but  he kept  silent  until
Morpheus abated and spoke more, "Excellent! We have crafted you well."
    "You desired cynicism and distrust?" Atros asked angrily.
    "No, we  desired that you  be wise enough to  continually question
and  doubt, so  you can  be  an independent  thinker. We  do not  need
slaves.  We have  enough  of  those and  we  can  always fashion  more
Gilmans. We  need equals...partners."  Morpheus used his  eloquence in
an attempt to soothe Atros.
    "You could still be lying to me," replied Atros.
    "Yes,  Atros, we  would  delude  or misdirect  you  to obtain  own
desires and we  have done a bit of  that in your past, but  now we are
truthful.  Though we  realize that  what  we say  might frighten  you,
truthfulness now is best in the long run."
    "You can see the future?" Atros asked incredulous.
    "Only its possibilities. But that is usually enough."
    "You still have not given me sufficient reason to join you."
    "You  are already  with us.  You have  been so  since birth.  Your
subconscious   has  always   been   with  us.   Much   of  what   your
consciousness is  comes from your  association with us. We  are lodged
deeply in your being."
    "Then I can escape you only in death," Atros stated in a whisper.
    "No, Atros.  We will go  beyound that  barrier with you.  There is
no escape.  What happens between  us is destined  to be. It  cannot be
avoided." There was  just the slightest hint of sadness  and regret in
Morpheus' voice.
    "I  could keep  increasing my  dosage of  nepenthe. I  could evade
the dreams," Atros suggested clutching at faint hopes.
    "But  surely you  realize that  these are  more than  just dreams.
Already it  intrudes on your  waking life. How  long will you  be able
to withstand attacks like the one you experienced last night?"
    "What do  you know  of that!?!" Atros'  anger flared.  Only reason
prevented him from bodily attacking Morpheus.
    "Calm yourself,  Atros. Remember that  it was our  servant Gilman,
whom we sent to watch over your safety, that came to your rescue."
    "Yes, that is true," Atros admitted.
    "Many more  such attacks  are possible.  It seems  your connection
with us has been  discovered by an enemy of ours. It  seeks to hurt us
through harming you or perhaps converting you to their cause."
    "What is this enemy?"
    "It is a  collective consciousness much like  ourself but slightly
weaker and younger. We are rivals for the same resources."
    "And it has attacked me and Darla because of you?" Atros accused.
    "Our  enemy  is  a  bit  irrational and  blood  thirsty.  It  will
continue harassing until  you until it succeeds or grows  bored. It is
a threat to  our continued existence and growth as  well. We need your
help in combating it as surely as you need us."
    "How could I aid you in fighting such a thing?" Atros asked.
    "We  will teach  you how  to use  your undiscovered  talents. This
instruction comes with  no obligation. Do you consent to  let us teach
you to defend yourself against our mutual enemy?"
    Atros hesitated a  long while. But his mind kept  returning to the
a  single question:  How  else  could he  protect  Darla and  himself?
Finally,  on this  basis he  decided,  "Provided that  I may  withdraw
from these lessons at any time I choose."
    "Of course. Even  if you will not  join us now, we  have no desire
that you  be killed or enveloped  by our enemy. Go  now. Rest. Prepare
your mind,  your lessons will  begin in several days."  With Morpheus'
pronouncement, the scene  began to quickly fade. Atros  began the slow
return to wakefulness.

                                  Duty
    Morion caught  himself staring at  the moon again, and  turned his
attention back  to the roll  of parchment on  his desk. He  snorted in
disgust  when he  realized that  he had  read the  first paragraph  at
least four  times without  understanding it. He  hated having  to wade
through legal  documents. They  were written in  the most  obscure and
lengthy  terms  so that  lawyers  were  never done  out  of  a job  by
someone with the  ability to read. He trusted the  lawyer he employed,
but he  refused to sign anything  until he understood exactly  what he
was  signing. Elaref,  his lawyer,  had  explained over  and over  the
basic terminology,  but Morion was  a fighter,  not a scholar,  and it
took time  and practice to  master those knotted words.  Grimacing and
steeling himself for  the effort, he went back to  the thick parchment
with the intent  to get through it  this time. It was the  last one he
had to sign and seal.
    Half an  hour later, he was  startled out of a  reverie concerning
the signet  ring he wore  on his left forefinger  and how he  had come
to bear it  by a knock on  his chamber door. He glanced  at the scroll
and realized with  dismay that he had  only read to the  second of six
paragraphs.  Rolling it  up  to  do tomorrow,  he  said, "Come!",  and
turned his attention to the door.
    He had been  expecting his seneschal, Riachon, calling  him to his
late  and probably  cold supper.  The  water clock  in Morion's  study
worked   perfectly,  and   Riachon  hated   it  when   people  ignored
appointments, even  dinner ones. His  seneschal always made  sure that
Morion got dinner if  he didn't come down by himself.  But, he made no
guarantee as to its condition.
    The figure  that stood limned  in the  torchlight of the  hall was
not  the middle-aged  and somewhat  portly one  of Riachon.  The tall,
slim, young man  that stood there was wearing the  official tabbard of
the  Falcon Herald  of Baranur,  colored gold  and green  with a  blue
falcon displayed  in the  center. His  long black  hair was  held back
with a  silver circlet bearing  one small stone  in the center  of his
forehead. An  amethyst of that deep  and pure color was  very rare. It
identified him  beyond doubt as  Coridan the Falcon Herald.  The stone
had been a gift  of the Queen when Coridan was  given the Tabbard, the
Staff, and the Keys  to the Great Books of Arms  upon ascending to the
position  of Royal  Herald  of  Baranur. Coridan  was  not dressed  in
riding gear  and Morion wondered how  long the herald had  been in the
castle before knocking on his door.
    "Castle Pentamorlo  is honored  in receiving you,  Master Coridan.
Please,  enter and  have  a seat.  Shall  I have  some  wine or  other
refreshment brought for you?" asked Morion.
    "Thank  you, Baron.  Perhaps  a little  of  that wonderful  Huulon
wine, if  you kept any  for yourself. I must  thank you again  for the
wagonload you gave me - it is the best wine I have ever tasted."
    Morion stepped  over to  the dumbwaiter, wrote  his wishes  on the
slate  inside,  and  sent  it  down to  the  kitchens.  "Come,  Master
Coridan,  let  us sit  before  the  fireplace  and  be a  little  more
comfortable." The young  herald settled himself while  Morion poked up
the  fire  until  it  was  roaring. Little  bells  in  the  dumbwaiter
jingled, and  Morion retrieved  the tray  bearing two  crystal goblets
and a  cool bottle of the  golden wine of  the type that he  had given
to Coridan as an Elevation gift.
    After he  had poured the  wine and settled  into a chair  across a
small  table from  the herald,  Morion said,  "What brings  you to  my
school, Coridan?"
    Coridan sipped  his wine and smacked  his lips. "As good  as ever,
Baron. Ah, but my news. Well, it seems that the King needs your help."
    Morion's ice-grey eyes  narrowed, and his mouth  compressed into a
thin, hard line.  He had anticipated Coridan's words,  echoing as they
did  almost countless  other  pleas  from the  Crown  he had  received
month  after  month  for  years.  But, the  King  had  never  sent  so
important a  person as the Falcon  Herald to ask his  futile question.
"For what?"  Morion demanded. "He has  an army, and a  whole legion of
instructors.  I wouldn't  teach  his soldiers  anyway.  What could  he
possibly want that I would give him?"
    Coridan looked at  Morion, his aquamarine eyes  seemingly wide and
innocent. He said, "He needs your help, Baron. It IS your duty."
    Morion shouted,  "No it is  not!" and  slammed his goblet  down on
the table between  them hard enough to snap the  thin stem and shatter
the  base.  He  looked at  the  broken  goblet  in  his hand.  With  a
muttered, "Sreth!" between  clenched teeth, he hurled the  bell of the
goblet into the fire where it smashed loudly.
    He  stood and  whirled around  behind  his chair,  an angry  scowl
marring his  face. Less loudly,  but no  less angrily, he  said, "When
is Haralan going to  understand that I pay fealty to  no one. My lands
are my  own, not held  in fief for  the Crown. You  know as well  as I
that I  and my family received  special dispensation from King  Nun as
reward  for a  personal service  I  rendered him.  That parchment  was
sealed  in turn  by  Arenth, his  brother, when  Nun  died and  Arenth
received  the Crown,  and then  by Haralan,  Arenth's son  and present
King.   That  third   seal   made  the   dispensation  permanent   and
irrevocable.  My   lands  are  my   own  and  my  family's,   with  no
requirement  for fealty  to anyone.  The  taxes I  pay, I  pay out  of
courtesy. I owe the  King or Crown nothing. And no  one calls me Baron
-  I gave  back the  six-pearled  coronet to  Nun, to  Arenth, and  to
Haralan  when they  each tried  to give  me that  title, with  all the
strings that  go with it.  I will not  help!" His knuckles  were white
on the back of the chair by the time he finished.
    Coridan bore Morion's  outburst with the air of  one expecting it.
He patiently waited  while the older man ranted about  the severing of
his  feudal obligations  to Crown  and King,  granted and  affirmed by
the  past three  Kings. He  knew about  Morion's refusal  to bear  the
identifying coronet  of a Baron,  but a King's  award could not  be so
easily  denied. The  fighter  had refused  the  obligation of  further
fealty to  the Crown by  refusing the  circlet and title,  but Coridan
was  a herald,  and  titles  were important  to  heralds -  especially
acknowledging with respect one who bore a title, at least on paper.
    When Morion was  finally done, the herald said,  "I must apologize
for not  making myself clear,  my Lord. The  duty that the  King calls
upon is not  that of vassal to  liege, but a duty  that you, yourself,
have  taken on  - the  responsibility for  those you  have trained  in
this thriving school of yours.
    "Reports have  been coming  in for several  months now  of trouble
to  the  south. At  first,  the  news was  of  what  seemed to  be  an
unconnected series  of outlaw raids  on caravans and  other travelers.
But,  the attacks  were not  robbery.  In every  attack the  travelers
were killed  to the last draft  animal and all of  the posessions were
burned or broken and left behind.
    "Then,  three   months  ago  came   word  of  the   first  village
destroyed.  As with  the caravan  raids, everyone  in the  village was
killed, and  the buildings were  set afire. The villagers  didn't have
a chance.
    "The attacks  have been getting  more and more frequent,  from two
a month  to almost  one a week.  King Haralan has  had legions  of the
army in  the area, but  the outlaws attack  randomly and the  King has
had no success at all in even spotting them.
    "However, our  best seers  have located  the outlaws'  hideout. In
the valley where  the Zyaran river flows out of  the Skywall Mountains
there is a  vast lake that Zyaran  feeds and flows from.  On an island
in the lake's  center there is now a fortress  without window or door,
nor  is there  a bridge  or  causeway that  links land  to fort.  Even
knowing the  location of  the outlaws'  stronghold is  no help  to the
King  for the  island is  unassailable.  Also, the  leader controls  a
magic that  is able to transport  his men and himself  directly to the
scene of their  attack. The few surviving observers  have likened this
magic to a  giant floating mirror that the outlaws  ride into, but not
out the other side.
    "The  leader of  these  outlaws names  himself  BlueSword, and  we
have learned  that he  is a former  pupil of yours.  Two weeks  ago in
the  ruins of  a small  village  he had  just sacked,  the King's  men
found a  man, cruelly  mutilated but  still alive.  He bore  a message
branded into his  flesh. It was a challenge. BlueSword  wants to fight
you, Morion, and  he intends to kill you, and  then to destroy Baranur
little by little.  King Haralan asked me to deliver  this news to you,
in the  hopes that I would  at least get  to your ear before  your ire
got me  thrown out. It seems  that he did choose  the right messenger,
although just barely."
    Coridan's open  smile eased  the sheepish  tension in  Morion, and
the teacher  returned to  the comfortable  side of  the chair  and sat
down.  He  sat silently  thinking  for  a  time,  then said,  "I  must
apologize for my  outburst, Coridan. I was just fed  up with Haralan's
incessant petitioning  of my  talents to 'mold  his fighting  men into
an  unbeatable  force.'  I...ah,  souls   and  swords,  I  just  never
expected this of  Kyle. Something is strange here." He  was silent for
several moments  more, trying  to fit  his memories  of Kyle,  who had
been  nicknamed BlueSword  while learning  here, to  what he  had just
been  told. Finally,  he  remembered  his duties  as  host, and  said,
"Please accept  the hospitality  of my house,  Master Coridan.  If you
can stay  until lunch tomorrow, perhaps  we can talk further,  but now
I must think on  this. Thank you for bringing me the  news. If I don't
see  you tomorrow,  you can  assure the  King that  I will  respond to
BlueSword's challenge  to the  best of my  abilities." Both  men rose,
and shook  hands, and Morion walked  the herald back down  to the Main
Hall. Grabbing  a platter full  of dinner leftovers, Morion  then went
back to his study to think about Kyle, now known as BlueSword.
    Once  again  seated comfortably  in  the  chair before  the  fire,
Morion idly nibbled  at the food on the tray,  sipped from the leather
flagon of mead  he had brought up  with the tray, and  stared into the
fire remembering  Kyle. Young, mid-twenties,  of an age  with Coridan,
fair haired,  open-faced, very likeable  and pleasant. He had  come to
the school with  just enough money, mostly in  small denominations, to
cover the  entry fee. But, he  had exhibited plenty of  raw talent and
Morion  had accepted  him readily.  He had  taken to  training like  a
goat to a  mountain side, rapidly climbing the ladder  of ability that
Morion  privately used  to grade  his students.  In three  and a  half
years,  he had  learned  all  he wished  to,  and  had graduated  with
appropriate honors.  He had left  a little more  than a year  ago, and
now it  seemed that he  had turned into some  kind of monster  bent on
death and destruction. That just didn't sound like him.
    BlueSword. A  nickname given  to him by  his fellow  students, and
for good reason. He  had painted the blade of every  one of his wooden
and  rattan practice  swords a  deep,  almost purple  blue. He  didn't
tell anyone  why until he  passed the  test of beating  Morion himself
using a  large shield and  a long  sword against the  teacher's single
short  sword. At  the simple  ceremony after  dinner that  night, Kyle
had brought  out a magnificently  wrought sword,  said it had  been in
his family  for generations. It  had a  simple yet elegant  silver and
gold  hilt, with  gently curved  quillions and  a large  polished ball
for  a  pommel.  It  also  had a  beautifully  blued  blade;  a  deep,
metallic blue that  rivaled the twilight sky. From  then on, BlueSword
wasn't a joke any more - Kyle had earned it, and carried it proudly.
    It bothered  Morion that this  should fall  to him to  resolve. He
had no  worries about  beating Kyle BlueSword  on the  field. Morion's
skills had been  earned over long and hard years  of practice and use.
Kyle's months at  the school and the months after  could not have made
him a  match for  the former  soldier. Except for  the thing  that had
turned  Kyle into  a madman.  Morion almost  fell asleep  staring into
the fire  and wondering on that  point, his mind circling  the problem
endlessly.  Riachon  finally  came  up  and herded  him  off  to  bed,
clucking absently  about the leftovers  that Morion had wasted  by not
eating what he had taken to his room.
    After his morning  workout and several sparring  sessions with his
pupils,  Morion  sought out  Coridan  and  they  talked over  a  light
lunch. The  herald said,  "The note  BlueSword left  named a  time and
place for  the duel. 'MeredsDay of  LastSummer' is what it  said. What
might MeredsDay be, if you know?"
    "Kyle's people  have many gods and  they name each day  of a month
by one or  another of them. MeredsDay  is the 15th or 16th  day of the
month,  depending on  the month.  LastSummer  is next  month by  their
reconning. Not much time - just a little over two weeks. Where?"
    "The east end of  the lake that holds his island.  He wants you to
come  alone. Don't."  Coridan's face  was sincere,  and even  a little
apprehensive as he gave the teacher his advice.
    "I'll leave  tomorrow. Two  weeks leaves  little leeway  to travel
so far,  but Staarion is  a fine horse.  We'll make it,  and hopefully
with enough  time to  rest up a  little before the  battle. I will go,
and hope that his honor hasn't been lost along with his sanity."
    "Fare well,  Sir Morion. May all  of Kyle's gods smile  on you, as
well as all of Baranur."
    Morion  just smiled  as  he  went to  talk  to  his two  assistant
teachers,  to tell  them of  their impending  responsibilities. Morion
was a  man who believed  in himself and  little beyond that.  The gods
had little  or no  place in  the reality he  perceived. Still,  he was
glad the young herald  wished him well. He would need  all the luck he
could muster if there was more than Kyle behind the upcoming duel.

    Nine days  of perfect  riding weather ended  in a  thunderstorm so
fierce that  it forced Morion  off the  road. Huddling in  a makeshift
camp  under some  trees, using  Staarion  for the  little shelter  the
horse could provide,  he spent the balance of the  day, and all night,
soaking wet and miserable.
    The next  day, he tried  to ride on  through the still  hard rain.
But just before  noon another heavy thunderstorm forced  him into camp
again. Morion  began to worry  about having lost  two days so  far. He
fervently hoped that the morrow would be drier.
    It was, but not  by much. The rain still fell,  hard and fast, but
the  violence of  the thunderstorm  had passed.  It was  not traveling
weather, but  Morion had no  choice. The rain  would slow him  down to
less than half  his normal speed, and that wasn't  enough time to make
it to  the lake. Morion  mounted Staarion  and, pushing the  animal to
the limits  of safe movement, rode  off trough a grey-walled  world of
chill wetness.
    Around  mid-morning Morion  suddenly had  company in  his wet  and
short-horizoned world.  The strange horse  and rider loomed up  out of
the  hissing raindrops  to  his  left and  stopped  athwart the  road,
halting Morion's slow progress.
    The horse  was larger  and so captured  his attention  first. Once
it  did,  he   stopped  calling  it  a  horse.   There  was  something
distinctly goatish  about the  mount - the  cloven hooves,  the tufted
tail, the  ears, and  the little  growth of hair  under its  chin that
gave a name  to the way some  men wore their beards. It  was easily as
large as a  horse, with the glossy  fine hide of a horse  as well. And
then, Morion  saw the  flickering of a  white, horn-shaped  flame that
hovered over the beast's forehead. Unicorn.
    Immediatly, the  fighter's attention was  drawn to the  rider. She
sat tall in  her saddle, back stiff and straight.  Her face was turned
toward Morion,  appraising him as he  examined her. She had  long hair
that seemed in  the uncertain light to  be pale blue, bound  back by a
thin  copper  wire  around  her  head  that  bore  a  small,  dangling
ornament at  each temple. Her  face was long  and thin, much  like the
rest of  her, and  her eyes  were the strangest  color. Red,  not like
the washed-out pink of  an albino, but a deep, fiery  red, like a fine
ruby.  Her nose  was long,  her mouth  small and  almost lipless.  Her
long throat  was hidden  by a  thin, silklike  scarf that  matched the
rest of her clothing.  She rested her hands on the  high cantle of her
saddle; there  didn't seem to be  any halter or reins  on the unicorn.
Her  long, slim  legs came  out from  under her  skirts and  went into
soft high  leather boots,  which rested in  large stirrups.  A flowing
cape attached  to her tunic  by copper  buttons reached down  her back
and  across her  mount's  whithers. And,  most  amazingly, she  seemed
totally dry.
    She  opened her  mouth  to speak  and  strange, music-like  sounds
came out.  But, the  song of her  words did not  fit the  movements of
her  small mouth.  When  the song  reached his  ears,  words he  could
understand popped up in his mind.
    The words in  his head said, "The Dance of  Ahar'yKinel enters its
second mode. Thyerin's  webs have drawn you into your  proper place in
the  pattern of  the  Dance, which  will  end with  the  freeing of  a
spirit  too long  held captive,  and  the end  of an  evil that  could
unmake this world."
    With the  words came  an understanding of  their meaning,  so that
Morion 'knew'  that Thyerin the  Weaver was a  god from a  pantheon he
had never  heard of. Apparently, he  had been drawn into  some kind of
scheme by  this Thyerin, a  plan that the god  and this woman  named a
Dance.  As  the woman  spoke/sang,  the  magic  of her  words  enabled
Morion to  almost see the  pattern she mentioned  the way she  saw it,
like  a half-finished  piece of  cloth  on a  loom, with  part of  its
pattern  finished and  showing,  but  the rest  of  it  hidden in  the
strands that would go into its making.
    However  beautiful the  imagery, Morion  resented the  implication
that he was subject  to the whim of an idea some  people called a god.
Also,  he was  being  delayed  even further  in  his  mission by  this
woman, and he had  no idea why she had stopped him.  He said, "My good
Lady, while  I would at some  other time love to  discuss this fantasy
of yours,  I am  late for  an important  meeting and  have no  time to
waste  on mythical  gods  and the  many ways  stories  are told  about
their  intervention in  mortals' lives.  If you  would pardon  me?" He
put his  heels to Staarion  to ease his  mount forward, but  his horse
refused to budge.
    "Your  belief in  Thyerin does  not affect  his reality.  Everyone
believes in  something, even you,  Sir Morion.  The code of  honor you
serve is as  much a god to you  as Thyerin is to those  who follow him
under  that,  or any  of  his  many  other  names. Even  believing  in
nothing is believing in something.
    "I am  named Kimmentari,  and I  know of  your appointment.  It is
part  of the  Dance, the  meeting between  you and  Kyle BlueSword.  I
have come to  tell you three things. First, Kyle  and his raiders will
attack the village of  Belliern, which is just over a  day away if you
shift your  path to the  east from here.  Your King has  been informed
of this  by another agent  and has sent two  companies of the  Army to
meet you  there. If you  meet Kyle there,  and defeat him,  the King's
soldiers  will take  care of  the  rest of  his outlaws.  If you  wait
until the time  and place that he  has chosen, then there  is no place
in the pattern for your victory.
    "Still, wherever you  choose to meet BlueSword, beware.  He is not
the man you  knew. Do not take  for granted the skill  you believe him
to possess.  Also, you must  kill him. The path  that he has  taken he
cannot  be delivered  from except  in death.  Do not  let your  former
friendship blind you to what must be done.
    "And, lastly,  when he  is dead,  remove from  his left  wrist the
bracer he  wears and place  it upon your own  left wrist. For  a short
time  thereafter, you  will be  able to  enter his  citadel as  he did
through   a  dimensional   lens.  Once   within,  you   must  find   a
silver-bound  crystal circlet  that he  had  made for  himself. It  is
unfortunate  that he  never had  a  chance to  use  it, but  it has  a
further  purpose. When  you  have the  circlet, you  must  take it  to
Dargon and  deliver it unto one  of your former pupils,  the one named
Je'lanthra'en. She,  too, has  a part  in this  Dance and  the circlet
will be of immeasurable aid to her.
    "Once that is  accomplished, your part in the Dance  will be over,
and you  can go  back to your  ways of not  believing. From  here, the
choice is yours. If  you do not go to Belliern...that,  too, is in the
pattern,  and we  will have  to get  someone else  to play  your part.
Farewell, Lord Sir  Morion. I shall see you again.  Until then..." And
she rode swiftly back into the greyness and vanished.
    Morion  stared after  the strange  woman for  quite some  time. He
couldn't quite  believe the  matter-of-fact way  she had  dictated the
next couple  of days  of his  life to  him, giving  him the  option to
reject her  counsel but  expecting him  to follow  it. Long  after she
was gone, he still  sat and thought, already so wet  that he could sit
in the rain  for days and not  get wetter. Finally he  decided to heed
her  advice.  More  for  practical  reasons  than  anything  else.  He
suspected that  Kyle would  have something  devious planned  for their
proposed meeting  on the  shore of  his lake. Even  if he  didn't, and
Morion succeeded in  killing him, there would still be  his outlaws to
contend  with. If  Kyle  were  truly going  to  attack Belliern,  then
meeting him  there with the King's  men would be the  smartest move he
could make.
    He  urged Staarion  into motion  again, and  rode on  thoughtfully
through the driving rain.

    Morion propped  himself comfortably against the  lip of Belliern's
public well and  looked around. The village was deserted  and had been
since the  King's men had arrived  to tell them of  BlueSword's coming
attack. Not  a single  resident of  the village  had elected  to stay.
The  infamy of  BlueSword had  spread swiftly,  and no  one wanted  to
challenge it.
    The village  square, which  should have been  the busiest  spot in
Belliern, was  lifeless except for  Morion and a few  hidden sentries.
The shops  that faced the square  were closed and shuttered.  The four
main  spokelike streets  were empty,  as  were the  alleys that  poked
between  shops  around  the  perimeter  of the  square.  The  day  was
overcast, grey and  cool for the end of summer.  A gentle wind stirred
the  dust  on  the  ground  and  the  sparse  brown  and  green  grass
scattered  about the  square. There  were very  few natural  noises to
break the unnatural stillness of the village.
    The  two companies  of the  King's army  were hidden  in strategic
places  around the  village waiting  for the  attack that  would occur
sometime  that   day  according   to  Commander   Rian's  information.
Sentries  were posted  to carry  information on  Kyle's coming  to the
ready  soldiers.  The  waiting  was  the hardest  part  for  them,  of
course.  Even after  two  days of  good  sleep and  fair  food at  the
village's largest inn,  waiting in hiding for an  uncertain attack was
wearing on the nerves  and body. They were at the  mercy of Kyle whom,
if this day went right, they would never have to worry about again.
    Morion sighed,  and settled himself  a little more  comfortably on
the well's  wide edge.  He had  resigned himself  to this  combat over
the  days since  he  had  diverted to  Belliern.  He  had answered  or
pushed away  any hesitations and  questions in his mind  about whether
this was the  right thing to do.  As he drew his sword  and settled it
across his knees,  he thought about his reluctance to  kill. He picked
up the  whetstone and soft  cloth lying beside  him and began  to hone
the blade  that had been  his livelihood for  many years. He  had done
his share of killing,  both in the service of the King  and on his own
later when he  became a mercenary. And somewhere in  that time, he had
become tired  of killing. So  often there had  been no wrong  or right
in the  battles he had  fought, just a  desire for land,  property, or
blood, and  a sum  of money to  buy swords to  fulfil that  desire. It
had eventually  become more than he  was willing to deal  with, and he
had packed away  his blade forever. But, the inactivity  was almost as
bad as  the killing, so  he had opened  his school, trying  to instill
in his  students more  than just  the ability to  destroy. As  part of
his philosophy  of 'restrained  violence,' he tried  to teach  when it
was right  to fight. He  had finally  convinced himself that  this was
such a  time and  that he  wasn't engaging in  this duel  for himself.
Kyle   was  destroying   whole  communities   and  killing   innocent,
defenseless people. Someone  had to stop him, for  the innocents' sake
at least. Kyle  had issued the challenge, and Kyle  would have to face
the consequences.
    Polishing  and  sharpening  his  sword calmed  Morion.  His  world
narrowed  to that  blade and  the  coming fight.  The simple  activity
pushed moralizing  out of his  mind and got  him ready to  fight, made
his body  and mind  one. Soon,  he was again  the fighting  machine of
his sellsword days and ready to duel Kyle BlueSword.
    Shortly after noon,  Morion felt a tingle, faint  and subtle, move
like a  wave across the  square. He  looked up, putting  his polishing
materials down,  and turned his gaze  to the east-facing main  road of
Belliern. He saw  a thin grey line  draw itself from the  ground up to
ten feet  in the  air. It  broadened into  a thin,  pointed-ended oval
which   hovered   for   a   moment   and   then   twisted   strangely,
eye-wrenchingly,  like  a  lens  of glass  seen  first  edgewise  then
turned  broadside to  vision. It  twisted until  it was  a large  grey
circle that  filled the near  end of the street.  With a shiver  and a
ripple, it flashed a bright silver, mirrorlike but reflecting nothing.
    After another  ripple brushed across  the its surface,  Morion saw
a shape  begin to  bulge out  of the  lower portion  of it.  It looked
like  a man  walking  through a  sheet  hung  on a  line  to dry.  The
surface  of the  mirror  stretched around  the  advancing form,  then,
silently broke away  from it to reveal a man  dressed in fancy, fluted
blue plate armor  with a lightning bolt on the  breastplate that shone
like real  gold. He wore  no helm unlike his  men who were  armored in
ganbezons  of leather.  They were  popping  out of  the mirror  behind
their leader and forming into ragged ranks around him.
    Even  though the  leader's head  and face  were uncovered,  Morion
had some  difficulty identifying Kyle.  If not  for the sword  he held
naked in  his right hand, Morion  could not have been  certain at all.
Kyle's face  was darker, coarser,  with a scraggly beard  that altered
the planes of  his face. There was something subtly  twisted about the
face;  something that  made Morion  think that  perhaps Kyle  had been
driven insane.  And, the  man's eyes  glowed with  a pale  green light
plainly  visible in  the muted  daylight. Only  the sword  assured him
that  the leader  was Kyle  - it  was the  heirloom that  Kyle was  so
proud of.

    Kyle  BlueSword  stepped through  the  dimensional  lens into  his
latest  target, Belliern.  Kyle  immediatly noticed  that the  village
square was  deserted but for  one. He  recognized the black  armor and
the  stylised gryphon  on  the breastplate.  He  recognized the  black
helm  with the  silver decoration  around the  eye-slits that  the man
was lifting  from the edge of  the village's well and  settling on his
head. Lord Sir Morion of Pentamorlo, his former teacher.
    He laughed,  and said, "Ah, Teacher!  You want to duel  now? Fine,
just fine!  Men, you know your  jobs. Get to  it while I take  care of
this fool.  I'll join you in  a minute or  two. Hah hah!" He  waited a
moment to  watch his  outlaws slipping  away in  twos and  threes down
the  lanes of  the village,  destruction  and mayhem  on their  minds.
After setting  the lens  to vanish,  he walked to  the square  to meet
Morion. Kyle  was as confident of  victory as he sounded  even without
the little surprises he had set up for the pre-planned duel.

    Morion walked  calmly to  a position midway  between the  well and
the  now vanishing  mirror, ignoring  Kyle's bluster.  He watched  the
outlaws moving away  into the village. He hoped that  the sentries had
alerted  the soldiers.  However, that  was in  the hands  of Commander
Rian. He  had a duel to  fight. He located  a level patch of  dirt and
planted  his feet  firmly, shifting  them slightly  until he  felt the
feedback of solidity  that made him almost part of  the ground. It was
a  part  of his  favorite  and  best  technique,  the Rooted  Form,  a
fighting style that  made the fighter immobile, rooted  to the ground;
a rock  in the  face of his  opponents. Morion lifted  his blade  in a
loose two-handed guard and waited, ready for anything.
    Kyle strolled  toward Morion, sword  held loosely, point  down, in
one  hand.  But,  barely  ten  paces from  his  former  teacher,  Kyle
blurred into action  faster than an eye could track.  In an instant he
brought his sword  up into a guarded attack position  and began to run
at Morion, full speed from the first step.
    He moved much  faster than Morion thought possible. It  was all he
could do  to wrench  himself from  his rooted  stance, move  his sword
between himself and  Kyle's blade, and dodge as  Kyle barreled through
the  space where  Morion  had been  standing.  Morion whirled  around,
shuffled his  feet until he  found the  feedback of the  proper stance
and faced  Kyle again.  He was  more prepared this  time for  the rush
that  Kyle was  already mounting.  Part  of the  Rooted Form  involved
stopping and  engaging an  opponent to  keep him  from darting  in and
out  and  around  one.  With  a skill  that  almost  surprised  Morion
himself, he  leaned into  Kyle's attack, feeling  the strength  of his
stance pour up  his legs and into  his body. With a  darting sword and
a  braced body,  he let  Kyle crash  into him.  Morion watched  as the
speeding  man simply  bounced off  of the  front that  he put  up, the
inertia of Kyle's rush absorbed and syphoned off.
    Kyle  recovered with  the  same lightning  swiftness  that he  had
charged with,  and soon Morion was  encased in a web  of flashing blue
light  from the  multitude  of  blows that  rained  down  at him  from
Kyle's impossibly fast  arm. It took all of his  skill to keep himself
from  being  wounded.  Morion  had  done his  best  to  eliminate  any
prejudging  of this  contest  by  what he  knew  of  Kyle's skill  and
ability because  of what  the strange woman  Kimmentari had  said. Now
he had  to rethink  his moves  in terms of  this incredible  speed. He
gradually came  to realize that he  could not possibly defeat  Kyle if
he stayed  in one place.  He knew  that it was  just a matter  of time
until his reflexes  didn't respond fast enough to block  one of Kyle's
blows. The speed of BlueSword's attack left him no time to riposte.
    The  smile on  Kyle's face  told Morion  that the  outlaw had  him
right where  he wanted  him, almost  as if he  had expected  Morion to
use the  Rooted Form and  knew that it  was futile. Morion  decided to
use a change in tactics to surprise Kyle to perhaps gain an advantage.
    He  gradually eased  his  feet free,  surprised  by the  increased
difficulty he now  had blocking Kyle. He hid any  differences from his
opponent, making  it seem  that he  intended to  stay Rooted  until he
was killed.  He gathered his  resources into himself, storing  them up
until he  felt he could manage  a fast burst of  action, blocking with
more and more economy he hoped would seem to Kyle like weariness.
    Finally  ready, Morion  sped into  action. Judging  his moment  to
the  half-second, he  dodged  to the  left  under an  almost-patterned
blow. In  the slight hesitation Kyle  made when his blade  didn't meet
the expected  resistance, Morion  was able to  bring his  blade around
and under Kyle's defence.  He swung with all of the  force in his body
and connected  with the  armor under  Kyle's right  arm and  dented it
enough  to at  least bruise  if not  break some  ribs. Continuing  the
motion smoothly,  Morion slipped  out of  range and  took up  a light,
shifting  stance, ready  to move,  dodge,  run, or  whatever else  was
necessary to defeat BlueSword.
    Something was wrong.  Kyle wasn't charging after  Morion. He stood
and turned just  enough to look at his former  teacher. Morion noticed
that the  swarthy look and  the glowing eyes were  gone, as if  a mask
had lifted, leaving a very bewildered, weary and recognizable Kyle.
    Kyle took a  hesitant step toward Morion, and  said, "H-help m..."
The return of the  mask cut off his plea, and once  again Kyle was the
dark-skinned, evil-eyed man  who had walked through  the mirror. "Good
try,  teacher," he  said.  "First blood  to you.  I  didn't think  you
smart enough to  leave your stance even when it  was killing you. But,
you  still have  no  chance of  victory.  I shall  not  be caught  off
guard, and  I am better than  you! Diiiieeeeee!!" He charged  with the
same speed  as the  first time,  not even slightly  slower. It  was as
though the minutes of fighting hadn't tired Kyle in the least.
    Although feeling  the fatigue that  Kyle was not, Morion  was more
ready  this time  than before.  He spun  and swung  with Kyle's  rush,
moving with the  midnight-blue armored man so that he  didn't have the
time  to turn  and run  again before  Morion's sword  was there  to be
blocked. Kyle attacked  in a flurry of blows that  Morion blocked. Now
that  he wasn't  hemmed in  by his  useless stance,  Morion recognized
that  there was  more speed  than skill  in Kyle's  attack. There  was
also a fatal  tendency to attack in  a pattern. As he  and Kyle fought
back and  forth across the village  square, Morion grew more  and more
certain  that, given  half a  chance and  enough time  to discern  the
pattern in Kyle's attack, he could win.
    Neither  dueler noticed  when  the  fighting in  the  rest of  the
village  reached the  square. The  King's men  had reacted  swiftly to
the  advent  of the  outlaws,  ambushing  and slaughtering  the  small
groups as  they searched  the village  for something  to kill.  Of the
original two and  a half score only ten survived  the initial attacks.
With the  advantage of  more experience in  guerilla tactics  than the
soldiers, the outlaws,  though few in numbers, managed to  take a high
toll on the  King's men as they slipped through  the alleys and houses
of  the village.  Finally  the  outlaws were  driven  into the  square
itself by  the numbers of  King's men alone.  There, one by  one, they
fought and died, outnumbered but not surrendering.
    Morion  finally got  his chance.  He  backed Kyle  up against  the
well with  a flurry of  hacking blows that  seemed wild but  were not.
Using every  trick he knew to  keep Kyle from breaking  away from him,
he studied Kyle's pattern,  even going so far as to take  a hit or two
to judge the man's reaction. When he was sure, he made his final play.
    He  attacked,   and  Kyle   followed  up  as   predicted.  Another
half-dozen  blows, all  as planned.  One more,  two, three,  and -  as
Kyle's blade  came up from terce  in a backhand return,  Morion moved.
His blade  went down,  forcing BlueSword's  to slide  up and  out. His
blade came up  from the same place and angle  that his opponent's had.
It caught the man  in now-dusty blue just under the  lower edge of his
breastplate,  cutting deeply.  He  recovered the  blade quickly,  and,
while Kyle  was staggered with the  first blow, he swung  with all his
might, leaving  himself dangerously  open, and  struck home  deep into
Kyle's left side,  his blade piercing the armor and  sinking deep into
Kyle's chest.
    Kyle's face  twisted even more as  he grimaced in pain.  For a few
moments,  there  was  nothing  left of  Kyle's  features,  but  rather
something out  of a nightmare.  Fangs, horns, pointed  ears, excessive
hair, no eyes  but rather twin orbs of flickering  green light nestled
under its brows;  the green light that had shone  through Kyle's eyes.
In  a voice  that was  deep  and gravelly,  and very  loud, the  thing
said, "You have won,  mortal. But, I never forget. You  will not be so
lucky next  time. My time  is limited on this  plane now, but  I shall
have  my  revenge.  Beware,  Sir   Morion.  Beware!"  And,  the  alien
features faded leaving the now pale but familiar features of Kyle.
    Kyle's body  sagged, knees buckling, sword  falling from nerveless
fingers.  Morion  released  his  own blade,  still  wedged  in  Kyle's
chest,  and  the body  dropped  lower  until  he was  sitting  propped
against  the rim  of the  well. Morion  dropped into  a crouch  beside
Kyle, bewildered  by what had driven  Kyle to this pass,  and saddened
by  his friend  and pupil's  imminent  death. He  briefly wondered  if
Kyle could  be saved, but  from the amount  of blood that  was pooling
on the  ground below him from  the two wounds he  had received, Morion
knew that Kyle was as good as dead.
    Kyle's  eyes fluttered  open, and  their grey-brown  irises locked
on Morion.  Weakly, he  said, "M-Morion.  Th-thank you.  Really, thank
you.  Y-you have  released  me. Th-thank  y-y-y..."  He slumped  down,
eyes shutting  again, not  yet dead  but not  strong enough  to speak.
Morion knelt beside  him, wondering whether or not to  help his friend
to a swifter end.
    Then, the woman  with the pale blue hair and  ruby eyes was beside
him.  Kimmentari touched  Kyle's forehead  lightly, and  he seemed  to
receive a  jolt of energy  from her fingers.  As his eyes  opened, she
said in her music-voice, "Kyle, explain."
    "E-ex-x-plain?" quavered Kyle.
    Kimmentari's  fingers  pressed more  firmly  on  Kyle's brow,  and
Morion thought  he saw their tips  glow faintly blue for  a moment. In
response, Kyle's  eyes regained some  of their normal glitter,  and he
drew himself  up a little, ignoring  the shaft of steel  in his chest.
The strange  woman said  again, "Explain,  Kyle. Discharge  your duty,
and then go to a peaceful rest. Tell Sir Morion your tale."
    "My  tale." Kyle  looked almost  healthy,  the color  back in  his
face. No more  blood dripped from beneath his  breastplate, but Morion
wasn't sure  if this  was because  his wounds  had been  staunched, or
because he had no more blood in him. "My tale," Kyle repeated.
    "I came to Pentamorlo School not..."

    I came to  Pentamorlo School not knowing exactly what  I was going
to  do with  the training  I might  receive. My  father had  died four
years before,  and my  mother remarried  into a  family I  didn't care
much for.  I dearly wanted  to be  able to use  the sword that  was my
only heritage,  so I sold everything  I could and went  to study under
Sir Morion.
    One day, while  I was visiting Tench, about a  year after I joined
the school,  I met a man  named Mygrul. I  liked him the first  time I
saw him.  There was  a kind  of energy, a  happiness in  everything he
did that drew  me to him. We talked, bought  each other drinks, talked
and drank  more, and decided that  we were buddies and  planned to see
each  other  again.  He  was  a mercenary  who  mostly  hired  out  as
travelers' guard, so he knew when he would be in town again.
    There was  much in  Mygrul that made  me want to  be like  him. He
was good with  the sword, learned mostly  by a five year  stint in the
King's service.  He had managed to  keep his sense of  humor by taking
easy  but  lucrative   jobs,  ones  that  didn't  involve   a  lot  of
unnecessary  killing. When  we had  gotten to  know each  other better
and had become friends,  he offered to team up with me  when I got out
of  school. His  reputation was  such that  he had  the pick  of guard
positions, and with me  as part of the team, he  could get even better
pay for both of  us. I readily agreed. It was  perfect, exactly what I
was hoping for.
    When I  graduated, I  went to Tench  to wait for  him. A  few days
later, the caravan  he was escorting arrived. With a  few words to the
master of  the caravan,  I was  hired on  the spot,  and Mygrul  and I
began our partnership.
    That first  caravan was uneventful,  but during the second  one we
hired out with,  the train was attacked twice. Mygrul  and I, with the
help  of  the  sling-armed  drivers,  drove  off  nearly  a  score  of
half-organized raiders.  When we  reached our destination,  Mygrul and
I  got drunk  in celebration  of our  victory. He  made some  comments
about us  being a perfect team.  That got me thinking.  Still a little
tipsy,  I suggested  we swear  ourselves blood-brothers,  knife-kin by
the custom  of my people.  He agreed,  and we swore  the never-parting
oath and sealed it  with blood. Then, we went back  to the taproom and
got drunk again.
    My life was  perfect after that. I had a  brother, something I had
always  wished for.  I had  a job  that I  loved, a  purpose in  life.
There  wasn't  anything I  lacked,  not  even  women  - our  gold  and
reputations  gave us  free run  of the  red-lantern district  in every
city we visited. Until four months ago.
    Mygrul  and  I  had  just  escorted  a  caravan  from  Baranur  to
Easryun. As soon as  we arrived, we had offers for  a return trip from
a dozen merchants.  But we wanted to  rest, so we rented  rooms in the
best  inn in  the city,  paying a  week in  advance, and  went out  to
explore the city.
    We  were walking  down  one of  the streets  that  opened off  the
upper marketplace. Here  the more prosperous merchants  had shops that
had stood  almost since the walls  of the city were  built. We stopped
by  a trinket  shop and  were  looking at  the wealth  in the  window,
arguing  about whether  the  jewelry was  real or  not,  when we  were
challenged by  a quartet of young  toughs with more steel  than sense,
and more ale  in them than both.  They were well dressed,  not part of
the  underside of  the city  but probably  merchants' or  nobles' sons
out looking for trouble.
    They taunted  us, trying to goad  us into a fight.  Mygrul refused
to  even draw  steel,  and kept  me  from drawing,  too.  He tried  to
reason with  them, and finally even  offered them gold to  leave. They
were  intent on  their evening's  fun.  They edged  closer and  closer
until one,  probably the leader,  lunged forward almost  awkwardly and
skewered Mygrul low in the chest.
    I cleared  my blade a second  later, and attacked. I  didn't reach
Mygrul's killer  because the other  three were crowding me.  With more
fury than  skill, I  disarmed one,  knocked another  out of  line, and
disabled  the last  by nearly  cutting his  sword arm  off. When  they
realized  that  they  were  up   against  someone  more  skilled  than
themselves, they backed  away cautiously, and when I  didn't keep pace
with them they turned and ran.
    I went  to Mygrul, who  was coughing weakly, blood  trickling from
the  corner of  his mouth.  I tried  to help,  but the  wound was  too
deep. I thought of  a healer, but I had never been  in Easryun and had
no idea where I  might find one. As I was ready to  go for help in the
market, Mygrul said,  "Ah, what a fool. Never trust  bared steel. What
a way to d...." And he was dead.
    Rage burned  through me, rage  and anger at those  hotheaded fools
that had killed  my best friend and brother, a  lesser anger at Mygrul
for letting  them kill him,  for not  wanting to fight.  Vengeance was
what I needed,  what I owed to Mygrul.  It was my duty, what  I had to
do.  The oath  we  had sworn  saw  to  that, as  well  as the  nagging
thought that I should have protected him, even from his own folly.
    A glow caught  my eye as I  thought those things. I  looked up and
saw that  one of the  displays in the  window was glowing.  A polished
quartz  egg sitting  on a  blackwood stand  was giving  off a  bright,
pearly  light. As  I looked  at it,  I felt  a pulling  in my  head, a
feeling that if  I touched the egg, if  I took it, I would  be able to
get  my revenge.  The  feeling  pulled at  me,  feeding  the rage  and
hatred  inside of  me,  showing me  images of  the  dead and  tortured
bodies of  those Shuul-damned kids.  It urged  me to break  the window
and  take the  egg. I  tried to  resist, but  not for  very long.  The
images, the  promises were too good  to let go. I  stood and shattered
the window with the hilt of my sword. I reached in and took the egg.
    I  stared into  the depths  of  the egg  as a  voice said,  "Pact.
Freedom for  vengeance. Accept?" I didn't  even need to say  yes. When
it  voiced the  question,  it  gleaned the  answer  from my  immediate
reaction, which  was acceptance. With  a flare of light  that startled
me into  dropping the  egg, the  creator of the  voice flowed  into my
arm, and  then into  my entire  body. I watched  distantly as  the egg
shattered as if it  was made of shell and not stone.  When it did, the
thing in me  laughed. It told me  that my last hope had  been that egg
and that now it would live in me forever.
    That in me which  was myself was pushed into a  small corner of my
mind, able to see  what the invader did with my body  but unable to do
anything  about it.  I  watched  while the  murderers  of Mygrul  were
hunted  down and  killed. I  watched  while the  invader searched  out
magic  that was  hidden in  secret vaults.  I watched  as the  outlaws
were gathered and  as a citadel was  built on an island  in the center
of a lake. And  I watched as the invader murdered  and destroyed in my
name and  finally challenged you;  and, at  the last, fought  and lost
to you, Morion. Thank you again, and farewell.

    Kyle sighed  peacefully and died  without pain, his body  and soul
at rest.  Morion turned to  the blue haired  woman who was  sitting on
her knees a  little back from the  pair. As his eyes fell  on her, she
said, "You  needed to  know. As  a lesson.  Do not  let your  honor or
your sworn  word overwhelm your  sense of right.  I know that  you try
not to,  but I know that  your honor is your  life to you. Do  not let
it be your death.
    "One  more meeting  is  given  to us  by  Thyerin  in this  Dance.
Beyond  that I  cannot  see, but  I could  wish  for further  contact.
Beware the citadel  of BlueSword, Sir Morion. All is  not as it seems.
Remember your  friend's story and go  warily. The circlet must  get to
Je'lanthra'en  by  DorthsDay   in  Harvest  to  be  of   use  to  her.
Farewell."  She lifted  Kyle's  sword  gingerly by  the  hilt, took  a
step, and vanished.
    Morion stared  after the woman  wondering at her words  yet again.
In  his own  terms, DorthsDay  was the  last day  of Ober  and over  a
month away. More than  enough time to get to the  citadel, and then to
Dargon. He looked  around the square and saw that  the battle with the
outlaws was over.  The King's men gathered in the  square to report to
their  captains on  their individual  fights. No  one was  looking his
way, probably, he thought, part of Kimmentari's work.
    He looked down  at Kyle appearing asleep rather  than dead. Kyle's
tale had  been strange, and he  wondered briefly if all  of this, from
Kyle coming  to his school to  this moment, had been  arranged so that
a  crystal circlet  could be  given to  another former  pupil of  his.
Briefly, his  temper flared at  the thought of callous  so-called gods
meddling deviously  and catastrophically  in mortals' lives.  But that
anger caused him  to abandon the thought as useless  and dangerous. He
would never know,  nor truly want to, just how  much immortals dabbled
in his life and those around him.
    Morion took  hold of  Kyle's arm  and saw  the bracer  there. With
some difficulty he  unlatched it, and slid it off.  It was plain steel
except  for a  little sigil  near  the cuff  that looked  like a  grey
lens. He  closed it  about his  own left wrist  and wondered  how Kyle
had used  it to control the  mirror. However, just thinking  that made
the little sigil light  up, and he watched as the  mirror opened up in
the street as it had before.
    Now, the soldiers  noticed him, the dead BlueSword  and the travel
mirror. Commander  Rian was  striding over to  him, but  Morion didn't
feel like talking to  the man. With the last of his  tasks in mind, he
walked over to the mirror and stepped in.
    It was strange  walking inside the mirror,  like traveling through
a  mountain pass  blanketed  in  heavy fog.  He  took  two steps  that
seemed to stretch  for days, and then  he was out of  the greyness and
standing in a courtyard.
    He  looked around  and saw  the mirror  vanishing. The  courtyard,
castle  on one  side,  protective  wall on  the  other, was  deserted.
Cautiously, Morion  climbed the set of  stairs that let to  the top of
the wall and  he saw, peeking between two merlins,  the vast lake that
protected  the citadel  of  BlueSword far  more  effectively than  the
wall he stood upon.
    As Morion  cautiously explored  the castle  and out  buildings, he
found  the whole  complex  was  as deserted  as  the front  courtyard.
There  were signs  of  occupancy  - the  outlaws  were  not very  neat
housekeepers - but they  left no one behind when they  went on a raid.
Morion  wondered  briefly whether  there  were  servants chained  away
somewhere, but he found none.
    When Morion  was sure that he  was alone in the  citadel, he began
searching for  the circlet. Remembering that  Kimmentari had mentioned
a  time limit  of  sorts on  his  use  of the  mirror  at their  first
meeting, he  decided to be  as methodical  as possible in  his search,
to be  sure that he looked  everywhere in as little  time as possible.
He went  through the  cellars, where  there was  much treasure  but no
circlet. He  pried into  every nook  and cranny  from the  first floor
up,  searching  for secret  panels  and  hidden rooms,  anywhere  that
valuable  items  might  be  hidden.  He  looked  behind  curtains  and
arrases,  under furniture  and around  shelves, even  under the  rugs.
Finally,  on the  top floor,  in what  had to  have been  Kyle's room,
Morion  found  a  panel  behind  the bed's  headboard.  In  the  small
opening  it  revealed was  the  circlet,  a  thing of  simple  beauty,
resting  on deep  blue velvet.  Also in  the cubbyhole  was a  smaller
square of black velvet, on which rested a small, reddish stone.
    Morion  reverently  lifted  the  circlet  and  examined  the  pure
craftsmanship in  it. He lifted  the blue  velvet out and  wrapped the
circlet in  it, then  set it  aside for  a moment.  He picked  the red
stone up off of  its rest and held it cupped in his  palm. In the same
instant that  he realized  it was egg-shaped,  he felt  needles spring
into his  palm. The  pricks weren't  very painful  at first,  but fire
began to  course through  him from  each needle  tip, pain  that raced
faster and  faster throughout his  whole body.  He tried to  shake the
red egg  from his palm, but  it seemed to  be holding on as  it pumped
poison into him.
    Morion  fell on  the  bed,  body rigid  with  escalating pain.  He
looked at  the stone and could  see the thing that  had possessed Kyle
standing  in a  cloudy, grey  place. The  being said,  "Sir Morion.  I
said I'd get my  revenge. You are dying, and with  you dies the thread
that circlet would  have woven. My masters will be  pleased with me, I
think.  Die  slowly  and  in  much  pain,  Sir  Morion."  The  being's
laughter faded  with its body  into the greyness. A  convulsive twitch
finally loosened  the little  egg from  his palm,  and it  rolled onto
the floor.  The last thing  he saw as  blackness welled up  behind his
eyes  was the  blue-haired woman  Kimmentari coming  through the  door
and stepping  casually on  the egg,  a look of  dismay and  concern on
her  face. She  said something  in  her music-voice,  but he  couldn't
hear her through his pain. And then he knew no more.
