    Well, things  have been mighty  hectic. I have just  returned from
a visit  to New  York City  over the  Thanksgiving holiday,  which was
very entertaining. However,  the big news is that FSFnet  is no longer
being sent directly  to you, but is being distributed  by the LISTSERV
distributed  server network.  It certainly  makes my  job considerably
easier, and  hopefully no one will  wind up with format  problems. But
that's all icing on the cake.
    We've  got several  interesting tidbits  in this  issue, including
the conclusion  of John White's  excellent story, The Dream.  Also you
will  find installments  of Joel  Slatis' Ceda  tale and  Rich Jervis'
Spirit  of the  Wood stories,  as well  as an  interesting story  from
Carlo Samson.  I am quite  impressed with  this issue, and  There will
be at  least one  more issue  out before  Christmas, and  possibly two
before  the  new year.  Looking  forward,  we have  another  excellent
story  from John  White,  which I  am  sure you  will  enjoy, and  the
continuation of Merlin's Atros epic. Enjoy, and best wishes!

                          Cydric and the Sage
                         I. Arrival: The Tavern
    It was late  afternoon when Cydric Araesto arrived  in the coastal
town of  Dargon. Hot and  tired from his  journey up from  the capital
of Baranur,  he rode through  the main street  of the town,  seeking a
place to rest. His  eyes fixed on a large building  near the middle of
the street; a sign above the door proclaimed:

                              BELISANDRA'S
in bold  red letters.  Below the  name was a painting of a young buxom
wench raising a large tankard of  brew. Cydric dismounted in  front of
the building, put his horse in the adjacent stables, and went inside.
    The  common room  of  the tavern  was large  and  brightly lit  by
lanterns that hung  from the rafters. The smells  of fresh-brewed ale,
Comarian tobacco,  and wood smoke reached  Cydric as he sat  down in a
corner  table and  mopped his  brow  with the  edge of  his cloak.  He
called  out to  a passing  serving  girl and  ordered a  cold pint  of
Lederian Special Brew.
    As the  girl left to  fill his order,  he leaned back  against the
wall  and  sighed wearily.  "I  am  finally  here," he  thought.  "But
should I even *be*  here? Does my future lie in Dargon,  or was it all
a  fever dream?"  He shook  his  head ruefully.  "It is  too late  for
regrets. I made my choice, and I can never go back."
    He  turned his  attention outward  to  the tavern.  The place  was
nowhere near  capacity, he noted. To  his right he saw  a young couple
holding hands and  conversing quietly. At a table in  front of the bar
a group of  richly dressed middle-aged men talked and  drank. Near the
entrance, a  hooded figure  in blue  robes sat hunched  over a  mug of
brew. A  thin, bearded  man smoked  a small  pipe in  the glow  of the
fireplace.  And at  a table  in  the center  of  the room,  a pair  of
leather-clad women arm-wrestled.
    The  serving-girl  returned and  placed  a  large tankard  on  the
table in front  of him. She smiled  at him as she turned  and made her
way  back to  the bar,  where  a stout  woman of  about forty  summers
watched the arm-wrestling  women with a look of  mild interest. Cydric
took a  long pull of the  cold brew and  made a sound of  approval. He
settled back, letting the tiredness bleed from his bones.
    Then,  without   warning,  the   strange  vision  that   had  been
recurring  in  his  mind  for  months once  again  intruded  upon  his
thoughts.  He  tried  to  purge  it from  his  mind,  but  the  vision
persisted. He  gave up the  effort, having  learned early on  that the
only thing he could do was to let it run its course.

                        II. Reverie: The Vision
    He was  sitting on  a large  boulder that  lay half-buried  on the
shore  of a  vast golden  sea. The  sky above  him was  a deep  cobalt
blue. Far  in the  distance, on  the horizon,  an object  sparkled and
glittered. He  hopped off the  boulder and walked  to the edge  of the
sea, straining to see  what it was. Then he knelt  down and scooped up
a handful of the  golden water. He raised it to  his mouth, but before
he drank it he  cast his eyes toward the object  on the horizon again.
He sighed,  and his  breath turned  the golden liquid  in his  hand to
plain colorless water.
    The water  slipped through  his fingers, and  where it  wetted the
sand a  small lump of a  transparent substance appeared. He  picked it
up, and  the lump  grew into  the shape of  a life-sized  human skull.
The skull floated  out of his palm  and came to hover in  front of the
boulder. Beams  of white light lanced  out of the skull's  eye sockets
and  struck the  smooth  stone,  sending up  a  cloud  of dust.  After
several moments, the  skull ceased its activity and set  down atop the
boulder. Cydric  brushed away the rock  dust and saw that  the skull's
eye-beams had carved  into the stone an outline of  the continent that
contained the  Kingdom of Baranur.  A small "x"  marked a spot  on the
western  coast of  the continent.  Below  the outline  were the  words
"Corambis the Sage".
    As  soon as  Cydric read  the  words, the  transparent skull  rose
into  the air  and, with  a  clack of  its  jaws, sped  away over  the
golden sea toward the glittering object on the horizon.

                        III. The Tavern: Company
    The vision  faded. Cydric looked  up as the serving  girl returned
and asked him if  he wanted another drink. "No, that  will be all, for
the moment." The girl turned to leave. "Wait a moment," he called.
    "Yes, milord?"
    "Do you know of a person called 'Corambis the Sage' ?"
    The girl  looked at him  oddly. "Yes,  everyone knows of  him. Are
you just arrived?"
    "Yes, I am. Do you know where he lives?"
    The  girl cast  a glance  over her  shoulder. "A  moment, milord."
Cydric watched as  the serving girl went over  and whispered something
to the blue-robed patron. The person nodded and stood up.
    Cydric's hand  instinctively moved to the  Zanzillian sundagger he
wore on his  right hip as the blue-clad figure  approached and stopped
in  front of  his  table. The  figure  removed its  hood  to reveal  a
feminine face framed by a mane of flame-red hair.
    "Thuna  tells me  you are  looking for  the Sage,"  she said  in a
conversational tone.
    "Do you know where I can find him?"
    "Better than that; I can take you to him. May I sit?"
    Cydric nodded, and the woman seated herself.
    "So," Cydric said,  "how much will it  cost me for you  to take me
to him?"
    "Merely  a  moment of  your  time,"  the woman  replied,  smiling.
Cydric found  himself smiling  back. She couldn't  be very  much older
than his  own twenty summers,  he decided.  He paused a  moment before
replying to study  the way the lantern-light reflected  from her clear
green eyes.
    "That sounds reasonable," he said.
    "My  name  is  Holleena,"  the woman  said,  extending  her  hand.
Cydric took  it and pressed  it against  his cheek in  the traditional
courtly manner. He told her his name.
    "So  tell  me, Cydric  Araesto,  what  brings  you to  our  humble
town?" she asked.
    A piece of  the vision flashed through Cydric's  mind. "My horse,"
he replied.
    Holleena laughed. "I see. Do you wish to visit the Sage now?"
    Cydric felt  his stomach  rumble. "Not  just yet.  I seem  to have
forgotten about supper. Would you care to join me?"
    "I  would,  indeed," Holleena  said.  Cydric  raised his  hand  to
signal the serving girl, but Holleena stopped him.
    "Let's not eat here," she said.
    "Why not?"
    "Belisandra  is a  good cook,  but as  anyone in  Dargon can  tell
you,   you  haven't   eaten  until   you've  had   a  bowl   of  Simon
Salamagundi's famous stew."
    "Fine,"  Cydric said.  "Let's go."  He  tossed a  couple of  coins
onto  the  table  as  they  rose  to leave.  He  offered  his  arm  to
Holleena, and together they left Belisandra's tavern.

                    Ceda the Executioner: Chapter 3
    Ceda  reclined on  his  bed  at the  inn  that  he had  previously
stayed at on his  last visit to Pheeng'Am. The guards  at the gate had
(for  a small  fee) told  him  that the  demon had  finally found  the
crown and had left the city without a trace.
    "Then it  is over," he he  thought to himself. "The  demon has the
crown and  has doubtlessly returned  to the Overworld, or  wherever it
came  from; And  I  need not  travel  to the  caves  of Arnmere."  His
tiredness took him and he fell into a deep slumber.

    Tarnigen had  had a  long trip  to the  old continent  of Cergaan,
where it  was rumored  that a  mysterious demon  had taken  the crown.
Why it  had gone there  was a mystery  indeed, but Tarnigen  could not
pass up  an opportunity of such  a fortune as Grobst's  Crown. A small
fishing vessel from  Dhernis had dropped him off on  the shore off the
Largely unexplored continent  off Cargaan a few hours  before, and now
he got  organized before setting out  to find the Demon.  This was the
ultimate test  for him; A man  was what he  wanted to be, a  real man,
and this (in his eyes) was a worthy test for it.
    Tarnigen  laid down  and  looked at  the night  sky  that hung  so
still  above his  head. He  wondered if  he would  ever see  it again.
Yes.  He would.  He had,  for a  moment, surrendered  his thoughts  to
fear, but this  would not ever happen again, he  reassured himself. He
was  determined  to get  the  Crown,  and he  would,  or,  he said  to
himself 'I am not worthy of the Throne of Caffthorn.
    The cold  features of  Tarnigens face  could just  be made  out by
the  pale  light that  came  from  the fire  he  had  built. His  long
crooked nose was  perhaps the the most noticeable thing  about him. It
was, to  say the least,  enormously out of  proportion to the  rest of
his face  protruding down  over the  pale thin lips  of his  mouth. He
had  narrow blue  eyes  and long  blond  hair that  hung  down to  the
center of his  back. Nothing else was really noticeable  about him. He
had a large body and was very strong as were most nobles of Caffthorn.
    The  sun  had  set  and   Tarnigen  was  tired;  His  eyes  pulled
themselves closed and at once he was asleep.
    The  sun was  almost directly  over head  when he  awoke. Now  not
only the dim outline  of the land that he now  stood upon was visible.
It was  richly colored by  many grey an  yellow flowers that  grew all
along the  shore line  and the  trees at  the edge  of a  large forest
that grew about  two hundred yards inland rose higher  than any he had
ever  seen before.  No  roads crossed  through the  aria,  only a  few
animals tracks could  be seen on the bank. This  was a peaceful place.
Tarniger  was  amazed  at  the  utter  tranquility  of  the  area.  He
gathered his  things and  started walking towards  the shelter  of the
trees while he made  his way west along the shore  to the Ruined Tower
of Threemis Where the Demon almost certainly was.
    Once in the  forest, he climbed one of the  taller trees to survey
The area. It  was a clear day  and he could just make  out the outline
of a tall shape rising above the trees 20 miles up the coast.
    It  looked lonely  and  out  of place,  a  gross  sight among  the
plentiful  vegetation   of  the  southern  continent;   like  a  knife
stemming out of a  mans back, and the man unable  to remove it, slowly
dying. He  wished It wasn't there.  He wished he wasn't  there, but it
wouldn't help now, he  had to prove himself a man  and could not leave
without throwing away  his family honor and pride, not  to mention the
throne.  However, the  thought  that  man had  not  yet disturbed  the
solemn  beauty of  the  continent consoled  him, and  were  he not  to
return to  Caffthorn, It  would surely  discourage people  from coming
to this 'New world', and destroying its solitude and innocence.
    But he  had to return,  there was no doubt  about that, for  if he
did not, his  people would send a  party to look for  him. Instead, he
would tell  of beasts  fifty feet tall  that could kill  a man  with a
mere blink of  its eye, and of tall trees  that swallowed unsuspecting
animals at  night. With that  thought in  mind, he descended  the tree
and started for the Ruined Tower.
    Tarnigen reached  the tower after  two day. A river  obscured from
sight by the trees  had barred his way so he had to  make a small raft
in order to cross.  The wooden gate had long since  been torn down and
was  reduced to  a pile  of  rotting wood  in  a corner  of the  large
courtyard that  encumbered the  tower. Moss  grew between  every crack
in  the giant  stone wall  that stood  around the  tower and  the even
larger wall  around the courtyard  was totally covered be  leafy green
vines that  hung down from  the long  unused torch holders  high above
Tarnigen head.
    He  entered   the  courtyard   steadily  walking  for   the  tower
entrance. As  yet, he had  not encountered  any animals or  beasts and
was,  to say  the least,  a bit  puzzled at  the odd  calmness of  the
continent. Then  he remembered what he  was there for, a  demon waited
for him  in the  tower. It  was probably aware  of his  presence since
the moment that he had set foot in the courtyard.
    He  reached into  his sack  and pulled  out his  sickle, a  weapon
that he  had been  training with since  he was a  child. It  was three
feet long  from the base  of its  handle to the  base of the  blade an
the blade  was two feet  long. The handle was  made of a  special grey
wood that  could be  grown only in  Cafthorn and the  handle was  of a
dark metal  of unearthly origin.  Close to the  base of the  blade was
an inlaid gem that glowed in a magnificent purple haze.
    Tarnigen  then entered  the tower  gate. The  gems glow  turned to
yellow lighting  the chamber to  reveal a  large hall with  a stairway
up  at  the far  end.  slowly  he moved  towards  it,  looking in  all
directions  for any  hint of  trouble.  Upon reaching  the stairs,  he
surveyed the room once more before starting up.
    The gem  then changed color to  a pale white and  Tarnigen stopped
and looked around.  The gem continued to glow in  the solemn white. He
took another  step, then another;  then fell.  A trap door  had opened
underneath his feat and had brought him to a lower level in the tower.
    Tarnigen stood  up. Luckily,  he was  not hurt  from the  fall. He
looked up  to see  the trap  door twenty feet  above him.  He examined
himself, but to his astonishment, he was not hurt.
    The  hallway that  he  had dropped  into was  long  an narrow.  It
sloped downward  at an  alarming angle ending  in darkness  some three
hundred  yards down.  The gem  lit the  hall with  its luminous  white
light as Tarnigen started his decent.
    The  passage ended  in  a small  room  with a  large  hole in  the
center.  In the  hole, a  dark  mist swirled  around like  water in  a
fountain. The  gem was still glowing  bright white. The the  mist rose
and  surrounded him.  the room  went dark  despite the  glowing sickle
that he held in his hand.
    After a  brief moment, the mist  dispersed. The gem was  no longer
glowing. And to Tarnigens surprise, he was no longer in the tower.
    He now stood  in a dark forest that stretched  in all direction as
far as the  eye could see. The  trees towered above his  head, some of
them out of sight into the low cloud cover.
    A loud cry  broke the air and  Tarnigen turn just in  time to meet
a small  party of tall  thin beasts unlike any  he had ever  seen. The
foremost  attacked him  immediately and  fell  to his  blade almost  a
fast. The rest  of the party turned and ran,  dropping there sacks and
fleeing in  terror into the  dark wood. Still confused,  Tarnigen left
the packs there and started in the direction that the beasts had come.
    A short walk brought  him to a large stone wall  much like that of
the Ruined  Tower's. He walked  around until  he reached a  gate which
was guarded  by four  very large  beasts not unlike  the ones  that he
had  come  across  a  little earlier.  He  cautiously  approached  the
largest of the  group. It stood unmoving as he  approached, it did not
even  seem to  breath. Once  Tarnigen  was in  striking distance,  the
beast lashed  at him  with one  of its numerous  claws and  ripped his
entire right arm off.
    Tarnigen  screamed  in disbelief,  but  he  felt nothing.  Another
blow from the  monster tore his upper body off  throwing both his legs
in  opposite  directions,  the  beast   picked  up  the  now  helpless
Tarnigen and opened its gaping jaws and bit his head from his neck.
    Tarnigen watched  the jaws  close about his  head, then  felt what
was left of  his severed body being  torn away from him.  There was no
pain at all though  he could feel that he was reduced  to only a head.
He rolled into the darkness of the beasts stomach and all went dark.
    Then once  again the  mist cleared. Once  again Tarnigen  stood in
the  room with  the swirling  mist in  the center.  He stood  slightly
dizzy  for a  moment and  then fell  to the  floor. Tarnigen  awakened
later to  find that  nothing had  changed. His sack  lay at  his feet,
his  weapon intact  in his  hand still  glowing its  solemn white.  He
stood up  and looked about the  room. The hallway leading  in was gone
and instead,  an adjacent  room stood  in its place.  The door  to the
room was understandably missing so he just entered.
    At the center of  the room was a large throne  inlaid with some of
the most  beautiful Malthoogian gems  that Tarnigen had ever  seen. In
the throne  sat a bony  figure, unmoving and expressionless.  And upon
its bleached  head sat  the Crown  of Grobst  D'arbo. The  Demon stood
up, the  burning crimson  eyes flashing  brightly rivaling  the strong
white light that poured out of the sickle in Tarnigens hand.
    The demon  looked in Tarnigens  direction as it removed  the crown
from its  head, and with its  bony fingers, it placed  the artifact on
the throne.  Then, from nowhere,  a long  sword appeared in  its hand.
Tarnigen raced the  Demon with his sickle raised in  front of him. The
demon was  shattered in to many  small bones and the  bones into dust.
Tarnigen looked  to the throne and  the crown, but they  sank into the
floor and disappeared from sight.
    A  door  appeared from  nowhere  in  the  wall  of the  room,  and
Tarnigen entered.  The sickle's gem changed  to a dull red  color that
barely lit the  room. In the corner  was a large stone  chest that sat
against  the wall.  Tarnigen walked  over and  set his  sack down.  He
opened the  chest to reveal  about fifty thousand  ancient Grandydyian
coins, many  diamonds and jewels  and under  some of the  wealth, just
visible, lay Grobsts Crown.
    The pale  light from the  sickle danced  up and down  his forehead
as he reached into the chest and grabbed the crown.
    "At last," he exclaimed.  " the crown is mine as  is the throne of
of Caffthorn."
    The  skull rolled  out from  the inside  the crown  and within  an
instant was  whole again.  Tarnigen reached for  his sickle  which now
glowed  it bright  white color,  but it  was too  late. the  demon had
already picked it up.
    Tarnigen stood helpless  as the demon changed and  grew. The bones
grew  skin and  the skin  grew hair.  Within a  moment a  fifteen foot
demon loomed  above him. It grinned  displaying a mouth full  of three
inch razor sharp fangs.
    "It is  but a small  man that tries to  steal the Crown  of Grobst
D'arbo? Well  behold me my true  form, human, before you  are banished
to limbo forever, I the Mighty King of Grandydyr decree!"
    With that,  the king swept  Tarnigen into  his hand and  flung him
into the  wall shattering most of  his bones. Then he  picked Tarnigen
of  the floor  and replaced  the crown  into the  chest, and  vanished
into a puff of smoke.

                     Spirit of the Wood: Chapter 4
    The openness had  a smell all it's own. Loric  breathed the clear,
cool  air above  the trees  with a  special relish.  One borne  of the
open spaces. He  believed the stars over his head  exhaled a sweetness
unlike anything in his valley.
    There  was a  rustling below  him  and he  leaned out  to see  his
sister  Silsia climbing  up behind  him. He  smiled at  her adeptness,
knowing that  it represented  many forbidden  practice runs.  Runs she
would  have been  punished for  had the  men known  that a  downlander
would dare the heights and walk among them.
    Loric  waited till  she came  along  side of  him and  gave her  a
signal  of greeting.  He could  not acknowledge  her presence  without
penalty,  but they  had an  unspoken  code, fingertalk  that they  had
learned in  the early  days of  Oldsir's blindness.  A skill  he never
used and they never forgot.
    She held  her hand out for  Loric to grasp. He  gripped it tightly
for  a moment,  knowing that  they  both had  come here  for the  same
reason. He had  come to tree-top level  to watch the sun  set and sing
a  farewell to  Oldsir. He  sang  Oldsirs song  to the  Spirit of  the
Wood, and then  the traditional songs of farewell. He  could have gone
home then,  but had  lingered to  watch for  Oldsir's star  to appear.
Everyone  felt that  since Oldsir  had been  given his  second vision,
his star  would be a  special one, even  the Downlanders had  dared to
speak of it aloud.
    There was  no hope for  them to spy it  from the ground,  and they
also knew  that Silsia would not  have missed trying to  see it. Loric
tapped on her palm: "I thought you were journeying to Wood's End?"
    "That was just  a rouse and you know it  near-man, dear brother. I
only wanted  the villagers to think  I was leaving, so  they would not
look for me up here."
    "I have passed all my tests, you can call me a man now."
    "But  your Shreaving  is  not  until tomorrow,  you  can lose  all
there. Would  you have me call  you a man,  and add being here  with a
man  to my  list? Perhaps  you'd want  me to  dance for  you when  you
return? It is not unknown..."
    Loric  blushed in  the darkness,  shocked at  what his  sister was
suggesting. Then  he heard the stifled  giggle, and knew that  she was
joking with him again.
    "The   wind  blows   exceptionally   hard   tonight."  he   mused,
halfturning in  her direction. It would  serve her right if  he caught
sight of her  and let out a call  of warning to the other  men here in
the trees. He  felt her squeeze his  hand tight enough to  wring a cry
from him, but he held silent.
    "Not as hard as a boy will blow to prove his manliness!"
    "A man  would have  made you  crabmeat by now,  but list!  Is this
how  the  Tolorions  show  respect  for the  dead?  I  have  not  seen
Oldsir's star, maybe he's not gone yet."
    Silsia's hand  went limp  and dropped  from his  for a  moment and
then came back. "He is gone Loric, I know it."
    "How?"
    She gave no  anwser, but she handed something around  the tree and
the  pungent smell  coming  from  the soft  leather  bag  was all  the
answer he needed. It was Oldsir's hearth-fire ashes.
    Water came  to Loric's eyes  as he opened the  bag and took  out a
pinch of  ash. He tossed  it over his  shoulder, then got  another and
rubbed it onto his  chest over his heart. He shook  half the rest into
his own pouch  and then tied the  pouch onto his belt.  The rest would
be for Dernhelm.
    "Loric? I  did something, I mean...  I took some of  the ash, some
of Oldsir.  Will that bring  dishonor to his  memory? When he  came to
me  while you  were taking  your  tests he  said that  the Spirit  had
called him and he  knew you would pass because you  were a Tolorion. I
was so  sad to see  him go, that  I told him  I wouldn't give  this to
you. He  said that  Spirit only  knows why they  don't let  women into
the trees, or  to have a Hearthfire,  but that he knew I  would do the
right  thing whether  that was  to pass  his ashes  along, or  to keep
them.  So I  went with  him,  he wouldn't  even tell  Dernhelm he  was
going. He  refused the  escort and  witnesses-male witnesses  that was
his due. I was  so confused when I got back I took  a pinch of the ash
and threw  it into  my cooking  fire. And it  worked Loric!  The magic
worked for  me, I'm not  a preist or  druid or even  a man, but  I saw
him! He was young,  and I saw mother there as a  child, he was showing
her how to use  a river vine to stretch skins... Then  it was gone and
I cryed  because of what I  had done. I  told Eadyie that I  was going
to Wood's  End and ran  into the forest and  wept till sunset.  Then I
came here."
    Loric  had  remained  silent  during her  long  communication.  He
concentrated closely on  the words her hands formed.  Not knowing what
to do  or say. If  Dernhelm heard of this  he would have  her expelled
from the village and  then he would leave himself out  of shame to the
Tolorion name.  Loric wasn't sure  he felt  the shame that  tribal law
would  place on  him.  He  felt that  his  sister  had done  something
daring and had passed a test of her own.
    Perhaps she  was more than a  woman herself now, but  what did the
making  of the  Hearthfire for  a woman  mean? Surely  his sister  was
posessed   of   more    magic   than   any   other    woman   in   the
Village-beneath-the-Trees.  Eadyie  herself  knew only  healing  herbs
and roots. He  knew that it was  the men who carried the  favor of the
Spirit and that made all magic theirs to command.
    Oldsir  had  a second  vision,  he  had  gone to  his  hearthfire,
taking  only his  grand-daughter as  honor  and escort.  Then she  had
made  her own  hearthfire  and  had not  been  consumed. The  portents
where there, if only he could read them a-right!
    "I don't know what to say. How do you feel?"
    "Terrible. Great. Awful. Glad, sad, and mad! How should I feel?"
    "The decisions of a moment..." began Loric.
    "Oh  shush child!  I know  that  as well  as you!  Oldsir did  not
spend all his time instructing you."
    Loric burned again  and said "The night wind  whispers against the
past. I will not tell it where to blow next."
    "Shall I  break this taboo also  Loric? Or shall we  keep this our
secret  as the  others? Till  our  hometree's roots  reach across  the
plains of Woe?  I can think of only  one thing to do. I  must speak to
the  Druid  who lives  in  the  valleys beyond  our  wood.  This is  a
greater matter than I or old 'quote the histories' Dernhelm."
    Loric held  her hand tight,  then signed slowly giving  weight and
meaning  to each  word. "I  think that  is best,  for I  love you  and
would not  have you leave  the tribe because  you can do  something no
one else in our  village can do. A woman who can  spell would not have
a good  chance at  a husband...  nor want  one I  beleive. But  if you
leave  on your  own then  when  I see  you  on the  paths beneath  the
trees, I will not  have to spit on your shadow,  or utter phrases best
saved for enemies,  not beloved sisters!" With that  he reached around
the narrow  truck that  sheilded her  from him and  hugged her  to it.
His arms did not  meet, but he held her as best he  could. He felt her
shake with silent sobs.
    Loric  looked  beseechingly  upwards  and  saw  a  bright  reddish
streak arc across  the sky and fall to earth  somewhere way beyond the
Wood. "Did you see?!" He gasped.
    "I saw,  Loric. Oldsir  did not  choose to stay  among his  kin in
the sky.  He has given  me a  sign. That is  the direction in  which I
must go!"
    "Hoo-ya!! Hoo-ya!!"  Came a call  from some tree beyond  Loric. It
was  Dernhelm. He  must have  been  watching for  Oldsir's star  also.
"Hoo-ya!  Hoo-ya!  A!" Loric  called  back.  Soon, all  the  tribesmen
called out in  blessing and happiness for Oldsir:  "Hoo-ya! Oldsir the
Second- sighted!  Hoo-ya hoo-ya hoo-ya a!  The Spirit of the  Wood has
called him back!"
    Loric  reached back  to grasp  his  sister's hand  but found  only
rough  bark. He  wanted to  attract  her attention  to a  glow on  the
horizon  that he  hadn't noticed  before,  but felt  only rough  bark.
Silsia Tolorion had gone.

                               The Dream
                           Part Four:  Choice
    When the  child, Herrn, came  to the temple for  Margala's monthly
supply of Hanla's  Tears, the robed man waiting in  the alcove was not
the usual supplier.  But, the priest accepted the large  bag of coins,
and  handed  Herrn back  one  just  a  little smaller.  Herrn  checked
within,  saw the  little  red-silver pills,  thanked  the priest,  and
left. No  one saw  the triumphant  smile of the  priest, hidden  as it
was by his deep cowl.
    Herrn arrived  back at Margala's  House before the empty  cache of
pills  was noted  by Margala  herself.  While barely  11 summers  old,
just  a  child, Herrn  was  street-wise,  and trusted  with  important
duties by  the old woman  who ran the House.  One of these  duties was
to keep  the supply of Hanla's  Tears, that dream drug,  current. But,
Herrn liked  to use the  little dream-givers himself  (without paying,
of  course).  And  this  past  week  he  had  overused  rather  badly,
exhausting the  supply on the morning  he was to get  the new month's.
He had  hastened to the  temple with the  money given him  by Margala,
hoping that  the old woman  wouldn't need any  of the pills  before he
returned.  That was  one reason  he  hadn't questioned  the fact  that
Brother Mikl wasn't in the alcove - he was in too much of a hurry.
    The  new  supply  was  barely  in its  box  when  Margala  entered
Herrn's room. She  said, "Good, little one. You have  returned just in
time. Fix me  up with five boxes,  and have more ready.  This is going
to be a busy day."
    When  Wend and  his  woman entered  Margala's  House, Margala  was
ready for  them. No  whispering was  needed - this  was the  sixth day
they had come in,  and it was the same every time.  She took the money
from Wend,  handed him  one of  the little pill  boxes that  Herrn had
given her, and  gave them room 21  to use. She watched  them climb the
stairs, and  wondered just what they  did in that room.  She knew that
they both  were Peace-Keepers in  one of  the upper markets,  and they
both  had good  pay, and  so homes  of their  own. She  didn't suppose
they used  her House  as a  trysting place,  though many  did. Perhaps
she  would find  an opportunity  to ask  Wend later  - they  had known
each other for a long time, after all.

    Je'en relaxed on the  bed as she had five times  so far. Wend said
that this should  be the last time  they would need the drug  - and it
was  true that  Je'en was  feeling a  lot better  now. Ever  since the
accident,  she  had  been  repressing her  memories,  hiding  all  the
things that  had been  very special  to her at  one point  because now
she had lost  them. But, since her arrival in  Dargon - the completion
of the  "plan" that  had kept  her going from  the accident,  thru Sir
Morion's School, and  to the meeting with her brother  - there had not
been anything  occupying her  time save  her job,  which was  about as
exciting  as staring  at  a lake  on  a windless,  grey  day. So,  her
memories  leaked to  the fore,  causing her  nightmares. But  Wend was
putting  a  stop to  that,  helping  her deal  with  the  loss of  her
musical abilities  in a  rational and  healthy way.  It caused  her to
wonder  just  what  he  was  doing  guarding  a  bunch  of  high-class
shopping stalls:  such knowledge as  he had used  to help her  was not
common, nor easily won.
    Wend took up  his place next to  the bed, and handed  her the pill
box,  and a  glass of  water. She  swallowed the  tiny pills  with the
water, and laid back down.
    Normally, she would  feel herself relaxing under  the influence of
the  drug, and  she would  fade into  sleep. But,  not this  time. Her
whole  body went  rigid seconds  after  she swallowed  the pills,  and
when it  relaxed, she  found herself  in a strange  place. It  was all
grey, featureless  save for  misty outlines  of indistinct  shapes. At
first,  she thought  she was  dreaming,  but this  had no  sense of  a
dream. She  wasn't awake,  either, but in  some strange  half-state, a
limbo of the senses.
    She stood,  and moved around in  the greyness. There seemed  to be
walls here,  in shape much  like the room she  had been in.  There was
no furniture,  but the  door was  where it should  have been,  and the
window likewise. Of Wend there was no trace.
    She  went  thru the  door,  and  into  a  shadowy version  of  the
House's  upper corridor.  She paced  throughout the  whole house,  but
didn't quite  date to venture outside  - looking out the  windows, she
had found outside to be even stranger than it was in here.
    She  had searched  the whole  house and  found it  empty, but  she
decided  to  call  out  anyway,  and when  she  did,  she  received  a
suprise.  Her voice  sounded  normal.  Normal, as  in  the pure,  alto
tones it had  had before her accident, not the  husky, almost gravelly
sound it had  settled into once the pain vanished.  She tried to sing,
and  succeeded. She  went over  to a  table, and  leaned on  her right
wrist, and it  didn't give way. Now, she was  certain she was dreaming
- she was fully healed once again!

    Wend  was looking  at the  still rigid  body of  Je'en on  the bed
worriedly. She was  very pale, and very rigid, almost  deathly so, but
he could see the  shallow rise and fall of her  breasts, and her heart
was still  beating, but slowly.  He sincerely  hoped that he  had done
the right thing. In  the past month or so that he  had known Je'en, he
had come to like  her. The man who had put him up  to this had assured
him that no  harm would come to  her, but seeing her  now, he couldn't
be sure.
    He heard  the door open behind  him, and turned. He  said, "She is
under the influence, Terkan. All has gone as planned."
    Terkan,  a short,  middle-aged man  who dressed  like a  merchant,
said, "Yes,  I know. Your  progress has  been monitored. Your  duty is
now done. You may leave."
    "The rest of the price, as we agreed?"
    "Will be  delivered to  you," answered  Terkan, staring  avidly at
Je'en on the bed.
    "I want  it now.  We agreed.  And, your  assurance again  that she
will be unharmed."
    "What  matters  it  to  you,  fool? You  will  be  paid  for  your
treachery,  and it  will not  be  the first  time you  have sold  your
honor for a little gold. Now leave; the money will arrive tonight."
    "What are you  going to do with  her? You must not harm  her - she
has done  nothing to you. She  doesn't even know you.  She hasn't been
in  Dargon long  enough  to have  injured you.  No.  Leave. Keep  your
second payment,  and I  will return  the first. Tell  me how  to bring
her out of this trance, and then leave. You cannot have her."
    Terkan smiled  cruely, and said, "No.  A deal is a  deal, and this
deal  is done.  She is  ours,  now, and  that  is that.  You had  best
leave, and take your payment like a good little turncoat."
    Wend drew his  sword and lunged, but, for  all Terkan's appearance
of a middle-aged  merchant, he moved faster. Wend never  saw the knife
flick out of the  sleeve and into his neck. He  fell at Terkan's feet,
dead.  Terkan  then  turned  his  eyes toward  Je'en,  and  the  sword
propped up  against the wall. For  a moment, he thought  of taking it,
but  that  was too  dangerous.  It  had to  be  freely  given. It  was
dangerous enough  for him to  be in  this room -  to have a  member of
the  Septent present,  involved directly.  But, the  slightly modified
Hanla's Tears that  Je'en had taken had  put her in a  state that only
a Full  Adept of Jhel  could penetrate, so there  was no help  for it.
Perhaps, when Jhel's  ministry began to spread again,  he could become
Brother Un somewhere,  instead of just Brother Tri, as  reward for the
risk he was taking.
    So thinking, he began to put the finishing touches on his plan.

    Cefn  stopped shuffling  the cards,  cut them,  and layed  out the
Bent Star pattern. It appeared exactly as before. Nothing conclusive!
    Stifling the  impulse to  curse loud  and long  (the last  time he
had given vent  to such oath-making, he had  inadvertantly leveled his
previous house, and  laid waste to about a square  hectare of the land
about it), he was  about to sweep the cards from  the table yet again,
when  something  caught  his  eye. He  extinguished  the  light  globe
overhead, to  better see the  cards. Yes,  there, the fifth  ray, last
card. Trump 35,  The Entwined Oak. It meant danger,  and it had always
been  there. But,  today, it  was reversed  - the  only change  in the
pattern  for the  past  week.  And the  Tree  reversed meant  imminent
peril,  instead of  vague danger  on  the horizon.  It was  happening.
Now. Je'en was in trouble.
    He  gathered up  the  cards  again, and,  using  Trump  35 as  the
significator, he layed  out a different pattern,  a secretly developed
one taught  him by  his master a  long time ago.  It told  him exactly
what he needed  to know, and leaving  it lying, he left  the dark room
to muster some help for his charge.

    Je'en was becomming  worried. This weird limbo she  was trapped in
was  beginning  to  wear on  her.  And,  there  was  the fact  of  her
regained ability to  contend with. It didn't really feel  like a dream
at all, and she had been trained to recognize such.
    She had  returned to the  upper room in  hopes that Wend  would be
able to  reach her  better there.  She was staring  out the  window at
the swirling chaos  there when she heard a sound.  She turned, and saw
that she was no longer alone.
    "Welcome,  my dear,  to your  heart's desire.  My name  is Terkan,
and I  am responsible for  your being here. I  also have the  power to
let you stay here, if you so wish."
    Je'en  stared  at the  man  who  had  spoken.  He was  dressed  in
strangely symboled robes  that glowed palely, and there was  an air of
mystery and  power about him.  She said, "What  do you mean?  Where am
I, and why would I want to stay in such a shadowy place?"
    "This  is but  a  gateway from  our world  into  another. In  that
other, you would  have all of your former abilities,  as well as those
you have  gained since the  accident. And that  is why you  would want
to stay  here. I  can show you  the way into  that other  world, where
you would be  as you are now,  fully healed and whole. There  is but a
small price."
    Je'en  grew immediately  wary.  She believed  the  man, for  there
were tales of  other worlds and passages between them.  This limbo was
not like any  of the stories, but  then the stories were  old. She was
wary for a  different reason. She had obviously been  led into this by
a long  and very  twisted path, and  she wanted to  know why.  If this
man Terkan  had been acting  charitably, he would have  simply offered
her the  choice for  free, without  all this  subterfuge. What  did he
want, and why?
    "What price?" she asked. "And what of my companion, Wend?"
    "Ah, Wend.  Well, he was  in my employ, you  see. The drug  I used
on you is illegal  in Baranur - and very rare  and expensive. Wend was
well  paid to  get you  into the  proper state,  but at  the last,  he
decided  that his  salary for  the job  wasn't enough.  You see,  that
sword  you carry  is very  valuable to  certain people,  but it  has a
spell on  it that it  cannot be taken, it  must change owners  by free
will. My sponsors  are willing to pay  a large sum of money  to me for
this  sword,  some of  which  Wend  would  have  gotten. But,  he  got
greedy, and wanted it all. So, I had to kill him."
    "But,  why not  just come  to me  and ask  for the  sword? I  have
little sentimental  value for  it, and  would sell  it gladly  for the
right price. Why all of this?"
    Terkan smiled  a little nervously,  and said, "Well, I  thought to
pay you  in other kind,  being a little  greedy myself. When  a little
research revealed a  certain incident in Magnus, I  decided to restore
to you your Bardic abilities, if you so choose."
    It  almost  made sense  to  Je'en.  But,  not  quite. It  was  too
devious.  All of  the  secrecy, Wend's  supposed  duplicity, the  mild
drug to lull her senses. There was something more. There had to be.
    But, so what.  Terkan was indeed offering her  her heart's desire.
For, tho  Wend had  cured her  of her nightmares,  the desire  to make
music remained  as much  a part  of her  as ever.  And it  seemed that
here, and  (if Terkan was  to be believed) in  the world on  the other
side  of  this  gate, she  could  be  a  bard  again. Was  that  worth
whatever the real reason behind Terkan's manuevering was?

                           Part Five:  Rescue
    Cefn and Mahr  rode into Dargon at a gallop.  They hadn't actually
ridden that far  - Cefn's home was  much too far from  Dargon, so they
had used  a little magic  to help them on  their way. Cefn,  robed and
deeply cowled, led  the way at an unsafe speed  through the streets of
Dargon, arousing cries of suprise as they galloped past citizens.
    The wizard  reined in  just outside of  Margala's House.  He raced
to  the front  door, Mahr  behind him,  and entered  without knocking.
They dashed  past the suprised  Margala, and  up the stairs,  down the
hall, to room 21.
    They entered  the room without  any ceremony (after  Cefn unbarred
it by setting a  glowing hand on the knob), and  Mahr looked around as
her Master got  to work immediately. Mahr  saw Je'en on the  bed - the
first time  she had seen  their charge in  the flesh. She  looked much
the same  as in  the Image  Table, or Cefn's  Scrying Prism,  save for
the  fact that  she  was  obviously in  trouble.  Her  whole body  was
rigid,  with  just a  faint  rise  and fall  in  her  chest to  denote
breathing. Her  face, what could  be seen  around the mask,  looked to
be drawn in  suprise, perhaps pain - her eyes  were closed tight shut,
and her mouth was a compressed line.
    She turned  quickly away from  the body  in the corner.  Mahr knew
who it was.  She had seen Wend  and Je'en together in the  city in the
Image Table. She was  sorry he was dead - he  had treated Je'en kindly
- but she  wasn't sure why he was  dead, or if he had had  any part in
getting Je'en into the vulnerable position she was in now.
    The other  person in the  room, a middle  aged man dressed  like a
merchant,  was kneeling  and  sitting on  his  folded-under legs.  His
fingers  were contorted  into  the Triple-cross  sign,  and his  hands
rested on  his knees.  He seemed  to be  concentrating, focusing  on a
small  medallion on  his lap,  but his  eyes were  closed. His  breath
came as slowly  and shallowly as did Je'en. Cefn  had explained little
- their ride had  been short and hurried - but  Mahr realized that the
meditating man was  one of the enemy. She even  fancied she could feel
an aura of evil about him.
    Cefn said, "Mahr, south-east, quickly."
    Mahr  fetched the  compass  from  her belt  pouch,  and noted  the
requested direction,  then pointed. Cefn  took a small blue  angle and
placed it on  the floor pointing where Mahr had  indicated. Then, Cefn
removed six other  angles form a small yellow pouch,  all colored red,
and touched them,  one at a time,  to the blue one. As  they came into
contact with  the first angle,  they each began  to glow, and  as Cefn
released them, they  moved of their own accord to  their proper place.
When the  sixth red angle  had settled  into place, forming,  with the
blue one,  a seven-pointed star, the  first angle also began  to glow,
causing a  webwork of lines  to spring up  between all of  the angles,
forming a solid seven-sided figure with a seven-pointed star within.
    Cefn beckoned,  and Mahr joined him  at the center of  the figure.
He asked,  "Ready?" Mahr nodded,  and Cefn said  a word. Blue  and red
flame  shot up  from  the  outlines of  the  figure,  climbing to  the
ceiling and blotting  out the room around them. It  flared for several
seconds, and then it died, revealing a vastly different scene.
    It was a  shadowly, limbo place, vaguely resembling  the room they
had come  from. The formerly meditating  man, now dressed as  a priest
of  Jhel, was  speaking. "We  don't  really have  forever, Je'en.  The
drug you were given  will wear off in time, and I  don't have any more
with  me. You  must decide.  Which  will it  be  - keep  the sword  or
become a Bard again?"
    Cefn said,  softly, "Mahr,  stay within  the septacle.  This could
get messy."  Then, louder, "Je'en,  don't listen  to that man.  He has
lied to you. Whatever you do, do not give him your sword."
    Both parties  turned at the  sound of  the mage's voice.  Mahr saw
that Je'en  wasn't wearing  her mask  here, and there  was no  scar on
her  suprised face.  The priest  scowled, and  said "Just  who do  you
think you are? This woman can make up her own mind - leave her alone."
    Cefn ignored  the man,  and took  a few  steps towards  Je'en (and
out of the septacle).  "Je'en, this man is a priest  of Jhel. Have you
ever heard  of that  particular cult?  Well, its  been outlawed  for a
very long  time. The  last remaining  members of  this cult  are right
here in  Dargon, and  this man  is one  of them.  The sword  you bear,
that you  got from the vaults  of the College in  Magnus, just happens
to be the key  to a prophecy of total world  victory for the followers
of Jhel, and the  prophecy is not just words - if  the high priests of
Jhel  get hold  of that  sword,  and release  what is  within it,  the
whole world will fall to them."
    "Why  should I  believe you,  instead of  this man?"  asked Je'en.
She was  even more confused  now. If the  tall, cowled man  was right,
the priest's  interest was explained,  but she couldn't be  sure. And,
if she could  really enter another world, and have  her heart's desire
in that world, did she care what happened in the one she had left?
    "Je'en, please.  You must  listen to  me. Just  now, when  he said
that the  drug would wear  off - it won't.  You'll be trapped  in this
limbo  forever. Even  after your  body dies,  your spirit  will wander
here endlessly. You  have regained your bardic skills  and whole body,
but to what use?  The beings who inhabit this realm  need no music for
entertainment -  they have  other amusements.  Please, do  not accept.
He  will give  you nothing  in return,  and destroy  the world  in the
bargain. Deny his offer, come to me, and we will depart."
    There was  something about the  cowled man that prompted  Je'en to
trust him. Perhaps,  it was because he wanted nothing  from her except
to give  up what the  other man had  supposedly given her.  She turned
from  him to  the  priest, and  saw  the  scowl on  his  face. It  was
actually more  than a  scowl, it  was pure  rage and  hatred concealed
badly.  Je'en made  her  decision -  she  began to  walk  over to  the
taller man.
    The priest  shouted "No!"  and flung an  arm across  Je'en's path.
>From his  fingers a  siclky purple-green line  of fire  flashed across
the room, between  Je'en and the cowled man. The  priest swung his arm
behind him,  and the line of  fire became a translucent  wall dividing
the whole room  in half, with Je'en  on one side, and  the other three
on the other.
    Je'en tried  to push thru  the green-purple wall, but  touching it
caused so much  pain that she cried  out and fell back.  So, she could
only watch what was going on on the other side.
    Mahr was  watching, too. She had  never seen her master  in an all
out Duel of  magic. Such a thing  was very rare, as  were magicians of
most any  caliber. She  was not  suprised that  the priest  could hold
his  own against  Cefn -  it had  rapidly become  obvious that  he was
high up  in the priestly order  of Jhel, perhaps even  in the Septent,
and it was well  known (to those who knew at all)  that the highest of
Jhel's followers were renowned magic users.
    The  contest was  incomprehensible to  non-participants. All  that
was visible  of the striving  was stray  emissions - attacks  that did
not make  their mark, the  efluvia of shattered thrusts,  and leakages
of gathered  force for an attack.  Mahr saw her master  seemingly just
standing,  cowl  thrown back,  hands  slightly  forward of  his  body,
facing the  priest, who was  in a  similar position. Light  flashed to
the sides  of them,  and Mahr  started as  several stray  attacks that
shattered against  the protection  of the  septacle. She  noticed that
the wall created by the priest was similar protection for Je'en.
    Eventually,  the battle  began  to go  against  the priest.  There
were few  stray emissions around  the priest anymore,  indicating more
on-the- mark attacks.  He began to sweat, and his  hands began to move
higher and  higher as he worked  harder to attack and  defend himself.
He began  to glance furtively  around for a way  out. His eyes  lit on
Mahr and her protection, and he smiled.
    His hands  began to  point different directions,  and he  began to
direct energy at  the ground around the septacle, as  well as at Cefn.
The ground  below the septacle began  to thin, but no  one noticed, so
intent were  they on the  battle. Slowly,  Terkan's magic ate  away at
the  fabric of  the  limbo  space, until  finally  it  gave way.  Mahr
screamed as she fell thru into somewhere else.
    Cefn turned in  time to see his apprentice vanish,  along with the
septacle, intact.  With a little  cry, he darted  over to the  hole in
the floor  to try to  help her. Seeing  his chance, Terkan  prepared a
final blow, aimed at Cefn's defenceless back.
    Je'en saw  Terkan smiling  at the undefended  mage, and  knew that
the mage was  in trouble. She braced herself and  threw herself at the
purple-green  wall,  and at  Terkan.  Pain  lanced thru  her,  searing
every nerve,  causing her  to scream  in agony -  but she  kept going.
She moved  through treacle, taking forever  - a forever of  agony - to
reach the man,  but reach him she did, knocking  him down, causing him
to  lose  his  concentration,  and  his  spell  backfired.  Je'en  lay
panting and crying  from the pain for several minutes  before she felt
the other  man gently move  her from on top  of Terkan, who  seemed to
be unconscious.
    Cefn examined the  priest, and deemed him safe for  the moment. He
returned his attention to Je'en, and said, "Are you alright?"
    Je'en  sat up  groggily,  and  looked at  her  rescuer. She  first
noted  his eyes  - pure  blue all  thru. He  was handsome,  with thin,
aristocratic features, but his eyes seemed something out of legends.
    She finally said, "Yes, I'm alright. Your friend..."
    "Mahr was  my apprentice. She  is beyond hope. Perhaps  my masters
will look  kindly on her,  save her, but she  will not return  to this
world. I should have been prepared for treachery. I..."
    "Um, thank you  for saving me," said Je'en. "Who  are you, anyway,
and why?"
    Cefn said,  "My appologies,  Je'en. My name  is Cefn  an'Derin. My
occupation should be  obvious. What I said about Jhel  was true - your
sword is  the key to  the priests  of Jhel's armageddon  prophecy, and
this  man, probably  one of  the leaders  of the  cult, was  trying to
wrest  it from  you.  We, Mahr  and  I, have  been  involved with  the
downfall of Jhel,  and have been watching you carefully,  which is why
he  tried to  trick you  into  giving him  the sword.  Only his  brief
possessive thought  alerted my surveilance  to the fact that  you were
in trouble.  Now, we - I  - have the key  we need to destroy  the rest
of the Septent of Jhel in Dargon, and destroy her worship for good."
    Cefn reached,  perhaps a little  wearily, into his  belt-pouch and
withdrew  a  small hemisphere  of  dark  glass.  Je'en watched  as  he
placed the  glass dome on Terkan's  temple, and said a  word. The dome
began to  glow, and the unconscious  Terkan began to grimace  in pain.
It took  about five minutes for  the dome to  do its work, and  by the
end,  Terkan was  screaming  soundlessly. When  the hemisphere  ceased
glowing, Cefn  removed it from Terkan's  head. It left a  charred spot
where  it  had  rested, and  it  was  no  longer  dark, but  rather  a
swirling milky-white.
    Cefn said,  "Within this  theryum is all  of the  priests memories
and thoughts. With  this, I can masquerade as him,  gain admittance to
a high meeting of the Brothers, and destroy them.
    "Come, Je'en.  Let us return  to Dargon.  I think the  priest will
be happy to suffer the imprisonment he meant for you."
    "Wait,  Master Cefn.  Terkan, the  priest, he  said that  he could
send me to another  world, where I would be able  to sing again. Could
you do that as he said? If so, I would rather not return to Dargon."
    "I'm sorry, Je'en,  but that was another lie. There  is no way for
our magics  to penetrate the  dimensional boundaries. This  is another
plane of  existence, and in  it, you  bear your spirit-body,  which is
as  healthy and  whole  as you  wish  it  to be.  But,  human life  is
foreign to  this plane,  and its  natural inhabitants  enjoy torturing
anyone or thing foreign."
    Cefn had  begun setting up  another septacle, orienting  the major
angle on  a sense he  had of the  proper direction. Je'en  watched the
little red  angles dart around  of their own accord  with fascination.
When it was done, Cefn motioned her into the center of the figure.
    She said, before  Cefn could begin to activate  the septacle, "So,
what now?  You have the  means to destroy this  cult of Jhel,  but you
have also  lost your apprentice.  What will  you do when  your mission
is complete?"
    Cefn looked  at Je'en, and she  saw sadness in his  face. He said,
"Mahr and  I worked long  and hard to destroy  Jhel. I shall  miss her
greatly,  yet some  kind of  loss is  fitting, in  a way.  As to  what
next, I have  no idea. My time  is finally once again  my own. Perhaps
I'll do  some more research,  maybe find another apprentice,  and pass
along my knowledge. I just don't know."
    "Why  don't we  team  up," said  Je'en. "I  have  been getting  so
bored  in that  Peace-keeper job  I've got,  that it  nearly drove  me
mad.  But, in  a  land  that is  so  sparsely  populated, and  largely
unknown,  there must  be some  more exciting  work for  a swordswoman,
and  it will  be even  more  exciting with  a real  magician along  to
help. Sound good?"
    Cefn  was silent  for a  long time.  In truth,  the idea  seemed a
good one  - but Je'en didn't  know very much about  him, including the
part he had  played in her present circumstances. Still,  the offer of
adventure sure sounded  better than a lot of  reclusive research. And,
he had grown  to like Je'en while watching and  protecting her. So, he
finally said, "Sure.  Why not? Let's be a team!"  And he activated the
magic that returned them to the real world and Dargon.
