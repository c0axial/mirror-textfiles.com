                                EDITORIAL
      Well, folks,  hello,  and welcome to issue two of FSFnet!   Just
   two or three little things to mention for now...
      First of all,  FSFnet NEEDS  SUBMISSIONS!!!   This zine can only
   survive if YOU contribute.   I have had a number of people say that
   they  were interested  in  contributing,  but  very  few have  come
   through.   I realize it is difficult  and time-consuming,  but I am
   sure you all would like to continue receiving FSFnet.  Well, I need
   your help.   I can't do it all myself, although sometimes I have to
   try...
      I  would also like to welcome all our new members.   The mailing
   list is  currently running  about 70  to 75.    Please continue  to
   spread the word,  and get more people to subscribe!   At least it's
   no strain on the wallet!
      For those people who are interested  in a game of Diplomacy over
   the Net, I have already begun game 1, and, if sufficient people are
   interested,  I  will run  a second  game.   Contact  me if  you are
   interested.
      Well,  enough of the propaganda.   I  hope you enjoy this issue,
   although it is  perhaps not as good  as the last (since  I have had
   only one  submission since  issue 1  came out).    Next issue  will
   feature my  discussion of  the works of  the fantasy  author Tanith
   Lee,  and whatever else anyone  sends me.   Please submit articles!
   Until soon...

                     ''1984--ORWELLIAN REFLECTIONS''

                                    I
                               'THE CHILL'

         The Naive worry that the world will end in Fire,
              a nuclear holocaust.
                   --How lost we are!

         I do not worry, because I already know
              that it will end in Ice.
           Many times I've felt
             death's unmistakeable chill
               glissando up my spine.
                   --How fortunate are we
                     to be the children of a new era!

         The Electronic Age, conceived
           through the toil of unremembered men;
             who sacrificed their lives for us
               for this.
                         This!

               (let us end this talk of discontent;
                there is no time for emotion,
                We must hurry on!)

                                   II
                              'The Church'

         We are at war again.
         "With whom?" you ask.
         "The Communists, of course." he replies.

         But where are they, these "Communists?"
         So, "They live in Russia." you say.
           I think not.

         Have you ever seen one?
         "No." you say.
         Then how do you know that they are worse: more evil,
           than you or I?

         Think there.

         There, they are at war with "the Americans."
         Think that they have ever seen one?
           Again, I think not.
         We have as little to fear them for
           as they have for fearing us.
         So, why do we fear them?
         Are they not men?

         You say we fear them because they
           will take the land we love by force,
             with all their missiles, planes and bombs.

                             Open your eyes.

         They won't take this land by force,
           for they have taken it already.

         Who are "they" anyway?
         Look in the mirror, comrade.
         They are we.

         Let's change the flag tomorrow.
         I think red with a golden reaper
           would look sharp.

                                   III
                             'The Craftsman'

              (How wonderful it must have been,
               to live in the age of patient craftsmen.
               Men took pride in the work of their hands,
               and women, wanting their place,
                 stood close behind their men.)

         How sluggish they make me feel as they rush by.
         I am a craftsman born late--
           they leave me behind
             in a cloud of hydrocarbon.

                            CP QUERY MAIL ALL

      Orny,   Was  quite pleased  to receive  first edition  of FSFNET
   today.  I enjoyed the stories, and am interested in seeing how this
   piece of electronic imagination fares.   I hope with this, you will
   start a "Readers' Responses" section.
      First a  commendation:   I am most  impressed with the  level of
   literacy in FSFNET.    Having been a bitnet user for  some time,  I
   have seen some  of the worst molestations committed  on the English
   language by  computer users.   I am  relieved to see that  there is
   someone out there who CAN spell.   Next, please tell us what format
   you would like  items submitted in.   Allow me to  suggest that you
   extend  you line  length a  bit to,   say  65 or  70 characters  to
   conserve file and spool area.
      I  am looking  forward  to reading  and  contributing to  future
   issues.  On the whole, I'd say it's a brilliant idea!
                                 -Victor

      Orny,
      got V1N1 of FSFnet.  Thanks.  I like the idea.  send more.   How
   about a play-by-net Traveller game?  If asked nicely,  I could find
   the time  to referee  it (sometime  during the  weekends).  If  any
   Inspirations hit me, I'll send them to you.

   PS - here's an illustration for you next issue.

   PPS - a  LOC (what's a zine  without LOC's?)  on Mike  Foley's Dune
   review:

      I only  have 2  comments to  add to  Mike's excellent  review of
   Dune:
      1)  While the movie is a reasonably good adaptation of the book,
   it really falls apart in a couple  of places.  One is when Paul and
   Jessica first  meet the  Fremen.  The  scene in  the cave  bears no
   resemblance to what happened in the book.
      2)   Probably  due  to  the   restricted  time  available  in  a
   screenplay,  a major amount of the  intrigue so central to the book
   was lost.    Although the first half  of the movie is  provide this
   feeling  of "plots  within plots  within  plots",  I  felt that  it
   failed.  Due  to the  small amount of  time available,   not enough
   background could  be presented  for a  viewer who  hadn't read  the
   book,  and by taking time to  present background,  even more of the
   intrigue  is   lost  for  the  person   who  has  read   the  book.
   Unfortunately,   the movie  found  that  unhappy medium  where  the
   beginner  is  lost,   and  the  omissions  become  obvious  to  the
   knowledgeable viewer.
      Other  than  those  two  gripes,  I  think  that  the  film  was
   enjoyable, and a good (but not perfect) adaptation of the book.

                      Featured Author: LARRY NIVEN
      Most  famous for  his  Known Space  series,   Larry  Niven is  a
   classical science fiction author who sometimes dabbles in the arena
   of fantasy fiction.    Some of his best works are  from his earlier
   Known Space volumes,  which include  Neutron Star,  Protector,  the
   Long ARM of Gil Hamilton, and many more, culminating in perhaps his
   best known works,  Ringworld,  and the Ringworld Engineers.   These
   books began as unrelated science fiction stories, but later came to
   represent  different  tales  within  the   same  sphere  of  space.
   Ringworld  is a  major  work of  science  fiction,  and  represents
   Niven's break from  traditional science fiction to  modern writing.
   The Ringworld  Engineers attempts  to solve  a number  of questions
   left unresolved in the first book.  These are all excellent science
   fiction works, and well worth the effort to read.
      Niven  has  also  written  some books  which  are  not  directly
   connected with Known Space.   In  conjunction with Jerry Pournelle,
   Niven has written Lucifer's Hammer,  a tale set in the near future,
   and the Mote in Gods Eye,  which  I consider his best work to date.
   It is a fascinating tale of man's first contact with aliens, and is
   an engrossing and captivating work.    Niven has also written works
   of pure fantasy, namely his 'Magic' series,  which,  as examples of
   fantasy literature, are neither outstanding nor unworthy.  His most
   recent work, the Integral Trees, has just come out in paperback, as
   has another new book, Limits.

      Also  of  interest   to  Niven  fans  might   be  the  Ringworld
   roleplaying game,  which was released recently by the Chaosium game
   company.   As  a sourcebook  for the  Ringworld,  it  is excellent,
   although it requires a very strong gamemaster,  since the rules are
   a little sketchy.   The Ringworld  Companion,  a supplement to this
   game, has also been put on the market.

                             Close Encounter
      "I think we should be heading back to the station now," grumbled
   Seargent White,"it's  getting  mighty cold  now."  He  slapped  his
   ungloved hands against his chest,  trying  vainly to keep them warm
   in this  sub zero night.   His exhaled  breath turned into  a thick
   white cloud and drifted away, as if to underline his statement.
      "Yea.  It's almost eleven now, anyway.", replied Officer Bennet.
   He opened the  door to the squad  car and climbed into  the drivers
   seat.   The other door opened as  John White climbed in beside him.
   With a  reluctant grumble the  engine turned  over and the  old car
   started to move down the dark road.
      After driving past several miles of uneventful pine forest, John
   White cried "Stop!  Stop the car!".   With squeal of rubber against
   tar the car slowed to a halt.  "What the hell is that up there,  by
   the side of the road?" asked John.
      Peering through the gloom Sam saw what appeared to be a man,  on
   the tall side standing  by the side of the road  about twenty yards
   along the road staring at the woods  in back of him.  The strangest
   thing it was he seemed to be naked.
      "Either that guy is drunk, crazy, or an eskimo!" said Sam.
      "All the same,  we should bring him in to the station,  at least
   to get him warm."
      "You stay here in the car, and I'll go get him."
      "Maybe we should both get him, he could get rowdy." said John
      "Come on."
      The doors to the squad car creaked open, as Sam and John stepped
   out of the car.   The walked slowly toward the figure  in the road.
   When they  were eight feet away  from the man,  they  stopped.  The
   shadowy figure turned and silently faced them.
      "Easy now, we don't want to panic him." whispered Sam.
      John slowly  took the flashlight from  his belt and shone  it at
   the figure.  The bright circle of  light landed on the figures neck
   and face, revealing a human head. Around the neck was a small black
   box, with two small lights on it, silently winking.
      "Greetings.  I am Varrk, emissary from the planet Davron, of the
   star Sirus 5" said the figure in slow measured tones.
      "He's fucking dunk!" hissed Sam
      "I have been  sent here to establish  peaceful relations between
   our two cultures." said Varrk.
      "Yea. You just come with us, we have a nice warm cell for you to
   get all sobered up. Now come along." said Sam
      "No I  must let  the mother  ship know  of my  contact." replied
   Varrk
      "We'll let you do that later. Now come with us."
      "No, I must message my mother ship."
      "You'll not do that 'till tomorrow" said Sam.
      Then he and John grabbed each of  Varrk's arms and tried to drag
   him towards  the waiting  squad car.  With  a surprising  display of
   strength,  Varrk throws  both John and Sam into the  dirt along the
   side of the road.  He then swiftly walks toward the dark reaches of
   the forest.
      "Wing him in the leg, Sam!! He'll get away!" yelled John
      With a quick  explosion of fire Sam's gun spits  a bullet strait
   towards  Varrk's  right  leg.   There  is  no  reaction  and  Varrk
   disappears into the woods.
      "You idiot!  You missed him,  at point blank,  and he got away!"
   screamed John.
      "I could've sworn I hit him.  I  could've sworn I hit him in the
   leg" Sam quietly said.
      "We might as well go back to the car and report him,  somebody's
   bound to find him sooner or later." said John.
      They both got up  off of the cold ground and  headed back toward
   the squad car. About halfway there, John stopped.
      "What was that?" asked John
      "What was what?" said Sam
      "That sound, a low humming."
      "Probably a bullfrog,  lets get back to the car,  it's damn cold
   out here"
      "No, it isn't a frog,  its getting louder.  Do you hear it now?"
   asked John.
      Before Sam could reply a light bathed  the top of the pine trees
   to there north, and as slowly as a balloon,  a long silver cylinder
   rose  above the  tree  tops.  It  hovered there  for  a moment  and
   streaked into  the sky to  the north  with a loud  whining.  Within
   several seconds a warm blew past John and Sam,  standing stunned at
   the side of the road.
      "What in God's good name was that?" whispered Sam.
      "I have no idea, but maybe Varrk was telling the truth."
