    Well,  the honeymoon  is over,  in a  thoroughly literal  sense. I
have  returned  from the  Society  for  Creative Anachronism's  annual
Pennsic  War unharmed,  save  for  a slight  sunburn  and some  poison
ivy...  For those  of you  who aren't  familiar with  Pennsic, imagine
over 5000  medieval recreationists  taking part  in a  week-long event
featuring tournaments,  merchants, feasts,  revels, court,  raids, and
much  more, culminating  in the  annual war  between the  Midrealm and
the East  Kingdom. Let me  tell you, it  was quite an  experience! And
although  the Dargon  project conference  never did  materialize, John
White and  I did manage  to get a little  talking done, and  I managed
to meet a reader  or two as well. All in all, it  was a very enjoyable
experience, and I hope to see more of you there in future years!
    But back to  the news. Hardcopy subscriptions are  almost ready to
actually be  implemented (after blowing up  my last printer, I  have a
new one currently  on order). And a potentially  major development was
the  recent  announcement that  the  WISCVM  inter-network gateway  is
considering closing  down. There is  currently a lively debate  by the
powers that be as  to how BITNET is going to  maintain access to other
networks. I strongly  suspect that BITNET will continue  to maintain a
gateway, even  should WISCVM shut  down, and  I doubt that  there will
be any great effect upon FSFnet distribution should this occur.
    And  finally, you  might  notice that  direct FSFnet  distribution
has broken  400 with this  issue. I'm very  pleased with this,  and am
hopeful  that we  will continue  to grow.  Be sure  to show  issues to
friends who  might be  interested, and keep  spreading the  word! This
will be the final  issue of volume 8, and the first  issue of volume 9
should be out in mid-September. And remember, September is "Be Kind to
your Editor" month...

                    Ceda the Executioner: Chapter 7
    It was  close to  the end  of that day  ere Ceda  rode out  of the
west  gate of  Caahah on  his wingless  dragon mount,  Melgon. In  the
pouch at  his side  was the  Crown of  Grobst D'arbo  and on  his back
rested  Renielk which  glowed  in a  bright white  aura  as they  rode
though  the Ruirsian  countryside approaching  the forest  of Nen.  He
rode half that  night with the radiance  of the moon aided  by the axe
to guide his mount before they set up camp on a mound of lush grass.
    By first light  he had awakened and was on  Melgon riding fast for
the forest border.  To the north the Aun Hills  were barely visible in
the  early morning  sky and  to the  east the  sun was  already rising
making  long  shadows  in  front  of them  as  they  rode  on;  before
midmorning they had reached the large forest of Nen.
    At the  forest entrance where  the path disappeared into  the dark
trees before  them, Ceda stopped  Melgon as  he took Renielk  from his
back and  placed it across  his legs  before entering the  forest. The
gem  had been  glowing white  since he  had left  the distant  city of
Caahah  and was  subsequently useless  to him,  but in  any case  Ceda
sensed that  the glow  had lessened a  bit. He slowed  his mount  to a
cautious trot while loosening Melgon's reins before entering.

    The trail  grew difficult as  he entered;  being in bad  upkeep it
would take  some time to ride  through Nen, though going  around would
take  much more  time than  Ceda  had to  spare. He  pushed Melgon  on
slightly faster as  they made their way though the  trees and soon the
entrance was well out of sight behind them.
    All  around the  Traveler and  his  mount were  green plants;  the
soil was moist  and the air was  sweet. Nen had not  yet been infested
by the vile creatures of the Sarshirians.
    Suddenly four men  dropped from the trees above  Ceda's head. They
had long  and sharp swords  but wore  no armor. Ceda  immediately slid
down  Melgon's scaly  back onto  the soft  ground and  gripped Renielk
tightly as he turned to face the attackers.
    "Halt!"  Shouted  one   of  the  men  as  Ceda   lowered  his  axe
recognizing the  blue and yellow  colors of Ruirsian warriors.  "He is
a man."
    "Hail, scouts  of Ruirse! I  am Ceda of No-Al  Ben. I am  in hasty
flight  and  ask that  I  may  pass. I  ride  with  authority of  King
Threythus and all that hinder me in this hour shall answer his wrath!"
    "Strong words  you speak," said  the leader. "But these  are times
of war and  all who travel through the lands  of his majesty Threythus
must do so with the consent of his scouts. What is your destination?"
    "I am  bound for the  desert," answered Ceda yielding.  "What else
must you know? Time is short, ask swiftly!"
    "Where in  the desert  do you intend  to go? Know  you not  of the
Orcs?  They  roam much  of  the  area to  the  south  of the  City  of
Pheeng'Am even  though we control  it; it  is too dangerous  to travel
there without a  large escort. If it  is to No-Al Ben  that you travel
then I  advise you to  take the  road back east  the way you  came and
journey around the Aun Hills to the desert in the north."
    "The  way north  of the  Hills is  no longer  safe. The  enemy has
taken all of  Weuyrt and killed nigh twenty thousand  men with a force
of mighty  giants. The last  of the scouts  of the north  called Azzar
returned to Caahah seven  suns ago with the news. He  also said that a
great  host  has  crossed  over  the Voidland  into  Ruirse  and  they
advance on  Caahah. They may  have arrived even  now and a  battle may
be at hand."
    "The  news you  bring is  not unknown  to us  for there  have been
other scouts that have  told us the same. In any case  the army of the
enemy  has not  come this  way, or  by the  path to  the north  of the
Hills, for  we have scouts there  that travel here every  day and have
not seen  or heard  anything unusual.  They have  gone either  back to
Weuyrt or East to  the Little Kingdom if they have  not come to Caahah
- that I can assure you."
    "This  is for  the most  part good  news," said  Ceda. "I  must go
now. Thank you for the information. What is your name?"
    "I am  called Aesl. Farewell, and  ride north if your  way permits
for the south is unsafe at all times of the sun and the moon."
    "Farewell," answered  Ceda as he  remounted Melgon and  rode forth
down the rode towards Pheeng'Am.

    It was  three days until  he reached  Pheeng'Am. The City  was now
well  fortified with  many guards  and warriors.  Some men  from No-Al
Ben  were present  and were  many from  the country  of Caffthorn.  As
Ceda entered the  city, the sun was just setting  over the white sands
to the west.
    The next  morning Ceda  was on  his dragon  mount riding  into the
age old  desert. The  sky was blue  and the gem  was white,  though no
sign of trouble  had aroused Melgon or come to  Ceda's attention. They
rode with  great speed  through the  desert as  the sun  became hotter
heating the  sands in turn  making the air  dry and unsavory  to their
parched throats.
    Night came  rapidly and  the sun sank  between two  towering dunes
that stretched  up before them as  they rode westward. They  still had
no sign of  trouble aside from the gems white  warning so Ceda decided
to continue  on into  the night  reasoning that it  would be  far less
dangerous and far more comfortable without the light or the heat.
    After a  few more  hours ride  they pulled to  an abrupt  stop and
Ceda rolled  of of Melgon's back  on to the cooling  white sands. They
slept until some time  into the next morning when the  sun, high up in
the sky, finally gathered enough heat to wrench them from their sleep.

    Two days  later Ceda reached  the area that  he had last  seen the
tree almost  a year before.  The ground  looked no different  than any
other place  on the desert  floor and mounds  of sand rose  all around
him.  He searched  all day  for the  tree, walking  in a  small radius
from where  he first stood and  then slowly moving outward.  He was in
a  hurry for  it was  nearly nine  full days  since Ceda  had departed
Caahah.  Searching until  the sun  had completely  dropped out  of the
sky he finally gave up and went to sleep.
    The next  morning he  was up  with the sun  and riding  in circles
hoping to  come across the tree  that day. By noon  he was discouraged
and tired. The  tenth day was upon  them and Ceda had  still not found
it. Finally  he gave  up trying to  find the tree  in that  manner. He
mounted Melgon and rode  up and down the larger mounds  in the area in
hope of  spotting the tree  in that manner as  the day drew  on. While
searching,  his  thoughts  drifted  back  to  Caahah.  The  army  from
Arnmere must have come  by now; If they had, he  though, then the Lost
Army would  be of no  help to  them by the  time they would  reach the
city that lay  nigh two hundred miles east. If  they had indeed turned
back to  the caves  being content  with the  victory over  Weuyrt then
they would  not need  the Army, but  still, it would  be good  to have
the help of such  an ally. If however, the forces  of Arnmere had gone
to the Little  Kingdom first then they would have  already defeated it
and have come  to Caahah out of  the west, and if they  had gone south
to Dhernis  then they  would have  reached it  before the  seventh sun
falling after Ceda's departure.
    He searched most  of the day and  by the time the  sun had dropped
in the western  sky he was tired, hot and  near desperate. Fear rested
on  him like  a heavy  weight on  his heart  as he  constantly thought
about  his friends  and allies  that he  left behind  in the  possibly
doomed city. along  with that fear rested the burden  of the crown and
the chance of  being found by a group  of Orcs that may be  out in the
desert.  Suppose there  were some  at  the tree,  waiting, to  protect
their  future by  stopping the  Army's return?  If that  was so,  then
there was surely a great force at the tree.

    The  moon came  out and  Ceda dropped  of Melgon's  back onto  the
white sands.  His thoughts drifted again  to the east and  the City of
Caahah. He  wondered if  it was still  there or if  the forces  of the
enemy  had gone  to the  Port of  Dhernis instead.  Perhaps they  went
passed  Caahah  and then  came  from  the east  to  the  fair city  of
Bilfneuin.  'I  have  failed,'  he  thought.  'No  matter  what  their
destination  they will  reach  it long  before I  ever  even find  the
accursed tree.'
    He reclined  onto his  back and  looked up at  the rising  moon. A
strong wind  was blowing and  some of the sand  blew up and  his face.
He brushed  it off and  sat up. The breeze  had moved something  on to
his chest but  it took a moment  before his tired eyes  could focus on
the object.  Before him was a  greenish brown leaf. Ceda  looked at it
in wonder before it occurred to him where it had come from.
    "Melgon!" He shouted. "Lift your weary head and your body too!"
    Melgon growled  in a low voice  and rose. Ceda jumped  to his back
and  pulled his  reins  so he  faced into  the  desert wind.  "Onward!
there is still a hope!"
    They moved  slowly down  the hill  that they were  on and  came to
two small  dunes at  the bottom.  They continued  on between  them and
arrived in  a small shielded  area. mounds were  on three of  the four
sides, but  not tall enough  to block the sight  of a large  man. Just
enough  to stop  roving eyes  from spying  out the  small growth  that
lived therein.
    Melgon would  go no  further so  Ceda dropped  from his  mount and
approached. He looked  at it in amazement for it  had not changed from
the last time he saw it - not in the slightest way.
    "I may  not have failed, Melgon  of Cergaan! We will  wait for the
morrow and then we  shall find the Lost Army. We  will bring them back
into our world in  the beginning of the new day  to mark the beginning
of the new era that shall come with them! I have not failed!"

    Day  was  coming  and  that  would be  a  relief.  The  Enemy  had
attached  with sudden  ferocity eight  days  after Ceda  had left  the
walls of Caahah.
    Aroth  stood next  to Threythus  and Ballison  as the  watched the
battle  progress  from   the  palace  tower.  There   were  more  foul
creatures outside the gates than any had ever seen before.
    The Nuadrin were  the worst. They fought with  tridents, black and
deadly. They  did not tire  and they were  fearless, or so  it seemed.
They fought  like wild starving animals  would over a small  morsel of
food; such  was their vigor and  might, and in their  dark eyes burned
a hole of an unquenchable hatred.
    Aroth's  Elves  sat  along  the  battlements;  their  bows  aimed,
poised in  a slightly tilted position  as they shot arrow  after arrow
into the horde  of wild Orcs that constantly bombarded  the walls with
their own  bodies in effort to  climb over. One after  another another
fell dead  as did the  Nuadrin and many  other horrid beasts  when the
slender arrows  pierced their weak armor,  but it did not  help; there
were too many to defeat that way.
    Threythus drew  a mighty  horn to  his lips and  winded it  with a
great blow.  It was heard  all over the city,  the signal to  open the
gates and let  our troops out to  fight on open ground.  The Orcs were
razing the wall and had to be stopped.
    The  great  ringing  of  the horn  finally  ceased  and  Threythus
lowered  it from  his wrinkled  mouth and  reattached it  to his  bent
side.  His face  was sorrowful  and  disbelief rested  heavily in  his
tired eyes as he watched the battle.
    With  the final  note of  the horn  the gates  opened in  a mighty
clamor crushing  several Orcs under  the awesome weight. Then  a great
cheer arose  as many angry Axemen  stormed over the battered  door and
cut like a hot  knife into the ranks of the enemy as  Orcs fell on all
sides with hideous screams.

    The odor  that they brought  with them was perhaps  their greatest
ally. The smell  consumed men's minds as they fought.  It slowed their
reflexes and weakened  the spirit. Some of the weaker  men fell to the
to  the ground  unable to  move or  think as  a result.  And the  odor
stayed  not  on  the  battle  field. It  drifted  all  over  the  city
bringing with  it fear to the  women and children that  hid, sheltered
in the interior of oppidan.
    Through  the stench  of the  enemy troops  came other  smells. The
smell  of men,  drenched in  sweat from  the heat  of battle,  and the
smell  of bodies.  Many  dead bodies  that lay  piled  in large  heaps
where they fell.
    Blood covered the  fields outside the wall, both  from the enemy's
troops and from the  men. It ran from the necks  and the severed limbs
down  into the  ditches forming  small pools  and streams.  Streams of
pure  blood  running through  the  trenches  outside the  city  gates.
Dammed in  places by  the dead that  filled it as  they fell  to their
end, it  made puddles  that rose as  high as ones  knees. Some  of the
wounded that  were unable to  move as a result  of the noisome  air or
an  injury  also fell  here  and  drowned  in these  puddles.  Others,
wounded or afraid,  hid beneath the murky thickness of  the red liquid
when sought by an enemy blade until the immediate danger had passed.
    The Axemen fought  on, but to them it seemed  ludicrous. For every
Orc that fell dead  there were ten more to take  its place. Slowly the
number  of men  left  alive on  the field  decreased.  And those  that
remained with  their axes  in hand  swung madly  at the  terror before
them and became tired.
    Threythus blew  into his horn again  and the gate fell  open. Into
it  came  a  great  many  wounded  men  and  some  that  had  remained
unscathed.  With them  came  a rush  of Orcs.  Before  they had  again
closed the metal  doors to the city, nigh seventy  beasts had entered,
but were slain quickly by the Elven archers on the walls.
    The battle  raged half  the night before  the enemy  troops pulled
back from the  walls to regroup and rest. Some  Orcs remained near the
city to search  through the remains though they lived  not a long time
so close to the walls of the city.
    Aroth and  Threythus left Ballison  in the tower as  the descended
the long  steps to the streets  of Caahah. They walked  around talking
with the men  while trying to comfort them and  spread enthusiasm, but
could not. The next day could be the end of the city and all knew it.
    Many lay  dead in the  streets after having limped  uselessly back
into the  city or having  been carried in by  a friend when  the gates
were  reopened. Women  and  children  sat in  dark  corners and  cried
softly  to themselves  over the  body of  a dead  relative or  friend.
Most of the people  were unable to talk, the lumps  that rose in their
neck seemed almost  large enough to choke them as  the tears welled in
their grief  stricken eyes  dripping slowly down  their sad  faces and
falling to an end before their huddle bodies.
    Despite  the  general  atmosphere,  the  Axemen  and  the  men  of
Caffthorn  remained  cheerful.  They   sat  together  and  talked  and
laughed.  Most of  them were  not hurt,  and those  that were  did not
seem  to be  greatly moved  by it.  Some of  them were  dead, and  for
those a  toast at their  meal and bowed  heads seemed the  only lament
by their friends. These men loved war and hated the Orcs.
    Dawn came  and the enemy drew  near the city walls.  This time the
Axemen  and men  of Caffthorn  fought side  by side.  They opened  the
gates as  soon as the enemy  was within bow  shot of the city  and out
sped nigh  five thousand men,  all well rested  with food and  wine in
their  bellies. They  charged right  into the  ranks of  the advancing
horde and killed many within the first few moments.

    But  then came  the  giants  of Weuyrt.  Like  great thunder  they
poured  from the  back  ranks  of the  unorganized  surge of  horrible
beasts,  tearing  the  up  the  field  before  the  walls.  The  other
creatures  moved aside  to  let the  giants pass  as  the great  horde
tramped by in an angry onslaught.
    The Axemen  pulled back  slightly as  the giants  approached. They
were big in size and numbers, there were over one thousand of them.
    Finally  they  reached  the  front. The  men  off  Caffthorn  were
crushed before their  might and many fell. Elves that  lined the walls
shot many  desperate arrows at the  towering giants, and some  of them
fell  dead, but  most of  the  arrows fell  to the  ground failing  to
pierce the thick skin and armor of the beasts.
    Threythus was  up in the  tower watching the battle  with Ballison
and saw  the giants  attack. He  looked to the  King of  Caffthorn and
lowered his head. "I  sense that this night will see  the death of the
kings of  Ruirse and Caffthorn.  If the battle  does not turn  soon, I
shall give  the order to  withdraw to the city  walls and try  to hold
off the giants from here."
    "Yes," replied  Ballison. "I  believe that may  be our  only hope.
But remember, it IS a hope."

    The  battle  raged and  the  men  of  Caffthorn were  beaten  down
before might  of the giants.  Many lay dead  on the field  among those
that had fallen the day before. Finally there was a signal.
    A deep and mellowed  blast filled the ears of all  in the city. It
sounded in  every room  and every hall  and up the  tower. It  was low
pitched and rang long  in the ears of Men and  Elves. Then it subsided
and  all looked  up in  wonder, for  the horn  had not  come from  the
tower but from far to the south on the road from Dhernis.
    The  Kings  turned  their  attention from  the  battle  and  gazed
southward past  the sheltered walls.  Not far  off down the  road were
many  torches. They  burned  brightly  in the  morning  sky and  moved
quickly over the land  up the road to the field.  Bearing the first of
the torches came Rackins  of The City of Elves. Next  to him was Merth
on  his right  followed  by  several other  Elves.  Left  of him  came
Azzar, tall next to  the Elves, and proud. Next to  Azzar came a stout
figure, he  was shorter  than all  that walked beside  him and  he was
neither Elf or Human.  His name was Rekrovax, and he  was the ruler of
the Dwarf  Kingdom of  Balmoth on the  southern continent  of Cergaan.
Azzar  had made  it to  the  southern continent  and with  him he  had
brought back a  mighty force of fighters. Threythus  smiled to himself
and looked  at Ballison.  "All is  not lost," he  said, "the  wind may
change to any direction no matter how hard the gusts seem to blow."
    Immediately things  began to  change. The  Orcs withdrew  from the
area  near the  wall and  turned their  full attention  to the  forces
that  came up  from the  south. The  Men of  Caffthorn regained  their
vigor and  with a loud battle  cry they surged forward  into the horde
of giants  killing many in  their angry  wrath and new  strength. They
laughed loudly  as they  slew the  huge creatures  throwing themselves
into  the retreating  force headlong  with their  swords cutting  deep
into the fat bodies of the massive giants.
    Many of  the Orcs were now  in battle with the  armies of Cergaan.
It took  a heavy  toll on  their numbers  and they  soon were  few and
week. By  evening there  were few  remnants left  of the  great muster
from Arnmere  but for the  most part  they were destroyed.  Those that
remained  had  fled into  the  woods  but  were  later killed  by  the
Caahahian scouts and patrols that swept the countryside.
    After the  battle as the sun  was rising the army  finally entered
the  city. They  were  greeted  by loud  shouts  and  cheers from  all
around and were treated with honor.
    The night had  hidden their numbers, but later  they reported nigh
thirty  thousand  troops.  Fifteen  thousand  Dwarfs  of  Balmoth  and
another Fifteen thousand warriors from City of Elves.
    That night  all the bodies  of the  dead enemy were  burned before
the  gates of  the  city.  Their weapons  and  armor  were melted  and
poured  onto parts  of the  wall  that were  broken making  a new  and
stronger barrier.

    The  next evening,  a meeting  was held  in the  tower. Merth  and
Rackins were  there as were  Rekrovax, Ballison, Aroth  and Threythus.
They met  in one  of the  lofty chamber  that near  the zenith  of the
mighty structure.
    The  room they  were in  was large  despite its  thin and  slender
appearance from outside.  In it there were windows facing  in the four
major  directions  and  many  chairs  and  couches  lined  the  richly
decorated  walls. Tables  were laid  out with  food and  drink and  as
they ate they had a long overdue council.
    Merth  began. He  was seated  by one  of the  windows looking  out
westward  over the  lush  green fields  of  the Ruirsian  countryside.
"Where is  Ceda of No-Al  Ben? I  must see him  at once; he  should be
present here."
    "He has left  us. Aroth returned with a marshal  from Leafholm and
two  of the  southern  ports.  With them  they  brought  the Crown  of
Grobst D'arbo  for they had recovered  it in spoils after  a battle in
the Desert of  the Hidden Army. Ceda  took the Crown with  him when he
left for he seeks the Lost Army."
    "He  seeks the  Army?! What  folly sent  him on  such an  errand?"
cried Merth turning around and facing Threythus with sudden anger.
    "We knew  that there would be  an attack by the  forces of Arnmere
and when we  received the crown, we thanked Sarve  and sent the Chosen
Traveler to  seek the tree  and find the  Lost Army. Aye,  the profacy
shall  come true!"  said Ballison  clenching his  fist, "and  the Army
shall complete its task. So should the world be!"
    Merth  lowered his  head into  his hands.  His temperament  was of
great sorrow.  "I have feared this  would happen!" he moaned.  "But it
was as  the warning said:  'He shall seek the  tree and find  it'. You
have done a great service to those of Arnmere."
    "What is  there to fear?"  said Aroth. "So  the Lost Army  will be
found and  the Dark Mountains  of the  south shall be  conquered! What
are your thoughts, wise Wizard of the City of Elves?"
    "Ileiruon laughs even now,  but it is too late to  stop what is to
be. I advise you  all, and it is a fool that turns  my advise away, to
call  for  your armies  and  have  them  come  together at  some  well
fortified place,  for the lost army  shall return, but it  will not be
what you expect."  Merth turned his gaze back westward  and looked out
over the  fields. "A great  danger is soon in  the coming, and  no man
or child will be save ere it is dealt with."
    All looked  at the Elf for  a moment before anyone  spoke. "Merth,
my  faithful  servant, tell  us  of  what you  speak,  for  we do  not
understand your warnings," said Rackins at length.
    "Yes,"  said Merth.  "I... I  must-"  he stopped.  "Why?" he  said
closing  his  eyes.  "The  evil   comes,"  he  continued.  "They  will
not...-" He  reopened his eyes  and looked to Ballison  and Threythus.
"I have  just spoken  with One  who knows.  Send messengers  and bring
your remaining  soldiers and  the rest  of your men  here, or  to some
other  stronghold. Send  your women  and your  children away,  Dhernis
would be the safest place for them. Do it now, before it is too late!"
    Rackins looked in astonishment at Merth, "In Tavaar's name, why?!"
    "Ceda has  found the tree  and the Great  Army will return  to our
world by the morn!"
    "And for this  we must bring our remaining  peoples here?" laughed
Ballison. "Perhaps your wise wizard is feeling the torment of age?"
    "The Army is not of men." said Merth. "They are Nuadrin!"
    Ballison looked  at Merth in  astonishment and then  turned toward
Threythus. "Can this be? How could the tales be changed so?"
    "Over the  years they have been  manipulated by Ones who  know and
would have  things different if they  could; and now they  have." said
Merth apathetically. He  seemed dazed as if he were  not totally aware
of where  he was. He  looked nervously around  the room and  then back
out over the see of green fields beyond the western wall of the city.
    "Is there  a chance  of stopping  Ceda, or is  it too  late?" said
Aroth. "I shall make for the desert at once-"
    "Ceda has found  the tree. The Army will be  recalled and you will
not even have  gotten to Nen ere  their heavy feet make  prints in the
soft white sands of Greyboren," said Merth.
    "Then they are  only twelve days march from the  city! We have not
the  time  to bring  our  people  here!"  cried Ballison.  "They  must
travel through the desert ere they can come to this place!"
    "Aye,  perhaps you  are right,"  said  Merth. "But  there is  more
time  that. The  Army will  not know  that they  have ever  been gone.
They will  think they  are still  in the  past and  will march  to the
Twin Fortresses  before going anywhere  else. It is wise  for Rakine's
people and  those of Bilfneuin,  Naz'Clow and Breanduin to  remove and
come here  or to where they  might find safe shelter  if Caahah falls.
The port  of Dhernis should  be left  populated, for those  who escape
may take  ship and  depart for  Cergaan. For  that reason,  Leaders of
the  southern continent,  I bid  you not  call more  warriors to  this
place. They will not make the journey in time."
    Rekrovax gripped  his sword.  "I shall  do as  you ask,  though my
people  shall  stay  here with  you.  We  do  not  run and  shall  die
defending your city ere we leave for Dhernis in disgrace!"
    "As will we!" agreed both Rackins and Ballison.
    "Good, then  let us send messengers  to our peoples and  have them
come here  or do  what they  will, and  let us  turn our  attention to
preparing  for  the  return  of  the  Army  that  was  Lost  and  then
Re-found!" answered  Merth in a  sudden vigor. "Ceda carries  with him
Renielk,  Axe  of Caffthorn,  and  instead  of  falling the  tree,  he
brings it to life!"

    The night  was wearing  away but  Ceda could  still not  sleep. He
rolled onto  his back and then  back to his  side. It was cool  in the
desert after the  sun fell. He fingered the crown  running his fingers
across  the silk-like  interior. The  Malthoogian Jewels  glowed under
his covers and Renielk lit the area with its strong white glow.
    He lay the  rest of the night  starring up at the  dark sky. There
were no  clouds and the  stars shone  above him in  strange brilliance
but the tree and the crown dominated his thoughts.
    Melgon did  not sleep that night  either but lay beside  Ceda with
both of  his red eyes open.  They moved slowly, searching  up and down
the  landscape before  him peering  into darkened  moors unilluminated
by the brightness of the stars or moon, for signs of danger.
    Finally the stars  faded into the sky  of the new day  as the pale
light of  dawn filled the desert  revealing the white sands  to Ceda's
tired eyes.  "Well," said Ceda  rising and turning toward  Melgon. "We
have waited for more  than ten suns falling and only  with the luck or
Tavaar will  we bring the  army before there  is an attack  on Caahah,
but let us delay no more."
    He rose  taking the crown  in one hand  and Renielk in  his other.
The tree  was still as he  approached it. He neared  cautiously taking
slow  and careful  steps  fearing  the wrath  of  the  king or  sudden
attack  of any  Endillonions, but  none  came. Presently  he stood  in
front  of  the growth.  It  seemed  to  change  slightly as  Ceda  had
approached  and looked  proud  and possessive  of  some hidden  energy
despite its distorted appearance.
    Ceda  turned  and   looked  at  Melgon  who  had   backed  away  a
considerable  distance.  "Crown  the   King,  and  he  shall  rise..."
recited  Ceda.  "I  have a  notion,  though  I  doubt  it is  what  is
required of  me. If  the King  was mutated  to this  tree, then  he is
still the king. Aye Melgon?"
    The  dragon took  another step  backwards.  "Of all  the beasts  I
tame it has to  be a wingless and mute coward!"  said Ceda jokingly to
Melgon as he turned again toward the tree.
    "Tavaar's luck  be upon  us," he  said. Taking  the crown  in both
hands and fastening  his axe to his  back, he reached up  and stood on
the tips  of his  feet straining  to reach the  highest of  the wasted
branches.  His fingers  raised the  crown even  further and  stretched
them over  the tree's top  finally placing it  on a single  branch. He
then relaxed his body and stepped back.
    Immediately the  ground began to shake.  The gem on his  back took
on new  brightness rivalling the desert  sun and burned fiercely  in a
great white aura.  Ceda staggered backwards until  stopped by Melgon's
tremendous grey  body and leaned  there watching the desert  area that
lay before him.
    Rents  opened up  in  the  ground and  deep  holes  that led  into
darkness  dominated the  desert floor.  Mounds of  white sand  drained
into  the gaps  changing the  area radically  before the  Traveler and
his mount.  Great explosions  burst forth from  the newly  formed pits
of  the desert  blowing  dark  and noisome  smoke  high  into the  air
followed  by  high spurts  of  fire.  A  constant rumbling  noise  was
evident shaking the very foundations of the land beneath their feet.
    Then the gapping  holes began to close as suddenly  and as fast as
they  had  appeared.  As  they  drew shut,  the  edges  brought  dusty
figures with them, covered with sand and completely motionless.
    Soon  the desert  was silent  and  before Ceda  were thousands  of
relit campfires.  A few horses stood  near him and the  closest of the
figures  was  nigh  four  dragons lengths  away.  They  were  Nuadrin.
Slowly they  began to  stir. The  sand that had  covered them  fell to
the ground and was lost in the sea of white grains.
    Ceda was  astounded. Neither he or  Melgon were able to  move, the
shock of  the fifty thousand  Nuadrin had  taken its toll.  The beasts
looked up  at the sky  as they  regained consciousness. They  too were
aghast and  for a moment  were dubious as  to what was  happening, but
that moment  wore quickly  away. Those  that regained  their awareness
quickly noticed  Ceda standing near  the kings fire. Leaping  to their
feet with a fierce ululation they bounded quickly toward him.
    Grobst  arose and  looked around  him.  His face  was hideous  and
cruel and his expression  the same. He too saw Ceda  and sprang at him
with a merciless cry.
    Ceda regained control  of himself and turned  quickly leaping onto
Melgon's back.  "Arnea seek Duval!  Ride!" he shouted. "Ride  with the
speed of your lost wings! Ride! RIDE!"
    Melgon wasted  no time.  He leapt  forward at  an amazing  pace as
his gargantuan  claws bit deeply  into the  desert sand throwing  up a
shield  of dust  behind  them. Fear  held him  and  Ceda and  weighted
heavily in their minds.
    "Ride!"  shouted Ceda  again,  shaking the  reins forcefully.  "We
must reach Caahah with the coming of the fifth sun falling! RIDE!"
    Leaving the  great army  behind they leapt  over hills  wasting no
time while they had  energy left to go on. Behind  them was the Grobst
D'arbo,  the Desert  of Greyboren  lay before  him, and  great worldly
changes were happening.

    D'arbo stopped  short. The  dragon and its  rider had  gotten away
and  were now  beyond his  reach. A  strong looking  Nuadri approached
him from behind, "Father, I shall go personally and slay him!"
    "Nay, Tondrux,"  said Grobst. "Let  the foul Dragon-rider  go. Let
him warn the  Twin Fortresses of their  peril, or die if  he meets the
scout we sent forth."
    "Ileiruon  will be  pleased, father,"  said Tondrux.  Then looking
up at the morning  sky he said, "I am worried, how came  it to be day?
And how did the Dragon-rider come so close without being noticed?"
    "Of this, I  have not an answer, perhaps Ileiruon  or those of our
allies in  Endillion will  give us a  sign. For now,  let us  rest and
this evening we shall march."

                         Sir Lyoyn of the Pale

                       In the Land of the Yellows
                         The Tumescent Spleens,
                      With their plumage displayed
                       Flashing violet and green,
                        Would go prancing about
                      With their toes in the air,
                     They would hem and they'd haw
                     Giving strangers their glare.

                    And the stout Knight of Fuschia,
                         Sir Lyoyn of the Pale,
                      Heard tales of their manners
                        From Annwara the Frail,
                       Who had ventured one morn
                          In the slippery dew,
                      Picking lotus and mandrake,
                           A Persephone two;

                         So the earth opened up
                       And Big Earth Hog came out
                          And lo he did laugh
                          And Annwara, shout.
                          The force of her cry
                     Would have quickened the dead,
                    But the spleens hemmed and hawed
                       And glared slowly instead.

                      The Hog snatched her up fast
                        And He dragged her below
                         To his den in the Dirt
                     With no spittoons or clothes;
                       Where the tale of her stay
                        Is too lengthy to tell,
                       And it's sordid and grimy
                        And it's boring as hell.

                        But a true party lizard
                         Aided Annwara's flight
                      And they swarmed up a ladder
                       In the wee hours of night;
                     And the lizard, named Brutus,
                        Showed Annwara the path,
                         And stayed to impolden
                       The Big Earth Hog's wrath.

                     While she stumbled and crawled
                      Through the thistles and mud
                         The exsatchous Spleens
                 Flapped their cheeks and said, "Chud."
                      Which meant in their tongue,
                     "Oh you graceless young fool,"
                       "Go on back to your pots"
                       "And your Pasta Fa-Zool."

                      A Spleen elder named Bloost
                     Kicked behind her frail knees
                         And tugged at her hair
                       And forced her to sneeze.
                       The whole flock abused her
                         With effultent spite,
                     While the Hog chewed up Brutus
                        With one Big Earth Bite.

                       Brutus cried lizard tears,
                     Sliding down the Hog's throat,
                            As Annwara fell
                         To the back of a stoat
                         Which quick flew away;
                       While she blessed her luck
                       The Big Earth Hog stomped
                         And swore in his muck.

                          Now safe and secure
                        In the Fuschia stockade,
                            Annwara related
                           Her sad serenade.
                    And the stout Knight of Fuschia,
                         Sir Lyoyn of the Pale,
                      Summoned up all his courage
                         Within barrels of ale.

                       And he took up his armor,
                       And his trusted old lance,
                      And strapped on his shield,
                         And girded his pants,
                         And armored his beast,
                       Growing old in the stable,
                         And mounted its back,
                        Straight as he was able.

                          He gallumphed along
                      To the Land of the Yellows,
                      And the Spleens gave a glare
                       And shouted and bellowed,
                      And charged him hands high,
                    And called out "Soouuuiiiieeee!"
                       His war-beast spun 'round,
                          Proceeding to flee.

                       The Big Earth Hog appeared
                         And started to snort,
                     The Spleens threw their spears
                     At stout Sir Lyoyn for sport,
                       The stout Knight regretted
                              His naivete,
                          And made an attempt
                          At a prompt getaway;

                     But the Spleens and their Lord
                      Were too bold for the Knight
                     And they knocked him out cold,
                     And they wrapped him up tight.
                     For the stout Fuschia Knight,
                      Though a fierce looking foe,
                       From indulgence, in stout,
                      Had become, soft, as dough.

                       Not the spotted old armor,
                       Nor the trusted old lance,
                      Nor the fearless old shield,
                       Nor suspenders with pants,
                     Helped the drunken old knight.
                       With the meaty war-beast,
                      The Big Earth Hog baked him,
                      And the Spleens had a feast.

                       In the old Castle Fuschia,
                        Annwara ope'd the gates,
                      And she sold all the silver,
                      And she sold all the plates;
                       And the ancestral jewels,
                    With their fabled, rare stones,
                      She stole from the caskets,
                       Stripping ancestral bones.

                    Then she called her old friends
                      And the Spleens came to see,
                      With the Big Earth Hog, they
                       Split the money in three;
                        They went on their ways,
                       And she traveled the land,
                      Growing rich, for old fools
                          Were always at hand.

                     Spirit of the Wood: Chapter 5

                                 Loric
    Loric floated just  above himself. There was  a warmth surrounding
him  and a  buzzing in  his  ears. An  eternity later  is seemed,  the
buzzing resolved itself  into speech. His eyes came into  focus and he
stared long at  the canopy of trees  above him trying to  decide if he
was above  or below them, and  when someone walked around  the edge of
his vision, he knew  that he had not gone to the  Spirit as he thought
he should have. Something must have held him back...
    'It  must have  been the  Teline,' Loric  thought disjointedly  to
himself, 'How else can it be that I have died and yet I still see?'
    The tendrils  of the Devatha have  released me. I see  many of the
Downlanders... their dead  brown faces holding masks  of mourning. The
wailing of the women is loud but I can not move to cover my ears!
    I  see Dernhelm  dispatch the  Devatha  with a  single stroke.  He
breaks the horn  from it's head stalk  and I am surprised  to see that
it is dry and hollow inside.
    He  blows  the  call of  loss  thru  it  and  is anwsered  in  the
village. DEE-ath!  DEE-ath! I do not  want to be dead!  I shake myself
hard to show him I am alive but my body doesn't move.
    Look at  me uncle!  I live!  I saved the  kesh-blade of  my father
from  the Pit.  It's there  on  the ground  at your  feet! Two  masked
villagers come  and lift me  up. I  am moved but  I cannot move.  I do
not feel their grip on my arms and legs.
    The   sound  of   Bullroarers   announces  our   arrival  in   the
Village-under-the  Trees.  They  lay  me  on  dried  rushes  among  my
friends. I  get a  glimpse of  Jakul and Hiram  both with  matted hair
and covered with a  light blue clay. Were they in the  Pit too, I want
to ask,  or some other  trial? I want  to cry but  my eyes are  a dead
man's: they will not cry for me now.
    I try to  look away but my eyes  will not close. All I  can see is
the sky  and the  treetops. Did I  do well? What  are they  doing now?
The Village is so  quiet. Have they all left us here  for the birds to
find? Did we shame our families and they are refusing our bodies?
    I  can hear  Dernhelm talking,  but  his words  are unclear.  He's
mumbling  something  and  the Downlanders  are  responding.  Chanting.
Mumble memble chant mumble mumble memble.
    Ah!  Now I  see him  at the  edge of  my eyes.  He's leaning  over
Jakul.  There's his  father  Koonial--what are  the  doing with  those
switches- -They're striking his body!
    Koonial turns  to Dernhelm and says  "He is dead, my  son is dead,
the tribe has lost  a hand." Behind him I can see  a long, somber line
of  villagers.They all  have switches.  Each strike  Jakul's body  and
then toss the switch on top of him.
    Now Dernhelm's  moves to  Hiram. Hiram's  mother Joulin  is coming
with  his sister  Teelan helping  her. She  hasn't walked  alone since
the night the nets fell on her and took her husband and my father.
    My  Father! Who  will  come for  me?  There is  none  to show  the
Downlanders  I am  dead! My  father died  on the  nets, my  sister had
left to  seek her  own song and  Oldsir had his  second vision  and is
with the Spirit  of the Wood now. I  wonder if they will hang  me in a
tree or plant me  among the Adinase so that Eidie can  come and ask my
spirit who should dance for whom?
    Now Dernhelm is  giving Joulin the switch. She's  hitting Hiram on
the head,  the chest, and  the legs. I see  little puffs of  blue dust
each time  she hits. Are you  dead Hiram? Was your  song strong enough
to join the Spirit of the Wood or are you there, trapped like I am?
    "My chief, my son is dead, the village has lost a hand."
    Teelan is  in line behind  her, she's  smiles as she  strikes, the
switch sings it's  pain path each time. Ah, Teelan,  If you had danced
for  me before  I died  I would  have been  a strong  father for  your
children and  eased the days  of your  mother...and I would  teach you
not to strike my friends so hard, even if that friend is your brother.
    Dernhelm is  looking at  me now.  He's going to  hit me.  I should
have guessed!  My uncle is  the only Tolorion  left in the  Village. I
try to feel  the pain but it  isn't there, the world has  gone to fog.
One ,two ,three!  I am dead! Is  that my blood on the  switch? How can
I bleed?
    "My brother's son is dead, the village has lost a hand."
    Pyres!  I  understand  now,  thought Loric,  feeling  distant  and
uncaring  of  the living  world,  they  mean  to  burn me!  Thank  you
Dernhelm, thank  you my  chief! I  will be  free to  go to  the Spirit
now, thank you....

                                Dernhelm
    For a  moment Dernhelm  thought he saw  his nephew's  mouth twitch
like he  was coming  back from  the dead. His  open, glazed  eyes were
disconcerting  in the  torch-light. If  the boy  came to  life now  it
would look bad. The ceremony must be finished.
    With a frown  he leaned down and closed Loric's  eyes and motioned
for the  Speaker-for-animals to come  forward. The Speaker  howled and
growled and  hissed a  song of  mourning for the  fallen boys  and for
the many  animals that would not  feast on their catch  this day. Then
he jumped from  pile to pile snorting flames from  his nostrils to set
the dry rushes aflame.
    Dernhelm  grimly  watched  the  switches  pop  and  smoke  darkly.
Waiting until  the right moment to  signal the final passage  from the
death of a boy to the life of a man.
    Finally when the  flames all but obscured the bodies  and he could
smell the  hair begin  to singe, he  blew on the  horn of  the Devatha
three short bursts.
    He smiled  cynically as the  pyres collapsed in on  themselves. He
knew that  under the  supports the  boys were  being wrapped  in hides
and coated  with healing  salves. He  turned to  lead a  procession of
Downlanders to  the river where  they would  keen and smite  the water
and call upon the Spirit to receive the boys with favor.
    There  were rush  boats  to be  built, octli  to  be consumed  and
tales to  be told all night  long. Later, after the  elders had joined
them he  would leave  quietly to  care for  Loric's 'body'.  After the
boy had  been sealed in  a caul  and left for  the Spirit to  care for
him, I can look forward to a quiet turn of the moon.
    The boy  was too much  like his Grandfather  to come back  after a
day or  two with  only a  tale of his  death and  of singing  with the
Spirit. He  would actually try  to bring  something to the  village to
help us understand the Spirit of the Wood better.
    Dernhelm's smile  faded as  he passed  into the  trees remembering
when he too  believed the Spirit guarded them. That  was before he had
become chief  and had  revealed to him  the mysteries  that surrounded
every  action the  Downlanders  took  from birth  to  death and  birth
again. When Loric  joined the Spirit he would make  no hearth-fire for
his brother's son--could not, for the Spirit did not move him anymore.

                             Cydric and the Sage
                                 IV. The Sage
    Twilight  had  settled  upon  the  town by  the  time  Cydric  and
Holleena  finished  their meal  of  Simon's  fish  stew and  left  the
docks. The  full moon  was beginning  to rise as  they arrived  at the
house of  Corambis, which  stood at  the far eastern  edge of  the Old
City. As Cydric's black  stallion came to a stop in  front of the gate
of the  iron fence which  enclosed the  front yard, Holleena  slid off
the  horse's back  and said,  "Here you  are, Cydric.  Just go  to the
front door and knock--he is usually home around this time."
    "Wait a moment!  Where are you going?" Cydric called  as she began
to walk away.
    "To my  own home, of  course," Holleena  replied. "It is  not very
far from here."
    Cydric quickly dismounted.  "I should at least  accompany you," he
said. "It is getting dark, and--"
    "I appreciate  your concern, Cydric, but  I will be quite  safe, I
assure you,"  She nodded toward the  house. "You had better  make your
visit now, before he goes to sleep."
    Cydric looked back  at the house, then shrugged.  "Are you certain
you will not need an escort?"
    "Quite certain."
    "Well, then,  I shall not detain  you any longer. I  thank you for
your  kind help,  Holleena--perhaps we  will meet  again sometime,  at
the tavern for instance?"
    "Perhaps," she  replied with a  slight smile. Turning,  she walked
briskly away down the block and disappeared into a side street.
    Cydric led the  black stallion through the iron  gate and tethered
it  to a  nearby hitching  rack. He  paused a  moment, recalling  what
Holleena  had  told  him  about  the  Sage:  He  made  his  living  by
interpreting  dreams and  omens, and  by casting  personal horoscopes.
His practice  earned him  enough gold  to enable him  to have  his own
private booth  in the  marketplace. He was  well known  and respected,
and it was said he possessed all manner of arcane knowledge.
    Casting a  final glance back  at the  horse, Cydric strode  up the
paved path  that led to  the Sage's front  door and knocked.  The door
opened  and a  grey-haired bearded middle-aged man dressed  in a loose
maroon tunic and green trousers peered out. "Yes?"
    "Good evening, sir," Cydric began. "Are you Corambis, the Sage?"
    "I am indeed," the man replied. "How may I be of service?"
    "Well, sir,"  said Cydric in  his most  courtly tone of  voice, "I
am  Cydric  Araesto, of  Baranur,  and  I  have  a certain  matter  to
discuss with you."
    "A  certain matter,  eh? It  must be  of major  import, since  you
have sought me out like this," said the Sage.
    "Your pardon,  sir, I did not  mean to disturb your  rest--I shall
come back tomorrow."
    The Sage  smiled. "No,  no, it  is quite  all right.  Come inside,
young sir, and we shall discuss this matter of yours."
    As  Cydric followed  Corambis into  the house,  he tried  to guess
the  man's  age. Although  he  appeared  to  be nearing  his  sixtieth
summer, the Sage walked with the stride of a man many years younger.
    They  passed through  a  short hallway,  then  entered the  Sage's
small  but  well-furnished  study.  A  bookshelf  containing  rows  of
various  leatherbound  volumes  occupied  the entire  west  wall.  The
north  wall housed  a cold  fireplace; above  the mantle,  the stuffed
head  of a  nighthound glared  down  at them  over a  pair of  crossed
swords.  A bookshelf  also  occupied  the east  wall,  but instead  of
books  it  contained various  small  objects,  the most  prominent  of
which were  a pair of demon's  horns, a bust of  the goddess Cahleyna,
and  the body  of  a  giant leaf-roach  encased  in  a glass  pyramid.
Lastly, an ornately  carved oaken table and three  padded chairs stood
in front of the fireplace.
  Motioning  for  Cydric  to  sit,  Corambis  took a  pair of  tobacco
pipes  from  a  rack  mounted  near the  mantle.  "Smoke?"  he  asked,
offering one to the young man.
    "I thank you,  sir,"he replied. The Sage filled both  pipes from a
pouch that  hung around  his waist,  gave one to  Cydric, then  took a
seat at  the opposite  end of the  table. Cydric took  a sniff  of the
tobacco and noted with delight that it was fine quality Comarian.
    "Fazar!"  Corambis  said  suddenly,   stabbing  a  finger  at  the
fireplace. The  logs burst  into flame,  and at  the same  time Cydric
saw a wisp of smoke curl upwards from the bowl of his pipe.
    "She did not tell me you were a sorcerer," he said with some awe.
    Corambis made  a gesture  of dismissal with  his pipe.  "In truth,
Cydric, my  abilites are no more  that that of minor  conjuror. I have
neither the power nor  the desire to become a full  mage." He paused a
moment, exahling a cloud of smoke. "Who did not tell you, by the way?"
    "A  girl I  met a  Belisandra's Tavern.  She told  me how  to find
your house."
    "Did she  also tell  you that  I only  conduct business  during my
regular time at  the marketplace? But it matters not,  I shall make an
exception in your case."
    "You are most generous, sir," replied Cydric.
    "Indeed,"  said the  Sage. "Well  now, what  is it  that you  have
come all this way to discuss with me?"
    "It  concerns a  vision that  I've  been having  of late,"  Cydric
began.  The Sage  listened intently  as he  described the  golden sea,
the colorless skull, and the carvings in the rock.
    "I've  even made  a sketch."  Cydric  pulled a  roll of  parchment
from the inner pocket  of his cloak and spread it  out over the table.
"This is  what I  saw inscribed  on  the  rock.  When I  compared this
outline to a  map of the continent, I found  that the "x" corresponded
to the  location of Dargon. And  you can see, your  name appears below
the outline."  Cydric paused and looked  up from the table.  "And that
is why I am here. I am hoping you can tell me what this vision means."
    Corambis picked  up the parchment  and stared  at it for  a while,
puffing  on the  pipe and  saying nothing.  Finally, he  stood up  and
moved to  lean against the  mantle of the fireplace.Turning,  the Sage
regarded the young man thoughtfully and said,  "I do  not believe that
I am the one you should be asking."
    Cydric frowned. "Why not? You--"
    "It  is  obvious  that  the person  responsible  for  our  visions
intended for  you to  come to Dargon  and seek me  out. That  much you
have understood."
    Before Cydric  could form his  question the  Sage held up  a hand.
"I shall explain  what I mean." He tossed the  parchment into the fire
and left the room, motioning for Cydric to follow.

                          V. The Message
    Corambis led the  young man into the cellar of  the house. Pausing
in front  of a wine  rack, the Sage uttered  an arcane phrase  and the
rack slid aside to reveal a large well-lit room.
    "My  laboratory,"  he said  with  a  sweep  of  his hand  as  they
entered.  The room  was full  of various  kinds of  equipment, ranging
from alchemistic  set-ups to  animal skeletons in  different states of
assembly.
    "A truly  marvelous collection you  have here," said Cydric  as he
roamed  about  the  room,   eagerly  examining  the  many  fascinating
objects that lay on tables and shelves.
    "Ah, a  student of the arcane,  are you?" the Sage  asked, pleased
with the young man's enthusiasm.
    "I suppose  I am. I've been  fascinated by the works  of Thassalen
the Mystic  ever since I was  a child," replied Cydric  as he examined
a wooden mobile of the World with the surrounding sun and moon.
    The Sage  grinned and  nodded. "Well then,  you will  certainly be
interested in what I have to show you. This way, if you will."
    Cydric  followed the  older  man to  the back  of  the room  where
stood a table, an ebony box atop it. "Open the box," said Corambis.
    Cydric looked  at him suspiciously.  "I thought you were  going to
explain what you were talking about before."
    "The explanation, or part of it, lies within the box. Go ahead."
    The  young man  paused a  moment. Couldn't  be anything  dangerous
inside, he  thought. Shrugging,  he flipped  the lid  back. A  gasp of
surprise  escaped his  lips. Within  the  box was  a life-sized  human
skull, made entirely of crystal. "The skull from the vision! But how?"
    The Sage  closed the box. "I  knew that would get  your interest,"
he grinned.  "Well, this  skull appeared  on my  study room  table one
day several  months ago. That  same night I had  a dream in  which the
skull spoke to  me, telling me that  I would be visited by  a man from
Baranur  who  sought the  meaning  of  a  mysterious vision.  When  he
arrived,  the skull  said, I  was to  speak a  certain incantation  to
receive further instructions."
    "How can you be sure that I am indeed the one?" asked Cydric.
    "I am fairly  certain, since none of my customers  in the last few
months have  had dreams involving skulls.  And I am also  certain that
the  skull's creator  will have  some means  of verifying  its 'chosen
one'," Corambis replied.
    The young  man reflected upon  this for  a moment. "Have  you ever
had that dream more than once?" he asked.
    "Indeed I  have, Cydric. It appears  in my mind at  various times,
much like  your vision, I  would suppose.  In fact, I  experienced the
vision a short time ago, some time before you arrived."
    Cydric  felt a  sudden chill.  "So, our  visions are  connected in
some way to the skull. Have you any idea who sent it?"
    "I know not who sent it but I believe that person to be an Elder."
    "An Elder? What would an Elder want with us?"
    "Well now, Cydric,  the only way to  find out is to  ask him, eh?"
Corambis opened the  box again and took out a  piece of parchment that
lay next  to the skull. "This  is the incantation that  the skull told
me to speak."
    "You're going to read it now?"
    "No  better  time like  the  present."  Corambis squinted  at  the
page,  then began  reading: "'Ghe  farsta  li voyar  etye tavarsta  li
omnae, nechuzar Bahz se khya seke.'"
    They waited.  Nothing happened. "Hmmmm," Corambis  mused. "Perhaps
I mispronounced that last phrase. Let me--"
    A dazzling white  light exploded from the skull,  filling the room
completely.  Both men instinctivly shut their eyes  and threw up their
arms to  block out the blinding brightness.  Before either could
react further, the light ceased as suddenly as it had appeared.
    Cydric slowly  lowered his arms  and peeked  at the skull.  A soft
red glow slo  wly pulsed at its center. "Apparently  you did pronounce
it right," he said.
    "Indeed," said  Corambis, squinting  intently at the  skull. "What
next, I wonder?"
    As if  in response  to the  Sage's question,  the red  glow pulsed
faster until it  became a steady blaze. It expanded  to fill the skull
completely. Then the skull began to speak.
    "Greetings," it  said in a  cold, ethereal  voice. "I bring  you a
message  from Bahz  the  Elder, Seventh  of the  Council  of Eight  of
Zaad'Astropolous, capital  of the  Quentrellian Isle.  He has  need of
your aid,  and is willing to  reward you generously for  your efforts.
You must  travel to  the Citadel  of Sorrows, above  the shore  of the
Sea of  Time, on the  Plane of Tarradan, to  free him from  his unjust
imprisonment. Lest you  think you are being lured into  a trap of some
sort, the Elder  sends you this assurance of his  good faith. A nugget
of  chrysoline, rarest  of all  gemstones. It  shall protect  you from
all  forms  of  hostile  magic,  and  be  your  passport  through  the
StarDoor."  As the  skull spoke,  images formed  within the  red glow.
Cydric saw  a dark-haired  man in  purple robes, then  an island  in a
turquoise sea,  followed by the  image of an imposing  castle situated
on a foundation  of barren rock. The  final image was that  of a small
blue-and-white jewel set in a platinum ring.
    "The Elder urges  that you respond to his appeal,  for his time is
limited. Your  reward will be  very great,  he assures you.  Make your
journey at midnight; the jewel will be your guide."
    A moment  after the  skull finished speaking,  the red  glow began
to  die as  cracks  appeared  in its  crystalline  surface. A  pulsing
sound emanated from  the skull, growing louder with  each beat. Cydric
pressed his  hands over  his ears,  but the  sound still  remained. In
his mind he saw  the skull, small but growing in  size with the volume
of the droning  beat. Suddenly, the skull in the  box shattered into a
cloud of crystalline  dust just as the sound reached  a crescendo. The
skull  in Cydric's  mind loomed  large, filling  his thoughts.  Then a
sharp  pain   stabbed  daggerlike  into   his  soul.  He   cried  out,
staggered,  then collapsed  to the  cold stone  floor. He  was vaguely
aware of  someone calling  his name  as darkness  welled up  and swept
him into unconsciousness.
