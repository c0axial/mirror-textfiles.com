   Well,  greetings,  all!    Another issue of FSFnet has come,   and I'm sure
you'll find  this one  rather refreshing.    Due to  circumstances beyond  our
control,  there is  neither a featured author  or a Narret Chronicles  in this
issue, although both will continue in issue 2-3, with Narret 5 and a column on
Christopher Stasheff,   author of  'The Warlock  in Spite  of Himself',   'The
Warlock Unlocked', 'King Kobald Revived', and 'Escape Velocity'.
   But  this issue  contains some  excellent  works of  fiction,  including  a
wonderful poem  by Jim Owens  (a poem I sympathize  with),  and my  own newest
imaginings  in 'Selection'.    If anyone  who  receives this  is still  having
problems with  the sending  format,  please let  me know.    I'd also  like to
welcome those few  people who have been  added to the mailing  list since May,
and hope that they will continue to spread the word to interested parties.
   Well, enough of the propaganda... on with the show!

                              Man's Best Friends
   "You know John,  the Telrani are man's  best friends.  And there is nothing
you can say that will change my view of them."
   John  Stevenson picked  up his  beer and  resumed drinking  it.  He  stared
blankly at the ring of moisture it left on the bar.
   "I know that they have given us some good things...", he started.
   "Some good things?!?   What about the  De-armatron?  That's more than good,
John.  That's the end of war.  Flick the mother on and Zap!  No weapons,  even
nukes, work! And what about Super-Wheat?  The solution for world hunger. Grows
anywhere. And the cures for all the diseases man has ever known.  I just don't
understand you, John."
   "I know what they've done, Dan. I just have a bad feeling about them.  It's
just too good.   One day a hundred flying  saucers come out of  the sky,  some
aliens get out that  look like Bigfoot,  they say they are  from Rigel and are
here to help us, and Wham! all the world's problems are solved.  I just have a
funny feeling about it."
   Dan took a pull at his drink, set it down and continued.
   "And now they are  offering trips to their home planet.   What a deal!"  So
what if when we get back everyone who knows will be dead or at least a hundred
years old, we're not married, so what do we care?"
   "Yea, but..."
   "No buts about it.  I'm going.  In fact I'm going in just a month.  And get
this, so are you!"
   John,  who was drinking,  suddenly sputtered and splashed beer all over the
bar.
   "What?!?",he yelled,"How come you didn't ask me?  How can we pay for it?  I
don't want to leave Earth forever!"
   "It isn't forever, only for 8 months, our time. It's free, and I didn't ask
you because I know you'd say no. Anyway we're going, so it's settled."
   "No it isn't, but I have to go home, so we'll talk about it tomorrow."
   "See ya, John."
   "Later."

   "Hi Dan! Whatcha lookin so pale for? Are you sick?  Hey bartender, get this
man a drink!"
   "Dan, last night I decided that I might as well go to Rigel with you.  Hey,
I  mean my  'funny  feeling'  is unfounded,   and  there's  no reason  why  we
shouldn't. Right, Dan?"
   Dan sat down, and stared straight ahead.
   "John,  you know  how I taught myself the Telranian  language and alphabet,
even though it's forbidden. Well I finally got a chance to use it.   I found a
Telrani handbook yesterday for sale at a bookstore, and I bought it."
   "But possesion of any Telrani text is illegal!"
   "I know that, but I bought it anyway, just to see if I could read it.   And
I could."
   "Well, what was the book about?"
   "The title was 'How to Serve Man', which they have been doing, right?   The
De-armatron, Super-wheat, free interstellar trips, stuff like that."
   "Yea, so what's wrong?"
   "Well,  I read the first chapter,  and I thought I must have read it wrong,
so I read it again, and I found out I didn't."
   "And?"
   "It isn't a  handbook on how to  help us,  Dear  God John,  it was  a cook-
book!!"

                        All's Well That Ends. Well,...
   The hall was  dark,  but the thief  carried a torch,  and  could see rather
well.  He needed to see,  but  he also knew where to look,  and so his job was
made a little easier.
   He moved his hand across the wall.  It  slid quietly,  and then fell into a
recess.  He edged his hand up and down what appeared to be a slot cut from the
floor to the ceiling.  Near the bottom he found it; a break in the slot, where
the wall seemed uncut.  He held the torch  low.   On the wall beside the break
there was what seemed to be a rectangular metal inlay.  The thief knew better.
He set the torch into a wall bracket, and licked the palm of his hand well. He
then placed his hand, palm first,  against the metal.  He then pulled his hand
away suddenly.  The inlay  moved out just enough for him to get  a grip on it.
He slid it out,  revealing it to be a square steel peg.  He took it and ran it
inside the top of the lower half of the slot. It caught, and he deftly slid it
up and out of sight. It just as easily slid out of the hole when he pulled his
hand away, however. He set it down, and took off his pack. Taking the tent out
of it, he once more inserted the peg. He then tossed the tent onto the floor a
short distance ahead.  The floor sank perceptibly.  The break in the slot also
moved, trying to slide into the wall. The peg caught it, and it stopped.
   The thief crossed the drop-away floor,  leaving behind his tent to hold the
peg in place, for his escape. He had already crossed three such floors, evaded
two patrols,   crossed two revines,  traversed  endless dark halls,   and even
outwitted a maze. If his source was correct, he was now home free.
   His target was a small ceremonial table. It was gold, with gems set in each
corner.  Legend had it that it had never been touched since it had been set in
its place eons ago.   No one had even approached it,  only gazed  on it from a
distance. Now he wanted to take it.
   He walked down the hall. His source had been a priest once, and had studied
this temple. He knew how the traps worked, and what the walls and floors would
look like when a trap was built in. The thief now recognized such a pattern in
the walls. A low ceiling, with square pillar lining the walls. That meant that
the roof would drop on him if he put weight on the center of the floor without
putting weight first on sides near the  walls.  He accordingly edged along the
wall, and was soon past.
   That was the last trap. He turned the corner, and there was the altar room.
Rich furnishings lined the  wall,  but he had eyes only for  the gold table on
the far wall.
   He walked fearlessly forward.  Nothing impeded him  as he went to claim his
prize. He lifted it off its stand, although not without some effort, as it was
very heavy.  He turned,  and staggered down the steps.   He reached the floor,
took  two  steps,  and,   without  warning,   the  floor collapsed  under  the
unaccustomed weight.  The thief fell down to the next floor, which happened to
be the dining hall for all the novices.   He escaped with his life, but, alas,
without his prize,   as the one thing he  had not planned on  was running with
such a great weight.

                         Review: THE COLOUR OF MAGIC
   Terry Pratchett is a British author of several SF short stories and a novel
entitled 'Strata',   available in a Signet  edition.   'The Colour  of Magic',
printed  in England  in  1983,   has recently  been  released  in an  american
paperback edition  by Signet,  and  has been a  main selection of  the Science
Fiction Book Club.
   The book recounts  the adventures shared by "Twoflower,   a naive insurance
salesman turned tourist" and his reluctant native guide, an inept wizard named
Rincewind.   The first of  four short stories in the book  tell of Twoflower's
arrival  in  the corrupt  city  of  Ankh-Morpork.   After  meeting  Rincewind,
Twoflower's  adventures in  the  city,   reminiscent of  Aspirin's  Sanctuary,
culminate in  the destruction of the  city.   The second book  describes their
awakening of  an ancient  horror in  an abandoned  temple.   The  third is  an
account of how Twoflower finally gets his wish to see a dragon,  and the final
story sends the two reluctant adventurers over  the edge of the Discworld into
space.
   Pratchett's style is very readable,  and  spotted with just the right touch
of humor.   At times  'The Colour of Magic' reminds one  of Anthony's Xanth or
Adams' Hitchhiker  series,  yet it  always retains a  new and unique  frame of
fantasy.   An excellent book for those who  are intrigued by the unusual,  and
the  interaction of  modern  ideas and  medieval  technology.    This book  is
thoroughly enjoyable light fantasy reading, and quite amusing as well.

                               Alas, Babble On.

               Here I sit, with page all plain,
               With nary an image in my brain.
               Not spaceship fast or slaughter gory,
               to be embellished into a story.
               So contrary to my charitable wish,
               I'll have no story in your next ish.
               And why is my mind all turned to rock?
               I'll tell you. I've got writer's block.

   The air was stale,  and he felt very little.   His plastic environment suit
made a crumpling noise as he turned to face her.  "Lisa?"
   "Yes, Lloyd?"
   "What happened to us?    I mean,  we can't touch any  more..."  He left the
sentence hanging,  contemplating.   Lisa knew what  he wanted to say,  and she
shamefully looked at the floor a moment before answering.
   "I'm sorry, Lloyd.  I know.  But if we were to remove these suits, you know
what would happen..."
   "Yes, the germs in the air would kill us,  since our bodies have no natural
defenses.  So we have to live all our lives in these shells,  in our own self-
contained environment, but why?  When did it all start?"
   Lisa was a  mother,  explaining a difficult  and harsh reality to  a child.
"Well, it all started a long, long time ago, when mankind was first developing
intelligence,  and made houses  to keep him safe and warm,   so that he didn't
have to face the elements.  But it really got worse in the last hundred years,
when we concentrated on welfare programs, health care, and started taking care
of  the physically  or  mentally deficient.    We  cheated natural  selection.
Because the weaker members of our society were protected,  they survived,  and
because they survived, they bred.  The weaker genes were not weeded out due to
natural selection, and gradually the entire human species became weaker, until
we  became  wholly  dependant  on our  man-made  artifices  to  cheat  natural
selection."
   Lloyd also  looked thoughtfully downward.   "And  then there was  the Great
Plague?  Is that why we have to wear these suits?"
   Lisa's eyes burned with tears.  "Yes, love.   The Great Plague came upon us
not long ago.  A sudden outbreak of disease became a worldwide horror, because
our scientists couldn't find  a cure for it fast enough.    The disease spread
quickly, and millions upon millions died, because they had no natural defenses
left, and we couldn't even find the cause of the disease.   Now we must remain
isolated from the natural environment, or else we will die like they did."
   Lloyd mustered the courage to look into Lisa's deep brown eyes.   "But it's
unbearable!  Is this what mankind has come to?
 What can we do about it?"
   Lisa broke  the contact by averting  her eyes.   "Nothing,   Lloyd,  except
live."
   Lloyd looked about him,  through the clear plastic suit,  at the antiseptic
white walls, and the sterile linoleum floor.  "If you can call this life."
