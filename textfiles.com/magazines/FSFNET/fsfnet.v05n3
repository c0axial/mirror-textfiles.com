    Ladies   and  gentlemen,   welcome  to   the  huge,   wide,  vast,
double-sized issue  of FSFnet!  This is  a very  special issue,  as we
have some very  special Dargon stories - the first  stories from three
new authors. The  first tale introduces us to Kittara,  and the events
that surround  her arrival in  Dargon. The second  story is part  2 of
Joel Slatis'  Ceda story (which is,  for now, unrelated to  the Dargon
project). The  third yarn is  part two of my  own tale about  Kite and
Pecora,  and  their  time  of  trial.   And  the  issue  ends  with  a
king-sized  epic  by John  White,  introducing  us  to Je'en,  a  very
captivating and deep  character who also has been  seen hanging around
Dargon Port.
    I will cut this  short, due to the size of  this issue, and simply
state  the things  I always  seem to  be saying  in these  editorials:
welcome to  the new  members; spread  the word  to your  friends about
FSFnet; if you want to write, mail me; and, finally, enjoy!

                         Kittara Comes to Town
    Her  name was  Kittara Ponterisso,  but most  folks that  knew her
usually called  her Crossbow Kitty.  She was  an expert shot  with any
kind of crossbow,  because she had to be. Her  skill with the crossbow
put food on the  table and kept a roof over  her head. Kittara's skill
was such  that it was easy  for her to find  work as a bodyguard  or a
hunter. Kittara  came to Dargon with  a purpose. She had  been paid to
put her skills  to use against a wealthy merchant,  a merchant who had
enemies in  this world, a merchant  who called himself Yan  the Yellow
(most people called him Yan the Yellowbellied).
    Yan had  a son, but  he didn't  know it. It  was this son  who had
hired Kittara  to find  Yan and  use her skills  to bring  about "...a
more equal  distribution of  wealth," Yan's son  had said.  Well, that
was  fine with  her as  long as  she was  paid. What  she knew  of her
employer  was  next to  nothing,  simply  the  fact  that he  was  the
unknown son of  this merchant, and that he wanted  his father's wealth
which, according  to law, he  would receive as inheritance  should his
father  meet an  untimely death.  A  crossbow bolt  was considered  an
untimely death.
    Kittara  was used  to larger  cities, but  didn't mind  Dargon for
its size.  Dargon was a suitable  place to work although  it mean more
effort on her part  to blend in with the residents. In  a town of this
size  strangers  were  often  noticed,  she  would  have  to  take  up
residence for  a while  at least,  probably after  she had  earned her
payment.  Yes, that  would  do. She  would pretend  that  she was  the
widowed  wife of  a  royal  soldier. Her  husband  had  taught her  to
handle a crossbow  when they had lived on the  frontier, a skill which
was  necessary  there  to  protect  oneself  from  bandits  and  other
nasties. She  would be looking for  a place to settle  down where life
was not so dangerous.
    The journey  here from  the capital  had been  uneventful. Kittara
was looking forward  to the excitement which her  mission would bring.
How many times  had she gone on similar assignments?  Many indeed, but
each still  had its  own feeling  of thrill, each  could be  her last.
She  thought about  what she  must  accomplish. She  must locate  this
merchant and then  watch him, learn his ways. A  man could not protect
his life all of  the time, thus he must be  vulnerable to death sooner
or later.
    Although a  crossbow quarrel in  the throat did not  look natural,
there were  other ways of disguising  a person's cause of  demise. Yan
was a merchant  with ships, his house  was on a cliff  facing the sea.
A plan  was rapidly becoming clear.  Get the merchant to  stand on the
edge of the cliff  while his ships sailed out, then put  a bolt in his
back and he  would topple into the  sea where his body  could be found
(or what  remained of it after  the sharks had finished  feasting) and
turned into  the proper  authorities. Yan's son  could be  informed of
the death  and he  could show up  with proof that  Yan was  his father
and that he was entitled to the proper inheritance.
    Kittara rode  into town on her  faithful Randy, a horse  which had
served  her for  the  last  three years.  Randy  was  a retired  light
cavalry  horse, retired  because  he had  been stolen  by  her from  a
scout who  had tried to  have his way with  her. She didn't  care that
the scout had  been a royal messenger. He wasn't  the first soldier to
receive a present from the delivery end of Old Henry, her crossbow.
    A  few  eyes turned  in  Kittara's  direction,  but they  did  not
stare. There  were more important  and exciting  things to see  and do
on this  last day  of the  festival than  watch some  dull woman  on a
plodding horse.  Kittara did  look rather dull,  she was  not prepared
for the  festivities and was  tired from  her journey. Randy  was also
tired and  plodded along in  hopes that  his master would  provide him
with a  nice bed and food.  Kittara scanned the festive  crowd and the
buildings  along the  street  looking  for a  place  to  stay for  the
night. Perhaps she  could get a few  hours of sleep and  then join the
fun;  it had  been such  a long  time since  she had  enjoyed herself.
Presently her  glance presented  her with a  choice: The  Hungry Shark
Inn or  the Inn of  the Panther.  Since the Inn  of the Panther  was a
bit closer she headed for it, praying that it still had a room.
    Kittara slid  from her  saddle, tied Randy  to the  hitchin' rack,
and entered  the brightly  lit common  room of the  Inn. The  room was
crowded with  people of all  ages who  were busy celebrating  the last
day of their  festival. Kittara went over  to the bar and  asked for a
room.  She was  given the  last room  in the  inn, she  was told,  and
should be  thankful that she  had found one. It  cost her a  more than
triple what she  would normally have considered fair but  it was not a
bad  room. It  was  a small  private  room  at the  end  of the  short
hallway on  the third  floor of the  building, roughly  furnished, but
suitable for her  present needs. She left the room,  locking it behind
her, and went  to retrieve her saddlebags and care  for Randy. Kittara
took  Randy to  the  Inn's  small stable,  settled  him  down for  the
night, and headed back for a few hours of sleep.
    Kittara awoke several  hours later with the pain of  hunger in her
gut. She  rose, donned some  fresh clothes and  headed down to  see if
there was anything  left to eat. The festivities were  still going on,
but at  a more  subdued level  as those  too drunk  to make  merry had
passed out,  and those who  were still  merry were busy  drinking. She
got a  plate of food from  the bar and  headed for a side  table where
she might  be alone; Kittara  would not  be comfortable until  she had
gotten to know  some of the townsfolk, a problem  she would begin work
on tomorrow after a good night's sleep.
    Kittara finished  her dinner  and sat  back against  the cushioned
wall)bench and  watched the  people of Dargon.  There were  all types:
poor,  rich,  merchants,  craftsmen, apprentices,  masters,  warriors,
clerics, thieves,  old, young, and  in)between. As  she took a  sip of
her wine  she noticed the  inn's namesake.  Above the fireplace  was a
mounted stuffed  head of a huge  panther. The beast's eyes  stared out
over  the  festive  crowd  as  if  they  were  hungry  and  resentful,
resentful of being stuck  on a wall instead of out  in the wilds where
they  belonged.  Kittara  shivered,  the   head  gave  her  a  strange
feeling. She  would have to  hear the story  of the panther,  as there
surely must be one connected with so large a beast.
    Kittara was  not aware  of the  man until  he was  standing behind
the chair opposite  her bench. He was a short  man, dressed in strange
blue  and  white patterned  clothing.  He  had  short black  hair  and
carried a beautiful  pair of swords which were of  the kind easterners
often fought  with. She had  heard stories  of weapons such  as these,
stories which described  them as being so sharp that  they would slice
a fresh leaf,  floating on a slow moving stream  current with only the
slightest  touch. She  did not  feel  at all  comfortable without  Old
Henry. Her  boot knife  would never  do to  defend herself  should she
need to.
    The man smiled and said, "Hellro, may I be pleased to join you?"
    Kittara  nodded,  thinking   that  the  strange)looking  foreigner
might also be  new to town. The  man turned towards the  door and held
up a hand  to attract the serving  wench in order that  he might order
a drink when  suddenly the huge chandelier that had  been hanging over
the common room  came crashing down. The chandelier was  a great wheel
holding  many  candles )  it  smashed  into  the  middle of  the  room
crushing several  people, destroying  tables and benches,  and causing
alcohol  to burst  into  flame.  People panicked  and  ran hither  and
thither  shouting, trying  to  help,  or trying  to  pilfer what  they
could. The  little man leaped to  his feet without a  glance a Kittara
and  rushed  headlong into  the  chaos.  Kittara grabbed  a  forgotten
cloak and  started beating  at some  of the  flames which  were coming
her way. She thanked  her god that she had not been  any closer to the
center of the room.
    It took several hours  for order to be restored to  the Inn of the
Panther. Luckily  the fire had only  caused minor damage and  the town
guard  had arrived  quickly so  that  the pilfering  losses were  also
slight. Jann,  the Innkeeper,  had come rushing  in from  the festival
to  see what  the problem  was in  his inn.  Jann had  noticed Kittara
beating the flames  and, upon discovering that she was  staying in the
inn, had  offered her free  room and board for  as long as  she needed
it in  thanks for her  efforts. The incident  would cost the  inn some
business, but the  innkeeper was thankful that no one  had been killed
in the incident and  promised one and all that he  would be open again
the following  night. Kittara thanked  Jann for his offer  and climbed
the stairs to  her room. Sleep was  not long in coming  this night and
Kittara  faded off  into a  dreamless  slumber. She  wondered who  had
melted the chain that the chandelier had hung from.

                   Ceda the Executioner: Chapter Two
    Three  weeks later  Ceda arrived  in Dhernis.  The city  was built
after the  fall of the Grandydyrian  empire (which was soon  after the
strange disappearance of their army in the desert.)
    Grandydyr had  at one point ruled  the world except for  the small
islands  that lay  between the  two worldly  continents of  Cergaan to
the South  and Beehnerne to the  North. The Island were  not populated
largely because  of the frequent  volcanic eruptions and  earth quakes
which devastated the  small them until about the time  of the that the
empire was defeated and fell.
    Until  that  time, the  elves  had  been  living on  the  Southern
continent of Cergaan  (This was not the continent that  the desert lay
and Ceda now rode).  When the Islands had at last  become safe to live
on  10,000 years  ago,  the elves  had moved  most  of the  population
there because  it was more  secluded and  easier to defend.  They left
some elves on  the continent to maintain a stronghold  and since then,
It has  grown into a  large City populated and  run by the  elves. The
rest of the  continent has been long since forgotten.  To this day, no
one but  the elves  have ever seen  the insides of  the City  of Elves
(as it is called).
    Dhernis was  also populated mostly  by elves. They were  mostly in
business  for  themselves  as  sailors  to and  from  the  Islands  of
Learis, but  some chose to  be mercenaries or  just to leave  and find
work in other cities throughout the continent.
    The city  was very  busy and  there would be  almost no  chance of
finding Rincraw  in the city  if he was by  chance still there,  so he
didn't bother  to get  a room.  That evening Ceda  found a  sailor who
would permit him to  sail back to the Islands with  him and also bring
Melgon along for a small price and they left the following morning.
    Ceda had slept  on the ship that night and  he felt very refreshed
when  he  finally  awoke  the  next morning.  They  were  now  sailing
through  the open  seas towards  the  Learis Islands  where the  elves
dwell and the crown was being kept.
    The crown  would be in the  palace and Ceda thought  all day about
how he  would gain entry  to it  without anyone knowing.  This however
was not  Ceda's chief concern  for he was an  assassin and had  to get
into  more heavily  guarded places  than this  before. The  thing that
most worried  him was the  problem of  getting the crown  and escaping
the islands before it was discovered missing.
    Dusk came  and Ceda went to  sleep for the morrow  would bring the
Learis Islands and he must rest.
    When  Ceda  woke the  next  morning,  The Islands  tall  volcanoes
outlines were  already visible from the  ship. They were so  tall that
the  tips of  them were  hidden amongst  the clouds.  That night  they
would dock and the adventure would begin.
    The night  came quickly  and Ceda  told the  captain to  pull into
the harbor  of the largest of  the 8 isles called  Perstanie where the
palace was  and dock. The  ship glided through  the water and  at last
Ceda was on land again.
    Ceda  gave the  captain of  the ship  a small  amount of  gold and
told him to wait  all night if need be for him  to return. The captain
nodded  and Ceda  left the  ship for  the palace  where the  crown was
almost certain to be.
    The  streets were  now empty  as the  night was  about half  over,
only now and again  would the city guards pass by  and until they were
gone, Melgon and Ceda hid in the shadows.
    The palace  now stood before them,  its large gate made  from some
magical  material that  lighted the  entire area  around it.  Ceda had
been in the  castle many times before because of  some of the business
that he had  done with the King  of the elves. He  stood some distance
away from the gate  and watched the guards walk up  and down the area.
Then he  turned walked the other  direction away from the  gate around
the  castle to  where it  was darker  and there  were less  guards. He
counted the guards  and watched as they walked by  a final time before
he hoisted himself  onto Melgon's back and climbed up  the back of its
neck while  it picked itself  up on its hind  legs. Ceda stood  on his
dragon mounts  long snout  and looked  down; it was  about 12  feet to
the ground and another 2 feet from Ceda's head to the top of the wall.
    He jumped  up and grasp  the top of  the wall pulling  himself up.
Then he sat  for a moment checking  that the guards had  not heard him
and then continued  on to the wall  and down the stairs  to the palace
grounds. He was in.
    Then Ceda  made his way to  Rincraw's room knocking out  the guard
that stood outside and entered.
    He  went slowly  over to  the  bed and  sat  down next  to it.  He
couldn't  see and  would have  to hope  that he  could feel  where the
elf's mouth  was before it had  time to scream. Ceda  didn't even want
to think  about what would  happen if he  was not sleeping  alone, but
knew that  if he didn't  get Rincraw, he  would never find  the crown.
His thoughts were  beginning to annoy him,  so he put them  out of his
mind. Then he sprang up onto the bed.
    Ceda  felt one  figure  under  his body  and  he  grabbed for  its
mouth. He got it before it had time to scream.
    "Good," he said  to himself and checked for another  person in the
bed.  There was  no one.  By this  time the  person was  squirming and
trying to scream but could not.
    "Now Rincraw,  I get a  chance to  repay you for  your treachery!"
He tightened his  grip on the neck of the  elf, but something bothered
him. The  elf's skin  was soft and  smooth, not like  that of  a male,
but of  a-- "By  all the lords  of Tavaar!" He  exclaimed. "You  are a
woman!" His voice just loud enough to here.
    She tried to speak but could not because of Ceda's hand.
    "I'll  let you  speak, but  if  you yell  for help,  I'll not  die
alone." He tried to see into here eyes but could not.
    He felt her nod and he withdrew his hand from her mouth.
    "I am Miratia, Rincraw's wife," she said, trying to see his face.
    "Where is he, I have a score to settle with him."
    "I know not, for I also seek vengeance upon him."
    Ceda looked  harder to see her  face but could not.  Without light
to see her  eyes, he could not  be sure if she was  telling the truth.
"Then we have a common goal," he said. "Where is he?"
    "Neither do I know that, he never returned from Pheeng'Am."
    "He didn't return?" Ceda grew angered. "Then the wench lied!"
    "What?"
    "Nothing."
    Ceda thought  about how he would  get out now and  finally said to
the elf:  "Miratia of Perstanie,  do you wish  to accompany me  to the
great city of  Pheeng'Am to find your husband and  take your vengeance
upon him?"
    "I do."
    "Then come now in haste, but quietly," he cautioned.
    They got up and  left the room. The guard was  still where he left
him and  all was good.  Then Miratia screamed  and ran towards  one of
the buildings. Ceda  started for the wall but the  guards were already
upon him  before he could  get there, so he  drew his sword  and tried
to fight though them, but Miratia was calling for more guards.
    "Tavaar!" he mumbled  and lowered his weapon. Then he  was led off
and put in a small damp cell in a cave under the castle.
    Morning  came and  Ceda was  awakened by  two burly  looking elves
and led  back up to  the court  of the palace  in chains. The  king of
the  elves sat  in the  back of  the room  on a  raised platform,  all
around the  room at regular  intervals were  armored men and  the rest
of  the room  was  filled  with nobles  and  subjects  that were  just
standing talking  with one  another while some  elven women  danced in
the center.
    Now the  room was quite.  Everyone looked  at Ceda except  for the
women who kept dancing as if nothing was happening.
    The king  looked over to  the women and  clapped his hands  and at
once they  left the  room. Then Ceda  was led into  the room  to where
the  dancers had  been. Still  no one  spoke but  everyone's attention
was focused on the king.
    "Greetings  Ceda of  No-Al  Ben,  what brings  you  to my  kingdom
again?" Everyone laughed  except Ceda who was not at  all pleased with
the  current turn  of events.  The  king got  up and  stepped down  to
where Ceda  stood, his  richly colored robe  dragged along  the smooth
stone floor. "Why  I have not had  you executed yet I do  not know. Is
there anything you wish, now that you stand before me?"
    "My argument is  not with you King Rackins, but  with your servant
Rincraw,  who stole  Grobst D'arbo's  crown from  me." Ceda  said this
loudly so that all the room heard quite clearly.
    The king glanced at  one of the other elves who  shook his head at
the King. "And,  Ceda of No-Al Ben,  where did you get  such a crown?"
The king mocked.
    Ceda  told the  room his  story and  at once  all the  people were
talking about  at and  arguing whether  he spoke  the truth.  The king
walked  to the  other elf  and spoke  with him  for a  moment quietly,
then he returned.
    "Can you prove this?" The king asked as the room again quieted.
    "I  can not...,"  he started  but  remembered the  skulls. "I  can
prove what you ask,"  he said. "But I must get to  my dragon mount for
what I need."
    The king looked  at one of the  guards at the door  and he nodded.
"What is it you require, Ceda of No-Al Ben? We've already found him."
    "There is  a pouch  on the  side of  the saddle,  in it  are three
skulls, bring one here."
    A messenger soon  returned with one of the  strange looking skulls
and gave it to Ceda.
    "Now look,  King of the Elves,"  he placed the skull  in the kings
hand and looked up.
    The king examined  the skull and looked at Ceda,  Then he laughed.
"You play  games with me,  Ceda of No-Al Ben,"  he said as  he through
the skull to the floor.
    "No!" Ceda  tried to  catch it  but the chains  held him  back and
before anyone knew  what had happened, the skeleton  stood before them
with his sword in his hand.
    Two  of the  Guards  leapt  forward and  one  fell  dead from  the
skeletons  sword.  The  other  swung  and  hit  the  skeleton  in  the
backbone tearing  it apart.  They all stood  and watched  thinking the
trouble was over  as it came apart into separate  bone except for Ceda
who kicked the skull.
    "Get  the  skull," he  shouted  and  the  skull flew  towards  the
already reforming bones only to be caught by the king.
    Ceda relaxed. The  king looked at Ceda and then  back at the weird
looking  skull  which he  now  held.  The  sword  and boned  were  now
nothing more than dust  on the floor and the room  at one became calm.
The guard that had been killed was taken away and they resumed talk.
    "It is  a dangerous toy  that you keep,  Ceda, but one  that saved
your life."  The king  told the  guards to take  his chains  off. Then
they went to the king private chamber with the third elf and talked.
    The third elf's  names was Merth; he  was a wizard and  was one of
the  closest friends  of  the  king. His  worldly  experience was  far
greater than  some of the best  warriors in the known  world, and this
also added to his  usefulness to the king. This for  the most part was
why the elf was with them while they talked.
    "Well Mirth," the king paused. "What do you think?"
    The  elf's voice  was a  high pitched  wine at  best, "This  could
prove to be  ample cause for Rincraw  and Quendell to betray  us if my
suspicions are correct.
    Ceda looked curiously at Merth. "What suspicions?"
    "I  cannot say  now, but  if  I'm to  be  sure, I  must talk  with
Sarve, the son of Tain, cousin to Tavaar the Great Overlord.
    "You cannot  speak of  the gods themselves?"  Asked the  king. "Is
the matter that urgent?"
    "the Great Army? Is that your thought?" Ceda interrupted
    "Possibly, but it  is of great importance that I  Make haste to my
chamber. I  will journey from  there to their  realm, for I  have felt
that there was a break in the natural order of things."
    The little  elf got up  and bowed low to  the king. Then  he left.
The  king, still  totally  oblivious  as to  what  had just  happened,
looked at Ceda who's face was enigmatic.
    "What was that about?"
    "The Great Army  may yet have it's day," Ceda  said. "However I do
not yet  understand how  or why.  This is  the information  that Merth
seeks from the gods."
    "Then what can we do?"
    "Wait."

    Five days  later, the meek  elf opened  the door from  his chamber
and emerged.  He was  paler than  usual and he  look perhaps  10 years
older. He  went down  the stairs of  the tower in  which his  room was
and into the main  room of the castle where the king  and Ceda sat and
talked as  a few Elven  women danced for  the subjects that  were also
in the room.
    The king and Ceda both got up as he came in.
    "Sit  my faithful  servant, for  I have  troubling news  for you."
The kings voice was firm, "And you are in need of rest."
    "I also  carry news, news from  the gods. They are  displeased for
the King of grandydyr and his army may rise again."
    "The Hidden  Army may yet walk  the earth again?" The  Kings voice
changed to worry.
    "Aye, my king."
    "but  why are  the Gods  not happy  for this?  How is  it possible
that after  all these years  the, the Gods  do not rejoice?"  Ceda was
now very confused.
    "Sit," said the  little elf, Merth. "For this will  take some time
to Explain."
    The king  nodded at a  guard by the door  to the room  and clapped
his hands four times. "Be gone, everyone until later."
    "Good," said Merth  as they finally sat alone, now  I can tell you
of what has happened." And the elf began.
    "10,000 years ago,  the army of Grobst D'arbo,  King of Grandydyr,
left Grandydyr  on a  mission. This  mission was  to destroy  all evil
that dwelt  in the  world, from  the most southern  tip of  Cergaan to
the  most northern  tip  of  the country  of  Weuyrt  on the  northern
continent,  or more  correctly, any  and  all beings  that were  swore
alliance to the evil lords of Endillion.
    "The  army was  the  biggest  one ever  assembled  in history  and
could  have  easily  completed  its  task except  that  the  lords  of
Endillion called  on the  Over Lord,  Tavaar, to  stop them,  and they
were granted  permission to destroy  the army. The Lords  of Endillion
sent  the Army  to Limbo  and transformed  Grobst D'arbo  into a  Tree
that would forever live in the desert wasteland.
    "Tavaar was  enraged by this  punishment, he thought  it unfitting
and deemed  that one day,  Grobst would again  walk the earth,  and it
is very possible that the day has come.
    "Grobst may  even now be  free of his  hell tree and  be summoning
his army from limbo where they otherwise would live forever."
    Ceda looked  confused. "But if  the army  is to destroy  all evil,
why were the gods not pleased?"
    "They  could not  say, but  they gave  me a  riddle from  the Over
Lord, Tavaar. He toys with them and will not let them tell me openly.
    "The riddle?" Ceda asked.
    "It goes like this:"

                    "Black and White forever fight,
                      And Green is in in between.
                        But when blue comes in,
                        Then all is left astray.
                            And so will come
                               the night.

                            White will cover
                            Black will fight
                             Blue will help
                            And so will come
                               the night.

                         Ileiruon will come on
                             Deadly Mount,
                           Blue and grey will
                                 join,
                         Sarve will not sit and
                                 wait,
                            And so will come
                               the night.

                       When at last night falls,
                      Things will be as they were.
                           On the last night,
                      All things, know thee well.
                      And then will come the time
                       Of the blue and the grey.
                      And then and only then will
                             there be day.
                                Mayhap."

    "But Sarve  did leave  me with  a word of  warning: If  night will
live, only  black will there  be, as is  in every night;  white, blue,
grey and  all other colors will  go unnoticed." Merth looked  at Ceda.
"I can not understand it, but it is bad."
    "Mayhap I can stop Rincraw before he uses the crown?" asked Ceda.
    "Mayhap, but I do not yet even understand why."
    "And the riddle, must it go like this, or can we decipher it?"
    "Sarve  said that  the Green  Monks that  may be  of help  in that
matter," Merth said. "And he told me how to reach them."
    (The dwelling  place of the Green  monks has always been  a secret
known only  to the  gods. The  Green Monks are  all knowing.  Not even
Tavaar possesses the  knowledge they have. It is for  this reason that
Tavaar hates them and  it is the same reason that  he does not destroy
them. He's afraid of their power because he knows not its capability.)
    "You know of the place of the Green Monks?" The king was amazed.
    "I do, but It is only for Ceda to travel there."
    "Where are they?"
    "The..."  Merth paused.  "They dwell  in  a land  only reached  by
passing through the Caves of Arnmere."
    "And you  want me to go  there?" Ceda laughed. "I  would sooner go
to the Sharshirian mountain alone!" He laughed again. "You jest!"
    Merths expression didn't change.
    "You surely jest..." Ceda repeated.
    Merths expression still didn't change.
    "You surely jest.... ?"
    "You must go, Ceda."
    "Now you speak  the truth, I must  go; But not to  Arnmere. I will
seek Rincraw." Ceda got up and left the room.
    The king looked at Merth. "What will happen?"
    "The answer lies in Weuyrt, where the caves lay."
    Two days  later, Ceda  the Executioner  set sail  for the  city of
Pheeng'Am in search of the elf, Rincraw and his partner, Quendell.

                    Respect thy Elders: Chapter Two
    Kite slowed his  horse as he came upon the  peasant village. After
several long  days and  nights of  riding, he  was weighted  down with
weariness and  worry. His  trip had  begun over a  week ago,  when his
fiancee,  Pecora Winthrop,  had fallen  ill. Following  the advice  of
her nurse,  mistress Izetta,  Kite had  ridden west,  in search  of an
Elder  named Isentraum.  The journey  had not  been easy,  for it  had
rained nearly  every afternoon, and  Kite's mind was heavy  with worry
for his  fiancee. Stopping at the  crest of a hill,  Kite regarded the
small hamlet  below. There was no  one about in the  darkness, but the
lights  of  several  wooden  buildings shone  warmly,  and  one  large
building bore  a weathered sign that  was undoubtedly the crest  of an
inn, though  Kite could  not make  out the  caricature from  where his
horse stood.
    Kite rode slowly  into the village and tied up  his horse, peeking
into the  inn through a  dirty, thick-glassed window. After  a moment,
he  stepped inside  into a  low, smoky  room filled  with peasants.  A
great  fireplace  fogged  the  room   with  wood  smoke,  and  several
customers  turned  to  view  the  newcomer,  then  returned  to  their
draughts. Kite  strode purposefully  to the bar  and requested  a pint
of stout.
    "Right  away, milord,"  responded the  barkeep, who,  true to  his
word, promptly brought  Kite a stein, filled to the  brim. Kite placed
a  Scrod on  the counter,  which  the barkeep  quickly snatched  away.
"Will there be anything else, milord?"
    "Ah, yes, a room for the night... and... uh..."
    "Yes, milord?" prompted the barkeep.
    Kite pondered. He  was in the area where mistress  Izetta had said
to search for  the Elder, but he  had no idea where to  begin to look.
Might as well ask  someone, and who would be more  likely to know than
a barkeep? "Can you tell me anything about a man named Isentraum?"
    At the  barkeep's reaction, Kite knew  he had not asked  the right
thing. "Well,  milord, not... no, I'm  afraid I can't. Ah,  excuse me,
sir,  let me  see to  your room..."  The barkeep  bustled off.  It was
obvious that  Kite had  agitated the  man. He turned  his back  to the
bar and looked  around the room, but he found  many nearby patrons had
their eyes  on him. He  made bold  to face the  group as a  whole, but
suddenly a small, wiry man stepped up to him from behind.
    "Now, sir,"  he began softly, as  he turned Kite back  to the bar.
"You mustn't go  stomping about and hollering  about old superstitions
in a town such  as this. People don't take kindly to  it. Now sit down
and  drink  your stout."  After  a  moment,  Kite complied,  and  soon
afterwards the  barkeep returned with  a set  of keys to  Kite's room.
The thin  stranger leaned over  to Kite  and whispered, "Now  shall we
go discuss this as it should be, behind a locked door?"
    Kite, still rather bewildered, agreed and led the man to his room.

    Having recovered  his composure, Kite  began to question  the man.
"Now who are you, and why have you taken me aside like this?"
    "My  name," began  the  stranger, "is  Palawan.  I overheard  your
question  of the  barkeeper, and  wished  to avoid  any violence  that
might  have  come  from  it.  The  people of  this  town  are  a  very
suspicious and superstitious  lot. Now," began Palawan,  as he settled
in a chair, "why do you wish to find an Elder?"
    "That is for me alone to know."
    "Ah. Well, then, I  fear it is for me alone to  know where to find
the  one called  Isentraum." He  made to  get up,  knowing how  Kite's
would respond.
    "Very well,"  Kite began. "I am  betrothed to a lady  of the House
of  Winthrop. She  has fallen  ill,  and I  have been  told that  this
Elder may be able to help her."
    "Do you love this girl?"
    What kind of question was that? "Of course I do... very much."
    "Aah.  Then perhaps  I can  help you.  I will  guide you  to where
this Isentraum lives,  and I will present you to  him. What follows is
up to him."

    The path Palawan  had chosen led across the north  face of a small
mountain,  and   Kite  found   the  going   very  difficult,   but  he
persevered.  He  wondered  about  the  small,  wiry  Palawan.  He  was
obviously not  one of the  peasants of the  village, but he  seemed so
weak that  he would not  be able to make  a fighter or  messenger. The
previous evening  they had talked  while sitting by the  fire. Palawan
seemed  interested in  every detail  about  Kite and  Pecora, and  how
Kite  thought the  Elder might  be  able to  help him.  Kite had  also
listened as Palawan had  told him of his late wife;  it seemed to Kite
that Palawan was a very lonely man.
    That  afternoon, as  they approached  the crest  of the  mountain,
Palawan spoke with  Kite. "The Elder lives just  over this outcropping
of loose stone. It is very dangerous, so be careful."
    The  two began  to climb  the loose  rock, but  Palawan seemed  to
make much  better speed than  Kite. Then Kite  saw Palawan slide  on a
loose rock, and  come tumbling down the slope. Kite  knew that the old
man  would tumble  to  his death  if he  wasn't  stopped. Kite  danced
toward Palawan  as he rolled, and  tried to anchor himself.  He caught
Palawan's arms  and held  fast. The  old man looked  at him  with deep
bronze-green  eyes  and  smiled,  apparently unhurt,  save  for  minor
scrapes  and bruises,  and  a small  wound on  his  right elbow.  They
finished the ascent a little more slowly, and came upon a small hut.
    The two approached  the hut, and found a figure  bent in a garden.
Kite scuffed  his feet to  make sure the  man knew someone  was there,
then he stopped.  The man slowly stood, tentatively  holding his lower
back,  and turned.  The man  who faced  him stood  somewhat less  than
Kite's height,  and lank.  His coarse  black hair  framed a  long face
with deep,  bronze-green eyes. Palawan  walked over to the  Elder, and
for  a  moment  seemed  to  occupy  the  same  space,  before  melding
entirely into the form of the Elder.
    "Marquis Kite  of the  House of  Talador, I  am Isentraum.  I know
the hows and  whys of your coming,  and I have seen  the worthiness of
your soul.  Know that am  both able and  willing to aid  your fiancee,
and the  price I  request is  small. There  is a  rare herb,  known as
Elmin. You must  bring me as much as  you can. You may find  it at the
home  of a  druid  named Hartley,  who lives  outside  the village  of
Greenmont,  two days  north of  here. Give  him my  regards. When  you
return, I will see to your favor. Go now."
    With that, the  old man returned to his garden,  but Kite couldn't
help  but notice  the wound  on  his right  arm  as he  walked off  in
search of Hartley the druid of Greenmont.

                               A New Life
    What does a Bard do when she can no longer sing?
    Two years. Two  years was a long time, but  not long enough. Never
wouldn't be long enough. Two years since the incident...

    It was  really her fault. No  matter how much she  wanted to blame
someone else,  the primary  fault lay  totally with  Je'lanthra'en. If
only she  hadn't been so  proud, so sure  her status would  provide as
much protection as  a full phalanx of Baranur's army.  Bards were very
respected, but,  in the black of  night, where no one  else could see,
even a Bard could be attacked.
    Je'en had been  in Magnus for an annual meeting  of the College of
Bards. She  had stayed out  late one night,  and, in deciding  to take
the fastest  way to her  lodgings, had set her  horse onto one  of the
three  "tunnels" that  led  thru  the Fifth  Quarter  - the  sometimes
called Thieves' Quarter:  really the slums of the  city. The "tunnels"
-   the  only   properly-wide,  glow-globe   lighted,  patrolled   (if
irregularly) streets  in that Quarter,  the light creating  a 'tunnel'
of safety  thru the  darkness and  danger of that  Quarter -  were the
safest  way  thru  the  Fifth  Quarter during  the  day.  But,  midway
between the  dark of  the night  and the first  light of  day, nowhere
within  the boundaries  of the  Fifth  Quarter was  safe. Je'en  felt,
however, that  her green cloak  and hood, the  silver-embossed leather
harp  case on  her  back, and  the  harp  on yellow  on  green of  her
horse's trappings would  ward off any evil-doers: not only  was a Bard
the most  respected non-Royalty possible,  but there were  rumors (not
unfounded)  that some  Bards could  do magic!  Je'en couldn't,  but no
one else  could know that. She  felt herself so safe,  that she didn't
even make sure her  sword was limber in its sheath,  and ready to draw
- in  fact Leaf-killer  was peace-bonded into  its sheath  because the
Inn she had been at had required that precaution.
    Totally   unconcerned  with   the   shadows   beyond  the   meager
illumination  on the  "tunnel" she  had chosen,  Je'en was  caught off
guard by  a shape  that hurtled  out of the  darkness and  knocked her
from her  horse. She  hit the  ground hard, but  managed (by  luck) to
land on  her attacker,  so she  was able to  recover quicker  than he.
She was  on her feet,  cloak back, and  Leaf-killer out and  ready, by
the time  the man in  tattered clothing (but  a nice and  shiny sword)
was able  to face her. Unfortunately,  he had some friends  with him -
five to  be exact.  Self-protection was  a skill all  had to  learn in
this semi-civilized world,  and Je'en could protect  herself,  but not
as well  as some (due  mostly to the demands  of her profession  - she
spent   more  time   perforce   at  singing   and   harping  than   at
sword-drill), and  not well at  all against six  determined vagabonds,
attracted  by her  rich trappings,  and emboldened  by their  numbers.
She put  up a  good fight  - she actually  incapacitated two  of them,
killing at least  one - but they  knew what they were  doing. She felt
an iron point  score her cheek perilously near her  right eye, and she
was  temporarily   blinded  by  frighteningly  profuse   blood.  Then,
another sword scored  on her leg, slicing into her  thigh and buckling
it. And,  almost simultaneously,  another  edge  caught her  under her
right  bracer, cutting  deeply into  her right  wrist, causing  her to
drop Leaf-killer as she sank to the ground.
    Helplessly  unarmed,  and weak  from  pain  and blood-loss,  Je'en
watched as her  horse was looted of the few  resaleable goods she had.
Irritated by  the meager haul,  the leader  of the ruffians  turned on
Je'en,  and  noticed her  fine  green  cloak  and  the harp.  She  was
relieved of  those, and  the few  items of  personal jewelry  she wore
(including  the pendant  of  her  Rank in  the  College),  and it  was
harder  for her  to see  her  harp, Soft-Winds,  in the  hands of  the
thieves than the  thought of her battle-loss was.  Until the attention
of the leader was turned on her person.
    "Pretty,"  said  the  leader.  "A   little  more  money  from  the
slavers, to  make up  for the  trouble we've had  wit' you."  His leer
was pure evil.
    "She'll take too  much time, be too much trouble,  Skar!" said one
of the  survivors. "I know someone'll  give us 5 Crowns  for this 'ere
neck-chain -  'e needs it for  a job 'e's got:  'personatin' a Singer,
it is. Five Crowns's  more'n we'd get fer her and all  the rest o' her
stuff,  plus she  killed Han,  and  probably Charet,  too. Let's  kill
'er, Skar! Real slow like, too."
    Skar was  a man  of action,  but he  knew his  men well  enough to
listen  to them.  Five  Crowns was  more than  the  skinny girl  would
fetch,  and the  fact that  she was  a Bard,  a Singer  in the  slang,
could  complicate matters.  So, he  decided.  He drew  his knife,  and
knelt  next to  the ever  weakening Je'en.  Then, casually,  he placed
the knife to her throat, and slashed quickly and cleanly.
    The  new pain  pushed Je'en  over  the edge.  As blackness  closed
over her  mind, she  felt herself  being dragged  into the  shadows at
the edge  of the "tunnel",  heard some  rude comments about  what they
were going  to do  to her before  she cooled down  too much,  and then
there was an odd honking noise just before the blackness claimed her.

    The  'honking' had  been the  Quarter's Early  Warning System.  It
signaled a  patrol, and said  it was close.  Skar was forced  to leave
Je'en behind,  but he was  long gone, with all  the loot, by  the time
the patrol found the wounded Bard.
    The City  Patrol, while in existence  to keep order, also  did its
best  to  help   people  in  need,  when  such   aid  wasn't  directly
dangerous.  So,  when   Je'en's  body  was  found,   a  stretcher  was
fashioned, and four of the patrol escorted her to the nearest Healer.
    Magnus,  like most  cities  of the  Realm,  licensed its  healers,
insuring  a minimum  level of  competency in  the healing  craft. But,
some  Healers  bearing  the gold-covered,  city-seal-embossed,  iechyd
leaf  (a simple  pain-alleviating  remedy  when  boiled  in water)  in
their front  windows were  little more  than potion-mixers,  having no
magickal knowledge whatsoever.  Of course, the Court had  claim to the
best of  the healers, but  the other Healers  thruout the city  had no
rating other  than the  gold leaf of  minimum ability.  Advertising by
word  of mouth  generally  led people  to the  best  Healers, but  the
Patrol didn't  have time for  such shopping around. The  moved rapidly
thru  the well  lighted streets  of the  merchant quarter  looking for
the nearest gold  leaf they could find. Of course,  had they known she
was a  Bard, they would have  made best speed  to the Castle -  a Bard
was 'royalty', and would be treated as such.
    The healer living  in the house they found was  irritated at being
awakened in the  middle of the night,  but when he saw  Je'en, he shut
up (after a short utterance in plea of aid) and went to work.
    The  healer,  unfortunately, was  a  potion-mixer.  He knew  three
chants  of healing:  two  to ease  minor back-pain,  and  one to  stop
bleeding in the  head area - i.e.  only one of particular  use. But he
did know  his herbs and  potions, and  he used his  knowledge  swiftly
and surely  to save Je'en's life.  But, he just didn't  know enough of
the craft to return her to her former full health.
    When  her  life was  no  longer  in danger,  she  was  taken to  a
recovery-house.  All but  the most  wealthy of  healers operated  from
their homes, which  usually didn't have enough room  to house patients
who  required  extended  care.  So, there  were  the  Recovery-houses,
large dormitory-style  hostels where  patients could receive  the care
necessary to help them to recover.
    She wasn't there  long. Only four days, during which  time she was
unconscious, her  body healing  itself as  best as  it could  with the
help of  various potions prescribed by  her Healer. When she  woke up,
finding herself  within the  easily recognizable  curtained-walled bed
of a  recovery-house, she called out  - painfully and not  very loudly
- for an orderly.  When one came, she said, "Rydw  i Canur." The words
were barely  recognizable, and  they hurt  her throat  like swallowing
fire,  but  the  peculiar  resonance inherent  in  the  almost-magical
phrase conveyed  their meaning,  and the  orderly went  hurrying after
someone in charge.
    Shortly thereafter,  she was  transferred to  the Castle,  and the
care  of the  Royal Healer,  Master  Enowan. He  immediatly set  about
implementing further  healing using the  more powerful magicks  at his
command, but he  was too late to  be must help. Once  the body accepts
a pattern  of health, it takes  massive magic to change  that pattern.
Most  normal  healing serves  to  help  the  body restore  its  normal
pattern.  But in  the case  of  traumatic injury,  special healing  is
necessary  to force  the body  to survive,  and thereby  create a  new
life-pattern. Such  had been done  to Je'en,  and not even  the skills
of  Master Enowan  could reverse  the process  now -  it had  been too
long, and Je'en's  life pattern had accepted tha injury  to her throat
and wrist  as natural. Enowan  was able to  eradicate the scar  on her
leg, but  he could only smoothe  out the scar  on her face, make  it a
little less ragged, and  heal it as far as it would  go. The damage to
her  throat   -  her   windpipe,  and  therefore   her  voice   -  was
irreparable, as was the damage to her wrist.
    When  she awoke  from the  healing  sleep that  master Enowan  had
placed her  in, she found  herself in  a private recovery  room within
the Castle,  with an apprentice healer  attending her. As soon  as she
was  fully awake,  the  apprentice  raced off  to  get Master  Enowan.
While she  was alone,  Je'en tried  out her voice  and then  her hand.
Her throat  still burned  a little,  feeling a  bit like  an incipient
cold just  lingering at the back  of her throat and  tickling her with
an unreachable  itch. But, when  she coughed  to relieve the  itch, it
set her  whole throat  to such  aching that she  strove to  ignore the
minor discomfort to avoid the major pain.
    When she  looked at her  hand, the only  evidence of injury  was a
small  diamond of  scar tissue  at  the center  of both  sides of  her
wrist. But,  when she tried  to flex her  fingers, she found  that she
had  almost no  fine  control over  them  - she  could  bend them  all
together,  but not  one  at a  time.  And, when  she  reached for  the
pitcher at her  bedside to pour herself  a cup of water,  once she was
able to grasp  the handle, she found that she  couldn't lift it. There
was absolutely no strength in her hand at all.
    Totally  dispirited, she  sank back  on her  pillows to  await the
Master healer, already afraid of what he would say.
    Master Enowan  arrived, smiling  the false-and-not-very-reassuring
smile of a  healer, and took her  pulse at her throat  and left wrist.
Then, after  lifting her eyelids to  look at her eyes,  he crossed his
palms an  inch above her chest,  and closed his eyes.  His hands began
to glow,  and Je'en  knew that  he was examining  her deeply,  the way
only the best calibre of Healers could.
    When  his  hands stopped  glowing,  Je'en  said,  "So, how  am  I,
Master Enowan?"
    The healer opened  his eyes, and said, "Alive, and  as well as can
be expected."
    "But, what about my...my voice, and my hand? Will they heal?"
    "I'm afraid  not, Je'en. The scar on your voice box will  never be
gone, tho  it will stop hurting  shortly. And your hand  will never be
as dextrous  as it once was,  tho it, too, will  recover some. I...I'm
sorry, Je'en, but there wasn't anything more we could do. We tried..."
    Je'en's eyes closed  on her tears. She knew,  somewhere deep down,
that she  would never  sing again.  When she  was pronounced  fit, she
would go to  the local College, and  get tested, but she  was sure she
would fail.  And, when  you've been  one thing all  your life,  how do
you change?

    Two weeks  later, the verdict  was in.  She could no  longer sing,
and  her voice  was deemed  unsalvageable. She  could no  longer play,
and  her  hand was  also  deemed  unsalvageable.  The Masters  of  the
College ruled that she  could remain a Bard if she so  chose - but she
did not.
    She stood  in the anteroom waiting  for the Hall of  Ceremonies to
be prepared. The  Ceremony of Leaving was seldom  performed, and there
were special  preparations to be made.  She wore her finest  tunic and
breeches, and  a new green cloak,  and Rank pendant. The  sword at her
side wasn't Leaf-killer,  and the harp on her  back wasn't Soft-Winds,
but  she  would   never  see  those  artifacts   again  anyway.  These
replacements had been  given to her out of the  stores of the College,
tho she  would only be  keeping the sword after  today. It was  a fine
weapon, well  crafted without being  showy, and  she was glad  to have
it (but it  couldn't replace Leaf-killer, that had been  in the family
since her  father's father's father's  mother's time). She was  in all
ways  prepared for  the ceremony  - her  lines were  memorized with  a
Bard's  meticulous skill,  and  she  had steeled  herself  not to  get
emotional (at least not under the eyes of the whole College).
    Finally,  two  journeymen bards  opened  the  great doors  of  the
Hall, and  beckoned her to enter.  She did so, and  began walking down
the aisle  formed by the  huge, floor-to-ceiling Screens of  Privacy -
intricately carven  wooden screens  that narrowed the  vast hall  to a
small  lane that  led from  the  doors to  the  Dias at  the far  end.
Behind  the Screens,  the  whole  College-in-attendance was  gathered,
silent and mourning for the loss of a sister.
    As Je'en  walked the aisle, she  looked up at the  huge escutcheon
that hung  behind the  Dais. The blazon  ran thru her  mind -  Vert, a
bend  or,  over all,  a bard  Harp, proper:  the green  background for
the World that  was the Bard's home, the gold  diagonal stripe for the
allegeance the  College paid to the  kingdom of Baranur, and  the Harp
that  signified  their profession.  She  would  miss being  under  the
protection of that proud coat-of-arms.
    She reached the  steps to the Dais, and mounted  the leftward ones
as was  proper (normally, the  rightward steps accessed the  dais, but
she  was leaving,  so it  was reversed  for her).  The two  journeymen
waited at the steps  until she was on the Dais,  then they turned, and
walked back down the aisle and out, closing the doors behind them.
    Je'en was  alone on the  Dais save for  the Master of  the College
in Magnus, Master  Heagn. The somewhat old man still  had a fine voice
for all his  years, and his hands  were as sure as  a new journeyman's
on his harp.  He looked fondly on Je'en, and  sadly, too. Tho Leavings
weren't totally unheard  of, usually the Leaver was one who had made a
bad choice  early in life, and  found the College not  quite right for
them, or  something came up that  changed their lives in  a happy way,
and  led them  away from  the College.  The tragic  nature of  Je'en's
Leaving was accentuated  by the fact that, in  Heagn's estimation, she
had had the potential to one day become the Master of the College.
    When the  doors were  closed, the  Ceremony began.  Je'en advanced
to  the podium  standing  between  herself and  Master  Heagn. On  the
podium  was  the Crystal  of  Oathes,  an  Artifact  as old  as  Bards
themselves,  on which  all promises  within  and to  the College  were
made.  Je'en  placed  her  hands on  the  conic, multi-faceted,  clear
Crystal, and said,  "Rydw i Canur," which  meant 'I am a  Bard' in the
ancient  language of  the first  Bards ever.  As the  words' resonance
filled  the chamber,  she could  feel  the vibration  travel down  her
arms  and into  the  Crystal,  which, after  a  moment  began to  glow
softly, infusing  her hands  and arms with  a pearly  opalescence, and
soothing the ache that still lingered in her throat when she spoke.
    Master Heagn  then said, "Je'lanthra'en, Journeyman  of the Eighth
Stave,  you and  I have  met here to dissolve  your allegiance  to the
College of Bards. Is it your intention to continue with this course?"
    Swallowing  from more  than the  discomfort of  her throat,  Je'en
said, "Yes, Master Heagn."
    "Then let  it be known  that Je'lanthra'en  is leaving of  her own
accord, and  her own choice.  Should circumstances change, or  any aid
ever be  needed, the  doors of  this College,  and all  other Colleges
united  in the  fellowship  of all  that is  Bardic,  shall not  close
their doors unto you, and readmittance will never be barred from you.
    "Now, return  unto me the  symbols of your former  calling." Je'en
took her  hands away  from the  Crystal, but  they continued  to glow.
She swiftly  slipped off  the harp's  strap, and  handed it  to Master
Heagn. If  it had been  hers, as had  Soft-Winds, she would  have been
able to  reclaim it from him  after the ceremony, but  she would leave
this one with  the College. She next unfastened her  cloak, and handed
it also to the  Master Bard. And, lastly, she took  off the chain that
bore her  Rank. That Master  Heagn also  took, and Je'en  returned her
hands to the Crystal.
    "Now, say the  words that will release you from  your vows and set
you free of us and our ways," said Master Heagn.
    Je'en hesitated, swallowed  again, and finally said,  "Didw i ddim
Canur."  meaning 'I  am  not a  Bard.'  And the  glow  of the  Crystal
faded, finally  going out. She  felt a  slight push against  her hands
as  the Crystal  emphasized her  apartness  now, and  she lifted  them
from its  surface. Oddly, she  didn't feel  any different -  but maybe
that was  because she had  long since accepted  the fact that  she was
leaving, and this was just the confirmation of that fact.
    Master Heagn  offered her  his hand  before bidding  her farewell,
and as  she descended the  rightward stairs, those behind  the Screens
began a  minor key  chant of  parting that  did more  to bring  on her
tears  than the  actual ceremony  had. She  was now,  finally, on  her
own,  no longer  a Bard,  and no  longer protected  like one,  either.
What was she to do?

    Revenge  was the  first thing  she thought  of. Those  six thieves
had ruined  her entire life.  Two had already  paid for it,  but there
were four more to catch, and torture, and eventually kill.
    But,  Je'en  wasn't vengeful.  Another  might  have taken  out  at
least  a little  frustration on  that  first healer  who hadn't  known
enough to save  her life as it  had been before the  accident. But she
knew that it  wasn't his fault, and  she sent him a  gold arm-band she
had  been given  once for  stopping  a revolt  in one  of the  western
duchies by  satirizing the  upstart so well,  and so  scathingly, that
his  followers  all  left  him,  laughing.  The  arm-band  was  enough
payment  for  a years  worth  of  bone-setting, and  ache-curing,  and
ague-warding for  a wealthy  family, and  the healer  immediatly moved
into a  better neighborhood (one  not so  close to the  Fifth Quarter)
after thanking her for such a generous gift.
    So, since  revenge, as such, was  really out of the  question, she
decided to  join the  city guard,  and help  protect others  from what
had happened  to her.  But there  was one problem.  She wasn't  a very
skilled   fighter,  and   what  she   knew  applied   to  right-handed
techniques, which she could no longer use, of course.
    She had  heard about  a training school  outside a  little village
to the northwest run  by a retired adventurer who had  quite a name as
both  an adventurer  and as  a  teacher. It  was said  that those  who
survived his school  were the best swordsmen around. His  fee was high
enough that he  wasn't inundated by students, and his  policy of a one
week  trial  period to  determine trainabilty,  after which  one could
be rejected  without a refund, kept  the idle rich from  cluttering up
his practice yard.
    Je'en  had a  lot  of money  -  she had  kept most  of  it at  the
College  in Magnus,  and of  course it  had all  been returned  to her
when she  left. So,  hoping she had  the talent to  go with  her money
and  drive,  she  packed  up   and  headed  north-west.  Besides,  she
thought,  even if  I'm not  accepted, I'll  be two-thirds  the way  to
Dargon, where  my brother Kroan, lives.  I could always just  keep on,
and pay him a visit - haven't seen him in years.

    The School  of Lord Sir  Morion was  quite impressive. It  was set
ten miles from  the village of Tench, in the  forest that covered most
of the  area. It looked  like a citadel  from the outside  - massively
walled, with  great square towers at  each of the five  corners, and a
huge  ironwood drawbridge  to  span the  fifty-foot deep,  twenty-foot
wide  chasm that  surrounded  it.  The drawbridge  was  down, and  the
portcullis  up when  Je'en arrived  in the  afternoon. The  forest was
cleared for a mile  on all sides of the citadel,  and the clearing was
filled  with  activity  -  several neatly-planted  fields  were  being
tended to;  one of three  oval tracks was  being used to  race horses,
and  another  hosted a  foot  race.  Elsewhere, there  were  roped-off
squares wherein  two, and  sometimes more,  people fenced  with wooden
swords, and  all manner of  other weapons.  From the number  of people
around  that she  could  see,  Je'en hoped  that  Sir Morion's  school
wasn't filled.
    She stopped  by one of the  roped enclosures, and watched  the two
people  fencing  within.  They  seemed  very good  as  judged  by  her
knowledge: they  at least put  on a good  show. Finally, one  of them,
in  all-black  armor with  a  very  stylised  gryphon painted  on  the
breastplate  and wicked-looking  silver  trim around  the eyeslits  of
his helm,  executed a  slashing backhand that  caught his  opponent in
the side.  Action stopped, and then  the one in tattered  blue slumped
across the  other's sword as  if slain. He layed  on the ground  for a
minute, then  rolled over and sat  up, took the hand  offered him, and
got  helped to  his  feet.  Both men  removed  their  helms and  began
discussing the finer points of the battle.
    Je'en caught the  attention of one of the  similarly armored young
men around the ring, and asked, "Where can I find Sir Morion, please?"
    "O,  din tye  know? Tha'  one, in  ta black.  Tha's t'Lord  o' tis
place, miss.  An' t'oter one,  tha's Ironfist. Goin to  graduate soon,
'e is. Real  soon. Gonna miss 'im, too. Come  on, lemme int'r'duce you
to 'em both. Foller  me, now, quick. Tey get away  and a' talking, tey
won't be back 'fore supper."
    Je'en followed  the rather jovial,  if hard to  understand, fellow
over to where  the two combatants were talking away  while two younger
men removed their  armor. Je'en's guide stepped right up  to them, and
said, "Hey, 'Fist,  Bull, great match, eh? I bet  you'll beat the Bull
before  ya leave,  'Fist -  i know  ya can  do it!  Yer gettin'  beter
every day!  O, hey guys,  this here little  lady was askin'  after ya,
Bull. I'll leave ya to 'er: almost my turn in the ring. Bye, now."
    "Take care, Kyle,"  said the man who was still  wearing black even
tho his armor  was all in a  neat little pile at his  feet. "And watch
March's third-return:  remember the counter  I showed you."  He turned
to  Je'en  and  said, "Hello.  My  name  is  Morion,  but most  of  my
students call me Bull. How do you do."
    Je'en  shook his  hand, and  gazed at  the man.  He was  tall, and
full-bodied, with broad  shoulders, and a thick chest,  arms and legs.
His hair  was raven-black,  his face  handsomely aristocratic,  and he
had the oddest eyes  she had ever seen - they  were ice-grey, so light
that there seemed to be something wrong with them.
    She said, "I'm  fine, Sir." Her throat had ceased  hurting by now,
but  her voice  was  still a  bit  gravelly, and  she still  swallowed
a lot. "I was wondering whether you have room for  one more student in
your  school, Sir.  I...I have  had to  leave by  previous profession,
and  I thought  perhaps I  could be  a guardsman,  or a  mercenary, or
something, now.
    Morion  looked at  Je'en  carefully.  She was  rather  tall for  a
girl,  and  she was  in  rather  better  condition than  average.  She
obviously wasn't some  maid, or tavern-girl, out to  make something of
herself. And  then there was that  terrible scar across her  face. She
had a history, and a reason to come here. "You know the rules?"
    "One week trial, fee in advance and non-refundable."
    "Yes. Well,  if you  have the  money to spend,  I'll take  you in.
Either Ironfist here,  or myself will work with you  each day, and you
will  know whether  we will  let you  stay seven  days from  now. I'll
show you to your temporary quarters - if you'll follow me?"
    The  next week  wasn't  what  she had  been  hoping  for. She  had
practiced while  traveling from  Magnus, trying to  get used  to using
her  left hand  to  fence with,  but  it hadn't  been  easy. And,  she
appeared truly clumsy  when she was sparring,  especially since either
Ironfist or  Morion was  usually her partner.  She refused  to explain
anything  about  herself  to  them,  tho,  at  least  before  she  was
accepted, and  so they let  her try to  fight with what  was obviously
her off  hand. But,  she did her  best at everything  she was  told to
do, and  that included some  of the other  work around the  school, as
well as running,  jumping, climbing, and horse-back  riding (which she
was rather good at, even left handed).
    By  the  end of  her  trial  period, she  was  sure  she would  be
heading  on  to  Dargon  the  next   day,  minus  about  half  of  her
accumulated  wealth.  She hoped  there  were  plenty  of jobs  for  an
unskilled wench  in Dargon - she  didn't want to live  on her savings,
and they wouldn't last all that long, anyway.
    Still,  she was  out in  her practice  armor and  wooden sword,  a
wooden  shield strapped  to  her arm  in  such a  way  that her  wrist
didn't  come into  play  when moving  it, and  faced  off against  Sir
Morion (she  couldn't bring  herself to  call the man  Bull -  it just
didn't  fit him,  tho she  was  sure that  he  had a  good reason  for
keeping such  a nickname). She had  learned a few things  in her week,
and she wasn't quite  so clumsy anymore. She had a  good stance, and a
good  grip on  the sword,  as well  as one  good power-shot  that was,
unfortunately, all too easily blocked.
    They sparred,  her sword-and-shield against  Morion's single-sword
(at which he was  a master). She held her own,  tho Morion was keeping
his attacks  down to  a good novice  level. She kept  her eyes  on his
sword, and  not on  the distraction  of his  helm and  its decoration,
and  she moved  her whole  body  in response  to his  movements -  the
"rooted" technique was  for superior strength or skill,  and speed was
one  of her  advantages. By  the end  of the  match, she  was sweating
(tho Morion  was as dry  as an old bone)  but feeling very  good about
herself, and how she had done.
    She removed  her helm,  and, more  slowly, the  rest of  her armor
(she didn't  rate personal squires). As  she did, she saw  Morion, out
of  his armor,  Ironfist, and  the ten  other farthest  along students
come her way.  'This is it -  time to get told to  leave' she thought,
and her good feelings vanished like smoke in a good wind.
    Morion stopped  before her,  and the  others gathered  around her.
He said, "Je'lanthra'en,  you have been here your seven  days. What do
you think of your performance in that time?"
    Je'en  said, "Sir,  I really  cannot  answer that.  Firstly, I  am
rather too prejudiced  to judge my own fitness, and  secondly, I am no
judge of skill  in any case. I...I think that  I tried hard, but...was
probably not good enough to be taught here."
    Morion  wore  a  thoughtful   expression  thruout  Je'en's  little
speech, and he  said when she was finished, "Well,  judge or not, some
of what you  said is true. You  did try hard. And, we  are judges, and
we all  think that you  may someday make a  very fine fighter,  and an
even better one if you train here, with us."
    Je'en's  elation was  echoed  in Morion's  twinkling  eyes as  she
jumped  up and  down,  and  flung her  arms  around  him. After  being
hugged for  a long time, he  disentangled himself from her,  and said,
"Put those  things back on -  you're doing first and  second drill for
at  least two  hours: we've  got  to strengthen  up that  left arm  of
yours.  Go,  get  busy,  you're  my   pupil  now,  and  I  don't  like
slackards!"  There was  no sting  in his  voice, tho,  and neither  of
their smiles lessened a bit as he helped her back into her armor.

    The first  thing she did, once  she was accepted, was  have a suit
of  practice armor  made  for her.  She  did that  for  two reasons  -
first, the loaner  set she had been using,  while adequate protection,
didn't fit  very well, and  looked really  silly; and second,  she had
an obstacle  to overcome aside from  her awkwardness: one of pity. All
during her  trial week, only  Ironfist and  Morion had treated  her as
an  equal, testing  her fairly  and objectively.  The other  students,
after seeing  the scar on  her face, and the  way clumsy way  she used
her  left hand,  began to  feel sorry  for her,  and treated  her very
gently,  like china.  So she  decided to  build for  herself an  image
that would  make the others  forget about her disabilities.  Thus: her
new armor,  flashy-green, ornamented, daunting in  aspect, and another
addition - a silver  half-face mask to match the one  on her helm, and
which she  never removed  except to  sleep (and  only when  alone). It
didn't take  long for the students  to replace the 'poor  thing' image
she had with that  of the formidable 'Green Blade' (as  she came to be
known, which was sometimes shortened to 'Greeny').
    And so the  months passed, almost unnoticed. She  was finding that
learning  to fight  was hard,  but also  exciting. And,  once she  got
used to  using her left  hand (which did take  a while), she  was good
at  it.  She became  Morion's  star  pupil,  and  the darling  of  the
school.  There were  few  women  in training  there,  but that  didn't
affect  her status  - rather  she attracted  a following  of the  same
type as  Ironfist had: people  who were  inspired by her  ability, and
wished her well for it.
    There  was  more to  do  than  fight,  too.  There was  the  other
training;  physical fitness,  riding, and  such, skills  to compliment
that of  the sword (or other  chosen weapon). There were  the chores -
tending the  garden that helped  feed the school, keeping  the citadel
clean and  in good repair, keeping  the practice armor and  weapons in
good  repair, too.  And,  aside from  work, there  was  fun, too.  She
learned  some games,  and listened  to  stories that  the others  told
(tho she  steadfastly refused  to tell  any of  her own).  She learned
that the citadel  was the ancestral home of Lord  Morion, and that its
name was Pentamorlo.  Many were the tales of that  House, and, tho she
burned to  tell some  that only she  seemed to know,  she kept  to her
resolve not to, fearing to venture anywhere near the realm of Barddom.
    Of  all  the  people  -  teachers, students,  and  servants  -  at
Morion's  school,  she  told  only  three her  full  story.  Two  were
Morion, and  Ironfist, and she  told them  for their kindness  to her,
and so that  they would know her  well enough to trust  her, and maybe
to like  her. Both were  sympathetic to  her pain and  sorrow, without
being  pitying. The  third  was a  young man  named  Timirin, who  was
usually  called Oak.  He had  been  Ironfist's student,  and was  near
'Fist's  equal  when  she  arrived.  Came the  time  for  Ironfist  to
graduate, Oak  sort of took  his place.  He took over  teaching Je'en,
going  at her  own pace,  but  never going  easy. In  time, they  grew
close, as  she never  had to anyone  as a Bard,  who usually  felt too
far  removed  from   other  people,  and  too  busy   to  cultivate  a
relationship  with  fellow Bards.  But,  she  was  free of  that,  and
Timirin  was handsome,  intelligent,  and an  excellent swordsman.  It
was easy  to fall in  love with  him, if love  it was. And,  one night
when they  were alone  in one  of the towers,  and he  began to  get a
little over eager, she  told him her story. If that  had been meant to
scare him off; it failed. They became faster friends, then lovers.
    But, they  were not in  love. Eventually, it  was time for  Oak to
leave, and  there wasn't enough between  them to persuade Je'en  to go
away  with  him.   He  had  helped  her immensely,   tho,  giving  her
confidence  in herself  as her  skill grew,  and she  thanked him  for
that, and then said farewell.
    She was  a very fast  learner. By the end  of her first  year, her
reflexes had been  retrained, and her left hand was  now as capable as
had been  her right. She had  all the basic moves  of sword-and-shield
and  single-sword  combat drilled  into  her  until they  were  second
nature. And  she had  begun to  learn special  defenses and  attacks -
those things  that lifted an  ordinary fighter  into the realm  of the
special.  She  learned the  'rooted'  technique,  wherein one  planted
oneself  in one  spot,  and  tried to  draw  strength  from the  earth
itself  to protect  and to  attack. She  also learned  the 'lightning'
technique, where one  stayed in one place as little  as possible. That
was a  variation of what  she had  originally learned, but  there were
subtleties that turned  mere swiftness of foot into  deadly force. And
there were  other techniques,  some named for  a phenomenon  of nature
that they  resembled, some named  for the  person who invented  it, or
made  it  famous.  Some  were  strictly for  defense,  some  only  for
attack, some  for certain special conditions,  some to be used  at all
times,  even with  other styles  and techniques.  She also  learned to
use  several other  weapons  well,  tho not  expertly  - mace,  staff,
polearm:  she  was limited  in  the  use  of  two handed  weapons,  of
course,  and  a  second  hand  weapon  as  well,  which  was  why  she
concentrated on the  simple sword, and shield.  Eventually, the shield
had to  go, because of  the time  it took to  put it on  properly with
her bad hand, so  she became even more expert in  single sword. By the
time  she ws  ready to  graduate,  she could  hold her  own in  single
combat,  even against  Morion's famed  double-sworded 'Windmill',  and
in a  melee, alone against  up to three, and  more if she  had someone
or  something to  protect her  back.  All in  all, in  just under  two
years, she  had become a  most accomplished Swordswoman, and  when she
graduated  form Morion's  school, she  went with  all honors,  and the
well wishing of all in Pentamorlo.
    Before she  left, she  discussed her plans  with Morion.  She told
him that  she intended to return  to Magnus, and join  the city guard.
Morion said, "That  is a noble idea,  but perhaps not a  good one. You
have spent  months here  creating for  yourself a  new life,  and have
been very successful, too. Magnus can only hold bad memories."
    "What else is there, then?" she asked.
    "Well, for starters, you could stay here and teach."
    Je'en smiled, and shook her head.
    "Okay, okay.  I know it  gets a little  dull around here,  and you
want to  do something  with your  youth. Why don't  you go  visit your
brother  in Dargon?  That is  a good  city for  adventure -  you could
join its guard, or  hire out with a caravan, or  on an exploring ship.
There's  plenty to  do in  a frontier  city like  Dargon. And,  if you
find nothing,  well, you'll  have had  a nice  visit with  family, and
you can move  on, even back to Magnus. But  give something different a
try, first. It'll be good for you."
    And, Je'en  took his advice.  When the ceremony of  her graduation
was over, she  mounted her packed and ready horse,  and rode away from
Pentamorlo to the northwest, and Dargon.
