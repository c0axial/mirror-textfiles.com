    Well, folks,  here it is:  the First Anniversary Issue  of FSFNet,
and  the  first  issue  containing   stories  of  the  Dargon  writing
project. I must say,  this is an impressive issue, and  I hope you all
enjoy it  as much as  I have enjoyed  putting it together.  The Dargon
project is  a group  of FSFNet contributors  who have  gotten together
to write about  a single location, much like  Aspirin's Thieves' World
project. And, as  you can see, the results are  phenomenal! Any people
who  are interested  in  joining the  project and  feel  they will  be
productive, feel  free to mail  me. I'd also  like to welcome  the new
readers who responded  to the notice I sent out.  I'm not sure whether
to apologize  or not  for the  extreme length of  this issue,  but I'm
sure you won't mind once you start reading...
    But, for now,  I suggest you sit  back and enjoy some  of the best
amateur  writing you  will  find on  BITNET. Thank  you  all for  your
support. Blessed be.

                           Welcome to Dargon!
    Dargon  is a  small, out  of  the way  fiefdom of  the Kingdom  of
Baranur, situated in  the extreme northwest corner of  the kingdom. It
is separated from the  rest of the kingdom by a vast  wood and a minor
range  of hills,  and  is  ruled by  the  young  Lord Clifton  Dargon.
Dargon Keep,  where the  wealthy merchants  and courtesans  live, lies
on a hill  overlooking the town and  port of Dargon, which  lie at the
mouth of  the River Coldwell.  The port is  Dargon's only link  to the
more populated  south, and the  town is an  active and busy  place. In
the  fields  of  Dargon  can  be  found  many  small  farming  peasant
villages, that pay  tithes to the Keep. Quaint  and pittoresque, these
villages lie on  the very borders of civilization, and  can be hotbeds
of superstition as well as gateways to adventure.
    Come  follow,   whether  your  pleasure  be   politics  and  court
intrigue,  the  devilish workings  of  a  medieval port-town,  or  the
horror  and adventure  of the  hinterlands. Come  follow the  tales of
wonder and woe that unfold before you, in Dargon.

                              Simon's Song
    Dale ran  breathlessly down the  Street of Travellers  towards the
docks. His father had  told him to read two whole  lessons;  being the
son  of a  scribe wasn't  the  most exciting  life in  the world.  His
father,  a well-known  teacher and  scribe named  Cavendish, made  his
living by  hiring out to  teach youngsters how  to read and  write. He
had left  the fourteen year-old  in the  family library while  he went
to Dargon Keep  to instruct some poor aristocrat's son.  Dale knew his
father  had  meant  well,  but  there were  other  things  to  do  all
afternoon than read  some old dry book. Besides, he'd  be back in time
to read most of his assignment, anyways.
    He turned the  corner by Sandmond's, nearly  capsizing an emerging
sailor (listing  five degrees to  port), and scanned the  dockside for
the familiar  red and white canopy.  Finding it, he plunged  back into
the crowd  and made for a  warehouse at the  far end of the  quays. He
pushed through  the mob of  sailors, soldiers, and  merchants, finally
coming  within  sight   of  his  destination,  a   squeaky  old  cart,
overloaded with  three steaming kettles,  attended by a  tall, smiling
man  and his  little  monkey. A  sign on  the  cart read  'Salamagundi
Stew' in large letters.
    The youth  slowed and yelled  across the crowd, "Hey, Simon!"  The
tall man saw Dale and waved him over.
    "Hey, Dale!  What you doing  out so early?  Did you Papa  give you
too much  to read, eh?"  The tall sailor smiled broadly and batted the
young man on the shoulder.
    "Yeah,"  sighed the  lad.  "How's Skeebo?"  he  asked, bringing  a
sweetmeat forth from his cloak to offer the monk.
    "Oh, he's  fine. Business is good,  and look at the  port! It's so
busy!" He spread  his arms to take  in all the port  area. Dale looked
up after  giving Skeebo his  treat and  surveyed the port.  The crowds
were  thicker  than  ever,  and  there were  several  tall  ships  and
galleys tied  up along  the docks.  He knew the  Angelique at  the far
end, and Captain  Smith's Victory Chimes beside it. Right  in front of
the warehouse  was a galley  that Dale had  never seen before,  with a
great  deal  of  bustle  on  deck  and  a  number  of  strange  papery
ornaments hanging in the rigging.  "What ship is that?  Is it from the
south?"
    "Ah..." began  Simon, a glint  in his  brown eyes. "I  checked 'er
out before.  She's called  the Singing  Mermaid, and  she's been  on a
long,  long  voyage. She  left  Baranur,  down south...  must've  been
nearly two  years ago. Headed  west, of  all places!" Simon  was aglow
with  the rapture  of a  bard  revealing a  tale.  "They  say this  is
their first  landfall since  they left a  place called  Bichu,  across
the western  ocean. They say  they've got  some sort of  western noble
who paid  them well to  bring him here. Wonder  what would make  a man
pay such a high price to leave his home, eh, lad?"
    While  Dale listened,  he dipped  himself a  bowl of 'regular', as
Simon called  the first of the  three varieties of stew  he sold. Dale
had often listened to Simon's tale of how he had learned the recipe for
Salamagundi  Stew while  he was  serving as  a cook  on a  galley many
years  ago. The  stew  itself  was a  sort  of  fish chowder,  heavily
seasoned,  and the  'regular' was  fairly good.  Dale had  never tried
either of  the other stews  - Simon had  always steered him  away from
them with a laugh.
    The  young man  looked up  and contemplated  the Singing  Mermaid.
There  were  a number  of  large  crates  sitting  on deck,  and  many
strangely-colored  paper  ornaments  hanging  from  the  yardarm.  The
captain   came   from   below   deck  and   stood   talking   with   a
strangely-dressed man  who could  not have been  any taller  than Dale
himself. He  nudged Simon  and nodded towards  the ship.  Simon's eyes
widened. "Yep.  Must be that  westerner... Let's  go get a  good look,
eh, lad?"  With that Simon slowly  hauled his cart closer  to the pier
where  the Singing  Mermaid was  tied up.  Dale watched  the foreigner
order another  man to gather  some chests and  boxes and make  his way
down  the   gangplank,  the   poor  servant,  overburdened   with  the
foreigner's gear, close behind.
    The stranger  was a young man,  though perhaps five or  more years
older than  Dale, but  no more  than an  inch or  two taller  than the
scribe's son. His  clothing was strangely decorated in  blue and white
shapes  that Dale  had to  think twice  about to  understand, and  his
robe hung  about his  body very oddly.  Dale could see  that he  had a
slight limp, and  carried a very strange and  wicked-looking sword in,
of  all things,  a wooden  sheath! Dale  saw the  stranger stop  for a
moment  and look  around,  a dark  expression on  his  face, and  turn
towards Simon. The youth hurried to catch up.
    Simon set his  cart down and waited for the  stranger to approach,
carefully inspecting  and gently stirring  each of the  three chowders
he had made  that morning. He had  been lucky to get  some spices from
the Singing  Mermaid's haul earlier in  the day, and he  was confident
it was  an excellent batch. The  foreigner walked directly to  him and
slowly, haltingly said, "Excuse, prease... You offer to sell food?"
    Simon  nodded  and replied  "Yes  -  stew! Three  kinds:  regular,
sweet, and  sun-sweet. It's  very good," he  added, lifting  the cover
from  one of  the pots  to let  the foreigner  know just  what he  was
about  to  purchase.   Simon  certainly  knew  enough   not  to  upset
travelling nobility.
    "Ah, very good. I would like the sun-sweet prease..."
    Simon  nodded and  carefully suppressed  a chuckle.  Sun-sweet was
the spiciest  of the  brews, and he  knew of only  two people  who had
ever been able  to finish a whole bowl: himself  and Guiseppi, the old
sailor-cook who  had taught  Simon how  to cook,  when he  was younger
than Dale.  He smiled to  the stern-faced stranger, dipped  a steaming
bowl of  regular, and offered  it to the  stranger. No sense  making a
scene, Simon thought.  He had travelled enough in the  west to realize
that he might have just saved his own life!
    The  man  took the  broth  with  a short  bow,  if  no smile,  and
reached within  his silken clothing,  producing two short  sticks with
which he  began to eat  the chunks of fish  from the broth.  Simon was
about to  congratulate himself on his  tact when he saw  Skeebo grab a
spoon from the  cart and thrust it at the  stranger, who slowly lifted
his eyes towards  the monk, to Dale, and finally  to Simon. Simon felt
his  stomach knot  in  worry. Suddenly,  the strangely-clad  foreigner
broke  out into  the  oddest  laughter Dale  had  ever witnessed.  The
stranger took the spoon  and gave the monk a small  coin in return. He
finished the chunks  of fish and began noisily sipping  the broth with
the spoon.  Simon knew that  the man had  probably never used  a spoon
before setting  foot on the  Singing Mermaid, though how  anyone could
go through life without using a spoon was quite beyond him.
    Skeebo went back  to Simon, looking sheepish as  any monkey could.
The sailor  took the  coin from the  monk, and an  odd look  came over
his face.  The westerner had  paid in gold!  It was a  strange looking
coin, but  it was probably  worth more than  Simon had made  all year.
He was obviously a noble, but he didn't seem quite that rich...
    The   stranger  had   finished  his   bowl,  and   seeing  Simon's
puzzlement in his face, he asked "The coin... is it not enough?"
    Simon,  more confused  than ever,  could not  speak for  a moment.
"It is  more than too much!"  he suddenly stammered, too  astounded to
even care that  he could live off  that small coin for  nearly a year.
He held  the coin  out to give  it back to  the foreigner,  who closed
the sailor's hand upon it.
    "I  am  Ittosai Michiya,"  he  began.  "I  have  left my  home  in
dishonor, and am far  from where I would be. I have  not been happy in
many months. Take the coin - is a smile not worth so much stone?"
    With  that, he  bowed low  and, with  a gesture  for his  baggage,
left Simon and Dale both rather puzzled.
    Simon soon was busy with customers again, and Dale wandered off to
look at the ships, including the Singing Mermaid.

    Simon had  given up. The port  was just too busy,  and he couldn't
keep up  with the  customers. His  mind kept  dwelling on  the strange
foreigner,  and he  found himself  looking at  the small  golden coin,
somtimes touching it  like a worry stone. It was  an interesting coin;
on one side,  an etching of a strangely shaped  building surrounded by
an even odder-looking  garden, on the other side  were strange letters
that  looked  like  chicken-scratchings.   Perhaps  he  would  get  it
changed and pay  rent. Perhaps he would buy Dale  something useful and
give it  to him during the  upcoming festival. Then again,  maybe he'd
just  tuck it  away in  case he  might  ever need  it; it  was a  very
attractive coin...
    Simon's  twenty-fifth  contemplation  of   the  strange  coin  was
interrupted by a familiar cry. "Hey, Simon!"
    "Hey, Dale!" After  going off to look at the  ships, the youth had
wandered up  along the coastline. Dale  came over to Simon's  cart and
chittered at Skeebo as only a child would. "Guess what, Simon?"
    "There's a world outside Dargon?" Simon smiled.
    "No, silly,"  responded Dale,  "I've found  something while  I was
walking up the coast."
    "The ocean?"  Simon asked, still sarcastically smirking.
    In answer,  Dale brought forth a  small bundle from his  tunic. He
had  wrapped something  in  a wool  cloth, and  he  unwrapped it  very
carefully to reveal  what looked like a carving that  had been covered
with sand and seaweed.
    "What is it?"  Simon was curious.
    Dale  carefully picked  the seaweed  away and,  with a  handful of
water  from a  nearby rain  barrel,  washed off  the stone  carefully.
What  was revealed  was  a  small sculpture  of  Dargon Keep,  crudely
done, but made  in ivory, the unmistakeable three  towers rising above
a  walled section  of town.  Simon's  eyes widened,  then seemed  very
far. Then he came  back, smiled at Dale, and said,  "What a find, lad!
I'd hang onto that, if I were you."
    "Yeah. I'm going to keep it in my room. I think it's really neat!"
    "It  sure enough  is  that, lad.  Now  you run  home  and do  your
reading. We've had plenty of adventure for this day, eh?"
    "Yeah!" Dale  said as he  carefully wrapped the miniature  keep in
the  cloth. "Well,  see you  tomorrow,  Simon!" He  turned and  jogged
away, innocent of the expression on his older friend's visage.
    Simon  Salamagundi felt  old, perhaps  for the  first time  in his
young life.  Seventeen years  earlier, he  remembered, his  mother had
apprenticed  him to  a sculptor,  thinking Simon  had artistic  hands.
His father,  Seth Salamagundi,  had been a  sailor, and  Simon's blood
came from his  father's line. One afternoon, he had  sat by the ocean,
trying desperately to  live up to others expectations  of him, carving
a small  ivory model of  Dargon Keep. It  had looked so  horrible that
he hurled it  as far into the sea  as he could throw it.  He ran home,
wrote a note for  his mother, and hired himself out  to ship's cook on
the Lilith. That  was the end of his landboundedness,  the last he saw
of his mother, and the end of his childhood.
    Over the years,  the memory of that piece of  ivory had meant many
things to  Simon. When he  was young,  he had hated  it, for it  was a
symbol of his  mother's attempts to keep him home,  and his failure to
live up to  the expectations of others. During his  many years at sea,
he  had both  loved it  as a  symbol of  his freedom  and success  and
hated it still  for the failure associated with it.  Now he could only
look back  at the wealth  of emotion attached  to the object  and feel
all that he had gone through once more, and cry.

                               Rendezvous
    The  aging   alchemist  Gilman  awaited  an   appointment  with  a
customer,  but that  did not  make the  mysterious, nocturnal  visitor
any  more  welcome. His  silver  however  was,  and Gilman  knew  well
enough  not to  inquire too  deeply into  its source.  It rankled  him
that respectable  patrons were  so rare  these days  with the  rise of
the mystic  cult Masgrah, which  seemed to  be developing into  a full
blown hanse.  The members, which  included most of the  aristocracy of
the city  of Magnus, were forbidden  to deal with outsiders  except as
absolutely  necessary. Gilman  refused  to give  into these  ecomonmic
coercions but unless he did something soon his business would fail.
    His  eminent customer's  medicinal  orders were  some  of the  few
means of  support he could  find in  his toubled situation,  tough the
covertness often  bothered Gilman. Gilman  had wondered about  the man
since  he had  first entered  his laboratory  almost a  year past.  At
first appearance  the youth seemed  to be among the  riffraff commonly
encountered in  the poorer sections  of any  city the size  of Magnus.
He appeared  unwashed, unkept,  and half-starved; his  clothing little
more than  rags. His face seemed  a battlefield of pox  scars. But the
feature  which repulsed  Gilman  most was  the  constant twitches  and
jerks  which  wracked  the  youth's frame.  Still,  he  possessed  two
qualities which did  not align with this image: money  and a classical
education.  Gilman  often worried  about  the  source of  funds  which
allowed  him to  acquire such  rare  ingredients at  what Gilman  well
knew  to  be  inflated  costs.  He had  been  similarly  astounded  to
glimpse the youth's  knowledge in classical science  and literature in
their  discussions.  So great  was  his  education that  Gilman  often
wondered why his  own services were required by the  youth at all. But
then  the  youth's unsteadiness  and  nervous  aggitation would  be  a
major  hindrance in  the laboratory.  The youth's  background was  one
mystery into  which this  well-meaning investigator  would not  pry as
he feared the prospect of losing such a monetary find.
    A gentle but  unrhythmic rapping roused Gilman  from his thoughts.
Approaching  the   barred  door,  Gilman  called   for  his  visitor's
identity.  The sole  answer "Atros"  was sufficient  passage into  the
alchemist's  combined  laboratory  and  home. The  youth  appeared  if
anything to be more nervous than normal.
    "You have completed  the Nepenthe of the  Mahedeos?"  Atros asked.
His articulation was so flawless that once again it startled Gilman.
    "I await  only the  second half of  the payment,"  Gilman answered
noticing the  strange expression in  the youth's  eyes. "It is  by far
the strongest nepenthe  that I have ever compounded.  Its potency will
surely  overcome the  tolerance which  you  seem to  be developing.  I
promise that  your sleep will be  both deep and undisturbed  by dreams
if  you  imbibe  in  this 'Little  Death'."  Gilman  chuckled  lamely,
growing uncomfortable.
    "I'm  afraid that  I don't  have the  money yet,  but surely  some
arrangement could be worked out," Atros said with a rehearsed tone.
    "That  is not  according  to  our agreement  nor  my policy.  Full
payment on  reception of  the vial." Gilman  had already  promised the
youth's coins to a creditor by the following day.
    "Allow  me to  take it  and I  will have  your money  within three
days," Atros offered weakly.
    "No, I  cannot accept credit.  I cannot...." Gilman's  mind filled
with his eminent monetary troubles.
    "There is no other alternative?" Atros asked faintly.
    "No." Gilman responded hardly rising from his worries.
    The youth  seemed to be  taken by  a particularly violent  jerk of
his  right arm  which flew  toward  the old  man. In  a near  blinding
flash of motion,  Atros wedged a knife in the  old man's chest. Gilman
stared in astonishment,  gurgled once, and died.  Already beginning to
mentally curse  his impulse, Atros  removed the knife and  cleaned the
blade.  Not for  the first  time had  he tragically  let his  instinct
rather than his mind control his actions.
    "Fool! Coward!  Where will  I ever  find another  supplier!" Atros
shouted  at himself.  After  a moment,  "He was  just  a harmless  old
man..."  he mumbled  leaning over  the  body, accepting  yet one  more
burden of guilt.
    He   began  to   search   the  building   knowing  that   Gilman's
apprentices would  discover the  crime at  sunrise. He  easily located
both the  vial of  nepenthe and Gilman's  alchemical notes  and texts.
With  greater effort  he  found the  old  man's disappointingly  small
cache of  coins. Careful  so as  not to  be seen  he slipped  from the
building and returned to the hovel in which he was currently residing.
    Once there  he began to  consider his situation.  Surely, Gilman's
apprentices knew  of his nocturnal  visits. He would never  escape the
headman's block  if he  remained in  Magnus. He  resolved to  leave as
quickly as  he could  pack his meager  possessions, which  were mostly
comprised of  rare and coveted books  on a wide range  of subjects. He
was reluctant  to leave any  of his prizes  but he realized  that they
would  only  slow  him  down  in his  flight.  Quickly,  he  made  his
selections and  headed for the north  gate. He had heard  of a distant
port  near Dargon  where a  man might  lie low  for a  few months.  He
hoped that  such a  place could  cater to his  needs, but  he realized
that skilled  alchemists were  quite rare,  especially ones  who would
accept a  client as  unaristocratic as he  himself appeared.  He tried
to  convince  himself  that  his  change  of  residence  would  be  an
oppurtuntity to  begin anew, but he  had drifted too much  not to know
that you  always take yourself  along with  you. Within a  few minutes
he  slipped past  the  guards at  the northern  gate  and was  leagues
distant from the city by sunrise.
    A few hours  after sundown of the following day,  Atros sat near a
small campfire  in a secluded  grove far to  the north. Though  he was
very weary  he had  taken a  great deal  of time  preparing as  good a
meal  as possible  under the  circumstances.  Of course,  he had  only
attempted  to delay  the  inevitable.  Finally, he  lay  close to  the
small  fire huddled  in rags  and  slept for  the first  time in  many
days. Well  aware of the finite  supply of the nepenthe,  he had chose
not  to partake  of the  drug hoping  that the  weariness of  his body
would prevent dreaming. He had been wrong.

    Atros  didn't know  when he  first became  aware. The  environment
about him  had come  into being  quite gradually.  Perhaps it  was the
heat  of the  forge itself  which had  roused him.  Atros knew  almost
instantly that  this was a  dream, at least  it was what  other people
in the  waking world  called a  dream, though Atros  was no  longer so
certain of  the distinction.  He also quickly  realized that  this was
one  of   those  few  dreams  wherein   he  was  present  as   only  a
discorporate  observer. This  frightened him  since such  dreams, with
their innate feeling of helplessness, were often the worst.
    His point  of perception  was suspended about  three feet  above a
curiously crafted forge  or oven. It was a hollow  stone cube with two
opposing sides open.  Within the cube a bank of  red coals were fanned
by a  strange wind  which passed  through the  cube's open  faces. The
forge itself seemed  to be composed of a gritty,  brown rock which was
encrusted in soot.
    Atros  first  perceived  a  disturbance in  this  scene  with  the
sounds of  the approach of several  person who were beyound  his field
of  vision,   which  seemed   to  be   fixed  downward.   Shortly,  he
periferally  sensed a  dark,  muscular figure  who  examined the  coal
bed, grunted, and  placed a long, somewhat squared bar  of black metal
into the forge. The metal quickly grew red with firery intensity.
    After a  time, the man, whom  Atros took to be  the smith, removed
the brand,  placed it  atop the forge  and set to  striking it  with a
blunt,  iron   mallet.  Each   blow  seemed  vaguely   unsettling  and
disturbing to  the point  that Atros  mentally winced  in anticipation
of each strike.
    During  this  time  another  figure  beyound  Atros'  sight  began
speaking  to a  third.  He seemed  concerned that  the  metal was  too
imperfect to temper  it so harshly, but the third  voice reassured him
that  the alloy  was finer  than before  crafted and  that none  other
could fill their  purpose. This seemed to mollify the  second voice to
some extent but his voice retained a tinge of nervous anxiety.
    After what seemed  to have been an eternity  of excruciating blows
to  Atros, he  gained awareness  enough to  look upon  the product  of
these  labors.   He  was   astonished  to  discover   a  fantastically
beautiful,  silver brand  of  glossy smooth  finish  extending from  a
fine  point down  a double  edged shaft  to a  thin tang  bolt. Atros'
mind was awed  by this creation while the smith  wiped his sweaty grip
and brow on a soot-smeared rag.
    A  barely  perceived motion  suggested  that  one  of the  as  yet
unseen  figures had  given the  smith an  ornately carved  dark walnut
box, which  the smith fumbled  open. Inside  lay a fine  silver chisel
and a heavy  mallet made entirely from a single  casting of bone white
metal. Here  again, the voice  of the  second figure gave  caution. He
was unsure whether  the forthcoming action was  totally justified when
the dangers were  fully considered, but the third  reassured the smith
and set him about his task.
    Carefully,  the  smith   took  the  hammer  and   chisel  in  hand
positioning  the  chisel's tip  on  a  point  just below  the  sword's
point. He raised his  right arm and with a mighty  blow came down with
his   full  force   which   sent  fine   crack   through  the   forge.
Simultaneously,  Atros elsewhere  perceived the  astonished stares  of
grocers,  merchants,  and  midwives  to  a  single  clang  from  their
chapel's bell  tower, which for  centuries had  been used to  signal a
call  to arms.  This  dual  point of  awareness  was only  momentarily
disorientating  to Atros  as he  had  experienced the  like before  in
other  dreams.  Returning  to  the forge,  the  bewildered  Atros  saw
engraved on the  blade the entire word "Cogne", but  the smith was not
yet finished.
    Once again,  his hammer  rose and  fell but  with an  even greater
force which  further enlarged the  forge's flaw. Once again,  the high
noted  report of  the  barrel-shaped warning  bell  drew attention  of
distant farmers, herders,  and millers. The blade now  bore the highly
stylized word "Tu" at its mid-section.
    The  smith,  exhaustion  seeping  from his  pores,  stretched  his
frame  over the  hot forge  to impart  the last  engraved word  to the
haft.  For the  third and  final  time he  drew his  hammer high  with
incredible  slowness and  delivered it  with the  unmatchable strength
that arose  from the  last of  his reserves. As  the block  split, his
blow caused the  sword to leap outward lodging the  sword's point deep
within  his  abdomen.  Exhausted  by  his  efforts  the  smith  calmly
accepted death.  Simultaneously, the bells  of the church  tower broke
out in  a furious and  undying clangor  demanding action from  all the
denzines of the manor.
    Struggling  to keep  out  the clamor,  Atros  concentrated on  the
still visible haft  of the sword which rose from  the crumpled form of
the  smith. The  word  "Ipsem"  was firmly  engraved,  but Atros  also
noticed that  a fine crack ran  from this engraving to  the tang bolt,
where its  prescence might cause the  handle to snap in  its wielder's
grip at  some future date. Still,  the clangor of the  bells continued
as Atros drifted apart from this vision.

    After  some  moments, Atros  rolled  over  in his  sleep  somewhat
roused by  the bell.  "Who was  that? Dear." He  called to  the supine
form laying beside him in bed.
    "Wrong number... Go back to sleep," a rich feminine voice replied.
    Atros drifted into sleep once more.

    Atros awoke with  a startled cry jumping to his  feet and throwing
some  of the  begraggled  bedding  into the  smoldering  coals of  the
nearby campfire.  He was sweating  profusely though the night  air was
quite cold. Quickly,  he rescued what scraps he could  from the flames
and  croached  back   near  the  fire.  He  struggled   to  force  the
unpleasant recollections  of his dreams  from his mind. Aided  by that
natural psychological force  which seperates our dream  lives from our
wakeful lives  by forgetfullness, he  managed after an hour  to recall
only that  his dreams had been  most unpleasant. No longer  willing to
take such chances,  Atros quaffed a rather large dose  of nepenthe and
gradually  returned to  unconsciousness. His  final thoughts  lingered
on  the translated  phrase  which  occupied his  mind  long after  his
dream  had   been  forgotten.  Still,   he  recognized  that   he  had
considered  the phrase  vitally  important only  moments  ago. To  the
occasionally cynical  mind of  Atros, "Know  you yourself"  now seemed
just  a sample  of that  profound sounding  drivel which  streetcorner
philosophers fostered on  the unwary. It could not  be worth troubling
one's sleep  over so,  he let  this too pass  from his  mind. Gilman's
word, after  all, had been  good. Atros  experienced the sleep  of the
dead for the next nine hours.
    A few minutes  after Atros had administered himself  with the drug
and  safely  passed the  arms  of  Morpheus  without mishap,  a  black
cloaked figure  arose from the  brush at the  edge of the  fire light,
floated smoothly  across the  glen floor,  and stood  motionless above
Atros'  helpless  form.  It  stood thus  until  nearly  daybreak  then
glided into the nearby depths of the wood to wait yet again.

                                 Exile
    Michiya  awoke to  the cries  of sea  gulls in  the early  morning
hours  of his  last  day  at sea.  He  carefully  groomed himself  and
donned a pair of  stark white trousers. On top of this  he wore a blue
and white  patterned shirt.  About his  waist he  wrapped a  pale blue
sash  pinned  together  with  a  tiny ivory  figurine  of  a  Kitsune.
Through the sash he  thrust the swords given to him  by his father. As
he reached the door  of his small cabin he stopped  and looked back at
the black  lacquer case next  to his bed.  He turned around  and knelt
in front it with  his hand on the latch. After a  moment he lifted the
top and  reached under the  clothes to  remove the two  ancient swords
given  to  him  by  his  uncle  Sasaki as  he  left  home.  He  looked
longingly  at them  and eventually  told himself  'Michiya, you  are a
long  way from  home and  the  time has  come  for you  to accept  the
changes in  your life!  Put away  your boyhood  swords and  bear these
ancient blades with  the honor you deserve.' It was  the first time he
had borne  the two beautiful  swords since  receiving them as  he left
home. After  a short prayer to  the Storm God Susano-wo  for continued
good  sailing,  he went  out  on  deck. For  a  long  moment he  stood
watching the sunrise until  the mate called out to him,  'Good morning
Ittosai-san.'
    'Hai,' he whispered, 'totemo ii desu ne!'  Turning to the  mate he
called 'Good morning Stiben-san, when will we be arriving in Darugon?'
    Checking the  sun and the  colour of  the water, he  replied 'Just
before lunch  if the  wind holds  up. Why  don't we  go below  and get
something to  eat with the  night crew  before they eat  their foolish
heads off and leave nothing for us?'
    Taking Steven's  suggestion to catch  an early breakfast  with the
crew he  was treated  to a  meal of lightly  fried fish  and potatoes.
Potatoes were one  few thing he had found to  his liking since leaving
his  homeland  so  he  ate  with great  enjoyment.  Listening  to  the
sailors  talk of  their expected  docking later  that day  he realized
how  much he  missed  his  homeland. Weary  of  hearing their  foreign
tongue that he  had been forced to learn out  of necessity, he drifted
off into a reminiscence of his final good bye to his uncle.

    The bitter  winter winds  had swept  the dock  clean of  snow that
cold night in  Yoshida. The cold irritated the  freshly bandaged wound
in his  leg as  he stood  there waiting for  his uncle.  He considered
returning  to Osaka  and  facing  his enemies  rather  than leave  the
country. His  uncle insisted that this  was the only proper  course of
action  available to  him,  but leaving  hurt his  pride.  Just as  he
decided that was  exactly what he would do, he  saw his uncle approach
carrying a bundle under his arm.
    Kneeling before  his uncle  he said  'Uncle-san, my  apologies but
my sense of honor demands I return to Osaka and face the Itokawa clan.'
    His uncle,  Ittosai Sasaki,  replied 'You will  do no  such thing!
The  Itokawa clan  is  acting dishonorably  in  their attacks  against
you. They  send many of  their Samurai  after you, a  lone ji-zamurai,
just  because they  cannot accept  that  one of  their children  could
possibly be  defeated by you. Once  they capture you and  find out who
you are,  they will declare an  illegal blood feud on  our small clan.
I  will not  allow the  Ittosai clan  to be  destroyed to  salve their
hurt pride.  You have  acted honorably  all along,  it is  no dishonor
for you to leave  now and save your family. Go  now, and may Susano-wo
bless your travels.'
    'But uncle-san!'  he replied 'I do  not feel so very  honorable at
the moment. Why are they so respected, if they act so dishonorably?'
    Sasaki  thought   a  while   before  answering,  'They   are  very
powerful,  and they  aided the  new Shogunate  on its  rise to  power.
With such  credentials many things  are overlooked.' At this  point he
began unwrapping  the bundle at his  side. Inside was a  beautiful old
Dai-sho. Holding it  out to Michiya he  said 'I want you  to take this
and bear it  with the same honor your great  grandfather did after the
son of heaven, Emperor Go-Shirakawa, gave it to him with his blessing.'
    With  trembling hands,  Michiya accepted  the ancient  blades, but
said  'Uncle-san,  I cannot  accept  this  gift!  They belong  in  our
family shrine!'
    'Do not argue with  an old man on a cold night!  Take them now and
board the  ship.' With that  his uncle  turned around and  stalked off
into  the  night. Rising  stiffly  to  his  feet, Michiya  turned  and
boarded the foreign trade ship, The Singing Mermaid.

    His  reverie was  broken then  by the  yells of  the crew  as they
prepared to enter the  port. He went up on deck  and headed forward to
get out  of the crew's  way and get  a good look  at his new  home. It
wasn't  as  colorful  as  his  home back  in  Bichu  province  nor  as
spotlessly clean,  but it  could have  been worse.  Some of  the ports
that  they had  stopped in  to restock  their food  supplies had  been
smelly cesspools.
    As  they docked,  the Captain  approached, and  said 'Michiya-san,
the crew  has unshipped your  crates and is  ready to unload  them. As
you are new  to Dargon, I have  taken the liberty of  ordering them to
carry your  belongings to  a respectable  inn called  "The Inn  of the
Hungry Shark".  Thomas the bartender is  a friend of mine,  tell him I
sent you and he will make sure that you are treated with respect.'
    'Thank you Captain  Markus-san' Michiya replied with a  bow 'I was
wondering  where I  would stay  until I  became understanding  of this
place. I have enjoyed  the trip and the company of  you and your crew.
I would also like to thank you for teaching me your language.'
    'No  thanks  are necessary'  said  the  Captain.  'It has  been  a
pleasure to have you  on board these last few months. In  fact it is I
who should be  thanking you for your assistance in  dealing with those
pirates last  month. I usually  am able to go  for years with  no such
encounters, and  every time I  have had  an encounter I've  been lucky
to drive them off.  Now I think it'll be quite a while  till I have to
worry again.'
    Looking rather  embarrassed Michiya  said 'It was  nothing, please
stop, such flattery  to my head will  travel. I not so  special am...'
At   this   point    Michiya  broke  off  in  confusion  and  further
embarrassment over his poor English.
    Saying good  bye to the  Captain, Michiya went ashore.  It finally
sunk  home to  him that  he was  in a  foreign land.  Nowhere that  he
looked, did  he see  any of  his people.  At this  point he  noticed a
brightly  colored wagon  with an  umbrella. The  owner was  a merchant
and was selling  some stew. Going over  to the wagon he  got some "Sun
Sweet" stew which  was quite good. Instinctively he had  brought out a
pair of hashi  to eat with, but  this seemed to offend the owner's pet
monkey. The  little creature  grabbed a  spoon and  thrust it  at him.
Not wishing  to offend to little  monkey any further, he  accepted the
spoon.  Handing over  a  gold koku  to the  little  monkey he  quietly
complemented it. 'Anata wa kawakute chisaii saru imasu ne!'
    His  comment  seemed  to  puzzle  the  monkey  who  was  obviously
pretending that  he didn't  understand. Taking his  leave of  the soup
vendor,  he thought  to  himself  that the  merchants  over here  were
definately an improvement  over the  ones'  back in  Nihon. Back  home
they grubbed  for anything they could  get and had no  self respect at
all.  The  crew  members  carrying  his  supplies  brought  him  to  a
reasonably clean  and tidy inn. Here  he was introduced to  Thomas the
bartender. After  finding out who had  sent him, Thomas set  him up in
a small but nice room on the second floor.
    After  a short  rest,  Michiya  went back  down  stairs and  asked
Thomas to explain the Dargon monetary system to him.
    Thomas sighed  and began to explain  the long sad story  as he saw
it. 'At  first there  were only  two coinage systems  in use.  One was
the  Shapkan system  which  had  only two  types  of  coins in  modern
usage. The two  coins were of copper and silver.  The other system was
the  Baranur system  which had  three  basic coins.  These coins  were
gold marks,  silver rounds,  and copper  bits. The  copper coin  is of
the same  value as the  Shapkan copper, but  the silver coins  were of
different   worth.  Recently   though,  the   Rand  system   has  been
introduced by our  Lord Clifton Dargon to "simplify matters".  It is a
sort  of average  between the  two systems  and also  has three  basic
coins like  the Baranur  system. Once  again the  copper coins  are of
common value with all the  others, but the silver  coins are of  yet a
third new  value and the  gold coin is of  a different value  than the
Baranur gold mark.'
    Michiya  stood  there taking  this  in  thinking to  himself  that
'This is madness!  How could any one want more  than one money system?
One money  system alone  is bad  enough, but  three will  surely cause
greed and  hatred.' Michiya thanked Thomas  for his help and  went out
for some  sight seeing. During his  wanderings he passed by  a farmers
market  where   he  bought  some   cucumbers.  Back  home   they  were
considered a  delicacy and  he hadn't had  any for a  long time  so he
was quite happy  when he returned to  The Inn of the  Hungry Shark for
dinner. Michiya spent  the next few days in somewhat  the same manner,
though he  was constantly on  the look out  for something he  could do
to  support himself  in  an  honorable fashion.  He  realized that  he
could not live  forever on the cash  that he brought with  him and was
quite concerned with his future.
    One night as  he was taking his evening walk  after dinner Michiya
wandered  into  one of  the  seedier  sections  of town.  Having  been
warned  by Thomas  that thieves  and cutthroats  were known  to attack
people from  time to time  in the area, he  was on his  guard. Shortly
after passing a  dark and smelly alley way he  heard a sudden stealthy
sound behind  him. Without pausing  to look, Michiya spun  about while
dropping to his  left knee and drawing his katana.  Just as he dropped
he  heard the  sound of  a  thrown dagger  pass right  over his  head.
Silently muttering  a brief thanks  to Hachiman,  he rose to  meet the
rush of  the attacking  thief. The  thief didn't  look too happy about
the turn  of events, but had  already committed himself to  the attack
with his  charge. Michiya turned  a parry  of the thief's  first swing
into a wheel  stroke, expecting the fellow to jump  back and avoid the
swing. Instead his  attacker tried to parry but was  hopelessly out of
position.  The swing  cut  through the  thief's left  arm  and made  a
shallow  cut in  the side  of  his chest.  Dropping the  sword with  a
scream the thief  grabbed at the stump  of his left arm  and stared at
it in disbelief.  Michiya was also shocked. He had  been told that the
local  thieves were  reasonably  skilled in  weapons  and had  assumed
that they  would all know the  only possible response to  such a basic
attack.  He hadn't  wanted to  kill or  even seriously  maim the  man,
only  wound him  slightly to  drive  him off.  The thief  fell to  his
knees  and  begged  'Please  don't   kill  me!  Here,  I'll  give  you
everything I have!'
    Michiya noted that  the man was going to pass  out from blood loss
any minute  now, so  told him 'Keep  your money and  your life.  I had
only intended  to try to  scare you off and  am now ashamed  at myself
for  my failure.  Take this  as a  token of  my sorrow  over what  has
happened here tonight.'  With that statement Michiya tossed  the man a
small  gold koku  and  turned away.  The thief  stared  numbly at  the
small  gold coin  still disbelieving  what was  happening. Shakily  he
reached out,  picked up the coin,  slipped it into his  belt pouch and
staggered of into the night clutching at his arm.
    As Michiya  stood there wondering what  to do, he heard  the sound
of many  running footsteps approaching. Thinking  that more assailants
were on the way  he began to step into darkness  when he realized that
it was the  city guard. Shaking off the blood  from his sword, Michiya
sheathed it and stood there calmly in the middle of the street.
    Six  men in  uniform came  running down  the road.  Three of  them
immediately  surrounded him  and  two  of the  others  spread out  and
started searching the  area. The last man, who seemed  to be in charge
came over to Michiya and asked 'Who are you sir and what went on here?'
    'Ittosai Michiya I am' he replied 'I was just by a thief attacked.'
    At this  point one of the  searchers came running up  with the arm
and  sword of  the  thief  who had  attacked  him.  He approached  the
officer  and pointing  in the  direction of  the fight  said 'Sir!  We
found these over there by that alley.'
    Unshuttering his  lantern, the  officer inspected the  sword. With
a start  of surprise, the  officer exclaimed 'This is  Captain Koren's
sword. It  was stolen  from him a week  ago!' With  this he  turned to
Michiya and  said 'Sir, I apologize  for the rude manner  with which I
initially  treated you.  In this  neighborhood we  have to  assume the
worst about  anyone we don't know.  I am Kalen Darklen  and am pleased
to meet you.'
    Michiya noted that  the soldiers relaxed as he replied  with a bow
'I  am  honored  to  meet  you  Kalen-san.  Unduly  impolite  for  the
situation, you and your men I did not find'.
    They chatted  pleasantly for  a while  and eventually  Michiya was
invited  back  to  the  barracks  near  the  Keep  to  return  Captain
Koren's  sword.  Michiya  was  initially  hesitant  to  go  there  and
embarrass the man  in such a fashion.  After all losing a  sword was a
horribly  embarrassing  thing.  Kalen  reassured him  that  it  wasn't
quite that bad of an embarrassment here in the west.
    Eventually Michiya  returned to The  Inn of The Hungry  Shark with
an escort this time, went to bed, and dreamt of home.
