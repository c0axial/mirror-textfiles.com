    Well,  hello,  and  welcome  to the  roleplaying  game  and  other
assorted miscellany issue  of FSFnet! Included in this  issue you will
find some  interesting gaming-related  articles, including  an article
by a  gentleman who has  designed a  rather extensive PBM  game. There
are  also a  few  odd  tidbits, including  an  extra  story by  Joseph
Curwen. Issue  VOL5N02 will be  out very  soon after you  receive this
issue,  and  will  return  to   the  Dargon  project  with  some  more
excellent  fantasy  fiction  by  BITNET  authors.  I'd  also  like  to
mention  that we  might  be losing  some of  our  Dargon authors,  and
would like  to encourage readers  who dabble  in writing to  try their
hand at  writing a Dargon story.  It is, after all,  a writing project
for the authors, and an excellent writing exercise.
    As  for news,  there is  some. New  books are  appearing left  and
right,  as well  as reprints,  so I  would suggest  that people  check
several bookstores  for their favorite  authors, and perhaps  some new
ones. Also,  I highly  recommend  the Bowie/Henson  movie "Labyrinth".
Although the  plot is  a little  bit contrived,  the remainder  of the
film is well  worth the admission price. Bowie was  highly bearable in
his role as  Goblin King, and Henson created some  effects that really
shake you  up. I would  go see the movie  twice or three  times simply
to appreciate the action. Excellent film.
    But on to the  meat of the matter, an issue  dedicated to the fine
art of  roleplaying gaming. Enjoy,  and we'll see  you in Dargon  in a
couple weeks!

                          Complete Game Design
    There  are four  aspects of  every roleplaying  game that  must be
properly coordinated and  supervised by the gamemaster to  result in a
successful game  or campaign.  In this short  article I  shall attempt
to share some of what I have learned in my gamemastering experiences.
    The first  and most basic step  in any game is  choosing what game
rules  system to  use.  There are  virtually  countless rules  systems
available  commercially,  and  most  gamemasters feel  that  they  are
sufficient  for  their  purposes.  Some gamemasters  decide  that  the
rules  are  acceptable with  minor  modifications.  A few  gamemasters
eventually   undertake  to   create  their   own  rule   systems.  All
gamemasters, however  must choose  between these  options, and  I have
developed some  criteria by which  gamemasters may choose  the systems
they use. Firstly,  the gamemaster should know what he  wants from the
system, weighing  elements he desires  to incorporate and  elements he
wishes to  avoid. Special  attention should be  given to  the tradeoff
between realism and  playability. Finally, the best  way to understand
the  shortcomings  and  strengths  of   a  game  is  to  playtest  it.
Playtesting is  one of the strongest  tools of the game  designer, and
is  the  proving  grounds  for the  system.  Overall,  an  intelligent
choice   of  game   systems,   be  they   commercially  available   or
self-designed, is a critical point in game design.
    The second  aspect of a game  which must be addressed  is the game
locality  and  environment. THis  includes  the  layout of  the  land,
geographical  features, maps,  towns,  NPCs, and  so  forth. The  best
policy to create  an environment is to start  small. Often gamemasters
start  out by  drawing entire  continents, and  run into  trouble when
play  concentrates on  a smaller  scale. Detailed  maps are  excellent
tools, and  accomplish the dual  purposes of arousing  player interest
and avoiding the creation of generic "areas" that lack in detail.
    Thirdly  is  scenario design;  the  adventure.  When designing  an
adventure,  keep  the  players  interest  in  mind.  Bring  the  party
together  in  a   logical  and  believable  manner.  As   soon  as  is
convenient,  grab their  interest  by  giving them  a  major event  to
think  over. For  example,  they  find out  that  several people  have
disappeared from their  town. This will give the  players something to
think about  and a  purpose to  unite them. As  the major  plot builds
up,  throw in  minor  subplots  (ie they  find  out  that the  trusted
sheriff is  a werewolf), leading up  to the climax of  the major plot.
For each adventure,  there is a time  to think and a time  to act, and
your players  should not be confused  as to which is  which. A balance
of  "think'n'sweat"  and  "hack'n'slash"  will  keep  everyone  happy.
During each  session your players  should feel a sense  of achievement
or gain, as  well as some doubt at the  mess they've gotten themselves
into. The  purpose of the  game is to make  your players feel  some of
the  emotions of  their  characters, and  to  suspend their  disbelief
just enough. A well designed scenario is a major factor in this.
    The  final  point  is not  an  aspect  of  the  game, but  of  the
gamemaster.  As  gamemaster, you  must  carefully  implement the  game
system, the environment,  and the scenario to have  a successful game.
Your   performance  in   actually  running   the  game   can  make   a
badly-designed  game exciting,  or a  well-designed game  a flop.  THe
first  thing  to remember  is  to  know  the  game system.  Having  to
constantly page through  rules detracts from the  players enjoyment of
the  game, and  is  rather unprofessional.  Keeping  things moving  is
very important.  Waiting for the  players to  stumble upon a  key clue
is futile  and aggravating for  the players.  It is also  important to
not be predictable in  what you do. Players who know  what you will do
are bored players.  Finally, make the players play the  roles of their
characters. That's what roleplaying is all about.
    A  careful  management  of  the game  system,  the  campaign,  the
scenario,  and  your gamemastering  style  will  result in  successful
all-around game  design. Each aspect  has its pitfalls, which  must be
learned  to  be   avoided.  I  hope  that   sharing  my  gamemastering
experiences are of use to you in yours.

                          Origin of a "PBM" game
    I have  been involved in fantasy  gaming and, to a  lesser extent,
wargaming since  the late 60s when  I started dropping by  the old SPI
offices  in New  York  for  their Friday  night  playtest sessions.  A
number of  my friends also playtested  for SPI and some  of them, such
as Greg Costikyan,  went on to become professional  game designers. It
is  only natural  to want  to design  one's own  game after  seeing so
much  happen in  this  environment,  but I  always  found the  heavily
competitive style and the WW II orientation  of traditional  wargaming
uncomfortable.
    With the arrival of  D&D in late 1974 I found a  medium in which I
was comfortable working,  and have  been involved  in running  various
rolegames ever  since. Edi Birsan, another  NY area gamer with  a more
wargaming bias,  changed his campaign from  face to face to  a fantasy
wargame/miniatures campaign (reversing the  evolutionary path  of D&D)
which many  NY area  players found interesting. Unfortunately it had a
strong flavor  of gamesmaster intervention which was generally felt to
be a "bad thing."
    Most of my  effort (and that of our group)  went into evolving our
local rules systems first  from D&D and the later our  own design in a
project for SPI, part of  which was eventually degenerated  into their
RPG,  Dragonquest. The  idea  of a  "play  by mail"  style  game in  a
fantasy envrionment  continued to  intrigue me.  Last summer  a couple
of my  friends who were  playing in a  number of commercial  PBM games
suggested that  it would be interesting  to do our own  game. The idea
immediately appealed  to me but I felt that it had  to be designed for
computer   moderation   from  the   begining.   After   a  couple   of
brainstorming sessions we agreed on a number of game principles:

       Each player would BE a single character in the world

       Every  character  or unit  could  only  control up  to  FIVE
       other   characters,   units,   or   provinces,   but   those
       characters  or   units  could  control  up   to  FIVE  other
       characters, or units, or provinces, etc

       No  control  would  be  perfect and  permanent  but  we  are
       playing  a  fantasy game,  not  Computer  Illuminati, so  it
       would not  be easy to seize  control of a fifth  of player's
       entire hierarchy of control

       While a unit  remained loyal then command  and control would
       be perfect (telepathy is a wonderful spell)

       Each  character would  have skills  which could  be improved
       over time and new skills could be learned

       The  game would  be set  in an  Earth-like  world where  the
       technology was  that of the  middle ages, magic  worked, and
       intelligent species other than humanity existed.

       The basic turn would be one month

       A person,  unit, stack of  units, or province  could execute
       one order per month

       A lone  rider on  horse back could  cover four  provinces in
       one month if not attacked

       The  game would  be  entirely computer  moderatable with  no
       human  intervention   in  the  adjudication   of  individual
       orders needed  (i.e. no special  orders; if it's worth doing
       it's worth making a part of the program)

       There is  limited information  about the world,  the actions
       of other players, and the exact values of the various skills

       More information could be discovered in the course of play

       The    multi-player   diplomatic    aspects   and    limited
       information would provide the major initial challenges

       A  player need  not fight  for "world  domination" to  enjoy
       playing;  movement and  combat should  be credible  for both
       armies and small parties of adventurers

       The wargaming aspects  would be done first  since they would
       draw more people into the game

       New  rules modules  and thus  activities and  playing styles
       will be added transparently

       New players can join at any time

       People and  places are  basically the  same things  and many
       of  the same  options apply  to both,  thus you  can control
       a city  directly  and  it in turn  may have  mercenary units
       working for it.

    It  turned out  that I  was the  only one  of the  designers in  a
position to  code extensively  so I  ended up  writing the  entire 12k
lines  of C.  I chose  "portably written"  C rather  than LISP  as the
implementation  language  to  insure  that  the  game  would  be  very
portable, there  would be adequate fast  implementations available for
the  top  of  the  line   microcomputers   on  which  the  game  would
eventually have to live  if it worked well enough to  move it beyond a
hobby  project. My  general goal  would  be for  it to  expand to  the
point that it can  be run be a NY area game  company as a "for-profit"
project  and  I   can  stop  having  to  run  the   turns  myself  and
concentrate on development.
    This winter I felt the program was solid  enough  that  I  started
collecting  local playtesters.  The first  six turns  were run  weekly
but as  people gradually came to  want longer turn deadlines  we moved
to biweekly  turns. Then  people wanted  more actions  so I  moved the
basic action  from units of  a month with four  weekly movement/combat
phases to  units of  a week,  with some actions  taking more  than one
unit.  The  underlying  implementation  of  time  was designed  to  to
handle very small  quantums of action since I  felt uncomfortable with
large turns containing  many smaller phases and  more comfortable with
actions  taking  place  in continuous time.  Breaking  the  monolithic
month required only changing a couple of constants.
    With the  move to a longer  turnaround it became possible  to have
players not  within shouting distance  and I solicited some additional
playtesters  using the  Usenet newsgroup  net.games.frp. We  currently
have 21  active playerships and perhaps 14  semi-active ones.  Many of
the more  active players  are network players  since they  have faster
communications than  even some  of the  "face-to-face" players  do. It
has  been interesting  watching the  flow  of message  from player  to
player  as  initally  everyone  took advantage  of  the  anonymity  of
messages sent  though the gamesmaster  and the newsletter  rather than
simply exchanging phone  numbers and addresses. In the  last few turns
the  communications rate  has climbed  steadily as  one player  seized
the  capitol   and  others  began  aligning   themselves  against  his
position. As  I send  this off  the Game is  turning the  year counter
over.  People are  now  writing orders  for the  first  "lune" of  the
second  year of  play. One  effect of  the continuing  nature  of  the
playtest is  that players continue to  join the game as  time goes on.
To  adjust for  the inital  position effect  the starting  resources a
player  was given  increased steadily  over the  first seven  turns to
compensate for not  being able to submit moves for  the earlier turns.
Some players  are also being placed  on a second land mass to separate
them from  then rather messy war  starting on the mainland  until they
get their sea legs,  as it were. (Most players take  a couple of turns
to get the feel for how things are done.)
    Lately  my  efforts  have   been  divided  fairly  evenly  between
expanding  the world  by  adding additional  places  and NPCs;  adding
documentation such as  lore sheets on provinces,  players, and skills;
and, expanding  the basic  game options by  adding additional uses for
skills, enhancing  the underlying economic  model and sections  of the
game that are only  now being used (the first player  ship on the high
seas prompted  me to finish  the "Storms at  Sea module", and  add new
major  modules. The  current  big project  is  the Heroic  Adventures,
random  encounter sequences  which  present  options  for actions  and
support for attacking Dragons with one Hero rather than one Legion.
    We  lost a  few  players when  the spring  term  ended at  several
schools.  It is  time to  add a  some additional  players with  stable
network access. If anyone wants to contact me I can be reached at:

         UUCPnet:                {ihnp4,seismo,...}!cmcl2!tihor
         ARPAnet:                TIHOR@NYU-ACF1 or TIHOR@NYU
         BITnet:                 TIHOR@NYUACF

    Copies  of the  setup package  are  available on  request but  are
fairly lengthy  to send  over UUCP  links. They can  be picked  up via
anonymous  FTP from  NYU.ARPA  (or  NYU.EDU) as  ~ftp/pub/tihor/rules.
The  current newsletter  is .../tihor/newsletter  and is included with
setups.  The costs  for network  turns are  negligable so there is  no
charge for  people getting their turns  in person or by  e-mail but it
is recommended that most  network players  send me  a couple  of SASEs
for hand  written responses if they  include an ad in  the T'NYC Times
(the newsletter) which  solicit  responses since some  players will be
giving me handwritten replies.

                             Nuclear Autumn
    In the last  days of a decadent race, the  eternal children sought
what tawdry  pleasures they  could, well  knowing but  never realizing
that their  time was nearly  at an end.  These were the Glorious Days,
filled with  all the myth and  wonder of Man's devising.  And myth and
wonder there  were. So much  so that a man  might live out  his entire
life, which could  no longer be adequately measured  in years, without
perceiving even  the slightest  hint of the  cold realities  which had
faced  their  historical predecessors.  No  pleasure  palace of  Kubla
Khan could  compare with the  vast panorama  of delusion in  which Man
had  enfolded  himself.  In  truth,   the  commonalities  of  such  an
existence would  have caused  even the most  tainted of  Sultanates to
blush.  But of  course, the  act of  blushing itself  had grown  to be
only  the  vaguest  of   myths,  half-heartedly  sought  by  countless
numbers of  pleasure seekers who  were incapable of conceiving  of any
emotion  leading  to its  expression.  Life  had reached the bounds of
Man's finite imagination, but still the populace desired more.
    It was  inevitable. The  sensual pleasures  had been  exploited to
their  fullest.  The  intellectual   pleasures  had  long  since  been
abandoned as  requiring such great  an effort for such  small returns.
Looking  back across  those  final years,  one  recognizes the  odious
progression  of those  dissatisfied with the ability  to define  one's
own existence  with such precision.  One sees  a steady growth  in the
numbers  of  those who  desired  hardships and  death, and  those  who
wished  to savor  the things  that  the society  constructed by  their
forefathers had forbidden  them.  Perhaps it all  arose naturally from
the destructive  instinct in Man,  which while carefully  channeled by
society  into  acceptable  forms  could only  achieve  the  palest  of
expressions.  Society  had  done  its best  to  compromise  with  this
force,  providing more  and  more outlets  of  outre expression  which
would  have  shocked any  sane  individual  of  another age.  But  the
attractions of  the forbidden  were felt  in much  greater proportions
by  those unused to any  form of  self-discipline.  There could  be no
compromise.
    Small  sects of discontents arose and grew  in  number until  they
encompassed  the greater  part  of the  entire  population. They  were
dissatisfied with  mechanized life  and  sought  refuge in  artificial
wildernesses,  harkening   back  onto  the  mythical   days  of  their
ancestors when  Man vied  directly with  Nature in  continuous combat.
But  it  was  not enough,  as  as  they  knew  that they  were  in  an
instant's  communication  with  great  mechanized  forces  capable  of
easily overcoming  any task,  there could be  no full  appreciation of
the  struggle to  survive.  As long  as  any man  had  access to  such
devices, their day to day victories in the "Wilderness" shown shallow.
    And  so after  a long  period  of fruitless  pursuit, an  unspoken
resolution formed  in the  minds of  each and every  man. Man  must be
freed from his  devices, freed to struggle once more  in a world where
the  combat  was   meaningful,  a  world  with   obstacles  worthy  of
challenging Man  once again.  But turning off  the machines  would not
be  enough, not  so long  as they  could be  reactivated. To  free Man
would  require  that  society  and   its  machines  were  totally  and
irrevocably destroyed.  This presented  Man's first real  challenge in
centuries for  the devices  of Man's society  had been  constructed to
withstand any mishap  unscathed. They could not be  averted from their
continuous and ever present functioning.
    Man  puzzled long  over this  dilemma without solution, until  one
day a  very unfashionable elder,  who had  chosen to seek  pleasure in
the lost knowledge  of Man's history, struck upon  a forgotten record.
It seemed  that in  the days  long before  civilization, Man  had done
violence  unto himself  in massive  numbers. The  very concept  was at
once unbelievable and  exciting to these souls  trapped into passivity
by  their societial  machine. But  even more  than this,  it presented
hope. In some  forgotten era of the race, Man  had constructed engines
capable  of destruction  well  beyond  even  their own  comprehension.
Man's  fear had  caused these  engines to  go unused  and unremembered
but  not untended.  As was  the practice  of all  the Great  Builders,
these  engines of  violence were  perpetually maintenanced by machines
which would last until Armageddon.
    Here at  last was a solution.  There was no discussion.  They were
driven  by  their desperation,  knowing  there  was nothing  to  lose.
Resolutely, the  masses uncovered the  engines of destruction  and set
them  about their  inevitable course.  They awaited  hopeful of  their
outcome, hopeful of escape.
  And Man looked upon a new day....a new beginning.

                   ELFQUEST the Roleplaying Game (tm)
                  Companion I and The Sea Elves Review

    This was  intended to  be a  short review of  the new  gaming aids
for  Elfquest players  by Chaosium,  but in  discussion with  others I
found that  the one  thing  all  of us  seem to  miss was  an extended
table  of  Contents  or  an index  of  sorts.  Personally  I lean  too
heavily  on such  things  when  learning  a  new  game,  from lack  of
familiarity or laziness or just  for  some  semblance  of  speed  when
trying to involve others in my scenario.
    When  the  Companion  came  out  in  August  I  had  hoped  for  a
compendium  of sorts, or perhaps a  gamemasters guide  to tables and a
quick reference  outline for character  generation. While it  was full
of information  both expected  and  desired,  there was no index. So I
made my own. At  the end of this article I'll list the  list  of "Poor
Richard's Index".  This is by  no means  exhaustive or complete,  as I
was only  attempting  to narrow  down  the areas  of info.  A complete
listing  would  include  the  Two  manuals,  the  Companion,  the  Sea
Elves, references  to the Quest ,  the Fanclub, and anything  else one
might find useful. That  is a tall order when the original idea was to
shorten reference time, not expand it.
    Podium  aside, I'll  get  onto  the review  at  hand. Firstly  the
Elfquest  Companion   opens  with  some   updates  to  the  game  made
necessary by  issues 19 and 20  of Elfquest in an  errata section. For
example, the  modification  of the rule  about shaping dead  wood made
necessary  by  Redlance's  actions,  and  information  about  the  gas
bombs used by Ol' Maggotty.
    Also,  the  stats  for  17  more characters  from  the  quest  are
included, but  'Rotsap and  splinters in me  hand! No new soul-names!'
The section  on Finding  an Elfname  is useful... my basic rule  is if
you don' t pick  one, One will be given.... "Help  with Elf design" is
interesting,  I nicknamed  it "How  to draw  elves  the Pini  way." It
gives some filling out  for NPC's as well as being  a good  guide-line
for undecided  characters. "Wolf  Ecology" is  a comparative  study of
the wolves on  "The World of Two-moons"  and those of Terrestrial ilk.
I  think this  should be  "must" reading  for players  and Gamemasters
alike   to  help   with   role-playing   and  to   help  dispel   some
misconceptions about  wolves. The  Wolfhaven Holt, a  divergent branch
of wolfriders,  gives some  good  ideas  for Holt  development in your
game.  A pseudo-history  is  included,  and  the  module;  "The  Dying
River" is  meant to be  played by a  branch of Wolfhaven  elves. (This
doesn't  preclude   others,  it's  merely  a  suggestion.)  The Second
Module, "Fire Flight" is for several Plains elves. "The Sea  Elves" is
a complete culture supplement for Elfquest based  on the  concept that
some High ones fled  from the humans only to run  into the ocean. They
colonized  several islands  with the  help of  dolphin like  creatures
known  as  wave-dancers.  The supplement is  divided into  sections on
history,  the  islands  and  the creatures who  inhabit them.  We  are
given  five new  powers  and  three  excellent  modules.  "Stormcoming
Hunt"  is  a  race  against  time   and   tide,  "Littlesmoke  Island"
provides  a  backdrop  for   exploration  of  heretofore  undiscovered
islands,  and  "Assault of  Smalltower  Island"  presents a  different
view of  elves, in  the role of pirates! I'll not say a lot more about
the modules so as  not  to spoil the surprises,  except that they look
real nice  and that there's  more to  them than their names imply. The
Elfquest Companion  I and The  Sea Elves are available  from Chaosium,
INC. Box 6302-eqc, Albany CA 94706-0302 for about $6.00.

          Launching a National University Gaming Organization
    My  name  is Mike  Barbre  and  I am  the  Vice  President of  the
University  Gamers Unlimited  at  the University  of  Missouri in  St.
Louis. I am sending  you all this note in the hope  that you will feel
as  I do.  It is  time  to begin  a national  organization for  gaming
among  the universities  of the  world. This  can help  each of  us in
many ways. I will list some of the benefits below;

       A list of people who share your gaming interests.

       When   budgeting    time   arrives  at   the   universities,
       belonging to a national organization is a big plus.

       I will  work to get each  member a standing discount  at the
       various companies who make our favorite games.

       (idea) a newsletter put out annually.

       (idea) a  newsletter of the highest  quality containing just
       advertising from our favorite companies (I like looking at ads)

       and anything else we can think of.

    Ok,  your saying  what will  it  cost? Answer:  nothing more  than
your groups address.  If I get enough  of a response I will  make up a
form letter  along with a  signup sheet to  be copied and  provided to
each member  of your  groups. Each  member (hope)  would fill  out and
return  the signup  sheet. By  doing  so I  will  add the  names to  a
universal gaming database.  Using the miracle of SAS I  will then make
a 'phone  book' and  send it  to everyone. Generally  this would  be a
forum  of gamers,  with  the  benefits of  a  university.  If you  are
interested at all  please send me a note, and  if possible provide the
address  (on campus)  of your  favorite gaming  organization. I  thank
you for your time and hope to hear from you soon.
