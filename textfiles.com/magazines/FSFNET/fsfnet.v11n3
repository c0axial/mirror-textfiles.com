    Well, we all knew it was coming, and here it is: the last issue of
FSFnet. But  before I get  sentimental, I  do want to  remind everyone
that John White will begin putting out the new Dargon Project magazine
real soon. I  know that he already has some  submissions, and everyone
who is currently subscribed to FSFnet will automatically be subscribed
to the new magazine. I hope that everyone offers John the same support
I've received in putting out FSFnet.  I promise that I won't say "this
is not an  ending, but a beginning", because it  is really neither. It
is a continuation, and hopefully a change for the better.
    And since  there is no  further mundane business, the  reminder of
this  editorial will  be the  business  of ending  the magazine.  I've
included in  this issue a history  of FSFnet, which (at  least in *my*
mind) doesn't qualify  as 'a work of fantasy', but  I felt there might
be  some  interest  in  it   (and  there  were  no  other  submissions
forthcoming). Still, I  think it fitting that this  issue contains the
first true  co-written Dargon work, and  I must say that  I've enjoyed
working with Wendy on it. I hope you enjoy it.
    And now  for the  thank-yous. After four  years of  publication, I
really cannot thank  everyone involved enough for  everything that has
been done to  keep FSFnet afloat. However, rather than  fill an entire
issue with my personal thanks, I  will keep this brief, but heartfelt.
Firstly, of course, I must  thank you, the readership, because without
your interest and support we would never have gotten off the ground in
the first place. As I wrote  at the conclusion of the initial 'issue':

   This is your fanzine, more than it is mine. It is up to you to keep
   it going.  I have merely brought you together. Now it is your turn.

    Well, with a direct readership of  nearly 700, I'd say you've kept
it going. Special thanks and kudos  go to everyone who has contributed
to  the magazine,  whether their  contribution was  a story  or merely
letting other  people know about  FSFnet. Similarly, all  those people
who have set up local  distribution points or cross-posted FSFnet also
deserve recognition. Thanks to Chris  Condon for keeping FSFnet in his
BITLIST and NetMonth magazines, and to  Rich Zellich for keeping it in
the internet LIST-OF-LISTS.  Also special thanks to  Chuq von Rospach,
who  has handled  all the  internet distribution  of FSFnet  since the
WISCVM gateway  was shut down.  But of all  the people with  whom I've
come in  contact in  my capacity  as editor,  two people  deserve very
special recognition, not only by myself, but by everyone.
    Firstly,  Joseph   Curwen.  Curwen  is  a   very  intelligent  and
resourceful friend who  was one voice among the handful  of people who
were in on  FSFnet from the start. Although his  submissions to FSFnet
have been infrequent, they have been  among the best works we've seen,
and he has been a steady companion to me over the years. He was a very
important element of  the Dargon Project, and continues to  be a close
personal friend to myself and the authors who valued his skill. Curwen
graduated from  the University of  Missouri at Columbia  recently, and
plans to find employment as a teacher. I have no doubt whatsoever that
he will  also be able  to call writing one  of his professions  in the
future. FSFnet owes a great deal to this budding author.
    And, secondly, John  White. John learned of FSFnet  and joined the
Dargon Project in the summer of  1986 and very quickly began producing
huge quantities  of stories which  helped see FSFnet through  times of
want and  times of plenty.  John's interrelated stories formed  a huge
work which culminated  in issue 10-2 this past spring.  But beyond his
writing, John has also taken a  leadership role in the Dargon Project,
and  is now  undertaking even  more  responsability. With  the end  of
FSFnet, John  has become the manager  of the Dargon Project,  and also
the editor of its magazine, which you will see shortly. This is a very
serious duty, and John is both capable and willing to execute it. Like
Curwen,  John  has  been  indispensable to  FSFnet,  and  he  deserves
particular thanks and support as he gets the new zine off the ground.
    With  that, my  business has  concluded. I  must say  that I  have
enjoyed putting out  FSFnet greatly, and I hope that  you have enjoyed
it, as  well. It's been an  interesting road we've shared,  and it has
been a  pleasure meeting you  all, and working  with you. So  until we
meet again, fare thee well, and blessed be.
                    -'Orny' Liscomb  <CSDAVE@MAINE>

                           History of FSFnet
    The  University  of  Maine  has  historically  had  an  atmosphere
conducive to  student computing.  MAINE was among  the first  sites to
connect  to  BITNET  (this  in  1982),  and  many  students  began  to
immediately  make  use of  the  new  facilities BITNET  provided.  The
network was  very different  then than  it is now.  There were  only a
handful of sites, all located on the east coast of the US. Most of the
people  who   knew  how  to   use  were  computer   science  students,
programmers, and  operators. These  people were innovators,  and their
attempts  to  improve  BITNET  services produced  such  facilities  as
conference machines,  RELAY, CSNEWS, and LISTSERV,  which were unknown
until fairly recently.
    As early as 1982, several  individuals within the handful of MAINE
network  users began  to print  electronic magazines  to unite  BITNET
users who had  common interests. For example, Andy  Robinson began the
Vm-Com computing  newsletter, which eventually blossomed  into what is
currently one of the most widely used service machines on the network,
CSNEWS@MAINE.  In 1984,  two humor  magazines were  being produced  at
MAINE:  Barry Gates'  "Gliding  Byte" and  Ric Messier's  "Environment
Account".  Also, later  would  come Brent  Britton's "Nutworks"  humor
magazine and Michael Murphy's "Network  Audio-Bits". While there is no
obvious rasoning  as to why  all these magazines developed  at UMaine,
this environment was responsible for the germination of FSFnet.
    In  December of  1984, with  several of  these magazines  based at
MAINE thriving and enjoying a healthy popularity, I began to entertain
thoughts of  beginning my  own science  fiction and  fantasy magazine.
Through my own  use of BITNET I  knew that there was a  huge number of
fans on  the network,  and I  felt that a  magazine along  these lines
would not  only be very  popular, but would  also help get  these fans
together, because at that time there were no facilities on the network
for meeting  people with similar  interests. With these  ideas kicking
around my  head, I bounced them  off a couple friends  (both local and
network), who gave me ample encouragement, and  I was on my way. I had
had some  experience in editing a  fanzine previously, when I  put out
the New  England Tolkien Society's  'Mazar Balinu', a  yearly magazine
containing  Tolkien-related  fiction,  art,  and poetry.  I  had  been
involved with  Tolkien and fantasy  fandom for several years,  and had
been writing  articles and fantasy stories  for some time, as  well. I
wanted the  new magazine to be  like 'Mazar Balinu', in  that it would
concentrate  not  on  news  and  reviews  (the  usual  fare  for  most
'fanzines'), but on  printing amateur fiction. The  support of budding
authors  (myself included,  of course)  has always  been a  particular
interest of  mine, and I felt  that a fiction-based magazine  would be
more  interesting to  read and  would  enjoy more  popularity than  if
FSFnet followed the formula for a 'traditional' fanzine.
    Just  after Christmas  (1984)  I sent  out  a preliminary  mailing
(volume 0,  number 0) to  an initial  distribution of 100  users whose
interests  (as  listed  in  the newly-begun  BITNAUTS  LIST)  included
science fiction- or fantasy-related topics. The intent of this mailing
was to  make the  public aware  of FSFnet's  existence and  to solicit
submissions. Response was generally  favorable, and FSFNET VOL01N1 was
sent out in  January of 1985 with several articles  I had received, as
well  as a  very attractive  new  logo designed  by a  friend in  West
Virginia. This  issue contained  a little  of everything,  including a
book review, a  movie review, a science fiction story,  and a featured
author column. After  the first issue was sent out,  users who had not
responded  to the  initial mailing  or  who were  not interested  were
removed from the distribution list. The mailing list hovered around 70
for the  first few  months of  the magazine's  existence, which  was a
healthy start. I  had decided to print volumes in  trimesters, so each
year would  contain a  Spring volume,  a Summer  volume, and  a Winter
volume, to  parallel the school year.  By the end of  the first volume
(Spring 1985) which contained eight issues, I had written a program to
automate  the  sending  of  issues  from  my  account  (at  that  time
NMCS025@MAINE) in three  different file formats, so  as to accommodate
all readers.  Several network servers  had also agreed to  post issues
for public  access. The content  of the  first volume was  varied, and
included the beginnings of a science fiction series called "the Narret
Chronicles", a  two part story  by Michael Murphy called  "the Dream",
and a special  issue dedicated to H.P. Lovecraft. FSFnet  had met with
initial success, and we were off and running.
    The second volume  (Summer 1985), however, saw  a dramatic change.
In contrast  to the  eight-issue first volume,  it contained  only two
issues, and alerted me to  the problem of finding adequate submissions
during the summer,  when many students are on vacation  and not on the
network.   Similarly,  readership   fell   to  an   all-time  low   of
approximately 35 before it started picking  up again in the fall, with
the return  of students to  school. With  a distribution of  less than
fifty  and   serious  difficulty   securing  an  adequate   number  of
submissions,  I  began to  have  serious  doubts about  the  continued
existence of the magazine.
    During  the fall  of  1985 (volume  three),  my original  account,
NMCS025, was renamed to CSDAVE@MAINE due  to my increasing role in the
administration of the CSNEWS server. This account was used to send out
all subsequent issues.  Subscriptions began to edge their  way up, and
by the final  issue of volume three (3-5), membership  was up again to
91 readers. This issue marked the climax of the Narret tales, and also
the  conclusion of  Roman  Olynyk's "Acquisition"  story. However,  in
November of  1985, being concerned with  the future of FSFnet,  I sent
out a mailing to the authors  I knew, introducing the possibility of a
collective writing project based on an  idea similar to that of Robert
Lynn  Asprin's  "Thieves' World"  series.  We  would get  together  to
outline a  basic setting,  and the authors  would introduce  and share
characters  within  that  communal  setting.  The  response  was  very
enthusiastic, and  early on Alan Clegg  set up a discussion  group for
the project on LISTSERV at  NCSUVM. After kicking around several ideas
for the  shared setting, by  the end of  November we had  settled down
with a core group of writers and the basic premise of a medieval duchy
known as Dargon.  Soon the authors began talking  about characters and
plot lines, and I made it known  publicly that issue 4-1 would see the
printing of the first Dargon Project stories. At the conclusion of its
first  year of  publication, FSFnet  had  put out  fifteen issues  and
subscriptions were  once again  steadily increasing, and  though there
were some early problems, with the  beginning of the Dargon Project at
hand, the future was clearly going to be considerably better.
    With the publication of the first Dargon stories, FSFnet underwent
its first large-scale membership expansion.  Between the end of volume
3  and the  printing  of  VOL04N4 (the  last  issue  of volume  four),
membership had risen from approximately 90  to just shy of 150. FSFnet
was now being listed in Chris Condon's new BITLIST magazine of network
services (which  would later  develop into NetMonth  magazine), giving
FSFnet  visibility  on the  network  beyond  word  of mouth.  But  the
importance of  volume four was  in its content. FSFnet's  best writers
were turning out  new, interrelated stories within the  context of the
Duchy of  Dargon, and  the size, distribution,  and quality  of issues
were  increasing rapidly.  The Dargon  Project lent  stability to  the
magazine  and helped  improve its  content and  give it  some identity
beyond that of 'just another fanzine'.
    During the summer of 1986  (volume five), despite the low activity
during the  summer months, three  very good issues were  produced. The
first  issue  was  a  special  wargaming  issue,  and  contained  some
excellent articles  on related subjects.  The second and  third issues
introduced  several new  project  authors, including  John White,  who
would be  a major contributor to  the magazine. VOL05N3 was  a special
double-sized issue (nearly 1200 lines  long), but with the increase in
quality and output generated by the Dargon Project, such lengths would
soon become standard issue size.
    Volume six,  which contained five  issues, saw two  very important
changes within the  distribution of FSFnet. The first  change was that
FSFnet  began  being distributed  to  internet  sites on  ARPAnet  and
Usenet/UUCP, and  was listed in  the "List  of Lists" master  index of
inter-network  digests. The  second change  was that  issues were  now
being distributed via LISTSERV's DISTRIBUTE facility, rather than each
being sent individually directly  from CSDAVE@MAINE. These two changes
vastly increased  FSFnet's potential  audience, and  at the  same time
dramatically reduced its network load,  permitting larger issues to be
sent more  efficiently to more  people. Readership containued  to grow
constantly, passing the 225-reader mark before the end of 1986.
    The spring  of 1987 was  similarly successful. The  seventh volume
contained five  more issues, as  subscriptions increased to  over 350.
The  idea of  hardcopy  subscriptions was  toyed with,  but  due to  a
personal lack of funds for a decent printer, was never implemented.
    The summer of 1987 volume  contained four issues. During this time
I  got   married  and   honeymooned  at   the  Society   for  Creative
Anachronism's  Pennsic  War, in  the  process  meeting several  FSFnet
readers and contributors.  Volumes 7 and 8 both contained  many of the
best stories FSFnet has ever printed,  and at the beginning of autumn,
subscriptions totalled about 410.
    In  the  fall  of  1987,  only three  issues  were  produced,  but
membership  broke the  500  mark. One  interesting  event during  this
period  happened  when I  accidentally  discovered  a separate  FSFnet
mailing list which had been  managed by a server. Unfortunately, since
the server had become defunct, the  nearly 100 people who thought that
they  were  subscribed were  not  receiving  issues  at all!  After  I
corrected  the problem  with the  server and  contacted these  people,
about one third of them signed up for subscriptions.
    The first  issue of  volume 10  represented the  third anniversary
issue of FSFnet, and was the fourtieth issue printed, and featured two
stories by Joseph Curwen, an author who had been with FSFnet since its
beginning.  Although  not  a  frequent  contributor,  his  wisdom  and
influence  has  been a  major  force  in the  magazine's  development.
Unfortunately,  his  graduation  at  this time  severely  limited  his
network access,  and FSFnet lost one  of its best writers.  The second
issue  of volume  10 contained  the culmination  of John  White's epic
Dargon saga,  and there was more  than enough material to  produce six
issues in this  volume. At the end of spring,  readership supassed 630
and continued to rise.
    The summer of 1988 has seen  the final volume of FSFnet. With some
recent  additions to  the staff,  the content  of volume  11 has  been
superb. At this time, FSFnet is sent (directly) to 603 BITNET users at
318 sites, and 82 internet users.  There are 159 foreign readers in 21
countries,  and  444  domestic  readers in  42  states,  exclusive  of
internet readers.  FSFnet has  put out  48 issues  in just  under four
years,  with  166 stories  and  articles  totalling approximately  2.5
million characters of information.

    With the distribution  of this issue, FSFnet  has officially ended
publication. The  Dargon Project will  continue to function  under the
leadership  of John  White (WHITE@DUVM),  and Dargon  stories will  be
printed in  a new magazine  edited by him,  also. All readers  who are
currently  subscribed to  FSFnet will  automatically be  subscribed to
this new magazine, so there will be no loss of continuity. If you have
any questions or needs, please address them to John, as he's in charge
now, and the CSDAVE@MAINE account will  be deleted in the near future.
Again, my thanks  to everyone who has been involved  with FSFnet, from
those who simply read it to  those involved in production and everyone
else. And, of course, I hope  that everyone continues their efforts to
help John make the new magazine even better.

                           A Visit to Connall
    It was hours before dawn when Myrande Shipbrook woke. Quietly, she
slipped from her bed and quickly made  it. She went to the small table
to the left of  her bed, poured the water from  the china pitcher into
the  bowl, washed  her  face  and hands  with  rose-scented soap,  and
finally scrubbed her face and hands dry with the folded towel that had
been resting on the little table.
    She silently slipped out of her  plain nightgown and pulled on her
muslin chemise. Over  this, Myrande put on a plain  white overdress of
muslin, a cool dress, and one easy to clean. She belted the dress with
a  plain leather  belt which  wrapped once  around her  waist, slipped
through a round iron buckle, and  left a long strip of leather hanging
by her  left leg. At  the end of the  dangling strip was  another iron
ring, to which Myrande attached a heavy ring of keys.
    She slipped into her shoes and left her room.
    Myrande was, by  nature, an early riser, but not  even she enjoyed
leaving her  bed this early. Still,  there was much to  be done today;
the Baron  of Coranabo,  his Baroness, and  their daughter  Danza were
coming tonight to  visit the Baron of Connall. She  was the Seneschale
for the Baron of  Connall, and it was her duty to  see that all things
in his household went smoothly.
    First things first. Breakfast. Clutching  the keys in her hands so
that they would not wake the household, Myrande went from  her room in
the family wing of the keep  toward the kitchen. Suddenly she stopped,
surprised by lamplight spilling from the Baron's study.
    She knocked on  the open door and entered. "My  lord, when are you
going to bed?" she asked as she crossed the room.
    Baron Luthias Connall sat behind a desk with an open book in front
of him. "In  a little while, Sable,  I promise. I just  want to finish
this chapter."
    Myrande  slipped  behind  the  Baron,  placed  her  hands  on  his
shoulders and began kneading them gently. Luthias groaned as she began
loosening the  tense muscles,  and his  head dropped  back to  rest on
Myrande's chest. She  brushed her hand over his eyes  so that he would
close them. "Relax, my lord," she invited. "What are you reading?"
    "'History of the Beinison  Emperors,'" Luthias told  her. "I am
reading it to clear my head. I  was reading Fernusius Cai all night. I
needed a  break from laws."  He opened his  eyes, looked at  her. "And
don't 'my lord' me, Sable. I do not want to hear it from you. You have
known me all my life, and it's no time to start 'my lord'ing me now."
    Myrande smiled.  "All right, Luthias." She  continued her massage,
as Luthias closed his eyes.  "When were you planning to retire?"
    "Midnight. That  way, I figured I  could get up at  dawn and still
have  several hours of sleep  and be  reasonably awake  for Coranabo's
visit. And  you," he  continued, his tone  playful, his  lips smiling,
"you, Mistress Mother, when are you going to sleep?"
    "I just got up."
    The young Baron's eyes snapped open. "You're joking."
    Myrande shook  her head. "No. This is the third time you have done
such this week, Luthias. You have got to stop this."
    "There's just so  much I don't know," Luthias  sighed, closing his
eyes  again and  relaxing a  little beneath  Myrande's touch.  "I wish
Roisart were  here to help me. I have been Baron a month, and  I still
feel so inadequate."
    "You're doing  well," Myrande  reassured him. "The  people respect
you, and your  cousin, the Duke, asks your advice,  and your lands are
run smoothly."
    "That's your  doing, Lady Seneschale," Luthias  growled. "You take
care of this  castle, you administer the castle lands,  and that alone
is the work of  two people. Then, on top of that, you  help me run the
barony, you  act as  my hostess, and  help me take  care of  my social
responsibilities. Besides, you do a job you shouldn't have to."
    "What one is that?"
    "Take care  of the Baron."  Luthias took  a deep breath.  "Maybe I
should marry  and let some  woman be my  Baroness, and she  could take
some of the work from you--help me with the barony--"
    "And take care of the Baron?" Myrande suggested playfully.
    Luthias began  to smile, but  then groaned  as Myrande hit  a sore
knot in his  muscles. He opened his eyes, looked  Myrande in the face,
and smiled.  "No one could  do that as well  as you. Perhaps  I should
just marry you, Sable, and find myself another seneschal. You'd make a
superb Baroness,  and not  only are  you the  most beautiful  woman in
Dargon, you give the best massages in the kingdom."
    Myrande smiled and continued rubbing Luthias' tired flesh. Looking
down into his open eyes, she said, "You never found me so before."
    Luthias gazed  up at  his seneschale.  She possessed  long, thick,
raven hair  wound into a single  braid behind her head.  Her eyes were
almost as dark as her hair, eyes near the color of polished ebony. The
simple white  dress flattered her slim  figure and made her  dark skin
seem duskier. Luthias took her  hand--a small, strong hand--pressed to
his cheek in the courtly manner.  "You've always been beautiful to me,
Sable,  ever since  we were  children." He  kissed her  callused palm.
"You're working too hard."
    "So are you, Luthias," Myrande reminded him, touching his cheek.
    Gently, Luthias reached up, brushed  her chin with his fingertips.
"You  look  exhausted.  You're  doing too  much.  You  should  appoint
yourself  an  assistant." Then  Luthias  smiled  again. "You're  still
beautiful." He stared  at the ceiling. "I always thought  you'd be the
next Baroness, that Roisart would marry you."
    "He did ask me, not long ago," Myrande revealed.
    "I know," Luthias said, smiling wryly.  "He told me about it. I've
never seen a man so happy to be refused. He said you were in love with
someone else.  He must have been  very impressed with him--he  said he
couldn't have chosen  a better man." He sighed, closed  his eyes. "But
he would never tell me who it was--he said it was in confidence."
    "It was. I swore him to secrecy."
    "I was hurt that you didn't trust me, too, Sable."
    At  this very  candid revelation,  still laced  with bitter  pain,
Myrande's hands  froze. "I  didn't think  you cared  much for  love or
lovers, Luthias."
    "I don't, but I care about you."
    Myrande slowly started  to massage again. "I was  afraid you would
laugh at me."
    "You had no  trouble telling Roisart," Luthias  accused, and there
was an edge of anger in his voice.
    For a moment, Myrande, too, was  angry, but she forced calmness on
herself. Thinking of that moment, when Roisart had asked her to be his
wife  and she'd  had  to wound  him,  brought tears  to  her eyes.  "I
would not have told him, but I wanted him to understand why I couldn't
marry him."  For a  moment, she  fell silent. "I  was afraid  that you
would laugh at me. Or that he would be scared away."
    Quickly, Luthias  rose and faced her.  He took her small  hands in
his. "I would  never, never laugh at that, Sable.  Have I ever laughed
at  that  sort  of  thing?  Gods know  that  Roisart  provided  enough
opportunity for me to laugh at love,  but I never did." He stopped and
dropped her hands.  "And I would never laugh at  you, Sable." Then, he
looked confused. "What do you mean, scared away?"
    "You and Roisart were very protective of me."
    "True enough," Luthias  admitted. A thought flashed  in his brain,
and he smiled. "You weren't afraid I'd be jealous, were you, Sable?"
    "Not once."
    "He better  treat you  well, or  I'll bash  his head  in."
    "That would  be interesting,"  Myrande said,  a grin  lighting her
eyes. "I  told you  that you  were very  protective of  me..." Myrande
gazed at the young Baron, whom she thought handsome, but she could see
the strain  in his  face and  the fatigue in  the circles  beneath his
eyes. "Looks like you are ready to bash your own against a wall."
    "There's so much to do," Luthias  told her. "There's a near panic,
what with all these rumors about a Bichanese attack--"
    "I've heard them," Myrande commented. "I've been watching food and
getting ready  to store and  preserve the  harvest, just in  case. But
would Bichu really attack us?"
    "Of  course not,"  Luthias  said  confidently. "Considering  their
distance  from us,  it would  be  idiotic. According  to Michiya,  the
Bichanese already have posts on another continent, one closer to their
own nation,  and it would be  simpler and more profitable  for them to
wage war there."
    "Still, as you said, there's a panic."
    "Yes, and  it bothers  me." Luthias was  grim. "People  so frantic
become  paranoid. Mob  paranoia,  Sable, has  to be  one  of the  most
dangerous and  destructive forces. Its  victims are more likely  to be
innocent  than guilty.  It is the panic, more  than the  rumors, which
truly worries me."
    "Well, get some  sleep," Myrande advised, brushing  some hair from
his eyes. "I'll wake you mid-morning,  and then you'll have some sleep
and most of the day to do some work."
    "I'm not that tired, Sable," Luthias asserted.
    "Don't lie  to me," Myrande cut  him off with a  smile. "You can't
lie to me, Luthias; I know you  too well. Go to bed.  There is no work
that cannot wait a few hours, and you look like you're about to drop."
    "The words were  becoming a little fuzzy,"  Luthias admitted. "But
after I eat breakfast and drink some tea--"
    "Go to bed, or I'll wake the men-at-arms and have them carry you,"
Myrande threatened.
    Luthias chuckled.  "By God, Myrande,  you would make  an excellent
Baroness."  Suddenly,   he  sobered.  "Sable--Myrande.  The   man  you
love...it  isn't Clifton,  is it?"  He  paused a  moment then  rushed,
"Because he...I never  thought he was particularly  interested in you.
They say  he's making eyes  at some girl  from Magnus. Sable,  I don't
want you to be hurt, and Clifton--"
    "It isn't  Clifton," Myrande  assured him, putting  a hand  on the
Baron's arm. "Get some sleep, and sweet dreams, Luthias."
    Luthias covered  her hand with  his own and squeezed  her fingers.
"Thanks, Sable. Good night."
    "Good night."  With a sigh,  the young  Baron of Connall  left the
room. Myrande turned out the lamp, and closed the door on her way out.
    She watched him  trek slowly down the hall. Myrande  knew how hard
being a  Baron was for  Luthias. He, by nature,  was a warrior,  not a
governor, but  he was smart and  was learning rapidly. It  was a heavy
burden to be borne, especially by a young man who had just lost, not a
month before, his beloved father and twin brother, Roisart.
    She sighed, understanding what it was to take on responsibility so
soon after--  why, she herself  had become the seneschale  to Luthias'
father soon after her mother, who  had been seneschale before her, and
father, who had been castellan, died of the Red Plague. Fionn Connall,
the late  Baron, had  been father to  her, and she  had lost  him; and
although Roisart  had not been twin  to her, he had  been her brother,
and she missed him sorely.
    Alone, she walked to the kitchen and began to pull supplies out of
the pantries. In an hour, the  servants would be coming to prepare the
breakfast, but she had to prepare the preparations, it seemed.
    Myrande ate  some bread and  cheese, drank some tea,  which warmed
her, and wished she could go back to bed.
    After checking  supplies, she  started a  quick inspection  of the
kitchen. She sat for another moment,  reviewing what needed to be done
for the  day. After making  a list of  work, she inspected  the castle
(clutching her  keys to keep  her presence silent), and  checked which
rooms  needed to  be cleaned  and  aired, seeing  what little  repairs
needed to be  done. The grounds, gardens, and stables  she would check
after dawn. Then she silently returned to the kitchen.
    Myrande greeted the servants, who  entered the kitchen in pairs or
small  groups. As  they ate,  she gave  her orders  for the  day: this
needed to be repaired, and this needed to be cleaned, and this must be
done for  the visit of  the Baron of Coranabo,  and this must  be done
because the castellan and the inspecting guards were returning today.
    A man-at-arms interrupted them by entering the kitchen. "My lady,"
he called, "the castellan and the inspecting troops have returned."
    "Kindly tell  the castellan  that I  will attend  him later  in my
office," She sent the message formally. The soldier bowed and left.
    After giving a few final orders, Myrande took her keys in hand and
toured  the gardens,  grounds, and  stables.  All was  in good  order,
except a  tree felled by  the particularly horrendous  thunderstorm of
the previous night. Myrande ordered it cleared and cut for firewood.
    When  she returned  to the  keep, it  was nearly  mid-morning. She
retired to her office to work on the household accounts, which must be
presented and explained to the Baron at the end of each month. Myrande
kept her accounts in order, and was only adding this day's purchases.
    There was a  knock on the door. Myrande looked  up and saw Ittosai
Michiya, Castellan of  Connall, in the doorway. She rose  and bowed in
the Bichanese  manner. He returned  the bow  and motioned for  a young
servant behind him to bring in the tea tray.
    "Welcome home, Castellan," Myrande greeted as the servant left.
    Ittosai Michiya  smiled and sat. He  took the teapot in  his hands
and  poured the  aromatic, steaming  liquid into  two small  Bichanese
teacups. "Tea, my lady?"
    Myrande accepted the drink with  a Bichurian bow. "Thank you. And,
Castellan--"
    "Yes, my lady?" asked Michiya, sipping.
    "You don't  need to  address me  so formally. We  are of  the same
rank--persons of noble blood, in high service to the Baron. My name is
Myrande, and," she added, in the  tone of a good-spirited  command, "I
intend that you shall use it."
    "As you  like, Myrande." Her  name sounded foreign on  his tongue.
"And I am Michiya." He paused a moment, appeared confused. "But..."
    "What?"
    "If your name is Myrande, why does Luthias-san call you Sable?"
    Myrande grinned,  then laughed. "That's  a long story, and  an old
one." She  sipped her tea, then  continued, "It was a  name the Baron,
his father, and his brother Roisart called me."
    "Why?"
    "It is because of my hair and eyes, I suppose," Myrande explained.
"And because of something that happened when we were little."
    Michiya looked very interested, so  Myrande went on. "When we were
babies just  learning to walk  and run,  Roisart, Luthias, and  I were
playing in the late Baron's study."
    "Late Baron?  As if he were  delayed and you were  still expecting
him,"  commented  Michiya.   He  shook  his  head.   There  were  some
expressions in this confounded language that were plainly idiotic.
    Myrande  laughed. "It  is  a strange  expression." She  continued,
"Apparently, I  was trying to keep  up with the twins,  who were older
and could run, and I could only walk. I fell, but didn't cry. Still, I
must have  looked pretty pathetic.  Roisart saw  I had fallen,  and he
started  bringing  me  every  thing  he could  get  his  little  hands
on--toys, the flowers in a vase, then  the vase, a book his father was
holding, everything.  Luthias, being a  little bit more  forward, just
put his arms around me and kissed me."
    Ittosai Michiya watched the seneschale  intently. She had a happy,
nostalgic look on her face as she pictured the twins. Michiya pictured
her, a tiny child of elfin looks, night-dark hair, and black eyes.
    "Then the twins' father said to  my father, 'Your Myrande is going
to  grow to  be quite  a sable  beauty. See,  she's enchanted  my boys
already.'"  Myrande brought  her  focus  out of  the  past and  looked
Michiya in  the eye. "Ever since,  the Connalls have called  me Sable.
You can call me that too, if you like."
    "Luthias-san's  brother, he  called  you  Sable?" Myrande  nodded.
"Then I may do  so. I thought it was a name only  he had for you." She
shook her head. "It is sad, what happened to Roisart. And Luthias-san,
he needs a brother."
    "Oh, I  think you and  Duke Clifton  are filling that  need rather
nicely," Myrande commented. "He relies on your advice, Michiya, and he
must respect you a great deal to have made you castellan."
    Michiya grinned.  "In Bichu, I am  a second son, and  I would have
been what you call castellan to my  own brother if I had stayed. But I
am here, and will be brother and castellan to Luthias-san instead."
    Myrande asked, "Did you know that  the Baron of Coranabo is coming
to visit the Baron today?"
    Michiya shook  his head. "Why  visit? Will he  not see him  in the
city in a week's time, when the Duke holds his ball again?"
    Myrande considered this. "I'm not sure why he's coming. He said in
his letter that he had a private matter to discuss with the Baron. But
he's bringing  his wife  and his  elder daughter..."  Myrande shrugged
casually.  "Well,  Coranabo  is  an  odd  man,  Michiya.  Anything  is
possible." She took a sip of her tea. "In any case, Baron Coranabo may
bring some soldiers with him. Have you room for them in the barracks?"
    "Yes, plenty."
    She nodded, satisfied. "I trust you can take care of them then?"
    Michiya nodded. "Of  course." He paused. "I must make  a report to
you about the  inspection. Do you wish the report  now, Myrande, or do
you wish me to wait until Luthias-san awakes?"
    Myrande considered. "Best  wait until he's up; you'd  only have to
give it  twice otherwise. Besides,  Michiya, he should be  up shortly.
I'll have  him join us after  his breakfast. In the  meantime, you can
tell me what supplies you need for the soldiers and the barracks."
    Ittosai dutifully began naming his needs. Myrande jotted them down
on  a scrap  of parchment.  "These shouldn't  be a  problem. Is  there
anything you need personally, Michiya?"
    Ittosai screwed  up his visage  in thought. "Yes, Myrande.  I need
clothes for attending formalities, such as the Duke's ball next week."
    Myrande  wrote this.  "That  reminds  me, I  need  new gowns,  and
several nice  chemises. I  only have  one gown,  and since  Luthias is
doing so  much entertaining  now and  I'm acting  as his  hostess, I'm
going to  need to  dress up more  often. I'll order  your suit  and my
gowns tomorrow,  Ittosai. Would  you like it  in the  Bichanese style?
What colors?"
    "Yes, I like most the style of  my home. For colors, I prefer blue
and white."
    Myrande noted this  on her paper. Just then, there  was a knock on
the office doorframe. "Come," Myrande answered.
    Jahn, Luthias' manservant,  entered the room. "My lady,  I hate to
trouble you,  but I..." The servant  looked abashed. "I can't  seem to
wake the Baron."
    "It's going  to be one of  those days," Myrande sighed.  She rose.
"Lord Michiya,  I'll be back  as soon  as I can,  but this may  take a
little while."  She clutched her  keys, and  followed Jahn out.
    As they approached the Baron's  chambers, Myrande asked, "What did
he do when you woke him, Jahn?"
    "He just said something and turned over." He remember late to add,
"My lady. I tried again, but he will not budge."
    "All right," Myrande acknowledged. "You can go about whatever else
you had to do. I will see to the Baron."
    Jahn's face lit with a knowing look. "As you wish, lady."
    He left her,  and Myrande didn't give him a  second glance. Still,
the look on the manservant's face stayed with her.
    Yes, now it'll be all over the castle that Luthias and I...Myrande
smiled and shrugged. Oh, well. There were many worse things.
    Still  clutching her  keys, she  opened  the door  to the  Baron's
bedroom and walked in. Silently, she  shut the door behind her. In the
darkened room,  Luthias still lay, barely  clad, on his bed,  with the
covers doing everything but the function for which they were intended.
    She crept over to the bed and sat on the edge. Gently, she touched
his forehead. He didn't move. Myrande  put her hand on Luthias' strong
shoulder  and gently  shook  it.  No response.  Again,  she shook  his
shoulder, but harder this time.  No response. Myrande shook him again,
called him: "Luthias."
    "A few  more moments," muttered  the Baron, turning away from her.
    Myrande  smiled.  Some  things  never changed.  Both  Luthias  and
Roisart  had been  like  this  since the  gods  knew  when. "Come  on,
Luthias. No more time. You've got to get up."
    "A few more moments, Sable," mumbled  the Lord of Connall. "Just a
few more moments. And then I'll get up. I promise."
    "Knowing  you, you said that to Jahn  five minutes  ago,"  Myrande
returned. "It's past half-noon. Get up."
    Luthias' eyes opened.  "Past half-noon? Sable, why  didn't you get
me up sooner? You know that I want to be up by--"
    "I don't doubt that Jahn tried," Myrande rued.
    "Damn it, Sable," Luthias swore, sitting up. "Here you are, taking
care of  the Baron again."  He was grim. "I  wanted to be  up earlier.
Everything's going to be late now."
    "Don't worry. Everything's under control," Myrande assured him.
    Luthias, half-growling, left his bed  and went past his seneschale
to his wardrobe. He flung it open.  "If it is, it's your doing, Sable.
You're doing the work of eight people."
    "Nonsense," said Myrande, smiling.
    Luthias removed  a light-colored  tunic and some  darker breeches,
which he  proceeded to pull  on in front  of his seneschale.  "When is
Coranabo coming?"
    "This afternoon." She went to  the wardrobe and leaned against it.
Luthias struggled into his lighter tunic and belted it. "Do me a favor
and meet me and Lord Ittosai in my office."
    "Why don't I just eat breakfast with you?" Myrande just nodded and
she left the room.

    Now that it was nearly over, Myrande knew that she had been right:
it was one of those days.
    The Coranabos had  come two hours earlier than  Myrande or Luthias
had expected.  Luthias looked fine,  if informal, but  Myrande's white
cotton overdress was  stained and streaked with sweat.  She had hardly
looked  the  hostess,  but  Luthias  told her  she  looked  fine,  and
together, they had greeted their visitors.
    There was a fire in the kitchen, right after that, and Myrande had
her hands full keeping the servants  calm and the fire small. With the
help of  a few courageous  grooms, the  small grease fire  was quickly
extinguished, and the visitors and Luthias never knew it happened.
    Myrande had  hardly time  enough to  take a  quick bath  and dress
herself  in her  only nice  gown before  dinner, which,  luckily, went
well. The meat  was juicy and tender, and the  greens fresh and tasty,
the bread newly baked.
    The  talk  was pleasant,  general.  As  they all  talked,  Myrande
watched the visitors,  but inconspicuously. She was  trying to discern
why Coranabo  had come. It was  hard to figure out  anything about the
Baron of Coranabo. Coranabo was a  tall, hard- eyed man, his gray hair
balding, his age, perhaps five and fifty. He smiled, but the smile was
superficial. Myrande wondered if something were wrong in Dargon and he
was just waiting to discuss after the meal.
    His wife was  pleasant: a petite lady with graying  hair who spoke
gaily of society. The daughter, though,  was enigmatic and why she had
come, Myrande  could not guess. Danza,  the girl--for so she  was; she
could  not  be  older  than  fifteen,  Myrande  guessed-  -was  silent
throughout  the dinner,  and did  not lift  her eyes  from her  plate.
Myrande  couldn't  attribute  the  silence   or  shyness  to  lack  of
confidence; pretty,  petite, golden-haired Danza held  herself proudly
and confidently. It made no sense that a gorgeous girl of marriageable
age would  stare at her  plate instead of  flirting with the  Baron of
Connall, the second most eligible man in the duchy.
    After dinner, Luthias  led his guests into the study  for an after
dinner drink. "Brandy, Baron?" Luthias asked politely.
    "Yes, thank you, Luthias," Coranabo answered congenially.
    "My  lady?" Luthias  asked the  Baroness  as Myrande  went to  the
spirits cabinet.
    "Some wine would be fine, thank you, Luthias." The Baroness smiled
at the younger Baron  as she would have smiled on her  own son, if she
had one. "Lady Myrande, would there be some of that famous golden wine
of Magnus in the cupboard?"
    "I believe so, Baroness," Myrande replied cheerfully, moving a few
bottles around.
    "Would you  care for some  sherry, Lady Danza?" Luthias  asked his
youngest guest  gently. Myrande had  noted the gentle manner  in which
Luthias had treated Danza during dinner, and she didn't like it. Angry
at  herself, Myrande  shook it  off. It  was just  like Luthias  to be
protective toward  slight, delicate  girls. He was  the same  way with
Pecora. That never bothered her. There was no need that this should.
    Danza shook her head and  mumbled something. "Some sherry for lady
Danza, Myrande."
    "Yes, my  lord," she  replied docilely enough.  She smiled  at the
Baron, who smiled back: the casual intimate grin of long-time friends.
Myrande wrenched her eyes away from Luthias', took out the brandy, the
gold wine, the sherry, and five glasses from the cupboard. "What would
you like, my lord?"
    "Brandy, thank you, Sable," Luthias replied, losing his formality,
slipping into the normal affection he showed towards her. He still was
aware of  his obligations of  host, however,  and he motioned  for his
guests to sit. Coranabo  and his wife took a seat  near the west wall,
directly in front of the small  table where Myrande was pouring. Danza
took a  seat opposite her, and  Luthias moved to stand  behind her, so
that he might face his guests.
    Myrande passed Coranabo and his  wife his drink. The Baron thanked
her, then said, "Luthias,  my boy, it's time that I  got to the reason
for this visit."
    "I wish you would," Luthias said congenially. "I've been wondering
about it."
    "I wished to surprise you," Coranabo  said with a smile. "Not that
I thought you'd suspect, but--"
    "Why don't you tell us what  it is, Baron?" Myrande suggested with
the lilt  of laughter in  her voice. Just  like Coranabo to  keep them
guessing. She  could remember her  father and Luthias'  laughing about
the shrewdness of Baron Coranabo, how  he used ploys to feed his flair
for the dramatic. She unstopped the sherry bottle.
    Now, Coranabo laughed. "I never knew  a Shipbrook to be so direct,
Lady Myrande."
    "You forget, Baron,"  Luthias defended her lightly  and teased her
simultaneously, "she grew up here in Connall."
    "And you were always a blunt lot," the Baroness chuckled.
    "True enough,"  Luthias admitted  politely. "Now, tell  me, Baron,
why have you come here?"
    "Your brother  Roisart would  have figured  it out,  but he  was a
romantic, as I recall," Coranabo laughed, still evasive, still working
to a climax. "I have come to  offer you, Baron Connall, the hand of my
daughter, Danza."
    Without warning, Myrande's face went  white and she nearly dropped
the sherry bottle. Her legs went  weak, and she stumbled, grabbing the
corner of the table to steady herself.
    Immediately, Luthias noticed a problem. "My God, Sable!" he cried,
crossing the  room to her. He  put one hand  on her arm, and  with the
other, he took the sherry from her clenched hand.
    "I'm all right," she whispered, but Luthias scowled at the lie.
    "Better sit  her down,  Luthias," the concerned  Baroness advised.
"She looks like she's about to faint."
    "Yes, come here,"  Luthias ordered, guiding her to a  seat next to
Danza. Myrande  collapsed into  the seat. Luthias  went to  the table,
poured some  brandy into a  glass, and  brought it to  his seneschale.
"Drink this. Damn it, Sable, I've told you you're working to hard."
    Myrande dumbly held the brandy  in her hands. "Here, drink," Danza
encouraged.  Myrande looked  at her,  saw Danza's  eyes for  the first
time. They were--very,  very slightly--rimmed with red,  but they were
kind. Myrande swallowed the lump in her throat.
    "Come  on,  Sable," Luthias  encouraged,  placing  a hand  on  her
shoulder. "Drink."
    Myrande lifted  the glass and  gulped the brandy. After  a moment,
she coughed and said, "Forgive me. I didn't mean to interrupt."
    "Think nothing  of it, Lady  Myrande," Coranabo reassured  her. He
looked at her with hard, glittering eyes, but he seemed kind. "No harm
done. I hope you're all  right." Myrande nodded. Then Coranabo shifted
his attention to the Baron behind her.  "Do you need me to repeat what
I said, Luthias?"
    Luthias crossed  in front of Myrande  and went back to  the table,
where he poured Danza's  drink and his own. "No, Baron,  I heard it. I
admit," Luthias  continued with  a hard  smile wreathed  in confusion,
"that I'm  stunned." Luthias looked  at Danza.  "Lady Danza, I  had no
idea that you favored me."
    "Oh, she  does," Coranabo  quickly answered  for his  daughter. He
leaned  back in  his chair,  smiling with  satisfaction. "And  I admit
there's no man in Dargon whom I'd rather have for a son-in-law."
    Luthias seemed slightly  confused, and his face  told Myrande that
something didn't seem right to the young Baron. Myrande couldn't blame
him. Loud alarms were ringing in her mind, too. But Luthias only said,
"Thank you, Baron. But I don't know what to say."
    "Well, think about  it, Luthias," Coranabo offered.  "Sleep on it.
Let me know."
    "I  will," Luthias  promised. He  went back  to the  table, poured
Danza's sherry  and his own  brandy. He and Coranabo  began discussing
the rumors of Bichanese attack, but Myrande didn't hear a word.

    Myrande remained  up and about  long after the Baron  of Coranabo,
his wife, and his daughter went  to bed. There were preparations to be
made for tomorrow, and it was her job to see to them.
    Around midnight, a courier arrived at  the keep with a message for
Baron Luthias Connall.  Myrande took the message and  ordered food and
bed  for the  tired  man. She  then  went to  the  study--if she  knew
Luthias, he was still awake and reading--to give him the message.
    She  was right;  the light  still burned.  Myrande knocked  on the
doorframe. "Luthias," she called softly.
    "Come in,  Sable," he invited. She  did. The Baron sat  behind his
desk, very serious. Luthias tiredly smiled. "What is it?"
    Myrande  offered  the  sealed  parchment. "Message  for  you.  The
messenger just arrived."
    Luthias took  the paper, began to  open it. "Have the  man fed and
provided with--"  The young Baron  looked from the paper  to Myrande's
half-smiling face.  "But you've  already taken  care of  that, haven't
you."  Luthias  chuckled softly.  "I'm  sorry,  Sable. I  should  know
better." He looked at the parchment  and read the message once, twice.
"I wonder what this is all about."
    "What is it?"
    "Clifton  wants me  to come  and see  him, as  soon as  possible,"
Luthias told her, showing her the parchment.
    Myrande read it. "I wonder what the Duke wants."
    Luthias shook  his head,  re-read the  message. "No  telling. I'll
have to go to Dargon tomorrow." Luthias  set the paper on his desk. "I
want you  to come with me.  The castle can  survive a few days  on its
own, and if nothing else, I've seen tonight that you need a break." He
took  a deep  breath.  "And  some help.  I've  thought  about it,  and
tomorrow, I'm going to tell Coranabo that I'll marry Danza."
    Myrande hurriedly sat down in the nearest chair. "Why?"
    Luthias  looked her  in the  eye. "This  barony needs  a baroness,
Myrande. You're doing too much, I'm doing to much. We're going to kill
ourselves if we go on like this."
    Yes, that was Luthias, always practical. "Do you think a girl that
young can handle being a baroness?" Myrande asked.
    "Of course. She's been trained  to it since birth," Luthias argued
confidently. "She'll make a good baroness."
    "Are you sure about this, Luthias?" Myrande asked gently.
    "I told you, we need help, Sable."
    "We could hire help, Luthias. Do you actually want to marry her?"
    Luthias leaned back  and appeared to think about it.  "It might as
well  be Danza  as anyone  else," the  Baron sighed  with resignation.
"I'll have to marry sometime, Sable.  There has to be a Baroness, and,
eventually, when Danza is less delicate, I  do want to have a son." He
smiled. "And name him Roisart."
    "Wouldn't you rather marry a woman you loved?"
    Luthias shrugged.  "There have  only been four  people in  my life
that I've ever loved, Sable. My father, my cousin, my brother--"
    "And some lady who jilted you?" Myrande prompted, incredulous.
    Luthias smiled,  reached across the  desk and took her  hand. "No,
Sable, you. You're my best friend, other than Clifton, and always have
been." He  sighed again. "But there  has to be a  baroness eventually,
whether I love  her or not, and  we both need help, Sable,  face it. I
don't want to see you work yourself to death."
    "Luthias," Myrande ordered sternly, "don't do this for me. I don't
want you to marry and be miserable for my sake."
    "Hey," Connall said gently, squeezing  Myrande's hand. "I won't be
miserable, I promise." She bitterly smiled at the vow. "It's just what
I need,  Sable, what  this place  needs." He  peered at  her intently.
"You're not jealous, are you?"
    "Of course not," she said.
    "No,  I forgot,  you're  in love  with  the mysterious  stranger,"
Luthias  recalled, his  tone a  cross between  amusement and  sarcasm.
"Look, Sable,"  he began, serious this  time, "I'll go to  him, try to
arrange the marriage for you--"
    "No--no, Luthias. You'd feel  too awkward--he's--" Myrande paused.
"You're too close, and you wouldn't want to try to convince him--"
    Luthias released her hand. "It is Clifton, then."
    Myrande shook her head. "No, Luthias.  I give you my word, I'm not
in love  with Clifton Dargon." She  leaned her head on  her hand. "Not
even your  father, when  I told  him about this,  wanted to  arrange a
marriage.  He wanted  to  wait until  the  man was  older,  to see  if
something developed..."
    Luthias laughed. "I loved my father dearly, but he was a romantic,
just like Roisart. Very few people love like my father and mother. And
as for me--I'll  never fall in love.  I'm not built for  it, I think."
Myrande smiled. "I'll just marry  Danza and be reasonably content."
    "Do what you think best," Myrande rose. "Good night, Luthias."
    "Going to bed?" he wondered, taking out Fernusius Cai's treatise.
    "Not yet. There's work to be done." Abruptly, she left the room.
    Myrande couldn't believe it. He was  going to marry that child and
make her Baroness of Connall.  Would Danza want him, Myrande wondered,
if  Roisart were  alive and  Baron and  Luthias were  merely Roisart's
castellan or  the Duke's?  Myrande thought not.  In fact,  Myrande had
heard rumors six weeks ago about  Lady Danza and Tylane Shipbrook. And
now that  Luthias was Baron, this  Danza was wiling to  abandon Tylane
like a plague carrier!
    And as  for her  being a 'good'  Baroness--Myrande thought  it was
unlikely and scowled.  Danza was only fifteen, a child!  How would she
handle some  of the crises  around here? She hadn't  handled Roisart's
death  well--Myrande  remembered  her sobbing  hysterically  when  she
arrived in Dargon in the middle of the night--
    And suddenly, Myrande was back in that nightmare night, that night
of horrors, when  soldiers came to Connall keep. We're  here to arrest
Manus  the  Healer,  they  told  Myrande. Why?  Oh,  well,  there's  a
conspiracy against  the Duke and  the Lords  of Connall. There  was an
assassination attempt tonight. No, no, lady, the Duke's fine. The twin
lords? No, lady, sorry, they're dead.
    Luthias dead? Roisart,  his twin, her friend, dead  too? Was there
no  comfort? Pale,  she  rode with  the squadron  to  Dargon keep.  If
nothing else, she  would see that Luthias, and Roisart,  would be well
buried. She  clutched the leather reins  all the way to  the town. The
stars  glittered  coldly,  and  she  wondered  if  Luthias'  soul  and
Roisart's were among them.
    Oh, gods, Luthias  dead, and Roisart dead beside  him! Myrande was
unsure that she could bear it.
    When she arrived at the keep,  she demanded immediately to see the
Duke. She  was ushered to the  blue ballroom on the  ground floor. The
door was opened for her, and she saw Roisart's body laid out in state.
The  Duke was  there, talking  with Lord  Coranabo, she  recalled, and
little lady  Danza, who had hardly  known Roisart at all,  was sobbing
like a  babe on  her father's  arm. Myrande  stood tall  and straight,
though pale, and walked toward the Duke.
    And then Luthias stood up.
    Myrande gasped  his name, ran  to him,  and flung her  arms around
him. Slightly bewildered, but needing comfort, the young Baron put his
arms around her  as well. Myrande felt Luthias'  heart beating against
her shoulder--he  was somewhat taller  than she--and for a  moment, it
didn't matter that Roisart, her best friend, had been foully murdered.
She couldn't  grieve for Roisart  Connall, her brother,  the wonderful
boy who had wanted  to marry her. All she could  do was clutch Luthias
close and thank every god she could name that he still lived.
    "They've told  you then," Luthias  said softly, putting a  hand on
her head and holding her close. "They told you that Roisart is dead."
    For a  moment, Myrande lost  control completely and  sobbed, "They
told me you both were dead!"
    "Sable, my  God, Sable,  Roisart's dead,  and I'm  Baron," Luthias
rasped. Myrande held  him more tightly, knowing that only  with her or
Clifton could Luthias show this  much grief--and fear. "I'm Baron, and
my brother is dead."
    "I'll help you,  Luthias, I swear it," Myrande  had whispered. And
she had  helped him, she stayed  by his side when  Roisart was buried,
and later  when he was invested  as Baron of Connall.  And ever since,
she had been helping  him. Would this baby Danza be  able to help him?
Did she deserve to become a Baroness? Myrande didn't think so.
    She blindly went through the motions of the little work left to be
done, and then,  exhausted, Myrande decided it was  time she collapsed
in bed. As if  in a daze, she wandered back to the  family wing of the
keep,  past  Luthias' study--the  lamp  was  still  on, he  was  still
reading--to her room.
    Luthias was going to marry a baby  he didn't love, a puppy in love
with him. Bitterly,  she laughed softly at herself. As  if she had the
right to condemn Danza for that!
    Suddenly, a blond ghost brushed past her--a blond ghost in a lacy,
silken  nightgown.  Myrande stared.  Danza.  What  was she  doing  up?
Myrande took a step toward her,  but some instinct halted her voice as
Danza stepped into the study.
    Myrande shrugged at the girl's quick departure and dodged into her
room. Suddenly, she found herself  sobbing. Luthias was going to marry
Danza, and then-- Luthias was very  bright, and he would figure it out
eventually. And how she would hate to live with his pity!
    Myrande brushed  her hands  across her  eyes quickly  and severely
silenced her  own sobs. She  would not be  able to live  with Luthias'
pity, she  knew that. And  when Luthias married little  Danza, Myrande
would leave the castle. Perhaps her  uncle, the Baron of Shipbrook, or
Luthias' cousin the Duke would have a position here. Myrande could not
live in  Connall Keep, seeing  the pity  in Luthias' eyes,  seeing the
pride in Danza's.
    She went to her night table, picked up a hairbrush, undid the long
braid that  hung behind her head,  and began to brush  her black hair.
Her hands shook;  the nervous fingers made the brush  a weapon against
her, and she  accidentally struck her own temple.  Myrande dropped the
brush. This was no good. She'd never be able to sleep like this.
    Myrande  rose and  left the  room. A  large goblet  of milk  would
comfort her a little, calm her a little, and allow her to sleep. There
would be much  to do tomorrow before she and  Luthias left for Dargon.
    She went  silently to the kitchen,  downed the milk, and  began to
wander back to her room. She smiled sadly as she passed the study; the
light was still burning. She knocked again. "Luthias?"
    "Sable? Come in. I thought you had gone to bed." Luthias was still
behind the  desk, reading the  words of  Fernusius Cai. He  closed the
book when Myrande entered the room. "Why haven't you gone to bed yet?"
    Myrande shrugged. "What about you, Lord Luthias?"
    Luthias smiled.  "Just reading some. I'll  go to bed when  you do;
how's that?"
    "I was on my way," Myrande confessed.
    Luthias kept grinning. He leaned back  in his chair. "I'm going to
refuse the Baron of Coranabo," he announced casually.
    "Why?" Myrande asked, stunned.
    "Danza came to  me, told me she was in  love with Tylane," Luthias
revealed. "She  marched in here and  said very firmly that  she had no
objections  to me  personally, but  she  couldn't marry  me, that  she
wasn't a virgin, and she did not want to disappoint me."
    "Danza, not a virgin?" Myrande echoed, incredulous.
    Luthias grinned. "That's what she said.  It took me a little while
to get the real reason out of her--that she loved Tylane and wanted to
marry him. And what could I say, Sable? If we married, she'd resent me
all her days and we'd both be miserable. And you'd hurt, Sable, to see
me  hurting."  Luthias leaned  toward  Myrande  again, looked  at  her
lazily. "So, it's off, and I'll marry someone else someday, Sable, but
until then, we will have a lot of work, the two of us."
    "I don't mind,"  Myrande told him. She smiled  and leaned forward.
"I'd rather exhaust  myself than see you  miserable, Luthias." Myrande
shook her head. "She must have  been pretty desperate to tell that she
wasn't a  virgin. Not many girls  her age would admit  that. But would
you refuse a girl on those grounds?"
    Luthias shrugged.  "No. I'm  not a  virgin; why  should she  be? I
actually don't  want to marry  a virgin. I don't  want my bride  to be
terrified on our wedding night."
    Myrande laughed.  "I know it is all  very practical,  Luthias, but
somehow you sound more romantic than Roisart."
    Luthias laughed  too. He rose  and crossed  to her. "We  should be
getting to bed, lady Seneschale. We  have a long journey tomorrow." He
put her hands on her shoulders and began to rub them gently.
    "Mmm,"  said  the  seneschale,  closing  her  eyes  tiredly.  "You
shouldn't do that, Luthias."
    "Why not?  You take care  of me,"  Luthias argued. He  fell silent
then, kept rubbing. Then he asked,  "Sable, don't answer, if you don't
want  to." Myrande  relaxed  beneath  his touch.  "Are  *you* still  a
virgin?"
    Myrande answered, not opening her eyes, "Yes. That surprises you?"
    "Yes," Luthias admitted frankly. "You're almost twenty-one- -"
    "And you and Roisart had a  habit of scaring my suitors away. They
all thought either that  I've been promised to one of  you or that you
were going to destroy them if they touched me."
    Luthias shook his head. "I hope you've been kissed, at least."
    "Yes, I've been  kissed. You and Roisart didn't  start scaring men
away until I was seventeen or so,  and by then I was in love with--and
I don't think you could scare--him--away."
    "Sorry, it  was a  silly question,"  Luthias mused.  "Roisart must
have kissed you when he proposed."
    "Only my cheek."
    "No wonder  he never  got anywhere  with girls!"  Luthias laughed,
squeezed Myrande's shoulders one last time. "Come on, Sable, I'll walk
you to your room. We both could use some sleep."
    Myrande rose, and Luthias turned  down the lamp. Exiting the room,
he put  his arm around  Myrande's shoulders in  a casual way,  and she
leaned on him a little. Silently, they walked down the hall.
    They soon  arrived at her  door, and  Myrande opened it.  She then
turned to her Baron and touched his cheek. "Good night, Luthias."
    "Good night," answered  the young Baron. "And,  Sable?" She looked
up  at him.  Suddenly,  Luthias  leaned forward  and  kissed her  lips
quickly. "That  is from Roisart,  because he was  too stupid to  do it
when he  had the chance."  Luthias kissed  her again, longer  and more
firmly this time. "That is from me. Good night, Sable."
    Myrande smiled at him and said, "Good night."

                           A Bride for Dargon
    The young Lord of Dargon sat unquietly behind his large oaken desk
and stared through  the arms of his family which  adorned the walls of
his receiving room. His forebears had been men of decision and action,
reknowned for timely justice and intelligence, yet Duke Clifton Dargon
had reached  an impasse and  wished that  his ancestors had  left some
indication in their  writings of how his current  predicament could be
resolved. Yet  again, he  stood and  strode to  the tall,  open window
which overlooked the courtyard, the city, and the surrounding fields.
    Though his mind wandered, his eyes  followed a young man in a grey
tunic as he left the market.  The nobleman wondered what business this
man might  have in Dargon,  what concerns he  might have, and  what he
might do if he faced  Clifton's problems and responsibilities. The man
turned off Merchant's  Way and strode unhurriedly through  the part of
town that  contained several of the  inns that catered to  people from
away. As he continued, a woman in  a bright blue shirt and gauzy white
pants came up to him. She fawned on him for several moments before she
turned him back  the way he had  come and disappeared from  sight in a
cross-alley. Clifton smiled secretly and sighed a heavy sigh.
    Clifton was surprised by the clearing  of a throat behind him, and
turned suddenly  to look  angrily at  his cousin,  the young  Baron of
Connall, as he  strode into the office. Realizing that  it was Luthias
and not one of his annoying  advisors, Dargon calmed a little, but his
irritation  remained unquenched  like a  vicious undertow  beneath the
deep brown eyes.
    Luthias, attractive,  strong, and manly for  his twenty-one years,
stood out of respect for his lord, yet his stance emanated the ease of
standing  before a  man loved  and  understood as  well as  respected.
Clifton gazed  upon his  cousin's face,  so similar  to his  own, with
equal respect.  Since the assassinations  of Luthias' father  and twin
brother, Luthias  had grown  considerably. At one  time, the  Baron of
Connall  was   known  for  quick   action  and  thought   which  could
occasionally border on rashness. But  since his brother's death in the
attempt to  save the lives of  Luthias and Dargon, Luthias  had become
more thoughtful, as if the twins' soul, divided at birth, was reunited
at  last   through  death.  Luthias'  ability   for  quick,  practical
decisions, like  his grief for father  and brother, had not  left him;
the quickness and  pragmatism now mingled occasionally  with the grave
caution  of his  brother, just  as the  blue bands  of mourning  still
lingered on the everyday clothing. There were a few days when Clifton,
Lord Dargon, had worried that the  grief and the responsibility of the
barony would  turn the streaks of  auburn in Luthias' brown  hair to a
premature gray, but the young  baron had quickly and manfully accepted
grief and responsibility both. A smile fluttered across Dargon's lips.
Luthias was making his cousin and liege very proud.
    "You wanted to see me, Clifton?" Luthias prompted finally.
    Clifton returned from the quick current of his thoughts and looked
his cousin in the eyes again. There was pain in them still. It must be
difficult, Clifton thought, for him to look at me, or even at himself,
and yet see only his brother. And still I see Roisart in him.
    After a moment, Clifton replied, "Yes, Luthias. Please sit down."
    Perplexed  at the  anger  on the  face of  his  lord and  kinsman,
Luthias  obeyed.  Once seated,  he  wondered  aloud, unafraid  of  the
answer, "Have I done something, Clifton?"
    "No, Luthias, no," Dargon assured him, brushing the idea away with
a flick  of the hand.  "I need  to talk to  you. You and  Roisart were
always good at calming me down."
    "I'm only half as good as we used to be," Luthias quipped, jesting
lightly at his own grief. "But I'll listen. What's wrong?"
    Lord  Clifton Dargon  scowled  with  immeasurable wrath.  "They're
after me again!"
    Luthias  went  white,  missing  the subtle  twinkle  of  irony  in
Clifton's brown eyes. "God, no. Not another plot against us!"
    "What? Oh, no," Clifton told  him quickly. "No, they aren't trying
to murder us." He scowled again. "But that would top my day nicely!"
    "What's wrong, then?"
    "My  counselors," Clifton  explained.  "They are  plaguing me  yet
again... They want me to marry!"
    Luthias almost laughed.  The concept didn't seem  so terrible. "Is
that all?" he asked lightly.
    "Is  that all?"  thundered the  Lord  of Dargon,  rising from  his
chair, then pacing behind the desk. "Is that ALL?"
    "Marriage hardly seems a vile fate, Clifton," Luthias vainly tried
to calm him. "I know many who have survived..."
    "I  don't  see you  running  out  and marrying,"  Dargon  accused,
whirling on his bewildered cousin.
    Luthias' mouth went tight and  his eyes narrowed with seriousness.
"Yesterday the Baron of Coranabo offered his daughter to me, Clifton,"
he snapped. "I  need a baroness, and  I would have married  her if she
wasn't in love with Tylane Shipbrook."
    "Well,  how would  you feel  being pushed  into it?"  the Lord  of
Dargon demanded.
    Luthias stared  at his cousin a  moment. It wasn't like  him to be
this  angry,  he thought  suddenly.  "It  isn't just  your  advisors,"
Luthias concluded aloud. "What is it, Clifton? What's bothering you?"
    Dargon gazed  suddenly at  his cousin, and  just as  suddenly, his
anger defused. He sighed, trying  to calm his confused emotions. "Sit,
Luthias," invited the Lord of Dargon wearily. "I need to talk to you."
    Luthias obeyed slowly, not taking  his eyes off his cousin. "Talk,
then, Clifton. What is it?"
    Again, the Lord of Dargon sighed. He sat silent for a few moments,
then spoke. "I was telling the truth," he ventured, as if he were half
talking to  himself. "It is my  advisors. They want me  to marry. They
want me to have an heir." The lord scowled. "It doesn't befit women to
be treated as mere heir machines, and  I will not marry a woman merely
to provide one."
    "I agree," Luthias replied gravely. "But there's more," he knew.
    Almost sadly,  Dargon nodded.  "I don't want  to get  married," he
told his cousin. "I don't want to marry just anyone. I want to marry a
woman that I could love."
    "Don't you think you will find  a woman to love, Clifton?" Luthias
questioned carefully.
    "That's the  problem, cousin,"  sighed Clifton Dargon.  "I already
have. And I already love her."
    This took Luthias quite by surprise; for a moment he simply stared
uncomprehendingly at  his noble cousin.  In the next  moment, Luthias,
Baron  of Connall,  almost  lost  his temper.  "Problem?  What IS  the
problem? You  have found  her. You  love her.  You're the  Duke around
here, Clifton.  You can marry  anyone you  like. Clifton, there  is no
problem." Another thought slapped Luthias smartly. "Gods, Clifton, you
haven't fallen in love with a married woman, have you?"
    Dargon looked at  his young cousin once again  and laughed softly.
"Married?  No,  she  isn't  married.   Quite  the  contrary.  By  most
standards, she is  what the people would judge an  old maid." His eyes
clouded as he let the memory of her wash over him. "Though she's by no
means old, and the man who would not choose her is blind."
    At this  romantic turn in  his cousin's nature (which  Luthias had
never before  witnessed) the Baron  of Connall asked meekly,  but with
amusement, "Do I know this lucky woman, Clifton?"
    The mist  in the  eyes of  the Lord of  Dargon cleared.  He looked
directly into Luthias' eyes. "I believe you do," Dargon told him. "You
met her  at the Melrin ball.  Lady Lauren, the Winthrops'  cousin. The
one from Magnus."
    The Baron of Connall pondered  a moment, and then the recollection
shone on his  face like a beam of sunshine.  "Oh, yes, the dark-haired
one with the greenish eyes--"
    "Her eyes are blue," Clifton  corrected. "Perhaps a little green,"
he reconsidered. "Blue and green, like the sea," he mused.
    "The one in the white gown,"  continued young Luthias. "The one my
brother  liked." Again,  Luthias  considered the  matter. "That  woman
isn't  married?  But  she's--beautiful. And  charming.  And  educated.
Clifton, what's wrong with her?"
    The Lord of Dargon leapt to his feet. "Wrong with her?" echoed the
Lord of  Dargon in  a most undignified  manner. "Nothing's  wrong with
her." He smiled  affectionately--like a man in  love, thought Luthias.
Clearly, his emotions  were confused enough for it to  be love. "She's
perfect." Dargon  began to pace yet  again. "It's her father.  He will
not give her up."
    "Why not?"
    "Did you meet her father, Luthias?" Luthias thought a moment, then
shook his head. "His name's Marcellon,  and he's a very powerful mage.
He was  trained in Magnus by  the great Styles himself."  Having heard
his late brother prattle on about Styles, wizard to Beinison Emperors,
Luthias was suitably  impressed. "Marcellon was wizard to  the King of
Baranur, until he left a few months ago, before the thaw."
    "Before  the  thaw?"  Luthias repeated,  incredulous.  "Why  would
anyone travel that distance in winter? The conditions--"
    "Were life and death," explained Dargon. He kept on pacing, moving
back and  forth like a  pendulum on a clock.  "It's a long  story, and
Lauren only told me recently, when I asked her for her hand."
    "Fine thing,  to go asking  for a woman  in marriage and  not even
telling your  cousin you're in  love until your advisors  bother you,"
Luthias teased.
    "Quiet, manling," Clifton growled  good-naturedly, using a term he
hadn't employed since the twins were  in their youth. "I..." The ruler
of Dargon  seated himself. "Our  love is so  special that I  wanted to
keep it a secret as long as I could. But then, when I asked her..."
    "Why would he deny you, Clifton?" Luthias wondered. "What could he
object to? You are noble, wealthy, and you are good-natured..."
    "Marcellon  trusts no  man  to treat  his  daughter well  enough,"
Dargon explained.  He made  a grim,  frustrated face,  then continued.
"Some years ago, Marcellon gave Lauren's sister in marriage to a young
noble 'of good character'. A few months later, she was beaten to death
by her  husband." Dargon stared  at his  cousin. "He doesn't  want the
same thing to happen to Lauren."
    "Maybe he just doesn't want the  insanity that grips him to run in
the family," grumbled  Luthias. "Clifton, what's the  problem? When we
were growing up,  you had a crush  on--oh, what was her  name? And you
threatened to  carry her off if  her father objected to  the marriage.
You make the laws around here. Just  throw her over a stallion and run
off and you're married."
    "And separate her from her father? Lauren loves him dearly, and it
would break her heart," Dargon  objected. "Besides, the marriage would
be short-lived, cousin. Remember, Marcellon is a powerful wizard, with
knowledge of the  spells of the great Styles himself.  He could attack
me from a distance of hundreds of leagues."
    "Yes, 'Styles' Death', Roisart told me about it."
    "It's not a pretty or an easy death." Luthias shook his head. "And
while I fear  neither death nor Marcellon,  I have no wish  to die and
leave  the  duchy   with,  if  you  will   forgive  me,  inexperienced
leadership." Luthias smiled a little,  humbly. "Still, I want no other
woman but  Lauren, and  Luthias, I  intend to have  her," the  Lord of
Dargon  finished firmly.  Again, he  looked his  cousin, the  Baron of
Connall, in the eyes. "There is a  way, Luthias. I asked for her hand,
and she told me that her father would be willing, on one condition."
    Luthias shook his head in a disapproving way. "A mage's condition.
I don't like the sound of this, Clifton." When Dargon didn't continue,
Connall prompted, "All right, Clifton. What is this condition?"
    "He requires that I pass a test of his choosing."
    "What kind of test?"
    "Lauren didn't say."
    "She didn't tell you anything?"
    Dargon shook his  head. "Nothing, cousin. But Lauren  told me that
it can be very dangerous."
    His suspicion leapt from dormancy to dominance. "Dangerous? How?"
    Dargon  leaned  back in  his  chair  thoughtfully. "I  don't  know
exactly. Lauren would not tell me  much, either. She said that two men
from Magnus who took the test died--"
    Luthias nearly leapt from his seat. "Died?! Clifton!"
    Dargon shook his head at Connall.  "No, Luthias, it's not what you
think. One had a crossbow that exploded; one died of a sudden seizure,
not caused  by Marcellon.  His purpose  is to  eliminate those  not of
exemplary character, not to hurt anyone."
    "I still don't  like it," Luthias snapped. "I don't  trust it. Two
men have  died, Clifton. And how  do you know Marcellon  did not cause
it? It certainly sounds odd to me that a mage with that power-- And he
left Magnus  in a  hurry, you  said, in  a matter  of life  and death.
Whose? And  why? It all  seems very suspicious  to me, Clifton,  and I
don't want to lose you too!"
    "Luthias, I  don't use  crossbows," the Lord  of Dargon  said with
some  amusement.  "And I  am  not  subject  to seizures."  He  sighed,
shifted. "It was a matter of life and death that Lauren and her father
left Magnus. A matter of their lives or deaths."
    "What, is this Marcellon some sort of criminal?"
    Dargon shook  his head. "Marcellon  has broken no laws  by testing
his  daughter's  suitors. But  the  test  got  him into  trouble.  The
families of the two who died made  no protests; they knew that one had
overestimated his  warrior skills and  that the other was  sickly. But
healthy  young  men have  taken  the  test.  Six  came out  alive  and
unharmed, but they couldn't remember  a thing about the test." Clifton
grimaced. "Four went mad."
    "Mad?" Luthias echoed, startled. "But what could make them mad?"
    "No one knows," admitted the  Lord of Dargon, "and Marcellon won't
tell. Families are not pleased when their sons return a raving lunatic
from  courting.  And  the  last  suitor  was  from  a  very  rich  and
influential family--"
    "They were run out of Magnus  because some rich, foppish fool took
the test and  went mad?" Luthias interrupted. Dargon  nodded. "I'm not
sure if  I like  this, Clifton."  Luthias paused  a moment.  "Have you
presented your suit to her father?"
    "Not yet," Dargon admitted. "I've  been invited to dinner tonight.
I want to ask him then." Dargon made a wrathful face. "Lauren does not
want me to ask."
    "She doesn't want you?"
    Dargon gave  his cousin a quick,  sharp look, then calmed.  "No, I
don't think that's it. At least I hope not, Luthias. I wouldn't pursue
her in that case." A sad,  almost grieving look covered Dargon's face.
"I want to marry her, Luthias. Only her."
    Luthias  stared at  his cousin's  face and  saw the  truth of  it.
Luthias recognized the  expression; it was almost  the same expression
his father had worn when he talked to Luthias and his twin about their
mother, the only  woman their father had ever loved.  And who, through
the birth of Luthias and Roisart, was lost to him forever.
    Luthias stood  and walked over  to his  cousin's desk. He  put his
hand on Dargon's shoulder. Clifton  looked up. "Try for her, Clifton,"
young Luthias advised.
    "That's  not  like  you,  Luthias," Dargon  returned  with  gentle
surprise. "I thought you were the practical one. I could lose my life,
as you pointed out before, and putting myself in jeopardy for personal
reasons is  not something  a ruler should  do..." Clifton  clearly was
reluctant to make such a decision.
    "Well,  yes,"  Luthias admitted,  almost  sheepish  --he had  told
Myrande he wasn't built for loving--"but what's life without love?"
    Cheered, Lord  Clifton Dargon smiled  at his cousin, and  left the
study to dress for dinner.

    How Luthias had been convinced that he should attend the dinner at
the Winthrops'  he was never  certain. For  one thing, he  didn't feel
that  Clifton  really  needed  a   second,  or  that  Marcellon  would
appreciate  the fact  that Clifton  had brought  one. And  if anything
happened to  Clifton, it might be  unseemly for his heir  to have been
the  one responsible  for his  safety.  And there  was Pecora,  little
Pecora, still mourning  over Kite. And only the gods  knew how Luthias
was supposed to act around a great, educated lady and a man trained in
magic by the great Styles.
    The only thing that was  keeping the evening from being completely
uncomfortable was Sable--Myrande  Shipbrook, Luthias' seneschale. Born
six months  after the  twins, Myrande had  known Luthias,  his brother
Roisart, and Clifton all her life.  Her father, who had been castellan
to Luthias'  father until  he died  five years ago,  had been  quite a
valorous man  who had  been awarded knighthood  and arms  by Clifton's
father.  Myrande's mother  had  died  days after  her  father, and  at
fifteen, she became Seneschale of Connall. When Luthias became Baron a
month or  so ago, he  had asked  her to stay  with him, to  manage his
household and  to help him  run the barony;  Myrande was wise  for her
age, and  Luthias had always  respected her  counsel, even when,  as a
boy,  he  had never  heeded  it.  And  now,  Myrande was  helping  him
again--taking care of the  Baron again, Luthias thought ruefully--just
by being her honest, easy-going  self. Luthias sighed, wondering again
whom Sable loved. The  man was a blind fool, not  seeing the beauty in
her black hair and dark eyes nor the beauty of her soul.
    Luthias  watched  Myrande walk  through  the  garden as  Marcellon
approached him and introduced himself. Luthias found himself surprised
that he actually  had met Marcellon. He had been  dressed in red robes
at the Melrin ball,  but now he was dressed in a  courtly suit of grey
and dark blue. As they waited  in the Winthrop garden, Marcellon shook
his hand  kindly. "I  remember you,  Lord Baron,"  said the  mage with
grave kindness,  which surprised Luthias  even more. "You  danced with
Pecora, and your brother danced with my Lauren." Marcellon smiled. "It
was a brave thing your brother did that night."
    Luthias smiled awkwardly. "Braver than I, milord."
    Marcellon lifted his eyebrows. "Would  you not have done the same,
if you  had seen the  opportunity?" Luthias considered a  moment, then
nodded. "Do  not say  he was  braver, then."  Marcellon looked  at the
bench where Lauren  and Clifton sat talking. "I know  that Lord Dargon
has  come to  ask for  her." Luthias  looked at  his shoes.  Marcellon
smiled. "Don't  worry, Lord  Baron. I  do not ask  you to  betray your
cousin. But," and the smile grew wider,  "I am not a blind man. I have
seen  the  way  they  look  at one  another,  their  eyes  the  secret
messengers  of the  hearts. I've  seen it  before, though,"  Marcellon
sighed, and his eyes narrowed. "Although  I doubt I've ever seen a man
so serious about her--or Lauren so serious about any man."
    Luthias did not know how to respond. Clearly, Marcellon was a wise
and observant man, yet strong in  his convictions. The old man smiled.
"Come,  milord  Baron.  We  are expected  for  dinner,"  then,  toward
Clifton, "my lord?"
    "In a moment,  father," responded Lauren, her  blue-green eyes not
leaving Clifton's.
    The two  sat silently  and watched as  Marcellon and  Luthias made
their way from  the garden, then Lauren turned to  Clifton and clasped
his hand  strongly. Lauren cast  a quick look over  her shoulder--Lady
Myrande was still walking forlornly alone. But Lauren knew--there were
things she  just knew--that she  need not  fear Myrande. It  was well;
Lauren needed to speak quickly.
    "Clifton, you know it's wrong to put yourself before the duchy..."
    He smiled at her warmly. "Yes,  Lauren, I know, but I've spent the
past days weighing this decision. The duchy needs a direct heir, and I
want you to be  my wife and the mother of  our children. Your father's
test is not meant to harm  people, only to determine whether they will
treat you as  you deserve... and, well,  I love you, and  I think that
I'd be  able to treat you  well..." His sentence trailed  off; Clifton
couldn't believe he felt embarrassed.
    "But, Clifton,  it could be  dangerous! I  don't want any  harm to
come to you."
    Clifton shifted  on the bench.  "But I  won't be hurt,  Lauren. It
will turn out  for the best. Once  this is done we  shall be married."
Lauren wasn't convinced by Clifton's insatiable optimism, and her eyes
showed her deep concern, equally beyond reason.
    "Clifton... Listen  to me.  I've heard those  very words  nearly a
dozen times. Each time, I watched  as they confidently went to ask for
my hand.  Each time I secretly  hoped they would succeed,  for I truly
cared  for them.  And each  time I  watched as  they returned,  having
failed, and I felt their hurt,  their shame. Somehow their failure was
equally my failure, for I had not discouraged them. And, Clifton, I've
got far too much  at stake to let you fail. Can't  you see? I couldn't
stand to  see you fail  - not  for the duchy,  but for myself.  If you
failed, it would kill me! I love  you, can't you see that? I can't let
you fail."  Lauren paused, anguish  in her  eyes. "If you  were hurt--
gods, Clifton, if you lost your mind--"
    Impulsively, the  Duke of  Dargon put his  arms around  Lauren and
held her close. "Shhh, love, I'll  be fine," he assured her. He kissed
her gently.
    They sat  quietly as a gentle  breeze moved the trees  above them.
Finally, Clifton said,  "I Lauren, I must try. You  know the saying as
well  as  I, 'Nothing  risked,  nothing  gained'. You  cannot  achieve
anything if you aren't  willing to put what you have  at the outset at
risk. And a  man isn't a man  if he stops achieving  better things for
himself and those he loves. So, you see, I have to do this... It's the
right thing, believe me. I love you,  and I don't want to live without
you, and if I don't try, I'll fail you, and myself."
    Lauren  reluctantly accepted  Clifton's  words. "I  love you  too,
Clifton. And I don't think I'd love you as much if you weren't willing
to  do this.  But remember,  you're  risking far  more than  yourself;
you're putting the  duchy and everyone in  it at risk, and  me. I pray
you do not falter...if you did fail,  I hate to think of your cousin."
She gazed  at Luthias, who was  standing on a patio,  watching Myrande
and speaking with Marcellon. "He's  lost his father and brother; could
he lose you too, and be a Duke? Clifton, he's only twenty-one."
    "I know;  believe me. But," and  Clifton smiled, "my love,  it was
Luthias, practical,  sensible Luthias,  who convinced  me to  do this.
It'll be all right," he assured her, kissing her again.
    There was a sudden crash  behind them. "Clod!" Luthias called with
teasing familiarity.
    "Luthias?" Myrande  called, rising to  her feet. "Just  twisted an
ankle,"  she answered  Clifton's  questioning  glance. "Luthias,  come
here, please. I need you."
    Luthias moved toward  her. Lauren smiled and said  softly, so only
Clifton would hear,  "He hears the words, but misses  the message." At
the Duke's confusion, Lauren asked, "Didn't you know that Lady Myrande
is in love with your cousin?"
    "Of course.  My uncle Fionn,  Luthias' father, told me  some years
ago when he asked Myrande whom she wished to wed. How did you know?"
    Lauren shrugged. "I just know."
    "You're  changing  the  subject,"   Clifton  accused  with  amused
severity. "You still don't want me to do this?"
    Lauren looked  pained. "Clifton, I want  to marry you. I  love you
more than any other man in the world. I can't bear it if I lost you."
    "Then there's nothing  more to do than try,"  Clifton said firmly.
He helped to her feet. "Now, come, let's catch up with the others."

    Clifton and Luthias were set opposite Marcellon and Lauren. At one
end of the table sat Lady and Lord Winthrop, an interesting couple who
probably would have  felt more comfortable with  Clifton's father, but
they managed to  keep an incessant chatter alive at  the table. At the
other end sat the two women: Pecora and Sable. Pecora was the daughter
of  the Winthrop's,  a dark-haired  woman with  whom both  Clifton and
Luthias had shared their childhood, and  whom had been through so much
recently. Sable, or Lady Myrande as  she was called by everyone except
Luthias and occasionally Clifton, was  certainly the more beautiful of
the two, a dark  beauty, the Belle of Connall, as  some had called her
before she had  become seneschale and stopped going  to balls. Luthias
smiled.  It was  long held  a rumor  that Myrande  Shipbrook had  been
promised to one of the twin lords of Connall.
    Luthias noted that  Clifton was in a serious  mood, and understood
why, but it made the conversation  drag. Although everyone in the room
were old  friends, there was  an air of  awkwardness in the  room. The
group had gone through a lot in  the past few months. Pecora had taken
ill and  then Kite had  disappeared mysteriously. People  also avoided
talking about  Luthias' brother  and father, as  well (he  wished they
wouldn't avoid them; part of Luthias needed to know that he wasn't the
only  person who  remembered or  missed Roisart  and his  father). And
there was Clifton  and Lauren, and surely everyone  present knew about
Clifton's intent. Only Sable seemed at ease, Luthias noted. He smiled.
Sometimes he thought she was the only thing that kept him sane.
    The  feast ended.  Luthias was  relieved when  his cousin  finally
broached the subject of his suit to Marcellon.
    "Lord Marcellon,  your daughter  and I have  spoken at  length. We
wish to be  married. I ask for your blessing."  Luthias was impressed;
Clifton's tone was that of a request bordering on a demand.
    Marcellon's face  betrayed nothing of  what the man  was thinking,
but he  replied, choosing his  words carefully, "My daughter  has told
you of my whim?"
    "Yes, milord."
    "And you wish to prove yourself worthy of her in my eyes?"
    "Yes,  sir,"  Clifton  replied  firmly. Lauren  closed  her  eyes.
Myrande saw the grief in Lauren's  face, but could do nothing. Clifton
saw it, and touched her hand beneath the table.
    "Very  well,"  Marcellon  agreed.   "You  will  be  provided  with
everything necessary to prove yourself. When do you wish to begin?"
    Clifton had  committed himself now,  and Luthias knew  it. Clifton
gazed across  the table at  his cousin. If  he failed--if he  died, or
lost his  mind--this man,  this young  man, would  become the  Duke of
Dargon. Luthias knew this, saw the concern in his cousin's eyes.
    He's asking my consent for this,  Luthias thought. As if he needed
it. Luthias nodded to his cousin, and heard the words he had used this
afternoon: Try for her.
    "If it is possible, this evening," Clifton requested.
    "Very well."  Then, turning to Lord  Winthrop, his brother-in-law,
"With your permission, shall we adjourn to the sitting room?" The host
nodded, and the  group rose. Clifton, Marcellon and  Lord Winthrop led
silently, with Lauren hanging uncertainly  near Clifton and the others
behind, secretly  exchanging concerned  expressions. They  reached the
sitting room far too quickly for Luthias' comfort.
    Myrande squeezed his arm. "It's all right, Luthias."
    The old mystic motioned for Clifton  to sit facing him. "You shall
be facing great peril, though the purpose of this test is not to prove
your prowess at  arms or to harm  you. You choose any  weapon or armor
you desire. What do you wish?"
    Luthias could  see Clifton's mind  racing, and could also  see the
unquiet expression he bore. "Are arms and armor necessary to succeed?"
    Marcellon's brow rose in curiosity. "They are not."
    "Then I shall bear neither."
    "As you wish. In  a moment, I shall ask you to  submit to my will,
and to allow me to penetrate your  self. This will not be painful, but
you must concentrate  upon opening yourself to me. I  shall create the
test within  your mind  as an  illusion. You will  find yourself  in a
corridor. You will find an object of beauty, and you need retrieve it,
and I shall bring you back to this room. Are you prepared?"
    The  Duke of  Dargon took  and  released one  large breath  before
replying. "I am."

    Clifton shared  a final  glance with  Lauren, which  dispelled any
doubts left  within him, although  her face  was filled with  fear. He
nodded to Marcellon, and closed his eyes. He had no formal training in
wizardry, but there were books in the ducal library and in the college
at Magnus  which had discussed it.  He envisioned a door  in his chest
and willed it  open, feeling the vulnerability  and insecurity beneath
his outward strength  and resolution. He kept his  mind from wandering
and concentrated upon it.
    He suddenly  knew that  Marcellon was within  him; not  within his
body,  but within  his mind.  Startled at  the alien  feeling, Clifton
opened his  eyes, but still saw  nothing. Suddenly, as if  he had been
thrown into  a pond,  there was  another person  within him.  His eyes
could see,  but what they saw  was definitely strange. He  was sitting
with several other  people in a small  circle at the edge  of a field,
eating something that  looked very much like worms in  red mud. Around
them stood  several canvas shelters  which stood of their  own accord.
One of the  people near him, a dark-haired woman  in a revealing white
tunic, turned suddenly toward him and spoke.
    "Well, I think you look more like Luthias than Clifton..."
    As he went to  speak, he felt his lips moving,  yet the words that
he  spoke were  not  his own.  "Well, of  course,  everyone will  have
different pictures  of what's  been written  about, like  the climate.
I've always pictured Dargon as being like Maine, but other people will
have different ideas..."
    Clifton thought  he felt the  third person  leave his mind  as his
eyes drained; then he lost consciousness.

    Clifton awoke  in a  grey stone passageway,  lit by  an occasional
sconce. To either side the  corridor continued perhaps 30 paces before
ending, a door at each end.  Clifton waited several moments to be sure
that his head was clear, then walked down the passageway to his left.
    He stopped  before the  large wooden  door, his  conversation with
Marcellon going through his mind once more. The test was to bring back
something of beauty. Clifton gathered himself and opened the door.
    Any  semblance of  secrecy he  had  desired was  shattered by  the
protest of the seemingly ancient door. That decided, Clifton swung the
door more forcibly open and strode  into the huge room beyond. What he
saw was enough  to make him take several steps  backward. The room was
dominated by  a large  grayish mound surrounded  by hundreds  of huge,
black insects. They were built like wasps,  but each was the size of a
small dog. The noise of the door  had created a commotion, and the air
about the nest was full of the insects. Clifton watched in horror as a
single insect, larger than the others,  emerged from the nest and rose
to the air. The  other insects flocked to follow it as  it led the way
toward the intruder.
    Clifton, of  course, knew what he  faced. There was a  story which
parents  would  tell  their  children about  such  insects.  It  would
normally  scare the  children enough  to keep  them from  playing with
hornet and wasp nests and getting  hurt. Clifton, as a child, had even
told the story to his cousins,  Luthias and Roisart, and Myrande, when
he was the lordly  age of twelve, and they were but  six and five. The
Wasp-King cruelly ruled  all flying insects by terror.  His temper was
swift and his  bite death. His greatest treasures was  his colony, and
the colony's  greatest treasure was  a flower which it  kept preserved
inside the hive.
    Clifton knew that the flower was to be the object of his test, and
his heart  sank. He had always  held a secret fear  of flying insects,
and his fear  now was maddening. The Wasp-King arrived  and dropped to
the ground less than an arm-length  before him as his comrades circled
above. The thing, for Clifton could  not call it a beast, twitched and
turned, its antennae  brushing Clifton, who dared  not move. Suddenly,
he heard the thing speaking within his mind; the absolute alienness of
the  thing inside  his  head  threw him  violently  to  the ground.  A
thousand voices echoed, "WHY DOES IT INVADE US?"
    The assault  ended, and Clifton  rose to  his hands and  spoke. "I
have been sent... I have need  of your flower, your treasure." Clifton
dared  not raise  his  head to  look at  the  abomination. He  steeled
himself for another assault.
    "WHY DOES IT NEED OUR TREASURE-FLOWER?"
    "I wish to marry a woman of  my race. It will only be permitted if
I bring back the flower."
    "IT MAY NOT HAVE THE TREASURE-FLOWER."
    Clifton felt  enraged for a moment,  and it blocked out  his fear.
For a  wild moment, he  wanted to  attack the Wasp-King,  splatter its
brains on the  floor. But better sense prevailed; he  was unarmed, and
even if  he had a  legendary sword, he  could not succeed  against the
wasp horde.  Besides, he bore them  no ill. He thought  of Lauren, and
spoke again.
    "I again ask  you for your treasure-flower. I will  not be able to
marry the woman without it."
    The sea of emotionless voices returned unmercifully. "IT IS NOT OF
US; WE DO  NOT CARE. MANY ITS  HAVE INVADED US AND  ATTACKED OUR HIVE;
WHY? THIS IT DOES NOT ATTACK; IT SPEAKS. WHY?"
    Clifton knew no  way to explain why other humans  had come and why
they  had acted  differently. "The  others were  renegades." Well,  it
wasn't quite accurate, but maybe  they'd understand the basic gist. "I
speak because I am  wiser, and have no need to attack,  for I mean you
no harm. I only come for the treasure-flower."
    "IT MEANS US  NO HARM? THE OTHER ITS HAVE  INVADED US AND ATTACKED
US WITH BLADES. THIS IT WILL DO THE SAME."
    "No, I mean no harm," Clifton  repeated. A thought struck him. "If
I can have the  flower, I will leave, and I will  insure that no other
'its' will come to attack you."
    The thing buzzed and twitched,  and Clifton breathed deeply, still
on his  hands and knees.  At least he  wasn't in imminent  danger. The
legend had said nothing about the  things being able to talk, and that
was the most painful part of the ordeal. Then the voices returned.
    "IT MAY  HAVE THE  TREASURE-FLOWER, BUT  IT MUST  PROVE IT  IS NOT
RENEGADE. IT MUST GO AMONG US AND GET TREASURE-FLOWER."
    Clifton didn't  quite understand the  words, but his  contact with
the thing told him that the flower  would be just within the hive. The
Wasp-King rose into the air as Clifton stumbled to his feet.
    The distance was  less than 30 paces, but it  took Clifton several
minutes.  The insects  were all  around him,  and he  stumbled blindly
toward the hive. He  closed his eyes and put his  hands over his ears,
but he  couldn't block out  their feelers  or their wings,  which were
constantly  around him.  He couldn't  block out  the droning  of their
wings, or the  memory of their eyes. Nor their  insane presense in his
mind. It took all  his will to keep from running, but  he knew that if
he did,  they would flock to  attack him, stinging him  repeatedly. He
struggled onward, until he reached  the papery hive entry, which stood
about half his height. He rolled onto  his back and stuck his head and
arms underneath the  opening and felt above the  entry. Finally coming
upon what  seemed to be a  large flower, he carefully  removed it from
the wall and struggled out.
    He opened  his eyes only  long enough to be  sure that he  had the
flower, and began walking slowly  back toward the doorway. The insects
slowly dispersed,  and he finally stumbled  the last few steps  to the
doorway. There had never been a  sound so delightful to Clifton as the
complaint of the iron-shod oak and the satisfying boom of it as it met
the  jam. Exhausted,  Clifton  sank  to the  floor,  propped his  back
against the door, and slept.

    Luthias began  to wonder  why someone  hadn't asked  Marcellon how
long this  thing would last. It  had been several minutes,  but no one
had dared to leave  the room, least of all Luthias,  with Sable at his
side, and  Lauren. Would this take  minutes or hours, or  days? No one
had spoken; everyone was watching Clifton, yet his countenance had not
changed since they had begun. His long face showed little of the youth
it  had when  he and  Luthias had  spent more  time together.  Nor had
Marcellon's, of course, as he been in some sort of trance as well.
    "How long?" Luthias finally asked Lady Lauren.
    She stopped pacing,  stared a him a moment. "A  few more minutes,"
she faltered. "Not long, Lord Luthias,"  she assured him, with a shaky
attempt at a smile. "It is never long."
    Myrande looked at  the seemingly sleeping Duke. "I  don't like the
way he breathes," she said, noting Clifton's labored pants.
    Lauren whirled upon Luthias. "Is anything wrong with his heart?"
    No one noticed the informality.  Luthias shook his head. "He loves
you. Don't  worry," Luthias tried  to convince Lauren, but  he sounded
too worried himself. He grimaced and walked away a few steps.
    Lauren watched  as Myrande  followed Luthias  with her  eyes. When
Luthias was out  of earshot, she asked, "How long have you loved him?"
    Myrande appeared  startled. "Since I was  sixteen, seventeen." She
smiled. "Is it so obvious?"
    "I just  know things,  sometimes," Lauren reassured  her. "Clifton
said something about you asking Luthias' father for his hand..."
    "Not exactly,  my lady,"  Myrande replied, watching  Luthias. They
were  speaking softly,  and Luthias  looked like  he had  slipped into
another world. "When  I was sixteen, Luthias' father,  Fionn, asked me
if there was any man I preferred, so he could see about a marriage for
me. I told him, and he said  we should wait." She swallowed. "And so I
have waited."
    "And you  can't stop loving  him?" Myrande shook her  head. Lauren
sighed.  "I never  knew  what that  was  like...until Clifton..."  She
looked at her love, still breathing heavily. "It should be soon..."
    Soon, indeed  they both  showed signs of  waking up,  and everyone
watched  anxiously as  Clifton took  a deep  breath. Both  Luthias and
Lauren caught their  breath as they saw the haunted  look in Clifton's
eyes as he opened them, then slumped back into the chair.
    "He is fine, just let him  rest a while." Marcellon said groggily.
Luthias thought that Marcellon could probably use the rest as well.
    Still, Lauren  went to the  Duke's side. Clifton opened  his eyes,
smiled weakly. "Flower, my lady?" he asked, holding out to her a white
rose, but his hand fell weakly to his chest, and he gave in to sleep.
    "Father!" came Lauren's cry. Luthias  saw her pointing at Clifton,
and noticed,  for the first time,  a delicate white papery  rose lying
across his chest, and knew what it meant. Luthias grinned, most of the
tension leaving him. Sable was suddenly  beside him, and they shared a
smile. Lauren continued whooping--there was  no other word for it--"He
did it! We have your blessing?"
    Marcellon looked stern. "I will have to give it some thought."
    Luthias' grin crashed and was deformed into a frown. "What?"
    Lauren's expression was one which  only a father could bear. "But,
father, he's done it! He's fulfilled the test! He's proven himself."
    "Yes, he has. He is a good man, and I promise to let you know if I
find him acceptable."
    "Find  him acceptable?"  Luthias  was startled  to hear  Myrande's
voice. He  stared at her.  She was angry,  a black kitten  with claws.
"What do  you mean? He loves  her, Lord Marcellon. Don't  you know how
lucky she is to love a man who actually loves her back?"
    Luthias winced.  Marcellon looked at Lady  Myrande sorrowfully and
shook his head. "There ss more to it, milady. You do not understand."
    "What  is there  to understand?  You are  denying me  what I  have
waited years to  have! Father, he's passed your damned  test, and he's
the Lord of Dargon! I refuse to allow you to be so unreasonable."
    "Unreasonable?"  Marcellon thundered.  "Would you  end up  as your
sister did?"
    "Clifton would never so abuse me," Lauren said haughtily, pride in
her eyes and her posture.
    "You cannot have him," Marcellon announced with finality.
    "No!" Lauren replied.
    "What?" Marcellon asked, his voice incredulous and furious.
    "I  said no.  I love  him, and  if you  cannot find  it in  you to
approve after  he has  gone through  so much, then  I shall  marry him
without your blessing!"
    "I am a wizard and--"
    "I know that you're  a wizard. Do you think I  am without power of
my own--or that I fear you more than I love Clifton? Father, I've seen
some of your  books and I know  some of your tricks. You  may kill us,
but it will take  time and effort, and in the end,  at least we'll die
together!" Lauren turned to Luthias. "Help me take Clifton home."
    Luthias moved  to lift his cousin,  and Lauren turned to  him, but
her father grabbed her wrist.
    "You defy me, then?"
    Lauren's head  was high. "I  love him,  Father. I will  marry him,
with or without your consent."
    Marcellon slumped into a chair and closed his eyes. "Thank God."
    Lauren was on the defensive. "What?"
    Marcellon  smiled  and  waited  before  continuing.  "Now  listen,
Lauren. Clifton  has proved himself  worthy of  you. No other  man has
passed my test of him--gaining  something delicate, such as your love,
without using  force. But what  if you did not  love him? I  would not
allow you to marry someone whom you did not love, even if he succeeded
in passing my test."
    Lauren was wondering if she should  faint. "Then why the test? Why
didn't you just ask me whom I loved?"
    "I did  not want you  beaten and abused, dearest,"  Marcellon said
affectionately. "If  you remember,  your sister  loved her  husband. I
wanted that test,  to keep you alive  and happy. But if  the right man
passed, and you did not love him..."
    "But you knew I loved Clifton!"
    "Yes, and you  loved the others, but would you  have defied me for
any of them?" Lauren shook her head. "I thought not. And so, there was
a second test, my dear. Your test."
    "What?" Lauren seemed on the edge of fury.
    "You had to  be worthy of him,  as well. Until you  defied me, you
had not proved yourself  or your love to me. I know  you must be angry
with me, but it was necessary."
    Lauren  understood, though  she clearly  had not  approved of  her
father  toying  with her.  "I  understand,  Father." She  returned  to
Clifton's side and he quietly smiled. With that, the last of her anger
vanished.
    "Put  him  down,  Lord  Luthias,"  Marcellon  commanded,  smiling.
"Lauren, wake him."
    Something gentle and soft touched  Clifton's lips, and he woke. "I
brought  you a  flower, Lauren,"  he  mumbled. Then  he saw  Marcellon
standing behind  his daughter. Luthias  felt distinctly out  of place.
Clifton stood  proudly, although he  felt exhausted. "I ask  again for
your blessing."
    Marcellon smiled  and bowed.  "You have it,  your grace--or  may I
say, my son?"
    Clifton  cheered, grabbed  Lauren,  kissed her  lips, twirled  her
through  the  air. She  laughed  like  a  girl. Marcellon  beamed  his
approval, until finally Clifton put  down the man's daughter and shook
his future father-in-law's hand.
    "Thank  you...Father,"  Clifton   said.  Marcellon  embraced  him.
Clifton  turned to  Luthias. "Come  on, manling,  we've got  a lot  of
planning to do."
    "Where are we going and what are we planning?"
    "Home--the wedding, manling, the wedding!"
    "When will you be getting married?" Marcellon asked.
    Clifton blinked, then looked at Lauren. "Next week?"
    "Next week?!" Marcellon protested.
    "I don't  want to wait,"  Clifton said dreamily, putting  his arms
around Lauren.
    "Nor I," Lauren agreed, laying her head on his shoulder.
    "So soon..." Marcellon said uncertainly.
    "What's to be gained by waiting?" Luthias argued practically.
    "Very  well,"  Marcellon  agreed, smiling.  "Next  week."  Clifton
kissed his bride as a celebration of the concession.
    Marcellon touched Luthias' shoulder. "Come, milord. I think they'd
prefer to be alone."
    Unnoticed, Marcellon, Myrande, and  Luthias left the room. Walking
through the  halls, Luthias  offered his arm  to Myrande.  She smiled,
took it.  "Well," sighed the  Baron of  Connall, "it looks  like we're
having  a wedding  after all,  Sable." Sable  laughed softly.  Luthias
stopped, looked at her. "I'm sorry it can't be yours."
    Myrande elevated herself on her  toes, and kissed his cheek. "Give
it  time, my  lord," she  said, smiling.  She leaned  on his  shoulder
contently. "Give it time."
