                              X-Editorial
    Hello!  Since this  issue  follows  right on  the  heels of  10-3,
there's really  no new news  to bring up, and I honestly don't want to
bore you  with the  standard editorial comments,  so I'll  depart from
tradition and, as it were, editorialize a bit.
    You  know, running  a magazine  is a  fascinating experience.  No,
really!  The  strangest things  happen.  For  instance, for  over  two
years readers  have been commenting  that although the  Dargon Project
is excellent, they'd  like to see more non-Dargon  fantasy stories and
more science  fiction in FSFnet.  And, for  over two years,  I've been
replying  with the  standard disclaimer  that  I can  only print  what
people  submit, and  that no  one  is submitting  anything but  Dargon
stories.  Well,  within  the  past   two  weeks  I've  received  seven
non-Dargon  stories from  five  different authors,  with promises  for
more. It's  enough to make an  editor want to take  up something sane,
like professional  wrestling! But don't  mind me, it's healthy  for an
editor to rave - it only *looks* like insanity.
    There  are   some  interesting  differences  between   editing  an
electronic magazine  and a  'real' one.  An electronic  magazine must,
by nature,  be freely  distributable, because  it is  so easy  to send
copies   along  to   non-subscribers.  To   offset  this,   electronic
magazines  do not  need  to  worry about  advertising  costs, as  most
network services  are glad  to make room  for a  magazine announcement
or information  file. There is  also a  closer tie between  the editor
and the  readership of an emag,  due to the ease  of communication via
electronic mail.  But the  most noteworthy  difference is  inherent in
the  difference between  the  phosphor screen  and  the printed  page.
Most  people find  that the  attention span  of an  individual reading
one article  from a  computer screen  is much less  than if  they were
reading printed  text. The  repercussions this has  for emags  is that
their  articles should  be  short  and to  the  point, like  newspaper
articles, and  issues should be  small and frequent rather  than large
and infrequent.  Of course, FSFnet is  no exception to this  rule, and
I'm sure that  many people simply never get to  their issues. However,
I find  that most people  who are serious  FSFnet readers do  not read
issues at a  terminal, but print them out and  read the hardcopy, thus
successfully avoiding the problem.
    Well,  before I  bore  you  all to  tears  with  subjects only  an
editor could  enjoy, I'd better sign  off and get this  issue sent. My
welcome  to all  the  people  who have  recently  subscribed, and  for
BITNET  readers,   don't  be  shy   about  appending  to   the  FSFNET
discussion on the server  CSNEWS@MAINE.  And, of  course, back  issues
are available from the server LISTSERV@TCSVM.

                             A Wyrm's Tale
    The  warrior sat  near the  mouth of  the lair  and planned.  Soon
would come  the time when  the wyrm would  sleep. Then there  would be
no time to waste. He must be swift or he would fail like the rest.
    "There,"  he thought.  "The  sunset approaches.  It  is time."  He
gathered up  his equipment and  gingerly picked  up the weapon  he had
spent many  years to  find and more  to secure. It  was rumored  to be
the only thing  that could kill the dreaded wyrm...  a creature he had
sworn to  slay or die  in the process.  He entered into  the darkeness
of the cave.
    Through the darkness  he crept, moving slowly and  silently as not
to awaken the  wyrm. Many years had he perpared  for this moment. Only
if  the wyrm  slept  would he  be  able  to slip  his  blade into  the
creature's chest.
    "That  glow must  be  the  wyrm's chambers,"  he  said quietly  to
himself, "where he sleeps on his golden bed. Quietly. I mustn't fail."

    "Hello," a  deep vioce  said as the  warrior entered  the chamber.
The warrior  stood paralyzed as the  wyrm's massive head rose  to look
him straight in the eye.
    "I knew that it  was too good to be true," the  wyrm said. "It has
been so  many years  since the  last one,  I had  hoped the  world had
forgotten  me." The  warrior was  aghast when  a glint  showed in  the
wyrm's eye.
    "Ahhhh...."  the  wyrm  said,   obviously  statisfied.  "You  have
brought back Wirmhyr. Then you are welcome."
    "Back, horrid  wyrm," the warrior  said, drawing Wirmhyr  from its
sheath. "Or surely this blade will find its mark!"
    "I  beg your  pardon,"  the wryrm  said. "I  think  you are  quite
mistaken. There isn't a blade of this world that can pierce my hide."
    "I have come  to end your reign of terror,"  the warrior announced
in a  formal challenge.  "You have murdered  your last  maiden, stolen
your last cattle...."
    "I think you  have come to the wrong cave,"  the wyrm said calmly.
The warrior was somewhat taken aback.
    "Is this not the cave of Kravaxx the Golden?" the warrior asked.
    "It is," the wyrm replied.
    "Then I have come to the right place," the warroir said flatly.
    "I beg to differ," the wyrm said.
    "You beg to what?" the warrior asked, incredously.
    "I am Kravaxx  the Golden," the wyrm  said, "but it ha  been a few
centuries since I  have stolen cattle and never have  I slain a maiden
that didn't deserve it."
    "I do not understand," the warrior said, confused.
    "Look,"  the wyrm  said, "it  isn't difficult.  The last  maiden I
murdered, if  you want to  call it that, was  Karita the Loud.  And if
you ask me, it was more a mercy killing."
    The warrior then smiled and raised Wirmhyr confidently.
    "I understand  you now,  wyrm," he  said. "You  try to  confuse me
and lure me  into a trap. It will  not work, for I have  heard of this
trick before. You are beaten, wyrm."
    "By the  gods, you are  thick," Kravaxx  said. "Look, if  it would
make you  happy, I  will let  you strike  once with  Wirmhyr. Anywhere
you like,  except the face.  I put so much  work getting this  face to
look as perfect as it does - I wouldn't want you to scratch a scale."
    "Again you confuse me, wyrm" the warrior said.
    "Give it your  best swing," the wyrm said. "Go  ahead. I will even
pretend that  I am sleeping."  And with  that, the wyrm  promptly laid
down, as  if to  rest. The  warrior stood, wondering  what to  do, and
decided  that it  couldn't hurt  to give  it a  try. If  he was  fast,
which he  was, he could  be in and out  before the wyrm  could strike.
So,  preparing  himself and  carefully  choosing  a likely  spot,  the
warrior darted  in and  swung Wirmhyr  with all  his might.  The blade
whistled through the air as it came around.
    And  then  bounced  off  the  thick scales  of  the  wyrm  with  a
resounding clang.
    The  warrior was  too scared  to even  move. The  wyrm opened  his
eyes and turned  its huge head toward the warrior.  Praying to his god
and preparing  for a blast  of the  wyrm's firery breath,  the warrior
could only stare.
    "See, I told you so." was the only thing the wyrm said.

                      A Summer's Day:  June, 2084
    It was wasting-time again.
    Jason hated  wasting-time, hated  it like  poison. Not  because of
the wasting  itself, but because  of the messiness that  always seemed
to go with it.  Jason was a very clean boy,  and despised being messy.
he would  have condemned wasting-time  altogether had it not  been for
the  fact  that his  birthday  was  on the  second  day  of the  third
wasting-time  of  every  ninth  month. As  it  was,  wasting-time  was
hated, but tolerated.
    Jason  slipped out  of  bed  and headed  for  the shower;  another
reason  to  hate wasting-time.  Jason  liked  to  get  in and  out  as
quickly  as   possible,  every  action  intentional   and  economical.
Instead, he  scoured himself three  times with the rough  soap, doused
his hair with  shampoo, rinsed himself with too much  water. Which, of
course, was the entire purpose of a waste-day: to waste things.
    After  using two  towels to  dry off  and too  much toothpaste  to
clean his  teeth, Jason cleared  out of the  bathroom to make  way for
his  sister, Janice--  who, when  it came  to the  bathroom, used  too
much  of   everything  anyway.   Except,  of   course,  when   it  was
fasting-time. Janice  brushed by him  with a  sniff and shut  the door
firmly behind her.
    The lights in  the hall were all on, which  meant that his parents
were  already up.  Jason groaned.  Whenever possible,  Jason liked  to
make  his own  breakfast  on waste-days,  sparing  himself the  almost
sickening  culinary  orgy  that  was  the norm.  He  padded  into  the
kitchen, resigning himself to the inevitable. "Hi, mom." he said.
    "Why, hello, Jason."  she answered. "Breakfast will be  ready in a
minute. Just  sit down at  the table--but turn  on a couple  of radios
while you're up."
    Jason snapped  on two of the  several radios within a  few feet of
him,  then sat  down.  he studied  his mother  as  she deftly  flipped
eggs, fried bacon,  buttered toast and English  muffins, opened canned
fruit, poured  milk and orange  juice, and  carried out all  the other
myriad  responsibilities  of making  breakfast  on  a waste-day.  Mrs.
Grady Powers  was a  tall, graceful  woman in  her late  thirties. Her
darkish hair,  beginning to show signs  of grey, was let  down so that
it  fell  around  her  shoulders,  one  of  the  outward  signs  of  a
waste-day that Jason had come to notice.
    As  Jason's mother  finished  her cooking  and  began placing  the
heaping platters  on the table,  his father  walked in. He  raised the
radios' volume and turned on a third. "Smells good." he commented.
    Jason  wrinkled  his  nose  in  distaste.  His  father  reeked  of
cologne on wasting-days.
    "What?" asked Jason's mother.
    "I said," repeated his father, loudly, "it smells good!"
    "Thank you!" she replied, with similar of volume. "Eat up!"
    Jason's father  sat down and  began shoveling food into  his mouth
with his  fork. Jason did so  less rapidly. Janice came  in, sat down,
and started complaining that waste-days ruined her diet.
    "Eat." said  Jason's father, around  a mouthful of  bacon. "You'll
be thankful for it next time fasting-time comes around."
    "Terrific." she said, and began to eat.
    Jason played with  his food, hoping to disguise  his reluctance to
consume as much as his parents and sister.
    "You  too, Jason."  his mother  said. "A  growing boy  has got  to
eat." Jason scowled.  On fasting-days his mother said that  to not eat
when one was hungry built character.
    "I'm not hungry." he muttered sullenly. "I hate waste-days."
    "Now,  Jason." his  father  admonished. "You  know that  everybody
needs   a  proper   balance   of  attitudes.   That's   why  we   have
wasting-time. If we  didn't have wasting-time, there  would be nothing
to  balance  out fasting-time.  If  we  didn't have  lazy-time,  there
would be nothing to balance out work-time. If we didn't have. . ."
    "If  we didn't  have any  times  at all,"  Jason interrupted,  "we
could do  whatever we wanted and  we wouldn't have to  do whatever the
Shrinks told us to."
    "Jason!"  his   mother  exclaimed.  "You  should   be  ashamed  of
yourself!  The Shrinks  only want  what is  good for  us! Eat  another
bagel, this instant!"
    Jason grabbed  a bagel and began  stuffing it in his  mouth. "With
cream cheese." his sister mocked. Jason HATED cream cheese.
    "Shut up,  wart." he answered.  He crammed  the rest of  the bagel
into his mouth and swallowed hugely.
    "Just because  you don't like doing  something is no reason  to be
surly, young  man." Jason's  father said firmly.  "Just for  that, you
wash your dishes last."
    "Aww,  dad. .  ." Jason  whined.  Washing your  dishes last  meant
waiting around  an hour  and a  half while  everyone else  did theirs.
Jason ate in silence for five minutes, then asked to be excused.
    His mother examined  his plate critically, then told  him he could
watch TVs until  it was time to wash the  dishes. "And tape something,
too." she called.
    Finally, two  hours later, Jason put  away the last of  his dishes
and  went  outside,  heading  for Robert  Bond's  house.  Jason  liked
Robert. He could always think of neat things to do.
    Jason walked down  the street, kicking pebbles.  Robert lived only
four houses  down, but Jason  took the  long way around,  circling the
block. The  cool air felt  good upon his skin.  he squinted up  at the
sun, enjoying  its warmth. All  in all, he decided,  a good day  to be
alive, except for the wasting.
    Robert's house  was a neat  little two-story brick  edifice. Jason
went up  the walkway  and rang  the bell. Robert  opened the  door and
grinned when  he saw Jason.  "Hi, Jase." he  said. "I knew  you'd come
by. What do you want to waste today?"
    "How about time?" Jason asked, hopefully.
    "That's  for lazy-time,  dummy."  Robert  answered. "Let's  waste,
uh, let's waste film!"
    "Okay."  Jason  said.  Jason  liked photography--not  as  much  as
Robert, who  had glossy photos all  over his walls, but  enough not to
mind  spending the  day snapping  his shutter  at everything  he could
find. "Get your stuff."
    Robert ducked  inside, re-emerging  half a  minute later  with his
camera and a  bag full of film.  "Come on." he said.  "Let's go." They
walked towards Jason's house.
    "I  wish  we  could  just  use  your  stuff."  Jason  said.  "It's
inconvenient to have to walk back to my house."
    "It's not that  far." returned Robert. "Besides,  rules are rules.
Everyone has  to waste  his own  stuff or the  Shrinks won't  know who
needs to be checked."
    "I guess." Jason said glumly. "You want something to drink?"
    "Yeah."  said  Robert.  "My  mom'll  kill  me.  She'll  say,  'Why
couldn't  you  be thirsty  at  our  house?  Don't  you think  we  have
requirements to  meet, too ?' I  know she will. I  don't care, though.
What's a little lemonade between friends?"
    Jason opened the  front door. "You know where  everything is. I'll
be right  there. Pour  me one too,  okay?" He went  down the  hall and
into his  room. He  heard Robert  pouring as he  found his  camera and
grabbed a satchel.
    "Jason?"  came his  mother's  voice from  somewhere upstairs.  "Is
that you?"
    "Yes, mom."  he answered,  moving back into  the kitchen.  "Me and
Robert are gonna go take pictures."
    "Oh. Okay. Bring me back some beauties."
    "I will, mom."  Jason crossed the kitchen to the  cabinet the film
was stored  in. He scooped a  dozen rolls into the  satchel and turned
to face Robert . "Ready?" he asked.
    "When you are." Robert replied, and held out a glass of lemonade.
    "Oh,  yeah."  said  Jason.  He  took  the  glass  and  downed  the
contents  in three  long gulps.  The two  of them  left the  house and
headed down the street.
    "Where do you want to go?" Jason asked.
    "I was thinking we could go down to the river. Near the falls."
    "Okay by me."
    They  followed the  road  for a  while, then  cut  across an  open
field. Robert  took occasional shots of  the houses, the sun,  and the
sky.  Jason  loaded  his  camera, but  didn't  take  pictures.  Robert
appeared  not  to notice,  absorbed  in  his surroundings.  The  field
ended in a  long downslope, with the river at  the bottom. They picked
their way  carefully until they  stood on the sandy,  relatively level
bank. Robert began to walk upstream, and Jason followed.
    "You know what I'd like to be?" Robert asked after a while.
    "No, Robert," Jason asked, amused, "what would you like to be?"
    "A Shrink." Robert answered.
    "You're crazy."
    Robert  laughed.  "That's  a  good  one."  he  replied.  "A  crazy
Shrink. That's  a good one." he  repeated. "No, but really,"  he said,
sobering, "I  think I would.  When testing-time comes around  again, I
think I'm going to tell them that."
    "Come  on,  Robert." Jason  said.  "Almost  nobody makes  it.  And
nobody  knows  why the  ones  who  do get  picked.  'The  ways of  the
Shrinks are downright strange.'" he said, quoting an old proverb.
    "Still," Robert insisted, "I can always try."
    The  sound  of  the  waterfall was  getting  louder.  Jason  began
taking pictures  of the trees  and rocks. They  rounded a bend  in the
river and he  could see the waterfall, throwing  broken reflections of
light  at  him,  all  red  and green  and  blue.  Jason  began  taking
pictures in earnest.
    So absorbed  was he in getting  a close-up of the  rushing waters,
Jason failed to  notice the man sitting behind the  waterfall until he
stood up.  He was small,  only a couple  of inches taller  than Jason,
and  dressed  in  tattered,  threadbare  garments.  Despite  this,  he
possessed  a calm  dignity  that held  Jason  semi-hypnotized for  the
first few seconds.
    "Robert." he said, softly. "Rogue."
    Robert  turned. His  eyes  grew wide  and his  mouth  formed an  O
shape.  Suddenly, his  mouth snapped  shut and  he began  to run  back
downstream. "Wait." called  the man, but Robert kept  running. Soon he
was out of sight.
    Jason   stood   paralyzed.  He   had   heard   about  rogues,   of
course--everyone was supposed  to be on the lookout for  them and know
what  to do  in case  one was  spotted. But  he had  never figured  on
actually SEEING one.  Rogues were the dissidents, the  ones who didn't
believe in  the Shrinks or their  ideas. They ran away  from the crews
who  came  to  take  them  to attitude  training,  and  lived  in  the
wilderness. The  Shrinks said  that there weren't  very many  of them,
and Jason had believed it. Surprise was all that kept him from flight.
    Finally, after an eternity, Jason began to run.
    "Boy. Wait."  said the rogue,  and something, the calmness  in his
voice , maybe, but something made Jason hover, if only for an instant.
    "Hear me out." said  the rogue. "I have seen you.  I know that you
are  different--that you  do not  believe  the Shrinks  when they  say
that they must control  the way you act and the way  you think. I know
you  want to  live  life the  way  YOU want  to live  it,  not as  the
Shrinks would have  you. Come with me, Jason." He  became intense. His
eyes locked on  Jason's, and spoke silently of  forgotten freedoms. "I
will take you  to meet others like  you," he continued, "  but we must
hurry. Your friend  is already on his way to  bring the authorities. "
The rogue held  out his hand. "There  is a better way  than you know."
he finished.
    Jason  stared at  him  for  a few  moments,  unbelieving. Then  he
turned, and ran from the rogue faster than he'd ever run in his life.
    He was nearly to  his house when he heard the  sirens, and he knew
the  rogue would  get away.  It  was easy  to  hide in  the woods.  He
slowed down,  and saw Robert waiting  for him on the  steps leading to
his door.
    "God." said Robert. "I've never been so scared in my life."
    "Me too." Jason panted. "I don't much  feel like  taking  pictures
 anymore."
    "Neither do I." said Robert, and headed towards his house.
    Jason  was grilled  about the  event at  the dinner  table by  his
parents, and  again later  that evening  by the  police. He  told them
both the same thing.  "I got so scared I couldn't  move." he said. "He
started  talking  crazy,  and  I  ran  before  he  could  grab  me  or
somethin'."  Both his  parents and  the police  seemed satisfied.  The
sergeant who  interviewed him  said that they  didn't expect  to catch
the rogue,  that they were usually  experts at hiding, but  that there
was  little chance  he'd be  hanging around  this area,  either. Jason
was relieved.
    And the  next morning, the second day of the first wasting-time of
the sixth month, Jason ate everything on his plate and asked for more.

                                Tattoo's
    As  Kara  walked onto  the  bridge,  all  the crew's  eyes  turned
toward  her. She  looked disheveled,  with  burn marks  on her  ripped
clothing and  her face streaked  with ash. Her  hair was a  mess, full
of knots and singed spots.
    "What should I  expect", she thought, "I look like  I've been thru
hell and back. It was only a little revolution."
    Little  revolution.  Amazing  how  easy it  had  become  to  write
things like that  off. Only killed a few million  people, no big deal.
Slowly but surely,  these ties to the Fifth  Horsemen Mercenary Troops
were getting to her.
    "How do they  get me INTO things like that???"  she asked herself.
Yet  she knew  the  answer already.  It was  Cross.  Damian Cross.  As
usual,  he  had asked  her  for  help and  she  had  brought her  ship
running to his  aid. And he didn't  even need her this  time (altho he
got  some kind  of  joy out  of watching  her  fight like  that...just
sitting up in his HoverTank watching her lead her men.
    "Well, at  least they  respect me.",  she thought.  "Anyways, back
to work."
    "Navigator,  plot a  course to  Delta Mynas  II. Security,  report
status, both ship and crew."
    "Security  reporting Ma'am.  Ship security  tight and  unbreached.
Seems they can't get  off the planet down there. What  did you guys do
to them?"
    "Never mind,"  she said, snickering  a little about the  ease with
which they  had immobilized the  Space Port. The Horsemen  were famous
for such  great planning as that.  "I'll tell you all  about it later.
How about the crew?"
    "Well, as you know,  we lost 45 men down on planet,  and 3 more of
the  injured have  died since  we brought  them back  up here  to high
port. The rest  are expected to be  OK. That leaves us  with about 102
soldiers and the normal on board personal."
    "Damn. That's a lot  to loose. I'm going to my  cabin to clean up.
Send a  message to Cross  that he's invited to  dinner over here  in 2
hours. Let me know what he says."
    "Yes Ma'am."
    "Ma'am,"  the navigator  piped  up. What  a  weaselly little  man.
Maybe  I'll send  him on  combat duty  soon...see if  that strengthens
his character.
    "Yes, Johnson, what."
    "Ma'am, the course is plotted and laid in."
    "Good, we  won't be  leaving for  about 3  hours, so  double check
your   figures.  No   mistakes  allowed   this  time.   I  think   the
sharpshooters need  some moving target  practice." With a  snicker she
remembered the  time they had  ended up  at exactly a  180degree angle
from  where they  were headed  because he  reversed a  couple figures.
God what an idiot.  That got him his pay docked for  months to pay for
the  time lost  and the  job passed  on. This  time she  wasn't in  as
patient a mood.
    "Yes Ma'am." Johnson said with a cringe. She'd done it before.

    God was it nice to be alone.
    For  the first  time  in days,  she could  get  undressed, take  a
slow,  leisurely shower,  and not  be surrounded  by hot,  sweaty men.
The  way  they  all looked  at  her  was  enough  to drive  any  woman
bonkers.  Stepping out  of the  shower, in  front of  the full  length
mirror,  she acknowledge  that maybe  they had  a reason  to gawk  her
like that.  Maybe. Maybe  if she  were just some  normal bimbo  on the
street. But  she wasn't.  She was in  command of the  Iron Fox  III, a
name passed from  generation to generation of ship's  captains. One of
the finest  mercenary ships in  this part  of the galaxy,  second only
to the  Horsemen. The shouldn't gawk  her like some street  whore. She
was a  pretty  woman,  but  15  years of  leading  this group  through
uncounted  battles  have  left  their marks.  Scars  marred  the  once
beautiful face giving  her a very rough look. Lines  from worrying and
from fighting made  her look years older then she  was. Her figure was
as slim,  lithe and strong  as ever, but as  scarred as her  face. And
then there was the tattoo.
    The shape  of the Fifth  Horseman's symbol, small, dark,  shown on
the side  of her  hip. The sign  of a female  possession of  theirs. A
permanent mark for all the world to see.
    She  had been  found on  a  devastated planet,  her father's  ship
destroyed by an  attack of the Horseman.  She was 15 at  the time, and
some of  the horsemen  had decided  he wanted her  as their  pet. They
tattooed her,  and put her  to work  onboard their ship,  serving food
and sleeping her  way up thru the  command ranks in an  attempt to get
out. When she  met Damian, he saw  some potential in her.  He gave her
the chance to  learn ships operations and mercenary  actions. Soon she
was  a strong  commander  and  an even  stronger  soldier,  so when  a
derelict  (but still  flying)  ship was  found,  Damian convinced  the
other leaders  to let her  have it.  (A simple feat,  considering that
they had been  watching her to make sure she  didn't organize a revolt
among the  servants for quite  some time.)  From there she'd  made her
own way.  Getting the ship  fixed up,  getting a crew,  and eventually
getting some  soldiers together  took the  better part  of the  next 6
years.  But  she  did  it. Alone.  Never,  however,  forgetting  about
Damian. he'd  given her the  chance. And he  called that one  in every
time he could.
    "Stop  daydreaming and  get dressed!"  Kara said  out loud,  as if
saying it out  loud would change the fact that  she was still somewhat
lost in her own thoughts.
    The  battles of  the past  few days  was still  very fresh  in her
mind. She and  her men had merely been extra  numbers, not needed, but
it  looked good.  The  Horsemen rarely  NEEDED the  help.  They had  a
beautifully  laid  and executed  plan.  The  world involved,  Altilles
Planet,  had  a  dependence  on outside  fuel  sources.  The  Horsemen
merely ran  them dry, let  a shipment get thru,  and then blew  up the
ground side space  port with all the  fuel in it. Made  a rather large
crater  of the  capital  city,  killed most  of  the major  government
figures  (as  was  their  contract with  the  neighboring  planet  who
wanted  the  agricultural land  there)  and  left  the path  open  for
takeovers. Of  course, they  took more  then their  share of  loot off
the  place. They  always do.  But then  again we  did too.  That's the
mercenary way.
    After  three  days of  cleaning  up  the  last of  the  straggling
government  and   sending  them  all   to  their  makers   (in  rather
imaginative ways),  it's time  to move  on. And  count the  loses. One
third  of my  mercs  on a  battle  that we  weren't  even needed  for.
Damian had better clear this debt now. They would be hard to replace.

    Half an  hour later,  dressed in her  normal black  jumpsuit, with
her long wavy red hair down for once, Kara was back on the bridge.
    "Cross  will  be  arriving  in 15  minutes  Ma'am.  Everything  is
prepared for your dinner in the Main Conference Room."
    "Thank  you,  Stevens. I'm  headed  down  there now.  If  anything
should happen while I'm there, buzz me."
    "Oh, and  Johnson, tell Port  Control that  we will be  leaving in
exactly 2 hours. Get the clearance."
    "Yes Ma'am.",  Johnson said, as she  turned and walked out  of the
room. Breathing a sigh of relief, he turned back to his calculations.

    When Damian  walked in the room,  she was standing facing  out the
port hole,  not really at anything,  but just out. Away  from him. She
knew  what  would happen  when  she  turned  around.  He would  be  in
control.  The only  man that  had ever been  able to control her.  She
wasn't even sure if she resented that fact or not.
    "Evening. You  wanted to see me?",  Damian said, as he  walked in,
poured himself a drink, and sat down at the head of the table.
    "Yes.", she  said, turning  around to  face him  where he  sat. "I
seem to  have lost  a lot of  men in  the past few  days over  a silly
squabble that  you didn't  even really  need me for.  Now why  did you
really bring me here?"
    "If I  said because  I wanted  to get  laid would  you get  mad at
me?", he asked, with a smile so sarcastic, it was almost painful.
    "Yes, I would. I  do have jobs of my own you  realize. I hope this
absolves  any debt  you  feel I  still  owe you.  You've  been paid  a
million times over for it."
    "That tattoo  you bare  on your hip  tells me when  you owe  me no
more. As  long as  it's still  there, you still  owe me."  Putting his
feet  up on  the table,  he picked  up his  plate and  started eating,
completely ignoring her.
    Furious, she  turned away from  him and  stared out the  port hole
again until  she was calm  enough to talk  again. "Damian, me, you may
feel you own. The  battered hull of this ship you own.  But I lost 1/3
of my crew  down there and you do  NOT own them. Now I  need some kind
of recompense for this. Otherwise next time I won't come."
    "You haven't  checked your  bank account  recently. Money  for the
men you lost  is in there. And as  far as you go, dear, I  do own you.
Don't you  ever forget that  fact. In the  meantime, I just  wanted to
let you  know that  I won't be  needing your help  for a  while. We're
taking some  time off and  you need to train  some new men.  I'll call
when I  need you. Have  a nice  day." Out of  his mouth, "have  a nice
day" sounded like a string of obscenities.
    He got up  to leave, but as  he reached the door,  he looked back.
Walking across  the room to  where Kara  was standing, he  grabbed her
and gave her  a rather rough, but passionate kiss.  Then he turned and
walked out. Again.
    After  eating, she  headed  back up  to the  bridge,  all the  way
saying to  herself "Damn, he  did it to me  again." But that's  how it
always went, and  altho it put her in  a foul humor for a  day or two,
it never changed.
    Arriving on the bridge, she did the only thing possible.
    "Johnson, get us out of here now. And you'd better get it right!"

    Later  that night,  after  safely getting  underway  on the  right
course, Kara  wandered back to  her room. She wasn't  furious anymore,
just in that  state of mind where  nobody wanted to cross  her. It was
written all  over her  face. Needless  to say, most  of the  crew gave
her a wide berth as she walked down the hall.
    Arriving back in  her quarters, she was surprised to  see a bit of
a  glow  coming from  around  the  corner,  her bedroom.  Drawing  her
Neural Paralyzer,  she quietly  moved up to  the corner.  "Nice little
weapon" she  thought, as she  set it on  one of it's  lesser settings.
These weapons had  been known to cause insanity, or  at the very least
extreme pain  to those hit by  it. Perfect for anyone  sneaking around
in the Captain's  quarters. She swung around the  corner, weapon going
first, ready to fire.
    "So, what took  you so long?", Damian said,  apparently unfazed by
the fact that she had a weapon in hand.
    "Damnit,  what are  you doing  here????? I  thought you'd  crawled
back in  your hole by  now." He was  sitting, well actually  lying, on
her bed  with her favorite  wine on the table  next to it  and candles
glowing in the candle globes she  kept scattered  around the  room for
relaxation.
    "I told  you. We're  taking a  vacation. So put  the gun  down and
come over here. I've already poured you some wine."
    "Damn."  she  thought, as  she  put  the  weapon down  and  walked
across the room to him.  Here we go again.

                          Worthy of the Title
    "You might  as well go out  and see the festival,  now that you're
here,"  Lord  Clifton  Dargon  had   suggested  as  his  twin  cousins
finished breakfast. "Melrin only comes once a year."
    "Yes," Luthias  had agreed practically,  but his voice  was heavy.
"We might as well."
    "What's going on  today in the Melrin, Bartol?"  Roisart asked his
cousin Dargon's bard.
    "Oh,  final  competition  for  the Bardic  Crown,"  the  bard  cum
bodyguard announced enthusiastically. "Today at noontime."
    "What else?"  Luthias wondered. While bardic  tales could interest
Luthias, hours upon hours of sung tales drove him to distraction.
    Bartol gave  him a strange,  appalled look. "What  else?" demanded
Bartol, gazing  at the young  noble as if  he were insane.  "What else
is there?"
    Roisart looked  at his twin  and smiled. Luthias rolled  his eyes.
Then  he turned  to  his  cousin, the  lord.  "Clifton,  do you  think
you'll be all right here after what happened to our father yesterday?"
    Clifton  had laughed  then;  Roisart smiled.  "Come on,  Luthias,"
his brother urged.  "Think about it. What would Clifton,  with all his
guards,  need  us  for?  Considering  the men  who  attacked  us  this
morning,"  Roisart continued,  turning his  eyes towards  his cousins,
"we may need guarding ourselves."
    But  Clifton had  smiled  and  shaken his  head.  "You'll be  safe
enough in  the festival," the Lord  of Dargon ventured. "And  the city
guard is out  in full should you need assistance."  The smiled widened
and the skin  around Dargon's brown eyes  crinkled slightly. "Besides,
you two didn't do all that badly this morning."
    So  it  was with  this  assurance  the  Roisart and  Luthias  left
Dargon  Keep and  strolled into  the Middle  City, where  most of  the
Melrin  was taking  place. There  were as  yet three  hours until  the
Bardic Crown  competition was to  take place, so Luthias  suggested to
his  brother,  "Let's go  down  to  the  docks.  There's bound  to  be
something happening there."
    "Yes,  Father used  to take  us there  when we  got to  the Melrin
early," Roisart sighed.  Luthias frowned; he too  missed their father.
Then Roisart brightened a bit. "Maybe the races are today."
    The noble  twins walked  a little more  quickly toward  the docks,
past the  side shows  and food  stands that were  just setting  up for
the fourth day  of Melrin. Roisart noted curiosities along  the way: a
bearded lady, a steer  the size of a small house,  a fortune teller or
two, a  seller of rare books...many  things that he and  Luthias would
have to see. It  would have been easier if their  father had been with
them; the  late Baron was much  like Roisart in his  zest for oddities
and stories. Luthias  was not as interested such things,  for which he
could find no  real use. Then Roisart spotted the  booth of an armoire
come  all the  way from  Magnus for  Melrin, and  decided it  would be
easier than he had anticipated to drag Luthias back.
    They  arrived  at  the  docks   very  early,  so  the  docks  were
deserted, except  for old  Simon, the  Stew Man,  and his  monkey, who
chattered  at the  twins in  a primate  greeting. Luthias  played with
the jovial  creature, and  Roisart began  eagerly to  ask the  old man
about a sea  legend he had recently  read and whether or  not it could
have any truth to  it. Finally, as the crowds began  to press onto the
docks,  Luthias slipped  the  monkey a  sovereign  and pulled  Roisart
away to find a good view for the race.
    It was  a spectacular race,  with Captain Kent's  "Victory Chimes"
taking the  honors at  the end.  When it  was over  and the  crowd was
thinning, Roisart  told his  brother, "I  saw some  interesting booths
over by the market. Let's go look them over."
    Luthias shrugged  his shoulders  and together  they left  the dock
areas for the  Middle City, near the market. As  Roisart had expected,
Luthias  was not  particularly interested  in the  side shows,  but he
became very  enthusiastic when he  saw the  display of the  best sword
maker  of Dargon.  While Luthias  inspected the  blades, Roisart  paid
two coppers to  see the steer as big  as a house and played  a game of
toss, though he  won no prizes. Still, Roisart made  sure at all times
that he knew exactly where his brother was.
    Luthias watched Roisart  as well, saw him duck into  the tent with
the exaggerated  steer. "I'll  take this  one," he  said to  the sword
maker, choosing  the best blade  of the lot,  but keeping his  eyes on
the tent. "And  a scabbard, too." Roisart emerged  from the attraction
and moved  over to  his brother. "Look,  Roisart," Luthias  bragged as
he paid for his new toy, "see this!"
    The  pride was  well-founded; the  sword  was very  well made  and
decorated. "You going to fight with that?" Roisart laughed.
    "That's what swords are for," Luthias said, a gleam in his eye.
    "But that's  too nice  to fight  with," Roisart  argued. "Besides,
in a pinch, you're used to your old blade."
    Luthias grimaced. "We  had better stick together,  twin. I thought
I saw someone following us on the docks."
    "You worry  too much," Roisart  chided his brother  lightly. "Come
over here, Luthias.  Let's take a look at this  scribe's cart. Did you
see the books?"
    Luthias took  his sword from its  maker and nodded. "I  saw them,"
Luthias confirmed as they crossed the street. "Very old."
    Roisart  arrived  at  the  cart and  immediately  began  rummaging
through the titles. "These aren't so old, Luthias."
    "I meant  the scribe," joked  his brother, picking up  a red-bound
volume inscribed  with blue. He opened  it, looked at the  title page,
then called over the scribe. "How much is this?"
    "Do you have 'History of the Ancient World'?" Roisart wondered.
    The scribe shook  his head. "I'm sorry, young sir.  And you, young
sir...." He  looked from  Roisart to Luthias,  then back  again. Then,
to  Luthias,  he gave  the  price  of  the  book, which  Luthias  paid
laconically and turned away to flip through it as Roisart browsed.
    After  a  minute,  Roisart  peered over  his  brother's  shoulder.
"What's that you've bought?"
    "Meresan's  'Lives  of  Lords  and Princes',"  Luthias  told  him.
"We're going to need the examples if one of us is going to be baron."
    Roisart sighed. "If we can ever decide who is to be baron."
    Luthias  looked  into  his  brother's brown  eyes.  "I  think  you
should be baron."
    "What?"  laughed Roisart.  "But I'm  not much  of a  leader, or  a
fighter. Men  would follow  you, Luthias. In  an emergency,  you think
fast and act."
    "But that would be  deadly to me if I were  judging a legal case,"
Luthias  replied, closing  the book  with  a decided  thump. "I  would
think too  quickly. You'd delve  into the  matter until the  truth was
found. I  might take  the truth  at the surface.  And what  about law,
Roisart? I know nothing of laws."
    "If only we could both be baron," sighed Roisart dismally.
    "I  know that  that is  against  the law,"  Luthias chuckled.  "We
can't both be baron."
    "I know,  but we both have  qualities that are so  necessary to be
one," Roisart  replied. "And it's hard  to tell which one  of us would
better serve Clifton."
    "Clifton,"  muttered  Luthias, beginning  to  move  away from  the
scribe's cart. "Now, about him I am very worried."
    "You  worry too  much,"  Roisart laughed.  Then  he sobered.  "But
something's got to be done. Clifton can't let this continue."
    "There's  nothing we  can do  about it,  though," Luthias  pointed
out. "We'll just have to decide which of us should be baron."
    There was  a moment of  silence, then Roisart  announced suddenly,
"Luthias, I'm hungry."
    Luthias smiled.  "So am I.  I think there's  a tavern on  the next
street over. It's been a long time since breakfast."
    "I hope  it's a good tavern,"  Roisart said. "I don't  want to get
sick before the ball tomorrow."
    Slowly,  the  twins made  their  way  through  the crowds  to  the
nearby  street. The  tavern  which Luthias  had  earlier spotted,  the
Rogue and  Quiver, was  full, and  seemed rather  dirty. So  they kept
walking  and  searching, until  Roisart  spotted  a large  sign  which
advertised, "Belisandra's."
    Luthias  gave the  place a  cursory inspection.  "It looks  clean,
and the food smells good. Let's eat."
    Together, the twins  ducked into the darkened  tavern, scanned the
room and  its patrons (neither seemed  too bad), and found  a table in
the corner nearest  the door. Luthias pointed it out,  and motioned to
his  brother. Roisart  nodded,  knowing the  location's advantages  as
well  as Luthias  did;  it  allowed no  attack  from  behind, and  the
proximity  to  the  door  made  the  twins  difficult  to  spot  as  a
potential killer's eyes adjusted to the semi-darkness.
    A  sharp-eyed  serving  wench  had  spotted  the  brothers  almost
immediately  and   hustled  over  to   their  table  as   they  seated
themselves.  She   was  a  small   girl,  only  reaching   the  twins'
shoulders, but  she dressed  neatly and wore  a pleasant  smile. "Good
Melrin to  you, sirs,"  she greeted  the twins  politely. "What  may I
serve you?"
    Roisart began  to smile in  a lazy  way which triggered  alarms in
Luthias'  brain.  Roisart was  having  an  infatuation again.  Luthias
sighed  mentally.  Well, at  least  the  girl  wasn't a  peasant;  her
speech was  clear and  free of  the peasant accent,  and she  wore her
clothes  like a  decent woman,  unlike  another serving  wench on  the
other side  of the room.  Still....Luthias nudged his  brother beneath
the table  and spoke.  "Two ales,  to begin  with. What's  the special
for luncheon?"
    The girl's  smile spread. "Belisandra's Secret  Stew. The recipe's
older than  the Keep. It's  the best stew  in Dargon. And  it's fresh;
Belisandra   made   it   just   this   morning."   The   girl   nodded
enthusiastically  to  a buxom  woman  nearing  middle age,  who  stood
behind the  bar, tending it  and a large  cauldron of stew  behind it.
"It comes with fresh  bread and butter and greens, and  I can bring it
to you right away."
    "Perfect," Luthias' stomach answered. "Bring two of those please."
    The  girl nodded  and turned  away with  a natural,  unflirtateous
bounce. "Too  young for  you, Roisart,"  muttered Luthias.  "She can't
be more than fourteen."
    "She's very sweet," Roisart argued.
    "Yes, but  she's not  for you."  Roisart sighed  with resignation;
his brother smiled affectionately. "You give your heart too easily."
    "Whoever is baron could choose his own woman," Roisart realized.
    "If only  we could choose  a baron,"  Luthias laughed as  the girl
returned with two bowls  of stew, a plate of fresh bread  and a pat of
butter,  and a  bowl  of greens.  Wondering how  she  could carry  all
that,  Luthias  continued,  "There's   absolutely  no  way  to  choose
between us."
    The girl  was setting  the dishes down.  "Belisandra will  be over
with the  ales in a  minute," she promised.  She leaned back  a moment
and  surveyed the  young  brothers with  an  appraising look.  "Choose
between  you? How  could any  girl  choose between  you?" She  blushed
then, perhaps feeling  immodest. Both twins, blushing  as well, smiled
at her as she continued. "Maybe your lucky lady should see Corambis."
    The  tavern  mistress  Belisandra,  bearing two  ales,  came  from
behind the girl as Luthias asked, "Who is Corambis?"
    "You don't know  Corambis?" the girl asked, her eyes  now wide. "I
thought everyone  knew Corambis.  He's the  Sage in  the market-place.
Your lady should see him today to see which of you she should choose."
    Belisandra set the  ales down with two distinctive  thumps. "Go to
him  today? Mika,  he  may never  come  back!" She  gave  the twins  a
motherly gaze. "He's been gone all winter, without a trace, and--"
    "He got  back yesterday,"  Mika protested.  "He read  my horoscope
for me this morning, Belisandra."
    She  turned  again  to  the  twins, and  began  to  continue,  but
Belisandra interrupted. "Where was he this time?"
    Mika took  a moment to recall  the information. "He went  off with
a  young man  for  a few  days,  then stayed  with  relatives for  the
winter, he  said. But he  is back,"  she assured Roisart  and Luthias,
"and you  can go and  make an appointment  for your lady  friend. He's
right in the market."
    Luthias faced his brother. "Do you think we should?"
    Roisart  shrugged.  "Why  not,  Luthias?  We've  tried  everything
else." He then asked Mika and her lady, "Where can we find Corambis?"
    "Oh,  he's   easy  to   find,  my  lords,"   Belisandra  explained
helpfully. "It's the  only closed booth in the main  market place. You
can't miss it, young sirs."
    "I'll think we'll try it," Luthias decided. "Thank you."
    Mika  smiled  engagingly;   Belisandra  nodded,  pleased.  "You're
welcome, my lords," Belisandra answered. "Good Melrin."
    "Good Melrin," Roisart returned politely.
    Belisandra went  back to her bar  and her stew and  left Mika with
the twins.  "Enjoy your meal," the  girl said pleasantly. "Call  me if
you'd like anything else, milords."
    Luthias  nodded  and smiled  at  her,  and  then Mika  also  left.
Luthias  turned to  his stew  and greens  and began  to eat  hungrily.
Then he  laughed, his mouth  full. Aware  of his manners,  he stopped,
swallowed, then said,  "I can't  believe  I'm  actually going to see a
fortune-teller!"
    "Why not?"  Roisart answered,  stirring his hot  stew to  cool it.
"Didn't she say he was a Sage? Sages are very wise men, Luthias."
    Still Luthias shook his head. "Leaving a barony to a horoscope..."
    Roisart laughed. "Be  practical, twin, just as you  always tell me
to be. We're going  for advice, not for a decision.  That will have to
be made by you and me."
    For a  moment, Luthias  was quiet.  Then he said  in a  low voice,
"We should be  more careful what we say in  public, Roisart. The girl,
Mika,  didn't  guess  what  we  really  meant,  but  if  someone  were
searching for us..."
    "It wouldn't  be that hard,"  Roisart countered. "I'd bet  that we
were the only twins in mourning blue in a festival city."
    Luthias attacked  the greens. "Still,  we don't need the  whole of
Dargon knowing about us and about...our cousin's troubles."
    Roisart swallowed and  nodded. "Agreed. But we should  go see this
Corambis. We need all the help we can get."
    "It certainly couldn't hurt," Luthias concurred.

    About   mid-afternoon,   Luthias   and  Roisart   finished   their
leisurely  meal, and  after paying  Belisandra and  generously tipping
the  girl Mika,  they made  their  way to  the main  market square  in
search  of Corambis  the Sage.  As Mika  predicted, his  stall in  the
market place,  the only one  that was  closed in completely,  was easy
to find.  Luckily for the twins,  the people of Dargon,  accustomed to
Corambis,  were   exploiting  other  fortune  tellers   today.  A  bit
self-consciously, Luthias knocked  on the door, and  the nervous twins
were  admitted  into   the  booth  by  a  young   woman  whom  Roisart
recognized as  being one of  the serving wenches at  Belisandra's. She
smiled  at the  twins provocatively,  and in  a sugary  voice informed
them that  Corambis was with another  querent, but would be  free very
soon.  Both  twins  nodded  soberly at  this  information  and  seated
themselves gingerly on a wooden bench.
    After a  minute, a middle-aged man  dressed in a gay  shade of red
came  through the  door directly  opposite  the twins.  A young  woman
followed him,  apparently in tears. She  slipped the man a  gold piece
and then  slipped out the door.  The man then turned  his attention to
the twins. "Who  are these men, Thuna?" he asked  the girl, giving her
a stern, suspicious look.
    The wench Thuna shrugged coyly. "They've come for you, Corambis."
    The  Sage  looked  visibly  relieved.  "Come  in,  gentlemen,"  he
invited,  motioning  toward the  plain,  still-open  door. In  unison,
Roisart and Luthias rose and walked toward the room.
    The  cubicle was  dark,  despite the  afternoon daylight  outside,
and  from   what  the  twins   could  tell,  somewhat   bare.  Candles
illuminated  a small,  circular table.  Roisart recognized  it as  the
Wheel  of Life,  a divination  device.  After a  moment, Luthias  also
recalled  the Wheel.  Roisart noticed  two chairs  in opposing  points
around the table.  He indicated it to Luthias, who  shook his head, so
Roisart sat down.
    After  a few  quick words  of instruction  to Thuna,  Corambis the
Sage  joined them.  "I  apologize  about Thuna,"  the  Sage began.  "I
thought that perhaps  she had fallen into old habits  again." The Sage
looked at  Luthias, who was still  standing. "I'm sorry, sir.  I don't
have another chair."
    "It's all  right," Luthias  assured him. "Don't  trouble yourself.
I don't mind standing."
    "All  right," the  Sage agreed.  He  looked at  Roisart then,  and
again at Luthias. "How may I help you, gentlemen?"
    "We would have you tell our horoscope," Roisart answered quickly.
    Corambis  at  once appeared  surprised  and  flattered. "It's  not
often men  of nobility come to  me," he chuckled, beginning  to smile.
"They don't often trust their problems to strangers."
    "This is an exceptional problem," Luthias revealed.
    "You  may  confide  in  me,  my  lords,"  Corambis  declared  with
dignity. "I will not reveal your secrets. Why have you come to me?"
    Roisart smiled. "I suppose we had no where left to go."
    Corambis' eyebrows raised. "Sir?"
    "My  brother and  I," began  Luthias, "have  come to  you with  an
unusual problem,  sir. When we were  born, our mother died,  and so no
one noted which was the elder."
    "And   your   father   has    just   perished?"   Corambis   asked
sympathetically, gazing at  the blue-grey mourning dress.  "I see. You
have no idea  which of you is heir." Roisart  and Luthias both nodded.
"My lords, have you brought your case before Lord Dargon?"
    Roisart and  Luthias looked each  other in  the eye a  moment, and
Luthias  had his  doubts. But  Roisart trusted  the Sage,  and Luthias
gave his  consent, so Roisart  revealed the entire story  to Corambis.
To  the  twins'  astonishment,  the  Sage was  not  surprised  by  the
information.  "I have  been seeing  that in  the stars  lately," mused
Corambis.  He sighed,  then  looked at  Roisart,  sitting across  from
him, and then  at Luthias. "Well, my  lords, I shall do what  I can to
help you."
    The Sage  rose and turned  to a  little cubby-hole in  the corner.
>From it,  he withdrew a  small, velvet bag.  He opened it,  rummaged a
moment,  then  turned back  to  the  cubby-hole.  He reached  into  it
again, and tossed something across the room to Luthias.
    Luthias caught the  thing deftly, then opened his  hand to examine
the object. It was a small red chip.
    Corambis seated himself  once more. With one hand,  he offered the
velvet  bag, and  another  red chip  to Roisart.  With  the other,  he
beckoned Luthias  closer. "It  isn't often I  do readings  for twins,"
he mused, "but  I often read for couples. Lord  Roisart, take half the
chips, and do not look at them. Give the rest to your brother."
    "What's the red chip for?" Luthias asked.
    "Put  that on  your  birth sign,  the  Oak," Corambis  instructed.
"You too, Lord  Roisart." The twins obeyed. Roisart took  a handful of
chips, and  gave the rest to  Luthias. Corambis spun the  wheel. "Drop
them when you are ready."
    Without any  outward signal, the twins  simultaneously dropped the
blue  chips  onto the  whirling  Wheel  of  Life.  It spun  and  spun;
Luthias knelt  next to  the table  to see better.  The Wheel  spun and
spun  and  spun.  Roisart  put  a  hand  on  his  brother's  shoulder.
Corambis stared at the whirling Wheel. The Wheel stopped.
    Corambis  stared at  the Wheel,  with its  scattered chips  of red
and blue,  for a  moment. "Unusual,"  he said.  "Look here,  my lords.
The  two birth  chips have  separated. One  has stayed  on the  Oak, a
sign of  strength and long  life. The other  has strayed to  the Ship,
as if he were going to make a journey away from the other."
    "What's that blue one on the Ship?" Roisart asked, fascinated.
    Corambis scrutinized the  symbol. "A new ally, come  from afar, it
seems." He  gazed at the other  chips. "You will need  him, along with
this ally--"  Corambis pointed  to a chip  straddling the  elements of
Fire and  Sword. "--to combat  these two. Two very  dangerous enemies,
one caught  between deceit  and caring...probably  a woman,"  he mused
to himself.  "And another, on the  sign of the Fox--"  Again, Corambis
pointed. "He is a dangerous, cunning man, and I would be wary of him.
    "The  outcome..."  Corambis  looked  at the  chips.  "It  will  be
decided soon,  my lords.  There are  chips in the  present and  in the
near future."
    "But which one of us?" demanded Luthias.
    The Sage shrugged  his shoulders slightly. "I know  not, my lords.
But I  can tell you  this," he promised, pointing  to the sign  of the
Knight, which  held two chips,  "the decision will  be made by  an act
of extreme valor."
    Luthias looked  up at his  twin. "I  should have known  that there
would be no easy answer, my brother," sighed Luthias.
    "So should I," smiled Roisart.
    Corambis  shrugged  pleasantly. "I  can  assure  you of  this,  my
young lords.  The sign of the  outcome is on the  Mistweaver. Whatever
happens in your case will be a fufillment of destiny."
    "Do you mean that the elder will gain the barony?" Roisart asked.
    "The  Wheel is  not specific,"  sighed Corambis.  "It is  never as
specific as  I would  like. As you  said, my lord,  there are  no easy
answers in the affairs of destiny." The Sage smiled.
    Both twins  returned the smile  with crooked, somewhat  sad grins.
Luthias  rose,  and Roisart  rose  with  him. "Thank  you,  Corambis,"
Roisart said respectfully. "We appreciate your time."
    "How much do we owe you, sir?" Luthias inquired.
    "Nothing," said  Corambis amiably. "It  isn't often I get  to tell
the future of the Baron of Connall and the Lord of Dargon."
    "Please," Roisart  insisted, "let us  give you something  for your
trouble. You lost other Festival customers by telling our fortune."
    "Doubtless  there are  other  fortune tellers  in  Dargon for  the
festival," Corambis smirked. "No, my lords, you need not pay me."
    "But we want to," Luthias said, with the tone of a demand.
    Corambis rolled  his eyes. "Oh,  all right," he  conceded. Luthias
gave him  two sovereigns. Corambis looked  at the coins, then  back at
the  twins. "I  suppose you  won't  let me  put  up a  fuss about  the
amount,  my  lords?" Luthias  gave  him  a wild,  wicked,  challenging
grin.  "I didn't  think so."  Corambis sighed.  "Well, good  Melrin to
you, lords, and be careful."
    "Good  Melrin,"  echoed  Roisart,  and  Luthias  nodded  a  silent
farewell as they  stepped out the door. A little  old lady rushed past
them to see Corambis. They heard a hysterical weeping as he door shut.
    "Poor woman,"  said Roisart  sympathetically. Luthias took  a deep
breath. The twins  crossed the room and left  Corambis' booth. Roisart
looked at his brother. "Well, twin, what do you think?"
    Luthias shrugged  his large shoulders elaborately.  "What should I
think, Roisart?"
    "I think you'll be the next baron," Roisart announced flatly.
    "Me?  Why me?"  wondered Luthias.  "Haven't we  already spoken  of
this, Roisart?"
    "The Sage  said it would be  decided by an act  of valor," Roisart
reminded  his  brother.  "You  excel in  matters  of  bravery,  twin,"
Roisart praised with a confident, affectionate smile.
    Luthias'  faced  echoed  the  smile falsely;  Luthias'  smile  was
introverted,  private, but  it retained  the happiness  shared by  his
brother. "Roisart," Luthias told him, "there are many sorts of valor."
    The  two wandered  in  silence  for a  few  moments, then  Roisart
wondered, "What shall we do now, Luthias?"
    Luthias gazed up  at the sky. The sun was  just above the horizon.
Funny, but  it didn't  seem as if  it should be  that late.  Lunch and
finding Corambis must  have taken longer than he  thought. The reading
was certainly quick.
    Due  to the  setting sun,  people were  clearing the  streets. The
merchants were  closing and barring  their shops and booths;  the side
show people  were packing their  equipment. Tomorrow was the  last day
of Melrin and the  best day for business. One could  not take a chance
on one's  equipment being  stolen in  the twilight.  Luthias grimaced.
If humble merchants took that much care....
    "Roisart,  perhaps we'd  best go  back to  our cousin's,"  Luthias
suggested, carefully  omitting their cousin's noble  name. "After what
happened this morning..."
    Roisart appeared  disappointed (he had  heard that there  would be
firework s  that evening),  but then thought  about the  situation. "I
agree, my brother. Let's go home."
    The twins were  a little over a  mile and a half from  the keep, a
nice  leisurely walk  in the  twilight.  Roisart did  a little  mental
calculation and figured  that he and his twin brother  would arrive at
Dargon  Keep about  the time  of  the sunset.  Perfect, just  perfect.
Roisart  again thought  about  that morning's  escapade  and began  to
feel apprehensive.  These murderers  after Clifton, he  thought, don't
even wait  until after  the dark.  Just a  deserted place.  They don't
mind the twilight.
    Another thing  occurred to  Roisart. He  was unarmed.  Luthias had
bought  the fine,  new  sword  at the  bazaar,  but  he, Roisart,  had
brought  no weapon.  Only  the city  guard was  allowed  to wear  arms
during the festival,  a mandate Clifton had issued  for public safety.
Luthias,  therefore,  carried his  new  sword,  snug in  its  fabulous
scabbard, in his hand, and by the blade.
    That morning, the two of them had ridden prepared. But now...
    Apparently,  Luthias had  shared his  brother's thoughts.  Luthias
gazed  at  the  covered  sword,  and at  his  brother's  hands,  which
carried only the book Luthias had purchased. "Let's hurry, twin."
    "You worry too much," Roisart said automatically.
    "I don't want to lose you, Roisart," Luthias answered, sotto voce.
    Yes, Luthias worried  too much. After all, what  assassin would be
stupid enough to try the same trick twice in the same day?
    Still,  Roisart gave  his twin  a watery  smile, then  gripped the
book tighter  as the pair  quickened their pace slightly.  The streets
were  becoming deserted.  Luthias  took  a step  closer  to his  twin.
Roisart  noticed that  the knuckles  of the  hand clutching  the sword
has paled. Grim, Roisart quickened the pace again.
    It was getting dark quickly.
    Roisart looked  at the setting  sun, red  and round, like  a ripe,
round apple, then at his brother's face, bathed in red light.
    Something moved behind Luthias.
    "Roisart, fall!" cried Luthias suddenly.
    Instinctively  reverting   to  the   fighting  lessons   they  had
received under  their father's  auspices, Roisart trusted  his brother
and  collapsed carefully  onto  the  ground. He  rolled  to the  side,
looked up.  Luthias swung at  a thief, bearing a  knife in one  hand a
rope in  the other, and  bloodied the man's nose  with a sweep  of the
sword. The  one behind Luthias, whom  Roisart had seen move,  moved to
strike, but  Roisart pulled his  brother's leg, tripping  him. Luthias
stumbled, but was unhurt.
    Roisart  rose, put  his back  against Luthias',  and observed  the
numbers. Six. And  thieves again. Roisart wondered at one  of them; he
seemed  familiar,  but  the  light,  as  well  as  the  observer,  was
uncertain.  He  heard something  clatter  to  the ground  behind  him;
Luthias had unsheathed  his sword. Roisart cringed. Six to  two, and I
am unarmed.  He took a  good hold on the  book. Not a  peasant weapon,
the unexpected thought came, but certainly an odd one.
    Suddenly, there  was a  cry from  the shadows,  and four  more men
joined the scene.
    Luthias lunged  forward and  impaled a thief  in one  sure thrust.
Roisart leapt  toward one of  the attackers, and clubbed  him clumsily
with  Luthias'  new book.  The  thief  stumbled, more  surprised  than
hurt,  but he  shook  his head  and kept  coming.  Roisart kicked  him
soundly in  the groin,  and when  he fell, he  clubbed him  again with
"Lives of Lords and Princes."
    Roisart  lunged from  the knife  of  his attacker,  but the  thief
dodged  despite the  pain.  Roisart  fell to  the  ground, losing  his
breath. Some  strong arms roughly  grabbed him  and hauled him  to his
feet. "Master Roisart, are you all right?" Bartol's voice hissed.
    "Bartol!"  cried  Roisart. "Thank  God!"  Then,  in the  darkening
twilight, Roisart saw movement again. "Bartol, look out!"
    Deftly, the  bard turned to  defend himself. Roisart  crouched, to
try to  ward off any attackers  with hand-to-hand combat. He  left the
book in the dust; it was of no use to him in this situation.
    Six of them, six of us, Roisart thought. Fair odds.
    One of  the thieves  lay on  the road,  bleeding from  wounds from
Luthias' sword.  Another's head was  crushed on  one side from  a blow
from  one of  Bartol's  three  guards. But  one  of  Bartol's men  was
still,  the slit  in his  neck  allowing all  life to  gush from  him.
Roisart checked around. One, two, three--where is the fourth---?
    A crushing blow  to the neck gave Roisart his  answer. Behind him.
Dazed,  Roisart fell.  Far away,  he heard  Luthias' voice,  "Roisart!
ROISART!" Far  away, he  felt rough,  rough hands  tying his  arms and
feet  with  coarse,  chafing  ropes.  Not far  away,  he  saw  through
blurred eyes another  of Bartol's men fall. He saw  Luthias, trying to
fight off  three thieves.  The other,  probably the  one who  had tied
him, was  being defeated by Bartol  and the last of  his men. Bartol's
last  guard  fell, leaving  the  bard  alone. And  Luthias,  defending
himself against three thieves.
    Bartol  fell,  clutching  his  sword-arm.  The  thief  kicked  him
soundly, and ran to join his comrades, fighting Luthias.
    Luthias,  Roisart  tried to  cry  out.  His mouth  wouldn't  move.
Luthias! Bartol, help him.
    Bartol was bleeding. Roisart couldn't even see Luthias any more.
    There was a strange battle cry.
    Suddenly, a blue  and white clad stranger leapt into  the midst of
the four fighting  Luthias. One, he stabbed in the  back. Luthias made
a lucky thrust into  one of the others. The other  two backed off, but
did not  run. The  strange, a  short, young  man, Roisart  judged him,
swung  an odd  curved sword  above  his head  and charged  one of  the
thieves. Encouraged, Luthias  sprang at the other, who  was ready. The
thief stabbed at  Luthias, and Roisart heard his brother  cry out. The
stranger's opponent fell.
    The stranger  saw Luthias clutch  his side and quickly  went after
the thief. One slash  rid the thief of his arm.  Another robbed him of
his life.
    Roisart  regained  his  breath  and began  to  fidget.  The  ropes
irritated his  wrists, which had  been bound tightly. He  heard Bartol
moan. It was becoming difficult to see.
    "Are you all right?" asked the stranger in accented words.
    "It's not deep," Luthias said. "But my brother...Bartol..."
    Luthias  took a  few steps  toward  his brother  and knelt  beside
him. "Roisart?" he asked, tentatively touching his brother's forehead.
    "Untie me," Roisart demanded irritably.
    Luthias slit the bonds. "Are you all right?"
    Roisart  pushed on  the ground  and managed  to get  on his  feet.
"Yes, I'm all right. Bartol?"
    "A cut,"  the stranger answered.  He was binding it.  "A physician
should be able to repair it."
    Luthias  put his  hand  on  his brother's  arm  and together  they
joined  the bard  and the  stranger. "We  are indebted  to you,  sir,"
Luthias  said politely.  "We--my  brother, Bartol,  and I--would  have
died here without your help. Thank you."
    "Prease," said  the stranger,  "do not  make fuss  over it.  I saw
that the  thieves attacked you, and  like any honorable man,  I wished
to help."
    "How can we ever repay you?" Roisart asked.
    "Prease,"  the  stranger  begged,  "I  do  it  out  of  honor  and
decency. I need no reward."
    "At  least come  to sup  with the  masters and  their cousin,  the
Lord of Dargon," the bard urged. "We at least owe you that much, sir?"
    The stranger  took a step  back and  bowed. "I am  Ittosai Michiya
of Bichu."
    "I am  honored, Michiya-san,"  Roisart answered, bowing  and using
the  suffix he  had learned  in books.  To his  surprise, Mocha  bowed
again and  smiled. "I am Roisart  Connall. My brother, whose  life you
saved, is  Luthias Connall. The  other man is," here  Roisart smirked,
"apparently our new body guard."
    Bartol frowned. "Yes,  Lord Dargon sent me and the  others to look
after you two."
    "We should be leaving this place," Ittosai recommended.
    "I agree,"  Luthias replied gravely.  "Do come to dinner  with us,
sir," he urged.  "You did us a  great favor this night,  and the least
you deserve is our thanks and our hospitality."
    "You  do me  honor to  invite  me to  the house  of Dargon,"  said
Ittosai. "I will go."
    "Quickly," said Bartol, clutching his arm.
    Quickly, they returned to the keep.

    Roisart, rubbing  his rope-burned  wrists, and  Luthias, clutching
his thinly-sliced  side, rushed though  the gates of Dargon  Keep with
Bartol the  bard and Ittosai Michiya,  the noble from Bichu,  in close
attendance. The city  of Dargon had stealthily and  swiftly snuck into
the dark,  night hours.  From their experience  at the  morning's dawn
and this evening's twilight, the twins knew they were no longer safe.
    Roisart's  head was  throbbing  miserably.  Stubborn blood  seeped
slowly  through  Luthias'  clenched  fingers.  Both  twins  hurt,  but
Roisart  knew by  instinct  that he  did not  have  a concussion,  and
Luthias'  wound was  only  skin  deep, as  much  as  it was  bleeding.
Bartol also  nursed a  minor flesh  wound in his  sword arm;  the bard
sincerely hoped  that all  tendons were  intact. Ittosai  was slightly
winded, nothing more.
    Guards quickly ushered  the wounded party to the  presence of Lord
Dargon,  who was  waiting  for  the return  of  his  noble cousins  of
Connall.  As soon  as  he saw  them,  he rose.  "God,  not again!"  He
looked at the twins, then at Bartol. "Bartol, I gave you orders--"
    Bartol  wore   an  obstinate  mask.   "My  lord,  the   three  you
instructed to  take with me are  dead. If it  were not for my  lord of
Bichu, Master Roisart and Master Luthias would have died too."
    Dargon grimaced  and went to  the door. "Bring Griswald,"  he told
the nearest  servant, who  nodded once and  went immediately  to fetch
the  old physician.  He  shut the  door and  returned  to his  guests.
"Forgive  me, cousins,"  he said  to Roisart  and Luthias.  "I thought
you would be safe in the city."
    "They  waited until  sunset," Luthias  informed him.  "The streets
were almost deserted. This man, Ittosai Mich...Michiya? saved us."
    Dargon  bowed to  the Bichurian  in the  style of  the foreigner's
homeland. "I  am honored  to meet  with you  again, Lord  Ittosai. You
honor  my  household." Past  the  formalities,  Dargon then  said,  "I
thank  you for  saving the  lives of  my cousins,  Lord Ittosai.  I am
indebted to you."
    Ittosai himself bowed  to Dargon's lord. "I do what  any man would
do, Lord of Dargon."
    "I have offered  the hospitality of your household to  the Lord of
Bichu," Bartol informed his lord.
    "You  did  right, Bartol,"  Dargon  replied.  He again  turned  to
Ittosai Michiya.  "You are welcome here,  Lord Ittosai, not only  as a
hero, but as a noble of a great land."
    Griswald almost seemed  to choose this moment to  enter the lord's
study--without  knocking. He  looked  from Bartol  to  the twins,  and
groaned, "Gods  and gods,  what have  you two  been doing  this time?"
Dargon unconsciously  frowned at  the disrespect of  Griswald's words,
but  said nothing,  as he  thought  that the  old man  meant no  harm.
"Bartol,  what happened  to you?"  Griswald quickly  snatched an  herb
and some  cloth out of  his bag and bound  the bard's arm.  "It should
heal quickly.  Don't overuse it."  He turned  then to Luthias  and did
the same. "And what happened to you?" he finally asked Roisart.
    "I  was clubbed  from behind,"  explained Roisart.  Roisart turned
to his cousin.
    Griswald  grunted by  way of  reply,  and probed  the boy's  skull
with dexterous fingers. "No lump. Were you unconscious?"
    Roisart  gingerly   shook  his  head.  "It's   sore,  though,"  he
admitted. Roisart turned  to his cousin. "They  were careful, Clifton.
They didn't  want me harmed. They  clubbed me hard, but  it didn't put
me  to  sleep.  And  then...they  tied  my  hands."  Clifton  frowned,
exchanged  a   glance  with   Luthias.  Luthias  gravely   nodded  the
confirmation of the event and his understanding of its implications.
    Griswald  seemed   unaffected.  "Can  you  see   all  right?  Feel
nauseous? Tired?"
    Again, Roisart carefully shook his head.
    "Then  don't  worry   about  it  until  you   do,"  the  physician
instructed  in  harsh, laconic  tones.  Griswald  then turned  to  his
lord. "If you'll  not be needing me,  I'm going to bed. You  got me up
very  early this  morning."  Without waiting  for Dargon's  dismissal,
Griswald abruptly left.
    "He hasn't  been himself for  days," Dargon revealed,  having seen
Ittosai's perplexed expression following the physician.
    "Can a man not be himself?" Ittosai wondered, no less confused.
    "It's an  expression," Roisart explained  with a smile.  "It means
he is not acting as he usually does."
    "Let's go  to dinner," Luthias  suggested. "It's been a  long time
since Roisart and I ate lunch."
    Dargon  nodded, and  Bartol went  to hold  the door  open for  the
Lord of  Dargon and his noble  guests. As Dargon followed  Ittosai out
the  door, he  said, "You  will be  coming to  the Melrin  ball, won't
you,  Lord  Ittosai?"  When   the  Bichurian  didn't  answer,  Clifton
continued, "You  are invited, as  my guest, as  the worthy noble  of a
distant land."
    "I fear I am not versed in your past-times," Michiya admitted.
    Roisart smiled.  "But it's simple,  Michiya-san. You smile  at the
pretty women--"
    "And try  not to  fall in  love with  them," Luthias  finished for
his brother.
    "A strange expression  is falling in love, as if  one were to fall
into a pit," Ittosai noted.
    "Please do  come, Lord  Ittosai," Dargon repeated  his invitation.
"The people  of Dargon are very  curious about your nation  across the
sea, and want to have better relations with you and your people."
    "I  am not  the best  speaker  of my  people," Ittosai  protested,
"but I will come."
    "Thank you,"  said the Lord  of Dargon. "Please accept  my house's
hospitality for  this night, and  for tomorrow night, after  the ball.
You wouldn't want to miss any part of it."
    "Yes," Roisart said. "I imagine it will be a night to remember."
