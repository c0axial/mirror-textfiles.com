                          Leaving on Vacation
    "What!?"
    Tom stared down at his screen, his jaw hanging slack.
    "Was ist?" Jim looked over from his screen. "Problems?"
    "This thing just ate my files!"
    "Oh. That happens.  Maybe Kitty got hungry. Every now  and then it
decides that  you don't  really exist, and  that your  whole processor
is a  boogum made by a  rat to fool  the operating system. So  it eats
it. Neat,  huh?" Jim turned  back to his screen.  He was one  of those
types that read the specification manuals for the fun of it.
    "Wait! What about my files?"
    "Guess you'll just have to rewrite them."
    "Auuuggh!" Tom  leaned back, rubbing  his forehead. "I'm  glad I'm
leaving on  vacation tomorrow.  Maybe they'll  have this  fixed before
I'm back."
    "What? And kill Kitty? They'd never do that! It'd cost money."
    House  Kitty was  the nickname  the programmers  had given  to the
operating  system. Its  real  name was  HOS/CTI,  short for  Heuristic
Operating  System  /  Collective  Terminal  Interface.  Although  most
programmers still used  rather choppy sentence structure,  it was able
to  understand normal  English,  if there  was such  a  thing. It  was
usually a very  friendly system to work with, but  the last update had
a  special addition.  It  was designed  to deal  with  the problem  of
unauthorized  system  programs, or  rats  as  they had  been  recently
tagged.  These   were  programs   that  crept   into  the   system  on
communication lines. Kitty  would hunt them, and  delete them whenever
it found them. It  had a bug in it, however.  It occasionally ate real
programs.  Fortunately  the  unintentional victims  could  usually  be
recovered. Tom typed in the commands to recover his.
    >cti recover last system deletion
    CTI: YOU HAVE INSUFFICIENT AUTHORITY.PLEASE NOTIFY SYSTEM OPERATOR
    He growled. Stupid machine. Of course he had sufficient authority.
    >cti restart virtual processor
    CTI: ARE YOU SURE? THE PRESENT PROGRAM STATE WILL BE LOST
    >cti yes, stupid
    A moment passed.
    CTI: THE WARM START IS COMPLETE
    >cti recover last system deletion
    CTI: THE LAST SYSTEM DELETION HAS BEEN RECOVERED
    Tom's  screen  cleared and  then  displayed  the lost  files.  Tom
sighed and went back to work.
    Later  that day  the  group  leader mailed  Tom  some last  minute
instructions concerning  the project. The group  was currently working
on a  payroll monitor,  and Tom  had been  assigned to  the protection
schemes.  Tom  read the  instructions,  which  mostly concerned  error
checks  on the  maintenance  password,  or back  door.  He then  saved
them. When  he left the browse  mode, however, and looked  at his list
of  files, he  was in  for  a nasty  surprise. If  one discounted  the
profanity, however, he  didn't have much to say about  the matter. Jim
came over, wondering about the cause of this burst of loquacity.
    "All  gone, eh?  Guess Kitty  got hungry  again. Here  let me  try
something. Maybe I can get it to stop eating your files."
    >cti purge processor state totally
    CTI: ARE YOU SURE? ALL DATA WILL BE LOST
    >cti yes
    CTI: THE PURGE IS COMPLETE
    >cti restart virtual processor
    CTI: ARE YOU SURE? THE PRESENT PROGRAM STATE WILL BE LOST
    >cti yes
    They waited.
    CTI: THE WARM START IS COMPLETE. NO FILES FOUND. ERROR IN LOGON
    Jim  frowned. Sometimes  these  systems could  get obstinate.  Jim
was stubborn himself, however.
    >cti hos vpg * 0000:0 0001<0000/FFFF
    "Take  that!" Jim  rapped  the ENTER  key  viciously. The  machine
gave the visual equivalent of a convulsion.
    HOS: ACTIVE
    "You killed my Kitty!" Tom sounded almost hurt.
    "That'll teach 'er! Now we bring in a clone."
    >load cti
    HOS: LOAD COMPLETE
    >run
    CTI: GOOD AFTERNOON, TOM. HERE ARE YOUR FILES
    A list of all Tom's files spread across the screen.
    >cti set garbage collection on cont
    CTI: CONTINUOUS GARBAGE COLLECTION NOW ON
    "There.  Now  you  shouldn't   have  any  problems.  That'll  curb
Kitty's  hunger  pains. That  lets  her  come  in  and clear  out  the
garbage regularly.  That way she'll  keep a  current record of  you at
all times, and she won't mistake you for a rat."
    The  next day  Tom started  off for  Florida. His  replacement sat
down at Tom's  usual terminal, and typed in the  password off the card
Tom had  left him.  He looked  at the instructions  Tom had  left him,
and  a look  of puzzlement  entered  his expression.  Seeing this  Jim
came  to the  rescue.  After  reading the  note,  however, Jim  merely
walked  off, chuckling.  The temporary  watched him,  and then  reread
the message to see if he might understand.
    THE  PASSKEY  IS IN  MY  MAIL  FILES.  IF  YOU HAVE  ANY  PROBLEMS
GETTING  IN, SEE  MY  NEIGHBOR JIM.  HE'LL HELP  YOU.  CHECK THE  BACK
DOOR, EMPTY THE GARBAGE, AND DON'T FORGET TO FEED MY KITTY!

                     Spirit of the Wood: Chapter 5
    The sound  of prowling animals  awoke Loric the morning  after his
sister left.  They scratched  the bark  around the  base of  the trees
and called  up to him.  "Loric where is your  song?" "Do you  fear the
dawn?"  "Fear it  more than  others for  today you  die!"
    Shivers ran through  him as he crouched on the  wide limb that his
home sat on.  The time of his  death had come! Perhaps  they won't see
me,I can  stay here all  day. But then Loric  remembered who he  was .
He straightened up and looked down  into the half-dark below  him. "Go
find  another's bones  to chew  'Speaker-for-animals', Loric  Tolorion
will  die when  his song  is  done and  not a  note sooner.  Kha-vanth
Tolos Andartha!"
    He spoke the  ritual words of warding and shook  loose some shelf-
fungus, "Go eat your  tails and gnaw on this!" he  cried as he pitched
the  hard  shell-like  fungus  down  into the  dark.  His  effort  was
rewarded  with  a  snarl  of   outrage.  "A  special  death  for  you,
Tolorion-son, a slow, painful one." Then silence.
    Still shaking,  Loric smiled grimly  to himself. There will  be no
skins drying  on Cid'shaa's Tree  this morning. None of  the Tolorion,
that is.
    I wonder how  I WILL die today? Stretched across  a wasp's bole no
doubt, after  taunting the 'Speaker-for-animals' so  boldly. There was
no use  in avoiding it,  so he  shook off his  fears and went  to meet
the day. He  said his prayer to  the Spirit and just  to prove himself
added a new line that just occured to him;

                          Spirit of the Wood,
                           Spirit of the Wood
                         I'd come be with you,
                              If I could.
                           The sun's a-risen
                            and today I die,
                          My spirit's awakened
                            to you It flies.

    He leaped  out to a  vine nearby  and absent-mindedly descended to
the ground . I  wonder if any of the others will  die today, I've been
so wrapped up in  my own ordeals that I've forgotten  that I'm not the
only  one trying  to  become  a man  this  day.  Jakul perhaps,  Yione
surely. He's never had a hard time doing anything.
    Loric  walked the  hard packed  clearing in  silence and  wondered
where  the  Downlander's  were. He  caught a movement  on a  path that
led  to the  clearing where  he  and the  other boys  were tested  for
their knowledge  of bush-craft. That's  right! He thought  to himself,
there was  still time to  recover his  kesh-blade from the  pit before
he died.  If he could work  it loose then  it would be much  easier to
survive the Shreaving.
    A man  could do anything  once he  had his kesh-blade.  The forest
would  clothe him,  feed him,  protect him  and receive  him when  his
song was done, the Spirit willing, that is.
    With no  more hesitation  Loric padded  swiftly and  silently down
the path and round an  ancient  Liamas tree to where  the Pit was. The
log on  which Minial had sat  while witnessing Loric  was still there.
And  the Liamas  bark  rope  he had  fashioned  was  coiled up  neatly
around one  limb. The smell of  Liamas was everywhere and  its   heady
aroma made  Loric smile in remembrance  of the fever he  had when only
four years old, and of Eadie's potions of Liamas bark and pond-scum.
    Eadie's hut  was set by the  river,where it would be  a short walk
for her  to gather  water. Not that  she ever did  menial work  on her
own, she  always seemed to have  four or five downlanders   aiding her
and doing her  work. It was there  that she kept the  roots and herbs,
poultices and potions, and it was there that she kept the Teline.
    Loric decided  that teline  was the  only way  he could  manage to
pull  the kesh  blade from  it's bonding.  He had  seen men  using the
Teline when  the limbs of several  ice-laden trees had given  away and
fallen  on the  Downlanders huts.  They  had chewed  the green  stemed
plant and  it gave  them the ability  to move the  heavy limbs  and to
think like  many hands  on the  same arm. Loric's  father had  been on
the  nets freeing  ice when  that happened,  and no  amount of  Teline
could help him when he fell, his song was sung.
    With a  shiver he  went to  Eadie's hut  and listened, when no one
appeared he  went in and  searched the  many hanging vines  and drying
strings for the  Teline. Dimly he was aware that  somewhere within the
forest  the Downlander's  were preparing  for his  death, and  that of
the other  boys who would chance  the Shreaving this day.  Pushing the
thought aside, he continued his search with determination.
    After a  bit of  frantic searching he  found several  small pieces
wrapped in  a waxy leaf from  the copo tree. Hurrying  back he avoided
taking the  direct paths. There  was nothing  wrong in his  taking the
teline; everything  was there for  those who wanted it,he  just didn't
want to die before he recovered his knife.
    Taking  up the  rope, Loric  breathed a  quick prayer  and solidly
anchored the  rope to a limb  on the log. He  leaned out as far  as he
could and looked down into the dark hole of his last trial.
    The bottom  was hidden in the  early morning shadows but  he could
see the hilt  of the kesh blade  sticking out of the  side right where
he had left it.
    "Blade  of my  father,  have  you been  lonely  here  in the  soft
earth?  Or have the roots of your brethren kept you  warm with talk of
leaf and burr, nut and thorn?"
    Loric 'walked' himself  down the side until he was  level with the
knife and took from  his belt a short green stem  of the Teline plant.
It was  kinked and  had tiny hairs  along the length  of it.  He broke
off a small piece and chewed it briefly.
    When he  felt a burning in  his throat he double-wrapped  his grip
on the rope and then looped it around the ornate hilt of the knife.
    PULL,he  thought to  himself, pull!  It was  always hard  to think
when he  chewed Teline. What it  gave in strength, it  took in reason.
Until later  when it  took  strength  too. Loric  felt the  muscles in
his  neck go  taut  and his  heart  raced  so loud  he  was sure  that
everyone in the village could hear it.
    He took large  gulping breaths and felt a tightness  in his chest.
When his arms and  legs twitched their need to be  used he growled and
pulled on the rope.  He ground his teeth and tasted  blood, for a wild
moment he thought of his position and wished he hadn't chewed so much.
    Then  the knife  began  to give,  it made  a  slow sucking  noise,
reluctant to  leave its  earthen  sheath. Loric  spat on the  wall and
pulled all  the harder, too far  gone to notice the  green-red spittle
that ran  down his chin.  There was a  groaning noise, then  the sound
of the blade  sucking free of the  earth. With a cry  of triumph Loric
straightened  his back  and held  aloft  the newly  freed blade.   Its
resin-coated length gleamed darkly in the sunlight.
    Loric leaped  out of  the pit  and dropped  his rope  unnoticed on
the ground. In  a  moment he had  run around the Liamas  tree and then
kicked the  log into the hole  with one foot.  He felt a rush  as part
of  him realized  that he  couldn't have  moved the  log normally  and
that he would have  a large dark bruise on his heel  to remind him for
many days to come.
    He did  four backward flips  and flicked  his knife at  the Liamas
tree in mid-spin.  It struck the rough bark with  such force that bits
of bark  went flying in  all directions. He laughed  uncontrollably at
the sight and  walked on his hands  over to the tree.  When dark ropey
tendrils dropped on  him  from  above he  showed  no outward  concern,
allowing them  to envelope him  completely. The morning light  was cut
off abruptly  and his breath  began to be  squeezed from him  from all
sides. There was  a sharp pain in  the top of his head  where the hard
bony  beak  of the  creature  was  biting him  but  he  could give  no
resistance. He welcomed pain and howled his pleasure to the Spirit.
    "I  marvel  that  I  know  no  fear Spirit,  I  have  lived  as  a
Tolorion, and I am dying as a Tolorion! Eee-yoooo, a-yay!"
    Loric's cry of  defiance did not go unheard, Cid'shaa  was at hand
and replied in a loud voice of cracking bone and booming drums.
    "You  WILL  fear  Tolorion-son  for  I have  sent  a  Devathma  to
consume you!  I promised you a  slow painful death and  this you shall
have! But as your  spirit flies to join the Spirit of  the Wood, be at
peace.  I will  tell your brethren that  you died  with honor,  like a
man. Thus you will be borne anew, like a man!
    Darkness began to  take Loric and the Teline started  to wear off.
He could  not have called  out if  he had wanted  to, and he  did not.
With a glad heart he went into the darkness...dying like a man!

                    Ceda the Executioner: Chapter 4
    Cander peered  nervously over the rail  of the ship at  the raging
water.  He  had  been  sailing  for  over  a  weak  and  was  not  yet
accustomed to  the violent  upheavals of  the South  Sea. He  wore the
special dark metal  ring (that is commonly referred to  as black gold)
typical of Elven  nobility on his pale hand which  now held tightly to
the railing.  A light rain  had manifested  itself over the  area that
the ship was now sailing and was throwing the little vessel all over.
    Cander was  a large strong  bodied elf. He  wore a dark  cape that
hung loosely  about his stout  figure effectively covering  most parts
of it.  If it  was possible,  which at  this point  it wasn't,  to see
under the  hood about  his head,  you would have  seen signs  of great
sorrow. This  elf was not at  all pleased about something,  and was on
his way to let someone know about it.
    That someone  was of  course Ceda,  who was  at that  very moment,
half out  of his wits  in drunkenness  about three hundred  miles away
in the remote city  of Cramstrock. (This city lay up  in the far North
of No-Al Ben by the Icy Waters of Plime where Ceda was born.)
    It  is then  quite understandable,  that after  months of  endless
searching, and  after finally finding Ceda  who was at the  time, numb
from Cramstrockian wine, he was in an extremely bad mood.
    What had  happened was this:  Cander had  found Ceda in  the local
tavern  drinking  with his  father  and  the  few friends  that  still
remained loyal  to him. He  entered and  demanded that Ceda  come with
him to  the City  of the  Elves. One  of Ceda's  friends, who  was not
particularly fond  of elves, let  alone elven nobility (being  a dwarf
himself), remarked that the elf looked like his old grandmother.
    The  elf, not  very  happy with  the idea  that  he resembled  the
dwarf's  grandmother, took  it upon  himself to  teach the  dwarf some
manners. He  picked up the jug  of ale that  sat in front of  Ceda and
dumped it all onto  the head of the now very  unhappy dwarf. Ceda, who
did not  like having his drink  wasted,  hit the dwarf  in the stomach
with a  stool and the fight  was on. Almost instantly  after the first
punch, everyone  in the tavern was  jumping in to help  friend against
friend; what a scene it was!
    Fortunately  for the  elf, all  were drunk  but he,  so he  waited
until everyone had  been beaten senseless by one another,  and then he
dragged Ceda  off and hoisted him  onto a horse, leaving  for the Port
City of Dhernis immediately.
    Ceda awoke  the next morning to  the sound of the  market place in
the heart  of Caahah.  He wasn't  sure at  all how  he got  there, for
that  matter,  he  wasn't  even  sure where  'there'  was!  The  first
thought that  entered his  mind was food,  and lots of  it. He  got up
and  dressed and  then looked  around the  room to  see what  he might
find. All the  elfs things were there, but he  didn't remember that he
had met  anyone recently. Everything  was strange to him.  Many things
were  in  the  room,  none  his, and  he  didn't  want  whomever  they
belonged to to find him lying around their room.
    He opened  the door  and went  into the  tavern down  stairs where
Cander was sitting drinking a glass of wine.
    Cander turned  and confronted him:  "Good day, Ceda of  No-Al Ben.
You are  a hearty  sleeper! all  the way  from the  shores of  the Icy
Waters  of Plime!"  The elf  threw back  his head  in laughter.  "I am
Cander of Perstanie."
    Ceda walked  over to the elf  and grabbed him by  the collar. "Who
in Tavaar's name are you, and where might I be?"
    The elf  choked, and his  hand flew to  Ceda's arm. The  dark gold
band upon the elf's finger caught Ceda's eye and he released his grip.
    "Rackins of  the Elves has need  of your presence," said  the elf,
as he fingered  his neck. "It is  a strange man that  greets people in
such a manner," joked the elf, trying to settle Ceda's temper.
    "And what is Rackin's wish with me  after so many a  month, for it
has been since last October that I last lay eyes upon his noble face?"
    "And  it  is from  November  to  March  that  I have  sought  your
company.  It  is  for  the  most part  about  evil  tidings  from  the
mountains  in  South.  The  dark creatures  that  dwell  therein  have
gained control  over the crown  of Grobst D'arbo's  and seek a  way to
destroy it."
    "About what  crown do  you speak?  For that  which I  remember had
since  returned  to  the  underworld.  Be  there  two  of  these  foul
things?" said Ceda.
    "Nay, and  you know this to  be true," replied the  elf. "For what
purpose do you ask such foolish questions?"
    "If my memory  does not fail yet, The demon  that sought the crown
had found the crown. You say that it has been won from him?"
    "The spell caster  Merth has not revealed to me  his thoughts, but
he has summoned you  to his palace in the City of  the Elves, which in
itself  is  an  honor  that  rivals  even  the  greatest  of  nonelven
nobility. But  as for now,  haste is upon us,  for I have  wasted many
months in  searching and  must not delay  anymore with  idle questions
that  will be  answered in  due  time. Make  haste now  that you  have
awakened, for we ride for Dhernis!"
    "If it  is Merth that  seeks my presence,  then I shall  come, for
it is  probably of  great importance  if I  am to  be dragged  from my
home like a common thief. Let us make haste!"
    The elf  disappeared for a  moment through  the doors that  led to
the upper  rooms and  returned with  his things.  Then they  both left
together and rode all that day for the port of Dhernis.
    They rode fairly  quickly through the country  of  Ruirse, Ceda on
a light brown horse supplied by the elf.
    "And what  of your dragon  mount, Melgon?  I sought him  before we
left Cramstrock, but to no avail," said Cander.
    "Melgon has returned  to Cergaan, though I know not  how he did it
without wings.  He has been  gone for  fourteen days, and  will remain
gone for  another moon," answer  Ceda. "There  comes a time  each year
that he departs  without word nor warning, but he  leaves message that
it is to his home, far beyond the City of the Elves, that he goes."
    At that  moment Ceda stopped his  horse. He looked off  to the far
South Towards  the high mountain  peaks that  rose in the  distance as
Cander  rode  up  along  side  of him.  From  where  they  stood,  the
mountains were  almost invisible being so  far away. "We now  ride for
the  Cliffs of  Belos at  the feet  of the  Sarshirian Mountains,"  he
said at length.
    "Why?" cried  the elf  in dismay.  "We must  make the  greatest of
haste to the City  of the Elves, and the Gate  of Ploughdom that leads
into the  infested mountain and  its dungeons and towers  interests me
not! I  shiver at  the thought  of the foul  stinking things  that lie
beyond the pass!"
    "And  all the  same, we  will make  for it  and then  for Dhernis.
There is something  afoot in those peaks. Methinks that  it is best to
look lest we  miss the ranks of  orcs marching foreword to  war out of
the Gate of Ploughdom unnoticed."
    "And if they are  on the march," said Cander, "it  is not this elf
that wants  to meet them on  their way to whatever  their destination.
They have  grown strong in  numbers since  the battle at  the fortress
of Num-deaon.  And may Tavaar  know what draws  you to the  borders of
that deadly place?"
    "I know  not what,  but I sense  that all is  not well  within the
land of Gate.
    "I  wish only  to  see  if they  have  indeed  passed through  the
border into  Ruirse. It is not  my motive to battle  the entire orcish
legions, or  whatever other dark  foes that Ileiruon may  have brought
forth from  the abyss," said Ceda,  "and it will lengthen  our journey
but a  week." With  that, he reared  his horse to  the South  and rode
down towards the Gate of Ploughdom.

    Further and further  South they rode, passing the  large forest of
Carne to  the East  as the hours  wore on. The  mountains came  up and
met the  sky in  splendor with their snowy  white peaks  glittering in
the sun.  After five days of  uneventful riding, they were  only fifty
miles  from the  closest of  the Sarshirian  mountains, called  by the
orcs and other  evil creatures, Onibus, after the  battle of Ploughdom
13,000 years  before when  Ileiruon's followers  were lead  to victory
by  a demon  called Onibus.  Men,  Elves, Halflings,  Dwarves and  all
other  creatures  in alliance  with  Sarve,  had called  the  mountain
Barnonoen,  the name  that was  first given  to it  over 15,000  years
before  by  the Old Folk  that  lived  in the  land  before the  first
wave of evil swept over the continent from Cergaan.
    They passed the  ruined castle of Nuum-Orron,  brother fortress to
Nuum-Deaon just  visible against the  Northwestern sky, and  veered to
the Southwest in  order to meet the cliffs of  Onibus (the cliffs were
called Belos  as a whole, but  when referring to a  certain area, they
were called the cliffs of the mountain that they  belonged to) a day's
ride from the gate.
    The sky  was growing steadily  darker with clouds the  closer they
got, even though they were still a day's ride from  the closest of the
mountains. Clouds  were coming up from  the south and a  cold wind was
blowing harshly  hampering their progress.  They decided to  return to
the  sheltered  walls   of  Nuum-Orron  for  the   night  before  they
continued on to the gate.
    The  castle was  large  and supposedly  deserted  for many  years.
They rode  through the long open  gate into the vast  courtyard and to
the  far  side where there was  a door  large  enough  to admit  their
horses. Ceda  dropped from  his mount  and went  to search  the castle
while Cander set up camp.
    When  Ceda returned,  Cander approached  him. "I  don't like  this
place, Ceda, It has a foul reek and the horses are uneasy about it."
    "The  night air  will offer  no  cover from  the wind  and the  on
coming rain  clouds should they decide  to spill on our  heads, and it
is foolish to  risk camp outside so close the  the threshold of Onibus
and the  Gate. I  have looked  around and have  seen naught  nor heard
footfall, alas  we may be  safe the one night  that we spend  so close
to the Dark  Doorway!" answered Ceda, not at all  pleased with the Elf
for his timidness.
    "Then here we  will stay, but I  am against it all  the same." And
with that final word, Cander went to sleep leaving Ceda the guard.

    Early the next  morning they were off, towards the  dark figure of
a mountain  that loomed  before them.  The peaks  now rose  high above
their heads  into the clouds  and out  of sight. Every  moment brought
them closer to the  dark opening that held so much  terror for the Elf
and  wonder for  Man. The  nearer they  got, the  more the  Elf seemed
uneasy, but with  good reason, the tales told of  those that were held
there, and  by some luck  escaped were  horrifying. Tales told  of the
foul creatures  that lived  therein hewing off  limbs of  captives for
pleasure. These thoughts did not comfort Ceda or his companion.
    Finally  they reached the mountain's  base and  turned now  toward
the West to come  to the gate riding in the shadows  of the tall peaks
to their  left. All  around the Borders  of the  Sarshirian mountains,
steep  overhanging  cliffs  towered  up hundreds  of  feet.  The  only
entrance  was  through the  Gate  of  Ploughdom  that the  Dwarves  of
Psardon had made in centuries past.
    After  another  hour  of  riding, they  approached  the  gate.  It
looked like any  ordinary cave to them,  a dark hole in the  face of a
large mountain  side; but  somehow,  it  seemed  threatening, menacing
almost. A  pungent smell issued forth  from the crack filling  the air
with an unholy odor of some vile creature or creatures.
    Ceda dropped from  his horse and went forth.  Cander started after
and grabbed  his shoulder. "Have you  not seen enough? If  they do not
await  your coming  outside the  Gate must  you go  forth and  present
yourself to them?"
    At that moment, four husky looking creatures dropped  from a ledge
in the cliff  far above landing squarely on Ceda  and Cander. Ceda was
knocked to  the ground under the  weight of the beast  and Cander fell
from his mount with a heavy thud on the dry ground.
    Before any  could draw  their swords, they  were both  subdued and
totally unable  to move. Ceda saw  one of the beasts  strike Cander in
the back of  the head with a heavy  club, and then he too  felt a blow
from behind and remembered nothing more about that day.

    Darkness followed  in the days  to  come;  wherever  Ceda  was, it
was pitch  dark and noisome.  The smell was enough  to drive a  man to
tears, and it took  its toll on the prisoners. Ceda  awoke to the same
vile odor as  before, but much nearer and stronger.  His head hurt and
he was very hungry.  He was sprawled out on a flat  surface in a pitch
dark cave or room somewhere in the Sarshirians.
    And so he lay,  bound in heavy chains at his  heels and wrists and
surrounded by  total darkness;  needless to say that  he knew  not for
how long.  Hour after  hour dragged  on and still  he heard  no sound.
The smell  grew in his  nostrils to the  point where he  was screaming
in agony, and still no one--or nothing came.
    After what  seemed like years,  a creaking  noise was heard  and a
faint light shone in  the room he was in. The  walls were covered with
a faint  ooze like substance.  He lay on a  bed of solid  rock against
the far wall, and all around him dark shadows moved upon the ground.
    The light  grew stronger and before Ceda knew it, there  were four
tall Orcs  before him.  The light  hurt his eyes  and he  cowered back
turning his weak head to the wall.
    They undid  the clasps at  his wrists and  feet and lifted  him up
setting him on the  floor. He fell over again was  placed on his feet.
Then  they started  out of  the room  and down  a long  corridor. Ceda
fell  to the  floor many  times and  was dragged  when this  happened.
They didn't speak. Not one word. And the smell was beyond imagination.
    The corridor seemed  to go on far a long  while, and frequently it
would   bend  suddenly   and  resume   itself  in   another  direction
altogether.  Sometimes  they  passed  other  corridor  entrances  from
which came the  same vile smell, and sometimes great  stone doors that
were shut fast had a dim outline in the dark walls.
    At length, they came  to a large door set at the  end of that long
passage.  One of  the Orcs  entered and  the remaining  stayed outside
with Ceda.  After a while  at the door, the  door was thrown  open and
Ceda was lead  into  a great hall. It spanned far and  wide, and in it
were a  great many foul smelling  beasts like those that  had captured
Ceda to begin with.  At the center of the far  wall, raised high above
the heads of all  Orcs and other beasts, sat a  mighty being, one that
Ceda had never seen  before in all his travels. He  was lead before it
and  dropped by  the Orcs  to the  ground, as  he could  not stand  by
himself in  his weakened  state. All  he could  think about  was food,
for he  had not eaten since  he was captured some  days before, though
he knew not how long ago.
    There was  a onset of  hideous laughter  as he struggled  to stand
but could  not, and  finally was  content to  sit up  in front  of the
great seat that loomed before him.
    "Well," it  hissed. "We  seem to  have caught  a spy.  From Ruirse
perhaps?  or be  it from  New Grandydyr?  Weuyrt? From  whence do  you
ride, Elf tamer?"
    Ceda did  not reply,  his mind  was too  tired and  he was  far to
hungry to  even pay attention to  the thing, but rather  sat and gazed
up past  the  throne into  the darkness of the  ceiling that stood far
over head.
    The beast  continued, "or be you  from the weak realm  of Pirintar
in the  north or  Prass to  the far  east by  the great  water? Answer
me!" it shouted.  but Ceda still gazed at the  ceiling high above with
a partial smile on his pale lips.
    Then  the  beast signaled  to  one  of  the  Orcs and  it  stepped
foreword  kicking Ceda  in  his back  with all  its  might, its  heavy
studded  boots digging  deep  into Ceda's  flesh.  Ceda screamed  with
agony and fell unconscious to the floor.
    "Remove  him until  later," said  the Beast.  And a  smile crossed
his lips, "and see that he is well fed!"

    When Ceda  next awoke, he was  back in his cell,  now chained only
at at one  ankle. His mouth was  dry and it pained him  to swallow. He
rolled over onto the  floor just  in time  to see an  Orc leaving  his
chamber.  Before him  on a  dirty plate,  lay a  large piece  of meat,
freshly  cooked and  spiced. A  feeling  of wonder  passed before  his
eyes accompanied by disbelief but  there was  the meat,  steaming hot,
its smell  god-like to his  nose. At once he  grabbed at the  food and
began  to eat  as if it  was long  forgotten  to  him  (and  indeed it
had been  for some days), the  fragrance of the spices  overcoming the
noisome stench of the stale dungeon air.
    When Ceda had  finished, he sat back against the  wall and rested,
for after  not eating  a long time,  the food sat  heavily in  his now
full stomach.  Some time later,  the faint  creaking of a  door echoed
though his chamber  followed by foot steps. Before long,  a beast much
like the  one on the  throne appeared before  him with a  water pouch;
until then, Ceda  had not even been aware of  the thirstiness that had
long grown  in his  dry mouth  until now  and grabbed  at the  sack in
desperation. The  Beast let it fall  and the precious liquid  ran onto
the floor.
    "That's  all you'll  get for  today, scum,"  it said.  "Better you
learn to  use your tongue  or you'll not  drink 'till the  morrow," it
laughed. "Lick, scum,  lick from the floor as do  the beggars!" and it
left the cell,  with  one final  word: "enjoy  your meals while  they
last!"  it said  and choked  with laughter.  And then  heart stricken,
Ceda began to lick.
    Ceda sat  back after  a long  and disgusting  drink trying  not to
think  about it.  He thought  for a  moment about  what the  beast had
said 'while  they last,' he  said to  himself. 'While they  last,' and
coming to no conclusion, he forgot about it and went to sleep.
    And the  days wore on  in the same  manner. The beast  would bring
him  strange meat  (for  Ceda had  never before  tasted  it) and  Ceda
would eat  and drink his fill.  Presently he became accustomed  to the
smell and it no longer troubled him. And he grew stronger.
    After what  had seemed about  a month (by Ceda's  reckoning), once
again the  Orcs reappeared  and took  him down  the long  corridor the
throne  room. This  time,  Ceda entered  with pride,  for  he was  now
fully healthy  again, and  as strong  as ever  before. He  stood above
all  other beasts  in the  room  with his  head held  high before  the
might of the ruler.
    "Now, scum," it started. "I trust you have eaten well?" It smiled.
    "Yes  I have,  Lord. From  what  beast is  this meat,  for it  has
strange  virtues?" answered  Ceda, thinking  that he  did not  want to
know the answer.
    "Elf," smiled the beast.
    Ceda was  right: he really didn't  want to have known  what he had
been  eating thus  far, a  feeling  of dread  filled his  face and  he
thought  about Cander  for the  first time  since being  captured, and
the terrible  fate that had  become of him. At  last he knew  what the
other beast  had meant  by its  remark about how  long the  food would
last.  The  room  was  again  full  of  hideous  laughter  and  Ceda's
confidence was wavering.  To the end of his days, he never forgot that
moment that  he had been told  of his meals,  nor could he bear  to be
with elves for any length of time before guilt got the best of him.
    Anger  welled up  inside of  him. He  thought to  smite the  beast
where it  sat. His  hand flew  with lightning speed  to his  side, but
his sword had  long been taken away  from him as had  all other things
save his cloths
    "From whence do you  ride," it now asked in a  grim voice. "And to
what purpose do you dare approach the Passage of Ploughdom?"
    Ceda did not  answer, but instead he stared in  hatred at the face
of  the beast  that  loomed over  him. It  repeated  its question  but
received  no answer  still. Then  it lashed  out bending  foreword and
with one great arm knocked Ceda from his feet to the floor.
    Still Ceda  said nothing  to the growing  anger of  the chieftain.
Finally, after  many strikes  from the  Orc guard and  a few  from the
ruler himself, they gave  up. "Take him back to his  cell and we shall
see how long  he will remain quiet  to the face of  hunger!" It yelled
as Ceda was led from the room.
    Down the long  winding and twisting corridor was Ceda  lead by his
Orc escort  until his  own room was  in sight. As  they drew  close to
the door,  Ceda leapt foreword  pushing the two  Orcs in front  of him
to either side as he sped off down into the darkness of the passage.
    Great was  his speed  as he  outran the  pursuing Orcs,  but their
cries brought  still more terrible  things forth from  the surrounding
openings  and  doors  until  the  way behind  was  filled  with  angry
creatures running fast and tireless after him.
    The  corridor sloped  down, then  up  and bore  right, then  left.
Twisting and  sloping the  tunnel wore  on in  an almost  never ending
path.  Finally,  a  faint  glimmer  of  light  could  be  seen  ahead.
presently The glimmer  grew into a opening and  without stopping, Ceda
ran forth and  out into the sunlight  for the first time  in well over
a month.
    But  the trouble  was  not over  yet.  Ceda was  out,  but he  was
alone, unarmed  and without  food. Still he  continued down  the rocky
slope of  the mountain side he  had come out  of at a fast  pace. Pain
welled up in  his chest but still  he ran on, pursued only  now by the
beasts like the one on the throne, for Orcs hate sun light.
    After a while,  Ceda had to stop. Being faster  than his pursuers,
he had  long since stopped hearing  the sound of running  feet behind,
but that  would not last long,  for if the creatures  behind him could
not track, the Orcs  could, and would soon be after  him as the sunset
drew near.
    Now almost  at despair, he started  out for the borders  of Ruirse
in the hope of  finding a place in the steep cliff  low enough to jump
from. It was his only hope, and that in itself was small.
    He had  been silently  moving at  a steady  pace Eastward  but was
extremely tired.  The sun had dropped  behind the tips of  the Western
mountains and his  shadow grew long. 'Time for a  rest,' he thought to
himself as he  climbed up a tree  and sat down among  its branches far
up out of sight. Then, breaking a few of the  larger branches, he laid
them out  making a crude  but safe bed  among the loftier  limbs. Soon
it was  pitch dark.  The moon was  hidden behind a  rocky peek  off to
the north  leaving Ceda  stranded in the  tree should  trouble pursue.
The  air had  a dank  smell of  burning flesh  that came  up from  the
East; the direction that he was now headed.
    During  the night,  all seemed  to  change. Even  though Ceda  was
being  pursued,  he  had  noticed   that  the  country  was  gradually
becoming emptier  of any and  all things  that usually dwell  in those
parts. Not  a sound  was heard all  that night, and  the only  life he
could  see were  the plants  and trees.  The quiet  was discomforting,
Ceda  would have  been more  at ease  were he  attacked or  something,
weird though it was. Finally, sleep took him.
    The next morning, he  woke up and to his surprise,  he had not yet
been  found. He  was so  tired that  last night,  that it  didn't even
matter to  him weather  he was  caught or not,  and indeed  Orcs could
climb trees  as well as they could track. Something wasn't  right, but
Ceda had  not the time,  food or energy to  even care. He  should have
rightly been dead or captured by then.
    The morning  was young,  and the  sun was  just creeping  over the
eastern  peaks.  Ceda  climbed  higher  and  peered  out  through  the
branches over  the trees Eastward. The  land about a mile  off dropped
suddenly  into a  valley and  all  beyond, between  the mountain  that
Ceda was on  and the mountain bordering Ruirse was  hidden from sight.
That valley  went for  about thirty  miles before  Ceda could  see the
slope of  the next mountain  climbing steadily upwards. 'About  3 days
journey on  foot,' he thought  to himself, 'if  the valley is flat and
straight'. Then, climbing down the tree, he set off.
    The valley  was further than the  trees had shown. After  the mile
of tree  tops that Ceda had  seen, the trees had  suddenly stopped and
a  long barren  field  continued  for another  mile.  The morning  was
waning and  Ceda still had  not eaten. After  reaching the end  of the
field, he took digging up roots for food, much to his distaste.
    From the  end of  the fields, the  valley  descended  acutely into
more trees  far below.  A small  winding path in  bad upkeep  led down
the almost cliff like face into the valley. This he took.
    Walking all  day, he  finally reached the  bottom of  the mountain
and  ate  more  of  the  roots  that he  had  found.  After  a  little
searching he found  a stream that ran into a  small lake. Drinking his
fill, he swam the lake and continued walking on the other side.
    Upon reaching  the valley, the  trees began to reappear  until the
forest was like a  dense wall all about him. Moving  now would be slow
and cautious.
    Before long, he  realized that the smell of the  burning flesh had
returned and  it was now  growing stronger.  The ground was  now level
and  things  were  beginning  to   look  as  they  should.  Bats  flew
overhead,  noises  returned  to  the   dismal  mountains  and  in  the
distance, Ceda  could hear the faint  shouts of Orcs. He  continued in
the same general direction but away from the shouts.
    After a  while longer  of walking,  the yells  became unavoidable.
They were all around  him now, yet not to close, and  to go back meant
death  by the  other  Orcs or a long journey  around  the valley  that
would take more time then Ceda had to spare.
    Cautiously he ventured  foreword towards the sounds  and at length
to the edge  of a clearing. Here shielded by  the trees and shrubbery,
Ceda  could  see many  of  the  same  creatures  moving about  in  the
sunlight where  the trees had  been quickly uprooted and  burned. Some
Orcs were  about but not  many; They were kept  busy by the  orders of
the  other beasts  at whatever  they were  doing. Ceda  could not  see
much, but it looked to him as if the beasts were preparing for war.
    Many of  them were around  going here  and there with  wagons full
of  tridents and  axes,  others  were running  all  over  the camp  on
errands of their own.  Far off in the Center of  the clearing, a large
hole had been  dug and many Orcs  went in and out. They  all wore mail
armor and  carried the axes  that were made  in the fields.  They also
carried bucklers  with a  golden crown  painted on  it. The  crown was
richly  inlaid with  Malthoogian gems.  All  the shields  were new  as
were the axes and  the armor, and in the distance,  Ceda could see the
faint glow of blacksmiths hard at work forging more.
    Ceda stayed  and watched,  not daring  to move  until the  sun had
long gone  down and  night was  upon them. The  moon was  still hidden
behind the  mountains and it was  totally dark except for  the torches
that were  in and  around the  camp. Many of  the beasts,  Nuadrin, as
Ceda began to call  them, had gone into tents that were  set up in the
camp. Now many  Orcs were about here and there  shouting orders at one
another and arguing amongst themselves in there own harsh tongue.
    The night  drew on and  presently Ceda  fell asleep in  the scrubs
where he hid. Morning  came and he was awakened by  the sunlight as it
rose above  the far off mountains  in the East.  The burning  was much
closer now and he could finally see what it was: men.
    He sat  and watched all day  growing very disgusted at the ghastly
sight, yet very hungry as well,  until nightfall. Then, using  all his
talent, as  a master assassin, he crept quietly from  the edge  of the
clearing back  into the forest where  he found both food  and water in
a shallow stream that ran down the mountain slope from the West.
    After  eating,  he began  the  slow  journey of  encompassing  the
entire camp  of about  ten thousand  troops of  Orcs and  two thousand
troops of Nuadrin (as well as he could reckon).
    The night  went slowly but  at length  Ceda had reached  the other
side of the enemy  camp and had begun again his  path toward the large
mountain that towered above him.
    Leaving the  bloody camp  behind, he  had travelled almost another
ten miles  from the Eastern edges  of the camp when  daybreak overtook
him. He settled  down and went to  sleep among the branches  of a tall
pine tree out of the sight of all watching eyes of the mountains.
    That  night after  a  long  rest, he  awoke  to  the tree's gentle
swaying in  the breeze  leaving him  with a  slight chill.  Tonight if
all went  well, he would  reach the base  of the next  mountain, Psom,
and  would climb  about half  way  to the  point where  he thought  he
could see  a pass between  it and an  adjacent mountain that  Ceda did
not know the name of.
    The  night drew  onward.  Walking very  surely  and quietly,  Ceda
slowly  approached  the  mountain. Nuadrin  were  everywhere,  walking
about in  heavy plate mail  with long  black tridents and  small round
bucklers; all  with with the  sign of the  crown on them.  They passed
commonly on  a road that Ceda  now followed about twenty  yards to the
right so as not  to be seen when troops passed. Now  and again, ten or
more  Nuadrin would  pass with  about  fifty men  chained together  in
some heavy  grey metal. Their  faces were sad  and they did  not speak
to  one another.  Sometimes, he  could hear  the crack  of one  of the
long leather  whips that the Nuadrin  carried on some mans  back, then
a yell of agony, then silence.
    Orcs also  trudged up and  down the  road, but not  as frequently.
They  were usually  led by  one of  the Nuadrin,  who were  larger and
stronger looking.
    After an  hour or two,  Ceda left  the  road altogether  and  made
his way  towards the  mountain pass.  It was not  long before  he came
upon the  road again going in  the same direction. 'Must  have changed
course,'  he thought  to  himself  and followed  on.  The road  veered
South as it came  to foot of Psom and widened a  little. He decided to
follow it a little to see where it headed.
    Even on  the mountain, the  trees grew just  as big and  as thick.
They  may  even  have  become  denser,  but  because  of  the  general
incline, his way  was hampered in many places. Now  and again the road
would turn  and head either  North or South  as the slope  became more
acute but for the most part the road went up towards the pass.
    Then all of a  sudden, the road ended. As it came  up the slope it
became so wide  that it was not  really a road any more.  Then it just
gradually disappeared out of sight. Ceda  walked along the area  for a
while before a troop of Nuadrin came marching up the road.
    When they  reached the end,  they walked  along south for  a while
until  they came  to the  base  of a  small cliff.  Then, the  Nuadrin
leader went  foreword and pushed at  the wall of rock.  It opened into
darkness and all the troop entered.
    Then the door  closed swiftly leaving no trace in  the side of the
steep wall.
    Ceda ran  to the door  and put  his ear to  it. He could  hear the
Nuadrin singing  until their  voices vanished into  the depths  of the
cave. Their deep voices echoed in the cavern as they sang:

                           "Plunder we shall,
                   and spill the blood of the enemy,
                   until all their vast kingdoms lay
                           dead at our feet.

                         Kill their old Kings,
                   and spill the blood of the enemy,
                   until all their hearts beat at the
                           sound of our feet.

                           Pay them we shall,
                   and spill the blood of the enemy,
                   until all their men band together
                               and meet.

                          Fight them we shall,
                   and spill the blood of the enemy,
                  until all their great gold lay down
                            under our feet.

                   Drive them out, we shall we shall.
              KILL THEM and BEAT THEM until they all flee.

                           Out we shall pour
                 from the new gates of Psom and Dearn,
                       continuing the work of our
                              Lord Onibus.

                           plunder we shall,
                   and spill the blood of the enemy,
                   until all their vast kingdoms lay
                           dead at our feet."

    Then their  voices were  lost to the  tunnels under  the mountain.
The sound  however was replaced by  feet coming up the  path. He leapt
from  the opening  into  the cover  of the  trees  just before  around
thirty Orcs came marching  up the path. Then he went  as quietly as he
could up through a worn path away from the company.
    Soon  he heard  the voices  of  the Orcs  below as  he left.  They
spoke in common tongue so they must have had a Nuadri with  them.  (As
do all other forms of speaking beings,  Nuadrin have  a unique  tongue
than most  cannot comprehend,  therefore, they are  forced to  use the
Common Speech when talking to things of other races.)
    "Blyazax," hissed the  leader to one of the Orcs  in the first row
of  company. "I  smell Men  here. What  tunnel do  they march  the Men
from now?"
    "From the  North opening,  you know that.  Let me  smell." Replied
the  Orc coming  foreword.  Ceda froze  and  listened intently.  Faint
rustling among  the ranks was  heard and  then a sniffing  sound, long
and loud.
    "You're right Aejr. There were men  here, and  his smell  leads up
from here.  They've probably  seen the entrance  now! better  take the
troop up  after him before Ifaduk  finds out and throngs  us all! Come
on guys, after him! They can't be far from the smell of things!"
    There  was another  rustling among  the  men, and  then many  foot
steps in  Ceda's direction. He  jumped up and  ran with all  his speed
up  the side  of the  mountain towards  the pass  high above  him. The
Orcs were making  good speed up the mountain but  were slowed by their
heavy armor  and weapons.  Ceda   was far stronger, faster  and didn't
have any armor to hamper him so it was not a problem to outrun them.
    Soon  the sounds  of pursuit  were faint  and the  yelling between
them was  remote. He sat  down against the trunk  of a tree  unable to
run any  longer without a brief  break. The night was  almost over and
day would  make him visible to  all eyes. He  got up and went  on. The
voices  were  much  clearer  now  than they  were  before.  They  were
tracking him well.
    Gradually  the mountain's  slope  increased  until continuing  was
only possible by  crawling almost vertically. Trees grew  all over the
mountainside  and made  his way up easier, but there  was still a long
way to  go before even  reaching the pass, and  after that it  was not
certain  that he  would find  a  way through  and then  down from  the
dangerous cliffs of Psom.
    After  another hour  of climbing,  the pass  was within  sight but
the sounds  of feet  were still  close at hand.  The  going  was  slow
for both Ceda  and the Orcs, but they were  making headway faster than
he. The vile smell of the dungeon at Onibus was in the air as the Orcs
gained  on him  up  the slope.  They  would soon  reach  him at  their
current pace.
    The  smell grew  in his  nostrils  until the  remembrance  of  the
Elf,  Cander,  came to  mind.  That  drove him  on  up  the slope  and
finally to  the pass with  an outburst  of hidden strength.  Anger now
drove him and  welled up within him  as he climbed up  onto the narrow
ledge  that was  formed  by the  merging  of two  lower  parts of  the
adjacent mountains.
    The ledge  was not altogether  flat, but  it was firm  and narrow.
Ceda decided  to turn and face  the enemy before all  his strength was
gone. He  turned and leaned  against the wall  of the mountain  on his
left and  rested until the  first malformed  head of a  Nuadri soldier
popped out of  the trees below. Then  it was only a  matter of seconds
before it was at the edge of the pass.
    It looked  up  and  saw Ceda  waiting  for it. Then  with a Cry in
another tongue,  it hastened up the  remaining feet to the  pass. Ceda
was  ready.  He  stood  back  letting the  Nuadri  up  and  then  like
lighting  threw both  his fists  down on  its large  head knocking  it
down.  Then  he jumped  on  it  catching its  head  in  his hands  and
turning it until its neck it broke with a shuddering crack!
    Then  he undid  the  small  buckler from  its  back  and took  the
trident from  it where it  lay at the  Nuadri's side. Then  finally he
unfastened a  pouch that hung  about the beast's side and  waited  for
the rest of the Orcs to catch up.
    It was not  long before one, then three, then  ten had poked their
heads out  of the trees underneath  Ceda. Seeing their leader  dead at
his feet  demoralized them a  little, but  seeing that there  was only
one man to deal with gave them the courage to approach.
    Then Ceda  threw the body  down at them  knocking two of  them off
the side  of the mountain into  the trees far below.  The rest climbed
up towards the pass with malice in their eyes.
    Ceda stood  his ground until they  had gotten within reach  of his
trident.  Then he  slowly  backed up  through the  ledge  of the  pass
until they  were all  on the pass  in a single  file line  before him.
The one in  front fell first. He  had made a charge at  Ceda which was
easy  enough to  block with  a simple  thrust of  his own  driving his
weapon deep  into the belly  of his opponent.  The second came  up the
pass and  tripped on his  fallen comrade, he died  quickly afterwards.
The third  and forth  Orcs fell in  the same way  and the  rest turned
and fled over the  side of the steep ledge in  the direction that they
had come. Some  crashed into the the trees far  below dying instantly,
while two  or three made  it down without serious  injuries. Gathering
the things  of the  fallen Orcs  and placing them  with the  things of
the Nuadri leader, Ceda started down the Eastern face of the mountain.
    As soon as  he left the Western side of  the mountain, the climate
changed  as if  by magic.  What was  calm and  humid was  now dry  and
cold.  Nothing  grew  there  and  no water  ran  down  in  streams  so
frequent on the Western slope.
    The sun  was shining down nearly  overhead by the time  Ceda found
a place that  he thought was safe to sleep  without danger of pursuit.
The Orcs  were all underground  by now and  the Nuadrin would  have to
climb up through  the pass in order  to find his trail; so  he went to
sleep peacefully for the first time in nearly six weeks.
    That night  when Ceda  awoke, he found  that nothing  had changed.
He looked  at the  things that  he had gotten  from the  fallen Nuadri
leader and Orcs. Finding  one sack full of a strange  kind of wine, he
gladly  quenched  his  growing  thirst.  Then  rummaging  through  the
remainder of the  things he found some dried meat  (that he threw away
quickly), three  more skins of the  wine and a golden  medallion (from
the Nuadri) with the  symbol of the crown painted on  in dark grey and
black colors.
    Then  he  started down  the  mountain.  Going  down was  far  more
dangerous then  going up. Below  him about  five hours away,  were the
cliffs of Belos that surrounded the entire Sarshirian mountain range.
    The way  down was quite steep.  This made five hours  into ten and
then  twenty. The  trees that  had earlier  helped Ceda  up the  other
face of  the mountain did  not grow on the  face he now  tread. Trying
to  keep his  feet  in a  sure  place,  he made  his  way slowly  down
stopping only to find food among the berries and to rest his legs.
    Day came quickly,  but not without being wanted.  Ceda's legs were
tired  and his  back  ached  from the  continual  stooping. Finding  a
place to lie  on one of the  many jagged rocks that jutted  out of the
mountain face,  Ceda fell into  an uneasy  sleep, for the  next night,
he would reach the cliffs.
    When he  awoke, the sun  had already set and  the sky was  full of
clouds. Rain! Ceda  jumped to his feet and looked  down. He was closer
to  the cliffs  than he  had thought  the previous  night, but  it was
still a long way  down, and with the rain, he could  be washed off the
face  entirely.  He opened  a  skin  of wine  and  drank  most of  it.
Replacing it at his side, he started down.
    It  was about  an  hour before  he  had reached  the  tops of  the
Cliffs of Psom. He  lay flat on his stomach and  looked over the edge.
About four hundred  feet below him was the foot  of the cliff. Looking
in each  direction showed  that the  same distance  down was  held all
along the  face as far as  the eye could  see. Then by the  pale light
that the moon  cast down through the  clouds, he saw it.  To the North
towards the border  of Grobst D'arbo's desert, a  tiny figure appeared
out of the face  of the cliff. Before long, about 20  of them had left
the cliff base and  Ceda could see that they were  Orcs. They wore the
same  armor and  had  the same  weapons  as he  had  seen earlier.  He
watched the  band until  they were  out of  sight then  he got  up and
started South along the head of the cliff, searching for a way down.
    The clouds were  growing thicker and the night was  drawing on and
getting steadily cooler.  He walked along for  sometime wondering what
would become of  him. Then he found  what he had been  looking for: in
the  cliff, a  deep gash  ran up  from the  ground to  the top  of the
cliff just wide enough for him to fit in.
    He  sat down  on  the edge  and inched  himself  into the  ravine.
Pushing  on either  side  with his  hands and  feet,  he held  himself
while he  made his  way down. The  way was slow  and tedious,  but the
rain did not fall and the ravine did not widen.
    About a third of  the way down, he came upon  an opening along the
chasm.  It was  big enough  for him  to fit  inside, indeed  even room
enough for  him to  stand and  walk around  in, and  soon he  was fast
asleep on the rocky floor out of danger for the time being.
    The midmorning  sun roused him as  it shone through the  hole into
the cave  upon  his face.  Drinking  some of his  wine and  eating the
rest  of  the  berries  he  had  collected  along  the  way  down  the
mountain, he soon started again.
    It had  rained while he was  asleep and the way  was treacherously
slippery,  but he  managed  to  find handholds  and  not  to fall.  By
midafternoon he  had made his way  almost to the bottom  and slid down
the rest of the way to the ground.
    He was finally  out of the Sarshirian mountains  in the wilderness
of Ruirse.

                            Choice of Heart
    Phil stepped out of  the mess hall just in time  to hear the final
call, and  to hear  the CRACK  of the rifles.  He and  everyone around
him just  stopped for a moment,  not quite looking at  each other, and
then continued with  their business. Phil and four other  men from his
squad  continued  toward their  barracks.  As  he walked  towards  the
bunkhouse,  Phil saw  the  door to  the old  warehouse  open, and  the
soldiers filing out.  He counted sixteen. That meant  that four people
had just been executed.
    Phil  and his  buddies joined  their squad  leader in  their room.
While the five  soldiers strapped on their gear their  leader read off
their assignment.  It was a typical  one. Phil had been  in Miami only
four days, and already  he had lost count of how  many missions he had
been on.  He had no trouble  remembering how many deaths  he had seen,
however, nor  how many he  had caused. An  image of a  young, pleading
face hung  before his  mind's eye,  and only when  one of  his buddies
nudged him did he realize that his assignment was being read off.
    Phil and  the other men in  his squad marched out  of the building
to where  their plane was waiting.  They climbed in, the  squad leader
going in  first, Phil going  in last. Phil  dogged the door  shut, and
then the  plane was  rolling. It  lifted off  quickly, it's  fat wings
using the  airstream to  best advantage.  The plane  climbed steadily,
pushing the  soldiers against the  floor with extra weight.  More than
one wished  for a window  to look out of.  There was no  talking. Phil
checked  his rifle  carefully. He  counted  his rounds,  he made  sure
that  the  chamber  and  flues  were clear,  and  that  the  generator
operational.  There  would be  no  chance  to  do  that later.  As  he
checked his  equipment, Phil had a  chance to think about  what he was
about to  do. He had  joined the military  out of financial  need, but
when the  President had declared  a national emergency because  of the
drug problem, he  had welcomed the action he saw  as a result. Finally
he had  a moral reason to  be carrying a  weapon. It was only  when he
was transfered into a domestic area that he started to have doubts.
    They had  been in the  air for about  ten minutes when  the leader
started  giving last  minute instructions  to the  men. Phil  listened
intently,  as did  all the  others,  being especially  careful not  to
misunderstand  their role.  The  squad leader  spoke  until the  light
above the  door came  on. He  then gave  one last  encouragement, then
shuffled over to  the door. He pushed the door  open, and tumbled out.
One by  one the  others followed,  with Phil pausing  to push  the ALL
CLEAR button before jumping.
    The squad  leader struck the roof  of the building with  the force
of a  small car. Unfortunately the  roof was sound enough  that it did
not break,  removing some  of the  element of  surprise. The  next two
soldiers landed on  the pavement in front of and  behind the building,
however,  effectively blocking  escape.  The next  soldier, and  Phil,
also  landed on  the  roof.  Phil managed  to  hit an air conditioning
unit,  which  broke through  the  roof,  providing quick  access.  The
other two on the roof quickly followed Phil through the hole.
    Phil and  the other soldier,  John, immediately secured  the room.
It  was a  large  studio, which  hadn't been  cleaned  for quite  some
time. While  they were doing that,  the squad leader pulled  a thermal
scanner  from  his  pocket  and  quickly searched  for  all  the  heat
sources  in the  building. The  nearest  one appeared  to be  directly
below them.
    John took  point, and Phil took  up the rear, as  the trio quickly
but  quietly left  the  studio,  and started  down  the hallway.  They
froze when sounds  could be heard from below, but  the scanner did not
show any of the sources to be moving, so they continued.
    At  the end  of  the  hallway they  found  dozens  of brown  paper
boxes. While Phil  and John watched, as witnesses,  the leader quietly
opened one.  It was no surprise  to Phil when the  squad leader pulled
out a  plastic bag  full of  white powder. The  squad leader  pulled a
small probe  out of his  belt, and  sank it into  the bag, but  it was
more  of a  formality than  anything else.  Phil could  recognize Slam
when  he saw  it. The  drug was  responsible for  more death  than any
other illegal  drug since heroin, and  much of it to  innocent people.
Mere  possesion of  it was  a capital  crime under  martial law.  Four
people had been shot that morning for owning it. Phil hated it.
    They  reached the  bottom of  the stairs  without making  a sound,
the force fields  around their bodies supporting  them millimeters off
the concrete steps.  The stair emptied into a hall,  with two doors on
the  left and  one on  the right.  The scanner  showed one  large heat
source behind the  first door to the left. Phil  hugged the wall, just
to the  left of  the door, facing  in, with John  hugging the  wall to
the  right.  The leader  put  away  the  scanner, readied  his  rifle,
switched his field to assist, and kicked.
    The door  was a cheap wooden  one, and it gave  way spectacularly.
The remnants  of the  flimsy barrier bounced  across the  room, waking
it's  inhabitants.  The man,  probably  the  main pusher,  yelled  and
rolled across  the woman, who  screamed and clutched the  blanket. The
squad leader  covered them, and started  to shout an order  to freeze.
The drug  dealer grabbed a small  automatic off the night  stand as he
fell from  the bed.  Just as  Phil stepped into  the room,  the dealer
sat up, and aimed the gun at the squad leader.
    The roar  from the  weapon blanked  out all  thought in  the room.
Phil stepped  back and  aside, to  get a clearer  field of  fire. John
did the  same. Before either  of them  could really aim,  however, the
shooting  was  over. The  squad  leader  stood  with his  legs  apart,
holding the  railgun at his  waist. The drug  dealer was lying  on the
floor, his  body almost  bisected by  two gaping  wounds. The  bed was
lying  in two  pieces, the  body  of the  woman mostly  hidden in  the
bloody  blanket. The  three  stood  there, frozen  for  a moment.  The
woman's body  slowly slid  off the  bed to  the floor,  on top  of her
dead  lover. The  leader  carefully approached,  and  checked for  any
vital signs.  There were none. It  was probably just as  well, thought
Phil. Better  a quick killing  here than to have  to take them  in and
have them shot.
    The  leader headed  for the  door. Phil  turned and  followed him.
The leader  stepped into the  hallway, and  there was the  sudden bang
of a  large caliber pistol. The  squad leader was pushed  aside by the
force of  the bullet encountering  his force field. Phil  stepped into
the doorway,  rifle up, back against  the frame. The attacker  was two
doors down, on  the right. He fired  before Phil had a  chance to aim.
The slug hit  Phil's breastplate like a well-thrown  fastball. The man
ducked back  into the room. Phil  didn't even really aim.  He held the
trigger down,  and tracked  with the  muzzle. The  incandescent rounds
converted  the cheap  concrete of  the walls  into deadly  shrapnel as
they punched  fist-sized holes in  the cement. Phil stopped  after six
shots,  and John  scuttled down  the  hall, weapon  ready, while  Phil
held his position.  John's expression let Phil know that  there was no
longer  any danger.  Phil turned  to the  leader, who  climbed to  his
feet, a little embarrassed at having been caught.
    While John  checked the drug runner  for life, Phil and  the squad
leader  checked each  other for  wounds. Then  the squad  leader broke
out the  scanner again. It  showed no  definite targets. As  they were
on  the  fourth floor,  however,  they  still  could not  relax.  They
reassumed their positions and started down again.
    Phil had  just started  down the  next flight  of stairs  when the
feeling he  had dreaded  hit him.  It hit  him after  every successful
mission,  and sometimes  during  a mission.  It  was terrible  feeling
that he  had just participated  in someone's death. Sometimes  it only
happened afterward,  as in this case.  What was worse was  when he got
it  beforehand,  as  he  often  did  when  testifying  in  the  short,
formalized trials  that had been  held daily  for the last  four days,
where the soldiers  were required to help convict the  people who they
brought in from  the drug raids. Phil had watched  a seemingly endless
stream  of people  standing before  that awful  table, as  he and  his
fellows had  told of  drugs and  weapons found  on premises,  found on
persons,  found in  cars. What  was really  awful was  when they  were
young, say his age, and when they were female.
    The  next  floor  was  clear,  as was  the  next.  A  heat  source
appeared when  they reached  the ground floor,  however. It  seemed to
be coming  from the basement.  Cautiously John started down  the stone
steps, the  leader and Phil  right behind. At  the bottom there  was a
locked door. John  carefully picked it, and pushed it  open. It opened
on a  panorama of  chemistry. Tubing,  stainless steel,  and chemicals
littered  the large,  well-lit room.  As  Slam was  synthetic, it  was
possible  to produce  it almost  anywhere, with  the right  knowledge.
>From  the looks  of the  setup, a  little of  the right  knowledge was
soaking into the rugs four stories up.
    The leader indicated a  door on the other end of  the room. It was
open, and  the three slid  in. Phil could see  that the signal  on the
scanner  was  a strong  one.  The  hall  they  entered was  short  and
narrow, with  a door  at the  end, and  one on  the right.  The leader
indicated the  far door,  and John  stepped up to  it. He  switched to
assist, and  was about  to kick it  in when the  leader tapped  him on
the shoulder.  As the leader waved  John off, Phil could  see that the
signal was  so strong  as to  be indeterminant.  The leader  turned to
Phil,  and  motioned  at  the  other door,  which  Phil  was  standing
beside. Phil's  heart started pumping.  The squad leader  motioned for
Phil to do the honors. Phil switched on, readied his gun, and kicked.
    In the  gloom it was  a moment before he  saw the stubby  tank. He
immediately recognized it  as a water heater. The leader  stared at it
for a  moment from the  doorway, then gave  a grim chuckle.  He turned
and started for the stairs, John behind him.
    Phil  stood there  for  a  moment, grateful  for the reprieve.  He
started to turn to leave, and saw the foot.
    It was mostly  hidden under a rag. It was  bare, and dirty. Phil's
heart  started   hammering.  Suddenly  everything  seemed   to  become
crystal clear.  He could  hear the  gentle rustling of some  papers as
John knocked them to  the floor on his way to the  door. He could hear
the  soft, electric  hum of  the  water heater.  It was  almost as  if
someone else was in  his body, and he was just  watching, as he leaned
forward and looked around behind the tank.
    She couldn't  have been  more than  nineteen. If  the look  on her
face hadn't  been so terrified,  she might  have been pretty.  She had
long blond hair,  and blue eyes. And she was  staring straight at him.
He  opened  his mouth  to  call  his companions,  but  as  he did  she
silently mouthed a  desperate "No", and the words froze  in his mouth.
It was then that he saw the patch on her arm.
    Slam  is a  strange drug.  It has  mild halucinogenic  effects, as
well  as  being a  powerful  stimulant.  There  were rumors  that  any
sensation  experienced  while under  it's  influence  was magnified  a
hundred  times. It  was  also  very volatile,  making  it possible  to
absorb the drug  through the skin. The  standard way to use  it was to
sprinkle some  on gauze, and tape  the gauze to the  skin with plastic
tape, allowing  the user's  body heat to  evaporate the  chemical. The
usual place to put the patch if one was a solitary user was the arm.
    The girl  was still staring  at him,  pleading. She knew  her life
was in  his hands, Phil could  tell. He stared at  the patch, thoughts
and images running  through his head. The squad  leader, knocked aside
by the  pistol slug.  A young  pleading face,  blood sprinkled  on the
forehead,  the eyes  fixing, glazing.  A friend,  a comrade,  lying on
the sidewalk,  eyes up,  as if to  look at the  small hole  punched in
his forehead. The  woman upstairs, her hair flying  slightly upward as
the leader's  rounds sprayed  her internal organs  on the  rug beneath
her bed.  Another pretty,  young woman, crying  beside her  car, which
held the  body of her young  husband, an innocent bystander  killed in
a drug war.
    "Please," Phil heard her whisper, "I'll do anything, anything..."
    Phil  stared at  her. He  imagined her,  handcuffed to  the wooden
pole, her back to the four soldiers, aiming their rifles.
    "Please, no..."  He looked at her.  She noticed the patch  for the
first time, pulled it off.
    "Phil?"  John   called  from   the  stairs.  Phil   turned  aside,
startled, then  looked back  quickly. She hadn't  even moved.  She had
her eyes  closed. Phil realized  that she  could think of  nothing she
could  offer Phil  for  her  life. Indeed,  Phil  realized, there  was
nothing here, in her whole way of life, that was of value to anyone.
    "Lieutenant, John! I think you'd better come here."
