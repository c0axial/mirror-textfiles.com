    Hello  one and  all!  No  really exciting  or  motivating news  to
report, so I'll  just jump into a description of  this issue. There is
no Dargon  work in this  issue, although  you'll find a  couple choice
tidbits from  some unexpected sources.  However, for those of  you who
actually enjoy  the Dargon material,  here's a  hint of what's  in the
works for the near  future! John White is working on  a new tale which
I have seen parts  of, and it promises to be  a classic. Joseph Curwen
is plowing  through the  next tale  in the  Atros cycle,  which should
also be out soon.  I am, of course, humbly plugging  away at my story,
which should be ready very soon (no promises, however).
    It is  at the close of  the editorial that I  historically welcome
our new  readers and emplore people  to spread the word  about FSFnet.
Well,  as we  have over  300  readers who  get the  file directly  and
uncounted millions  (?) who get  the magazine from  servers, secondary
distribution  sites, and  who knows  where else,  I've decided  that I
can finally  sit back  and pass  up the opportunity  to remind  you to
help get  others interested  in FSFnet. Of  course, this  doesn't mean
you should stop spreading the word...

                          A Death in the Attic
    Tina  slowly closed  the  door  behind her  and  proceeded up  the
attic steps.  The fading  light of  the autumn  sunset cast  a beaming
ray through  the only  window that  caused all  it touched  to shimmer
with a  golden hue,  while at  the same time  it cast  dark, forboding
shadows  about all  that were  out  of its  reach. Tina  paused for  a
moment, and smiled  to herself at the  sheer irony of it.  How much it
was like her own situation now.
    She  flicked  on the  light,  and  immediately  all but  the  most
hidden corners  were were bright  and visible. She stepped  around the
trunk  which   held  her  mother's   wedding  gown  and   high  school
yearbooks,  crossed  over  her  grandfather's  antique  clarinet,  and
stopped in  front of  a small  coffer. She paused  for a  moment, then
reaced  for  it  and  undid  the  latch.  Trembling,  she  opened  the
silver-lined box  and picked up  the ring  that lay inside.  It looked
ordinary  enough -  carved out  of silver  with a  ring of  rubies and
emeralds encircling a  medium sized diamond in  the center. Definitely
a treasure  by any standards, but  also much more. Tina  held the ring
tightly in  her hand, and thought  once more about what  she was about
to do.  She had  spent the  last hour  just trying  to decide  what to
say. She was sure  this was what she wanted, but at  the same time she
couldn't help  but feel  a great  dread deep  in her  soul, and  for a
moment  considered  just putting  the  ring  back and  forgetting  the
whole ordeal.  At the same  time, the caring  nature of her  soul kept
crying out  for her  to do it,  that this was  the greatest  thing she
could ever  do. Eventually,  her caring side  won out.  She unclenched
her  hands and  slid the  ring on  her finger.  At the  same time  she
glanced at her  watch. It read 6:47.  She would have to  hurry, or she
would be late for her job.
    She closed  her eyes and concentrated  on the ring, just  like she
had accidentally  done earlier today.  In a  moment, she felt  a small
gust of  wind, and  then heard  the voice.  "Yes, Tina  Redgrave, have
you thought of your first wish yet?"
    She opened  her eyes, and gazed  directly at the man  she had just
met a  little over  an hour ago.  He stood about  six feet  high, with
dark black  hair and  a very  heavy build which  matched his  voice. A
nearly  perfect specimen  of  a  man, and  Tina  felt  the same  surge
within her  again. This time,  however, she was prepared  and replied,
"Yes, I have."
    "And what is your wish?"
    "My first wish is this: I wish there was no longer any death."
    The  man  frowned. "Have  you  thought  long and  seriously  about
this? Are you absolutely sure that this is what you want."
    For  a  moment  she  considered  crying  out  No,  I'll  think  of
something  else. But  when she  thought  about all  the suffering  she
could alleviate  with just that  one phrase, she  had to do  it. "Yes,
I'm sure. That is my first wish."
    The man  sighed. "It shall  be as you  have it." He  gestured into
the air, and a  huge spark of energy flew from  his fingertips out the
window and disappeared from sight. "Are you ready for your next wish?"
    Tina, still  staring at where  the energy ball had  passed through
the window,  jumped slightly and said,  "No, I'll have to  think on my
next one too. How about if I call you again tomorrow morning?"
    "Whatever  you wish,  Tina  Redgrave," he  said,  then faded  away
into nothingness.
    Tina took  off the ring, placed  it in the coffer,  closed it, and
then rushed  downstairs. It was  now 6:50.  If she hurried,  she still
could get dressed and make it to Kmart before her 7:30 shift.

    Tina could  hardly keep  in her  excitement as  she jumped  out of
her car  and practically flew  into the  store with minutes  to spare.
She  took off  her coat  and  walked briskly  over to  her station  at
booth number  nine. Stacey,  the girl who  worked the  previous shift,
was standing  there totalling  up the  price of  an old  man's sweater
and pipe.
    "Hi Stacey, how's it going tonight?"
    She turned  and smiled,  but there  was a note  of concern  on her
face. "Hi,  Tina. You seem  awfully bubbly  tonight. Here you  go sir,
and thank you for shopping at Kmart."
    The  man walked  past  them  with his  purchases.  Tina looked  at
Stacey  carefully and  said, "What's  wrong?  And don't  you dare  say
nothing - I know you better than that!"
    Stacey  turned  up  the  portable  radio she  kept  next  to  her.
"Haven't you heard? Listen to this."
    Bill  Artwood, the  local news  reporter, was  talking. "-admitted
just  a few  mere minutes  ago.  Apparently, he  was the  victim of  a
mugging  in  Central  park.  He has  suffered  multiple  stab  wounds,
including one  right through  his left  lung, but  is still  alive. He
has been  placed under  heavy sedation, but  the doctors  don't expect
him  to live.  They  were  totally amazed  that  he  lived this  long.
Whether  this has  any connection  to the  terrible accident  on James
and Third is unknown."
    "James and Third?  That's nowhere near Central park.  What does he
mean about a connection?"
    "You didn't hear?  You mean you didn't listen to  the radio on the
way down to here?"
    "No, the time kind of flew by for me today."
    "Well, at  about 7:00,  I guess  you would have  been on  your way
soon  after, a  tractor-trailer lost  its brakes  and plowed  straight
through a  red light into  a small  Subaru. The Subaru  was flattened.
Of  course   a  big  pile-up   occured,  and  three  more   cars  were
demolished. But  the strange part is,  no one died. The  two people in
the  Subaru  were  horribly  mangled,  and  another  had  his rib cage
completely collapse against  the steering wheel, but all  of them were
fully  alive  and  conscious  too. they  were  screaming,  those  that
could. One paramedic was  so sick he had to leave  the rescue team for
a while - Tina? Are you OK, Tina?"
    Tina just  stood, shocked. What  could have gone wrong?  How could
this be  happening? This  wasn't the  way it  was supposed  to happen.
She had  said, I wish  there was no more  dying, and- no,  that wasn't
what she said.  She heard her own  words now as plainly as  if she was
in her  attic again  - "I wish  there was no  more death."  She hadn't
said dying, she had said death. She turned hard and ran for the door.
    "Tina? What's wrong? Tina?..."
    Tina  pulled into  the driveway  and leaped  out of  the car.  Her
keys fumbled  with the  lock, and  it took her  three tries  to unlock
the front door.  Finally she succeeded and slammed open  the door, not
even bothering to get  her keys. She ran inside, up  the stairs to the
second  floor,  and  into  the  attic. switching  on  the  light,  she
stumbled her way  across the littered floor to the  coffer. Tears were
streaming down  her eyes  now as she  put the ring  on her  finger and
concentrated.  In  a  moment  the   man  appeared  again.  "Yes,  Tina
Redgrave, have you thought of your second wish?"
    "I want to  change my first wish!" she nearly  screamed. "I didn't
mean to say it  that way except that I was so  excited but that wasn't
what I meant to say and you've got to change it, please!"
    He looked  at her with  a gaze that chilled  her to the  bone, and
she quieted  down. "Normally,  you could  use another  wish to  undo a
previous wish, but  this is a slightly different case.  You wished for
there to be no more death, so I destroyed him."
    "Him? What do you mean, him?"
    "Death is  an entity whose  touch causes  the soul to  be released
from the  body. Without him, all  souls are bound to  their hosts, and
can't die. This doesn't mean they can't be hurt. They just can't die."
    "Well, bring him back! That isn't what I meant to say!"
    "If it  was a normal person  or thing, I could.  However, death is
an entity of great power, and it will take time to create him again."
    "How long?"
    "I would say about 36 hours."
    "36  hours? But  what about  all those  people out  there who  are
supposed to be dead now? I can't simply let them go on suffering!"
    "You could find a replacement."
    "What?"
    "A replacement.  Someone who could temporarily  take death's place
until I can re-create him."
    "How?  Do I  just walk  up to  someone and  say, 'Hey,  this genie
just  granted  me  a wish  and  I  wished  for  no more  death  so  he
destroyed him  and now  we need  a replacement'?  I hardly  think that
will go over.
    "I'm afraid that that's your problem."
    Tina thought  for a moment, then  came up with an  idea. "Alright,
here's my second  wish. Let me become death while  you try to recreate
the original."
    "As  you wish,  Tina Redgrave."  He  waved his  arm, and  suddenly
Tina felt  different. She was  dressed in  black robes. She  looked at
her hands,  and saw that  they were  nothing but bones.  Suddenly, she
felt a  surge of power,  and knew  what had to  be done. She  flew out
the window  at an incredible speed  and soon found herself  next to an
old  man  in a  hospital  bed.  She touched  him,  and  a white  globe
floated up skyward.  She then flew across the continent  and touched a
young boy  just as he hit  the ground after leaping  from the eleventh
floor of  a hotel.  His soul floated  out of his  body. Then  she flew
elsewhere,  again and  again for  thirty-eight hours  without a  stop.
When she was  caught up, she used her powers  to temporarily stop time
for a while, then flew back to her attic.
    She  stood for  a  moment, shocked  and appalled  by  all she  had
seen.  Some people  she had  to touch  were in  such a  horrible shape
that she  felt like  throwing up  her last  dinner, except  that death
couldn't do that  of course. She walked over to  the coffer, opened it
up,  and put  on the  ring.  In a  moment, the  genie appeared.  "Yes,
death, can I help you?"
    "OK,  here's my  third wish.  Return me  to normal  and let  death
resume his job.  I'll never forgive myself for wasting  my wishes, but
I guess it's too late to change that now."
    "I'm  sorry, death,  but  I  can not  help  you.  My services  are
currently being  given to a young  woman named Tina Redgrave.  You are
not Tina  Redgrave, you are  death." With  that he vanished  into thin
air, leaving death to stand and bemuse the fate befallen on her.

                                Lifesong
                           Viam ad Infinitum
    Space...a  void not  empty. Planets  and moons,  followers of  the
great ones,  the stars,  move in  time with the  great music  which is
not heard  with their children,  the comets and asteroids.  These ride
the coattails  of their parents,  occasionally breaking away  to amuse
themselves with  the games of  the innocence of youth  before becoming
planets  themselves  and  taking  the orbits  planned  for  them.  The
planets for  the most part  cared only  for themselves, but  the stars
were constantly  shining light upon them  all, and because of  it many
of  the planets  reflected the  light of  the great  sun and  began to
live, and walk toward the path of becoming a star.
    There  stood in  the  darkness of  night and  the  cold of  death,
alone in a  prison of metal a  man, with his face in  the direction of
the  east, eyes  shut, waiting.  Flint-faced and  unmoving in  the icy
wind  of  Altus V  which  probed  with  invisible fingers  any  living
flesh,  his  clothing  could  not  keep  out  the  intangible  members
feeding  on his  comatose mind.  It  was dark,  the dark  of a  remote
planet near the  edge of the universe;  no stars and no  moon shone on
the forbidding  ebony landscape.  The man's  gloved hands  were nearly
frozen  to the  bars they  clutched, the  heavily booted  feet were  a
part of  the deck on  which he stood.  All was utterly  silent. Behind
eyes shut and ice-coated, there was blackness.
    The sky  before his  face suddenly grayed,  casting upon  the face
of the watcher.  Slowly but steadily the horizon paled,  and the forms
of a few  unhealthy clouds appeared, a dirty white.  Now the winds had
ceased  to  blow,   though  still  the  landscape   was  anything  but
appealing...  and with  the luminescence  a smell  became apparent  to
frigid nostrils:  the smell of  death and  rot, of terror.  Exposed by
the  steadily-brightening light  was an  expanse of  bare rock  pocked
with  the remains  of plants  and animals  long vanquished.  Bones and
ash, fragments  of unburned roots  and cinders adorned the  surface of
the dead planet.
    Now  the glow  of the  firmament  grew more  quickly, showing  the
black of  his robe, tunic, and  trousers. A cape of  red completed the
costume, and  his gloves  and boots were  likewise as  unliving blood.
Black  hair,  moustache and  long  beard,  caked with  ice,  testified
somewhat  to his  middle age.  ragged clouds  of moisture  escaped his
lips, though  there was no  other sign of life  in him,  and this  but
infrequent.
    But  behold! for  at this  time,  a voice  carrying one  wonderful
note  of  music  quiet  yet  powerful, was  imposed  upon  the  world,
drowning  the  sounds  of  silence.  The  sweet  voice  increased  its
volume,  and the  grey  of  the edge  of  the  horizon glowed  faintly
pink... it increased  again; the planet shuddered. Yet  again. And the
planet  shook this  time;  and  reaching its  peak  the  music of  the
morning  shattered the  walls  of  silence! As  the  walls of  ancient
Jericho they crumbled  before the trumpet's blast,  the mighty Singer.
The   first  streaks   of  color   ripped  apart   the  grey   of  the
sky...fragments  of  cloud  disintegrating,  the  heavens  burst  into
flame. On Jason's world the sun rose.
    And  as it  then looked  upon the  planet, there  appeared at  the
man's feet,  green in the  midst of  the destruction. A  single flower
of blue  and gold grew, bloomed,  and around it sprang  up grasses and
flowers of  every kind,  until the  surface of  the world  was covered
with the  fresh, living  color and  there was no  trace of  the former
cataclysm! Now also  began trees to sprout, and there  were forests of
mighty  Sylvan specimens  to  rule  over and  care  for their  younger
cousins and  remove from  the air  the horrible  stink. When  this was
accomplished, it  was yet the  first hour  of morning. The  note which
had broken the  walls of death and darkness now  became Song. In sweet
liquid voices it  flowed over Altus Five and collected  into paths and
channels, where followed cool water for the sake of the living things.
    Now Jason  had not moved  in all  the time previous,  being nearly
dead from the  cold but the rays  of the sun focused upon  him and the
song once  more changed.  Now growing bold  and strong,  beauty became
handsome; the  music washed  over him  as the rains  of the  spring. A
drop of filthy  water dripped from beard and  fingertip, moustache and
boot, and collected at his feet in a growing pool of red.
    And  as this  man's  flesh  began to  live,  yet another  wondrous
thing happened.  As the Song washed  his flesh, the powerful  light of
the sun  also washed over him...and  the dye of his  garments faded to
be replaced  by a sparkling  white. Trembling with all  the excitement
of a  newborn, the emerging butterfly  which sees light after  so long
in darkness, the  eyes of gold opened; Jason began  to live. And there
was  much rejoicing  in the  galaxy,  and the  sun and  the song  were
happy at  these works and rejoiced  long. For after years  in the grip
of death  a man  gained the eternal  life of one  whose soul  has seen
the morning.

                                Shakka!
    It  was  a  day as  any  other,  Jardell  awoke  to the  smell  of
smoldering  wood  outside  his  father's  campaign  tent.  His  mother
quietly rattled  with her pots  and spoons  which she used  to prepare
breakfast.  He gently  attempted to  recall  the dreams  of the  night
before,  but he  could not  fathom  their nature.  Then he  remembered
that today  was to be a  special day: He would  go on a hunt  with his
friends of  the surrounding  tents, and Lenda,  daughter of  Jast, the
merchant travelling  with them for  their protection, would  join them
at  a secret  meeting place  later in  the day.  Lenda's father  was a
coward,  and as  Jardell thought  of this  large, heavy  man with  the
constantly  dirty  hair, a  jeer  spread  across  his face.  The  only
reason why he  let Jast treat him  as he did was  because of Jardell's
desire for Lenda's love. Today would be the day of fulfillment.
    He  smiled as  he thought  of  the day's  plans: He  and the  gang
would go  out to track  down a few coyotes  and maybe even  attempt to
kill  and hide  one, just  so as  to  be able  to show  that they  had
indeed done  something useful  upon their  return. However,  hey would
cease this  activity as soon  as the sun  reached it's peak  and would
then  meander to  the  Shakka  tree a  league  away  from their  camp.
Shakka trees were  strange creatures: They were plants,  but then they
weren't. Whoever sat  within it's Sphere of Dreaming, or  Shadow as it
was  called by  the  elders,  would mindlink  with  the Shakka  entity
which, according  to legend, resided  not in  the tree itself,  but in
the netherworld  - reputedly  near Odin's  Valhalla. This,  mixed with
the  lack  of  factual  knowledge,  made  Shakka-sitting,  as  it  was
called, a  very adventurous thing  to do.  The elders forbade  it, the
young ones craved it.  It was addicting, to an extent,  but not to the
point where  one could not rip  oneself free from the  Shakka's grasp.
Once mindlink  was established, the  Shakka would, upon  deposition of
a small  part of one's  lifeforce, create any  phantastic circumstance
one  desired.  One  could  reenact anything  one  could  imagine,  and
always  escape unscathed,  as  the Shakka  thrived  on lifeforce,  and
would not  destroy his guests  for fear  of them not  returning should
they be  mentally scarred.  The elders  disapproved of  such unworldly
pleasures,  as deposition  of  a fragment  of  lifeforce weakened  the
character and shortened  one's lifespan, or so they  said. Also, there
had  been reports  of Shakka's  that had  extracted all  of a  guest's
lifeforce  while they  were journeying  in the  land of  make-believe.
Such  stories were  told  by  hardcore users  to  Virgin Dreamers,  as
first time users were always called.
    Today  would  be  different  from other  Dreamtimes,  however,  at
least for  Jardell and Lenda.  They would  commence to make  their way
to  man and  womanhood  while in  the  shadow of  the  Shakka. It  was
considered the  ultimate act of love  to copulate in it's  shadow, and
Jardell  had always  desired for  his  Passing to  be of  such a  high
caliber. He  was excited  and fearful,  and for  the first  time since
the plan had  evolved out of their young minds  did he discover doubts
in  his  mind. His  father  had  concluded  his  Passing in  the  same
manner, much to  the disapproval of the elders afterwards,  and he had
given Jardell  only one  piece of  advice on  the matter:  "Wait until
you feel  that it may be  the wrong thing to  do - then you  will know
that  you are  ready...". These  words reverberated  through Jardell's
young head  over and  over, pushing  tears from  his eyes  and causing
him  to tremble  all over  his  body. He  wanted  to call  it off;  he
suddenly thought  it was  the wrong  thing to do  after all.  He would
tell Lenda  that he didn't  think it was such  a good idea,  she would
certainly understand.
    After  having dressed  and  eaten breakfast,  he quickly  gathered
his hunting implements  and headed for the meeting  place just outside
the camp.  Two of his friends  were already there, evidently  in eager
anticipation  of  the day's  coming  events  as they  hastily  greeted
Jardell  and  then  went  back  to  discussing  any  possible  evasive
actions should  such be  required. Jardell  sat next  to Rhun,  one of
his better  friends and inquired  why they were even  considering such
possibilities, as they all knew the Shakka was their private secret.
    "Because, Jardell, one  of the elders COULD have  found the Shakka
on one  of his spiritual  walks. It is  unlikely, but possible.  It is
true that  we planned this well  by telling your father  that we would
be hunting coyotes  by the old cave,  as that one can  draw a straight
line from the Shakka  to the cave, and it will  pass right through the
camp,  but all  possibilities  MUST be  considered!"  Rhun had  always
been a  pessimist. In  either case,  Jardell had  already made  up his
mind that  he would  not make  the Passing  under the  Shakka's shadow
after all,  so all that  could happen to  them is mild  reprimand. The
other  two participants  in  their campaign  arrived  soon after,  and
they set out for the old cave.
    The trip lasted  an hour, which was normal for  Drytime, and their
waterskins  were soon  depleted.  They  arrived  at the  old cave  and
promptly made  their way to the  hidden stream inside to  refill their
water supply and  to quench their thirst. Then they  sat upon the cold
clay floor  of the  main dome  and proceeded  to devour  their brought
rations hungrily.
    After a short  rest, they headed out to hunt  coyotes. They needed
not  search long,  as  their  tracking and  hunting  skills were  much
improved from  the previous year.  They had soon entrapped  a confused
dog in  their midst and  were jabbing  the snarling animal  with their
spears.  As  they   continued  their  deadly  game   with  the  doomed
creature,  they  debated  who  should  give the  fatal  blow.  It  was
decided  that  Jardell should  do  so,  as  he would  be  consummating
Lenda's  love and  completing his  Passing on  this day.  All involved
smiled jealously  as the decision  was passed, all except  for Jardell
who blushed.  He nodded  silently, saying  nothing about  the decision
he had  met earlier. He prepared  for the deadly blow,  and the others
tightened  the  circle about  the  crazed  animal. Jardell  aimed  and
thrust his spear  at the coyote's head, thrusting with  all his might.
The thrust  struck the animal beneath  the right eye and  glanced off.
The entire  group fell  silent for  a split second  - a  glancing blow
during a  hunt was  an omen  that any decisions  passed that  day were
bad. Jardell fell  back in horror -  only he knew that  the omen could
apply  directly. The  others fired  him  up, yelling  to complete  the
kill,  and Jardell  thrust  again.  This time,  the  coyote was  stuck
squarely in  the eye; the spear  head pierced it's brain  and a shower
of  blood  burst forth  from  it's  nostrils as  it  jerked  in a  few
spastic motions  and finally remained  still. The boys  gathered about
the  dead animal  and  congratulated Jardell  on  his excellent  kill.
None even thought of  the omen, no one thought it  applied, no one but
Jardell, and  while he  shook his friend's  hands, he  quietly thought
about  his  decision  this  morning.  He  felt  a  nudge  beneath  his
stomach, and  suddenly the decision not  to follow the plan  was wiped
from  his  mind.   He  began  to  smile  in   eager  anticipation  and
disemboweled  the  coyote with  such  fervor  that it  even  surprised
Rhun,  who knew  Jardell to  be the  hardworking type  under all  that
lazyness. The  carcass was skinned  and the hide  was hung up  to dry.
Rhun built a fire  and stuck five neatly cut pieces  of coyote meat on
a thick stick  which was kept in  the storage area of  the cavern. The
boys  gathered  about  the  fire  and  began  the  almost  ritualistic
telling of  stories. One could tell  that they were all  ready for the
Passing, but  only one member  of a  Circle of Friendship  was allowed
to do  so every  phase of  the moon. Soon  the time  to travel  to the
Shakka  came and  they  gathered their  posessions  and wandered  off.
Jardell wore the  completely dried hide about his waist,  a feature of
the ritual for  which he was thankful  for, as it helped  him hide his
display of anticipation.
    At the  start of  their trek the  sun was still  high in  the sky,
but going  around the camp to  an area roughly the  same distance from
it as the old  cave took a long time and when  they finally arrived at
the Shakka, the sun  was just an hour away from  setting. There was no
breeze,  and the  Shakka's huge  stationary form  sent a  shudder down
even  the most  expert user's  spine. It's  branches were  grotesquely
twisted arms  that reached out  toward the boys in  blind desperation.
Even  though  they were  out  of  the  Shakka's mindlink  shadow,  the
unworldly creature  could still transmit empathic  emotions  to  them.
It was  hungry for their  life force,  that much was  obvious. Jardell
began  to think  of  the  stories told  by  the  elders about  Shakkas
devouring the  entire lifeforce of  a user while  he or she  was under
the Shakka's  influence. He shuddered:  Such stories were  merely used
to try  to scare them away  from the strange dreamlike  state that the
tree produced.
    They were to  meet Lenda when the sun fell  behind the horizon, so
they  sat atop  a nearby  rock  and wearily  gazed at  the Shakka.  "I
don't like  what I just felt  close to Shakka!" Rhun  said. The others
nodded in agreement, but Jardell thought differently.
    "Guys,"  he  said,  "we're  just  overwrought  with  anticipation,
that's all...  I don't  think there  will be a  problem. We  never had
one  with the  Shakka before,  I  don't see  why we  should now!"  The
group fell  into silent  thought which was  only interrupted  with the
spectacular  display  that  rippled  across the  clouds  covering  the
horizon: The  sun  was  dying and  spilling its  blood into  the white
cloud cover. They gazed  in awe  at the  spectacular display  and only
Jardell noticed that  the Shakka was moving. He  wordlessly pointed it
out  to Rhun.  The Shakka's  root system  seemed to  have disappeared,
leaving a system  of ten or so leg-like appendages.  It appeared to be
stretching it's newly found legs as it slowly  folded and straightened
them. The  other three now noticed  this odd display and  fear riddled
their  faces. Janten  was  the tallest  of the  Circle,  and also  the
first  to run  in fear,  the other  two followed  him, loudly  yelling
unintelligible phrases as  they raced back towards the  camp. Rhun had
tried to  stop them,  but gave  up when it  was apparent  that nothing
would change their minds at leaving the Shakka far behind.
    Both  Rhun  and Jardell  were  as  fearful  as they,  but  Jardell
thought of  Lenda who should  be arriving  soon, and Rhun  would never
have left  him in a dangerous  situation such as this.  They had heard
the  myth  of the  Rising  of  the Shakka,  but  neither  of them  had
believed it.  The myth  told of a  certain day of  each year  when one
Shakka  was allowed  to move  on to  another location;  the magic  was
invoked at  sunset and lasted  until dawn.  As this was  only possible
once a  year, the Shakkas made  certain that they could  pick the best
spot to  settle down again, and  many tales of horrible  violence upon
mortals were linked to the myth.
    "Look,  over there!  It's  Lenda!" Rhun  exclaimed  as he  pointed
towards a small moving  figure silhouetted  against  the horizon.  The
Shakka  shuddered   again,  producing   whistling  sounds   from  it's
branches whipping  through the  air. It whirled  around and  seemed to
gaze at Lenda  with invisible eyes. Then it made  it's way toward her,
slowly at  first, but  with ever increasing  speed. Jardell  jumped to
his feet, quickly  gathered his possessions and ran  behind the Shakka
as fast  as his  leg would  carry him.  Rhun was  right at  his heels,
panting loudly.  They made a wide  circle around the Shakka  which was
headed straight for Lenda.
    "Why doesn't  she stop? Can't she  see that it's coming  her way?"
panted Rhun.
    "Maybe  the  Shakka has  taken  her  mind into  control?"  Jardell
muttered. They  ran towards  Lenda, but  as they  passed close  to the
Shakka, they  realized that  this had  been a bad  move. Rhun  was the
first  to feel  the effects,  but as  they got  closer to  the Shakka,
Jardell was also beginning to feel the effects of the spell.
    "Run  back!" he  screamed  at  Rhun, just  in  time. Rhun  slowed,
blinked and  with a surge of  concentration broke free long  enough to
make it  out of  the Shakka's  Shadow. Panting,  the two  boys huddled
together and tried to decide the best plan of action.
    "It's best  if we just run  around it at a  great enough distance,
don't  you  think?"  Rhun  commented. "Otherwise,  it'll  get  to  her
before we  get help  or do  anything else."  Jardell agreed,  and they
made their  way around  the Shakka  at a safe  distance. When  the two
had  finally reached  Lenda,  she indeed  seemed to  be  in a  trance.
Jardell stood  in front of  her, breathing  hard, and called  her name
over and  over. Lenda gave  no response,  and Jardell had  a difficult
time trying  to stop her moving  even closer to the  rapidly advancing
Shakka. Jardell slapped  her face lightly, and for a  split second, it
seemed that  her eyes  cleared, but  then they  quickly took  on their
previous state.  Almost ready to panic,  Jardell picked up on  what he
had just  seen: Pain  seemed to  break the  spell. In  desperation, he
whipped out his  hunting knife  and  made a  short, clean  cut on  her
lower  arm,  trying  his  best  to  stay  away  from  any  areas  that
contained major  blood vessels. Her  eyes cleared instantly,  she gave
a  quick yell  and looked  at  Jardell questioningly.  He grabbed  her
unwounded arm and pulled her behind him as fast as possible.
    "Don't ask  questions, just run!"  He screamed  at the top  of his
lungs.  He noticed  that in  all the  confusion, the  Shakka had  come
within twenty paces of  them, and it was high time to  get out of it's
way.  Jardell,  Lenda  and  Rhun  darted to  the  right,  out  of  the
Shakka's path, and  this seemed to confuse it enough  for them to gain
some distance.
    They  stopped,   and  panting,   Jardell  tried  to   explain  the
situation to  Lenda. She  understood immediately what  had transpired,
and  told Jardell  and  Rhun of  a  short story  that  her father  had
related to her  some years back. It  seems that he, too,  was a Shakka
user in  his prime years, and  had come to  the local Shakka on  a day
like this.  He was  the only  one of the  group to  survive unscathed,
but he never related  to Lenda how he had made  his escape. She seemed
to  remember  him muttering  something  about  Rabbits, but  he  never
would tell her more.
    "Rabbits?"  Jardell  exclaimed.  Just  then,  the  Shakka  changed
direction  and was  heading toward  the  group once  again. "Come  on,
let's move!" Jardell yelled.
    "Rabbits!" he thought  to himself. It was too  obvious: The Shakka
seemed  to have  a limited  intelligence in  certain ways,  much as  a
predator had  when trying to chase  a rabbit. When rabbits  fled, they
would not  run in a  straight line, but  zig-zag their way  to safety.
This not only wore  the chasing foe down, but also  confused it to the
point where the chase seemed fruitless.
    "Come on... let's  go! Do exactly as I do!"  Jardell screamed, and
immediately  changed  his  direction  to the  left.  Lenda  and  Rhun,
astonished,  followed  his example.  The  Shakka  slowly realized  the
directional change,  and altered  it's direction  accordingly. Jardell
now changed to  the right and the other two  followed his example. The
Shakka  took even  longer  to  realize this  change and had moved away
quite a distance before it turned in the correct direction.
    "One more  should do it!"  Jardell exclaimed. Once the  Shakka was
on  their  tail  again,  he  suddenly ran  towards  it  in  an  almost
straight  line, veering  off  to  the left  at  the  last moment.  The
Shakka  didn't  even   notice  that  they  had  passed   it  and  were
successfully escaping its wrath behind  its back. It just  kept moving
forward, eventually  slowing down to  conserve resources. It  was well
on  its way  to a  new location,  having already  forgotten its  prey.
Jardell, Rhun  and Lenda  stopped running  when the  Shakka was  but a
tiny  speck  against  the  growing   dusk.  They  hugged  each  other,
exasperated, but happily  laughing, and after a short  rest started to
make their way back to the camp.

                              Seer's Doom
    The man  freely checked his sword  and knives to the  child at the
flap of  the garishly colored  tent before entering. The  dim interior
of a thelavran, or  seer's, tent was not a familiar  place to him, but
Baranya was  rumored to be  the best  forecaster alive, and  he wanted
to be sure, for his wife's sake.
    He knelt on  the cushions before the low table  and waited for the
thelavra to  appear. His  eye was caught  by the  many-faceted crystal
spheroid  on the  a black  velvet padded  stand in  the center  of the
table,  and so  he didn't  notice Baranya's  entrance. One  moment her
chair was empty and the next, she was sitting serenely before him.
    "Pose  your   question,"  she   said  without   preamble,  sliding
gradually into  her trance by  narrowing her eyes to  slits, breathing
shallowly,   and   concentrating   on  her   personal   thendera,   or
concentration point,  which was a  painted wood toy knife  her brother
had owned as a child.
    The man  said, "My wife wants  a child. But, she's  a small woman.
The healers  aren't sure that  she can safely  carry and bear  one. My
question:  If   my  wife  becomes   pregnant,  will  she   succeed  in
delivering it  safely, and will  it be...normal?" There was  a history
of  deformity in  his family,  and  that worried  him as  much as  his
wife's possible problems.
    The thelavra  began humming  softly, and closed  her eyes  in full
concentration, sinking  fully into  her trance. Presently,  she opened
them again, and, still humming, gazed deeply into her crystal.
    "I see...your  wife." Baranya  spoke slowly, humming  between, and
the  man had  to concentrate  in his  turn to  understand her.  "She's
pregnant. She's  delivering...a son...safely."  He breathed a  sigh of
relief.  "I  see...a   limit.  If...you...she  conceives  within...six
months, ...all will be...well with her...and the...child."
    Baranya  sat back,  a  slight frown  on her  face.  She shook  her
head, as if  unable to quite leave her trance,  and her eyes unglazed.
She looked at him, and asked, "Was that satisfactory?"
    "O, yes,  my lady. Thank  you, thank you  so much. Here,  for you,
and all your help."  He set three gold Stars on  the table. "Thank you
again." He stood, turned, and left, smiling.
    Baranya's frown  deepened as  the tent flap  closed. She  had seen
something  else,  but  she  knew  from  experience  never  to  give  a
customer  more  than  he  wanted.  Still,  she  was  curious,  so  she
breathed deeply,  re-entered her trance,  and stared into  her crystal
ball.  Her  frown deepened,  then  her  eyes  widened in  horror.  She
muttered, "No.  No! Stop!"  She stared  for a  few more  moments, then
she  screamed, "Gods,  NO!" and  slumped  in her  chair. She  breathed
once more, then died.

    The  man never  knew  what  he had  engendered.  The thelavra  had
looked into the future  a little too far, and seen  her own death, and
the result.  And, seeing her death  had brought it about,  just as she
had seen it -  slumping back in her chair and  expiring right then and
there.  But, such  were the  circumstances,  and her  power, that  her
psychic death-gasp  was transmitted throughout the  whole of Eastland,
setting up  a chain reaction  among all of  the mentally gifted  - the
so called magicians  - and, in forced empathy, killed  them, or burned
out their powers.
    Unknowing  of the  disaster foreseen,  the man  went home  to tell
his wife the good news. His son was delivered some months later.
    On the  man's son's  first birthday,  barbarians from  the Steppes
invaded  quietly. They  poured into  Eastland unnoticed,  and attacked
from  within. Their  conquest was  easy and  uncontrolled, due  to the
demise of most of the witches and wizards the year before.

                    Ceda the Executioner: Chapter 5
    The  day was  getting on  and there  was still  a long  way to  go
before he  was safe.  If the  Nuadrin had  made a  new gate  then they
were almost certainly watching for him.
    The  sun was  on  the  other side  of  the  mountains now  casting
shadow of Psom  far out into the wilderness past  the cliffs. Darkness
stretched as far  as the eye could  see, but in any  case, Ceda waited
for  the sun  to  go down  totally  and the  darkness  to be  complete
before he left the shelter of the cliff face.
    That night  he set  out. Being  on the east  of the  mountains, he
had  the moon  to guide  him,  but the  way was  dangerous. Trying  to
avoid roads  as much  as possible,  he tramped  on slowly,  being most
sparing with the remaining food that he had left.
    A couple  of hours march brought  him a newly made  crossroad. The
way South  undoubtedly led to  the Port  of Breanduin or  Naz'Clow and
the North,  it probably led up  the Cities of Pheeng'Am,  Bilfneuin or
past  the  Gate of  Ploughdom  to  the far  City  of  Naudsman on  the
borders of Old Grandydyr beyond the desert.
    The way  West led back  to the Cliffs of  Belos. East was  the way
that Ceda  went, though he  was not sure at  this point where  it led.
After a short  time, The dry atmosphere that hung  about the mountains
vanished and woods  sprang up all around. Soon the  road was deep into
a forest surrounded by the pleasant sound of birds.
    The  road was  now slow  and hard.  The road  climbed now  up some
unnamed hill and  twisted constantly. Soon all sense  of direction was
lost and  continuing meant  following the  road or  being lost  in the
endless wood.
    Then Ceda  heard footsteps coming up  the path in front  of him. A
great many  footsteps, 'around fifteen  of them', he  thought. 'Mayhap
they can tell me where I am.'
    They were  getting very close  when Ceda heard a  commanding voice
call out an  order in the common  tongue. "Halt! We hold  here for the
night! Beniza,  chain their feet and  bind their mouths. I  don't wish
to meet  any Bilfneuin Axemen.  Now! Any of  you filthy men  decide to
try anything  and I'll  personally cut your  fingers from  your hands.
We reach  the gate tomorrow."  The voice  was Nuadri. The  laughs that
followed were Orcish-- and the cries were Human.
    Ceda jumped into  the woods. His first thought  was escaping, then
remembering  the  fate of  the  men  that  reached the  mountains,  he
decided to  help them.  Taking a  long sip of  his wine,  and throwing
away  the last  skin, he  slipped into  the woods  and approached  the
camp under the cover of the trees and the darkness.
    Soon he  stood just outside  the camp. There were  indeed fifteen:
one Nuadri,  four Orcs  and ten  men. The sun  was just  crawling over
the trees in the  east when they had settled down and  the Orcs drew a
little into  the wood to  shield themselves from the  coming sunlight.
The Men were  bound in heavy chains  at their feet and  necks and were
anchored  to a  nearby tree  and  Nuadri slept  down the  road out  of
reach of the men.
    Ceda waited until  the sun was over the trees  shining down on the
company before  he moved. Then  taking his  trident in both  hands, he
crept forwards  and silently  killed the Nuadri.  Then walking  to the
trees the Orcs slept,  he killed all but one, then he  put his foot on
the Orcs chest and yelled.
    The  Orc and  the rest  of the  company awoke  with a  start. Ceda
lifted it  to its feet  and took its weapon  casting it away  onto the
road by  the Men. "Now,  Orc! tell me, what  is your business  on this
side of  the Gate  of Ploughdom?"  The Orc looked  at Ceda  in dismay,
then spat at him. The Orc died quickly.
    Then Ceda turned  to the dead Nuadri. A brief  search revealed the
keys to the chains that bound the Men. Then they all sat and talked.
    "I am Aroth of Leafholm, City in the Wood of Carne," said a man.
    "And I am Ceda of No-Al Ben"
    "Thank  you  for your  kind  service.  My  men  and I  were  taken
prisoner of the  Nuadrin some three days ago," said  the man before he
was cut off by Ceda.
    "Nuadrin? How came you by that name?"
    "The  Beast  you killed  there,  it  is  called  by our  people  a
Nuadri," replied Aroth.  "So have we decided after none  of the elders
could find  any text with description  or word of them.  We have never
seen them before."
    "Nor  have I,"  said Ceda.  "But  I also  have come  to call  them
Nuadrin though I know  not why. I thought of such a  name in folly for
I could  not remember  ever meeting  such an odd  creature as  this in
all my  travels. But let  us come to this  later, first we  must leave
the road,  for there are  many of these  Nuadrin about now,  they have
hewn a new gate from the mountain of Psom."
    "Aye, and from Dearn.  But this is old news. We  shall speak of it
later when we reach Leafholm. It is six hours stride from here."
    "Nay!"  cried Ceda.  "I'll  not  travel the  roads  now! they  are
infested with the vile Nuadrin!"
    Aroth laughed.  "We are native  to this  wood, Ceda of  No-Al Ben.
We need not contend  with The Orcs new masters! We  know the wood like
as well as the Elves of Carne. You need not fear!"
    Then he  leapt to his  feet an bounded  into the wood  followed by
the rest  of the  men. Ceda went  to the Corpse  of the  Nuadri leader
and  took a  skin  of liquid  that  was  tied to  its  waist. Then  he
followed into the woods after the men who were singing a merry song.

                         Carne! the merry wood
                           We return to Thee
                              Coming home.

                        Carne! where all is good
                            As we enter Thee
                              coming home.

                    Leafholm, the City in the Trees
                      Where all is well and good!
                       From the Days of Old when
                      Elves wrought gold and ruled
                          The kingdoms untold.
                         Then came to Leafholm.

                     And Leafholm! I return to thee
                           In bliss and glee
                       And smell the sweet nectar
                          That flows in Thee!

                              Coming home!

                         Strong wind and rain,
                          And Tainian's Bain,
                       And all the Ice of Plime;
                         Nor Orcs or Barnonoen
                          Or Dragons of Khuss
                         Shall keep me from my
                           Beloved Leafholm!

                              Coming home!

                           The air is sweet!
                           The food a treat!
                              All is right
                              In Leafholm!

                         Carne! love me please!
                     Let me live under your leaves!

                        Carne! I return to you!

                              I come home!
                            And rest I shall
                              In Leafholm!

                              Coming home!

    And so  they sang  as they  bounded through  the forest  as though
they were  in an empty  field hindered not by  the trees of  the hills
that they passed. At  times they had to wait for Ceda  who had a great
deal of trouble keeping up with them.
    Finally, after  some hours march, they  came to a large  wall that
stretched into  the trees in either  direction. The wall was  as green
as the trees  themselves and they turned and followed  it for a little
while until they came upon a great gate.
    Upon the  gate were many Elves  cloaked in dark green  robes drawn
tightly about their heads.  In each ones hand was a a  long bow and on
their  sides rested  long knifes.  Seeing  Aroth, the  gate was  drawn
open and they all entered.
    "Do the  Elves of  Carne and the  men of Carne  dwell in  the same
city?" asked Ceda as the gate was closed behind them.
    "Nay," said Aroth. "There are no men of Carne."
    Ceda stopped  short. He looked  up and down at  the row of  Men he
had entered  with. All appeared to  be human. Then he  looked sidelong
at Aroth who stood smiling at him.
    "Ceda of  No-Al Ben,"  he said.  "We are not  Men, but  are Elves.
Come, we  will hold  now a  council with  the King,  and you  shall be
there  to tell  of your  ordeal. There  you shall  learn all  that you
wish to know.
    Ceda was  led up many streets  until they reached the  gate to the
palace of  the city. The walls  were made of a  strange silken thread,
which Ceda  commented on and  was told  that its properties  were that
of the strongest metal and the thickest rock yet inclimbable.
    All over  the city as  Ceda passed,  trees towered over  his head,
their tops  disappearing into the  clouds above. Green  leaves covered
the paths  (in Elven tree cities,  there were no set  roads to disrupt
the natural  area, but  paths were  maintained for  convenience) never
dying, and the soft singing of birds was never absent.
    Inside the great  walls of the palace, a great  ring of pine trees
acted as  a palace wall,  which was  only enterable through  the Gate.
The  trees were  much larger  then all  the others  and even  as their
mighty trunks rose into the clouds above, they gave no hint of ending.
    Into the  tree gate they  went and  discovered a large  stair. The
stair went both  up and down, they went down.  Torches lined the walls
and which were delicately carved out of the dirt among the roots.
    Finally after  a long descent, they  came to a large  door guarded
by  four Elves.  The doors  were  made of  an odd  yellow metal  which
lighted the passage. Ceda was told to leave his weapons and enter.
    The hall  that he had  entered was like none  he had ever  seen or
even heard the likes  of in any tale. The walls  and ceiling were that
of the  living tree  root of  the magnificent trees  that grew  in the
Palace  Ring.   They  were   nicely  cleaned   and  polished   to  the
magnificent  color of  orange  which Ceda  guessed  was their  natural
color.  The floor  was of  the same  yellow metal  that the  doors had
been made  from. The  room was full  of Elves the  like of  which Ceda
had never seen  before. They were dressed in many  different shades of
green, their  hair was and well  groomed (mostly in braids)  and their
faces were  stern but gentle. They  welcomed Aroth and turned  to Ceda
as he and his men left the chamber.
    "Welcome," said  one of  the larger Elves  coming forward.  He was
well dressed in  a light green robe  and wore a helm  of orange leaves
about his  head. "I  am the Lord  of Leafholm. Rakine  I am  called by
most of my Elves; Rakine of Leafholm. What is thy name, Sir?"
    "Ceda of No-Al Ben," replayed Ceda.
    There  was  some muffled  talking  around  the room.  Then  Rakine
spoke. "The  finder of the Crown  has come to us!  Welcome again, Ceda
of No-Al Ben. Tell  us your tale and then ask us what  you will, for I
see great  concern in your eyes."  He signaled and chairs  and a great
table were brought forth.
    Ceda sat  at the middle  of the long  table. Elves were  all about
him,  but they  were  silent  and Ceda  spoke.  "When  the winter  had
passed, I was hired  and left for the city of  Caffthorn. Then, as the
sun rises and  the moon sets, it  was ten days and three  when I found
the Tree of Grobst and came upon the Crown."
    "Aye," said Rakine.  "This we know. We have been  in close contact
with Rackins, for he is my brother, and we hide nothing."
    Ceda stared  at Rakine for  a moment  and then continued.  "Then I
will  start   from  the   time  that   Cander  of   Perstanie  reached
Cramstrock.  It was  ere two  months that  he came  to me,  and I  was
drunk and could  not talk. He took me  like a dog onto a  horse and we
rode  for Dhernis  stopping  in  Caahah. It  was  only  there that  he
counseled me that we made for the City of the Elves.
    "Upon leaving, about  four days ride from Dhernis  on swift horse,
we  went astray  by my  leave  to the  Gate  of Ploughdom,  for I  had
misgivings about  the Dark Doorway,  though I know not  why. Methought
it best to check and see lest there be something afoot.
    "You dared  to approach the  Dark Gate in  times of war?  and what
of Cander,  we knew  not that he  had reached you!  where is  he now?"
said Rakine.
    "Cander,"  said  Ceda slowly.  "Met  his  end  in the  Caverns  of
Onibus, but what is this talk of war?"
    There was more  quiet talking in the room and  Rakine looked to an
Elf at  his side  and spoke  a few  words. The  Elf answered  and then
Rakine continued and the room grew silent.
    "The  Mouths of  Arnmere and  the  Gates of  Ploughdom, Dearn  and
Psom have been  spewing forth their vile laborers in  war for nigh two
and  a half  months!" said  Rakine. Caffthorn,  Ruirse, No-Al  Ben and
all the  little countries  of the  East, North and  West have  been in
violent struggles  to defeat their might,  but as yet they  are strong
and well armed. And they have with them the Nuadrin to command them."
    "Aye,"  said Ceda.  "I know  of them,  though I  do not  yet fully
understand them. I had  no name for them, and in folly  did I begin to
call them  Nuadrin, for  I had naught  else to refer  to them  as, and
yet you use the name as do I, yet none have heard me speak it."
    "They are to us  a nameless people, not in song  or story, but yet
they are here, and  we call them now the Nuadrin for  we also have but
naught else to call them but must speak of their deeds. Continue."
    "After  seven  suns   had  passed  since  we   had  departed  from
Cramstrock,  we  were  taken  prisoner by  Nuadrin  not  fifty  dragon
lengths from  the Gate!  I know not  of anything else  but that  I lay
for sometime  in a  dark room bound  in chains at  my feet  and hands.
Then I  was led before  a large beast that  bore like to  the Nuadrin,
but was bigger  and stronger. He was  the ruler, and he  mocked me and
smote Cander, and that was the last that I saw of him.
    "After a  while in my cage  I escaped and  found my way to  a pass
in Psom  and learned  of the new  gate. There I  fought with  a Nuadri
and some  of its pet  Orcs and found this:"  he reached into  his pack
and retrieved the medallion with the crown on it.
    "Aye, we have seen many of the like," Said Rakine.
    Ceda returned the  medallion to his pouch and went  on. "There was
one other  matter of the  mountains that  troubles my thought:  on the
night that I had  escaped from the pursuit of the Orcs,  I came upon a
place that was  barren of life. Naught  lived there, it was  as if all
creatures were  dead and  gone save  the trees and  plants. It  was to
that place that the Orcs from Onibus did not follow me as I fled."
    "Aye, there  are places in the  mountains that even the  Orcs will
not  tread. You  were lucky  that you  found not  what did  live there
I'll wager."
    "It is  there that I  slept. When I  awoke, I journeyed  down into
the valley below and  there I found a camp of the  enemy. They did not
spy me  though I sat  and watched them for  a time. There  they burned
men and made many weapons in ready for war.
    "I sat until the  sun fell and then I circled  the camp making for
pass in Psom. And it is there that I first discovered the new Gate.
    "I  fled  Orcs  over  the   pass  killing  some  and  gaining  the
medallion and  traveled down  the other  side of  the mountain  to the
Cliffs of Belos and then found a way down the following day."
    "You  found way  down the  cliffs with  naught but  what you  have
now, or  did your  luck provide  you with  rope from  one of  the dead
Orcs?" asked one of the Elves that sat at the table.
    "Luck it  was, but not with  rope," he answered. "Down  the cliffs
edge Southward  I walked until  I came to a  crack in the  cliffs edge
that descended  until the ground. That  was the night that  it rained.
Almost half  way down I  came upon a cave  and rested there  until the
following day.
    "When  I came  down the  mountain  the following  day, I  traveled
East  until I  came so  Carne and  met your  men in  the hands  of the
Enemy. They led me here, and that is my tale."
    Rakine sat  for a  while in  thought until  a another  elf entered
the room. And Ceda  stared at him in wonder, for it  was Aroth, yet he
was  no longer  a human,  but  an elf;  the  face was  the same,  with
perhaps a  more smooth look, or  perhaps his eyes were  more stretched
and thin,  but this  was Aroth,  and anyone could  see that.  He bowed
low before  the king and  took a  place at the  far side of  the table
with a nod to Ceda.
    "Well," said  the King at last.  "We must send word  to Rackins at
once. Ceda,  it is  upon you  to accompany  them to  the fair  city of
Perstanie in the  Learis Islands. This time, however, I  hope that you
shall  go there  without  any short  side trips.  Go  now directly  to
Dhernis, and take the Ships of Tearny by my order to  the Captain.
    "With him  we shall need to  send escort. Aroth, go  with him, and
take whoever you would  with you, but make haste! It  is nigh one year
since  he was  sent for,  and we  have as  yet heard  nothing from  my
brother in  forty suns  and forty  moons. Go now,  and may  your speed
compete with the raven!

                   'uentu descern shyen svequ seju!'"

    "We  shall leave  at first  light,  cousin" said  Aroth to  Rakine
with a nod to Ceda.
    "Nay,"  said  Rakine.  "First  we  wait  for  word  from  Rackins,
messengers  have already  been sent  telling  of his  arrival. As  for
now, go and make yourselves ready, for you leave within the week."
    With that final word, Ceda and Aroth got up and left the room.
    "Cousin?" asked Ceda as they walked down the hall.
    "Yes."
    Aroth led Ceda to  a room where he was to rest  and before long he
was  sound asleep  on one  of the  most comfortable  beds that  he had
ever slept on.
    It was  a week and  three days before they  had left. No  word had
come from Perstanie  and time was ever fleeting. Ceda  lay on his bed,
thoughts drifted though his mind and slowly he fell into a slumber.
    It  felt like  he had  hardly closed  his eyes  before Aroth  once
again stood before  the foot of his  bed, clad in a  dark green riding
cape with a  hood and light riding  boots; and it was  not long before
they were  on tall horses  riding for the  city gate. Aroth  seemed of
good cheer  and was  full of  energy as  was Ceda  who was  once again
under way to the beautiful City of the Elves on Cergaan.
    Before the  sun was in center  sky they were deep  into Carne many
leagues from  Leafholm. The light  could just barely seep  through the
leaves of the  treetops high above their heads  bringing small showers
of blissful  illumination to  the undergrowth  and small  animals that
bathed in the  tranquility. On the look-out for Orcs  and Nuadri, they
continued onward,  but met none.  And by  nightfall, they were  a days
ride from the border of the forest.
    They pulled  off the road about  a hundred yards and  set up their
camp. The horses  were put on watch  while they set up.  Then they sat
down  to  have  a meal  of  some  cakes  that  they had  brought  from
Leafholm along with some fresh water from a near-by stream.
    The pleasantness lasted  during the night and at  length both Ceda
and Aroth were deep in slumber while the horses watched over the camp.
    At first  light they awoke and  packed up their gear  for the days
ride.  The red  pinnacles of  light  were barely  visible through  the
branches above  stemming over the  early morning  sky and the  air was
rich with the  soft sounds of birds. Reluctantly they  stowed the last
of their things, had some berries and started for the borders.
    The  second morning  since they  had left  Leafholm was  peaceful.
Although they  were in a hurry,  they could not ride  though the great
Forest of  Carne without slowing  to wonder  at the somber  trees that
stood  so noble  in  their  path. Soon  they  took  to walking,  first
quickly, then slower and finally barely moving up the path at all.
    After a few hours  the sun was over head and  they stopped to have
a meal  in a  small patch  of sunlight that  managed to  sneak through
the upper  branches of a  tall tree and form  a large circle  of light
on the ground near  its trunk. They took a few  cakes from their packs
and sat  down to eat when  they first heard the  noise; hoofs, running
at great speed up the road from the direction they were headed.
    "Arnea seek Duval!  We were not careful! They will  see the horses
and will know we  are here," cried Aroth as he leapt  to his feet. "We
shall  perish from  this folly  of  ours!" He  ran to  the horses  and
pulled their reins jolting them off the road in a frenzy.
    Ceda also  got up,  but not  as hastily. "I  think not,  Orcs ride
not on steeds of any kind."
    "True, but can the Nuadri ride?"
    "I know  not, but  it is too  late do debate,  alas they  are upon
us!" He  through back  his long  hair and reached  for his  sword that
hung loosely at  his side. At that moment the  riders came into sight,
and Aroth relaxed for they were Elves.
    "Hail!" shouted the foremost rider seeing Aroth. "Greetings."
    "Hail," answered  Aroth with a  long sigh  of relief. "I  am Aroth
of Leafholm, cousin  to Rakine the King. We seek  knowledge of the way
up ahead by the forest gate, is it save to travel?"
    "Aye, we have seen and heard naught for a days ride, it is safe."
    "Good, and what is your business? Are you messengers?" said Aroth.
    "Yes,  we travel  with message  from Rackins.  Pardon me,  but are
you Ceda, for our message is for you be you he."
    "Ah!"  said  Ceda with  satisfaction.  "Rackins  has word  of  our
arrival then! What were his words?!"
    "He spoke  not as  much as Merth.  They want you  to ride  for the
Caves of Arnmere  and seek what lies  there, thou I know  not what. He
said you would know about what he speaks," said the rider.
    "The Caves?  Is that  old fool  wizard in  his right  mind?" cried
Aroth.  "Even in  times  of peace  I would  not  venture within  fifty
leagues of the hideous Caves!"
    "Aye," said Ceda. "I know of what he speaks."
    With  a  glance  from  Ceda,  Aroth bid  the  riders  continue  to
Leafholm and inform Rakine of their new destination.
    In a  spring the horses had  drawn away bearing the  riders onward
and were  soon out  of sight.  "To Arnmere?" asked  Aroth with  a lump
welling in his thought.
    "Aye," said  Ceda with the same  feeling of dread. "I  know what I
must do. Come if you will, but I force you not."
    "I will  come, for  only a  coward would  leave you,  and I  am of
noble blood!"  he said thrusting his  fist into the air  revealing the
pitch black ring that encircled his forth finger.
    "Then let us ride at once!" shouted Ceda with a smile.
    They finished what  remained of their meal and  stowed their gear.
Then mounting  the horses  they sped  down the road  and out  of sight
into the distance with swiftness of the eagle.

                                 Idol
 My father was                           a mercen'ry:
 For our upkeep                          he sold his sword.
 His fame was sung                       throughout the land,
 And told to us                          by Mother's word.

 We saw him little                       in early years,
 As across our land                      in war he went
 Leading some                            and killing others,
 And always money                        home was sent.

 Then he left home                       to fight foreign wars
 When I was but                          a decade old.
 Yet we looked up                        to the image he left
                 In the tales my mother told.

 Without a father                        we grew up,
 But our mother                          raised us right
 With tales of Father's                  glorious deeds
 That made us all                        eager to fight.

 And though we were not                  swordsman each
 A model was                             his courage still.
 And we learned pride                    in all to take
 Even if                                 'twas only to kill.

 And he left home                        to fight foreign wars
 When I was but                          a decade old.
 Yet we looked up                        to the image he left
                 In the tales my mother told.

 Another tenyear                         he'd been gone
 When word of him                        fin'ly came back:
 He'd died in battle,                    brave and true,
 To hold his flag                        against attack.

 That had occured                        some two years past
 When we began                           bad things to hear.
 A saint he was not,                     and no one is;
 But the wrong he did                    was not ours to bear.

 And he left home                        to fight foreign wars
 When I was but                          a decade old.
 Yet we looked up                        to the image he left
                 In the tales my mother told.

 Ten more years                          had passed me by;
 Years I'd lived                         both full and well,
 And for myself                          because I knew
 No good would survive me                after I fell.

 For Father's life                       was oft in my mind
 And the tales that grew                 after he'd died
 Spreading the wrong,                    forgetting the right:
 Leaving me                              no need for pride.

 And he left home                        to fight foreign wars
 When I was but                          a decade old.
 And the Idol created                    by Mother's words
 Died by the tales                       that others told.
