    Well, folks, again  I find myself apologizing for  the lateness of
this  issue. Unfortuantely  I  have been  busy with  my  new job.  For
those of you who  are not already aware, I now have  a new id, LISCOMB
at MAINE,  as well as  NMCS025. Should  NMCS025 be unavailable,  I may
be reached  at LISCOMB, but  for the  time being FSFnet  will continue
to be sent from  NMCS025. Other news is that the  most recent issue of
FSFnet  can  be  found  on  CSNEWS  at  MAINE's  ComDisk  and  can  be
requested using TELL CSNEWS AT MAINE SENDME FSFNET VOLxNxx FROM COMDISK.
    Also in  the works is a  new project for all  people interested in
writing amateur  fantasy fiction. A  group of FSFnet  contributors and
myself have  begun a  writers' workshop very  similar in  structure to
the  Thieves'  World project  undertaken  by  Robert Aspirin.  Several
authors have  begun developing  characters and  stories, all  based in
an  area known  as Dargon.  FSFnet  VOL4N01 should  contain the  first
written  results of  this  project,  and will  be  in  your reader  in
mid-January. If any  of you budding authors are  interested in joining
the effort, send me a mail file and I'll be glad to fill you in.
    Unfortunately, there is  no Narret Chronicle in this  issue due to
the fact  that I  cannot get  in touch with  the author.  Hopefully we
will get Narret back before volume 4 starts.
    Finally,  I'd  like  to  remind  you all  that  it's  the  holiday
season, and  everyone's got  a new book  out. New  McCaffrey, Anthony,
Tolkien,  Adams, Daley,  Asimov,  Stasheff, and  anyone  else you  can
think  of. No  time  to review  them  all right  now.  Next issue  the
Acquisition  will  continue,  and  I'll  review  M.A.R.  Barker's  new
Tekumel  book, Flamesong,  and, if  I  get it  read, Norman  Spinrad's
Star Spangled Future. Until then!

                            THE ACQUISITION
                           Part Two: The Forest
    Beyond the short  expanse of cultivated fields,  the two travelers
soon  crossed the  boundary  of  scrub that  marked  the  edge of  the
forest.  At first,  the  woods were  characterized  by light  beeches,
birches and poplars.  The leaves of the poplars were  waxy and rustled
crisply in the soft breeze.
    Banewood recalled his  early childhood when he  would venture into
the light woods  in search of edible mushrooms, a  favored delicacy of
the  local people.  With his  sharp  and experienced  vision he  could
still pick  out his  favorites protruding  through the  fallen leaves.
It was  here, while  gathering mushrooms that  Banewood heard  many of
the childhood  tales and legends passed  to him by his  parents: tales
of the  Ludki, those mischievous  little people who lived  deep within
the  forest and  tales of  Lessy, the  Silvan Lord,  who made  strange
animal sounds  and led lost  children astray. Banewood  remembered how
his father  would then  make animal  sounds and  frighten him  for the
rest of  the day. Stories  of Baba  Yaga, embellished over  the years,
would cause  tears of fright  to well  up into young  Banewood's eyes.
Now, years  older, Banewood still felt  the burning in his  face as he
realized that Baba Yaga  might be real and that he  might meet face to
face with the blistering eyes of Kathryn.
    As  the  two  journeyed  onward,   the  character  of  the  forest
changed.  Dark  oaks and  towering  elms  now  lined their  path.  The
leaves  of years  lay  upon  the ground,  crackling  with every  step.
Animal sounds diminished.
    Banewood and  Sod picked their  way uphill, climbing  an overgrown
path  which led  to an  uncertain fate.  Throughout the  day, Banewood
and  Sod  walked  the  leagues of  dark  forest,  constantly  catching
cobwebs  in  the face  and  beleaguered  by blood-thirsty  deer  flies
scenting their first human.
    At the  top of  the rise,  the two travelers  paused to  rest. Sod
sat still  in the hope  of delivering a  killing blow to  the ravenous
deer fly which had doggedly followed him during most of the climb.
    "I  think we  should make  our  first camp  here," said  Banewood.
"We're  on  the  nearest  hilltop  and we'll  have  ample  warning  of
anything approaching."
    "Gotcha!"  Sod finally  killed the  deer fly  which had  settle in
his hair  for a  fateful supper.  Sod picked  the scrawny  insect from
his hair. "If we  build a smoldering fire we might be  able to spend a
night without these  cursed flies." Sod gathered some  dead twigs that
still hung  on the  tree. After arranging  them carefully,  he reached
into his  bag and brought  out his flint  and steel. Within  minutes a
small fire  was being tended.  Banewood walked the perimeter  of their
encampment and  stopped occasionally  to pick  at some  plants growing
scattered on the ground. He returned and gave them to Sod.
    "Here, use these  on the fire. They'll keep away  the flies better
than the smoke."
    "Thank  you," said  Sod.  He  threw them  on  the  small fire  and
whiffed the  fragrant aroma created  by the consumed leaves.  "How did
you  learn so  much  about herbs?"  asked Sod,  who  already knew  the
answer. He was fighting his nervousness with small talk.
    "Most  of  what I  know  comes  from  the Shaman,"  said  Banewood
obligingly. "Now I  have to learn from his books,  but the details are
really  meager.  Most  of  the  Shaman's knowledge  was  in  his  vast
memory. He  said that  certain books  did exist.  The Shaman  said the
books were dangerous because they could fall into the wrong hands."
    Banewood and  Sod ate  a meal  of wafer bread  and dried  meat and
then slept  lightly upon cushions of  leaves and boughs laid  upon the
ground.  Shallow holes  were dug  out  to provide  recesses for  their
hips.  Smoldering coals  kept away  the night  flies, but  they didn't
ward off Banewood's evil dreams; the crimson eyes still haunted him.
Dawn came with the cry of a horned owl.
    The  dying   coals  were   fed  a   breakfast  of   fresh  tinder.
Hard-boiled eggs  and a little herb  tea saw the worried  travelers on
their  way. Revitalized  by the  rest, Banewood  and Sod  trekked down
the  slope,  meandering  ever  deeper   into  the  dark  forest.  Soon
Banewood's sharp eye  caught the first impression of  the large cloven
hoofs that  were to show  them the way. The  tracks were too  large to
belong  to  anything  else  except Kathryn.  Broken  branches  and  an
uprooted tree lent  credence to the supposition. To  Sod's relief, the
tracks were fairly old.
    Sod fretted  about his  decision to hunt  the sow.  The mysterious
sword  whose hilt  he often  fondled didn't  seem like  a weapon  that
could stop  a charging sow.  Funny how he thought  that if he  set his
mind to  killing Kathryn,  he would find  a way. Could  they do  it by
craft and  artifice? Maybe  by setting  up a dead  fall or  some other
booby  trap? Funnier  still  was the  feeling that  it  was the  sword
which seemed  to whisper that,  given the  resolve, Sod would  be able
to meet the challenge.
    Banewood and  Sod journeyed down the  slope, up the next  hill and
down another  slope. Leagues passed  beneath their feet.  They skipped
lunch  and  walked  under  the  power of  their  stored  energy.  They
continued  on slight  paths  which joined  and  separated through  the
forest. Occasionally,  Sod would  stop to  mark a  tree at  eye level,
entertaining the  hope that they  would somehow return by  this route.
Banewood now  walked with  his bow  in hand,  ever keeping  a watchful
eye on the path behind them.
    The  Shaman's longbow  proved  its  value later  in  the day  when
Banewood knocked  down a squirrel  with a special  blunt-tipped arrow.
They  carried  the  black  squirrel  with  them  after  quickly  field
dressing it.  The little tree rat,  as Banewood called it,  had set up
a  frightful  chattering  before  it  met  its  final  doom.  Sod  and
Banewood both agreed that  it would be a good idea  to cover some more
distance before  feasting on the tree  rat. There was no  telling what
attention was  called by  the noisy animal  and, besides,  they didn't
want to prepare the tree rat until they were ready to make camp.
    The  two journeymen  walked with  greater care  after killing  the
squirrel. Banewood  regretted his slaying  of the little tree  rat. He
now had  the uneasy feeling  that the  forest knew of  their presence,
that they were  somehow being watched. Sod  sensed Banewood's distress
or maybe  he, too,  felt the  paranoia. He tightened  his grip  on the
sword.  Banewood  now  walked  with   an  arrow  nocked.  His  fingers
whitened from their tight grip.
    Every  minute sound  that the  two seekers  made was  amplified by
the forest. Once,  when Banewood turned quickly around,  he thought he
noticed  a pair  of amber  eyes  watching them,  but they  disappeared
quickly  and he  was  no  longer sure.  Tension  increased with  every
step. Both travelers  began to perspire. Suddenly, the  explosion of a
dry  twig  snapping   sent  Banewood  and  Sod   into  a  back-to-back
position, their weapons  drawn and poised. An  electric tension pulsed
within them, begging to surge, asking for release. But nothing happened.
    No   other  sound   was   heard  throughout   the  forest.   After
excruciating  minutes of  silence, Banewood  and Sod  voted to  resume
their  walk. Several  more hours  of travel  brought them  to a  small
stream in  the forest. The  water looked wholesome, affording  the two
an opportunity to  refill their flasks and to bathe.  This looked like
the  ideal  place  to  pitch   camp  and  prepare  a  welcome  supper.
Banewood's tree  rat no longer  looked as appetizing; however,  it was
the best  food that  they had.  Throughout the  meal and  respite they
remained watchful, for the penetrating silence of the forest remained.
    Evening  had settled  rapidly.  Sod and  Banewood  ate near  their
fire,  slowly finishing  their meal  and conversing.  The fire  cast a
bright  glow  around the  immediate  circumference,  but outside,  the
darkness was forbidding. Sod thought again about his quest.
    "If  I  hadn't found  this  sword,  I  probably would  never  have
attempted  such a  foolish  venture," Sod  thought  to himself.  "This
fine looking  weapon is of  too fine  a quality for  a man like  me. I
wonder if I shouldn't give it to someone worthy of possessing such a weapon."
    Aloud,  Sod said  "We've  been in  this forest  for  two days.  It
doesn't appear to hold the danger I had anticipated."
    "The  danger lies  in  our laxness  if we  trust  in our  safety,"
replied  Banewood,  parrying  Sod's  wishful thought.  "Tonight  I  am
sleeping with my bow in hand."
    Speaking the  unspoken, Sod  said "Then you  also feel  like we've
been watched?"
    "Ya,"  replied Banewood.  "I  thought I  saw it  once,  a pair  of
eyes. I've learned to trust my intuition."
    Tensing and grabbing  for his sword, Sod said  "Your intuition was
right!  Look!  Out  there,  see  those eyes?  I  don't  think  they're
friendly." Sod pointed in the direction of the creek.
    They both stood  up and moved around the fire,  placing it between
themselves  and  the  presence.  The  same  amber  eyes  Banewood  had
thought  he'd  seen earlier  were  slowly  reeling toward  them.  When
their distance from the  eyes was cut in half, Sod  threw an armful of
dry tinder upon the fire and threw extra light out into the night.
    "It's a wolf." Whispered Banewood.
    "It's too  big." Answered Sod, who  was beginning to quake  in his
boots. His sweaty  fingers grasped the sword tighter. "How  am I going
to kill the  wolf if it attacks?" he thought,  questioning his ability
to wield the sword.
    A deep,  gutteral growl emanated  from the large  slavering beast.
It crept forward  with its belly low  to the ground, ready  to leap at
the instant. Sod raised his sword slightly and then cried out.
    "Oh no!"
    In the  same instant  that the fell  beast launched  itself toward
them, Sod's  sword slipped out of  his hand and dropped  to the ground
at  a distance.  The  lunging  hulk darkened  his  view.  Sod heard  a
snapping chord like  the sound of his heart breaking.  The wind rushed
past his left ear.
    In a  massive thud,  a large  wolf, larger than  any Sod  had ever
seen or  heard of before,  fell at his side.  Its eyes were  wide open
and  its lips  were curled  in a  hideous grimace.  A feathered  shaft
protruded from its throat.
    Banewood's hand rested on Sod's shoulder. "Are you okay?" he asked.
    "You  killed him.  I  thought I  was  going to  die  and, just  as
suddenly, this wolf  is dead instead. You've saved my  life. How can I
repay you?"
    "Don't worry; it  all comes out in the wash.  But what happened at
the last second? Why did you drop your sword?"
    "I don't know...  I guess my mind went blank.  The sword seemed to
slip from my  hands," said Sod. "I've  never seen such a  fine shot. I
think the wolf was dead before it hit the ground!"
    "I've tipped  some of my  arrows with  the juice of  the aconitum;
it is a deadly poison."
    "With such a weapon as yours, you could single-handedly slay Kathryn!"
    "It won't work. I've already tried," answered Banewood.
    Sod  was taken  aback by  this.  "There's certainly  more to  this
Shaman than meets the eye," he thought. Aloud, "When did you try that?"
    "On the last  night that Kathryn attacked I hid  myself and loosed
my best arrow against her. It shattered as if it had hit a rock."
    Sod was  incredulous. "How are  we ever going  to stop her  if she
is as you say?"
    "I don't know. We'll think of something."
    "Ya," Sod said without sincerity.
    The wolf  was enormous,  but Banewood  and Sod,  after endeavoring
for the better  part of an hour,  managed to drag the  beast away from
the camp.  The two found no  difficulty in dropping off  to sleep, for
though the forest was still dangerous, it now possessed one less threat.
    Dawn came  without a sound.  Banewood and Sod  got up and  fed the
fire and  went to  the creek for  water. On the  way, they  looked for
the wolf, but it  was gone! They searched around the  area in the hope
that  they were  disoriented last  night  when they  dragged the  wolf
out. It  was gone. Now  a very real fear  possessed them; it  may have
been Baba  Yaga. How  else can  a dead  animal disappear?  Sod's empty
stomach felt like it held a rock.
    Suddenly,  through   the  trees,  they  heard   a  musical  voice.
Banewood and Sod  quickly reached for their weapons.  Through the tall
trees they could  see an approaching figure. It was  gaily dressed and
wore a tall, pointed hat with a feather in its band. It sang:

                            "Hey ho, hey ho,
                      the wolk's a dead you know.
                         for if it ain't a dead
                          then I'm a not alive
                       and I know I'd better go!"

    The  two stood  with their  mouths open.  Marching straight  up to
them was a  short person, a very little person,  with large round eyes
and a pudgy little nose.
    "Hello, hello, my name is Stickleburr unless I'm not, of course."
    Sod and  Banewood found themselves  face to  face with one  of the
Ludki. The childhood descriptions were indeed accurate. He looked so odd!
    "I want  to thank you for  killing the great wolk  because he's no
longer alive.  He has been plaguing  my people for years,  but not for
years to  come. Anyway, they're not  really my people, they  are their
own people, but I guess you wouldn't call us people, would you?"
    Banewood  spoke:  "I...I  thought  that the  wolf,  I  mean  wolk,
wasn't dead, that maybe it was really Baba Yaga."
    Stickleburr jumped.  "Oh, no! I  mean yes,  it was really  a wolk.
It's  certainly dead  now, isn't  it? You  two are  heroes, unless  of
course you  don't think so. So  that's the wolksmert, isn't  it?" Said
Stickleburr pointing to Sod's strange sword.
    "Wolksmert?"  Replied Sod.  "Oh,  yes. Certainly."  He laughed  at
the irony, because "wolksmert" meant "wolfslayer" in the eastern tongue.
    "Yes,  most certainly,"  laughed  Stickleburr. "You  two can  come
with me  unless you  can't. We  want to thank  you properly,  and it's
not proper to thank you here."
    Banewood and  Sod agreed  to follow  the Ludki  back to  his home.
They  quickly   broke  camp   and  gathered  their   belongings.  They
whispered  and laughed  among  themselves, marvelling  at the  strange
speech  pattern of  Stickleburr: Ludki  always followed  the assertion
of a  positive statement  with it's  negative. It  was a  most curious
pattern of speech, but it wasn't curious at all to the Ludki.
    Within  a  half-hour,  the  three  came  in  sight  of  the  Ludki
village. It  was set in a  small dale cleared of  trees. Little houses
in the  shape of bee hives  lay haphazard about the  village. Wisps of
smoke curled  out of their tops.  The Ludki were fond  of smithing, as
was  evident from  the many  miniature iron  furnaces that  sent their
black  smoke up  over the  rooftops. The  Ludki village  had evidently
been  in this  location for  some time  because much  of the  area was
cleared of  the hardwood  trees essential for  the making  of charcoal
needed to smelt the iron.
    The  little people  walked  about in  gaily  colored clothes.  The
Ludki  men wore  high pointed  hats dressed  up with  bright feathers.
They were a  happy folk. The air  was full of whistling  and the songs
of their merriment.
    When  Stickleburr and  the two  travelers approached,  the village
folk poured out  to meet the heros. Stickleburr  began introducing his
family  and the  more prominent  of the  Ludki to  the strangers.  The
names  came   rapidly:  Milfoil,   Hyssop,  Lavender,   Mullien,  Five
Fingers, Violet, and,  well, you get the idea; they  were all names of
plants  that the  Ludki  were fond  of.  At the  bark  of orders  from
Stickleburr,  the  Ludki busied  themselves  with  preparations for  a
great  feast. The  men  set  up tables  and  stools,  built fires  and
brought out kegs  of mead. The Ludki women quickly  filled their ovens
with various  breads and foods  until the heavenly aroma  replaced the
acrid  smell   of  smelting  iron.   The  Ludki  loved   feasting  and
merriment,  and  this  occasion,  as   any  other,  was  an  excellent
opportunity  to lay  aside  their  work. The  fearful  wolk which  had
terrorized the  Ludki for so many  years was dead, slain  at the hands
of the tall folk and wolksmert.
    Among  the Ludki,  wolksmert  was the  center  of much  attention.
Their  large  eyes  beamed  with   admiration  and  the  little  hands
eagerly,  but reverently,  touched  the fine  metal.  From the  Ludki,
Banewood could  learn nothing  about the sword,  but by  their evident
joy at seeing it and the two travelers, the Ludki seemed strangely elated.
    Even  while  the  preparations  were  still  underway,  the  eager
little Ludki began  to celebrate with joyous  abandon. Musicians began
their tunes  and the mead was  passed around. And such  mead! Banewood
and Sod  both drank  and agreed  that it  was the  best they  had ever
tasted.  How  the Ludki  could  consume  so  much  of it  without  the
obvious signs of inebriation, they couldn't guess.
    During the  feast, Stickleburr talked  with the two  strangers and
learned the  reason for  their sojourn  into the  deep forest.  At the
news, Stickleburr balked but then regained his composure.
    "Oh yes, we  had most certainly believed that Baba  Yaga had died,
for we  had not  seen her  alive. And  Kathryn, oh  yes, we  had heard
whisperings  of her  rampages,  else  we were  deaf.  Kathryn is  Baba
Yaga? We most certainly hope she isn't!"
    "Yes, most certainly," agreed Banewood.
    Sod, careful  not to  spill a  drop of the  mead he  was drinking,
looked at Stickleburr  and asked, "Do you  know of the way  to the hut
of Baba Yaga?"
    Stickleburr replied  "No, no...well yes,  sort of. I know  the way
but I don't know  how to get there. It's a long  way off, although not
that  far to  someone as  long-legged as  you, though  for yourselves,
I'm sure you're not all that long-legged."
    Stickleburr  was  beginning to  show  some  signs of  inebriation.
Banewood  and Sod  sat  back  to enjoy  the  feast.  They watched  the
antics  of the  Ludki as  they  danced their  high-kicking dances  and
swung their  arms in  the air.  With a  shout, the  dancers punctuated
the songs  with a "hey!"  At length,  even the subdued  travelers were
on their  feet and kicking. The  Ludki laughed and clapped  to urge on
the long-legged  dancers. Sod  twirled like  a top  and bobbed  like a
cork.  At a  feverish  pace, he  was caught-up  in  the festive  mood.
Moments  before he  could  dance  no more,  the  song  stopped with  a
rousing "hey!"
    Stickleburr  was  much impressed  with  the  two travelers.  After
slapping  both of  them  on  the shoulders,  the  squat little  fellow
mounted a stump and cleared his throat.
    "Ahem!" The crowd  became silent. "I'd like to  express the thanks
of all Ludki for what you two have done. We couldn't have done it ourselves."
    Stickleburr  brought out  a  long  object and  handed  it to  Sod.
"This is for the wolksmert unless it's for something else.
    Sod looked at  the fine-crafted sheath given to him  by the Ludki.
The sword slid  silently into it's scabbard. Sod  expressed his thanks
with a smile and a nod.
    "And  these," continued  Stickleburr,  "are for  the Banewood  and
they're not for anyone else."
    Banewood  received a  quiver  full of  fine, Ludki-crafted  arrows
with  razor-sharp metal  heads. The  shafts were  straighter than  any
Banewood had ever seen.
    With great bombast,  the swaying Stickleburr went on  to offer the
friendship of  the Ludki to  Banewood and  Sod. Much to  his surprise,
Sod immediately  took him up on  his offer for assistance.  This was a
surprise,   because  the   Ludki   had  very   traditional  views   of
hospitality. After  favors, guests did  not customarily ask  for more.
But Sod did. He  wanted to know the way to Baba  Yaga's hut. The Ludki
blanched at  such a  request. Oh  horrors! But it  was only  a request
for directions;  the Ludki need  not accompany the  travelers. Anyway,
thanks to the mead,  Stickleburr was in a jovial mood.  He went so far
as to offer guidance to the outside of their realm.

                       Review: THE DEAD OF WINTER
                       Thieves' World Book Seven
    Robert  Lynn Aspirin's  Thieves'  World series  continues in  this
new paperback  from Ace, and  it is, in my  opinion, quite a  step up.
The  most recent  TW books  have  been, to  me, a  letdown. They  were
bogged down with  the heavy-handed politics of Sanctuary  and were not
interesting to  read. Book 7  starts slowly, but soon  improves vastly
into  what I  believe to  be the  best TW  book written  to date.  The
Veiled  Lady, by  Andrew Offut,  is a  very warm  and amusing  tale of
Ahdio, the  keeper of Sly's Place  in Downwind. When the  Spirit Moves
You, by  Aspirin, is also one  of the best  tales TW has put  out, and
nowehere  near  as heavy-handed  as  previous  efforts. The  Color  of
Magic by Diana  Paxson returns us to the household  of Lalo the Limner
and  Gilla, who  is taken  captive by  a Roxane  who is  determined to
sink Santuary  in a storm  of epic  porportions. For me,  however, the
most  wonderful  story  was  by   Diane  Duane,  called  Down  by  the
Riverside. It  is an account of  the death of Harran  and what happens
when  the twin  goddesses Sivieni  and the  once-mute Mriga  find out.
They  and   their  dog,  Tyr,   elicit  the   aid  of  Ischade   in  a
wonderfully-depicted  descent to  Hell and  back, and  is filled  with
surprises. Buy the book if just for this story!
    This book is a  must for TW fans, and a  wonderful breath of fresh
air  after  the  dry  politics  of the  previous  books.  You  may  be
surprised to  find that cover  art is being  done by Gary  Ruddell, so
the book  looks a  little different,  but you  should have  no trouble
finding it. Unless, of course, the bookstore runs  out before  you get
your copy!
