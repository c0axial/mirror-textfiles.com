                              X-Editorial
    Well,  folks here  it  is, the  end  of volume  3!  In this  issue
conclude  both Mari  Paulsen's  Narret Chronicles  and Roman  Olynyk's
Acquisition  serials.  Sandwiched in  between  is  a short  review  of
another  new Thieves'  World book,  "Soul of  the City".  In the  next
issue, Volume  1, issue  1, the  first of  the Dargon  writing project
stories  will appear,  and I'll  go into  that in  more detail  in the
editorial-cum-prologue in that issue.
    I  would encourage  readers to  send in  their comments  on either
Narret or  the Acquisition,  and they will  be considered  to printing
in  issue 4-1.  By  the  way, Mari  is  considering  writing a  sequel
series for  Narret, and Roman  is incorporating Banewood and  Sod into
the  Dargon writing  project, so  you can  expect more  from them,  as
well as the  other authors involved with Dargon. And,  of course, I'll
plod  on  with  news,  reviews,  and  featured  authors  as  time  and
submissions permit.
    Thanks for reading,  and thanks for sharing. I hope  you all enjoy
the zine and  the upcoming fruit of  the writing project as  much as I
have enjoyed writing for it. Catch you later...

                            The Acquisition
                         Part Four: Conclusion
    Banewood  and  Sod remained  awake  most  of  the long  night  and
occasionally  fed more  wood to  the pyre.  Only when  they were  sure
that  nothing remained  of Kathryn's  carcass  did they  rest for  the
waning hours  before dawn.  For breakfast,  they ate  a hasty  meal of
dried meat  and bread, and  then they  departed in the  same direction
from  which they  arrived.  Banewood  managed to  gather  some of  the
strange simples  and root stocks from  the ancient herb garden  he had
passed on  the way in.  The path through  the tangled thorn  brush was
certainly no easier than  it was on the way in. Nature  did not go out
of her way to extend its thanks for a job well done.
    When  they  passed  out  of  the thorn  thicket  and  reached  the
forest, the  two men found  the same path  they had traveled  with the
Silvan  Lord.  Surprisingly, the  path  was  actually straighter  than
they  thought when  they  travelled  it a  couple  of nights  earlier.
Lessy, no  doubt disheartened,  was not  to be  found on  their return
trip,  but Banewood  and  Sod  were not  dismayed,  for  now the  dark
forest seemed  more alive  than before.  Previously somber  birds were
now  joyfully  singing,  and  occasional  butterflies  could  be  seen
flitting  among the  treetops. On  their way  back home,  Banewood and
Sod found more  to talk about. Banewood was excited  about the book of
ancient secrets  he had found  in the hut of  Baba Yaga. He  felt that
this book could  unlock the doors blocking his quest  for knowledge of
the  Shaman's  arts. Already,  Banewood  was  practicing strange,  new
spells  that  he  had  translated  from  the  book.  His  prowess  was
increasing steadily.  Sod spoke of  his dream  to break away  from his
life  as a  plowman. He  wished to  sever his  roots to  the soil  and
become  a  journeyman,  a  knight  errant of  this  kingdom  upon  the
plains. He found that he now had the confidence to realize his dream.
    When Banewood  and Sod  arrived once again  at the  Ludki village,
they  were greeted  by the  entire  population of  little people.  The
smiles  were upon  the  round  faces and  bright  and exotic  feathers
dressed the tall  caps worn by all.  It was a state  reception for the
two heroes.  Banewood and Sod  walked waist-deep through  the cheering
crowd and stopped directly in front of Stickleburr.
    "Hey Sod, hey  Banewood! It seems that you've  killed Kathryn, for
she can  no longer  be alive.  The forest and  plains are  free again,
though they've  hardly known  any freedom. Congratulations,  yes, most
certainly!" Spoke Stickleburr from atop his royal stump.
    The little  people all  cheered and waved  their hats.  All around
the Ludki village  stood cloth-covered tables layed  out with fragrant
foods -- all  of the delicacies that could be  concocted. Kegs of mead
were  everywhere in  anticipation of  a great  feast in  honor of  the
slayers of the monster Kathryn.
    "You've done an  Immeasurable Service to all of The  Ludki by Your
Slaying  of the  Great  Wolk  and Kathryn,"  said  Stickleburr in  his
finest rhetoric,  adding: "Since  your Service  is Most  Certainly not
Measurable to even  a single Ludki, and Since It  wasn't actually Your
Slaying of  the Great  Wolk and  Kathryn because  the Wolk  wasn't all
that Great and Kathryn wasn't at all Kathryn."
    Sod  found  it  difficult,  to   say  the  least,  to  follow  the
circuitous  speech of  Stickleburr, but  he  did manage  to glean  the
meaning:  Kathryn was  not really  Kathryn.  Did they  kill the  wrong
monster? Worse yet, was there actually another monster like Kathryn?
    Stickleburr said: "I  know what you're thinking, Sod,  even if you
don't. There  is no  other monster,  for there  was only  one; Kathryn
was really Baba Yaga because she was nothing else."
    Once again all  of the Ludki cheered loudly. The  feast was on and
the  music was  struck. Flagons  were filled  with bubbly  mead poured
from the  aged kegs. This was  the best of  brews, for this was  to be
the best of celebrations-- Kathryn was dead and Baba Yaga was no more.
    Without prompting,  the two heroes  joined in the  merriment. Food
and drink were  both brought to the guests of  honor. The large, round
eyes of  the Ludki bulged  in disbelief at  the sight of  Banewood and
Sod drinking  their mead. Surely,  the two strangers must  have hollow
legs to  hold so  much drink.  Banewood and Sod  could very  well have
had  hollow legs,  for they  drank considerable  amounts of  mead even
for men.  They had  had a long  and difficult ordeal,  and this  was a
welcome relief  from the events  of the  past several weeks.  And most
certainly, this mead was the best they had ever tasted!
    While  Banewood  and  Sod  were enjoying  themselves  and  filling
their bellies,  the Ludki danced  furiously, spinning and  hopping and
clapping  their little  hands.  The musicians  were  adept with  their
instruments--  strange varieties  of many-stringed  wonders. Suddenly,
from  some  occult  cue,  the  music  and  dancing  and  laughter  all
stopped.  A lone  minstrel  approached Banewood  and  Sod, bowed,  and
began  to pick  his instrument.  After several  introductory bars,  he
sang a song whose chorus was joined in by all:

                        "Tell a tale of Kathryn,
                   a tough old sow with tougher skin.
                She razed the fields with flame and fire
                      now where did she go?  Hey!

    Chorus:
                 "They ground her up for sausage links.
                They boiled her down for candle sticks.
               They tanned her hide and sewed some shoes
                    so now she's hit the road.  Hey!

                       Tell a tale of Shaman folk
                   who packs himself an awful smoke.
                      He smoked a bit with Kathryn
                      now where did she go?  Hey!

                     Tell a tale of a man named Sod
                  who found himself a sharp old sword.
                       He smote a bit on Kathryn
                      now where did she go?  Hey!"

    Banewood  and Sod  were both  deeply touched  by this  tribute. In
their dim age  of little writing, great deeds were  memorialized in an
oral tradition.  The song of their  deeds could very well  outlive any
scrap  of paper  or  even any  memory  of just  who  Sod and  Banewood
actually were.
    Stickleburr once  again mounted  his royal stump.  The thin-haired
and  pot-bellied leader  of  the  Ludki swayed  slightly,  for it  was
apparent that  he'd been  sampling his  share of  the mead.  He rubbed
his bulbous little  nose to see if  it was still there  and then spoke
to the gathering in long-drawn syllables.
    "My fellow Ludki.  We are gathered here, for  we aren't elsewhere,
to  Honor these  Two Humans  whom  we don't  wish to  do dishonor  for
their Deeds. Hic.  Since it wouldn't be Right to  take them away, I'll
present  these Medallions  to Sod  and Banewood  for their  uncowardly
Courage   in   defeating  Kathryn-Who-   Couldn't-Be-Defeated.   These
Medallions  make known  that which  is not  unknown: Sod  and Banewood
are forever Friends  of the Ludki, for we cannot  be your enemies even
for a short while."
    Stickleburr paused to  hang the medallions around  their necks. He
hiccuped and continued:  "I must tell you, for it  wouldn't do to tell
another,  that  both of  you  will  find Greatness,  unless  Greatness
cannot  be  found  but  rather  achieved.   Hic!  Sod,  it  is  not  a
coincidence, though  You may  think it is,  that You  found Wolksmert.
Wolksmert  found You.  Wolksmert,  the wolf-slayer,  was crafted  many
hundreds of  years ago by  the Ludki, for  it could have  been crafted
by  none other.  It seeks  the hand  which can  guide it,  unless that
hand can't  be found, then  it will evade  the unsure hand,  though an
unsure  hand is  more  likely itself  to evade  the  sword! Hic!  Sod,
wield Your Sword wisely, for to do otherwise would be foolish. Hic! Hic!
    "Banewood, you  shall be  a Powerful and  a Good  Sorcerer, though
You  may not  think You  are either.  In Your  lifetime You  will undo
much of  the evil that  has already been  done by the  Evil Sorceress,
for You can't undo that which hasn't already been done. Hic!"
    Stickleburr  was  quite  obviously  reeling  now  and  finding  it
difficult to  keep his  balance. He  continued to  feel for  his nose,
but he couldn't find it for the numbness.
    "So let Me say,  unless you say I can't say it,  that You Two have
found  Greatness that  you never  lost because  you sought  to acquire
it. Hic!  It was  there-- it  wasn't anywhere else.  Hic! I...  I... I
must stop  now, for I think  I've had too  much to drink, though  if I
start on  it, hic,  I'd say  it wasn't  the drink  that I  drunk-- the
drink's not  drunk, rather, I drank  the drink, unless I  drunk it. It
was already drunk, but now I'm the one who's drunk-- Hic!"
    With that, Stickleburr  spun off his stump, much to  the relief of
the other  Ludki, who had  become almost  as confused as  Banewood and
Sod.  While Stickleburr  lay passed-out  with  a smile  upon his  numb
lips,  the   other  Ludki--   those  who  weren't   also  passed-out--
endeavored  to follow  their leader.  Banewood and  Sod joined  in the
twirling,  leg-kicking  dance of  the  Ludki  and shouted  "Hey!"  The
dancing, music and  magic lasted long into the night,  and remained in
the memories of the two humans long after many things had passed.
    A warbler's  song awoke  Sod from his  slumber. Rosy  morning rays
penetrated the  covering of  trees and  illuminated the  Ludki village
with  radiance. All  around the  beehive ovens  and little  houses and
strewn-about kegs lay  the supine bodies of Ludki,  some still wearing
their  pointed  hats and  bright  feathers.  Sod's pre-breakfast  mind
pondered over  the many events  that had  recently come to  pass. He'd
seen so many  things that he'd never thought he'd  see-- the Ludki and
the  Silvan  Lord  and  parts of  the  great  countryside  surrounding
Gorod. Things  he'd wished he'd  never seen-- the Great  Wolk, Kathryn
and Baba  Yaga's hut.  Stories from  his childhood  had come  to life,
and all  he had to  do was to  brave seldom-travelled paths.  How many
more  wonders lay  waiting to  be  seen? He  didn't know,  but now  he
would endeavor to find them, for his curiosity had finally been aroused.
    After they  had both broken  fast, the two journeymen  washed away
the grime  of the  last few  days and bid  farewell to  their friends,
the Ludki.  Banewood and Sod  promised to  respect the privacy  of the
little people;  they would not  divulge the existence and  location of
the  Ludki, who  wished  to  maintain their  distance  from the  human
race. As  Stickleburr explained, once  upon a time, many  thousands of
years ago, the  Ludki lived near humans. It was  Ludki adroitness with
smithing  that led  humans to  request from  them weapons  of iron  --
weapons  the Ludki  had no  wish to  forge. The  few weapons  they did
make, the  Ludki imbued with  a magic that  would not allow  their use
without purpose  or good intent.  Wolksmert was one such  weapon which
had survived that golden age of metal working.
    By the  time Banewood and  Sod reached  the center of  Gorod, they
had acquired  a persistent throng of  followers eager to hear  news of
their  adventures. Most  expressed  murmured  amazement that  Banewood
and  Sod returned  alive,  uninjured  and not  white  with fright.  If
anything, they  even looked  healthier than  when they  had originally
undertaken their  quest. Banewood's  Ludki-crafted arrows  were hidden
away and  both of  their medallions lay  hidden beneath  their tunics.
Banewood  and  Sod only  offered  unembellished  details of  Kathryn's
final moments. They  didn't mention Baba Yaga's hut or  even the great
wolk.  There was  considerable  rejoicing among  the  populace at  the
news of  Kathryn's death. Regardless  of how little the  two travelers
told, they were highly regarded by the folks of Gorod. They were heroes.
    Inside the  Antlers, Sod and  even Banewood were offered  seats of
honor and  given drinks  of crude  tavern mead. As  the days  went by,
Banewood and  Sod would often  meet there  to discuss their  plans for
travel.  This time  they  were going  across the  plain  in search  of
distant cities.  Tales were  told of  men in the  far away  cities who
rode upon the  backs of four-legged beasts, and Banewood  and Sod both
agreed that  they would like  to explore more  of their world.  It was
now late  autumn, and what  little harvest  there was that  was spared
by  Kathryn's harsh  breath was  stored away.  The daily  work routine
was slowing in pace. The time was ripe for travel.
    A  few  large  bottle  flies   were  marauding  about  within  the
Antlers, enjoying  the late  warmth and making  a general  nuisance of
themselves  with the  few  customers. One  daring  fly kept  alighting
near  Sod, trying  to  divert  the normally  stolid  plowman. The  air
intermittently cracked with  the resounding whack of  Sod's large hand
upon the table. He couldn't kill the pesky fly.
    "Yeauh, Sod,"  yelled the Miller  from across the tiny  room. "Why
don't you  let Banewood  give the  fly some of  his smoke.  The little
critter'd get so dizzy it would burn itself into a hole! Harr! Harr!"
    Banewood  cast a  glance at  the bottle  fly buzzing  around their
heads and sent it to the great beyond with a tiny, explosive pop.
    The Miller,  who saw this, inhaled  part of his mead  and coughed.
Banewood and Sod laughed.

                      REVIEW: The Soul of the City
                         Thieves' World Book 8
    When  I first  saw the  new Thieves'  World book  on the  shelf, I
thought to  myself: Oh,  boy, another  TW book  to drudge  through and
review for  FSFNet. Well, the seventh  book (which also came  out only
recently),  "The Dead  of  Winter"  was good,  so  I  jumped in,  even
though it  takes too  much time to  read and go  to school.  Folks, if
you  haven't read  "the  Dead of  Winter" and  the  most recent  book,
"Soul of the City", you're in for a TREAT!
    After Aspirin's  third or  fourth book, I  had lost  interest, due
to  a stagnation  in the  characters and  events in  Sanctuary. As  if
reading my  mind, these most  recent books each  seem to focus  on one
aspect  of the  authors' writing  styles that  had been  lacking. "The
Dead of  Winter" contains superb characterization,  and each character
portrayed leaves  a lasting image on  the reader. The book  reads like
several short stories about Sanctuary's inhabitants.
    The new  book, "Soul of  the City" is it.  For all you  people who
knew that  it would eventually come  down to war in  the streets, here
it is:  the resolution of  all the  conflicts of Ischade  and Roxanne,
and everyone who's  anyone is town, including the  new Rankan emperor.
In contrast  to the style  that "the Dead  of Winter" was  written in,
this book flows  and has excellent continuity. It  is an action-packed
novel, not a  collection of short stories, and  despite my schoolwork,
I  had  a very  difficult  time  putting  the  book down.  This  book,
written entirely  by Lynn  Abbey, C.J. Cherryh,  and Janet  Morris, is
supposedly  the  lead-in  to  a forthcoming  book  by  Abbey  entitled
"Beyond Sanctuary".
    I  encourage any  Thieves' World  fans out  there,as well  as fans
who have become  disenchanted with the series, to pick  up books 7 and
8. Each is in a different style, but both are well worth the time.

                         The Narret Chronicles
                            Book the Second
    "The forum you  requested is waiting Dr. Ht"  said Colonel Roberts
as they  escorted Samo  to a waiting  helicopter. "Both  the president
and the premier are anxious to meet with you."
    "They  should  be, I've  come  a  long  way  to meet  them."  Samo
replied rather smugly.

    "Ladies and  gentlemen," Samo began, "I  have been sent here  by a
very costly  effort on behalf of  my people. By the  words "my people"
I do  not mean  the people  of my country,  or even  the people  of my
planet, Amrif  Arret. By  those words  I mean  the people  whose lives
you will destroy,  those people whose advanced  knowledge and advanced
technologies may  never be  shared with  any of you  in this  room, or
with any human.
    "Why? Not  because there  are no longer  any humans  to understand
us. Why?  Not because  we are  unable to communicate  with you,  or to
bridge  the gap  of space  between us.  But simply  because you  would
rather  collect  a  set  of  nuclear  playtoys  for  winning  childish
squabbles over masses  of dirt to put  your under-populated, over-fed,
fat human  bodies on.  And go  about praising  your documents  of law,
your  'Declarations  of  Independence'  your  'Constitution'  and  its
'Bill  of   Rights'  with   their  claims   of  perfect   unions,  the
establishment of  justice, and  most of all  the self-evidence  of all
men  being created  equal. Those  were noble  thoughts. Thoughts,  far
more  they were  than  words, they  were the  Ideals  upon which  this
great  country was  founded. These  thoughts, these  ideals of  peace,
equality, and justice came from men far nobler than those before me.
    "Surely you  may grow impatient with my gruffness, please  hear me
out I  implore you  for your  own sakes  and the  sakes of  my people,
hear me out.
    "I  cannot understand  how  two  adults can  even  think to  begin
compiling the  weapons you  have compiled  while there  are thousands,
no, millions of  your brethren  dying throughout your  world. How much
can these rights  mean to you? How much does  the equality of creation
mean, when  you will  tomorrow blow  each other  off of  your precious
land masses  and ruin your  world for those  who had nothing  but hope
anyway, all for naught.
    "All because  you worried  that you  may not  be free  tomorrow to
have all  your own  little worries  and troubles  taken care  of, that
tomorrow you may  not be as comfortable as today.  Soon, very soon, if
you continue  this deadly  and insane  weapons compilation,  there may
not be that tomorrow you're so desperately worried about today.
    "If  you were  to continue,  and  had a  last and  final war,  you
gentlemen  should  be  congratulated.   For  you  gentlemen  would  be
responsible  for the  ultimate extermination  of entire  solar systems
in not one, but two universes at the same time.
    "You see, what  you've failed to realize is that  if you blow your
planet to  the fifth physical  dimension, you'll be blowing  my people
up  with you.  And not  only will  the destruction  of good  old Terra
Firma  have  an effect  on  the  Solar System,  but  it  will have  an
equally  disastrous  effect  on the  Losar System.  Our entire  planet
will merely  "go out  of existence"  as you know  it. In  addition, my
people  will have  no say  whatsoever in  that event.  Is that  within
your concept of  fairness equality, and justice? If so  then how about
within your forefathers?
    "Furthermore,  who knows  what  may  be said  will  happen at  the
unbalancing of  energies within this  universe itself. How  many other
life-forms' chances  of survival  will you  destroy, in  that solitary
instant of selfishness?
    "I  came  here hoping  to  find  some  reasonable  men. Men  of  a
knowledge  of peace,  and instead  I found  the ignorance  that breeds
belligerence.  I did  find hope  though, and  that hope  lies where  I
knew it  would, in  the men  of science.  The hope  lies in  those who
were bright  enough to create  weapons of war,  and it rests  in those
men  with talents  to make  the weapons  of mankind's  enemy, disease.
Your physicians are those within whom your hope lies now.
    "Before I came  here, I met with two of  your physicians to better
the knowledge  of mankind in defeat  of Cancer. You will  find, if you
take the  time to  decrease your  stockpile of  weaponry, that  if you
give your  doctors the  insurance that  their efforts  will not  be in
vain and the  assurance that there will  be a world full  of people to
help tomorrow,  they may  just be  able to  find a  cure. The  hope of
peace, and of  life itself lies in  your hands. Why don't  you give it
back to the  men who deserve it  most. The men in  both your countries
who have  been fighting for years  for the same thing,  the prolonging
not the extinguishing of life--your physicians."

                             Book the First
    Samo stood  there in silence  as his last words  echoed throughout
the auditorium. Then  suddenly his ears were filled  by the tremendous
sound  of   applause  by   third  world   countries  while   both  the
president's, and the  premier's eyes welled with tears  as they looked
at each other realizing how right he was...

    "<<<AUTOSTARTING FUTURE ANALOG TAPE--RUNNING DOWN ENDER TO START>>>"
    "Catabilizer--Load Future  Analog tape running from  last approach
to Terran planet number three." Samo replied to his onboard computer.
    "Well, so  it was..." Samo  said to  himself, wondering if  he was
going  to  be as  successful  on  this trip  to  Earth.  He sat  there
wondering,  in  the quiet  of  his  spacecraft,  rather dazed  by  the
immensity  of it  all, as  a great  light appeared  in the  heavens in
front of him. And  at once he new he was late.  Ignorance had won, and
greed had gone too far.
