                                  Editorial
   Hello, again!   Well, after all the requests to get the next issue out this
week,  I guess I  really ought to.   This will be the last  issue of Volume 1;
Volume 2 will begin June 1.   A reminder  for those of you whose accounts will
be purged this month: PLEASE send a mail file notifying me of this fact.   And
good luck on your finals, everybody!!! ;^)
   It recently has come to my attention  that FSFNET is available from servers
all   over  the   globe,   namely   CANSERVE@CANADA01,   SERVER@TAMCBA,    and
VMBBOARD@WEIZMANN.   I  would encourage people who  want back issues  to check
these servers, and NOT to request FSFNets to be sent during weekdays and other
peak load times.
   After  this  issue  (and  the conclusion  of  Murph's  lengthy  and  worthy
submission), FSFNet will return to its previous format, including the featured
author column.   Narret will also continue  to it's illogical beginning.   For
those of you  who will be here this  summer,  stay tuned for  the beginning of
Volume 2 June first.   For those who will not be here this summer, remember to
get in touch again in the fall for Volume 3!
   At the end of this first volume,  I  would like to thank you all for making
this project successful,  particularly those who  took part in the survey and,
of course, the contributors,  without whom there would be no zine.   Thank you
all, and onward into the future!

                            The Narret Chronicles
                               Book the Seventh
   Samo strained for  a second,  regaining his composure and  letting his eyes
adjust to the cold, bright blackness of the counter-universe.  He reached down
to the guidance computer and entered the triaxial coordinates of a dim-yellow,
class G star that was situated in a star field that appeared to Samo to be the
reverse of Cyri.  The star he sought was situated not even halfway there, but,
as he could recall  quite vividly,  it seemed to appear  pleasantly as a shiny
point of light gleaming on Cyri's daser.
   Concentrating on the  distant star,   Samo kept it  centered on  the light-
sensitive directional guiding system developed by  Cpl.  Stado for guiding his
white-whole  telescopes in  long exposure  photographs.   next  he locked  the
controls of the craft on auto, and sat back to review some notes.
   "Catabilizer--deload Bio-effect future tape. File off and derun to finish."
   "<<<Deloading Bio-effect file number 9000--don't wait>>>"
   "<<<Derunning with massive errors, wraping down to finish>>>"
   Samo saw  an image of  himself,  some 300  Losar cycles previous  his voice
recording the exercises his  figure was running through.   At the  time of his
first voyage, he was younger and more ambitious,  and he regarded his youthful
figure with  benign indignation.   Still,   the record  he had created  of his
atomic transformations during his last journey did have scientific value,  and
although they were slightly immature, or so it seemed to Samo,  he was glad he
had recorded  them for posterity.    It was helpful for  him to recall  how he
felt, becoming physical for the first time.   It gave him something to compare
his present sensations to.
   "Anti-trivia is  so much more  restricting than  trivia." Samo had  said to
himself,  well actually to the ships  analog computer during the first voyage.
He was glad it all felt the same the second time around.
   "Catabilizer start future Bio-effect tape." He had seen enough.   Enough at
least to  know that he  was feeling normal.    Normal for a  Narretan suddenly
placed in the counter-universe, that is.
   "Catabilizer deload Future analog tape file and derun from ending with last
approach to planet Earth."
   "<<<Deloading Future analog tape--don't wait>>>"
   "<<<Derunning  Future analog  tape with  massive  errors--wrapping down  to
ending with approach to Terran Planet number 3>>>"
   Samo saw the dim reflection of starlight from a small, cold,  planet with a
smaller, solitary satellite.  He adjusted his orbit for a flyby.
   "Cozy",  Samo said  to himself as he skirted by  Pluto's cratered,  gasless
surface.  "So much for  their ninth planet...on to the eighth,"  he said as he
re-adjusted the orbit for Neptune.   "Might as well check out what I've got to
work with in raw materials..."
   "Ah this is more  like it!" He said as he entered  the green atmosphere and
flew under the ring, perpendicular to the planet's horizontal axis. "Sulphuric
acid, Carbon dioxide, methane,  hydrogen,  and traces of oxygen." He said into
the microphone of his analog computer.
   As  he flew  by  Uranus,  he  became  disappointed at  the  state of  human
technological advancement.   "The humans  have not established  a base  on the
seventh planet of this solar system yet." He recorded.
   At Saturn,  he could not stop himself from making a few measurements of the
ring and studying its chemical composition and the elements in the atmosphere.
He wanted to  compare the sizes of the  counter planets with the  sizes of the
home planets to see if there  was a measurable difference between anti-trivial
and trivial mass.
   Samo was  monitoring the  pre-nuclear signals  from Earth  as he  flew from
planet to planet, and the signals seemed to be decreasing,  so he adjusted his
course  for Jupiter  and began  contemplating  his coming  encounter with  the
humans.   How  primitive were they?   How could  he best communicate  with the
masses?   Most importantly how could he explain who he was without being taken
for a mad man...
   He decided he'd  have to give it his  best shot with a  few special effects
when he got there.
   Jupiter.   Samo  flew inside the  ring and ran  a spectral analysis  on its
composition.   He entered the data into  the analog computer for conversion to
darktron spectral analysis,  and flew into the cloud bands.   He took her down
beneath the  cloud layer and  was again disappointed  that the humans  had not
even progressed as far as the fifth planet.
   "Fifth planet uninhabited," Samo recorded, "entering asteroid belt."
   As Samo skirted  Mars he was again  unsurprised by the lack  of habitation.
"These humans are non-colonial and primitive,   at a level approximately equal
to Amrif's pre-sramian period."
   "Approaching Earth  orbit at an inclination  of 45 degrees to  the planet's
equator.   Receiving  two strong  signals from  different continental  masses.
Both northern hemisphere, opposite sides of the planet." He recorded.
   "Time to let them know I'm here..."

                    (Conclusion of story begun in Vol1N07)

   Sharmuth's afternoon session  went like the others had.    No real progress
was made.   After studying the tape of  today's dream,  Doctor James felt like
they were  going nowhere  fast.   It was  quite a  different feeling  from the
elation he felt  about Maryann's rapid progress.   The difference  in rates of
progress had him  a little confused.   Normally,   he would have been  able to
retain a professional attitude if he had had  just one of the two cases at any
given time.  Rapid rates of progress are not unusual.   Neither are cases that
have no  progress.   The fact  he had one  of each at  the same time  was what
perplexed Doctor James.   It  just did not seem right that  he could have such
amazing success with one patient and have absolute zero success with another.

   "You're looking much better today, Maryann."
   "Thank you,  Doctor.   I really feel quite a bit better.   My therapist ran
some tests this morning and he said that  there had been an improvement in the
muscle tissue of my arm.  He was rather excited about it after all these weeks
of absolutely no change.   I am quite thrilled about it myself!   I now have a
positive reinforcement  so that I  can keep hoping that  I will once  again be
able to use every part of my body.    I haven't ever given up hope,  but there
were times  when all  the tests  and efforts  of others  and myself  seemed so
futile.  I think that, more than any other reason, is why I look better today.
I just feel so much better on the inside that I can't contain it all and it is
spreading to my outside."
   "I'm certainly glad  that you are feeling so much  better about everything,
Maryann.   I don't want to bring you down, but I do hope that you can continue
to feel this way even if we don't make any more progress over the next week or
even the  next month.   Progress  can sustain  a positive attitude  with ease.
It's keeping your positive attitude when things are not going your way that is
the biggest step towards progress."
   "I don't think I can ever feel badly about my situation again,  Doctor.   I
have been  through the  futility of  feeling sorry  for myself  and now  I can
accept myself the way I am if I do not respond any further to treatment.  I've
been happy before  and I have been sad.    I have never been  anywhere near as
happy as I was  when my therapist told me that there  had been an improvement,
however small  it might have  been.   Even if I  never have another  change in
condition  I still  know  that hope  is  not futile  and  that improvement  is
possible because it happened once.   Until now,  no one thought that I had any
real hope of ever regaining use of my limbs because I had not responded at all
over the course of a month where full rehabilitation takes less than half that
time.   Now I have a solid basis for the hope that was only in my mind before.
Now I  know that  that hope  is not a  futile hope.    Since my  condition did
improve once,  I  know that it can happen  again.   I am betting  that it will
continue to improve.  If it doesn't, well, I still have hope."
   "That's one heck of an attitude.   I wish I could get all of my patients to
think that way.   Too  many people these days are trying  to get everything in
large chunks.   They want immediate and large scale results in everything they
do.   They  won't settle for consistent  progress or improvement.    They want
everything now.   If they don't get it, they put the blame on someone else and
try something else.   The people in this world would do well to lose something
that they  take for granted and  be told that  they could never have  it back.
And slowly, very slowly,  they would regain the use of that thing.   Then they
might come to appreciate some of the things we all take for granted.
   "Let's get back to  the case at hand,  my dear.   We  have progress to make
with you."
   "I'm all for progress, Doctor."
   "Were you able to remember anything else  by concentrating on the color red
over the past few days?"
   "No,  not really.   I  did dream about the color red  one night though.   I
haven't woken up at night because of a  dream since last week.   I think being
aware of the other dream and that the color red plays an important part in the
last dream kept me from becoming terrified  at night recently.   I do remember
other colors  from when I  was dreaming about the  color red.   They  were all
blurs though and I don't know what they were other than blurs of color.   They
all just kind of blended together.  They were all earth colors.   Grey, brown,
green.   I  get a very ominous  feeling when I  think of those colors  and red
still makes me feel uneasy."
   "After viewing your dream  it is quite easy to see why  the color red would
make you wake up screaming and also cause you to feel a little uneasy.
   "Tell me...   Do you  remember anything at all about the  accident that put
you in the situation that you're in  now?   Do you remember where it occurred?
Or who was in the  vehicle with you?   Or where you were going  at the time it
occurred?  Anything?"
   "Nothing.  I know that my family was killed only because I was told after I
had been conscious for a few days and had asked about them.   I don't remember
anything about what we did that day or why I was with them that day.   I know,
again because I was told, where the accident occurred.
   "The toughest thing to  deal with was the fact that  my parents and brother
had  been killed  and I  didn't even  remember being  with them  prior to  the
accident.   I can understand my not being  able to remember anything about the
accident,   but why  has my  mind blocked  out the  events leading  up to  the
accident?  Why?"
   "I think it is time for you to view  your last dream.   I was going to wait
for a couple of  sessions so we could discuss your  accident thoroughly enough
so that you wouldn't be taken totally by  surprise by the dream.   I think you
know enough  via hearsay,  you're  also beginning  to remember fringes  of the
circumstances surrounding the accident,  to view the dream and have it help us
rather than set us back.
   "So let's get over to the machinery and give it a go."
   "Lead the way, Doctor."
   As the tape ended Maryann sighed lightly  and slumped wearily in her chair.
"I am beginning to remember even more now, Doctor."
   "Good.   You didn't display  any violent reaction to what was  on the tape.
That is good.  I had feared that you might, upon 'seeing' the accident for the
first time," actually the second, he thought, "have an adverse reaction to it.
I'm glad to see that my fears were unfounded."
   "I remember the accident now.   I still don't remember where we had been or
where we were going,  but I do remember the part of our trip just prior to the
accident.   I also remember the accident itself and being thrown just a bit to
the side of  where my parents and  brother were thrown.   We  were all wearing
harnesses,  but I guess the force of the impact just severed the harnesses and
threw us all out.   The  only reason I am alive now is because  I was thrown a
few feet in another direction than the rest of my family.  The red in my dream
that kept waking me up is the red of the blood.   My blood and the blood of my
family.   This was a very short memory,  the color red.   I guess I passed out
very shortly after noticing all the blood.    That is all I remember until the
dreams of the regen tanks.
   "You're amazing,  Doctor.   You done in a  very short time what no one else
believed could be done.  I think we've discovered the major reasons why I keep
waking up and  I also think that now  I will begin to  improve physically even
more rapidly.  It's so wonderful to have a memory again.  Even if the memories
that have been uncovered  are not exactly pleasant,  it is  still nice to have
them and know about them rather than be scared silly by them in ignorance.   I
would like to  figure out what we were  doing all together and why  we were in
such a hurry on the day of the accident."
   "We'll continue to work on that, Maryann.   I do want to keep an eye on you
for a while even though you feel so positive about your recovery now.  We want
to keep  things under  control and  I'd like to  see you  recover all  of your
memory that was lost because of the accident."
   "Yes,  Doctor.   I'll see you in a couple  of days.   Maybe by then I'll be
walking again!" Maryann exulted.

   The  newspaper  headlines today  read  "FIRST  CLUE IN  MANCHESTER  MURDERS
UNEARTHED."   The  article  went  on  to say  that  another  murder  had  been
committed.   All the murders had occurred  within a half mile radius.   Though
the  area has  been heavily  patrolled of  late,  another  dead body  appeared
nonetheless.  But this time a man was seen moving away from the spot where the
murder occurred.

   "Doctor,  I am  becoming a nervous wreck.    I have had two  more blackouts
since the other day  and who knows what I've done while  I've been asleep.   I
can't continue like this.   I've got to get  to the bottom of this before I go
absolutely crazy and do something foolish."
   "Mr. Sharmuth, you have to admit that it is very difficult to make progress
with something when you have no point at which to begin.   We have no clues to
aid us in beginning to find out why you are blacking out.   We know that it is
not a  physical problem.    All of the  tests by the  physicians have  come up
negative.   That leaves  us with the assumption  that if it is  not a physical
problem that is causing you to black out, then it must be a mental one.  Until
we find that one  little clue to use as a springboard,  we  will not be making
rapid progress.   Believe  me,  I'd like to  see progress just as  much as you
would.   But we  must keep searching your  mind to find that  one little clue,
that one minor inconsistency.  It could be anything.   We just have to be very
alert and careful so  that we don't overlook anything.   In  so doing there is
virtually no way we can move rapidly.  Should we move rapidly, we stand a very
good chance of overlooking that which we are looking for, whatever it may be."
   "I understand,  Doctor,  but I still don't have to like it and I still want
quick results.   I'm used  to getting things done quickly and  it is extremely
difficult to be patient through all of this."
   "Let us go over and give the dream  monitor another try.   This time I want
you to concentrate on blacking out for a few minutes before you go to sleep."
   "Ok.  I'll give it a try," Sharmuth sighed heavily.

   Doctor James pulled  the tape out of  the monitor after Sharmuth  had woken
up.   He set the tape on his desk, walked back over to the monitor, and helped
Sharmuth out of the equipment.
   "Do you recall  anything about this dream?   Did  concentrating on blacking
out do  anything -  make you feel  anything different  - remember  anything at
all?"
   "Still nothing, Doctor.  I don't understand it at all."
   "Try to concentrate on  your blackouts over the next couple  of days.   Try
and stimulate  the subconscious  so that  some of  it's thoughts  and memories
might become conscious.  I'll take a look at this tape in a while.  Let's hope
there is something different on it.  Something that can give us a direction to
aim in, a starting point."
   "Ok, Doctor.  I'll see you in a couple of days."

   Sharmuth's recently  made tape  was very much  the same  as the  other two.
There was nothing on the tape that could  be used as a starting point to delve
further for clues.    "It's time to adopt Maryann's positive  attitude and not
feel that everything we're doing is totally futile," James thought.

   Time seemed to jump ahead for Doctor James.   There had been no progress at
all in Sharmuth's case.   It  was becoming increasingly bewildering.   Maryann
had continued to improve steadily,  but not as rapidly as at first.   This was
to be expected.  The rapid pace of the beginning of her treatment was just too
much to expect it to continue.   With her case doing so well, he had more time
to spend on Sharmuth's case.
   Sharmuth's case was  one instance where a positive outlook  had not helped.
So far.   There had to be something.   It  was only a matter of time before he
stumbled upon it by just moving about blindly.

   Doctor James arrived in is office earlier than usual one morning.  He had a
full calendar of appointments in the afternoon but had nothing in the morning.
He had planned to  look over the last few tapes of  Sharmuth's dreams.  He had
hoped to find something, anything, that might help.
   In the course of walking across the room  to where he stored his tapes,  he
noticed that  the monitor had been  left on and a  tape was just coming  to an
end.  The record switch was on.
   James checked over  his tapes quickly and  determined that this tape  was a
new tape and not one of the ones he had used just recently.  He watched as the
tape got closer to the end.   The record  switch finally shut off and the tape
was forwarded to the end and then the  monitor shut off.   James took the tape
out and went over to his playback equipment.  He wanted to find out what could
possibly be on  this tape.   How did it  get into the monitor and  how did the
monitor get  started up?   What  was it  recording,  if anything?    How could
anything be recorded when there was no one connected to the input gear?
   He loaded the tape and began to view it.

   I am being followed.   Why am I being followed?   I'll have to do something
about this.  I haven't done anything and he certainly doesn't look at all like
a cop.  I'm almost home.  I don't want him to follow me home.   Who knows what
he may  do.   He's  probably one of  those types who  doesn't deserve  to live
anyway.   The world will  be much better off without him  roaming the streets.
There are too many  of those about these days.   How can they  be so cruel and
inhumane?  They don't deserve to live.  This one will not continue to live.
   I rounded a corner  and waited.   I looked quickly to  make sure that there
was no one  else around.   Even in this  city,  it can be rather  quiet in the
early morning hours.  There was no one about.
   He rounded the corner  and hurried his pace because he'd  lost sight of me.
I came from behind him and stabbed him.  He died immediately.   He didn't even
have a chance to emit a sound from the  pain.   I cleaned the knife off on his
clothes and then walked down the street  as if nothing had happened.   Another
dead body in this city will not make any difference at all.
   There was  a quick  image of  beautiful,  peaceful  countryside and  then a
raucous, rowdy scene began.

   It was a bar.   A couple of fights  had broken out and the bouncers were in
the process of breaking  the fight (and a lot of  the furniture)  up.   bodies
were being tossed out into the street left and right.   Finally,  I became one
of those bodies.   I gracefully picked  myself up,  shouted obscenities at the
bouncers, and started walking away.  I didn't think of where I was going until
I got a few blocks away.  I made a turn and headed for home.  After a few more
blocks I saw a shadowy figure emerge from a doorway and step into my path.
   He had a weapon and demanded my wallet.    Not being one who is into death,
especially my own,  I slowly reached for  my wallet.   A sharp sound came from
close by and distracted  my mugger for a second.   I hit  his hand and knocked
the gun loose.  I was closer to it and made a grab for it.  I was quicker than
he and now had the gun.  This world has no use for this mugger anymore.  He is
another one of the sort that does not deserve to live.  Now he didn't.
   There were people within hearing range,   but not within sight.   I quickly
removed myself from the scene and then joined the small mob as they approached
the dead mugger.  It was very easy to do in the confusion.  The police arrived
after a short wait,  asked some questions,  and then sent us all home.   There
were no eye witnesses.  Everyone heard the shot.   Everything and everyone had
disappeared by the time anyone arrived on the scene.   I still don't know what
happened to the gun.
   The world is better off now.   One more person,  who didn't deserve to live
anyway, was gone.   How can they exist this way.   The more I see,  the more I
confirm the fact they do not deserve to live.
   Peace.  That overwhelming feeling again.   Even in minute quantities it was
overwhelming.

   What am I doing  in this part of town?   The types  of people that frequent
this part of town are the sort that I  would never consort with.   So why am I
here?    I  do  look rather  out  of  place.    In  this den  of  poverty  and
uncleanliness, I have no business.  Certainly no legitimate business.   Why am
I here?  These people don't deserve to live this way.  Most of them don't even
deserve to live.
   A man approaches.    He is a little  drawn and thin,  but  definitely able-
bodied.   One can see the strength that could  be his through the holes in the
rags that the denizens of this demesne  call clothes.   As he gets even closer
the stench becomes rather evident.  "Can you spare a dollar, mister?"
   No dollar.   I did talk him into coming home with me to see what life could
be like.   I  was planning on berating him  for not doing an  honest days work
when it  was quite  obvious that  he was a  very able-bodied  man even  in his
emaciated condition.   All  he needed was the  will to do a  little hard work.
Physical labor.   Why hadn't he been working?    He had obviously been in dire
straits for some time,   as his condition was not good  at all.   He certainly
could have found work if he'd been willing  to go looking.   We were almost to
my place  when I decided that  I did not want  anyone coming home with  me who
could  not perform  an  honest day's  work  when he  was  certainly more  than
capable.   People like that do not deserve to live.   And I wouldn't call what
he was doing back in that rat infested  hole living.   The world is better off
without him.   He is certainly much better  off.   I don't know how I managed,
but when  I realized where I  was,  he was  on the ground,  dead.    I must've
strangled him for I had no weapon.  Had he not been so weakened from his style
of life, I could never have done him in with my bare hands.  As he was though,
there was no challenge.  He wasn't even strong enough to struggle much.  But I
did catch him a  little off guard too.   He didn't deserve  to live.   How can
people exist that way?
   I turned, there was someone coming this way about 4 blocks away.   I turned
a corner and disappeared.   No one followed.   If that person kept walking, he
surely would find the body.   No matter.    He could not possibly have seen me
well from that distance.
   Once again,  that overwhelming feeling of  peace.   This time it lasted for
several minutes.  There were more images of beautiful, lazy countryside.   The
soft green  and golden yellow suggested  a lingering and lasting  peace.   The
most striking  thing about the  whole image was that  there was no  life.   No
animal life.  No human life.

   Doctor James sat in the chair for some time thinking about what he had just
viewed.  His respect for his dream monitor rose immensely.   He thought he had
figured out what was happening.
   The  sequences he  had  just viewed  were happenings  that  went on  during
Sharmuth's blackout  periods.   The machine  did pick  them up,  but  for some
reason did not record them during the sessions with Sharmuth.   The person who
had  done all  the killing  was Sharmuth.    There  was no  doubt about  that.
Sharmuth did  seem to be  the ruthless type,   but he did  not seem to  be the
killer type.    And why this  sudden hatred for  the human species.    The man
thrived on controversy and competition.   He needed people so that he would be
able to enjoy himself.
   Why would the machine select just one  person to screen out everything that
went on in the subconscious mind?   I  get the distinct feeling that this tape
had  two separate  personalities involved  in its  making.   One  was bent  on
killing and destruction, the other wanted only peace.  Total peace.
   Then it hit him.   Total peace.   To  achieve total peace on this world one
would just  about have  to start  from scratch.    All life  would have  to be
eradicated.
   Total peace.  Overwhelming peace.

   Doctor James decided that he had to inform the authorities of what he knew.
He would tell  them who the murderer was  and then he would  have to dismantle
his machine.   That was  the worst part of it.   The machine  had done so much
good for so many people.  This one case would ruin that record for good.  What
would life have been  like for Maryann without the machine?    She's now fully
recovered  and such  a  beautiful  young woman  now  that  all her  parts  are
proportional again!  It is a shame.
   The authorities would never believe his story though.  How could they?  The
population of  the world  is being exterminated  one by  one to  achieve total
peace?  What, this is being done by one man?  A 'machine'!?
   Well, he knew the response he was going to get.  But he'd made up his mind.
Doctor James picked up the phone and dialed the authorities...

   Doctor James sat bolt upright in bed,   his heart beating rapidly and sweat
running down his face.  He stared about his dark bedroom for a while before he
was able to fall back asleep.
