   Hello, and welcome back!   School is back in session, and here is the first
issue of the year.   Unfortunately,  due to a lack of submissions,  the summer
volume only consisted of two issues,  but I  am hoping that with the return to
school there will be a corresponding increase in submissions.   Remember, this
is your zine, and I can't do it alone.   An entire zine by me would be boring,
anyways, so for all of you who have thought about submitting anything,  please
do!
   Well,  hopefully next issue  will be out soon,  depending on  the number of
submissions.   I hope that  this issue is not too slow,   since it is composed
almost entirely  of reviews.    Of course,   Mari Paulsen's  Narret Chronicles
continues,   and  the  featured  author  column  this  issue  concentrates  on
Christopher Stasheff's Gramayre books.
   Well, I bid you welcome to volume three,  and remind you that FSFnet cannot
continue without reader submissions,  and also that  there are a number of new
BITNET users  who no doubt enjoy  BITNET use but  have yet to hear  of FSFnet.
Please try to spread the word to anyone you think might be interested.
   PS: Well, thanks to the link between YALEVM  and MAINE, this  issue is  yet
another week late.   Sorry about that.   Also, look  for a  continuing fantasy
work called "The Aquisition"  beginning next  issue and the  continuing Narret
science fiction series.  Watch this space!

                          Review: CATS HAVE NO LORD
   "...Dogs serve Ralkan the wolf king,  horses  answer to an aging mare named
Flowers,  and ants obey Her Peerless  and Exalted Majesty;  Bzxxyl the 1842th,
mistress of the Universe and Eater of Treats. Yet cats have no lord...
   Hawks serve Deathswoop the Daring, but all birds honor the Phoenix.  Sharks
only share with  the Hungry One,  while  all fish swim at  Tam tuna's request.
Cobras turn at the command of the Hood of All-Potent Poison... Now, all snakes
revere Nosey Groundsnake.  And so on.
   Some wise folk claim that ther are  creatures smaller that the eye can see.
If so,  they're ruled by a Supreme Atomie,   for so the God ordered all things
when She shaped the level of existence...."
   "What has this matter of Cat Lords, or the lack thereof, to do with us?"
   "My Order  will pay each  you each three  thousand royals to  climb World's
Peak,  discover where the Wisest one lives there and ask her for the answer to
that riddle..."
   This is the reason of CATS HAVE NO LORD, if not it's rhyme.  And it's by no
means all there is  to this smooth flowing novel by  Will Shetterly.  The main
characters, the acrobat/thief, the half-elven swordsman, the merry cleric, and
the most astute barbarian i've ever read,   must find the Cat Lord while being
manipulated, helped and hindered by forces arcane and mundane.
   Gamers and  fans of Robert  Aspirin's Thieves'  World will find  a familiar
feel to  the novel,  with the  added plus of  being one complete novel  by one
author rather than a compendium of short stories.
   This is  not to say that  'straight' fantasy fans  will be left out  of the
action.  Outside of beginning  in an awkward way - the  middle of a telepathic
discussion between  a woman and  her rather adroit horse  - the world  is full
fledged and easy to get into.   Tensions between cities,  lords and races (not
to mention the various Lords themselves)  give  an overtone that there is more
at stake than academic curiosity.  It is almost a must that more will be heard
from this magical world.
   CATS HAVE NO LORD by Will Shetterly, Ace Fantasy, New York,  5-85.   Quoted
in part as a review and not intended to violate any copyrights pending.

                            THE NARRET CHRONICLES
                                BOOK THE FIFTH
   "Well, it bears no Soviet markings at any rate, sir."
   "Or any marking's of any kind for that matter, Captain Phillips."
   "Well sir, what should we do now?"
   "You try to establish radio contact with the bogie while I contact NORAD."
   "They ought to be about ready to communicate by now," thought Samo.   I had
best stop down the counter-universal communications descanner and encrypter.
   "Seeker-1 to NORAD, come in NORAD, over."
   "NORAD to Seeker-1, we read colonel, over."
   "NORAD,  we  have established  visual contact with  the bogie,   have found
neither hostile nor friendly markings of any kind.   Trying to establish radio
contact at this time.  Awaiting further instructions, over."
   "Seeker-1,  proceed with communications interface  and report any necessary
changes in flight pattern, over."
   "NORAD, we copy, Seeker-1 out."
   "Any luck captain?"
   "None, sir. There's no response on the standard frequencies at all."
   "That's not surprising,   let's face it - that's not  exactly your standard
craft were up against.  Try the international hailing frequency."
   "All right sir...  Seeker-2 to unmarked craft,  Seeker-2 to unmarked craft,
please respond."
   "Well," said Samo, "what do you know...  they communicate.  It took them so
long to find the right frequency I was beginning to have doubts."
   "Unmarked  craft   to  Seeker-2  -   responding..."  Samo  said   into  the
communications device."
   "Unmarked craft  you have  violated the  airspace of  the United  States of
America.  Please identify yourself or we will be forced to shoot you down."
   "Friendly people." Samo said to himself. "I am Sgt. Dr. Samo Ht.  I come on
a mission  of trans-universal importance.    I am  here to prevent  a possible
global war.  Mine is a mission of peace, over."
   "Well, Dr. Ht, this is Colonel William Roberts, US Air Force.  I don't know
who you are,  or where you come from but if yours is a mission of peace as you
claim, then I must ask you to cooperate.  At this time you are approaching the
western boundary of our airspace.  I must ask you to turn your ship around and
continue in this  formation due east until we receive  clearances for landing.
Will you cooperate?"
   "Yes of course, I'll cooperate.   Tell your superiors what I have told you,
I come in peace,  and  tell them also that I must speak to  the leaders of the
two belligerent nations before an international forum."
   "Seeker-1 to NORAD come in NORAD, over."
   "NORAD to Seeker-1 we read, over."
   "NORAD,  we  have established radio  contact.   The  pilot of the  craft is
cooperating and  states he  is on a  mission of peace.    He also  requests to
address the President of the United States and the Premier of the Soviet Union
before the assembled ambassadors of the United Nations. Over."
   "Seeker-1 the President is in his Oval Office,  at this hour,  and is being
briefed on  your situation.   Proceed  on a course  for Dover Air  Force Base,
bearing  120 at  25,000 ft.    We will  notify  the President  of the  pilot's
requests and relay further orders as they we receive them, over."
   "NORAD, proceeding 120 degrees at 25,000 feet, Seeker-1 out..."
   "...Dover Control to Seeker-1, come in Seeker-1, over."
   "Dover Control this is Seeker-1, over."
   "Seeker-1, you are no longer under NORAD command. Permission for landing is
granted.   Proceed to dock alien craft in hanger-81, and place your Blackbirds
in hanger 71 Alpha."

                    Featured Author: CHRISTOPHER STASHEFF
   Born in New York  state in 1944,  Christopher Stasheff grew  up immersed in
the  developing  years  of  both  television,   radio,   and  science  fiction
literature.    Stasheff  maintains  that  de   Camp  and  Pratt's  "Inconpleat
Enchanter" is the  single largest influence on his style,   followed by Lester
del Rey's "Day  of the Giants" and  "The Sky is Falling".    After writing two
unpublished novels,  Stasheff began writing a  text for a contest sponsored by
the Magazine  of Fantasy  and Science Fiction.    Although the  manuscript was
never completed until 8 months after  the contest deadline,  Stasheff sent the
book to Ace,  who published it as "The  Warlock In Spite of Himself".   He has
also published three other books:  "King  Kobald" (and "King Kobald Revived"),
"The Warlock Unlocked", and "Escape Velocity".
   There is some question as to the  chronological order in which these novels
fit together.  For simplicity, they will be discussed in order of publication,
rather than  chronological order.   "The Warlock  In Spite of Himself"  is the
story of  Rod Gallowglass,   an interstellar explorer,   and his  adventure in
trying to establish  democracy on a long-lost planet of  medievals (founded by
members of the Society for Creative Anachronism,  no less).   Rod discovers an
interstellar conspiracy  across time  trying to  oppose him,   and he  and his
robot-brained horse,  Fess  (who is subject to seizures due  to an engineering
problem),  have  their hands full trying  to stymie their  foes,  occasionally
using  superior technology,   which  earns Rod  an  unwanted  reputation as  a
warlock.  An exceptional book.
   "King Kobald" was published in 1970, although before the recent Ace reprint
of  the series,   Stasheff rewrote  the book,   and retitled  it "King  Kobald
Revived".   This book  takes place approximately two years  after the previous
book,  and describes a further threat from the forces opposing Rod's effort to
steer the planet, Gramayre,  back to democracy.   His role as Royal Warlock is
influential  in  defending Gramayre  from  an  invasion of  Neanderthals  with
strange telepathic powers.   An excellent book,  with plenty of excitement and
wonderfully developed characters.   The new version  is much improved over the
original,  due to the rewrite,  but it  does not contradict the other books in
the series.
   "The Warlock Unlocked" is begun following two characters,  Rod,  of course,
begins the novel  some 6 years after  "King Kobald",  and Father  Al Uwell,  a
priest of the Order of St. Cathode, an engineering saint.  Uwell is being sent
to Gramayre by the church to monitor Rod,   since he has become so involved in
the fight for  democracy.   meanwhile,  Rod and his Gramayre  family (wife and
four children)  are  transported to another world,  and must  discover the way
back to Gramayre before  the forces against him overthrow all  his works.   He
meets up with Father Al, who has been tracking him, and together the group has
a number of very unique adventures.  A very fast-paced book, indeed.
   "Escape Velocity"  is the only book of the series that does not concentrate
on the events on Gramayre, and is more science fiction than fantasy.   In this
book, which takes place long before the establishment of Gramayre,  Dar Mandra
and company must reach Terra before a coup planned by the LORDS overthrows the
democratic Interstellar Dominion Electorate.    Unfortunately,  someone in the
upper echelons  has it out for  Dar,  and spreads  the rumor that Dar  and his
group are horrible telepaths,  out to pry into every citizen's secret thoughts
and desires.   In the following panic, Dar manages to reach Terra.   This book
is perhaps  the most  interesting of the  series,  as  the characters  are all
fantastic and yet  somehow believable.   Though the action  is interesting and
riveting, the end of the book comes too fast, and seems less well-written than
the beginning of  the book.   In this  book,  the founding of  Gramayre (which
later is  lost during a  "twilight" of democracy and  then later found  by Rod
Gallowglass) is described.
   In all the  books,  Stasheff's style is very enjoyable  and readable.   his
characters  are all  excellently  depicted,   and there  is  no  lack of  plot
movement.   His  Gramayre books  are an excellent  fantasy work,   and "Escape
Velocity" is  a very  good piece  of science  fiction.   His  style is  easily
adaptable to  either genre,   since it  does not  concentrate so  much on  the
environment,   but on  the human  characters  and their  relations with  other
humans.    Altogether an  excellent study  in characterization,   and also  an
excellent read!

                      Review:  THE SAGA OF PLIOCENE EXILE
                                by Julian May
                             A four book series:
                            The Many-Colored Land
                               The Golden Torc
                               The Nonborn King
                                The Adversary

   All kidding aside,  this set of books is some of  the best SF  I have  ever
read.    It  is  chock full  of  truly interesting  characters,  plot  twists,
insight,  high tech and (yes!)  even  some  action.   There are  several plots
running at  once.  MAIN CHARACTERS  actually  DIE!   The GOOD GUYS (if you can
tell who   they are)   DON'T  always  win!   It is  a delight  to read  and so
sprawling  in it's plot that it is difficult to describe.
   Without giving too much away, this is how the  story works: Sometime in the
not-too-distant  future  humanity  is  part of  a  Galactic  Milieu of  minds.
There are many metapsychics that are part of this "cosmic  unity". The psychic
powers (such as coercion,  psychokinesis,   etc.)   are supposed to be genetic
traits.   Those   people  with  latent  abilities   have  no   way  to    make
themselves operant metapsychics.
   Enter  the   time-gate:   A   scientist puts together  a one  way time-gate
which runs six-million years into the past.  Notice:  ONE WAY.   Anything that
enters  the time  gate  from  the  pliocene   takes   on the   burden  of  six
million years  of aging.  Until  his  death he  keeps   the gate running  as a
curiosity.   Upon his death  his  wife supports herself by sending PEOPLE on a
one  way   trip  into   the  past.   Many    of   those  disgruntled    latent
metapychics  take  that ticket  to get way from it all.
   This time gate tripping  goes on  for many  years.  We then meet a group of
time travelers and  follow them on their journey into the past.   Instead of a
"Riverworld" type   of  society they   find a   Europe inhabited  by  an alien
race!    These Tanu  use   torcs to   make   themselves  and  latent    humans
operant   metapychics as well as enslave those that are not latents.
   Can humanity be freed from the slavery of  the torcs?   Do they want to be?
Is  the time  gate really  one-way?
   That little synopsis covers the first fifty pages of the first book without
giving away the  juicy  details.  Those of you that have already read the book
know  that I  haven't even gotten to the really  good stuff.  This is too good
to spoil.  It's  in  paperback  so it won't bust your wallet to read it. Trust
me.   Read  it during the summer when you  have time to get really involved in
it.
