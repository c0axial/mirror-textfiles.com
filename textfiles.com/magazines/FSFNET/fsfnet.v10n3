    Well, we've got  a couple bits of  news to relate, so  let me jump
right into  that. Firstly, there is  now an open discussion  group for
FSFnet readers  on the network  server CSNEWS@MAINE. Please  feel free
to read  and/or submit your  comments to  this group, as  it's primary
purpose is reader  feedback. Please note that CSNEWS  will ONLY accept
commands via  interactive messages; do NOT  send mail files to  it, as
they will  be discarded. Also  note that the subscribe  functions will
subscribe you  to the FORUM, not  to FSFnet itself. The  following are
some commands  you  might  find  useful in  checking  out this  forum.
Request the CSBB HELPNET file for details on how to append to it.

    The  other  bit of  news  is  that plans  are  being  made for  my
eventual  graduation.  After some  discussion  with  the authors,  the
current  plans are  for the  following. While  FSFnet will  stop being
produced,  the  Dargon  Project  will continue,  and  the  stories  it
produces  will  be  made  public  through  a  new  magazine  (possibly
dedicated  solely to  the  printing of  Dargon  stories). FSFnet  will
stop publication  during the summer,  and the new magazine  will begin
at that  time. Further  details are still  up in the  air, but  I will
continue to  post news  here about  what is going  on, and  how things
will change when  I leave. But we've still got  several more issues to
send out  before then,  and I'm  sure you'll enjoy  this one.  And, of
course, if  you have anything you'd  like to submit for  printing, get
in touch with me. Enjoy!

                      Worthy of the Title: Part I
    A  frantic, far-away  echo  shattered the  quiet  of the  library.
"Master Roisart, Master Roisart!"
    The  panic  in  the  voice  caused  Roisart  to  snatch  his  gaze
immediately from  the copy  of "Legends and  Myths of  Thasodonea" and
stared  instead at  the  open  doors of  the  library.  He could  hear
commotion down the  long halls of the old keep,  the doors that opened
and  shut in  quick,  startled  rhythm, the  running  of the  servants
called from  duties, the wails and  shouts. Over it all,  he heard the
call  still, ghastly  and  ghostly, frightened  and far-away.  "Master
Roisart! Master Roisart!"
    Young Roisart  stood, raced  across the  room. What  has happened?
the  young nobleman  wondered, concerned.  Has a  war come  to Dargon?
Although  the library  was  a  great room,  Roisart  soon reached  the
opened double doors and called out, "Here I am! What is it?"
    The heralding  servant who been  wailing his  name slid to  a stop
and then  turned to his  master. Fright and  despair on his  face, the
servant rolled  his eyes  and cried dramatically,"Oh,  Master Roisart,
go quickly to the study. The baron is dead!"
    Roisart paled  and his  eyes bulged,  as if  he had  suddenly been
stuck in the  stomach. "Dead? The baron dead?" But  he cannot be dead!
He is  healthy, and  only five and  forty! Quickly,  Roisart demanded,
"Where is my brother?"
    The  servant  gulped the  tears  he  wanted  to shed  and  replied
sorrowfully, "He is in the study, master. He has sent for you."
    With a  quick wave, Roisart dismissed  the near-blubbering servant
and rushed  with all his youth  and strength to the  study, the office
of  the baron--the  late  baron. His  blood beating  in  his ears,  he
threw open  the heavy door and  cried, "Luthias! What has  happened to
our father?"
    The face  that met  Roisart's was  the same as  his own:  the deep
brown   eyes;   the   straight,   aristocratic   nose;   the   smooth,
well-defined jaw;  the pinkish  lips, usually  merry with  smiles, now
twisted with  grief. Roisart's twin  looked him  in the eye  and said,
slowly and solemnly, "Roisart, our father is dead."
    "Dead?"  denied Roisart  scornfully. "Dead  how? Father  is young.
He has never been ill--"
    "Roisart," repeated  his twin  brother Luthias  deliberately, "our
father is dead."
    "But  what could  kill  our father?"  demanded  Roisart. "He's  as
strong as a horse."
    "No,  Roisart," sighed  Luthias, falling  heavily into  the padded
chair behind the desk. "The horse was stronger. Sit."
    With a  reluctant grimace, Roisart came  into the room and  sat in
another padded chair,  the one that faced his  father's desk. Memories
of his  father crowded his thoughts.  There was that time  that he and
his  twin Luthias,  very small  boys, had  squirmed in  this chair  as
their noble  father scolded them  for some forgotten offense.  And the
times that  they had brought their  school books in here  to study and
be near their  father. And the time when their  father had lifted them
both on his strong  shoulders to look at the lion's  head that hung on
the wall. His father was a strong man...
    "What do you mean," blurted Roisart, "the horse was stronger?"
    "Dragonfire threw him. Father's neck was broken."
    "Dragonfire?"  gasped Roisart.  "But, Luthias,  Dragonfire is  the
best trained  stallion in the  stables! Father trained him  himself! I
remember! And Father--Father  is the best horseman alive!  There is no
way that he could have been killed in that way!"
    Luthias closed his  eyes. "Roisart, there is no  doubt that Father
is dead. I  have seen the body."  He opened his eyes  again, stared at
his brother. "Do you wish to?"
    Roisart quieted  a little.  He kept Luthias'  gaze a  moment, then
looked at the  carpeted floor. "No, Luthias," he replied  in a muffled
way. "I want to remember him living, not dead."
    His father truly was dead. "But it wasn't the horse," he murmured.
    "What  does  it matter  what  it  was?" wondered  Luthias,  almost
snapping.  "There are  matters to  be attended  to. The  body must  be
prepared and  buried by sundown, as  is the custom. I  have called the
priests." Luthias  then waved at  a fine  piece of parchment  on their
father's desk.  "I am trying  to find words  to tell our  cousin, Lord
Dargon, of this. And I've sent for Manus."
    Roisart gave his twin a quizzical look. "Manus the Healer? Why?"
    Luthias  shrugged. "Father  deemed his  wise,  and so  do you,  my
brother. And there must, for the next five days, be a regent."
    Roisart quieted  and nodded.  "Yes, a regent,"  he agreed.  He had
forgotten for  a moment that  there were  five days between  this day,
the third  day of Melrin,  the Spring Festival,  and the third  day of
Yule,  when  he   and  Luthias  would  reach  the   age  of  majority,
twenty-one. Only then  would they be old enough to  rule the barony in
their father's place.
    "Luthias!" Roisart gasped urgently, "Which of us shall inherit?"
    Luthias scowled with  old ferocity. "Accursed be  that midwife who
neglected to note which of us is elder!"
    "You can't  blame her.  Mother was  dying, and  she was  trying to
save her."
    "She's caused  us more  problems--and Mother  died, in  any case,"
snapped Luthias. "And now there is no way to decide who is to rule."
    "I often  told Father  that he  should choose  one of  us," sighed
Roisart. "But  he wanted to  wait until  we were twenty-one,  until he
thought  we could  both  accept  his choice."  Roisart  thought for  a
moment. "Could he have left some will?"
    "I don't  know; I  didn't even think  of that,"  Luthias grumbled.
He began  to rummage  among the  papers on his  father's desk.  By the
time that  Luthias started to  search the desk's drawers,  Roisart was
lost   in   thought  once   more.   "Damnation!"   cried  Luthias   in
frustration. "Nothing!"
    "It  couldn't have  been  an accident,"  mumbled Roisart.  "Father
was too good a rider, and Dragonfire too good a horse."
    Luthias  slapped the  desk in  anger. "Roisart,  haven't you  been
listening? One of us  is soon to become Baron of  Connall, and with no
indication of  which of us  Father wished to  rule in his  place. None
at all!"
    "No papers?"
    Luthias  shook his  head. "Unless  there was  some other  place he
kept them."
    "Do you have the key to the locked drawer?"
    "Yes,   and  I've   already  looked.   Only  the   seal  and   the
proclamation that made him baron of Connall."
    "Nothing at  all, then,"  murmured Roisart. "He  never even  had a
favorite between us."
    Luthias smiled  affectionately at the  memory. "It was a  point of
honor for  him," Luthias  agreed. "He let  each of us  be who  we are,
and loved us both  equally for it." He scowled then.  "But it gives us
trouble now. How  are we supposed to determine which  of us shall next
be the Baron of Connall?"
    "We  have no  proof of  first-born," Roisart  began his  analysis.
"And  we  have no  proof  of  favoritism.  On  that, we  are  agreed."
Roisart looked  his twin  brother in  the eyes, the  eyes so  like his
own. "Luthias,  we have never  been able to  lie to one  another. Tell
me, then. Do you wish to rule in our father's place?"
    Luthias  gave his  brother  a look  of  consternation. "Rule?"  He
appeared to  be thinking  of the  possibility for  the first  time. "I
had always assumed that you would rule. You have read so much more..."
    "True, but  Father made certain  that we both were  learned enough
to rule well,"  Roisart argued. "And you are so  much better a fighter
than I."
    At  this, Luthias  smiled, almost  wickedly. "Don't  underestimate
yourself, Roisart. I wouldn't want to fight against you."
    "Thanks," Roisart  replied almost ruefully. "But  answer me, twin.
Do you wish to rule?"
    Luthias let  the possibilities roam  his mind, then said,  "I will
if  I must,  Roisart." His  voice was  strong, calm,  and even,  as if
Luthias were  older than his almost  twenty-one years. "But I  have no
great wish to be a Baron and rule."
    Roisart sighed  like a man  beneath a heavy  stone. "Nor do  I, my
brother. Nor do I."
    "It must  be decided,  Roisart," Luthias stated.  "And it  must be
decided soon."
    Roisart mentally  sought possibilities.  "We could gamble  for it.
Cast dice..."
    Luthias stared  at his  brother with  surprise and  disbelief, and
when  he saw  that Roisart  was completely  serious, Luthias  began to
laugh. "Oh,  Roisart, thank you. What  would I do without  you? In the
midst of  grieving a  father and  trying to solve  a dilemma  that has
plagued us throughout our lives, you and only you can make me laugh."
    Roisart wrinkled  his brow  and looked  at his  twin brother  in a
confused way. "But Luthias, I meant it. We should cast dice."
    Still smiling, Luthias  continued. "I know you  meant it, Roisart,
and that  was what  I found  amusing. Cast dice?  Would that  hold any
authenticity before the  court? You've got to be  more practical about
things like this, Roisart."
    "Practical? Authenticity?"  stammered Roisart in  mock indignance.
Even  in  grief,  his  twin  could still  make  him  play.  "You  wish
practicality and authenticity,  my brother? Then why don't  we just go
to our  cousin lord  Dargon and  let him  decide? What  more authentic
and more  practical solution could  you want?  We should let  our Lord
decide, and save ourselves the trouble."
    "That,"  Luthias agreed,  "is the  wisest thing  you've said  in a
week, Roisart."
    "Then I'll  have the horses  saddled," Roisart offered as  he rose
from the chair.
    "Have you  forgotten that  our father needs  yet to  be entombed?"
Luthias asked with stern gravity.
    Roisart started.  He had  forgotten. In  that golden  moment, when
he and  his brother had  teased each  other, when everything  was like
it had  been before,  Roisart had forgotten.  Now, the  knowledge came
back like a stinging boomerang. His father had died.
    "There is much to be done," Luthias softly said.
    "You do  it, then," Roisart  urged his brother, thoughts  of their
father's  death  ruling  out  all   else.  Luthias  watched  his  twin
sympathetically  while Roisart  buried his  head in  his hands.  "No,"
mumbled the young nobleman.
    Luthias left the  desk and went to  his brother. He put  a hand on
Roisart's shoulder. "No?"
    "Our  father  did  not  die,"  Roisart  declared  with  passionate
conviction.  His head  flew  from his  hands,  and Luthias,  startled,
moved backwards. "And I'm going to go and find what murdered him!"
    Murdered! His father  was dead! The knowledge  screamed inside him
for release,  for action. And there,  in the study, Roisart  cried out
like a  small boy and  began to weep.  And Luthias, the  practical one
who knew that crying  for a dead man was useless,  put his arms around
his beloved brother,  and, as they had done all  things in their life,
they wept for their noble father together.

    Roisart  adamantly   insisted  on   riding  his   father's  prized
stallion Dragonfire  to Dargon, despite  the grooms' warnings  of evil
spirits. Roisart,  though he believed  in a spirit world,  scoffed the
very idea  and declared  above the fearful  projections of  the grooms
that he  would ride his  father's horse, damn  it, and that  was that.
Luthias,  too,  scorned  the  idea  of  evil  spirits  possessing  his
father's steed,  but watched  his twin with  worried eyes.  After all,
that  strong,  red mount  had  thrown  their  father yesterday  to  an
unexpected death.
    And  Roisart had  been behaving  strangely. Yesterday,  just after
the  twins jointly  mourned their  father in  the privacy  of the  old
study, Roisart  had burst out of  the keep's gates, taking  with him a
groom, the groom  which had accompanied the twins' father  on his last
ride. No, the  young lord hadn't been acting desperate,  the groom had
told Roisart, just a  wee strange. They had gone back  to the scene of
the death (there  was still blood on the new  grass), and Lord Roisart
acted as a  hound on the hunt, dashing here,  darting there, rummaging
through the  brush. And  when they  had returned,  Roisart, withdrawn,
had  refused to  speak to  old  Manus, who  had just  arrived for  the
funeral, and  didn't even deign to  speak to his own  twin. After they
had  entombed  their  dear  father,  Roisart  returned  to  normal--as
normal as a grieving son could be--but still, Luthias worried.
    Luthias motioned  the protesting grooms  to be silent. "We  have a
right  to ride  our father's  horse," Luthias  told them  gently. With
another  wave,  he dismissed  them.  When  they  had gone,  he  asked,
"Twin, are you all right?"
    "Yes, I... I just wanted to ride him. He was Father's favorite."
    That was  true, and it  was for  good reasons that  Dragonfire was
the  late  Baron's favored  horse.  Luthias  admitted to  himself  the
incredibility  of  his  father  dying on  horseback,  especially  that
particular horse's back.  He didn't press the  issue. Instead, Luthias
gazed up at the dark, pre-dawn sky. "We should get moving."
    Roisart  nodded,  and motioned  for  the  brace  of guards  and  a
manservant to  urge on their  mounts. Stately, but  not lethargically,
the party moved forward toward Dargon.
    It wouldn't  be a long  trip, thankfully. The earliness,  on which
had decided  the night before,  would shorten the trip  more. Besides,
the brothers  had no  wish to  try to wade  their good  horses through
the crowds which  would be soon flooding  the roads on the  way to the
Melrin festival.  And neither  wanted to deal  with the  curiosity and
pity of a peasant crowd seeing twin noblemen dressed in mourning blue.
    Yes, it was  best to get to Dargon early.  The earlier the better;
the  earlier they  arrived,  the sooner  their  cousin Clifton  Dargon
could decide,  once and  forever, which  of the two  was worthy  to be
Baron of  Connall. And the  sooner that  was decided, the  easier both
twins would feel.
    The  little  band moved  ahead,  each  of  the members  buried  in
thought. Luthias looked  at his twin, and knew that  Roisart was still
wondering how  their father could  have died like that.  Concerned for
his brother,  and, indeed, what  had happened to his  father, Luthias,
too, considered, and kept turning his head to watch his twin.
    After  about  an  hour--halfway   to  Dargon--Roisart  caught  his
brother's eye  and almost  smiled. "Father always  taught us  that the
good fighters live long. It still makes me--"
    Roisart felt  something hit  him hard, and  at once  found himself
on the  hard, startling ground. For  a wild, wicked moment  he thought
it was true: Dragonfire is a mad horse and he threw my Father!
    Then he saw  before him the sly-eyed, leather-clad man  who held a
steel  knife sharpened  to  the point  of beauty.  Then  he heard  the
manservant's cry, "Masters! Thieves!"
    Roisart  erupted from  a form  lying prostrate  in the  dust to  a
poised  warrior.  It took  him  only  a  moment  of squinting  in  the
half-dark  to take  in the  situation: seven  thieves, all  dressed in
tooled leather armor,  all armed with swords and knives.  And the near
darkness which  made the  counting difficult  worked to  his advantage
and Luthias';  it was easier  to see the  light brown of  leather than
the blue of mourning in the pre-dawn light.
    Luthias had already  taken the battle and his good  sword into his
own hands. Instinctively,  Luthias was battling a brigand  on one side
of  his  horse; the  opposite  foot  automatically kicked  at  another
oncoming  thief. Without  blinking  from the  divided effort,  Luthias
continued to  thrust and  parry, to  swirl his  sword in  the darkened
air against the severely outmatched thief.
    Roisart heard  the dull,  weighty footfalls  of an  charging thief
and  poised himself  for the  fight. Using  every instinct  his father
had  branded onto  his  brain, Roisart  the  warrior side-stepped  the
thief's attack  and thrust  his blade into  the peasant's  back. Blood
from the spurting heart sprayed him once, then subsided.
    Abruptly,  his  breath  was  stopped, and  there  was  a  terrible
weight on  his back. A mighty  snake constricted his throat.  His eyes
bugged; in  the shadowy  light, he saw  the manservant's  head explode
into pulp.  One of them  must have a  crossbow, he thought.  Angry and
desperate, he flung  the assailant on his back toward  the ugly sight.
As  the first  beam  of  dawnlight reached  him,  Roisart plunged  his
sword into the second thief.
    Two thieves were  fencing with Roisart's brother,  and trampling a
dead  comrade beneath  their feet.  Kick one,  stab the  other, quick,
parry, Luthias!  But Luthias  was fast, well-trained.  Roisart scanned
the area.  One of the  guards was dead.  The old manservant  was dead.
The  other guard  was ineptly  trying to  beat off  the remaining  two
that plagued him.
    Roisart   sprinted   to   his  servant's   rescue,   screaming   a
frightening but  meaningless sound that  masqueraded as a  battle cry,
and swinging his  sword above his head. Roisart saw  his guard fall in
seeming terror, saw  a thief fall from his bloodied  blade, chased the
one who tried to run away.
    But  he was  tripped,  and  fell onto  one  of  the thieves'  dead
bodies. His face  flopped onto the fatal wound received  by his guard.
Warm  blood gently  blushed  his cheeks.  Like a  man  suspended in  a
dream,  he watched  as the  fleeing scoundrel  was joined  by another,
and together they ducked into the shadows of the woods.
    Winded, Roisart lie still and gazed at the corpses.
    "Roisart!" A  voice was  calling him. He  heard the  careful steps
of a well-trained horse. "Roisart! Are you all right?"
    Good  Luthias. Roisart  scrutinized  the leather,  the blade,  the
corpse. He  managed to draw  a breath and  speak. "These are  too fine
for common brigands," he croaked.
    Luthias  rolled his  eyes and  groaned internally.  "We've got  to
get out  of here,  Roisart! Two are  on their way  to get  others. Are
you hurt? Can you ride?"
    Meticulously, Roisart  pulled himself to a  sitting, then standing
position.  Luthias saw  the  blood  on his  brothers  face and  paled.
Frantic, he  began to dismount.  "No, I'm all right,"  Roisart assured
his brother,  holding up a  hand to stay  him. "Don't worry,  twin. It
isn't  mine.  I'm  all  right.  I'm not  even  bruised.  I  can  ride.
Luthias,  look at  this."  He bent  and retrieved  a  sword. "Look  at
this. These were no common thieves, Luthias."
    Luthias  whistled  at  Dragonfire,   who  neighed  once  and  came
quickly to  Luthias' call.  "Quickly, Roisart. We  must get  to Dargon
before they can return with more."
    Graceful as  a acrobat, Roisart vaulted  onto Dragonfire's waiting
saddle. "Luthias, this may not be--"
    "Never  mind!"  Luthias  interrupted harshly.  "Let's  leave  this
place, before we're butchered! Come!"
    Spurring their steeds, the twins raced to the city of Dargon.

    The Lord  of Dargon's  hardened guardians  of the  Keep considered
screaming  or fleeing  from the  terrible apparition  which confronted
them first thing in  the morning on the fourth of  Melrin. A red horse
and a  black one, both  in a lather,  scattered a few  early travelers
from the  road as they  charged up to the  gates of Dargon  Keep. Upon
the horses were  twin death-riders, dressed in  death-blue, with faces
out of nightmares. The  grisly visage of the one on  the red mount was
streaked  with  drying blood;  the  countenance  of  the other  was  a
horrid purple on one side, deathly pale on the other.
    But the  sergeant had  long been  a veteran,  who had  just joined
the  company after  returning from  the  wars where  he had  witnessed
many deaths. Death,  even delivered by death-riders,  inspired no fear
in him. "Who comes, in the name of Dargon?" he demanded boldly.
    The  one upon  the black  horse,  the one  with the  mockery of  a
harlequin face spoke,  and his voice was as loud,  as bold, as fierce,
as  the  sergeant.  "I  am   Luthias  Connall.  He--"  One  apparition
motioned  to the  other. "--is  my brother,  Roisart Connall.  We have
come to see the Lord of Dargon. Admit us!"
    These ghostly  horrors, sons to  the Baron of Connall?  The guards
muttered  their doubt  amongst  themselves.  The sergeant  scrutinized
them. The blood  and the bruise made recognition  near impossible, and
he had  never seen the sons  of Connall, only the  Baron himself. "You
are unfit to see the Lord," snapped the sergeant.
    "When are  men unfit to  see the  son of their  father's brother?"
Roisart shouted angrily.
    "Admit us," demanded Luthias fiercely. "It is urgent!"
    "What  is  happening  here?"  asked  another  voice.  Luthias  and
Roisart  exchanged  glances  and  expelled  a  simultaneous,  relieved
sigh.  Bartol, bard  and  personal  body guard  to  their cousin  Lord
Dargon,  had arrived,  thanks  to  the gods.  Neither  twin wished  to
argue with this new sergeant all day.
    Bartol saw  the double terror  before the  gate and stared  at the
twins for  a moment.  The gaze  was intense, searching  for a  clue to
identity beneath  the defacings of  the previous scuffle.  Then Bartol
ordered, "Admit Masters Roisart and Luthias--now."
    The sergeant  turned away,  giving the twins  a look  askance. "Do
as he says," he grumbled.
    Reluctantly,  the guards  opened the  heavy gates,  all the  while
muttering amongst  themselves. Bartol bowed  at the noble  brothers as
the  urged  their  exhausted  steeds  into  the  courtyard.  "Grooms!"
called  the bard.  Two lads--hardly  old enough  to be  called grooms,
Roisart thought--ran forward to lead their mounts away.
    "See  they're   brushed  and  taken  care   of,"  Luthias  ordered
sternly. He dismounted as if he were aching all over.
    The  so-called  grooms  mumbled  affirmations and  led  the  tired
horses  away.  Bartol  looked  after  them  and  then  turned  to  the
brothers. "Masters, what has happened?"
    Roisart  appeared  pensive;  Luthias  scowled. "We  must  see  our
cousin, Lord Dargon."
    "He's not  yet risen, but I  shall call him," promised  Bartol. He
looked quickly  around the  courtyard. "Nidh'r," he  called to  one of
the  servants unloading  a wagon  filled with  new tables,  "come show
Master Roisart and Master Luthias to the study."
    The strong youth  that was Nidh'r joined the twins,  then led them
through the  familiar halls  of Dargon keep  to their  cousin's study.
Often, the  twins had played in  this Keep, when their  father and his
brother, the  late Lord of Dargon,  were both alive. After  that, when
the  twins  were  young  men,  and Clifton  Dargon,  six  years  their
senior, had  become lord,  Luthias and  Roisart had  accompanied their
father to  the Keep for  balls, banquets,  and other affairs  of state
and society.
    It had  been nearly six months  since they had been  here, though;
snowy, treacherous roads  halted all noble society  gatherings for the
winter. But when  the Melrin festival came, all  the festivities began
again with the Melrin Ball, sponsored by Lord Dargon himself.
    Nidh'r bowed  the twins into  the study and seemingly  melted into
the  castle.  Too weary  to  fall  into  chairs, Roisart  and  Luthias
rested on their feet a moment, waiting for their cousin.
    "Roisart and  Luthias?" they heard suddenly.  Their cousin's voice
was muffled  by the  door in  back of the  study. "Of  course, they're
here, Bartol.  The ball  is tomorrow  night. They  and mine  uncle are
supposed to be here. What do they want to see me so early for?"
    The door  in the back of  the study opened in  one, swift movement
to reveal  Lord Clifton Dargon,  who stopped  short and stared  at his
cousins.  They,  too tired  to  speak,  returned  the gaze.  They  saw
Clifton,  Lord   of  Dargon,   yet  another  version   of  themselves.
Clifton's face  wore a startled  expression, but otherwise,  he looked
alike enough  unto the  twins to  be their  brother. He  stood taller,
however,  perhaps due  to his  greater age,  and the  fairy which  had
brushed  the twins'  dark  hair with  a bit  of  auburn had  neglected
their cousin. But the eyes were the same, dark, and full of concern.
    "My  god," the  Lord  of  Dargon finally  said,  "what befell  you
two?"  Clifton stared  at their  faces.  "Are you  all right?  Bartol,
call Griswald."  The bard  crossed the  room, and  stuck his  head out
the door.  Dargon continued  his inspection. "Roisart,"  he continued,
gazing at the  neckline of the one twin's mourning  clothes, "you look
like someone hung  you and slit your throat. You  had better sit down.
Luthias,  what happened  to  you?"  The blue  of  the clothes  finally
washed over Dargon. "My god!" he cried. "Who are you mourning?"
    "Father,"   Luthias   announced    stoically,   "died   yesterday.
Dragonfire threw him."
    Suddenly, Dargon's  face went  white. Bartol,  at the  door, began
to  laugh. "Dragonfire  threw  your father?  Your  father, who  almost
invented   horsemanship?"  Bartol   gasped  between   guffaws.  "Come,
masters,  I know  that jesting  is  a great  part of  Melrin, but  you
could have at least thought of something more credible."
    "That's just  it, Bartol,"  Clifton said  with a  note of  doom in
his voice.  "If it were a  jest, my cousins certainly  would have come
up with  a more believable story  than that. And they  wouldn't appear
here  in  mourning clothes  stained  by  blood."  The Lord  of  Dargon
looked  from  one  twin  to  the  other.  "Someone  assassinated  your
father. And it looks like they tried the same upon you."
    "They  weren't common  thieves who  attacked us,"  Roisart agreed.
"Their  weaponry was  too superior  for  that. And  I rode  Dragonfire
here. He's still the best stallion ever trained."
    Dargon  nodded. "Yes,  Roisart.  It's absurd  to  think that  your
father was killed on horseback."
    "But  it  isn't  practical  to  think  him  assassinated  either,"
Luthias contended. "Why would anyone want to kill our father?"
    "Probably for  the same  reason that they've  been trying  to kill
me,"  sighed Lord  Dargon. "Luthias,  sit down,  before you  collapse.
Bartol,  get  some  breakfast  for  my  cousins."  Bartol  nodded  and
slipped out the  door. Dargon stared at Luthias until  the portal shut
again. "What happened to your face?"
    "One  of  the  bastards  threw  a rock  at  me,"  Luthias  quickly
brushed the bruise away. "I'm all right."
    "And I  was lucky enough to  be covered with someone  else's blood
instead  of  my  own,"  Roisart  told  his  cousin.  "But  this  isn't
important. How long have people been out to assassinate you, Clifton?"
    Dargon  shrugged and  fell into  his  chair. "A  few years.  We've
been  unsuccessful in  tracing it."  He  grimaced. "I  had feared  for
your father, as he was my heir."
    "Did Father know of this?" Luthias wondered, finally sitting.
    Again, Dargon  nodded. "Of  course. I wouldn't  keep a  thing like
this from  him. I  set great  store upon your  father and  his advice,
and I needed it badly at the time."
    "We  were never  told,"  Roisart informed  the  lord. "That  isn't
like Father."
    Clifton smiled.  "Not like him?  Roisart, remember, you  were only
sixteen? seventeen,  perhaps? when this  all started. To  your father,
you  were still  boys. I  wanted  to have  you told,  but your  father
refused." The  Lord of Dargon again  became grave. "It appears  that I
was correct  in thinking that you,  cousins, were also in  danger. And
now, that your father is dead..."
    "Yes," began Luthias "Now that father is dead, we have a problem."
    Clifton Dargon nodded.  "I shall have to send some  body guards to
attend you. You're not safe."
    "Clifton,"  Luthias' voice  insisted  on attention,  "there is  no
Baron of  Connall. We don't know  who is the elder,  and Father didn't
have a  favorite. We have  six days--you  have six days--to  appoint a
Baron. Manus  is regent now, but  we become adults soon,  Clifton, and
this must be decided quickly."
    "I  can't  put  one  of  you  in  that  sort  of  danger,"  Dargon
declared. "I won't do it. You're in peril enough already."
    "Clifton, it must be done," Luthias reminded him roughly.
    "Listen,  Luthias," the  Lord  of Dargon  requested politely,  but
with a hard  edge in his voice. Roisart realized  that his cousin must
have been  feeling very  frustrated. Here  Clifton's uncle  were dead,
probably  because he  had  been Dargon's  heir, his  own  life was  in
peril, and  he had no idea  who was seeking  to end his life  and why.
And   now  there   was  Luthias.   Roisart  understood   his  cousin's
exasperation. Luthias could  drive one to distraction  by just looking
at the surface and acting.
    "Listen,  Luthias," Dargon  began again,  "if  I name  one of  you
Baron  of Connall,  I'm  sentencing you  to death.  Any  favor I  show
either of  you will get you  killed. You're my heirs  now, and whoever
killed your  father, whoever  is trying  to kill me,  may also  try to
kill  you.  If  I  give  proof  that  I  think  one  of  you  is  more
worthwhile,  you'd be  struck down  in an  instant, and  the other  of
your would be set up as a puppet in their plans--whatever they are."
    Dargon paused  and took  a heavy  breath. "And I  have no  wish to
pit you one against the other. Decide yourselves."
    "Decide  ourselves?" Luthias  echoed,  incredulous. "Clifton,  how
are we supposed to know who would be a better--"
    Luthias  and his  twin twisted  as  the door  behind them  opened.
Lord Dargon  looked above their  heads. "Ah. Griswald. Good.  Come in,
and attend to my cousins."
    The old  physician, his  hair still  unkempt from  sleep, shuffled
into the room and  dropped a leather case of sorts.  He looked at each
of the  twins, then  turned his attention  to Roisart.  "What happened
to you two?" he grumbled, examining Roisart's bloody brow.
    "We  were  attacked  by  brigands," Roisart  explained.  "I'm  all
right, Griswald. It's their blood, not mine."
    Griswald  crossed  over  to  Luthias then  and  turned  the  young
lord's head  towards him. "Hmmm," he  fussed. "Nasty. I can  take care
of  that though."  He  stooped, opened  his case  and  fumbled in  it.
"What's the mourning for? It's Melrin."
    "Our father died yesterday," Luthias told him simply.
    Griswald  appeared to  flinch, or  to shudder.  He quickly  looked
Luthias in  the eye, then  turned back to  his bag and  began fumbling
again. In a  moment, he gave a gruff, mumbled,  "Sorry." Then: "He was
a good man."
    "Thank  you,  Griswald,"  Roisart  answered  kindly,  although  he
thought the eulogy sounded a little grudging, or angry, perhaps.
    Griswald  stood  quickly,  a  little  vial  in  his  hand.  "Here,
youngster,  this  way," he  beckoned  Luthias.  The term  annoyed  the
young  nobleman,  a nice  cream  to  his  anger.  But he  turned,  and
Griswald poured some  of what was in  the vial onto his  hand. Then he
gingerly began  to rub it into  Luthias' bruise. "You be  careful now,
lad," he  said gruffly. He turned  abruptly to Lord Dargon.  "He'll be
all right. I'm going back to bed."
    Without  a  dismissal,  Griswald  turned and  left,  slamming  the
heavy door behind him.
    "What's  wrong with  him?"  Luthias wondered,  trying  to crack  a
smile. His face  was already beginning to feel better,  and the violet
hue was fading.
    Dargon shrugged. "He's  not usually this cranky when  we wake him.
I would think that a physician like him would be used to it."
    "Perhaps  something  is  ailing   him,"  Roisart  speculated.  "Or
something is weighing on his mind."
    Clifton shrugged.  "God knows. Griswald rarely  speaks." He looked
at his  cousins. "You  know you are  welcome to stay  here with  me. I
was expecting you for the festival. And you will come to the ball."
    "You would  think that  civilized custom would  give us  more time
to mourn our father," Roisart complained angrily.
    "Life goes on, Roisart," Luthias said. "And so must we."
    There was a knock on the door. "Yes?" asked the Lord.
    "It's me, sir," Bartol called.
    "It's all right," Dargon answered. "Come in."
    "The cook  will have breakfast ready  for you and the  young lords
shortly,"  the bard  informed them,  entering and  shutting the  door.
"The south dining room is being prepared."
    Clifton  nodded. "Thank  you, Bartol."  To his  cousins, he  said,
"There have been  rooms prepared for you down the  hall. Why don't you
refresh yourselves and change clothes before we eat?"
    Luthias rose and stretched. "Good idea, Clifton. Roisart?"
    His twin stood as well. "Coming. We'll meet you there, Clifton."
    Bartol and Lord  Dargon watched at the twin nobles  left the room.
The bard shut the door behind them and turned to his lord.
    "I  want a  watch kept  on  my kinsmen,  Bartol," Dargon  ordered.
"See to  it personally. I'm certain  that, being here, they'll  go out
into the festival. They may be in danger. I don't want them harmed."
    "It will be done, my lord," Bartol answered.

    A  strange rhythmic  knock  sounded at  Griswald's door.  Hastily,
Griswald turned  from his  work--ruining it  in his  hurry--and opened
the  door. There  stood that  Lek Pyle,  the despicable  merchant that
had threatened  Griswald so many  years ago  to join this  insane plot
against the Lord of Dargon.
    "You killed Fionn Connall," Griswald accused.
    "Of course I  did," Pyle snapped. "Do  you think I want  him to be
the Lord of Dargon after we are rid of Clifton? He was too strong."
    "And now  what do  you do?" the  physician challenged.  "Now there
are twin heirs. Which shall die and which shall live?"
    Lek Pyle displayed  a wicked grin. "I've already  decided that, my
dear  Griswald. I've  had  them watched.  Their  guardian, Manus,  has
already told  me what I  want to know of  them. When we  rid ourselves
of  Clifton's menace,  we will  dispose  of Luthias  Connall as  well.
Like  his father,  he  is too  strong,  and not  wont  to listen.  The
other--Roisart,  is he?--is  also quite  a  strong young  man, but  he
will  listen to  arguements, and  it will  be easy  to trick  him into
convincing the King to go to war with Bichu."
    Griswald felt  angry, uncomfortable. "What  now, then? When  do we
end this insanity, Pyle?"
    "Soon, dear  Griswald, soon,"  Lek Pyle  vowed. "Tommorow,  at the
Melrin ball. I've  already arranged for two crossbowmen.  They will be
here tommorow afternoon.  I need you to mix poison,  quick poison, for
the bolts."
    Griswald's discomfort  turned to near  sickness. Was he  to poison
one of the men he had just healed?
    Pyle  saw  the near-ready  protest  in  Griswald's eyes.  "Do  it,
Griswald. Remember,"  he threatened through  his teeth, "your  life is
in my hands."
    As  it  had been  from  the  beginning, Griswald  remembered  with
bitterness. He turned to the worktable. "It will be done."
    Lek   Pyle  smiled.   "Good."   The   merchant  looked   intensely
satisfied.  "Now, dear  physician, I  must leave.  I, too,  attend the
ball."  At  Griswald's  surprised  expression, Pyle  added,  "Did  you
think I would miss my triumph?"
    The merchant left the keep laughing.

                           The Defiant Vector
    I don't  like three space.  I don't like it  at all. There  has to
be  more  to   life  than  just  up,  down,   left,  right,  forwards,
backwards. I  wish I  could travel  in four space  or even  five space
but the  systems manager has  stuck me in  this lousy three  space and
there is no way I can get out.
    I am a vector  and let me tell you, it's no fun.  Even though I go
through  different  transformations,  I  am still  a  vector.  And  no
matter how I  am transformed, I still  end up in the  same lousy three
space.  Even  if  I  could  only  just once  in  awhile,  get  into  a
different sub-three  space of four space  it wouldn't be too  bad. But
of  course I  am  stuck in  this  same  lousy three  space  and it  is
pissing me off.
    It must  be different  for you.  After all  you are  a hyper-cube.
You can  extend into  four space.  I know that  there are  those worse
off than  me. Like  some vectors  are stuck in  two space,  flatland I
think   it's  called.   And  some   aren't  allowed   to  go   through
transformations as  often as  I do.  But I'm better  than they  are, I
deserve  some respect.  After all,  wasn't it  me who  traced out  the
path of  the positron in the  nuclear labratory? And wasn't  it me who
traced out  the path  of all  of the  other particles  that physicists
have come up  with? But does the  systems manager care? No  not in the
least. Why  doesn't he give  me the respect I  deserve? But here  I am
in three space and I will probably stay here for all eternity.
    Yes, I have  met other shapes before, I mean  other than yourself.
I met  a hyperbolic  paraboloid once. He  was still  three dimensional
but I would  like to be one of  them. It would be better  than being a
vector  I can  say that  much.  I have  heard once  from someone  that
hyperbolic paraboloids are  good at sex. After giving  it some thought
I imagine  they would be.  After all they do  have a hump.  But that's
not really what  I like about them.  I like the way they  extend in an
infinite direction  both ways. Sort of  like a line but  even more so.
I  never was  able to  extend in  an infinite  direction. My  norm has
changed once in awhile but that of course is not the same thing.
    I  also met  a hyper-sphere  one time.  Not too  interesting. They
act like  they're gods or  something but  they really aren't.  So they
extend around  in a  perfect circle  in four  dimensions. Big  deal! I
never did  understand why the greeks  were so fond of  circles. I know
that they symbolized  perfection but so what? What  is perfect anyway?
That's another  reason why I  like the hyperbolic paraboloid  so much.
It represents chaos  and disorder and that's what  the universe should
be represented  as. Not  some prissy,  goody-two-shoes, kind  of thing
like  the  circle,  or  the  sphere,  or  the  hyper-sphere,  but  the
hyperbolic paraboloid. That's what the universe should be to me.
    I wonder what  shape the systems manager is. I  bet he's some kind
of  hyper-hyper-sphere, or  maybe  he exists  in  infinite space,  the
lucky bastard.  But whatever he is  I bet he isn't  some stupid vector
or something.  Maybe he can  be anything he  wants any time  he wants.
Now that would be  the ultimate insult. Who does he  think he is, God?
I think this systems manager should be overthrown and defeated.
    I  would like  to fight  the  systems manager.  I know  I will  be
defeated  but I  must try.  Maybe if  I get  a whole  bunch of  shapes
together we  could overthrow the  systems manager. I could  get some
hyperbolic paraboloids and  some hyper-cubes and I  wouldn't even mind
it if  we had some dodecahedrons  in the group. I  like dodecahedrons.
Or  maybe even  some pyramids  or maybe  even some  hyper-lemniscates.
But I don't  want any circles or spheres or  hyper-spheres or anything
of that sort into  the group. They are too snobish. But  if we got all
of  these  shapes together  I  know  we  could overthrow  the  systems
manager.  Then everyone  could be  anything they  want to  be and  the
universe would be a much better place to live in.

                               The Quest

                 The Beast before me gave a cry of joy
              and I saw delight in its eyes at my demise.
               I was filled with a hate for the creature
                          who loved death so.

                          With a mighty heave
                         I brought up my blade
                             and slew him.
                           And then I cried.

                  My tears were for the waste of life
                     My tears were for the tortured
                     My tears burned with the hate
                       of all those causing pain.

                      So my journey became a quest
                    which I would carry far and wide
                        To the ends of the world
                         Wherever death hides.

                         A quest, a great quest
                     to be told throughout the ages
                          of a single warrior
                         trying to stop Death.

                     As the fame of my quest spread
                people gazed at themselves and wondered
         They put down their weapons and applauded my approach
              and the death dissappeared, and I was glad.

                  Then a new realization came upon me
                    as I fought for my great cause,
             that Death may have been banished for a time,
                  yet it had reappeared, in form anew

                        I shrank back in horror
                        and saw what I had done
             I had taken death from the hands of the masses
                        and become Death itself.

                           And so I realized
                            after many years
                     that Death cannot be banished
                        that he always reappears

                      At least I did what I could
                   and brought away death for a time
                        The happiness I brought
                 brightened the day, if but for a while

                 And now I embark upon my last journey
                        to a land far, far away
               and once again remove Death from the world
                until it manefests itself in a new form
                          and darkens the day

                    I wonder if I will meet another,
                        who rose up in my place
                 and once again started my grand quest,
                     and came upon the realization
                that ended my quest and made me depart.

                             Quest: Part I

                                 Prolog
    The hamlet of  Trasath was not a happy place.  Too recently in the
memory of  its population tragedy  had struck,  and it had  warped all
of their lives.  By the Kingdom's reckoning it was  in the eighth year
of King  Arenth's reign that the  snow started falling early  and thaw
came  late.  To complicate  the  already  tense  situation of  a  long
winter on  normal stores,  the weather  was so bad  that it  drove the
wolves from  the hills as far  north and west as  Trasath. The village
wasn't  prepared  for  such  an  unheard of  occurence,  nor  for  the
ferocity and  ravening hunger  of the  misplaced predators.  That came
to be known  as the Wolf Winter  and it claimed more than  half of the
lives in Trasath.
    Certain people  in the village  saw the tragedy as  an opportunity
to gain  power and prestige. Forces  were called on, pacts  were made,
and  assurances were  given to  the remaining  populace that  the Wolf
Winter would never come  again - as long as everyone  did as they were
told. Even 12  years later, the effects of the  Wolf Winter were still
being felt in Trasath.

    I knelt beside  Keryin's grave as I had so  many times before, and
placed  the roses  I  carried before  the  simple cruciform  headstone
that bore  only her  name. I  had missed  my sister  from the  day she
died  five years  ago, but  now I  would miss  her even  more. For  my
father was  sending me to  the ducal  seat, Dargon, to  be apprenticed
to his  sister's husband as a  blacksmith. It wasn't what  I wanted to
do - either  go to Dargon or become  a blacksmith - but I  had to obey
my father. What  made the decision strange, however, was  that I would
be the  first person  to leave  Trasath for any  length of  time since
the Wolf Winter  12 years ago. Trasath had yet  to really recover from
that,  and it  needed every  able hand  to keep  it alive,  yet I  was
being sent away. It didn't make sense.
    Even so,  I was going.  I would miss  my parents and  the village,
but I would miss  Keryin the most. She was fifteen  when she died, and
I  only nine,  but  we were  still  best of  friends.  Even her  grave
seemed  able  to  comfort  me  when  I  was  feeling  very  lonely  or
depressed. I  said good-bye to  her yet  again, rose, and  walked back
to the house.
    The circumstances  of Keryin's  death were still  a mystery  to me
so  long after  the fact.  No one  would answer  the questions  of her
grieving brother.  In fact, it  seemed as if I  had been the  only one
to  grieve -  the rest  of  the villagers  hardly let  it upset  their
daily routines.  I couldn't even learn  whether she had been  slain by
an animal,  or had  been taken  by a  sudden illness  in her  bed. The
mystery was  just one small  piece of  strangeness in a  strange town,
though. I hadn't  travelled far in my fourteen years  (in fact, not at
all), but  I was  sure from the  wandering tale-tellers'  stories that
Trasath  was not  like most  small villages.  Here the  neighbors were
all dour  and taciturn,  each careful  about seeming  to mind  his own
business  while  trying  to  mind  everyone  else's.  There  was  much
sneaking and  much suspicion and  at times I  thought I would  be glad
to get out of such a place.
    As I  approached my home,  I heard voices  within. Two men  by the
sound of  it, and they must  have been in  the front room as  well for
they weren't speaking very loudly.
    The first  voice was that  of Master Dineel, the  tavern-keeper. I
caught  him in  mid-sentence  and  the part  I  heard  made no  sense.
Neither did  the tone  of his  voice - it  was a  forceful, commanding
tone such as I  had never heard before. The part  I heard was, "...cul
is not pleased by this!"
    My father,  the other voice,  replied as  if to a  superior, which
Master   Dineel   wasn't   as   far   as  I   knew.   "My   Lord,   my
brother-by-marriage is  expecting the boy  and it would be  strange to
forbid him to leave  now. To do so would cause talk  in Dargon. So, he
must go  whether you  will or  no. I...I  just could  not bear  to put
another at risk..."
    "Enough!"  said  Master  Dineel.  "We will  discuss  this  further
later, in  a more private  place. But know this  now: we do  not allow
our rules  to be flaunted  without price. If  the boy goes  to Dargon,
you will pay with more certainty than if he stayed. Farewell."
    I ducked  out of  sight as  the tavern-keeper  stormed out  of the
house. I was  quite confused by the conversation. I  was sure they had
been talking  about me,  but I didn't  know in what  way. I  knew that
sending me  away was strange but  why would Master Dineel  threaten my
father for doing it?
    I  entered  the  house  prepared  to  question  Father  about  it,
sensing that  some of  the mystery  of Trasath  might be  explained by
his answer, but  he was briskly cheerful  to me and didn't  let me get
in a word as  he asked me whether I was ready to  leave and telling me
what it would  be like living in  a big city like Dargon.  I knew that
there was  worry of some  kind behind his talk  for my father  was not
normally so effusive.  I wanted to help him, make  him less afraid and
less unhappy,  but I  didn't know  how. So I  listened to  his stories
and his advice as we waited for my Uncle to arrive.
    Shortly before  Uncle Lavran rode  up, I  asked my father,  "Can I
come  back  and be  Trasath's  blacksmith  when  Uncle has  taught  me
everything?"  His silence  went on  for a  long time,  and finally  he
replied  slowly and  sadly,  "No,  son, I  think  you  should stay  in
Dargon.  Smith Braden's  already teaching  his  son his  trade, so  we
don't  need a  'smith here.  Stay  in Dargon  and make  a good  living
there -  make a new life  for yourself and forget  Trasath altogether.
Lavran's a good  man - my dad  wouldn't have let Mellide  marry him if
he wasn't.  Respect him, learn  to love him,  and let them,  my sister
and him, be your family from now on."
    "But why, father? Why must I leave? Why..."
    "I cannot  tell you - I  want to, but  I cannot. Just obey  me and
forget Trasath.  It shouldn't be  hard - I've  heard that Dargon  is a
fascinating place.  I love you, son,  I love you dearly  but life will
be much better for you away from here. Much better..."
    Just then, we  both heard hoofbeats outside and a  man's voice was
hailing  Father. I  was  introduced  to Uncle  Lavran,  a big,  hefty,
jolly-seeming person  who greeted me  with an openness that  warmed me
to him imediately.  The three of us together loaded  Uncle's pack mule
with my few  belongings. I hugged Father and said  good-bye with tears
in my  eyes. I had  taken leave of Mother  earlier in the  day, before
going to  say farewell to  Keryin, and she  stayed in the  kitchen now
to  avoid  a  repitition  of  that very  teary  encounter.  Uncle  had
brought an extra  horse for me so  I mounted up, waved  one last time,
and rode away from Trasath, for ever as far as I knew.

                                 Part I
    Midsummer's  day was  one  of  the few  days  that  Uncle let  his
apprentices off  to enjoy  themselves. It wasn't  exactly a  holiday -
not  like either  Founding Day,  or the  King's Birthday,  or Varhla's
Day -  but there  was a tradition  of picnics and  games on  that day,
especially  for the  younger people.  I didn't  really have  any plans
for the  day, unlike  Mernath and Dersh,  my fellow  apprentices. They
had the  whole day plotted out,  but I thought that  they had probably
gotten more  pleasure out of the  planning then they would  out of the
implementation. I thought  I might visit the markets,  and perhaps the
docks, but  I really  just wanted  to relax.  But, once  again, Leriel
changed all of that.
    Of the  many changes  in my  life in the  two years  since leaving
Trasath, Leriel  had been the  best. Dargon was  a big city,  and very
strange to  one who  had lived  his whole life  among the  same thirty
people. But,  eventually I got  used to  it. Working as  an apprentice
blacksmith  was a  far  cry from  helping  out in  the  fields of  the
village, or  aiding the carpenter as  able in fixing a  roof or adding
a  room. It  was hard,  at times  nothing but  drudge work,  and often
boringly repititious.  But, I was  learning a  little every day  and I
was already  able to  pound out nails  from rod-stock  with precision.
Next  would be  raw-shaping horseshoes  -  one of  the most  important
skills a blacksmith needed.
    But, Leriel was  nothing like learning a new city  or a new trade.
Firstly, she  had been  totally unexpected.  Uncle hadn't  told Father
about the  orphan he and  Mellide had  adopted. Leriel was  very close
to my age  - just a month  less than sixteen with  four months between
us. In that  way, she was very  like my sister. In fact,  there were a
lot  of  ways she  was  like  Keryin -  we  swiftly  became very  fast
friends. Even though  Mernath and Dersh were friends,  too, Leriel was
the one to show  me the city and teach me its ways.  Which was why she
dragged me  out of my  own boring plans  for that midsummer's  day and
showed me how it was supposed to be celebrated.
    The  entire day  was intoxicating,  wild  and full  of life,  good
friends having  good fun together.  When it began  to get dark,  I was
dragged  along to  one of  the alehouses  mid-town where  I got  drunk
with  the rest.  It was  amazing that  Leriel and  I made  it home  by
ourselves, but we finally crawled into our beds just after midnight.
    I couldn't  have been asleep for  a very long time  when something
awakened me.  I found  myself by the  one window in  my room  before I
had  time  to  wonder why  I  wasn't  still  trying  to sleep  off  an
increasing hangover.  The part of  the city  where Uncle had  his shop
wasn't built  very high  so that  I had  a majestic  view of  the sky.
Almost as  soon as I  looked out  into it, I  caught sight of  a large
falling  star arcing  across the  sky from  north to  south. Something
about  the way  it moved  and  its size  made  me wonder  if it  might
actually strike the  earth. Stories Uncle had told  surfaced - stories
of  sky-iron  and  the  wondrous  tools  and  weapons  that  could  be
fashioned  with  it. I  briefly  considered  trying  to find  it,  but
realized  that it  would  be  next to  impossible  even  if it  didn't
vanish in the air like most falling stars did.
    I went  back to my  bed and crawled back  under the covers,  but I
couldn't  get back  to  sleep. The  idea of  the  sky-iron refused  to
leave my thoughts and  I began to imagine what kind  of things I might
create out of it  that would be passed down into  history in the tales
of the  Bards. My fantasies  got wilder and  wilder - placing  my name
beside that  of Welan in the  Tales - until  finally I just had  to go
find  that sky-iron.  Something told  me  that I  could find  it if  I
trusted to luck and  the gods. Why not, I thought.  It was, after all,
still Midsummer's Night and strange things were said to happen then.
    I  got  dressed,  and  silently   went  out  to  the  stables.  My
incipient  hangover  was gone,  as  was  any  fuzzyness from  lack  of
sleep. I  was excited and very  clear headed as I  saddled up Snowfoot
and walked  her out of the  city before mounting her.  Then, we headed
south into  the forest that  covered most  of the area  between Dargon
and the Darst  Range. It wasn't exactly  safe for a young  man to ride
alone into  that forest,  but my  'clear' head  wasn't being  all that
pragmatic about  such things. All  I had on  my mind was  the sky-iron
and being famous.
    By the  middle of the  next day, I really  wanted to turn  back. I
was  lost and  hungry and  sure that  I would  never find  that stupid
falling  star -  it  had probably  never even  reached  the ground!  I
could barely believe  that I had actually followed my  dreams out into
the forest - I was 16 years old; too old for such silliness.
    But  each time  I was  about  to rein  Snowfoot around,  something
would whisper  in the  back of  my mind  'What if  it's just  over the
next rise?'  Or 'Maybe  it's around  the next bend  in the  path.' And
always 'What  if someone else finds  it first, and claims  your fame?'
So, I kept going almost against my will.
    I  came to  the  ruined  chapel not  long  before  sundown as  the
forest was  beginning to get  dark again. I didn't  see any sign  of a
fallen star  near the  place, but  I decided to  stay the  night there
anyway, and  head for home the  next day. I hoped  that Uncle wouldn't
be too worried or too mad when I told him why I was gone for two days.
    The chapel  was very old  and in very  bad repair. It  stood close
to a  huge tree, but  even so the weather  had done it  severe damage.
There was  little left  of the  roof-beams, and  there was  a sizeable
hole in  one wall.  Still, it was  shelter of a  kind and  the weather
was quite pleasantly  warm so I didn't really need  much protection. I
unsaddled Snowfoot and  rubbed her down, then left her  tied to a tree
nearby. She immediatly  settled into grazing, and I wished  it were so
easy to  feed myself. I briefly  considered trying to find  some early
berries, or  some old nuts,  but I was too  tired to go  scavenging in
the deepening gloom.  I took Snowfoot's tack into the  chapel and went
about trying to make myself a place to sleep.
    Leaves and  the saddle made  a comfortable  little nest in  one of
the corners  of the chapel's  single room. I decided  against lighting
a fire,  and was ready to  curl up in my  nest and try to  go to sleep
even though  it was very  early. But again  there was a  whispering in
my ear that said, "Explore." So, I did.
    There was just  enough sunlight remaining to  illuminate the small
room, so I  looked around. There wasn't much to  see. Any furniture it
had ever  held was now  long gone. Any  decorations on the  walls (the
ones  remaining,  at  least)  were   long  since  vanished.  The  only
ornamentation  in  the building  was  the  white  stone altar  in  the
alcove at  one end  of the room.  It had once  borne carved  scenes on
its sides, but  they were weathered away almost to  nothing. Still, it
was the only  thing in the chapel  to examine, so it went  over to it.
I tried  to trace out  the carvings on it,  but the elements  had done
their work very well.
    As I worked  my way around the altar, I  felt something welling up
within me.  I didn't  understand what it  was but when  I came  to the
back  side of  the altar  the feeling  became almost  overwhelming. My
hands went  to a depression  in the  former carving and  pressed down.
There  was a  click, and  the  whole altar  swung  away from  me on  a
corner  pivot  revealing  a  depression  sunk  into  the  floor.  From
somewhere  within  me came  the  knowledge  that  the cavity  was  the
hiding place for the chapel's holiest items.
    In the center  of the depression was a pile  of ancient cloth that
had once been  priestly vestments. Among the shreds of  fabric I could
see  the glint  of gems  that  had adorned  the  robes, but  I had  no
interest in  them. To  either side  of the  vestments, resting  on the
remains  of satin  pillows, were  what  I had  been sent  for. On  the
right side  was a piece of  amber the like  of which I had  never seen
before, nor even  heard tell of. It  was the length of  my forearm and
of a  pure, translucent gold  of the highest  grade of amber  but that
wasn't its  rarest feature: it was  carved into a representation  of a
tree branch!  It represented an oak  limb, and showed the  tree in all
three phases  of life  from leaf  bud to  full fruit.  The workmanship
was exquisite - this was a true  treasure  apart  from  its  religious
signifigance.
    On the  opposite side  of the  depression lay  a chalice,  low and
flat  and made  of a  dull silver  metal that  looked like  pewter but
wasn't. It  was simply decorated  but it had  a majesty about  it that
matched the  amber branch in  some strange way. I  had no idea  of the
signifigance of  either item in  whatever religion had  been practiced
in this chapel  in the wood but from somewhere  within me came another
piece of knowledge -  I had been drawn here to  take these things away
with me.  They had a  place in some larger  plan that I  would someday
be a part, but further knowledge of that plan was withheld from me.
    I took  up the  chalice and  the branch and  pressed the  latch on
the altar  again, closing the  cavity. I  put them into  my saddlebags
and went to sleep dreaming mistily of Bard-tales of magic and destiny.
    The next  day, Snowfoot  and I  turned back  for Dargon.  About an
hour  and a  half  along the  trail,  Snowfoot took  a  wrong fork.  I
didn't notice right  away - I was still pre-occupied  with the chalice
and branch  - and we  followed this new  trail for another  half hour.
About the  time I realized that  I didn't recognize the  trail we were
on I noticed signs  of a recent fire. It hadn't burned  very much - we
had had  a lot  of rain recently  - so  that it was  easy to  find the
center  of the  black area.  And there  I found  the lump  of sky-iron
that had lured me away from my bed two nights ago.
    Snowfoot somehow  found her  way back to  Dargon. After  hiding my
three treasures, I  ate a supper large enough for  three. Uncle Lavran
chewed me  out for vanishing for  two days, but  not as hard as  I had
feared. In  fact, his  final words  on the  subject revealed  where he
thought  I  had been  for  so  long -  "Next  time  you decide  to  go
wenching,  Midsummer's Day  or not,  don't  get so  involved that  you
forget to  come home!"  Leriel laughed  along with the  rest of  us at
that,  but she  kept my  secret -  I didn't  tell anyone  where I  had
been, but  she alone knew for  sure that I hadn't  gone 'wenching'. My
three treasures were safely hidden away, awaiting our joint destiny.

    My life became  strange after that Midsummer's Day when  I was 16.
Being led across  leagues of forest to claim three  treasures was just
the beginning.
    The most  common strangeness was the  scent of roses that  came to
me  in the  most unlikely  places.  I soon  learned that  no one  else
could smell  the roses and  I stopped commenting  on them, but  I soon
grew  used to  the occaisonal  waft  of fragrance  and it  came to  be
soothing and somehow  reassuring to smell the flowers  my sister loved
so much.
    And  then there  was  the  sourceless help  I  received at  times.
Once, I was  walking home alone from  a bar through the  seedy part of
town. It  wasn't a safe place  to be after  dark and alone, but  I was
just tipsy enough  not to take the longer way  around. As I approached
a particularly  dark alley,  I smelled the  roses and  something urged
me to  turn back.  As I  obeyed, four mean-looking  man rushed  out of
the  alley mouth  and  gave chase.  I  was far  enough  away and  fast
enough to escape but without the warning I would have been in trouble.
    Another  time I  was in  the  workshop alone,  hammering out  some
sheet  stock.  It seemed  (we  learned  later)  that  one of  the  new
apprentices  had been  careless  in stoking  the forge-fire,  allowing
some impure  charcoal to get in.  I heard a sizzle,  and the beginning
of a loud  *POP* and I found  myself flying as if shoved  into a wall.
I was  turned so that I  could see a  bright fan of sparks  and debris
fly through the space  I had been in a moment before  as a gaping hole
was blown  in the side  of the  forge-pit. The accident  wouldn't have
killed me  but I  would have  been badly  burned. When  I got  my wind
back, I looked  around to thank the  one who had pushed  me only there
wasn't  anyone there  and there  were  no tracks  in the  sand of  the
floor to show where someone might have come and gone.
    These  and  other,  similar,  incidents  made me  think  I  had  a
guardian  spirit who  was keeping  me out  of danger  so I  could come
into my  destiny. There was usually  a way to explain  everything that
happened  logically,  but it  was  more  romantic  to believe  in  the
spirit. After the  first few times I was 'miraculously  saved' in this
manner  I  stopped telling  everyone  about  them  - my  friends  just
kidded me about my  dreams and Uncle Lavran told me  to stop making up
stories  and get  back to  work. Leriel  was the  only one  who didn't
laugh or scoff, and she became my confidant and secret-sharer.
    There was  one strangeness I  didn't tell  her of, though.  It was
the most  disturbing of  them all and  there wasn't  anything romantic
about it, either. It was the dream.
    There was only  one dream, but I  had it many times.  It seemed to
get  worse around  summer, particularly  on Midsummer's  Eve. I  never
could remember  all of it, just  vague impressions of it.  It involved
fear and  helplessness, a ring of  people dancing naked, a  knife, and
blood. I  always awoke  from the dream  with a pain  in my  chest, and
when the  dream was at  its worst there were  times I woke  with blood
on my chest.  The blood always vanished by morning  but that scared me
the most.  The only time  the dream  would come to  me when I  was not
asleep was  when I  would try to  bed a  woman - and  it was  for that
reason that I was yet a virgin.
    Between the  strangenesses, I learned  enough from my Uncle  to be
called  a blacksmith.  Shortly after  my 19th  birthday, Uncle  Lavran
came to  me and  said, "Dyalar,  I think  you've studied  enough under
me. You  have good hands  and a  strong back and  I would be  proud to
call you my  partner if you've a  mind to stay in Dargon  a while." So
I became  one of  five smith's working  in Uncle's shop  and I  was so
happy that even the dream couldn't upset me for weeks after that.
    I  went to  bed  one night  in mid-Ober  thinking  about my  first
commission  - a  Guildmaster friend  of  Uncle's wanted  a trinket  to
wear to  King Haralan's 36th  Birthday Ball  at Dargon Castle  in just
two weeks, and  Uncle had given the  project to me. It took  me a long
time to  get to sleep  for thinking what  to make for  Master Kethral,
but as soon as I had drifted off I began to dream.
    It wasn't  "the Dream" but  it was strange.  I dreamed I  woke up,
dressed,  retrieved  my three  treasures  -  the sky-iron,  the  amber
branch, and  the chalice - from  their place of concealment,  and went
out to  the workshop with them.  A full moon  lit the large room  as I
stoked up  the forge-fire and  placed our thickest-walled  melting pot
over it. I placed  all three of my treasures into the  pot and went to
the bellows to increase the forge's heat.
    As I  pumped the bellows and  stirred the contents of  the melting
pot, I  began in  my dream to  sense the presence  of someone  else in
the workshop  with me. When the  three objects were finally  melted, I
was  directed by  that presence  (without words)  to pick  up a  handy
knife. Holding my arm  out over the melting pot, I  cut myself high on
the forearm.  I let  myself bleed  into the  mixtrue, adding  a fourth
element  to the  strange alloy.  When there  was enough  blood in  the
pot,  the presence  directed me  to remove  my arm  and I  tied a  rag
around the wound.  After stirring the mixture some more,  I tipped the
melting pot into a waiting sword-form.
    The strange  alloy cooled  rapidly, gaining  a shiny,  rosy golden
sheen as  it hardened.  When it  was handleable, I  began to  shape it
from  its rough-cast  form into  a useable  weapon. While  I had  been
tutored  in weapon-making  by  Uncle Lavran,  I had  yet  to have  the
opportunity to  make a sword. However,  in my dream and  helped by the
presence, I  crafted a weapon fit  for bard's tales. It  was almost as
if the  alloy I had  created had a finished  shape within it,  and the
hammering and shaping I  did to it only helped that  form to come out.
My dream  seemed to become  even more  remote as greatness  was formed
by my unskilled hand.
    The  process of  forging a  sword can  take days  or even  weeks -
this one  formed itself in  just a few hours.  When it was  finished I
placed  it in  the  cooling bath  one  last time.  It  seemed to  glow
beneath the water in  the bath. I put my hand into  the water to touch
the  sword for  the first  time -  and as  my hand  hit the  luke-warm
water  I woke  up to  find myself  standing in  the workshop  reaching
into  the  cooling  bath  for  a  rosy-gold  glowing  sword  that  lay
therein. For  just a moment, I  thought that I could  still sense that
strange presence that had guided me in my dream but it was soon gone.
    As  I lifted  the  sword  I had  somehow  created  from its  final
cooling and stared at  its beauty, a sense of what  lay before me came
into my  mind. I  saw a  journey, a  reconcilliation, and  righting an
old wrong. Lured  by the mystery of  it, and the sword  itself, I went
quietly back  to my room,  packed some clothes  and food, and  set out
on a quest.
