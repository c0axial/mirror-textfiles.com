// Introduction ..
==================
 
     We at NARC strive be the most knowledgable in this phreak world
as we can. This file is dedicated to the beginner. In Future issues,
we will go into a more depth subject matter such as Hacking other
computer systems. Look for the Official NARC 800 Carrier List. This will
be a combined file of present carriers known, and quite a few new systems
that we have found in wardialing. Laidher Dudes, on to the Text.
 
Code Useage for the Beginner
============================
There have been many files writen on Hacking and Phreaking, But this file
deals with the safety of phreaking in the area of Code Hacking.
First you will use a program called a Code Hacker, which works on a
simple idea, if the call goes through it will detect a carrier and record
the code in a text file for l8r viewing. As of now, I am not sure what is
safe to hack and what is not . A Lot of people feel 950's (950-xxxx) are
safer then 800's. I've heard people say, if a company can afford a 800 #
then they can usually afford ANI (Automatic Number Indentification) . Look at
it this way, who do you think is a bigger company , MCI/SPRINT/TELECONNECT/etc
(the actucal phone companys or some company's business watss line. which is
smaller than the phone co. which a lot of the 950's are actucal phone companys
lines. All 950's have autmatic ANI, and MCI has a service on the bill of the
800 owner it will show the phone # from which the call was made. So , I dunno.
I guess you could say phreaking is a RISKY Business now a dayz.....
But, the point of this file is to give new Phreakers some tips on safety,
for safety is THE most import aspect of Phreaking, because if you get
busted, all hell breaks loose!, and if your 18 years or older you can serve
time for it. And it most cases people 17 will be tried as a adult.
My Advice, use codes until you reach 18, then stop! or be a ocassional
phreaker, say, 1/2 calls a week. Or use extenders that are fresh and safe, but
still you're risking a lot after you hit the 18 year marker. so be karefull
dudes.. Now, A lot of people get their codes from other BBS's and VMB's (Voice
Mail Boxes) . Which i Don't recommend. I ran a VMB Codeline for like half a
year, and its nothing but trouble. Unless your calling from fortress. Generally
speaking, if you run a VMB on a 1800 line, it would be wise to use it a month,
and find a new location. the FBI Shut down both of my vmb's. It's a wonder
I didn't get busted cuz i wuz kalling from my home phone. Back to Hacking,
Hack your own codes and use them, you don't know where a code has been if you
get it off a BBS/VMB. Never use a code for more than 3 days.
Most people think that the best time to Phreak (run their Code Hackers)
is in the middle of the night, this is the worst time to hack.
During business hours is when the many people use their codes, and they
are a perfect camouflage. Leave it on while your at school!
When your hacking, set it up to have several carrier #'s , where the company
won't notice a pattern. and always hack Random!!  Never hack SEQUENTIALLY.
Another tip I have thought of...I suggest not using any codes the
last 3 days of any month...why?  Because that is when people get their
phone bills, and that is when they will report Phreaking on their code,
and that is when you dont want to use the code!
If you want to give out the codes you hack, I suggest only giving them
out to trusted people...only release them to the public after you have
used them for your week and will never use them again...Tell the people
which you give the Codes exactly when you hacked it...so they too won't
get caught. (When you think about it...it is Sooo much safer to hack
your own codes!). To End this file I'd like to say, i Failed English, so
thats why this is not in Paragraph form and proper English! HA! And that
Codes are Risky. And if you ever get busted, don't rat on people who give
you codes or help you out. or Don't rat on anyone. Everone hates a NARC.
and your life will probably be misserable after that, people will threten to
bomb your house/kill you/turn your power off/cancel your credit cards, the
possiblities are Endless. take it like a Man! ha. welp, if closing, i'd like
to say, if you have other means of calling out other than using codes, use them
first. PBX's are a lot safer than codes. If you can find a local PBX, you're
set. Don't abuse it, and it will do you for a long time. Probably my
Favorite means of phreaking is using a outdial. This is something like
PCP/StarLink, you call a computer and it connects, and allows you to
dial a remote #. These are usually found on Government MainFrames, and
are usually un-passworded. I will trade for any outdials you have!! make me
a offer! ha.. welp. thus this ends the 2nd NARC Newsletter. L8r Dayz..
