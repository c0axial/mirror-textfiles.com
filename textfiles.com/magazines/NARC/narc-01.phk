                        ======================
 
What is N.A.R.C.?
-----------------------------
First of all, it stands for:
 
Nuclear Phreakers/Hackers/Carders
N           A          R  C
 
Pretty creative, eh?  Well, if you're wondering where the 'Nuclear' came from,
that's because the home of N.A.R.C. is located on Nuclear Wasteland.  N.A.R.C.
is about 2 months old as of today and currently has 6 members in it.  It is
phreak/hack/card club so we can hack and share our info with the rest of the
members without getting our codez abused and getting many codez/cardz daily.
On it we also post valuable info on practically every system that is hackable.
heh.  We also go into detail for each other on what we know best so we can
hack/use everything to our full advantage.
 
How is N.A.R.C. Organized?
-----------------------------
Well, N.A.R.C. is divided into two sections.  A Phreak/Hack section and a Card
section.  (2 message bases and a gfile section for N.A.R.C. text files and
other releases.)  That way we can focus more strongly on each related topic,
thus getting more info.
 
Who are the N.A.R.C. members at the moment?
----------------------------------------------
Well, I don't think I'll do any fancy text writting and 8 pages of differently
arranging our names like CHiNA did so here is the current list:
 
The Oxidizer - COOL Phreaker/Hacker/Carder
Cobra Commander  - COOL Phreaker/Hacker/Carder
Prometheus - COOL Phreaker/Hacker
sir hackalot - COOL Phreaker/Hacker
Maelstrom - COOL Phreaker/Hacker/Carder
Zapper - COOL Phreaker/Hacker
 
Get the point?
 
How do I become a N.A.R.C. member?
----------------------------------------------
We are alwayz looking for more members for N.A.R.C.  If you feel you are an
experienced phreaker/hacker/carder, or just a overall 'special' person,  then
fill out infoform 1 and/or infoform 2 on Nuclear Wasteland.  (Located in
San Jose, California.)  Infoform 1 is for access to the phreak/hack base and
infoform 2 is for the card base.
 
What are the other N.A.R.C. nodes?
----------------------------------------------
There is no such thing as a 'N.A.R.C.' node.   Maybe in the future there will
be N.A.R.C. nodes but at the moment there are none so please stop asking.
 
What is the VMB #?
----------------------
VMB?  What VMB?  There is no VMB.  But sometime in the future we might get
a VMB and post a bit of info and codez/cardz...  But right now there is no
VMB and when we decide to get a VMB, we'll let you all know and the # will
become available on Nuclear Wasteland.
 
What are the future plans/releases for N.A.R.C.?
-----------------------------------------------------
First of all, in the near future we plan on releasing many test files.  Also
in the future sometime we will release the N.A.R.C. hacker and other utils
to aid you in your hacking for the future...  This is what we see planned:
NOTE: The following is subject to change.
 
Text Files - Near Future
---------------------------
Phreaking for the Beginner Without Getting Caught
Semi-Advanced Phreak/Hack Info
Comparison of the Existing Hackers out Today
Electronic Surveillance
Night Vision Devices
Infrared Viewers
Laser Bugs
And other text files that have no name and are still in the development stage.
 
Releases - Not so near Future
--------------------------------
The GREATEST hacker of all time will be released (month or two) that will have
more functions and utilities that other hackers have simply been to lazy to put
in or didn't know how.  Don't have a name yet...
 
What is the # for Nuclear Wasteland?
---------------------------------------
Yea, you wish.  heheh.  Well, if you really want the # then take a look around
or ask a friend.  I'm not about to give out the # here but trust me, it is easy
to find if you don't know it already...
