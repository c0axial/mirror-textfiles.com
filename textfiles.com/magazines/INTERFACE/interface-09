                         Do you know that sometimes I am masturbating
                         when we're talking on the phone?

'Sometimes, when we talk, he said, on the phone'
(I try out the lines)
'I am masturbating. ' (No)
'I'm masturbating.' (No)
'I masturbate.  Did you know?'

They say that hate it when I use the phone
They say that hate it when I'm saying 'things'

'Testicles'            Like 'testicles'

Considerings in the car        Mall mutterings
       'Sometimes when we're on the phone'
He said                         He didn't ask

       /: Whisper /: Open up your lips
       (to continue click text area)

                       'On the phone'

He said 'Is anybody listening?'

       /: Whisper whisper /: Thing /: Whose thing

'Did you know I masturbate'
       he said
'Sometimes when we're talking on the phone?'

You have such clean and soapy hair
Tomato soupy soapy hair

We'll kissed and made up you'll be glad to know
Someone was deleted
                       Acknowledging your call
This is your calling
Channel whisper
Chatting whisper
                       /: You're on
/: On you

He said 'Is anybody reading'
       (N)onstop Q(uit)
                       'Not at work'
Your hair Your lips
                       'Not when I'm sick'

When I pick up
The loudest dial
tone
       'Sometimes I masturbate when I talk on the phone'
       (T)esticles

I'm right here honey
I'm right here

'Sometimes' /:pick it up  'goes where?'

THE NUMBER WHICH DOES NOT EXIST

as such,
a dissonance
in the valence of
absence

from the heart of a statue
extracted

        (wing caught
        morning
        's rising

the colour of that

vacuum

        cleaner,
                o converter, her
                        shoulder, refrigerator
sounds like crickets, catalytic
making noise upon


*


what signs exchanged in darkness, crossed
and uncrossed, folded and furrowed, flashed
back and forth with mirrors or magnetic
tape: sparks across the gap, a handful of
that radical moisture drowned as so many
voices, from Olduvai to the water's edge


*


"To the Lady of the Labyrinth,
   a jar of honey."

        Here,
in Her hive-shaped
ghosthouse, hewn
from a hollow, huddled
in the heat of
the sweet dark heart
of Her, a humming
in neural circuits,
harmonics cluster
around a single flower,
hung-up on Her
absence, lack
of a thread to
the argument. She
pours honey in my ear,
combs sparks from Her
amber hair and says,
"The double axe is
   a butterfly."


*


        in thrall to

the cult of Her
verdant
inertia,
virtual chlorophyll
immersion program,
neural
foliage
in fever blossoms,
photons
strobe
through the leaves,
deciduous
_dream

Her cunning
lingual

SOLITUDE PASSAGE

Plant life or subliminal cocoon.

Refuge in dissolution. Pools
of empty musing, space between spaces, lace
of the infinite.

        Radiometer
spins in the infra-sun. Insect motor
ticks sentient rhythm.

Dream pulse domain...light-force within
leaf-green veins...suggestive of butterfly
wing gradient.

The tree frog barks
and the fractals bloom.

Imagine: A-space...the n-cube . a room in what would be
a perfect blue chunk of sky. Birds fly through this
hypothetical absence. Fuzzy logic clouds to sleep upon
as if solid air.

Now here. Node to node. Cathode rays embrace.
Explicit lyricism. Beryl in the golden Loom
...coded calls to the O-zone.

Glisten.

POOL, JUNE
----------

I fried.  Literally fried.  Son of a bitch!
10 seconds made everything tight, crisp.  
Youth and age in the same blazing sizzle--Wow!
Existential. 
I am here, said my skin to the sun. 
You have travelled 9,000,000,000 miles 
And reached the outer edges of me.
Cool.

THE PIG GENERATION
------------------

"Dead baby boomers," said he.
"That's funny!" said she.
"But not so funny it isn't subtle," she slipped in carefully.

"Nothing subtle here!" he cried--
"Dead! Dead! Dead! Pennies stuffed inside their eyes!"
"Potato Eyes fried," she replied,
"Denied the prize."

And they sighed.  Then put on their boxing gloves.

"Dead baby boomers," he recried--
"Road kill, fecal matter freeze dried--"
"Softly," she complied, "we must not put them to the test."

Now lay that shit to rest.  Don't fuck with generation X.

FAT MRS. RILEY
--------------

Stupid girl, posing--
Melon-headed pony--
Bursting your sides.
Flexing, reflexing torso
Man-killing back muscle bicep tri-curl
Stretching.

Who built you to be so imposing?
Some guy--
Some capitalist--
Some guilder from the dust age
In his mother-rage.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


EVERYWHERE STIFFS
-----------------

Local news, cop-plots invade daydreams,
Gun down stiffs at Dairy Queens.
Every day my mind composes scenes,
Mayhem, murder, piercing screams.

     Everywhere stiffs.

Midday park, the
Yellow sky not dark,
Singing larks--then--
Saber-toothed slice 
And dead 'neath bark!

     Everywhere stiffs.

Rush hour highway driving back,
Sudden hit, snipe atttack!
Veering, skidding, head-on smack,
Exploding mushroom, metal flack,
And fourteen killed, right on track. 

     Everywhere stiffs.

Market, waiting there on line,
Shiver shoots up-down your spine!
Man in front reveals the sign for
Stick-up, panic, terror-blind.

     Everywhere stiffs.

Paranoia, maybe true.
Maybe you're a victim, too.
Or it may be that you will see
A victim 
Of me.

     Everywhere stiffs.

HER MOTHER, HERSELF
(Rites of Spring)
-----------------

Green launched--
Jet feet--
Pumping arms--
Flowing hair--
And yellow breeze--
Young--freed--this is no tease--
This--is--easy--
And she keeps on leaving her.

     HELPLESS--MINDLESS--EARTHED AND OUT OF BREATH--
     THIRTYSOMETHING PALPATATIONS--

She needn't answer--the answer is no--

     BLINDED--TANGLED--AWKWARD--TRIPPING--PANICKED--
     WANTS TO CRY--NO ONE HELPS--

Herself--new person among people.

time has slowed

a car cracks ice as it passes along the road

depth

viscidity 

a car cracks ice as it passes along the road

icicle drips

a car passes (sound: a mighty maw pounded to silence)

the diverse logic of the moon embedded here

a car passes (sound: rationality shredded)

body of ice twitches

a car passes (sound: void ravages lip of air)

the rate of slush

here: the concealment the congestion the gratuity the longing to 
loneliness the irrelevancy the rectitude the passing the castration the 
concoction the notion the narrative the individual the connotation the 
insolence the caution the conscience the circuity the circumference the 
additional the longitudinal the careful the dishes the diary the drowning 
the parchment the control the catering the coke the dice the dowager 
the double-bind

a car passes (a singularity goes down in blue flames)

a crystallized tree

a car passes

subterranean

trapped between the dream of sara and the moment you felt the rain

a car passes

Flowerwinkles

Plant blossoms outside your house
To tame the wild children of broken noses
Who come like hamsters nibbling at your doubt
In gigglebytes up the porch step wearing jumburritos
And cellophane candy wrappers, crinkling them;
French fry spears and play blood splatter,
There's the horn honk, who's a venture success
On the street where it's money and cars that matter.
Give them sweet bouquets as a childhoos reminder
Not to grow up so quickly they forget
How a daisy is a love finger,
Or the honeysuckle a hummingbird's golden trumpet,
Or how, in encapsulated format, they are the seedlings
Of worldwide peace.

CIRCLES
-------

I am left fragile as eggshells
When my paint has gone sour, like milk
Drunk before my nightly jailbird escape
A jailbreak back into prison
I am bald in this tower with no doors
Only a window nestled high between clouds
Or pillow, or illusions made of glass
-Enough of gold and feathers
I speak of punishable uncomitted crimes
And stars that turn around themselves
And circles that embrace each other
So close that they merge and spiral
Cannot end, cannot start
Dream not of each other
Dream only of each other.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


SWEET
-----

Silence creeps into my body
And I'm bleeding poetry once again
All over the cherry blossoms
Light as snow
White as snow
Crushed beneath my feet
And this is sugar-quiet.

Dreamwork Notes
(two poems of Pierre Joris and Poetics)
---------------------------------------

DREAMS	not representation
	(but) in magic realms
	speaking language not yours
	(in)corporate [...] into what you write
	as poetry as a discourse
	Knowing weather it is a human

THE UNDERWORLD:	dragged
		through displacements and oddities
		looking for that unique thing of the true I

NO POINT IN TIME:	[adaption to/thru knowledge]
			when you're dead, they tell you so
			and you live an ordinary life


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


I dreampt the news today
	spent my arms alongside
	contained within, encased
	but drawn away

Supple mitent/latent?
		in a vault
		the computer

disturbance in the form of disruptance, literal
to purcha(n)ce
		talk about you
		through "the true eye" 		[focault]

                        Call for Work
                    Women on the Net(work)	
           inter\face Electronic Literary Magazine


VOICES

Voices to the left
to the right
near
and far
rise up and be numbered.

Resurrect the voices past and present,
those lost from constant screaming,
those buried in layers of silence.
Summon them to rise as phoenixes
and proclaim
"I am woman."  I, am woman.

			--Tanya Manning

	"Women on the Net(work)" is the focus for inter\face's tenth 
issue (coming Spring 1995).  This issue is especially dedicated to 
providing women writers an electronic forum for the multiplicity of 
their voices.  Metaphorically the title "Women on the Net(work) stands 
for the magazine operating as a net to catch the multiplicity of writings 
by women that may typically go unknown.
	The search for subjects and forms of discourse are unrestricted. 
Whether you write in a "technological/mechanical" voice or 
"renaissance/romantic" style, we're interested.  Whether your poems or 
stories are of topical relevance to politics or race relations, women's 
rights or women's magic, sexual orientation or erotica, or anything 
unmentioned, we want you to contribute your work.
	The criteria for this issue is simple. To preserve the writer's 
integrity and promote the writer as publisher, editing of content is 
minimal. In the spirit of accepting "contributions" as opposed to 
"submissions," we believe in your right as a writer to say whatever 
you want to say in the way you want to say it.  However, we do ask of 
you to limit for publishing fairness your contributions to three separate 
pieces.  Please send your entries no later than February 14, 1995 to 
interfac@cnsunix.albanu.edu.  For more information, please contact 
Tanya Manning at TM5498@cnsvax.albany.edu.

"The `censor' protects our central system of values, as it does our
physical nervous system by simply cooling off the onset of experience
a great deal. For many people, this cooling system brings on a lifelong
state of psychic *rigor mortis,* or of somnambulism, particularly
observable in periods of new technology." [Marshall McLuhan, 
_Understanding Media_]
