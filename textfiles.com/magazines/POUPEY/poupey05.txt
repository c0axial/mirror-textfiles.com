                      Nybars life.. in a shell.   -Fro Boy+Nybar

                There ONCE was a crazy dud(e) named nybs,
                 Who was STRANGE in the way of his vibes.
                  With a disdain for pretention,
                   and non linear attention...
                his goals I never jived.
                 His goals they were these:
                To protect cats from fleas,
                And help if they got stuck in trees.
               Cat worship he practiced and preached,
                 And this to his students he teached,
                From old USA, to the coast of Pompay,
                  The cult eventually reached.
               His second in command was called `Nybar'
                Who would often sit atop fro boys car,
               Her shiny fur, was deep black, as tar.
               And now this rhyme I must end,
               for I am departing my friend,
                these tales sweet and strange,
               and at times quite deranged...
               I hope your woes they doth mend.

++++++++++===========----------BUTT theory------------===========+++++++++++

     I just made up a scientificly grounded theory... well.. kinda..
      Scientific sounding. It says that.. wait.. this has to drag on.
     So first I'll explain creation.
    FIRST, THERE WAS NYBAR.. AND IT, WAS, .. kinda boring.
    AND THEN HE CREATED ME N Jc.. AND WE CREATED POUPEY.. AND IT..
     WAS.. GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD.
    ON THE FIRST DAY, HE ATE A TACO.
    ON THE SECOND DAY, HE FARTED HEARTY.
    ON THE THIRD DAY, HE DECIDED HE WOULD WRITE FOR POUPEY.
    ON THE FOURTH DAY.. HE WENT TO THE BATHROOM.
    ON THE FITH DAY.. HE SCREWED AROUND WITH ALOT OF STUPID RULES.
    ON THE SIXTH DAY.. HE LAUGHED AT THE PEOPLE WHO LISTEND TO HIS RULES.
    ON THE SEVENTH  DAY....... : PENIS POP.
   anyway.. enough filler to last a story. the butt theory goes like this..
       Every time you fart.. you release a stinky, flammable gas called
      Methane. After a while this fart-methane dissepears. Where does it go?
     Where does it go? Where does it go? Where does it go? Where DOES it go?
    This theory Was invented to answer those questions.
      At the center of the earth.. there WAS a big hole. But then...
     Nybar said "Let there be a butt" And there was a giant butt there.
    That butt was created so that if nybar ever wanted to destroy all the
     humans he could do it easily. Now.. whenever someone farts.. it
      Stays on earth a while.. and then goes to the giant butt.. called
       bumblefart.. where it will stay until doomsday. On doomsday..
       Nybar will put on an oxygen mask.. light a match.. and release all
      the farts. BOOM! Bye planet earth. But in the fro there is hope.
     If it gets big enough fast enough without killing us all.. it may
      be able to absorb the explosion.
       Anyway.. if you feel like farting.. try to hold it in man.

               roll poetry
     ----------------------------------------------------------

              The once was a poet named bob..
               whose apartment was often robbed..
             so he became a b-movie critic..
             And was happy.. until he disturbed the crickits....
              Now in hodgesons bay his body bobs. Anyway.. we were going to
                                              Boston market.. and I didn't
             What is the matter with life?   want to go there at the time..
              It can be cut away with a knife..so I said " Ewww.. we're
                I show not my fear.. going to have alittle "Bour ve bour"
              As I raise my ears..    at BOSTON MARKET!" hahaha.. genuis.
             To the terrible toon of the fife!

               The once was a man called "Hughes"
              Who had an unreasonable fear of green suade shoes..
                 In a plane called sproose goose..
                He extravigantly cut loose..  some day.. historians 
             To the germs, he paid his dues     will dig up the remains of
                                            p0upEy.. and think.. "God..things
                  Why must the world go on?   haven't improved much"
                 From Now to an indian dawn..
                   But when I sleep..    Wyoming does NOT exsist! 
                Making not a peep..   It's a conspiracy of cartogriphers!
                  Mayhap I shall dream of controlling a pawn.
                                             Wyoming means " No state here"
                  A poem is hard to write..
                An incomplete one fills my heart with spite..
                 Many people dream..                 godd this poetry sux
                   Of a world sweet as whipped cream..
               WAKE UP! And you'll see the world is shite!
                 
                 MMMMMMMMMMMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
                 The duck.. says quack
                  A is for apple.. b is for bear.. c is for..

........................................................................

       On april the 10th
       at about 8:00 that night
       Les Leisons dangerous was brought back to life

       a tale of aristicrats with hearts cold and hard
       who played out peoples lives just as though they were cards

       the show went all right
       despite a flickering light
       a couple flubbed lines and a door hinge not tight

       so if you like malace, decite, and revenge
       to the center of students you should soon decend
       to check out a show presented proudly to you
       by the students of theatre in E-52

       ========================================================

       all things must end
      'tis known to be true
       so the students of theatre in E-52
       will present one last show proudly to you
       and then to Wolf hall they must aduie

       a tale of acceptance, forgivness, and change
       they needed a play with quite a braud range

       and then arouse an image like a hymn song out in church
       well put on Shakespears Tempest full of rhyme, and wit, and myrth

       to direct this last show they went overseas
       and asked David Howie of the old RSC:
        "we've got here a play thats been around for an age
        and would you convert it from the page to the stage"

        so on may the 11th at about 10:00 that night
        Prospero's "art" will shine to delight
        and for the last time the curtin will fall
        with a hail and fare well to good old Wolf Hall

    A crazy guy  named jC  i once knew

                  Get out some bowels for a-mixin.
                  Make sure to have a biggggggg spoon (for licking).
                  3 shakes of manical, hyena like laughter..
           Mixed N Shaken with alot of non-linear thoughts and abstract ideas.
                    Take alot of good advice.. and let your mind warp it..
  And mix whatever remains, with alot of jerks trying to tell you what to do
            Ahh.. crap.. I forget the rest of the recipe.. but I do know..
                  THE POEM OF THE INSANE!

  -----------------------------------------------------------------

                      If yas want an insanity tis nice..
                     Yer gonna need lotsa spice...
                    As satan calls to you.....
                   "Go make hell.. like a flu!"
                  Make sure to be hellish enough to melt ice!

                 As hell is roastin' in your brain..
                  It would drive anyone nigh insane,
                  so use these gifts sparingly..
                  and harrass people daringly..
                 You will be law peoples bayne!

               Make sure not to stub your toe..
              As along lifes road you go,
               But if you do... wear a shoe,
              so it never happens again!

             Make sure to make fun of the church..
           And whack repulicans with clubs of birch..
          Senseitive  Poets won't shut up..
           Pesky neighbors disturb your sup..
          Don't give money to the beggars that lurch!

            Once there was a cat named vimto..
           Who made mad antics from here to Cairo,
            He caught lots of mice..
             Who he ate with sugar and spice..
            Insane people are never stuck for a rhymO!

                           The story - by Nybar

               so one day there was a guy who was named mama babushka.
              and then he decided to eat his wheat cakes.
                 and ethe evil withc almost got him.
                but she didn't. and he ate his wheat cakes.
               and he said "MM.. good!" and I wanted some
              but he wouldn't let me have any.
                anyway.. he needed a bath.. so he went to sleep.
               and dreamt of a world where you can have your wheat cakes..
                and eat them to.

                Big bad bumblefuck fred flintstone style - by nybar

                Can you imagine what sex between fred and wilma must be like?
        God! It must be a marathon! I mean.. just LOOK at Fred. Lust IS
            better then love. And wilma.. I mean.. if she can lift that
          friggin meat slab that weighs 500 lbs.. you KNOW she's mean in the
        bed. And what about barney and betty? I don't think barney knows how
       ta get dowwnnn well enough.. cause ya know they ADOPTED bam bam.
           Did YOU know that flintstone pills were originally introduced
       to increase ones sex capacity? True story. I wonder if dino ever got
         any. Actually.. I don't think I want to think about that right now.
           Ya Know Barnie's pet.. Hoppy? I seen Dino eyin her. <winkwink>
           Catchy name.. isn't it? You know.. the show the flintstones came
          AFTER flintstone vitamins. Some people say it's a ripoff of the
           honeymooners.. but the honeymooners can't get down like that!~
            !!
