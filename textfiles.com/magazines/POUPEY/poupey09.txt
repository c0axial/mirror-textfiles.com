              "Puffin.. in prose.. preferably" - by Nybar+Froboy
              --------------------------------------------------

               Nybar- I'm feeling really hungry..
                     My belly is a-achin..
                   But I weep for the puffins,
                    My faith in justice a-shakin.

             Froboy- My bellies empty to..
                     and I look emaciated,
                   I need to feed my face.. to be satiated.

             Puffin- But lo, Look at the sign..
                     `No puffins allowed within'
                     And now I must be cryin..
                      For now my belly is thin.

             Froboy- This seems unfair, unjust..
                    For now in 90's east cafe,
                     I now no longer trust.

             Nybar- Worry not my puffin friend..
                   Do not start to gloat..
                    Beacause to get you in 90's east end..
                   I'll hide you in my coat!!

             Froboy- A table for.. two,
                    And food for three..
                   Because my invisible friend you <don't> see..
                    Is really really hungry.

           Waitress- Oh cat-like one..
                    Our rules you shun..
                     For if you have a puffin,
                    I'll have to get the gun.
          
              Nybar- Nay nay good las..
                      No puffins here..
                     That bulge you see..
                    Is an otter of nigere.

           Waitress- I've heard that one before..
                       But I will a accept bribe..
                        For I do believe.. As I breathe,
                       You're the one that they call nybes.

             Froboy- Yes.. nybar he is and a bribe you shall get..
                       and this boon shall be payed before the sun doth set,
                      Thus you control my pocket like a marionet..
                       Least this puffin shall dine on crepes suzzete!

              Puffin- This justice is done.. my mojo workin..
                     And I thought on law.. this place was shirkin..
                       But now I know.. theres justice in bribes..
                     As long as I enter.. with froboy and nybes!

            Froboy- Now that dinner is done..
                      puffin must swollow a pill..
                    For my funds are depleted..
                     Quoth froboy to puffin `Pay the bill, you will!'

                                -----------
             The puffin went on, to revolutionize the whole IDEA of deep
              diving.. and fight aliens.. in a far of galaxy.

             The waitress went back to being a creepy new york musician.

             Me and froboy.. well..  he got a big fro and I drank alot of
              coffee then took a piss. Then we wrote this.

                        FiniTOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!

                   A whore is hard to beat..
                   In a sex endurance contest..
                   That is completely eleet.
   
               -----------------------------------
 
                   Alas... poor loki... I knew him well..
                   screwed around with hookerz alot as I recall..
                   and now he probably has feline aids.. yet..
                   HIS PENIS BEGINS TO SWELL!
               ----------------------------------------------------
                  The governor of hokassin,
                  made an imporatant announcement..
                  "All shall be nude from now on..
                  Permitted to wear only one mocassin"

               -------------------------------------------------

                  Why did the puffin cross the road?
                  With those bitter frozen feet..
                  Cause he was hungry..
                  and saw the sign
                  `Joes Eats'

            --------------------------------------
     
                          ELEET JOKEZ!

                   Say to someone "Hey you" if they say `What' reply with
                   chickenbutt. Then.. say "DAMN!" And when they say
                   what.. say chickenbutt. Then.. say "I'm going to
                   chickenbutt you.. OH WAIT CAN'T! JUST REMEMBERED!"
                   And if they said what.. say <snicker> "CHICKENBUTT!"

           ----------------------------------------------------------------
           (same as above.. but replace chickenbutt with `That's what')
           ----------------------------------------------------------------

                  When someone says something overly confident.. or non
                   pessemistic.. just say "Bahhhhhhh, humbug"

            ---------------------------------------------------------------

               When shaving gerbils.. make sure to angle. They may freeze
                in the winter.. so get them a fur coat. Gerbil fur works
                 great. Just shave another gerbil and put it on the cold
                gerbil. Oh yeah.. that would defeat the point. So shave
                 a HAMSTER instead.

          ----------------------------------------------------------------

                 Ummmmmmmmmmmm biddleaahhh.. I'LLLL get the best of you..
                  UMMMMMMMMMMMM biddleAHHH!
