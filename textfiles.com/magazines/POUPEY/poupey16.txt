  The story about the leprechaun I wrote after staying up all night -nybar

            "Uh oh.. this is bad."

the leprachaun thought. he had to pee. right after announcing himself as
the leprachaun with the traditional scary "AHH'M DA LEPRACHAUN!" he had to
fucking PEE!  And he was getting horny. This really sucked. I mean.. what
could he do? Just say "Hey waitasec.. don't run away with the pot of
gold.. I need to go pee and masturbate (wherever leprechauns go to do
that)." Yeah right. And he needed to go so badly he was dying. The
erection he was getting didn't help any. The person he was scaring was
just standing there, tapping her foot. Then, it happened. He peed himself.
She could see it, too!!!  Aww man... sucky.. she ran away trying to do the
traditional screaming thing, but ended up laughing like hell. He said "Ahh
what the hell" and started masturbating. Then, the worst thing possible
happened. Some jerk photogropher took his picture! How would he ever get
over THIS little scandal. I mean sure.. the people might elect a
leprechaun who insisted in dressing in green and marching in the gay
rights parade *not to mention scaring and ocasionally killing people who
tried to take his gold* but M-A-S-T-U-R-B-A-T-I-N-G?!@$ NO WAY! He thought
of how irrational this was.. then remembered something.. some number he
had seen... about... getting rid of republicans and their stupid logic...
just one small contribution could help buy weaponry to end a stupid
regime!

          The crazy story I wrote after staying up all night - by nybar

If I were a drummer.. would I not still... not.. know how to play drums?
If.. the universe.. the.. unvierse..r 1342.ed.234.e.1$# -tales from the
ghetto

anyway, as one of my idols, yellow kid weil said: it only takes one
mistake for the criminal to be "fired" it takes the cops a thousand.

and yer no yellow kid weil m'boy. it's time to be realistic. it's like
this: I'm being a condescending dude with no point just because there's no
chance you will respond. get it? ARGHHH I'M SO FUCKING PISSED!@$#
DAMNIT!@$ IN THE NORTH AMERICAN DUB OF SAILOR MOON THEY MADE IT A KIDDIE
SHOW!@$# IT USED TO BE... HOW TO SUM IT UP..  JAPANESE!@$!@$!#@$!#@$ NOT
SOME FUCKING AMERICAN FUCK IT'S FUCKING NOTHING BUT A SHITTY FUCKING SHIT
FUCK!#@$ ARGHHH!#@$!#@$ see.. the cd player agrees with me. it's loudly
playing tom waits. by the way.. my idols are: yellow kid weil. count
lustig. thomas paine. thomas jefferson. and napolean. Though napoleans
inflated ego often got the better of him, he was, most definately, a
genius of the highest callibre. Look at all the reforms he passed in
france.  or austerlitz. ahhhh austerlitz.. still talleyrand wuz smarter.
See, like I was saying to mogel.. seen the movie trainspotting.. it's like
about growing up and shit.. ya know?  BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA!!!!!! I FUCKING

 The story I wrote after creed said poupey was a y0lk wannabe.. - by nybar
                 
                       hah. asshole. 

listen up, BUCKO!@$ if y0lk could even APPROACH the amount of SHEER ANGST
professed in poupey, all of you sissy fucking farmy fucks would fucking
explode into nothing but a fucking shit pond full of water. SHIT and
water. sometimes even SHITTY water. If I wiped my ass with y0lk I would be
ruining this computer. tv's sqiggy agrees with me on this..

Squiggy "I'll see it, when I believe it."

listen up abe, the water zombies sold their souls to skull master because
he lied to them, tricking them into thinking that he was saving them from
the collapse of their under-sea thing and would re-animate them. DUHHHH!!
DIDN'T YOU EVEN SEE THE EPISODE YOU FUCKING RETARD!  Oh..  and the ants
whose blood hurts you are white. believe me, I know. just looke at this

      Primo shoes=Mucho profit: A buisness lesson for the 90's? - by Nybar

                                     ---------

One day.. I was going shopping at the grocery store.
Jubjub was there to. It might be noted that we got 3
boxes of fruit rollups.. which are addictive. If they
illeagelized them.. the price would skyrocket. Everyone
I know is a junky. Since this is supposed to be a buisness
lesson.. or at least the title says so.. I think I will
put in alot of ways to earn money without having to
actually do much work.
                                                                          
                             LESSON ONE: The Fruit Rollup Scam
                                            ---
                            For advanced fruit rollup scammers only
                                            ---
                             Ok.. what you do.. is go to a grocery store,
                            And scope out the fruit rollup section. Then..
                            have your partner start making a little
                            distraction.. such as running naked through the
                            aisles.. yelling "I'M A REPUBLICAN NUDIST!!"
                            or something like that. Most of the security will
                            be called in to restrain him/her (works best with
                            a female <winkwink>).Then fill up a shopping cart 
                            with all of the fruit rollups or spinnoffs on
                            display.. and run off. Most of the security will
                            be gone from the door.. and the rest just run
                            through. Make sure to conceal your face. Your
                            partner usually gets off with nothing but a slap
                            on the wrist or a rat tail in the ass or
                            something. When you get him/her out of jail, go
                            to another grocery store.. with you making the
                            distraction this time. Once you have cleaned out
                            most of the big suppliers.. you can pick junkies
                            off of the street and sell the stuff for an
                            inflated price. Another trick is to divert trucks.
                            Just be creative.

                                 Lesson 2: Coupon Fraud
                            You know those things in grocery stores that
                            automatically give out free coupons? You can only
                            get two out at first.. but eventually they come
                            back. If you run through a big grocery store.. the
                            ones that have run out will have re-loaded by the
                            time you get back to them. Then.. wait until you
                            get a clerk that looks kind of wet behind the ears.
                            Give this clerk the coupons and the stuff they are
                            for and you can get FREE stuff. YEAH!

                                 Lesson 3: The poupey seminar
                               Nybar "Hello all, I would like to thank you

                      Myself (Nybar) and jubjub had just come out
                    from grocery shopping. We were going into the car.. when
                   something odd caught my eye. Some redneck who had a beat
                  hay-truck had left his SHOES on top of the hay in back...
                  primo shoes.. to say the least. Thinking that I could later
                  sell them for mucho profit; I snatched them. Unluckily.. the
                  rednecks dog (who was in the truck) started barking. That
                  brought the redneck out. But jubjub and I managed to escape,
                  I, cursing all the while "Primo shoes.. mucho profit.. primo
                  shoes.. FUCKING MUCHO PROFIT FOR FUCKING PRIMO SHOES!!!"

               Fatguy "How would that convince me?!?!"
               Froboy "Ahh.. but the plot thickens.. care to tell the rest..
                       my alleged alibi?"

               Froboy "Then apply it I will!!! MONEY! <flashes those 20's again>
               <--------------------FLASHBACK TIME (AGAIN)---------------->
                  With Nybar still stinging from being caught by the yellow-
                  bellied cow tipper, good news would be viewed as deliverance
                  to the ones who were close to him. HAIL NYBAR, THE RAVE KING,
                  AND THE MONEYMAKING PRINCE!! That news came in the form of
                  ... well.. alot of people being shot by guns. Let me explain:
                   While jubjub was  watching TV.. he saw a program on CNN..
                   or some other such channel.. when it came to a thing about
                   peoples relatives and accquantices being shot by guns. With
                   the MAN in the white house.. little was being done to stem
                   the tides of death.. so 10,000 of the guys N gals who had 
                   known those shot were sending in the people who had been 
                   killed SHOES. They were going to put them on the steps of the
                   U.S. Senate building.. forget what it's called. Now THERE
                   were some primo shoes.. and .. repeat it with me..
                   <all> "PRIMO SHOES=MUCHO PROFIT!!"
                   So.. hopping on the train to washington with many boxes,
                   bags, and other carrying units.. nybar, jubjub, and I hopped
                   a cab to the senate building.. took the shoes.. and the rest,
                   as they say.. is history. That is how we got our start as
                   infomercial mongers.. exploiting the masses.

                           joe, my big pig?"
                    Fatguy "... yes"

                     Nybar "Indubitably"
                    Froboy "Proceed.."
                     Nybar "The final, most important, shortest.. lesson

                            going to seminars that insult your intelligance
                            and cost $100 admission"

                                1996: An URBAN Oddessy
                                ----------------------

                             Bad hangover and little sleep. To much coffee..
                    Not enough effect. My name is jubjub.. for those of you
                    who don't know. It's a normal day in my life; another
                    night in a cheap motel. As I was settling down to watch
                    some tv and listen to some music.. I was distracted by
                    a moaning sound.. and a clawing at the door. I opened the
                    door. It was my brother and then roomate nybar. He was
                    extremely beaten up. He looked like somethin outta the
                    toilet. I asked him what had happened.. and he uttered one
                    one singular; disturbing word: `Zinboobi'. I said `NO..
                    NOT Zinboobi!' right before he passed out. Let me explain
                    about that name. Now.. we used to be prize-wrestlers in
                    world wrestling federation. We were the best out there..
                    and we wanted to prove it. Those were the good days.
                    Anyway... about the name Zinboobi; The name Zinboobi
                    comes from a match we once had. At the end of the
                    wrestling season.. there is the finale; the champs fight
                    eachother. They were the other champ. We.. of course.. had
                    to strive feverously until we beat them. We worked out
                    for weeks.. often until we passed out. Whenever we talked
                    to them.. they seemed well-rested.. and confident. And
                    they never seemed to exercise. When the big match came..
                    Nybar went to say `let the best man win' in the nybar-way.
                    He came back disillusioned about wrestlings authenticity.
                    He told me he had found STERIODS in their warm-up room.
                    My hopes, dreams, and thoughts shattered around me. I would
                    never be the same. He thought we had to throw the match..
                    but I knew that if we threw the match.. we would be no
                    better then they were. We would be letting down millions
                    of fans. It would be like shoeless joe throwing the world
                    series. We had to fight. The fighting was fierce. I nearly
                    got KILLED. Good thing it was alternating. Nybar bravely
                    fought Eziekial Zinboobi while I rested. He managed to
                    win; because I had weakened him. Then.. I fought abraham
                    Zinboobi to a standstill. We had won. They swore revenge.
                    Only later did the manager tell me he had known about
                    the steriods... and if we told.. we wouldn't  live to
                    talk about it. That was the same day he got Me and nybar's
                    resignation from world-class federation wrestling. We used
                    to be rich, happy, and beloved. Now we were jobless;
                    joyless, and avoided. Still.. we fought clean. When nybar
                    came to.. he told me that while he was bringing the
                    groceries home.. he was jumped by both zinboobie's at the
                    same time. He didn't stand a chance. And he said they were
                    bigger and stronger then before. He also told me that they
                    were coming for us. He said they said something like
                    `NYBAR YOU BASTARD!  HERES A MESSAGE FOR THAT BROTHER
                    OF YOURS: THE BIG MAN DOESN'T LIKE RATS!' It was
                    tournament day all over again. I hadn't said anything
                    about it. But then I realised it. NYBAR! YOU COULDN'T
                    HAVE!!

                    Nybar "I'm sorry man. I couldn't stand it anymore. The
                    Constant guilt. The searing pain. The thought that scum
                    like that weren't kicked out. Searing my sould. Grinding
                    my bones. I haven't slept for the thought of it. I reported
                    it to my lawyer. He says we have a big case."

                    Me "I understand how you feel man. I've often thought of
                    telling about those scum myself. But I couldn't bear the
                    thought of what they might do to me and mine"

                    Nybar "The only way we are ever going to live this through
                    is together. The court date is the 21'st."

                    Me "THATS A WEEK FROM NOW!"

                    Nybar "I know. And no one *REALLY* seems to believe me.
                    Witness protection is refused. Today is going to be ...
                    difficult."

                    Me    "Today IS going to be difficult. You look bad. Sleep"

                    ....

                    Thats one of the good things about nybar.. no need to tell.
                    him twice. He was sleeping like a baby by the time his
                    head hit the pillow. If I had a pillow. But it was time
                    I started following my own advice. I hadn't slept for a
                    long time to. It was a big burder off my shouders that
                    nybar had told them. I could now sleep in peace. Now..
                    another burden. Keeping alive until the trial. Out of the
                    frying pan and into the fire.. thats me. No need for
                    serious thought now. Only need for sleep.

                    .....

                    I slept a long.. dreamless night. I woke up feeling semi
                    refreashed. Right when I woke up.. something hit me. It
                    was a smell. It smelled like pancakes and sausage. Nybar
                    was cooking breakfast. No need to get jumpy. I decided to
                    walk into the kitchen and get my fair share. I was half
                    asleep.. so it didn't really hit me until I went into the
                    kitchen. The place was wrecked. There had obviously been
                    a huge struggle. Nybar was no where to be found.. and
                    belive me.. I looked. On the door of the apartment was a
                    note. It said that if I ever wanted to see my brother
                    again.. I had to go to a particular house that was just
                    around the block. If I brought help, nybar's life was
                    forfeit. If I didn't come.. nybar was as good as dead.
                    It was a no win situation. I wish nybar were here... but
                    he was still busy being kidnapped. Those BASTARDS!!!
                    They wrecked my apartment. They broke into my abode. They
                    kidnapped my brother. I dropped to my knees, and yelled..
                    in a star trek-like way
                    "ZINNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNBBBBBBBBBBBBBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOBBBBBBBBIII
                    AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
                    This.... was.... a.... SHOWDOWN! When I arrived in the
                    building specified by the note.. everything was dark..
                    with no light switches in sight. I yelled; quite stupidly,
                    in hindsight; "HELLO!?$#% YOU BETTER BE HERE Zinboobi'S!
                    AND YOU TO, BIG MAN!" and then waited. No answer. I
                    shouted again. Still no answer. Right when I was
                    considering going out and getting help.. I heard a voice:

                    "Good night, Mr. Jubjub"

                           WHACK!

                    When I awoke.. I was in a room as dark as the one I was
                    previously in. I was sitting, tied up.. to a chair at a
                    desk.. under a very bright, hot.. light. And then I
                    noticed something else. I wasn't alone in this room. I
                    didn't know it then.. but it was the big man.

                    The big man "Greetings, Mr. Jubjub"
                    Jubjub "WHY HAVE YOU BROUGHT ME HERE?!@ WHY HAVE YOU
                            DESTROYED EVERYTHING THATS EVER MATTERED?#@?%@#%
                    The big man "Isn't it obvious? You've threatened my
                    operation!! And about me destroying everything that ever
                    mattered to you.. I assure you that your brother is quite
                    intact"
                    Jubjub "WHERE IS HE?$!~@#@%"
                    The big man "He could be... anywhere. muahahhahahaha!"
                    Jubjub "Why have you brought me here?!#?$"
                    The big man "To extend a little.. offer."
                    Jubjub "Oh.. an OFFER eh? Like WHAT.. SCUM!?"
                    The Big Man "You and your brother used to be the best
                    wrestlers I ever had. The public loved you. If you would
                    just.. drop the charges...."
                    Me "NEVER!"
                    The Big Man "Maybe you don't feel like co-operating right
                    now. A little nap might help your temper. Hanz, franz;
                    if you please?"

                                   WHACK

                     I woke up in his basement. When I saw the door.. I knew
                     there was no escape. It was bolted, and re-inforced.
                     There was one upside. Nybar was there.. looking better
                     then I probably did. Having nothing to do.. we decided
                     to tell eachother what happened. Heres nybar's story:

        Nybar        "I woke up at around eight. I was really hungry.. so I
                     decided to make breakfast. Then I heard someone knocking
                     on the door. It was the pizza guy. Still being pretty
                     tired.. I didn't notice that it was 8:35 in the morning.
                     He asked if I wanted to have his pizza... and I said
                     yeah. When I opened it.. alot of gas came out. I woke up
                     here."
        Jubjub       "So why was the apartment wrecked?"
        Nybar        "I dunno.. I guess they just decided to trash the place"
        Jubjub       "They don't only cheat.. gamble.. and other things I'm
                      sure.. they're JERKS!"
                ....
                      Just then I heard something. It was the door. Someone
                      opened it a crack and threw a loaf of bread in. It was
                      *EXTREMELY* stale. Someone said `hahahahah.. enjoy
                      your cement bread!!!'. It LITERALLY had cement in it.
                      It was hard as a brick. I made use of it in an
                      unforseen way. I threw it at the wall. Now.. the wall
                      was pretty flimsy.. and I saw one brick that was extra
                      loose. I threw the cement-bread at it and it gave in.
                      From there.. we were able to pry loose enough other
                      bricks to open a hole big enough to crawl  through.
                      WE WERE FREE!!

                              To be continued.....

                Note: What you just read was.. like.. already in some poupey
                of the past, but the other 5 weren't. I put it in cause of
                consistancy and.. stuff like that, K?

                         1996: An URBAN oddessy of nybar
                         ------------------------------

                       Howling whores and haunting hookers. Life in this city,
          how could you not love it? My name is jubjub. I work at a grocery
          store on thirty second street. But I used to be a wrestler. These
          are the chronicles of what.. how, and why it happened. I call them
          NINETEEN NINETY SIX... AN URBAN.. ODDESSY!.. except louder.
          Now.. a brief re-cap. Yesterday.. when I woke up nybar had been
          kidnapped. I found  a note.. and it's  a long story but lets just
          say I ended up right next to him in a dungeon. It turns out it was
          because he had squealed some of the wwf's secrets and a shady
          manager called `the big man' was trying to have us wiped out.
          Needles to say we escaped from the dungeon. But then.. we were
          stranded outside.. knowing we couldn't go back to my apartment
          because they would look for us there. There was 5 days until the
          trial.. and I don't think waiting for them to kill us would be
          pleasent. So  nybar made a jolly proposal. Why don't WE go after
          THEM. This is the story of the daring day2 in our urban oddessy.
            -----------    Insert Spacer here (poupey prop management)
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
          It was a big city.. and we didn't have the man.. cat.. dog.. horse
          , or anything power the scour it. The only logical solution was to
          look at the bad mooks last known (to us) hiding place. Yeah.. the
          dark room with the basement where I was knocked out twice. Ahhh..
          I have to omit that knocked out twice part in future versions.
          Anyway... we decided to go there.. for some reason or other.
          When we went in this time.. all the lights were on. It looked just
          like a wrestling ring. Waitasec;... nybar has a comment to add to
          that "Maybe it looked like a wrestling ring because thats what it
          WAS..  DIPSHIT!" Thank you for that nybar. There were two shadowy
          men standing in the corner. Before we had the oppurtunity to
          harras.. I mean question them; the PA system went on.

           "DINGDING It's the amaaaaaaaaaaaaaaazzzzzzingggggg match you've ALL
            been waiting for. The great, the buff.. the crazy team.. with
            captain crazy and his astute comrade.. HAUSS.. in one cornnneerr.
            And the great.. the grand.. the GAYbeeni brothers in the OTHER.
            Now lets give a special hand to hauss <clapclapclap> And captain
            crazy <clapclapclap> and now the gaybeeni's.. FATSLAYER AND KURDT
            <boooboooboooboooboooboooboobbbbbboooo> <someone throws an egg at
            kurdt> Kurdt "OW! Hey good lookin!" <a really fat guy stand up>
            "STOP CALLING ME THAT!!!"

          Then the gaybeeni's jumped into the ring. This was obviously one
          of the big mans sick mind games. Ohh.. that guy makes me mad.
          Needless to say.. we kicked the holy shit out of those fags. I
          mean.. come the hell on.. we were the CHAMPS. They were a couple
          of homos. The only thing was that it winded me a little.. haha..
          it was worth it to toss them into eachother. Then.. I thought it
          was over.. and we would get what we wanted. But truly.. it was
          just beginning. The PA came on again and said now we had to fight
          some other guys.. called the `ChinChaaChaa' brothers. We kicked
          their immigrated asses to. But then it came on  again... we had
          to fight some guys called the `Grassylumpkin' brothers. We got
          out a can of whoop-ass on them. But we were both getting seriously
          tired. We knocked some sense into about 10 people.. not without
          injury.. because they got progressively better... until we came
          to the ZINBOOBI'S.  This time.. it was a cage match. No ref's to
          moderate. They were stronger. We were tired and beaten. There were
          also 4 other guys in the cage. The Mad Svedes (actually SPELLED
          with a v) Gabriel and Chinvorken, and the Pomper Oppers, Hanz
          and Franz. The real turning point was when nybar grabbed a big
          rusty monkey wrench and knocked Ezekial Zinboobia out.. and while
          abraham was shouting something about revenge to him.. I threw hanz
          AND franz at him. Chinvorken and gabriel were easy after that.
          During all the fighting.. there was one thing we hadn't noticed..
          WE WERE ALL LOCKED IN A FRIKKIN CAGE@@#%!!! THE FRAGGING BIG MAN
          HAD CAPTURED US AGAIN@$#%@#!~!@$!!!!!! But this time.. we weren't
          going to be trapped. Nybar grabbed some plyers, and I got a
          chainsaw that was also in the cage.. and pretty soon we cut our
          way to freedom. We searched the place bare to the bone.. but we
          didn't find anything. The importance of this was.. we were once
          again the wrestling champs!! We had defeated, cage match, 6 of  
          the best of the best. So of course we called put all the guys who
          were still knocked out in the cage.. and while I guarded it nybar
          called the police. There were no REAL charges to convict them of..
          but since it was new-york.. theyyy worked something out. All of
          them got 20 to life. Also.. many of the police force who helped
          convict them got a raise. You can thank the overcrowded, crooked;
          `Revolving door' prison system for this. It can work in mysterious
           ways! Having seen that we were ready.. willing.. and better then
           ever.. we decided to go back into the wrestling biz. But there
           was no way I was signing up with that sleaze ball.. the big man.
           So we both decided to do a tag team thing for the CCF
           (crazy chicken federation). They do good work.. and they are like
           a family out there. Except when you are engulfing each-other in
           flames.. and hitting the other guy with a wooden spoon and the
           like. Then they AREN'T like family. Anyway.. just as we had signed
           up.. and our first match on the way.. I was on top of the world.
           I was thinking how all the good stuff happened to me.. and, since
           I am the one who would ultimately write this.. all the bad stuff
           happened to nybar. Yup.. things couldn't be better. And then it
           happened.

                              BLAM!@#%

           Nybar "DAMN! SHOOT JUBJUB WILL YOU?@#5? BASSSSSSSSSSSSSTTTTTTTAAAAA
           RRRRRRRRRRRRRDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!"

               NEXT WEEK: With jubjub in the hospital.. waiting for death,
               and  nybar on the streets.. searching for the answer to
               his seething question: WHO IS THE BIG MAN?

                    Ciao next week, dahlin.

                         1996: An URBAN Oddessy

                              -----------

                     Ever notice how hard a good beginning is to think of? I'm
                    jubjub.. albiet comatose. Now heres a ironic story. Little
                    billy used to read comics..and he loved all the powers the
                    people in them had. But he espically lovvveeddd the idea
                    of psionics. He tried everything to get them. Finally..
                    when he was busy bombarding himself with cosmic-rays.. he
                    passed out. He was in a complete comatose state.
                    There was an up side though; while he was passed out.. he
                    had the thing he had been dreaming of!! He had madd.....
                    psionic skillllllzzzzzzz. He decided to telepathically
                    monitor peoples bathrooms.. that sicky!! But when he
                    recovered.. he had lost his mind powers. No one would
                    believe him, that was what drove him insane. What I am
                    trying to say is... being comatose gives you psychic
                    powers. The psychic network is a HOSPITAL! First I chose
                    to turn my great powers inward. I saw me being shot; most
                    likely by one of the big mans men.. and being carried to
                    this damnable hospital!! Oh my god.. can't believe I just
                    said damnable!! Anyway.. here I am. Psychic. I think I
                    will look at some bathrooms.

                    Meanwhile.. at the white house....

             Hillary Clinton "Hmmm.. I am getting some mind vibes from
             the aliens I connect with's invisible flying psychic monkies
             GET OUT OF MY HEAD, JUBJUB!!"

                    And now back to jubjub....

                    Man that really sucked. I think instead I will watch nybar
                    jumping around the city. I bet he's on his high heels
                    looking for the scum that shot me. Hmmm.. there he is now;
                    at the PIZZA parlor?!@#@% What the hell is he doing there.
                    hmm.. probably looking for clues. LETS GET SOME SOUND!

                    Cut to pizza parlor......

                    Nybar "`ey tony... I wanna know whats up with all this
                    grease man!!"
                    Tony  "I dunno.. I ask da godfather"
                    godfather "<mumblemumble>"
                    Nybar "You have straightened me out, oh godfather"
                    Jubjub "NYBAR! I AM CONTACTING ME PSYCHICLY!!"
                    Nybar "No your not.."
                    Godfather <mumblemumble>
                    Nybar "Oh of course, godfather"
                    Jubjub "WHY THE HELL AREN'T YOU LOOKING FOR THE GUY WHO
                    SHOT ME?!"
                    Nybar "I WAS LOOKING FOR CLUES <whispered> to why there
                    is so much grease on tony's greasy pizza"
                    Jubjub "ahh.. I heard that.. I can read your mind"
                    Nybar "OH YEAH?!@#%"
                    Jubjub "YEAH!"
                    Nybar *thinking*: Jubjub is a jerk.
                    Jubjub "Stop thinking about me and look for my gunman!!"
                    Nybar *Thinking*: Ok... jerk.

                    And so nybar begins his little oddessy. How can he
                    possibly keep this realistic.. while at the same time being
                    original?! The answer is.. he CAN'T!

                    Cut to nybar narritive...
                   It was a dark and stormy night. Thats as far as I got on
                   my murder mystery novel. Anyway.. back to the hunt.
                   Shouldn't be hard to find whoever shot jubjub. I'll just
                   have my cats scour the city... and I can sit back.. waiting
                   for one of them to page me.

                   <five minutes later>
                   beepbeepbeep. <click> bopbopbopbopbopbopbop <ringring>
                   Nybar "Heyyy... rusty? MY CAT! You made quick work of that
                   one!!! Where is he now? Ok.. me and some pussy will go and
                   do.. something.. to him. Love you to. It's in the fridge,
                   next to the casserole.. bye"
                   <click>

             And so our not so heroic hero went along his gelatinous
             journey into suspense. And so.. we cut to the chase; literally:

                  Cut to nybar and four cats chasing a petty thug in a GTI `96:
                                      ======
                       Nybar "GIVE IT UP!"
                       Thug  "NEVER!"
                       Nybar "THATS IT!! I'M RAMMING YOU!!@$"

                       <BLAM!>

                       <scccccccckkkkkkkkkkkrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeee>

                       <BOOM!>

                       ARRRRRHGGGGHHHHH!!!!!!

                         .... a slight bit later

                       Nybar "TALK! TALK! WHO PUT YOU UP TO THIS?!@#"
                       Thug  "Slow down buddy..
                       <nybar slaps the petty thug in the face wayyy to hard>
                       Nybar "Don't try to smooth talk me!@##### WHY THE HELL
                       DID THE BIG MAN TELL YOU TO SHOOT JUBJUB??!!!!!?$!@$"
                       Thug  "He just wanted ta show you guys that he was
                       tracking you. It's nothing compared to what he'll do ta'
                       YOU... buddy!"
                       <nybar gives the order.. and the cats suck the breath
                       out of the petty thug>
                       Vimto "Good taste..
                       Nybar "Yeah.. but we've lost our only lead.."

                       *jubjub and nybar mentally converse*

                       Jubjub "Not necessarily.. ever think of searching him?"
                        Nybar "No.. not really.."
                       Jubjub "I'm breaking off communications, idiot"

                        ...
                       Nybar gives the order

                      <the cats search the thug>
              TailyPo "Hmm.. well.. we found the big mans buisness
              card.. mightttt be useful."
              Nybar   "Ahhh.. right. Any address on that thing?"
              Tailypo "Nope. It does have  his name.."
              Nybar   "Ok.. His name is Guy Incognito. Wow.. I just
              have NO idea who that is."
              Tailypo "Hmmm... we could look in the phonebook..

                      A short time later...

              <click> bopbopbopbopbopbopbop <ringggg>
              The big man "Dude.  Dude. This is the big man"
              Nybar "Ok man.. it's me.. nybar. I wanna ask a few
              questions.. ok?"
              The Big Man "How the hell did you get this number?!@#%"
              Nybar "Man.. you musta been no copus mentus when you
              gave that small time jerk who shot jubjub your buisness
              card.. now listen up; There's 4 days before the trial.
              If you confess.. you set yourself up for <not so>
              leniant punishment."
              The Big Man "HAH! Never! And remember that job you
              signed up for?#% With the CCF?!(crazy chicken federation) Well,
              I've taken the liberty of taking your boss, who; just scant
              months ago.. was generally acknowledged as the best wrestler
              ever!!"
              Nybar "Are you really that lame? I've already been through one
              wrestling match cause of you... I don't need another. Can't you
              just shoot me@#? It would be better then this unyielding
              corniness!!"
              The Big Man "That.. could be arranged."

                    <suddenly, a booming voice, jubjub's.. is heard within the
                     playgrounds of the big mans mind>
             *RELENT*
             *SUBMIT*
             *ADMIT IT; YOU ARE CROOKED*
             The Big Man "Ahh.. jubjub. I was once in a coma myself. Well..
             heres a suprise for you: I had a psychic backwash unit installed
             in my noggin.. So that anyone within 100 miles of here, and with
             telepathic powers, will be able to recieve my little gift. Pain
             beyond belief! Of course... you can't hear me. It's hit you by
             now. MUAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHQ#W%)*!#@%)#@%*#@%_*!"

                 <cut to jubjub in hospital>

             Jubjub *thinking* "YARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH!!!!
             PAIN! WHERES MY ASPECREME WHEN I.. ARFRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHHH@!#$@
             @#!%_(% Can't.. Reach.. utilitAHHHHHHHHHHHHH#@%@#%_(@#%_@#(%!
             only way is to.. heal my own wounds.. turn my ACK!$ great powers
             inward, and heal my body with my mind, So that I will no longer
             be comatose, or telepathic.. and thus I won't get all this pain!
             Well.. this is as good a YARGHH! time as any"

             AND THUS, JUBJUB WAS HEALED

             Jubjub "I'M HEALED!"
             Head Nurse "Damn. Then I guess we can't charge you for all that
             quack surgeory we had planned."

             Back to nybar, who in the meanwhile has heeded the big mans call,
             corny though it was:

             Nybar "Why.. it's Wrestlin' Crazy Chicken himself! I used to love
             to watch your show! I never dreamed I would work for you.. much
             less wrestle with you."
             Crazy Chicken "I only work with the best kid, cause thats what I
             am. Now.. as a way for his employer to evaluate his employee's
             skills.. I shall wrestle you."
             Nybar "But what about the big man? What does he have to do with
             this?"

             <suddenly, the all elusive PA system comes on>
             A question I was hoping you would ask! I; THE BIG MAN <lightning>
             Am taping this little bout. You will both, wrestling together..
             be the biggest draw of the century. Think.. Fightin Mad Crazy
             Chicken and Captain Crazy, back in the ring, better then ever!!
             Why.. I'm even selling tickets.. why do you think I chose THIS
             location?

             Nybar "I.. don't.. SEE.. any people. This place still looks like
             a glass house with a wrestling ring inside."

             <PA system>
             I.. don't.. SEE.. why your so stupid!! You are behind one way
             glass!!

             Nybar "I guess that makes sense.. but what would you do if I
             said I wasn't wrestling?"

             <PA system>
             I would have several of my guards shoot both of you down where
             you stand

             Nybar "Good answer. Lets wrestle, Mr. Chicken."

             AND SO THE BATTLE IS JOINED! bumbadumbadumbaduma.. DINGDINGDING!

             Nybar fakes a left punch, and goes for the groin with his right
             foot!

             DIRECT HIT!

             Crazy chicken is staggered.. WAIT.. FAKING IT! He does his famous
             KFC: With a VENGANCE! Frying Foot Move on nybar.

             Nybar seeeeemmmsss to be down for the count. Wait.. he's getting
             up!!

             WHAP! Nybar gives him famous whap attack! It's a butt cheek..
             right where you need it the least!  The mouth!!@%

             Crazy chicken doesn't look like he even felt it.. and he goes
             into his patented crazy chicken pork chops, the OTHER white meat
             hold..

             It holds!! Nybar can't move!! Waitaminute.. he's using his famous
             cat-fight move! Know those things in heithcliff where,  when
             some people/cats/dogs/horses are fighting.. a big dustball comes
             up? Nybar can duplicate that move!! No one can escape it until
             all but one stand. And now.. the wait..

             <blamblam.. SMASH!>

             Hours Later....

             <the dusball dies down, with nybar lying; UNCONCIOUS, and crazy
              chicken, victorious.. bleeding in a bloody mess alll over the
              place>

             More hours, and many band-aids later..

              <nybar and crazy chicken sit at a cafe.. covered in mickey-mouse
               bandaids from head to foot.>
             Nybar "God damn.. I've *NEVER* been beaten after ensuing my
             famous cat scratch fever move!! Where did you learn to fight so
             well?@#%"
             Crazy Chicken "Well.. there is only a certain amount of potential
             that can be reached without making pilgremage.. to HIM."
             Nybar "Who.. Might `him' be?"
             Crazy Chicken "The Ancient Yiddish god of wrestling. FROBOY!"
             Nybar "Hmmm.. who is this froboy?"
             Crazy Chicken "Originally.. he was a brilliant yiddish monk. His
             masterworks of literature, art, and science impressed all. But
             he was not satisfied. He wouldn't be satisfied until he, and ALL
             yiddish monks.. weren't such wimps. He was developing wrestling.
             And he has been developing wrestling for 1356 years since. Like
             the fonz; no one is worth his punches. He is simply to good to
             wrestle.. so he teaches. He is almost as good a teacher as he is
             a wrestler. I remember when he was teaching me. I was full of
             empty bravado back then. I dared challenge him to a wrestling
             match. He didn't even respond. So I had the nerve to attack him.
             I used my best hold on him. He didn't move. But his fro did. Oh
             did it move. It threw me off.. and beated me repeatedly about the
             neck and shoulder area.  When I awoke I was back at my house. I
             never saw him, or went to his temple, again."
             Nybar "So.. where does he live? Can I just give him a knock?"
             Crazy Chicken "To get to him.. you must make a PILGRIMAGE! That
             means giving away all of your worldly belongings. Oh.. and a
             travelling partner helps to."
             Nybar "Hmm.. jubjub would be the choice for that.. but he's
             hospitalized.."

             <jubjub jumps in>
             Jubjub "It would seem reports of my hospitalization are quite..
             exaggerated! I Over heard the whole conversation.. and I would
             love to develop my talents to the maximum level also! I SHALL
             PILGREMAGE WITH THEE!"
             Nybar "No need to be so dramatic. Take a seat. Have some coffee..
             or that would be co-co.. for you. Let us catch up."
             Jubjub "Not right now.. maybe while we are on the long journey
             to froboy's temple."
             Nybar "Ahh.. how are we going to get there?"
             Crazy Chicken "I can be your mystical guide. I CAN SHOW YOU THE
             WAY, TO DESTINY!"

             <all> "TO DENSEITY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

   Must.. push... on. Must.. reach.. wrestling.. perfection. My.. name.. is...
   jubjub. I... can.. only.. talk..
   incredibly.. slowly. The.. cause.. of.. this.. affliction would be.. not
   enough.. food. I fear we shan't be making it. For those of you just joining
   us in this realm of zinboobi's and.. sleazy managers.. We, (I, Nybar, And
   our boss/mystical guide.. crazy chicken) are trudging through these ancient
   snowed over yiddish lands to find.. DESTINY! DESTINY IN WRESTLING!!!! We..
   seek.. RETRIBUTION FOR THE SINS OF THE MANAGERS! In other words.. we were
   going to see the god of wrestling himself to ask him if he could help us
   reach full potential while at the same time protecting us from the big man.
   But then.. I saw it!!#$ THE TEMPLE OF FROBOY, THE GOD OF WRESTING! YEAH@!
   Was it true? Had we done it? It was true. We had, momentarily.. shaken off
   the yoke of this hard society. No more anything.. but peace and bliss.
   Someone named mogel greeted us when we entered. I extended my hand of
   all is well in the univereness. In response to this, he said "GET THE HELL
   AWAY FROM ME, FAG! WHAT THE FUCK IS YOUR PROBLEM?!$ GET YER HAND OUTTA MY
   FACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!" ahh... all WAS well in the universe. I kicked him in the
   balls and nybar engulfed him in flames. We were on our way. The next room
   was made entirely of fro picks that had been bronzed. On a throne of hair,
   in the middle of a wrestling ring.. was the almight god of wrestling.
   FROBOY HIMSELF! WOOHOO:P!@#% He smiled as nybar and I entered.. but when
   crazy chicken walked in.. he grinned in wimsical amusement. "Ahh.. the
   insolent one returns. Care for another wrestling bout?" he said. Crazy
   chicken kind of slinked off. Jubjub "We've come to.. ahh.."
   Froboy "Have me teach you how to kick major beefed up wrestler ass.. while
   keeping you in my sanctuary, to make sure you don't get killed?"
   Nybar "Basically.."
   Froboy "First of all.. I ask one question of YOU.. and one only. How the
   hell did you find this place; crazy chicken?"
   Crazy Chicken "Well.. I once had a bet with someone that he didn't even
   know his own zip code. So he said that he did. When it turned out he didn't
   (hehe.. 5 dollars right there) I bet him he couldn't walk to his own house
   from 3 blocks away. Well.. he started walking, with me following. We
   eventually ended up in the sahara desert.. where we found a temple. The
   goddess of baked potatoes temple. I asked her a few questions about
   wrestling.. and she; disgusted.. teleported me to you. And thats pretty
   much it. I think the guy who didn't know his own address is still wandering
   the world. Or maybe he has become a high priest of the potato order. (High
   priestism not being hard to attain.. she just had one baboon as a worshiper
   when we got there.)"
   Froboy "And now.. you may ask many questions of me."
   Nybar  "Why.. are we here?"
   Froboy "No exastential questions please."
   Crazy Chicken "Want to wrestle again?"
   <silence>
   Crazy Chicken "I've learned alot of new moves, ya know."
   <silence>
   Crazy Chicken "I really think I have a chance of winning.. and all.."

                                    WHAM!
   Jubjub "Will.. he be waking up?"
   Froboy "It is beneath me to use lethal force"
   Jubjub "So.. you gonna send him back to his place, like last time?"
   Froboy "Yup. I think I will send him there naked.. with the hypnotically
   implanted idea in his mind that he has had an alien encounter"
    Nybar "Elite"
   Jubjub "But there is still the matter of how you will teach us to be the
   best."
   Froboy "This question is most simply answered. I sense *GREAT* angst within
   both of you two. You have been slighted many a time. That is why you are
   two of the greates wrestlers who have ever graced my doorstep. Training you
   shall be SIMPLE! Your angst levels must reach the infinite level!"
   Jubjub "But.. isn't this infinity level just quack science? It's impossible
   and you know it!"
   Froboy "Oh please.. don't insult me. I have many the means to make your
   souls *BOIL!*. Please.. gaze into my ORBS OF INFINITY!!"

            <three orbs arise from the dankest depths of the fro>

   Froboy "These orbs hold the *KEY* to angst. They sense what will best set
   your soul aflame FOREVER!#$% May I have a volunteer?"
   Jubjub "Me! Me!"
   Froboy "Gaze first upon orb #1 (obviously..)"

   Jubjub looks into the orb.. and see's...:

                     Here is the story of Tommy Winesworth. He was born in
         poopoo city.. where his father had great hopes that he could
         someday go to bireland.. and get a monopoly on the potato crops. Vain
         hopes. He ran away to america when he was eleven. There was no way
         he would have made it anywhere there.. except for one thing. He had
         the almost super-power of learning. Any obstacle that stood in his
         way.. he would learn  something `NEW' to get around it. He decided
         the best way to put this to work was to become a wrestler. Many
         years later.. he was nearly the champ of the world. He would have
         been years ago.. but he was extremely lazy.. and.. he had other
         interests... by then he had a beautiful wife and a son, Robbie
         Winesworth. One day.. he decided to box a charity bout.. with two
         virtually unknowns.. nybar and jubjub. It was a tag-team match.. so
         he decided to bring his wife. Hey.. if she was in danger.. he would
         just learn something `NEW' to save her. Nybar and Jubjub were very
         worried about his learning power. But they had a plan.
                            ...

                 Robbie sips his hot co-co. 

                 Robbie "I learned.. about.. froboy's life. And it all made 
                 sense. Chaos; order. Two sides of the same coin. Human
                 nature.. wrestling.. forever intertwined. Good;.."
                 Nybar  "I get the point.. enough with the paradoxial things,
                 boyeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee."
                 Jubjub "Shut up nybar.."
                 Nybar <growl>
                 Jubjub "So.. what did you see?"
                 Robbie "Long ago.. far away.. froboy was creating the world
                 of wrestling. Aye.. he was creating the world of wrestling..
                 and he cast a shadow. This shadow had no real name.. no real
                 form.. he was simply all that was evil in wrestling. And so,
                 as froboy created.. the creature destroyed. Froboy discovered
                 this treachery.. and was most displeased. He showed his
                 displeasure in a most.. err.. direct.. way. He wrestled the
                 vile fiend. It broke all the rules. He fought clean. Through
                 wits.. superior skill and strength.. he managed to force it
                 into a cave in the center of a marshmellow. Don't laugh. It
                 was a *BIG* marshmellow. But it was not truly dead. It was
                 festering. Growing powerful. Raising.. AN ARMY! It .. through
                 sheer bitterness.. created a construct of PURE EVIL. The
                 beast had no proper materials.. so it used what it had at
                 hand. So; thus.. it created the Great General of the
                 Insidious Army of `25.. THE STAY-PUFF MARSHMELLOW MAN.. LORD
                 OF EVIL!!! With this army.. he martched on froboy's temple.
                 He hadn't a chance. He managed to flee.. and raise an army
                 of his own.. all the wrestlers in the world!! The battle
                 lines were drawn. Though the marshmellow constructs and
                 walking reptiles that Great Beast employed were somewhat;
                 how should I say it.. puffy, they were quite numerous. The
                 fighting was fierce. Froboy himself single handedly destroyed
                 the marshmellow man. Both armies were locked in combat. There
                 was nothing to keep froboy and his shadow off eachother.
                 Froboy.. already nearly out for the count from the beating he
                 took at the hands of the marshmellow man.. was severely
                 outmatched. So he resorted to thinking. And then.. a
                 revalation struck him. The Great Shadow sought to instill
                 order in the world.. his order.. but order none the less.
                 On the other hand.. froboy himself sought nothing but to keep
                 things as they were before (they were in a state of general
                 chaos.) Thus.. he championed chaos.. and  his shadow wanted
                 order. He preclaimed these words.. which are now engraved in
                 the corner of his fro "Armies of chaos.. take heed! I, FROBOY,
                 patron god of wrestling.. CHAMPION OF CHAOS.. MASTER OF THEE;
                 proclaim that you will fight he who would instill order in the
                 land! LETS KICK HIS ASS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

                 ...

                 The rest of the battle was quite predictable. This time..
                 after being defeated.. the dark one was completely destroyed!
                 If he had had no form before.. now he was barely even a part
                 of reality. He now had to assume others shapes to take power.

                               ----------

       <jubjub, nybar.. and crazy chicken.. stand over a map in the war room>

              Crazy Chicken: "Hmmm.. I think that our plan of attack
                             should be divide and conquer.  If everyone
                             does his job.. our victory is ensured."
                   Nybar: "Just as I was thinking. We could use a mix
                           of the final formations of the boer war.. the
                           confederate strategam at chancelorsville.. and alot
                           of late night spy movies"
                  Jubjub: "Just what the HELL are you two talking about?!@$"
                   Nybar: "Hmm.. I was proposing a plan based on the
                           relative size crazy chicken federations army as
                           compared to the Prince of Despairs. Now.. we
                           would split the army in 2. Jubjub and crazy
                           chicken would be in command of the two sides.
                           The two sides would be on the top and the
                           bottom of the grand army of darkness.. which
                           intelligence reports is going to be marching
                           en-masse. After that.. the two sides split
                           again.. into 4 units.. lead by Stinky Kanoot
                           and Robby Winesworth. Stinky kanoot and Robby
                           Winesworth's units will go to the left and
                           right of the Insidious Army.. flanking them.
                           While this is happening.. the sides under
                           command of jubjub and Crazy Chicken will be
                           attacking from both sides.. while the other 2
                           sides will be dug in.. cutting off the supply
                           line, reinforcements.. fleeing units.. and
                           communications. We should, eventually.. be able
                           to wear them out sufficentaly to have won the war!"

                  Jubjub: "In ENGLISH!"
                  Nybar:  "IIII.. think I'll take command of your part of the
                          army.. any objections?"
                  Jubjub "Ummm.."
                  Crazy Chicken "Just what will jubjub be doing, at the time?"
                  Nybar "He will *BE* going to froboy's.. who hopefully will
                  be able to raise re-inforcements.. and come up with some
                  kind of brilliant plan."
                  Crazy Chicken "Elite"
                  Jubjub: "Ok.. *THAT* I understood.. I just have one question,
                          why the hell do you have a WAR room inside a wrestling
                          `stronghold'!@$?!?$@"
                  Crazy Chicken "Shut up.. your waisting time! RUN.. Don't
                                 WALK.. to froboby's"
                  Jubjub "Ohhh noo.. I'm going to LIMP there. Jerk"
                  <jubjub limps out the door>
                  Jubjub eventually reached froboy.. who was glad to supply
                  troops.. fine wrestlers one and all. They marched back to
                  the WWF HQ.. where nybar plan seemed to be working. From a
                  distance. From a distance.

                  ...

                  Nybar and crazy chicken.. taking their respective sides of
                  the army to WWF HQ.. and following the plan.. soon had the
                  whole of the WWF army tied in knots. For some reason.. all
                  of the WWF army didn't move at all.

                  Tick.Tick.Tick.Tick.Tick.Tick.

                  <Froboy and jubjub arrive with re-inforcements>

                  Froboy "Whats that ticking?"

                  Nybar  "Nooo ide--"

                  BOOM@!$!@$!@$

                  Most of the CCF and Froboy's army were completely decimated.
                  The only thing that would win the day now was on the spot
                  tactical manuevering.. which was nybar's specialty. Which
                  was when the second bad thing happened. Nybar vanished. No
                  explanation.. no flashing lights.. just; gone. The world of
                  organized wrestling as we know it was in trouble. *BIG*
                  trouble. I kind of phased out. A little later on... I phased
                  back in to find that I was the only survivor. It was all up
                  to me. FIE on this kind of responsibility!#$% All I really
                  wanted was a cheese burger!@#$ So I decided to get one.
                  Contrary to popular belief.. there are great elite cheese
                  burger stands at certain great elite cheese-burger liking
                  states across america. So I decided to grab foders latest
                  guide. By a funny mix-up in the space/time continuim.. the
                  latest foders guide to cheese-burger stands happened to be
                  the one from 2050. Well that was just great; I thought. My
                  whole professional life was collapsing around me.. and I got
                  to learn about  the cheese burger of tomorrow. But no
                  problem. I'm great at waiting around.. and it said that; if 
                  wait around enough.. the best cheese-burgers anywhere will
                  be located in nevada.. cleveland.. I think it's in. Nevada..
                  odd.. thats the one place that nybar could never find on the
                  map. Actually.. whenever cleveland came up in casual (or not
                  so casual.. as the case usually is with nybar) conversaition
                  ... nybar would say something like `where? What the hell are
                  you talking about? Cleve..how did you say it..cleaveblonde..
                  don't know what you are talking about.. my friend.' Hitch
                  hiking is fun. Wait for the person or people who are crazy
                  enough to pick up a complete stranger and take them; in close
                  proximity.. to a destination of their choice. Alot of
                  hitch-hikers had consience problems robbing people who were
                  kind enough to pick them up. I didn't.

                  <meanwhile.. in the place where nybar re-appeared to.. nybar
                   is watching TV>

                  Baba Wawa Juniow "hahaha.. yes.. hope this doesn't turn out
                  to be like the notorious hitch-hiking robberies of 54 years
                  back."

                  <system lady who sometimes comes on TV and just talks> "For
                  the information of some of our younger viewers.. the hitch
                  hiking robberies were a series of robberies that occured in
                  1996. They involved a still unknown hitchhiker being picked
                  up.. stating his destination as closer to nevada.. and then
                  .. upon arriving.. beating the holy shit out of the one who
                  was kind (stupid) enough to pick him up. Back to you baba!"

                  Nybar *thinking* "hmmm.. this hitch-hiking robber sounds
                  like my kind of guy. Wow.. 1996.. that was the year I
                  dissappeared.. wow does that bring back memories!"

                  <the present; jubjub>

                  NEVADA OR BUST.
                  ----------------

                  That was my brilliant sign. I should be there soon. With the
                  money from those people I have been robbing.. I should be
                  able to buy several good cheese-burgars. Maybe set up a new
                  life in Nevada. Oh yeah.. I just forgot something.. I have
                  a freaking lot of waiting to do before nevada will be cheese
                  burger capitol of the world. Still.. I have a plan...
                  adapted from old episodes of `Star Trek' and some of froboy's
                  teachings. All I had to do was use the images from the orb's
                  froboy had showed me to get all mad and angsty.. and when
                  I was about to pass out like I did before.. I would `take
                  a chill pill' err.. in laymens terms.. jumping in a tub of
                  extremely cold water that was fast being cooled by the air
                  conditioner place. Then.. let myself pass out when it had
                  iced over. Bet you are wondering how the extreme cool would
                  last for 54 years. HAH! I have that worked out. I will put
                  some of the money I have stolen.. scammed.. and just plain
                  beaten off of people to use on a 54 year warrenty guarenteed
                  air-condition. And if it doesn't work for 54 years.. I will
                  sue for enough money to make sure I can buy one that lasts!
                  Ahh.. my plan is so damn perfect. 

                   <nybar's perspective.. 2050>

                 Man... is my job great. I think Mr. Hapsburg really likes me.
                 I like him at least. I can feel a promotion coming on. Maybe
                 someday I will become vice-president of our outpost.

                 Jubjub "Okk.. let me see. Good.. still got the money where I
                 left it!@$ I just hope we haven't drastically changed
                 currency. Then I will have to sell my body. And you know how
                 much I *HATE* doing that. <grin>. Waitasec.. who the hell am

                 Jubjub "Hmm.. that angsty freeze thing worked.. maybe some
                 other froboyish star-trek tricks will come in handy. Ok..
                 gotta sound real official!"
                 <jubjub pauses for a sec as he gets *THE LOOK*>
                 Jubjub "Computer! Status Report!"

                 are you talking about.. `status report'?"
                 Jubjub "Just tell me why the hell are we 300 feet in the Air!"
                 <at this moment.. several mighty advanced gods ponder how
                 jubjub knew that he was exzactly 300 feet in the air. One of
                 them plants the seeds of war.. somewhere in the past.. to
                 help him concentrate>
                 Carl "We're 300 feet in the air.. because one day.. someone
                 who really LOVVVVVVEEEEEEEDDDDDDD the jetsons as a kid was
                 elected president. He decided that; in a jetsonsish way..
                 everyone should live in the clouds. But.. since the poles
                 that the jetsons had used were a bit dated.. they decided to
                 use anti-grav pods."
                 Jubjub "Ahh.. yeah.. real interesting.. I'm sure."
                 Carl "Thanks for the classic brush off.. shit head!!@$"
                 Jubjub "You know.. I used to be a proffessional wrestler. I
                 eat punks like you for breakfast!@$"

                 Jubjub considers that the threat he just uttered was to some
                 smarmy computer. Just for a second.. though.

                 Jubjub "Okok.. anyway. How the hell do I get down?"
                 Carl "Grade A Vexme shot. It implants a self replicating
                 piece of pig DNA in you system"
                 Jubjub "Pig.. DNA?"
                 Carl "Remember the old saying `when pigs fly out of my ass!'
                 well.. one day.. a part time farmer.. part time biochemist
                 with good backround in genetics.. got really annoyed by that
                 saying. So he decided to do something about it. He puzzled
                 over what to do for a long time.. and eventually decided
                 that he would crossbreed a species of pig with a species of
                 piegon. Finally.. he had a flying pig. Then.. to have it
                 fly out of someones ass.. he fathered a son with a pre
                 implanted self replicating gene of flying pig.. placed
                 in just the right spot so pigs would fly out of his ass over
                 and over. But it didn't quite work.. the metabolism of the
                 boy adapted to that of the flying pig.. and pretty soon they
                 had a messy.. flying boy. To make a long story short.. I
                 poke you with needle. Ouch. Hurts. You fly."
                 Jubjub "Yeah.. thats real intersting. Just give me the stupid
                 shot."
                 <carls robotic arm pokes jubjub with a needle>
                 Jubjub "Ouch. Hurts."
                 <jubjub steps out the door and begins to fly>
                 Jubjub "This is a pretty elite feeling! If I didn't now have
                 a mini snout and long ears.. that would have been the perfect
                 shot!@$"

                 Nybar "Yeah.. I had wondered about that. But your looking
                 well."

                 Jubjub "yeah.. same to you. Hmm.. soo.. I guess that decent
                 wrestling will be destroyed if we don't get back there.."

                 Nybar "ohhhhhhhhh yeahhhhhh.. the *WRESTLING* thing. I
                 thought there was something important I should be doing."

                 Jubjub "Soooo.. what do you know about time travel?"

                 Nybar "Wellll.. the logic of 1996 says there can be time
                 travel.. but it will never be precise. Well.. That is the
                 logic of 1996. These days.. we coast through life using TV
                 logic. As you well know.. people like us, in TV.. travel in
                 time every day of the week. So anyway.. ready to back to 1996
                 ..?"

                 Jubjub "Suresure."

                 <BOOF! (boof being the sound of nybar and jubjub travelling
                 back in time to a point in time slightly after the explosion
                 that decimated both good and evil armies)>

                Froboy "LET US DO BATTLE.. HOOTCH.."

                <BOOF!>

                <jubjub and nybar appear>

                Now.. before going into the next sequence.. I would like to
                say that.. since the ultimate lord of all dispair and froboy
                are both merely reflections of eachother.. thought varying
                in matters of good.. evil.. chaos.. order.. they tend to think
                about practically the same thing at the same time.

                Froboy  *thinking*
                    First nybar dissappears and jubjub slinks off... and
                now they both reappear.. I'm getting confused

                The Guy Who Has A Name That Changes ALOT *Thinking*
                Nybar and jubjub.. appearing out of thin air! Think I will eat
                them!
                
                (both god and his shadow.. at the same time) "WHAT THE FUCK?"
 
                Nybar "DEJA VU ALL OVER AGAIN!@$ I've *SEEN* This exzact scene
                ... though from a different perspective. It was about a war
                and obscure techno-god planted the seeds of to help him gain
                concentration. This was a picture from the final battle sight.
                Hmm.. wierd."
                The Dark and INSIDOUS lord of dark and INSIDIOUS stuff "hmm..
                I fail to understand your logic."
                Nybar "let me explain. Baba Wawa Juniow.. from the year 2050
                ...."
                Froboy "2050?!~!@$"
                Nybar "after I dissipeared I was in.. nebarbera..... 2050."
                Froboy "ahh.. right."
                Nybar <SIGH>

                The dark and insidious lord of all evil, froboy.. nybar.. and
                jubjub sit around a card table.. sipping tea.. while they all
                hear the whole story of how nybar lived and worked in nevada,
                2050.

                ....

               Nybar "so anyway.. baba wawa juniow hacked (or as she would put
               it.. hawcked) into the techno-god system.. and read an obscure
               article from some obscure techo-god that he had planted a data
               packet in the mind of a young tibettan infant many years ago
               teaching him all the tricks of wrestling. I believe that young
               infant grew into you.. froboy."
               Froboy "So.. it was all a scam?!@$ To help some fucker
               CONCENTRATE?@#%?@?#?@!#$?!?@$?!@?$?!@?$??$#!?@?$?!@$?!@"
               The Dark Lord "I do not appreciate being used in this way.."
               Froboy "What do you say we use.. what was it you called it..
               `TV Logic' to go and give all those fucking `techno gods' what
               what for"
               The Dark Lord "For once.. I side with you.. <shudder> pal."
               ...
               The rest few hours were a breeze. With The Dark Lord learning
               some rules.. and froboy breaking some.. and finally travelling
               to another place.. another time.. Nybar and I were left alone
               with our lives again. We were wrestlers. This is what we did.
               Now.. I wasn't so sure. I felt really screwed over.. actually.
               I mean.. we had helped steer the destiny of wrestling more then
               any mortal to date.. but lets face it. Wrestling was just some
               absurd invention of a lesser techno-godling. It really pissed
               me off. But nybar had a plan. Sell the story. It wouldn't be
               hard.. I mean.. it is a pretty good story. And if your reading
               this.. maybe it means things worked out pretty well.. after all
               .

                                     FIN

                   Nybar "MUAHAHAHAHHAHA!$!@$!$ Sorry.. I just had an
                   insatible desire to get the last laugh in. Fin.. for real"

                  oh man that fucking sucked.. ohh man.. oh fuck sucky ohh
                man that fucking sucked oh man fucking sucky I hated that
                oh fuck I sold out so much oh fuck ahh well.
