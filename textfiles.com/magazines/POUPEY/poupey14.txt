   Mogels Birthday, alla Kaia  -Kaia... I SWEAR!

there was an old shoe who lived in a shoe
she gave birth to a mogel who had a "m0g" 'too
she said to herself, "his name should be longer."
so she made his name longer.

a bird flew along
soaring, gliding, free, and 
crashed into a telephone wire
above mogel_'s head.

so the shoe set off on a crazy-ass quest
to find her son a job and a decongest-
ant.  he was allergic to feathers
or something.

she wandered on into the forest
a search to no avail
she stepped on a snail,
and got slime on her soul, but wait,
i mean her sole
because shoes don't have souls, silly willy.

so when she died, she went to hell.

but her dear son
-- her dear, dear son --
lived on
ramen and vegetables
and he grieved for her sole
and at the funeral he was very
sad
and he threw a drive-thru funeral-party
and 
did not serve sole
did not play to soul music
did not pursue a solo career and
did not invite hans solo.

in fact,
he decided,
the only people whom i shall let in
are those who can say my name.

i bid three tries each, he thought,
failure will result in torture,
a torture beyond imagination;
even beyond the imagination of
the most imaginative 
wanker 
on earth.

so he sat at the drive-thru funeral-party window
and sat
and something
and no one showed up.

then timidly, a girl wandered up, holding a roll of rolo.
"talk to the hand," mogel said, "for you are holding a roll of rolo!"
and she began to cry, which resulted in 
her eyes melting,
her cheeks melting, 
her nose melting,
but before
her lips melted,
she screamed, "YOUR NAME IS MOGELSTILTSKIN!!!@!!"

and she was correct, yes indeed!
yes indeed.
and so, mogelstiltskin let her into the party
and something else happened but i forget,

but alas, it was too late, 
for she had melted away.

and so,
the funeral-party was
a celebration of irony, 
a "celebration" of her death.

and so, mogelstiltskin lived on
ramen and vegetables
-- forever --
ramen and vegetables
who chant to him, 
"happy birthday m0ggie!"

               Mogels birthday issue... phear!@#$

           Mogel: "I think I should explain what happened back there.. you see
           nybar (who wrote it) didn't even know what the hell he was talking
           about. He was just rambling on and on. I don't think pip is bald.
           I'm not even dead. Actually.. I could be dead right now and this
           could still be written. Cause I (mogel) am not writing it. Nybar is.
           It's kind of sick that way. Actually, this is the third time he's
           destroyed me in his `zine. One noteable time.. he destroyed the whole
           `zining community and he then destroyed the universe after they had
           been ressurected as androids. Then there was this other one called
           mog.txt where he killed me in every conceiveable way.. but I only
           died once. That one will probably be later on in this issue. And then,
           a HOTDOG drove him insane. Damn... how did they get all those fish up
           there?!@$ BY DUES *so as not to be vulgar* IT'S FULL OF STARS!!! Hehe..
           thats how you can tell if it's me or him pretending to be me. Maybe I'm
           Mogel right now just faking it actually... I am just pathetic enough to
           fake being nybar faking me to get into a `zine which was designed as a
           happy bday thinkie anyway. I'm that desperate. Cerkit cerkit.. you are
           not a blerkit, draw on my dick. Fuck this is just filler... ahh.. next
           story.

 Nybar: "DESTROYYYYYYYYYYYY!@$ I mean suprise.#@!$*(!@$+#)!*@$+)!*$*!+@)$*"

             have some cake?!"
     Mogel: "Ahh.. sure, I guess so."
 FBI Guy 2: "I don't like chocolate.... do you have some vanilla cake?"
     Mogel: "Nope.. Sorry."

	<later.. the party commences.>

 Nybar: "Hey mogel... I got you a present@!!!!"
 Mogel: "Present?! NYBAR.. I LOVE YOU!"
 Nybar: "Here.. open it." <mogel opens it>
 Mogel "'Women Who Love Too Much'."
 <mogel looks at nybar with an uncomprehending expression>
 Mogel: "Ohhh.. I get it. Thats reaaalll funny."
 Nybar: "Tee-hee."

       <even later..... Handle and mercuri defy a whole bunch of spatial
        laws by sitting in a bar (in kia.. kai's dorm.>

 Mercuri: "So.. hozabout them bears?"
  Handle: "Gee.. I dunno."

 <at the same time.. nybar and jamesy converse>

  Nybar: "So... do you believe in god?"
 Jamesy: "Do you?"
  Nybar: "Oh.. you were predetermined to say that."

 <still later.... jubjub talks to FBI guy 2>

    Jubjub: "Y'know.. I hacked into NASA with AOL once."
 FBI Guy 2: "Really?"
    Jubjub: "Yup."
 FBI GUY 2: "Hehe... you couldn't hack your way into yer own pants."
    Jubjub: "Hey.. you jerk!@$!@$#"

 <FBI Guy 2 produces smg>

 Jubjub: "FUCK YOU MAN!@$#!$#!@$# RULE YAKUZA!@$!@$ *as a parody of the
          britania thang*

 <jubjub brings out a mini howitzer cannon with laser sighting and sound
  suppressor.. which is laughable because it's practically a rocket
  launcher. Also.. a bunch of Yakuza guys jump out of nowhere>

 FBI Guy 2: "OTHER FBI GUYS.. TO MY AID~@!!@$!@$ REMEMBER THE
             WATERGATE!@$!$!"

 ......

 Mogel: "And then I fell into another dimension, strange and eerie beyond

 Mogel: "Yeah... and there was... CHAFING@#$!!#$!@$"

              something jumped up and bit me. Hehe, gump. Wotta retard I am.

                       Nybar "Nope, I got nothing ta prove. Get em boys."

                <nybar's revolutionaries lay hands on mogel>

              "Please" begged mogel "Let me go, for I am such a little foe!"
              "No" said nybar "Not at all, for I am big and you are small."

                         ----------

               Nybar: "Hmm.. THROW EM IN THE SHORTIE PITS@#!@$# No wait
                      thats lame, ...ahh.. fuck just kill him in some
                      imaginative way."

               <soon.. mogel ramensoup dangles above a pool of boiling ramen as
                Nybar's followers lash him with hot, wet ramen noodles.>


              Mogel "Wheee.. going unconcious from pain."

        <mogel falls and is horribly boiled alive, just as nybar
                 overthrows the government.. woowoo!!>

           And thus ends the brave tail of Mogel Ramensoup.

                     Make no mistake.. Mogel is a shortie. But this time..
                     instead of peppering the short jokes throughout the
                     issue.. I have decided to put all of them at one time
                     at the end!! So here we go.. first a short story then
                     some haiku's and jokes.

                 ------------

               Mogel and his Father......

     <mogel sits at his fathers house.... drinking a sip of bourbon on the
      rocks with mint. his father and him are having a man to man talk>

       Mogel's Father: "Oh mogel.. today you are a grownup! 21 years of age..
                        you be! I remember when it alllllll began... with
                        your mother in Madison County. I was a
                        photographer, taking picures of bridges.. and I-----"
       Mogel: "I think that you a thinking of a movie based on my favorite
               book.. the Briges of Madison County."
       Mogel's Father: "Oh yeah. Now I remember... your mother was a cheap
                        street hooker, and you are my Bastard son. And now
                        you have thrown away your life by becoming a
                        fucking nobody hacker jerk!#@$!@$# Still..
                        <sniff> I was always proud.. you weren't a short man."
       Mogel: "Actually dad.. I've been meaning to tell you about that..."

   <mogel removes platform shoes and lifts... and around 500 pairs of socks>

       Mogel's Dad: "Well.. son. You are still around six feet tall."
       Mogel: "Actually..."

       <mogel removes huge top hat and affro that it was on>

       Mogel's Dad: "At least you are still 5'5..."
             Mogel: "I didn't want to admit it.. but.."

    <mogel takes removes stilts that were under his hugely sized baggy pants>

   Mogel's Dad: "Ok.. beginning to be embarrased... you are 3 foot tall
                 now..."
         Mogel: "About that three feet tall thing..."

   <mogel snips a string that was holding him in the air, and takes off
    oversizes pants revealing shorts>

               Mogel's Dad: "Where are you?!!#@%"
      M(for miniscule)ogel: "Down here!! Get a microscope."

      <as mogel's father searches for a microscope.. he steps on Mogel..
       going with the trend of him getting killed every story.>
