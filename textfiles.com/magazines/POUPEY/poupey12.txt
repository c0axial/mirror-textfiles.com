               Why? Why? Why the hell? -Nybar

         Yeah.. thats right.. Why the hell?!@#$ What the HELL happened to
my sock!! I can't find it!! Where the hell is my sock. If I found my
sock.. it would be just ducky. Ducky.. yeah.. ducky. Let me tell you
youngins a lil story `bout ducks. It starts in da `nam. Thems was brave
boys. Misled boys. They came in for the glory.. but in the end.. it was
for one thing. Group masturbation. And the only ones who knew.. other then
the soldiers.. were the ducks. The ducks knew all. And in this knowledge..
they had power. Power to stop the useless war. And here is a log type
thing of what they DID instead of stopping the war:
  
(real names will not be used... for the ducks safety)

ham - jubjub

O, ham, how succulent art thou,
Made from the pig, neighbor of the cow,
I love you ham, and your glaze,
Your tender meat sends me into a daze,
I cook you in my oven, bathed in heat,
Your charred flesh I would love to eat,
This poem, I now must end,
I am off to eat you, my friend.

	"smash smash smash," says hulk.

	he didn't fight with the cat.  no, not ONCE.  not TWICE. 

	"i've got a butt!  & it smells like a butt!" he elated in a
gratuitous jubilation upon dancing towards the corner diner with only a
small serving of liverworst & a box of cap'n crunch.

	he sat down & he said "gimme the dumplings," & fondled his bald
head.  hulk didn't hear the trains flopping in the wind until her ate a
poop & didn't like it even a little bit not like a very small about - even
less.  like, less than the intricately small microscopic intermitten
moments where an entire sentiant thought enters #zines - even less.  it's
less than the generousity of the republicans.  even less.

	this amount of bigness is so unbig that it doesn't SHUT UP SHIT
UPS HUPS THUISTSUTSPTUSTHUSTHSUTSPTSTUSTUSPTt

	& then some.  "smash," be blubbered & gargled some patatoE soup.

	the waitress said "check please!" & proceeded to stab the hulk,
but he wasn't dead.  he was a freak.

	hulk sucks.

                  Here is a little dream I had.. - by Nybar

     Me and Waylan Smithers (of the simpsons) were trying to solve a murder
    mystery. The person who had been murdered was King Richard (The
     Lionhearted). It seemed to Smithers that the most logical one to
   interview first was the queen. So we did. (The queen looked like
     how she did when she shown on kids in the hall.)

    Smithers "Do you have any information concerning the king of england,
                 Richard The Lionhearted's.. murder?"
    Queenie "Are you implying I, could have killed him?"
         Me "No.. we ARE looking  for possible suspects though."
    Queenie "Possibly the kings bastard son. If he killed the king before
              his legit son could mature, he would have a chance to rule
             all of england."
   Smithers "We appreciate your help"

      -----
      So we decided to interview the former kings bastard son. (The bastard
     son looks like homer simpson from the simpsons.. but he is dressed like
    a prince.)
    -------

         Me "Homer?"
      Homer "AHH!!"
         Me "Do you have anything to do with the murder of your father?"
      Homer "I would never kill my daddy!"
         Me "I belive your innocent!!"
      Homer "Woohoo!"
   Smithers "Oh come on man! You have guilt painted all over you! You have
               the perfect motive!! Everything fits! You killed your father
             to keep the rightful king of england out of the throne!!!"
      Homer "D'ohh!
         Me "Homer.. do you know anyone that might have wanted your father
               `out of the way'?"
      Homer "Out of the way?"
         Me "Dead!!"
      Homer "The legit son was one NASTY LIL' kid!! I tried ta stop him! But
               no!! He was crazzzzzzz-eeee!!  CRAZY ZANY KOOKEE!"
   Smithers "Lets RIDEEEE!"

    -------
    Now.. the legit son looked much like milhouse from simpsons. Also of
    import was he was in a car.. next to a wall.
   --------------

        Me "Did you.. murder your father?"
  Milhouse "Me?! I was way to afraid of my father to MURDER him!!!"
  Smithers "I had heard you were fearless.."
  Milhouse "Well there was one thing I really feared...."
        Me "What was that?"
  Milhouse "The car olympics!"
  <smithers and I turn around>
        Me "The car olympics?"

         VROOM!
   <me and smithers turn around>

  <I spy a big hole in the wall.. the shape and size of milhouses car>
   Me "Oh well.."

  -----
  Having exhausted many likely suspects.. we decided to gather all probable
   or improbable potential suspects. In a sort of.. Agatha Kristy/murder she
   wrote.. on acid way. Yeah.Yeah.Everything from a crocodile to a.. green
  eye type thing was there. We were on a sandy terrain with two walls
   opposite eachother there.. (the suspects were lined up against the walls)
  Just as me and smithers were going to question the suspects....
  ------

 Smithers "I think I know who the culprit is!!"
  <then zorak from space ghost coast to coast arose from the ground>
 Zorak "Yes!! I, ZORAK, did it!! And I'd do it again!! MUAAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!"

                 And then I woke up

 "the enigma surrounding 'nybar'"
 waxed & booby trapped by - mercuri

 the room.  a small psychiatrists office, it looks like a nice, well
 furbished den.  on a couch is a fat, balding man.  he is wearing blue sweat
 pants and hard rock cafe t-shirt.  it looked as if he had wiped potato-chip
 grease on his t-shirt before he came.

 the man interviewing this fat, balding man in sweatpants was a psychiatrist.

 the psychiatrist peered over nybar's -- the fat balding man -- portfolio.

 shrink: "hey nybar?"
  nybar: "yeeaah what?"
 shrink: "chicken butt."
  nybar: "yeeaah what?"
 shrink: "chicken butt."
  nybar: "can we please get moving with this doc, i'm paying for this time."
 shrink: "i suppose."  nybar: "okay, good."
 shrink: "tell me what your childhood was like..."
  nybar: "i can some it up in one word: poupey."
 shrink: "what do you mean?  your childhood was bad?"
  nybar: "let me explain myself, doc... but first, do you have any irish
          cream coffee?"

 the answer was yes, and nybar downed the first cup of irish cream.  it burnt
 his throat because it was so hot, and he let the doctor now about it.

 shrink: "continue."
  nybar: "well, doc.  my childhood was going well for the first ten or so
          years, then something odd happened."
 shrink: "what was that?"
  nybar: "i began having strange dreams, about handle's little sister.  but
         in these dreams i was napoleon, and she was my mistress."
 shrink: "ooh, continue."
  nybar: "well, you see.  nybar comes from the latin word "nybarius," which
         means to conquer."
 shrink: "no it doesn't."  
  nybar: "what?"
 shrink: "that's not latin.  that's russian."
  nybar: "what?!  no wonder the kremlin wouldn't leave me alone..."
 shrink: "the kremlin?  in moscow?"
  nybar: "NO.  THE KREMLIN IN IDAHO.  I'M PAYING YOU MONEY FOR THIS?"
 shrink: "yep."
  nybar: "that was a rhetorical question."
 shrink: "my bad."
  nybar: "AS I WAS SAYING... one day i was walkind down the street and i
         started sing DOO-WAH-DIDDIE-DOO-DOO TALK ABOUT THE GIRL FROM SALT
         LAKE CITY - YEAH!"
 shrink: "what?  we were talking about the kremlin!"
  nybar: "and then this bird went on pooped on my brother's HEAD!!! would you
         write for poupey?"
 shrink: "isn't that pronounced POO-PAY?"
  nybar: "and then we started eating a pizza and a squirrel approached me and
         he said he says he said... DO YOU WANT MY FUR!!!  and i said 
yeah &
         he said, WELL HA HA YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BECAUSE IT'S _MY_ FUR!!
 shrink: "..."
  nybar: "so i chased the little rascal, and when i found him i skinned him
         alive and ate all his acorns.  i was looking to see if he stored
         his acorns in tupperware like the squirrel in the commercial did.
         that must be a smart squirrel, ya know?"
 shrink: "excuse me?"
  nybar: "SMART AS IN I.Q. -- SMART AS IN STUPID IS AS STUPID DOES!!"
 shrink: "i see what you're saying.. you're saying that if someone wrote for
         poupey.... you'd be surprised?"
  nybar: "BINGO!!! and BINGO WAS HIS NAME-O... B-I-N-G-O and BINGO was his
         NAME-O."
