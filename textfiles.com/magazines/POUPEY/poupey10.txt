    ---------------FETAL PIG RAGE: CONCLUSION!---------------------------

           I really can't die in a t-file. Isn't that cool?
          BLAM! I'm dead. Next story.. I'm alive. Hell.. I've destroyed
            the universe.. 4... 5 times. Don't worry.. it's fine.
           Really.. I can do anything in a text file. Watch
           : And then I took over the world.. ate a cheesburgar.. got all the
            chicks.. and took a piss"
           Pretty kool huh?
          If you want to be able to do crap like that.. umm.. write for
           poupey. Yeah. Actually.. no matter what.. write for poupey.
           Your just not writing cause your jealous. Do you know how
            much something like this taxes my creative talents? Those
             Pigs were a bunch of dorks! Dorks they were! Dorks!
            I'm not that big a dork. No way man. Like remember that thingie
             when the `hacker' went on AOL?! Yeah.. very taxing of my
              creative talents. Think I'll end this now.

            ========Damn FUCKING yuppies #2=======

         Yeah.. we know how to throw a barbicue. Yeah.
          We just.. threw some cheap crap on the grill.. had people whack
        A pinyahta whatever filled with gunpowder with a flaming torch.
         Yeah.. that party ruled. And then, it was time for fireworks!
          So we got some big ol explosives.. and then.. before lighting them
         said "Gotta get those matches.." and went off and lit the fuse.
          And then everyone blew up... cept us cause we were just sittin
           around twiddlin our thumbs goin "Doddlleee oop doop dooo"
          at the time. And it was pretty damn funny. And then.. we started
         eating the crap they brought for us. Brownines which I pretended
          were poop.. and it was funny. Then snakeface and froboy drunk
           all the beer and passed out.. and joltcola.. well who knows what
             he's doing. Farmer zed was inspecting the medicine cabnits.
              Then.. I discovered some rice crispy squares! ELETE! Ever
               heard the joke.. what did the rice crispies say to the asshole?
              `Snap crackle fuck you you lamer!' Isn't that a brilliant joke?
              But then I drank a whole bowl of punch someone had put alot of
               brandy in and I don't remember anything else. Oh yeah jC
                tells me that he found some elete ducks out back!!
               Yeah! One of my best parties ever!

  ==========What.. you lookin at me? No one else here! Fuck you yuppie!=#3====

           So anyway we only got like 200 people at that party. Not enough
          man. Not enough yuppies dead. To many yuppies alive. But then
           Froboy was readin the paper.. or his fro was.. and he came upon
            something that was sellin tickets for the superbowl! Yeah!
           Thousands of yuppies there!! And some free bonus rednecks to!!#@$
            And it even said the prez was gonna be there! Elete! Kill the
             prez.. the yupsters, and the yellow bellied cow tippers! Yeah!
            So anyway.. froboy got the high explosives... zed got the
              electric conductors and some sparking wires, snakeface got the
        tape recorders and the sterio system.. mojo got the land mines and
    I got around 6 bottles of wine for afterwards. Yeah.. we were ready dood.
             But then I Watched the movie bambi and I was so sad that we
            almost didn't do it. But in the end.. we still did.
               And it was really cool. God I wish I got it on tape.
              Waitasec.. I don't believe in god! Ok.. potato I wish I had
               got it on tape. Hey.. potatoes are just easier to believe in..
              you know? So anyway we broke into the stadium a day before
               the super bowl and set this crap up.

  ----------$$$$$$$$$$$$#4 (Where alot of yuppies die!)

               So anyway.. we planted the land mines in the playing field so
          some players started blowing up. It was pretty damn funny. And then
         we hit the prez with a lightning bolt and he sparked to death. That
      was really really really funny. Then the tape recorders we got played
            things (over the sterio system) like "Without the president the
         econemy will collapse?!!?" and "Those land mines were planted by
        the reds to start WW3?!" and my faviorate "That lightning bolt that
         hit the president was from space invaders from the moon who are
          going to destroy the earth! It's doomsday! DOOMMSSSSSDAYYY!"
           And that set everyone into a panic. And then the high explosives
            detonated and everyone blew up. Wheeeww did they blow up.
           Dead pieces of guys flying everywhere. Owch! So I guess your
            wondering why didn't we just blow em up in the first place?
             Well.. aside from my flair for the dramatic.. I really just
            wanted to watch em all run around. And I wanted to kill the
             prezident seperately. And those players on the playing field..
              well have you ever seen a bunch of guys trying to play
               football on a mine field? Pretty damn funny man. Yeah.. I
            killed these guys seperately for my amusement. And cause we
             wanted to test out our new sterio system.. that got blown
              to smithereens. Ka-BAM! heehee.. funnyfunnyfunny.

     -------------------Wrap up thinge.. many yuppies dead--------------

          J0ltCola went on to.. well.. drink alot of joltcola. Froboy
           went on to conquer 3 continents.. leading armies with his
          mighty fro. Farmer Zed went on to re-invent the idea of mulching.
           Snakeface, later in life.. killed alot of people by biting them..
            and then ate them in one gulp. Yum. Yipyip went on to be a really
           annoying poodle who wouldn't shut up.. oh and he battled weiner
            dogs.. in a far off galaxy. Mewmew went on to be a commander in
             one of my cat-duck-cow armies. And I went on to thinking how
              lame the things where you just told the jist of the future
             of all of the main charecters in a story or movie.. when you
              could have just made a sequal or something that.. no matter
               how bad... lots of people would see just cause the first one
              was elete. Yeah.. so I guess I'm just a jerk for doing something
             like this. Yeah.

             `A Cosmic POTATO?!! Are you MAD?!'  -Plato Addressing Nybar

      %%^^^^^^
      |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

       Uhh.. well of course Nybars da elete god and all.. but there were some
        doods before him that sucked. Yeah. Well.. lets start at the
         beginning of the universe. Uhh.. there was a lil "Pop!" and the
        universe was created. And for a brief period of time.. everything
         was good and kosher dill pickle. But then the universe got really
          bored and decided to have a potato. So it ate the potato and the
         potato was good. And now the potato was in the center of the universe
          .. and it was using it's godly potato powers to hold off being
         digested. So it started creating a bunch of crap like flowers.. bees,
           and that stuff. And then he created the wombat. Ohh the wombat
            was a cool one all right. Give thanks to the potato for creating
           the elete wombat!!! Phear that wombat! Phear it! Phear the elete!
            So anyway one night.. when it was dreaming..
          it dreamed of a verryyy scary world where pixies.. fairies.. elves,
           and escimos reigned. And then it accidentaly dreamed of nybar
            (not me.. the god!) and accidentaly created him. And Nybar was
           elete. And he made all the elete stuff other than the wombat.
              So anyway.. just remembered something.. I explained doomsday
             for earth.. but not for the universe. Well.. when the potatoes
            godly powers fail and it gets digested.. the universe will get
             a bad case of indigestion and croak. Isn't that a terrible way
              to die?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

                     `Republicans seem so innocent...'

             Yeah.. some people asked me "Why republicans?! They seem so
            Innocent!!!" Yeah well anyway I decided to answer in this `zine
           instead of just telling them so they would be really confused.
            Anyway.. I don't like republicans cause they offer young
             american d00ds quick fix crap.. like a drugg (nothing against
              drugs). But then.. once yer hooked.. they reel you in.. and
             before you know it.. your wearin bland suits carrying a
              briefcase attending PTA meetings. Thats gets scareier and
             scareier the more you think about it. And they are just a bunch
              of uptight jerks. Say.. I wanted to go on the beach and take
               my pet lobsters for a walk. But nooooo. What do they do?
              Why.. they try and take my lobsters! Damn lobster grabbers!
               And.. you know.. some `democrats' are just vehicles for
                republican rule. Bill Clinton is the a good example. See
                 How he chooses the most mind crushing things likely to
                make you so opressed you do something like register
                republican.. thinking that that `freedom' would be just as
                 good. Web decency act.. dress code crap. What the hell is
                   your problem? Why do you even ask me `Why republicans?'
                 ?!! Ever notice how they attack fictional `zines and
                cartoons and crap instead of confronting real issues?!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                     "Puffin.. forget prose.. preferably"

               Anyway one day I was walking down main street.. and I came
              to a restraunt called `The east end main cafe' and it had
              a sign on the door that said "No puffin' allowed!" and it
             had a picture of a puffin with a top hat and a cane smoking
              a cigar. You can see the great injustice in this! So.. I
               told froboy about it and he knew that we had to take action!
              So he got a puffin and I got a big trench coat to smuggle it
               in in... and we took it in. And then when we were ordering
              I said to the waitress "Yes.. I'd like.. uhh.. 2 hamburgars
                for me and this fro.. and a chicken special for my invisible
                 friend here" And I pointed to the empty seat next to me.
                But sadly this waitress had heard that one before.. and
                 she said "I've heard that one before!" and then she searched
                me and found the puffin. She took it out and was about to tell
                  the big ass cook named `Big Bertha' who just might whack me
                 with a frying pan. But then I offered her a fat bribe.. and
                  she accepted. Anyway.. the puffin loved to food.. and..
                   it was ok to us.. but we had been there before. There
                  really isn't any point to this story. We just liked
                   smuggling rare birds into forbidden resteraunts.. thats
                    all.

        Nybar "Are you SURE people will be submitting?!"
           jC "Hey.. no one wrote for y0lk till like issue #10 either"
        Nybar "The last thing I need right now is you comparing us to y0lk"
           jC "Oh sorry"
        Nybar "So then at ish #99 we'd have a special classic thing where
                we put the best poupey's ever in."
           jC "Yeah.. and at #100 we'd have... ONE THOUSAND STORIES!!"
        Nybar "No I don't think so"
           jC "Why not?"
        Nybar "Every story is a page.. every page is a story.. ONE THOUSAND
                FUCKING PAGES!! WHOS GONNA READ IT!"
           jC "Ok.. we'll just do 250 and the rest will just be alot of

       ..in nybars inner sanctum
    Poe "You see.. what we would do.. would be to send a man to the inside..
          to distract them. Then.. while they were fighting.. we would cut
         the lights. Since they are all scared of the dark.. we could then
           send mewmew.. who has excellent night vision.. to BREAK THEIR
            FINGERNAILS!"
    Froboy "And then we could just announce we would turn the lights back
             on a lead em to a good manacure if they surrendered and started
            playing by the rules again"
        jC "Thats BEAUTIFUL!"

      mewmew "I don't know how long this confusion can last"
      <mewmew runs into the conference room.. where all were battling yipyip>

      Yipyip "Just shut the fuck up and get you to a hospital!"
      Nybar "Yeah.. on your sheet it will say `Got beat up by a buncha girls'
               and the doctor will sigh and say `not another one'"

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

                       Partytime!

          So anyway I got a perfectly normal looking invite to a party.
           Perfectly normal looking. So I decided `What the hell..
            the invatation said to bring a friend.. so I'll bring jC"
            . Around a week later.. we arrived at the party. And then
           we looked around. It was a yuppie party alright. Me and jC
          were trapped in the middle of a yuppie party. It was gonna be
           tough. To paraphrase the immortal immortal dude.. "I live
            forever cause I'm immortal dude." Brilliant. Maybe I should
          mention that at that party.. I had a brilliant idea. A bunch
           of people were writing on the driveway with some chawk.. so
            I grabbed it and in really huge elete letters wrote
             "Write for POUPEY!" and I underlined poupey. That should
                        -------
              boost circulation 100%!! So anyway.. they had this elete
               pinhyatta.. and they were letting the little kids go first..
              and with no blindfolds.. so to get back at them.. I hit all
               of the people standing around a gawking and then pretended
                I didn't mean to. It was really funny.
               Then they were all have fireworks.. but we had already stolen
                them all.. so they said `Where are they?' and we launched
                 them at the yuppies. And then we ran home.
       ------------------------------------------------------------------

                            An exclusive with olive oil

       Nybar "So.. to begin.. what do you think of popeye? A real dork isn't
                he?"
       Olive-oil "He's my man!"
       Nybar "So how many times have you dumped him in favor of some trussed
               up bluto just to go crawlin back?"
       Olive "Oh.. around 250 I'd say"
       Nybar "So what about that whole sweet-pee think.. who's was he?"
       Olive "Mine and popeyes"
       Nybar "Oh.. ok.. been sexin it up eh? Does he take his spinach before
                sex?"
       Olive "Before the sex that made sweet pee.. yeah"
       Nybar "Can you see the problems for sweet pee later in life having
                a name with the word `pee' in it?"
       Olive "I guess I really hadn't thought of that.."
       Nybar "So why do you always seem to abandon popeye.. even when you
                2 had those 3 kids.."
       Olive "I guess I'm just a ramblin gal"
       Nybar "Yeah whatever. So if you can get herculian strength by having
                some spinach.. why isn't everyone doing it?"
       Olive "Umm.. cause it isn't illeagel?"
       Nybar "Or maybe it just tastes bad. Specially cold.. out of a can.."
       Olive "I almost didn't have that first date with popeye cause  he had
                spinach between his teeth"
       Nybar "Elete.. but out time is up. Bye"
       Olive "Umm.. bye"

                    Why this issue of poupey is elete
                    ---------------------------------

    Cause it just is. Just kidding.

     ...

    Cause this is 50 fucking stories in one issue man. And it isn't even
    a big deal issue either. It's #10. And I'm writing it all by myself.
    Ever tried to write 50 stories like this all by yourself?! It ain't easy.
    I hate those d00ds who say "Ain't isn't a word cause it AIN'T in the
    dictionary" it's in the dictionary all right. I mean.. shit isn't in
    the pussy whipped off dictionarys their reffering to. Crap man.. what
     the hell is their problem?! Stop bothering me! Why the hell do I do
       this? I just sit up all night writing poupey stories for about 5
        people who read half of it and don't get any of the jokes.. or get
         them for the wrong reasons. Maybe cause I'm elete.. like the wombat.
          Phear me. I'm da `zine machine. 50 stories.. one night.. something
           new to phear in this phearful world. And I wrote poupey10 BEFORE
            we put together poupey 09. Phear that.

             `Well OO' La De DAH Mr. Frenchman' - by Nybar
             ---------------------------------------------

     It's not pronounced like a frenchy. Poupey that is. Not like poupe.
      Like poopy. We just couldn't think of an acronym for two o's.
      RAD=Rat Ass Deadbeat, DTO= Dainty Tulip Organization.. and poupey=
       Poop old ugly poumpous electronic yams. None of them really MEAN
      anything.. and I just asked someone randomly on the street what the
       other acronyms were. Actually.. Poor old ugly poumpous electronic
        yams doesn't MEAN anything. It just sounds nifty. Rollsss off the
         tounge. There have been so many of these stories.. at least one
          of them must have been a classic. So now the night is just ending.
         And here I am. Still writing poupey stories. Poupey: The crazy
          playground of my mind. You see.. first it was so stupid/bad it
           was funny.. now it's so funny it's funny. Or so they tell me.
          I don't really see the difference. Except I think howard the
           magical chipmunk is one of the most elite stories ever. Really
          elite. Pretty much what I'm trying to do is uhh.. well get alot
           of mini-serises in this.. and just some random stuff in between.
           Potato.. that olive oil thing was brilliant. Really brilliant.
          You know.. if you stick, a nail.. in a potato.. it will cook
           in half the time. elite.
 
         ------------------------------------------------------------

                    `CRAP! I STUBBED MY elite TOE!' -Nybar

           Well maybe this should have a different title. Cause you really
          can't base a story on stubbing your toe. Actually.. you can and
         now that I mention it think I will try it in the future. It will
          be elite. Anyway.. this is about an average day in my life.

           1:00 woke up.. went to bathroom.. wrote for poupey
           2:30 finished writing for poupey.. go on IRC
           2:45 Get banned from all the gay channels.. wrote for poupey
           3:00 Finish story.. go to froboys house
           3:15 Me and froboy drive around in his elite car
           3:30 Really annoy waitresses with froboy at gold hawk road cafe
           4:00 Went to bathroom
           5:00 Was reading a magazine.. but will pretend was constapated
           5:20 Stubbed my elite toe. Just sat around.
           6:00 Wrote for poupey
           6:30 Watched simpsons
           7:00 Drunk alot of coffee.. decided to stay up all night writing.
           3:00 Took a bathroom break
           5:00 Took another bathroom break
           7:00 People wondering why I seem more out of it than usual.
           8:00 At this point.. I was one of these people

   -------------------------------------------------------------------

                   Brilliant observations galore.

      Think of what bugs bunnies day must be like.. :
       Find whoever comes into the forest and make their life hell.
      If no one comes get your friend daffy blown to bits.
      Make sure not to run out of carrats. If elmer fudd or porkey
      pig in elmer fudd garb comes along.. make sure to BLAST EM!
       ...
      This is no way to live.. for a hunter or for a rabbit. And then they
       made they crappy spinoffs where.. they all had kids and moved to vegas!
      butchers. Wish I could have a life like bugs bunnies.. so I could
       harrass a bunch of phreaks and.. harrass them. A word to the
        hamsters: BROWN FUR IS HELL! SHAVEN SPLENDOR IS DIVINITY! OPRESSION
         BY THE FUZZZZZ.. OR FREDEEOM OF A BUZZ?
         ...
         So I try and make poupey a gooooddd like jumbo kosher pickle.. and
          believe me.. I HAVE tried.. with alll the culture I have at my
           disposal. Not much. So it comes out like this.. a peice of poop..
            you say? Hey.. it's a way to write a bunch of stories for no
             reason.
      --------------------------------------------------------------------
                      My worst day ever -Nybar
                 000000000000000000000000000000000000
                   
                 First I awoke at 7:00. Bad headache. And I thought to myself:
                  OHHHHHH BOYYYYYYY Am IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII GRUMPPPYY!!
                   GRUMPPPPPPPPPYYYYYYY     MOOOONNNKKKKKEEYYYYY!!!!

                 So I got outta bed.. went and choked down some cerial..
                  which tasted more shitty then ever. Then I walked up to
                 my room and wrote for poupey.. But no AC in that room so
                  I went to jc's... and he kicked me out. And then I fell out
                 a window. Low second story.. into a street where someone was
               shavin his head. Now I have a mini bald spot to testify the
                momentous moment. Then I walked into the barber shop across
               the street to see what they could do with my har.. but for
                some reason they seemed to think I was `Poisioning there
                 country' which I thought was just bullshit. Then I had
                  a sub for lunch and I think it was the mayo made me vomit
                   this time. After that.. I read some books.. and wrote for
                  poupey. And then we went to the golden hawk road cafe for
                   dinner.. which I always love to do cause we have poupey
                  -worthy discussions. But they were closed. Renovation or
                   something.

                          Doesn't that suck?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                     Some elite movie reviews

             Independance day was.. ok. Meaning it wasn't baddddddddd.
            I think they should have been so predicabile.. letting us win.
              It's not very damn likely we would win anyway. Twister had
             another weak plot.. something about a guy who leaves his wife
              to go chase twisters with someone whose father got sucked up
             by one awhile ago. A time to kill.. you can tell the plot by
           watching the commercials. Special cameo by the klu-klux clan.
            The rock was neatO. Some 60 year old beating up a bunch of modern
           well trained marines. Those dorks. Also.. they almoooosttt blew a
            football stadium up. Almost. Damn I forget. What the hell else
           was there. Umm.. trainspotting? One of the best movies of the
            (lame) summer. Real realistic. Uhh.. drugs. Lotsa them. Drugs
             drugsdrugsdrugsdrugsdrugsdrugsdrugsdrugsdrugsdrugsdrugsdrugs.
             Oh and there was sex.. underage, aids.. contracted from cat
            shit.. and a bunch of other totally cool crap. Umm.. I saw other
           movies.. but they were totally lame. So instead.. I'll tell some
            TV stuff. Uhh.. I saw the net.. and the main charecter
           was a fucking retard: In the middle of a crowded mall.. 2 people
            with guns after her.. her work on the computer done. So what does
             she do.. SHE RUNS TO THE FUCKING SECLUDED CATWALKS!! RETARD!
              I saw a movie called the million dollar duck. elite! Watch this
               crap!! I also saw a movie that had a cat much like orangey in
              it called `Rhubarb' eliteeliteelite! About a cat who leads a
             baseball team.. but then the mafia kidnaps him.. but he escapes
              cause he's an elite 0-day cat.

         jC "Why do you say `elete' so much?"
      Nybar "Cause everything in my life is"
         jC "You're just saying that so the first time readers who don't know
                much about you will think it's true"
      Nybar "No.. I just say it for ego-satisfaction"
         jC "Whats that?"
      Nybar "I dunno"
     Froboy "Nice string of rhymes in that slogan"

                     Why ducks.. cats and cows?!

            Couldn't think of an acrynom for two o's. So there. Anyway..
             this issue is convienant to clear alot of stuff in. So.. some
            people ask me `How did you come up with the name.. nybar'
             well the answer is I dunno.. it just sounded good. Anyywayy..
              other people ask why I worship cats.. ducks and cows. Well..
            quacks are (FUNKY) elete. They waddle and eat bread and go
           QUACKKKKKKKKK! If you are ever my neighbor.. you may see me
            throwing a loaf of bread out the window at night. Feeding the
           ducks. Cats are just alot like me. What can I say.. I'm elete..
            they're elete.. I take short naps during the day instead of
           sleeping.. they do that to.. when I drink.. I like to lick it up
          real fast. And all that doody crap. Cows.. well they say moooooooo
          ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
          ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.
           And thats a perfectly good reason. Theres also the thing that

         a bunch of purple, walking talking stick figures.. with squiggly
        purple (or for the funksters.. red) Hair.

     Stick "Hi nybar"
     Stick2 "In this world.. you rule the `zine scene!"
     Nybar "rad"
