                                1996: An URBAN Oddessy
                               -----------------------

                             Bad hangover and little sleep. To much coffee..

                    Not enough effect. My name is jubjub.. for those of you
                    who don't know. It's a normal day in my life; another
                    night in a cheap motel. As I was settling down to watch
                    some tv and listen to some music.. I was distracted by
                    a moaning sound.. and a clawing at the door. I opened the
                    door. It was my brother and then roomate nybar. He was
                    extremely beaten up. He looked like somethin outta the
                    toilet. I asked him what had happened.. and he uttered one
                    one singular; disturbing word: `Zinboobi'. I said `NO..
                    NOT Zinboobi!' right before he passed out. Let me explain
                    about that name. Now.. we used to be prize-wrestlers in
                    world wrestling federation. We were the best out there..
                    and we wanted to prove it. Those were the good days.
                    Anyway... about the name Zinboobi; The name Zinboobi
                    comes from a match we once had. At the end of the
                    wrestling season.. there is the finale; the champs fight
                    eachother. They were the other champ. We.. of course.. had
                    to strive feverously until we beat them. We worked out
                    for weeks.. often until we passed out. Whenever we talked
                    to them.. they seemed well-rested.. and confident. And
                    they never seemed to exercise. When the big match came..
                    Nybar went to say `let the best man win' in the nybar-way.
                    He came back disillusioned about wrestlings authenticity.
                    He told me he had found STERIODS in their warm-up room.
                    My hopes, dreams, and thoughts shattered around me. I would
                    never be the same. He thought we had to throw the match..
                    but I knew that if we threw the match.. we would be no
                    better then they were. We would be letting down millions
                    of fans. It would be like shoeless joe throwing the world
                    series. We had to fight. The fighting was fierce. I nearly
                    got KILLED. Good thing it was alternating. Nybar bravely
                    fought Eziekial Zinboobi while I rested. He managed to
                    win; because I had weakened him. Then.. I fought abraham
                    Zinboobi to a standstill. We had won. They swore revenge.
                    Only later did the manager tell me he had known about
                    the steriods... and if we told.. we wouldn't  live to
                    talk about it. That was the same day he got Me and nybar's
                    resignation from world-class federation wrestling. We used
                    to be rich, happy, and beloved. Now we were jobless;
                    joyless, and avoided. Still.. we fought clean. When nybar
                    came to.. he told me that while he was bringing the
                    groceries home.. he was jumped by both zinboobie's at the
                    same time. He didn't stand a chance. And he said they were
                    bigger and stronger then before. He also told me that they
                    were coming for us. He said they said something like
                    `NYBAR YOU BASTARD!  HERES A MESSAGE FOR THAT BROTHER
                    OF YOURS: THE BIG MAN DOESN'T LIKE RATS!' It was
                    tournament day all over again. I hadn't said anything
                    about it. But then I realised it. NYBAR! YOU COULDN'T
                    HAVE!!

                    Nybar "I'm sorry man. I couldn't stand it anymore. The
                    Constant guilt. The searing pain. The thought that scum
                    like that weren't kicked out. Searing my sould. Grinding
                    my bones. I haven't slept for the thought of it. I reported
                    it to my lawyer. He says we have a big case."

                    Me "I understand how you feel man. I've often thought of
                    telling about those scum myself. But I couldn't bear the
                    thought of what they might do to me and mine"

                    Nybar "The only way we are ever going to live this through
                    is together. The court date is the 21'st."

                    Me "THATS A WEEK FROM NOW!"

                    Nybar "I know. And no one *REALLY* seems to believe me.
                    Witness protection is refused. Today is going to be ...
                    difficult."

                    Me  "Today IS going to be difficult. You look bad. Sleep"

                    ....

                    Thats one of the good things about nybar.. no need to tell.
                    him twice. He was sleeping like a baby by the time his
                    head hit the pillow. If I had a pillow. But it was time
                    I started following my own advice. I hadn't slept for a
                    long time to. It was a big burder off my shouders that
                    nybar had told them. I could now sleep in peace. Now..
                    another burden. Keeping alive until the trial. Out of the
                    frying pan and into the fire.. thats me. No need for
                    serious thought now. Only need for sleep.

                    .....

                    I slept a long.. dreamless night. I woke up feeling semi
                    refreashed. Right when I woke up.. something hit me. It
                    was a smell. It smelled like pancakes and sausage. Nybar
                    was cooking breakfast. No need to get jumpy. I decided to
                    walk into the kitchen and get my fair share. I was half
                    asleep.. so it didn't really hit me until I went into the
                    kitchen. The place was wrecked. There had obviously been
                    a huge struggle. Nybar was no where to be found.. and
                    belive me.. I looked. On the door of the apartment was a
                    note. It said that if I ever wanted to see my brother
                    again.. I had to go to a particular house that was just
                    around the block. If I brought help, nybar's life was
                    forfeit. If I didn't come.. nybar was as good as dead.
                    It was a no win situation. I wish nybar were here... but
                    he was still busy being kidnapped. Those BASTARDS!!!
                    They wrecked my apartment. They broke into my abode. They
                    kidnapped my brother. I dropped to my knees, and yelled..
                    in a star trek-like way

                    "ZINNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNBBBBBBBBBBBBBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOBBBBBBBBIII
                    AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

                    This.... was.... a.... SHOWDOWN! When I arrived in the
                    building specified by the note.. everything was dark..
                    with no light switches in sight. I yelled; quite stupidly,
                    in hindsight; "HELLO!?$#% YOU BETTER BE HERE Zinboobi'S!
                    AND YOU TO, BIG MAN!" and then waited. No answer. I
                    shouted again. Still no answer. Right when I was
                    considering going out and getting help.. I heard a voice:
                    "Good night, Mr. Jubjub"

                           WHACK!

                    When I awoke.. I was in a room as dark as the one I was
                    previously in. I was sitting, tied up.. to a chair at a
                    desk.. under a very bright, hot.. light. And then I
                    noticed something else. I wasn't alone in this room. I
                    didn't know it then.. but it was the big man.

                    The big man "Greetings, Mr. Jubjub"
                    Jubjub "WHY HAVE YOU BROUGHT ME HERE?!@ WHY HAVE YOU
                            DESTROYED EVERYTHING THATS EVER MATTERED?#@?%@#%
                    The big man "Isn't it obvious? You've threatened my
                    operation!! And about me destroying everything that ever
                    mattered to you.. I assure you that your brother is quite
                    intact"
                    Jubjub "WHERE IS HE?$!~@#@%"
                    The big man "He could be... anywhere. muahahhahahaha!"
                    Jubjub "Why have you brought me here?!#?$"
                    The big man "To extend a little.. offer."
                    Jubjub "Oh.. an OFFER eh? Like WHAT.. SCUM!?"
                    The Big Man "You and your brother used to be the best
                    wrestlers I ever had. The public loved you. If you would
                    just.. drop the charges...."
                    Me "NEVER!"
                    The Big Man "Maybe you don't feel like co-operating right
                    now. A little nap might help your temper. Hanz, franz;
                    if you please?"

                                   WHACK

                     I woke up in his basement. When I saw the door.. I knew
                     there was no escape. It was bolted, and re-inforced.
                     There was one upside. Nybar was there.. looking better
                     then I probably did. Having nothing to do.. we decided
                     to tell eachother what happened. Heres nybar's story:

        Nybar        "I woke up at around eight. I was really hungry.. so I
                     decided to make breakfast. Then I heard someone knocking
                     on the door. It was the pizza guy. Still being pretty
                     tired.. I didn't notice that it was 8:35 in the morning.
                     He asked if I wanted to have his pizza... and I said
                     yeah. When I opened it.. alot of gas came out. I woke up
                     here."
        Jubjub       "So why was the apartment wrecked?"
        Nybar        "I dunno.. I guess they just decided to trash the place"
        Jubjub       "They don't only cheat.. gamble.. and other things I'm
                      sure.. they're JERKS!"
                ....
                      Just then I heard something. It was the door. Someone
                      opened it a crack and threw a loaf of bread in. It was
                      *EXTREMELY* stale. Someone said `hahahahah.. enjoy
                      your cement bread!!!'. It LITERALLY had cement in it.
                      It was hard as a brick. I made use of it in an
                      unforseen way. I threw it at the wall. Now.. the wall
                      was pretty flimsy.. and I saw one brick that was extra
                      loose. I threw the cement-bread at it and it gave in.
                      From there.. we were able to pry loose enough other
