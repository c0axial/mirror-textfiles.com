 squirrels in my pants make me fuzzy - nybar

 At first, Nybar came down from the skies, and created Joltcola,
 and the earth, AND IT, WAS, GOOOODDDDDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 And then.. THEY BOTH DOTH CREATE THE SQUIRREL!! IT TO, WAS GOOD!!!
 Then, the squirrils DID create the ppl and the PPL did kill the SQUIRREL!
 The squirrels, being Nybar's new source of power.. when killed, cut him
 off from most of his power. SO HE WENT TO ACQUIRE NEW SQUIRRELS!!
 He took over the wussy planets (the yuppy system, pillow for weapons
 planet, and the "Easy come easy go is my philosiphy" planet)
 He came back w/ many squirrels in his MIGHTY! slacks! AND THEY DID FUZZ
 HIM UP!!!! AND, FROM THE SQUIRRELS AND THE FUZZ... HE DID MAKE THE CAT,
 THE DUCK, AND THE COW!!!!! They were his new source of energy. They
 steered society in stupid directions LONG DISTANCE! But recently, there has
 been worship of Nybar, and he liked it. He decided to get a cult. But alas,
 there was only 1 follower, ME! NYBAR! NAMED FOR MY GOD! AND ALL OF YOU
 WILL CONVERT!!!!!  Write my chruch at

 Dear Reader - Nybar
 
 I know this is now what you are looking for here in poupey, but,
 while studying for my new tale, I came up w/ the meaning of life.
 I believe this poem will sum it up.
    - I sit in my cubbyhole..
            WAITING!
            WAITING!

      I was shot by a disturbed youth w/ a machine gun,
            HURTING!
            HURTING!

       Why is it we all have ears?
        Except the blessed ones w/ no ears.
       ohhh, how I hath weeped to be deaf.
       ohhh, how I hath weeped to be deaf.
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
              Hope that helps... evey word a classic.
             <takes deep sip of coffee>
            AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
