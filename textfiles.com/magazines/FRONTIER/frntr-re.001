
CONSOLE RELEASES
Revision 1.0 (March 1994)
***********/\************

THESE are at the best of times only approximate, so please don't rely 
too heavily on this information as things usually do change before a 
game is released. If you know of a game which isn't mentioned, let me 
know. Releases are based on US release, you may have to wait a few weeks 
in other countries such as the UK/Europe and Australia. This list is 
included separately (not as part of the main text) because it is likely 
to grow much larger in the future. I'd prefer that it was kept in this 
archive and not posted or distributed separately.

the last few weeks and should be widely available.

SOME TIME IN THE FUTURE :- These are titles you will probably see in two 
to six months time. This list is in a way *intentionally* not complete 
because most likely other titles will be announced, and some titles may 
change. A list such as this could cover hundreds of games in production, 
though only the main (promosing) ones and titles that *appear* the 
closest to release will be listed here.

RELEASE PREDICTIONS :- Now some may see this section is a little 
pre-emptive, citing games that may or may not be coming out at all, but 
this can give you a good idea of what you *may* hear as 'news' in months 
time. Also listed are opinions on which console(s) the game is likely to 
come out on, if it in fact does.

* These are only pure speculation, so take them as they are.
