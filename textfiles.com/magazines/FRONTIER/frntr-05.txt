     FRONTIER returns, again after a delay of one month to bring you
     lots of exciting news and developments. Apologies and also thanks
     go out to those who contacted me when I planned issue 5 to be
     released. Sorry to let a few people down, but things were looking
     fine until unexpected distractions popped up :( At least it is nice
     to know though that people are waiting eagerly for each issue, its
     good to feel wanted! :) Frontier sort of got left out for a while,
     and by the time I got back to it, it was already mid August. Rather
     than release an incredibly late August issue, I decided that a
     better idea would be to release issue 5 in September.
        There have been a few of these delays lately which you have
     probably noticed, which has made me consider making the magazine
     bi-monthly, or decreasing each issue to mainly include news and a
     few reviews, with feature articles coming every couple of months.
     It is mainly these features articles that take the most time with
     Frontier, and to put together a decent one requires a fair amount
     of my time. Anyway, let me know what you think! it is largely up to
     you as readers as to how you would like the magazine to continue.

     Frontier is still looking for contributions from video game players
     from right across the world to make the magazine even better. The
     quick review format gives you an even greater opportunity to throw
     together a review, just put around 200-300 words together in
     whatever style you like and Frontier will publish it for all to
     read! We are also looking for general feature articles, similar to
     you have already read through previous issues of Frontier. If you
     think you are especially knowledgeable on one area of the video
     game industry, why not put together a feature article on all you
     know? What may seem obvious to you, will most likely be of interest
     to other readers. 

     The next few months are definitely going to be one of the most
     exciting of the last few years, with the release of the ineffable
     PS-X, Saturn, 32X, JaguarCD, and also exciting games such as Donkey
     Kong Country, Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo, Doom, uncountable
     racing games, and many more. Advertising is going to reach near
     fever pitch, with just about all the major video game manufacturers
     pouring millions into advertising over the months leading up to
     Christmas. Its going to be hard to ignore the fight no matter where
     you turn, as all the companies will be harping their 32 bit
     machines like there is no tomorrow. Unfortunately not all of us are
     rich enough (eg: like me :) ) to afford _all_ of this new
     technology, but then again, it doesn't cost a cent to sit back and
     watch the results unfold with a grin......

     UPDATES
     ***/\**
     ALTHOUGH Frontier aims to make fewer mistakes than some other
     magazines, it would be naive to think there wouldn't be any. In
     earlier issues, several people have pointed out some inaccuracies
     or clear mistakes. Thanks to those people who did so, if I don't
     know about it - I can't correct it :) No one has reported any
     obvious errors in issue 4, so there are no updates this month, but
     let me know if you find anything that needs updating next issue.

     CHANGES
     ***/\***
     For those who are just wanting to throw a few words together (say
     100-300) on a particular game, Frontier now includes a "Mini
     Review" section for these types of reviews. This should hopefully
     expand the number of reviews that we get in Frontier, as often
     people don't have that much time to throw together a full review.
     Full reviews will of course be preferred, but if you don't want to
     take the time then this is fine.

FRONTIER has been very grateful to the readers who have taken their time
to write to the magazine and express some ideas and opinions. I'm
_always_ after any sort of feedback, so whether you like everything, or
something really annoys you let me know. If you're willing to express
and opinion that you wouldn't mind publishing (maybe you've been
expressing an opinion in some of the console newsgroups) here's your
chance to let everybody else know what _you_ think.
   If you feel like a conversation on the console industry (or in fact
anything!) send my some email, the best ones will be published in
Frontier for others to join in on.

     PROJECTING - THE ULTRA64
     ***********=/\=*********
     Work on the Ultra-64 (the new name for Nintendo's Project Reality)
     is getting closer to a working prototype, after many months of
     constant "ifs" and "maybes". Several games are reported to be under
     development, both by Nintendo, and third party developers. Exact
     details are still under tight wraps, but the word is that the major
     video game producers already have the development stations in their
     hands.
        As with Nintendo's style, they are trying to keep all exact
     details secret until much closer to release. While they may be
     trying to dampen some of the (possibly less than impressive?) news
     for the next while, for such a project, even Nintendo will find it
     hard to keep details quiet for long.
        Many reports indicate that the Ultra-64 may be the first console
     to include new projection technology. For those who are a little
     unsure of what this means, imagine your own personal video game
     cinema displayed on your own wall (!) and you will have an idea of
     what Ultra64's projection technology will allow. If this turns out
     to be the case, no longer will you need a television set to enjoy
     your video games - the display device is actually built into the
     console itself! This also seems to agree with Nintendo's promise to
     deliver "virtual reality without a headset" which sounded almost
     entirely hype at first, but now seems a bit more credible.
     Projection technology might not be quite that revolutionary, but it
     will be an exciting experience for players. For more details and
     some guestimates of the final Ultra64, see our feature article in
     this issue!

     ATARi STEPS UP FOR THE HOLiDAY SEASON
     *******************/\****************
     Atari is planning on using the Christmas buying rush to help boost
     its flagging Jaguar sales. Up to $10 million dollars will be spent
     on advertising over the next few months, along with an aggressive
     attack against other console manufacturers such as 3DO, and the
     ageing SNES and Genesis. This campaign will include cable, and
     free-to-air television broadcasting, along with extensive print
     advertising.
	So far, the main problem that Atari has faced is the lack of
     Jaguar machines, as well as software being available in only a
     handful of stores. Atari has been looking carefully at this, and
     has been asking consumers what _they_ think will make the Jaguar
     sell better. To help increase availability, Atari is looking to
     extend new distribution partnerships, and persuade stores reluctant
     to stock Jaguar products to do so. Manufacture of machines at IBM
     is also set to be stepped up, so that more Jaguar units are
     available on the shelves in the Christmas rush.
        Atari has promised that many more Jaguar titles will also be
     released closer to the Christmas holiday period, to make the
     machine more attractive to a wider market. Several titles will be
     released simultaneously in October, and Atari expects up to 20-30
     titles to be available by Christmas.

     Late 1994 will probably decide the fate of the Jaguar. With so many
     other machines coming onto the market, and a stack of exciting
     software to go with them, Atari is going to struggle hard if they
     can't get a large existing base by the end of the year. While the
     machine may be the cheapest to buy, players will be reluctant to
     purchase a machine with a severe lack of recognition (largely media
     driven) and titles.

     PHiLiPS SETS THE FUTURE WiTH A NEW CD STANDARD
     *********************=/\=*********************
     Philips believe they have finally come up with a new CD standard,
     which could revolutionise the gaming market by the end of the
     century, possibly even sooner. Philips are well known for their
     initial development on the first CD's back in the early 1980's,
     where they quickly set the standard for the discs we know and use
     today.
        6-8 gigabytes are reported to be able to be stored on just one
     of Philips new standard-size CD disc, using improved pitting, and
     read-head technology. This is several times more than is currently
     possible on the standard disc, where only (yep, we can say that
     now!) around 500-700 megabytes are possible.

     This standard looks like also dominating the digital video market,
     where a replacement for magnetic video-cassettes has not really
     been viable enough to take off. In mid-1995, Philips will release
     the first players utilising the new standard, which is sure to
     revolutionise both the video game, and home audio-video market. Up
     to 200 minutes of CD audio, or around 134 minutes of very high
     quality MPEG2 compressed video can be filled onto one disk.

     A large question to be asked is just who will be the first video
     game company to include the standard on their machine? Sony,
     Nintendo, and Sega will already have their machines on the market
     by this time, so does this leave 3DO to sweep the board with 3DO2
     and this new standard?

     3DO ][ iN DEVELOPMENT
     *********=/\=********
     The 3DO standard is already making a strong entry into the video
     game market once dominated, and still largely controlled by the
     heavy-weights of Nintendo and Sega. Several companies have obtained
     hardware licenses for the system, and the good, and not so good 3DO
     titles are being now released. This flow isn't just going to dry
     up either, with much more coming its way to the 3DO in the coming
     months. Developers have been quick to see the opportunity to reach
     a newer audience, along with recognising the relative ease of
     programming a powerful machine.
        As first stipulated by the 3DO company, 3DO will not just be a
     single machine, but a growing standard. Keen to keep up with the
     increase in hardware capacity, 3DO has announced its preliminary
     standard for 3DO ][, where the first machines will be released in
     late 1995 or some time in early 1996. While this is only a initial
     standard, the final specs are not likely to be too different.

     PROCESSOR : 66mhz RISC (centered around the PowerPC chipset)
     MEMORY    : 4 megabytes RAM. 4k internal processor cache, 4k data
                 cache. 64K for save game storage.
     BUS       : 400 megabytes a second
     GRAPHICS  : 250,000 textured polygons per second. 150,000 triangles
                 per second. Hardware texture mapping, Goudrad shading,
                 3D perspective. Z-buffer support
     COLOURS   : 24 bit (basically the same as the 3DO-1 standard)
     OTHER     : MPEG compression as standard, MPEG2 as addon.
     RESOLUTION: 640x480 (interlaced)
     STORAGE   : CVD CD-ROM (approx 1.25meg/sec). 2:1 hardware
                 compression
     OUTPUT    : NTSC, PAL, HDTV, RGB, SVGA as standard (same machine
                 for all countries)
     INPUT     : Individual 32k RAM save cartridges, further upgradeable
     PRICE     : $300-$400

     3DO also plans on releasing a plug-in upgrade for existing 3DO
     units at the same time as 3DO-][ machines are released. Machines
     with this upgrade will supposedly perform the same as the
     individual 3DO2 machines. 3DO estimates a price of around $100-$200
     for the upgrade.

     If the 3DO2 standard turns out as planned, 3DO is definitely going
     to be the power machine of the future. 3DO mk2 blows away all
     current machines, including the Jaguar, Saturn, PS-X, and maybe
     even Ultra-64. 3DO's easy upgrade path will pay off, not only for
     3DO, but for 3DO owners as well.

     MORTAL KOMBAT 2 HiTS THE STREETS
     **************=/\=**************
     September 9th saw the release of one the largest games on this
     years game calendar, with Acclaim/Midway's universal release of
     Mortal Kombat 2. MK2 was released simultaneously on the GameGear,
     Gameboy(!), Super Nintendo, and Genesis along with an extensive
     advertising campaign. Australia, the US, and much of Europe
     witnessed the familiar juxtaposition of screen-shots and live
     actors across their TV screens trying to tempt players.
         Everybody who has so far played MK2 (including me!) find that
     the conversion has been excellent, retaining just about all
     features of the arcade version. MK2 offers a lot more challenge and
     variety than SSF2, making it a must for all beat 'em up fans. MK2
     also puts shame to the original SNES/Genesis first edition (MK1),
     which were released at about the same time last year - the amount
     of changes that have taken place between MK1 and MK2 make it an
     entirely different game (much as SF1 was a lot different to SF2).
     This time, SNES fans have probably received the best version,
     containing the full sound, and graphics from the arcade machine
     without sacrificing the gameplay. This was the main complaint over
     the conversion of MK1, suffering from several serious gameplay
     problems, especially on the SNES. Genesis owners are also in for a
     good conversion, though the game lacks some of the arcade detail
     and colours, but pretty much plays the same.
        Probably the best news for arcade purists was that MK2 marks a
     new marketing direction by Nintendo. No longer will Nintendo
     heavily censor games, and MK2 includes all of the blood, and all of
     the fatalities in their entirety from the arcade. A menu option to
     turn on and off the blood is also included for those wimps out
     there, although the game will still retain a MA15 classification.
     This move is to help beef up the image of Project Reality, where
     Nintendo aims to reach later teenage, and adult audiences, as well
     as the 10-16 year olds.
        For those who are not familiar with the arcade machine, MK2
     contains 12 varied characters, each with their own moves,
     battle-screens, etc. There are also two hidden characters in the
     game, which can be fought if you are good enough. Different to most
     other fighting games, players can execute multiple moves, where the
     timing of the move is equally important.

     Mortal Kombat 2 will probably the last of the continuing Mortal
     Kombat series to be released in such a universal way. Acclaim's
     license with Midway is officially over once MK2 is released on home
     systems, Midway taking up partnership with Nintendo. From
     indications, Nintendo looks to have secured an exclusivity contract
     with Midway, which means Nintendo will have a large say in what
     Midway games will be released for which systems in future.

     JAGUAR THE 10th!
     ******=/\=******
     It couldn't really be argued that Jaguar owners have had
     disappointment after disappointment after a promising release of
     the machine late last year. So far there are only seven titles
     available for the machine, a pretty bad record for such any machine
     that has been out for more than 6+ months.
        Hoping to sweeten the year slightly, Atari is planning a big end
     in the last quarter. Along with the JaguarCD addon to be released,
     Atari plans to release a further 15-20 titles by the end of the
     year. This will bring the total to around 20-30 titles, but can we
     still trust this figure?? Five of these will hit the shelves on the
     10th October, when we will finally see the release of the long
     awaited Alien Vs Predator, Club Drive, Doom, Kick Off 3, and Kasumi
     Ninja. Whether this is enough to save the Jaguar is very
     debatable, as the Jaguar will need a lot more games of this
     standard to be a success.


     OTHER NEWS
     ***=/\=***
     - Prices on the 3DO (mk1) have also dropped recently to a more
     reasonable $499, with some places offering up to 3 free titles with
     each machine. For those who have been interested in upgrading to
     the machine, it may still be wise to wait a further few months. New
     models by Sanyo, Goldstar, and Samsung are all going to hit the
     market, with a retail price sure to challenge Panasonic's 3DO
     domination of 3DO market-share. When machines such as the PS-X,
     32X, and Saturn hit the stores near the end of the year (or
     beginning of next year at this stage), prices are sure to drop even
     further.

     - Alien Vs Predator is already in cartridge production, and will be
     released later this month - for months now it has been one of the
     most requested titles of the year. While initially release was
     stated for some time in June, the game was pushed back several
     months to make several improvements. A 3/4 finished version was
     shown at the SCES, as reported in issue 4, but the good news for
     Jag owners is the AvP is even _hotter_ than was shown back in July.
     Texture mapping and lighting has been improved, along with the
     finishing touches to the levels - play testers say that the game is
     even more challenging, and better looking than the king of
     three-dimensional shoot'em ups, Doom. Unfortunately, even Jaguar
     owners are beginning to wonder, is this enough?

     - Large video game retailers, Babbages, and Software Inc. have
     decided to merge under the one company. While the two stores will
     continue to be trade under their separate names, the partnership
     aims to strengthen both retailers lead in the video game sales
     market.

     - AT&T has stalled its entry into the video game market for the
     time being, placing on hold its own 3DO machine, which was planned
     to include a built-in modem as standard. AT&T have indicated that
     this is only while they continue to consider their options in the
     video game market. The move is a bit of a mystery to most - maybe
     AT&T didn't believe they could release a product at a suitable
     price-tag for the market?


     RUMOURS
     **=/\=*
     Again, remember that this section is nothing more than it
     indicates, and simply rumours from other magazines, talk, media
     sources and the internet newsgroups. It is up to you how seriously
     you take these rumours.

     - Atari's Jaguar voice-modem could have been dumped, due to a lack
       of interest by the hardware manufacturer (AT&T) and faith in
       profits to be made in this area. This would be a disappointment
       to many Jaguar owners, as the voice-modem would have allowed
       multiple players to play other Jaguar owners right across the
       world.


			 COMMERCiAL ADVERTiSING
                         *********=/\=*********
OVER the last couple of months I have received a couple of requests for
advertising of a commercial type nature in Frontier. If you own, or are
part of a console retailing or mail order company, please contact me via
one of the methods mentioned at the end of the magazine if you wish to
organise an ad.
   Frontier offers a great way to help promote and sell your product
through a potential audience of several thousand in many different
countries world-wide. Your ad may include borders, ascii logos, etc to
draw attention to your product or business, but must be under 300 words.
   While readers may protest this as a form of commercialism that
Frontier has stayed to try clear of in the past, I don't consider it as
moving too much in this direction. The move is basically to help pay for
some of the games I buy or hire for review purposes, and in no way to
make a profit for myself.

     ULTRA64 - WHAT CAN We ExPECT?
     ************=/\=*************
     NOBODY could doubt that with the marketing and technical know how of
     both Nintendo and Silicon Graphics behind the Ultra64, the machine
     is going to be one of the hottest entertainment machines ever seen.
     Not only will it include much the same, if not better,
     specifications than either the Saturn, Jaguar, PlayStation, or any
     other games console, but it will retail at a very affordable $200.
     While all of these other machines may look very impressive, much of
     these are still for those only with a deep pocket, with the
     exception of the Jaguar (which has been largely unsucessful). With
     the Ultra64, Nintendo is aiming the machine squarely at the 10-20
     year old market, where the power of inexpensive 32 bit processing
     has yet to make a real impression over 16 bit technology. Ultra64
     is targeted to be the natural successor to the Super Nintendo, and
     at a very comparable price to even existing 16 bit machines this
     task seems quite achievable, and in a short period too.

     Nintendo has more than a decade of experience behind them
     when it comes to the video game market, and now well know what sells and
     what will not. Millions in advertising, and other incentives will
     be offered to the video game world as the system comes closer to
     release. Come Christmas 1995, hundreds of thousands of families in
     Western, and Asian countries around the world will be cramming for
     the Ultra64, simply because of the prestige that the name Nintendo
     has brought to the world of gaming.
        While at this stage, much about the Ultra64 is still not known,
     Frontier aims to uncover and speculate on what will likely, and
     what probably won't be included in Nintendo's Killer. To make this
     easier, the article has been broken down into several different
     categories, covering different aspects of what we will see in the
     Ultra64. How much of this will actually be in the final product
     remains to be seen, but whatever happens, mid-1995 is drawing
     faster every month.....

     STORAGE

     Nintendo has so far as deliberately stated that the Ultra64 will
     not include CD-ROM for the reason that the format does not include
     enough interactivity, and speed for the games Nintendo wants to
     provide. This seems to be a bit of a hollow excuse, as CD-ROM is
     rapidly approaching a very useable speed, as well as being a very
     affordable format. CD's are not only cheaper to manufacture, but
     are cheaper to package and distribute. Nintendo may in fact have a
     less obvious interior motive in not using CD-ROM, which has more to
     do with profits and control, rather than consideration for gamers.
     If Nintendo went for CD-ROM, not only would 'non-official' games be
     able to be released (being out of Nintendo's profits) quite easily
     with todays CD-ROM development technology, but there would also be
     the probability of unauthorised piracy of Ultra64 games. By going
     for a less well utilised, but still quite useable (and fast)
     standard, Nintendo will be able to continue a firm control on both
     profits and distribution.
        Whatever the real reasons, what Nintendo is likely to use
     instead of CD-ROM is 'Flash ROMs'. For those who are unfamiliar
     with the format, Flash ROM's are roughly credit sized cards which
     can hold a large amount of data (but much less than CD) on an area
     of approximately 10cm x 5cm. The standard flash-ROM card is an
     uncompressed 20megabytes (160megabits), and data can be accessed at
     a speed approaching microseconds per megabyte. More data (possibly
     50%) more can also be stored with forms of compression. While this
     provides a fair amount of storage space, it may limit the scope of
     future U64 games, with only 1/27th the storage capacity of CD-ROM.
     Since Ultra64 will largely rely on real-time texture mapping and
     rendering (see graphics), this may be less of a problem. Long FMV
     and pre-rendered animation sequences that players might be looking
     forward to with the PlayStation, Saturn, and 3DO are what we are
     not going to see on the Ultra64. When it comes down to it though,
     flash-ROM's may be a quite flexible and decent substitute to CD's.

     GAMES

     Nintendo looks to be aiming the Ultra64 largely at the same market
     that it has captured with the SNES, from ages 10-16. While Nintendo
     appears to be shifting its strategy to a more open one with regards
     to graphic violence, it doesn't seem likely that we are going to
     see restricted (18 years+) on the U64, like we may on the
     Playstation or 3DO. As the system price reflects, Ultra64 will be
     mainly aimed at the family market, with games that will appeal to a
     wide amount of people.
        The type of games we are going to see will probably be mostly
     action and simulation games that we have been used to on the SNES.
     With a limited storage capacity, large adventure games or complex
     RPG's with high quality 24bit graphics seem unlikely. Expect plenty
     of space, shooting, driving, and fighting games though!

     GRAPHICS

     The Ultra64 will include an implementation of SGI's 'Reality'
     engine, only seen in the most expensive of its work stations. The
     Reality engine allows lightning-quick generation and rendering
     (colouring, texture-mapping, lighting, etc) three-dimensional, as
     well as two-dimensional objects in real time at a full 24 bits. The
     advantage with real-time generation is only the textures are
     required for the visuals, everything else is calculated
     mathematically via software and hardware. This may make it
     difficult for some 16 bit developers, but for those who can program
     the machine well, the games will show the results. Truly realistic
     and life-like real-time generation of game graphics is still a holy
     grail for game developers, but it definitely seems possible in the
     U64 with the world's most powerful graphics system at its core.
     Resolution will be television quality, but will likely suffer from
     the same squashed screen problem on PAL sets due to the annoying
     differences in resolution between NTSC and PAL.

     As stated in the news section, U64 looks like including some sort
     of projection technology. What this will mean is that game images
     will beamed direct from the Ultra64 itself onto your wall in your
     home. This will make the Ultra64 both portable (not needing a TV to
     play games), and also allow greater resolution than television
     currently allows. How this will work in a lit room (who wants to
     play all their games in the dark???) is hard to imagine, but
     Nintendo seems to feel confident they have an answer. There will
     probably be a standard television connection as well as the
     projection window on the Ultra64's case.

     SOUND

     At the present moment, there isn't too much further that consoles
     can go than pretty much crystal clear 44khz we are used to with
     CD-ROM. Our ears are only capable of picking up a certain range
     of frequencies and quality anyway, so to go much further is only
     going to be pointless. Ultra64 will surely include CD-quality audio
     which will be mostly generated on the fly by the U64's sound chip
     during play. Three dimensional Dolby technology has also been
     licensed by Nintendo to use on the machine, meaning that music and
     sound effects will appear to come from different angles, giving a
     tremendous feeling of realism. Along with realistic sounding music,
     sound effects and sampled speech will also be possible in small
     numbers, again limited only by the storage capacity. The Ultra64
     plugged into your stereo and playing a game such as Killer Instinct
     should really be an experience!

     DEVELOPMENT

     Development for Ultra64 games will be, and is being done on Silicon
     Graphics work stations such as the $100,000 Onyx^2 and $20,000 Indy
     work stations. Even though the machine is long way from production,
     plenty of visuals and game design can still be done before
     developers even see a working machine. Hopefully developers won't
     forget it is the gameplay itself that matters most with the Ultra64
     (or any console in fact), and not just go for rendered graphics
     with not much else. Animation and rendering packages such as Alias
     and SoftImage are used to draw the majority of graphics for Ultra64
     games, which should be easily ported with little loss in quality to
     U64. Because the graphics engines in many of SGI's machines will be
     in many cases almost identical to the Ultra64, what you see being
     illustrated throughout Edge magazine (amongst others) is largely
     what you will see in the final product.

     EXPANDABILITY/OUTPUT

     To keep the machine's technology up to date, the Ultra64 should
     include some sort of expansion port to allow the addition of more
     advanced hardware later on (such as CD-ROM). Virtual Reality
     devices, extra peripherals, light guns, and other technologies will
     be a natural step for such powerful three-dimensional rendering on
     board the U64

     While Nintendo has probably not opted to include CD-ROM storage as
     standard on the Ultra64, that doesn't mean that the machine
     necessarily has to be locked out of the CD-ROM medium altogether.
     Nintendo may opt to take a similar approach to the Jaguar, by
     releasing the straight machine at $200, and then charging an extra
     $200 or so for a CD-ROM addon to provide better FMV, etc. If a
     CD-ROM addon _is_ to be released for the Ultra64, it will not be
     until late 1995 at best. The Ultra64 with the storage capacity of
     CD-ROM will truly be an ultimate gaming machine

     The Ultra64 may also include some sort of cartridge save system,
     much as the Playstation and Saturn will include. This will allow
     games to store their save/position data on one cartridge, rather
     than including a battery backup on each cartridge (which adds to
     the price of each game).

     CONCLUSION

     The Ultra64 will include most of the same technology that is being
     implemented in other 32bit consoles, and probably will not stand
     out too much more on first looks that the Saturn, 3DO, etc. The 64
     bit processor will make a bit of a difference, but as has been
     illustrated with the Jaguar Vs 3DO debate, when it comes to games,
     the jump in processing power doesn't really effect the game itself.
     Where the Ultra64 will really excel is in the graphics department,
     where the 'Reality' engine created by Silicon Graphics will allow
     blindingly fast real-time texture mapping and light sourcing with
     ease. With the millions that Nintendo and Silicon Graphics is
     spending to make the U64 a success, it seems almost impossible that
     the machine can fail come 1995. As more details come to hand,
     Frontier will definitely be publishing them.......

     MORTAL KOMBAT 2 - THE MOVES!
     ************=/\=************
     MORTAL Kombat 2, like the first edition (MK1) has little in the way
     of a complete move listing for the game in the manual. At best the
     manual just gives you the basic listing, and leaves the rest of the
     discovery up to you. Thanks to Frontier, now rather than spending
     hours fiddling just to find that one fatality, you can now refer to
     this (almost) complete list!
        If you find any further moves, contact Frontier with the exact
     key combination(s) so other MK2 players can benefit from the same
     move in future issues. You might even want to cut this out and
     print a copy to have on hand. Impress your friends....or just to
     show your superiority, beat the hell out of them! While several of
     these moves will take several minutes of trial to pull them off,
     even _with_ the correct combination, most of them are worth the
     wait, especially with the blood mode turned on :) Thanks to Jarrod
     Day for providing the moves for this list.

     IS THE UPCOMiNG CONSOLE WAR REALLY GOOD oR BAD?
     **********************=/\=*********************
     IT wasn't too long ago that gamers really had only two choices,
     either to go for the incredibly popular 8bit Nintendo, or go for
     the less popular, but slightly more powerful Master System. Only
     five years ago these were the main forces in the video games race
     and things were relatively simple. Even two years ago the choice
     was still simple, game players either went for the sleek and
     impressive SNES, or the Genesis - even many of the same games were
     released on both systems, making the decision not so important. Now
     things have changed dramatically with the introduction of a stack
     of new 32 bit (or better) consoles, each having one or more
     advantages over the others. Not only do they cost much more than
     five years ago, they are also less likely to remain the long life
     time that was once enjoyed by the 8 bit machines.
        No longer is it a simple choice of what game you wanted to play,
     but also a decision on the lasting nature, and number of games that
     are likely to be released for the system before it becomes inferior
     to something else. Now this can be good and bad news for gamers -
     resources, and different publishers are split across many systems,
     but there is also a lot more to choose from. The main down side to
     all of this is that due to the strong competition, console
     companies are always having to bring out some new hardware 'better'
     than their opposition to stay ahead, and retain a reasonable share
     of the market. The life-span of such consoles is therefore
     decreasing to an estimated rate of only 2-3 years, not exactly what
     you want to hear after splashing out $400 or so for the 'latest' in
     90's hardware.
        Already we are seeing plans for the 3DO-2, the Jaguar-2,
     JaguarCD, and even reported add ons for machines such as the Saturn
     and PS-X. Some of these machines are not even _released_ yet and we
     are hearing "hey, if you think this is good, wait for our _next_
     model". While the new hardware might be quite powerful, without a
     steady base of software and games for the system, the system is
     never going to live up to its full potential. If video game
     companies are busy trying to squeeze the last dollar out of their
     customers, at least we will see good _quality_ games, rather than
     games that are just released to try and sell a few more machines.
     Nintendo has largely taken this step with its now ageing SNES
     machine, by mid-1995 it will be four years since the initial
     release of the machine, but the number of decent titles is still
     quite strong, and in fact growing. Earlier on we saw titles that
     really were (not exaggerating either) quite pathetic, just released
     to try and build a bigger software base for the machine so they
     could say "look, we've got XXX games on our machine, which is XXX
     more than our competitor(s)". Now Nintendo (and to extent Sega with
     their Saturn) is beginning to realise, while obviously not stating
     so, that it _is_ going to face stiff opposition until the release
     of their machine, some months after the release of the other
     companies 32 bit 'wonders'. We are seeing more and more decent 16
     bit games, that a larger number are in fact almost _worth_ the flat
     $80 Nintendo is charging for them. Prices on these, and older games
     are also dropping, which means that players can afford much more
     games than if they splashed out with $300+ on a new system with
     only a few games available.
        While Sega, Nintendo, 3DO, and everybody else is designing these
     consoles they are ultimately creating better machines when they
     finally come around to release. If they release something that is
     poor hardware wise, it will not sell, which can be disastrous for
     the company(s) involved. That is why we have constantly seen the
     hush-hush, and changing specifications of many of these machines,
     to tell the truth about how the project is going is often a
     disastrous move.

     The main winner of the hardware war is ultimately going to be the
     consumer who takes the time to consider which system they want to
     stick with. In several ways the console war is both good and bad,
     and opinions vary greatly between who you speak too. My opinion is
     that while the companies are spending multi-millions trying to
     build the latest machines, _you_ are the only one who can
     ultimately say which machine you think _you_ like. The war means
     greater games available, better quality games available, and above
     all better hardware for the consumer. Nothing is forced upon the
     video gamer, persuaded heavily maybe :) but not forced. If you take
     the time to consider which system(s) look to provide the best games
     currently, and in the near-future, you are ultimately going to be
     the ones who can have the last laugh on the video game giants......

THE review section is not an integral part of Frontier, though an
important one. What is the use of talk on consoles, without reviews to
assess the quality of games that are available? If you wish to write
reviews for Frontier for any console, please check out the section: How
*YOU* too can help out with Frontier. While reviews of new games are
preferred, reviews of games up to _around_ 6 months old will be
published.

For those who are just wanting to throw a few words together (say
100-300) on a particular game, Frontier now includes a "Mini Review"
section for these types of reviews (see after the main reviews). This
should hopefully expand the number of reviews that we get in Frontier,
as often people don't have that much time to throw together a full
review. Full reviews will be preferred and remain a part of Frontier, but
if you don't want to take the time then this is good alternative. Should
only take maybe 10-20 minutes of your time, so even if you've only
played the game for a short while, get a "mini" review into Frontier
ASAP!
   Format for these mini reviews are pretty much open (include any
details that you like!), but try and include at least an overall
percentage - to tell the truth, often that is all that people look at
anyway.


     SUPER STREET FIGHTER 2
     *********=/\=*********
     .\ By Cyphron (cyphron@netcom.com)

     TYPE ................ Street Fighting
     FORMAT .............. Capcom
     DEVELOPER/PUBLISHER . Capcom
     RELEASE ............. July 1994
     PRICE ............... $70
     SIZE ................ 32mbit/4 mbyte

     LEVELS .............. 12 playfields
     DIFFICULTY .......... Variable
     PLAYERS ............. 1/2/simultaneous
     EXTRA INFO .......... n/a

     Have you ever heard the phrase "milking the cow"?  Capcom probably
     doesn't, and no, they're not only milking the cow, they're milking
     it until it bleeds! Capcom has managed to put together four new
     characters (for a total of 12), changed a couple of moves, added a
     couple, slap on "SUPER" and voila, a game that sells!

		 KILLER SOUNDS (Yeah, kill me please!)
     This game really has exploit everything the SNES has to offer and
     it still comes off short in the sound and graphics department. The
     "Round #, FIGHT!" is gone, although after a while of playing I
     didn't really mind. Capcom claimed that it was because of the
     shortage of ROM space, but I think it's because of the limited 64k
     area for sounds in the SNES. Dee Jay lost his "Max Out!" voice when
     he does his, well, Max Out!  That's really too bad, because all the
     other characters retained their original voices, albeit a bit bad.
     Guile's voice is the same as the announcer! Boy, talk about
     recycling! Okay, gripes aside, I'd say the sound is terrific for an
     SNES game. How can I compare it to the arcade with its Q-Sound chip
     and superior processors. But the music, I can't really complain.
     Some of the stages have music that's quite good, except for Ken's
     stage, which I think SF2 Turbo did better. However, the music
     seemed "turned down" so you really need to hook up the SVHS cable
     and turn on STEREO to really appreciate it.

		   KILLER GRAPHICS (Well, maybe not)
     The BACKGROUND has got to be the best part of the game and it is
     definitely the best of all the SFII carts for the SNES. There are
     lots of animation and background scrolling for most or all of the
     stages. (Although how come the moon moves with the clouds in Ryu's
     stage? DUH!) The characters and background isn't as highly defined
     as the arcade but then again, is anything as good as the arcade?
     (READ: 3DO) A lot of frames are missing, (which translates to
     missing moves) and you'll notice it immediately during the opening
     cartoons. Overall, not a bad cut-and-paste job from Capcom.

	       SFII PLAYABILITY (What more can you ask?)
     It's Street Fighter 2! 'Nuff said. The computer is rather easy to
     beat with Ryu or Ken on any level because the computer doesn't
     cheat as much. But when you start using other characters, the
     bosses will combo you to death, literally!  Well, it's probably
     'cuz I suck at other characters! ;-P FUN FACTOR It's Street Fighter
     2! 'Nuff said. Actually, after awhile, it can be a bit boring...

			      OTHER STUFF
     The endings are mostly like the arcade except some have pictures
     missing. There are an abundant of voices (not enough ROM, hah!) on
     the game and lots of options like VERSUS mode, TOURNAMENT mode, etc.
     What happened to Balrog's ending? He lost one picture (out of his
     two) and he lost the two babes sitting next to him, ARGGHHH! While
     I'm at it, the blood in the VS are now pink, and well, lets just
     say, THERE IS NO BLOOD!!! Nintendo strikes again... And if you
     think this game only has the 4 new characters, think again, because
     the bosses have TONS of new moves or rather new animation which
     would make playing them fun. Bison can be a real killer if you know
     how to use him.  And to most of you who are wondering if they have
     SSF2 Turbo in the game, sorry to pop your bubble, but NO. Although
     you do have Turbo speed adjustment. (big deal)

			    SHOULD I BUY IT?
     If you don't have Street Fighter 2 then definitely. If you have
     Street Fighter 2 then definitely. (Sorry, I'm an SF fan). But if
     you aren't into Street Fighting games, then by all means, don't!
     Although I can't see why you aren't a fan...

     KEN GRIFFEY JR. PRESENTS MAJOR LEAUGE BASEBALL
     ********************=/\=**********************
     .\ Stan Olson (solso@prairienet.org)

     TYPE ................ Sports
     FORMAT .............. SNES
     DEVELOPER/PUBLISHER . Nintendo/Software Creations
     RELEASE ............. April 1994
     PRICE ............... $49.95
     SIZE ................ 16 megabit

     LEVELS .............. ???
     DIFFICULTY .......... Easy to Hard (depends on auto-fielding)
     PLAYERS ............. One/two simultaneous
     EXTRA INFO .......... n/a

     Over the last 2 years, game programmers and baseball fans have
     looked at the baseball games for the SNES and decided it was time
     to stop messing around and develop a realistic baseball game.

     There are so many features in Ken Griffey Jr. MLB, I don't know
     where to get started! The AI of the game is unreal. Instead of the
     computer waiting after the ball has past them, they go for the
     ball as soon as it is hit, jumping, diving, whatever they have to
     do to help their team win the game. In other games I have played,
     the realism wasn't there. Either the ball didn't go fast enough,
     the players didn't run right, or the computer didn't know what a
     baseball was! In Ken Griffey Jr. MLB, all of the realism is there.
     If a player hits a deep drive to center field and it looks like it
     will just barely go over the wall, you can climb the wall and try
     to catch the ball. Another great feature is you can play in all 28
     stadiums in Ken Griffey Jr. MLB. The field is realistic like the
     real thing: astro-turf or grass, the color of the wall, the
     distances to the wall, etc. Another cool feature is the auto-
     fielding. This option controls your fielders so you don't really
     have to worry about fielding. You can also turn on manage only
     option to just act as the manager.

     There are 4 different choices on Ken Griffey Jr. MLB. The first
     is the single game option. Using 1 or 2 players you can pick any
     team to play and any stadium to play in. The second is the all-
     star option. This allows you either to play the all-star game
     or lets you participate in the homerun derby. The third option
     is the world series. Here you can play in the world series
     without having to play a full season. The last option is the
     full season option. You can choose between a 26, 78, or 162
     game season. In the 162 game season you get to play the all-star
     game in the middle of the season.

     There are some minor flaws that I have seen in the game. There
     should be more sound effects. I don't know if they ran out of
     room or just plain overlooked it, but there should have been more.
     Another little thing is there are no errors, whether you have
     auto-fielding on or off. Also, they should have gotten the
     MLBPA license instead of just the MLB. They probably just got the
     MLB license to keep the price low. I also think they could have
     added a feature to let you scroll around inside of the stadium.
     They went to a lot of trouble to make the parks and too bad
     you can't just look at them without having to hit a homerun!!

     Overall, Ken Griffey Jr. MLB is a great realistic baseball game
     that needs little improvement. At $49.95 retail and at many
     stores for $39, this game is a great buy!

     Game	 : Paladin's Quest
     Reviewed by : Bob Anderson (randers@mswisard.kla.com)
     Publisher	 : Enix
     Format	 : SNES
     Type	 : Role Playing

     Paladin's Quest is a pretty cool RPG from ENIX, who makes the
     Dragon Warrior series.  Some people object to their kind of
     cartoonish characters, but I found this game extremely satisfying.
     The story is this: you are an apprentice magician, or spiritualist,
     who is dared by a friend to enter a tower in your town.  Of course,
     you cannot refuse (maybe he DOUBLE-dared you) and you enter the
     tower, fight a few baddies and discover at the top.......a button.
     Of course, you push it  (you get double-DOG-dared ) and activate
     the ancient machine DAL GREN. Well, you are knocked unconscious
     after this, and when you come to, everything in your town has been
     incinerated and everyone has  been killed, save the elder who was
     training you.

     Now it's up to you to save the world, of course.

     This is a very satisfying game with an EXCELLENT story.  The story
     unfolds by bits; it's a somber-themed apocalyptic story but it's
     hopeful and funny, too.  You have two main characters and then you
     meet many others who come and go during the story.  The music  is
     also very good, sometimes bright and upbeat,  and often urgent and
     demanding.  It does what it should; it sets the tone for the action
     without being overbearing.

     Another neat thing about this is the user interface, which makes it
     very easy to select your next move or action without going through
     the sometimes clunky, multi-level, menu-based interfaces in other
     RPGs. Also, you can make your selections and play the game with one
     hand, leaving the other free for mapping (or whacking off.)

     My only complaint about this game was that it was too short. Great
     game - if you like RPGs, you should definitely play it!

FRONTIER hopes to include a variety of different cheats, hints,
solutions, etc for systems and games of all different types. The aim is
to produce new information that has not been published before, though
this of course cannot always be guaranteed. If you have discovered a
secret level, willing to contribute some accurate playing hints, just
finished a game and are willing to produce a solution, or for that
matter anything that will help out gamers, Frontier is after them!

     Simple...


HOW *YOU* TOO CAN HELP OUT FRONTIER
***************=/\=****************
FOR a magazine such as this to prosper, Frontier needs regular
contributions from its readers. From general articles, new releases, to
reviews and opinions, Frontier needs them all. Even small pieces of
information which you feel may not or may not be important, don't
hesitate to send them in. Most likely, if it hasn't been mentioned, we
don't know about it!

If you wish to become a regular reviewer for Frontier, drop me a line
stating the consoles you own, and which game(s) you want to review and
I'll email you the 'Frontier reviewer's guide'. This guide should cover
everything you need to know about writing a review for this magazine, or
for those who have never written a review before and want to.

The following things are specifically needed at present:

     - Gameplay co-ordinator position: To compile a list of cheats,
       hints and solutions for many games on many different platforms.
       You should be an avid game player and be able to discover
       material for yourself - eg: not taken straight from other
       magazines.

     - More reviewers: Although many have asked for and have been sent
       the reviewer's guide, I have heard very little back in the way of
       reviews from those people. Please get those reviews in if you
       intend on having them published!

     - More cheats: A lot of the cheats as you may notice are reprints
       of those that have appeared in other magazines. I am trying to
       stay away from this, so if you have an original cheat or hint
       please send it in.

     * For information on where to send any material or contributions,
       see the following section.

	 monitor) and I should be able to get back to you. Otherwise,
	 don't worry, I'm probably just dead :)
