CONSOLE RELEASES
*******/\*******
Revision 2.0 (April 1994)

THESE are at the best of times only approximate, so please don't rely
too heavily on this information as things usually do change before a
game is released. If you know of a game which isn't mentioned, let me
know.
   Releases are based on US release, you may have to wait a few weeks in
other countries such as the UK/Europe and Australia. This list is
included separately (not as part of the main text) because it is likely
to grow much larger in the future. I'd prefer that it was kept in this
archive and not posted or distributed separately without permission.

SOME TIME IN THE FUTURE :- These are titles you will probably see in two
to six months time. This list is in a way *intentionally* not complete
because most likely other titles will be announced, and some titles may
change. A list such as this could cover many hundreds of games in
production, though only the main (promising) ones and titles that
*appear* to be the closest to release will be listed here.

RELEASE PREDICTIONS :- I have decided rather than to repeat predictions,
each issue will be a new list, or only revised predictions. Check back
through previous issues for older predictions.
   The important thing to remember is that they are only personal
*predictions* or games that I would like to see and nothing else.
Somebody asked how I chose which system they appeared on - well the
answer is that I checked which developers are signed up for what
consoles and if they were, added them to the system likely to appear on.

* These are only pure speculation, so take them as they are.
