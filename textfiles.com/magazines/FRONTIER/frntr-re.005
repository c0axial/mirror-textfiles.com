CONSOLE RELEASES
*******/\*******
Revision 5.0 (September 1994)

THIS section of Frontier has been altered slightly. Now only future
releases will be listed, as is hard for me to keep up with all the games
that have been released by a month-by-month basis. So far, the "released
recently" and "to be released soon" categories have been fairly
inaccurate, and far from comprehensive anyway. If somebody who works for
a console retailer/distribution and regularly gets release lists can
help out, then please contact me.

Releases listed are based on US release, you may have to wait a few
weeks in other countries such as the UK/Europe and Australia. This list
is included separately (not as part of the main text) because it is
likely to grow much larger in the future. I'd prefer that it was kept in
this archive and not posted or distributed separately without my
permission.

These are titles that will be appearing in the next month-six months
time. This list does not list all new titles, as most likely other
titles will be announced, and some titles may change. A list such as
this could cover many hundreds of games in production, though only the
main (promising) ones and titles that *appear* to be the closest to
release will be listed here :-

RELEASE PREDICTIONS :- I have decided rather than to repeat predictions,
each issue will be a new list, or only revised predictions. Check back
through previous issues for older predictions.
   The important thing to remember is that they are only personal
*predictions* or games that I would like to see and nothing else.
Somebody asked how I chose which system they appeared on - well the
answer is that I checked which developers are signed up for what
consoles and if they were, added them to that system.

Nascar Racing    : Driving/simulation  : Papyrus : 3DO, Saturn
Alone in/Dark 3  : Adventure           : Icarus  : 3DO
