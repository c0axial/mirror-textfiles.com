* SKY SHOWS WHAT NO BROADCASTER HAS SHOWN BEFORE
  (Also in this edition: Writer shot for naff, cliche-ridden headlines)

Sky One will premiere the fourth season of "Star Trek: The Next Generation" on
May 3rd. The show will continue straight on from the current repeats of the
third season, currently airing daily.

Also in the Star Trek vein, the spin-off series "Deep Space Nine" will
premiere on Sunday, May 9th at 7pm, continuing weekly at that time. It was
previously thought that this series would begin screening in August, shortly
before the encryption of Sky One.

Deep Space Nine replaces Sky's long-running series 21 Jump Street. Also being
replaced in May is the "saucy" gameshow Studs, which disappears in favour of
daily showings of US Comedy "Night Court".

Also coming to Sky One shortly are The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, and The
Untouchables - not the black and white Robert Stack vehicle but an all-new
series.


* MORE ON THOSE RADIO STATIONS WE MENTIONED LAST WEEK

Expect two new satellite radio stations very soon on Astra. United Christian
Broadcasting will be broadcasting "Easy listening" music, interspersed by DJ
interruptions of great meaning and moral value. Expect to see this new
service on the 7.56 subcarrier on Sky Sports.

Also due is Quality Country Music Radio, which has now agreed a deal with Sky
to use the 7.56 subcarrier on Sky News.


* ANOTHER FABULOUS GERMAN CHANNEL ON ASTRA

"In Orbit", Superchannel's teletext satellite news page has reported that RTL
is in negotiation with SES for another transponder. The report says that the
broadcaster is seeking a transponder for "RTL-5", likely to feature more of
the same RTL, RTL-2 and RTL-4 style of programming.

However, don't expect to see this alleged new channel if it launches - the
report states that RTL are seeking one of Astra 1C's two transponders that
transmit on too low a frequency for domestic Astra systems to recieve. The
idea behind this odd arrangement being that the channel will be for cable
viewers only.

This seems a very strange use for a direct-to-home satellite. And the first of
April was weeks ago.

* WV LAUNCH NEW SATELLITE MAGAZINE

In your newsagents now is a new magazine from the creators of What Satellite
(TV). "Buying Satellite" combines "easy-reference buying information, advice
and topical programme listings".

Also featured in the first issue is a report on "New SEX channels!!!", details
on "Secret Satellite Stations", and a feature on top celebrity Bob Monkhouse's
"Amazing Home Satellite TV Control Centre".

It is worth noting the content of the old magazine from the creators of
"Buying Satellite". Called "What Satellite TV", this monthly publication
features buyers guides, programme listings, and this month has a special
supplement on "Secret Satellite Stations".

Among the pages in the first issue of What Satellite, back in May 1989, were
news of a ban on satellite pornography and a report on top celebrity Bob
Monkhouse's amazing home satellite TV system.


* CABLE NETWORK FOR SATELLITE VIEWERS

Further to our report on "The Cable Network" (Issue 2), it has now been
announced that the channel will transmit on Intelsat VI, home of fellow
United Artists cable channels Discovery, Bravo and The Parliamentary Channel.

The channel is reported to intend to broadcast from 1pm to 11pm daily.


* STILL BROADCASTING!

Following on from our report of DSF losing their licence to broadcast
(Skyguide Issue 4), The Bavarian Licensing authority is taking the decision to
the German Federal Supreme Court.

The authority were asked to withdraw DSF's license following a Bavarian
tribunal, concerned at the growing influence of Leo Kirch on the German media.
The authority themselves will await the decision of the court before taking
action.


* FAMILY VIEWING

The Family Channel will launch on Astra 1C later this year. Backed by US
Evangelist Pat Robertson, the channel will broadcast from the headquarters of
ex-regional ITV company TVS in Maidstone.

The channel is expected to provide competition for a proposed second
Thames/BBC channel, liable to be a subscription-based channel focusing on
Women's lifestyle programming.
