In the event, a few more stories turned up.. More hot news!

* CHRIS MANN JOINS SCOTT CHISHOLM IN THE DOLE QUEUE

Christopher Mann has been fired from Sky News for alleged gross misconduct.
This follows the Wednesday sacking of fellow presenter Scott Chisholm. The two
were known to be rivals, which on one occasion resulted in Chisholm putting
Mann in hospital.

Mann, who has been with Sky News for four years, said that in that time he had
recieved no warnings, either verbal or written. He has instructed his
solicitors to sue Sky for damages arising from his dismissal.

Meanwhile, Selina Scott continues to present Sky World News Tonight on her
own.


* MUCH MORE MUSIC ON MTV

Virgin 1215, the new Independent National pop music radio station, can now be
found on subcarrier 7.74 of MTV's Astra 1A transponder. (Tp 15)

The service is distributed to regional transmitters in the UK by satellite,
and it is said that there was some difficulty receiving their signal from a
lower-powered satellite, particularly in Scotland when weather was inclement.

The station is currently broadcasting test transmissions, and will launch for
real on Friday April 30th, at 12:15pm.


* GOLD GOINGS-ON

UK Gold's teletext service is now on air. It is produced for the channel by
London-based company Intelfax Ltd., who also provide full teletext services
for Superchannel and MTV, in addition to the "4-Tel" database on Channel 4.

Meanwhile, it is thought that publishing company Pearson, who own a VAT-sized
17.5% stake in BSkyB, is preparing to purchase a 58% stake in Thames
Television from Thorn-EMI. Such a move would give them a controlling interest
in the company.


* TV AND SATELLITE WEEK REVEALS SOME FIGURES

New satellite listings publication TV and Satellite week has unveiled its
early sales figures. IPC magazines currently print around 700,000 copies of
the magazine every week, although at the moment circulation has yet to top
200,000.

IPC claim this is due to "distribution problems", which are now being attended
to.

* DSF LOSE THEIR LICENCE TO BROADCAST

German sports channel Deutsche Sports Fernsehen has lost its license to
broadcast following a ruling by the Bavarian Industrial Tribunal.

The tribunal was concerned at the influence of a shareholder, Leo Kirch, a man
with a number of interests in the field of German Broadcasting.

Nonetheless, DSF is merrily continuing to broadcast, during which time the
Bavarian media authority intends to appeal against the ruling.


* ANOTHER AMERICAN NETWORK COMING TO ASTRA 1C .. MAYBE

It is understood that US Broadcasters Home Box Office will be leasing at least
one transponder on Astra 1C when it launches late next month.

HBO's service is likely to run major feature films and seriously rival BSkyB's
two movie channels.


* RED HOT BAN APPROVED BY THE EC

The European Community said this afternoon that the UK Government is not
breaching the "Television Without Frontiers" directive in its attempts to ban
Red Hot Television.

Joao de Crus Pinherio, an EC commissioner, said that it was clear that any
state could take action against channels that might "seriously impair the
development of minors".

Red Hot Television have their day in court to challenge the ban on April 23rd.


* AND NOW THE GERMANS WANT TO BAN THE ADULT CHANNEL!

The Heritage department, fresh from their attempts to initiate a ban on non-UK
broadcaster Red Hot Television have recieved a plea from the German government
to ban The Adult Channel. Attempts in Germany to ban the channel legally have
failed.

Johannes Voeking, German state secretary, wrote to Peter Booke seeking the
assistance of the UK Government. Following the Adult Channel's link up with
German erotica publisher VTO, they intend to begin a new season of films in
the German language. A number of trailers for the films have been already
aired on The Adult Channel.

German law dictatates that pornographic broadcasts are illegal, although soft
porn is permitted at a suitably late hour. The German government is said to be
concerned that hardcore programming may be uplinked to The Adult Channel from
the UK. The VTO link-up allows them to sell Adult Channel subscriptions in
Germany.
