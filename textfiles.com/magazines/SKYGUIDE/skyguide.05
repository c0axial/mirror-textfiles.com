* HERE IS THE NEWS

Not much to write home about this week..


* VIDEO DIALTONE

British Telecom has been attacked by the Cable Television Association
following the announcement of its plans to introduce a "video on demand"
service, sometimes known as "Video dialtone".

The idea would allow BT customers to request video programming - most likely
to be films - which would be sent to their homes via BT lines. Extra equipment
would be required in the home for the service, the technology for which is
liable to be available in under three years.

The Cable Television Association, representing cable television companies who
themselves are planning to offer a similar service, said that under
anti-monopoly rules drawn up by Oftel, BT is prohibited from offering such a
service until the regulations come up for renewal, which will not be before
1998.

* RADIO ACTIVE

Much seems to be happening on the Satellite Radio scene at the moment. The
feed of Virgin 1215 on Astra, as reported last week, is rumoured to be only
temporary, and that once engineering trials are completed, the Astra service
will cease.

Hopefully it's a decision that isn't set in stone - you don't need to be a
genius to recognise the much improved quality that even a mono Astra signal
gives over ordinary Medium Wave reception.

Meanwhile, Q-CMR (Quality Country Music Radio) has failed to launch as
expected (see Skyguide Issue 1). Reports suggest that the audio subcarrier
that they were hoping to use has been given to another broadcaster by BSkyB.
If this is the case, QCMR are likely to challenge the decision in court.

Two Christian Radio services are said to be launching soon. If and when they
appear, you're likely to find them on any of Sky's spare audio subcarriers.

Super Channel's "In Orbit" satellite news page, supplied by The European
Satellite User Group, reports that Power FM, a radio station on MTV's
subcarriers, is not closing, it is just changing its name (to Love FM), its
music format (to Easy Listening), and its satellite (to a digital delivery
mechanism on Eutelsat).

It was unclear from the somewhat garbled report whether the Astra service will
stay or go, although TESUG took the opportunity to have a go with the
revelation that it would be cheaper to give away dedicated equipment to cable
head-ends than to broadcast on Astra. Leaves the home dish owners out in the
cold, though.

Apparently the mailbag resulting from the closure of Euronet has prompted the
return of the station. Early reports suggest that the channel will return,
although possibly on a new transponder on Astra 1C. More news as we get it.

* SPRING GOLD

More new shows come to UK Gold in the springtime, including a mix of comedy
and drama drawn from the BBC's archives.

"Are You Being Served?" returns to Satellite television after its previous
screening on Sky's ill-fated Comedy Channel. "It Ain't Half Hot, Mum",
screened on UK Gold's opening night, also comes to the channel.

Ronnie Barker appears in seven different situation comedies under the banner
of "Seven Of One", and Mel Smith weighs in with "Colin's Sandwich".

A rapid repeat for "Moon And Son", starring Adam Faith, only recently
broadcast on BBC1. The popular vet series "All Creatures Great And Small"
appears, along with other dramas "Colditz" and "Rockliffe's Babies"


* NEW AND IMPROVED

>From this issue, Skyguide resticts itself to 78 columns per line, to be more
amenable to offline readers like Matrix.
