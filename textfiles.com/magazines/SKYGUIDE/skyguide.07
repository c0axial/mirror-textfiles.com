* RED HOT IN COURT

Red Hot Television had their day in the High Court today (Friday). Two High
Court judges refused RHTV's request to restrain Heritage Secretary Peter
Brooke from issuing a proscription order against the channel, but they have
referred to the European Court of Justice, who will decide whether the
Government's action was lawful.

The UK judges will not make a final ruling until the European court decide if
the Government action is lawful. The UK Ban on the channel will continue until
the European court hearing.

If RHTV was ruled illegal, it would be illegal to support the channel, list
the programmes, sell use or buy decoding equipment, or to advertise the
service. A spokesman for Continental Television said earlier in the week that
they would carry on selling decoders to the UK from Holland if they were
banned in this country.

The number of RHTV subscribers increased by more than 20 percent following the
Government's announcement of their intention to ban the channel.


* EQUITY STRIKE GOLD

Actor's union Equity has won another battle against UK Gold. Following a
disagreement earlier this year over repeat fees, BBC Enterprises conceded to
Equity's terms, allowing for increased payments to actors whose performances
were repeated on UK Gold.

Thames Television has also now agreed to pay repeat fees along the lines of
that original agreement. This now opens the door for complete access to
programmes in the Thames library, allowing screenings of more Thames
programmes on UK Gold.


* POTTY ADVERTS

The Independent Television Commission received just under thirty complaints
about an advert for Golden Wonder's Pot Snacks. The ads, featuring high-speed
computer graphics, are said to have triggered epileptic fits in three viewers
in the UK.

The commercial was also aired across Europe on MTV, UK Gold and Sky, although
it is not known if any European viewers were similarly affected.

The advertising agency had sought medical advice before beginning the
campaign, and replaced the commercial following the concern.

On a similar theme, the ITC has also received complains about adverts for "The
Guardian" newspaper. Some viewers have complained of dizziness and eye strain
following the commercials, which feature a fast-moving collage of words. After
due consideration, the ITC announced that they did not intend to ban the ad.

* WACO DRAMA ON SKY?

The Waco siege has been made into a TV movie. "Ambush At Waco" will be
screened in America later next month. Actor Timothy Daly will play the part
of David Koresh, leader of the Branch Dividians cult.

World International Network, the distibutors of the movie, say that the drama
has already been sold to a British Broadcaster, although they are unwilling to
reveal which one. While Sky has purchased a number of real-life dramas from
WIN in the past, ITV also stand a chance of screening the movie, bearing in
mind that Central Television is a member of WIN.


* NEW FACES ON SKY NEWS

Sky has announced the recruitment of two new presenters to the station,
following the departure of Scott Chisholm and Chris Mann.

Presenters Frank Partridge and Laurie Meyer, both from the BBC, have been
chosen to fill the gaps.


* THE BIG FIGHT - ONLY ON SATELLITE

Pace has spectacularly annoyed Amstrad with its current advertising campaign,
which makes comparisons between Pace and Amstrad satellite receivers,
predictably with Amstrad coming out worse off.

Both companies have long disagreed with each other's claims regarding their
respective shares of the UK satellite dish market in the past.

Amstrad has now served a writ on Pace for libel, slander (of its goods) and
malicious falsehood.


* THREE NEW BBC CHANNELS FOR ASTRA

The BBC has announced it intends to launch three new channels next year on the
Astra 1D satellite. [D for Delta, this is not a mistake] The three channels
will comprise a news channel, a documentary channel, and a children's channel.

Director General John Birt has agreed to the move, and the BBC have said that
they feel it is important to get into a "genre" early. The channels are likely
to be supported by advertising in the initial period.

The announcement looks set to create head-on competition with a number of
channels in Sky's subscription package due to launch later this year,
featuring, among others, the news channel Sky News, documentary channel
Discovery and children's channel Nickelodeon.

The BBC sought to downplay the competition, saying that in particular their
documentary channel would complement Discovery, rather than compete with it.

Talks were ongoing some time ago regarding the feasibility of a joint news
channel with Sky, but it is understood that agreement could not be met since
Rupert Murdoch insisted on overall control.

The BBC will also be involved in the Thames "Women's Lifestyle" channel, set
to launch on Astra 1C.

* YET MORE AMERICAN NETWORKS ON ASTRA 1C ?

Little more than strong rumours at the moment, but it looks likely that
American film and television giants Paramount and MCA will launch two
channels in Europe on Astra 1C.

Both The USA Network and The Sci-Fi Channel are already running in the US,
and the move is in line with many American broadcaster's desires to enter the
European market.

The Sci-Fi Channel is a particular cause of angst in the USA, since many cable
television networks do not carry the channel, despite large demand from
viewers. Many US cable networks have now reached their maximum capacity - as
little as 30 channels in some cases - and no further channels can be added
without dropping an existing channel, or upgrading the network.

Neither options are particularly attractive to US cablenets - upgrading a
network is very expensive, and with so many channels actually paying to be
carried - such as Home Shopping or evangelical channels, there seems to be no
easy solution.


* SKY SHAREHOLDER BUYS THAMES

Pearson, publisher of the Financial Times and BSkyB shareholder to the tune of
17.5%, has purchased Thames Television for 200 pence per share, valuing the
company at some 99 million pounds.

Majority shareholder Thorn EMI, owning just under 59% of the shares, have
agreed to Pearson's bid, so it looks very much like a done deal.

Thames Television lost the London ITV franchise on December 31st last year,
but continues to make a number of programmes for the ITV Network, as well as
being involved in the satellite channel UK Gold.

Thames shares rose sharply to around 195 pence per share following the
announcement this morning, up twenty pence.


* WHEN IS DEEP SPACE NINE ON?

Sky One's May schedules are all over the place, and it now looks as if Star
Trek: Deep Space Nine may have been moved back for screening in the Autumn
after all.

"The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles" now seem almost certain to be taking the
Sunday 7pm slot from May 2nd.

It's all very confusing, with a number of conflicting reports. I'll be
absolutely frank, I don't know what the hell is happening. Your guess is as
good as mine!


* A DATE FOR THE DIARY

Assuming good weather, expect Astra 1C to launch on Wednesday April 28th.
Don't expect to see any transmissions from the satellite for a while though,
it'll take a while to get into position.

* ISSUE TWO FOR NEW MAGAZINE

Issue Two of the new magazine "Buying Satellite" is in your newsagents now.
Sadly they couldn't manage to go one month without the word "SEX" appearing
on the cover again.

Among the highlights is details of how to video satellite TV - useful advice
if you do not possess the July 1989 issue of "What Satellite" (from the same
publisher) which carries a feature on "how to video satellite TV".

Buying Satellite is, of course, designed for a non-technical audience. The
cover strap says "Your e-a-s-y guide to buying and using satellite TV",
presumably spacing out the letters in "easy" in order that its readers are not
confused by the long word.

There's definitely room in the market for a "novice" publication like this,
although if Issue 2 is anything to go by, this is not the one. A brief flick
through the magazine revealed a number of excruciating errors, some repeated
as many as three times.

We particularly liked the advice that a centre speaker in a surround sound
system should be placed in front of your television (which may somewhat
obstruct your view of the screen).

Satellite novices will also be interested to hear that "The Adult Channel"
broadcasts for three hours a night (um.. four), on Sky One's transponder,
(no..) that TCC starts at 4.30pm (5pm actually) and that it shows a
home-produced programme named "Saved By The Bell" (which hitherto a small
American network named "NBC" were rather under the impression that they were
responsible for).

But enough of the sub-editing.

.. Which may have been what the publishers said. :-)


* RASPBERRY OF THE WEEK

.. goes to Sky News for completely failing to report the news about Red Hot
Television this afternoon. Admittedly they did seem a little busy covering a
story about an alleged takeover of "The Observer" newspaper, very manfully
staging an OB from "Central London" at the "Observer HQ", which is more
commonly known as "Marcopolo House", home of the defunct BSB.
