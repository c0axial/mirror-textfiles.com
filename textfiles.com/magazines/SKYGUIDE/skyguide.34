* HELLO, HELLO, IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK..

A new issue of Skyguide at last! Apologies for the long delay, but hopefully
it was worth waiting for!

* QVC SETS SIGHTS ON EUROPE

Home shopping channel QVC, currently broadcasting to the UK and Ireland as
part of the Sky Multi-Channels package, is said to be planning to expand into
European markets.

Clarification of the legal situation would, however, be required from the
European Community. The current position is that teleshopping channels are
prohibited unless they broadcast to one member state only.

Meanwhile, German catalogue company Quelle has plans to launch its own home
shopping channel on Astra, with a view to capturing the East European market.

* SPORTS ON ONE, NOT TWO

Sky has temporarily shelved plans for Sky Sports Two (again) by transferring
football matches which clash with the current West Indies cricket coverage to
Sky One.

The move is partially for technical reasons, namely the difficulty in getting
viewers to re-tune their receivers, but primarily for marketing reasons. The
football matches on Sky One are achieving very respectable ratings, and is
likely to bring an increased number of new subscribers to Sky Sports.

While the football is screened on Sky One, all the Sky Multi-channels
broadcast in soft videocrypt mode, so a viewing card is not required. Again,
this is partially for technical reasons (there are some Sky Sports
subscribers who do not take multichannels), but also with the marketing
intention of capturing the die-hard viewers who have not taken up a
subscription to multichannels.

The first clear match, Wimbledon v Man United pulled in just under 1.5
million viewers - the second highest number of viewers ever achieved on Sky
One.

* NO NICK

Unconfirmed reports suggest that Sky and Viacom have dropped plans to launch
Nick At Nite, advertised as part of the Sky Multi-channels package.

Earlier reports suggested that the channel had been delayed due to problems
with programme rights and acquisitions.

In the event that the channel is dropped, at least for 1994, it is likely
that the Travel Channel, already broadcasting on Intelsat 601 (27.5'W) will
be offered time on Astra and will join the multi-channels package to replace
Nick at Nite.

In this event, the only apparent spare time is the 6am-7pm time on Transponder
24, or the currently vacant (and Sky-owned) Transponder 47, which could be a
more likely option.

The Travel Channel currently broadcasts midday to midnight on Intelsat, so
while there is enough time available on Transponder 24 to carry the channel
in its entirety, the time-shift could be a problem for the channel.

* AH, I SEE THE PROBLEM..

The failure of the Ariane 63 launch, carrying the Turksat 1 and Eutelsat 2F5
satellites, was due to cooling problems and a faulty bearing.

Alterations to equipment are now underway to prevent the re-occurence of such
a problem, but this will mean that this year's launch schedule will not
resume until the beginning of June.

This means that, much more importantly..

* ASTRA 1D DELAYED

Astra 1D will not launch until December this year as a result of the Airane
problems.

The satellite was originally set for a September launch, but this will now
not happen, putting a spanner in the works of a number of broadcasters who
were counting on a successful launch on-time.

It is reported that all available transponders on Astra 1D have already been
booked, although further details are yet to emerge.

* THE 'LE' EFFECT

NBC Superchannel viewers will already be used to the nightly screenings of
editions of the "Tonight with Jay Leno" show, under 24 hours after they are
broadcast in the USA.

Sky viewers will soon be able to enjoy the CBS equivalent "Late Night with
David Letterman", which will broadcast five nights a week on Sky One, again
less than 24 hours after their USA screening.

The deal between CBS and Sky is understood to be worth some 650,000 pounds.

Meanwhile, the German channel Premiere, which has been screening the series
for the past few months, has decided to end its broadcasts of the programme.

* AWAY WITH THE FROST

Sky News does not intend to continue broadcasting repeats of "Frost On
Sunday", it has been revealed. The channel currently has an option to
broadcast the programme shortly after its screening on the BBC, under an
agreement which allows Sir David Frost to sell the programme to another
channel and keep the money from the repeats.

The director of Sky news, Ian Frykberg, said that there was a conflict with
the transmission of the same programme on BBC World Service Television.

* THAT WORLD SERVICE TV CONFLICT IN FULL

Rupert Murdoch said at a recent press conference in Delhi that he may drop BBC
World Service TV on the Asian Star TV satellite service, and replace it with
an international version of Sky News.

Murdoch was speaking about allegations of bias that had been made against
WSTV by China and India.

WSTV recently caused controversy in India when it screened footage of a local
race-related incident that the state networks did not consider suitable for
broadcast. It is claimed that rioting broke out in the country as a result.

China recently banned the sale of satellite dishes, since it does not relish
the possibility of its residents having access to any version of the truth
other than that which is written by the state and broadcast on state-owned
television.

Sadly it seems that Rupert Murdoch, keen to forge links into the lucrative
markets that India and China have to offer, intends to take sides against the
BBC, and unless they address the allegations of bias (i.e. truth), that WSTV
will be replaced.

A BBC spokesman said that allegations of bias were "unsubstantiated and
nebulous", and added that the corporation had not recorded any complaints
from the Chinese or Indian governments.

* KISS AND MAKE UP

The BBC and Sky are, however, expected to join forces next year to bid for the
rights to cover the Five Nations Rugby Tournament next year.

Commercial broadcaster ITV is also said to be very interested obtaining
exclusive coverage of the event, viewing it as a high priority for
acquisition.

* THE CLARY EXPERIENCE

UK performer Julian Clary is to join TNT from April to host its new Sunday
evening "Movie Experience" slot.

* MORE CABLE

Cable had its best rate of installations ever in the last quarter of 1993,
with 91,000 new people hooked up to the service.

In the same period, some 220,000 satellite dishes were sold.

It brings the total number of cabled homes to just over 610,000, and the
total number of dished homes to still well over three million.

* MORE MURDOCH

The offices of American television stations KSBW and KSBY in California had a
visit from Rupert Murdoch recently. Apparently he is considering buying the
stations for his daughter, Elizabeth.

* MORE VIEWERS

Satellite viewing jumped dramatically in February, up some 5% on the previous
month.

Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network and The Children's Channel all saw a healthy
increase, largely due to the half-term break. Sky Sports also saw a large
rise, picking up over 5% of the audience compared to under 3% previously.

* LESS TO SEE

United Artists, provider of a number of television channels for the cable
television industry in the UK, has announced that it will cease its
conventional PAL broadcasts of Wire TV and The Parliamentary Channel in May,
in favour of a digitally compressed service.

The channels will share just one transponder on Intelsat 601, thus saving UA
some 1.2 million pounds a year in transponder and uplink rental. While cable
operators will have no trouble obtaining suitable digital decompression
equipment, (UA would be able to afford to give it away since it is saving so
much money on transponder rental) home viewers are likely to be very much
left out in the cold.

* AN AMAZING DISCOVERY

Viewers in Singapore are to get their first taste of "Commercial
Presentation" features soon.

The Singapore Broadcasting Corporation has signed a deal with Quantum
Marketing International to broadcast selected Quantum informercials daily on
Channel 5.

* AND SPEAKING OF CHANNEL 5... (I don't just throw this together, you know!)

A consortium hoping to run a new terrestrial network in the UK, Channel 5,
have revealed that they have had informal talks with Sky Television. Sky is
apparently interested in making inroads into terrestrial broadcasting, and
would be interested in taking a stake in the new consortium.

The consortium is backed by Pearson [itself part-owners of Sky], Time Warner,
and Media Acquisitions International (MAI), owner of the current terrestrial
ITV contractors Meridian and Anglia.

* LIVE SKY

Viewers who don't have access to the current cricket coverage on Sky Sports
could console themselves by getting down to Cromwell Road in London, where
Sky has converted an advertising hoarding into an electronic scoreboard to
continually read out the latest score.

The board is operated by a cricket enthusiast, recently recruited by Sky, who
will watch the matches on Sky Sports and update the scores when they change.
While he said that he would have done the job for free just to watch the
cricket, he is being paid an impressive 500 pounds per week for his duties.

* T C C

The Chinese Channel has announced that it will launch its European service on
Astra on March 18, although it helpfully refuses to tell anyone which
transponder it will launch on.

* THE ASTRA DEMO IS BACK!

Astra viewers will doubtless remember with fond memories the entertaining
promotional video that used to air continuously on the spare transponders of
Astra 1A, and later Astra 1B. The promo was displaced a while ago when
broadcasters began queuing up for space on the satellites.

Now the video has returned, revised and updated, and airing from 6am to 7pm
on the vacant time on Transponder 24.

* SKY FOR FREE

Sky's promised preview weekend for non-movie subscribers, delayed from its
original date in February, has now been announced for the weekend of April 9
and 10.

The previous attempt had to be cancelled due to the objections of several
major movie distributors. Presumably these difficulties have been ironed out,
since Sky intends to "give away" a number of major movies in the April
weekend, including Wayne's World, Cape Fear, Lethal Weapon 3, Alien 3, Edward
Scissorhands and Star Trek 6.

Sky Movies Gold will apparently not be included in the promotion.

* PIRATE WATCH

Canal Plus recently altered its coding system to knock out the recent batch
of pirate cards circulating around Europe for its service. Sky also
implemented a similar measure recently to again invalidate the pirate cards
for its service.

An interesting case of double standards arose recently on the pages of NBC
Superchannel's teletext service, and specifically the satellite news pages
'In Orbit', provided by the European Satellite User Group.

In response to a viewers letter, it made a statement completely denouncing
pirate cards, making the point that if everyone had such cards no
broadcasters would be able to stay in business. For this reason, it said, it
would not supply information on such pirate cards.

The statement was particularly interesting in view of the fact that just four
days ago it published an article giving some vital publicity to pirate card
manufacturers 'Keycard' in Ireland.

The statement is especially astonishing in view of the fact that for several
months the only advertising pages that 'In Orbit' carried were for a company
selling pirate cards and decoders for a large number of satellite channels.
Curiously, the advertisment disappeared on the day that the anti-pirate
rantings were broadcast.

TESUG has never been particularly in favour of scrambling, citing it as a
reason why everyone should turn their Astra dishes to point at the much more
interesting Eutelsat birds, but this recent turnaround in opinion does seem
to have occured with lightning speed. There may be two reasons, primarily
that now that the 'In Orbit' pages are also carried on UK Gold's teletext
service, that it would be seen as "incompatible" to promote pirate activity
on a channel which is, itself, scrambled.

It is also likely that NBC Superchannel would rather not have anything on
their teletext service which could cause a potential problem with Sky, whose
co-operation it is likely to need in the future now that it is desperate for
an Astra transponder.

* HARD TARGET

Filmnet has recently announced that it has made an agreement with a number of
major movie distributors to screen movies at the same time as they are
released in the cinema.

If this proves to be the case, it will make the channel an even hotter target
for pirates than it is already.

* AND SPEAKING OF MOVIES

Cinevision, a new Swiss Channel, has announced that it will launch on one of
the Eutelsat satellites, possibly the craft at 13 degrees East.

The channel plans to show movies 24 hours a day, in English, French, Italian,
Spanish and German. It is understood that the channel will be scrambled with
Videocrypt 2.

* TELE-ON

British Telecom is testing its proposed Video On Demand system in the homes
of 70 of its employees.

The service, as reported in previous editions of Skyguide, would transmit TV
programmes and films down the customer's existing telephone line. A key
feature of the service is the interactivity it can offer.

The UK cable industry is unhappy about the idea, viewing BT's plans as quite
comprehensively treading on their toes.
