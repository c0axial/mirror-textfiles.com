* JUDICIAL REVIEW FOR RED HOT BAN

It took just ten minutes for Red Hot Television to win permission for a
Judicial review in the High Court, on Wednesday this week.

The judge, Justice McPherson, said that there was an arguable case for a
judicial review, although adding that "It seems to me a bit bleak that we can't
stop pornography coming into this country if we don't want it to". Mark Garner
of Continental Television said the ruling was a "Victory for democracy".

The UK Government intends to proscribe the channel under Article 22 of the
European Community's ironically named "Television Without Frontiers"
directive. This allows member states to block broadcasts which might "seriously
impair the physical, mental or moral development of minors".

However, Article 22 goes on to say that broadcasts may be proscribed EXCEPT
when "it is ensured, by selecting the time of the broadcast or by any technical
measure that minors would not normally see such broadcasts" - As RHTv
broadcasts after midnight and requires a smart-card based decoder (of which
more later), it seems to comply with the directive on both counts.

Continental Television have employed leading media barrister David Pennick to
handle their appeal.


* RED HOT RUSH

The Government may have done RHTv a favour - following the announcement of the
ban last Friday, more than 3,500 people rushed to get subscriptions to Red Hot
Television over the following four days. Much overtime was had by all, it is
claimed.

This brings the number of subscribers in the UK alone to around 27,000.


* HARDCORE UK

Meanwhile, The Adult Channel are refusing to comment on speculation that they
will uplink from abroad in order to show more explicit films to their 135,000
viewers.

SES, owners of Astra, have recently stated that they would not allow Astra to
be used as a vehicle for the bypassing of UK laws on pornography.

The Adult Channel is apparently putting pressure on the Government and
Independent Television Commission to allow them to uplink harder-core
programming from the UK.


* THE HOT TICKET

RHTv are soon to be posting out smartcards to their subscribers. The cards are
advertised as working in one of Continental Television's "Enigma" decoders, or
in viewers existing Videocrypt decoders. Transmission tests of the new system
are ongoing.

* EVEN NON-VIEWERS WANT THE CHOICE

According to a survey of 1,200 people, most viewers disagree with banning
channels that feature explicit films - as that is censorship.

The majority of people polled said that even if people do not wish to watch
hardcore programming, they should be allowed the freedom of choice to do so, as
long as the programming was limited to after midnight and children were not
exposed to it.

Only one in three actively disapprove of hardcore on television, with just one
in seven disapproving of the "soft" pornography that is already available.

The poll proves that not all opinion polls are biased to reflect the views of
those who commission them. This particular poll was commissioned by the
Independent Television Commission, who have been badgering the Government for
quite some time to outlaw Red Hot Television.


* YET ANOTHER STORY ABOUT HUNDREDS OF CHANNELS FROM ASTRA

SES have now confirmed that they will be launching a sixth Astra satellite in
1995. Astra 1F will join Astra 1D and 1E as carriers of compressed digital
television transmissions, which could result in the much-quoted figure of 180
channels from one dish.

Astras 1D, 1E and 1F will be able to carry conventional analogue television
like Astras 1A, 1B and 1C, as well as a much higher number of digitally
compressed television services.

Naturally viewers will need some leading-edge technology in their own homes to
decode the digital transmissions. It is hoped that a common platform can be
established among a number of differing possible formats for the broadcasts.
Any such equipment is unlikely to be seen before the end of 1994.

The decision to launch the sixth satellite was confirmed by Dr. Pierre Meyrat,
SES's director general, in Los Angeles, where he was viewing the Astra 1C
satellite which is due to launch in May this year.


* WRN RETURNING TO ASTRA

The World Radio Network, a radio station made up of programming from radio
broadcasters across the world, returns to Astra on the 1st of July this year.

The service had transmitted experimentally last year on an audio subcarrier of
The Comedy Channel. The new service will be transmitting on a subcarrier on
Sky News.

A report on Radio Sweden indicated that a number of broadcasters are already
signed up for the service, including the USA's National Public Radio, Vatican
Radio, Radio Finland, Radio Japan, Radio France International and Radio Canada
International.


* DAS DEUTSCHES STEREO KANAL

German entertainment broadcaster Sat-1 is planning to transmit a stereo
soundtrack for its programming on Astra.

It already provides a stereo soundtrack on its service on the TV-Sat satellite.

* BBC SATELLITE RADIO "A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION"

Chris Garrett, leader of a campaign to save Radio 4's Long Wave broadcasts in
the face of the BBC's decision to launch a news service on the frequency, has
greeted the news of the BBC's radio broadcasts on Astra as "A step in the right
direction".

The Astra service, to be launched officially on April 3rd, brings the stations
into homes across Europe, where a number of ex-patriate listeners were upset at
the prospect of losing Radio 4. Listeners in the UK were also concerned that
they may lose the service as their FM reception of the station was marginal.

Mr. Garrett made the point that many listeners will not be able to afford the
receiving equipment, and that satellite radio cannot be received in cars.


* KEEP AN EYE ON SKY

Sky's programming will be under scrutiny in a two-week investigation by the
Independent Television Commission, starting this Saturday.

Programming on Sky, ITV and Channel 4 will be monitored from 6pm to midnight
each day for acts of violence. The study is intended to prove false the claims
that "there's nothing but violence on TV".

On the first day of their survey, the ITC will be able to note a number of
explicit acts of violence in Sky's pre-watershed screening of Terminator 2.


* CABLE LIFESTYLE

Many cable operators across the UK found themselves deluged with complaints
following the closure of the Lifestyle channel. They're hoping to fill the gap
with a new channel, "The Cable Network", which would primarily cater for the
Women's daytime market.

TCN, which launches on May 4th, will feature a number of programmes on topics
such as cooking, fashion and pet care, as well as quizzes and competitions. It
is also currently considering purchasing some of Lifestyle's more popular
programmes.

It's unlikely that satellite viewers will be able to get in on the action,
though, since it is thought that the new channel will be delivered to
cable head-ends on videotape.


* UK GOLD FILLS IN THE BLANKS

New shows in April for UK Gold include the game show Blankety Blank, which
will be screened daily in the 5pm slot.

New in the evening is Colin's Sandwich, starring Mel Smith - 10:30pm on Friday
nights from April 30th. Also a screening of the popular satellite spoof series
KYTV from Monday April 19th at 10:30pm. Carrott's Lib takes over once the
supplies of Carrott Confidential episodes are exhausted.

Another blank being filled in the shape of UK Gold's teletext service, which
launches on April 2nd, providing enhanced listings and synopsis information
for programmes, amongst other things.

* DALEKS? WHO?

Apparently no Dr. Who episodes featuring The Daleks can be screened on UK Gold,
since permission to show any Dalek stories on Satellite television has been
witheld by the writer.


* SKY ONE AIMS FOR LIFESTYLE VIEWERS

Sky One could be hoping to attract the audience of the defunct Lifestyle
channel in April - game show Concentration is screened daily at 10:30am, and
talk show Sally Jessy Raphael gets a daily outing at 2:15pm.


* ANORAK TIME

It was Pal Plus night on 3sat's transponder this (Friday) morning - around one
and a half hours of widescreen tests took place from 1am UK time. As well as a
BBC High Definition film of a Scottish castle, a number of helpfully-labelled
