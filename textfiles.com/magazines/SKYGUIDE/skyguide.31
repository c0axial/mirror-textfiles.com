* WELCOME BACK

Happy New Year to all Skyguide readers!

* VH-NONE

Music channel VH-1 will now not launch until May, rather than February as had
been previously expected.

The revised launch date is likely to coincide with the scrambling of its
sister channel MTV as part of the Sky Multi-Channels package. The possiblity
of MTV also joining Filmnet's Multichoice Kaleidoscope package, along with
Discovery, CMT Europe, The Children's Channel and now The Family Channel, has
not been ruled out.

VH-1 is likely to use Astra transponder 15, leaving MTV with transponder 22.

* FURTHER DELAYS

Sky Sports 2 has now been officially put back until September 1994.

* IT'S BETTER TO TRAVEL

The Travel Channel is set to launch on February 1st on the Intelsat 601
(27.5'W) satellite. The service will initially be for cable operators only,
and will broadcast from noon to midnight. The service will broadcast in the
clear.

The channel has expressed a desire to broadcast on Astra 1D when it is
launched in September, and it now seems unlikely that it will attempt to buy
space on the existing Astra satellites. Currently the only time available is
the 6am to 7pm time on Transponder 24, vacated in September by The Children's
Channel.

* CONFUCIUS PROBABLY SAID SOMETHING ABOUT KEEPING ONE'S BIG MOUTH SHUT...

Gary Davey (deputy MD at Sky) has stepped in as Chairman of the now
Murdoch-owned Star TV following the mystery departure of existing chairman Jim
Griffiths.

Part of the problem may have been due to Mr Murdoch saying that Star TV could
encourage political change in the region. The Chinese Authorities were having
none of that, and promptly banned satellite dishes and foreign broadcasters,
thus denying Star the opportunity to cause any change at all in what was a
potentially lucrative market.

Star TV is now likely to concentrate its broadcasting towards India. In other
news, Rupert Murdoch has just bought a stake in the Indian satellite
broadcaster Zee TV.

* UPLINKS FOR ALL

Broadcasting to Europe could be cheaper than you think. The following message
was broadcast on Intelsat 601 recently:

* SORTED

Chinese News and Entertainment is now back on Astra Transponder 35 having
been off the air for a few days in December.

The problem was due to a disagreement between SES and The Family Channel, now
sorted out. A dispute is thought to have emerged over TFC sub-leasing the
airtime without SES's involvement. A similar problem occured last year when
Sky sub-leased evening downtime on Nickelodeon to TV Asia.

* HA HA HA HA HA!

The Family Channel has purchased 11 episodes of "Jeux Sans Frontieres", a
popular European game show that has not been seen on British Television for
twelve years. The BBC stopped screening the show in 1982.

The show went on, however, with Welsh broadcaster S4C taking the BBC's place.

Jeux Sans Frontieres, titled "It's a Knockout" for British Viewers, was
presented by Stuart Hall, who will re-narrate the episodes for The Family
Channel. The show will screen at 5pm UK Time on Sunday evenings.

* NOT ON SKY

Sky News presenter Stephen Cole has defected to CNN, to present "World News".
He will join Sonya Ruseler and Riz Khan on screen from February.

* EAGLES CIRCLING OVERHEAD...

German Broadcaster VOX may close shortly unless ratings improve. The channel,
originally intended to be Germany's third national channel has soaked up 300
million pounds of investment capital, but has achieved consistently poor
ratings.

The channel is now in a desperate struggle for survival, attemping to get
viewers at any cost. Over the months Vox has been screening sports events and
even adult movies in a last-ditch attempt to stay on air.

If (although according to some reports it is more a case of when) the channel
closes, it now seems certain that NBC Super Channel (apparently absolutely
desperate to get on Astra, in marked contrast to its previous management)
will take over the transponder. VOX itself took over the transponder when UK
Women's channel "Lifestyle" closed down, one year ago this month.

* AND SPEAKING OF WOMEN'S CHANNELS...

Latest ratings show that UK Living is currently reaching around one third of
the number of viewers that Lifestyle used to get. While some reports have
suggested that the channel is in trouble, this is unlikely while it is
receiving slightly under half a million pounds a month in subscription
revenue (as part of the Multi-Channels package) irrespective of whether
anyone is watching it or not.

* ARD PLUS!

ARD is currently transmitting PAL Plus testcards throughout the night, and on
Wednesday (January 12) will broadcast a black and white PAL Plus test film at
midnight CET. (11pm UK Time)

* THE CLOSING HEADLINES

Bravo has purchased all 136 episodes of cult series "The Avengers". Episodes
will screen at 8pm on Mondays from February.

Sky One has purchased all 255 episodes of "M*A*S*H". Episodes will screen
daily at 7.30pm from January 14th.

Deutsche Bundespost Telekom and SES have announced that they are to form a
partnership to develop digital equipment for television reception.

Trainer manufacturuer "Fila" will sponsor MTV Unplugged during 1994.

Charles Andrew, Senior product manager at Warner Home Video has been
appointed Marketing Manager of UK Gold.

"Ren and Stimpy" begins its UK transmissions on BBC2 on Monday, in the DEF II
6.25pm slot. Episodes will air weekly, and will also be repeated on Friday
nights.

Skyguide received no messages at all about a Faxed version of Skyguide, so we
can safely conclude there is no interest at all. :-)
