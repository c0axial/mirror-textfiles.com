* NOT QUITE THE EUROPEAN

Following the National Heritage Department's warning to TNT and the Cartoon
Network about not carrying the required 51% minimum quota of European
programming, the department has conducted an investigation into which other
satellite channels do not meet the requirement.

From all the channels broadcast from the UK, only three - Sky News, Sky
Sports, and The Children's Channel (thanks to its large quantity of home-made
programming and European cartoons) meet the minimum quota.

All other channels, the report says, fall below the quota. Sky's three movie
channels only broadcast 16% European programming, although Sky themselves
claim that the requirement only applies "where practicable" - and since 92% of
the films released in the UK are made outside Europe, it is not practical to
have a film channel devoting 50% of its output to the 8% of European films.

Notable omissions include Super Channel, once broadcasting a large quantity of
European programming, although not now that it has been taken over by NBC.

Also strangely absent from the list is Astra channel UK Gold - while the
channel has been known to show the occasional few shows from the USA and
Australia, the majority of its programming comes from Britain. Whether the
omission was an error on the part of the National Heritage Department has not
been made clear.

The report made no mention of whether any action would be taken against the
remaining broadcasters, although technically they are all violating European
broadcasting rules.

Another channel potentially breaking EC rules is QVC. Broadcasting directives
state that teleshopping output may not exceed one hour per day, unless the
broadcast is restricted to just one member state. QVC technically broadcasts
to two states - the UK and Eire.

The ITC has decided that the rules do not apply to QVC, but the possibility of
EC officials making representations to the Government has not been ruled out.

* ASTRA BACKUP

Some Astra 1A channels may have to move to backup transponders on Astra 1C,
owing to the Astra 1A satellite "overheating".

First to move is the film channel Teleclub, and other channels may also make
the voyage if this does not solve the problem.

Viewers should notice no difference, although there may be a slight
improvement in signal strength in some regions. While the channels concerned
will be broadcasting on Astra 1C, the original Astra 1A frequency will be
used, therefore no re-tuning will be necessary.

The Astra 1C satellite has an extra group of backup transponders (in addition
to the standard 18) which can be brought into service to replace any Astra 1A
or 1B channel.

* GALAVISION COMPLAINTS

The Independent Television Commission is currently investigating one of the
new Astra 1C channels, Galavision.

A number of complaints have been received about the channel, largely centred
around the channel's regular screening of live bullfighting. Complaints have
also been received that the channel shows cigarette advertising, which (on TV)
is illegal in Europe.

Galavision was removed from UK Cable networks in the past for the
bullfighting, but now that anyone with an Astra dish can see the channel, it
has caused fresh concern.

While Galavision originates in Mexico, the channel is uplinked onto the Astra
satellite by SES in Betzdorf, Luxembourg, and must therefore meet European
broadcasting requirements.

* TOLD YOU SO

As predicted in an earlier Skyguide, Chinese News Europe has launched on Astra
on The Family Channel's Astra transponder.

The service, previously broadcast overnight on Superchannel, has changed its
name to Chinese News and Entertainment, and will broadcast from 1am to 3am
daily, with an 8 to 10 hour service planned for next year.

* STILL NO BT

Latest figures from the ITC show that cable television operators across the UK
installed 55,000 telephone lines in the last three months of 1992.

The total number of cable telephone lines now in use across the UK is just
under a quarter of a million.

* TCC IN TROUBLE

A recent advertisment for The Children's Channel has been rapped by the
Advertising Standards Authority. The advertisment, which urged children who
couldn't receive TCC to complain to their parents, fell foul of the UK's
advertising rules. Children's advertising is not permitted to urge children to
ask their parents to buy or obtain any product or service.

The Children's Channel claimed that the commercial was tongue in cheek, but
the ASA rejected this.

* THE DEAL IS SIGNED (AT LAST)

UK Gold has finally signed a deal with Equity, the actors union, allowing it
to broadcast programmes from Thames' film subsidiary, Euston Films.

Capital City, The Sweeney and Minder will begin screening early in 1994.

* TV BRIEFLY

Sky claim that the launch of Multi-Channels has set off a surge in satellite
dish sales. Sales of over 160,000 for November and December are forecast.

Thames Television has sold animation company Cosgrove Hall, producers of
Dangermouse and Count Duckula, amongst others. The new company will be 25%
owned by Cosgrove-Hall, with the remaining 75% shared between Anglia
Television in the UK, and US broadcaster Home Box Office.

The Family Channel begins a three-month run of a new series, Family
Catchphrase, in January. It is likely that this show may also be sold to the
ITV Network for later screening.

Also starting in January on the Family Channel are two TVS productions,
Perfect Scoundrels and C.A.T.S. Eyes.

Sky Television has taken the unusual step of announcing that the next change
to the Videocrypt scrambling to invalidate pirate cards will be at 13:30 UK
Time on December 6th.

A survey by UK Living reveals that up to 30% of satellite homes have not tuned
their receivers to the channel.

Sky has sold the second Marco Polo statellite for an undisclosed sum to an
undisclosed buyer.
