* WELCOME!

Welcome to our new readers joining us on the Minitel service.

Skyguide is now translated into the French language and made available on
Minitel in 3615 SURPIN thanks to the efforts of Joel Wirsztel. Our thanks
to him.

* MORE WIDESCREEN

Broadcasters covering the Winter Olympics this year will have access to
widescreen pictures if they want them.

Widescreen and digital broadcasts from the Winter Olympics will be co-ordinated
by HD Thames, a facilities house owned by Thames Television in London.

A number of channels have expressed interest in the broadcasts, inclding
the German broadcaster ARD, Dutch MAC channel TV Plus, and France
Supervision.

* MORE GOLD

UK Gold, currently receiving impressive ratings with its repeats of 1970s
editions of "Top Of The Pops" has purchased another 30 shows from the BBC.

* SKY SHUFFLE

Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of the UK's downmarket tabloid newspaper "The Sun"
has left the paper after 12 years to become Managing Director of Sky
Television.

David Chance has been made Deputy Manging Director, and was previously head
of marketing.

David Hill, Sky's head of Sport, moves to America to oversee News
Corporation's Sports coverage via the American Fox Network.

* MUCH MORE MUSIC

Thorn EMI is currently in negotiation with Sony and other music companies
with a view to setting up another music television channel on satellite.

This follows the successful launch of "Viva", a music service which is
currently taking on MTV in Germany, its most profitable area of Europe.

Viva can be found on the Eutelsat 2F1 satellite at 13 degrees East on
11.006H, where MTV Europe also recently took a transponder (11.658V) in
what appeared to be an attempt to minimise the potential threat of the
channel.

* THE SEARCH CONTINUES

The search goes on for an owner for the 6am - 7pm (GMT) downtime on Astra
Transponder 24, home of JSTV in the evening hours.

One possible occupant for the time has been rumoured as Chinese News and
Entertainment, currently broadcasting in the small hours of the morning on
Astra Transponder 35 when The Family Channel closes down for the night.

A spokesman for the channel denied the rumours, and said that they were
"second in line" for the space.

Still a strong possibility for being first in line would appear to be The
Travel Channel, which has successfully launched on Intelsat 601 at 27.5W,
11.175 H.

Meanwhile, reports of another Chinese channel have reached us. Named "The
Chinese Channel", it intends to launch on February 13th - Chinese New Year.

In the reports, the channel claim it will launch on "one of Sky's
transponders" and broadcast from midnight until 6am in the clear. Details
of which transponder would be used were not available, although the only
potential candidate would be Sky Movies Gold.

While TV Asia currently occupies the time in question, during that time the
channel is also broadcast on the Nickelodeon Transponder, leaving the door
open for TV Asia to relinquish the space without loss of transmission hours.

* FREE MOVIES DELAYED

Sky's three movie channels were to have a free weekend this weekend in a
bid to encourage people to subscribe to the movie channels.

The free weekend, touted as a "clear" weekend in some reports, was likely
to be broadcast to existing Sky Multichannel subscribers only - some
400,000 homes.

The weekend was, however, postponed. It is thought that several major movie
companies objected to their blockbuster movies being screened in such a
fashion. This is not the first time that movie company objections have
caused trouble for Sky's free weekends - several major movies had to be
dropped from the schedules during the last free weekend due to similar
disputes.

It is understood that Sky will attempt another free weekend in April.

* NICK DELAYED

Nick At Nite, the companion channel to Nickelodeon, has been delayed until
later this year. It is understood that the problem centres around the
availability of programming, since a number of series it intended to show
have been sold to other Multi-channel broadcasters and UK terrestrial
channels.

Sky have not officially confirmed the delay.

* SPLASHDOWN

Eutelsat 2F5 and Turksat 1 were destroyed on January 24th when the Ariane
rocket launching them crashed into the sea.

The problem could cause delays for subsequent satellite launches. Turksat
2 was scheduled for a June launch, and there is concern that the August
launch of Astra 1D could be delayed for as much as six months.

* SCI-FI IS BACK

The Sci-Fi Channel is currently talking to Sky, Eutelsat, and a number of
UK cable operators with an intention of launching in Britain later this
year.

The channel, which was set to join the Multi-Channel package last September
until it could not secure a suitable transponder rental agreement, could
now launch on Eutelsat for UK Cable viewers until suitable space becomes
available on Astra.

* RADIO RADIO

All six of the BBC's national radio networks are now available to Astra
listeners in Europe.

Radio 1, the pop and rock station, previously broadcast in Mono on UK Gold
(Tp23), has moved to UK Living (Tp34) on the higher-powered Astra 1C
satellite, and now broadcasts in stereo on the 7.38 and 7.56 Mhz
subcarriers.

Radio 3, the BBC's classical music station has commenced broadcasts, also
on the UK Living transponder on the 7.74 and 7.92 Mhz subcarriers.

Radio 2, a soft easy listening music channel for older people, will shortly
take up the mono subcarrier on UK Gold where Radio 1 had been. (7.74 Mhz)

Radio 4, 5, and BBC World Service are also available in Mono on the
existing UK Gold audio subcarriers. (7.56, 7.92 and 7.38 Mhz respectively)

* HOT PINK

Reports have been circulating which suggest that Red Hot Television,
currently broadcasting on the comparatively new Eutelsat 2F6 satellite at
16 degrees East (10.987 H) have shelved plans to launch a Gay service.

Expected to broadcast three days a week (probably on the days which RHTV
itself does not broacast), the channel is reported to have been dropped
because RHTV were concerned about "sadomasochistic and violent aspects of
gay culture".

The authenticity of these reports, however, cannot be confirmed. The
channel, if it had ever intended to launch at all, is unlikely to have
shelved such a potentially lucrative idea for such a bogus reason.

* NEW VIEWERS FOR NBC SUPER

Some lucky Astra viewers in the UK found themselves deprived of their normal
selection of channels as high winds blew their Astra dishes out of
alignment this week.

In some cases, the movement of the dish has been enough to enable affected
viewers to pick up the Eutelsat 2F3 satellite at 13 degrees East, enabling
them to at least be consoled by NBC Super Channel, Viva, and the occasional
feed for ITV Sport.
