* NEW FOR NICK

Nickelodeon is making deals with a number of independent producers for
original programming for the station, including a music series and a drama
series about ghost stories.

Amongst the parties concerned are Ardent Productions, (owned by Prince Edward)
and Initial Films and Television, a large independent producer that has
contributed much work to Channel 4.

Rumours also suggest that some UK involvement with the game show 'Guts' is
soon to occur. While there is a slim possibility that Nickelodeon may produce
its own UK version of the show, it is more likely to take a number of British
children across to the show's American home in Florida.

Ren and Stimpy, a 'Nicktoon' not yet seen on Nickelodeon, although broadcast
in the UK by BBC2, will also come to the station. The previous agreement had
been that the BBC would have rights to the show for two years, but rights to
screen the series after the BBC showings end have been secured.

* OLD RUMOURS DIE HARD

A fresh round of speculation has begun involving Sky's subscriber centre at
Livingston, Scotland. There have been a number of rumours that the centre is,
or will be, equipped with CLI - 'Caller Line Identification', or Caller ID as
it is known.

This will enable Sky to pinpoint exactly where in the country a caller is
dialling from, which will make card fraud more difficult, and prevent
international callers from upgrading legal cards which have found their way
abroad.

Such rumours have had currency for a long time, although they have been
primarily centred on Sky's ability to detect international calls - something
which is possible without CLI just by listening to the quality of the line.

* MULTICHANNELS 2

It has been reported that Sky may be intending to launch a second
Multichannels package on the Astra 1D satellite.

It is understood that Sky is currently negotiating with SES to purchase all
available transponders on Astra 1D, in some cases in partnership with other
broadcasters in Europe.

Such a package would be likely to encourage existing viewers to upgrade their
equipment to receive Astra 1D. Currently, the large majority of satellite
systems in use in the UK are not equipped to receive Astra 1C without
extensive modification, if at all.

Potential names for the new package could include some channels rumoured for
the first package, namely The Sci-Fi Channel and The Family Channel, existing
members of Multichannels seeking a full transponder (CMT Europe), as well as
other channels yet to be announced. There is also a distinct possibility that
Eurosport may join the package.

The pricing of the package, if it is launched, is not yet known, although the
possibility of it being made available to existing subscribers for a small
charge, or even no charge, cannot be ruled out.

* ONE BILLION!

Sky's three movie channels and Sky Sports will be softscrambled this weekend.
The weekend is called "The Billion Dollar Preview Weekend", and will be hosted
by Gaby Roslin, co-host of Channel 4's "The Big Breakfast"

Films that will be seen include Alien 3, Lethal Weapon 3, Star Trek 6, Wayne's
World, The Addams Family, Hook, and Basic Instinct.

* FACING THE MUSIC

Ice skaters Torvill and Dean have been signed up by Sky in a long-term
commitment to feature in advertising and promotions for the satellite
broadcaster. The skaters will receive 150,000 pounds each.

Torvill and Dean are spearheading the new Sky 30 day home trial campaign,
understood to have been christened "Project Y" by Sky insiders.

'Project X' was launched shortly after Sky began broadcasting, and allowed
viewers to rent a Sky satellite dish and the movie channel for under five
pounds a week. The campaign then was a success for Sky, fuelling the then
almost non-existent dish market.

The new home trial offer is a no-obligation installation of a Sky dish,
decoder, and all Sky premium channels, including Multichannels, for 30 days.
At the end of the home trial, viewers then have the option of purchasing the
satellite system from their local retailer [Project X infuriated satellite
dealers by completely bypassing them], or to have the dish removed at no cost.

The campaign is likely to boost dish ownership, and hopefully compensate for
the large number of satellite viewers who are completely giving up their
dishes. It is estimated that some 200,000 viewers de-installed their dishes
last year - thought to be as a result of the Sky Multi-channel package.

* NEW ARRIVALS

Game show 'Blockbusters' begins screening on Sky One from April 18th.

David Letterman's top-rated American chat show also come to Sky One on the
same day. The show will air daily at 11pm UK Time, less than 24 hours after
the show's transmission in the USA.

Viewers who missed the Season 4 screenings of Star Trek: The Next Generation,
or who want to see the series without commercial breaks, will be able to see
re-runs of the show on BBC2 from Wednesday April 13th.

* SCRAMBLE!

Sky viewers can expect new viewing cards over the next few months. Sky is
slowly introducing Series 9 smartcards in an effort to beat the flood of
pirate cards that are now becoming widely available. A number of pirate card
manufacturers are attempting to dump their existing stocks onto the market at
discount prices, in some cases reported to be as low as 35 pounds.

The cards, like their Series 7 counterparts, will contain pay-per-view
programming.

* SKY DISCOVERS DOCUMENTARIES

Sky has commissioned three documentary programmes for Sky One, in a ground-
breaking move for the channel.

The subjects are somewhat tabloidish, namely a documentary about Jack the
Ripper, Stephen Waldorf (a man who was shot by policemen in 1984 when he was
mistaken for a terrorist), and a feature on Terry Venables, which will be
produced by Chrysalis Television.

* EC ATTACKS BRITISH BROADCASTING

The European Commission has announced that it is going to take legal action
against the British Government.

Central to the dispute is that many channels broadcast via satellite from the
UK do not meet the required 51% quota of European-sourced programming which
is required under EC Broadcasting rules.

While this rule had been effectively ignored by many broadcasters across
Europe for several years, the point has been brought to the fore again largely
due to the French Government, lobbied by French broadcasters such as Canal
Plus.

As reported in previous editions of Skyguide, the problem revolves around TNT
and The Cartoon Network. The French authorities are furious that the channel
is allowed to broadcast in the French language without governmental controls.
When the authorities approached TNT and asked it to cease broadcasting in
French, it refused. The current situation is largely as a result of this
dispute, in an attempt to prevent the channel broadcasting in French, by way
of it being forced to stop broadcasting entirely.

Satellite broadcasters in France, such as the Canal Plus empire, have been
keen to keep French programming on French satellites. By way of an example,
the French language soundtrack for Eurosport was removed some time ago, and
now if you want to watch Eurosport in French, you can only do so on the
Telecom satellites inhabited by other French channels.

* BROADCASTING ON BORROWED TIME

German channel 'Vox' is now likely to close within weeks, if not days, after
its major shareholders all pulled out of the channel.

230 of Vox's 290 staff have now left the station, and the remaining staff of
60 intend to keep the channel running for as long as they can.

When Vox does cease, the transponder will revert to its original owners,
European Television Networks (ETN), owners of the defunct Lifestyle and
Screensport channels. It is thought that they will have no trouble selling the
transponder space, and a prime favourite is NBC Superchannel, now "desperate"
for space on Astra.
