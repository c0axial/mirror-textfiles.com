* EVERYONE MAKES MISTAKES!

A quick note to correct two glaring errors in the most recent Skyguide:

1) In the "MONEY" Item, the company expected to make a profit is BSkyB.

2) Thor is not at 8 degrees east, it is at ZERO point eight degrees west.
   Consequently there is no danger at all of any interference from
   Sirius!

Apologies for mistake 1) which was the result of bad editing, and for mistake
2) which was a result of me lifting someone else's material without checking
it. :-)

Thanks to everyone who pointed the mistakes out. (Both of you!)
