Only one story this week, so I might as well bring you that today instead
of waiting for Friday...

* SCOTT CHISHOLM FIRED

Scott Chisholm was today fired from Sky News following an alleged incident
yesterday involving co-presenter Chris Mann.

Chris Mann was taken to hospital in November last year after he was
attacked by Chisholm, who claimed that Mann had been rude to his wife on
the telephone. (See bskyb/sky_news, message #2)

At the time, Chisholm was suspended for 14 days, however a further incident
occured yesterday during a break in "Live at Five". According to staff,
Chisholm launched a flood of abuse at Mann, who was with his wife (fellow
Sky News presenter Stephanie Callister) at the time.

The root of the disagreement appears to have been an interview with
Chisholm in Sunday World, an Irish newspaper, regarding his private life.
Chisholm accused Mann of tipping off the London Evening Standard about the
interview, which contained a number of obscenities, among which the quote
"I still have to dress like a f*cking bank clerk, but it doesn't mean I
have to act like one."

The race is now on to find a presenter to host Sky World News Tonight with
Selina Scott.
