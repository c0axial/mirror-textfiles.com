HAROLD NOTEBOOK
By HAL PHILLIPS

PORTLAND, Maine - A decade of inveterate smoking came to an end (in 
theory) on Sept. 12, my 30th birthday. I didn't want to quit, so my 
plan was to tell everyone I knew about my proposed secession, thereby 
making it impossible to weasel out. 

The first week went very well, while the second - which included a 
wedding (see below) - set me back a few steps. The bottom line is 
this: When sober, I show amazing resilience. When buzzed, especially 
via the demon weed, I have more trouble. 

I have, however, made significant progress. As the Herald went to 
press, I have smoked six cigarettes in two weeks - none in my car, 
none on the golf course, none after dinner, none in the morning with 
coffee.

Health Care Addendum: Why is that Americans squeal like stuck pigs 
when they're wronged by some government agency but shrug their 
shoulders when they're debauched by all manner of private-sector 
entities? Why do we decry government-run health care bureaucracy and 
accept an insurance bureaucracy that couldn't be slower, couldn't be 
less responsive, and couldn't be more expensive.?

Is there such a thing as too much faith in the free market?

(Is there a rule about consecutive interrogative sentences? Oops, I've 
done it again!)

And what about fucking Phil Gramm (Dink-Texas), who doesn't understand 
that he hasn't a the slightest chance at the GOP nomination. I heard 
him on C-Span the other day, railing about government intervention 
with regard to health care.

"My mother, back in Texas, doesn't want the government messing with 
her health care," drawled the balding, hypocritical toady. "She want's 
government out of her life!"

Thanks to the New York Times, I learned that Phil omitted an important 
aspect of his argument - namely, the Medicare payments his mother 
receives each month.

Living/Arts Editor Alex Beam, who writes a column for the Globe in his 
spare time, has asked for some assistance from Herald readers. Seems 
Beam is planning a column on "cars that look like suppositories." Beam 
can be reached at the Big House on Morrissey Boulevard, 617-929-2800.

I've been to three weddings since publication of the last Herald: Tim 
Dibble and the former Maureen Holland in Hingham, Mass.; David Kett 
and Beth Jordan in St. Paul, Minn.; and Jim O'Reilly and the former 
Kris Kelleher in Harvard, Mass. All three women, to their credit, said 
"I do" or the like without any prompting or prodding.

All three were very enjoyable affairs. But when it came to pure 
decadence, all paled in comparison to their respective bachelor 
parties. Dibble's shindig has already been documented in this space 
(August '94), but Kettle's and O'Reilly's both deserve mention.

Kett's bachelor party involved a trip to a St. Paul Saints baseball 
game (see related story), followed by a trip to "The Saloon," a gay 
disco bar where we met up with the simultaneously partying 
bachelorettes. Somewhere in between the ballgame and gay bar, the 
groom - a long-time friend from Wellesley, Mass. - was hijacked and 
taken to a strip bar that looked like a diner. 

O'Reilly's bash was a two-day affair that began with a pub crawl in 
Billerica, Mass. and ended with a Winnebago trip to the Foxwoods 
Casino in Ledyard, Conn. So bored was Jim by the goings-on at Max II's 
(a strip bar known in newspapers circles as the Billerica Performing 
Arts Center), he slept - arms folded, chin on chest - throughout our 
two-hour stay. Jim's high moral character, personified by his sleepy 
indifference, was aided by double-digit drink totals, among other 
vices.

***

We're Famous, Part II: I received a curious spate of subscription 
requests early in September. We had not published since mid-August 
nor, to my knowledge, had we received any press coverage. Turns out 
the New England Newspaper Association (NENA) Bulletin mentioned the 
Herald in its September issue. 

This may not seem like much to you, gentle reader. But NENA is big-
time! Papers like the Marlboro Enterprise and Town Crier (where I 
toiled) belonged to the piddling New England Press Association, while 
the Boston Globe, Hartford Courant and, apparently, the Portland 
Press-Herald belong to NENA. 

The NENA Bulletin basically ran a brief on the Herald, lifting a few 
sentences from Ray Routhier's Press-Herald feature. Did they get your 
permission, Ray?

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to do a few impressions 
for you tonight. Are you ready... Who am I now?

"I remember that... I remember that... I remember that... I remember 
that..."

I'm a Baby Boomer watching "Forrest Gump."

KEN BURNS:NO BALLS, BUT NO STRIKES
By HAL PHILLIPS

We can't let Ken Burns scurry off to his next film project without 
comment on his celebrated, nine-inning series, "Baseball," which just 
concluded on Public Broadcasting. 

Anyone familiar with Burns' documentary work - "The Brooklyn Bridge", 
"The Civil War" - has come to realize two things: He's got really bad 
hair sense and an obsession with exploring the American sense of self 
via historical circumstance.

After plowing through the country's Civil War years, Burns' 
concentration on the game of baseball may seem an inconsequential 
choice. But with his latest documentary, the filmmaker painstakingly 
depicts the Grand Ol' Game as a full-length mirror to American 
culture. Certainly, the question of race in this country is well 
reflected by baseball's 19th-century experimentation with integration 
and eventual regression into complete segregation. 

But did Jackie Robinson's Major League emergence in 1947 somehow 
reflect America's pangs of conscience? Did he pave the way for Brown 
vs. Board of Education and the impending Civil Rights movement? 

Ken Burns would answer these queries thusly: "Those are interesting, 
crucial questions with which Americans continue to struggle..."

And when does this reflection go too far? Did baseball in the 1920s - 
with its unprecedented emphasis on the home run - mirror an America 
hell bent on self-indulgence and immediate gratification.?

I say, that's a stretch. But you'll never get an answer from Burns. 

I admire and enjoy Mr. Burns' work more than any documentarian on 
earth, but his scholarship is very safe. I've seen him speak several 
times and he pointedly refuses to offer his own opinions on subjects 
in which he is fantastically versed.

Let me be clear: In his documentary work, Burns is fanatically 
scrupulous when it comes to spelling out both sides of an argument. 
However, when pressed for an opinion, he damn near refuses to come 
down on either side. And who better to offer an informed opinion than 
someone so objective?

"Mr. Burns, do you think it fair that Abraham Lincoln be so closely 
associated with the freeing of slaves when he favored the post-war 
black colonization of Africa and resisted emancipation for as long as 
it remained politically practical?"

Burns would answer, "We, as a country, are still struggling with this 
troubling dual image of Lincoln as emancipator and political 
opportunist. Somewhere on the fault line lies the truth..."

"Mr. Burns, do you think Major League Baseball deserves its anti-trust 
exemption?"

"Well, as a nation, we continue to struggle with this question, 
pulled, as we are, in two directions: Toward the sanctity of 
tradition. and fairness in the marketplace. Somewhere in the grey area 
lies the answer.."

And so it goes.

***

There is no denying that 20th-century baseball also mirrors the 
country's on-going labor struggles. And though Burns would never say 
so in public, I will: The anti-trust exemption for Major League 
Baseball is a disgrace. The 1994 strike is merely the most recent 
example. 

Unfortunately, while now would be the ideal time to challenge the 
exemption in court (which Major League Baseball Players Association 
Executive Director Don Fehr has said he would do), Fehr is not the man 
to do it. 

Anyone who would dare challenge the national pasttime must be 
extremely clever, media savvy and, most important, likeable. The 
potential fallout from removing the exemption is enormous. An entire 
nation would require soothing reassurance that baseball would not 
disintegrate and reform as something altogether alien. Fehr - an icy, 
humorless attorney - could never provide that type of security.

Marvin Miller, Fehr's mentor and predecessor, was perfectly suited to 
this task. But it appears Miller was born too early.

***

Getting back to the baseball documentary: I enjoyed it, but not nearly 
so much as Burns' Civil War series. Both are stylish and hugely 
informative, but for me, 95 percent of "Baseball" was rehash whereas 
"The Civil War" was chock full of fascinating minutiae. 

To be fair, this is more a commentary on me than Burns. Fact is, I 
know more about the history of baseball than my country's seminal 
civil disturbance. 

Most people do, I'm afraid. Right or wrong, there are more baseball 
stat freaks than Civil War scholars.

MARKING THE BIRTH OF A NATHAN
By HAL PHILLIPS

TOWSON, Md. - Nathan Phillip Kahla, my first nephew, was born Aug. 28, 
to sister Janet and her husband, Paul Kahla. 

The dark-haired boy weighed in at a whopping 9 lbs. 13 oz., and 
measured 22 inches. Anyone who's met my sister can appreciate the 
dimensions at play here. Janet is 5'1" and wears a size 4... no 
cesarean required. What a trooper!

Both mother and son came through famously and, at four weeks, Nathan 
was sleeping virtually through the night. Indeed, the awards continue 
to roll in. At a recent reunion of the Kahlas' birthing class, our boy 
captured first prize for biggest and newest baby!

During a recent phone interview with Janet, Nathan woke up and started 
to wail.

"He cries a lot," the new mother explained. "But I guess babies do 
that. That's what they tell me, anyway."

It was discovered that our boy had a wet bum, so his mom - who can 
change a car's oil without removing the portable phone from her 
shoulder - proceeded to service young Nathan. Suddenly, she burst out 
laughing.

"Oh wow, Nathan just had a bowel movement!" she howled. "We always 
take off his socks because he always puts his feet right into the 
dirty part of the diaper."

"Did you ever think you'd laugh so hard at defecation?" I asked my 
sister.

"No, I didn't," she said. "Oh, he did it again! He also has little 
erections. Little baby erections. They're so cute!"

Reports out of Towson indicate Nathan to be the cutest freakin' baby 
on Earth. Paul insists the baby is "extra cute." 

Consistent with his Phillipsian stature, particularly at birth, Nathan 
has also displayed signs of the family appetite. He eats a good deal 
of the time.

However, when my parents (Gramma and Grampa Phillips) were in town for 
a visit, Nathan was sucking away on his bottle, only to stop and 
breath before resuming. 

"Well, I guess he likes to breath between bites," Gramps observed off-
handedly. 

"Well, I guess he doesn't have the Phillips appetite," Janet observed.

The lovely Sharon Vandermay and I plan to visit the newest family 
edition the weekend of Oct. 8 and 9. I'm excited but Sharon is beside 
herself with gleeful anticipation. 

Until then, we have to rely on observations from Nathan's mom, who has 
taken this motherhood thing in stride. 

"His crying, I thought, would really get on my nerves," she explained. 
"But that doesn't seem to be the case. I'm much more patient than I 
thought I would be. 

"You can see him changing every day. We have this developmentally 
correct poster, all black and white, near his crib. For the first 
three weeks or so, he had no interest in it whatsoever. Now he stares 
intently at it, constantly. Once he started showing an interest in 
that, I started with the rattle. No interest. But yesterday, I brought 
it back out and he follows it all around. He'll hear the rattly sound 
and look around for it.

"They say that kids can recognize faces immediately. They love to look 
at mirrors. They probably don't realize it's them, but I have two 
mirrors in his crib: A three-way and convex. He likes the three-way 
mirror. It has red, black and white borders. Red is the first color 
they see. Then they move on to cool colors.

"They practice facial expressions, but he doesn't really know what it 
means. He'll grin as he falls off to sleep. It's the cutest thing 
you've ever seen."

                         /-/  \-\

MEETING RAOUL
By Dr. DAVID ROSE

It was Friday morning, around 4 a.m. or thereabouts when the phone 
rang.  I had just completed some very satisfactory Rapid Eye Movement 
and was settling into a dream in which I was appearing as a special 
guest on the Lawrence Welk Show. Normally, I would have unplugged the 
phone and rolled over for several hundred additional winks, but I was 
groggy and was momentarily confused by the simultaneous disappearance 
of Myron Floren and Arthur Duncan. In my compromised state, and 
against my better judgment, I picked it up.

It was him again, I should have figured. Whenever he gives a big 
speech he gets all keyed up and can't sleep. Then he lies in bed, 
staring at the ceiling and turning things over in his mind until he 
gets so confused and worked up that he has to call me. It wasn't the 
first time, and it wouldn't be the last. My wife Pen was still 
sleeping, so I slipped out of bed and took it on the extension in the 
kitchen.

"Bill, what the hell? It's four o'clock, I've got work tomorrow..."

"Ah know, Dave, Ah feel your pain. But Ah need your help; it's the 
Haiti thing. Things aren't working out like we planned."

"WE? What's this we shit? Don't try to pin this on me. Gays in the 
Military, okay, that was my baby. But I tried to tell you from the 
start that Haiti was a mistake.  And no offense, Bill, but the speech 
was weak. What did I tell you? Sincerity and resolve, sincerity and 
resolve, we went over it about 50 times! You couldn't even look into 
the camera."

	"Well, Ah thought it went pretty well. 
Your.....time.....is.....Up; I counted 'Mississippi' just like we 
practiced. And Ah didn't do that Mike-Dukakis-bent-finger thing once. 
Ah used graphic descriptions of the brutal human rights abuses 
committed by the Haitian military to appeal to America's innate sense 
of justice, thus focusing the country's attention like a laser beam on 
the suffering of their brothers to the South and a little bit to the 
East, or, in the case of the New England states, their brothers just 
to the South... and in some cases actually a little bit to the West."

"Uh, very stirring. But you've got to remember, Bill, the Haitians are 
three time losers as far as Middle America is concerned: They're 
black, they're poor, and, as if that wasn't enough, they speak French 
for Christ's sake. 

"Actually, most speak Creole..."

"Great, when the campaign bus is swinging through Idaho next year 
start speaking Creole out on the hustings and watch how it whips Ma 
and Pa Kettle into a frenzy. People couldn't care less, the fucking 
Simpson trial is coming up. "

"Did you know we don't have Court TV in the White House? Ah know the 
trial falls under the purview of the judicial branch, but as Chief 
Executive Ah feel a need to keep informed..."

"Bill, let's stick to the business at hand, shall we? Look, a Haiti 
invasion is a no-win situation. If things go smoothly, a lot of people 
will die and you'll achieve a military objective that no one cares 
about. If things don't go so well, more people will die and you might 
achieve nothing. Either way, Bob Dole's got your balls in a sack."

"Ah know, Ah know. That's why I'm calling. Is there a way out, any way 
to get through to the military leaders?"

"Let's face it. The Cuban Missile Crisis approach isn't working; you 
gave it a shot, but you're no Jack Kennedy. Cedras thinks you're 
bluffing, and even if you weren't, he doesn't think you can get an 
invasion past Congress. I think it's time for some Good Cop/Bad Cop; 
you've done the bad cop part, now send in some good cops to tell 
Cedras that you're just crazy enough to do it - unless he makes nice."

"But who? Ah suppose we could send Dole or Gingrich* in to say that 
Congress won't stand in my way..."

"No, too dangerous; Dole or Gingrich would use it against you later. 
But I must admit that I like the idea of sending a bitter enemy, a 
right-wing ideologue whose neo-fascist views are so diametrically 
opposed to yours that Cedras will have to view him as I free agent... 
I know: Sam Nunn.

"Perfect! Now, we should also have someone who the coup leaders can 
identify with, someone with similar attributes and interests, who can 
win them over to our way of thinking. Hmmm....."

"Well, Colin Powell isn't poor, but he's black and he knows a lot 
about how to kill and dismember people; we'll give him some Berlitz 
tapes and he can learn Creole on the flight down."

"Brilliant! It's all coming together! Now, Ah know Ah can't go along, 
but Ah feel that Ah should send a sort of surrogate, someone who will 
represent me. Ah want the coup leaders to see first hand the type of 
man they're dealing with."

"Hmm. It's a thought, I suppose.  He should be a man of humble origins 
who, by struggling, has vastly improved his station in life. A sober 
and earnest man who nonetheless possesses a certain Southern charm. A 
Democrat, of course, and a man who has used his innate gifts of 
intelligence, industry, and devotion to public service to become a 
well-meaning and likable but maddeningly ineffectual president.  Hmm, 
that's going to be a little tougher, but we'll think of someone. 
Anyway, Bill, I'm beat. Give me a call early tomorrow and we'll work 
out the details. And you get some sleep, you've got a big day ahead."

I hung up the phone and slipped back into bed. As I drifted off, I 
remembered that I had meant to tell Bill to instruct his negotiators 
not to piss away their advantage in negotiations and make unreasonable 
concessions to the Haitian military, resulting in an agreement which 
achieved few of his original objectives, forced him into an uneasy and 
unseemly alliance with the men he had just characterized in a national 
address as thugs and savages, and launched a military operation with 
questionable goals and ill-defined rules of engagement that could turn 
into a quagmire that would make Somalia look like a day at the beach. 
Sure, it seemed obvious, but you can't leave anything to chance with 
this guy. 

No matter, I thought; I could still tell him in the morning... as long 
as I didn't oversleep.

(* When the sirname "Gingrich" is run through the spell-check, its 
nearest relative is, appropriately, "jingoish." While the sirname Dole 
is a legitimate word and shouldn't be checked, my spell-checker stops 
on it and suggests "fucking obstructionist prick". - Ed.)

			LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Dear Harold:

       Thank you (I think) for assigning me to cover the story of your 
demise, which I'm sure will be untimely and regretted by all. At the 
risk of sounding morbid, I would like to start preparing the shell of 
your obituary now. 

       I'm toying with the following lead: "What can you say about a 
X-year-old boy who died? That he loved beer and debauchery? That he 
once loved a vacuum cleaner?"

       As you can see, it is a little thin. You could help me out by 
requesting fond memories, quips, and other personal anecdotes from 
your subscriber list, many of whom purport to be your friends. 

     Thank you for your help. I look forward to editing your sordid 
past.

 Cordially, 

    Alison Harris 

Cumberland, Maine

Ed. - My admirers are legion and easily accessible. However, for an 
alternative view, might I suggest Jim Magonigle, a fellow Wesleyan 
grad hell-bent on beating me to a pulp. Seems I insulted his 
fraternity house, Chi Psi, sometime during my junior year. This got 
back to him and he took it personally - very personally. Every time I 
run into him, he's drunk, has a crazed look in his eye and threatens 
my well-being. Also, you may want to contact my ex-fiancee Stephanie, 
who has a pathological aversion to unpleasantness. So while she 
probably has plenty of nasty things to say, Stephanie has by now 
blotted them fro her memory or attributed them to my drug use. Either 
way, if pressed, she'd probably fabricate something nice to avoid the 
slightest hint of negativity. 

Dear Hal,

Your Aunt Anne and I were some excited to hear you was going to spoken 
of on the front page of the newspaper. I had lots of folks promise to 
save their copies. We was then real disappointed to buy the paper that 
week and you wasn't in it, not just not on the front page but 
nowheres!

When we spoke to you about it you said you had meant you was going to 
be in one of them Boston or Portland papers! Course that don't count 
for much around here. If it's not in the Ellsworth-American it hasn't 
really happened. I was in some pickle with all them folks that bought 
extry Ellsworth-Americans and was out two dollar and fifteen cent 
compensating them. 

I showed them your newsletter to better explain the situation. But I 
don't know but what that didn't make it worse! Effie Beals said if you 
got such a swelled head from being in one of them Boston papers no-
one's every heard of she'd hate to think how big an ego you'd have if 
you had been in the Ellsworth American!

And Clyde Oldstrop said mebbe you was turning out like the Newman boy, 
Paul I think his name was, who left here to got to California and be 
an actor, or some such foolishness. Last we heard he was trying to 
sell salad dressing! Now if he'd a stayed here and worked for his 
Uncle Jarvis in the family boatyard down to Southwest Harbor he could 
of been somebody!

Well, Hal, I hope you'll take a lesson from this sorry episode and 
settle down. I sure could use some help getting in the rutabagas this 
fall. Looks like a bumper crop in spite of all the dry weather we've 
had. I'm sure folks'ud forget about all this foolishness of yours in a 
few years. Your Aunt Anne says to tell you she still loves you 
regardless.

Uncle Chauncey [Bancroft]

Ellsworth, Maine

Ed. - Don't worry, Chauncey. I's still the same ol' humble cuss 
y'always knowd. Give my love back to Aunt Anne, and tell ol' Mrs. 
Beals she wouldn't know a swelled head if it poked her ample behind. 
Probably been 30, 40 years since she's seen one anyways.



Dear Hal:

As this letter concerns you, I assume that you will print it, if not 
in its original form. With the new-found popularity of your periodic 
tribute to self involvement, I'm compelled to share one of my father's 
favorite expressions. 

Fool's names, like their faces
often appear in public places.

This ditty was most often recited about the graffiti found in public 
restrooms. Although your newsletter offers more clever turn-of-phrase 
than most restroom graffiti, I think it applies quite nicely to the 
recent spill of exposure we've seen for you and the Herald.

My father is a wise man. Never famous, but wise.

Sincerely,

Chris Crocker,

Yarmouth, Maine

Ed. - Your father was, I'm sure, a very wise man; certainly too wise 
to misplace the possessive apostrophe in the ditty's first line. I'll 
assume that was your error and, because you're a publisher type, I'll 
let it go. But while we're on the subject of your parentage, I'm 
curious as to what your father thinks of that stud in your left ear.

Dear Hal,

Since I let my subscription to the Portland Press-Herald lapse, I have 
felt so out of touch. If I had read the article ["Personal journalist 
writes about what he knows - himself," Aug. 2), I would have sent 
roses and a bottle of Dom. Now that all the accolades have been 
pouring in and the ego tracking system has been recalibrated, my 
little trifles wouldn't be noticed. So I'll save the cash.

I'm sorry I haven't written sooner, but eight years in Hollywood and I 
can no longer than put original thoughts on the printed page... I am, 
however, a great fan and look forward to your fine journalism. 

Now, down to business. I hope the motion picture/television rights to 
your amazing life story and publication are still available. I know 
the weenie-boys from Hollywood must be swarming. But seeing as we are 
old friends, I assume I first dibs. As, I am leaving next week to 
produce the "New Adventures of Flipper" in Florida, I will be unable 
to come out and make the bid personally. But, I will have my business 
affairs guy call your agent and see if they can hammer out the broad 
points of a deal. Creatively I see a newspaper in the great outdoors, 
a "Murphy Brown/Northern Exposure" thing happening here. Five years on 
the nets and then straight to syndication. I know you've been thinking 
HBO, but trust me, the money's in the four networks. By the year 2000, 
you'll be able to buy that Winnebago they've been eyeing. The new one.

When  I get back from Florida, I'll send out the Goldwyn jet to pick 
you up. We'll do lunch, then take a meeting and get your creative 
thoughts. I hope you don't mind if we change the name of the paper.

Please call if you are making your calls personally these days. I just 
hate it when your secretary calls with the "I have Hal Phillips on the 
line... Oh, I'm sorry. He picked up another call... could you hold, 
it'll just be a minute."

Best wishes,

Dan Smith

Beverly Hills, Calif.

Ed. - The Goldwyn jet? Yes! I hope it has cable... 

Some may wonder if the "Flipper" reference is on the level. I assure 
you, it is. Smith made good use of his Wharton degree by further 
matriculating to Hollywood, where he toils as a real, live TV-movie 
producer. The above letter fell into the Herald letter bin following a 
fax cover bearing the show's befinned logo. It's nice to see Mr. 
Smith, having eschewed Washington for Beverly Hills, hasn't 
compromised his artistic integrity. Dan, don't go changin'.

Dear Hal (Resident Stud), 

The August Harold Herald had very little mention of Maine in its 
pages. More space is devoted to Massachusetts (yech) than our own 
beautiful state. 

Your are missing our on some important territory here, for I find the 
native Mainers to be friendly, generous and witty to boot. I was in 
Blue Hill last weekend and overheard the following conversation 
between two Mainers. They were discussing a canoeing trip one was 
planning to take down the St. Croix River. 

"In my AMC guidebook," one of them explained, "it says the river is 
loaded with class III and IV rapids."

Translation: Its is a difficult river with numerous strong rapids 
navigable only by experts.

"Ah no," said the other. "Girl Scouts go down it sideways."

Translation: It's a piece of cake. 

The full impact of this story is missed unless you know what the 
second guy looked like. He was fortyish, long-haired and bearded with 
buck teeth wearing a wet suit unzipped almost down to his waist, 
thereby displaying a full mane of chest hair. 

Get off your pompous soapbox, go out and talk to some real people.

Sincerely,

Paul Louis

Portland, Maine

Ed. - Indeed, the Herald pages are filled with references to the Bay 
State, while Maine receives little mention. This is consistent, 
however, with an editorial focus that concentrates on interesting 
things as opposed to piddling, irrelevant things; witty, urbane, 
studly Greater Bostonians rather than poorly groomed Mainers with 
prominent incisors and an obsession for young girls in green cotton 
dresses. It should be said this particular wet-suited pedophile shows 
a refreshing orthodoxy that stands in stark contrast to the amorous 
tendencies displayed by all too many of his fellow Pine Tree Staters.

THOSE BRITS SURE HAVE A WAY WITH CONGEALED FLESH
By TIM MONAGHAN
Cuisine and Religious Affairs Editor Pro Tem

Now that Hal has survived to the grand old age of 30, given up smoking 
and miraculously matured into a well-rounded human being overnight, I 
feel comfortable contributing to his award-winning gospel, safe in the 
knowledge that it must necessarily cease to be a rag and will now 
aspire to lofty heights of journalism, proselytizing or at least self-
aggrandizement. 

Hal's nativity is a matter for worldwide celebration. Even as I write, 
primitive Viking descendents in the farthest isles north of Scotland 
are scratching runic figures on ancient burial mounds to celebrate his 
invention of the modern sport of golf. In Singapore, a caning stroke 
has been named after his sand wedge swing to mark the day he strode 
from a 747 and told the natives: "Build golf courses and I will come." 
In Yucatan, scholars are only now linking the ruins at Chichen Itza 
and elaborate Aztec rituals with worship of Hal's ego, which stretches 
beyond his 20th-century existence to encompass all of space and time.

As the only former altar boy in the Western Hemisphere not sodomized 
by a priest, I too feel compelled to make some kind of burnt offering. 
But like the little drummer boy in that charming epic of popular 
music, I have nothing to offer save my limited skills. As I play 
Falstaff to King Hal, it is obvious my contribution should be of a 
gustatory nature. Therefore, I off the fabled Recipe for Hal's 
Birthday Brick, a rough, well seasoned pate I have adapted from 
European recipes for the rough, well seasoned Great Golf God. I am 
fond of this pate because it reminds me of the texture of Hal's brain. 
It tastes great and is simpler to create than an infant.

1 lb. lean ground beef
2 lb. bacon (use smoked for a stronger flavor)
8 oz. calf liver
2-4 cloves garlic, to taste
1/2 cup dry white wine
1 fl. oz. brandy
10 juniper berries (if you can't get hold of juniper berries, replace 
the brandy with gin)
15 black peppercorns
1 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. ground mace or nutmeg

1. Buy a food processor. I recommend Cuisinart, the best on the 
market. Unfortunately, they are also the most expensive. Okay, get a 
cheap knock-off, but by the largest capacity you can.

2. If you don't have a processor that can hold at least eight cups, 
divide the ingredients in half (or thirds if you've been really cheap 
and bought small) and repeat the following steps for each batch, 
thoroughly mixing them together at the end of the food processor 
section.

3. Using the metal chopping blade, grind the bacon and liver together 
until well mixed.

4. Crush the peppercorns and juniper berries and add them together 
with the rest of the ingredients. Grind until nearly smooth. (If you 
prefer a really chunky pate, leave the ground beef to last and process 
just enough to evenly distribute it through the mix. If you prefer 
your pate smooth, grind away.)

5. Decorate the inside of a 2-3 pound loaf tin by smearing the bottom 
with butter and pressing down a few whole bay leaves and juniper 
berries in a floral pattern. fill with the pate mix, dropping it down 
carefully at first so as not to disturb the decoration, then prodding 
it down with a spatula to expel air bubbles and ensure it reaches the 
corners of the loaf tin. Smooth the top and cover with aluminum foil. 
Refrigerate for at least a couple of hours for the flavors to develop; 
overnight is best.

6. Arrange a shelf at the lowest point of the oven and preheat to 350 
degrees. Boil a kettle of water. Place the loaf tin in a larger baking 
tin with high sides and fill with boiling water halfway up the sides 
of the loaf tin. Place on the lowest shelf and cook for 30 minutes, 
then turn down the heat to 300 degrees and cook for another 90 
minutes.

7. Remove from oven, leaving pate covered and in the baking tin of 
water. Allow to cool for about 30 minutes then remove from the water 
(which will be oil, as fat will have exuded from the loaf tin), place 
on paper towels and evenly weight the top with 4-5 pounds - Use a 
small board, thick cardboard or a book you don't care about on the 
aluminum foil, making sure it fits inside the loaf tin sides. Weight 
with large cans or a pile of books. This stage isn't essential, but it 
makes the pate less crumbly and easier to slice.

8. When the pate has cooled almost completely - 2 to 3 hours - remove 
the weights and foil. You will notice the pate has shrunk back from 
the sides of the tin and is surrounded by liquid. This is good. When 
chilled, the juices and fat will solidify, creating a protective layer 
around the pate. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 
overnight for the flavors to develop further. Pate is best eaten two 
days to a week after it is cooked.

9. To serve, carefully remove the plastic wrap - it will have 
condensed water hanging from it - and rest the loaf tin in warm water 
for 30 seconds or so to loosen the protective fat layer surrounding 
the pate. Put a serving plate upside down over the tin and turn them 
both right side up. The pate should drop neatly onto the plate. If it 
doesn't, a light shake should dislodge it. If it remains obstinate, 
warm the loaf tin some more. Either leave the fat covering the pate or 
gently prize it off, as is your wont. Slice thinly and serve with 
crusty French bread, toast points or crisp crackers. Wine is an almost 
obligatory accompaniment. Serve either red or white; this pate doesn't 
care. I recommend a medium- to full-bodied wine that can stand up to 
the pate's strong flavor but not overpower it. 

10. Accept the humble and awed compliments of your guests who never 
dreamed they'd taste anything like this outside a classy restaurant.

THE MINOR LEAGUES: WHAT BASEBALL'S REALLY ALL ABOUT
By HAL PHILLIPS

It seems every time there's a work stoppage in the major leagues, 
"purists" begin singing the praises of minor league baseball. As they 
extol the minor leagues' refreshing, nay, cleansing qualities, these 
dogmatic traditionalists usually throw their heads back in fits of 
Dionysian pleasure. 

It just so happened the 1994 baseball strike coincided with the 
Portland Sea Dogs inaugural season, so the reaction was two-fold in 
Maine's largest city. Aside from setting the minor league attendance 
record, just about everyone in the Greater Portland area - all 46 of 
us - own at least one piece of Sea Dogs paraphernalia, testimony to 
the team's ability to promote itself.

[All this despite a viral "family atmosphere" that infects Portland's 
Hadlock Field: No smoking, single-payer beer system, lots of fun 
sideshows for the kiddies.]

I've been to several Sea Dogs game and enjoyed them. But no baseball 
organization in America promotes itself better than the St. Paul 
Saints, an independent Double-A team co-owned by Bill Murray, who 
shows up periodically in the Twin Cities to coach first base. I took 
in a Saints game here during the August nuptials of David Kett and 
Beth Jordan. Here's a sampling of what goes on during the average 
Saints tilt:

* First of all, let's note what goes on beforehand - tailgating. The 
parking lot opens three hours before the first pitch. Genius!

* Each main concourse, separating the box seats from general 
admission, features a special sideshow. On the first-base side, a 
barber named Ralph gives haircuts. On the third-base line, a nun named 
Sister Rosalyn gives massages. I can testify as to the quality of 
Rosalyn's work - she and God are clearly on the same team.

* When the umpire asks for new baseballs, a unescorted pig delivers 
them to home plate.

* The Saints PA announcer brings to baseball what public address has 
been missing for 150 years: sarcasm. Before every announcement, he 
would intone, "Your attention please; your attention please..." There 
was no organ, so the PA guy would hum the Addams Family theme and "da-
da-da-da" song a cappella. 

At one point, with St. Paul trailing 5-1 in the fourth inning, the 
Saints third baseman lashed a line drive to dead center, where the 
fielder misplayed it into a triple. As the Saint pulled up at third 
the crowd booed, disappointed he didn't go for an inside-the-park 
homer. With the fans still moaning, the PA guy interrupted: "Hey! Hey, 
hey... Not down four runs in the fourth, ladies and gentlemen. C'mon 
now." The ignorant masses hushed right up. 

However, whenever he would say something really funny, locals felt 
compelled to qualify his humor. "He's from New York, you know," they 
would explain. What with that? Is it code language?

* The Saints' best promotion is "The Futon Gallery." Rising on stilts 
over the right field wall, "The Futon Gallery" is basically a platform 
adorned with plants, coffee table, lamps and a futon couch - 
presumably provided by a local futon purveyor. One lucky fan, selected 
at random from the audience, sits in the Gallery all night, eating 
free brats and beers.

* Another good stunt is "Old Mr. Johnson's Window," sponsored by some 
local window purveyor. This involves a lucky fan, selected at random 
from the audience, who goes to center field where an ordinary 
household window sits atop the fence. The fan has three chances to 
smash the window with a baseball. If he does, Old Mr. Johnson emerges 
from a door in the centerfield fence and chases some kid across the 
outfield, with the PA guy providing voice-over: "I'll get you this 
time, you little whipper-snapper!"

* At one point during my Saints experience, the PA guy called the 
crowd's attention to a small bleacher way out in left field. 

"That's our Family Section," he explained. "We in the Saints 
organization try to foster a family atmosphere here. So in the Family 
Section, there's no smoking, no drinking and, basically, no fun at 
all."

NIGHMARE ON DEERING ST.
By HAL PHILLIPS

PORTLAND, Maine - The plan was hatched in Billerica on the occasion of 
Jim O'Reilly's bachelor gala, the theme for which borrowed greatly 
from New Hampshire's alpine slogan, "Ski 93". That's Interstate 93, of 
course. We were bar-hopping in Billerica, however, and modified this 
catch phrase to "Drink 3A".

In any case, whilst throwing back beers & shots at Billerica's finest 
road house, Ma Newman's, Mark Sullivan - being responsible for 
promulgating the notion that former House Speaker Thomas Brackett Reed 
haunted my apartment - suggested we contact the long-dead Mainer by 
conducting a seance (see related story).

We had every intention of doing this properly, i.e. through a medium 
with identifiable cosmic credentials... But you'd be surprised how 
difficult finding a psychic can be; especially one who makes house 
calls.

Sullivan made the first attempt at securing a paranormal tour guide, 
making contact with a woman named Linda Saurenman of Concord, Mass., a 
psychic who (not surprisingly) specializes in ferreting out 
Revolutionary War-era spirits. Having sized him up on the telephone 
for five minutes, Saurenman told Mark she could identify - through him 
- a female spirit in my apartment. This distaff apparition was wearing 
a long dress, explained Saurenman, who had no interest in traveling to 
Maine for the seance. But she did provide Mark with a contact.

Richard McKenzie is a dowser living in Falmouth, Maine. After tersely 
informing me that dowsers identify water sources or folks lost in the 
deep woods - not lingering souls from the Other Side - McKenzie asked 
me for details on why I needed a medium. After I gave him the whole 
Thomas Brackett Reed spiel (he lived in my house, which is named for 
him...), McKenzie switched gears, his interest piqued. He launched 
into a 20-minute soliloquy on the dynamics of auras, explaining that 
those individuals who die unexpected or violent deaths don't go where 
they're supposed to go, as it were. Unprepared for death, their auras 
linger in a limbo stage. Talented media, he said, can assist these 
spirits in moving on to the proper stage. 

On McKenzie's advice I contacted Carole Curran, a parapsychologist I 
found in the Yellow Pages. She was very defensive, insisting her work 
provided "no entertainment value. This is for real!" However, after I 
invited her to visit my apartment for the seance, Curran explained she 
didn't make house calls. Instead, she invited me to visit her Portland 
office. 

"Don't you need to be near the spirit to contact him?" I asked.

"Not necessary," she answered sternly. "I can do it through you, right 
here in my office. Just like turning on an FM radio."

Undaunted, I called a local New Age crystal shop, where I learned the 
house psychic reader, Patricia, was booked for the weekend. From 
there, I attempted to contact one Sharon Elaina, an Indian faith 
healer recommended by a co-worker. The Scarborough, Maine-based Elaina 
specializes in Indian Heart Circles similar to the one depicted in 
"Gray's Anatomy," by monologist Spalding Gray. Unfortunately, I traded 
phone messages but never spoke with Elaina, who said she very 
interested by my "case".

Come Labor Day weekend, with the big night was fast approaching and no 
psychic to be had, those slated for the seance - the lovely Sharon 
Vandermay, Sullivan, O'Reilly & then-fiancee Kris Kelleher - set out 
in search of a Ouija board. We visited the New Age crystal shop, where 
the woman behind the counter remembered my earlier call and took an 
interest.

"Do you have any sea salt?" she queried.

"What for?" I answered.

"You'll need it to sprinkle in each corner of the room, to ward off 
unfriendly spirits."

"How about kosher salt," I asked.

"That should be fine."

The woman was clearly worried we novices were biting off more of the 
spiritual world than could be safely chewed. She urged us to respect 
the process, or we would find ourselves in deep, paranormal trouble. 

"You should invoke your highest guides before the seance," she warned.

"Highest guides?" I was confused. "What do you mean by highest 
guides?"

"I mean your strongest, most personal, spiritual guides," she said. 
"You should have them there to protect you."

"Well, we have two Catholics in the group. We should be okay."

She laughed: "I don't think they're going to help."

WHITHER FETSET?
By MARK SULLIVAN

PORTLAND, Maine - Well might we ask along with the lager-soaked, 
Buffett-crooning Jim O'Reilly: "Whash da ghost's name? Whash da name 
of the ghost?"

Who or what was behind the mysterious word etched on Hal Phillips' 
Ouija board this past Labor Day weekend, in the most cryptic message 
since a tree-carving Crotoan marked the vanishing of the Lost Colony 
of Roanoke?

Who is, what is, and whither "Fetset"?

Research into possible etymological roots of the term "Fetset" turned 
up several intriguing - if questionably plausible - possibilities. Two 
themes repeatedly surfaced: the warding-off of demons and drunken 
revelry.

This seems remarkably appropriate given the more than slightly sozzled 
tenor of our Labor Day weekend inquiries into the Other Side.

At a New Age store in Portland that sold crystals, Tarot cards, Indian 
fertility idols and how-to books on conversing telepathically with 
caribou, we were cautioned against making careless use of the Ouija 
board. Those who cavalierly treat the board as a party game, we were 
warned, run the risk of summoning no-account wandering spirits who 
might latch onto unwitting board players, or who, if poltergeists, 
might move into the house and start smashing china.

The warning was not lost on us. Advised to sprinkle sea salt in the 
corners of the room as a precaution against evil spirits, Hal Shook 
Morton's table salt about with a gusto not seen since Mr. Fuji and 
Toru Tanaka purified the wrestling ring at Madison Square Garden.

Admittedly, by the time we got around to mentally placing protective 
white lights around ourselves, most of us were well-lit already. Given 
this context, some possible roots of "Fetset" present themselves:

* The Fete Des Fous of medieval France was a festival of promiscuity 
similar to the Bacchic celebrations of Greece and the Saturnalia of 
Rome.

* The Fescennine verses and songs of ancient Rome were recited or sung 
at rustic merrymakings and harvest festivals. They were named after a 
popular festival site, Fescennia in southern Etruria, and for a god, 
Fascinus, to whom the verses were offered as a precaution against 
sorcery. An early Latin divinity, Fascinus was worshipped as a 
protector from evil demons and witchcraft, and was often represented 
in the form of a phallus, a symbol believed most efficient in averting 
evil influences.

* The -et suffix of "Fetset" might suggest a tie to ancient Egypt, the 
lost civilization revered by New Age adherents of pyramid power. Cats 
were worshipped in ancient Egypt as they are in Hal's apartment. 
Indeed, it has been remarked that Hal's voluptuous cat Zelda bears a 
striking resemblance about the eyes to British starlet, Patsy Kensit, 
whose name bears a remarkably homonymous relation to "Fetset." The 
Egyptians had a minor goddess named Khenset, or Khensit, but she 
tended to be depicted as a cow.

Kenset was the wife of Sopd, "lord of the East, the one who smites the 
Asiatics," a deity sometimes pictured a winged bes - an ugly, serpent-
strangling dwarf with a cat's ears, mane and tail, whose image placed 
over a door or headstand was believed to keep away noxious animals and 
evil spirits. A joyous deity, the bes was fond of drinking and was 
often represented sucking beer from a large jar.

Might "Fetset" be some sort of astral signature or trademark? The 
Latin term fecit, literally "he or she made it," was an artist's way 
of signing a work. 

* From the Portuguese word Feitico, for "fabricated," came the term 
"fetishism," the worship of idols or other objects as having magic 
power.

* Meantime, the acronym FET stands for a Spanish falangist party, and 
set is the Portuguese abbreviation for September. Might the end-of-
summer weekend have found an Iberian fascist flitting about in Hal's 
apartment. Is Francisco Franco still dead?

Hal might want to keep a few extra salt shakers about the place, just 
in case. 

Paranormal Editor Mark Sullivan lives in Winchester, Mass., where he 
freelances on more down-to-earth subjects for The Boston Globe. The 
above-mentioned seance was his idea, as was the notion that Thomas 
Brackett Reed - former Speaker of the U.S. House - haunted the 
Portland, Maine apartment where Herald editor Hal Phillips now 
resides.
