PHILLIPS TO LEAVE DEERING ST.; DRUNKEN MELEE PLANNED
BY HAL PHILLIPS

PORTLAND, Maine - Get to know me. Get to know the spirit of Thomas 
Brackett Reed. Get to know the lovely Sharon Vandermay. Get a measure 
of social religion. Get legless.

Get while the gettin's good here at 30 Deering St. on April 22. A tri-
level soiree has been scheduled for that particular Saturday night on 
the occasion of the fair Ms. Vandermay's birthday. Further, as I'm 
moving in with my betrothed birthday girl on June 1, attendees will 
have the opportunity to bid farewell to Thomas Brackett Reed house 
where I've resided for lo, these past three years - my longest tenure 
at any address since leaving for college. Upstairs neighbor "Aroo-
stook" Mary Fowler has generously added her apartment for party use 
while access to the roof here at TBR house will allow wondrous views 
of Portland's Back Bay. [Let the record show the Herald Legal 
Department hereby warns invitees against getting drunk and falling off 
the roof.]

All readers should consider this issue of the Herald an invitation to 
the party, almost certainly the last social event of any import to be 
staged at this 19th century historic landmark. Festivities should 
commence around 8 p.m. There will be nibbles, but big-eating folks 
would be well served to eat beforehand, if only to line your stomachs. 
Various libations - beer, spirits and NABs - will be provided, but 
even the most modest liquid birthday gifts (for Sharon, of course) 
would be much appreciated. Indeed, a six-pack or bottle of wine would 
spur our instant and endless devotion. Let's recap, shall we?

What: A party on three levels
Whose: Mine
Where: Thomas Brackett Reed House, 30 Deering St., Portland; the 
corner of Deering and State Street (Route 77).
When: Saturday, April 22 at 8 p.m.
Why: Fair Sharon's birthday and goodbye to TBR House.

Directions: Get to I-95. Get to I-295 towards Portland. Get off the 
highway at the Forest Avenue exit, going towards the city. Get right, 
into Deering Oaks Park. Get through the light, up the hill, through 
another light, and go left on Deering Street. Get a parking spot. 
Getting here from Cape Elizabeth is different: Get over the Million 
Dollar Bridge and go left on High Street. Get left as you pass over 
Congress Street and go left on Deering, across from the Royal Sonesta. 
Get a parking spot because 30 Deering is two blocks away. Got it? 
Good.

ENORMOUS ANTLERS AND FUSED METACARPALS: CHICKS DIG 'EM
By MARK SULLIVAN

The Irish elk that roamed Europe 12,000 years ago had enormous 
branching antlers that spanned a dozen feet. The deer-horn equivalent 
of the barbecued bronto ribs that upended the Flintstones' roadster, 
these cumbersome appendages were considered the most fetching by 
female Irish elks.

The Hal Phillips who roams latter-day golf courses from Kennebunk to 
Kuala Lumpur was born with fused metacarpal bones, effectively leaving 
him without wrists. The condition makes swinging five-irons or typing 
a challenge for this golf magazine editor, but renders him nearly 
invincible at arm-wrestling.

Science suggests the long-extinct deer and Hal have something in 
common. Hal's wrists and the Elk's antlers, physiological departures 
that seem to flout practicality, may in fact have enhanced the owners' 
ability to reproduce - a paramount factor in the Darwinian scheme.  
Further, the evolutionary significance and hereditary impact of Hal's 
wristlessness have drawn increased scrutiny since he announced his 
intention to wed later this year.

Hal's curious condition is not readily evident. One is reminded of 
another famous Harold, the silent film star Harold Lloyd, who early in 
his career blew off one of his thumbs with a prop explosive; Lloyd 
successfully hid this fact from the camera by means of a flesh-colored 
glove fitted with a prosthetic thumb, which he wore even when dangling 
from clock towers.

In Hal's case you don't notice his lack of wrists until he begins to 
type, in a paddle-paw fashion that suggests a circus bear playing the 
piano. On the golf course, Hal finds his fused wrists are "good for 
coming out of the rough - the club doesn't turn in my hands." But he 
has a difficult time with toll booths. "I can't lean back and make a 
smooth, easy transition palming the money," he explains.
Impractical as their design may be, Hal's wrists may fill a unique 
role in the evolutionary scheme. In "Only His Wings Remained," an 
essay in his 1985 book The Flamingo's Smile, Harvard paleontologist 
Steven Jay Gould writes: "Our world overflows with peculiar, otherwise 
senseless shapes and behaviors that function only to promote victory 
in the great game of mating and reproduction. No other world but 
Darwin's would fill nature with such curiosities that weaken species 
and hinder good design but bring success where it really matters in 
Darwin's universe alone - passing more genes to future generations."
Gould's favorite oddities of this sort are "the tail feathers of 
peacocks and the huge, encumbering antlers of Irish elks, both 
adaptations in the struggle among males for access to, or acceptance 
by, females, but certainly not contributions to good design in a 
biochemical sense."

David Rose, PhD, a geneticist at Harvard Medical School, suggests 
wrist-lessness may increase the probability of Hal's having children.
"It might make masturbation more difficult, so it increases the 
likelihood he will reproduce with something else," observes Rose, who 
added: "If we lived in a society where the probability of mating 
rested on arm-wrestling skills, maybe he would have an advantage. 
Perhaps that explains why he visits Bubba's Sulkey Lounge with such 
frequency."

Hal's fiancee, comely exposition organizer Sharon Vandermay, confirmed 
that Hal's wristlessness was a distinct attraction. "None of the other 
men I dated had no wrists," she said. "It was yet another unique 
characteristic that set him apart from my other suitors."

TERM-LIMIT DRIVEL DIES GENERATIONAL DEATH
BY HAL PHILLIPS

The term limit debate has peaked and will soon take on the importance 
of other burning issues like  the House postal code and anything to do 
with Lamar Alexander - which is to say it won't matter a lick. The 
entire argument never made any sense. To wit, 80 percent of the voting 
public is said to favor term limits, yet only 45 percent of the same 
voting public participates in elections. Do the math. You can't.

 It appears nearly half of those favoring term limits don't bother to 
cast ballots - or lie about it - therefore forfeiting the right to 
comment on the length of political careers, much less alter The 
Constitution forever. Republicans claim the nation damn near demanded 
term limits in November. But how are we to interpret that message in 
light of so many established senators and congresspeople getting the 
sack? Tom Foley opposed term limits, a stand that definitely 
influenced his defeat by a virtual unknown. Yet the defeat of Foley, 
the first House Speaker to lose an election in 130 years, is also the 
most eloquent argument one can make against the need for term 
limitation in '90s America. Clearly, we already have term limits. It's 
called voting. In Ayn  Rand's libertarian treatise Atlas Shrugged, the 
author makes it clear the common good is best served when individuals 
look out for number one. As much as they might crow about removing 
government restriction, only rarely does your ideologue Republican 
stumble into a defensible position on libertarian grounds. In this 
case, the former minority unwittingly employed libertarian self-
interest to defeat a distinctly alibertarian ideal the GOP itself 
espoused - that is, restricting voter choice.

Now in the majority, Republican will see to it the issue slowly dies.
Bear in mind one thing during any debate on limiting the terms of 
elected representatives: Remember it has always been and will remain a 
minority issue. If the Republicans manage to retain their majorities 
for 10 years, a new generation of Democrats will pick up the term-
limit mantle and ride the voter dissatisfaction endemic to a free 
society back into office. Once the cycle is complete, self-interest 
will continue to prevail and the term limit issue will die a new 
death.

And that, Rush, is the way it should be, you fat frothing ideologue.

LETTER FROM BRITAIN

(Loathe as we are to the idea of actually assigning stories, for this 
issue the Herald staff asked Mr. Ledger to examine the British 
phenomenon of Mr. Blobby, a sort of aggressive-but-guileless Barney 
jacked on ecstasy. The enormous appeal appears to center around 
impromptu meetings with celebrities who chat amiably with Mr. Blobby 
until the gourd-shaped polka-dotted mega-muppet becomes so excited he 
mauls his company with affection, often knocking them to the ground. 
During these "exchanges," the weebl-esque children's TV personality 
excitedly exhibits the limited extent of his vocabulary: "Blobby, 
blobby, blobby, blobby..." he burbles. Blobbymania has swept the 
normally reserved British landscape, triggering record deals and 
bemused features in American newspapers, one of which quoted an 
English sociologist as saying "Mr. Blobby reveals an aspect of British 
culture we're not particularly thrilled to discuss, especially with 
Americans." Contributor Trevor Ledger, who files from his Goose 
Cottage home in Victoria Lane, comments quickly on the Mr. Blobby 
craze before moving on to subjects further afield. We can ask, but we 
can't restrict Mr. Ledger's subject matter any more than we can insist 
he wash his knickers. On yet another subject he warns, "Stop the 
press: Interpol Alert - Adrian Praeter will be in the U.S.A. in July. 
Members of the public are advised not to lend him money or allow him 
anywhere near your stash of weed. You have been warned, by a victim.")

BRITAIN CLOSES THE CULTURAL TRADE IMBALANCE
BY TREVOR LEDGER

MARKET DRAYTON, Shropshire - Ah! Revenge is sweet. So, Mr. Blobby has 
wheedled his way across the Atlantic and turned up on the hallowed 
pages of the Sunday New York Times. I'm sorry that you should been 
encumbered with a 7-foot,pink and yellow polka dot smegger whose 
vocabulary consists of  "blobby, blobby, blobby," but let's be honest: 
You deserve it. It says something about the English, as a nation, that 
we let Mr. Blobby's debut single (adventurously entitled, "Mr. 
Blobby") sit atop the hit parade for a month or so. But we shouldn't 
be in the least bit apologetic considering the shit we've imported 
from Brother Yank for so long: McDonald's, rap, Knots Landing, Trident 
Missiles, the O.J. Trial...

The fucking O.J. trial!! What is this shit? I don't know him. I don't 
know him.  I don't know him, and I certainly don't care what happens 
to him (neither does his wife, tee hee hee). Now, if you lot are so 
crass as to want to court cultural suicide by making such a spectacle 
of a trial, then fine. But I object to having BBC2 programming 
disturbed by "Sonja Norbst with an O.J. Update." My proposal? Charge 
up the chair, fry the fucker (guilty or not), and let it be a lesson 
to 'im. Wanna be famous? Want loads of cash? Okay. But if you waste 
anyone, relatives or not, we're gonna shoot 100,000 volts up your 
jacksy live on TV. Now that, I'd watch.

One of you better exports is baseball. How ironic, a nation that 
stamps all over trade unions for the underprivileged masses allows its 
national sport to be held ransom by a union! A union, mark you, 
comprised of the mega rich who, given a modicum of common sense, would 
only ever have to spend 5-10 years of their lives working (playing). 
"The Union forever, defending the right..." Out of interest, the 
average first-class cricketer earns L320,000 sterling per year. For 
the ignorant, cricket is an older, classier and better version of 
baseball.

Stop Press: Is my son a genius? Having endured a very windy morning 
walk, the conversation went something like this:

Ieuan: I'm going to kill the wind, daddy.
Me: How are you going to do that then?
Ieuan: I'll turn the low pressure into high pressure. Then the wind 
will stop and it'll be sunny.
Me: *!X?*!!

Ieuan David Ledger is four in June and, to my untrained eye, does not 
have "666" tattooed on his scalp. And yes, I am showing his 
intelligence off, proud father that I am.

THE HAROLD HERALD BOOK REVIEW
Sarum: A novel of England, by Edward Rutherfurd
The Shipping News, by Annie Proulx
Mary Renault: Biography by David Sweetman
The Cnamber by John Grisham

SOMEWHERE OVER THE PACIFIC - The only discernible bright side to 
spending 24 hours in air transit to Singapore, and 24 back again, is 
the chance to read virtually uninterrupted by work, social obligation 
or, sadly, sleep. I can't sleep on planes so I had the opportunity to 
knock off four books and several periodicals during my late-March 
junket to the Pacific Rim. Brief reviews follow:

* Finally finished off Sarum: A Novel of England, by E dward 
Rutherfurd, somewhere between  Portland and Chicago-O'Hare. This 900-
page historical novel tracks the community living on and around the 
Salisbury plain (an area known colloquially as Sarum) from the last 
ice age through the 19th century. While the premise at first sounds 
absurd in scope, Rutherfurd manages to pull us along with phenomenal 
coherence. Of course, English history provides a lengthy, intriguing 
timeline, which Rutherfurd decorates with all manner of interesting 
fictional devices while furtively slipping the reader not-at-all-dry 
details of social history. The birth of English parliamentarianism and 
the textile trade are explained as well by Rutherfurd as anyone I've 
read. Because virtually all the fictional characters are descendants 
of two iron-age men - one tall and dark with long fingers, another 
fair and stocky with stubby digits - the author continually strings 
eras together, connects Picts with Romans, and offers believable 
insight into the English psyche, such as it is. Rutherfurd makes it 
clear, for example, that  Elizabethan Peter Wilson - with his long, 
delicate fingers - is related, however distantly, with the bronze-age 
river man, Tark. With these blood ties made clear, what could have 
been a awkward, disjointed history becomes, on another level, a pair 
of compelling family sagas. Good stuff.

*  When you win the American Book Prize and your novel is recommended 
by two such disparate characters as my mother and Mark Sullivan, you 
surely don't need my affirmation. But let the record show that I 
thoroughly enjoyed The Shipping News, Annie Proulx's quirky novel 
about growth through retreat on the briny frontier of Newfoundland's 
coast. Proulx's writing style is, to say the least, unusual. The 
sentence fragments alone are enough to roll the eyes, especially those 
of certain Globe columnists. Yet it's a measure of the author's 
storytelling skill and ability to craft dialogue that her novel can be 
judged on its considerable merits, thereby rising above her aversion 
to coupling subjects and verbs not  to mention her loopy choice of 
character names. Luckily the reader comes to care a great deal about 
Tert Card, Billy Pretty and Quoyle, the mono-monickered central 
character. Quoyle is a 300-pound, long-suffering loser and widower who 
moves his family to The Rock, mysteriously depicted by Proulx as a 
sort of Island of Misfit Toys surrounded by the ever-present Atlantic, 
at once therapeutic and dangerous. Great choice of setting here. 
Quoyle marvels along with us at the prospect of waking up and seeing 
an iceberg float by the kitchen window. Quoyle is at first bewildered 
by the engaging but thoroughly imperfect Newfoundlanders and their 
ability to thrive in this bleak environment. Eventually it empowers 
him. He falls for a fellow widower named Wavey, transforms himself 
from a tentative, third-rate newspaper reporter into an insightful 
editor, and readers go home happy.

* Mary Renault's The Charioteer and Gore Vidal's The City and the 
Pillar - both published in 1947 - debunked the myth that homosexual 
central characters were not capable of generating mass appeal. While 
Vidal went on to become America's foremost man of letters (when he 
wasn't calling William F. Buckley a crypto-fascist), Renault moved to 
South Africa and churned out an acclaimed series of historical novels 
set in Ancient Greece, including the Persian Boy, Bull from the Sea 
and Fire from Heaven.. David Sweetman's biography of Renault 
(pronounced re-nolt, not like the French car) isn't written with any 
great elegance or insight, but the author's life was so full the 
reader is sated. Born Eileen Mary Challans in 1905, the British author 
was among the first to integrate Oxford, trained as a nurse and 
published three rather light, romance novels before leaving for Durban 
and Capetown where she brought Theseus, Alexander and Alcibiades to 
life, chaired PEN International and actively worked against the 
institution of apartheid. All of this she did with a considerable 
amount of courage and controversy. Judging from Sweetman's text, 
Renault didn't have much use for women. Indeed, Sweetman opines that 
Renault honestly considered herself a Man.  Though she was a lesbian 
and spent nearly all her adult life with a single companion, Renault 
clearly eschewed the company of women, much preferring social 
associations with gay men. In  her novels, virtually all her lead 
characters are gay men. Female characters, usually some hero's 
overbearing mom, are notoriously bitchy, weak and irrational - not 
unlike her own mother. A consistent critic of Afrikaner nationalism 
from the outset, Renault ran afoul of fellow PEN members (including 
Nadine Gordimer) by opposing the free world's cultural boycott of 
South Africa arguing that small-minded Afrikaner needed outside 
influence, not a blind eye. * Read my first John Grisham novel, The 
Client, on the plane back from Hawaii. I was out of reading material 
and borrowed it from a colleague. Sure, it was a page-turner, but one 
is required to turn pages in the phone book, too. What a piece of 
rubbish! In addition to proving that he writes with all the flair of a 
tort lawyer, Grisham proves that it's damn near impossible to write 
good dialogue using flat, uninteresting characters. I wasn't expecting 
much, figuring I was unconsciously avoiding Grisham because everyone 
else seems to love him. I'm gratified to have a legitimate reason to 
avoid him further.

CD'S AND OTHER RETIRMENT STRATEGIES

WATT GOES SOLO, STINSON GOES SOUTH
By DAVID M. ROSE

If you don't know who Mike Watt is - and most people don't - you've 
missed a lot. In the late 70s and early 80s, Watt came of age as the 
anchor for the seminal jazz/punk trio, the minutemen, breaking bass 
strings in booming counterpoint to singer/screamer d. boon's swirling 
guitar leads. After d. boon died in an auto accident in 1985, Watt and 
Brockton, Mass.-born drummer George Hurley teamed up with boyish Ohio 
native Ed Crawford. The new band, fIREhOSE, was less political and 
more subdued, but Crawford proved an able successor to d. boon, and 
they approximated the genius that was the minutemen about as well as 
anyone could reasonably expect. 

A couple of months ago, Watt announced - in Rolling Stone of all 
places - that fIREhOSE was no more. After eight years, Watt said, the 
members had grown too comfortable with one another. It was time for 
something new and on Feb. 28, Watt's first solo effort, "Ball-Hog or 
Tugboat" was released. The title refers to two diametrically opposed 
roles a musician can play: self-promoting prima donna or nurturing 
team player. The solo album format, of course, is the ultimate ball-
hog playpen, so it's refreshing to see Watt take the tugboat approach 
and make it work as well as he does. 

Watt's metaphor for the process that yielded the album is wrestling; 
by calling different participants into the ring for each of the disk's 
17 tracks, he essentially ends up with 17 different bands, composed of 
51 different performers. Participants range from relative unknowns 
(Anna Waronker? Pat Smear?) to the heavyweights of post-punk arena 
rock: Evan Dando, Eddie Vedder, King Ad Rock, and Flea. The obvious 
danger here is the result will be a disjointed mess, but the thread 
that runs through all this is Watt himself; he sings only three songs, 
but he produces and plays bass on every track. By virtue of his 
unmatched technical proficiency and clarity of artistic vision, he's 
able to straddle the ball-hog/tugboat dichotomy as few others could. 
Each track is unique, but the whole thing never stops sounding like a 
Mike Watt record. 

My personal favorite here is probably "Piss Bottle Man", Watt's 
tribute to his dad's eminently practical means of avoiding unnecessary 
pit-stops on long car trips. It brought back warm memories of the 
lemon yellow bottle my parents kept under the front seat of our '64 
Chevy station wagon, and it was nice to hear that we weren't the only 
ones.  Equally effective are "Against the 70's" (a treatise on the 
dangers of mindless nostalgia) and the jazzy "Sidemouse Advice", 
featuring a very capable Flea on trumpet. Some have criticized Watt 
for including such luminaries as Dando and Vedder on the record. 
Indeed, one such critic - Kathleen Hanna - appears on the disk, 
deriding the project as a "white rock-boy hall of fucking shame" and 
urging the arena rockers to get over their "big-white-baby-with-an-
ego-problem thing." Hanna's diatribe is funny, and some of her points 
well-taken, but I don't think they have much relevance to BH/T; to a 
man, the rock stars seem to have checked their sizable egos at the 
door.

 As to whether the inclusion of some big names constitutes a sell-out 
on Watt's part, I think the music speaks for itself; you won't be 
hearing these songs on MTV unplugged anytime soon. 

                                 ***

There was some sad but not completely unexpected news this past month: 
Bob Stinson, lead guitarist for the influential pre-post-punk band, 
the Replacements, died of heart failure, presumably the result of drug 
use.  In their early years, the Replacements - devoted substance 
abusers all - were perhaps best known for their drunken live shows, 
during which they often abandoned their set list in favor of a long 
string of top 40 covers that no one in the band had actually bothered 
to learn. With this backdrop, Stinson's ejection from the band in the 
late 80's for excessive drug and alcohol abuse was ominous, indeed. I 
never saw the Replacements in the early days but my brother, Tom, 
caught the original line-up at the now-defunct Channel in Boston. When 
the band took the stage, Stinson was nowhere to be found, and the band 
was forced to begin playing without him. During the third or fourth 
song, Stinson was spotted in the crowd; members of the audience lifted 
him up and he was deposited on stage, clutching a fifth of Jack 
Daniels. He strapped on his guitar and played the rest of the set and 
three encores more-or-less without incident before returning for the 
fourth encore completely naked except for his guitar. 

He will be missed.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Dear Hal,

Delighted to be on the list to receive your personal publication. 
Thanks. I've read other issues at Mary's.

Enclosed is an article connecting Newt with Thomas Brackett  Reed I 
thought interesting. Didn't you mention in another issue some 
fascination about T.B. Reed? Congratulations! And my best to Sharon!

Dawna Fowler
Fort Fairfield, Maine

Ed. Mrs. Fowler, mother of my upstairs neighbor Mary and frequent 
visitor to Portland, was kind enough to enclose a Bangor Daily News 
feature on Newt Gingrich, Thomas Bracket Reed and James Blaine, House 
speakers all - though some with more impressive credentials than 
others. The story noted that Gingrich on several occasions has 
compared his own revolutionary tactics to those of Reed, who 
masterfully rewrote House rules late in the 19th century. Of course, 
Gingrich couldn't carry Reed's parliamentary jockstrap (Sorry, Mrs. 
Fowler). Indeed, Gingrich bears more of an historical resemblance to 
the wordy Blaine, whose political rise was similarly meteoric and 
likewise studded with ill-considered off-the-cuff remarks and scandal. 
Blaine went on to earn the GOP's 1884 presidential nomination and 
serve as Maine's governor. In any case, the continued irony is that 
Charles Fowler, Dawna's husband and Mary's dad, is a Reed - distantly 
related to Speaker Reed, in whose Portland home Mary and I now reside.

Dear Hal, You pandering excuse for a newsman.

What a shameless display of begging and groveling in the last issue of 
the Herald. Knighting the likes of Allan Jones (no offense, Allan) in 
response to his mere $30 donation summed it all up. I suppose you have 
the capability to boot QEII from her regal stature, drape your readers 
in ermine and perch them on the throne were they to donate, say $60? 
Monarchy should come so cheap. You make me sick.

On the other hand, I will laud you for having the courage to print the 
caustic yet accurate "Letter from Britain." While I agree with 
Trevor's insightful analysis of the Herald as a "shitty little rag", 
"arsewipe (spoken like a true Brit) of a tabloid" and "self-serving 
pile of shit", I add myself to that growing list of "dickheads who are 
coughing up." I've been called a hell of a lot worse.

Enclosed find $10 from me and my beautiful wife, Heather. According to 
your subscription rules, that should put us in good stead until the 
year 2097. After a great deal of deliberation on our part, we will 
accept the titles of "Duke and Duchess of Davis, California."
P.S. "Open the pod bay door, please Hal - Heather.

Rich Gibbons
Duke of Davis, California

Ed. Thanks, Rich, for the cash and, Heather, for the completely 
original reference to 2001: Space Odyssey. Never heard that before... 
Consider your new title and subscription status confirmed. As for the 
authentication of Trevor as a "true Brit," you needn't refer to his 
spelling habits. Just smell him sometime; or examine his teeth.

Dear sirs,

Enclosed please find a check to help with production and mailing 
costs. I realize the high cost of doing business these days (it must 
have cost a king's ransom to get the lovely Sharon Vandermay to change 
her name to something as bland as Phillips).

I look forward to future issues of the Harold Herald and hopefully, 
we'll be able to meet the fair Ms. Vandermay in the coming months, as 
we the readers really need to talk to this woman. I am one reader who 
became aware just how far Mr. Phillips will go.

One evening while visiting 30 Deering St., I was led out for a few 
brews and a fair game of pool. Well, Mr. Phillips really took 
advantage of this.  First, he pointed out all these really cool clubs 
only to take me to this basement [Leo's Billiards] where someone such 
as my 5'18" self could only hope to survive a walk through this head-
crushing maze. Later we drank what proved to head-crushing, rot-gut 
beer. My point is, I lost at pool, hit my head many times [on low-
hanging pipes], and was late for a meeting the next morning.

Mr. Phillips, on the other hand, was on time for his meeting, never 
came close to hitting his head and, of course, won in pool. And lest I 
forget - he did not appear to be hung over the next morning. In any 
case, please keep the Harold Herald coming, and let us meet the lovely 
Sharon Vandermay. She needs to know.

William 5'18" Paprocki
Vernon, N.Y.

Ed. This letter arrived in promising fashion - inside an Augusta 
National envelope. I opened it and noticed the check, figuring the 
boys down in Georgia had finally considered my offer to serve as paid 
press-tent czar at the Masters. Unfortunately, the author, a devoted 
reader of Golf Course News, has a sick sense of humor. While we 
appreciate his generous contribution to our Circulation Endowment, we 
must point out that Leo's was built for homo sapiens of normal build, 
not for those who played hoops for Syracuse in the mid-70s. As for the 
quality of beer, you'll have to take that up with Mr. and Mrs. Geary. 
Besides, "All's fair..." Just ask Sharon, who's keeping her surname.

PEJORATIVE CORNER
(Like Homer's Kerouacian central character, Briton Tim Monaghan began 
his oddysey on a once-proud island off the coast of a more populous 
continental landmass (It could be argued Ithaca has come through its 
cultural upheaval with more dignity). In any case, Monaghan's 
professional route - he's now an editor at the Springfield Union-News 
- has been no less circuitous, beginning in Sudbury and looping 
through suburban Boston before heading ever more west. While toiling 
at the Middlesex News in Framingham, his lovely wife, Lynn Hatch, 
decided to go for her economic doctorate at UMass: "One of the few 
North American universities still harboring left-wing economists who 
believe that  Marx, on the whole, got it right," Tim explains. "As a 
sensitive New Age kind of guy, I immediately suppressed any unhealthy 
reactions about income loss or life disruption and began searching for 
suitable economic bondage in the western part of the state." According 
to Monaghan, the Union-News and Sunday Republican are "about as left-
wing as American papers tend to get, and the unfortunate name of the 
Sunday edition comes from the earliest history of the paper, when the 
founder helped set up the Republican Party and get Abe Lincoln 
nominated for president. A very different kind of GOP back then, and 
an uncanny Springfield connection.")

Ah, western Massachusetts. Home to more  crunchy- earthy types than 
you can shake a daikon at, the People's Republic of UMass (PRU), the 
Island of Lesbos (Smith College Chapter), and the car-theft capital of 
the state, Springfield - also known for its cheerful gang-related 
drive-by shootings. Having only lived in the Pioneer Valley for six 
weeks and as the only known reader of the Harold Herald ever to have 
been a card-carrying member of a socialist party, I am more than ready 
to offer judgment on this politically correct, alternate Hub. It 
sucks. But not for the facile reasons you might imagine... I began my 
bondage in January. It was soon pointed out to me that if I wanted to 
go out for a drink after work, at one of the less-uninhibited imbibing 
establishments dotting the city, I had better bring cash to work with 
me. Going to an ATM machine in the early hours of the morning was an 
invitation to robbery, rape and murder.

Surely not? In this socialist paradise? You betcha, bub. Springfield, 
it was quickly pointed out to me, is one of the toughest cities in the 
Northeast. Holyoke runs a close second, barely surviving its current 
white flight. If it's not gang members shooting you down because they 
think you're a member of a rival gang or an innocent bystander, it's 
the cops drilling you with a 9mm because they mistake you for a gang 
member (I learned today that wearing a bulletproof vest while 
committing a crime is a felony. Makes it too hard for the cops to nail 
you, I guess).

A brief example of the depravity prevalent in urban western 
Massachusetts: Immediately across from the card-key exit to the 
supposedly secure Union-News parking lot - only last night we were 
told not to leave the building until given the all-clear, because the 
police were brutalizing some kids found breaking into employee's cars 
- a constant procession of vehicles turns into a small parking lot 
outside the local Blue Cross-Blue Shield offices. They don't stay 
long. Someone gets in or out, there is a brief conversation, the car 
speeds off. Innocent me, I thought this must be a local car pool drop-
off. 

No way, I was told. That's the local male prostitute pick-up spot. 
Guys hot to get HIV are in and out all night looking for the perfect 
blow job. Hardly dangerous to sensitive New Age guys with monogamous 
life partners, you might argue. As I did.

Think again, my mentors warned. Street bums and gang hoodlums prey on 
the male hookers and find it hard to distinguish between cock-sucking 
entrepreneurs, their johns, and hardworking lackeys of the imperialist 
press. I was regaled with horror stories of colleagues being robbed at 
knife- and gun-point as they tried to leave work. 

The cops don't patrol the area because they hate the Union-News. The 
paper recently published their salaries and asked what they were doing 
to earn them. No one cares.

Therein lies the reason why western Massachusetts really sucks. Up in 
Amherst and Northampton, the sons and daughters of the relatively 
privileged spout their neo-socialist dogma. They indulge in 
predilections for ethnic food from countries their parents would never 
let them visit and strange tastes in music, recreational narcotics and 
sexuality, oblivious to the real world around them. To the south, 
working people are struggling to build ordinary lives amid chaos akin 
to that of downtown Mogadishu. And never the twain shall meet. But 
hey: The Weld administration is too far away to hear the handguns a-
poppin'. And academia is on another planet, zip code lost. My life 
partner excepted, of course.

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia - Centuries before the birth of Christ, Indian 
and Chinese traders fought for hegemony of the Malaysian peninsula 
that lies at the crossroads of Asia's lucrative trade routes. The 
Portuguese took control of the area in the late 16th century, only to 
be supplanted by the 19th-century English, who stayed on until 1957. 
Once you arrive here, you wonder why anyone bothered. Kuala Lumpur, 
the modern capital of Malaysia, means "confluence of two muddy 
rivers." An updated interpretation might read Kuala Lumpur Schmeg, or 
"confluence of two extremely muddy, polluted rivers." It's a filthy 
place that lacks the old world charm of Melaka, the old Portuguese 
capital to the south. KL is a new city, founded in the 1840s, and one 
can only imagine how decrepit it might become 200 years down the road.  
Speaking of roads, the master plan of Kuala Lumpur could only have 
been laid out in an opium den. Despite the city's relative modernity, 
the arteries have no rhyme or reason, which results in a rush-hour 
traffic nightmare the likes of which Bostonians have never seen. 
Nineteen-century Malaysian planners appear to have set a few cows 
loose on the plain and followed them anxiously with buckets of yellow 
paint.

* KAUAI, Hawaii - Hard to be pejorative about our 50th state, which is 
fairy-tale gorgeous and brimming with outstanding golf courses. It's 
even harder not to see the truth in stereotypes about the number of 
Japanese there. When I flew in, seven of the eight flights at baggage 
claim originated in Japan. There were thousands of backpacked Japanese 
milling about with camcorders, filming loved ones as they a) waited 
for their baggage; b) pulled baggage off the carousel; or c) walked 
away from the carousel with bags in tow. I saw one father filming his 
son drinking from a water fountain. Get a life!  I traveled in Europe 
when the dollar was strong, but I never saw American acting so 
unabashedly like tourists. I blame MacArthur.

HAL, INK.
ALTERNATIVE NEWSWEEKLY SEES THE LIGHT
By RUDY MARTSKE

"In the low-budget, low-visibility, low-literacy world of electronic 
'zines, the Harold Herald stands out as an example of how someone with 
an education, a sense of humor and a modem can make a small dent in 
the cybersphere."

So wrote Dan Kennedy in the Feb. 24 Boston Phoenix. How happy my 
parents must be that my expensive Wesleyan education has been 
justified by the city's alternative weekly. Mind you, this was no 
back-page blurb buried beneath classified ads for sinewy mixed-race 
males with a taste for cool whip and randy adventure. No, Kennedy's 
contribution to our growing cult of personality lead the page 2 
feature, This Just In, under the headline, "Welcome to Hal's World."
"Informed by a nihilistic political sensibility and sophomoric 
crudity," Kennedy continued, "the Portland, Maine-based Herald is 
nevertheless one of the funniest, best-written journals on the Net."
Nevertheless?

   The staff here was nevertheless flattered by the write-up. 
Especially well chuffed was political reporter Mark Sullivan, whose 
prose was featured prominently. Turns out he's a friend of Kennedy, 
who was particularly taken with Loid's account of the November 
Republican sweep and its likeness to a "noxious Old Testament plague 
that stopped at every door without an 'R' swabbed in lamb's blood on 
the door." Sullivan's breadth of coverage drew considerable praise - 
enough to move Phoenix editors to include headshots of Mark's targets 
du jour, Lydon LaRouche, the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and Mickey Mouse. 
Conspicuous by its absence was mention of Virtual Editor Dr. David M. 
Rose, whose Net acumen electrifies the Herald and prompted the Kennedy 
column (examples of Dr. Rose's haunting prose were surely victimized 
by the bane of every writer's existence: space considerations). The 
Phoenix commentator, who has never seen the print version, bumped his 
head on the electronic Herald which floated head and shoulders above 
an ash-like collection of motley 'zines. By all rights, given their 
off-beat, underground professions, Phoenix editors should have been 
first to notice the Herald's innately earthy qualities. Who better to 
appreciate self-absorptioin as high art? Instead they are the last of 
Boston's journalistic cognoscenti to "get it." We're not even waiting 
for Murdoch's Herald, where the buffoons who endeavor to formulate 
editorial tone will almost certainly never le comprend.

Boston? Done that. It's time for us to heavily market in uncharted 
waters. I've got a feeling they're going to love us in Cobb County.

                            ***

A pre-nuptial congratulations-in-print was discovered in The Highly 
Esteemed Howl, that barely post-pubescent newsletter whose suprisingly 
conservative staff is secretly pleased as punch to have been called 
"little fucks" in a recent Herald. In any case, I thank you for the 
warm wishes and generous contribution to our Circulation Endowment 
(which is, as always, locked in "accept" mode). However, I must invoke 
the memory of Winston Churchill who said something like, 'If you're 
old and liberal, you have no head. But if you're young and 
conservative, you have no heart.' In these reactionary times rife with 
revisionism and xenophobia, never has this been more important to 
remember. Nixon was an ineffectual domestic leader, the most 
conniving, duplicitous politician of his generation, and a perfectly 
monstrous human being. Indeed, crypto-fascist is about the nicest way 
to describe Dick Nixon, the most aptly named president of all time.
In any case, your kind words and money have warmed the cockles of my 
heart. I call for a respectful truce and would interpret as an act of 
naked aggression any posting of Tracy Chapmen CDs. And for the record, 
all my pants are happy once I've donned them.

FROM SAN FRANCISCO SANS QUENTIN
By TIM DIBBLE
Cinema Critic Ad Eundem Gradum

Not since the arrival of the half-caf/half-decaf double latte has the 
nation in general and San Francisco in particular been so enamored and 
bamboozled by propaganda as is found associated with Plump Diction, 
the latest film from Quentin Tarantino. "Genius violent comic fantasy" 
is a label that can be applied to H.G. Phillips' collegiate sexual 
tenure, but is not apropos with regard to Plump Diction.

To give credit where credit is due, not since the American Oval Office 
has there been a better utilization of unemployed, washed-up 
thespians. However, this does not overshadow the glaring holes and 
weaknesses found in the film:

Plump: What has happened to John Travolta? He hasn't been the same 
since Jamie Lee Curtis dumped him at the end of Perfect. Someone get 
that guy a treadmill.

Diction: Why is it, in this age of cultural literacy, that for a film 
to smack of art its actors and actresses must express themselves as if 
they were attending a Teamster's bachelor party?

Sodomy: It is not the specific act that I find reprehensible. Rather 
if Tarantino wants to sell-out the joint, he should make Bruce Willis 
the recipient while forcing the Moonlighter to hum the "Battle Hymn of 
the Republic." 

Pugilistic Carnage: If Bruce Willis is going to kill a man with his 
bare knuckles, have it be Mickey Rourke.

Uma Thurman: Uma, after your pied-a-terre in Henry and June, why 
bother doing anything else?

Rosanna Arquette: One question: Were you acting?

Harvey Keitel: Harv, you've had a good run lately. But if we can't 
tell the difference between you and Tommy Lee Jones, you are not ready 
for weak Brando-esque cameos.

Samuel L. Jackson: "Senator, you're no Laurence Fishburne!" (I 
actually thought that he was great but was dying to use that line.)

Foot Massage: Quentin, in such a public forum, how could you possibly 
divulge the second-best trade secret of the sensitive, pseudo-
intellectual Cambridge bachelor (second only to the Dali restaurant)?

The only positive to the film is that every time I see Amanda Plummer, 
she makes my wife look like Lady Di. In sum, any moviegoer with a 
modicum of cinematic expertise (and who leaves their latte-sipping 
pretensions on the cutting-room floor) will agree that Plump Diction 
is an over-hyped, rich man's Dr. Giggles. Boy, you'll be a director... 
soon!

HAROLD NOTEBOOK...
IN SINGAPORE, YOU DO WINDOWS OR ELSE!

SINGAPORE - Perhaps you've heard of Flor Constacion, the Filipino maid 
executed by officials here shortly after being convicted of murdering 
another maid and the four-year-old on her watch. It's the latest in a 
series of diplomatic flaps generated by the hang-'em-high-but-
whatever-you-do-hang-'em-now regime here in the cleanest, greenest 
most orderly and productive totalitarian state in Asia-Pacific.
Michael Fay, his butt and any hackles they may have raised here in 
hypocritically righteous America are small potatoes compared to the 
indignant snorts now traded between Singapore and The Philippines, 
who've recalled their ambassadors and dug in for a political siege. 
Defiant Singaporean officials could care less, but the Philippine 
government is seething, and ASEAN countries have publicly quarreled 
quite this testily.

Word on the street in Singapore, something tendered and received with 
trepidation here, sides with the indignant Filipinos who note that Ms. 
Constacion had no motive at all. Indeed, no plausible motive or 
scenario has been forwarded by any Singaporean official - and it'll 
snow on Orchard Avenue when the island nation's only newspaper, the 
government-controlled Straits Times, offers anything by the party 
line.

Only when I traveled to neighboring Malaysia did I hear confirmation 
of the unofficial conventional wisdom:

Apparently, the four-year-old drowned in the Chinese family's swimming 
pool. When Dad came home, discovered the body and flew into a rage, he 
killed the maid who presumably had been charged with making sure bad 
things (like drowning) didn't happen. The desperate father offers Flor 
a couple hundred thousand dollars (U.S.) to take the rap, arguing that 
- with the grieving family's support - she will only receive 
manslaughter and a two-year sentence. She confesses, but the zealous 
judicial system in Singapore rules for the death penalty, swiftly 
administered. Filipino pleas for a stay, if only to establish some 
sort of motive, are ignored.

Despite the country's self-promotion as a peaceful melting pot, 
there's an underlying suspicion there are two sets of rules in sunny 
Singapore: One for those of Chinese descent and another for everyone 
else, and that latter group includes Singaporeans of Malay, Indian and 
Tamil descent, not to mention actual foreigners like Filipino maids, 
Thai prostitutes and American teenagers. And, of course, anyone at all 
engaging in dissent.

Encountered a promo for the "Fresh Prince of Bel Air" while foolishly 
interrupting my channel surf on NBC the other day. The 10-second spot 
dramatically teased an upcoming episode in which Prince Fresh was 
tragically but oh-so topically swept up in the growing urban 
phenomenon of gunplay. The closing voice-over was grave: "The French 
Prince has been shot." "Finally," I muttered with relief. I'd like to 
think I spoke for everybody.

One Man's Baseball Strike Retrospective:
It was like sitting around in post-Alarick Rome reminiscing about when 
you could watch Christians disemboweled by large ravenous animals. 
Even though it's on the way back, apparently, baseball has been on the 
fritz for so long, it seems so far away as to have been before our 
time. Just pictures, statistics and film clips of past glories. 
SportsChannel America has been running an otherwise fascinating series 
of "Baseball's Greatest Games," full-game tapes of various World 
Series and playoff thrillers. Always a game of significance, but you 
always know who won ahead of time, too. All of baseball has taken on 
this nostalgic quality as we rave and moan by turn about foregone  
conclusions and negotiative snafus of the past. When we're not 
militantly vilifying both sides, we lazily indulge in the maudlin 
jingoism/marketing plan that preaches baseball as a kind of group 
worship to the pagan god of leisure. Rubbish! If there were a baseball 
deity (an American deity, mind you), it would be a benevolent god; a 
god that wouldn't subject us to TV contracts that don't show National 
League Championship Series games in American League cities. Agrippa, 
God of Rosin, would not have allowed Marty Bystrom to come back and 
pitch in a major league baseball game.

The Christian equivalent is akin to a New Yorker cartoon I clipped and 
saved somewhere: Sitting at his desk in Hell, Satan reaches to his 
pager so as to call his secretary - "Ms. Clark, find Joe Stalin and 
tell him that communism is dead."

It occurs to me that if you have trouble reading the bottom-left 
credits on MTV, it's either time to get glasses, or it's time to stop 
watching MTV... The Young Ones are back. After a solid run on MTV 
(they laudably broadcast all 10 episodes over and over again), the 
ultimate British comedy series is back on cable thanks to Comedy 
Central. Talk about sophomoric crudity! Even the crudite is sophomoric 
on The Young Ones. I was first exposed to the lads (listen!) at the 
University of London in 1985, two years after it had established its 
cult status in England. My flatmates - Adrian Praeter, publisher of 
the clever but rarely circulated Adrian's Oracle, and Herald columnist                                                                                                                                                                                         
Ledger - quoted liberally from the show and a Young Ones book, which I 
never actually saw (if anyone is familiar with this and knows where to 
find one, contact me immediately). In any case, the show finally 
surfaced on MTV in 1989, then disappeared in 1991. If you've never 
experienced the Young Ones, set your VCR to Comedy Central on 
Saturdays at 11 p.m.

HEY, IT'S MY JOB!
A COMPENDIUM OF THE GRATIS GOLF EXPERIENCES OF OUR ESTEEMED EDITOR
BY HAL PHILLIPS

HOMMASSASSA SPRINGS, Fla.  Played my last round here with , the 
temperamental clubs Ive used since my old set were stolen from the 
back of my car at  11th and Independence, in the shadow of our , 
nations capital. That was 1988. Delta Airlines, not street crime, was 
responsible for the latest debacle. 

While visiting Orlando in late January I played here at World Woods, a 
nice 36-hole Tom Fazio design two hours northwest of Shaqville, near 
the Gulf Coast. The last round with the ill-fated clubs - a custom set 
of extra-stiff shafted Wilson Staff bootlegs - was  a typical gag-job 
80 that included bogeys on four of the last five holes. A birdie on 
the 18th was all that prevented me from choking to death right there 
on the putting surface.

Anyway, clubs were checked in at Orlando International, may have made 
it to Cincinnati but definitely never arrived at the Portland Jetport. 
After three days they still hadn't shown up, so I called the contrite 
Delta baggage guy:

"They're gone, aren't they."

"Yeah, I'd say so."

Sad, but Delta was clearly forcing me to buy a brand new set of golf 
clubs, which I did, with their money: Tommy Aaron irons with stiff, 
graphite shafts; Big Bertha War Bird driver; Ping 3-wood; and a Ray 
Cook putter.

I will miss my Wesleyan golf bag, which contained several items of 
sentimental value including the five-year-old, orange Chanukkah 
lighter that refused to run out of fluid. Truly miraculous.

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia - Played my first legitimate, 18-hole round of 
night golf here at - are you ready? - Kelab Golf Sultan Abdul Aziz 
Shah. Pretty nice course actually; a hilly, smartly bunkered designed 
by Australians Peter Thomson and Michael Wolveridge. First round in 
the former British colony of Malaysia, too. But the cache lay in the 
idea of golf after dark: Tee time at 8:15 p.m ., drinks in the bar at 
12:30 a.m. Lights line the fairways and continually cast a distracting 
four shadows at all times. It is important to keep the ball away from 
dark, out-of-the-way places but the mandatory caddies are very good. 
They speed along on these special caddie buggies which hold two bags 
but no golfers, who are free to walk. The loopers also indulge in a 
fair amount of betting on players in the foursome. Interesting because 
it's instantly apparent when you've cost them money.

KAUAI, Hawaii - Played the newest addition to my personal top five 
here during my first-ever trip to America's 50th state. The Prince 
Course at the 45-hole Princeville Golf Club is sweeping romp through 
the canyons above Honalei Bay, where holes rise and fall 100 feet or 
more by turn and Peter, Paul and Mary smoked some really good weed 
apparently. With its gratuitous use of out of bounds stakes, tight 
fairways and trade winds blowing at their traditional 25-30 miles an 
hour, this Robert Trent Jones Jr. design can be downright 
Machiavellian - but still elegant, inconspicuously woven through a 
near jungle complete with waterfalls and lush ravines. Wow. I lost at 
least five golf balls and shot an 87, the scorecard for which I 
wouldn't sign under tournament conditions. But I had a great time! 
Sometimes, when I know I'm going to play an historic or scenic course, 
I bring along my camera but rarely do I take the time to use it. Many 
pictures of The Prince on file here in the Golf Course News/Herald 
Photo Archive.

Old friend George Howe, who met brother Matthew during his short stay 
at UMass-Amherst and later hung with Phresh & the Claymoss crowd, has 
resurfaced in San Diego. Out of the blue, George called me in February 
to report his stunning double-eagle ace at Steele Canyon Golf Club in 
Jamul, Calif., southeast of San Diego. For those of you unfamiliar 
with the ultra-rare double eagle, let's put this feat in perspective: 
A birdie is one-under par; an eagle is two-under; and a double-eagle 
(or albatross) is three-under par! A hole-in-one on a par-3 (a green 
you're supposed to hit in one shot) is rare, indeed. An ace on a par-4 
(a green you're supposed to hit in two shots) is damned near unheard 
of. Bravo, George! I played Steele Canyon, a 27-hole Gary Player 
design, in early 1993 while attending to Golf Course News business in 
Southern California. Howe recorded his double-eagle at the first hole 
on the Ranch nine - a downhill, dogleg right. George was so keyed up 
by his Herculean accomplishment, apparently, he whiffed his drive on 
no. 2... Now, that's the George I remember from Glen Ellen in Millis!
The Southern California lifestyle has done wonders for Howe's game. 
Always a big hitter who struggled around the greens, George reports 
shooting 78 the day of his double-eagle, which gave me the chance to 
mimic Herb Kenny, my golf coach at Wesleyan. I eagled a hole at our 
home course, Lyman Meadows, during a match with Central Connecticut 
and Trinity. I shot 79 in the process and was pretty pleased with it. 
When Herb heard about the eagle, he bellowed: "You had an eagle and 
only shot 79?"
