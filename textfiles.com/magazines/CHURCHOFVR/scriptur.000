	Hello World.

	My name is Pippin.  Not my real name of course.  About a year ago, i 
started MUDing.  This was probably not a good idea, because i suffered severe
sensory overload, and basically fried my brain, and got excluded from uni.
	On the trail of my sanity, i found a round Tuit.  i discovered doing
the things that i always wanted to do but never got around to doing.  One of 
those things was writing down all these THOUGHTS that had come to live in 
my mind.  And my friend said, hey we have a Religion here.  so the Jottings,
the map of my mind, are here with some additions from friends and other people
that i don't even know.  These are the Travelling Scriptures of the Church 
of V\R.
	The Scriptures are a living growing body, organism of thoughts.  This 
document may, in whole or in part, be copied, photocopied, reproduced,
translated, or reduced to any electronic or machine or human readable, or 
printed and posted in any postal system.  But the Church of V\R and Gaia2000 
retain the right to make any money out of this document.  We gotta eat somehow.
 
Anyone wishing to contribute to the feeding of these arrogant little bastards
can email me at: larysa.fabok@bbs.oit.unc.edu or if you are ever passing 
Nambour, Australia way drop me a line on (074) 411 053 for the THOUGHTS need 
company and like to be talked to.  And your thoughts can join our thoughts 
in the Grand Growing Body of the Church of V\R.  *slosh*

	So C U in Cyberspace someday.  I still MUD as Pippin.

*wave*

WHAT TO DO WITH THESE SCRIPTURES

There is every chance that you are reading a copy of a copy of... the original
Scriptures of V/R. They may well have been added to, compressed, decompressed,
edited, etc. This is OK. BUT: it will help the scholars of the future, when
they try to understand what happened to Planet Earth in the 1990s, to
distinguish the different editions of V/R floating around. Something somewhere
should indicate which edition this is that you are reading. If you make any
additions or amendments, please alter the edition name - to something that is
not likely to be duplicated by someone else. FOR EXAMPLE: The version you are
reading may say, "Scriptures Version 1.1". If you add some of your own work to
it, *don't* call the new version "Scriptures Version 1.2". Call it something
like "Traveling Scriptures of Church of V/R, Greg's Edition B" or "V/R
Scriptures, Version 3.14159 [from the disk of Vanessa]" or "Count Zero's Newly
Amended and Expanded Concordance on Virtuality/Reality" or *anything* that
will help the archaeologists of the 21st century to differentiate between the
billions of different editions they will have on their hands.

Also: Snail-mail contributions, communiques, etc intended for the Church
can be sent to:
      The Elder Gods
  c/o PO Box 1620
      Toowong, Q 4066
      Australia
As of this writing we don't have a stable email address, but you might try
Larysa.Fabok@launchpad.unc.edu (but don't expect a reply within 12 months).
  In particular, try to send us a copy of anything you add to the Scriptures.
Of course, if you're creative enough, you may decide that you don't want to
attach everything you come up with to the V/R mythos - that's OK. Start your
own religion. We'd still like to hear from you anyway. If you are so inspired,
you might mention our address somewhere in what you write.

Start a zine serializing your favourite parts of Scripture - this could be a
way to make quick $. Send copies and instructions to your favourite
celebrities and media personalities. Start a discussion group on V/R. Form
your own GAIA 2000 cabal and plot to take over your country/street/whatever.

IF you're on a network of some sort: keep your copy of the Scriptures in a
Scriptures subdirectory. Quote the Scriptures in your .sig, and mention both
the snail-mail address of the Elder Gods and an ftp site where the Scriptures
are kept. Try to get the Scriptures installed on every ftp site you can, and
maintain a list of people and places you know have heard of the Church of
Virtuality/Reality in some form. Start discussion areas on bbs's related to
V/R and GAIA 2000 and other such topics. Start Usenet newsgroups (example:
alt.religion.virtuality_reality or alt.religion.v_r, alt.gaia2000,
alt.fan.abulafia, alt.fan.dave.who.is.god). Assemble some gif's you think
might be eye-catching and relevant. Get V/R-related discussions going on your
newsgroups with local distribution (eg qut.chat, ky.misc, etc) - there will
always be people who haven't heard.

ALSO IF YOU'RE ON A NETWORK: Show as many of your non-net friends as possible
the wonders of networked computing. If you have the means, do something like
getting them into a real-time conversation with someone on the other side of
the planet. In short, *get them as hooked as you are*. The more people are
clamoring for net access, the more enterprises like CafeNet, BBS networks,
networks, SF NET, public Communications Centres, etc, are likely to take off.
Think of it this way: we're trying to reach everyone on Earth by December 2000
*at the latest* - and trying to get contributions from them - meaning
primarily intellectual contributions, although financial ones won't go astray.
Remember, these Scriptures are meant to be interactive - so while it's fine to
copy them and evangelize, it's just as important to *add something yourself* -
your Stray Thoughts - you could even write a searing critique of the nature
and intentions of V/R! Your informed criticism could be the one thing that
stops the juggernaut, or at least gives it a sense of direction.

We anticipate that techno culture will crossbreed with net culture, so: get
people to display gifs of V/R, Kibo, "Bob", etc at rave light-shows... write
some rap lyrics about us and put them in the public domain somehow... Etc.

!!!IMPORTANT!!! - *try to avoid reliance on what already exists*. If V/R makes
sense to you then you may get some enjoyment out of mentioning it to others,
propagandizing, making "in-jokes", etc, but this should soon turn stale. We
are trying to inform you and get you moving if you're not already doing so;
the best thing you can do is create, criticize... don't just consume! It would
be great to discover people taking V/R or V/R-inspired concepts in directions
we couldn't even imagine.

By the time you read this version it may have grown to an intimidatingly huge
size. Don't worry that anything you write will be lost, or that you cannot
hope to equal the standard already set. We have faith in you!

HOW TO READ THE SCRIPTURES OF V/R

Better understanding may perhaps be reached with the help of MUD or LSD.
  i) If you're running a MUD try installing a miniature version of the
Scriptures somewhere that people will read it. The concept of `virtuality'
will make sense much more quickly if encountered that way. A good starting
point is /abul/sthought.doc.
  ii) Reading the Scriptures in the course of a trip may help clarify those
`hard-to-understand' parts.

                                                Qix II

BECOMING A REGISTERED READER

You too can become a registered reader of the Travelling Scriptures of the
Church of V/R! Just send us something between $5 and $500 Australian and
we'll send you a little card saying `I am a registered reader', or something
like that. We might even send you something extra...

For a little more discussion, here is an interesting quote from _The Teachings
of the Holy Orthodox Church_, by Rev. Michael Azkoul, Ph.D. published by
Dormition Skete in 1986:

"The New Testament is not the only "scriptures." The nineteenth century Russian
Orthodox philosopher, Alexi Khomiadov (1804 - 1860), was right when he wrote
that there "are no limits to our Scripture and every writing which the Church
acknowledges as Her own is Holy Scripture.  Such pre-eminently are the Creeds
of the General Councils...wherefore the writing of Holy Scriptures has con-
tinued to our day, and if God pleases, yet more will be written." p.12 ibid.

So maybe we need to define what we mean by Scriptures?

Most of all, I hope that the living letters continue to be written...that is,
I hope we are all striving through the Power that dwells in us to live holy
lives.  This is the only Book that some will read.  It is the sign instituted
by the Lord so that the world may come to a knowledge of Him.

Peace in Christ, the Living Word, zane.
