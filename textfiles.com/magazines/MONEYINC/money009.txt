Ok, lets say you need a cell fone.  You want to reprogram it or just want to
rack up a big bill and stiff the local company.  Easier said than don, but
it can be done.  All you have to do is go to one of those stores like
Sears,  Radio Shack or Pep Boys that have obscenely cheap cell phones.  Then
all you have to do is buy the fone without service, right?  Wrong.

Most of these stores make you activate the fone on the spot.  If the company
they use to activate the fone is Cellular One, leave.  Cell One requires you 
to sign up for one full year.  (We can get around that one, but more on that
later.)  In the 717 area, we have Cell One and Sprint Cell.  Sprint only 
requires that you sign up for one month.  So all that you have to do is sign
up for the cheapest plan and cancel after the first month.  Total cost to you
will be $15 plus that cost of the fone.  Cheap cigarette lighter bag fones can
be gotten for less than 20 bux....plus since they're usually Motorola's they
are easy to reprogram.

Next all you have to do is show a drivers' license (fake if possible), fill
out an application and walk out an hour later with your activated fone.  Go
directly home and reprogram it or throw it in the closet or whatever.  Whatever
the case, do not use the fone with the stock ESN.  Why pay for your calls when
you don't have to?  After a few weeks, simply call the fone company, and
tell em..."Your service sucks...and I'm moving so cancel my service as of now!"
You are then free to do whatever you want with the fone....sell it, reprogram 
it, use it for a paper weight, etc.

Another variation is possible if you know a lot about a certain person who 
you want to fuck over.  Get a fake ID with their name, addresss, etc.  Fill out
the application as if you were that person, complete with job, SSN, etc.  Make
sure the information is correct as the cell fone company check the person's 
credit through CBI or Trans Union.  After you social engineer your way into a
fone, use it as much as possible within 2 weeks, as it won't take long to find
out that they're being scammed.  Then reprogram, throw away, sell or burn the
fone.  Just make sure you don't use it from the same place all the time.  If
possible, use it in your car, so the frequency can't be triangulated.

Yet another variation is possible if you are a member of a non-english speaking
minority.  (I have seen this one used very successfully in my stint as a Sprint
sales rep.)  Have a hispanic or asian friend go into the store and claim that
he's buying the fone for a non-eniglish speaking family member.  Have him use
a fake identity and get the fone.  Do this at several store using different 
identities, (preferably with good credit), and you will have several fones.
You can the proceed to call Tibet for free.  The guys who did this to us stuck
Sprint with $15,000 worth of calls to the Dominican Republic.  (As if they
were'nt dealing drugs.)

Just remember these points:

Well, if this works, get in touch with me somewhere and let me know.  Most
of these schemes have been tested and worked.  As a Sprint Sales Rep at a 
Sears store, I have seen these schemes work time and time again.  Some stores
have increased security as of late, but most haven't.  Best to try are smaller
department stores or auto parts shops...never try this at a cellular fone shop!
Also, try to do this on a busy day, so they don't have too much time to think
about you.

AND REMEMBER, IF YOU GET BUSTED, I ASSUME NO RESPONSIBILITY!!!!
