The topic of this article, is to briefly hash over the importance of good
forgery skills in a succesful con.  The laser printer can be the greatest
invention since sliced bread if you know how to use it right.

For example, say you are stuck without a car, and in order to get a car loan
you must produce a pay stub.  Unfortunately, you don't have a job.  Besides
worrying how to pay for the car you MUST have that pay stub.  Well, I will
teach you how to forge one in a few simple steps.  All you need is a pay stub
of some sort, to calculate the percentages of taxes.  Each state and/or 
country has its own tax rates, so these will vary.  Also, you must have a
stub from someone who makes close to what you are pretending to make, since
that has a bearing on Federal tax rates.

First, boot up Word Perfect, and select a nice simple font, preferably a Sans
Serif type, since most stubs are simple.  Next use shitty paper, no company
that has brains makes pay stubs on good laser stock.  Finally, make sure
the whole thing fits in an area the size of a check, or about 1/3 of a page.
Some places sell three part paper, and that would be great.  Make sure
you include: Address, name, social security number and year to date figures
for everything.

Next, if you wish you may make a photocopy of this and try passing that off
first, stating "I wanted to keep my stub, but I made you a Xerox of it.  Go
ahead and keep it."  This usually works, since all they do is make a copy 
and give it back!

Finally, do this at a loan company or car dealer far from your home, since they
most likely will not call long distance to confirm if you have a pay stub.  If
they do, just keep your cool and casually leave while they do it.  If they do 
it without you around, just claim you got fired or something.

If you follow these rules you'll be getting that credit that you deserve (and
can't afford!) in no time!  Till next time, remember the Money Inc Motto

WIN IF YOU MAY, LOSE IF YOU MUST, BUT ALWAYS, ALWAYS CHEAT!
