                            "Hack Ur Way 2 Hell"

     Hey folks, this issue of MYC Digest will give a brief overview of hacking 
the l8est craze in the H/P community.  I'm talking about hacking your way to 
hell, Taco Hell that is.  As many of u 3l33t3 know, Taco Bell has started 
offering pre-paid phone cards.  Well, the nice thing about these little phone 
cards that differs from most pre-paid cards is that once your limit has 
expired, the cards don't die! That's right folks, with a little help from our 
friends at TRW, you now have an alternative to the 1-800-SCAM-ATT line. 
Instead of using CALL-ATT to max out ur cardz on ld charges, you can call the 
taco hell 800 line, punch in a pre-paid card number, then, if there's no time 
left on the card, you can renew the time using a credit card!  "Why would I 
want to abuse Taco Hell and not ATT," you ask?  Well, 4 one thing, there's a 
hell of a lot more security on ATT's line than on Taco Bell's.  Even though 
it's still simple to card off ATT and not get caught, another advantage with 
using Taco Bell is better reception.  In my exchange, at least, I get better 
CPS through Taco Bell than through AT&T.  Well, have fun playing with Taco 
Bell, and I hope u've enjoyed this minor installment to the ongoing MYC saga.
