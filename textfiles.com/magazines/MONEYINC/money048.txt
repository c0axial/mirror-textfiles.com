TODAY'S TOPIC:  JAIL SUCKS! OR THE E.I.N. AND YOU

Well, just to let ya know why I have been so unproductive lately, not making
a MYC Digest in a few weeks, here's an update.

1.  I was on a cruise to Mexico (and you weren't!)
2.  I was getting laid (and you weren't!)
3.  I was trying to get a job
4.  I was in jail (and NO #2 had NOTHING to do with #4!)

Ok, now down to business.  This file is short, but can very very helpful in
your credit dealings.  If you have less than perfect credit, there IS a legal
way to get a new Social Security number, sort of.  All you have to do is
to go to a local IRS office and ask for the form to obtain an Employer
ID Number (EIN).  Then call the number listed on the back of the form and
request the EIN.  They will ask a few questions, and you MUST say you are
starting a business.  Doesn't matter what the business is, you are just 
getting a number to use for your social security number.  This EIN is 9
digits long, and can be used in place of the SSN.  Of course, you are 
supposed to inform the creditor that it's a EIN, but that's up to you.  And
an extra added bonus, if you decide to actually start a business, you can
use the EIN! (Wow!)  The catch is that you can only do this once (for each
identity you have anyways), so don't fuck up your new credit!

Well, that's it for now, have fun with your new found credit!  I hope I don't
go to jail again before I see you....and the mother fucker responsible for
my legal troubles....look out!
