Welcome to the Money Incoproated Textmag Issue Number 1!!!

     These mags are dedicated to spreding our right-wing views in the extremely leftist
world of computers.  Most cool anarchists, fortunately havent succumbed to the left
wing media, and followed the "Great Satan" Clinton.....well that gives a bad name to
Satan....maybe he's just a great asshole.  This is issue is dedicated to the animal
rights movement.  The companies that I'm about to list for you are out of a PETA
(People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) list of companies to boycott for their
testing of products on animals.  For this narrow-minded "put animals before people"
policy, they have become the first victim of Money Inc.  Give these companies your
business when possible, and maybe drop them a line letting them knwo that you still
stand behind them. Of course, if you're a weakling commie-pinko and want to boycott
them, you have the perfect right to....and you have the perfect right to fuck off!

   Anywayz, I will also give you the number of PETA, so you can harass them, wardial
them, CNA the number and find the house and firebomb it, etc.  The number is:
PETA +1 301 770 PETA (how fuckin original)
