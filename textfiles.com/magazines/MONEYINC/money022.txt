                        THE BIG CHEESE

Well, the new year is now upon us, and I'm glad 1994 is over.  Really 
sucked if you ask me.  Enough bitchingm on with business.  Today's
digest is going to tell you how to use your credit file to your advantage
and how to escape bad credit.  This has worked fairly well for me, and
should work for anyone, if you do it right, and don't try to get too brave.
As far as legality goes, everything here is probably legal, if not a bit
shady.  Best for you not to find out.


1.  Your Credit File, and why you should care about it.

Your credit file is the most important public record you have.  Without
credit you can't buy a car, home, stereo or even rent a video!  You also
need credit to buy computers, cash for beer, and rent hotel rooms...

Since credit is important, you must endeavour to keep your credit file
spotless.  If you have credit, pay the bills on time.  If you don't have
credit yet, worry not, for I have a list of places that are easy to get
credit at.

SLEEPY'S EASY CREDITOR LIST
1. Jewlery stores (fairly easy)
2. Gas Cards (they'll give a card to a dead man)
3. Department Stores (except Sears)

Once you get a card, make sure you pay the bill on time..if you don't you'll
have to refer to the next section.  After six months of payments on a small
card, you can then ask for a limit increase.  You may also be able to get a
Sears card.  After a year, you should be able to get a major credit card.
Once you get a major credit card, you will be set.


2.  Escaping the path of bad credit

Bad credit is a curse that will be with you for 7 or more years.  If
you cannot avoid it, there are a few ways around it.  These ways are fairly
shady and cannot be condoned by the author of this work >:>  However, for
informational purposes, I will let you in on the secrets.

First, I should warn you that you should never, never, NEVER, give money
to one of those credit repair agencies.  They will only cause you pain
and wallet-break.  Anything they can do can be done by a good hacker or
a good social engineer.  

The best way to escape bad credit is to give yourself a new identity.  Now
you don't have to change your name and move to another city, but you must
make up a new social security number.  There are several utilities out there
that can make up good numbers and I highly reccomend them.  Next, if you have
the means you should get a fake social security card and if your drivers'
license has the social security number on it, a fake license too.  You
may also use a fake address if you wish.  No PO boxes though, creditors do
not like them.

Next apply for a simple card and charge a few things, once you pay a payment,
then try for more.  You may do this just as if you were to be a whole new 
person.  Since the credit bureau has no record of your name and social 
security number being together, it should make a whole new file, as if you
were a new person.

Next, if you have a job, great.  But not all of us have the luck of having
steady employment.  This is where your handy, dandy inkjet or laser printer
will come in handy.  In the case a creditor asks for a pay stub, all you
have to do is make one.  Then make a bad photocopy of it, and use that.  
No need to worry about pay stubs though, only loan companies ask for them.

Epilogue:  Does this shit work?

While these techniques may not work for all of you, if your develop
your social engineering skills, you just might be able to get it to 
work.
