Well, it's been almost 6 months, but I can finally afford a new computer,
so I have returned to torment you once again!  I am back with a vengeance
and will do my best to restore the name to Money Inc. as the most hated
group around. >:>  Anyways, I'd like to thank CCRider and Sonic for keeping
the Money Inc. name alive in my brief absence.

By the way, I wasn't in jail or anything, just so broke I had to sell my
computer to pay bills!

P.S.  I seem to have lost my soft copies of the old Money Inc. texts, so
if you have em, please contact me at the following addresses....
