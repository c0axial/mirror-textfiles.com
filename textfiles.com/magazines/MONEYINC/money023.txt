TODAY'S TOPIC: THE NEW EQUIFAX CREDIT REPORT

Continuing with my in depth research of credit and credit bureaus, I have
come across the new equifax credit report.  Some of you might remember 
that equifax was at one time called CBI, and that CBI was the most popular
service for hackers to abuse.

Well, just for your information the data below is for information purposes
only, and if you could find a way to abuse them, you shouldn't. (Yeah 
right!)

BTW, this should be considered a sequel to my previous report on TRW.

>My notes will no longer be in arrows...<
Types of accounts are fairly easy, just remember:
O=open, no credit limit (AmEx)
R=Revolving, set limit
I=Installment

Timliness of payment:
0=too new to rate, or not used
1=Paid on time
2=30+ days late
3=60+
4=90+
5=120+ or collection accoutn
7=Making regular payments under wage earner plan
8=reposession
9=charged off

Remember, if any business can get your credit file, you have to understand
it to have the edge on them.  If you understand how to read your credit
report and use it to your advantage, you can get things easier than you
can possibly imagine.  Of course if you can hack a CBI account you can 
also use this knowledge to your advantage as well.
