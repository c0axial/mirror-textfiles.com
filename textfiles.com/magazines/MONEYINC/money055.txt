TODAY'S TOPIC - THE MYC CENSORSHIP MANIFESTO

Today's short lesson will be on the most heated Net argument since Cantor
and Siegel spammed their way into our hearts.  Censorship.

This article is long overdue, and with the latest incident at Compu$serve,
I feel it is time I let you all know the truth.  I will post this article
to some groups, so that more people will see it.

This is how censorship works, and why some forms are "acceptable."

Any time the governement takes away our right to say or do something, that
is censorship.  Any time a private company takes that right away it is still
censorship, but it is their right.  When another country asks the company to
do this, is is that company's option to do so.  These are undisputed facts,
but life is never that simple is it?

The C$ situation is compounded by the fact that C$ lied and say they cannot
geographically define the access to the groups.  The German government has the
rright to outlaw these things, and it should be none of the USA's business.
NNot all countries have a 1st amendment.  C$ has done a bad thing to its
ccustomers, but it is NOT a 1st amendment violation, as the Constitution says
that the GOVERNEMENT shall not violate these rights.  All disgusted C$ people
have to do is to get a REAL Net provider.  Simple, huh?

Finally, a few notes on my feelings about the groups that were cancelled.
Some of them are disgusting, some are not.  While I do not approve of
homosexuality, it is within the rights of people to practice the trade of
these files.  The child porn is along the same lines, except that it's illegal
in the USA, and in most other countries.  I have no problem with the
"censorship" of these groups in areas where it is illegal.

If I offend anyone with my rantings, fuck off.  Do not flame me, for I care
not what you think.  If you agree with me, feel good in knowing that you are
right.
