        As everybody knows, AT&T has implemented their 500 number system in
most parts of the country now.  This file will present a brief rundown on
the various features of the 500 numbers, why every hacker should have some,
and how to go about acquiring some 500 numbers.
        
        At&t's 500 numbers are designed to follow you around for life.  What
I mean is, even though you may move down the street, to another city, or even
to another state, your 500 number will always stay the same.  The 500 number
you receive will either forward your call to 1 party or to 3 parties.  If you
order the TRAVELER PACKAGE, you can forward the call to one party.  If you 
order the NAVIGATOR PACKAGE, you can forward the call to up to three parties.
The NAVIGATOR package works like ringdown.  It will try one number, and if
it rings or there is no answer, then it will try the second number, and so on.
The nice thing about the 500# call forwarding is that you can program the 
numbers from any touch tone phone, even on the road, unlike most regular call
forwarding where you must program the forwarded number from your house.

        Why would a hacker be interested in these new numbers?  Well, aside
from the obvious beeperless call forwarding feature, you also receive a PIN
and reverse billing PINs.  Through the use of the PIN, these numbers also
act as calling cards.  You can bill outgoing calls to the 500# by entering
your PIN, and you can allow other people to bill calls to you using the 
reverse PINs (like 3rd party calls).  AT&T has successfully incorporated a few
popular phreak utilities into one easy to use menu driven number!!!  Thank
You, At&t!

        To acquire a 500 number, you must find some residences where you can 
easily monitor the incoming mail.  Beige Box the line and dial "0".  You
need to do this because in order to have a 500#, you must be an At&t 
customer.  If you dial "0" and get a sprint or mci operator, try another 
house.  Get the name and address of the person who owns the house.  Beige Box 
the line and dial 1-800-MY-ANI-IS.  This is MCI's convenient little ANI line
for employee use.  Write down the number it reads back.  Now, dial 
1-800-878-3500.  You will get AT&Ts TRUE CONNECTIONS menu.  Press "1" to
inquire about the personal numbers, then, if I remember correctly, you have to 
press "1" one more time.  Tell the operator you want a personal number.  
She'll ask for your number, name and address.  Give her the number of the 
line you are calling from, the address of the house, and the name of the 
person the line is registered to (remember, you must be an AT&T customer, and 
they will check this info).  That's it!  Now just watch the mail, and steal 
anything that comes from AT&T.  They will send out the number and PIN, and 
bill the person $1 for the number (in September, the price jumps to $5 a 
month for the Traveler and $7 for the Navigator).  Now you're set! Start 
billing calls to your newly acquired 500#.  More than likely, the $1 charge on 
the phone bill will go unnoticed, so you'll have at least 1 month to use and 
abuse the line.  Inside sources say Sprint and MCI will soon offer their own
500#s, so be on the lookout for an update soon!
