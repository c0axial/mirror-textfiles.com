TODAY'S TOPIC:  THE ABC'S OF FRAUD PART ][

Ok, here's the final 13 scams to help you be as cool as us in MYC, the world's
premier scam group!

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
$ N - 900 NUMBER SWINDLE $
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

Well, this one's really simple.  Just have a 900 number set up through Don
Lapre or some other such service, and offer as a "free prize" a great diamond
necklace.  Then send the sucker a $2 cubic zircon!  You can charge up to
$50 for the call.  People are suckers for free prizes.  You can attribute the
$50 call charge to "those crooks at the fone company!"

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
$ O - Obituary Scams $
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

Use the obituary to find a widow.  Then call her up and say that her husband
had bought some gold inlayed bible or some other crap.  Then you can charge
tons of cash, and based on emotion, she will buy.  Say something like, "He
only wanted the best for you...too bad he died before he could see the look
on your face..."  Like I said, emotion sells.

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
$ P - Pigeon Drop $
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

Act like you found a bag of money and offer to split it with the person if
they give you $500 to post bond at the police station for the money.  Then
take the money and run.  Easier than picking up an ugly chick.

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
$ Q - Quackery Illusion $
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

Yes, we have one for Q!  This is a variation on the old fountain of youth
crap.  Offer a cure for cancer and ask for $29.95 for more info.  Then send
and advertisemnt for your $500 vitamins.  Kill two birds with one stone, eh?
Again, target old folks, they fall like crazy for any chance at life.  And
don't forget to advertise in the Weekly world news, and the Enquirer.

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
$ R - Rare coin deception $
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

Since most people don't know shit about coins or stamps, they can be ripped
off easily.  Sell worthless silver coins at 3 or 4 times the actual value.
This scam can also be done with basball cards or any thing else that has
potential to go up in price.  Just make sure it doesn't, or you'll end up
looking stupid!  People are suckers for any chance at making big bucks 
and silver is viewed as a good investment, when actually it's not.

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
$ S - Special this week rug cleaner hoodwink $
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

You have to get an appointment to go to the person's house.  Do this by
offering cleaning for $14.95 a room.  When you get there, make any excuse
to raise the price.  Bigger rooms, dirty carpet, pet stains, anything to get
more cash.  You can usually leave with $200 or more.  This one requires good
high presure sales skills, but it is legal (somewhat) and will pay off!

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
$ T - Transfer to a living trust dupe $
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

Offer your "expert" services to set up a living trust, which is basically
a will, to "keep those greedy lawyers from taking you childrens' money
when you die."  Since people don't trust lawyers, they will pay you upwards
of $1000 to prepare a meaningless document that lawyers will contest anyway.
Doesn't matter anyway, if you do your job, they won't have any money left
anyways!

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
$ U - Unclaimed property trick $
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

Go to the local courthouse and find records of recently deceased people. 
If these people have any unclaimed property you can charge ridiculous
amounts of money to claim this property for the family.  Since, they don't
know the stuff exists, you can get up to 50% of the value for the property.
In most states this is legal, but check.  Some states have a 5% limit on
finders' fees.  Still, you could make a few bucks there too...legally.

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
$ V - Vitamins Scam $
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

Yet another scam to sell vitamins at ridiculously high prices...with a twist.
Offer "one of four great prizes!"  The one of four scam is the oldest in the
book.  You can offer a new cadillac, a home entertainment center, a trip to
Vegas, and a diamond necklace.  Of course everybody wants those prizes, so
the eagerly buy $500 worth of vitamins.  You claim that if they buy, they
won't have to pay tax on the gift, which would be more than $500.  They will
eagerly snap up your vitamins and you promptly send them that $2 cubic
zircon "diamond" necklace.  Of course nobody ever gets the other prizes.

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
$ W - Work at home opportunity $
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

Offer $500 a week for stuffing envelopes.  Place the ad in some papers and 
then charge $30 for info.  Wait for your money then either send nothing,
or send info on how to place ads telling people to work at home.  So
to make money, the must perpetuate the scam.  Weird twist eh?

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
$ X - Xenophobia scam $
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

How bout that I came up for a name for X...damn, I'm good.  This one, you
claim to be a cop, and offer to mark the valuables for security purposes.
You then go to the house of the person and use a handy engraving gun to
do this.  Now you can either case the house for later reference, or you
can outright steal the stuff, saying your gun broke and you have to take
it to the station for engraving.  Then never return.  You might wanna refer
to my earlier file on fake ID's for a place to get a a fake police ID.

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
$ Y - You dented my car! $
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

Since old people can't drive, claim that one of em hit your piece of shit
car in the parking lot.  Then offer to settle out of court without calling 
the cops for $500.  They will usually pay, since they don't wanna lose their
license or have to pay more insurance.  Easy as pie.

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
$ Z - Zircon Necklace scam $
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

Call up saying that "you have won a $750 necklace.  All you have to pay is
a $75 mounting fee."  Since they think they are making out anyways, they'll
pay.  Then you send that infamous $2 cubic zircon crap.  Once again, the
mooch mentality can be preyed upon by a slick MYC trained con artist.

Well, that's it for this file.  But remember, besides using this info to 
rip people off, use it to avoid getting ripped off.  I just might end up
calling YOU someday saying "Congratulations, you have just won...."  You
should say "Get bent asshole....because of Money Inc, I'm on to you mother
fucker!"  Then I'll know I've actually made a difference....NAH!
