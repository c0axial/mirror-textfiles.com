TODAY'S TOPIC: LAME GROUPS
BY: SLEEPY

   Today's scene is in trouble.  Lame couriering groups are out there acting like they
have some pull and getting a lot of sysops to give them disable ratios on really fast
boards.  In return they promise to send that sysop all of the new XXX group releases.
These releases nevr amount to anything more than 10 different versions of the same lame
/X utility.  Now, don't get me wrong, /X utilities can be fun to a sysop, but the scene
in genereal can't use em.  This has to be stopped at once, if the scene is to flourish
in these slow days....especially on the Amiga front.

   TODAY'S STORY:  HOW I GOT SCREWED BY XXX GROUP (NAME DELETED TO HIDE THE LAMENESS OF
                   THE COOL PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE GROUP)

   I was recently on my local board, chattin with the sysop, who is a personal friend
of mine, when the leader of a "Nationally famous" group asked me if I wanted to join.
He said I would get dissyed ratios on all of the group boards.  Now I really didn't
ever try to courier for a group, but I thought "Hey, free warez...maybe I can help out
my friend the local sysop...what the hell...  Several weeks passed and I couriered
uneventfully for a while, moving wimply little /X utils and small shit.  One day I
called the USHQ of this group...the sysop, who seemed cool said "Hey here's a 0 minute
release....try it out and spread it..."  Cool, I thought, make a name for myself...I
then proceeded to call 4 or 5 boards and spread the file...no prob...then I tried the
game.  It didn't work...my luck exactly.  No prob again, next day a cool group released
a patch for that game and it worked for me.  Next problem, the game sucked.  It was
supposed to be a CD32 AGA release.  The game was some shitty ECS crap from 1989!  Not
to mention a BAD one....oh well, better luck next time I thought.  No such
luck...within 12 hours the group had realeased a text claiming not to have realeased
the game, and (luckilly for them) my name was not mentioned in the file.  Finally, I
was booted from all their boards...what a fuckin crock!!!!  So, as my mission, I am
here to inform you, the users and sysops, about groups that aren't known to you.  Check
'em out.....ask around.....and if they're not doing shit for your board...BOOT EM!!!!

Well, thats it for this time...NO POLITICS THIS TIME....WHAT A MIRACLE FOR A BIGOTED
SCUMBUCKET LIKE ME!!!!  :)  I HOPE THIS FILE DON'T GET NUKED :)

TILL NEXT TIME...IF YOU DON'T LIKE WHAT YOU READ HERE, AND I'M SURE SOME OF YOU KNOW
WHO I REFER TO, FUCK OFF!!!!  IF YOU CAN'T TAKE A LITTLE CRITICISM, YOU DON'T DESERVE
TO BE ON THE SCENE!!!!
