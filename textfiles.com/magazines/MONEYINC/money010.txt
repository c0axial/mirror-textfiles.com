Ok, let's say you suck.....you really suck.  You should kill yourself, but you
don't have the balls to do it.  Everyone you know hates you, and you are 
virtually worthless.  As a last resort, you decide to card a life!!!  You don't
care if you go to jail, and if you get away with it, you can start over in a
new town with a new identity.  Let's get started!

First, you'll need to get a LOT of card numbers...maybe some plastic, if at all
possible.  The more cards you get the better.  Say you get 200 cards from your
local CBI.  The next step is to mug a few people, break into houses, cars or
anything else you can to get plastic.

Next, if you can, use these accounts to card money into a Swiss bank account
to buy yourself a house.  After the house, it's all downhill...here's a list
of the things you could card....

1:  A wife from one of those buy-a-gook-wife-so-she-can-become-a-citizen service

2:  Pets from your not-so-local pet store....

3:  Groceries from your not-so-local grocery...

4:  Cash advances for drugs...

5:  Home furnishings, stereo equipment...

6:  Clothing...

7:  Anything but computers, jewelry or guns...these are the most watched items.

Just remember, if you get caught, you can still kill yourself...hey...at least 
you tried.  And remember, if you do actually try this, you will get caught! 
This is just a joke...and if you can't laugh at it, then fuck you!
