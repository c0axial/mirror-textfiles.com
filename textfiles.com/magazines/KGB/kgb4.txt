        For a while now, PaX has had his line disconnected for reasons
 unknown. His parents might be narqs, so look out. HE wanted us to have his
 parents line turned into a payphone, so only he could use it, using a redbox.
 But then again he msged me when I was /away so who knows. SO I'm stuck
 writing KGB on my own for a while. In fact, I haven't seen many KGB members
 at ALL around. So lonely, so lonely.......

        Well, since the release of KGB 2, we have gotten some reviews(well,
 just TWO) that are not so wonderful. U4EA said this magazine makes him puke,
 and that it's not even funny. Coming from BoW's phearless leader, that's a
 compliment :). U4EA of course has had to drabble

             (10 PRINT "on and on and"
              20 GOTO 10)
                                                  on how much he hated
 KGB/ROLSSAA. bUT who the Phuck CareZ? I don't Care if some d00dz thInk this
 is an IMitation of BoW. Geez, what about CDC? For the record, your mag wasn't
 the first parody of existing zines out there. Hell, WHO KNOWS OR CARES who
 parodizes what? If you've ever seen LameNESS(from 612), their magazines are
 a total takeoff on existing warez pirate magazines. Better yet, check out
 Pizza Underground Digest. That was yet another parody magazine. BoW is not
 serious. Maybe they should accuse YOU of imitation!! KGB is not sErIoUs. IRC
 is not R3al LiFe. Life is not SeRiOuS. All this magazine is a bunch of
 electrons. If you hate this magazine, just delete it off of your hard or
 floppy drive so you can make room for warez. If you like this, you must be on
 something. Can't you tell I'm not being serious with the articles I write(but
 hey, watch out for ******) or the way I even edit these damn things? It's all
 just for fun, and for the fact that I am bored as hell.

         CaN't We All JuSt GeT aL0/\/g? KanT We b33 all In One Gr00p,
         PreFrably 0n3 that D0ez ANS33 art?????


        W3ll I'm writing this shortly after KGB 2, cuz it's never too
 late to start off on a new issue.

        I admit before you all, I don't know much about phreaking or hacking
 or what not. So far, technology hasn't made a metric guage that measures
 just how much Hack/phreak knowledge one has, and there will never be one.
 I'm only interested in this hobby(R E P E A T :   H O B B Y ) because it
 gives you a chance to explore around without leaving your house in this
 growing world of technology. I'm not planning on making it a career, or
 anything.

        So you might think to yourself "Wait a minute. This kid admits that
 he doesn't know much about H/P, but he decides to write a magazine?
 I fail to see the logic. Pass the nachos." Well, there's absolutely no rule
 saying I, or anybody else CAN'T write an ASCII magazine. I've seen a lot
 of h/p related mags out there, and a lot of them are alike, but they
 have their individuality. You know what? I haven't seen 'em, but there are
 also a lot of porno movies out there. And just as you'd expect to see
 fucking, butt-fucking ,titfucking, blow jobs, eating out, and plenty of other
 neat things, you'll expect to see how-to's on hacking, phreaking, news,
 updates, blow jobs, and lists of neat numbers to dial and systems to telnet
 to. Well, maybe not blow jobs, but you get the point. So if you're saying
 this is just another magazine, you're absolutely right. You win a cookie.
 So go on and read any magazine you like, even this one, and have a good
 night.
        
        So you also might think to yourself "Why did this guy start a group
 anyway? Where are those nachos I asked for?" Why not? NO really. There was
 probably a better reason. Well, how about they have a group out there that's
 FRIENDLY and greetz you with open aardvarks. THere is yet another reason
 why, but I'll tell you that later.

        Oh, this doesn't matter to you, but there's a lamer that insists on
 using my nick, even though it's >>MY<< nick. heh. I'm the REAL D-FENS dammit!
 He doesn't even capitalize it right. He uses D-Fens. Most of the time
 his little IRC buddies message me in some foreign tongue. Maybe I should
 message back "adlfkajiju vnapsnfpn vnvnyyuknuyknyuk lukku" or "leave me
 alone. fuck off" in whatever language he/she uses. I fingered his account
 and here's what I got.

***************************************************************************
********************* 1. #PhReAk has reached GNU lows *********************
***************************************************************************

 (or, The Great Op Wars of '94)

 Alright, things are REALLY getting bad on #Phreak. I mean,
 it was bad since the beginning of the new year(when BoW took
 over. ha j/k), but now it's hit a new step of lameness. The channel
 has now degraded to #warez, where ops to them are their life-support-
 systems on cyberspace.

        1. Well, for starts, bots have infested #phreak. Hell, the channel
           was already too lame withOUT bots on it. PhReQbOt was the first
           and most annoying bot ever. BadS in the UK runs it, and insists
           on keeping it up. Of course, he doesn't care or doesn't know
           that it gets phucking kicked/banned on a daily basis. The only
           time it gets ops is when BadS gets on, which is usually in the
           morning, USA time. When PhReQbOt gets kicked, he comes back on.
           Kick him again, he comes back on. It'll keep trying to get
           in until it's not banned, which is rare. You ask for a help
           file on the damn thing, and it claims there's none installed.
           I also had werd that there was a list of PhrEak d00d'z #s
           on a filename called 'Dudez'. It was supposedly on for four
           days. Were you on it? who knows. but it wouldn't be cool if
           YOu were on it, eh? Bot Wars! WHO WILL WIN!??!???!?!?!?
                           (there are no winners. only losers.)
                           (and god is this badly edited)

        3. SCRIPT WARS. WHO WILL WIN?????????
                Well, for starters, anyone running TextBox will
         get someone nick collided if they change their nick. That's really
         phucking pathetic. Wow. It's funny to watch entire channels
         fluctuate since everybody's scripts are fighting with each other.
         Yeah, gotta get those zero day scripts. It's no different than
         #warez, #warez2, or #warez90210. And nothing's more informative
         than having a PAGE full of script messages saying someone's hacked
         those precious ops on the almighty #Phreak channel. And then someone
         will have a script to kick those d00dz who are running TextBox
         and are recovering netsplitters who originally had ops since it
         would accuse them of being Neo-Nazi Netsplit Ops Hackers.
         You can't hack ops man, you must earn them, sonny.

                You know, watching the op wars go by is like that old
         computer simulation called Life(no, the board game). Each op is a
         dot, and then they op their friends, and then THEY op their friends,
         and so you get a little loose web of ops. Then you get two
         people who hate each other, and then A deops B. But then A gets
         deopped by C, who is friends with B. Then he reops B and then
         kicks A. Then D deops A, B, and C just because he feels like
         being an ass, and so on and so on.............


        4. YOUR C0DEZ OR YOUR LIFE!
         SOme dude and a few others took over the channel, and only would
         give ops out to people who gave them k0dez. This is the most
         malicious act of IRC terrorism we've seen since the BoW take0vers.
         (just kidding :) Plus its simply pathetic. How dare you guys take
         our life-giving ops away and only would give them back if G1V3n
         K0DEZ!!!!? HAVE YOU N0 DECENCY??!?!?!?!?
         Okay, calm down. Just keep saying to yourself "It's just IRC.
         It's Just IRC." Whoa. okay. I feel better now. WHAT IF YOUR
         M0THER FOUND OUT ABOUT Y00 DOING THIS ON IRC????? NOOO!!!

                Hi, this is Kentucky Phreaked Chicken breaking in...
                D-FENS is a little upset over that whole ordeal so I'll
                wrap up this artikahl for now. Later. ANd be sure never
                to fuck with those mode changes on #phreak.

                                - K. F. C.



                BUt remember:
                                1. It's just a god damn letter combonation
                                   for a channel on IRC.
                                2. And as y00-four-eee-ahh says,
                                   "IRC is not real life" or something like
                                   that.
                                3. Who cares? IRC is the ultimate time
                                   killer, but it is the ultimate waste
                                   of time (and aych dee space).

Note: This just came hot off the press, and this has probably already been
      distributed alone by now, but who cares. ParadoX asked me to put it
      in KGB 3, and I was so overwhelmed that I did. This also might be
      the very phirst artikahl on KGB that's actually worth reading.

:DATE & TIME'z Aprox :> 5/11/94 at 5p.m. thru 5/12/94 ending at 7a.m.

TELCO AbuZed := Connex

        We'll call this one the Paradox files since it was our faithful
pal -Paradox- himself that started this devious c0nf. to begin with... ;)
        
        The c0nf was set up in "Meet-Me" style. For the record, the number
is/was "800-237-0767" and the c0nf pin number is/was "3461" the c0nf's info
was distrubuted to the regulars on IRC around 5pm on the date of May 11th,
1994. Of course plently of lurkers were about as expected on any Meet-Me style
Alliance.. The c0nf was your pretty basic lame B.S. type o pattern till
around 10 or 11pm that night when we decided to call up random SCC stations
and see what we could achieve. We didnt use the normal get some krad info by
posing as an SCC offical. We changed the rules to the game and for some reason
most likely of pure boredom invited the Michigan SCC coordinator to join our
Meet-Me.. This fellow seemed more like the janitor type for an SCC station.
Instead of being some pompus ass he just almost acted as though he didnt
know what the hell we were doing trying to force feed him the 800 dial up to
the Meet-Me and then when we gave him a pin for it that seemed to fry his
brain for sure..;) Anyhow after that we waited for the SCC to arrive (if they
did they never informed us of their Lurking nature).. So as we again went into
a hybernating state I (xtactic) got the hair brain idea to mess with the
"American Justice Federation" (some private org. based out of Indianapolis,
IN).. Here's their info before I go into detail:

        American Justice Federation
        3850 S. Emerson Ave., Suite E
        Indianapolis, IN 46203
        VMB     :(317) 780-5200
        Fax/BBS :(317) 780-5211
        Orders  :(800) 749-9939
        Note : Linda Thompson is the person to chat with.

        Ok now, we first called the Voice Mail Box number which is quite a
blast to listen to. It's has radical information about some type of hidden
cover up about the WACO Texas incident and something about a MILITIA they
say will intervene at Washington, D.C., Monday, September 19, 1994 armed and
in uniform to deliver some type of Ultimatum?  Well we're just going to have
to get more info about this radicalist group of people. We did hassle their
Interview Option on the VMB trying to get them to join us on our Meet-Me as
well but they never publicly arrived. Almost forgot, we did send a complete
sent of Videos to some CC holder about what this group does.. ;) Cost damn
near $200 for a set of 4 videos! (Woah!) All about some WACO cover-up... We
did call the local FBI in IN, but they could neither confirm nor-deny having
any knowledge of this org. ( right ;( )....so ppl go check THEM OUT!
        Now back to the Meet-Me other than the [WWP] = WACKY WACO PEOPLE ;)
Shortly after hastleing the VMB and CC Order number we got a unique fool
claiming to be an official of the telco comp. we were using (this in the end
proved to be true)... Anyway the tactics this sucker used were incredibly
stupid!... First we asked for their supervisor which in turn they seemed to
reply with... We know this is a Fraudulent Conference and that we were all
busted and has better well, the way he put it, "Fear for our Lives!" After
that, Shatter jumped in and rambled off that he was the conf controller and
that he was in question to this operators accusations. The operator requested
that Shatter, now callling himself John Gliberson (something stupid like
that) and gave off some random phone number and Company name which in turn the
conf. operator replied to us with a laugh and "Nope sorry son, that's not
correct!" We all stayed silent for a few mins after that and I swear you could
hear it seemed like three to maybe even five people in a conf. room that
forgot to hit mute on their ATT speaker phone ;) ... We heard them laughing
and parading about how we requested to talk to a supervisor... Then we just
decided to forget whatever our weird and wacky conf. operators were doing and
cont. to chat about what the fuck was going on!! We got most excellent
comments from, we'll call 'em the GUY, since it was always this one
mellow-toned operator or tech (dweeb) that chatted with us (chatted ='z
directed ;) ).. so GUY comes on and says "We GOT U GUYS!" Our reply was "Oh
no! We're all dead for sure now! NOT!" This seemed to upset GUY.. He just shut
up and this time from us commenting on how the phone seemed to not be mutted..
He successfuly Mutted the phone. So now knowing that he was contemplating what
to do next, we just couldn't figure out what was up... Any other company would
have just booted us off! Or at least prevent others from joining the conf. but
nope it only being about 11pm/12am CST people could still call in and join the
Meet-Me that btw was supposed to end at 11pm EST that night! So we started to
get the idea this operator was a poser. Just some fool that called in. (just
for the rec. he was really an operator) We started to come up with all types
of senarios on how this guy could be posing... I mean c'mon it was a Meet-Me
without any form of tone in when a person added in... LurKer'z had it MADE! ;)
The only thing we couldnt figure out is that GUY was the only person that
sounded clean and clear! Crystal CLEAR! .... This kept us on guard... So we
thought now that we have an audiance we might as well toy with it! ;)... We
started rambling about ANI for a bit when guess who pop'z in with a comment?!
Why GUY of course!.. GUY: "We got All U Guys! Once U hang UP we GOT YOUR ANI!"
then he shut up again!... Now we all knew that ANI didnt work the way this
operator seemed to think it did...But we definately had to be pissing this
GUY off since we instantly came up with the conclusion that these guys have a
real shitty system that has some type of weak CALLER ID type system that would
log when the CALLER came IN and LOGGED OUT but only after we disconneted. What
was funny was this GUY confirmed our suspitions by saying GO ahead HANG UP!
We'll call ya right Back "WE GOT YA GUYS!" This didn't prove to be so true
since they only would call back a few of us LineNOISE being one of them.
He called the Meet-Me back to tell us that some guy did call him but all they
said was "GOT YA!" and LineNOISE said it sounded just like this GUY dweeb...
Hmm.. now either someone was playing a killer prank on us and knew some of our
phone numbers from past Alliances...or these GUYS were pathetic!
        Well Its about 2am/3am now and the conf. is still wide open, no bars
whatsoever!  We couldn't figure out still why these supposed operators didn't
just cut the power or something! We started to mention different ways to get
rid of pheakz and sure-a-nuff shortly afterwords we started getting TONE
BLASTED by 2400Hz and 2600Hz tones... They did kick a few of us off since they
must'a had some shitty bridge system.. or thought we might be on something
sim...That lasted for oh maybe tops 15-20 minz...But we being determined now
stayed on and some of us jumped on IRC to invite the WORLD! We jumped on every
channel with 15+ people online... It was about 4am/5am CST, not many people
publicly said anyting but you could tell we had a new bunch of LurKerz
online. By now we were all pretty worn out and I myself started to lag away,
shit its been over 12hours with this sucker! ;)..The c0nf was quite calm at
this time since all the tone-boyz and lurkers were silent to say the least...
        Ahhh, Damn let me rap this story up for ya ppl'z! ;) At about ohhh
6am/7am the c0nf went manual: every time someone called in it was now operated
by a receptionist. but we could still get it ;)... around 7am/8am the c0nf
was finally terminated! (w0ah!) and still right now as I'm finishing up this
text file being : 5/13/94 at 1:30pm CST... the "800-237-0767" Connex place
is still in manual receptionist mode but there'z no receptionist! ;) Hmm...
I just wonder what that TELCO'z Bill'z Gunna BE LIKE!!! L8r'z! g'night!

        Yeah this was a great conference. I got to meet CyberLink. About
 3 years ago I managed to get his VMB #, so I left a msg. I wasn't really
 into H/P back then, but it was a start at least. HE remembered the MoJo
 line, which was one of the coolest code lines ever. Trust me, this was
 professionally made. Sounded EXACTLY like a disc jockey was doing it.
 Obnoxious voice, sound effects, everything. When I called it, the message
 left was mainly about not giving away codes, since they will instantly die
 from overuse. I even taped it for kicks. Who knows, I might be able to
 find it and put it to a .VOC file. Another code line I called was your
 plain-jane average Joe one. It was some guy named Dr. Dre(I think), and
 he left about 20 'greets go out to' and some uninteresting numbers.
 That was nowhere near as cool as the MoJo line.
        CyberLink also mentioned the "I hate Touch Tones" code line. He
 said that some drug dealer(who was interested in H/P) named Raoul(whatever
 its spelled!) ran it. Some other guy knew all of his inpho and mentioned
 that if you fucked with him, he'd send some of his guys out to get you.
 Heh. Why does that sound so phamiliar? OHH I know why! Ka0s threatened
 Shatter once and wanted to shoot him dead. Of course, trying to instigate
 the whole matter was hilarious. They both didn't live in the same state,
 and ka0s was trying to make travel arrangements. "okay, I think I can
 make the 2 o'clock flight next Thursday then, then I'll FUCKING SHOOT
 YOU DEAD!!!!! Will you be free that day?"

    Haha. OH boy.

As you may have read my artical in KGB#2, I was aliased PotHead, but I
decided to come out of the closet. My last artical was lame, but thanks to
the superb editting (boot-licking action) it came out really funny. This is to
more of a serious tone, so, read away.

     Lately, I've been voice talking with a few people who work for the
Telco and who've been busted by AT&T. If you've been doing ANY type of
phreaking lately, there's a chance you'll get a call down the road (the
general idea is NOT to get caught, but). But don't fret, my pet, because there
is much hope in sight. They can call you, harass you, and down right
threaten you to confess, but don't. I repeat, do NOT confess to ANYONE.
Recently, a good IRC friend of mine (if you're an aardvark, you know him and
what he did) got busted for third-number billing to a loop in Canada. They
wrote him a letter, and he called them up and complained. Somehow, they got
him to crack, and they posted a logging machine on his numbers that log all
incoming calls, and all outgoing calls. According to another IRC friend of
mine, (a telco employee, no less) they have no proof that you did it,  and
their only chance of catching you is to get you to confess.

DON'T CONFESS-

    They can harrass 'till they're bl00 in the face, but remember these
all important things if you are interrogated:

A: You have rights, don't let them bully you around. When they ask you a
question, put it right back in their face.
Ex: (PHED) Why did you bill to that company?
    (PHREAKER) Ask AT&T, they billed them.

B: Don't act like you know what ANI is, or how ESS works, because then they
know you did it, and it makes them push harder to make you confess.

C: Even though they have your number in the logs and other phed stuff, those
are not admissable as evidence in a court of law, for there are millions of
miles of phone lines, and literally millions of boxes (not the red ones, the
silver ones used for beige boxing) out there.

D: Don't give in.  If they bill you(which they won't), sue them

E: Make friends with lawyers, and have the lawyers harass the telco for
harassing you.

F: Don't be scared, okay, I know, that's easier said than done, but don't
ACT scared.

G: Corporate Security is a joke. They have no authority. Do not let them scare
you.

H: If they take up your time (which they will), say, "I have homework to do,
leave." or, "I have go to work." or, "You're wasting my fucking time."

 ***********************[ 5. Notes from Andy Rooney ]***********************
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

         - Have you ever noticed that the K-rad Warez you download
           NEVER work? Why do they waste my time? Is it just for
           upload credits?

         - Why is it that the only mail that the president at
           president@whitehouse.gov only responds to are death threats?
           I wanted to talk to him about world issues, but he
           never wrote back!

         - Why is it every time I get on an AT&T meetme, there's always
           those people who absolutely have to hit the touch tones
           on the phone?(most of the time it's zero. Freud might conclude
           it as a sexual inadequacy problem, with 0 representing the
           amount of times he or she has had sexual contact. Who knows).
