*********************[ 1. RAINY DAY PROJECTKZ ON IRC ]*********************
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

       Let's face it, IRC can really fucking be boring sometimes. I mean,
  there's a limit to having netsex with some chick named B1gB00bz,
  couriering 100 megabytez of WaRez for Your Gr0up(not this one, yet) on
  #warez, being /KILLed by irc operatorz for saying shit like "I'm G01nG 2
  kill your Cat if You dOnt OP ME!@" or whatever the hell you do. So
  here are some K-rAd ideas to try out if you're bored at 3 am and
  don't want to bother with studying for that test yoh have in 5
  hours. Make sure you only do this with your legit account. That
  shows 'em you really have balls to the community. DOn't evne Bother
  with that account on irc.nsysu.edu.tw. it's too lagged anyway.

  1. Join #francais and say "you French faggots!"
          No, wait, sorry about this one. that idea was
          submitted by my 10 year old brother.

  2. Join #deutsch as Hitler and say "Ich habe keine
          Deutschlande!" or say something cool in German.
          (alirght, FUCK the countries)

  3. Join #blaklife if you're not one of the 1000 sites that
          aren't banned.
     a. Get a nick of Fahrrakan(or however you spell his name.
          I'm still pissed at him for him calling me a white
          devil!) and preach in all uppercase LetTerz
     b.Get a nick of Malcolm_X and do some MORE preaching,
          by any means neccesary.
     c.Get a nick of M-L-K and do even MORE preaching!!!!

                 - or if you have the MOST ballz -

     d. get a nick of BillCosby and ask if anybody has some
          coke or Jell0. Jell0 is more eleet than ANY warez you
          can find on IRC. and there IS plenty of warez on iRC.
     e. get a nick of MIchaelJackson(good luck on fittnig this
          in, heh). and ask if there are any little boyz on there.
          if no luck, just go to #gaysex or #teensex and repeat
          this step over again.

  4. Join #palestine as Allah or whoever you can think of and say
          'YOU WILL ALL DIE' or the like.

  5. Join #gaysex, and, er, ahh why beat a dead horse.

  6. Change your nick to something like 'MuscleBabe' or 'Butch'
          and get on #lesbians. Try to get some.  :)

  7. Get on #hack and try THESE!
     a. say "AnyBOdy GoT any AcCountS on CrimeLab.COM?"
     b. say "Are ThEre Any REal HAcKERZ on HERe or Just A
          BunCH of FaGGotz?"
     c. say "ThiZ is the SeeeKret SerViCE and I've GOt All
          OF You GUYZ INphO and You're ALl Under ARRezt!"
     d. ask if anybody haz any DelPhi accounts, and see how
          fast you DONT get a response. "Delphi? what's that?"
     e. B3g for 0pz. You truly have to be k-rad eleet to get
          ops on #hack. You know, be an IRC Operator or
          be a phed.

  8. Get on #Phreak, and um,  ahhh why kick another dead horse?

  9. OKay, this is k-rad and it is profitable.
          Change your nick to NickServ, and make it look all realistic
          and shit. Mayk up a script so if any d00d messages you,
          it looks like youre /msging a b0t. (type /msg Nickserv HELP
          for help, and shit). So like, bug a bunch of users and shit
          Make sure tehy're lame and gullible ones. Say, in an
          0phicial tone, that your nick is not registered. Just tell
          them to leave their addre$$, and password(this is important!)
          THEN Y00 GET PHREE AKK0UNTZ!!!!
          This method has been used time and time again by everybody,
          and it still pulls in users. just make sure you don't
          do it with your l3g1t account and don't ask an irc
          0perator. They are dicks anyway.


          Stay t00ned for more cool rainy day IRC projecktz

 --The most important NEWZ artikahl of them all. OUR GROUP!! YES!!!!
   Yes, it's recruitment week here, and we're trying to get the k-raddest
   people in our gr00p to join in on the phun.

                >>> FREE PBX TO EACH NEW MEMBER <<<
           (yeah right, like we can get ourselves a PBX)

    Anyways, in order to get in our group, you just have to talk to one of
    our members, not be lame, and not be in any other gr00p. Sorry,
    we want to be pyurr, and that means being monogamous.

 --Kurt Cobain died today. But he wasn't interesting, so who cares? I
        was driving to the bank when I heard it on da radi0.
 --Deathstar's VMB keeps getting funnier and funnier.
 --#warez is lame. but that's nothing new.
 --some guy posted a bunch of 'nigger jokes' on a lot of USENET groups.
       Of course that original post is gone, but the 10000000 replies, each
       about 4 pages long were kept intact. The BASIC(that sucky language?)
       message behind it was that you DON'T LEaVe YouR TERMINAL UNAtTENDED!
       Yeah really! False impersonation of a gr00p member can get you
       a 4 PBX phine.

 Well, that's all the news I can remember....

Well if you were on that inphamous conference, you can $kip to the next
section and all that shit. If not, you're clueless and need an explanation.
On some conference, a k-rad dewd came on named Knuckle. That wuzn't his
REAL alias, since his real alias would make him known. That was okay with
us. SO one of us had the bright idea to d0 some DaMaGe to Gail Thackery
to take a stand against all the pHrEAkERZ and HACKERZ she oppressed back
then. If you don't know who Gail Thackery is, don't feel 2 bad(but don't
feel ELEET either). Not even Knuckle knew who she was, which was suprising
due to the gr00p he was once in(don't worry, it wasn't more k-rad eleet
than OUR Gr00p). We made some call bephorhand to get the 602 SCC number
since we needed that Numba to talk to the dewd to get -it- done. What he/we
were trying to d0 was to get the telco Ph0n company to turn her lyne into
a payf0ne. Why? That'd be s000 k-rad to have her pick up da phone, try to
d1al a number, and have a msg say that you need a kwarter to make a [all.

Dis conference took place in around February(can't say the exact date, for
SeKuriTy Reazonz), at about 1:30 am EST.

             says its supposed to be a, a, a coin, a dtf what have you got
             on that? Is that a 1a office out there? 678?"
<Bruce>    "678 in Arizona?"
<Knuckle>  "Yeah"
<Bruce>    "1a code share"
<Knuckle>  "Thats where?"
<Bruce>    "Code share"
<Knuckle>  "Okay yeah alright so what ahve you got on 678-4450 can you do a

<Knuckle>  "You just told me, code share."
<Bruce>    "Code share's not an office"
<Knuckle>  "Okay, I'm sorry, maybe I'm not making myself clear. We'll start
             over again. 602-678-4450"
<Bruce>    <garbled> "What office is it working at?"

<Bruce>    "Hang on. <types> <types some more> 678?"
<Knuckle>  "4450 right"
<Bruce>    "I don't think it's a coin, because it's regular ringing
             non-PBX loop start."
<Knuckle>  "What do we got out there? Is that a 1a office or a 5e?"
<Bruce>    "1a"
<Knuckle>  "That's a 1a? alright well can we uh, can we do a class of
             service change on that? or uh, uh uh make it a DFA?"
<Bruce>    "I can give it a shot."

***************************[ 4. #WAREZ N STUPH ]***************************
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Somehow I managed to Steal this k-rad newz letter from the #warez channel.
I thought I'd show you how lame it was, and have some fun in the process.
I'll go thru it with u step-by-step.................

 Mystery Science Theater 3000 style...


--------------------------------
Warez News.  Issue 4  Volume 2.  8th week of 1994.

Warez News.  The definitive guide for the #warez channel.  Read it.  Know
it.  You will be tested on it.

[Joel] "This will be on the final!"
[Crow] "You will need a number two pencil"

It is released weekly, on no specific day,
and will include the latest release dates, new rumours, new releases, and
anything else I deem newsworthy.

[Tom] "which includes baseball scores!"

For you people out there in BBS land
that read this (and I know there are a few) ignore the crap about the
channel, you're not in it, so you don't know.  And YES I am a real bitch :)

[Joel] "little do they know how much the channel sux"
[Crow] "Ohhh does the great #warez channel have it's own newsletter?"
[Tom]  "yeah, it just sucks. huh huh"

        Again, please send this to EVERYONE you know.  And please don't
friggin ask me all the time more questions about what I write in here.
Everything I know, you will know *IF* you read this.  I won't tolerate any
bullshit.  Anyway, here we go, and enjoy.

[Joel] "I have a feeling this is going to be painful."

{{{{There was a line of dashes here that the editors of KGB took out}}}}

GAMES

We keep on hearing about stuff like Ultima 8 and MechWarrior 2, ad
infinitum.

[Tom]  "Well shut up then!"

What we aren't hearing enough about is Stonekeep.  Stonekeep
is Interplay's new brainchild.  You know Interplay, they made Bard's Tale,
Dragon Wars, Wasteland, Battlechess, Lost Vikings, Star Trek.

[Crow] "Next, on Emergency 9-1-1, I star in a computer game."

 You know them, they make basically the only games worth playing.  Well
Stonekeep should essentially redefine RPGs for the coming years.  It will
supposedly be a FULL SVGA RPG.  Something this world has never seen the
likes of. Fully photorealistic dungeons and monsters, and puzzles that will
hopefully be reminiscent of Bard's Tale days.  A recent rumour going
around is that this game will ship on UPWARDS of 30 1.44M floppy disks.

[Tom]  "THIRTY DISKS?? Do they ship it to you on a dolly?"
[Joel] "that'd be bigger than the Led Zeppelin box set!"

Interplay feels that the CDROM market is weak (it is) and won't use this
medium until it gets more support.  Intel was demoing their Pentiums using
this game at the recent trade shows, cause it REALLY shows off what those
machines can do.  It *won't* require a Pentium though.  I'm HOPING I can
get it to work on my 386/33 :)

Doom 1.2.  I'm sick of hearing the bitching about this puppy lately, but

[Joel] "I'm kinda getting sick of hearing the bitching from this WAREZ
       puppy"

here we go again.  It was meant to be released last Friday, and it wasn't.

[Crow] "He had little league that day."

Well guess what, it was delayed because of problems with coding for the
GUS.  Something popped up that disabled the digital sound, and they have
to fix that bug.  Hopefully it will be out by this coming Friday, the
18th.  Doom 1.2 is already out for NeXT, and can be picked up from some
FTP site.  A Linux port is also in the works for Doom, due out in a few
weeks.

Black Magic came out.  It doesn't work.  Whoopie!  And who cares.:)

[Tom]  "We don't! we don't!"

Tie Fighter Demo.  This game is due out in like May or something, and
here's a little review of it by Kruey:

[Joel] "Kruey? Sounds like an British alternative band"
[Tom]  "Yeah they're playing at Lalapalooza"

Well it finally arrived (the demo that is).  Usually I shun demos, but
this one I actual sought after.  It seems Lucas finally accepted that
they did screw up some on XWING.  The ships were next to invulnerable,
and doing the same mission two hundred times cuz you let a Tie-Bomber
fire off a lone missile, blew.  But worse of all was the stupid wingmen
blowing your ass off when firing at what was in front of you.  Well the
wingmen are just as stupid in Tie Fighter, but your ship certainly isn't
invulnerable!  In keeping realism, Lucas opted to give the Tie-Fighters
no shields.  3 shots and you're toast.

[Crow] "No R2, you'll just go out there again and break down."

According to the nfo file that was floating around, the release will
have a full arsenal of different ships (I can't wait to fly a Gunship
myself).  The game has exactly the same controls as Xwing, so the docs
are unnecessary.  Beware of collisions!  You even tap against another
ship you lose a solar panel...

[Tom]  "That's why you're better off with aluminum siding."

They improved the graphics a little bit.  In highest mode there's a tad
more color.  The detail really slows things down on my 386/25 so can't
be much more specific.
If you want to play the game in ultra carnage mode, just let a few stray
bullets hit one of your corvettes.  :)

[Joel] "uh oh, better get MACO!"

Well, all I can really say is: I am gonna buy this one.

[Tom]  "A warez puppy actually BUYING a ware?"
[JOel] "Well how do you think they get the warez to courier it out?"
[Crow] "They get their big brother at Software Etc to get it for 'em?"

Not because I
need the docs or anything like that.  I just think the game's worth
buying.
 
Welp that's what Kruey says.  My personal opinion?  I tried it.  Looked
exactly like XWing to me.  Why are they bothering releasing a new 9 disk
game when they could just add a 1 disk addon like with BWing and be done
with it?  Moneygrubbers.  (By the way, I don't KNOW that it will be nine
disks, I'm fabricating a number for my own evil purposes).

[Tom]  "bill gates! WE VILL GET YOU NEXT TIME!"



APPLICATIONS/UTILITIES

Stacker 4.0 came out, and now it will crash your hard drives on alternate
wednesdays instead of fridays.

[Tom]  "but seriously folks, <badum ching>"
[Crow] "Stack THIS!"

It supposedly has much better compression ratios compared to the old
Stacker 3.1x series, and does some other funky shit that I really couldn't
care less about.

Well well well, he says exactly what I said.  GUESS WHAT? WIN TERM
PROGRAMS SUCK BUTT NUTS!:) (And heck, Kruey doesn't write as well as me!:))

GUS OS/2 MMPM Drivers are here!  I haven't tried them yet, and they are
alphas, so I may wait a bit.  People who tried them said they suffer from
ultraclick, and also lock up at points.  I may wait, I might try em, who
knows.  More to be reported in the next issue.

[Joel] "Kids run for the rich taste of GUS OS/2 MPMM drivers!"
[Tom]  "Better living thru OS/2"

Windows 3.11 is here.  Not Windows 3.11 for Workgroups that was released
originally, but a small upgrade for people using Windows 3.1 that adds the
faster File Manager and 32-bit disk access found previously only in WFW
3.11.  Not really a big deal, and if you've already upgraded, useless.  The
only real difference is the lack of networking support.  And of course the
fact that if you can get the 32-bit disk access to work for you (it won't
work on my machine, and lots of others, for some weird reason), it's like
150% faster Windows.  Which is nice.

[Crow] "150% faster? so that'd make your computer like an XT instead of a
        PC right?"



NEWS FROM THE CHANNEL

[Tom]  "This will be a good one."

Welp the channel blows ass.

[Crow] "tell us something we don't know"

  Some more lamers have infiltrated, and all
the "cool" lamers will stick up for em.  Great.

[Joel] "Lamer Wars: Now it's personal!"

THELIST.  This idea died a very hard death after Elminster, master of all
that is evil and bad for the channel, got a hold of it, and decided to
shoot it down.  With all his cronies that listen to every word he says
backing him up, the plan just sorta hit the floor.  Basically it was an
idea to make all new users to #warez fill out a little application to see
if they were worth anything to the channel.

[Crow] "enter your mothers' maiden name, and list three members of the
       Beatles"

I didn't think it was such a
bad idea, and I don't think most other people minded that part.  What they
DID mind was, "THELIST."  Essentially, this was a list of about 80 people
who would be able to VOTE on the new users.

[Tom]  "Oh! Shindler's THELIST!"

It wasn't, as some people
construed it to be, the only eighty people allowed in the channel,

[Joel] "and they all have ops too!"

it was just people who would put votes in on new users.  This list, it
seems, people didn't want getting around cause they thought they could get
in trouble.  My opinion?  Suck it up weenies.  In America, and most other
countries, simple nicks don't stand up in a court case.

[Tom]  "Not even Nikki Sixx?"
[Joel] "The state versus KILROY"

I can see it now, the judge asking for "Byte" to approach the stand, and me
being put to death cause my name was in some dumb UNLABELED list.  People
don't even realize that 6 months ago, AWA posted about 250 nicks and
addresses of people on #warez to the USENET.  Guess what?  NOTHING
happened, cause no one cares.

[Tom]  "Oh you'd like that wouldn't you?"
[Crow] "They just don't look anymore."

Warez News missed a few weeks due to the general warez drought.

[Joel] "yeah I head the Joads had to move to Sweden for a warez pickin'
       job"

I'll release more when there just is stuff to write about, it took three
weeks to get this issue together, since jack shit has come out. Sue me.


That's it for another exciting issue of #warez-news.  Upload this to all
your favorite boards and stuff, start getting the InterNet crowd some new,
REAL faces from the real world.  We need more real users, and less of
these fuckin local lamers

[Crow] "I thought the users WERE the lamers!"
[Tom]  "local to WHERE?"

Who haven't called a board in their life.  If this offends you, GOOD,
that's my goal.

[Tom]  "Well we tried to offend YOU, and that's our goal!"
[Joel] "we gotta go"
