Editor's Note:
	It snowed today (It's Nov. 25th right now.)  It was 60 and sunny 
on Saturday, and now that it's tuesday it snows.  Dont't you just love 
DC? It was in the mid 60s Dec. 6th too....Anywah, It's near Xmas now, 
and it's colder.  (Kinda neat, you get to see al the times I sat down at 
the computer to get this thing together.  I don't have too much to say 
this issue.  I have 2 articles from Mr. Gardner Swan, a man who should 
get credit for being the first person to actually submit anything without 
me pestering them, which should get him some good guy points.  
Anyway, This was going to be the religion/god issue, but I couldn't 
come up with enough stuff having to do with religion, so that Idea went 
down the tube.  
	There’s also some stuff in this issue by Hakim Bey(not his real 
name), an anarchist who wrote the book Temporary Autonomous Zone 
(TAZ).  In this book he talks about the need to create places that, if 
only for a little while, are outside of government control.  The piece in 
this issue concerns Permanent Autonomous Zones, and it’s all pretty 
well explained in the article.  
	I got Microsoft Publisher for Xmas, and that’s why this thing 
looks so much artsier than in previous issues.  Well, Here’s the info I 
put in every issue:  I review recors, zines, and anything else you send 
my way.  I'll even give you a free ad.  If you send me an article and I 
print it I'll send you 2 free issues.  Back issues are available for $1 or 
some stamps, subscriptions are $5 or a book of stamps.  If you want I'll 
send you back issues as part of your subscription.  Send all

QUICK FIX
BY
WILLIAM S. BURROUGHS
To put the country simple, earth has a lot of things other folks might 
want...like the whole planet. And maybe these folks would like a few 
changes made. Like more carbon Dioxide in the atmosphere, and room 
for their way of life. We've seen this happen before, right in these 
United States.
Your way of life destroyed the Indian's way of life.
The Indian reservation is extinction.
But I offer this distinction. I'm with the invaders, no use trying to hide 
that. And at the same, I disagree with some of the things they are 
doing.
Oh we're not united anymore than you are
Oh we're not united anymore than you are.
Conservative factions is set on nuclear war as a solution to the Indian 
personality.

Others disaggree
Others disaggree

I don't  claim that my methods are one hundred percent humane, but I 
do say,if we can't think of anything quieter, and tidier than that...

We are all not that much better than new earth aches.

Permanent TAZs
by Hakim Bey
TAZ-theory tries to concern itself with existing or emerging situations 
rather than with pure utopianism. All over the world people are leaving 
or "disappearing" themselves from the Grid of Alienation and seeking 
ways to restore human contact. An interesting example of this-on the 
level of "urban folk culture"-can be found in the proliferation of hobby 
networks and conferences. Recently I discovered the zines of two such 
groups, Crown Jewels of the Hlgh Wire (devoted to the collection of 
glass electrical insulators) and a journal on cucurbitology (The Gourd). 
A vast amount of creativity goes into these obsessions. The various 
periodic gatherings of fellow-maniacs amount to genuine face-to-face 
(unmediated) festivals of eccentricity. It's not just the "counter-culture" 
which seeks its TAZs, its nomad encampments and nights of liberation 
from the Consensus. Self-organized and autonomous groups are 
springing up amongst every "class" and "sub-culture". Vast tracts of the 
Babylonian Empire are now virtually empty, populated only by the 
spooks of MassMedia, and a few psychotic policemen. 

	TAZ-theory realizes that THIS IS HAPPENING- we're not 
talking about "should" or "will be"-we're talking about an already-
existing movement. Our use of various thought-experiments, utopian 
poetics, paranoia criticism, etc., aims at helping to clarify this complex 
and still largely undocumented movement, to give it some theoretical 
focus and self-awareness, and to suggest tactics based on coherent 
integral strategies-to act the midwife or the panegyrist, not the 
"vanguard"!

	And so we've had to consider the fact that not all existing 
autonomous zones are "temporary". Some are (at least by intention) 
more-or-less "permanent". Certain cracks in the Babylonian Monolith 
appear so vacant that whole groups can move into them and settle 
down. Certain theories, such as "Permaculture", have been developed 
to deal with this situation and make the most of it. "Villages", 
"communes", "communities", even "arcologies" and "biospheres" (or 
other utopian-city forms) are being experimented with and 
implemented. Even here however TAZ-theory may offer some useful 
thought-tools and clarifications.

	What about a poetique (a "way of making") and a politique (a 
"way of living-together) for the "permanent" TAZ (or "PAZ")?  What 
about the actual relation between temporariness and permanence? And 
how can the PAZ renew and refresh itself periodically with the 
"festival" aspect of the TAZ? 


THE QUESTION OF PUBLICITY
Recent events in the US and Europe have shown that self-
organized/autonomous groups strike fear into the heart of the State. 
MOVE in Philadelphia, the Koreshites of Waco, Deadheads, Rainbow 
Tribes, computer-hackers, squatters, etc., have been targeted for 
varying intensity-levels of extermination. And yet other autonomous 
groups go unnoticed, or at least unpersecuted. What makes the 
difference? One factor may be the malign effect of publicity or 
mediation. The Media experience a vampiric thirst for the shadow-
Passion play of "Terrorism", Babylon's public ritual of expiation, 
scapegoating, and blood-sacrifice. Once any autonomous group allows 
this particular "gaze" to fall upon it, the shit hits the fan:-the Media will 
try to arrange a mini-armageddon to satisfy its junk-sickness for 
spectacle and death.

Now, the PAZ makes a fine sitting target for such a Media smart-
bomb. Beseiged inside its "con-pound", the self-organized group can 
only succumb to some sort of cheap pre-determined martyrdom. 
Presumably this role appeals only to neurotic masochists??? In any 
case, most groups will want to live out their natural span or trajectory 
in peace and quiet. A good tactic here might be to avoid publicity from 
the Mass Media as if it were the plague. A bit of natural paranoia 
comes in handy, so long as it doesn't become an end in itself. One must 
be cunning in order to get away with being bold. A touch of camoflage, 
a flair for invisibility, a sense of tact as a tactic...might be as useful to a 
PAZ as a TAZ. Humble suggestions:-Use only "intimate media" (zines, 
phonetrees, BBSs, free radio and mini-FM, public-access cable, etc.)-
avoid blustering-macho-confrontationist attitude-you don't need five 
seconds on the Evening News ("Police Raid Cultists") to validate your 
existence.
Our slogan might be:-"Get a life, not a life-style."  

ACCESS
People probably ought to choose the people they live with. ''Open-
membership" communes invariably end up swamped with freeloaders 
and sex-starved pathetic creeps. PAZs must choose their own 
membership mutually-this has nothing to do with "elitism". The PAZ 
may exercize a temporarily open function-such as hosting festivals or 
giving away free food, etc.-but it need not be permanently open to any 
self-proclaimed sympathizer who wanders by.

THE EMERGENCE OF A GENUINELY ALTERNATIVE 
ECONOMY
Once again, this is already happening-but it still needs a huge amount 
of work before it comes into focus. The sub-economies of "lavoro 
nero", untaxed transactions, barter, etc., tend to be severely limited and 
localized. BBSs and other networking systems could be used to link up 
these regional/marginal aeconomies ("household managements") into a 
viable alternative economy of some magnitude. "P.M." has already 
outlined something like this in bolo'bolo-in fact a number of possible 
systems already exist, in theory anyway. The problem is: -how to 
construct a true alternative economy, i.e. a complete economy, without 
attracting the IRS and other capitalist runningdogs? How can I 
exchange my skills as, say, a plumber or moonshiner, for the food, 
books, shelter, and psychoactive plants I want-without paying taxes, or 
even without using ally State-forged money? How can I live a 
comfortable (even luxurious) life free of all interactions and 
transactions with CommodityWorld? If we took all the energy the 
Leftists put into"demos", and all the energy the Libertarians put into 
playing futile little 3rd-party games, and if we redirected all that power 
into the construction of a real underground economy, we would already 
have accomplished "the Revolution" long ago.

THE "WORLD" CAME TO AN END IN 1972
The hollowed-out effigy of the Absolute State finally toppled in 
"1989". The last ideology, Capitalism, is no more than a skin-disease 
of the Very Late Neolithic. It's a desiring-machine running on empty. 
I'm hoping to see it deliquesce in my lifetime, like one of Dali's 
mindscapes. And I want to have somewhere to "go" when the shit 
comes down. Of course the death of Capitalism needn't entail the 
Godzilla-like destruction of all human culture; this scenario is merely a 
terror-image propagated by Capitalism itself. Nevertheless it stands to 
reason that the dreaming corpse will spasm violently before rigor 
mortis sets in-and New York or LA may not be the smartest places to 
wait out the storm. (And the storm may already have begun.) [On the 
other hand NYC and LA might not be the worst places to create the 
New World; one can imagine whole squatted neighborhoods, gangs 
transformed into Peoples' Militias, etc.] Now, the gypsy-RV way of life 
may be one way to deal with the on-going melt-down of Too-Late 
Capitalism - but as for me, I'd prefer a nice anarchist monastery  
somewhere-a typical place for "scholars" to sit out the "Dark Ages". 
The more we organize this NOW the less hassle we'll have to face 
later. I'm not talking about "survival"-I'm not interested in mere 
survival. I want to thrive.  BACK TO UTOPIA.

FESTIVALS
The PAZ serves a vital function as a node in the TAZ-web, a 
meetingplace for a wide circle of friends and allies who may not 
actually live fulltime on the "farm" or in the "village". Ancient villages 
held fairs which brought wealth to the community, provided markets 
for travelers, and created festal time/space for all participants. 
Nowadays the festival is emerging as one of the most important forms 
for the TAZ itself, but can also provide renewal and fresh energy for 
the PAZ. I remember reading somewhere that in the Middle Ages there 
were one hundred and eleven holidays a year; we should take this as 
our "utopian minimum" and strive to do even better. [Note: the utopian 
minima proposed by C. Fourier consisted of more food and sex than 
the average 18th century French aristocrat enjoyed; B. Fuller proposed 
the term "bare minimum" for a similar concept]

THE LIVING EARTH
I believe that there exist plenty of good selfish reasons for desiring the 
"organic" (it's sexier), the "natural" (it tastes better), the "green" (it's 
more beautiful), the Wild(er)ness (it's more exciting).  Communitas (as 
P. Goodman called it) and conviviality (as I. Illich called it) are more 
pleasurable than their opposites. The living earth need not exclude the 
organic city-the small but intense conglomeration of humanity devoted 
to the arts and slightly decadent joys of a civilization purged of all its 
gigantism and enforced loneliness-but even those of us who enjoy 
cities can see immediate and hedonic motives for fighting for the 
"environment". We are militant biophiles. Deep ecology, social 
ecology, permaculture, appropriate tech..we're not too picky about 
ideologies. Let 1000 flowers bloom.

PAZ TYPOLOGY
A "weird religion" or a rebel art movement can become a kind of non-
local PAZ, like a more intense and all-consuming hobby network. The 
Secret Society (like the Chinese Tong) also provides a model for a 
PAZ without geographic limits. But the "perfect case scenario" 
involves a free space that extends into free time. The essence of the 
PAZ must be the long-drawn-out intensification of the joys-and risks-
of the TAZ.  And the intensification of the PAZ will be....Utopia Now.

"Pure" Punk
by Gardner Swan 
	It took me a while to think about what I wanted to write this 
article about.  I didn't just want to write some useless show review, but 
it seemed like that was the only thing I could think of.  But after talking 
a lot on Derek's board about punk philosophy and DIY, I finally 
figured out a way to integrate these two topics.
	I went to see Green Day on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, and 
it was a fun show.  They even played an Operation Ivy song, which 
made me happy.  But I just didn't feel anything from the band.  It 
seemed like they didn't care.  Later, someone told me that they thought 
Green Day were the biggest sellouts in the world, and that they have 
completely changed their music since signing with a major label.  As I 
think back on that show, I realized how many fakers there were at that 
show.  One person I know who is about the least punk person I know 
was there.  Afterwards she said to me, "the ticket was free, so I went," 
or something like that.  I think that is such bullshit.  I wouldn't go to a 
free show if I didn't like the band, and on the same note I paid $55 to 
go see the Rolling Stones this summer and I'd pay it again in a second.  
I think that so many people these days are full of shit.
	Anyway, I just got back from seeing Pure Seeking and The 
Skavacados at the Grog and Tankard (Nectar also played but I missed 
them. . . sorry Yorke.).  Both bands had lots of energy, but Pure 
Seeking was especially powerful.  The last time I saw them, they were 
kind of shabby, not really together.  Tonight they were simply 
amazing.  I was completely blown away by everyone, from Ken 
Tanabe's drum solo without using sticks, to Josh Reed's amazing as 
always guitar playing, to the subtle intricacies of Nick Rubin's Eddie-
Vedder-esqe voice.  Everyone was amazing.  The crowd was totally 
into it.  The emotion from the music was so strong.  This is what punk 
is really about.  It's about being real.  It's about doing it yourself.  
Think for yourself, be yourself.  It's not about the kind of music you 
listen to or the kind of clothes you wear or the sacrifices you have to 
make.  It's about being and doing whatever it takes to make whatever 
you know is right happen.
	I don't want everyone to go out and start liking Pure Seeking 
now.  I want you to listen to whatever you want and if you like Pure 
Seeking or whatever other band I like then that is good, because every 
band, especially Pure Seeking, deserves recognition.  I think that bands 
that really know and enjoy what they are doing will always be more 
fun to see, and I hope you agree with me.  It's seems to be a natural 
progression for "punk" music, because the mainstream took away what 
was ours.
	After the show I approached Tanabe to tell him how phat (ed: 
I'd perfer the word "good" but it's his article) the show was, and he said 
that he knew that I played guitar so it was cool to be complimented by 
an "expert."  I wouldn't call myself that, but I would like to say thanks 
to Ken and the rest of Pure Seeking, as well as to The Skavacados and 
lastly, to Green Day, for making me realize what integrity is worth.  
Punk is not dead, it just has a new face.

	I wrote this article at about 2:30 am, so it may be a little 
whacked out.  I think what inspired me to write it is the "Jesus was a 
Punk" article from Helter Skelter issue #1.  It's not an argument against 
the article, but instead just another view.  It is also not meant as an 
attack on Christianity or Christians, I am just stating my problems with 
it and how it conflicts with my punk philosophy.  So read on and 
enjoy:
Do It Yourself -- Don't Listen to God!
(again by Gardner Swan)
	Recently religion has been brought up a lot in the media because 
of all this prayer in school crap.  Well I guess it's relevant now so I will 
write about religion, because it is one of my favorite subjects to argue 
and state my opinion on.  I believe that Christianity is the most anti-
punk, anti-DIY thing in existence.
	At the root of DIY is the concept that everyone should think for 
themselves.  Christianity tries to take away this freedom of thought by 
creating some omnipotent being who judges us all.  It attempts to set an 
ultimate right and wrong based on the thoughts of some old (thousands 
of years old) guys.  I find it much more enlightening to think up my 
own definition of right and wrong.
	Another problem that I have with Christianity is that Christians 
seem to think that people need to have a god, or at least a strictly 
defined  set of morals to be good people and help the world.  This is 
also a blatantly anti-DIY idea, as it implies that you must rely on 
someone else to be a good person.  I would also like to point out that I 
help people out because I want to be helped out when the shit hits my 
fan, and I think it was the Bible that said, "Do unto others as you would 
have done to you," or whatever.  I don't need to look forward to heaven 
in order to do good, nor do I need to fear hell.  Give me a break and 
think about it for a minute.
	Back to the fundamentals of punk/DIY, I think a key ingredient 
in "doing it yourself" is knowledge.  The concept of God is used as an 
explanation of many things that we don't understand right now.  An 
example of this is the creation of the universe.  Why would anyone say 
that the universe was created by something that they don't even know 
exists, and then stop there?  That is completely illogical and shows 
weakness in anyone's argument that uses such idiotic tactics.
	There are many other anti-punk aspects of Christianity, such as 
Original Sin and the superiority of God, but I feel that I have rambled 
on pointlessly long enough.  And I want all of you kiddies out there to 
remember something this holiday season: Christmas is the celebration 
if the birth of marketing genius, which symbolizes man's eternal link 
with elves, flying reindeer, and unlawful entry through chimneys.

Why just Punk Rock?
by Derek Teslik

	I became aware of one of the most severe limitation of the punk 
movement earlier tonight.  Punk, an attitude, culture, movement, and 
set of ideals, has only embraced one form of music in communicating 
those ideals.   Rock is fun and easy to play, true, but why stop there?  
Jazz, for example, has been for the most part ignored by punks 
everywhere.  Nation of Ulysses approached punk jazz, but they too fell 
back on rock and roll.  While I think it would be much too difficult to 
organize an entire punk symphony (practice space, $$$ for instruments, 
punks with a long enough attention span to sit and play one song for an 
hour, all are big problems), punk jazz is within our grasps.  Jazz, you 
may recall, has its roots in the underground.  Now, as most of the old 
jazz pioneers are dying off, jazz music is becoming stale and boring.  
	All any jazz band needs is a drummer, a bassist, and someone to 
blow his horn, play her piano, or the like.  While it may take a little 
more musical skill and knowledge to jet some jazz numbers down than 
it does to play three-chord punk rock that's not a bad thing.  Punk rock, 
with a few innovative exceptions that would not even be called "punk" 
by purists, is getting amazingly boring.  In "Salad Days" Minor Threat 
talked about how punk was getting stale and that was around 1983!  
Now we have Tim Yo and the boys at MRR ranting and raving over 
the Slant 6 album for example, and to be honest it sounds like a higher 
pitched versoin of music I've heard before too many times.  It's hard to 
convey emotions in a style that is so confined, anyway.  Many punks 
are anarchists, but you wouldn't know it by analyzing punk rock.  
There are three main rules to punk rock:  1) Play fast 2) play loud 3) 
play distorted.  These "fuck the system, fuck the rules" anarchist bands 
never even consider not playing by the punk rock rules.  Something 
else I've noticed:  Punk is about daring to different, and not 
conforming, right?  How come almost all punk rock sounds exactly 
alike?  Jazz music has so much freedom in it, if some punks learned to 
use it well the entire scene would benefit.  
	Jazz is ripe for a youth takeover.  It is time to storm the jazz 
clubs en masse.  It is time to steal the horn sections from those silly ska 
bands and make some real music with them (no offense, ska people).  
It is time, punks of the world, to take back jazz for the underground.
