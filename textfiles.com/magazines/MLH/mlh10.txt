>>> ADMIN
Previous issues are 1-5,6A,6B, and 7-9.  I received some questions about
spuratic receipt of all issues.  I've gotten feedback that some sysops were
killing any messages over 3K.  With all the routing headers added to the
top, that was pretty limiting!  I'm now splitting the issues into two
parts.  That should grease the path to your particular QTH. Thanks to
N7FTM, W9NQP, WB8HQS, N8QYG, N9ADS, W5SYT for input.

>>> EXTERNAL DRIVE PINOUT
Here's the external floppy pinout. Thanks, Steve (W9NWP). Pin numbering is
like a Scotch-flex header:     1  3  5  7  9 11 13 15 17 19
                               2  4  6  8 10 12 14 16 18 20  or rotate CW:

      2 _Side Select                1 _Disk Change
      4  GND                        3 _Read Data
      6 _Track Zero                 5 _Write Protect
      8 _Write Enable               7 _Index
     10  GND                        9 _Write Data
     12  GND                       11 _Step
     14 _Drive Select 2            13 _Direction Select
     16 _Motor ON                  15 _RPM
     18  Vcc                       17  Vcc
     20  GND                       19  GND

The underscore character indicates negated signals (true when low).

Interrupt Enable Register (IER) at address (BASE+1)
---------------------------------------------------
Only the lower 4 bits are used.  The high four bits are permanently at
zero.  The four used bits indicate which conditions will cause the UART to
interrupt the computer.

CAUTION: BASE+1 will access this register if and only if the most signifi-
cant bit of the LCR (BASE+3) is zero.

Bit 0: Received Data Available.  Set this to 1 if you want the computer
       interrupted when new data has arrived.  This bit is reset to zero
       upon completion of the associated interrupt service routine.
Bit 1: Transmitter Register Empty.  Set this to 1 if you want to be inter-
       rupted when the UART is ready to receive another character to trans-
       mit.  This bit is reset to 0 immediately upon reading the IIR regis-
       ter.
Bit 2: Receiver Line Status.  Set to 1 if you want the UART to interrupt
       when any of the following occur: Overrun Error, Parity Error, Fram-
       ing Error, or Break Interrupt. Reset to 0 upon completion of the
       associated interrupt service routine.
Bit 3: Modem Status. Set to 1 if you want the UART to interrupt the comput-
       er when it receives any of: Clear to Send, Data Set Ready, Ring In-
       dicator or Received Line Signal Detect.  This bit is reset to 0 upon
       completion of the associated interrupt service routine.
Bit 4-7: Always 0.

Interrupt Identification Register (IIR) at address (BASE+2)
-----------------------------------------------------------
The 8250 prioritizes the four types of interrupts discussed under the IER
section in the following order from top priority to lowest: RLS, RDA, TRE,
and MS.  The following three bits indicate the highest pending interrupt.

Bit 0: When 0, some interrupt is pending.

Bits 1,2: Indicate the type of the highest priority pending interrupt. RLS
       gives 11, RDA gives 10, TRE gives 01, MS gives 00.

Bits 3-7: Always 0.

And a request: If anybody has an I/O address map for the IBM-PC environent,
addresses 00H up to 0FFH, I would love to get a copy.  Packet me the info
directly, or maybe mail me a photocopy of something.  Thank you!.
