A compendium of all issues are available from ftp.cs.buffalo.edu 
(198.17.249.2) as mlhackXX.zip in the ~\pub\ham-radio directory.  Login

The compendium is also available on SimTel archives (eg. 
oak.oakland.edu) as \SimTel\msdos\packet\mlhackXX.zip.  The XX in the 
filename indicates the last issue number, and replaces the previous 
convention of using mlhacker.zip for all compendiums.


>>> INDEX
The issues add up!  Once I passed 24 issues, I knew I'd have to spend 
the time to go back and index them.  Here it is.

>>> AN ERA PASSING
The first issue of MLH was distributed in January of 1993.  Two and a 
half years later, I expect this to be the last MLHacker.  I still use my 
minisports regularly, but the seasons change, time moves on, and other 
facets of life become dominant.  I also picked up two broken laptops (a 
'386 and a '486), and, by mixing and matching parts, I have a '386 that 
is capable of taking over much of the Minisport functions.  Prices are 
falling such that it's become reasonable for me to begin using a more 
modern laptop.  The two minisports are getting attention from the kids.  
They have favorite CGA games, and they're beginning to call the 
Minisports "their" computers.

MLH has been coincident with me learning a lot about the Internet and 
Amateur Radio networks.  After swelling my activities to the point where 
net surfing was all I was doing, I've shrunk back to a level where net 
access is a tool rather than a teacher.  I need to get some work done in 
other areas!

Since making the MLH compendium available on Internet archives, I 
receive queries from around the world.  Nonetheless, most of the 
questions are discussed in previous issues, giving further impetus to 
wrap up this project while it's alive and well, rather than fill more 
issues of MLH with fluff just to keep it going.  If anybody has 
questions about the minisport, by all means contact me.  Just because 
I'm not sourcing more newsletters doesn't mean I don't want to talk 
about them any more.  I'm sure my contact information will change over 
the next 6 months, so you'll have to be creative tracking me down.  The 
most reliable method will probably be to contact a local Amateur Radio 
operator and ask them to find QSL information or a packet address for 
KA9SNF.

I'll continue to publish in the electronics/radio magazines.  I'll be 
moving to Colorado in August to attend a "prestigious" Space Tactics 
School put on by Headquarters Space Command.  After that, I'll probably 
be permanently moving to Colorado Springs to teach at the Air Force 
Academy.  God willing, I'll begin training as an astronaut sometime in 
1996.  Selection will be this Fall.
