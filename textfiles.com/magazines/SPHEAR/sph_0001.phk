   All real phreakers know that a redbox is a great tool, if used 
wisely. Redboxes can be used to make both local and LD calls. 
However, as we know, to make a local call, one must first dial 
'0' and then make up some excuse like 'excuse me operator, the 
5 button on this payphone doesn't seem to be working.' The 
TSPS operator would ask you to deposit 25 cents and dial then dial 
the number for you. Normally you don't need an excuse to have 
the operator dial a number for you. But in recent years the 
operators have become 'smarter' and aware of the rat shack 
tone-dialer conversion. Nowadays if you ask the operator to 
dial a number for you, for no apparent reason, he/she will 
become suspicious almost immediatly. Although they will place 
the call whether or not you give them a reason, the will be 
listening to you when you place the tones. Sometimes, I have 
discovered, that using a redbox to make local calls doesn't 
allways work, as I have had the operator inform me that the 
quarter was not registering and that I was using an electronic 
device. The operator then said that she was going to call 
security and to please wait on the line. I think you can guess 
what I did then. I have never had a problem dialing long 
distance though. This is probably because it is automated when 
it asks for your money. The main reason that the operator will 
suspect that you are using a redbox is if the tones generated 
are too loud, as this somehow impairs the TSPS's ability to 
detect the quarter tones. The quarter tones generated by the 
phone are usually much quieter than that of the red box. To 
get around this problem, hold a credit card, or piece of thin
cardboard between the redbox and the mouthpiece. This should 
significantly reduce the loudness. Another reason for the 
operator knowing that you are using an 'electronic device' is 
that the speed of the tones produced by the redbox, often times 
do not match the speeds of the phone; the redbox tones are 
slightly, but noticably slower. There is no real solution to 
this type of problem, oh well, there are other phones out 
there.

'Hello C&P telephone, may I help you?'
We all know that TSPS operators are one of the most dangerous 
around. But is life as an operator really that interesting.
When you come to think about it, you realize that although it 
would be great to be an operator, think about all the 
potential drawbacks. If you have ever taken a tour of either 
an AT&T switching station, or a Bell station, you know that 
operators don't have the best 'offices' around. Personally 
operators must have the most routine, and probably one of 
the most boring jobs around. Since the late 1980s almost all 
switching tasks are performed by computer, there is really no 
need to have a human operator. The operator's primary task is 
to oversee the computer and to take anycalls regarding collect 
calls, and billing. Even with collect calls, this is now 
handled by computer, where you dial 0+NPA+Nxx+xxxx and a voice 
recording will ask you for your name. Basically the TSPS 
operators exist to make operator-assisted calls. TSPS 
operators are so dangerous because they have an ANI readout 
display and are known sometimes to monitor operator-assisted 
calls. So is becoming an operator really a career choice?

Ever realize that the government has so much control it isn't 
even funny anymore? Just for an example, take the 2600 
incident in November 1992 at Pentagon City. As described by 
both the Washington Post and 2600 Magazine, the Secret Service 
agents that raided the meeting took disks, computer equipment, 
and other material without informing the people of what was 
happening. They also took the IDs of the people there with out 
any stated reasons. This act alone shows that the government 
has so much control over our lives, and that the Constitution 
doesn't offer as much protection as it seems it does. It is 
not in this century alone that the Constitution did not 
guarantee us our rights, as we can see. The government, since 
it is also composed of the Judicial branch can restrict our 
rights, and in some cases deny them to us and still get away 
with it. 

                                  Toll Fraud
                                  ----------

Excerpt from the FCC Notice for Proposed Rulemaking, CC Docket 
93-292
{Talks about how the FCC is fighting it.
Doesn't talk about redboxes.. just beige boxing, and blue 
boxing, etc.}




      Until the mid 1980s, carrier networks were the main targets of
telecommunications fraud.  Fraud perpetrators might use electronic
devices or even a child's whistle to simulate carrier switching tones
that would allow them to place calls and avoid paying for them.  As
carriers developed new methods to prevent these primitive forms of
toll fraud, however, perpetrators began to use computers to access the
carriers' networks.

      Control over the use of telecommunications services has
increasingly shifted from carriers to individual consumers.
Technology is providing more flexible options for use of those
services.  With this shift in control, however, has come a shift in
the toll fraud targets.  Customers, as well as carriers, are now the
victims.  Fraud involving customer-owned private branch exchanges
(PBXs) provides an example.  Customers can now use a feature in their
on-premises PBX equipment to route incoming remote access calls to an
outgoing line.  With this capability, a company's sales
representatives in the field can, for example, have the convenience of
placing calls that would be billed to the employer's outgoing PBX
line.  Fraud perpetrators have discovered that they can call into a
PBX and then use computers or "finger hacking" to identify the
authorization code for the remote access feature connected to the
outgoing line.  Once the authorization code is found or "hacked," the
perpetrator can obtain a dial tone and make outgoing calls that are
billed to the PBX owner.  In some cases, the PBX owner may also be
billed for incoming 800 calls made by the perpetrator.

       Both customers and carriers suffer the effects of fraud; industry 
and Secret Service estimates of annual losses range from one to five 
billion dollars, in an industry in which annual billings are 
approximately $175 billion.  Several different types of fraud are 
creating these losses:

  (1)  the unauthorized remote access through PBXs already described;

  (2)  cellular "cloning," in which billing codes for legitimate 
cellular subscribers are installed in a perpetrator's cellular phones;

  (3)  the billing of operator-assisted calls to line with billing 
restrictions, such as payphone lines; and

  (4) "clip-on" fraud, in which the perpetrator physically attaches a 
calling device directly to a phone line.

  Fraud perpetrators may watch customers using calling cards at
payphones and sell the calling card numbers to others, or directly
approach consumers and ask them to accept billing to their phones as
part of a spurious "official" investigation.  Industry and law
enforcement sources expect that new types of fraud will develop even
as these existing types of fraud are being combatted.

      Experience has shown that those new telecommunications
technologies offering the most convenience and flexibility for users,
are often also most likely to present new toll fraud opportunities.
The Commission's goal has been, and will continue to be, to work with
consumers and the industry to find solutions to each fraud problem
without hindering the development or use of these new technologies.
In devising these solutions, we must ensure that telecommunications
equipment and services remain accessible.

      The Commission is not charged with enforcing criminal statutes
or prosecuting toll fraud perpetrators.  The Department of
Justice, local law enforcement agencies, and the U. S. Secret Service
are among the agencies charged with the enforcement of criminal
statutes.  Nevertheless, the Commission has taken several steps toward
developing solutions to toll fraud.  First, the Commission issued a
series of "Consumer Alerts" describing the dangers posed by
telecommunications fraud and steps that can be taken to detect and
prevent it.  Second, on October 9, 1992, we convened an _en banc_
hearing on Toll Fraud.  Panelists representing telecommunications
consumers, carriers, equipment vendors, insurance providers, and law
enforcement agencies presented diverse perspectives and detailed
proposals for detection, prevention, and responsibility.  (See
Appendix B) Following the hearing, the Commission encouraged further
comment by holding the record on toll fraud open until November 16,
1992.  Third, the Commission has taken action in related
proceedings to address toll fraud concerns.  In July 1992, in the
operator service rulemaking proceedings, the Commission required local
exchange carriers to offer services, to reduce payphone providers' and
other aggregators' exposure to toll fraud.  Earlier, in 1990, the
Commission adopted standards for direct inward dial (DID) calls which
required answer supervision on DID calls routed back to the public
switched network by a PBX.  This amendment of Part 68 of the
Commission's rules was initiated because carriers were losing tens of
millions of dollars of revenue in cases where PBXs failed to return an
answer supervision signal to the central office, notifying it of a
billable call.  The Commission continues to resolve formal and
informal complaints that raise toll fraud issues.

 The Commission also coordinates with industry, consumers,
vendors, and law enforcement agencies.  Commission staff attends
meeting with industry groups working to formulate prospective
solutions to toll fraud problems. Some fraud issues appear to
have been resolved by the industry, including, for example, dial tone
reorigination, which permits the calling party to receive a second
dial tone after the original call is terminated.  The industry also
has implemented intercompany cooperation on live call tracing.  Many
carriers have recently responded to the widespread concerns about toll
fraud by offering services designed to provide early detection and
prevention of the problems.

    It does not appear, however, that private action can resolve all
toll fraud problems or that incentives to control fraud are structured
in the best possible way.  For example, the recent "Chartways" formal
complaint proceeding presented the issue of liability for charges
associated with unauthorized calls.  Chartways, the complainant, was a
private branch exchange (PBX) owner.  It learned from AT&T that an
unusual volume of calls to Pakistan was originating at its PBX.  A
subsequent investigation revealed that the calls were apparently being
routed through the remote access feature of the PBX.  Although
Chartways informed AT&T that the calls were unauthorized, AT&T
maintained that Chartways was liable for the related charges under the
general payment obligation of AT&T's tariffs.  Chartways responded by
filing a formal complaint against AT&T with the Commission.  The
complaint alleged that AT&T's attempt to collect the charges was
unreasonable and discriminatory, thus violating sections 201(b) and
202(a) of the Communications Act. The Common Carrier Bureau
denied the complaint based on a largely stipulated record, and
following the same analysis we denied Chartways' application for
review of the Bureau decision. First, we found that the Bureau
was correct in determining that the tariff provisions at issue were
clear and definite in requiring payment for the calls, in that the
tariff provisions recognized no exception to the general payment
obligation for unauthorized usage. Next we affirmed the fining
that Chartways had control over the disputed calls. We noted
that Chartways had stipulated that it had "the capability to restrict
access to and egress from its PBX" at all times.  Moreover, while the
record contained no evidence that AT&T was negligent in any way with
regard to the unauthorized calls, it also showed that Chartways had
taken no steps available to it to detect or prevent unauthorized
calling through its PBX.  Finally, we agreed that AT&T's practices in
this case were not discriminatory when compared to its liability
limits on unauthorized calling card using because calling card
liability is controlled explicitly by a specific federal statute and
related regulations.  

     In _United Artists_, we examined the question of liability for
charges associated with unauthorized calls that were either originated
or accepted at the complainant's payphones.  The threshold issue
in the case was whether United Artists was AT&T's "customer," because
only a "customer" who "orders" service could be held liable for
charges under the terms of AT&T's tariff. We determined that the
customer for the operator-assisted calls at issue was the caller or
billed party, not United Artists, the owner of the payphones. We
also found that United Artists did not presubscribe its payphone lines
to AT&T for direct-dialed service.  We then looked at whether
United Artists had otherwise ordered service from AT&T, stating that
if United Artists "had failed to take steps to control unauthorized
operator-assisted and direct-dialed calling and had, instead,
installed its phones in such a way as to allow callers to charge such
calls to its payphone lines, [United Artists] could reasonably be
held to have constructively 'ordered' service from AT&T, thus
establishing an inadvertent carrier- customer relationship."  The
record showed that United Artists had adopted a number of measures
designed to control potentially fraudulent calling.  For example,
it told the local exchange carrier, New York Telephone (NYT), that its
lines were to have no primary interexchange carrier at all.  It also
ordered originating line and billed number screening services from
NYT, which were intended to inform operator service providers such as
AT&T of any billing restrictions on those lines.  In addition to
such preventative steps, United Artists also monitored calling from
its phones and regularly reported any apparently fraudulent calling to
NYT and AT&T.  Based on the record, we concluded that United Artists
did not intentionally or constructively order service from AT&T and
therefore could not be held liable as a customer for the disputed
charges.
