et Cetera is exactly what it says..  "and other things" if i'm not mistaken.  
it will conduct interviews on random topics (we'll try to cover EVERYTHING at
least once!)  have alot of feedback and have some creative writing in the 
second section of the zine with little nibblets about the artists...  it's fun
and serious, mundane and inspired, pointless and focused.. all in one.   we'll
do everything about nothing and nothing about everything.  it is published and
distributed electronically as often as i can (which may not be very often).

                              EDITOR'S NOTES
                        (mindless ramblings to follow)


     this is, of course, the debut issue of et Cetera - something i've been
meaning to do for a long time but have never gotten around to it because of
phenomenal sloth and the simple lack of work to publish.  it's truly amazing to
me how unbelievably hard it is to coax people into submitting their work. 
perhaps it is the format - so you won't really see yourself in print (although,
i'm planning on a print version soon) - this is by far, the most accessible
form for the work to take on.  so get it out.  it's doing no good sitting in
your scrapbook.  
     i did get a few brave souls to submit and i thank them wholeheartedly. 
the best works are what you see in this first issue.  also, i asked alot of
people to answer some very bizzare, disjointed questions and i'd like to thank
the ones who answered them first and THEN laughed at me.
     a bit about myself.  i just graduated with a BS in zoology (i should've
majored in english, too, but a double major was looking more and more
unattractive the longer i stayed in college) and i'm working in a thrombolysis
lab trying to find a better treatment for broken hearts before i go to a MSTP
next year.  i'm wondering what i'm doing in the real world and i've decided i'm
going to stay in school for the rest of my life after this year.
     why am i doing this?  (caring thoughtful responses below)

     "Why the hell are you doing this?  Are you that bored?" - Julian Nam
     "He has nothing else to do, he is Oklahoma for God's sake." - Brett Reece
     "Steve is lonely, eccentric, and losing his mind." - Lori Georgeson
     "Steve is up to something.  Steve is curious.  Steve is too weird so why
      try to even think about getting inside his head." - Youlee Kim
     "He's extremely board" - Marvin Puymon

they're all right (especially Brett) except for Marvin - i have no idea what he
was thinking about when he wrote his response.  the fact of the matter is that
i'm living in oklahoma for one year and i have no reason not to do it.  not to
say that oklahoma is the armpit state of the union (new jersey deserves that
honor), it's more like the sole-of-your-feet state of the union.  everyone
steps on it for no better reason than that it's there.  in support of oklahoma,
there are few other places where you can hear an "alternative" country station
interfering with a classic country station and enjoy that raw, unadulterated
angst.
     well, enjoy this first issue.  if you're reading this, i'd like to know
just how many people are seeing this (so i know what degree of embarassment i
should be experiencing) so drop me a line at the above address just to let me
know that you've looked at it.  any comments, submissions, and volunteers for
interviews are welcome.  enjoy!

                            THE DIRTY FOGGY WINDOW

???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

     I know that this is the babble that I'm supposed to put in the editorial,
but since this is the first issue and the stuff above is windy anyway, I
thought I would split it up into two sections and give the illusion of brevity
and substance.  Also, hopefully, I will con someone into doing some of this for
me (someone else with alot of time and little direction in life can help me
with a postscript version of this, too).  
     Just last friday, the Nobel Prize Committee announced the winners of the
1994 Noble Prize.  Ironically, the Noble Peace Prize goes to Arafat.  After
hearing this, my mind has only one response, "huh?"  I would've given it to
Mandela but, he's already got one.  Give it to the American hick before Arafat
though.  What I don't understand is how does a man who was a self-proclaimed
terrorist, mass murderer, amoral, subhuman butcher for the vast majority of his
public life come away with the Nobel Peace Prize for acting like a normal human
being?  Sure Carter broke some policy during negotiations but...  anyway, to
cut to the chase, I have the official defense of the committee right here for
your inspection:

"Oh, I thought he was getting a prize for best dressed in the middle east."
                              -BR (lame excuse for a bad choice)

"I used to think it was hard to get the Nobel Peace Prize, but it looks like 
 any fool can get it now.  Hell, even you may get it Steve!"
                              -DK (his dissent of the decision)

"It just seemed like the natural sort of thing for the estate of a major 
 dynamite manufacturer to do.  After all, he's been one of our best customers 
 over the years."             -JM (truth)
                         
"Apparently the Nobel Prize committee (we) has recently begun "a most peaceful
 terrorist" prize.  The committee's PR people have been pretty slow getting
 this information out to the rest of the world."
                              -AE (I knew there was an explanation for this) 
 
I just happened to notice that our friend Saddam Hussein was camping on the
fence again.  Why?  The opinion of our Middle East expert, LG.

"Saddam Hussein is an attention-starved idiot who can't believe that some other
 person could be in the news more than he is."

Obviously, Hussein believes HE should've won the Noble Peace Prize.  But what
does he hope to accomplish?

     "He's stupid" -EA

Now that we got that cleared up, let's go on to the Noble Prize for Medicine. 
This went to Gilman and     for their work on G proteins.  So I went back to
the committee and asked them what G proteins were.

"G protein is the new potion that you can take to attract "G"irls."
               -JN (obviously been sitting on the committee too long)

"I think it's involved with GTP or something like that."
               -PR (hmm.. this is what you get when you ask a senior premed
                    to sit on the committee)

"what the heck is a G protein?  Do I need to know this for interviews?"
               -BR (same comment as above)

"I think it has something to do w/ signal transduction."
               -MN (ahhh, yes... and this from a mathematician!)

Which brings us to my mutual fund which has for some odd reason been quickly
disintegrating into a black hole of financial oblivion.  This is the
conversation I had with my financial consultant a few days ago.

     "Hello, this is Harry Pitts."  <--name changed for privacy
     "Hello, Mr. Pitts, this is Steve Lee." <--this is me talking
     "Oh, hi Steve, how are you?"
     "Fine, but why isn't my mutual fund?"
     "Well, uh, hmmm..  Well, Steve, the reason is that.. blah blah blah... and
that the global market..etc etc etc... and trade agreements...blah blah...and
Japan...a downward trend...fourth quarter returns...predict...rise...global
economy...   Now do you understand?"
     "Uh, yes, of course!  Thank you."  <--this is me lying my head off because
I didn't understand a word he said.

So I've decided to ask some of my friends why this is happening to me?

"Because you have the wrong mutual fund."
               -Marvin Puymon

Obviously this is what happens when you ask a physicist about money.  So I
asked Brett Reece for a translation of the above translation.

"Well, the market has had a tough time of things lately.  Your mutual fund is  
 not diverse enough to fight off the general trends of the market as a whole.
 There are several mathematical models to prove this...."

Ok, that's where he lost me.  If anyone has a real reaon, email me at the
address given above.  Ok, now to the Heart of the matter.

                                 MATH ANXIETY
                                 ------------


          We fit the world in equation.
          Shoring it up with subscript and superscript,
          We bounce down the narrow channel of the equal sign.
          Who will admit they're turned around, twisted knee to nose;
                              flipped out by a 3;
                         cut short with 5;
                              laid back on a 6?

          This ain't the move we thought it was.
          Someone somewhere made us learn the number sentence.
          The empty parts we marked with letters, 
          And there were numbers for the letters. 
          But now the numbers trip us too.
          The slippery space between the variable *a* and its power of 4
          Scares us so much more than the vampire/gargoyle/werewolf, 
          All-too-human demon of the horror matinee.
          Could *a* = *a*, or *A* , or maybe 0?
          The sun burns 93 million miles away, but it's drowning today in      

    
          the clouds.
          The dark not-known holds us off.
          Knocks back our giddy desires.
          But could it be

          These figures point to a magic in matter itself?
          A drive that won't allow a simple device, but demands participation;
                       that gives the static its will to stay;
                       that launches abstraction's loop into the void;
                       which is tingling with delight.

                           Whose bruised metropolis
                           ------------------------



               paralyzed buildings perforate the smog
                 their peaks bleed from our waste
                 their bodies asphyxiate in the breeze
                 their limbs drip with venomous dust
                  - the green daydreams inside are critical
                    to keep them alive

               potholed city streets imagine maps
                 and their symbolic immunity
                 wishing, for once, they could be
                an imitation, an apparition, a generic replica
                of themselves
                                                                               
               stagnant air floats among the stories
                - an attitude without sanity
                 high enough for the buildings
                low enough for the natives
                obviously shared by everyone who exists -
                 all too indisputable to offset
                when wealth is the fulcrum
                                                                               
               sufferers are apparent amid the chaos
                the coughing
                 the wheezing
                  the gasping
                   the death
                of the children give it away

               there appears to not be enough intelligence
                to go around
                 instead, it is goes down
                deep into the earth 
                 to exhume what is deliberately too deep to abuse

               just a few miles removed
                beyond the diseased structures
                 the decaying avenues
                 the dying air
                  lies the countryside
                - the fairy tale environment
               with a fatal ending all too common
                in our uranium century

This was my first sort of foray into prose poetry.  I wrote it while in Joyce  
Peserofs poetry workshop at Emerson College in Boston almost a year ago.    
This is also the first poem I have turned into a video poem.

                         carved upon hidden walls

                         hopes of immortal bliss
                         innocent joy is no longer

                         comes to here or there.
                         and everywhere the fading cries
                         of perpetual pain of loss
                         of things that never were
                         or can be. alone. a life
                         stagnant attrition from truth
