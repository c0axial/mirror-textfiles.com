COMPETITIVE PHONE COMPANYS REACT:

       MCI and GTE Sprint announced plans to reduce their LD rates effective
June 1.  The two companies said their rates would be competitive with AT&T,
which had been earlier announced in TSR Issue #1 of the rate cut also
effective June 1. Including 11.4 percent for day and evening hours and many
other similar reduction.

NWB'S INTRO TO 'SMART PHONES':

       NorthWestern Bell's Public Services line of business is field
trialing a new coin phone product - one it had a hand in creating.  The new
coin phone product is the NBT(tm) 1062 Coin Phone Retrofit Kit designed by
NWBell  Technologies.  The kit  converts standard public  coin phones -
dependent on central office electronics - into "stand alone" coin phones,
which has been labeled by codename as "Smart Phones."  There are many new
features of which customers will not notice.  Although the only noticeable
change between the retrofited coin phones and the traditional public coin
phones is the voice in the retrofited mode, generated by the kit's electronic
circuit board.  It instructs user to deposit money.  Currently the Smart
Phones are being tested in 40 coin phones around the NorthWestern Bell.

LOCAL AREA NETWORKS (LAN):

       A Local Area Network is a system of hardware and software that
connects a variety of similar and dissimilar communications devices.  These
devices typically are operated by a single company for internal use within a
limited geographical area.  The System allows high speed communications
between devices on the network while maintaining data security, Bell so
boldly claims.  A variety of transmission media are available in the LAN
marketplace.  These categorize the major types of Local Area Networks in use
presently.  The most prevalent are twisted pair (copper) and fiber optic
cable.  Because of its superior transmission capabilities, fiber is considered
to be the media of choice for the foreseeable future within Bell.  More info.
on LAN will be presented in issue #3.
