Exposition:

   Once again, TSReport now excepts outside sources. Anyone can write/provide
   information to the Syndicate Report. The Syndicate Report is also altering
   format.  Rather than  concentrating mainly on BELL orientated information,
   the Syndicate Report now has a more broad interest.  Thus, TSR now handles
   all types of news gatherings.

   All articles have been presented by me unless shown at the end of the
   article as the information provider(s).

Extra Note:  10 Days as of this date before summer freedom!

PACIFIC BELL DELAYS TESTING ON PROJECT VICTORIA DEVICE:

       In a responce to an FCC decision concerning Project Victoria equipment,
Pacific Bell said it has postponed its fall LA field test of that technology
and further development on it.
       Project Victoria is a technology that uses multiple-channel access
system at each site to allow a single telephone line to carry up to seven
simultaneous voice and data channels.  The lineis divided into two 32-kbps
voice channels, one 9600-bps datachannel, and four 1200-bps data channels.
Currently, seven telephone lines are needed to provide this capability.

       The Common Carrier Bureau of the Federal Communications Commission ruled
March 30 that the multiple-channel access system must be treated as customer
premises equipment (CPE).  In other words, the bureau said the device was
similar to a telephone and consequently could  be provided by an vendor.
Pacific Bell had wanted the device to be classified as a multiplexer, which
would allow it to be considered part of the service and not available from
other vendors.  Pacific Bell recently filed a statement with the FCC asking for
reconsideration.
       The companies that have opposed Pacific Bell include IBM, Tymnet,
Telenet, Western Union, and the Independant Data Communications Manufacturers
Associations (IDCMA).

COALITION FIGHTS EFFORTS TO DEREGULATE BELL:

       The unlikely coalition of computer manufacturers, consumers, and AT&T is
opposing efforts by the Department of Justice to deregulate the regional Bell
Operating Companies (BOCs), which would allow them full entry into computer and
information service activities.
       Currently, the BOCs are restrained from making equipment and providing
many information services.  Those restrictions are being challenged in the
courts via a Department of Justice brief, and in Congress via H.R.2030, a bill
introduced on April 9.  "The Justice Department, three short years after the
breakup (of AT&T), is proposing another round of radical chang in the system --
change that could drive rates up and bring service down," said Sen. Howard
Metzenbaum in April 30 hearings on the Justice Department's move.

       Officials from BOCs testified that current regulations hamper
their efforts to provide services and harm the United States' utilization of
existing phone networks.
       The Justice Department's proposal is being considered by Judge Harold
Greene of the US District Court in Columbia, who presided over the breakup of
AT&T three years ago.  Department of Jusice officials do not except him
to make a decision until late summer at the earliest.

HACKERS AT HIGH SCHOOL MAKE REPORT CARDS:

       Northwest Virginia- Most public high schools in Virginia uses desk top
computers.  But, Northdual High school uses these computers not only to educate
the students, but also to develop report cards.  It seems that a group of
hackers from the school got into the school's computer via datacommunications,
and copies the desk top and file for making the report cards.  They sold the
report cards to fellow students with pre-marked grades.  The hackers were
caught after a locker search.  Each student hacker are suspended till the end
of the year.  No charges were pended.

  ============================================================================

GAMBLING HACKERS BREAK CASINO COMPUTER:

       Las Vega- A group of computer hackers employed at a Casino in downtown
Las Vegas were charged with tampering with Casino Computers.  Apparently the
computers were used by the Casino Room to pre-radomly pick cards and
distribute them to the players.  The Casino Hackers cracked the gambling
computer and copied from defined cards in decks.  The hackers used them to bet
millions of dollars on the card game.  They were caught with the numbers while
exchanging valid codes.  The Casino Room's name and Hackers were not
identified.

FBI WARNS COMPUTER STORES IN WAKE OF SERIAL BOMBINGS:

       An unidentified serial bomber who has already killed one man and injured
21 others may be targeting computer-related businesses and university depart-
ments, the FBI said last week.
       The agency is warning computer retailers and universities that the
bomber may strike again soon, according to F. Call, and special agent with
the FBI.

       Since 1978, the bomber has either mailed or placed at least a dozen
explosive devices in eight cities from Chicago to San Francisco.  The last two
incidents have occurred at computer stores in Sacramento, Calif., and
Salt Lake City.  A bomb placed outside the rear entrance of Rentech in
Sacramento on December 11, 1985, killed the store's owner.  The last  bombing
linked to the man occurred on February 20, 1987, at Caam's Inc., Salt Lake City
computer store, injuring one employee.
       The materials and techniques used in making the bombs have led
investigators to conclude they are the working of a single individual.  A
special task force call Unabom, composed of agents from the FBI, the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and U.S. Postal Inspectors is offering a 60,000$
reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the bomber.
       Persons with information about the bomber are asked to call the Unabom
hotline at 801-359-1917, or their local FBI office.

STATE BILL PROTECTING ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATON:

       Sacramento, CA -- An amendment to the Calif. state constitution that
would give electronic communicaton the same freedom of expression and privacy
protection as print and verbal communication has been proposed by a LA
legislator.
       Assembly Constitutional Amendment No. 36 (ACA 36), drafted by
assemblywoman Gwen Moore, would amend the state's constitution to prohibit any
law from restrining or abridging access to the means of electronic
communication.  It would also protect personal data stored in electronic info.
systems and computer databases from search and seizure without a warrant
describing the location to  be searched.

       While no other state has a similar law, the bill resembles the
Electronic Communications Privacy Act passed by Congress last October.  But
that protects users from federal untrusion, while ACA 36 would protect Calif.
users from state intrusion as well.
       If the amendment eventually passes both houses of the state legislature,
the public would vote on it in June 1988.

       WRITE YOUR CONGRESSMAN PEOPLE!  I know I would want this bill to
be passed.

NEW ENGLAND BELL PLANNING TO OFFER ISDN:

       New England Telephone and Telegraph Co. plans to offer its customers the
high speed voice, data, text, and video transmission capabilities of
ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) after testing the technology
this summer.
       The intro. of ISDN technology into New England Telephone's network will
begin in July with a trial conduted between four of its downtown Boston
locations.  The trail is scheduled to last eight months and will involve 75
ISDN lines.

       ISDN tech. allows voice, text, data and video to be transmitted
simultaneously over the telephone line at high speeds.  Initially, the
company will connect 50 personal computers, several local area networks,
and approximately 100 ISDN telephones.
       After the completion of the July test, the company plans
to offer ISDN to its customers in the New England area.  The fees have not
been determined.
       New England Telephone estimates that it will spend more than 2$ billion
between 1987 and 1989 on ISDN tech.  Currently, more than 100 digital switching
systems are in service, along with more than 50,000 miles of fiber cable in
its fiber optic telephone systems.
