       Just as 1989 was about the close quietly, the United States strikes
against the Noriegian Regime -- it's now dead.  It's incredible that all of us
are currently witnessing history.  You know about history, don't ya?  Sure you
do.  Remember sitting in class wondering what it would be like to live
during a time of absolute CHANGE.  --And mostly for the better.

    This issue is dedicated to 1989.  May the 1990s reveal more.

NEW: TELENET PCP THIEF HACKER                                            TSR
"Programed by Brew Associates"

         Computer hacking utilities.  They all start out with one single
purpose:  To Gain Information.  Isn't information gathering the basis for
hacks?  What I mean is that basic hackers do menial jobs for hacks.  A hack
uses that information (code/password, etc) to gain more information.  It all
seems very irrelevant.
         Now I come back to earth, and remember we all are human beings.

         The under terra firma personality:  Brew Associates has done it again,
with the swiftness of a prowler, he has created PC Pursuit Thief.  The
Exciter's long rein at the top of PCP Hacker's has come to a halt.  The end of
perfection for Code Thief has prompted him to go onto a more comfortable stall
via PCP Telenet.  PCP Thief has the same similar style for with windows and
everything.
         AND, I agree totally.  Straight code abusing from your own home is
crazy.  Dialing PCP shows little threat to hack/phreakdom.

         I and Professor Falken has been Beta testing future releases of PCP
Thief.  The first BETA version quicken returned to the drawing board.  The
second was just about finished except some minor detail.  After that, fancy
features were added to as savor.

"SAFE" GOVERNMENT SOFTWARE:                                         TSR


       As early as 1967, the Department of Defense formed a task force to set
security standards for computers, operating systems, and networks.  The goal:
to define the criteria for "trusted" systems that could be relied upon to
police themselves and their users and prevent sensitive information from
getting into the wrong hands.  After more than a decade of research, their
efforts were compiled in the "DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TRUSTED SYSTEM EVALUATION
CRITERIA" --known as "THE ORANGE BOOK" because of its orange cover.

       The Orange Book specifies four levels, or divisions, of protection,
designated (in order of increasing security) D, C, B, and A.  Systems in
Division A systems must be mathematically proven to be secure (a requirement
that's barely within reach of any commercial computer OS).  The control
objectives for each level are divided into three categories:  security policy,
accountability, and assurance.

  ()  Mandatory Policy =  Admin. grants users access to specific data -- and
                          that such data ONLY.  A user has access to data for a
                          good reason.  1, that person has proper clearance;
                          and 2, the person has a need to know the information
                          for his/her job.  A user with this access can grant
                          other such access.

  ()  Accountability   =  Makes sure that users are accountable for their
                          actions.  There are 3 requirements to ensure
                          this accountability.  First, the user has to ID
                          her/his self to the system.  Second, a password
                          is then required.  And third, a user's actions
                          must leave an audit trial so that admins. can find
                          out "who dunnit" if information is abused.

  ()  Assurance Policy =  Requires that the system be designed, tested, and
                          verified so as to make sure that first two object-
                          ives are met.  There must be a high degree of
                          confidence that the system's security mechanisms
                          can't be circumvented by bright "hackers" or
                          knowledgeable users.  The Orange Book emphasized that
                          the assurance process doesn't end when the system is
                          shipped or installed; every system modification and
                          every new feature that's added needs to be checked
                          for security breaches.  Only then, can the system be
                          TRUSTED.

POKING AROUND PRODIGY (IBM/Sears Joint Venture):                     TSR (t.s)

       I got my first bill for Prodigy this month, after three spine tingling
FREE months on-line Prodigy.  9.95$ just as they said it would be.  I don't
even remember if that was before or after Minnesota 6% sales tax.

    IMPRESSED WITH?  I'm impressed with the amount of attention they are giving
Prodigy.  I've received many newsletters, about 5 or 6 just in one month.  The
letters explain all the new enhancements online -- easily accessible with their
(J)ump words -- a very decent idea.  I'm also impressed with the on-line
technical help, both via 1-800 and HELP99A (Mailbox Address).  The technical
help via HELP99A isn't real bright, but they do offer some good basic
hints/information, and best of all -- they've always responded.  I've ask them
about the CGA color, and if a new version of the Prodigy terminal software were
coming out to support mice, etc.  They explained both very completely.  A new
version is expected in Spring, maybe February.   And lastly, this month, I'm
impressed with the amount of people are accepting Prodigy.  I get quite a bit
of feedback about Prodigy from users, and most don't even mention the slowness
and generic look....probably because most are generic users.

    One last word about updates.  Your Prodigy software is actually updated
right under you nose.  How? You say?  Well, each time you log into Prodigy, it
uploads updated modification directly to your harddrive/floppies.  It stores
the updated information in a file by the name of STAGE.DAT.  So if you see this
things fluctuating in size/date -- you know what's it doing.  What's the
current level of modification?  There are two numbers that tell you.  One is on
the label of the Prodigy Software installation disks (v2.1) in the lower right
hand corner.  There's another number in the lower right corner of the logon
screen.  It refers to an internal system Prodigy uses to denote changes and
modifications, many of which are minor and incremental.  That number should be:
6.03.xx (The 'xx' will be a number, but that number doesn't matter as much as
the 6.03).

    NO IMPRESSION LEFT:  The service is good, but I didn't pay for it.  There
has to be more information online that interests me.  More
political/social/telcom information and news.  Number two, the speed HAS to
increase.  Sometimes I don't have access to a 2400 baud modem, and I'm caught
using 1200 bps.   There is a huge difference!  Time is money these days, and
Prodigy isn't delivering me my moneys worth (even though it's only 9.95/month).
    And of course those annoying ONLINE error codes:  CM, DM, API, OMCM, to
name a few.  Here's a run down on them...

    CM:  Problem detected by comm. module which controls the flow of
         information between your PC, modem, the fone lines and computer you
         call when you logon the service.  Usually you'll see CM4, 5 or 6.  The
         type of error can be caused by local connections, or you may be
         logging into the service during the off hours.  Just reconnect to
         Prodigy...it usually clears the air.

   API:  Indicates a problem in a particular usage on the service -- the one
         you were just using.  Problems like this are usually only momentary,
         in time, and self correct.  API 8 or API 15 imply that the PC isn't
         getting enough memory to Prodigy.  Check & clear resident programs.

    DM:  The scene module shows this code when there's not enough PC memory
         available.  You can boot your system and logon again.  Make sure you
         have at least 512 ram.  Nothing resident.  Make a self-booting disk if
         you have to accommodate.

  OMCM:  This code is narrative jointly by two different modules/scenes.
         This is what happens:  Every message (i.e. assortment of info) Prodigy
         sends to your PC has two parts; the message contents, and special
         info. Prodigy's software uses to make sure the message itself is
         error-free.  If there is errors, you get an OMCM code.  OMCM6 is a
         version of this code that means you're not using the most recent
         version of Prodigy -- version 2.1.  If you don't, dial 800-767-3664
         for you'll receive it free of charge.  OMCM9 indicates a poor
         transmission, once again, or line quality.  Also, your message
         expected by your system was not received.  Rather than have you wait
         for a message that isn't coming (and thereby tie you up), Prodigy
         sends this error code.  You might as well relog in.

      If you don't have the latest version of Prodigy, dial 1-800-356-3664 and
you'll receive the updated version in the mail.

                         Case was 24.  At 22, he'd been a cowboy,
              a rustler, one of the best in the Sprawl.  He'd
              been trained by the best, by McCoy Pauley and Bobby
              Quine, legends in the biz.  He'd operated on an
              almost permanent adrenaline high, a by product of
              youth and proficiency, jacked into a custom
              cyberspace deck that projected his disembodied
              consciousness into the consensual hallucination
              that was the matrix.  A thief, he'd worked for
              other, wealthier thieves, employers who provided
              the exotic software required to penetrate the
              bright walls of corporate systems, opening windows
              into rich fields of data.

                                 $$$$$$$$$$$$$

                                 Case's virus had bored a window
              through the library's command ice..  He punched
              himself through and found an infinite blue space
              ranged with color-coded spheres strung on a tight
              grid of pale blue neon.  In the nonspace of the
              matrix, the interior of a given data construct
              possessed unlimited subjective dimension.  He began
              to glide through the spheres as if he were on
              invisible tracks.

                     Here, this one.
                     Punching his way into the sphere, chill blue
                     neon vault above him starless and smooth as
                     frosted glass, he triggered a subprogram
                     that effected certain alterations in the
                     core custodial commands.

                                 Out now.  Reversing smoothly,
              the virus reknitting the fabric of the window.
                                 DONE.
