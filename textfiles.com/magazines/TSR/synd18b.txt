ABBIE HOFFMAN AT DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION:               TSR (t.c 11\27)

       (This is just a outline/converstion to Abbie Hoffman at the Democratic
National Convention.)

       Standing on the up escalator at the Convention, I spot Abbie Hoffman,
alumnus of the '68 Democratic National Convention, standing on the adjacent 
down escalator.  Abbie Hoffman.  Flamboyant member of the Chicago Seven. 
Former fugitive from justice and plastic surgery patient.

  Author of:  'Revolution for the Hell of It' -- 'Steal this Book'
                              'Steal this Urine Test'

       ...and most recently, a comrade-in-arms of college protester Amy Carter
in the well-publicized legal battle with the CIA over its campus recruitment
tactics.  Abbie's hair and beard are graying and his color is sallow.  He wears
a red lifeguard shirt and shorts.  There is a  big plastic cast on one hand
and a bandage on one foot.  Reaching the uppper level, I go to the railing
and watch Abbie get off the escalator on the floor below.  Unlike many of the
notables I have seen, Abbie does not walk with a rushed, purposeful, type-A
gait.  He strolls casually up to a souvenir table and begins looking over the
merchandise.  He picks up a white baseball cap with "DNC" written across the
front, tries it on, and, still wearing it, wanders odnw to the other end of
the table to look at more souvenirs.

       Abbie seems approachable enough.  I take the escalator down, and when
I reach him he is standing away from the table, looking around.  I introduce
myself and extand my hand, grabbing and shaking the plastic cast he is wearing
on his arm.  He studies the press credentials around my neck, "Where you from?"
he says.  "Georgia, by way of Minnesota," I say.
  "Who you writing for?"
  "Twin Cities magazine."
  "Oh, yeah," Abbie Hoffman says, nodding, "I heard of them."  Abbie scans the
crowd distractedly.  He tells me he's here for Vintage Press, writing a book
on the convention.  He's also doing an article for 'Playboy'.  Then he grins
at me for the first time and laughs.  "I'm gonna take a big bite outta Bush!"
  I smile, nod politely.
       Abbie looks down at his lifegaurd get-up.  "Thought I'd dress up for the
occasion," he says.  "Yesterday I was wearing the T-shit that said, 'No Bush,
No Bullshit!' "  He laughs loudly at me again.  Suddenly he grows pensive and
looks around at the crowd some more.  He tells me that he's gotten separated
from his photographer and asks if I knew some easy way to get across the 
street to where the satellite dishes are located behind the Omni, because
that's where he and the photographer pahked the cah. 

  "You mean over near the CBS trailers?"
  "Yeah."
       I think about it. "The only way I know is to walk," I say.
  "Yeah, but I got a broken foot!" he says, pointing.
       I look down at his foot.  "What happened to you?"  I ask.               

  Abbie shrugs.  "I got in an accident with this truck in New Jersey," he says.

  He spots an escalator off to the side, heding down to another floor.
  "Maybe down there, huh?"  He walks over to it, ets on.
  "Take care," I call to him.

  Abbie looks back, raises his cast in salutation, and descends out of sight.
I head back to the other escalators, and, going up, wonder breifly if Abbie
Hoffman paid for the white Democratic National Convention baseball cap he was
wearing.

JOB SCREENING OVER THE PHONE:                             TSR (mod.tech 11\27)

       With the passing of the Employee Polygraph Protection Act by President
Reagan on June 27 banning lie detector, companies wil now have to look for new
methods to screen future job applicants.

       One company offers a unique solution that complies with the new law. 
TeleScreen, Inc. (Atlanta, GA) has developed a computerized, self-administered
telephone interviewing method that lets applicants respond to answers using
a touchtone telephone.  The testing process, also called TeleScreen, is a
series of 150 prerecorded questions convering such areas as previous 
employment, absenteeism, past criminal record, and substance abuse.  
Applicants answer by pressing the "1" key for "Yes," the "3" key for "No," 
and the "0" for "Not Applicable."  The interview is conducted from a toll-free
800 number and takes twenty minutes.

       TeleScreen's creators claim people are less likely to lie with this
method that with traditional tests.  "People are more inclined to be truthful
to a machine than to another human being because the telephone is not 
intimidating," says Charles Lambert, vice president of TeleScreen.

       "All questions are asked with the same non-threatening tone of voice,"
he continues.  "TeleScreen shows consistency and inconsistency in their 
answers.  Applicants cannot look back or see how they answered before."
       The test has been used by over 225 firms.

TAPPING TELEPHONE LINES (Voice/Data) BY AGENT STEAL:           TSR (a.s 11\28)

       ...For phun, money, and passwords - Or how to go to jail for a long
time.  Information included in this article:  Equipment Needed, Where to buy,
How to connect it, How to read recorded data, How I found a Tymnet Node, And
how I got in.

The Equipment:  First thing you need is an audio tape recorder.  What you will  be recording whether it be voice or data will be in an analog autio format.  
From now on, most references will be towards data recording.  Most standard 
cassette recorders will nork just fine.  The two types of recorders I would 
advise staying away from (for data) are micro cassette recorders and the 
standard cassette recorders that have been modified for 8 to 10 hour record 
time.  The speed of these units are too unstable.  Next item you need, oddly
enough, is sold by Radio Shack under the name "Telephone Recording Control" 
Part #43-236 $20-25.00 Page 88 1988 Catalog.

How To Connect It:  The telephone recording control (TRC) has 3 wires coming
out of it.

   #1 Telco wire with modular jack.  Cut this, and seperate into red and green,
and attach some alligator clips.

   #2 Audio wire with minature phone jack (not phone).  This plugs into the
microphone level input jack of tape recorder.

   #3 Audio wire with sub minature phone jack.  This plugs into the "REM" or
Remote Control Jack of the tape recorder.

       Now all you need to do is find the telephone line, connect the alligator
clips, turn the recorder on and come back later.  Whenever the line goes off
the hook, the recorder starts.  Its that simple.

Reading the Data:  This is the tricky part.  Different modems and different
software respond differently but there are basics.  The modem should be 
connected as usual to the Telco line and computer.  Now connect the speaker
output of the tape player directly to the telephone line.  Puck up the phone
and dial the high side of a loop, or silent terminal so your line doesn't make
any noise.  Now, command your modem into the answer modem and press play.  The
tape should be lined up at the beginning of the recorded phone call.  Natually
so you can see the login.  Only one side of the transmission between the host
and terminal can be monitored at a time.  Going to the originate modem you 
will see what the host transmitted.  
       A couple problems may occur with garbled characters.  Try connecting the
speaker output to the microphone of the handset to your phone.  Use a 1 to 1
coupling transformer between the tape player input and the TRC Audio Output. 
These problems are usually caused when using A.C. powered equipment.  1200
baud was difficult to read, but it is possible.  It's nice to have an excellent
modem, also.

How Crazy I Am:  Passwords Galor!  After numberous calls to several Bell
Offices, I found one that handled Tymnet's Account.  Here's a rough transcript:

OP:  Pacific Bell Priority Customer Order Dept. How may I help you?
ME:  Good morning, this is Mr. Miller with Tymnet Inc. We're interested in 
adding some service to out X town location.
OP:  I'll be happy to help you Mr. Miller.
ME:  I need to know how many lines we have coming in on our rotary and if we 
have extra pairs on our trunk.  We are considering adding ten additional lines
on that rotary and maybe some FX service.
OP:  Okay, what's the number this is in reference to?
ME:  XXX-XXX-XXXX (loca node #)
OP:  Hold on....ok, Bla Bla Bla etc.

       Well, you get the idea.  After asking a few more questions I asked her
the address.  No problem, she didn't hesitate.  This all could have been 
avoided with a touch of CNA, but they don't just give out addresses in 
my area.    
       Dressed in my best Telco outfit.  Pac*Bell baseball cap, tool belt and
test set I was out the door.  There it was, just an office building, even had a
computer store in it.  After exploring the building for a while, I found it. 
A large steel door with a push button lock.  Back to the phone, and I found
that service tech. number and chatted with the mgr.

MGR:  Hell, this is Joe Moron.
ME:  Hi, this is Miller ( I like that name ) with PacBel.  I'm down here at 
your x town node and we're having problems locating a gas leak in one of our
trunks.  I beleive our trunk terminates pressurization in your room.
MSR:  I'm not sure, how can I help?                                             ME:  Well, could you have someone meet me down here or give me the entry code?
MGR:  Sure, the code is 1234.
ME:  Thanks, I'll let you know if there's any trouble.

       So I ran home, got my VCR (Stereo) and picked up another TRC from Trash
Shack.  I connected the VCR to the first to imcoming lines on the rotary.  One
of each channel (left,right).  Since the volume of calls is almost consistant,
it wasn't neccesary to stop the recorder between calls.  The VCR was placed 
under the floor, in case a tech. happened to come by for problems.  These nodes
are little computer rooms with air conditioners and raised floors.  The modems
and packet equipment are all rack mounted behind glass.  Also, most of the 
nodes are unmanned.  This is what I got:  A lot of above 300 bps connections, 
Credit Card verifications, and the rest as follows:
                                                                                     Easylink, Compuserve, Quantumlink, 3MMail, People Link, Dow Jones,
     Homebanking, USPS, Crystler Parts Order, Yamaha Parts, & Ford Parts

       When I went back down there the code had been changed.  Why?  Well I 
didn't want to find out.  I was out of there! I told a couple people who later
I found could not to trusted, oh well.  Better safe the sorry.  If you need to
reach me, dial Lunatic Labs at 415-278-7421.

//AT&T Wins Pentagon Computer Competition//

   The American Telephone & Telegraph Co. has won a spirited competition to 
provide thousands of new computers to the Defense Department, establishing 
its position in the industry for years to come with what has been described 
as the computer contract of the century.

   The contract was worth $929.1 million.

   AT&T officials said its value could ultimately exceed $1 billion, depending
on the options exercised.

   The Air Force, which acted as the agent for the other services in 
overseeing the bidding, said an AT&T subsidiary, AT&T Technologies Inc., 
had been selected over five competitors and would now be expected to 
deliver some 20,000 mini-computers over the next five years.

//Brain Enrolls in School//

      An obnoxious brain recently found its way onto the University 
of Houston campus. The Pakistan micro-computer virus, which 
displays the word "Brain" on the disk it infects, was found in the 
university's College of Business, says Computerworld. The virus 
did no real harm, school officials said. It has also appeared at 
Bowie, Md., State College and Providence Journal Co. in Rhode 
Island.
