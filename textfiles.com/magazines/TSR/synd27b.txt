VIRUSES IN THE USSR:                                         TSR (p.f.  12\29)


   Viral programming was of little or no importance in the past, because it's
effects only happened to the Westerners.  Well that's what the majority of
Soviet scientists thought before August 1988.  These Soviet scientists are
'researchers' at the Institute of Programed Systems, at Pereslavl-Zalessky,
USSR.

   August 1988 was a infamous record setting day in the Supreme Soviet State.
For it was the day the Soviet-named 'DOS-62' virus took its toll upon IBM
computers at the laboratory of the Institute of Programed Systems and The
International Children's Computer Summer Camp, also held being
held there.  DOS-62 appends itself to all .COM extension files, once no more
non-infected .COM files can be found it starts deleting files, and performing a
reboot of the system after each.  Unfortunately, shortly
after this virus was found, they quickly made a cure for it.  Figuring
out if you have this virus is quite easy, unless every program you have
automatically reboots the system and deletes itself.

   In November of 1988 a second virus, the 'Black Hole' virus attacked
computers at the Computer Cooperative in Moscow.  This virus becomes a
TSR and infects all .EXE & .COM files.  On Friday the 13th, any infected
program that is executed will actually get deleted.  I personally like this
virus because it sends NOP (No OPeration) instructions to the processor, thus
wasting precious Soviet computer time.  However, that's also its downfall.
This program is easily noticed since performance definate decreases.

   Another virus was found at the Keldysh Institute of Applied
Mathematics.  The virus once run, goes TSR and infects all .EXE and .COM files.
It infects other files as they are run and periodically it makes all letters on
the screen to drop to the bottom in a pile.  Other than
the character falling effect, the program has no other effects.

   The Soviet scientists are doing their best at combating the Virus situation
in the Motherland.  They are programming programs that check
up on the contents of various files on the disk.  They check the
different files, and compute a checksum amount.  This checksum is then compared
with the correct checksum.  If not matching, they write another program to
disinfect the disk.

IMMOBILIZE THE FCC !                                                      TSR


Two years ago the FCC tried and (with your help and letters of protest) failed
to institute regulations that would impose additional costs on modem users for
data communications.

Now, they are at it again.  A new regulation that the FCC is quietly working on
will directly affect you as the user of a computer and modem.  The FCC proposes
that users of modems should pay extra charges for use
of the public telephone network which carry their data.  In addition, computer
network services such as CompuServ, Tymnet, & Telenet would also be charged as
much as $6.00 per hour per user for use of the public telephone network.  These
charges would very likely be passed on to
the subscribers.  The money is to be collected and given to the
telephone company in an effort to raise funds lost to deregulation.

Jim Eason of KGO newstalk radio (San Francisco, Ca) commented on the proposal
during his afternoon radio program during which, he said
he learned of the new regulation in an article in the New York Times.  Jim took
the time to gather the addresses which are given below.

Here's what you should do (NOW!):

 1- Pass this information on.  Download MOBILIZE.ZIP which contains the text
    you are reading now.  Find other BBS's that are not carrying this
    information.  Upload the ASCII text into a public message on the BBS, and
    also upload the file itself so others can easily get a copy to pass along.

 2- Print out three copies of the letter which follows (or write your own) and
    send a signed copy to each of the following:

         Chairman of the FCC
         1919 M Street N.W.
         Washington, D.C. 20554

         Chairman, Senate Communication Subcommittee
         SH-227 Hart Building
         Washington, D.C. 20510

         Chairman, House Telecommunication Subcommittee
         B-331 Rayburn Building
         Washington, D.C. 20515


Here's the suggested text of the letter to send:

   Dear Sir,

   Please allow me to express my displeasure with the FCC proposal
   which would authorize a surcharge for the use of modems on the telephone
   network. This regulation is nothing less than an attempt to restrict the
   free exchange of information among the growing number of computer users.
   Calls placed using modems require no special telephone company equipment,
   and users of modems pay the phone company for use of the network in the form
   of a monthly bill. In short, a modem call is the same as a voice call and
   therefore should not be subject to any additional regulation.

   Sincerely,
   [your name, address and signature]


Try to make up you own letter -- it's much more convincing!

It is important that you act now.  The bureaucrats already have it in their
heads that modem users should subsidize the phone company and are now listening
to public comment. Please stand up and make it clear that we will not stand for
any government restriction on the free exchange of information.

Thanks for your help.

AOS MAY BE CHARGING MORE:                                           TSR (u.t)


   When a person uses a credit card to charge phone calls at a pay phone or
hotel, the user may be using a mom-and-pop type alternative operator service
instead of AT&T, MCI or Sprint, reports Frequent Flyer's January issue. The
AOSs are operated by people leasing long-distance lines from communications
companies.  Often they charge more than the Big Three for calls.

                          FCC SAYS AOS ISN'T ILLEGAL...

   The Federal Communications Commission says alternative operator services are
a scam, but they are not illegal, reports Frequent Flyer's January issue.
Recently the FCC ordered AOS companies to provide rate information to callers
who ask. And, the FCC forbids the abuse known as "call splashing," a means of
hiking phone charges by deliberately routing calls though distant cities.

                          HOW TO AVOID AOS CHARGES...

   Many hotels and most airport phones are served by the alternative operator
service companies, reports Frequent Flyer's January issue. To avoid AOS charges
when using a credit card, after dialing 0 stay on the line until an operator
speaks. Ask the person to identify the service before entering your credit-card
number. Direct access numbers are available through AT&T, MCI and Sprint.

                         MCI PROVIDES DIGITAL SERVICES:

   1-12-90, MCI Communications announced the opening of digital services on the
new PTAT trans-Atlantic fiber optic cable. The route will link the U.S. with
Europe and Bermuda. PTAT is a fiber optic submarine cable that runs between
cableheads in the U.S., the United Kingdom and Bermuda.

                             HDTV SET FOR VIEWING:

   Southern Bell Telephone is going to provide High Definition Television
transmission of the Dec. 7 Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran boxing match
over optical fiber at the Gusman Center for the Performing Arts in Miami. The
satellite transmission will be the nation's first commercial use of HDTV.


                          CHICAGO GETS NEW AREA CODE:

   Chicago metropolitan area will get a new area code for Chicago's suburbs.
Why: Economic growth in the area has outpaced the supply of telephone numbers
there. Saturday, Chicago suburbs now in the 312 area code will change to the
708 area code. Result: An additional 6 million phone numbers will be added.


                           HIGH-TECH TAX SEASON HERE:

   Starting 1-12-90, electronic filing of federal tax returns will be available

electronic filer transmits taxpayer data into the IRS computer, then gives a
copy of the return. Refunds will be ready in two weeks compared to six to 10
weeks for returns.  Check out J.K. Lassers Your Income Tax, or, MacInTax (Both
IBM, MacInTax also available for Max) bother are good programs.  I prefer
MaxInTax for it's ability to run under windows, with the actual graphic form
right on the screen!

LONG DISTANCE SERVICES -- REVEALED:                              TSR (t.s 1\8)


     I must be getting older.  Why, you ask, do I say that?  Well, I've started
to pay for some of my long distance fone calls.  I can only justify myself in
saying that's I do it only to keep my burro out of jail.  I used to scratch at
PCP Telenet's NUA/PCP/'link lines -- but those are not that easy to come by
unless you're out on the systems looking everyday.  Now I hardly have the time
to waste my time like I used to.

      MCI does have corporate secrets.  Yes, it's hard to believe.  And paid
customers can figure them out much easier than unpaid customers.  I got my MCI
LD Card by accident not long ago.  When the information service PRODIGY first
came to my area, I logged in for hours exploring -- trying to find something
I'd like to see everyday.  Well, some of the advertisements were too much, I
had to read some of them.  And there was MCI advertising for FREE LD Cards.  I
thought, what the hell, I'll apply for one.  You ask, why is that strange?
Long ago MCI busted me for using their 341 local access node -- I figured they
put me on a blacklist, which I doubt any of them have -- publicly speaking of
course.  Anyway, I was sent the card!   I soon understood why.  The last name
on the card, was the name I used as a pseudonym on the boards.  I decided to
keep the card.  I dialed up the MCI customer information line and had told them
that someone misspelled every letter in my name -- it's now valid.

       INVALID ATTEMPTS.  A few days later, I started to autodial a few of my
favorite LD systems, using my MCI Calling Card, Telix 3.11, and a bit of sleep.
I usually fall asleep during autodialing if I have nothing better to do at 2 am
in the morning, so I did -- accidently.  I woke up, and apparently I connected
to a system, and it hung on CONNECTED for about 80 minutes, which translates
to over 10.00$ on next month's bill.
       A few days later, I try the calling card out again to do some LD BBSing
again.  (Now remember, this is MY Calling card, which means what I'm doing
is perfectly LEGAL...never thought I'd see myself say that!)  Well, the damn
card turned out to be invalid.  You know how sweats starts to break as you hear
some FBI/SS Agent telling you "Your Constitutional Rights?"  This is the first
thing I thought.  BUT WAIT!  I'm doing all of this legally, as I thought to
myself, I just haven't paid for it yet!  Remember, TS?, like the: Visa,
Dayton's, and Sure Card deals?  I've never felt guilty about taking home a new
CD Player -- so why should I feel it for using LD service on credit?

       THIS IS THE END.  A few days later, at school, I felt brave and dialed
up the MCI Customer Service line again.  I told'em my calling card did work,
and I was wondering WHY.  They asked for my CC number, and I had to verify to
name, fone, address, blood type, sexual preference, and race.  No, just
kidding, I didn't really have to tell customer service my fone -- they already
had it.
       I had to hold on.  Now my mind really started to MARATHON as, they are
going to set up a damned trace!  I started to sweat again.  I was on a
payphone, so I didn't worry.  Then my imagination calmed down.  The guy broke
my mind's mania and said, "OUT AUTOMATIC SECURITY SYSTEMS CANCELED YOUR
CALLING CARD NUMBER BECAUSE IT WAS DIALED OVER 50 TIMES ON THE NIGHT OF XXX."
I quickly set him straight about how I used an autodialer, and I had fallen
asleep that night.  He said, "YEAH, WELL OUT SECURITY SYSTEMS GET THAT MANY
DIALS IN ONE NIGHT, IT'S DETECTED AS TELEPHONE FRAUD, AS THOUGH IT'S COMING
FROM MORE THAN ONE 950/800 NODE."

       Ah-HA!  They can't tell which 950 or 800 node I am dialing from!  That
means that ANI is not resident!  They couldn't even tell if the autodialing
came from the same state for not!  Nor if the 50 or more attempts were dialed
in sequence, or at different times/randomly -- as if 10 different code abusers
were using one code around the country, like so many do!
       Also, when you dial through 1-800 LD lines, or with operator assistance,
LD services can't tell where you are calling from.  The closest ANI they have
is only in the 950's.  And even they are not Feature Group D!  Just don't have
codes like a mad man, and you'll live long.

       This sheds a whole new light on the honest hack.  Remember all those
times when Uncle Sensei scolded and said, "Do not give out you're LD codes
unless you're not going to use them anymore."  This is proof to that statement.
I knew it true all along, but I didn't know to which extent of the LD Fraud
Law.  (Say that 3 times as fast of you can, LD Fraud Law.) Therefore,
hacks/abusers, you now cease to wonder why your posted code is canceled all too
quickly.  Even your own personal code you hacked.  If you're dialing out like a
mad-hack in heat, the code it going to die.

       I've adopted sort of a BETA Testing Standard for LD Service Calling
Cards.  I put cards through certain tests to see what the LD companies do in
response:  cancel card, forget the card, dial me with questions, or simply
nothing.
       Happy 1990, and happy future dialing.

THE HACKER'S CHOICE:  NEW VERSION OF TELIX -- 3.12                   TSR (T.S)

       I was beginning the wonder if a new version of Telix was to ever come
out!  It was over a year since Telix 3.11 had been released, and nothing new
came over the systems.  Then the new came like wild-fire without a cause.  A
new version of Telix, 3.12, had come to America.  The new features weren't
spectacular, no matter, a new version was here.  I wondered if they were
setting it up for resale -- i.e. no more unlimited usage without breaking a
copyright law.  I'd never pay for terminal software, must less anything else.
Look happened to Procomm 2.4.2/Plus.  They're now in every magazine in the
country...boasting as the best terminal software on the market.  Heh, hah,
choke koff koff!  They've never heard of Telix.    It's been mentioned once in
a local newspaper, but that's all -- why?  Who cares, it's mine and I really
enjoy using shareware.

       I guess they are coming out with an even better version, around Spring-
time!  3.12 is just a bug crusher, as was 3.11.  Telix 4.0 -- now doesn't that
sound sweet?  I'd just like to see the new things they have in.  Maybe BiModem
as standard as Zmodem!  Naw, doubt.  Maybe thousands of other features that'd
I'd like to see, but I can't seem to think of more than one right now.  Oh,
well, mouse support is one -- and not like Word Perfect's lame excuse for mouse
support.  It has to be solid.  The 3.11 mouse module got old very quickly.  It
should take on 3 button mice also...yeah, that'd be groovy.

       The new version boasts Desqview awareness.  GREAT idea, even though I
don't use Desq.  I guess I always have that option in the future though.  Also
the doorway mode -- I see no spectacular mark here.  DoorWay mode can be used
BBS Systems which support some of the online programs with a utilitie called
DOORWAY.  It allows any program to be run on the remote computer even if it
does direct screen writes.  It's nice for certain games.

CITADALION SYSOP "FRIES" IN LEGAL HIP-HOP:                               TSR

       You've addorded it ever since direct connect modems came into
performance....autodialing.   Has it ever gotten you into trouble?  I has for
me once or twice -- once upon a time...

      Back in the old days of C64s/Apples, I attempted to redial a local commie
system.  A went to get some beer/pizza or something, and I heard this loud
screech coming from my modem.  It was 911!  I guess it redialed it a few times,
as the lady told me.  I tried to explain everything about computers, and
modems, but she couldn't grasp the idea.  Anyway, I went on with my life, and
I'm here now.   BUT!  Can this sysop say the same?  Read on...

   89Dec28 7:27 am from Sy Borg
You know what happened, right?

   The story up to now is:

   1.  Week of December 7th-8th, we had phone line problems.  Line noise
caused Images to dial out to some residence in maplewood.  I was charged with
harassing telephone calls (ten calls over two days time).  It was all an
honest mistake.

   2.  I write a letter of apology.  The officer involved promised to forward
it to the party involved.  My attormney said "the officer probably pitched it
- he's not going to forward it".  Good.  Because it's all notarized.

   3.  Pre-trial is 21st of January.  I don't have to be there.  My attorney
will, however, be there.  I'll know more then.  The real stuff is going to fly
in the first two weeks of February or thereabouts.

   4.  I'm basically not being paid a huge amount of money, at least in the
realm of legal expenses.  I have been told by my attorney to prepare for
"legal expenses that could amount to thousands of dollars."

   5.  You don't have to, but if you use Images and want to help out, write me
a check to:  Todd Madson, 9522 Penn Circle, Bloomington, MN  55431-2425.

Sy Borg, I read about your problems on Super Comp II, and was totally
astonished. I mean this is some terrible nightmare. Seems to me if you can
prove the phone lines were faulty, that should be enough. Why not sue the
Phone Company?
   Have you tried contacting the complainant directly? I see no reason why you
shouldn't be allowed. I guess it was inappropriate for you to expect a cop to
be a messenger????
   I live in Maplewood now, but don't really know anyone. Who was the person
who complained?
   I don't know what else to say. I have a low-paying part-time job, and have
troubles meeting expenses. I can't offer to pay anything to help out. I just
called to learn more about your problems.
    This is enough to make anyone want to retire from "sysop" duties.
    Best wishes to you, Sy Borg.

   89Dec29 10:34 am from Pee Jay
Sy, if you need any help, let me know. I see no reason why YOU should be
charged with such a crime, when it was a telephone Company error. Don't these
people who complained realize that you didn't do this on purpose? If they do
realize that much, why waste the time of our government system? Why even waste
the time in the first place? If you can, I would suggest that you get a
representative from the phone company to back your story up. Not just a piece
of paper from them, but a actual person.

   89Dec29 1:14 pm from Chucks
Well i see that a full explanation is going to be required for some new heads
around here.. unfortunately i don't feel much like telling it.. but here's
some

The Complainant is not known to Sy.. the officer would not release the name.
  The phone company can't be charged with anything as the phone lines are not
meant to be used for data communications.. ie new fcc dealings..

Apparently the judge and DA are trying to make an example of Sy.. not good
  there's more but i just simply don't have time.. if I am in Error Sy let me
know                             Latre

   89Dec31 1:57 pm from Sy Borg
Chucks:  Your assertion that the phone lines are not to be used for
data-communications is completely wrong.  It doesn't matter - voice call is
the same as a data call.  The complainant is not known to me.  I know the old
phone number, but according to everyone I have spoken to, even if the
complainant involved wanted to drop it now, it is too late.  It's in the legal
system and it is going to happen.

 No, there is no judge or DA involved at the moment.  Who is involved is a
prosecuting attorney who is very determined.  At the moment, the only thing I
can really do is go to court and see what the other side has to say.  I
daresay that I am a lot more prepared than she is.

 Since the complainant, the prosecuting attorney, and the Maplewood police
believe me to be a sick, deranged crank caller - they are building up their
case on that.  They HAVE NO IDEA THAT A COMPUTER IS INVOLVED.  There is no
example being made of me, they just believe they are bringing a crank to
justice.

 The Police won't release the name of the person involved for their
"protection".   That is understandable.  If I really wanted to track them
down, I could grab the old reverse directory from the public library and look
the number up.

  But I don't really want to be accused of harassing the person in any way, so
I'l leaving it dropped.  The letter of apology should be enough.  If it comes
out during the hearing that the letter was never received, then we know that
the Maplewood Police LIED and were not honest in their intentions either.

 Gary, I'll make this an upload/download room.  Simply upload the file here
and give it a descriptive name that people can examine.  I think this room is
probably a lot better and clearer in its explanation of the events at hand,
but that will always help.

   89Dec31 2:02 pm from Sy Borg
One more thing:  The telco left a "We Were Here", "Your Line has been
Repaired" tag on our door the day the repair occurred.  The only thing I
believe i have to get is a confirmation the day the repairs occurred.

   89Dec31 5:11 pm from Colin
(Is there anything you're saying in this that the other side shouldn't know
about?  Is it too far a leap to guess that someone may call here?)

   90Jan01 9:18 am from Gadget Mann
 Ugh. Legal messes. I have to still straighten one out. I was told that it was
all being dropped, then I was told I would get a notice to appear in court in
a month. I figured the whole thing was crap anywise and would be dropped, and
after a few months I began to feel safe and that it was indeed dropped. Then,
three and a half months after the incident, and two and a half months after
the officer that interviewed me promised a court notice, one arrives. What
complete demonCRAP.

   90Jan01 11:31 am from Sy Borg
Colin:  Very doubtful.  I understand your concern.  But the chances of them
knowing all about Images, and telecommunications, and then* trying to press
some sort of charges against me is even more paranoid than I usually am in
such situations.  I don't really have any "enemies" to speak of, and why would
a total stranger press charges when I am so obviously unable to pay huge
amounts of cash with this?

Gadget Mann:  I'd be interested to hear your incident.


   89Jan08 5:07 am from billc
Just got the message on UseNet from Todd Carpenter - thank this guy.  It seems
to me that there must be nothing else going on in the justice system in that
area, for them to pick on you.  Forget the rapists and the murderers, let's go
hang us a crank caller.  Seems that it'll most likely get thrown out of court,
because of the accidental nature of the offense, and that clearly the
prosecuting atone is most likely computer illiterate.  As for the court
costs and attorney fees, that's gonna be a pain.  Who is actually suing you -
the phone company (in the plaintiff behalf) or the police department (also in
the plaintiff's behalf)?

 I don't know Todd, seems like a pretty lame case.. I don't think that it'll
stand up in court.

 Bill
 (hey, if I can get off of illegal use of a government phone line this should
be a piece of cake for you ;-)

   89Jan08 1:22 pm from Sy Borg
Billc:  The prosecuting attorney doesn't* know that there is a computer
involved.  They don't even want to hear this side because they're sure I'm a
sick crank caller -- strange, isn't it?

 I am being cited by the City of Maplewood, Minnesota (probably in the
plaintiffs behalf).  The prosecuting attorney, obviously is the city's
attorney.

 More comments appreciated..

   89Jan08 2:13 pm from Pee Jay
Well you had better make that point clear Sy, if they don't know a PC was
involved, then your as good as gone, to the PlukeHouse..

   89Jan08 3:25 pm from Abominog
When my old system, Revelstone, was suffering from excessive line noise (any
amount is really excessive to me), the phone company sent repairmen out to fix
the problem.  They did their diagnostic checks, found the incriminating noise
but wouldn't do anything about it, as they "do not guarantee data transmission
quality using voice lines".  So, I still have a noise problem.

   89Jan08 3:21 pm from Sy Borg
Not correct at all, Pee Jay.  My lawyer is quite familiar with it.  I believe
that he wishes to use all of this carefully prepared factual statements to
wash away the prosecutions' defense, whatever it may be.

 What was the problem, Abominog?

   89Jan08 3:45 pm from spk
Do you really have a pre-trial on a Sunday?

   89Jan08 4:55 pm from Sy Borg
Hmmmmmm.  Maybe he said the 22nd?  It's that part of the month.

The police told me the phone number.  Since the party to whom the called were
being placed was changed, they didn't deem it a threat.

 BP:  Good advice, that is exactly what I intend to do.

     What's New?  The TSR HIT (Historical Information Tome).   What HIT is, is
a BRAND NEW monthly column about the History of Telecommunications (Data, more
specifically, the modem world of hackers/phreaks, etc.)  Each month, I'll be
presenting you, the TSR reader, a new and exciting titbit of history.  For
we all should know our history -- and be able to manifest our history to
others....no matter what they are.

     And now for HIT, Volume #3:
         _____________________________________________________________

The last decade really has gone by quick.  The hacking scene started out
very quickly in the early 80's (82, 83) and has matured greatly.  Mostly by
crackdowns by police/SS/CIA, etc, and the media-hype, and age.  Ever wonder
what happened to all those online living legends?  Did they become security
experts like they promised?  Or do they just have a secret thirst to KNOW
what is going on within the telecom world -- concealing it from the outside
world.  I do, do you?
