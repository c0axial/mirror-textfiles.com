============================================================================
BOC RESTRICTION DECISION STILL PENDING:

MOST REGIONAL BOCS -- LIMITED ENTRY OF THE REGIONAL BELL OPERATING COMPANIES
(BOCS) INTO INFORMATION SERVICES MAY BE COMING, BUT US DISTRICT JUDGE H. GREENE
PROBABLY WON'T DECIDE UNTIL AFTER LABOR DAY.

IN EARLY JULY, GREENE HEARD ORAL ARGUMENTS FROM ATTORNEYS FOR THE BOCS AS WELL
AS FROM CONSUMER GROUPS, ON-LINE INDUSTRY OFFICIALS, AND THE DEPARTMENT OF
JUSTICE (DOJ), WHICH HAS ADVOCATED FEWER RESTRICTION FRO THE BOCS IN SEVERAL
AREAS.

'THE BOCS WILL GET SOME RIGHTS, BUT AS FAR AS WHAT LEVEL OR WHAT ROLE THEY WILL
PLAY, OR EVEN WHICH SERVICES THEY WILL PROVIDE, NO ONE KNOWS WHICH PEICES
GREENE MAY PARCEL OUT,' SAID COMMUNICATIONS CONSULTANT G. ARLEN.

GREENE IS SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE DOJ'S PROPOSALS, WHICH HINGE ON FCC MONITORING OF
POTENTIAL ABUSES BY THE BOCS, WHICH WOULD CONTINUE TO CONTROL LOCAL PHONE
EXCHANGES, ARLEN SAID.

SO UNCERTAIN IS THE OUTCOME THAT ALL SIDES SEEMS TO BE POSITIONING THEMSELVES
TO LOSE, ARLEN SAID. 'EVERYONE SEEMS TO BE LOOKING TO CONGRESS AS THE NEXT
ARENA.' BUT CONGRESSIONAL ACTION WILL BE SLOW, HE SAID.

SOME FOES OF BROADER BOC FREEDOM ARE BECOMING MORE CONCILIATORY, SAID
D. SIMONS, PRESIDENT OF DIGITAL VIDEO CORP. RECENTLY, THE AMERICAN NEWSPAPER
PUBLISHERS ASSOC. (ANPA) ADOPTED A POSITION PERMITTING BOCS TO PROVIDE A POINT
OF ENTRY FOR INFORMATION SERVICES. BUT THE ANPA OPPOSES LETTING THE BOCS
PROVIDE ELECTRONIC YELLOW PAGES OR DATABASELIKE SERVICES, HE SAID.

HUGO WORLD NEWS 1:

THIS IS FROM SOME SMALL TOWN NEWSPAPER AND I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING. I'LL
ONLY TYPE UP THE INTERESTING ARTICLES SINCE IT IS RATHER LONG.

'HOW TO BEAT PHONE ASSAULT'
- JUNE 25, 1987
[THE FIRST FEW PARAGRAPHS ARE ABOUT THIS GIRL WHO WAS TERRORIZED BY SOME
PERVERT ON THE PHONE]
NEW TECHNOLOGY- THANKS TO IMPROVED TECHNOLOGY, PHONE CALL TRACING, KNOWN TO
POLICE AAS PUTTING A 'TRAP' ON THE LINE [CLID?], IS NOW A FEASIBILE SOLUTION.
FORGET ABOUT OLD MOVIES THAT DEPICT POLICE URGING THE PERSPIRING VICTIM TO
'KEEP HIM TALKING-STAY ON THE LINE!' WHILE THE DILIGENT TELEPHONE ENGINEERS
HURRY THROUGH RACKS OF WIRES TO PINPOINT THE ORIGIN OF THE CALL. IT'S ALL
COMPUTERIZED NOW, AND THE TRAP IS QUICK AND DECISIVE, WITH A SUCCESS RATE, SAYS
ABEL, 'NEAR 100 PERCENT. WITH OUR COMPUTERIZED SWITCHING CENTER [ESS IS WHAT HE
IS TALKING ABOUT], IT'S ALMOST INSTANTANEOUS.' TO OBTAIN A TELEPHONE TRAP, A
CUSTOMER WITH PERSISTENT HARASSING CALLS MUST NOTIFY POLICE. THE POLICE THEN
CONTACT ILLINOIS BELL [THE NEWSPAPER IS FROM ILLINOIS] AND THE TRAP IS
INSTALLED. A TRAP COSTS $20 FOR A WEEK, $7 EACH ADDITIONAL WEEK. IN
LIFE-THREATENIN G SITUTATIONS, THERE IS NO CHARGE. ALTHOUGH ILLINOIS BELL
QUICKLY LOCATES EVERY CALL MADE DURING THE TRAP, LEGALITIES OFTEN CAUSE A TIME
LAG IN PROVIDING THE INFORMATION TO POLICE. POLICE EVENTUALLY RELEASE THE
CALLER'S IDENTITY TO THE VICTIM AND THE CALLER IS ARRESTED. MAXIMUM PENALTY IS
A SIX-MONTH SENTENCE AND A $500 FINE. HOWEVER, AS OF JUNE 1, THE NEW STATE
LEGISLATION REQUIRES A POLICE SUBPOENA TO OBTAIN PHONE TRAP INFORMATION FROM
BELL, A PROCESS LASTING AS LONG AS ONE MONTH.

----------------------------------------

THE DADE COUNTY JAIL IN MIAMI, FLORIDA WAS SLAPPED WITH A PHONE BILL OF
$153,000. IT SEEMS THAT THE INMATES WERE BLUE BOXING, USING AT&T CALLING CARDS,
BILLING TO THIRD PARTIES, CONNING OPERATORS, AND THAT SORT OF STUPH. ONE CALL
ON THANKSGIVING WAS TO COLUMBIA AND LASTED ABOUT 3 HOURS. ANOTHER CALL TO A
DIAL-A-PORN NUMBER LASTED FOR ABOUT 4 HOURS AND COST $220. THE POLICE ARE NOW
INVESTIGATING AND THE COUNTY'S TAXPAYERS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY THE BILL. THE
PAYPHONES AT THE PRISON ARE SUPPOSED TO BE USED FOR LOCAL CALLS ONLY... YEAH
RIGHT! THAT'S IT FOR NOW..

----------------------------------------

THIS FIRST ARTICLE IS THE MOST RECENT AND I THINK IT IS VERY INTERESTING (AND
FUNNY). IT COMES FROM THE ANN LANDERS ADVICE COLUMN (LIKE I READ IT EVERY DAY).
'CHECK THIS: MA BELL IS A GENEROUS SOUL'

DEAR ANN LANDERS: I THINK I CAN TOP THE PERSON WHO WROT COMPLAINING  THE IDIOCY
OF THE PHONE COMPANY. TALK ABOUT GARBAGE IN, GARBAGE OUT! WHEN AT&T SPLIT WITH
BELL WE HAD THREE PHONES IN OUR HOUSE. THE EQUIPMENT BELONGED TO MA BELL AND
THE SERVICE BELONGED TO AT&T. AFTER WE RETURNED ALL THE PHONE EQUIPMENT TO MA
BELL, WE RECEIVED A BILL FOR $0.00. MY HUSBAND AND I TOOK TURNS CALLING PEOPLE
TO GET THIS STRAIGHTENED OUT. SHORTLY AFTER THAT WE WERE INFORMED THAT OUR BILL
FOR $0.00 WAS OVERDUE. MY HUSBAND, JUST TO BE CUTE, SENT A CHECK TO MA BELL FOR
$0.00. A FEW WEEKS LATER, WE RECIEVED A CHECK FOR $5 AND A NOTE THANKING US. WE
DIDN'T CASH THE CHECK THE CHECK, THINKING THIS HAD TO BE A MISTAKE. SEVERAL
MONTHS LATER, WE RECEIVED ANOTHER COMPUTERIZED BILL FOR $0.00. WE CALLED AGAIN,
GOT NOWHERE, SO WE SENT ANOTHER CHECK FOR $0.00. A FEW WEEKS LATER WE RECIEVED
ANOTHER $5 REFUND WITH THE SAME THANK YOU. THIS WENT ON EVERY THREE MONTHS FOR
TWO YEARS. NOW WE ARE DOWN TO ONCE A YEAR AND HAVE GIVEN UP TRYING TO
STRAIGHTEN THIS OUT. WE JUST CASH THE $5 AND FORGET ABOUT IT. THEY SAY THAT
COMPUTERS DON'T MAKE MISTAKES, BUT PEOPLE SURE $O. SOMEONE OUT THERE LIKES US
VERY MUCH, OR THEY ARE VERY STUPID.

--- THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE ---

TUESDAY, JULY SOMETHING (ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO) 'SIGN IN AND THEN SIGN ON' JAMES
DAN SAYS HE HAS A FOOLPROOF WAY TO FOIL COMPUTER HACKERS WHO FERRET OUT SECRET
PASSWORDS [FERRET??? ANYONE HERE FERRET?] AND SPY MECHANICALLY. PUNT THE
PASSWORDS, DAO SAYS. [PUNT= GET RID OF]. USING SOFTWARE DEVELOPED BY DAO'S
COMPANY, COMMUNICATIONS INTELLIGENCE CORP. (CIC) OF MENLO PARK, CALIF.,
COMPUTER USERS MUST SIGN IN IN ORDER TO SIGN ON. CIC'S HANDWRITER PROGRAM
ALLOWS YOU TO SIGN YOUR NAME WITH AN ELECTRONIC PEN ON A FLAT PLASTIC PLATE
UNDERLAID WITH A GRID OF WIRES. THE COMPUTER THEN ANALYZES YOUR SIGNATURE
AGAINST SEVERAL THAT YOU HAVE PREVIOUSLY SUBMITTED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S NOT A
FORGERY BEFORE GIVING YOU ACCESS TO INFORMATIONS. THE HANDWRITING ANALYSIS IS
MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN A SIMPLE COMPARISON OF LETTERS. ACCORDING TO DAO, THE
COMPANY TAKES INTO ACCOUNT HOW QUICKLY YOU WRITE AND HOW YOU ACCELERATE FROM
BEGINNING TO END. IT ALSO EXAMINES THE POINTS AT WHICH YOU APPLY MOST PRESSURE
WITH THE PEN. ALL OF THESE FACTORS ARE UNIQUE TO YOUR SIGNATURE. SIGNATURE
ANALYSIS IS ONLY ONE PART OF THE HANDWRITER PROGRAM. OTHER FEATURES INCLUDE THE
ABILITY TO WRITE LONGHAND MEMOS AND LETERS THAT THE COMPUTER TRANSLATES INTO
PRINTED MATERIAL. RIGHT NOW, THE TECHNOLOGY IS AVAILIABLE ONLY FOR MAINFRAME
AND PERSONAL COMPUTERS, DAO SAYS. BUT ONE DAY, HE PREDICTS, BUSINESSMEN WILL
SIT ON PLANES SCRIBBLING WITH ELECTRONIC PENS ON PLASTIC PLATES ATTACHED TO
LAPTOP COMPUTERS. 'WE'RE OPENING UP COMPUTERS TO A SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION
THAT'S AFRAID OF TYPING,' HE EXPLAINS.

VENDORS UNDERLINE COMMITMENT TO ISDN, PREDICT TARIFF BATTLES:

NAPA, CA --  SEVERAL MAJOR COMPUTER VENDORS, INCLU$ING IBM, DEC, AT&T, AND
HAYES, STRESSED THEIR COMMITMENT TO ISDN AT A RECENT COMMUNICATIONS SEMINAR.
'WE WILL MARKET ISDN PRODUCTS AND ISDN INTERFACES,' SAID LARK ALLEN, MANAGER OF
TELECOMMUNICATIONS MARKET PROGS. AT IBM, SPEAKING AT DATAQUEST'S TELECOM.
INDUSTRY CONFERENCE. 'THROUGH OUR ROLM CBX, WE WILL SUPPORT ISDN AS WELL AS
SYNCHRONOUS AND ASYNCHRONOUS DATA COMMUNICATIONS.'

BUT KETNOTE SPEAKER ELLEN HANCOCK, PRESIDENT OF IBM'S COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS
DIVISION, SAID THAT WHIHE IBM WAS EMBRACING ISDN, THERE WAS SOME CONCERN ABOUT
LINE COSTS.
AN EXECUTIVE FROM HAYES MICROCOMPUTER ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT TARIFFS WILL
BE COMPLICATED. 'IF TARIFFS FOR ISDN ARE SET INCORRECTLY, THE RAMP-UP FOR
WIDESPREAD ACCEPTANCE OF ISDN SERVICES WILL BE LONG AND PAINFUL,' SAID GARY
BETTY, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF HAYES MICROCOMPUTER PRODUCTS INC.

BETTY ALSO PREDICTED THAT THERE WILL BE A TARIFF BATTLE IN EVERY STATE WITH THE
ARRIVAL OF ISDN, CONSEQUENTLY, THE INDUSTRY MAY BE SLOW IN ADOPTING AN ISDN
STANDARD, HE SAID.
AT AT&T REPRESENTATIVE, HOWEVER, HINTED THAT LINE COSTS WOULD BE COMPETITIVE,
ALTHOUGH HE WOULD NOT GIVE DETAILS. R. SNOWDEN, DIRECTOR OF AT&T'S CONCEPT
DEVELOPMENT CENTER, SAID AT&T WOULD BE FILING TARIFFS FOR ISDN SERVICE BEFORE
THE END OF THE YEAR.

F.BALFOUR, DEC PRODUCT MARKETING MANAGER, SAID THAT DEC ALSO SUPPORTS ISDN, BUT
DOES NOT YET SUPPORT IT TO THE DESKTOP.
IN SHORT TERM, ISDN7S EFFECT MAY BE TO LENGTHEN THE LIFE OF CENTREX,
CENTRALIZED TELEPHONE FUNCTIONS OFFERED BY BELL OP. COMPANIES, PREDICTED VIC
KRUEGER, DATAQUEST'S VP FOR TELECOM INDUSTRY SERVICE. THIS IS BECAUSE ISDN WILL
SEND SEVERAL FUNCTIONS WHICH ARE NOW BEING PERFORMED BY PBX SYSTEMS BACK TO THE
MAIN PHONE COMPANY OFFICE, ACCORDING TO KRUEGER.

PROPOSED FCC ACCESS FEE DRAWS MORE CRITICISM:

WASHINGTON -- WITH THE JULY 17 OFFICIAL FCC PUBLICATION OF ITS PLAN FOR
ENHANCED SERVICE ACCESS CHARGES, WHICH COULD ADD UP TO 5$ PER HOUR TO USER ON-
LINE CONNECT FEES, PROVIDERS OF INFORMATION SERVICES STEPPED UP THEIR
CRITICISM.

AS OF LAST WEEK, THE FCC HAD RECEIVED MORE THAN 100 LETTERS, ALL OF THEM
AGAINST THE PROPOSAL. 'OUT ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE IS TO ESTABLISH A SET OF RULES
THAT PROVIDE FOR RECOVERY OF THE COSTS OF EXCHANGE ACCESS USED IN INTERSTATE
SERVICE IN A FAIR, REASONABLE, AND EFFICIENT MANNER FROM ALL USERS OF ACCESS
SERVICES,' READ PART OF THE PROPOSAL, CC DOCKET 87-215. 'TO THE EXTEMPT FROM
ACCESS CHARGES, THE OTHER USERS OF EXCHANGE ACCESS PAY A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE
OF THE COSTS OF THE LOCAL EXCHANGE THAT ACCESS CHARGES ARE DISIGNED TO COVER.'

'THERE IS NO BASIS FOR SINGLING OUT ONE CLASS OF USERS AND SUBJECTING THEM TO
COMMON CARRIER-TYPE ACCESS CHARGES SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY ARE ENGAGED IN THE
PROVISION OF COMPUTER SERVICES,' SAID G. T. DEBAKEY, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF
ADAPSO, THE COMPUTER SOFTWARE AND SERVICES INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION, BASED IN
ARLIGNTON, VIRGINIA.

DEBAKEY SAID THE NEW FEES WOULD PUT PRICES OF CONSUMER-ORIENTED INFORMATION
SERVICES BEYOND THE REACH OF MOST USERS.
THE FCC PROPOSAL WOULD 'CAUSE A DRASTIC CURTAILMENT IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND
AVAILABILITY OF COMMERCIAL NETWORK-BASED INFORMATION SERVICES OF ALL KINDS,'
SAID ANTHONY L. CRAIG, PRESIDENT OF GE INFO. SERVICES DIVISION, BASED IN
ROCKVILLE, MARYLAND.

SILENT ASSAULT (612 PHREAK) BUSTED:

MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA. TSR -- SILENT ASSAULT, A LOCAL 612 PHREAK, WAS
APPREHENDED FOR VARIOUS ILLEGAL ITEMS @STATED LATER) ON JANUARY 2ND. HE WAS
AWOKEN BY ONE OF HIS PARENTS APPROXIMATELY MIDNIGHT. HE ASKED WHAT WAS WRONG
AND HE WAS TOLD THAT THE SECRET SERVICE WAS HERE TO TALK TO HIM. HE THEN WENT
TO THEM AND THEY SHOWED SA ALL THEIR IDS. THERE WAS 3 SS MEN. THREE GUYS AND
ONE LADY, AND THEY ASKED HIM IF HE WAS SILENT ASSAULT. SA TRIED TO ACT DUMB AND
SAID HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT. SA SAID NO, AND ON OF THE SS
MEN ASKED HIM IF THIS WAS HIS VOICE. HE CONTINUED TO PLAY BACK PREVIOUS
RECORDINGS THAT THEY HAD MONITORED ON SA'S INFO VMS LINE. ABOUT THE INFO LINE:
SA HAD A LOCAL VMS SET UP THAT HE CARDED. HE USED IT TO REPORT ILLEGAL
INFORMATION SUCH AS CCARDS, ACC CODES, HACKED COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND OTHER MISC.
PWS. THEY WERE MONITORING HIS LINE PROBABLY RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE HE HAD CARDED
THE VMS INSTEAD OF JUST HACKING THE PW. ANYWAYS, AFTER THE SS MEN PLAYED HIS
VOICE, HE SAID HE DIDN'T THINK IT WAS HIS VOICE. THEN THEY WENT DOWN AND LOOKED
AT SA'S SYSTEM, SINCE HE HAD TO CHOICE, HIS PARENTS ALREADY GAVE THEM
PERMISSION. SA HAD EVERYTHING (PRINTOUTS, DISKS, ETC.) SITTING OUT DOWNSTAIRS
SINCE HE DIDN'T KNOW THEY WERE COMING FOR A VISIT. ONE OF THE SS MEN SAID THEY
KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON, THEY HAD EVIDENCE AND THEY WERE GOING TO SEIZE
EVERYTHING. THEY THEN TOLD HIM TO ADMIT HE'S SA AND IT WOULD GO EASIER ON HIM
AND THEY'D HELP HIM. HE THEN SAID, YES I AM SILENT ASSAULT. SA COULDN'T DO
ANYTHING ABOUT IT SINCE THEY HAD HIS VOICE ON TAPE, AND THEY HAD WAY OF
COMPARING VOICES.

THEY CAME BACK THE NEXT DAY, TOOK EVERYTHING HE HAD AND HAULED IT BACK TO THE
SS DEPT. SA HAD TO GO WITH THEM AND GO THROUGH DISK BY DISK. SOME OF THE THINGS
THE SS MEN HADN'T FOUND HE SAVED AND LOCKED UP. THE DAY BEFORE SA HAD JUST GONE
TRASHING THE DAY BEFORE AND HAD ABOUT 200 CC CARBONS, ALTHOUGH THEY DIDN'T FIND
THESE AND HE GOT RID OF THEM. TO CONTINUE, THE SS MEN WENT THROUGH THE
PRINTOUTS AND HAD SEEN PREVIOUS POSTS HE HAD MADE WITH CCARDS AND LD ACC CODES
AND OTHER ILLEGAL ITEMS. THEY COULDN'T REALLY GET SA ON ANY OF THOSE. SA HAD TO
GO DOWN TO THE SS DEPT A COUPLE OF TIMES, AND THEY WERE HASSLING HIM AND ASKING
HIM WHO VARIOUS PHREAKS WERE, LIKE THE DRAGON AND CERTAIN OTHER PEOPLE SA
DIDN'T CARE TO MENTION.

THE SS MEN HAD SA'S ACCOUNTS/PWS TO BBS'S AND LOGGED INTO VARIOUS SYSTEMS UNDER
HIS NAME AND POSTED WARNINGS ABOUT 'THE USE OF UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS CODES IS
ILLEGAL AND YOU COULD BE...ETC.' SA HAD TALKED WITH VARIOUS SYSTEM OPERATORS,
SUCH AS SCAN MAN FROM P80 AND SCAN MAN SAID HE HAD GOTTEN VARIOUS THREATS. SA
ASSUMED IT WAS THE SS MEN HE HAD RAN IN WITH. SA HADN'T GOTTEN IN CONTACT WITH
A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THIS BECAUSE HE WAS COMMUNICATING WITH THEM THROUGH
DIFFERENT VMS'S. AND THE 408 BOX SA HAD SET UP FOR MORE ILLEGAL INFORMATION TO
BE PASSED, SS MEN COULDN'T GET HIM ON THAT SINCE HE HAD HACKED THAT PW OUT.
THEY DIDN'T GET SA FOR CREDIT CARD FRAUD. AFTER THAT HAD GONE THROUGH SA'S
VOICE TAPES THAT THE ACC CODES AND CC NUMBERS HAD BEEN POSTED, THEY WENT
THROUGH SPRINT, VISA, MCI AND OTHER COMPANIES AND TOTAL DAMAGES LOST WAS
BETWEEN 11,000$ AND 12,000$. SO THAT WAS ENOUGH FOR THEM TO PUT A FEDERAL
CHARGE ON SA ON 'TRAFFICING AND UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS DEVICES'. SA WENT TO COURT
FOR THAT, AND AUGUST 3RD HE WENT INTO COURT AGAIN AND THEY ORIGINALLY WANTED
HIM FOR 3 YRS., BUT GOT THE SENTENCE DOWN TO 6 MONTHS BEHIND BARS AND 3 YEARS
PROBATION. SA TAKES OFF AUGUST 24TH FOR JAIL FOR 6 MONTHS AND PROBABLY WON'T BE
BACK UNTIL NEXT FEBRUARY SOMETIME.

SA DID GET HIS COMPUTER SYSTEM BACK, AND IS NOW ACTIVE UNTIL HE HAS TO SERVE
HIS 6 MONTH MAX. SENTENCE. HE DID LOST ABOUT 10 FT. ON PRINTOUTS, OVER HALF HIS
DISKS OF HACKING PROGRAMS AND GENERAL HACK/PHREAK FILES. SA STATED TO ME IT WAS
A CROCK OF SHIT AND ALL OF THIS WENT ON FOR ABOUT 3 MONTHS.
