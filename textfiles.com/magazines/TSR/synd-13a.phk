Exposition:

       The lastest transmittal of the Syndicate Report can now be
   found on 612-829-8509.  When you call the number...have your modem
   set at 300 baud, and ANSWER.  If this doesn't work...reset your modem
   to ORIGINATE just as you would call a regular BBS.  And if there are any
   second parts to TSR's...they will be found on 612-829-8508.  Remember...
   only 300 baud.

  ============================================================================

Author's Note:

       Welcome to Part 2 of The Syndicate Report Issue #13.  I've added this
  extra transmittal due to the extra amount of news going around.  This issue
  was dedicated directly to my experience with MCI and Mpls Interstate Cops.

       Also, there will be an upcoming feature about Silent Assault, a local
  612 Phreak, most likely in TSR #14.  It will feature how SA's bust.

       Don't Be Careless Out There!

       "This is might be the last article I will write, I'm still waiting to
here from the Secret Service."

       It was 1:11 pm - July 8, 1987.  I had woken up around 11:00 pm from a
busy night of scanning Bell's Test Access System in California (415 UNIX).
That night I had gotten into the system.  Nodename was 'tuuv7'.  I only had a
chance to check my privs. on the Unix when I was logged out.  I just sat there
staring at the 'CONNECTION LOST...' note on my screen wondering what I actually
did wrong.  I tried to ring the System back to continue, but all I received was
a solid ringing.  I thought that I must have tripped an alarm.  I then decided
to turn in for the night, and give a wack at it in the morning.


       As I said before, I woke up at 11:00.  I booted up the terminal program,
and attempted to log back into the Bell Unix.  It gave me a carrier, but this
time I didn't have to enter in the 'Password:', just the 'Function:'.
And all I got this time was '>UNIX=tuu7',  And nothing else. I just hung up,
and would bring up the question on Osuny BBS.

       I attempted to dial Osuny Bbs, only to find I had an invalid code on
my hands.  Not willing to pay for an LD call, I picked out another one.  Then
before I could dial the local Acc Number, I heard a loud knocking at my back
door.  I wondered who the hell knocks as loud as that, and went to answer it.
As I just walked out of my room, I seen what it looked like as a local cop
searching for someone/something around my house.  I didn't waste another
second, and instantly ran back to my room and stashed all the illegal items I
could into a private place.  I caught my breath, and by this time they had
stopped knocking.  I thought they had gone away, but instead I found them just
sitting in their unmarked car.  I thought this was strange, since cops usually
come in regular cops cars to haul you away for a parking ticket.  Well, I
didn't feel like letting them sit out there all day, so I walked out and ask if
I could help them.  They got out of the car quicker than thought possible and
asked me questions..."What's your full name, How old are you, Do you have
a computer...YES?  Do you have a modem?  etc...After the 101 questions about
my life, they wanted to see my set-up because they got a call from MCI and Bell
about codes and hacking into their computers.  They said they had a trace on
my line for about 3 days, and knew ever where I called.  I brang them to my
room easily knowing all the illegal items had been stashed.  The first of the
two Capital Police of Minneapolis (That's what their badges said), came first
to my room, and the second didn't follow right away.  The first cop was a
moron. He looked over my set up, and asked what everthing was.  I quess the
second cop knew all about computers.  The second cop picked up all my notes and
started reading them.  He first looked at Phrack World News XIV/2, then my
13th Transmittal of The Syndicate Report, then a list of local systems I had
scanned out the night before.  He asked what I was looking for with all these
numbers.  I just said I was looking for HLI DDS Systems, knowing he knew
nothing about HLI's.  All the documents looked over were:  Various Phrack
files, Syndicate Reports, a few TAP/2600 Mags., countless UNIX files and
discussions (Posts with Users Names, Systems Names, Dates etc.), and an
interview file I had for the Informant - Dan the Operator.  He took all of
these and 4 books of notes I had.

       I then looked at my screen, and forgotten I had a hacker loaded up,
but I only had a listing of it.  He asked me what it was, I said a word
processor.  He then asked my what my private phone numbers are.  I told him my
parents number, and the actual one I used for scanning.  But I told him a fake
number for my third line, knowing that it just rings and rings if you call it.
The second cop looked over my modem and told me he would have to take it
downtown for a while.  I asked him when/if I would get it back, he said soon.
I wasn't worried to much, I had two more modems put away.  He then paged
through my disks, taking all the general files, and a few utility disks etc.
He asked me about MCI's access codes I used.  I told him I just tried it a
couple of times, and gave up.  He didn't beleive me and asked if I gave out
the following codes to anyone, and he listed a bunch.  Of course the only word
that came from me was 'NO'.

       They then informed me that fraudulent use of Codes and Hacking are
illegal, and could bring Federal charges since calls where made all over
hell.  He also said the Secret Service will get in touch with me. And that
was it.

       I have yet to wait for the Secret Service to call, or come over.  I
have really nothing to say about phreak/hacking, and no regrets as of yet.
I knew the chances wadged against me, but since I'm still a minor I continued.

       The last issue of The Syndicate Report is Transmittal #13.  I've put out
TSR for well over a year, and had no intention of quitting.  But these
circumstances force me to stop, atleast for now.  The Syndicate Report will
continue to be published monthly.

At this time I would like to thank the following people/boards:

Captian's Log      -    Where I first learn the very basics of phreaking.
                        I don't quite remember the person's name that
                        explained phreaking, but I thank him.
2001 BBS           -    Bootleg's old system in the 503.  A lot of great
                        discussions came out of that system.
Private Sector BBS -    2600 Magazine, Kid & Co.
Police Station     -    Hours of hacking into this once great system.
I.P.D              -    International Phreaks/Pirates Division - First group
                        I was a member to.
Phrack Inc.        -    For PWN, Support and idea for The Syndicate Report
MCI                -    For years of loyal service
