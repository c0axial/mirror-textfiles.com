     As you may know by now, this transmittal is a few days late.  I've been
pretty good on getting out TSRs on specified dates.  Ever since I started TSR,
back in '85, I've been late only 3 times.   1 time lasted around 6 months, but
that was really my temporary retirement.  I also thought I'd be too busy with
college.

     That's why I'm late this month.  School, work, night school also, and
women.  I pay too much attention on the later.  Am I jabbering?

     This month's editorial is dedicated to copyright issues.  I'm not going to
ramble on and on about copyrights - but instead I've completed/gathered a
discussion about it.  It all started on a TC Citadel System.  It was
interesting, and you may find it interesting also.  I've put it on
TSR #22 part 2, so skipped to it now if you like.  Otherwise, I'll keep you in
suspence with some TSR news.

     Comments about copyright issues, dial Radio Waves.

PHONE SYSTEMS AS VULNERABLE AS COMPUTER NETWORKS:             TSR (gz.m 3\18)

     U.S. businesses and telecommunications companies should be as
concerned with the security of their phone systems as they are with their
computer networks, according Telecom Industry Consulting (TIC).

     Speaking at "Telestrategies '89" Feb. 23, TIC said security risks are
rising because of advances in open telecommunications networks, as well as the
changing profile of those who penetrate the systems.

     Today's telephone networks are designed for efficiency and ease-of-use,
first, then security.  As we move toward a more intelligent network
(SS#7 and ISDN) and fiber optics, our phone systems will be easier to access
and disturb -- by a larger number of people.  The question then becomes,
what security measures are users willing to pay for and what restrictions will
they accept?

     This question is made tougher by the changing profile of those who
penetrate the systems.

     "Today's adversaries are largely hackers interested in testing their
skills," TIC said.  "However, we see breaches of security becoming more
criminal in nature as the network becomes more 'open' and technical
sophistication of users is more wide spread."

     TIC cited cases that demonstrated the spectrum of adversaries.  TIC said a
17-year-old hacker once accessed a company's WATS network and used it to call
computers across the United States.  And, on the criminal end of the spectrum,
a large retail and catalogue store had its phones forwarded to a group that
wanted customers' CREDIT CARD INFORMATION.

     TIC noted that earlier this month a group of scientific advisers appeared
before the Senate Government Affairs Committee to warn of possible terrorist
actions on U.S. telecommunications networks.

     "It's important that providers and users focus on these issues now and
work together to put information security plans in place," said TIC.

     "Recent events, like the `worm' in the national computer network and,
although accidental, the fire at Illinois Bell, provided us with a valuable
lesson," concluded TIC.  "And, an opportunity to act now and pre-empt
future problems."

TELENET STATUS INFORMATION:                                       TSR (bb 4\7)
 
     When first connect to your local (or 800) PAD (Protocol Assembly
Dissassembly; converts your modem-talk to the X.25 protocol, a CCITT standard)
you'll see this:

TELENET
NPA NNA

NPA is your Number Planning Area (area code in layman's terms) and NNA breaks
down as follows:

NPA NNA

NPA is your Number Planning Area (area code in layman's terms) and NNA breaks
down as follows:

     NN = Your PAD's Port Address
     A  = Your PAD's Sub-Address

Example:

TELENET
612 15D

     Now, see the "612"?  That's your PAD's DTE (Data Terminal Equipment).  A
DTE is like a serial number in a way.  It identifies the communications gear
you are using (this particular PAD in this case).  It is VERY difficult to
modify your DTE (possible by EXCEEDINGLY difficult and not worth your time, as
it will take lots of money for X.25 boards, and such).  TELENET knows your DTE.
All the NUA's (Network User Addresses) that you call also know your DTE address
(providing they have that feature built into their X.25 software, and most do).

     Here's information about the DISCONNECT message seen on Telenet.  These
are displayed after connecting and disconnection from services online Telenet,
including PC Pursuit.

information you transfer - also time.

CUSTOMER NAME AND ADDRESS/LISTING (CNA/L) PROGRAM:              TSR (p.f 4\8)

     Ever get tired of looking up out-dated CNA listing in text files?
Professor Falken, of California 408, Minnesota 612, has devised a program to
quickly list CNA numbers.  It's a handy tool, and he updates it each time new
information comes in.  The latest version has some hard to get information, and
can be found on Radio Waves BBS at (612) 471-0060.  Currently, only IBM version
1.1 is available.  Falken noted to TSR that an Apple version of the CNA lister
will be released by Twisted Sector, who is also from the 408 area.

     If you have questions, or wish to pick up the latest version, dial in on
Radio Waves BBS.  The Author will be taking suggestions, and questions.

     Here's some updates from the latest version of the CNA lister:

April 1st, 1989

     I got bored today with Telenet/Tymnet, so, I decided to read some old 2600
magazines.  I found an old CNA list, and with the help of a few TSPS operators
and a dumb-bitch DA operator I got a couple of UNPUBLISHED CNA's.

I've added them to the program, they include:

205: Alabama all locations
618: Alton, Illinois and surrounding areas
913: Topeka, Kansas and surrounding areas
516: Hempstead, New York and local surrounding areas
315: Syracuse/Utica, New York and local surrounding areas
919: Williamston/Winston-Salem, North Carolina and surrounding areas
803: South Carolina all locations
915: El Paso, Texas and surrounding areas

     I am still missing CNA's for area codes: 818,409,714,719,808,507,609,201.

These CNA's are quite mysterious as of now, the old CNA's for these were:

818:213-501-3255
409:713-820-4112
714:213-501-3255
808:212-334-4336
507:402-345-0600
609:201-676-7070
201:201-676-7070

     I cannot even find 719's CNA dial up new or old. If anyone has any of
these area code's NEW CNA dialups please contact me at the below address.  Any
new CNA's will be added to the program and the version number will be changed,
and a new release will emerge.  The current version of Automated CNA is 1.1

Any suggestions/comments leave on Radio Waves BBS [612] 471-0060

CELLULAR FONES ON DIGITAL LINES:                                 TSR (fbs 4\8)

     How will the coming of digital lines improve cellular reception?  By
facilitating error detection and error-correcting mechanisms.  Unlike analog
signals, digital signals are easy to distinguish from background noise and can
be reconstructed.
     The big telecom. manufacturers, including AT&T, Motorola, Northern
Telecom, and Ericsson, expect to sell digital car phones.  Before they can,
they must agree on industry standards.  So far, they have taken a big step in
this direction by selecting "time division multiple access" as a way to squeeze
signals from several phones into one cell over one frequency.  This is a time-
sharing scheme that takes advantage of the fact that one channel can deliver
about 48,000 bits of data per second while each phone conversation can be
accurately rendered with only some 16,000 bits per second.
     High-powered digital communication chips, of the sort that would have been
prohibitively expensive a decade ago, are necessary to this operation.  They
have to freeze-frame a voice several thousand times a second, possibly encrypt
the resulting data to foil in bursts, and undo all this at the other end to
reconstruct the sounds.  Details are yet to be worked out.
       Does all this mean you shouldn't buy an analog cellular phone today?
No. the switchover to digital cellular will take place gradually and will
operate in tandem with the existing analog system.  After that, you may be able
to switch to digital by retrofitting.  That convenience will come at a great
capital cost to the cellular operators, who find themselves in the awkward
position of having to replace most of their five-year-old transmission gear
simply to stay in business.

       Someday the phone system will put a million bits a second of capacity on
every desk.  You could never generate that kind of capacity on a radio-based
system.  So the Bill companies aren't going out of business, and much of the
cellular traffic growth will go to markets out of reach of wired systems and
not currently will served.  So, don't rush to sell your Bell stocks, but
rejoice that things are looking up for cellular operators and rush-hour
commuters on the Santa Monica freeway.

// VMX D.I.A.L.-S System //

     D.I.A.L.-S (Direct Access Link), a new system for call processing
and voice messaging applications in small to medium-sized organizations, from
25 to 200 people, is now available from VMX, Inc.
     The D.I.A.L.-S system offers two- to eight-port capacity, expandable in
two-or four-port increments, providing cost-effective modular growth.
D.I.A.L.-S was initially offered under an introductory program during the last
half of calendar 1988.

     D.I.A.L.-S, like the standard D.I.A.L. system, provides a wide range of
standard and optional capabilities for automated attendant, telephone
answering, voice mail, audiotext, call routing, and other applications for
organizations from as few as 25 up to several hundred employees.
     VMX merged with OPCOM in July 1988, combining two of the participants in
the voice messaging/call processing marketplace.  The new VMX is focused on
providing Strategic Voice Communications solutions vital in today's business
environment and has sold over 2,500 systems.

// ATM Body Language //           (Advancement from TSR #21-2 ATM Bust)

     Banks are looking for a technological fix, shoved by the recent ATM busts.
Identix Inc., in Sunnyvale, Calif., has developed a device that can identify a
machine user's fingerprint in less that two seconds.  Ecco Industries Inc., in
Danvers, Mass., is developing a voice-identification system.  But few banks are
willing to shoulder the cost of replacing their ATM hardware, as would be
required, and ATM makers aren't eager to change their designs, Identix says.

     Some bankers figure that HACKERS will eventually break any code they
confront.  What's really needed are "line managers to keep an eye on things,"
says a security consultant with SRI International, Calif.  But if ATMs end up
requiring too much human surveillance, some banks may regret ever switching
from live tellers.

// Bell Labs Computer Solves Unsolvable //

       The Military Airlift Command has a humdinger of a traveling salesman
problem on its hands:  MAC flies roughly 1,000 planes in and out of 329
airports around the world.  So what the most efficient schedule for keeping
those planes in the air as much as possible without skimping on service to any
of those airports?  Answering a question with even a small fraction of those
variables would bring a mainframe computer to its knees -- there are too many
possible solutions to evaluate.
       Now the Air Force may have found a solution in a new computer system,
called Korbx, built by AT&T BELL LABORATORIES.  It is based on the work of
Narendra Karmarkar, a Bell Labs mathematician who, in '84, devised a way of
"getting inside" problems to spot shortcut solutions.  The first commercial
Korbx system has just been installed at MAC headquarters on Scott Air Force
Base in Illinois.  Fed a problem with 321,000 variables plus 14,000 time
constraints, the computer chewed away for only an hour before spitting out a
solution.  "We're now in hog heaven, says MAC.  Hackers beware!
