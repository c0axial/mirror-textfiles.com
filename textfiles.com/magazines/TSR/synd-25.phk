                     The Syndicate Report Clears Month #25!

       Well, since TSR #1 was first published back in May, 1986 -- there have
been a whopping 25 issues.  There would have been many more, but The Editor
took a few months off due too:  The '87 Crackdowns (Mine was one of the first),
Modem Data Burnout (You have to get away from it once in a while), and the
summer came about.  What keeps TSR coming out to you, the hacks/phreaks/users
of the world, is your continued support.  Each time I receive a good word, or
find users helping out by contributing files, it energizing me.
       Another year of college will be on the way by tyme this file is
released, so expect future TSRs to be late -- as last year's record show.  I'm
not going to try to get TSRs out by the desired 1 month limit, but I'll surely
keep by that general time frame.

       With this transmittal, I'm releasing a file on the new Interactive
Personal Computer System called, Prodigy.  I've had a chance to get online
the system FREE of charge of course, and I'm going to evaluate it -- and make
some helpful hack suggestions.  Expect it released at the end up Sept.

  ...enjoy!

TIME, NOTWITHSTANDING, THE LINE NOISE COLLUSION:                 (all TSR 9\6)

     The age old problem of "Line Noise" still haunts many telecommunication
users -- causing many levels of stress.  Here and now, I will try to point out
some common problems that can cause line noise.  Many of these you've heard
before, many you may have not.  Basically this is a summary of solves:

     During the early days of my telecom/modem experiences, many phreaks and
hacks alike that experienced LN (Line Noise), immediately blamed the local or
LD (Long Distance) Fone companies.  Those guys are great scapegoats for many
reasons.  The most obvious is the outrageous prices they drop upon the users.
Let's face it, the LD services make a bundle off users dialing LD -- and work
what? the cost of electricity (which is very cheap in Minnesota, 612).
     Anyway, call up your TSPS Operator (0), and tell her to send you to
someone that can fix your fone, your getting a lot of static -- say.

     The Bell system can still be the blame:  A signal is routed through
multiple stations before it eventually makes it to the other end and some of
these stations aren't exactly up-to-date standard ESS or above.  Older areas
may have older, less sophisticated equipment that is more apt to be affected by
ambient noise.  This is one reason some people continue to have noise problems
even after hanging up and calling back multiple times.  Also, a given physical
connection at one of these junctions may not be up to snuff.  If your
particular bundle of line noise is solved by hanging up and calling back, then
it's probable that you were previously connected through an intermittent or
'dirty' connection.  Some of these trunk lines (large, multi-caller 'pipes')
may pass through an area that has a lot of ambient RFI (Radio Frequency
Interference) present although this is not usually the case.
     Also, if you have a cordless fone, some other person may be connecting to
you and your cordless fone.  I've had this happen before, just after calling
Bell and figuring it out myself.  It doesn't pay to buy a cheap cordless.  Also
those car fones can emit those nasty waves -- check your neighbors.  Steal
all fones for best results.

     What else then, if not the fone company?  Your home.  Most homes have
televisions, radios, microwave ovens, VCR's, and if you are reading this, a
micro-computer.  All these devices radiate radio waves that can (and often do)
get into the phone lines and cause noise.  Electric motors and mechanical
dimmer controls can introduce noise into the electrical wiring in your house
and cause problems.  If your line noise problem does not go away after repeated
hanging up and calling back, then you may be suffering from one of these
household problems.  If you are suffering from this problem, you can take steps
to eliminate it.  First of all, turn off EVERYTHING, and see if the noise
persists.  If it goes away, then start turning things back on, checking the
computer each time until you see the noise start up again.  It may be that a
single device is not bugging you but several devices plotting together to annoy
you.  This elimination tournament may take awhile.

     What else?  Check your wiring.  If your system looks at all like mine
(with other computer surrounding), you have a mess of wiring interweaving.  You
know what it's like, just look back there to see for yourself.  It almost
immediately reminds me of fishing wire tangled to infinity.  You have to unwind
it all, or you can't go fishing.
     If nothing, try using noise supressors on your power connections to both
the PC and the modem (if external).  Ribbon cables (especially long runs of it)
are great antennas and will cause problems.  Re-route the RS-232 cable so it
does not run next to the PC power supply or any other transformer.  Many
'clone' monitors do not have internal metal shielding and can radiate lots of
noise (Ever notice an occasional high pitched whining ring? That's it...).
Make sure the cable does not run near the monitor.  If you are particularly
adventuresome, you can line the interior of the monitor with foil and ground it
with a ribbon grounding strap.
     If you're lucky enough to live next to an annoying freeway/highway, then
interference from CB radio can present a problem.  Many of those beer belly,
coke snorting, no money bum truckers have 100+ watts of power (illegally) on
their CB rigs and frequently have sloppy amplifiers that can emit spurious
radiation all over the radio spectrum.  (See box plans:  Blotto Box, if
confused.)

Check software, change baud speeds, could be your brand of modem (cheap?),
could be the BBS software (another computer type than yours?  commie story),

     The modem!  Many say that the high the speed transferring your
information, the more prone you are to LN.  Not true.  Personally, and say
others, back when I switched from 300 to 1200, the LN disappeared completely.
Same happened with me.  So, check speeds to see if that does the trick.  The
most common transfer rate is 2400 BPS -- which is very reliable, but to some, a
hellish nightmare.  Try dropping a bps level.  If this helps, it's your modem
(it really pays to shoppe at KMart).  The brand of your modem is also very
critical.  Shoppe around for a very reliable modem brand name.  I have a
Packard Bell 2400 Plus -- and it works excellent. Also try:  Robotics, Everex,
Courier, Multitech, and of course Hayes (over priced).  But I always hold to
the phobia that anything expensive is going to be worth it -- besides Radio
Shack computer equipment.

     Hardware Kantankering:  This'll help out the line noise problems by way of
hardware adjustments:

     The Bell Linemun are usually stupid when it comes to static.  After all,
it can come from ANYWHERE!  Bell people will usually charge you also for a
visit, but only if they find something wrong with your equipment.
     Throw this thing together in about 10 minutes.  And take another five to
adjust the stuff for best results on your worst connection.

Quick Pointers:

1) The pot need not be either 5K or audio taper. I used a 10K 15 turn trim pot.
   Suggest you use what is handy.
2) I used 2MFD's of capacitance (two 1MFD's in parallel) Two R.S. p/n 272-1055
   work fine. Remember that about 90 Volts will appear across red & green at
   ring, so the caps should be rated at 100VDC+.
3) I ended up with a final series resistance value (100 ohm + pot) of 2.75K.
   I speculate that one could probably use 2MFD and a fixed 2.7K resistor and
   do the job 90% of the time. The adjustment of the pot is not very critical.
   Changes of +/- 1K made little difference in the performance of the circuit.

         _____________________________________________________________

      For more help on LN (Line Noise), read Mike McCauley's:  Modem Noise
Killer (alpha version).
      Also, try a static box.  In theory, it keeps the voltage on you line
stable to reduce garbage/static.  Schematics may be found around the BBS
community.

CCCP EXPERIENCES "COMPUTER CRIME":                             TSR (log.d 8\1)

   ... In Moscow, the first All-Union Conference on Social and Legal Issues
of Information  Science has begun. It is being conducted by the USSR State
Committee  for  Computers and Information Science (SCCIS), the USSR Academy
of  Sciences,  the USSR State Committee on Public Education, and the USSR
Ministry  of Justice. When I began discussing this with I. Z. Karas, one of
the  conference organizers  and  chairman  of  the  SCCIS  Scientific  and
Technical  Council's section on computer-science norms and laws, I didn't
realize that we were speaking of "computer crime."

   "Legally,  it  would  seem  that there is no such thing in our country,"
said Ilya Zinovyevich,  "but  in  fact,  it does exist and is growing. We
cannot close our eyes to this fact."

   I. Karas  is  the Chairman of the Board of the Informatika <Information
Science> Union of Cooperatives, which was created in November, and one of
whose  goals is  to assist domestic programming. Ilya Zinovyevich spoke of
something he knows well, something that requires urgent action. Let me clarify.

   "You are obviously referring to the recently publicized incidents of the
dangerous  computer disease having to do with 'computer viruses,' right?" I
asked.

   "That is an extremely serious  matter,  but  it  is only part of the
'computer-crime' problem. By the way, in terms of its consequences, I would
say  that  what  happened at one  Soviet enterprise, when an unscrupulous
programmer  input  an  'infected' program into a computer and disrupted
control  of  a production process, is comparable to an act of sabotage. But
while people stand trial for intentional sabotage of equipment, in cases of
this  kind our laws have proven practically helpless. The programmer got a
suspended sentence, which, in my opinion, is laughable compared to the
damage  done. In the US, by contrast, such actions are punishable by a fine
of up to $10,000 or a jail term of up to 10 years. ...

   "In the USSR today, the information-science situation is this: Total
anarchy  rules, there is no copyright, and, for all intents and purposes,
there is no recognition of property rights where programs are concerned.
They are universally pirated, but for some reason we see nothing wrong in
that.  If  a  disk worth  500  rubles, with a program worth 100,000 rubles
written on it, is stolen, the thief will be tried only for the theft of the
disk  itself.  The following harmful  practice also exists: On leaving an
enterprise, a specialist often destroys a program that he has written and
then  proceeds to sell it to another organization. This is a clear case of
unearned  income. If, for example, only the program is lifted, has there
been  no  crime?  That's  wrong!  With the development of cheap duplicating
equipment,  the problem has taken on special urgency. One and the same
program  gets repeatedly  sold  and resold as a new one that has just been
developed.  We need a psychological breakthrough where computer information
is concerned.  And as long as we do not officially recognize rights to it in
the same sense that we recognize rights to tangible products, we will not
be able to deal normally in it, and computerization in the country will be
impeded. ...

   "In my view, the USSR presently needs at least 10,000 lawyers in the
field  of  computer  law.  As  yet,  there  are  very few such specialists.
Computer forensics is also needed." ...

MORE MORRIS JR. MOORINGS:                                      TSR (log.d 8\1)

     The Justice Department is expected to announce that it will file felony
charges against Robert T. Morris Jr, who allegedly concocted the computer
worm that penetrated and shut down some 6,200 computers on the Internet
network in Nov 1988. Morris will likely be charged under provisions of the
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986, which makes it a felony to 'access a
federal-interest computer without authorization,' or to 'prevent authorized
use of any such computer information.' The virus cost nearly $100 million
in lost computer time and manpower that was used to purge the worm and
restore the network's functionality.

     Robert T. Morris Jr. is being indicted the week of Jul 20, 1989 in US
federal court in Syracuse, NY, with violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse
Act of 1986. Morris is the alleged author of the computer virus, or worm
program, that infiltrated the national Internet computer network beginning
on Nov 2, 1989. He is the first defendant in a federal prosecution of a
computer crime involving a virus or worm and his is the first case under
the 1986 law. The law makes it a felony to intentionally access a federal
interest computer without authorization. Morris allegedly paralyzed up to
6,200 university and military computers and caused substantial damage with
a worm released from Cornell University.

FONVIEW ALLOWS HACKS TO ANALYZE FONE BILLS:                     TSR (g.md 8\1)

    Compucom Communications Corp. and US Sprint have signed an agreement
for the introduction of what they claim is a telecommunications first: an
intelligent fone billing system using PC based technology.

    The new state-of-the-art billing option, designed by Compucom, eliminates
the need for many costly resources previously required to analyze fone calls
and expenses.  The new US Sprint product named "FONVIEW," has been adapted from
Compucom's software and production services entitled SMART BILL, for which a
patent application is being prepared.  US Sprint expects to introduce this
optional service during the third quarter of this year.

     Upon enrolling in Sprint's program, customers will receive a user-friendly
software diskette containing all of the programs necessary to analyze their US
Sprint fone bill, which will also be provided on an IBM PC compatible
diskette.  The software will enable users to analyze all or selected parts of
their fone bill and view the data on their PC screen, in report form, or via
graphic displays.

     Standard, menu-driven reports, including call distribution patterns, are
provided along with ad hoc report capabilities.  Call detail can be downloaded
to various electronic spread sheets.  The system also provides 12 months of
 historical cost and usage data in report and graphic format.  Users can
analyze data by such variables as area code, point of origin, department
number, time of day, and geographic range, to name a few.

     Since the late 1800's, fone bills have been provided on paper.

     In recent years, as an adjunct to paper bills for companies making
thousands of calls per month, long-distance call record detail has been
provided on magnetic tapes.  Analyzing magnetic tapes requires access to
mainframe computers, costly computer programs and personnel.  "FONVIEW"
effectively eliminates this need.
     Neither Hardy nor Sprint would disclose the terms of the agreement except
to say that it covers a wide range of services over a minimum three year
period.  Compucom is a mainframe-based computer service bureau specializing in
fone billing systems and software, fone traffic analysis and network
organization design services.

// Cellular Fone Sets Off Alarm //

   A call placed to a portable cellular fone carried aboard an airplane
apparently triggered the plane's electronic smoke alarm, forcing the Northwest
Airlink plane to land in Columbus, Ohio. Federal Aviation Administration
officials investigated, and sent the plane on its way after discovering the
cellular phone, the FAA said. Nine people were aboard the commuter flight.

// Navy Lofts 10 Satellites //

   General Dynamics Atlas rockets will loft 10 Navy communications satellites
into orbit in the early 1990s, the company said Tuesday. Manufacturer Hughes
Aircraft Co., said the first would be ready for launch in 1992. The satellites
are designed to be part of the Navy's worldwide communications network, and are
intended for delivery to orbit by the space shuttle or other launch vehicles.

// Sharks Like FO //

   For all its high technology, speed and convenience, fiber optics has one
unexpected disadvantage contributing to recent optical cable problems: fiber
optics attracts sharks. Engineers on two undersea cable projects have reported
the problem, and have had to take extra steps to ensure the cables against
damage. Why the cables trigger sharks' appetites remains unknown.

                                  THE STRIKES

     Just to fill this space...

     I've no mentioned anything about the recent BELL STRIKES, though they were
interesting and did affect many users.  As of mid-month Sept 4, all the
Communications Workers of America (CWA) and International Brotherhood of
electrical Workers (IBEW) members had agreed to contracts with Ameritech Corp.
 
     At Bell Atlantic Corps., settlements had been reached with CWA, but the
IBEW continued to strike for a while later against New Jersey Bell.

     Meanwhile, at Nynex Corp., CWA members and IBEW representatives were back
at the table talking about management responsibilities.

     The strike began August 5th, 1989.
         _____________________________________________________________

PI -- THAT ROUND NUMBER:

       Pi.  What a wonderfully irrational number.  Pi has recently been
calculated by Columbia Univ. scientists to over a billion places.  More than
twice that of 480 million places record in the past year.  The Univ. used a
pair of IBM 3090 supercomputers (something like my Cray Pc) at IBM's Research
Center and the experimental IBM Scratchpad automated algebra system to complete
the feat.

CRACKING OPEN YOU LOCAL BANK, CONTINUED:

       AND! if that isn't enough, six researches from Amdahl Corp. announced
recently the largest known prime number -- one that contains 65,087 digits.
       This is useful for cracking open Banks.  Banks use prime numbers as
passcodes.  Currently, I would estimate that they are using around 150 digits
of a prime.   I don't think that's very safe, but how many of us have access to
bank lines, and supercomputers.

dOGMA! TSR FEVERISHLY BATTERED                             TSR (c.s.comp 9\8)
BY CITADALIONS, AGAIN:

     Citadel people are great people.  They come in all sorts and sizes.  They
also make great shot guns, feverishly attempting to break the TSR back-bone:
Illegal Telcom Distribution.  Haha!  There is none!  So why whine about it?
I'm commenting on this one, like the last one, within the brackets [..]
     This particular event occured during, "Evil Feeble Weeble Wonble Week, on
SuperComputer Cita BBS (Sysop: Hue).  The Cita accusations before these,
occured on Citadel '86 (Sysop: Hue, Jr.)

       I START IT OUT AFTER BEING ACCUSED OF THE CRIME, WITH A RESPONSE:

   89Aug21 1:43 am from The Sensei
Phluffy, you prude -- leave me alone!!11@10!  Hue, I'll not upload another TSR
TOC to this system again.  Just because of Phluffy.

   89Aug21 4:55 pm from Hue
Prudishness has nothing to do with it.. this board prides itself on being on
the straight and narrow in all areas where the law might get interested..

   89Aug21 5:45 pm from Phluffy
   It does seem quite clear from the files tsr.23 and tsr.24 contained in this
directory that the "tsr" report is clearly engaged in providing information
that could only be used to facilitate criminal activities. I wonder how the
phone company would feel about this.

  [ Sensei here, commenting.  Criminal activities?  Tell me how much of that
sort of data is published within TSR?  Not much. It's mainly news.  No real
information that could get me busted. These guys are afraid of everything that
has to do with fraud -- guess it's called:  Old Age. ]

   89Aug22 7:52 pm from Hue
Say "bye bye" to the offending files everybody..

  [ I never got to say, "bye bye".  So, BYE! ]

   89Aug22 10:47 pm from Electric Dude
First amendment rights. Nothing illegal in printing the info.

  [ There is always a few BRAVE individuals out there to help me out during
times of "The Anti-1st Amendment Law."  This is a perfect example. Thanks
Electric Dude, true American. ]

   89Aug22 11:00 pm from ???

 MR. ROGERS: Can you say "Probable Cause"? [pause]  I knew you could.

   89Aug23 3:08 pm from Sado-Masochist
  I do believe, ED, that the FCC and many other governmental companies
would not be pleased..  it is an illegal act and printing illegal info..

   89Aug23 7:42 pm from Tin Soldier
Didn't you read the little clause in the files stating that they are only for
information purposes and not to be acted upon directly.  From the same
reasoning, there are book out there on how to make Nuks.  Is there a
difference?

  [ Strange, I never wrote such a thing in TSR -- since disclaimers really mean
nothing to anyone in the first place -- even the law. ]

   89Aug23 10:08 pm from Phluffy
   The little clause you refer to, Tin Soldier, is called a disclaimer, and it
has been held in court, that the disclaimer has no force, nor effect. If the
attorney who explained this to me was correct, if you publish the information,
and it is used to commit a crime, you are, de facto, an accomplishment to the
commission of that crime, and thereby liable for it.

   89Aug24 2:29 am from Puck
Nonono, otherwise gun companies would all be toast.

   89Aug24 9:55 am from Michelangelo
I checked, That should read BACKDOOR.ARC.  Rename it and de-ARC it.
That should work.  Sorry for the trouble, I was thinking one thing and typed
another.

   89Aug24 12:00 am from Electric Dude
What about the anarchists cookbook? Completely legal and also contains a lot of
info that could be used to commit various crimes.

   89Aug25 7:46 am from Sado-Masochist
  I can't explain that.. I guess the key word is "could" in your last post,
ED..  I dunno.  Any help?  Achilles?

   89Aug25 3:56 pm from Michelangelo
Anarchists Cookbook, eh?  Dangerous stuff, I've seen extracts foatong
around. Tell you how to break into Express Tellers and Blow up bridges, stuff
like that.  Why would someone want to know something like that anyway?
(unless they were planning to use it)  I think that t king of knowledge is not
good, but can't be called illegal.  Once you start censoring, where do you
stop?  Before long Isaac Asimov could be considered illegal!

   89Aug25 7:06 pm from Phluffy
   A priori censorship, is of course, not acceptable. However, a BBS is NOT a
free press, you use it by the sufferance of its owner, and you have no other
factual or derivative rights to its use than those which the owner of that BBS
chooses to allow you.
   By the same token, if you use a sysop's system to disseminate information
which is later used in the commission of a crime, and the source of the
information so used can be traced back to the system, then several courts have
held that the sysop is a de facto accomplice to the commission of that crime.
Therefore, Sensei, Eta alia, have to particular right to use this as a forum
for disseminating that sort of information.

   89Aug27 2:57 pm from The Sensei
Phluffy -- great vocabulary.  The main point of those that are on my side, are
saying that, "Yeah...it's not at all illegal to carry any type of information
on a bulletin board, unless it's owned by someone else.  Like codes, credit
cards, passcodes, etc."  The Syndicate Report isn't really that type of
information handout.  I haven't had any illegal information in it.

I've been busted many times before.  Once for hacking The Connection's (922
9000) VMS computers.  Edina Police, and the SS got involved.  I set up a few
of my TSR files on the VMS for people to dial in and download.  When Edina
came over, they showed me the file -- probably #12, since #13 explained my
bust, part 2.  The secret service showed no interest in it -- nor FBI.  They
just didn't want me on there, and distributing codes (since the SS controls
the treasury flow).

So, you see, it's all very innocent.  Read some of the articles, they are not
at all illegal/damaging.

NEW! THE PRODIAL V1.0 HACKER FOR APPLE //:                     TSR (c.g. 9\7)

                                  ProDial V1.0
                         Communication Disorders, Inc.

     ProDial is a new Apple // wardialer developed over the past six months.
It was designed and written by Cyber Groan from Minnesota (612).  Its main
purpose is to give old-fashioned hacking a new boost.  Since more modems are
added to the telephone lines daily, the value of a good wardialing program
increases.  Many systems still have default accounts, users who forget to log
off, glitches in the software, and mnemonic passwords.  ProDial represents the
first step in the hacking process - finding the modem telephone number.

     Features
     --------

     - ProTerm style windows and menus
     - A DOS command menu
     - Route output to printer, screen, "alarm bell", and/or data file
     - Dial up to 9 ranges simultaneously
     - Mix and match random with sequential dialing
     - A run-time menu enabling individual ranges to be de-activated

     Tech Info
     ---------

     - Requires 128k; enhanced //e, //c, or //gs
     - Current version (ProDial v1.0) supports 100% Hayes compatibles only
     - Programed in Applesoft BASIC with ML support files
     - ProDOS 8

     Final Notes
     -----------

     BETA test released on September 6, 1989.  Final release scheduled for the
second week of September.  Current updates may be found on Radio Waves BBS
(612-639-1053) and Tiamat's Temple (612-731-0296).
      Please direct any problems or suggestions to Cyber Groan.

PRIVACY A TOP CONCERN IN THE 1990s:                              TSR (u.s 9\8)

   Privacy-related issues could emerge as a major battleground for the cellular
telephone industry, an expert says. Network World reports in its Aug. 28 issue
that Sharon Nelson of the Washington State Utilities and Transportation
Commission says the industry might demand warnings on the phones telling
customers their conversations may be subject to electronic eavesdropping.

  [Oh well, life sucks.  I've reports what bandwidths, etc. these waves occupy,
so read previous TSR Brief/Extended Notes.  Thanks. -TS ]

  TSR HIT Vol. #1                                               TSR Issue #25

     What's New?  The TSR HIT (Historical Information Tome).   What HIT is, is
a BRAND NEW monthly column about the History of Telecommunications (Data, more
specifically, the modem world of hackers/phreaks, etc.)  Each month, I'll be
presenting you, the TSR reader, a new and exciting titbit of history.  For
we all should know our history -- and be able to manifest our history to
others....no matter what they are.

     And now for HIT, Volume #1:

         _____________________________________________________________

               THE TERM 'HACKER' HAUNTS COMPUTISTS OF MIT, AGAIN

         Back in the day, when they used to say Hacker, they meant someone who
literally HACKS on computers, one who is devoted to working with computers.
Computists from MIT coined the phrase.  Now, of course, the term 'hacker' means
much more.  It has evolved quickly to mean someone who commits computer crime
(and other detailed terminology).   The old to some, new to others MEANING
casts casts aspersions on all old hackers.  New laws are needed to specifically
cover computer crimes.
         To the last generation of computists from MIT, the term 'hacker'
should not be used where 'cracker' would be more appropriate.  Now we have the
term 'cracker' to fondle with.  Doesn't 'cracker' now mean one who commits
crime on software?  Yes, it does.  Now we need a new term for 'cracker'.
How about, 'decoder'? or 'ware-breaker'? or better yet...'Software Company
(out-of-business) Pain In The Ass'!
          _____________________________________________________________

                       INTEL'S ANTI-HACKER [KEPROM] CHIP

     KEPROM is Intel's new anti-hacker chip. To protect links between remote
equipment and a host computer, all that need be done is to replace a standard
128-Kbyte EPROM chip with the 128-Kbyte KEPROM and write 500 bytes of code. At
$45 each, the KEPROMs are low in cost compared to the cost of implementing the
United States data encryption software. Only the systems designer has to know
the combination, which will put up a strong barrier against a computer hacker
or software pirate.
     Really?  Does anyone know if this thing has been implement?  Or even acted
upon -- by even an inch?  Other than past this article?  Thought-Not-Tot.

                            -End of TSR HIT Vol. #1-

  [Last minute info: HIT articles are mainly information gathered by me over
the years -- mainly from memory, experience.  If you have had any experiences
like these, send them to Radio Waves via mail, or TSR Mag. Files area. Thanks]

// A Consultant Talks To Ignorant //

     Donn Parker, computer security consultant, advises DP managers to think
like hackers so they will know what to look for in terms of their own data
security and be able to develop data security plans. Various means by which
hackers breach system security include shoulder surfing, the stealing of
passwords from employees when they sign on; spoofing (Social Engineering?),
the lying to individuals to obtain information; data diddling, the intentional
entering of false data into a system; and logic bombs, which are the most
difficult to detect and the most destructive to a system.

// PACBELL Files Suit //

   Pacific Bell has filed a lawsuit in a California court seeking clarification
of its right to disconnect dial-a-porn services. The carrier filed Wednesday in
San Francisco superior court, naming 13 pornographic telephone services as
defendants. The company asked the court to recognize it as a private business
with the right to refuse service to dial-a-porn agencies.
   Pacific Bell's filing for clarification of its right to disconnect sexually
explicit 976 services came following a Tuesday ruling by federal courts that
said private businesses could refuse to sell the services. The federal ruling
didn't address whether Pac Bell was considered a private company or a public
utility.  Pacific Bell officials said the company disapproves of the services.

// SPRINT Offers New Service //

   U.S. Sprint announced Thursday that Integrated Services Digital Network
features will be available during the first quarter of 1990. ISDN features
include primary rate interface, integrated telenet packet data access and call-

network that responds more quickly, they said.
