Exposition:

   Once again, TSReport now excepts outside sources. Anyone can write/provide
   information to the Syndicate Report. The Syndicate Report is also altering
   format. Rather than concentrating mainly on BELL orientated information,
   the Syndicate Report now has a more broad interest. Thus, TSR now handles
   all types of news gatherings.

   All articles have been presented by me unless shown at the end of the
   article as the information provider(s).

  ============================================================================

Author's Note:

   Welcome to another issue of The Syndicate Report. This is the 13th issue
   of The Report which makes it well over a year old. At this point, I would
   like to clear up some past happenings featured in TSR #12 about Phrack Inc.
   The article concerning Mr Pez having a Phrack Account on his board, or
   assembling a Phrack Team are only rumors and not true.

Dated:  6/14/87

   At first, I was almost forced to stop publishing the Syndicate Report due
   to legal problems. (All explained later) But I thought about the situation
   and I realized there was ways around the law. So continue to expect TSR.

DAN THE OPERATOR - EXPOSED AS AN INFOMANT FOR MAXFIELD:

       Dan the Operator AKA Noah, was recently discovered by Phrack Inc. and
TeleComputists Newletter as an INFORMANT to John Maxfield (BoardScan). It appears that Knight Lightning discovered this while Dan the Operator was
exchanging information with Maxfield on some of the people that showed up at
SummerCon '87.

Some of the People that were discussed:
                                                                                Tuc, Jester Sluggo, Phucked Agent 04, Videosmith, Chesire Catalyst,
Mark Tabas, Karl Marx, The Safe Cracker, The Marauder, Genghis Khan,
Doc Holiday, Kloey Detect, Violet Bouregard, and Disk Jockey.

Dan the Operator Personal Info.:

Real Name:  Noah Wallach           (Info. compliments of Freeworld ][ Users)

Address:  5200 Myer Ct.
          Rockville, MD  20853

       Here now is an exact printout of the message Dan the Operator sent
to me on the Syndicate Newsline - 11:30 am, Monday July 6th '87.

       "This is BIG BAD Noah Wallach here, man. Like what's up? I see your trying to do a report on me, and I hate your fuckin' ass. I don't want you to
say nothin' more on Havoc's Board, man. (Freeworld ][ Private) I'm gettin' a little pissed. I'm a little informat out ther spying on all of you. And I hate your god damn dick. Don't ever say anything more on Major Havoc's board, or I'll have to kick some anus. You little
 fucker for giving out my phone number and all that crap. You little fucker, you little fucker. See you later asshole." That was a complete type up of DA's msg to me via TSR Newsline.

       I heard he was a little on the homosexual side...but he sure likes to
talk about my private parts. Right after I heard the message from Noah, I
instantly called up Freeworld ][ Private to get a 'Previous Callers' log.
This is was it had:

                                                      *UPDATE*  This is a recent update on Noah Wallach:

       Dan the Operator sent me another message over TSR Newlines on July 14th
at approximately 12:30 am. Read carefully, this could affect you...

       "This is big bad Noah Wallach again. I see you haven't quit reporting
about me, man. I see you didn't take my warnings seriously. I also hear your in a little trouble with the Capital Interstate Cops...I hope they hang your fucking ass. If they don't
I will. You may think you know me, but you don't at all. I know everything about everybody, and there's going to be a major sting operation. And it's going to be located by every phreak in the nation. Watch your back Phreak Sensei, you telephone line loser."

       I'm taking Dan's advise and am very weary about recent new boards etc...
Keep your eyes and ears open people. Please make all reports to either TSR or
Phrack Inc. This boy is out to get us. Thank you.

       Look for a short interview with Dan
the Operator.

LETTER IN REGARDS OF FCC TAXING DATACOMMUNICATIONISTS:

     NOTE: This is only a suggested* letter to send to the FCC.  Please do
     not send a verbatim copy of this letter, because it won't do much good
     if they see 2000 copies of the same letter simply sent by different
     people.  If you can come up with your own reasoning and wording to
     protest the access charge, it would have a better impact.

     Chairman Dennis R. Patrick
     1919 M Street Northwest
     Washington, DC  20554


     Dear Mr. Patrick,

          I am writing in regard to the recent proposal to charge a $4.50
     to $5.50 per hour access charge for computer users using data bases
     and computer information services.  I feel that this proposed charge
     for value-added telecommunications services is unfair and overpriced,
     because the fees charged by most telecommunications services would
     rise steeply if this proposal became law.  Usage of these services
     would drop dramatically if this proposal is passed.

          I can appreciate the reasoning that since people are using
     computer networks to make money, the local telephone companies deserve
     a share of this money.  However, the major commercial data bases, such
     as Dow Jones, NewsNet, and Source Plus, charge $20 to $40 per hour.  A
     $5.00 per hour charge would be rather substantial when added to this
     price.  The situation gets worse when services used by computer
     hobbyists are considered.  Computer services used by hobbyists, such
     as The Source, GEnie, and Delphi, charge only $5.00 to $15.00 per
     hour.  When a $5.00 per hour access charge is added to that, the
     hourly cost would become prohibitive for subscribers.

          The hardest hit networks would be the services that are run by
     computer hobbyists for other computer hobbyists.  The vast majority of
     these services charge no fee, and are run on personal computers with
     one incoming phone line.  These services, popularly called Bulletin
     Board Services or BBS's, are used most often for technical discussions
     about various computer topics, discussions about musical instruments,
     or general social discussion and commentary.  These hobbyist-run
     services are not providing value-added services, so it is not
     reasonable to charge an access charge if these services are not used
     to make money.  If a $5.00 per hour access charge was applied to these
     bulletin board systems, hobbyists would quickly go broke or be forced
     to take down their systems.

          It should also be considered that it does not cost the telephone
     companies any more to switch a data call through the network than it
     does to switch a regular voice call through the network.  If an access
     charge became law, the telephone companies would get an undeserved
     windfall from these services.  This hardly seems fair to the average
     consumer.

          I urge you to reconsider the access charge.  It should either be
     based on a percentage of the hourly fee charged by value-added
     services, with no access charge for systems that do not have an hourly
     charge, or dropped entirely.  This would be fair for all computer
     users and telephone companies alike.

NORTHWESTERN BELL'S CAROLINE:

       About a year ago, Caroline was restructed to be better postioned to
capture residential marketing. A five-feature package billed at 10$ per month
was trimmed to three basic features - call hold, call transfer and conference
(three-way) calling -- and priced more affordably at 5$ monthly.

       CaroLine Features:

* Call Hold - Besides putting a caller on hold, it can also be used to hang
              up a phone and use an extension in another room without losing
              the caller.
                                                                                * Call Transfer - Allows transfer of a call in progress to another line.

* Conference Calling - Allows third party to be added to a a conversation.

* Call Pick-Up - Allows a customer with two or more lines to answer from any
                 phone.

* Call waiting - Signals a second call and enables customer to put first caller
                 on hold.

* Call forwarding - Enables a customer to route incoming calls to another line.

* Convenience dialing - Also known as speed calling, enables one and two-digit
                        dialing.

* Alternate Answer - Enables users to prearrange calls coming in on one line
                     to automatically transfer to another ine after a specific
                     number of rings, or when a busy signal is engaged.

* Intra-Call - Enables customers to dail extensions.

       All of these CaroLine Features require only one peice of hardware...
Your Standard Bell Telephone.

CONTEL MERGER:

       Contel Corp., with 2.3 million telephone customers in 30 states,
announced this week it will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Communications
Satellite Corp., under a stock swap merger agreement.  The merger is expected
to be complete next year.

  ============================================================================

CALLING CARDS TERMED 'DISCRIMINATORY':

 The Department of Justice (DOJ) notified the seven regional Bell operating
companies (BOCs) July 5 that it is investigating that advertising and use of
calling cards issued by their telephone company subsidiaries for
interexchanging service.

The department's concern is that BOCs may be in violation of the Modified
Final Judgment because interexchange calls can be charged to their cards only if
the calls are carried by AT&T. It said the same billing arrangements are not
available to other competing carriers.

The DOJ noted that this discrimination "appears to have been an unavoidable
consequence of allowing AT&T and the Bocs to share a credit card data base" at
the time of divesture and the BOCs are in the process of developing their own
data bases.

The DOJ has ordered that the BOCs immediately cease advertising and promotion of
their calling cards for interexchange calling; notify calling card customers
that the cards are intended only for interexchange calling; and also notify
them that such calls are completed by AT&T even if the customer has
presubscribed to another carrier.

Bell has issued over 21 million calling cards in it's 7 Regional Bell
Operating Companies.

  ============================================================================

RESTRICTIONS ON AUTOMATIC DIALING DEVICES:

Your chances of being awakened by a computerized sales call will be
substantially reduced after August 1. A bill which places restrictions on
telemarketers using prerecorded or synthesized voice messages makes such calls
illegal before 9 am and after 9 pm.

The bill also requires that such devices disconnect within 10 seconds
after the phone is hung up and specifies that the message cannot be delivered
unless information about the caller and the purpose of the call is first provided by a live operator.

*BUSTED AT LAST:  THE SENSEI OF THE SYNDICATE REPORT:*

      "This may be the very last article I will write. A complete write up
will also be released."

Well, I finally got the axe from Bell. From all the years of loyal service I've
given them, they were forced to finally take action. I won't say too much, I'm
still bummed out from the visit from Capital Police. I'm typing this hours from
the actual visit, since I don't think I'll be having my computer/modems etc.,
much longer.

 It all started on a Unix system in the 415. I don't know how they got to me all
the way from Calif., but they did. I must have tripped an alarm, I'm guessing.
Anyways, I'm giving this to a friend, and he'll probably leave it on
Brewery or Freeworld ][ Private (301-668-7657). I don't want all my accounts
deleted right away from any System Operator reading this...I may be pay for a
call here and there to keep in touch. Mainly I'll keep it to a few select
systems, until I find a new way of calling LD without worry of traces. My
complete story I'd like to submit to Phrack Inc. To get in touch with me call
my home line if you know it, or 612-829-8503 or 8504.
                                                                                       Oh, they told me to get a new hobby, so I took up a new language.

Author's Note:

       Welcome to Part 2 of The Syndicate Report Issue #13. I've added this
  extra transmittal due to the extra amount of news going around. This issue
  was dedicated directly to my experience with MCI and Mpls Interstate Cops.

       Also, there will be an upcoming feature about Silent Assault, a local
  612 Phreak, most likely in TSR #14. It will feature how SA's bust.

"This is might be the last article I will write, I'm still waiting to
here from the Secret Service."

It was 1:11 pm - July 8, 1987. I had woken up around 11:00 pm from a busy
night of scanning Bell's Test Access System in California (415 UNIX). That night
I had gotten into the system. Nodename was 'tuuv7'. I only had a chance to check
my privs. on the Unix when I was logged out. I just sat there staring at the
'CONNECTION LOST...' note on my screen wondering what I actually did wrong. I
tried to ring the System back to continue, but all I received was a solid
ringing. I thought that I must have tripped an alarm. I then decided to turn in
for the night, and give a wack at it in the morning.


As I said before, I woke up at 11:00. I booted up the terminal program, and attempted to log back into the Bell Unix. It gave me a car
rier, but this time I didn't have to enter in the 'Password:', just the 'Function:'. And all I got this time was '>UNIX=tuu7', And nothing else. I just hung up, and would bring up the question on Osuny BBS.

       I attempted to dial Osuny Bbs, only to find I had an invalid code on my hands. Not willing to pay for an LD call, I picked out another one. Then before I could dial the local Acc Number, I heard a loud knocking at my back door. I wondered who the hell knocks as loud as that, and went to answer it
. As I just walked out of my room, I seen what it looked like as a local cop searching for someone/something around my house. I didn't waste another second, and instantly ran back to my room and stashed all the illegal items I could into a private place. I caught my breath, and by this time they had stopped knocking. I thought they had gone away, but instead I found them just sitting in their unmarked car. I thought this was strange, since cops usually come in regular cops cars to haul you away for a parkin
g ticket. Well, I didn't feel like letting them sit out there all day, so I walked out and ask if I could help them. They got out of the car quicker than thought possible and asked me questions..."What's your full name, How old are you, Do you have a computer...YES? Do you have a modem? etc...After the 101 questions about my life, they wanted to see my set-up because they got a call from MCI and Bell about codes and hacking into their computers. They said they had a trace on my line for about 3 days, and kn
ew ever where I called. I brang them to my room easily knowing all the illegal items had been stashed. The first of the two Capital Police of Minneapolis (That's what their badges said), came first to my room, and the second didn't follow right away. The first cop was a moron. He looked over my set up, and asked what everthing was. I quess the second cop knew all about computers. The second cop picked up all my notes and started reading them. He first looked at Phrack World News XIV/2, then my 13th Transmit
tal of The Syndicate Report, then a list of local systems I had scanned out the night before. He asked what I was looking for with all these numbers. I just said I was looking for HLI DDS Systems, knowing he knew nothing about HLI's. All the documents looked over were: Various Phrack files, Syndicate Reports, a few TAP/2600 Mags., countless UNIX files and discussions (Posts with Users Names, Systems Names, Dates etc.), and an interview file I had for the Informant - Dan the Operator. He took all of these an
d 4 books of notes I had.

       I then looked at my screen, and forgotten I had a hacker loaded up, but I only had a listing of it. He asked me what it was, I said a word processor. He then asked my what my private phone numbers are. I told him my parents number, and the actual one I used for scanning. But I told him a fake number for my third line, knowing that it just rings and rings if you call it. The second cop looked over my modem and told me he would have to take it downtown for a while. I asked hi
m when/if I would get it back, he said soon. I wasn't worried to much, I had two more modems put away. He then paged through my disks, taking all the general files, and a few utility disks etc. He asked me about MCI's access codes I used. I told him I just tried it a couple of times, and gave up. He didn't beleive me and asked if I gave out the following codes to anyone, and he listed a bunch. Of course the only word that came from me was 'NO'.

       They then informed me that fraudulent use of Codes an
d Hacking are illegal, and could bring Federal charges since calls where made all over hell. He also said the Secret Service will get in touch with me. And that was it.

       I have yet to wait for the Secret Service to call, or come over. I have really nothing to say about phreak/hacking, and no regrets as of yet. I knew the chances wadged against me, but since I'm still a minor I continued.

       The last issue of The Syndicate Report is Transmittal #13. I've put out
TSR for well over a year, and had
no intention of quitting. But these
circumstances force me to stop, atleast for now. The Syndicate Report will
continue to be published monthly.

At this time I would like to thank the following people/boards:

Captian's Log      -    Where I first learn the very basics of phreaking.
                        I don't quite remember the person's name that
                        explained phreaking, but I thank him.
2001 BBS           -    Bootleg's old system in the 503.  A lot of great

  discussions came out of that system.
Private Sector BBS -    2600 Magazine, Kid & Co.
Police Station     -    Hours of hacking into this once great system.
I.P.D              -    International Phreaks/Pirates Division - First group
                        I was a member to.
Phrack Inc.        -    For PWN, Support and idea for The Syndicate Report
MCI                -    For years of loyal service
