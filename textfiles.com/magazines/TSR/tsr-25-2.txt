EDITOR'S NOTE:                                                            TSR
 
                                  THE STRIKES

     Just to fill this space...

     I've no mentioned anything about the recent BELL STRIKES, though they were
interesting and did affect many users.  As of mid-month Sept 4, all the
Communications Workers of America (CWA) and International Brotherhood of
electrical Workers (IBEW) members had agreed to contracts with Ameritech Corp.
 
     At Bell Atlantic Corps., settlements had been reached with CWA, but the
IBEW continued to strike for a while later against New Jersey Bell.

     Meanwhile, at Nynex Corp., CWA members and IBEW representatives were back
at the table talking about management responsibilities.

     The strike began August 5th, 1989.
         _____________________________________________________________

PI -- THAT ROUND NUMBER:

       Pi.  What a wonderfully irrational number.  Pi has recently been
calculated by Columbia Univ. scientists to over a billion places.  More than
twice that of 480 million places record in the past year.  The Univ. used a
pair of IBM 3090 supercomputers (something like my Cray Pc) at IBM's Research
Center and the experimental IBM Scratchpad automated algebra system to complete
the feat.

CRACKING OPEN YOU LOCAL BANK, CONTINUED:

       AND! if that isn't enough, six researches from Amdahl Corp. announced
recently the largest known prime number -- one that contains 65,087 digits.
       This is useful for cracking open Banks.  Banks use prime numbers as
passcodes.  Currently, I would estimate that they are using around 150 digits
of a prime.   I don't think that's very safe, but how many of us have access to
bank lines, and supercomputers.

dOGMA! TSR FEVERISHLY BATTERED                             TSR (c.s.comp 9\8)
BY CITADALIONS, AGAIN:

     Citadel people are great people.  They come in all sorts and sizes.  They
also make great shot guns, feverishly attempting to break the TSR back-bone:
Illegal Telcom Distribution.  Haha!  There is none!  So why whine about it?
I'm commenting on this one, like the last one, within the brackets [..]
     This particular event occured during, "Evil Feeble Weeble Wonble Week, on
SuperComputer Cita BBS (Sysop: Hue).  The Cita accusations before these,
occured on Citadel '86 (Sysop: Hue, Jr.)

       I START IT OUT AFTER BEING ACCUSED OF THE CRIME, WITH A RESPONSE:

   89Aug21 1:43 am from The Sensei
Phluffy, you prude -- leave me alone!!11@10!  Hue, I'll not upload another TSR
TOC to this system again.  Just because of Phluffy.

   89Aug21 4:55 pm from Hue
Prudishness has nothing to do with it.. this board prides itself on being on
the straight and narrow in all areas where the law might get interested..

   89Aug21 5:45 pm from Phluffy
   It does seem quite clear from the files tsr.23 and tsr.24 contained in this
directory that the "tsr" report is clearly engaged in providing information
that could only be used to facilitate criminal activities. I wonder how the
phone company would feel about this.

  [ Sensei here, commenting.  Criminal activities?  Tell me how much of that
sort of data is published within TSR?  Not much. It's mainly news.  No real
information that could get me busted. These guys are afraid of everything that
has to do with fraud -- guess it's called:  Old Age. ]

   89Aug22 7:52 pm from Hue
Say "bye bye" to the offending files everybody..

  [ I never got to say, "bye bye".  So, BYE! ]

   89Aug22 10:47 pm from Electric Dude
First amendment rights. Nothing illegal in printing the info.

  [ There is always a few BRAVE individuals out there to help me out during
times of "The Anti-1st Amendment Law."  This is a perfect example. Thanks
Electric Dude, true American. ]

   89Aug22 11:00 pm from ???

 MR. ROGERS: Can you say "Probable Cause"? [pause]  I knew you could.

   89Aug23 3:08 pm from Sado-Masochist
  I do believe, ED, that the FCC and many other governmental companies
would not be pleased..  it is an illegal act and printing illegal info..

   89Aug23 7:42 pm from Tin Soldier
Didn't you read the little clause in the files stating that they are only for
information purposes and not to be acted upon directly.  From the same
reasoning, there are book out there on how to make Nuks.  Is there a
difference?

  [ Strange, I never wrote such a thing in TSR -- since disclaimers really mean
nothing to anyone in the first place -- even the law. ]

   89Aug23 10:08 pm from Phluffy
   The little clause you refer to, Tin Soldier, is called a disclaimer, and it
has been held in court, that the disclaimer has no force, nor effect. If the
attorney who explained this to me was correct, if you publish the information,
and it is used to commit a crime, you are, de facto, an accomplishment to the
commission of that crime, and thereby liable for it.

   89Aug24 2:29 am from Puck
Nonono, otherwise gun companies would all be toast.

   89Aug24 9:55 am from Michelangelo
I checked, That should read BACKDOOR.ARC.  Rename it and de-ARC it.
That should work.  Sorry for the trouble, I was thinking one thing and typed
another.

   89Aug24 12:00 am from Electric Dude
What about the anarchists cookbook? Completely legal and also contains a lot of
info that could be used to commit various crimes.

   89Aug25 7:46 am from Sado-Masochist
  I can't explain that.. I guess the key word is "could" in your last post,
ED..  I dunno.  Any help?  Achilles?

   89Aug25 3:56 pm from Michelangelo
Anarchists Cookbook, eh?  Dangerous stuff, I've seen extracts foatong
around. Tell you how to break into Express Tellers and Blow up bridges, stuff
like that.  Why would someone want to know something like that anyway?
(unless they were planning to use it)  I think that t king of knowledge is not
good, but can't be called illegal.  Once you start censoring, where do you
stop?  Before long Isaac Asimov could be considered illegal!

   89Aug25 7:06 pm from Phluffy
   A priori censorship, is of course, not acceptable. However, a BBS is NOT a
free press, you use it by the sufferance of its owner, and you have no other
factual or derivative rights to its use than those which the owner of that BBS
chooses to allow you.
   By the same token, if you use a sysop's system to disseminate information
which is later used in the commission of a crime, and the source of the
information so used can be traced back to the system, then several courts have
held that the sysop is a de facto accomplice to the commission of that crime.
Therefore, Sensei, Eta alia, have to particular right to use this as a forum
for disseminating that sort of information.

   89Aug27 2:57 pm from The Sensei
Phluffy -- great vocabulary.  The main point of those that are on my side, are
saying that, "Yeah...it's not at all illegal to carry any type of information
on a bulletin board, unless it's owned by someone else.  Like codes, credit
cards, passcodes, etc."  The Syndicate Report isn't really that type of
information handout.  I haven't had any illegal information in it.

I've been busted many times before.  Once for hacking The Connection's (922
9000) VMS computers.  Edina Police, and the SS got involved.  I set up a few
of my TSR files on the VMS for people to dial in and download.  When Edina
came over, they showed me the file -- probably #12, since #13 explained my
bust, part 2.  The secret service showed no interest in it -- nor FBI.  They
just didn't want me on there, and distributing codes (since the SS controls
the treasury flow).

So, you see, it's all very innocent.  Read some of the articles, they are not
at all illegal/damaging.

NEW! THE PRODIAL V1.0 HACKER FOR APPLE //:                     TSR (c.g. 9\7)

                                  ProDial V1.0
                         Communication Disorders, Inc.

     ProDial is a new Apple // wardialer developed over the past six months.
It was designed and written by Cyber Groan from Minnesota (612).  Its main
purpose is to give old-fashioned hacking a new boost.  Since more modems are
added to the telephone lines daily, the value of a good wardialing program
increases.  Many systems still have default accounts, users who forget to log
off, glitches in the software, and mnemonic passwords.  ProDial represents the
first step in the hacking process - finding the modem telephone number.

     Features
     --------

     - ProTerm style windows and menus
     - A DOS command menu
     - Route output to printer, screen, "alarm bell", and/or data file
     - Dial up to 9 ranges simultaneously
     - Mix and match random with sequential dialing
     - A run-time menu enabling individual ranges to be de-activated

     Tech Info
     ---------

     - Requires 128k; enhanced //e, //c, or //gs
     - Current version (ProDial v1.0) supports 100% Hayes compatibles only
     - Programed in Applesoft BASIC with ML support files
     - ProDOS 8

     Final Notes
     -----------

     BETA test released on September 6, 1989.  Final release scheduled for the
second week of September.  Current updates may be found on Radio Waves BBS
(612-639-1053) and Tiamat's Temple (612-731-0296).
      Please direct any problems or suggestions to Cyber Groan.

PRIVACY A TOP CONCERN IN THE 1990s:                              TSR (u.s 9\8)

   Privacy-related issues could emerge as a major battleground for the cellular
telephone industry, an expert says. Network World reports in its Aug. 28 issue
that Sharon Nelson of the Washington State Utilities and Transportation
Commission says the industry might demand warnings on the phones telling
customers their conversations may be subject to electronic eavesdropping.

  [Oh well, life sucks.  I've reports what bandwidths, etc. these waves occupy,
so read previous TSR Brief/Extended Notes.  Thanks. -TS ]

  TSR HIT Vol. #1                                               TSR Issue #25

     What's New?  The TSR HIT (Historical Information Tome).   What HIT is, is
a BRAND NEW monthly column about the History of Telecommunications (Data, more
specifically, the modem world of hackers/phreaks, etc.)  Each month, I'll be
presenting you, the TSR reader, a new and exciting titbit of history.  For
we all should know our history -- and be able to manifest our history to
others....no matter what they are.

     And now for HIT, Volume #1:

         _____________________________________________________________

               THE TERM 'HACKER' HAUNTS COMPUTISTS OF MIT, AGAIN

         Back in the day, when they used to say Hacker, they meant someone who
literally HACKS on computers, one who is devoted to working with computers.
Computists from MIT coined the phrase.  Now, of course, the term 'hacker' means
much more.  It has evolved quickly to mean someone who commits computer crime
(and other detailed terminology).   The old to some, new to others MEANING
casts casts aspersions on all old hackers.  New laws are needed to specifically
cover computer crimes.
         To the last generation of computists from MIT, the term 'hacker'
should not be used where 'cracker' would be more appropriate.  Now we have the
term 'cracker' to fondle with.  Doesn't 'cracker' now mean one who commits
crime on software?  Yes, it does.  Now we need a new term for 'cracker'.
How about, 'decoder'? or 'ware-breaker'? or better yet...'Software Company
(out-of-business) Pain In The Ass'!
          _____________________________________________________________

                       INTEL'S ANTI-HACKER [KEPROM] CHIP

     KEPROM is Intel's new anti-hacker chip. To protect links between remote
equipment and a host computer, all that need be done is to replace a standard
128-Kbyte EPROM chip with the 128-Kbyte KEPROM and write 500 bytes of code. At
$45 each, the KEPROMs are low in cost compared to the cost of implementing the
United States data encryption software. Only the systems designer has to know
the combination, which will put up a strong barrier against a computer hacker
or software pirate.
     Really?  Does anyone know if this thing has been implement?  Or even acted
upon -- by even an inch?  Other than past this article?  Thought-Not-Tot.

                            -End of TSR HIT Vol. #1-

// A Consultant Talks To Ignorant //

     Donn Parker, computer security consultant, advises DP managers to think
like hackers so they will know what to look for in terms of their own data
security and be able to develop data security plans. Various means by which
hackers breach system security include shoulder surfing, the stealing of
passwords from employees when they sign on; spoofing (Social Engineering?),
the lying to individuals to obtain information; data diddling, the intentional
entering of false data into a system; and logic bombs, which are the most
difficult to detect and the most destructive to a system.

// PACBELL Files Suit //

   Pacific Bell has filed a lawsuit in a California court seeking clarification
of its right to disconnect dial-a-porn services. The carrier filed Wednesday in
San Francisco superior court, naming 13 pornographic telephone services as
defendants. The company asked the court to recognize it as a private business
with the right to refuse service to dial-a-porn agencies.
   Pacific Bell's filing for clarification of its right to disconnect sexually
explicit 976 services came following a Tuesday ruling by federal courts that
said private businesses could refuse to sell the services. The federal ruling
didn't address whether Pac Bell was considered a private company or a public
utility.  Pacific Bell officials said the company disapproves of the services.
