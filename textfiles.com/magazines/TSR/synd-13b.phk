Exposition:

   Once again, TSReport now excepts outside sources. Anyone can write/provide
   information to the Syndicate Report. The Syndicate Report is also altering
   format.  Rather than  concentrating mainly on BELL orientated information,
   the Syndicate Report now has a more broad interest.  Thus, TSR now handles
   all types of news gatherings.

   All articles have been presented by me unless shown at the end of the
   article as the information provider(s).

  ============================================================================

Author's Note:

   Welcome to another issue of The Syndicate Report.  This is the 13th issue
   of The Report which makes it well over a year old.  At this point, I would
   like to clear up some past happenings featured in TSR #12 about Phrack Inc.
   The article concerning Mr Pez having a Phrack Account on his board, or
   assembling a Phrack Team are only rumors and not true.

Dated:  6/14/87

   At first, I was almost forced to stop publishing the Syndicate Report due
   to legal problems. (All explained later)  But I thought about the situation
   and I realized there was ways around the law.  So continue to expect TSR.

  ============================================================================

DAN THE OPERATOR - EXPOSED AS AN INFOMANT FOR MAXFIELD:

       Dan the Operator AKA Noah, was recently discovered by Phrack Inc. and
TeleComputists Newletter as an INFORMANT to John Maxfield (BoardScan).  It
appears that Knight Lightning discovered this while Dan the Operator was
exchanging information with Maxfield on some of the people that showed up at
SummerCon '87.

Some of the People that were discussed:

Tuc, Jester Sluggo, Phucked Agent 04, Videosmith, Chesire Catalyst,
Mark Tabas, Karl Marx, The Safe Cracker, The Marauder, Genghis Khan,
Doc Holiday, Kloey Detect, Violet Bouregard, and Disk Jockey.

Dan the Operator Personal Info.:

Real Name:  Noah Wallach           (Info. compliments of Freeworld ][ Users)

Address:  5200 Myer Ct.
          Rockville, MD  20853

       Here now is an exact printout of the message Dan the Operator sent
to me on the Syndicate Newsline - 11:30 am, Monday July 6th '87.

       "This is BIG BAD Noah Wallach here, man.  Like what's up?  I see your
trying to do a report on me, and I hate your fuckin' ass.  I don't want you to
say nothin' more on Havoc's Board, man. (Freeworld ][ Private) I'm gettin'
a little pissed.  I'm a little informat out ther spying on all of you.  And I
hate your god damn dick.  Don't ever say anything more on Major Havoc's board,
or I'll have to kick some anus.  You little fucker for giving out my phone
number and all that crap.  You little fucker, you little fucker.  See you later
asshole."  That was a complete type up of DA's msg to me via TSR Newsline.

       I heard he was a little on the homosexual side...but he sure likes to
talk about my private parts.  Right after I heard the message from Noah, I
instantly called up Freeworld ][ Private to get a 'Previous Callers' log.
This is was it had:

1174, Wasteland Warrior - Acc Lv: 6
1175, Clyde Ferndox - Acc Lv: 6
1176, The Spiker - Acc Lv: 7
1177, David Trader - Ac Lv: 6  (I suggested this one...name fits his style)
1178, Samson - Acc Lv: 5
1179, Mystical Kiler - Acc Lv: 5
1180, Keymaster - Acc Lv: 5
1181, Myself...etc.

       *You make the evaluation, and come a conclusion on Noah's new handle.*

 *UPDATE*  This is a recent update on Noah Wallach:

       Dan the Operator sent me another message over TSR Newlines on July 14th
at approximately 12:30 am.  Read carefully, this could affect you...

       "This is big bad Noah Wallach again.  I see you haven't quit reporting
about me, man.  I see you didn't take my warnings seriously.  I also hear your
in a little trouble with the Capital Interstate Cops...I hope they hang your
fucking ass.  If they don't I will.  You may think you know me, but you don't
at all.  I know everything about everybody, and there's going to be a major
sting operation.  And it's going to be located by every phreak in the nation.
Watch your back Phreak Sensei, you telephone line loser."

       I'm taking Dan's advise and am very weary about recent new boards etc...
Keep your eyes and ears open people.  Please make all reports to either TSR or
Phrack Inc.  This boy is out to get us.  Thank you.

       Look for a short interview with Dan the Operator.

LETTER IN REGARDS OF FCC TAXING DATACOMMUNICATIONISTS:

     NOTE: This is only a suggested* letter to send to the FCC.  Please do
     not send a verbatim copy of this letter, because it won't do much good
     if they see 2000 copies of the same letter simply sent by different
     people.  If you can come up with your own reasoning and wording to
     protest the access charge, it would have a better impact.

     Chairman Dennis R. Patrick
     1919 M Street Northwest
     Washington, DC  20554


     Dear Mr. Patrick,

          I am writing in regard to the recent proposal to charge a $4.50
     to $5.50 per hour access charge for computer users using data bases
     and computer information services.  I feel that this proposed charge
     for value-added telecommunications services is unfair and overpriced,
     because the fees charged by most telecommunications services would
     rise steeply if this proposal became law.  Usage of these services
     would drop dramatically if this proposal is passed.

          I can appreciate the reasoning that since people are using
     computer networks to make money, the local telephone companies deserve
     a share of this money.  However, the major commercial data bases, such
     as Dow Jones, NewsNet, and Source Plus, charge $20 to $40 per hour.  A
     $5.00 per hour charge would be rather substantial when added to this
     price.  The situation gets worse when services used by computer
     hobbyists are considered.  Computer services used by hobbyists, such
     as The Source, GEnie, and Delphi, charge only $5.00 to $15.00 per
     hour.  When a $5.00 per hour access charge is added to that, the
     hourly cost would become prohibitive for subscribers.

          The hardest hit networks would be the services that are run by
     computer hobbyists for other computer hobbyists.  The vast majority of
     these services charge no fee, and are run on personal computers with
     one incoming phone line.  These services, popularly called Bulletin
     Board Services or BBS's, are used most often for technical discussions
     about various computer topics, discussions about musical instruments,
     or general social discussion and commentary.  These hobbyist-run
     services are not providing value-added services, so it is not
     reasonable to charge an access charge if these services are not used
     to make money.  If a $5.00 per hour access charge was applied to these
     bulletin board systems, hobbyists would quickly go broke or be forced
     to take down their systems.

          It should also be considered that it does not cost the telephone
     companies any more to switch a data call through the network than it
     does to switch a regular voice call through the network.  If an access
     charge became law, the telephone companies would get an undeserved
     windfall from these services.  This hardly seems fair to the average
     consumer.

          I urge you to reconsider the access charge.  It should either be
     based on a percentage of the hourly fee charged by value-added
     services, with no access charge for systems that do not have an hourly
     charge, or dropped entirely.  This would be fair for all computer
     users and telephone companies alike.

NORTHWESTERN BELL'S CAROLINE:

       About a year ago, Caroline was restructed to be better postioned to
capture residential marketing.  A five-feature package billed at 10$ per month
was trimmed to three basic features - call hold, call transfer and conference
(three-way) calling -- and priced more affordably at 5$ monthly.

       CaroLine Features:

* Call Hold - Besides putting a caller on hold, it can also be used to hang
              up a phone and use an extension in another room without losing
              the caller.

* Call Transfer - Allows transfer of a call in progress to another line.

* Conference Calling - Allows third party to be added to a a conversation.

* Call Pick-Up - Allows a customer with two or more lines to answer from any
                 phone.

* Call waiting - Signals a second call and enables customer to put first caller
                 on hold.

* Call forwarding - Enables a customer to route incoming calls to another line.

* Convenience dialing - Also known as speed calling, enables one and two-digit
                        dialing.

* Alternate Answer - Enables users to prearrange calls coming in on one line
                     to automatically transfer to another ine after a specific
                     number of rings, or when a busy signal is engaged.

* Intra-Call - Enables customers to dail extensions.

       All of these CaroLine Features require only one peice of hardware...
Your Standard Bell Telephone.

CONTEL MERGER:

       Contel Corp., with 2.3 million telephone customers in 30 states,
announced this week it will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Communications
Satellite Corp., under a stock swap merger agreement.  The merger is expected
to be complete next year.

  ============================================================================

CALLING CARDS TERMED 'DISCRIMINATORY':

       The Department of Justice (DOJ) notified the seven regional Bell
operating companies (BOCs) July 5 that it is investigating that
advertising and use of calling cards issued  by their telephone company
subsidiaries for interexchanging service.
       The department's concern is that BOCs may be in violation of the
Modified Final Judgment because interexchange calls can be charged to their
cards only if the calls are carried by AT&T.  It said the same billing
arrangements are not available to other competing carriers.

       The DOJ noted that this discrimination "appears to have been an
unavoidable consequence of allowing AT&T and the Bocs to share a credit card
data base" at the time of divesture and the BOCs are in the process of
developing their own data bases.
       The DOJ has ordered that the BOCs immediately cease advertising and
promotion of their calling cards for interexchange calling; notify calling
card customers that the cards are intended only for interexchange calling; and
also notify them that such calls are completed by AT&T even if the customer
has presubscribed to another carrier.
       Bell has issued over 21 million calling cards in it's 7 Regional Bell
Operating Companies.

  ============================================================================

RESTRICTIONS ON AUTOMATIC DIALING DEVICES:

       Your chances of being awakened by a computerized sales call will be
substantially reduced after August 1.  A bill which places restrictions on
telemarketers using prerecorded or synthesized voice messages makes such calls
illegal before 9 am and after 9 pm.
       The bill also requires that such devices disconnect within 10 seconds
after the phone is hung up and specifies that the message cannot be delivered
unless information about the caller and the purpose of the call is first
provided by a live operator.

Bill H.F. 124 & S.F. 184

*BUSTED AT LAST:  THE SENSEI OF THE SYNDICATE REPORT:*

      "This may be the very last article I will write.  A complete write up
will also be released."

      Well, I finally got the axe from Bell.  From all the years of loyal
service I've given them, they were forced to finally take action.  I won't
say to much, I'm still bummed out from the visit from Capital Police.  I'm
typing this hours from the actual visit, since I don't think I'll be having
my computer/modems etc., much longer.

       It all started on a Unix system in the 415.  I don't know how they got
to me all the way from Calif., but they did.  I must have tripped an alarm, I'm
guessing.  Anyways, I'm giving this to a friend, and he'll probably leave it on
Brewery or Freeworld ][ Private (301-668-7657).  I don't want all my accounts
deleted right away from any System Operator reading this...I may be pay for a
call here and there to keep in touch.  Mainly I'll keep it to a few select
systems, until I find a new way of calling LD without worry of traces.  My
complete story I'd like to submit to Phrack Inc.  To get in touch with me call
my home line if you know it, or 612-829-8503 or 8504.

       Oh, they told me to get a new hobby, so I took up a new language.

                 Have a good one,
