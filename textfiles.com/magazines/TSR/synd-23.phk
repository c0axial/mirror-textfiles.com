    EDITOR'S NOTE:                                                      TSR

    TSR  #23,  late  as  usual.   Sorry, once again - life is testing me in
    many ways, that's why this issue is over a month  late.   This  apology
    goes  mainly  to 'contributing writers,' for their help in this Report.
    Reasons: Like I said, I've been busy, and most of the information  here
    is (unlikeusual) written by others.  A lot of the info. is from locals,
    and users that call Radio Waves System, since I've not been calling the
    usual systems lately.  I'm not going to go into a specific topic for my
    Editorial  this  issue,  instead  I'll  just  outline  a  few things of
    interest.  Just a quick note: Abbie  Hoffman,  author  of  "Steal  this
    Book" "Steal this Urine Test." and other books, is DEAD.  I heard about
    it on the news a whileback, approx 1.5 months ago, but I didn't get all
    the specifics.  From what I know he over dosed.  Now he's a legend.  PC
    Pursuit.  The  format change is complete, and all the old passwords are
    dead. June 1st was supposed to be  the  cut  off  date,  I  guess  they
    finally  did  something  on  time.   If  anyone  is still using the old
    format, it's probably  the  new  format.   I  haven't  heard  too  much
    information  on  the  new format(s), butthere has been talk of 20 to 30
    different formats used by  PCP.   Although  new  formats  can  be  made
    swiftly and easily to accomodate any abuse.  Good luck.

    The  4.6  trillion  chance  of  hacking  a  PCP  code is over, now it's
    justabout impossible.  The only codes you will see  now  are  the  ones
    hackers  have tapped from the "INSIDE of PCP." In TSR #23, Part II, I'm
    going to copy a letter I received from a guy in England. ;The Sensei  /

    PHREAK TOOLS V1.1 - REMAKE OF CNA/L LISTER:               TSR (p.f 5\5)

    Ever get tired of looking up out-dated CNA listings in text  files?  Or
    did  you ever wondered WHO own what prefix on an 1-800/900 exchange? If
    you have these problems, then check out  PHREAK  TOOLS  V1.1,  formerly
    called CNA/L Finder or Lister.  Professor Falken, of Minnesota 612, has
    reformatted this CNA/L Lister, and renamed it to fit its style.  Here's
    Falken's  latest information about Phreak Tools: "It has a 800/900 WATS
    Exchange Reverse Directory and a built in CNAfinder in it.  The 800/900
    directory, all you do is tell it what exchange youneed and it will tell
    you who owns it, and from that you should be able to  tell  if  it's  a
    safe  exchange.  The CNA program is the same as the current stand-alone
    version, however, all new releases of Automated CNA Finder will  be  in
    Phreak  Tools Versions 1.x+ New features to be in upcoming versions are
    newer CNA list, with ID codes.  Area code/Country code  finder,  and  a
    950  port  directory listing." (Sent via Radio Waves mail).  The latest
    version has some hard to get information,  and  can  be  found  onRadio
    Waves  BBS  at  (612)  471-0060, and the 203 area.  Currently, only IBM
    version 1.1 is available. There has been no  further  information  from
    Falken,  or  Twisted  Sector, 408 California, about an Apple version of
    Phreak Tools/CNA Lister.  News about this in future TSRs, or  on  Radio
    Waves (RW/TSR)

          The Author will be taking suggestions, and questions on RW.

    RADIO WTSP HACKER CHARGED WITH COMPUTER TAMPERING:      TSR (5\11 ny.t)

    Michael I.  Shapiro and Terry L. Cole, former news executives of WTSP,a
    Florida  television  station  in  the  Tampa  area,  are  charged  with
    illegally  entering  the  computer  system  of   a   rival   television
    station.Christian  Hoyer,  an  assistant state attorney in Hillsborough
    County, who is prosecuting the case, says  that  Shapiro,  working  for
    WTSP,  Channel  10,  had previously worked for a rival station, Channel
    13.   Shapiro  is  chargedwith  using  his  own  microcomputer  and   a
    microcomputer  at  Channel 10 to break into Channel 13's news computer,
    possibly seeking a competitive advantage for  Channel  10's  newscasts.
    The case is unusual because it involves 'media espionage.'

    THE "950" BUSTS:                                          TSR (usr 5\9)

    A   bust  recently  went  down,  May  3rd,  1989.   It's  called  "Beta
    Cygnus,"which is in the  602  area  code,  address  602-234-3376.   The
    Sysop,  Mastermind,  did  something very foolish to get caught.  That's
    right, he was hacking 950-1001 and was caught.   At  the  time  of  his
    arrest/capture the attorney general of Arizona had ordered a DNR on his
    line,  consequently,  a  listing  of  all  callsgoing to/from his board
    number were captured by the Feds.   Mastermind's  system  and  hardrive
    etc..was  retrieved  INTACT.  Mastermind also kept all INFO-FORMS handy
    and  un-censored.   So  if  you  wereon  the  board,  and   left   some
    confidential information in the information form, the Feds have it now.
    Several  other  602 boards went down due to the NEWS, Temple of Doom is
    down, and the HD is nuked.  Valhalla Island did the same.

    * More busts are expected to come,  since  the  attorney  general  made
                            inferences to others. *

    HACKER STEREOTYPES AND STATISTICS:                           TSR (5\19)

    Computer  hackers  have  broken  out  of  their  old  stereotypes.  The
    information necessary to commit computer  crime  is  spreading  rapidly
    through  the  population  as  computers  are becoming easier to access.
    According to a recent report  published  by  the  National  Center  for
    Computer  Crime  Data  (NCCCD),  32  percent of the people arrested for
    computer crimes are women, 43 percent are minorities and 67 percent are
    between the ages of 21 and 35. Former and  current  employees  are  far
    more  likely  to  breach a company's computer than someone from outside
    the company. Seventy percent of all computer crimes involve  the  theft
    of  money  or  services.  The NCCCD estimates that computer crimes cost
    the US $555 million in 1988. Also, 15 computer-years were lost in  down
    time  and  930 man-years were spent detecting and removing viruses. The
    arrest of computer criminals and the laws concerning them are examined.

    // Drowning Hackers //                                      (3\0 d.log)

    Computer security is threatened by  the  nature  of  a  computer's  own
    configuration,   especially   stationary  networks.  Hackers  have  the
    advantage of surprise and a global entry capability.  Several  security
    measures  are  available  to  deter unauthorized entry into data files,
    although no computer is completely safe from intrusion. 'Drowning' is a
    method that hides important information within data  that  is  actually
    garbage  and  not  useful.  Cost-benefit factors come into play when it
    takes more time to sort through files than the sought after information
    is worth to begin with. 'Traps' are programs that engage intruders in a
    dialogue while the system is being invaded.  Meanwhile  the  hacker  is
    being tracked down by the computer's security system.

    // FBI Haunted by West German Hackers //                    (3\0 d.log)

    Inattention  in pursuing a widely publicized 1988 computer hacking case
    involving Marcus Hess is coming back to haunt the FBI, as  West  German
    authorities  arrested  Hess,  along  with  several  other  hackers, for
    allegedly giving computer information to the Soviets. Hess had  earlier
    been  identified  as  being involved in the penetration of more than 30
    computers at  US  research  laboratories,  military  installations  and
    defense  contractors.  US  Air  Force  Office  of Special Investigation
    assistant chief of computer crime, Jim Christy, says that the  FBI  has
    been  embarrassed  into  more actively pursuing computer crime and that
    the Hess case is a catalyst that has engendered an understanding of the
    threat.

       Dear Sensei,

       Hello,  as  you can see, I live about 4200 miles away from you hence
    this letter, I'll try to keep it short.

       I know that you have, or had a C128 with a Volks 300-1200  modem,  I
    have  a Atmos 48k with D/D and a Voyager 11 modem, giving 1200/1200 and
    300/300 baud. I am not 'on-line' at the moment, due to  some  technical
    problem with my cable, but when I am my password is 'xxxx'.

       Tell  me  now  if  you  can,  have you heard of a piece of equipment
    called a 'phreaker', there is a great lack of information  'over  hear'
    regarding this machine, but apparently it aids you in your phone bills.

       With the limited knowledge available to me, I know your "Bell-Phone"
    system  works  on  the 'two-phase' method, this would cause only slight
    problems in altering one or two of the part numbers.

       If you do know about this machine, I would be greatful to you if you
    could let me have details about its construction, part numbers each.

       Awair as I am that there will be some  cost  involved,  I  am  quite
    prepared  to respond with an agreed 'fee' for any and all information I
    can get.  Should you be able to send this machine to me via  air  mail,
    or  boat,  this  would prove expenceive from this end, and so I think a
    diagramm with part numbers, the best option.

       Anyway Sensei, I seem to be 'rabbiting' a bit, so I think I'll close
    now, iff youcan get some free time, would you simply 'drop me  a  line'
    to say that you have received my letter.

    Many thanks.

       Yours sincerely,

       John Doe

       Interesting,  eh?   When  I  first  read  this, I laughed.  This guy
    thinks a 'phreaker' is a machine.  I thought it was a person.  Well,  I
    tried to call the guy with the number, via MCI (love that service), and
    I  got  no  answer.   Back  in  '86 about this time, there was a lot of
    paranoia about busts.  I thought this was some guy from England  trying
    to find out about phreaking, thus do some busting or whatever.  I never
    responded.

       Some  of my readers are overseas, so if this person is reading this,
    write me again.  I'm not sure how this person got all  the  information
    about  me then.  I did have a C128, with other computers.  Maybe it was
    an overseas commie system.  Who knows.

       These types of responses are rare -- via  USPS.   Usually  it's  all
    through  networking/email  etc.   But  I'm  thinking  about  posting  a
    READER'S RESPONSE COLLUMN in future  TSRs.   I  do  get  many  bits  of
    information  from  the readers, so if I get a lot on a particular month
    -- I'll post more.  Send those responses in!  Via Radio Waves.

              THE CT2 PHONE - ANOTHER ABUSE PRODUCT: TSR (p.f 5/5)

    British  Telecom,  has  made  a  cordless phone that's really portable.
    It's called the CT2 and weighs only 2.7 ounces.  You bring it with  you
    wherever you go, and when you are within reach of one of the base units
    popularly   called   "  PhonePoints  ",  you  can  make  calls.   These
    PhonePoints/base units are permanently installed at  popular  locations
    such  as  airports,  bus/train  stations,  shopping  malls, and grocery
    stores.  The CT2 is expected  to  cost  about  as  much  as  a  regular
    phortress  phone call ($0.25), which makes it much more affordable than
    a cellular phone.

     The CT2's base unit has a range of 200 meters from its antennae.   The
    technology  is  based  on  ISDN ( Integrated Services Digital Network )
    instead of the current  analog  technology.   The  CT2  works  in  this
    matter,  1)  Once  you are in range of any of the CT2's base units (200
    meters) you turn the phone to the TALK position. 2) At  this  time  the
    telephone  scans  the 40 channels designated for it's use. The channels
    are in the 864 Mhz to 868 Mhz range, which is a step above the  current
    Cellular  frequencies (810 Mhz to 830 Mhz).  3) The phone sends out its
    owners  billing  information  and  authorization  code  etc.   4)   The
    PhonePoint  checks  the  users  billing info and ID code with a central
    computer, and if everything matches up, you get a dialtone.

                              :::: THE ABUSE ::::

    The process of scanning and locking onto the first available  frequency
    is  called FDMA ( frequency division multiple access ), British Telecom
    claims this " avoids the  cross-talk  interference  "  common  in  most
    cellular phones currently.  The PhonePoint/CT2 system is to be deployed
    sometime  within the next 2 years, for an approximate price of $275 per
    phone & access fees. At this time, it makes  me  wonder  if  they  will
    encrypt  the  data  going  back & forth.  If not, they could have major
    abuse to the system, just think what a person with a  portable  scanner
    could  do?  All he'd have to do is scan the 860 Mhz range and listen to
    peoples billing info and/or conversations,  the  information  gathering
    possibilities are unlimited.

    VIRUS OUTBREAKS SPUR CONGRESS TO COMBAT THREAT TSR           (i.w. 6\9)

    Concerned  by  press  reports  and  stung by its own outbreak, The U.S.
    Congress has begun talking about ways to combat computer viruses.

    FBI Director William Sessions warned last week that no current statutes
    specifically  address  viruses,  particularly  those  where  damage  is
    limited  to  lost  time  instead  of  data  and where the virus maker's
    motive is unclear.

    "Viruses are easy to create and propagate,  require  little  expertise,
    and  may  by nearly impossible to prevent or detect," Sessions told the
    Senate on Technology and the Law.

    Sessions said the FBI  is  developing  behavior  profiles  of  computer
    hackers  in an effort to combat viruses but noted that the FBI has only
    conducted two criminal investigations of viruses so far. [ TS  here  --
    Only  two  cases?   Damn,  I thought the FBI was a little more informed
    about viruses than that!  One almost pulls down an entire network, yet,
    no one on their staff can understand one completely.  So, all you virus
    spreadors better get hopping before the law strikes back. ]

    Bill  introduced  is called the Computer Virus Eradication Act of 1989.
    By Wally Herger of Calif.

    The  reason,  according  to  Herger's  press  secretary Mahan, is three
    different House offices were infected by a  virus  through  a  computer
    bulletin  board  network  shortly before an earlier version of Herger's
    bill was introduced in May 1988.

    If   viruses  persist,  "out  networks  could  be  consumed  by  mutual
    suspicion,"   testified   Clifford   Stoll,   a   scientist   at    the
    Harvard-Smithsonian   Center   for  Astrophysics  in  Cambridge,  Mass.
    "Networks could become so bureaucratic no one could use them  anymore,"
    he  said.   "Cleaning  up  after viruses may be cheaper than preventing
    them." Stoll helped track down a West  German  hacker  who  broke  into
    various unclassified military computer in this country.  "Catching this
    spy  took  over  a  year  of full-time effort," he said.  "While he was
    reaching into out computer, I lost a year of astronomy research.   Much
    worse, a thief was stealing information from out nation's computers."

    [  What,  was he required to track this guy down for an entire year?  I
    really feel sorry for him.  He could have just  asked  some  local  BBS
    kids -- he would have gotten further, quicker.  -TS ]

    HOW TO BECOME A SYNDICATE REPORT                         TSR (tsr 6\13)
    SUPPORT BULLETIN BOARD SYSTEM:

    At  the  end  of each TSR Information Transmittal, you'll see a message
    something like...

    "TSR will accept additional sponsor/support  Systems.  If  you  have  a
    certain  interest  in the Report, and wish to provide support to TSR --
    Leave your BBS number -- and  any  other  information  on  RADIO  WAVES
    Bulletin Board Systems."

    Many  users/sysops,  after  reading TSRs, ask, "How can I (or whomever)
    become a TSR Support BBS"?  Well, knowing that not everyone reads every
    bit of data in a magazine, I'll write about in now. This article has  a
    heading  at  the beginning of TSR and some substantial space, so people
    should understand now.

    Number one, if you like The Syndicate Report, you're already  half  way
    to  having a TSR support system.  When I look over possible TSR support
    BBSs, I look for what interests me in the BBS.  It should favor certain
    hobbyists such as: hackers, phreaks, pirates, thrashers, etc.   If  you
    don't  you  might  as well forget it -- since I probably won't call the
    system anyway to upload it regularly, nor anyone else.

    But,  if  you   have   those   qualities   with   a   good   piece   of
    software/hardware,  then just leave your phone number and BBS name, and
    any  login/new  user  info  to  me  in  feedback/mail  on  Radio  Waves
    612-471-0060.  I'll reply back to you within a few days, no longer than
    a week.  In that time, I'll probably be checking out your system.

    Most of the systems that do support TSR are ones that I've been calling
    for a while, and I've picked.

    What  I  usually require a BBS to have, is a transfer area dedicated to
    The Syndicate Report for easy up/downloading.  Also,  if  there  is  an
    intense  demand, a sub-board may erect.  Usually sub-boards only appear
    on highly active hack orientated systems.

    So, if you wish to become a TSR support BBS, get a hold on me and leave
    any BBS information.  Thank you for your support.

    CREDIT CARD FRAUD; OLD TECHNIQUES STILL WORK:           TSR (strs 6\13)

    Credit  card  fraud  is  doing  very  nicely,  thank you.  And, in some
    degree, that is a result of poor retail procedures and  policies,  says
    Limited Credit Services, Inc.  and U.S. Secret Service agent Perry.

    One  of  the  most serious internal fraud problems retailers are facing
    has not abated over the last several years.  Or, as  the  SS  puts  it:
    "The  Nigerians  are still alive an well.  I hate to keep beating up on
    them, but they're responsible, probably, for about 50%  of  everybody's
    fraud."

    The Assoc. of Credit Card Investigators' latest bulletin states: 'There
    are  now an estimated 30k to 50k Nigerians in the U.S. and an estimated
    75% to 90% of this group participates in fraudulent activity.' "

    The security asserts: "It is amazing they have changed their techniques
    very little and are still able to get away with  it."  They're  getting
    away  with  it  to  a  large  extent  by  going  into establishments as
    employees. Especially in the personnel departments -- that's where they
    want to work.  They can get access to the information and  they're  off
    to  the races.  Employers assume they put these people into entry level
    jobs and they're not going to do anything. But they want  entry  level,
    low  profile  jobs,  like  a factory environment, almost.  And a lot of
    credit card operations are like factory environments. One  they're  in,
    keying  in payments, for example, they have the customer's back account
    number, where the checks  are  drawn.   Most  of  the  time  there's  a
    statement  header  that says what the person's credit line is, what the
    balance is.

    Telecommunications  advances  are  helping  Pizza  Hut  deliver  pizzas
    faster.  National  Telecom's  Automatic Call Distributor allows several
    shops  in  an  area  use  a  single   number.    Incoming   calls   are
    automatically  routed  to  the shop nearest the caller's location.  The
    system also features management information capability,  helping  store

    Telecommunications  industry  experts  estimate  that 10 percent of all
    American homes will be connected by fiber optics in the year  2001.   A
    University  of  Southern  California  survey reported in Communications
    Week's current issue predicted 10 million  Americans  work  from  their
    homes  in  2001 and would need the communications capability offered by
    fiber optics.

    United  Kingdom  companies  have  no  laws   to   protect   them   from
    unauthorized   access   to  computer  files.  Existing  laws  refer  to
    fraudulent tampering with programs. Proposals for new legislation  from
    the Scottish and English Law Commissions are not expected to change the
    situation  in  the next two years. Two communications tappers who broke
    into the Duke of  Edinburgh's  mailbox  on  British  Telecom's  Prestel
    service have been fined 1,350 pounds sterling for electronic forgery.
