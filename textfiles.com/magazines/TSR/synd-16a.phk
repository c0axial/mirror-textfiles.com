PCS AND PHONE COMPANIES NOT IDEAL COUPLES:                                 TSR

       WHEN THE SEVEN REGIONAL BELL PHONE CO'S WERE FIRST ALLOWED TO FLEX
THEIR MUSCLES, COMPUTER STORES LOOKED LIKE A GREAT OPORTUNITY. BUT NOT THE
BABY BELL'S EXPERIMENTS IN COMPUTER RETAIING LOOK LIKE AN EXPENSIVE LESSON IN
FREE ENTERPRISE.  BELL ATLANTIC CORP. IS CLOSING 24 OF ITS 40 REMAINING
COMPUSHOP INC. STORES -- ATER SHUTTERING 27 A YEAR AGO -- AND LAYING OFF 30%
OF ITS COMPUTER SALES FORCE.  NYNEX CORP., WHICH BUILT A 92-STORE CHAIN
LARGELY BY ACQUIRING 81 FORMER INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORP. OUTLETS,
IT TELLING ANALYSISTS THAT, AFTER THREE YEARS, ITS STORES WILL FINALLY BREAK
EVEN IN THE FOURTH QUARTER.

JAPAN IS GETTING A TRULY SMART CREDIT CARD:                                TSR

       VISA INTERNATIONAL HAS PLANS TO EST 2,00 SUPERSMART CREDIT CARDS IN
JAPAN NEXT FALL.  IF ALL GOES WILL, FULL-SCALE PRODUCTION COULD BEGIN IN 1990.
       THECARDS LOOKS LIKE A CREDITCARD ONT THE FRONT.  ON THE BACK, IT LOOKS
LIKE A CALCULATOR.  INSIDE, IT HAS THE SMARTS OF A PORTABLE COMPUTER,
INCLUDING A MICROPOCESSOR AND MEMORY.  WHEN A PURCHASE IS MADE, THE AMOUNT OF
THE TRANSACTION PLUS AN IDENTIFICATION CODE MUST BE ENTERED.  IF ALL IS IN
ORDER, THE CARD AUTHORIZES THE PURCHASE AND RECORDS THE NEW BALANCE IN ITS
MEMORY.  TOSHIBA CORP., WHICH WILL MAKE THE CARDS, IS TESTING THE CARD WITH
VISA AND NT&T, NIPPON TELEGRAPH & TELEPHONE CORP.  NT&T HAS PLANS TO INSTALL
PHONES THAT LET THE CARD WORK AS AN AUTOMATIC DIALER.

...VISA USA TAKES TO THE AIRWAVES TO NAIL THIEVES:                         TSR

       IN THE US, VISA USA INC. IS EXPERIMENTING WITH ANOTHER TECHNOLOGY:
TRANSMITTING DATA VIA FM RADIO WAVES.  USING SERVICES AND EQUIPMENT SUPPLIED BY
INDESYS INC. IN SUNNYVALE, CALIF., VISA IS TESTING A SYSTEM FOR SENDING
RETAILERS INFORMATION ABOUT STOLEN OR INVALID CREDIT CARDS.  IN SOME STORES,
THE SYSTEM COULD PLACE THE PRINTED LISTS OF FRAUDULENT AND STOLEN CARD NUMBERS
THAT VISA NOW ISTRIBUTES EVERY WEEK OR TWO.

       HERE'S HOW IT WORKS:  VISA SENDS A NIGHTLY UPDATE TO ITS CREDIT CARD
DATA  BASE TO INDESYS HEADQUARTERS, WHICH THEN RELAYS THE DATA TO COMMMERCIAL
RADIO STATIONS FOR BROADCASTING.  EACH STORE HAS A INDESYS RADIO RECEIVER
ATTACHED TOA  PERSONNAL COMPUTER.  ONCE THE DATA ARE IN THE COMPUTER, A CLERK
CAN USE AN ELECTRONIC SCANNER TO READ A CREDIT CARD NUMBER, WHICH IS THEN
CHECKED AGAINST THE DATA BASE.

NJ BELL TESTS SERVICE THAT DISPLATS INCOMING CALLS:                        TSR

NEWARK, N.J. - LOCAL TELEPHONE CUSTOMERS IN NEW JERSEY WILL BE ABLE
TO SCREEN THEIR INCOMING CALLS IN A CONTROVERSIAL TEST BY NEW JERSEY
BELL TELEPHONE CO., BEGINNING IN EARLY NOVEMBER.
     THE NEW JERSEY BOARD OF PUBLIC UTILITIES RECENTLY GRANTED THE
BELL OPERATING COMPANY PERSMISSION TO TEST A PACKAGE OF CALL
MANAGEMENT SERVICES ON ABOUT 250,000 LOCAL CUSTOMERS.

     THE TEST WILL OCCUR IN SIX EXCHANGE AREAS IN ATLANTIC AND HUDSON
COUNTIES TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE SERVICES, CALL CLASS, SHOULD BE
OFFERED STATEWIDE.  THE EXPERIMENT IS SCHEDULED TO LAST UNTIL
SEPTEMBER 1989.
     NEW JERSEY BELL ORIGINALLY SOUGHT PERMISSION TO TEST CLASS LAST
NOVEMBER, BUT WITHDREW THE PROPOSAL IN MARCH FOR FURTHER STUDY. THE
TELEPHONE COMPANY HAS SAID THE DELAY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH
OPPOSITION TO ONE OF THE CLASS SERVICES, CALLED CALL IDENTIFICATION.

     CALL IDENTIFICATION WOULD LET USERS WITH SPECIAL DISPLAY
ATTACHMENTS VIEW THE NUMBER OF THE PERSON PLACING THE INCOMING CALL.
THAT WOULD ENABLE THE ANSWERING PARTY TO DECIDE WHETHER TO TAKE THE
CALL.
     ANOTHER CLASS SERVICE, CALL TRACE, LETS CUSTOMERS HAVE THE PHONE
COMPANY TRACE A CALL - BUT ONLY FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT PURPOSES - BY
HANGING UP ON THE CALL AND DIALING PRESCRIBED DIGITS.

     OTHER SERVICES GROUPED UNDER CLASS INCLUDE THE ABILITY TO LET
CUSTOMERS DIAL BACK THE LAST INCOMING CALL WHETHER OR NOT THE USER
ANSWERED IT; RE-DIAL THE LAST OUTGOING CALL; KEY IN UP TO SIX
'PRIORITY' NUMBERS THAT WILL GIVE A DISTINCTIVE RING ON IMPORTANT
CALLS; BLOCK UNWANTED CALLS; AND FORWARD CALLS.
     EXCEPTING CALL IDENTIFICATION AND CALL TRACE, CLASS WILL COST
RESIDENTIAL USERS $4 PER MONTH FOR THE FIRST SERVICE AND $1.50 PER
MONTH FOR EACH ADDITIONAL SERVICE.

     CALL IDENTIFICATION WILL COST $6.50 PER MONTH FOR RESIDENTIAL
CUSTOMERS AND $8.50 PER MONTH FOR BUSINESS USERS.  THE DISPLAY
ATTACHMENT, ABOUT $65, IS EXPECTED AT ELECTRONICS STORES SOMETIME
THIS FALL.

WANG & ITT CONSIDERED MERGER:                                              TSR

  WANG LABORATORIES INC. AND ITT CORP. APPARENTLY HELD SECRET TALKS ABOUT A
POSSIBLE MERGER TWO YEARS AGO WHEN ITT WAS UNDER ATTACK BY CORPORATE RAIDERS.
NOTHING CAME OF THE TALKS, THOUGH, REPORTEDLY BECAUSE WANG WANTED TO MAINTAIN
CONTROL OF THE COMBINED COMPANIES.
  THAT'S STORY SOURCES SAY WILL BE REPORTED IN A NEW BOOK CALLED 'TUMULTUOUS
YEARS: A PERSONAL ACCOUNT OF THE REBUILDING OF ITT,' BY ITT CHAIRMAN RAND V.
ARASKOG.
  TO THE BOSTON GLOBE, WANG SPOKESMAN PAUL HENNING HAS CONFIRMED THAT COMPANY
FOUNDER AN WANG HELD THE DISCUSSIONS WITH ARASKOG IN 1985, CALLING THE TALKS
'GENERAL IN NATURE AND CORDIAL' BUT ADDING THEY 'RESULTED IN NO SUBSTANTIVE
AGREEMENTS.'
  THE GLOBE REPORTS THAT ARASKOG'S BOOK, TO BE PUBLISHED BY HENRY HOLT INC. OF
NEW YORK, ALSO DISCLOSES SIMILAR TALKS WITH OTHER COMPANIES.

PACTEL PROPOSES DEFINITION FOR BELL INFORMATION SERVICES:                  TSR

  PACIFIC TELESIS GROUP HAS PROPOSED A DEFINITION THAT WOULD ALLOW BELL
REGIONAL HOLDING COMPANIES TO PROVIDE CERTAIN TYPES OF INFORMATION SERVICES
THAT DO NOT SUBSTANTIALLY CHANGE THE CONTENT OF INFORMATION SENT AND RECEIVED
BY OTHER PARTIES.
  THE CALIFORNIA TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY FILED THE DEFINITION CHANGE, WHICH
WAS ORDERED BY THE COURTS ON SEPTEMBER 10, TO LIFT CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON
INFORMATION SERVICES IMPOSED ON THE REGIONAL HOLDING COMPANIES UNDER THE
CONSENT DECREE THAT BROKE UP AT&T IN 1984. AT THAT TIME THE COURT INDICATED
THAT THE REGIONAL HOLDING COMPANIES MAY PROVIDE 'TRANSMISSION-TYPE' INFORMATION
SERVICES BUT NOT 'CONTENT-RELATED' SERVICES.

  THE PACIFIC TELESIS PROPOSAL CONSIDERS THAT TRANSMISSION-TYPE INFORMATION
SERVICES INCLUDE 'TRANSFORMING, PROCESSING, GUIDING, STORING OR RETRIEVING
INFORMATION IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION, PROVIDED SUCH
ACTIVITIES DO NOT SUBSTANTIALLY ALTER THE CONTENT OF THE INFORMATION AS SENT
AND RECEIVED.'
  ACCORDING TO PACIFIC TELESIS, THESE SERVICES MAY ALSO PROVIDE INTRODUCTORY
INFORMATION CONTENT SERVICES, BILLING AND COLLECTION SERVICES FOR INFORMATION
SERVICE PROVIDERS AND PROVIDING FOR THE ELECTRONIC DELIVERY OF DIRECTORY
SERVICES WHICH MIGHT INCLUDE A LIST OF GENERAL PRODUCT AND BUSINESS CATEGORIES,
SERVICE OR PRODUCT PROVIDERS UNDER THESE CATEGORIES AND THEIR NAMES, TELEPHONE
NUMBERS AND ADDRESSES. THIS DEFINITION, NOTED PACIFIC TELESIS, ALLOWS FOR
CHANGES IN THE FORM OF TRANSMITTED MESSAGES, BUT IN KEEPING WITH THE COURT'S
INTENT, DOESN'T ALLOW FOR SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES TO THE CONTENT OF MESSAGES.

  'BY DESIGN, THE SCOPE OF THE PROPOSED DEFINITION IS QUITE BROAD. WE FEEL IT
MUST BE FRAMED IN THESE TERMS TO ACCOMMODATE RAPID CHANGES IN INDUSTRY
TECHNOLOGY AND THE MARKETPLACE AND, ABOVE ALL, TO ALLOW FOR EASY AND EFFICIENT
COMMUNICATION BETWEEN INFORMATION SERVICES PROVIDERS AND CONSUMERS,' SAID
ARTHUR C. LATNO JR., PACIFIC TELESIS' EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT. 'OUR DEFINITION
WOULD ALLOW THE RHCS TO OFFER CONSUMERS ACCESS TO AUDIOTEX AND VIDEOTEX
SERVICES AND A VARIETY OF INFORMATION DATABASES.'
  THE PROPOSED CHANGES SUBMITTED TO THE COURT WILL BE CONSIDERED ALONG WITH
OTHER COMMENTS FROM INTERESTED PARTIES. IT'S NOT KNOWN WHEN THE COURT WILL
ISSUE A DECISION.

TSR EDITOR GETS VISIT FROM LOCAL VMS OFFICIALS:                            TSR

       THAT'S RIGHT, THE TSR EDITOR IN THE TITLE DEFINATELY DOES SYMBOLIZE
ME...THE SENSEI.  IT'S NOT A VERY GLAMOROUS VISIT, BUT HERE'S THE STORY:  IT
WAS WEDNESDAY THE 14TH OF THIS MONTH IN OCTOBER.  JUST AFTER SCHOOL....I LOGGED
INTO MY LOCAL VMS BOXES (8504/8503 ETC) TO CHECK MESSAGES.  AFTER LOGGING IN,
I WAS SUPRISED TO HEAR I HAD NO NEW MESSAGES.  I USUALLY AVERAGED 4 NEW
MESSAGES DURING THE DAY.  WELL, I HANG UP AND SET UP THE TERMINAL PROG TO CALL
A FEW SYSTEMS.  JUST AS I PICK UP THE PHONE, MY OLDER BROTHER YELLS TO ME THAT
SOMEONE WAS HERE TO VISIT ME ABOUT MY COMPUTER.  WELL, YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT I
THOUGHT.  I WENT THROUGH THE ROUTINE OF HIDING A FEW DISKS AND FILES. I THEN
WALK UPSTAIRS TO BE GREETED BY AN OFFICIAL FROM THE CONNECTION (A LOCAL VMS/
411 PSUEDO-SERVICE.), AND AN AGENT.

       THEY WERE REALLY NICE TO ME AT FIRST.  THEY CAME UP TO SHAKE MY HAND AND
TELL ME POLITELY I WAS ON THE EDGE OF SERVING TIME FOR EDINA MINNESOTA POLICE.
UP TO 90 DAYS, OR 700.00$ FINE COULD BE BROUGHT DOWN ON MY UNDER CRIMINAL
CODE STATUE 609.89 OF COMPUTER THEFT.  THEY SAID THEY COULD HAVE TOOKEN ALL
THE PHONES IN THE HOUSE AND MY COMPUTER.  I COULDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND AT FIRST
WHY THEY HAD THE RIGHT TO TAKE MY COMPUTER.  BUT I THOUGHT TO MYSELF, THIS IS
THE GOVERNMENT...THEY DO AS THEY USUALLY WISH TO AN EXTENT.  BUT I ALSO
REMEMBERED I USED THE CONNECTION VMS TO TRANSFER MY SYNDICATE REPORT AND OTHER
FILES I MADE VIA COMPUTER.  THEY HAD NO WARRANT, BUT I WANTED TO BE AS
WELL COOPERATED AS POSSIBLE, THUS TO NOT MAKE THE SITUATION A BIG FUSS.  THEY
ASKED TO SEE THE COMPUTER SYSTEM I HAD...I SHOWED THEM GLADLY SINCE I KNEW
THERE WAS NO PROBLEM IN THAT DIRECTION. THEY ALSO TOLD ME RIGHT OFF THE BAT
THAT IF I WAS 18, I'D BE IN JAIL ETC. I WAS GLAD FOR THAT LAW.  BUT THEY ALSO
POINTED OUT ABOUT SOME 9 KIDS (UNDER AGED) GOT BUSTED VERY RECENTLY FOR CARDING
A LOAD OF ITEMS AND SENDING THEM TO A HOUSE - THE JUDGE SENTENCED THEM AS
ADULTS. THE JUDGE WENT ON BASES THAT IF THEY KIDS KNEW HOW TO DO ALL THAT,
THEN THEY WILL BE TRIED AS ADULTS. GETTING BACK, THEY THEN SHOWED ME SYNDICATE
REPORT #14 TO ME.  (NICE PRINOUT MAY I ADD)  THIS WAS THE MONTH FOR REPORT
#15 PARTS 1 AND 2, BUT I HADN'T GOTTEN AROUND TO POSTING IT ON THE VMS LINE.

       AFTER A WHILE OF BSING ON SUCH TOPICS AS: WHY DO I HACK, WRITE TSR,
SCAN SYSTEMS AND COMMIT OTHER RELATED DEEDS. I ONLY AGREED THAT YEAH, I
HACKED SYSTEMS...BUT ONLY TO EXPLORE THEM AND LEARN HOW THEY WORK - NOT TO
DESTROY.  WELL, THEY THEN PROMPTED ME THAT THE SECRET SERVICE HAD SOME OF MY
REPORTS AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED TO MUCH.

       THAT'S THE STORY.  AGAIN LIKE LAST TIME, THEY SAID THEY MAY INFORM ME IF
ANYTHING WAS TO COME OUT OF IT.  I'M NOT WORRIED FOR NOW, TILL THE 18TH BDAY
ROLLS AROUND.  ONE LAST THING, I WAS CAUGHT BY MY OWN CARELESSNESS - A FEW OF
YOU MAY HAVE AN IDEA HOW, BUT I'M NOT GOING INTO THAT.

       BECAREFUL OUT THERE.  - THE SENSEI OF THE SYNDICATE REPORT MAGAZINE.
