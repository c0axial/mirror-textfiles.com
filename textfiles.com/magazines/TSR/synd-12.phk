Exposition:

   Once again, TSReport now excepts outside sources. Anyone can write/provide
   information to the Syndicate Report. The Syndicate Report is also altering
   format.  Rather than  concentrating mainly on BELL orientated information,
   the Syndicate Report now has a more broad interest.  Thus, TSR now handles
   all types of news gatherings.

   All articles have been presented by me unless shown at the end of the
   article as the information provider(s).

  ============================================================================

Author's Note:

   Hello, and welcome to another issue of The Syndicate Report.  This is the
   12th transmittal of Report which makes it well over a year old.  I'm
   extreamly pleased by the response and support you have given toward the
   Report.  So far the Report has been going strong and will continue to.
   Although I do ask of your help on distributing the Syndicate Report.  I
   want all Telecommunicationists to enjoy some of the recent NEWS -- some
   which Phrack Inc. hasn't broadcasted.  Thanks, and enjoy.

COMPUTER FRAUD THREAT INCREASING:

       Corporations are increasingly vulnerable to computer fraud, pointing to
three factors that make such fraud difficult to prevent:  Computer--Savvy
employees, the difficulty of detection, and lucrative payoff.
       According to the SR, the increasing number of knowledgeable corporate
computer users, and their ability to access sensitive computer data through
decentralized processing and networks, contributes to the growing potential for
corporate computer fraud.

       Computer fraud is also difficult to detect, since the vast quantities of
data stored in computers make concealing a theft relatively easy.  Perpetrators
seldom leave trails to follow; numbers can be easily changed, and managers,
investors, and creditors easily deceived.
       Finally, computer fraud is often lucrative.  In reported computer frauds
the average loss is estimated by the FBI to be 600,000$ -- significantly more
than the 23,000$ average of other types of fraud.  And, stressed the report,
this is only frauds that have been identified and reported.

FCC INFORMATION TAX AHEAD:

 Hi friends,

         A terrible piece of news I just read about in the New York Times
 this morning.  The FCC just voted 4-0 to impose a $4.50 - $5.50 an HOUR
 tax on people who are using the phone system to transmit information
 across state lines.  This INCLUDES anyone hooking up to a network,
 not just people dialing out of state!!  I suppose people dialing
 into a system with access to Arpanet or even USENET might be charged
 this tax; the information services (Compuserve, etc.) are slated
 to be charged this tax as of January 1.  This is an outrageous tax
 which would squelch the burgeoning telecommunications industry,
 and is totally unjustified.  I would urge people to write letters
 to their Congressman to protest this unfair and exorbitant "information
 tax" which is based on superstition and lack of understanding of
 the telecommunications industry.

METAL SHOP PRIVATE NEWS:

       For those of you wondering what the hell happened to Metal Shop Private
Recently (Either getting a steady ringing, or Taran King)...the system is temp.
down due to legal problems TK is having.  None of the details are clear at
this point, but TK thinks the system will be back up shortly.  He also added
that the system may have a new number/location.

       He informed TSR that the legal problem has nothing to do with Phreaking
or Hacking or anything online related.  The system was taken down because it
would have only brought TK more trouble.

       Stay Tuned for more information...

BREAKING THE BOOTLEG BANDS:

       Targeting bootleg software in raids reminiscent of Elliot Ness, Canadian
authorities have effectively shut down three software rental firms and crippled
a fourth.  The software rental business is no stranger to controversy.  Rental
firms say the practice simply enables customers to test programs; the Software
Publishers Association and IBM counter that such firms violate copyright laws
by selling programs under the guise of providing preview copies.  But the
recent Canadian experience departed from traditional rental procedure:  In
those cases, the companies apparently fialed to ask for the rented software
back.  Instead, they advised customers to erase the disks after a 21-day
preview costing 10$ per program.
       When a five member legal team tried to serve a court order of the
Softsave Preview Club of Vancouver, the team was barred from entering the
premises.  Employees then taped paper over the windows to prevent the group
from peering inside.  "One employee threw a box of files and credit card charge
slops out of the upper-floor windows," recalls Tate technical support
supervisor Goepel, who participated in the raid.  "He obviously had called
someone on the phone because a guy was there ready to pick the stuff up."

       Softsave management kept the raiders out in the cold for two hours
before deciding the search could not be legally prevented.  Goepel's party
then seized cartons of charge slips and hundreds of copies of top-selling
programs.  "No country is worse than Canada for not protecting software and
for the quantity of illegal software sold.", maintains Chan, international
counsel for Ashton-Tate.  "The people of Hong Kong can't compare with the
professionalism in Canada.  Softsave had a 24-hour phone number with about 20
phones lines, and we estimated they sent out over 1000 disks a day."

DEBUT BIG SMASH:

       A new National Bell "order-by-phone" service got off to a rousing
start is most regional Bell areas.  Rogers U.S. Cable Systems of National
Bell recently became the first user in the nation of the new order-enter
technology.  And in May, the first full month the service was in use, the
cable TV firm reported that sales of its pay-per-view programs more than
doubled Bell action.
       Dialing the first five digits connects the subscriber's line with an
order-entry processor that works in conjunction with the Automatic Number
Identification feature of Bell's central offices.  The last two digits are
code number for the program and the time of day viewer wants to watch it.

  ============================================================================
This message is for members of Metal Shop Private.

Many of you may have noticed that MSP has been down the past couple of days.
Do not expect its return in the near future.  Suffice to say that Taran King is
in "trouble."  Please do NOT call him as he will not answer any questions
anyway and will not appreciate your call.  If you have to get in touch with him
for any other reason besides inquisitiveness leave email to me here, I'll pass
it along in person when I see him.

The events concerning MSP should have NO effect on SummerCon so don't worry
about that.  Thanks for your time.

Title:   SummerCon
Left by  KNIGHT LIGHTNING

Well first of all, Taran is now accepting calls on his bbs line.  Don't expect
him to tell you what happened and don't call unless you really need too (such
as SummerCOn stuff).

PS:  As of PWN 16, Lucifer 666 will be writing PWN and starting with Phrack 15,
     Control C will be distributing Phrack.

Title:   Probabilities on Phrack
Left by  MR. PEZ

 Oh, and supposedly, I'm supposed to have a Phrack Editor account on my board,
and people will be able to upload articles there.  This is after I've been
talking with Control-C and Live Wire.  Have any others heard about this?  Live
Wire has this whole plan of a "Phrack Team" in mind for tons of boards across
the nation to support and distribute Phrack.  Control C wants Phrack to have a
bigger audience (like it's not big enough already), and wants better
distributors.  Hmm.

 Anyway, I guess you can call my board, the PUB, at 313-433-3164, and talk to
these people about this.  (After SummerCon's over, grr..)
