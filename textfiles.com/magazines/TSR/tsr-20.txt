EDITOR'S NOTE:                                                             TSR
       A New-Year is upon us, 1989.  The final year of the decade.  Only
 ten more and we turn over another Century.  Just think, only a few decades back
the World had no wonderful high speed Computers, no means of Telecommunications
via Computer, and not even a fraction of the amount of data being exchange over
systems - a few decades back.  Technology will have multiplied 4 times by the
year 2000.  I for one feel like I'm still in the Dark Ages.  I'd like to be
born around the year 2100 or 2150.  Around that time, computers will be as
common as the person - and probably more valuable to an extent.
       One bad point though:  Phreaking and Hacking in the year 2100 would be
in toto termination.  In other words, suicide.  Hackers, Crackers, Breakers,
Phreakers, Terrorists - whatever you want to call'em are already talking about
the end of phreaking and hacking.  It's just a matter of time.
       You know what I really get tired of hearing?  Bad news about 2 things.
1) The United States falling apart, and 2) Phreak/Hack world crumbling.  And
WHAT did I just report as an opinion?
  "The end of the Phreak/Hack soon."  I've tried to turned myself away from
writing depressing editorial opinions, but I've learned its basically
impossible!  Something that I never find myself writing, something like:
"Hackers/Phreaks break into Government Bank and get rich...no suspects have
been found."  I'm babbling here, I'll have to edit half of this out...  On
with the Report #20.

TELENET / PCP PURSUIT PRICE HIKE:                               TSR (pc!p 1\2)
       This bit of news is probably all over the nation by now, but PCP is
hanging itself - trying to get users to pay more $$ CASH.   Here's a transcript
from the 'C PURSUIT' Telenet accessible PCP Line:
      Here is a summary of the price change:
      o    Monthly Charge.  The new fixed charge is $30 per month.
      o    Cap on  Free Usage.   Your $30 per month will now pay for up
           to 30 monthly hours of non-prime time usage.  Using the full
           30  hours  in  one  month  amounts to an hourly rate of only
           $1.00 -- more than 85% less than you would pay with the most
           popular  long  distance  discount  service.    Only  a small
           fraction of you will even be affected by this cap.
      o    Over Cap Rate.  Non-prime time usage, above the 30 hour cap,
           will be billed at $4.50 per hour, which is about half of the
           next lowest rate in the market place.
      o    Second Tier Rates.  There will  be a  second level  of rates
           for those who use the service at business levels.  When your
           total monthly usage exceeds  60 hours,  both prime  time and
           non-prime time rates will increase for those hours in excess
           of 60, as follows:
                     PRIME TIME 2nd tier rate:     $ 14.00 /hr
                     Non-Prime 2nd tier rate:      $  7.50 /hr
           ....other changes are  included, although the information is
           changing a lot - log into the PCP Via telenet to  check all
           the latest info.
    The new pricing scheme goes into effect May. 1st, raises the monthly PC
    Pursuit charge to 30$, with a limit of 30 hours of service per month for
    that price,  according to Peter Naleszkiewicz, Telenet's product manager
    for outdial services.  After 30 hours, the cost of service rises to 4.50$
    per hour, with another jump to $7.50  per hour coming at 60 hours per
    month.
                         A Note from Mr. Naleszkiewicz
    "The service was far more popular that we ever expected it to be,"
    Naleszkiewicz said.  "Thirty hours per month is significantly more than the
    average use of the service, so most users will see only a five dollar per
    month increase.  But it's not the average PC Pursuit user that concerns
    Telenet, according to Phil Sih, prez of Portal Communications CO. of
    Cupertino, Calif.  "We have a population of heavy Pursuit users on out 10$
    per month online service," Sih said.  "Some of these people are using
    Pursuit 200 to 300 hours per month.  You didn't have to be a rocket
    scientist to see this change coming."

       Well in Part Three, I will discuss a part of phone fraud you
   very rarely see used, The Outside line, How you can get it and where.
       A very interesting thing I ran upon when I was hacking around
   on a PBX. I thought, How easy would it be to get a operator to
   give you an outside line from a hospital.  In fact,  I found it to be
   very simple, this is what ya do:
       You call your nearest hospital and when the switchboard
   operator answers ask her to send you to Radiology, (Doesn't really
   matter ask for any department) And when the department you asked for
   answers, tell them that you have made a mistake and that you would
   like to be transferred to the switchboard. You then  will get sent
   back to the main switchboard but this time once the operator
   answers say, "Yes, This is Dr. Jones, I'm having trouble getting
   an outside line, Could give me an outside line please". Then most
   likely you will hear a Dial Tone!  Now you can screw everything
   up and call Alliance, or anything your heart desires.
     The reason must call and get transferred to a different department
   before asking for the outside line is that if you just
   call up and ask for an outside line, the operator will see that
   your are on a Incoming Trunk, (If you don't know what that means,
   she'll simply tell you thatyour not in the hospital, but outside)
   But you see, once you get transferred, then again transferred back
   it looks like you're inside the hospital - so, it's more of a good
   chance of getting the outside line.
     I hope this File helps you out.  Direct all questions to TSR #21/TS

INFORMATION AGE ATTACKS:                                        TSR (fbs 1\30)
       Solicitors hit you at night with so many phone solicitations that you
shelled out the extra bucks for an unlisted numbers, among other annoying
reasons.  Then they got through with random dialers.  So you bought an
answering machine.  And now they've invaded your computer and your fax machine
with junk mail.  Is there no peace?
       This is the information age that the futurists talked about, the day
when telephone technology, fax machines and electronic mail would make
communications cheap and plentiful.  Too plentiful.  Says Lotus Corp.,:
"It's a well-known phenomenon in large corporations that when you come back
from a long weekend you'll find 50 pieces of electronic mail in your mailbox,
spend hours going though it, and end up with most of it being stuff you don't
want to see."  LOTUS protects itself at home and with an unpublished telephone
number, and opts for a public electronic mail address for his computer.  Yet
the unwanted messages still come through.
       WITH THIS, we have what could perhaps be called as a "War of Access",
fought on the battleground of chips and software.  Everyone, it seems, is
screaming for your attention.  Among the callers' weapons are electronic white
pages, power dialers that can do 20k calls a day, and systems that hunt down
unpublished fax numbers.  Defensive strategies?  These include PBX switchboards
with software to route unwanted calls into answering machines and call blockers
that reject calls from specific unwanted numbers.  Tomorrow's strategies will
include software that filters out sales pitches from electronic mail by looking
for telltale words like "insurance" and "financial planner."
       While senders are spending  more to reach out, some receivers are
spending more not to be touched.  Survey Sampling, a Fairfield, Conn researched
firm, says 28% of all U.S. household have an unlisted number.  LA is 56%
unlisted.  NEW JERSEY BELL, which already charges customers $12.50 a year for
the privilege of not having their numbers published, is offering another
defense this year, CALLER ID, in some parts of its territory.  For 78.00$ a
year plus a onetime charge of 60.00$ for a readout device, a residential
customer sees the number of the caller when his phone rings.  If he recognizes
the number, he pickes up; if he doesn't, he might ignore the call or maybe let
an answering machine get it.  Then again, he can send it to the police or the
Bell company to follow up annoying charges.  This privilege, CLID, is fast
sweeping the country...and becoming a necessity for prank/obscene phone
calls.  The Northern Bell is next in line for the feature.

UNIX HACKER CAUGHT AT LLNL:                                     TSR (i.w 1\15)
       A remote caller who had repeatedly broken through the network security
at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories has been detected and contacted by
LLNL officials.
       The vulnerability of Unix networks to unauthorized intrusions has become
a serious concern at the federal level, where a number of agencies are trying
to standardize upon the use of Unix-based networks.  The concern has prompted
the establishment of a national crisis center for network break-ins, called the
Computer Emergency Response Team.
       According to an LLNL document obtained by TSR, the most recent LLNL
intruder gained access to the system by way of Internet computers at the
University of Washington and Stanford University.  Because of the remote
accessibility of these computers through e Internet, however, it is possible
that these computers were not the point of origin.  Once the intruder gained
access to the LLNL computers, he achieved "superuser" status, which permitted
access to every nonclassified file at LLNL, the document states.
       This opportunity could have resulted in widespread destruction of
unclassified data, but no files are known to have been damaged, according to
officials.  The intruder used a "cracker's dictionary" to obtain a small list
of old and existing passwords, the document states.  He also created the
capability to reenter the system by giving himself an account number and his
own password to make it appear that he was a legitimate user.
       "Our security people have been in touch with the intruder, and we have
been assured that there will be no further intrusions from that source," said
Ron Teunis, an LLNL spokesman.  Teunis also said the matter had been turned
over to the FBI for further investigation, and the intruder could be prosecuted
for federal computer-security laws.  Officials at LLNL said that fixes have
been created to guard against the particular methods used in the Dec 3rd to 10
intrusions.
       The intruder had broken into the unclassified portion of LLNL's node of
the Internet system on at least 10 occasions between December 3 and 10,
according to a document released by LLNL. The intruder exploited one of the
known weaknesses in the Unix systems running on many LLNL's computers.

... TID BITS ON BELL ...
// Bell Atlantic Offers Email //
       Bell Atlantic and Telenet Com Corp., the US Sprint data communications
company, have announced a strategic alliance that enables Bell Atlantic to
enter the email business, pending regulatory approval by the FCC.  The
agreement is the first between a regional Bell operating co and an enhanced
service provider for email service, and capitalizes on the ability of local
exchange carriers to provide information services.  Until recently, telephone
companies subject to the Modified Final Judgment, the consent decree that
resulted in the break-up of AT&T, were not allowed to provide such services.
         _____________________________________________________________

// AT&T, BellSouth Offer Cable TV //
   AT&T and BellSouth Corp. will be ushers, of sorts, for callers who want to
order specific pay-per-view cable TV programs, reports Communications Week.
The companies will use their respective equipment to furnish order-taking
services for special pay-per-view cable broadcasts, such as first-run movies or
livesporting events. Normally, cable TV phone operators handle the requests.
         _____________________________________________________________

// Phone Co's Reaching Overseas //
   The lure of overseas cable investments continues to draw the interest of U.S.
cable operators and an increasing number of telephone companies. BellSouth, Bell
Atlantic and GTE are on the prowl for foreign cable holdings, Broadcasting
magazine says. Pacific Telesis and US West already have United Kingdom holdings.

HOW TO TAP FIBER-OPTIC CABLE:                                   TSR (i.w 1\21)

       Fiber Optic networks, long touted for their immunity from snooping by
foreign governments or local competitors, no longer offer the total security
they once did, according to the experts who say that, given enough resources,
any network can now be tapped.
       "Five years ago, I would have said that FO networks were totally secure,
but that's no longer true," stated Northern Telecom.  According to Northern
Telecom, tapping a FO cable requires stripping the cable's plastic outer
sheathing and gaining access to the glass fibers within.  "When we enter a
fiber bundle, we have instruments that detect whether a given fiber is carrying
a signal before we cut it,"  North Telecom stated.  "A tap could be
accomplished in much the same way."
       Tapping an optical fiber relies on a macrobending effect.  Bending a
fiber 180 degrees around an 1/8-inch radius forces the contained light signal
to go around a tighter bend than it's capable of traversing without some loss
of light.  This light loss can be detected and, given the right equipment,
demultiplexed and decoded.
       "Our test instruments that clamps on the fiber show the escaping signal
has a 30-dB dynamic range," Telecom said.  "That's a signal level a thousand
times stronger than background noise and easily capable of being demultiplexed.
It's not an easy task, but it can be done."
       Given the reality that fiber can be tapped, Telecom said one security
effort could be to detect the 3-dB signal loss on the fiber bundle that would
typically accompany such a tapping.  "Most fiber systems have a 10-dB window
before an alarm sounds, so you either have to preattenuate the system so that a
3-dB loss causes the alarm to sound or get some finer method of measurement."
       Other security measures suggested by Telecom include the use of air-core
cables, which have pressurized air inside them.  "If they cut through the cable
to get to the fiber, air pressure is lost and an alarm sounds,"  Telecom says.
Even steel or iron pipes ought to be pressurized for true security, and anyone
who goes to the trouble of tapping fiber isn't going to be deterred by a little
iron."
       There is a significant security advantage to fiber over other media,
according to Northern Telecom.  With coax (Coaxial Cable), or twisted pair
(Normal Tele-lines), you can take the signals right out of the air.  Sure you
can tap a fiber-optic cable, but it's hard to do and fairly easy detected.
First the bad guys have to get to the cable, which is usually in a secure run,
and then they have to get the data, which is nearly always encrypted.

TOLL FRAUD LITERALLY ON THE HOME:                               TSR (z.b 1\25)
     According to Dennis E. Love, a northern California inventor and
entrepreneur, telephone utility companies throughout the United States are
unwittingly promoting telephone toll fraud by installing a new telephone line
demarcation device on all new construction and every time a service is made.
     Love said the new device has an easily accessible standard phone jack
that is located on the outside of the home and provides the opportunity for
anyone to plug in a standard telephone and make calls that would be charged to
the phone bill of the person whose phone line was attached to the new device.
     Love said he has evidence that this toll fraud is already occurring in
California and that Pacific Bell, California's largest phone utility, is
attempting to minimize the situation by denying that the problem exists.
     It should be noted that by California law, it is not against the law to
engage in this toll fraud activity.  If a person engaging in toll fraud were
caught red-handed, he could only be charged with trespassing, even if the cost
of the phone call was as great as that amount set to delineate grand theft.
the only recourse for the victim would be a civil suit.
     Love said the whole thing started when the Federal Communications
Commission deregulated portions of the telephone industry and broke up AT&T.
At that time the FCC ruled that the first standard phone jack would serve as
the demarcation point separating customer and phone utility responsibility.
     The device that the phone utilities are using, and that has been
installed on about 400,000 homes in California to date, is manufactured by
SIECOR U.S.A.  and  has a standard modular jack that serves as the first
modular jack in the house.  Unfortunately, it also provides a convenient way
to commit telephone toll fraud.
     The FCC said that the SIECOR device submitted to the FCC meets the
required specifications.  The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC),
ordered Pacific Bell to go ahead with the SIECOR device.  At that time the
CPUC had not considered the toll fraud issue in making that order.
     Love said he has developed a device, the Station Release Breaker, or SRB,
which satisfies all of the FCC requirements.  In addition, it is well
protected from the weather and does not allow for toll fraud.
     Love said he presented his device to the CPUC but has been waiting for
over two years for a decision while the SIECOR device is being installed at an
alarming rate.
     Love is currently forming a nationwide coalition, among consumer advocacy
groups, against the installation of any device that uses a modular jack
accessible to anyone that desires to use it.
     TURN, a San Francisco-based consumer group headed by Silvia Siegle, has
thrown their support in Love's corner, as has UCAN, a San Diego-based consumer
group headed by Mike Shames.

  In an effort to save the phone customers astronomical costs in toll fraud
as well as the $1.1 billion that it will cost to retrofit the state of
Calif., Love and his new-found supporters intend to file an emergency motion
with the CPUC enjoining Pacific, General, and other utilities in the state
from further installation of this "bothersome jack" until a decision is
reached by the CPUC on the toll fraud issues.
     Love said it is not important to him that his device be the one used but
that some device that allows the customers to test, diagnose, and re-establish
their own phone service without the encouragement of toll fraud be approved.
 Love asked, "What would it be like to have every home in America with a jack
on the outside so that whoever desired to do so could walk right up and plug
in?  Think about it."

CRACKER'S LOVE A CHALLENGE:                                     TSR (i.w 1\28)
     The only truly secure network is on that's locked up and physically
isolated from the rest of the world.  Short of that, "network security" becomes
a relative term rather than an absolute one -- trading off the advantage of
security against the problems it brings.  In some cases, organizations
deliberately limit the amount of system security, saying that having too much
security simply sets up a challenge for hackers.
     The organizations most likely to use such a minimalist approach are
universities.  Universities have a large number of hackers as users -- the type
of user most likely to look upon breaking through a security system as a
problem to be solved, without malicious intent.  And universities are dedicated
to spreading information and thus have a philosophical difficulty with keeping
it locked up.  While such openness is less common in a nonacademic environment,
it nevertheless exists.  "Anyone in the world can dial in and get on my
system," David Parks (AKA) Tom E Hawk who runs four BBS's California.
"The more open my systems have been, the fewer problems I've had with hackers."

MODEMS ANNEXED, ISDN IN:                                        TSR (fbs 1\30)

     When Dennis Hayes started his Atlanta-based HayesMicrocomputer Products
in 1977 on a borrowed dining room table, the future seemed boundless.  Hayes
and his partner, Dale Heatherington, spent their evenings soldering together
personal computer modems -- devices that allow computers to communicate via
telephone lines.  By 1984 privately held Hayes Microcomputer Products was
commanding 55% of the personal computer modem market, with sales of more than
100$ million.  The expression "Hayes compatible" is now as standard in the PC
modem as "IBM compatible" in the PC business.
     Hayes didn't invent modems.  They date back to the '60s, as complicated,
cranky devices that had to be taken apart and rewire every time their phone
numbers and software changed.  Hayes, who started his career installing these
models all over rural Georgia for electric utility cooperatives, knew he could
do better.  He changed data communications forever by giving users the ability
to control a modem with their software instead of a screwdriver.
     What about the danger that the so-called Integrated Services Digital
Network (ISDN) will obviate the need for modems?  Hayes swears he isn't going
to sit back and watch modems turn into the buggy whips of the 21st Century.
Instead, he is working on an ISDN circuit board that will plug into a PC,
enabling it to support a telephone call, data communications and video
transmission all at the same time.  Explains Hayes:  "Soon a modem will come to
mean any device which connects a computer to the phone line - analog or
digital."  And he expects to remain "king of modems" in the broader sense, as
he did of modems in the narrower sense.

THOMAS COVENANT CRACKED BY THE FEDERAL COMPUTER CRIME UNIT:
     Recently, about 3 weeks ago, the infamous Thomas Covenant was cracked by
the FBI Computer Crime Unit.  Apparently,the FBI caught TC completely off
guard, thus found some sensitive information including:  Hacking documents,
PW's and Accounts, and other lists of information.
     In response, Digital Logic's Data Service and Phoenix Project will down
for approximately 1-2 months to wait for the scene to blow over.  The Ronz, who
is another witnessed hacker, tells that Digital Data Logic Service (DLDS) has
been packed up and buried inside of a Nuclear Waste Dumping Ground.
     As for Phoenix Project, its been taken down, but TSR is not sure of the
total details.  Anyways, it is hoped that this bust won't take too many systems
down.  From what The Ronz says, the FBI and "other" government agencies are
going on a mass crackdown (as usual) in late January, which happens to be
happening now according to sources.  So far nothing has happened to TC, but
only time will tell...
                            -- UPDATE! ON TC BUST --
     Well about the Thomas Covenant bust, the whole ordeal is featured in
Phrack Issue #23.  Thisis the current story...
     TC was busted boxing (wire tapping) on his junction box in his apartment
basement.  He hooked into a certain line and, and he over heard a guy arguing
with his wife.  Unfortunately, this guy was a dangerous NSA (National Security
Agency) employee.  The NSA Agent had a measurable amount of equipment on his
line to detect if it was being tapped.  The NSA Agent prompted the police to
catch Thomas Covenant in the fraudulent act.  In turn, the cops turned upside
down his apartment and seized PW files and other unknown bits of information.

THE WASP - BUSTED BY FEDS
     The WASP- who was hacking government computers (Defense related items) was
caught by a line trace.  The Federal Agents picked him up along with some
highly illegal information.  The Feds were also are looking for LOD namely Lex
Luthor, and Phase Jitter relating to the bust.  Lex talked with the Feds
via code, and the air was cleared with the Feds, and with LOD.

... TID BITS ON BELL ...

// Service Tells 'Who is Ringin' //   New Jersey Bell Telephone
 has decided to offer a service that will allow customers to determine if a
phone call is for them - without picking up the phone. How to know: Different
ring patterns.  The service may start next month. Monthly fee: $4.50 for homes,
6.50$ for offices.
         _____________________________________________________________
// Service Helps Social Security //
   MCI has created an 800 toll-free number program to help the Social Security
Administration add about 6 million more beneficiaries by the 21st century. IN
magazine says the MCI Advanced 800 Service and Menu Routing Service will take
an estimated 50 million calls this year from people in the USA and Canada.
         _____________________________________________________________

// New Jersey Bell - CLID //
   New Jersey Bell is introducing Caller ID, CLID, which produces an output of
the callers Telephone Number on LCD Screens.  The customer may block out phone
prankers or annoying advertisers via CLID.  The callers get a central-office
recording telling them to buzz off.  Currently 6 calls maybe blocked at one
time only, with a price.  If a 60.00$ device can capture phone number data from
the phone line for display, another device could sit between a telephone line
and a personal computer, trapping and storing incoming phone numbers.
   Both NJ Bell, and Nynex offer are offering the services nationally.

// Frequent Fliers Phone Flagging //
   An MCI-Northwest Airlines promotion started last September "has met and
exceeded our expectations," says MCI's Brian Thompson. MCI and Northwest
offered frequent fliers one mile for every $1 of calls.  But other long-
distance companies aren't rushing in. Sprint says the company is looking into
the idea. AT&T says it has no plans for a similar program.
