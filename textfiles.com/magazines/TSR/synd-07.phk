   The Syndicate Report is stictly Bell orientated information. Without some
   background, reading in this material could cause a problem to understand.

ISDN- A PRIMER *CONTINUED*:

       Purposes & Goals:  The varying needs of modern data communications have
spawned many types of individual networking solutions -- dedicated private
networks, shared networks, and specialized networks to support tele-
conferencing, facsimile, telex, telemetry, etc.  This proliferation of
networks lacks  efficiency and cost effectiveness.  This proliferation of
networks is  near impossible.

       The purpose of the ISDN concept is to have a single network provide all
the services currently provided by individual networks. . . and do it  in such
a way that  the user is unaware of any differences.  The user  should see a
single globally-available network  serving his particular needs without  having
to worry whether a network is swtiched  or dedicated, public or private,
designed  for voice or data.

       The development of an intergrated network should be "evolutionary rather
than revolutionary" and should be based on existing transmission plant and
technology but have the capability to evolve as new technology is introduced.
The architecture must be able to accomodate change without disrupting existing
services and be capable of handling voice as well as data.

       The ultimate goal would be to make whole world accessable through world-
wide digitial capability.  Restated, an ISDN "should be able to do for data
what the telephone has done for voice".

       APPLICATIONS
       ------------

       ISDN has the potential for carrying virtually any kind of information.
Appliations range from the traditional:

       - switched telephony
       - synchronous data
       - asynchronous data
       - circuit switched data
       - packet switched data

To a variety of record communications:

       - TELEX, TWX, Teletex
       - facsimile and images
       - videotext

To a wide range of emerging and value-added services:

       - slow scan television
       - electronic mail
       - voice messaging
       - telemetry
       - electronic banking and shopping

       The potential applications are limited only by the imagination of the
vendors' marketing departments and the demands of the user community.

OPOSITION GROWS:

       MCI and U S Sprint last month supported AT&T's claim that the consent
decree prohibits the former Bell operating companies from providing operator
services for interexhange.

       The two companies filed briefs to that effect in the U.S. District Court
in Washington, D.C.

       The debate springs from an easrlier ruling by the Justice Department
which approved an Ameritech plan to offer certain operator services.  Those
services include dialing instructions, credit for service difficulties,
conference call arrangements, emergency assistance, billing for operator--
handled calls, and rate, time and charges information.

ULTRAPHONE RESCUES AREA FROM ISOLATION:

       Glendo, Wyo., claims 367 residents.  Until earlier this month, it had
no phones.
       But that was before Mountain Bell intervened, launching a trial of a new
system called Ultraphone.
       This month, the agricultural and recreational community in the east--
central part of the state boasts eight phones.  And, assuming a successful
trial, that number could signficantly grow, both in Glendo and in other areas
difficult or too costly to serve with conventional wire and cable because of
rough terrain or low population density.
       Ultraphone is an all-digital wireless radio system.  It's "heart" is
a base station, located near the telephone central office, which provides
the radio ling from the public switched network to the subscriber.  Conven-
tional telephone wires to the customer are replaced at the customer's home by
a radio antenna and a radio transreceiver.
       Because of the rough terrain in the Glendo area, a portion of the  base
station and its attenna are  located atop a ridge about  15 miles out of town.
A digital microwave  radio connection links the two portions of  the base
station.
       FCC Chairman Mark Fowler last week placed of the first Ultraphone calls,
from Washington, D.C., to a Glendo rancher.
       Fowler hailed the experiment as a significant first step in expanding
service to rural America and reinforced the FCC's commitment to universal
service.

MICE IN TRAINING:

       Mike Ordun, a researcher at Bell Communications Research, is
busy these days training MICE.  More specifically, he's teaching MICE news
tricks that someday may be among the telecommunications services every customer
uses.
       Voice dialing is the newest addition to the array of features operating
in MICE (modular integrated communications environment), an experimental
phone system now in use at Bellcore.
       With voice dialing, Ordun simply instructs his phone to "call home."
Without  being touched, the phone  automatically calls Ordun's home.
       Other MICE features being studies include synthesized voice.  Computers
with  stored-text messages can recite  over the phone network using synthesized
voice.

  ============================================================================

TELECHOICE TRIAL:

       Monday, October 27, was to have marked the start of Bell's first trial
of a new product called TELEChoice (sm).  But those plans are now indefinitely
"on hold" because of a Tuesday decision by the NPUC or National Public
Utilities Commission.

       It "dismissed without prejudice" Bell's plans for a TELEChoice market
test in various eastern states.  Basically, the commission "was not convinced
that customers need additional options and that dond a market test of this
kind would be valuable," says Product Manager Mary McFetridge.

       The commission, too, was concerned about existing issues surrounding
the products that make up TELEChoice, she says.

       TELEChoice would have allowed residence and business customers in the
trial area to sign up for "packages," make up of different type of telephone
service.  For example, the "premium" package would have included such features
as unlimited local exchange service, Custom Calling, expedited repair service,
personalized account service, and a discount on all intraLATA calls.  Less
expensive packages included fewer and less expensive features.

       The product line is currently being tested in three other U S West
locations and has been well-received by customers, days David Dockter,
assistant product manager.  "Naturally, we're eager to offer the same option
to Bell customers ans we're disappointed that we won't be able to at this
moment."

       But the door isn't totally closed on TELEChoice, notes Dockter.  The
NPUC's decision still allows local subregion Bell Companys to re-submit the
trial plan, after some revisions.  And Bell plans to approach another state
commission with the TELEChoice plan, too.

SHARKS GETTING HIGH-FIBER DIET:

       AT&T, to paraphrase its television advertising, is into sharks.  That's
because sharks are literally into fiber-optic cable.
       Sharks reportedly have bitten into AT&T submarine cable in the Spanish
Canary Islands three times since the cable was placed a year ago.

       Since AT&T plans to place the first trans-Atlantic submarine fiber--
optic cable next fall, it is beginning studies of sharks.
       Marine biologists speculate that the attacks may be caused by the
appearance or smell of marine organisms living on the cables, or by the sharks'
internal electric homing device.
