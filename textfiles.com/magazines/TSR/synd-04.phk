   The Syndicate Report is stictly Bell orientated information. Without some
   background, reading in this material could cause a problem to understand.

PRIVACY OF COMMUNICATIONS:

        In this article, I've gathered forward rules operators (that have the
ability to intercept a line) strict rules they must abide by.


        Operator Privacy Rules Are:

        - No transmission, either by voice, data, or other non-voice communi-
cation, is to be tampered with or intruded upon.
        - No conversation between customers, or transmission of data or non-
voice communication, should be listened to or monitored, nor should its
existence be divulged, except as required in the proper management of the
business.
        - No one should use, personally or for the benefit of others, infor-
mation from any communication.
        - Communications arrangements with customers, and information about
billing records, equipment, or cicuits, are not be disclosed to any unauthor-
ized person.
        - If a law enforcement organization, or any other government authority,
asks or by Company regulation -- the request should be referred immedicately to
the Company's Security Division.

        NorthWestern Bell has a suposed "GOOD" reputation about privacy.  So if
you have the slightest suspection of your line being tampered with, inform your
local Bell Representative (Any Operator).

  ============================================================================


       Pacific Northwest Bell has embarked on a modernization program that
will make it the first multi-state telephone company in the United States
with all computerized switching offices.
       When the conversions are complete in 1988, PNB also will be the first
multi-state telephone company in the United States to offer all of its company
that handles the toll calls they place through 1-plus dialing.

SYNDICATE REPORT FAST MONEY/TIME SAVING TIP:

       Setting up a teleconference?  Here's a time-saving tip:  arrance it on
the quarter hour.  Most teleconferences are assembled on the hour and the most
popular times are 9 a.m. and 2 p.m.  Teleconferences  attendants are being
overwhelmed at those times and conferees can spend excessive ammounts of time
on hold.
  ============================================================================

FIBER OPTICS BREAKTHROUGH:

       The highcost of laser technology had been viewed as a major obstacle in
the expansion of fiber optics technology to business and residential pre-
mises.  Scientists from AT&T Technology, however, have discovered a way to
get around the need for a laser in every home or business.  Instead of  using
a laser in each  piece of fiber optics  equipment, they've found that certain
"photodetectors" can reflect  laser light piped from switching offices and
carry the transmission.

  ============================================================================

NEW UNIX DEVELOPMENT:

       The Centron/Centrex ECAP (Electronic Customer Access Program) System is
an enhanced service availble to Centron and Centrex central office equipment
users.  Currently Centron/Centrex users must call a Business Office to have
changes made to their equipment.  The process is expensive and slow.  The user
is charged for each service order and the work may not be completed for
several days.
       The new ECAP system allows the use to enter equipment changes directly
to a Bell computer via a computer terminal.  The computer then prints the
orders  to be worked.  The work is completed within 24 hours and the user is
charged on a monthly basis rather than on a per-serice basis.
       The ECAP system is a series on programs written in the "C" programming
language to run a UNIX-based Plexus minicomputer.  There are ECAP Plexus
computer located in Omaha, St. Paul and Des Moines and soon to reach other
designated areas.  Each of is  capable of handling up to 16 simultaneous users.
       The Unify Data Base Manager has  been incorporated into the software
to allow the user fast and easy access to their data base of line records
which contain the feature for the  individual telephone line.  The ECAP
system was  developed for the Marketing Department by the  UNIX Development
Section of ISO.

DVX-DIGITAL VOICE EXCHANGE SYSTEM:

       Bell recently loaded on the NWB DVX system the FEATURE PACKAGE 5 which
incorporates feature that meet existing and future users needs.  Here are a few
examples on the system:

Personalized Greetings for the Message Center:
   The Messge Center Personalized Greeting is a greeting recorded by DVX users
that is played when a caller is transferted to the Message Center.  The greet-
ing is played to inform the caller, in the user's own voice, that they are not
available and leave a message after the tone.

Personalized Greeting for the Extended Absence:
   Callers attempting to create and send messages to DVX users are notified
via a pre-recorded greeting that the user in on extended absence.  With FP 5,
and Extended Absence Notification can now be personalized in the user's own
voice to inform callers that they are not available for a user-specified
length of time of up to one year.  Users have the option to have their Extended
Absense Greeting played instead on their Message Center Greeting.  The greeting
in active during the entire absence date has expired or that dat is cancelled
by the user.

Name Response:
   When callers reach a Message Center, they receive a DVX system
administrator's recording of the user's name.  With FP 5, individuals can
record their own name response to be played instead on the system
administrator's version during directory search, mailbox scan or when verifying
a user's ID or message delivery.

Enhanced Mailing List Capabilities:
   With FP 5, users can create, name, edit, review and delete their own mailing
lists via telephone keypad.

CLASS of Service:
   FP 5 allows a DVX system adminitrator to limit specific users services.
(See Syndicate Report #3 on tracing/blocking calls.)

       Yet to come in the next few weeks is the capability to integrate with
the Centrex here at any Bell Company.  The features included here will be a
stutter dial tone when you pick up the phone to indicate to you that a message
or messages are waiting on DVX.  Also, for those of you who utilize the Message
Center function, the caller will no longer have to re-enter the called party's
extension number and enables DVX to provide the caller with the name of the
person being called.
