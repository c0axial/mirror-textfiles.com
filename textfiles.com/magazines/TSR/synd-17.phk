       Welcome!  I bet many of you wonder where the hell the Report has been,
or me for that matter.  Most of you had suspected it was a legal problems,
since just before I left for a couple months I noted that a psuedo 411 service
sent over some people to find out what they could do about me using their
computer systems, VMS.  TSR #16 Part 2 outlines most of that.  The Last Visit
I got will be in this file as usual.

       Again I wasn't sure if I should contunie releasing Syndicate Reports.
But once in a while I get the free time, and it's my choice what I do with it.
I still accept articles and news if you can get them to me.  I am not going LD
as much as due to the legal attention.  2 Other files should accompany this
one.  The second part of 3rd Party Fraud, and bibliographic story entitled
"I'm not a Crook."  Expect of of the two or both out soon.

       Once again, enjoy TSR #17.  And Happy New Year!

IBM PLEDGES SUPPORT FOR ISDN IF WORLD STANDARDS ARE SET:                   TSR

Research Triangle Park, NC -- IBM Corp. left little doubt of its commitment
to a worldwide Integrated Systems Digital Network (ISDN) but said it won't
continue to participate if the world can't agree on stanards.

       "We have strong intent and desire for ISDN to be a reality," said Len
Felton, the IBM Communications Products Division's director of quality and
general development.  He noted that much work remains to be done by
participants in the Consultative Committee on International Telephony and
Telegraphy (CCITT), which is trying to formulate standards that would permit
the world's telephone systems to communicate digitally.

       The US telephone system will not be a stumbling clock to a digital
phone network, said Felton.  He said that IBM's independent research shows that
by 1989 enough digital equipment and switches will be installed to provide
connections to most of the country.  Standards should be wil enough ironed out
by that time to being widespread use of ISDN, he said.  The company is
currently involved in several field trials in the United States and Europe.

FCC DOCUMENTS VIA GENERAL ELECTRIC NET:

       GE Information Services is now carrying the National On-Line Regulatory
Access database of Federal Communications Commission (FCC) textual material.

D&B ENFORCES RESTRICTIONS OF DIALOG ON-LINE SUBSCRIBERS:

       New York -- Dun & Bradstreet last week stated that it will continue to
ban certain subscribers from its financial databases available on-line via
Dialog Information Services.

       After examining the facts of the case, in which Dialog users had been
denied access to Dun's Financial Records, D&B now intends to enforce it's
policy.  "We will continue to deny access to financial business and credit
services for unauthorized persons or organizations," said Bill Doescher, VP of
public relations and advertising for Dun & Bradstreet.  Dun's Financial
Records contains financial information on privately held companies that fear
the information could be used by labor unions against them when negotiating on
behalf of employees.

voice syntehsis, and call forwarding.  Applications of the product include
voice messaging, remote data entry, sales query, order entry systems, machines
control systems, customer response systems, and telemarketing.

interface with digital phone systems, PBXes, two-way radio, and cellular
phones.Other features include a dual mcicroprocessor, a 300/600 bps modem, an
acoustic coupler, and autodialer, and a 4-line-by-2 character LED display.

FCC CRACKDOWN CAUSING FAR EAST PC VENDORS TO MEET REGULATIONS:

       The FCC stringent crackdown on personal computers that give off
excessive ratio signals has resulted in a unique statistic that proves it is
better to do it right the first time.  According to the FCC officials, on Far
East vendor had to spend 30$ to retrofit each unit after being denied
commission certification.  However, new models that are designed to adhere to
the FCC's regulatins cost only about 2$ more to manufacture than last year's
models.

       Since the crackdown started, Far East companies have fallen in line
behind the government's marketing and engineering standards and are doing a
better job of meeting those standards, officials said.

  ============================================================================
THE LAST VISIT FROM OFFICIALS:

       I'm not sure the exact date they came over, but anyways it went like
this:  Just after I put my cycle in the garage after school, a car pulls up.
I didn't like the whole scene one bit.  It was the same Edina Minnesota Cop
that came to see me before about the Connection Breakin and a Secret Service
Agent.  I knew the cop, so he introduced me to the S.Service Man.  I won't list
any names.  Well, they asked if they could step in my room and have a
little chat of my cituation with the Connection and this other VMS system.
They were much more concerned with the Connection since Silent Assault was
busted on the same system.  I think they thought it was sort of a big area for
Phreak and Hack information to be exchange.  Infact it was for a while, for
Silent Assault and Me.  But no major information on my part.  Just Silent had
all the dangerous information which brought him to his term in jail.  (See
transmittal #14 for article).  All I ever used it for was voice and data
message accounting.  I did run a private system on one of the lines for a
approximately a month, although it didn't last long with the busts happening.

       When we got in my room, they both took and seat and went right out to
ask me what I knew.  They asked me specific formulas to hacking into the VMS's
and other systems locally.  I only told them steps to the Connection systems
since they could get the information on their own, or they knew it already.
They asked me questions like if I had ever used illegal credit cards or codes
lately.  They knew I used MCI before, but that was long since a past habit.
Also, they asked for programs that hack.  I gave them the disks I had since I
wouldn't need them. And in case I did need them, I could get them on any
system.  They also asked for printouts of the directories on the disks.  This
was no skin off my back so I cooperated.  The whole time the SS Man took mega
notes as if he was going to write a book when he retires.  Retirment didn't
seem to long off for this guy, so he was probably going to write a novel.

       All and all, it went well.  I they explained that since I was so co-
operative and such...that they'd try to get the charges dropped.  Even if I did
go to court, the judge could only slap my hand.  Maybe a fine, but nothing
too major with my record.  Clean.

       I'll leave you with a bit of advise.  If at all you meet up with
authorities of most any type, try and cooperate with them.  Do so just enough
not to get anyone, including yourself, in any trouble.  When being questioned,
think fast what your going to say and reply quickly and clearly.  They are
experts on questioning and can tell if the BS is being shoveled.  Don't worry
about anything unless you know your up a creek.  Just stay cool.
