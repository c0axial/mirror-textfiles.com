EDITOR'S NOTE:                                                            TSR
                       " PC PURSUIT HACKING STATISTICS "
       PCP password hackers are welcome tools for virtually all types of
users:  Phreaks, Pirates, Terrorists, system Hackers, etc.  PCP has become the
perfect way to dial long distance with low error ratios, flexibility with ID
codes/passwords used on other networks and most importantly, safety.
Telenet is because of the huge number of calls that are handled every day by
the big networks, keeping track of where every call and connection is made from
is financially impractical.  It is also very easy to disguise your location
using the network, which makes dial LD even more secure.
       As time and technology interface, code abusing slowly becomes past-time
reminiscence for busted hackers.  In response, PCP becomes the only resource
for paranoid hackers, alike.  Along these lines of paranoia, the need for PCP
password hackers increases.
       After all the years that PCP has existed, I've only seen 5 PCP password
hackers.  And of the 5 hackers, 3 of these devices were totally useless for
obvious reasons, upon execution...
Some of the obviousproblems indicated :  No online modem configuring.
                      Incomplete documention & Technical Information.
                      These apply to the anti-user friendly hacks.
                      Inaccurate response detecting positive completion of
                      passwords.
                      Ineffective random variable password generating.
                      ...and with all beta programs -- minor bugs.
     With this in mind, I'd like to add some PCP Statistics.  PCP
ID's andPasswords are not easy to get.  Format area:  PCP12345 and ABCD6789.
     The first thing a hacker considers when using a hacker is, what? PCP ID to
use.  Most are between 10,000 and 40,000.  I have never seen an ID over 40,000.
PCP doesn't disclose annual PCP profits, nor the number of subscribers they
currently have.  Although the number by many hackers is approximated around
5,000 to 6,000.  Keep in mind that businesses use PCP accounts too, in case
your criticizing that you've never seen 5,500 subscribing hackers.  Therefore,
the change of gaining a valid ID are significantly good.
     Of course, the PCP IDs do not bug hackers.  The complexed password scheme
is the brain parasite.  First there is the 4 random letters, then the 4 random
numbers - joined.  In essence, what a hacker is dealing with is 2 passwords
beyond 1.  The LETTERS, and the NUMBERS must match up - not the entire string
as a whole since the letters stop after 4, then take on an entire new syntax.
     I've seen some passwords that had numbers in the letter positions, and
vise verse for the letters.  Majority however stay in the above listed format.
     If interested in a PC Pursuit password hacker, consider using Phry Code
Pro., by The Exciter / 612.  Latest version can be found on RADIO WAVES.

AT&T WORKS ON MAKING UNIX LESS VULNERABLE:
             TSR (iw 2\11)
       Enhanced security features are being developed for Unix System V.4.1.
AT&T's vice president stated.  His keynotes to the Usenix Tech. Conference in
California insisted that open, multivendor networks are not centrally more
susceptible to security violations than proprietary systems.
       Security is on the mind of every Unix user, particularly when Unix-based
systems are to be used for mission-critical and strategic applications, like
running a high end workstation.

   The new version, on Unix, will achieve the National Security Agency's B2
level of security, and will actually also have some features of the B3 level as
well.  Powerful security tools exist in the current version of Unix V, but have
often gone unused by administrators because of a lack of quality documentation
and training.  AT&T will also be adding surreal security features to System
V.4.1., the first revision of the sill unreleased system V.4.0.
Procrastination seems to be top priority for many software vendors - just look
at Lotus.  Well, Unix won't be very welcome for the Hacking Community, and
myself.
       The features/improvements include:
               Access methodology beef up
               Maintenance of Data Integrity
               The denial of service
               Hacker/Intruder/Terrorist containments
               ...and the execution of the "superuser" status.
       About the "superuser" chop.  This is the most popular status, especially
for hackers, and AT&T takes it out.  It did more good than bad in the long run.
 In its place will be a finer distinction in status.  There will be a status of
"superuser" that is only used for mounting the systems.  That user will not be
able to access other "superuser" privileges.
       Control of the front end of system access - password security - will be
enhanced by the use of "shadow" password files.  The files containing the
password (etc/passwd) have been far to easy to access.  So, restricted access
to files, along with a form of activity audit, which will be used in System
V.4.1.  Actually, the greater sense within the system, including user and group
IDs, aging information, and a command and log-in audit.
   Editor's suggestions:
           Keeping systems resources in locked rooms/shells, to prevent shaking
of the shielding of shells/rooms, which can reveal information to external
devices.  AT&T should also use a dedicated printing resource to each high level
of security - a printer on each label page?  Well, that would code a lot of

money, but LD services do it all the time, along with personal supervision.
Then theres Fiber-Optics, and the security advantage there.  As printed in THE
SYNDICATE REPORT #20 (part 2), where an article explains the procedures in
Tapping Fiber Optic cables.  Then again, it's hard to break into a FO cable
without bringing the system down, with a nice alarm response.

AT&T BELLCORE & TINIEST SEMICONDUCTORS EVER:                   TSR (b.w 2\27)
       As the transistors on computer chips steadily shrivel away toward
nothingness, scientists are faced with a task much like figuring out how many
atoms can dance on the head of a pin.  Researchers as AT&T Bell Laboratories
are closing in.  They have devised a method of producing the tiniest
semiconductor crystals ever:  clusters containing as few as 100 atoms.  They
are so far too tiny to 'print' with even the wispiest microcircuit.  Still,
they may have practical applications.
       That's because a young polymer chemist, has developed a way to keep the
clusters from combining into larger clumps, as they otherwise would do.  He
grows each microcrystal inside a minuscule water droplet a thousand times
smaller than the diameter of a human hair, then replaces the water with organic
molecu

les.  "It's like putting the cluster in a little plastic bad," he says.
The clusters can be 'tuned' for specific jobs because they absorb different
wavelengths of light as they decrease in size.  So they could be used for
optical switches in future "optoelectronic" chips.

   AT&T, MCI and US Sprint are arming themselves for a new round of competition
in interactive 900-call services, according to TSR sources.  AT&T has been
hoping for FCC approval of its interactive 900 tariff.  MCI has been testing and
plans to offer a 900 service next month.  And US Sprint plans to begin
customer testing of its service in April '89.

"CYBERPUNKS" VS. THE MEDIA:                                    TSR (s.t 2\27)
       The following article can from a newspaper local to myself.  The
newspaper is the "Star and Tribune."  I, The Sensei, usually don't print up
verbatim copies of articles, but this articles was very interesting and
entertaining.
        Some of the information presented in insulting to most Hackers/Phreaks,
etc., so I'm going to comment on parts of the article.  Comments will be in
designated brackets, like this:  [ Blah, Blah...Har Har -TS ]
         _____________________________________________________________
       Silicon Valley -- A local Cop patrolling after midnight witnessed an
unusual sight, even for this center of high technology:  Two teenagers
 wedgedin a phone booth, laboring over the keyboard of a laptop computer clipped into
the telephone line.
 [ This is very humorous for me...I can't help wondering what technique these
guys are using to access Bell Fone's, heh. ]
       The youths, who were arrested for telephone fraud and computer abuse,
belong to a shadowy culture of computer vandals committed to illegally entering
and frequently tampering with the computer networks on which society has come
to rely.
       Those in this expanding underground -- known as CYBERPUNKS to themselves
and some social scientists -- have broken into corporate and military computers
and tampered with telephone billing switching equipment, sometimes altering
services and monitoring telephone lines.  Some have boasted of illicitly
entering computer used in stock-market trading.
 [ First of all, I protest to the term, "Cyberpunks."  No hacker I know of as
called themselves Cyberpunks.  If anyone reading this does, your probably not a
considered a hacker by most.  Second, Social Scientists don't know anything
about hackers -- they're just another worthless clan of scientists trying to
shape society as they wish. ]
 [ The newspaper then goes on to refresh our memories about the Morris Jr.
Unix WORM, haven't we heard enough about his guy.  And it was a really
complicated set of code he set for his so-called CSci Project. ]
       Articles describing how to write viruses have appeared in several
publications that are widely circulated within the underground.  Writing in
 the journal 2600, which says it speaks for the computer underground, an author
using the pseudonym "The Plague" described how to create a virus.
       "If people's data is destroyed, then so be it," he wrote.  "If people
are stupid enough to accept pirated software, then they deserve to be
punished," says Plague.
 [ Well, The Plague has it all wrong.  Viruses are not ONLY in pirated
software, my friend, they creep within all types of programs.  Your just adding
to the problem.  It's goes against 'Hacker Ethics,' but the information should
not to suppressed from the hacking community. ]
       The term CYBERPUNK is a reference to a popular science fiction genre
that deals with an intersecting world of high technology and outlaw society.
 "This is the case of art driving reality," said one Social Scientist at the
Institute for the Future, Calif.  "You have a small group who is actually going
it, and a large pool that is buying into what they are doing and redefining
reality."
 [ Yet another scientist froma corrupt institution, making conclusions based
on a small fraction of neo-hackers. ]
       Cyberpunks often are called HACKERS, but computer scientists are careful
to note that not all hackers are malicious.  The term originally referred to
researchers who were committed to designing advanced computer hardware and
software. [ This is the first decent statement I've read. ]
       Another often-heard term is "PHREAKING," which is the illegal use of
telephone systems.
       "Phreaking is moral," said an 18 year-old hacker who calls himself,
"Frank Drake" in messages on the bulletin boards.  "There is no theft involved.
It's not theft of services, because this equipment would otherwise be idle."
 [ It's about time these Media-Types informed the public of my favorite hobby,
Phreaking.  And about the definition Frank Drake gave.  "Illegal use of Fone
System." ?  Sorry, not all of the uses by phreaks is illegal.  More than
anything, phreaking is basically composed of "Learning about the Bell system,
along with illegal use." ]
       Computer experts working in the industry who have become involved with
malicious hackers see them as computer addicts possessed by an antisocial
obsession.  "They're misfits, losers or troubled individuals lacking a sense of
duty or morals," said a computer researcher at a Silicon Valley institution.
 [ Misfits? Losers? Antisocial individuals?  This is another scientist
shooting his mouth off with little support.  The idea of hackers being social
outcasts, or losers is a common misconception by many.  Most malicious computer
hackers are party animals when given the right conditions.  And if one was told
he is labeled an, "Outcast, Loser etc.", the person talking would get an entire
new face of the word MALICIOUS.  Namely a 99e99 dollar fone bill, credit check
and unchecked, and maybe a subscription to every magazine on the face of the
Earth.  ]
       In recent years this researcher has offered four underground hackers
programming jobs to try to channel their energy away from destructive use of
computers.  In each case the experiment ended in failure, the scientists said.
       The researcher asked not to be indentified, and his reason is revealing.
He fears that the CYBERPUNKS/Hackers are so skilled at tampering with computers
that they might be able to alter his credit rating or have his electricity
turned off.
 [ Oh my.  Will these guys never learn?  Hackers are not stupid "Lab Rats."
They want a challenge, away from sitting at a computer programming for another
person.  And this scientist is concluding his entire experiment on just a few
hackers.  Yes, his fear of hackers is valid.  I am now thinking of ways to find
out who this guy might be.  The credit rating would be no problem, same with
the electricity.  A scientist without electricity, is like a hacker without
Telenet. ]
       "Every single one of them had deep psychological problems," he said.
Some members of the hacker underground appear to agree with this psychological
assessment.
 [ Hah!  No comment...for obvious reasons. ]
       "They have this crazed need to find the answer," said Eric Corley, edit
of 2600 Magazine.
       Corley, whose personal hacking resulted in three brushed with the law
before he started the publication in 1984, said:  "They keep exploring where
they know they shouldn't go.  A true hacker won't stop just because he gets in
trouble."
 [ Corley is totally correct here, of course.  But I think some hackers don't
stop hacking, because some are just over powered with the need to learn.  I
never stopped hacking after by bust for many reasons.  I the primary reason
was because I'm not a quitter, and I looked back on how much had I learned.
With the learning, fun followed. ]
       Although computer experts believe the number of outlaw hackers is
growing, the behavior they exhibit is not new to the high-tech world.
For example, a computer programmer, John Draper, spent six months in jail
during the 1970s for illegal use of the telephone network.
       Draper's nickname, "Captain Crunch," derived from his discovery that a
whistle that came as a prize in a cereal box was tuned to the correct frequency
to unlawfully manipulate fone company switch gear.
 [ Hmmm.  Every hacker knows all this already.  At least a true hacker should
know his/her past.  But the thing I can't help wondering is, what was Captain
Crunch doing with a whistle from the "Captain Crunch cereal" box?  And why was
he blowing it into the fone.  Makes me laugh if you think about it.  Another
thing, anyone with two front teeth can blow a 2600 Hz tone whistle. ]

BUSTING TELEPHONE SOLICITORS:                                TSR (st.cit 2\27)
       Join to fight telephone solicitors!  How you ask?  Read on...
                       :::: Illustration, Exampling ::::
    "Have you ever off and had a fantasy of going to the library and finding
out who owns the companies that call YOU, interrupt you, and calling THEM back?
It makes you happy for a while.  Particularly when working 11 to 7 shift, you'd
think of the companies that had awoken you (using YOUR private fone) at noon."
    "One nurse I know did something like that to a persistent insurance
salesman.  One day she got awake and alert enough to get his name and number
and promised to call back.  She did.  At 2 AM, announcing that it was HER
working day, and she was now awake and would like to discuss the po
licy....He never called her back."  -TS
                      :::: Tips Offs to a Fone Scam ::::
    If it sounds too good to be true, it's probably a scam.  Some of the most
popular promotions among telephone con artists include prize offers to get you
to buy water purifiers or vitamins, magazine subscriptions, PENNY STOCKS,
precious metals, travel and cellular telephone lottery applications.
    Be skeptical of says such as, "This is the best deal you'll ever find," or
"Double your money, no risk!"

  The government, Federal Trade Commission estimates that Americans lose 1$
billion a year from the deceptive peddling of goods and services over the
fone.  Other organizations say it's much higher.  One might suggest lobbying
for stricter FED laws governing 'telemarketing businesses.'
                  :::: Striking Back at 'The Solicitor' ::::
     o  Do NOT hang up on telephone solicitors. This just allows them to make
        another call 200 milliseconds later. Listen to them. Ask stupid
        questions.  Drag out conversation. Contemplate placing an order, then
        don't.  Or start to place an order, then change your mind.
     o  After wasting their time as much as possible, cackle insanely and hang
        up.  Or give them the raspberry and yell, "Only f00ling!121!!&!"
     o  Remember always, that these twits are partially paid on commission.
        The more of their time you waste, the less they are gonna earn.
        Eventually they may quit, and if we're persistent enough, maybe
        someday nobody will WANT to work for these cretins.
     o  Why not add "May I speak to your supervisor?" for no good reason...
     o  "Just a sec., I'll get my wife, she's really interested in this sort
        of thing..." and leave the phone on the table for 10 minutes...
     o  Blow him some nice tones.  1000 Hz is nice.
     o  If it's a girl, start to BS with her.  Ask her out.  Even better, make
        like to you who she is, and your going to strange things to her body.
        90% are ugly college chics, so you might not be able to hang up on one
        with this approach.  Use your own judgement.
     o  Turn the bell off on the phone, and hook up an answering machine, and
        sleep, sleep.
                      :::: Ethics one should abide by ::::
     o  Don't go after the lower echelons of the company by terrorizing the
        telemarketer.  They have no effect on the company.  All you do is ruin
        somebody else's night.  With few exceptions, he is just as unhappy
        about bothering you as you are about being interrupted.
     o  Lash back at the company, not the peon.  He's paid to do that.  4 out
        of 5 people wouldn't do that unless they were paid.
                               :::: REMEMBER ::::
    The organizing principal of modern society is, "The only people in contact
with the public are the ones with no authority".   Keeps we, the people,
fighting with each other while leaving the Bosses free to play power games with
lives.

SOFTWARE LINKS UNIX SYSTEM TO ATOMIC CLOCK:                     TSR (i.w 2\28)
       Precision Standard Time Inc. recently placed in the public domain
software that synchronizes nodes on a Unix TCP/IP network to the atomic clock
that U.S. Government uses to keep official time.
       On Unix networks, a number of time-sensitive applications require
careful synchronization, both between network elements and in relation to an
absolute time standard.
       Now inconsistencies need not occur.  The software continually
synchronizes nodes on a network to within 100 milliseconds on the atomic clock
at the National Institute for Standards and Technology.
US NO 202-653-0351.
       The software consists of University of Maryland's Time Demon, "ntpd,"
which implements the Network Time Protocol and synchronizes the host computer
to Coordinated Universal Time, the international time standard.  The software
can be operated with or without a Time Source radio receiver sold by Precision
ST.  Without an external time standard, however, no provision exists to correct
inaccuracies caused by the drift of computer calendar clocks or by errors
introduced in manual clock setting.

  ::::::::::::::::::::::::SYNDICATE REPORT BRIEF NOTES::::::::::::::::::::::::

// Callers Must be Told the Cost //
   The FCC yesterday ordered 5 companies that charge customers 20% to 80% more
than AT&T, MCI or Sprint to toe the line.  The alternative operators must now
tell callers how much the call will cost and which company is placing it before
it goes through.  The high rates usually are placed on hotel, airport or
hospital phones.
:: UPDATE ::
   As stated above, alternative long-distance operators must: Put a sticker on
the phone with price information or tell the caller the price verbally; give
callers an chance to hang up without any charge; offer callers a chance to go
through AT&T or another phone service.  Right now many alternative operators
stop you from using another carrier.
         _____________________________________________________________
// Bell Goes To College //
     Bell Atlanticom Systems said yesterday it has signed a contract with the
College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va., for a fully integrated voice
and data communications system. The campus-wide system will provide resale of
communications services to students, a management system, and a universal wiring
plan to provide voice and data transmission.
     The communications system obtained by the College of William and Mary
yesterday will provide 300 trunks, 3,800 faculty and student lines, 150
voice/data faculty users and 1,050 host data ports.  It includes more than 5,000
inside wiring runs and several miles of fiber optics.  Also included: A 1,000-
user Aspen Voice Mail System and the Alex-IS Telecommunications Management
System.

// Hackers Fail Raiding ATMs //                                           TSR
    If authorities hadn't been tipped, a computer hackers could have cracked
one cash-machine network of more than 14$ million over a single weekend, of
Feb. 18.  Charged in the plot were GTE Corp. consultant Mark Koenig, and 4
other hackers.  Federal Agents said the hackers pulled the personal ATM codes
from GTE te
lephone lines.  The lines transmit transactions from account at Bank
of America and thousands of other banks linked to the Plus System, a national
network of shared ATMs.
    The Hackers put the data in magnetic strips on 5,500 pieces of card board.
They planned to use the bogus cards to make withdrawals around the country. If
it were not for a "TIPOFF", authorities wouldn't have known what hit them.
 [ Now this is a sad story.  These -hackers- have a chance to break 14 MILLION
in tax-free cash, and they blow it.  I bet one of them bragged about it to a
girl friend.  That's the only way computer hackers get caught...they have to
see some limelight. ] --TS

// Speaking of ATM Heists... //
     Recently, a crook used a Security Pacific National Bank ATM master card,
which tapped into virtually all accounts.  The heist resulted in a 237,000$ win
for the hacker.  The bank reimbursed depositors but still have not found the
culprit.  Alarmed by the incident, the American Bankers Assoc. plans to urge
its 13,500 members to strictly limit access to ATM master cards and personal
indentification codes.
