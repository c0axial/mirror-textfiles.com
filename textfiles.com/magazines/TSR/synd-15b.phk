       Hello and WELCOME to 'Part 2' of The Syndicate Report Transmittal #15/2.
Part 2 was brought on for many reasons.  The amount of news this month, and the
latter part of August brought a lot of extra articles and the such.  I'd like
to thank people for submitting news/articles, it helps.

       I've also set up another VMS system.  This is not dial direct such
as the above VMS's.  The number is 612-831-0888.  When you hear the female
instructions voice, simply dial: 404.  You will then hear my voice with
instructions on leaving name and number etc.  Retrieval of messages is 90%
faster on this VMS since there is an online pager built in.  So if there is a
need to contact me quick, leave your message with contacting informatin and
the VMS will page me and transmit your message.  Use this only for emergency
type situations.  The pager can be turned off by me.  -Thank you.

       Personal Comment:  As most of you know, LOD/H is publishing Technical
Journals.  I recommend reading and storing the Tech. Journals for they prove to
be good for past and future reference.  LOD/H Technical Journals may be
downloaded from any of the various systems reviewed at the end of this Report.

UNIX SYSTEM NEWSLETTER:                                                    TSR

       Usr/Group, the International Association fo Unix Systems Users, began
publishing a beweekly newsletter last month to cover the Unix Systems
Marketplace.

       The Usr/Digest summarizes product introductions and enhancements,
corporate announcements, industry projections, and other time-sensative events
that relate specifically to the Unix OS.

FIBER OPTICS IN THE HOME:                                                  TSR

       Like many real estate developers, packaged-goods poineer Jeno F.
Paulucci, the founder of both Jeno's Inc. and Chung King, is betting big on
newfangled telecommunications system.  He thinks tha fiber-optic cable will
help him lure businesses to what he envisions as a 3,500 acre, $1 billion "city
of the future" just outside Orlando. (Sounds like my type of city -- but not
along with the newfangled security systems.)  But in a new twist, Paulucci's
Heathrow Development Co. is teaming up with Southern Bell and Northen Telcom to
take fiber optic-cable one step further than it has gone before -- directly
into the subscribers' homes.

       Eventually, that partnership will allow the first 250 residents moving
into Heathrow next year to enjoy the benefits of cable TV, movie rentals,
security and energy-management systems, computerized data, and phone service
through a single telecommunications line.

       Other U.S. phone companies also are plunging into residential trials
with optical-cable.  American Telephone & Telegraph and southwestern Bell are
teaming up on a pilot project involving 100 homes in Leewood, Kan., while GTE
has request regulatory aproval to wire more than 5,000 homes in Cerritos,
outside Los Angeles.

       "These are the first serious experiments in the U.S.," says John P.
Ryna, manager of the fiber-optics group at Electronicast Corp., a San Mateo
(Calif.) markey resercher.  Ryan thinks the home market for fiber-optics
technology is poised to take off early in the next decade.  He figures some
900$ million worth of fiber-otic cable and equipment wil be sold to regional
phone comanies this year, though almost exclusively for business applications.
But by 1995, Ryan anticipates residential sales could account for 75% of a
market worth some 4$ billion.  "Ultimately, these trials will drive the
technilogy," he says.  "It's where the exonomics will be sorted out."

MORE GLOBAL CLOUT FOR MCI:                                                 TSR

       It was the right deal at the right price.  MCI Communications Corp.
announced on Sept. 3 that it wil buy telex giant RCA Global Communications
Inc. from General Electric Co. for 160$ million.  While newer communications
services are supplanting telex, MIC seems to have gotten a bargain.  It picked
up a crack engineering staff and a host of medium-size business customers.
But the biggest value may be Globecom's world presence:  MCI's share of the
international data transmission business will jump to about 45% from roughly
20%, giving MCI more clout in future negotiations with foreign governments.

HORSE-RACING FANATICS BET VIA MODEM:                                       TSR

       More then 360,000 horse-racing fanatics have special accounts for
placing telephone bets with the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club.  But on busy race
days the phone lines get jammed -- even with 1,600 operators on duty.  To
cope, the Hong Kong Club is buying. handheld portable betting terminals, so
members can bypass the operators and post their bets, via modem, directly to
the club's computer network.  The "portabet" terminals were developed jointly
by Kiel Corp.  in Amherst, N.H., and Varitronix Ltd. of Hong Kong, which will
be the actual manufacturing.  After a test period next spring, the Jockey Club
 hopes to offer the units to as many as 100,000 bettors for less than 100$
each.

       Allowing outsiders to dial directly to the compuer will present
hazards.  No doubt some horse-happy hackers will try to place bets from their
own comptuers, evesdrop on expert bettors, alter bets, or otherwise tap into
the 7$ million that flows in dialy via phone bets.  To foil them, the Jockey
Club has dired several other U.S. companies, including San Diego's
International Totalizator Systems, to develop security far more tamperproof
than any home-banking system no in use.

THE IBM-MCI PARTNERSHIP FINALLY TAKES OFF:                                 TSR

       When International Business Machines Corp. bought a 16% share of MCI
Communications Corp. in early. in early 1986, it looked as if American
Telephone & Telegraph Co. was in for some tough competition.  Its chief rival
in the long-distance business had teamed up with the leading computer maker,
and together they were pithcing network services to major corporations.  But
they never seemed to get anywhere -- until now.

       On Sept. 1 the MCI-IBM team landed its first big customer:  United
Airlines Inc.  The contract, valued at more then 10$ million, will increase
MCI's share of United's long-distance phone business to 20% from 5%, the
airline says.  AT&T will stil provide the rest.  IBM's contribution is NetView,
a system that will let United route its own voice and data traffic -- both
internally and to the MCI network.  This gives United control of what was done
by an outside carrier.  United, a longtime IBM customer, was also one of the
first to place big orders for IBM's 9370 minicomputers and PS/2 personal
computers.

SYNDICATE REPORT BRIEF NOTES:                                              TSR

       A computer hacker was apprehended recently for gaining access to
Pacific Northwestern Bell data banks, with information he gathered by raiding
dumpters outside CO buildings.  The incident promptly reminded PNB Officials
to remind employees to put discarded records that contain priotary information
in boxes destine for shedding.

  :::::::::::::::::Information Provided by Silent Assault 612:::::::::::::::::
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

       MCI is planning to replace the 5 Digit Access Code Ports with cards and
advanced digit coding.  Rumor length is 8 digits.  The move was brought upon
by excessive fraud.  MCI plans to have the new format effective by the end of
the year 1988.

  ::::::::::::::::::::::::Information Provider Unknown::::::::::::::::::::::::
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

       WARNING -- For Hackers of State University New York/St. Francis.
Security has been stepped up recently, according to NY Times.  Apparently,
New York State Police caught Lebanon Terrorists using the mainframe to do
illegal dealings.  Officials have been scanning the accounts for content.  1
of the 3 Terrorists went by the name of Haidar Dhanas.  An Electrical
Engineering Dept. Chairman stated, "Given the security system around here I
am not very suprised that someone used our Labs at will."

       Officials also recovered information on stolen military hardware,
15,000$ worth of video recorders, TVs, and microwaves apparently being
bought with stolen credit cards.

       Those of you that don't know, I've produced a new file.  It was released
on September 7th '87.  The file was titled:  3rd Party Fraud and Voice Mail
Systems.  Since Voice Mail Systems are becoming so common, there had to be
another advantage to them, rather than leaving message remotely with PWs/Codes
and the like.  This file introduces you to another use for VMS's.  I'm thinking
of setting out a 'Part 2' for the 3rd Party Fraud/VMS file, since new ideas and
developments on VMS's have recently came to my attention.  Expect Part 2. and
Enjoy The Syndicate Report.  -The Sensei / TSR
