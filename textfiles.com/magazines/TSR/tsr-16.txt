       Hello, I'm writing this the day the report is due out for official
Sponsor Systems such as FreeWorld // Private (# listed later).  All other
systems get the report on the day of distribution, or whenever it gets uploaded
by me or another user.
       A lot has been going on this past month.  To start out, the (local to
myself) Minnesota Twins are currently combating for the World Series Title.
2 games have already been played against The St. Lois Cardinals, which The
Twins have already won 2 with ease.  The 1st game was 10-1, and the 2nd game
was 8-4.  It's not really telecommunications news - but it is history.  And it
do think the Twins will take it for '87.  Secondly on the list, and not also
not really related to telecom is The Stock Market Crash.  On the date of
10-19-87, the Market took over a 500 point plung, beating Black Tuesday's
record (Starting the G.Depression).  Thirdly, Iran and the the United States
are slapping each other in the face.  We just got done bombing a few Oil
Bases - thus Iran declared WAR.

  This is of course not official until the US also declares war.  Reagan's quote
of the history books "They're not that stupid."  And lastly, but not nearly as
record breaking...I was busted for hacking my local PhoneMail VMS System.

FCC LENGHTENS ACCESS CHARGE COMMENT PERIOD:                                TSR
       The FCC has extended the cOmment period for its proposed acces chanrges
that could raise on-line provider rates as much as 5$ an hour.  Originally,
the last date for public comment was to have been Sept. 14.  In August the FCC
extended the comment period until Sept. 24, and replies can be submitted until
October 26.
       The extension was requested by a consortium of 23 companies and
organizations headed by Adapso, the computer software and services trade
group.  The group said it needed more time to prepare its responses to the FCC
access charge proposals.  In the meantime, public comment on the matter
(Docket No. 87-215) has been running overwhelmingly against the proposal, with
many letters from on-line service users at major universities protesting the
financial hardship the new access charges would inflict on them.

JUDGE GREENE EASES INFORMATION SERVICES RESTRICTIONS ON BOCs:              TSR
       The federal judge who presided over the breakup of the Bell System has
decided to relax some restrictions barring the Regional BOCs (Bell Operating
Companies) from providing information services.
       In a 223-page decision, US District Judge Harold H. Greene from the
District of Columbia said he is prepared to let BOCs provide gateways to
infomation services, including X.25 protocol conversion, but BOCs would not
be allowed to provide contun: for those services.
       Greene ordered interested parties to submit proposals by Sept. 30.
After a short reply period, Greene said he will issue an order modifying the
present restrictions.
       Judge Greene's action disappointed Regional BOCs, which, with the US
Justice Dept., had advocated lifting all restrictions on BOCs providing
information services.  "Today's decision places the benefits of modern tele-    communications services just beyong the reach of most telephone customers,"
read a statement from Arthur C. Latno, executive vice president of Pacific
Telesis Group, a San Franciso-based BOC.  "We sincerely hope that today's
ruling will be short-lived and that potentially damaging consequences to our
telecommunications infrastructure don't result."
       The Information Industry Assoc. (IIA), which represents information
providers such as CompuServe, applauded Greene's decision.  "By permitting the
BOCs to provide gateway services, the Judge's decision is expected to further
the development of new information services," said Paul Zurkowski, president
of the IIA.
      In the opinion, Greene noted that the United States lags behind other
countries, particularly France, in providing information services to consumers.
      "The French information services scheme permits individual citizens to
secure an enormous number of variety of information services with ease and at
a reasonable cost," Greene stated.

CELLULAR PHONES AND COPS:
       The cellular phone's versatility is winning big fans in local govern-
ments across the country.  The Sheriff's Dept. in Boulder County, Colo., uses
13 cellular phones for more extended and private conversations than it can get
from its regular police radios, according to Captain Charles Co. Pringle,
head of staff services at the department.  But criminals are gong high-tech,
too.  For some time now, drug dealers in New York City's South Bronx have used
radio-paging devices to reach customers.
  Now that they've gone cellular,these people can make calls that automatically
are switched among the cellular systems's 333 frequencies -- and
law-enforcements officials are find finding it increasingly hard to eavesdrop on
perpetrators.

IBM ENCHANCE TELECOMMUNICATIONS WARES:                                     TSR
IBM is expected to make some high-end telecommunications announcements tomorrow
in New York.  Frank Dzubeck, president of Communications Network Architects Inc.,
said IBM's Rolm subsidiary will announce enhancements and modifications to the
company's PBX products.  IBM may also announce some minor enhancements to its
Netview network management system on a level that Dzubeck referred to as
"tweaking."
       IBM spokeswoman Jeanett a Maher confirmed that the announcements

5$ BILLION FEDERAL PHONE SYSTEM                                            TSR
NEW PLAYERS IN GSA GAME:

NOTE: [This articles is a follow up on '$5 Billion Dollar Contract Out For New
Government Phone System - Syndicate Report Transmittal #15 Part 1]
       The General Services Administration (GSA), bowing to the wishes of
House Government Operations Committee Chairman Jack Brooks (D-Tex), now wants
two contractors instead of one for the new $5 Billion Fed. TelePhone System
(FTS).  But several government agencies may seek their own phone systems rather
than wait for FTS to materialize. The bidding pits AT&T, the incumbent supplier
of phone services, and its partner, Boeing, against 12-member team consisting
of Marin Marietta, MCI, and AT&T's former local phone companies.  Two dropouts,
General Motors' Electronic Data Systems and partner US Sprint, may reenter the
bidding.
  ============================================================================
FAX AND AT&T .08$ PER-PAGE AGREEMENT:
       Digital Tech. has been improving fax machines for several years now.
The most sophosticated models can send a page anywhere in seconds, instead of
the minutres required by conventional machines, cutting long-distance bills.
But with price tags of 10,000$, the advanced machines are a bit expensive.
Now US Fax Inc. says it can give owners of conventional machnes the savings of
digital transmission.
       The Philadelphia startup will take fax messages over local phone lines
and then relay them over long distancs via AT&T Co.'s high speed digital
network.  A customer with a touch-tone phone simply calls a local US Fax
number and sends a message.  The service costs 2$ a month plus .25$ for each
call and a charge of about .08$ per page.  The new service also provides other
high-cost fax features, such as the ability to broadcast the message to
multiple to multiple receivers.

No Data Bases For The Baby Bells:
       Information companies are breathing easier after a US District Court
ruling on Sept. 10 that bars the seven regional Bell companies from thecomputer data-base business -- for the next few years, at least.  Although
Judge Harold H. Greenes order does let the Bells transmit information
gathered by others, it's uncertain whether centralized phone-answering
services and electronic mail are still prohibited.  A 45-day public comment
period should help clariy the questions.

FCC Tax Info:
       FCC will most likely not be charging private/Bul.Board Systems such as
FreeWorld //, Osuny BBS etc.  The 5.00$/hr tax will be directed to the large
computer databases such as the Source, CompuServe, etc.  The BILL (Docket No.
87-215) does look like it's going to be passed (If not already), according to
B. Maher, FCC Policy Official.  The number to reach him is at 202-632-6047.

Cops Capture Clear FingerPrints:
       A new device was made recently calls Veridex.  The machine's maker,
Fingermatrix Inc.  of North White Plains, NY., says it produces electronic
fingerprints 10 times clearer than those made with ink -- which 40% of all
ink cards are ususable.
       Veridex' secret is an opticaal scanner hooked up to a laser printer.
Stick a finger under the scanner, and it produces a digitized topographic
"prnt" that can be copied onto a standard law enforcementcard or transmitted
electronically to an automated fingerprint file.  While each print takes about
a minute to make, the machine can churn out as many as 15 copies every 30
seconds.  Drawbacks?  Perhaps one:  At a cost of up to 100,000$ for the full
package, this device is too expensive for every detective's pockets.  Still,
Fingermatrix says the machines is being tested by the Federal Bureau of
Intevestigation, the California Justice Dept., and others.
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
U S Sprint Receiving ANI:
       A recent rumor was confirmed that U S Sprint will be getting ANI soon.
In LA, they will be replacing DEC 600 with a DMS 250.  This will allow U S
Sprint to receive CCIS data from all the incoming T1 Links from Class 4 Tandem
Offices - so they will have originating number on all feature group A, B and
D calls.  This process is called CCS7 and is another step towards ISDN.
Installation date for the 0777 Los Angelas switch is scheduled January '88.
       The Oct 22 rumor date is the official start up date.  This however, is
not for sure.  CCS7 will also allow a direct link between BELL and the Sprint
billing computers -- clearing up Sprint's billing problems.
       Many of the other major LDS's will be switching to CCS7.  AT&T already
have completed the cross-over.  It was also found out that with feature group
B and D, Sprint does'nt have to actually pick up a local line and dial the
destination #, it's done by Wink - Start and Inband Standard Multi Freq. Touch
Tones directly conneting the Sprint originated call to the local Bell Network.
Some LDS's do still use feature group A, which actually picks up a line,
listens for tone, then dials your destination number.  Some of you might have
found these numbers and intercepted calls by dialing the dial out number, and
waiting for it to pick up.  Agent Steals adds that a complete verification
should be done by interested users.

free enterprise.  Bell Atlantic Corp. is closing 24 of its 40 remaining
CompuShop Inc. stores -- ater shuttering 27 a year ago -- and laying off 30%
of its computer sales force.  Nynex Corp., which built a 92-store chain
largely by acquiring 81 former International Business Machines Corp. outlets,
it telling analysists that, after three years, its stores will finally break
even in the fourth quarter.

TSR NEWARK, N.J. - Local telephone customers in New Jersey will be able
to screen their incoming calls in a controversial test by New Jersey
Bell Telephone Co., beginning in early November.
     The New Jersey Board OF Management services on about 250,000 local customers.
     The test will occur in six exchange areas in Atlantic and Hudson
counties to determine whether the services, call CLASS, should be
offered statewide.  The experiment is scheduled to last until
September 1989.
     New Jersey Bell originally sought permission to test CLASS last
November, but withdrew the proposal in March for further study.  The
telephone company has said the delay had nothing to do with
opposition to one of the CLASS services, called Call Identification.
     Call Identification would let users with special display
attachments view the number of the person placing the incoming call.
That would enable the answering party to decide whether to take the
call.
     Another CLASS service, Call Trace, lets customers have the phone
company trace a call - but only for law enforcement purposes - by
hanging up on the call and dialing prescribed digits.
     Other services grouped under CLASS include the ability to let
customers dial back the last incoming call whether or not the user
answered it; re-dial the last outgoing call; key in up c+c%MQ%9

     Excepting Call Identification and Call Trace, CLASS will cost
residential users $4 per month for the first service and $1.50 per
month for each additional service.
     Call Identification will cost $6.50 per month for residential
customers and $8.50 per month forbusiness users.  The display
attachment, about $65, is expected at electronics stores sometime
this fall.

WANG & ITT CONSIDERED MERGER:                                              TSR
  Wang Laboratories Inc. and ITT Corp. apparently held secret talks about a
possible merger two years ago when ITT was under attack by corporate raiders.
Nothing came
 of the talks, though, reportedly because Wang wanted to maintain
control of the combined companies.
  That's story sources say will be reported in a new book called "Tumultuous
Years: A Personal Account of the Rebuilding of ITT," by ITT Chairman Rand V.
Araskog.
  To The Boston Globe, Wang spokesman Paul Henning has confirmed that company
founder An Asshole Discussions with Araskog in 1985, calling the talks
"general in nature and cordial" but adding they "resulted in no substantive
agreements."
  The Glob

e reports that Araskog's book, to be published by Henry Holt Inc. of
New York, also discloses similar talks with other companies.

PACTEL PROPOSES DEFINITION FOR BELL INFORMATION SERVICES:                  TSR
  Pacific Telesis Group has proposed a definition that would allow Bell
Regional holding companies to provide certain types of information services
that do not substantially change the content of information sent and received
by other parties.
  The California telecommunications company filed the definition change, which
was ordered by the courts on September 10, to lift certain restrictions on
information services imposed on the regional holding companies under the
consent decree that broke up AT&T in 1984. At that time the court indicated
that the regional holding companies may provide "transmission-type" information
services but not "content-related" services.
  The Pacific Telesis proposal considers that transmission-type information
services include "transforming, processing, guiding, storing or retrieving
information in connection with the transmission of information, provided such
activities do not substantially alter the content of the information as sent
and received."
  According to Pacific Telesis, these services may also provide introductory
information content services, billing and collection services for information
service providers and providing for the electronic delivery of directory
services which might include a list of general product and business categories,
service or product providers under these categories and their names, telephone
numbers and addresses. This definition, noted Pacific Telesis, allows for
changes in the form of transmitted messages, but in keeping with the court's
intent, doesn't allow for substantial changes to the content of messages.
  "By design, the scope of the proposed definition is quite broad. We feel it
must be framed in these terms to accommodate rapid changes in industry
technology and the marketplace and, above all, to allow for easy and efficient
communication between information services providers and consumers," said
Arthur C. Latno Jr., Pacific Telesis' executive vice president. "Our definition
would allow the RHCs to offer consumers access to audiotex and videotex
services and a variety of information databases."
  The proposed changes submitted to the court will be considered along with

TSR EDITOR GETS VISIT FROM LOCAL VMS OFFICIALS:                            TSR
       That's right, the TSR Editor in the title definately does symbolize
me...The Sensei.  It's not a very glamorous visit, but here's the story:  It
was Wednesday the 14th of this month in October.  Just after school....I logged
into my local VMS Boxes (8504/8503 etc) to check messages.  After logging in,
I was suprised to hear I had no new messages.  I usually averaged 4 new
messages during the day.  Well, I hang up and set up the terminal prog to call
a few systems.  Just as I pick up the phone, my older brother yells to me that
someone was here to visit me about my computer.  Well, you can imagine what I
thought.  I went through the routine of hiding a few disks and files.  I then
walk upstairs to be greeted by an Official from The Connection (a local
VMS/411 psuedo-service.), and an Agent.

       They were really nice to me at first.  They came up to shake my hand and
tell me politely I was on the edge of serving time for Edina Minnesota police.
Up to 90 days, or 700.00$ fine could be brought down on my under Criminal
Code Statue 609.89 of COMPUTER THEFT.  They said they could have tooken all
the phones in the house and my computer.  I couldn't really understand at first
why they had the right to take my computer.  But I thought to myself, this is
the government...they do as they usually wish to an extent.  But I also
remembered I used the Connection VMS to transfer my Syndicate Report and other
files I made via computer.  They had no warrant, but I wanted to be as
well cooperated as possible, thus to not make the situation a big fuss.  They
asked to see the computer system I had...I showed them gladly since I knew
there was no problem in that direction.  They also told me right off the bat
that if I was 18, I'd be in jail etc.  I was glad for that law. But they also
pointed out about some 9 kids (under aged) got busted very recently for carding
a load of items and sending them to a house - the Judge sentenced them as
adults.  The Judge went on bases that if they kids knew how to do all that,
then they will be tried as adults.  Getting back, they then showed me Syndicate
Report #14 to me.  (Nice prinout may I add)  This was the month for Report
#15 Parts 1 and 2, but I hadn't gotten around to posting it on the VMS line.
       After a while of BSing on such topics as:  Why do I Hack, write TSR,
scan systems and commit other related deeds.  I only agreed that yeah, I
hacked systems...but only to explore them and learn how they work - Not to
destroy.  Well, they then prompted me that the Secret Service had some of my
Reports and they didn't want to get involved to much.
       That's the story.  Again like last time, they said they may inform me if
anything was to come out of it.  I'm not worried for now, till the 18th BDay
rolls around.  One last thing, I was caught by my own carelessness - A few of
you may have an idea how, but I'm not going into that.
       Becareful out there.  -The Sensei of The Syndicate Report Magazine.
