BARATA ELETRICA -    

The translation is something like  Electric Roach - (not cucaracha, please,
we talk portuguese here, not spanish). I'm writing this e-zine at the
University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, which does not quite like it. However,
last time i talked to the guys up there in the Administration, they let
me distribute it by use of any means other than their computers. So,
that's how it came here.
This e-zine began after i attended a Hacker Congress in Buenos Aires,
Argentina. The Internet was not available to common people back then,
and i got very fond of seting up a Hacker Congress at my home country.
Problem is that people should first know what's this all about, what's
good and what's a bad thing to do. 
	Besides, lots of people with some background in the area, don't
even know what is "2600 hacker quaterly". Sure they heard about Mitnick,
but don't know a thing about the guys who build the Internet. Talk about
hacking and security subjects in my e-zine almost closed my access to
the net, so i keep it quite tame. Still, people like it and write me
from everywhere. Not bad for what i consider a pale shadow of other zines.
I try to keep most articles in Portuguese, but am still the only writer,
and once in a while (almost always) have to use articles i get in the Net.
There are articles in English, but it's material most people reading
Phrack wouldn't care to read. Here in Brazil, it's unknown. Take your 
chances, if you want.
	Don't forget to use binary, when doing a download. Then you don't
have to g-unzip the file later. Just write something like:

get be00.txt

The file will come uncompressed, just like magick. Good luck.
