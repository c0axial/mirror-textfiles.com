                          A Critique of Communism
                                    and
                       The Individualist Alternative
                                (continued)


            Let us take a closer look at the type  of  society  the
       communists would have us live under and see if we can get at
       the essence of these laws. Kropotkin says that  "nine-tenths
       of those called lazy...are people gone astray." [14] He then
       suggests  that   given   a   job   which   "answers"   their
       "temperament"  and  "capacities"  (today we would hear words
       like "relate", "alienation" and "relevancy"),  these  people
       would  be  productive workers for the community.  What about
       that other ten percent  which  couldn't  adjust?   Kropotkin
       doesn't  elaborate,  but  he  does  say, "if not one, of the
       thousands of groups of our  federation,  will  receive  you,
       whatever be their motive; if you are absolutely incapable of
       producing anything useful, or if you refuse to do  it,  then
       live like an isolated man....That is what could be done in a
       communal society in order to turn  away  sluggards  if  they
       become  too  numerous." [15] This is a pretty harsh sentence
       considering that ALL  the  means  of  production  have  been
       confiscated  in  the  name of the revolution. So we see that
       communism's law, put bluntly,  becomes  "work  or  starve."*
       This  happens to be an individualist law too. But there is a
       difference between the two: the communist law is a  man-made
       law,   subject  to  man's  emotions,  rationalisations,  and
       inconsistencies; the individualist law is nature's law - the
       law of gastric juices, if you will - a law which, like it or
       not, is beyond repeal.  Although  both  laws  use  the  same
       language,  the  difference  in  meaning  is  the  difference
       between  a  commandment  and   a   scientific   observation.
       Individualist-anarchists  don't  care  when, where, or how a
       man earns a living, as long as he is not invasive about  it.
       He  may work 18 hours a day and buy a mansion to live in the
       other six hours if he  so  chooses.  Or  he  may  feel  like
       Thoreau  did  that  "that man is richest whose pleasures are
       the cheapest" [16] and work but a few hours a week to ensure
       his  livelihood. I wonder what would happen to Thoreau under
       communism? Kropotkin would undoubtedly look upon him  as  "a
       ghost of bourgeois society." [17] And what would Thoreau say
       to Kropotkin's proposed "contract"?: "We undertake  to  give
       you  the  use  of  our  houses,  stores,  streets,  means of
       transport, schools, museums, etc., on condition  that,  from
       twenty  to  forty-five or fifty years of age, you consecrate
       four or five hours a day to some work recognised [by  whom?]
       as necessary to existence....Twelve or fifteen hundred hours

            *Article 12 of the 1936 constitution of the USSR reads:
       "In  the  USSR work is the duty of every able-bodied citizen
       according to the principle: `He who does not  work,  neither
       shall  he  eat.'  In  the USSR the principle of socialism is
       realised: `From each  according  to  his  ability,  to  each
       according to his work.'"





                                  - 8 -



       of work a year...is all we ask of you." [18]  I don't  think
       it would be pulling the nose of reason to argue that Thoreau
       would object to these terms.

            But some communist-anarchists would reject  Kropotkin's
       idea  of  not giving to the unproductive worker according to
       his needs, even if he doesn't contribute  according  to  his
       abilities. They might simply say that Kropotkin wasn't being
       a good communist when he  wrote  those  lines  (just  as  he
       wasn't  being  a good anarchist when he supported the Allies
       during World War I). But this idea, it seems to me would  be
       patently  unjust  to  the  poor  workers  who  would have to
       support such parasites. How do  these  communists  reconcile
       such an injustice? As best I can gather from the writings of
       the classical communist-anarchists, they meet  this  problem
       in one of two ways: (1) they ignore it, or (2) they deny it.
       Malatesta takes the first approach. When  asked,  "How  will
       production  and  distribution be organised?" he replies that
       anarchists are not prophets and that they have no blueprints
       for the future. Indeed, he likens this important question to
       asking when a man "should go to bed  and  on  what  days  he
       should  cut  his  nails."  [19]  Alexander Berkman takes the
       other  approach  (a  notion  apparently  borrowed  from  the
       Marxists*): he denies that unproductive men will exist after
       the revolution. "In an anarchist society it will be the most
       useful and difficult toil that one will seek rather than the
       lighter job."  [20]  Berkman's  view  of  labour  makes  the
       protestant  work  ethic sound positively mild by comparison.
       For example: "Can you doubt that even the hardest toil would
       become  a  pleasure...in  an  atmosphere  of brotherhood and
       respect for labour?" [21] Yes, I can doubt it. Or again: "We
       can  visualise  the  time  when  labour  will  have become a
       pleasant exercise, a joyous application of  physical  effort
       to  the  needs  of  the  world." [22] And again, in apparent
       anticipation of Goebbles' famous dictum about the powers  of
       repetition, "Work will become a pleasure... laziness will be
       unknown." [23] It is hard to argue with such "reasoning". It
       would  be  like  a debate between Bertrand Russell and Billy
       Graham about the existence of heaven. How can you argue with
       faith? I won't even try. I'll just ask the reader, next time
       he is at work, to look around - at himself and at his  mates
       -  and ask himself this question: "After the revolution will

       --------------------

            * At least Berkman is consistent in this matter.  Marx,
       paradoxically,  wanted to both "abolish labour itself" ("The
       German  Ideology"),  AND  make  it   "life's   prime   want"
       ("Critique of the Gotha Programme").





                                  - 9 -



       we really prefer this place to staying at  home  in  bed  or
       going  off  to the seashore?" If there are enough people who
       can answer "yes" to this  question  perhaps  communism  will
       work  after  all.  But  in the meantime, before building the
       barricades and  shooting  people  for  a  cause  of  dubious
       certainty,  I  would  suggest pondering these two items from
       the bourgeois and communist press respectively:

       "In Detroit's auto plants, weekend absenteeism  has  reached

       such  proportions  that a current bit of folk wisdom advises
       car buyers to steer clear of vehicles made on  a  Monday  or
       Friday.   Inexperienced  substitute  workers, so the caution
       goes, have a way of building bugs into a car. But  in  Italy
       lately  the  warning  might well include Tuesday, Wednesday,
       and  Thursday.  At  Fiat,  the  country's   largest   maker,
       absenteeism  has  jumped  this  year  from the normal 4 or 5
       percent to 12.5 percent, with  as  many  as  18,000  workers
       failing  to clock in for daily shifts at the company's Turin
       works. Alfa Romeo's rate has hit 15 percent as  hundreds  of
       workers  call  in  each  day  with  `malattia di comodo' - a
       convenient illness.... Italian auto workers seem to be doing
       no  more  than  taking  advantage of a very good deal. A new
       labour  contract  guarantees  workers  in   state-controlled
       industries 180 days of sick leave a year, at full pay, while
       workers in private firms (such as Fiat) get the same  number
       of days at 75 percent of full pay." [24]

            When doctors, employed by the state, made an inspection
       visit  in  Turin  we  are told that they found "that only 20
       percent of the `indisposed' workers they  had  visited  were
       even  mildly  sick." For those who think that this is just a
       bourgeois aberration, let us see  what  revolutionary  Cuba,
       after   12  years  of  communism,  has  to  say  about  such
       "parasites". I translate from  the  official  organ  of  the
       Central Committee of the Cuban Communist Party:

       "Worker's discussion groups are being set  up  in  all  work
       centres  to discuss the proposed law against laziness. These
       groups have already proven to be a valuable  forum  for  the
       working  class.   During  these  assemblies,  which  for the
       moment are limited to pilot projects  in  the  Havana  area,
       workers  have  made  original  suggestions  and posed timely
       questions which lead one to believe that massive  discussion
       of  this  type  would  make  a  notable  contribution to the
       solution of this serious  problem.  An  assembly  of  boiler
       repairmen  in  the Luyano district was representative of the
       general feeling of the workers. They demanded that action be
       taken  against  those  parasitic  students  who have stopped
       going  to  classes  regularly  or  who,  although  attending
       classes,  do just enough to get by. The workers were equally
       adamant about co-workers who, after a sickness or  accident,
       refuse  to  go  back to their jobs but go on receiving their





                                  - 10 -



       salaries for months without working.  Questions  were  often
       accompanied  by  concrete  proposals.  For  example,  should
       criminals receive the same salaries on coming back  to  work
       from  prison  as  when  they  left  their  jobs? The workers
       thought  not,  but  they  did  think it all right  that  the
       revolutionary  state  accord  a  pension  to  the prisoner's
       family during his stay in the re-education [sic] centre.  At
       the  Papelera  Cubana  factory the workers made a suggestion
       which proved  their  contempt  of  these  loafers;  habitual
       offenders  should be punished in geometric proportion to the
       number of their crimes.  They also proposed that workers who
       quit  their  jobs or were absent too often be condemned to a
       minimum, not of 6 months, but of one year's imprisonment and
       that the worker who refuses three times work proposed by the
       Ministry of Labour be considered automatically as a criminal
       and   subject  to  punishment  as  such.  The  workers  also
       expressed doubts about the scholastic `deserters',  ages  15
       and  16,  who  aren't yet considered physically and mentally
       able to work but who don't study either. They also cited the
       case  of  the  self  employed man who works only for his own
       selfish interests. The dockworkers of Havana port,  zone  1,
       also  had  their meeting. They envisioned the possibility of
       making this law retroactive for those who have  a  bad  work
       attitude,  stating  forcefully  that it wasn't a question of
       precedents, because otherwise the law could only be  applied
       in  those  cases  which  occurred  after  its enactment. The
       harbour  workers  also   proposed   imprisonment   for   the
       `sanctioned'   workers  and  that,  in  their  opinion,  the
       punishment of these parasites shouldn't be lifted until they
       could demonstrate a change of attitude. The steadfastness of
       the workers was clearly demonstrated when they demanded that
       punishments  not  be  decided  by  the workers themselves in
       order to avoid possible leniency due to reasons of sympathy,
       sentimentality,  etc.  The workers also indicated that these
       parasites should not have the right to the  social  benefits
       accorded   to   other   workers.   Some  workers  considered
       imprisonment as a measure much too kind. As you can see, the
       workers  have  made  many  good proposals, which leads us to
       believe that with massive discussion, this new law  will  be
       considerably  enriched.  This  is perhaps the path to social
       legislation by the masses."* [25]

       These two extracts clearly  demonstrate  that  human  nature
       remains  pretty  constant,  independent of the social system
       the individual workman is subjected to. So it  seems  to  me
       that  unless  human  nature  can  somehow   be  miraculously
       transformed  by  the  revolution  -  and  that  WOULD  be  a
       revolution  -  some form of compulsion would be necessary in
       order to obtain "from each according to his abilities."

            While on this point, I would like to ask my  communist-





                                  - 11 -



       anarchist comrades just who is supposed to determine another
       person's abilities? We've seen from the above  article  that
       in  Cuba  the  Ministry  of  Labour makes this decision. How
       would it differ in an anarchist commune? If these anarchists
       are  at  all  consistent  with  their  professed  desire for
       individual freedom, the only answer to this question is that
       the  individual  himself  would  be  the  sole  judge of his
       abilities  and,  hence,  his   profession.   But   this   is
       ridiculous.  Who,  I  wonder,  is going to decide of his own
       free will that his real ability  lies  in  collecting  other
       people's  garbage? And what about the man who thinks that he
       is the greatest artist since Leonardo da Vinci  and  decides
       to devote his life to painting mediocre landscapes while the
       community literally feeds his delusions with food  from  the
       communal  warehouse? Few people, I dare say, would opt to do
       the  necessary  "dirty  work"  if  they  could  choose  with
       impunity  ANY  job, knowing that whatever they did - good or
       bad, hard or easy - they would still  receive  according  to
       their  needs.** The individualist's answer to this perennial
       question of "who will do the dirty work" is very simple:  "I

       --------------------

            *The Associated Press has since reported the passage of
       this  law:  "Cuba's  Communist  regime announced yesterday a
       tough new labour law that Premier Fidel Castro said is aimed
       at  400,000 loafers, bums and `parasites' who have upset the
       country's new social order. The law, which goes into  effect
       April  1,  provides for penalties ranging from six months to
       two years of forced labour in `rehabilitation  centres'  for
       those   convicted   of  vagrancy,  malingering  or  habitual
       absenteeism from work or school. The law  decrees  that  all
       males  between  17  and 60 have a `social duty' to work on a
       daily systematic basis unless they are attending an approved
       school.  Those  who  do not are considered `parasites of the
       revolution' and subject to  prosecution  by  the  courts  or
       special  labourers' councils. The anti-loafing law - seen as
       a tough new weapon to be used  mainly  against  dissatisfied
       young  people - was prompted by Mr. Castro's disclosure last
       September that as many  as  400,000  workers  were  creating
       serious economic problems by shirking their duties." [26]

            ** Anyone who has ever gone to an anarchist summer camp
       knows  what  I mean. Here we have "la creme de la creme", so
       to speak, just dying to get on with the revolution; yet  who
       cleans  out  the  latrines? More often than not, no one. Or,
       when it really  gets  bad,  some  poor  sap  will  sacrifice
       himself  for  the cause. You don't have solidarity; you have
       martyrdom.  And  no  one  feels  good  about  it:  you  have
       resentment on the part of the guy who does it and guilt from
       those who don't.




                                  - 12 -



       will  if  I'm  paid  well  enough." I suspect even Mr. Heath
       would go down into the London  sewers  if  he  were  paid  5
       million pounds per hour for doing it. Somewhere between this
       sum and what a sewer worker now gets is a just wage,  which,
       given  a  truly free society, would be readily determined by
       competition.
            This brings us to the  second  half  of  the  communist
       ideal:  the  distribution  of  goods  according to need. The
       obvious question  again  arises,  "Who  is  to  decide  what
       another  man  needs?"  Anarchists  once more must leave that
       decision up to the  individual  involved.  To  do  otherwise
       would  be  to invite tyranny, for who can better determine a
       person's  needs  than  the  person  himself?*   But  if  the
       individual  is  to decide for himself what he needs, what is
       to prevent him from "needing" a yacht and  his  own  private
       airplane?  If  you  think  we've got a consumer society now,
       what would it  be  like  if  everything  was  free  for  the
       needing? You may object that luxuries aren't needs. But that
       is just begging the question: what is a luxury,  after  all?
       To  millions  of people in the world today food is a luxury.
       To the English central heating is a  luxury,  while  to  the
       Americans  it's  a  necessity.  The Nazi concentration camps
       painfully demonstrated just how little man  actually  NEEDS.
       But   is   that  the  criterion  communists  would  use  for
       determining need? I should hope (and think) not. So it seems
       to me that this posses a definite dilemma for the communist-
       anarchist: what do you do about unreasonable, irrational, or
       extravagant  "needs"?  What  about the man who "needs" a new
       pair of shoes every month? "Nonsense," you may say, "no  one
       needs  new  shoes  that often." Well, how often then? Once a
       year? Every five years perhaps? And who  will  decide?  Then
       what  about  me?  I  live in Switzerland and I'm crazy about
       grape jam - but unfortunately the Swiss aren't. I feel  that
       a  jam  sandwich  isn't a jam sandwich unless it's made with
       GRAPE jam. But tell that to the Swiss! If Switzerland were a
       communist  federation,  there  wouldn't be a single communal
       warehouse which would stock grape jam. If I were to go up to
       the  commissar-in-charge-of-jams  and  ask him  to put  in a

       --------------------

            * I'm reminded here of the tale of the man who  decided
       his mule didn't NEED any food. He set out to demonstrate his
       theory and almost proved his point when, unfortunately,  the
       beast  died.   Authoritarian  communism  runs a similar risk
       when it attempts to determine the needs of others.

       requisition for a few cases, he  would  think  I  was  nuts.
       "Grapes  are  for wine," he'd tell me with infallible logic,
       "and more people drink wine than eat grape jam." "But I'm  a
       vegetarian,"  I  plead, "and just think of all the money (?)
       I'm saving the commune by not eating any of  that  expensive
       meat."  After  which he would lecture me on the economics of
       jam making, tell me that a grape is  more  valuable  in  its
       liquid  form,  and  chastise  me  for  being  a throwback to
       bourgeois decadence.

            And  what  about  you,  dear  reader?   Have   you   no
       individual  idiosyncrasies? Perhaps you've got a thing about
       marshmallows.   What  if  the  workers  in  the  marshmallow
       factories  decide  (under  workers' control, of course) that
       marshmallows are bad for your health, too difficult to make,
       or  just simply a capitalist plot?  Are you to be denied the
       culinary delights that only marshmallows can  offer,  simply
       because  some distant workers get it into their heads that a
       marshmallowless world would be a better world?

            But, not only would distribution according to need hurt
       the  consumer,  it would be grossly unfair to the productive
       worker  who  actually  makes  the  goods  or  performs   the
       necessary  services.  Suppose, for example, that hardworking
       farmer Brown goes to the communal warehouse with a  load  of
       freshly  dug  potatoes. While there Brown decides he needs a
       new pair of boots. Unfortunately there are only a few  pairs
       in stock since Jones the shoemaker quit his job - preferring
       to spend his days living off Brown's  potatoes  and  writing
       sonnets about the good life. So boots are rationed. The boot
       commissar agrees that Brown's boots are pretty  shabby  but,
       he points out, Smith the astrologer is in even greater need.
       Could Brown come back in a month or so when BOTH soles  have
       worn  through?  Brown  walks away in disgust, resolved never
       again to sweat over his potato patch.

            Even today people are beginning to complain  about  the
       injustices  of the (relatively mild) welfare state. Theodore
       Roszak writes that in  British  schools  there  has  been  a
       "strong  trend  away  from  the  sciences over the past four
       years" and that people  are  showing  "annoyed  concern" and
       "loudly observing that the country is not spending its money
       to produce poets and Egyptologists - and  then  demanding  a
       sharp  cut in university grants and stipends."[27] If people
       are upset NOW at the number of poets and Egyptologists  that
       they are supporting, what would it be like if EVERYONE could
       simply take up his favourite hobby as his chosen profession?
       I  suspect  it  wouldn't  be  long  before  our professional
       chess players and  mountain  climbers  found  the  warehouse
       stocks  dwindling  to  nothing.  Social  unrest would surely
       increase in direct proportion to the  height  of  the  trash

       piling  up  on the doorsteps and the subsequent yearning for
       the  "good  old  days"  would  bring  about  the  inevitable
       counter-revolution.    Such   would   be  the  fate  of  the
       anarchist-communist utopia.
