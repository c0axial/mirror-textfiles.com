Editor's Word
_____________

A friend of mine was half a year ago confronted with the claim that the
Self "really did not exist", and that this was scientifically proven.
At the time, I only laughed, and considered the proponent of the idea
to be a little weird. I still consider it weird, but having heard the
claim over again, I do not laugh.

In the last issue, I went over the basic types of [mistaken] selfish-
ness, and promised to follow up with a discussion of what was the true
Self/ego. In conjunction with the above concern, this is the starting
point for my article The Self. 

Ken Knudson's eminent article continues. The chapter one makes up
almost half the article, so I have chosen to issue the rest of the
chapter as separate issues, so that discussion may begin. I hope the
somewhat arbitrary sectioning of the article into the different issues
is forgiven. 

The next chapter will be "REVOLUTION: THE ROAD TO FREEDOM?".

Svein Olav Nyberg:
                               The Self



As seen in the last issue, what "selfish" means depends strongly upon
what you mean by "self". I will not here try to correct all the wrong
ideas of what the Self is, but rather give an indication of what I think
the right view is. There are, as you well are aware, many different
conceptions of what "self" means. A general line of division between
these conceptions I have found very well illustrated in Wilber, Engler
and Brown's book on the psychology of meditation [1]:  To different
stages of cognitive development belongs different self  -structures and,
not the least, -images. The highest stage, called the Ultimate stage, is
described as "the reality, condition, or suchness of all levels." If you
draw the stage diagram on a paper, the Ultimate Self is in relation to
the other "selves" as the paper in relation to the elements of the
diagram drawn on it. Improper selfishness, then, might be viewed as the
mistaking of the image for the real thing.

So, there is a very important division between the underlying Self, and
the various self-images. This division is found more or less explicitly
in a variety of sources. Pirsig, in his famous best-seller, denounces
the ego, but embraces the Self in his praise of arete as "duty towards
Self." [2] The philosopher Nietzsche writes that "The Self is always
listening and seeking: it compares, subdues, conquers, destroys. It
rules and is also the Ego's ruler.   Behind your thoughts and feelings,
my brother, stands a mighty commander, an unknown sage - he is called
Self.", and also, a little above this, "[the Self] does not say 'I' but
performs 'I'." [3]. 

In [1] it is concluded that though all who experience the Ultimate
stage do essentially the same, the experience and understanding of it
depends on the prior interpretation. The Buddhist experience an egoless
state, while the theistic meditators experience [being one with] their
god. Who is having this unifying experience? The same guy, essentially,
who has everyday experience. Fichte [4] asks of his audience, "Gentle-
men, think of the wall," and proceeds "Gentlemen, think of him who
thought the wall." In this way he gets an infinite chain, as "whenever
we try to objectify ourselves, make ourselves into objects of
consciousness, there always remains an _I_ or ego which transcends
objectification and is itself the condition of the unity of conscious-
ness," as Copleston describes.

Now, whether we shall side with the meditators who claim to experience
this _I_, or with Fichte who says we cannot, is of little importance
here. What is important, is that the _I_, this ground and condition
indeed exists, and that it is the ground of the empirical ego or egos.

I want to take a closer look at this _I_ - the Self.

So far, the Self may be seen on as something just lying in the back-
ground, a kind of ultimate observer. But Fichte's question can also be
asked of action, "Who is lifting your arm when you lift your arm?"
Like it was clear in the first case that it was not the image of the
Self - the ego - that was aware, but the Self itself, it is equally
obvious that it is not the image of the Will that lifts the arm - but
the Will itself. To understand this better, try to will the coke bottle
in front of you to lift. Won't do. Now, "will" your arm up in the same
way that you willed the coke bottle. Won't do either. Still, lifting
the arm is easy. (See also [3])

Proceeding like above, we can find a well of parts of the underlying 
Self. But they are all one. The Self that sees the stick is the same
Self that throws a rock at it. How else would it hit? I have found it
useful to single out  three of them, which I will call the Experiencing
Self, the Creative Self and the Teleological Self.

Stirner [5] speaks of "the vanishing point of the ego", and of the
"creative nothing". He has "built his case on nothing". This latter is
the one that reveals what he intends. For surely, he has built his
cause on - himself. But in the way of Fichte, the Self is not a thing,
but the basis for speaking of things. To be a thing is to be an object
for some subject and, as Fichte showed, the subject cannot properly be
an object. So, Stirner's "creative nothing" is him Self.

In contrast to Fichte, however, Stirner emphasizes the finite here-and-
now individual Self, not the abstract Ego: "Fichte's ego too is the
same essence outside me, for every one is ego; and, if only this ego
has rights, then it is "the ego", it is not I. But I am not an ego along
with other egos, but the sole ego: I am unique. Hence my wants too are
unique, and my deeds; in short everthing about me is unique."

So we see Stirner rejects the positivistic idea of viewing himself from
a 3rd person vantage point. He is not "ego", the image of himself. For
one can have an image of anyone. But ones own Self is experienced from
the 1st person point of view, and one is oneself the only one who can
experience oneself from there. Again quoting Stirner: "They say of God:
'Names name thee not.' That holds good of me: No -concept- expresses
me; they are only names."

The history of philosophy can be simplified as follows: We have gone
from a focus on experienced reality, to experienced self, and from that
on to that which contains both - the Experiencing Self. Stirner, as a
student of Hegel, must have seen this, and, as he states, this history
is also _my_ history. The dialectic process is taken back into its
owner. I am not any longer viewing myself as a moment in the dialectical
self-unfolding of the Absolute, but as he who learns and thinks these
thoughts, and - take the advantage of them.

The philosophical process did not stop at the Experiencing Self, with
which an empiricist would be content. A reaction came, asking what
elements of experience were constituted by the subject himself. The
observer was no longer seen as a passive observer, but as an active
participant contributing his own elements into experience. Thus we
can say that the awareness of the creative role of the intellect was
properly emerging. We had the Creative Self. This was idea was taken
very far by Stirners teachers - into German idealism.

Stirners main thesis is that of the individual as the ground not only
of observation and creation, but of evaluation. This thesis is given
a short presentation as a 0th chapter in The Ego and His Own: "All
things are Nothing to Me." No outer force is to determine ones cause,
ones evaluation. With a convincing rhetoric, Stirner makes room for
the case that he himself is the evaluator, the one whose cause is to
be acted for.

Stirners main dialectical triad is then this, that we go from mere 
experience to action [thought], and as a solution to the strain between
these go to valuation and interest, self-interest. This is a recurring
theme in his book, and the structure of the argument is presented in
the first chapter, very appropriately named "A human Life".

The triad, as I have understood and interpreted it, is this:

The Experiencing Self: This is, so to say, the beacon that enlightens
the empirical world, which makes it possible qua empirical world. With
knowledge of oneself only as experiencing, one is stuck with things,
and all ones activity is centered around things, as Stirner says. One
is a Materialist. In history, both the personal and the philosophical
one, the Empirical Self is seen as a passive observer on whom the world
is imprinted, all until we come to the antithesis of this view:

The Creative Self: We discover our own more active role in experience,
our own contribution of elements/form to our experience, as shown by
the [Kantian inspired] experiments of the early Gestalt psychologists.
With this knowledge, attention goes to thought itself, and, we become
intellectual and spiritual young men. Our quest goes for that in which
we can pry Spirit, and we become - Idealists. 

The Teleological Self: There is a [dialectical] strain between the two
views and aspects of the Self above, a conflict that can only, as Stirner
says, be resolved by a third party, which is the synthesis. We begin to
ask: Why do I focus on this, and not on that, in experience? Why do I
create this and not that? For whom am I doing my creation, my thinking?
I find the answer to the above questions in what I will call the
Teleological Self. The Teleological Self is he [or rather - I] for whom
all things done by me are done, the commander who is the measure of all
activity. Any value, any selection, and thereby any focus and any
creation, owes its existence to the Teleological Self. In the Teleological
Self we find the grounding of our "why?".

The dilemma between Materialism and Idealism is resolved in Selfishness.
Not do I go for the material for its sake, nor do I let the cause of any
ideal invade me and make its cause mine. I take both, but as tools and
things to be disposed of at - my pleasure. In this fashion the dialectics
is buried. For it is only alive in the world of ideas, which I have taken
back into myself.

This was an attempt to convey some thoughts on the Self. If anyone feels
tempted to pick up this thread, expand on it or negate it, you are
welcome. It will be a pleasure.

                          A Critique of Communism
                                    and
                       The Individualist Alternative
                                (continued)


            Before one can get into  an  intelligent  criticism  of
       anything,   one   must   begin   by  defining  one's  terms.
       "Anarchism",  according  to  the  Encyclopaedia   Britannica
       dictionary,  is "the theory that all forms of government are
       incompatible with individual and social liberty  and  should
       be  abolished." It further says that it comes from the Greek
       roots  "an"  (without)  and  "archos"  (leader).*   As   for
       "communism",  it  is  "any  social theory that calls for the
       abolition of private property and control by  the  community
       over  economic  affairs."  To  elaborate on that definition,
       communists of all varieties hold that all wealth  should  be
       produced and distributed according to the formula "from each
       according to his** ability, to each according to his  needs"
       and  that  the  administrative  mechanism  to  control  such
       production  and  distribution   should   be   democratically
       organised   by   the   workers  themselves  (i.e.  "workers'
       control").  They further insist  that  there  should  be  no
       private  ownership of the means of production and no trading
       of goods except through the official channels agreed upon by
       the  majority.  With  rare  exceptions,  communists  of  all
       varieties propose to  realise  this  ideal  through  violent
       revolution and the expropriation of all private property.

            That no one should accuse me of building up  straw  men
       in  order to knock them down, allow me to quote Kropotkin***

       --------------------

            * Historically, it was Proudhon who first used the word
       to mean something other than disorder and chaos: "Although a
       firm friend of order, I am (in the full force of  the  term)
       an anarchist." [5]
            ** Here Marx uses the masculine pronoun to  denote  the
       generic "one". In deference to easy flowing English grammar,
       I'll stick to his precedent and hope that Women's Lib people
       will forgive me when I, too, write "his" instead of "one's".
            *** I have chosen Kropotkin as a  "typical"  communist-
       anarchist here and elsewhere in this article for a number of
       reasons. First, he was a particularly prolific writer, doing
       much  of  his  original  work  in  English.  Secondly, he is
       generally  regarded  as  "probably  the  greatest  anarchist
       thinker and writer" by many communist- anarchists, including
       at least one editor of "Freedom". [6] Finally,  he  was  the
       founder  of Freedom Press, the publisher of the magazine you
       are now reading.




                                  - 5 -



       to show that communist-anarchism fits in well with the above
       definition of communism:


       "We have to put an end to the  iniquities,  the  vices,  the
       crimes  which result from the idle existence of some and the
       economic, intellectual, and moral servitude of others.... We
       are  no  longer  obliged  to  grope  in  the  dark  for  the
       solution.... It  is  Expropriation....  If  all  accumulated
       treasure...does  not immediately go back to the collectivity
       - since ALL have contributed to produce it; if the insurgent
       people   do  not  take  possession  of  all  the  goods  and
       provisions amassed in the great cities and do  not  organise
       to  put  them  within  the  reach of all who need them...the
       insurrection will not be a revolution, and  everything  will
       have  to  be begun over again....Expropriation, - that then,
       is the watchword which is imposed upon the next  revolution,
       under  penalty  of  failing  in  its  historic  mission. The
       complete  expropriation  of  all  who  have  the  means   of
       exploiting  human  beings. The return to common ownership by
       the nation of all that can serve in the hands of any one for
       the exploitation of others." [7]

            Now let  us  take  our  definitions  of  communism  and
       anarchism  and see where they lead us. The first part of the
       definition of communism calls for the abolition  of  private
       property.  "Abolition"  is  itself  a  rather  authoritarian
       concept - unless, of course, you're talking about abolishing
       something  which  is  inherently  authoritarian and invasive
       itself (like slavery or government,  for  example).  So  the
       question  boils  down  to "Is private property authoritarian
       and   invasive?"   The   communists   answer   "yes";    the
       individualists  disagree.  Who  is  right? Which is the more
       "anarchistic" answer?  The communists  argue  that  "private
       property  has become a hindrance to the evolution of mankind
       towards  happiness"  [8],  that  "private  property  offends
       against   justice"   [9]   and   that   it   "has  developed
       parasitically amidst the free institutions of  our  earliest
       ancestors."  [10] The individualists, far from denying these
       assertions, reaffirm them. After all wasn't it Proudhon  who
       first declared  property "theft"?*   But when the  communist

       --------------------
            *By property Proudhon means property as it exists under
       government  privilege,  i.e.  property  gained  not  through
       labour or the exchange of the products of labour  (which  he
       favours),  but  through  the  legal  privileges  bestowed by
       government on idle capital.





                                  - 6 -



       says, "Be done, then, with this  vile  institution;  abolish
       private   property   once   and  for  all;  expropriate  and
       collectivise  all  property  for  the  common   good,"   the
       individualist must part company with him.  What's wrong with
       private property today is that it  rests  primarily  in  the
       hands  of a legally privileged elite. The resolution of this
       injustice is not to perpetrate  an  even  greater  one,  but
       rather  to  devise  a  social and economic system which will
       distribute property  in  such  a  manner  that  everyone  is
       guaranteed  the  product  of  his labour by natural economic
       laws. I propose to demonstrate just such a system at the end
       of  this  article.  If  this  can be done, it will have been
       shown that private property is  not  intrinsically  invasive
       after all, and that the communists in expropriating it would
       be committing a most UNanarchistic act.  It  is,  therefore,
       incumbent upon all communists who call themselves anarchists
       to read carefully that section and either find a flaw in its
       reasoning or admit that they are not anarchists after all.

            The second part of the  definition  of  communism  says
       that economic affairs should be controlled by the community.
       Individualists say they should be controlled by  the  market
       place  and  that  the  only law should be the natural law of
       supply and demand. Which of these two  propositions  is  the
       more  consistent  with  anarchism?  Herbert Spencer wrote in
       1884, "The great political superstition of the past was  the
       divine  right  of kings. The great political superstition of
       the present is the divine right of  parliaments."  [11]  The
       communists  seem  to  have carried Spencer's observation one
       step further: the great political superstition of the future
       shall  be the divine right of workers' majorities. "Workers'
       control" is their ideology;  "Power  to  the  People"  their
       battle  cry.  What communist-anarchists apparently forget is
       that workers' control means CONTROL.  Marxists,  let  it  be
       said  to their credit, at least are honest about this point.
       They openly and unashamedly demand the dictatorship  of  the
       proletariat.  Communist-anarchists seem to be afraid of that
       phrase,  perhaps  subconsciously  realising   the   inherent
       contradiction  in their position. But communism, by its very
       nature,  IS  dictatorial.   The   communist-anarchists   may
       christen  their  governing  bodies  "workers'  councils"  or
       "soviets", but they remain GOVERNMENTS just the same.

            Abraham Lincoln was supposed to  have  asked,  "If  you
       call  a  tail  a  leg,  how  many  legs has a dog? Five? No!
       Calling a tail a leg don't MAKE it a leg." The same is  true
       about  governments  and laws. Calling a law a "social habit"
       [12] or  an  "unwritten  custom"  [13]  as  Kropotkin  does,
       doesn't  change  its nature. To paraphrase Shakespeare, that
       which we call a law by any other name would smell as foul.
