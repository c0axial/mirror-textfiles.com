            Given the advantages of the division of labour, what is
       to  be  the  method  by  which  man  exchanges his products?
       Primitive man devised the barter system  for  this  purpose.
       But  it  wasn't  long  before the limitations of this system
       became apparent:

       "Let Peter own a horse; let James own a cow and a  pig;  let
       James's  cow  and pig, taken together, be worth precisely as
       much as Peter's horse; let Peter and James desire to make an
       exchange;  now,  what  shall  prevent  them  from making the
       exchange by direct barter? Again, let Peter own  the  horse;
       let  James  own  the  cow;  and  let John own the pig. Peter
       cannot exchange his horse for the cow, because he would lose
       by  the transaction; neither - and for the same reason - can
       he exchange it for the pig. The division of the horse  would
       result  in  the  destruction  of  its value. The hide, it is
       true, possesses an intrinsic value; and a dead  horse  makes
       excellent manure for a grapevine; nevertheless, the division
       of a horse results in the destruction  of  its  value  as  a
       living animal.  But if Peter barters his horse with Paul for
       an equivalent in wheat,  what  shall  prevent  him  from  so
       dividing  his  wheat as to qualify himself to offer to James
       an equivalent for his cow and to John an equivalent for  his
       pig?   If   Peter  trades  thus  with  James  and  John  the
       transaction is still barter,  though  the  wheat  serves  as
       currency  and  obviates  the  difficulty  in making change."
       [101]

           Thus currency (i.e, money) was born.  Many  things  have
       served  as money throughout the ages: slaves, gunpowder, and





                                  - 50 -



       even human skulls, to name but a few. The New Hebrides  used
       feathers  for their money and in Ethiopia salt circulated as
       the currency for centuries. But  by  far  the  most  popular
       medium  of  exchange  became  the  precious metals, gold and
       silver. There were several  reasons  for  this:  (1)  Unlike
       feathers  or  skulls,  they  have intrinsic value as metals.
       (2) They are sufficiently rare as to  impose  difficulty  in
       producing  them  and  sufficiently  common as to make it not
       impossible to do so. (3) Their value  fluctuates  relatively
       little  with  the passing of time. Even large strikes - such
       as those in California and Alaska - failed to  devalue  gold
       to  any appreciable extent. (4) They are particularly sturdy
       commodities, loosing relatively little due to the  wear  and
       tear  of  circulation.   (5)  They are easily divisible into
       fractional parts to facilitate small  purchases.  For  these
       and  other  reasons,  gold  and  silver  became  universally
       recognised as standards  of  value.  Certain  quantities  of
       these  metals  became  the  units  by which man measured the
       worth of an object. For example, the pound  sterling,  lira,
       and  ruble  were  originally terms for metallic weight while
       the drachma means literally a handful.

            As long as these metals served purely as  just  another
       commodity  to be bartered - albeit a very useful commodity -
       there was no inherent advantage in possessing  these  metals
       as such. It was not until governments declared them the sole
       LEGAL  medium  of  exchange  that  gold  and  silver  became
       intrinsically  oppressive.   Governments, by monetising gold
       and silver automatically demonetised  every  other  item  of
       capital.*   It  is  this  monopoly  which has been the chief
       obstacle in preventing men from  obtaining  the  product  of
       their  labour and which permitted the few men who controlled
       the money supply to roll  up  such  large  fortunes  at  the
       expense of labour.

            As long as the monetary structure was directly tied  to
       gold  and  silver,  the  volume  of money was limited by the
       amount of gold and silver available for coinage. It  is  for
       this reason that paper money - backed by "hard money" - came
       into being. The paper money was simply a promise "to pay the
       bearer  on  demand"  its  equivalent in specie (i.e. gold or

       --------------------
            * A natural question arises here: "That may  have  been
       true  up  until  40 years ago, but haven't governments since
       abandoned the gold standard?" The answer is no. As  long  as
       the  United  States government promises to buy and sell gold
       at $35 an ounce and as long as  the  International  Monetary
       Fund  (which stabilises the exchange rates) is based on gold
       and U.S. dollars, the world remains on the gold standard.

       silver). Hence the words  "note"  and  "bill,"  which  imply
       debt.  Governments  were  at  first reluctant to issue paper
       money.  But  the  scarcity  of  money  in  an   increasingly
       commercial  world  soon  forced  them  to recant. The men of
       wealth, well aware of the threat that "easy money" posed  to
       their "hard money," insisted that such money be based solely
       on the wealth they already  possessed.  Governments  readily
       fell  into  line.  In  the  United States, from 1866, anyone
       issuing circulating notes was slapped  with  a  tax  of  10%
       until  it  was  completely  outlawed  in  1936.  The British
       government was even more severe; it gave the Bank of England
       monopoly  rights  to  issue  "bank  notes" as early as 1844.
       [102]

            When a man is forced to barter his products for  money,
       in  order  to  have  money to barter for such other products
       that he might want,  he is put at a  disadvantage  which the
       capitalist is all too ready to  exploit.   William B. Greene
       was one of the first to observe this fact:

       "Society  established  gold  and  silver  as  a  circulating
       medium,  in  order  that  exchanges  of commodities might be
       FACILITATED; but society made a mistake in so doing; for  by
       this very act it gave to a certain class of men the power of
       saying what exchanges shall, and what exchanges  shall  not,
       be FACILITATED by means of this very circulating medium. The
       monopolisers of the precious metals have an undue power over
       the  community;  they  can say whether money shall, or shall
       not, be permitted  to  exercise  its  legitimate  functions.
       These  men have a VETO on the action of money, and therefore
       on exchanges of commodity; and they will not take off  their
       VETO  until  they  have  received  usury,  or, as it is more
       politely termed, interest on their money. Here is the  great
       objection  to  the  present  currency.  Behold the manner in
       which the absurdity inherent in a specie currency - or, what
       is  still  worse, in a currency of paper based upon specie -
       manifests itself in actual operation!  The  mediating  value
       which  society  hoped  would facilitate exchanges becomes an
       absolute marketable commodity, itself transcending all reach
       of  mediation. The great natural difficulty which originally
       stood in the way of exchanges is now the private property of
       a class, and this class cultivates this difficulty, and make
       money out of it, even as a farmer cultivates  his  farm  and
       makes money by his labour. But there is a difference between
       the farmer and the  usurer;  for  the  farmer  benefits  the
       community as well as himself, while every dollar made by the
       usurer is a dollar taken  from  the  pocket  of  some  other
       individual,  since  the  usurer  cultivates  nothing  but an
       actual obstruction." [103]





                                  - 52 -



            The  legitimate  purpose  of  money  is  to  facilitate
       exchange. As Greene shows, specie - or money based on specie
       - accomplishes this purpose, but only at a terrible price to
       the  user.  The solution to the problem is to devise a money
       which has no value as a COMMODITY,  only  as  a  circulating
       medium. This money should also be available in such quantity
       as not to hamper any exchanges which  may  be  desired.  The
       organ  for  creating such a currency Greene called a "mutual
       bank."*

            Before considering the operations of a mutual bank, I'd
       like  to  look at how an ordinary bank functions. Let us say
       that Mr Brown, who owns a farm worth a few thousand  pounds,
       needs  500  pounds  to buy seed and equipment for the coming
       year. Not having that kind of money on hand, he goes to  the
       bank  to  borrow  it.  The  bank  readily  agrees  -  on the
       condition that at the end of the year Brown  not  only  pays
       back  the 500 pounds borrowed, but also 50 pounds which they
       call "interest." Farmer Brown has no choice; he needs  MONEY
       because  that  is  all the seed dealer will accept as "legal
       tender." So he agrees to the  conditions  set  down  by  the
       bank. After a year of hard work, and with a bit of luck from
       the weather, he  harvests  his  crops  and  exchanges  (i.e.
       "sells") his produce - for money. He takes 550 pounds to the
       bank and cancels his debt. The net result  of  all  this  is
       that  some  banker  is  50 pounds richer for doing a minimal
       amount of work (perhaps a few hours of  bookkeeping)  at  no
       risk to himself (the farm was collateral), while Mr Brown is
       50 pounds out of pocket.

            Now let's see where Greene's idea leads us. A group  of
       people  get together and decide to set up a mutual bank. The
       bank will issue notes which all members of the bank agree to
       accept  as "money." Taking the above example, Mr Brown could
       get five hundred of these notes by mortgaging his  farm  and
       discounting with the bank a mortgage note for that sum. With
       the notes, he buys his seed from Smith and some  tools  from
       Jones.  Smith and Jones in turn exchange some of these newly
       acquired notes for some things they need. And  so  on  until
       the  end  of  the year when Brown exchanges his farm produce
       and receives for them - mutual bank  notes.  Does  all  this
       sound  familiar?  It  should,  for  up  until  now, from all
       outward appearances, there has been  no  difference  between
       our  mutual bank and an ordinary specie bank. But it's here,

       --------------------
            *  Proudhon's  bank,  "la   banque   du   peuple,"   is
       essentially  the  same.   For  a  detailed  account  of  the
       workings of each bank  see  Greene's  "Mutual  Banking"  and
       Proudhon's  "Solution of the Social Problem" and "Revolution
       in the Nineteenth Century."




                                  - 53 -



       however, that the change comes in.  Mr  Brown  goes  to  the
       mutual  bank  with  his notes and gives the bank 500 of them
       plus ONE OR TWO extra to help pay for the operating expenses
       of  the  bank  over  the  past  year.  The  bank cancels his
       mortgage and Mr Brown walks away thinking how nice it is  to
       be a member of such a wonderful bank.

            Now notice that it was never mentioned that  Smith  and
       Jones  were  members of the bank. They may have been, but it
       wasn't necessary. Smith, the seed dealer, might  not  belong
       to  the bank and yet be willing to accept its notes. He's in
       business, after all, and if the  only  money  Brown  has  is
       mutual  money, that's all right with him - as long as he can
       get rid of it when HE wants to buy something. And of  course
       he  can because he knows there are other members of the bank
       pledged to receiving these notes. Besides, Brown  will  need
       at  least 500 of them eventually to pay off his mortgage. So
       Smith accepts the money, and he too profits from this  novel
       scheme.  In fact, the only one who seems to be any the worse
       is the poor usurous banker. But I'm afraid he will just have
       to  find  himself an honest job and work for his living like
       everyone else.

            John   Stuart   Mill   defined   capital   as   "wealth
       appropriated  to  reproductive  employment."  In our example
       above, farmer Brown's 500 pounds is capital since he intends
       to  use it for creating new wealth. But Mr Brown can use his
       capital in any number of ways: he may decide to  use  it  to
       buy  seeds  for  planting  corn;  or  he may decide that his
       ground is better suited for growing wheat, or he may  decide
       to invest in a new tractor. This 500 pounds, then, is liquid
       capital or, as Greene called it, disengaged capital. When Mr
       Brown  buys  his  seeds  and  tools,  these things are still
       designed for "reproductive employment,"  and  are  therefore
       still  capital.  But what kind of capital? Evidently, frozen
       or engaged capital. He then plants his  seeds  and  harvests
       his  crops  with  the aid of his new tractor. The produce he
       grows is no longer capital because it is no  longer  capable
       of being "appropriated to reproductive employment."  What is
       it, then? Evidently, it is product. Mr Brown then takes  his
       goods  to  town  and sells them at market value for somewhat
       more than the 500 pounds he  originally  started  out  with.
       This "profit" is entirely due to his labour as a farmer (and
       perhaps to some extent his skill as a salesman).  The  money
       he  receives  for  his  goods  become,  once  again,  liquid
       capital.  So  we  have  came  full  circle:  liquid  capital
       becomes  frozen  capital;  frozen  capital  becomes product;
       product becomes liquid capital. And  the  cycle  starts  all
       over again.

            A society is prosperous when money flows freely -  that





                                  - 54 -



       is  when each man is able to easily convert his product into
       liquid capital. A society  is  unprosperous  when  money  is
       tight  -  that  is,  when  exchange  is difficult to effect.
       Mutual  banking  makes  as  much  money  available   as   is
       necessary.  When  a  man  needs  money he simply goes to his
       friendly mutual bank, mortgages some property, and  receives
       the notes of the bank in return. What this system does is to
       allow a man to circulate  his  CREDIT.  Whoever  goes  to  a
       mutual  bank  and mortgages some of his property will always
       receive money, for a mutual bank  can  issue  money  to  any
       extent.  This  money  will  always be good because it is all
       based on actual property which, if necessary, could be  sold
       to  pay  off  bad  debts.  The mutual bank, of course, would
       never give PERSONAL credit, for to  do  so  would  give  the
       notes  an element of risk and render them unstable. But what
       about the man with no property to pledge?   Greene  answered
       this question as follows:

       "If we knew of  a  plan  whereby,  through  an  act  of  the
       legislature,  every  member  of  the community might be made
       rich, we would destroy this petition  and  draw  up  another
       embodying  that  plan.   Meanwhile, we affirm that no system
       was ever devised so beneficial to the poor as the system  of
       mutual  banking;  for  if  a  man having nothing to offer in
       pledge, has a friend who  is  a  property  holder  and  that
       friend is willing to furnish security for him, he can borrow
       money at the mutual bank at a rate of 1%  interest  a  year;
       whereas, if he should borrow at the existing banks, he would
       be obliged to pay 6%. Again  as  mutual  banking  will  make
       money  exceedingly  plenty, it will cause a rise in the rate
       of wages, thus benefiting the man who has  no  property  but
       his  bodily  strength; and it will not cause a proportionate
       increase in the price of the necessaries of  life:  for  the
       price of provisions, etc., depends on supply and demand; and
       mutual banking operates, not directly on supply and  demand,
       but  to the diminution of the rate of interest on the medium
       of exchange. But certain  mechanics  and  farmers  say,  `We
       borrow  no  money,  and therefore pay no interest. How, then
       does this thing concern us?'  Harken,  my  friends!  let  us
       reason  together. I have an impression on my mind that it is
       precisely the class who have no dealings with the banks, and
       derive  no advantages from them, that ultimately pay all the
       interest money that is paid.  When  a  manufacturer  borrows
       money  to  carry  on his business, he counts the interest he
       pays as a part of  his  expenses,  and  therefore  adds  the
       amount  of  interest to the price of his goods. The consumer
       who buys the goods pays the interest when he  pays  for  the
       goods;  and who is the consumer, if not the mechanic and the
       farmer? If a manufacturer could borrow money at 1%, he could
       afford  to  undersell  all  his competitors, to the manifest
       advantage of the farmer and mechanic. The manufacturer would





                                  - 55 -



       neither  gain nor lose; the farmer and mechanic, who have no
       dealings with the bank, would gain the whole difference; and
       the  bank  -  which,  were it not for the competition of the
       mutual bank, would have loaned the money at  6%  interest  -
       would lose the whole difference. It is the indirect relation
       of the bank to the farmer and mechanic, and not  its  direct
       relation  to  the manufacturer and merchant, that enables it
       to make money." [104]

            Mutual banking, by broadening the currency base,  makes
       money  plentiful.  The  resulting stimulus to business would
       create an unprecedented demand for labour - a  demand  which
       would  always  be in excess of the supply. Then, as Benjamin
       Tucker observed:

       "When two labourers are after one employer, wages fall,  but
       when  two  employers  are  after  one  labourer, wages rise.
       Labour will then be in a position to dictate its wages,  and
       will  thus secure its natural wage, its entire product. Thus
       the same blow that strikes interest down will send wages up.
       But  this  is  not  all.   Down  will  go  profits also. For
       merchants, instead of buying at high prices on credit,  will
       borrow  money  of the banks at less than one percent, buy at
       low prices for cash, and correspondingly reduce  the  prices
       of their goods to their customers. And with the rest will go
       house-rent. For no one who can borrow capital at one percent
       with  which  to build a house of his own will consent to pay
       rent to a landlord at a higher rate than that." [105]

            Unlike the "boom and bust"  cycles  we  now  experience
       under  the  present system, mutualism would know nothing but
       "boom." For the present "busts" come  when  the  economy  is
       "overheated"  and  when there is so-called "overproduction."
       As long as most of humanity lead lives of abject poverty, we
       can  never  speak realistically of "over-production." And as
       long as each hungry  belly  comes  with  a  pair  of  hands,
       mutualism  will  be  there  to give those hands work to fill
       that belly.
