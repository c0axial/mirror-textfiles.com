                                (continued)

                           *   *   *   *   *

            Peter Kropotkin opens his chapter on  "Consumption  and
       Production"  in  "The  Conquest of Bread" with the following
       words:

       "If you open the works of any economist you will  find  that
       he  begins  with  PRODUCTION, the analysis of means employed
       nowadays for the creation of  wealth;  division  of  labour,
       manufacture,  machinery,  accumulation of capital. From Adam
       Smith to Marx, all have proceeded along these  lines.   Only
       in  the  latter  parts  of  their  books  do  they  treat of
       CONSUMPTION, that is to  say,  of  the  means  necessary  to
       satisfy  the  needs  of  individuals....Perhaps you will say
       this is logical. Before satisfying needs you must create the
       wherewithal  to satisfy them. But before producing anything,
       must you not feel the need of it? Is it not  necessity  that
       first drove man to hunt, to raise cattle, to cultivate land,
       to make implements, and later on to invent machinery? Is  it
       not  the  study of needs that should govern production?"[28]
       When I first came upon these  words,  I  must  admit  I  was
       rather  surprised.  "What  have we here," I thought, "is the
       prince of anarchist-communism actually going to come out  in
       favour  of  the  consumer?"  It didn't take long to find out
       that he wasn't. Most communists try very hard to ignore  the
       fact that the sole purpose of production is consumption. But
       not Kropotkin; he first recognises the fact -  and  THEN  he
       ignores it. It's only a matter of three pages before he gets
       his head back into the sand and talks of "how to  reorganise
       PRODUCTION so as to really satisfy all needs." [My emphasis]

            Under communism it is not the consumer that counts;  it
       is  the producer. The consumer is looked upon with scorn - a
       loathsome, if necessary, evil.  The  worker,  on  the  other
       hand,  is depicted as all that is good and heroic. It is not
       by accident that the hammer and sickle  find  themselves  as
       the  symbols  of  the  Russian  "workers' paradise." Can you
       honestly imagine a communist society raising the  banner  of
       bread and butter and declaring the advent of the "consumers'
       paradise"? If you can, your imagination is much  more  vivid
       than mine.

            But that's exactly what individualist-anarchists  would
       do.   Instead  of the communist's "workers' control" (i.e. a
       producers' democracy), we advocate a  consumers'  democracy.
       Both  democracies  - like all democracies - would in fact be




                                  - 15 -



       dictatorships.  The  question  for   anarchists   is   which
       dictatorship  is  the least oppressive? The answer should be
       obvious. But,  judging  from  the  ratio  of  communists  to
       individualists  in  the  anarchist movement, apparently it's
       not. So perhaps I'd better explain.

            The workers in some given industry decide that  item  A
       should   no   longer  be  produced  and  decide  instead  to
       manufacture item B. Now consumer X, who never liked  item  A
       anyway,  couldn't  care less; but poor Y feels his life will
       never be the same without A. What can Y do? He's just a lone
       consumer  and  consumers have no rights in this society. But
       maybe other Y's agree with him. A survey is taken and it  is
       shown that only 3% of all consumers regret the passing of A.
       But can't some compromise be arrived at? How  about  letting
       just one tiny factory make A's? Perhaps the workers agree to
       this accommodation. Perhaps not. In any  case  the  workers'
       decision  is  final. There is no appeal. The Y's are totally
       at the mercy of the workers and if the decision is  adverse,
       they'll  just  have  to swallow hard and hope that next week
       item C isn't taken away as well. So much for the  producers'
       dictatorship.

            Let's now take a look at the  consumers'  dictatorship.
       Consumers  are  finicky people - they want the best possible
       product at the lowest possible price. To  achieve  this  end
       they  will use ruthless means. The fact that producer X asks
       more for his product than Y asks for his similar product  is
       all that the consumer needs to know. He will mercilessly buy
       Y's over X's. The extenuating circumstances matter little to
       him.  X  may  have ten children and a mother-in-law to feed.
       The consumer still buys from Y. Such is the  nature  of  the
       consumers' dictatorship over the producer.

            Now there is a fundamental difference between these two
       dictatorships.  In  the one the worker says to the consumer,
       "I will produce what I want and if you don't like it you can
       lump it." In the other the consumer says to the worker, "You
       will produce what I want and if you don't  I  will  take  my
       business  elsewhere." It doesn't take the sensitive antennae
       of an anarchist to see which of these two statements is  the
       more  authoritarian.  The first leaves no room for argument;
       there are no exceptions,  no  loopholes  for  the  dissident
       consumer  to  crawl  through. The second, on the other hand,
       leaves a loophole so big that it  is  limited  only  by  the
       worker's  imagination  and  abilities.  If a producer is not
       doing as well as his competitor, there's a reason for it. He
       may not be suited for that particular work, in which case he
       will change jobs. He may be charging too much for his  goods
       or  services, in which case he will have to lower his costs,
       profits, and/or overhead to meet the  competition.  But  one





                                  - 16 -



       thing  should  be made clear: each worker is also a consumer
       and what the individual looses in his role  as  producer  by
       having  to  cut  his  costs  down  to the competitive market
       level, he makes up in his role as consumer by being able  to
       buy at the lowest possible prices.*

                           *   *   *   *   *

            Let  us  turn  our  attention  now   to   the   various
       philosophies  used  by  communists  to  justify their social
       system. The exponents of any social change invariably  claim
       that  people  will be "happier" under their system than they
       now are under the status quo. The big metaphysical  question
       then  becomes,  "What  is  happiness?" Up until recently the
       communists - materialists par excellence - used  to  say  it
       was  material  well-being.  The  main gripe they had against
       capitalism was that the workers were NECESSARILY in a  state
       of increasing poverty. Bakunin, echoing Marx, said that "the
       situation  of  the  proletariat...by  virtue  of  inevitable
       economic  law,  must and will become worse every year." [29]
       But since World War II this pillar of communist thought  has
       become  increasingly  shaky  -  particularly  in  the United
       States where "hard hats" are now pulling in salaries upwards
       of  four  quid  an  hour.  This  fact has created such acute
       embarrassment among the faithful that  many  communists  are
       now  seeking a new definition of happiness which has nothing
       to do with material comfort.

            Very often what  they  do  in  discarding  the  Marxist
       happiness  albatross is to saddle themselves with a Freudian
       one.** The new  definition  of  happiness  our  neo-Freudian
       communists  arrive  at  is  usually  derived  from what Otto
       Fenichel called the "Nirvana

       --------------------

            *  The  usual  objection  raised   to   a   "consumers'
       democracy"  is  that  capitalists  have  used  similar catch
       phrases in order to justify capitalism and keep the  workers
       in  a  subjugated  position.   Individualists  sustain  this
       objection  but  point  out  that   capitalists   are   being
       inconsistent  by  not  practicing  what they preach. If they
       did, they would no longer be in  a  position  of  privilege,
       living off the labour of others. This point is made clear in
       the section on capitalism later in this article.
            ** Wilhelm Reich and R. D. Laing are among  the  latest
       gurus  of  the  libertarian  left.  And it's not uncommon in
       anarchist circles to hear  a  few  sympathetic  words  about
       Herbert  Marcuse's  "Eros  and  Civilisation,"  despite  the
       author's totalitarian tendencies.





                                  - 17 -



       principle." The essence of this theory is  that  both  life-
       enhancing  behaviour  (e.g.  sexual intercourse, eating) and
       life-inhibiting   behaviour    (e.g.   war,   suicide)   are
       alternative ways of escaping from tension. Thus Freud's life
       instinct and death instinct  find  their  common  ground  in
       Nirvana   where   happiness  means  a  secure  and  carefree
       existence. This sounds to me very much  like  the  Christian
       conception of heaven. But with communism, unlike heaven, you
       don't have to give up your  life  to  get  in  -  just  your
       humanity.

            Homer  Lane  used  to  have  a  little  anecdote  which
       illustrates the point I'm trying to make about the communist
       idea of happiness:

       "A  dog  and  a  rabbit  are  running  down  a  field.  Both
       apparently are doing the same thing, running and using their
       capacity to the full.  Really there is  a  great  difference
       between them. Their motives are different. One is happy, the
       other unhappy. The dog is happy because he is trying  to  do
       something  with  the  hope  of  achieving  it. The rabbit is
       unhappy because he  is  afraid.  A  few  minutes  later  the
       position  is reversed; the rabbit has reached his burrow and
       is  inside  panting,  whilst  the  dog  is  sitting  outside
       panting.  The  rabbit  is  now happy because it is safe, and
       therefore no longer afraid. The dog is unhappy  because  his
       hope  has  not been realised.  Here we have the two kinds of
       happiness of which each one of us  is  capable  -  happiness
       based  on the escape from danger, and happiness based on the
       fulfillment of a hope, which is the  only  true  happiness."
       [30]

            I leave it to the reader as an exercise  in  triviality
       to   decide  which  of  these  two  types  of  happiness  is
       emphasised by communism. While on the subject of  analogies,
       I'd  like  to  indulge  in one of my own. Generally speaking
       there are two kinds of cats: the "lap cat" and the "mouser."
       The  former leads a peaceful existence, leaving granny's lap
       only long enough to make a discreet trip to its sandbox  and
       to  lap  up  a  saucer of milk. The latter lives by catching
       mice in the farmer's barn and never goes near the inside  of
       the  farm  house.  The  former is normally fat and lazy; the
       latter skinny and alert. Despite the lap cat's easier  life,
       the  mouser  wouldn't  exchange places with him if he could,
       while the lap cat COULDN'T exchange places if he would. Here
       we  have two cats - perhaps even from the same litter - with
       two completely different  attitudes  toward  life.  The  one
       expects  a  clean  sandbox  and food twice a day - and he is
       rarely disappointed. The other has to work for a living, but
       generally  finds  the reward worth while. "Now what has this
       got to do with the subject at hand?" I hear  you  cry.  Just





                                  - 18 -



       this:  the  communists would make "lap cats" of us all. "But
       what's so bad about that?" you may ask.  To  which  I  would
       have  to  reply (passing over the stinky problem of WHO will
       change the sandbox), "Have you ever tried to `domesticate' a
       mouser?"

            Communism, in its quest  for  a  tranquil,  tensionless
       world,  inevitably  harks back to the Middle Ages. Scratch a
       communist  and  chances  are  pretty  good  you'll  find   a
       mediaevalist underneath.  Paul Goodman, for example, derives
       his ideal "community of scholars"  from  Bologna  and  Paris
       models  based  in  the  eleventh and twelfth centuries. [31]
       Erich Fromm writes longingly of "the sense of security which
       was  characteristic of man in the Middle Ages....In having a
       distinct, unchangeable,  and  unquestionable  place  in  the
       social  world  from the moment of birth, man was rooted in a
       structuralised whole, and thus life had a meaning which left
       no  place,  and  no  need, for doubt. A person was identical
       with his role in society; he was a peasant,  an  artisan,  a
       knight,  and  not AN INDIVIDUAL who HAPPENED to have this or
       that occupation. The social order was conceived as a natural
       order, and being a definite part of it gave man a feeling of
       security and of belonging. There  was  comparatively  little
       competition.  One  was born into a certain economic position
       which guaranteed a livelihood determined by tradition.  [32]
       Kropotkin  goes even further than Fromm. I'd like to examine
       his position in some detail  because  I  think  it  is  very
       instructive of how the communist mentality works. In perhaps
       his best-known book, "Mutual Aid," Kropotkin devotes two  of
       its  eight  chapters to glorifying the Middle Ages, which he
       boldly claim were  one  of  "the  two  greatest  periods  of
       [mankind's]  history."  [33]  (The  other  one being ancient
       Greece. He doesn't say how he reconciles this with the  fact
       that  Greece  was  based firmly on a foundation of slavery).
       "No  period  of  history   could   better   illustrate   the
       constructive powers of the popular masses than the tenth and
       eleventh centuries...but, unhappily, this is a period  about
       which  historical  information is especially scarce." [34] I
       wonder why? Could it be that everyone was having such a good
       time  that  no one found time to record it? Kropotkin writes
       of  the  mediaeval  cities  as  "centres  of   liberty   and
       enlightenment." [35] The mediaeval guilds, he says, answered
       "a deeply inrooted want of human nature," [36] calling  them
       "organisations for maintaining justice." [37] Let's see what
       Kropotkin means here by "justice":

       "If a brother's house is burned, or he has lost his ship, or
       has  suffered  on  a pilgrim's voyage, all the brethren MUST
       come to his aid. If a brother  falls  dangerously  ill,  two
       brethren  MUST  keep  watch  by  his  bed  till he is out of
       danger, and if he dies, the brethren must bury him - a great





                                  - 19 -



       affair  in  those  times of pestilences [Kropotkin must have
       been dozing to admit this in his Utopia] - and follow him to
       the  church and the grave. After his death they MUST provide
       for his children....If a brother was involved in  a  quarrel
       with a stranger to the guild, they agreed to support him for
       bad and for good; that is, whether he was  unjustly  accused
       of  aggression,  OR  REALLY  WAS  THE AGGRESSOR, they HAD to
       support him....They went to court to  support  by  oath  the
       truthfulness  of  his statements, and if he was found guilty
       they did not let him go to full  ruin  and  become  a  slave
       through  not  paying  the  due  compensation;  they all paid
       it....Such were the  leading  ideas  of  those  brotherhoods
       which  gradually  covered the whole of mediaeval life." [38]
       (My emphasis)

       And such is Kropotkin's conception of "justice," which could
       better be described as a warped sense of solidarity. He goes
       on to say, "It is evident that an institution so well suited
       to serve the need of union, without depriving the individual
       of his initiative, could but  spread,  grow,  and  fortify."
       [39]  "We  see  not  only merchants, craftsmen, hunters, and
       peasants united in guilds; we also see  guilds  of  priests,
       painters,  teachers  of  primary  schools  and universities,
       guilds for performing  the  passion  play,  for  building  a
       church,  for  developing  the `mystery' of a given school of
       art or craft, or for a  special  recreation  -  even  guilds
       among  beggars,  executioners, and lost women, all organised
       on the same double principle of self-jurisdiction and mutual
       support."   [40]  It  was  such  "unity  of  thought"  which
       Kropotkin thinks "can but excite our admiration." [41]
