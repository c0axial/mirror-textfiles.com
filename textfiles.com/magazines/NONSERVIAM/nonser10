Editor's Word:
_____________

  Stirner is a philosopher who is easy to misunderstand, as Sidney
Parker shows in his article "The Egoism of Max Stirner" below. Ones
first attention to Stirner very often comes from political or
ideological motivations. And so, with the expectation of finding
an author whose idea is a flaming insurrective rhetoric, one finds
- just that. And if one is a critic, like Camus mentioned by Parker,
or even a contemporary like Moses Hess [1], one is easily led to
believe that Stirner is just advocating a new _idea_ for which to
live and breathe, a new Object which is supposed to be the new centre
of ones attention, a new idea which is to be universalized and put in
the service of a political ideology - the Ego.
  But if we read what he has written, we find, like in "The False
Principle of Our Education" that his main focus is the discovery of
the self as truly Subject, and not just an Object. In the False
Principle Stirner makes the distinction between learning as an Object
into whom knowledge is stuffed from without, and learning as
a Subject acquiring knowledge for itself. In "Art and Religion" we
find him speaking of the conception of [future] self set up as an
Ideal: "Here lie all the sufferings and struggles of the centuries,
for it is fearful to be _outside_of_oneself_, having yourself as an
Object set over and against oneself able to annihilate itself and so
oneself."
  Further clues can be given in that Stirner speaks of himself as
No-thing [2], "In the Unique One the owner himself returns to his
creative nothing, of which he is born." No thing, neither as some
kind of thought, nor as a percept, am I. [3] So, we conclude that
Stirner's unnameable Unique One is the Subject.

  Looking at the consequences of this, one sees that indeed we all
are Subjects, actors who pursue this and that by our own creation. In
this, we are egoists already. However, unless this is a condition of
which we are conscious, it will do us little good, and we might as
well follow this Ideal as that, in that we do not know ourselves from
within, but only as "intimate objects".
  The famous formula from Gal. 2.29, "Not I live, but Christ lives in
me" is quoted and paraphrased by Stirner as the basic teaching of the
possessed: "Not I live, but X lives in me." This is where Stirner's
philosophy is of interest. For while Luther may say "Here I stand, I
can do naught else!", Stirner teaches the liberation from fixed ideas
in creating oneself each day anew.
  As the quote at the end of this edition of the newsletter shows,
this is also the way to finding a well of love that can be consumed
with all ones selfish desire without ever going dry.

[1] Hess criticism of Stirner boils down to "Ego[ism] is empty." But
    as is evident, Hess' criticism is of Ego as object, and he has
    not grasped the subtlety in Stirner's description of the Subject
    as no-thing. Thus Hess simply shows his lack of understanding.

[2] I am taking the liberty of utilizing the English language here.

[3] Notice the affinity with some of Buddhism's teachings. In the
    teaching of Buddha you are told to seek through the phenomena to
    see if you find the Self there, a search that will ultimately
    end in failure. Stirner provides the positive side of this coin
    by providing the I as he who fails in this search.

Sidney Parker:

                The Egoism of Max Stirner
                -------------------------


(The following extracts are taken from my booklet entitled THE 
EGOISM OF MAX STIRNER: SOME CRITICAL BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTES to be 
published by the Mackay Society of New York)

        Albert Camus

  Camus devotes a section of THE REBEL to Stirner. Despite a fairly 
accurate summarization of some of Stirner's ideas he nonetheless 
consigns him to dwelling in a desert of isolation and negation 
"drunk with destruction". Camus accuses Stirner of going "as far as 
he can in blasphemy" as if in some strange way an atheist like 
Stirner can "blaspheme" against something he does not believe in. He 
proclaims that Stirner is "intoxicated" with the "perspective" of 
"justifying" crime without mentioning that Stirner carefully 
distinguishes between the ordinary criminal and the "criminal" as 
violator of the "sacred". He brands Stirner as the direct ancestor 
of "terrorist anarchy" when in fact Stirner regards political 
terrorists as acting under the possession of a "spook". He 
furthermore misquotes Stirner by asserting that he "specifies" in 
relation to other human beings "kill them, do not martyr them" when 
in fact he writes  "I can kill them, not torture them" - and this in 
relation to the moralist who both kills and tortures to serve the 
"concept of  the 'good'".

  Although throughout his book Camus is concerned to present "the 
rebel" as a preferred alternative to "the revolutionary" he nowhere 
acknowledges that this distinction is taken from the one that 
Stirner makes between "the revolutionary" and "the insurrectionist". 
That this should occur in a work whose purpose is a somewhat frantic 
attempt at rehabilitating "ethics" well illustrates Stirner's ironic 
statement that "the hard fist of morality treats the noble nature of 
egoism altogether without compassion."


        Eugene Fleischmann

  Academic treatment of Stirner is often obfuscating even when it is 
not downright hostile. A marked contrast is Fleischmann's essay 
STIRNER, MARX AND HEGEL which is included in the symposium HEGEL'S 
POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY. Clearly preferring Stirner to Marx, 
Fleischmann presents a straightforward account of his ideas 
unencumbered by "psychiatric" interpretations and _ad_hominem_ 
arguments. He correctly points out that the "human self" signifies 
for Stirner "the individual in all his indefinable, empirical 
concreteness. The word 'unique' [einzig] means for Stirner man as he 
is in his irreducible individuality, always different from his 
fellows, and always thrown back on himself in his dealings with 
them. Thus, when he talks of 'egoism' as the ultimate definition os 
the human 'essence' it is not at all a question of a moral category 
. . . . but of a simple existential fact."

  Fleischmann contends that "Marx and Engels' critique of Stirner is 
notoriously misleading. It is not just that ridicule of a man's 
person is not equivalent to refutation of his ideas, for the reader 
is also aware that the authors are not reacting at all to the 
problems raised by their adversary." Stirner is not simply "just 
another doctrinaire ideologue". His "reality is the world of his 
immediate experience" and he wants "to come into his own power now, 
not after some remote and hypothetical 'proletarian revolution'. 
Marx and Engels had nothing to offer the individual in the present: 
Stirner has."

  In his conclusion Fleischmann states that Stirner's view that the 
individual "must find his entire satisfaction in his own life" is a 
reversion "to the resigned attitude of a simple mortal". This is not 
a serious criticism. If I cannot find satisfaction in my own life, 
where can I find it? Even if it is _my_ satisfaction that I 
experience, any satisfaction that the other may have being something 
that he or she experiences - not _me_. If this constitutes being a 
"simple mortal" then so be it, but that it is a "resigned attitude" 
is another matter.


        Benedict Lachmann and Herbert Stourzh

  Lachmann's and Stourzh's TWO ESSAYS ON EGOISM provide a 
stimulating and instructive introduction to Stirner's ideas. 
Although both authors give a good summary of his egoism they differ 
sufficiently in their approach to allow the reader to enjoy 
adjudicating between them.

  Lachmann's essay PROTAGORAS - NIETZSCHE - STIRNER traces the 
development of relativist thinking as exemplified in the three 
philosophers of its title. Protagoras is the originator of 
relativism with his dictum "Man (the individual) is the measure of 
all things". This in turn is taken up by Stirner and Nietzsche. Of 
the two, however, Stirner is by far the most consistent and for this 
reason Lachmann places him after Nietzsche in his account. For him 
Stirner surpasses Nietzsche by bringing Protagorean relativism to 
its logical conclusion in conscious egoism - the fulfilment of one's 
own will.

  In fact, he views Nietzsche as markedly inferior to Stirner both 
in respect to his style and the clarity of his thinking. "In 
contrast to Nietzsche's work," he writes, THE EGO AND ITS OWN "is 
written in a clear, precise form and language, though it avoids the 
pitfalls of a dry academic style. Its sharpness, clarity and passion 
make the book truly shattering and overwhelming." Unlike 
Nietzsche's, Stirner's philosophy does not lead to the replacement 
of one religious "spook" by another, the substitution of the 
"Superman" for the Christian "God". On the contrary, it makes "the 
individual's interests the centre of the world."

  Intelligent, lucid and well-conceived, Lachmann's essay throws new 
light on Stirner's ideas.

  Its companion essay, Stourzh's MAX STIRNER'S PHILOSOPHY OF THE EGO 
is evidently the work of a theist, but it is nonetheless sympathetic 
to Stirnerian egoism. Stourzh states that one of his aims in writing 
it "is beyond the categories of master and slave to foster an 
intellectual and spiritual stand-point different from the 
stand-point prescribed by the prophets of mass thinking, the 
dogmatists of socialism, who conceive of the individual only as an 
insignificant part of the whole, as a number or mere addenda of the 
group."

  Stourzh draws a valuable distinction between the "imperative" 
approach of the moralist and the "indicative" approach of Stirner 
towards human behaviour. He also gives an informative outline of the 
critical reaction to Stirner of such philosophers as Ludwig 
Feuerbach, Kuno Fischer and Eduard von Hartman. Stourzh mars his 
interpretation, however, by making the nonsensical claim that 
Stirner's egoism "need in no sense mean the destruction of the 
divine mystery itself." And in line with his desire to preserve the 
"sacredness" of this "divine mystery" he at times patently seeks to 
"sweeten" Stirner by avoiding certain of his most challenging 
remarks.

          certain and  liberal  as the business  of banking and
          exchange,  and  it is proper  that it should  be open
          as far as  practicable  to the  most free competition
          and its  advantages shared by  all classes of people."

                   - Chief Justice Roger B. Taney, 1837




            When it comes to economics, most anarchists  reveal  an
       ignorance verging on the indecent. For example, in the first
       piece of the first issue of the new "Anarchy" the California
       Libertarian  Alliance  talks  in  all seriousness of "Marx's
       `labour theory of value,' which causes communist governments
       to  repress  homosexuals."  [98]  Now, passing over the fact
       that Adam Smith developed the principles of this theory long
       before  Marx  was  even born, I can't for the life of me see
       what  the  labour  theory  of  value  has  to  do  with  the
       repression  of  homosexuals - be they communist, capitalist,
       or mercantilist. Kropotkin was no better; in  his  "Conquest
       of Bread" he shows a total lack of any economic sense, as he
       amply demonstrates by his rejection of the  very  foundation
       of  any rational economic system: the division of labour. "A
       society that will satisfy the needs of all, and  which  will
       know  how  to  organise production, will also have to make a
       clean sweep of several prejudices concerning  industry,  and
       first  of  all  of the theory often preached by economists -
       The Division of Labour  Theory  -  which  we  are  going  to
       discuss   in   the   next  chapter....It  is  this  horrible
       principle, so noxious to  society,  so  brutalising  to  the
       individual,  source  of  so  much  harm,  that we propose to
       discuss in its divers manifestations." [99]  He  then  fills
       the  next  two  pages  of  perhaps  the  shortest chapter in
       history with a discussion of  this  theory  "in  its  divers
       manifestations."  In these few paragraphs he fancies himself
       as having overturned the economic thought of  centuries  and
       to  have  struck  "a  crushing  blow  at  the  theory of the
       division of labour which was supposed to be so sound." [100]
       Let's see just how sound it is.

            Primitive man discovered two great advantages to social
       life.  The  first  was  man's ability to gain knowledge, not
       only through  personal  experience,  but  also  through  the
       experience  of others. By learning from others, man was able
       to acquire knowledge which he could never have gained alone.





                                  - 47 -



       This knowledge was handed down from generation to generation
       -  growing  with  each  passing  year,  until  today   every
       individual  has  at  his  fingertips a wealth of information
       which took thousands of years to acquire. The  second  great
       advantage  of  social  life was man's discovery of trade. By
       being able to exchange goods, man  discovered  that  he  was
       able  to  concentrate  his  efforts  on a particular task at
       which he was especially  good  and/or  which  he  especially
       liked.  He  could  then trade the products of his labour for
       the products of the labour  of  others  who  specialised  in
       other  fields.  This  was found to be mutually beneficial to
       all concerned.

            That the  division  of  labour  is  beneficial  when  A
       produces one thing better than B and when B produces another
       thing better than A was obvious even to  the  caveman.  Each
       produces  that  which he does best and trades with the other
       to their mutual advantage. But what happens when A  produces
       BOTH  things  better  than  B?  David  Ricardo answered this
       question when he expounded his law of association  over  150
       years  ago.  This  law  is  best  illustrated  by a concrete
       example. Let us say that Jones can produce one pair of shoes
       in  3  hours  compared  to Smith's 5 hours.  Also let us say
       that Jones can produce  one  bushel  of  wheat  in  2  hours
       compared to Smith's 4 hours (cf. Table I). If each man is to
       work 120  hours,  what  is  the  most  advantageous  way  of
       dividing  up  the  work? Table II shows three cases: the two
       extremes where one man does only one job while the other man
       does  the  other, and the middle road where each man divides
       his time equally between jobs. It is clear  from  Table  III
       that  it  is  to  the  advantage  of  BOTH men that the most
       productive man should devote ALL of his energies to the  job
       which  he  does best (relative to the other) while the least
       productive man concentrates his energies on  the  other  job
       (case  3).  It  is  interesting  to note that in the reverse
       situation (case 1) - which is also the least productive case
       -  the  drop  in productivity is only 6% for Jones (the best
       worker), while  for  Smith  it's  a  whopping  11%.  So  the
       division  of  labour,  while helping both men, tends to help
       the least productive worker more  than  his  more  efficient
       workmate  -  a fact which opponents of this idea should note
       well.

            These figures show something which  is  pretty  obvious
       intuitively.   A  skilled surgeon, after many years invested
       in schooling, internship, practice, etc., may find his  time
       more  productively  spent  in actually performing operations
       than in washing his surgical instruments in preparation  for
       these  operations.  It  would seem natural, then, for him to
       hire a medical student (say for 1 pound per hour) to do  the
       washing up job while he does the operating (for say 3 pounds

       per  hour).  Even  if  the  surgeon  could  wash   his   own
       instruments  twice  as fast as the student, this division of
       labour would be profitable for all concerned.

            If the earth were a homogeneous sphere, equally endowed
       with  natural  resources  at  each  and  every  point of its
       surface, and if each man were equally capable of  performing
       every  task  as  well as his neighbour, then the division of
       labour would have no ECONOMIC meaning.  There  would  be  no
       material  advantage  to letting someone else do for you what
       you could do equally well  yourself.  But  the  division  of
       labour  would  have  arisen  just  the  same  because of the
       variety of human tastes. It is a fact of human  nature  that
       not  all  people  like  doing the same things. Kropotkin may
       think this unfortunate, but I'm afraid that's the way  human
       beings  are  built.  And as long as this is the case, people
       are going to WANT to specialise their labour and trade their
       products with one another.
