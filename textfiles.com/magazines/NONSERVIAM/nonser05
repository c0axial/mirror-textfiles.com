Ken Knudson:

                          A Critique of Communism
                                    and
                       The Individualist Alternative
                                (continued)


 
            But where did the common labourer fit  into  all  this?
       Kropotkin  makes  the  remarkable generalisation that "at no
       time has labour enjoyed such conditions  of  prosperity  and
       such   respect."  [42]  As  proof  he  cites  the  "glorious
       donations" [43] the workers gave to the  cathedrals.  These,
       he says, "bear testimony of their relative well-being." [44]
       (Just as the Taj  Mahal  bears  testimony  of  the  relative
       well-being   of  the  people  of  India,  no  doubt).  "Many
       aspirations of our modern radicals were already realised  in
       the  Middle  Ages  [and]  much  of  what is described now as
       Utopian was accepted then as a matter of fact." [45]

            As for the material achievements of  the  Middle  Ages,
       Kropotkin  can't find a superlative super enough to describe
       them - but he tries:

       "The very face of Europe had  been  changed.  The  land  was
       dotted  with  rich cities, surrounded by immense thick walls
       [I wonder why?] which were embellished by towers and  gates,
       each  of  them  a  work  of  art  in itself. The cathedrals,





                                  - 20 -



       conceived in a grand style and profusely  decorated,  lifted
       their  bell-towers to the skies, displaying a purity of form
       and a boldness of imagination which we now vainly strive  to
       attain....[He  displays  a  bit of `boldness of imagination'
       himself (to be quite charitable) when he goes  on  to  say:]
       Over  large tracts of land well-being had taken the place of
       misery; learning  had  grown  and  spread.  The  methods  of
       science had been elaborated; the basis of natural philosophy
       had been laid down; and the way had been paved for  all  the
       mechanical  inventions  of which our own times are so proud.
       Such were the magic [sic] changes accomplished in Europe  in
       less than four hundred years." [46]

            Just what were these "magic changes" of which Kropotkin
       is  so  proud?  He lists about a dozen. [47] Among them are:
       printing (neglecting to inform us that the  Gutenberg  press
       was  invented  in  the  middle of the 15th century, sometime
       after the mediaeval  cities  "degenerated  into  centralised
       states");   steelmaking   (neglecting   to  inform  us  that
       steelmaking had been mentioned in the works of Homer and was
       used  continuously since that time); glassmaking (neglecting
       to inform us that the Encyclopaedia Britannica - to which he
       contributed  numerous  articles - devotes to the Middle Ages
       all of two sentences of a 27 page article on the history  of
       glassmaking); the telescope (neglecting to inform us that it
       wasn't even invented until 1608); gunpowder and the  compass
       (neglecting to inform us that the Chinese lay earlier claims
       to both of these inventions); algebra (neglecting to  inform
       us  that  algebra was in common use in ancient Babylonia and
       that, although being introduced to mediaeval Europe  by  the
       Arabs,  no  important  contributions  were made by Europeans
       until the Renaissance); the decimal  system  (neglecting  to
       inform  us  that  the  Hindus  invented  the  system about a
       thousand years before it gained any ground in Europe in  the
       17th century); calendar reform (neglecting to inform us that
       although Roger Bacon suggested such reform to  the  Pope  in
       the  13th century, no action was taken until 300 years later
       under the reign of Pope Gregory  XIII  in  1582);  chemistry
       (neglecting  to inform us of an earlier work of his where he
       said  chemistry  was  "entirely  a  product  of  our  [19th]
       century."  [48])  Indeed  the  only  things  he  mentions as
       products of the Middle Ages which stand  up  under  scrutiny
       are  counterpoint  and, paradoxically, the mechanical clock.
       To top it all off, he then has the gall to cite Galileo  and
       Copernicus   as  being  "direct  descendents"  of  mediaeval
       science [49] - somehow managing  to  ignore  the  fact  that
       Galileo  spent  the last eight years of his life under house
       arrest for supporting the Copernican theory, thanks to  that
       grand mediaeval institution, the Inquisition.

            You may be wondering why the people of the Middle  Ages





                                  - 21 -



       let  such  a  Utopia  slip  through their fingers. Kropotkin
       cites foreign invasions -  notably  those  of  the  Mongols,
       Turks,  and  Moors  [50] - but makes it quite clear that the
       "greatest and most fatal error of most cities  was  to  bass
       their  wealth  upon  commerce and industry." [51] So here we
       have  it  laid  bare  for  all  to  see:  Kropotkin's  ideal
       community  would not only return  us to  the  dark ages, but
       would take away the one thing that could  bring  us  back  -
       commerce and industry.

            Rudolf Rocker, the darling of the anarcho-syndicalists,
       similarly  eulogises  the  Middle  Ages.  He, too, felt that
       mediaeval man led a "rich life" [52] which  gave  "wings  to
       his  spirit and prevent[ed] his mental stagnation." [53] But
       unlike Kropotkin - who chalked up  mediaeval  solidarity  to
       man's  innate  "nature"  - Rocker (correctly) explains these
       "fraternal associations" by means of  a  most  unanarchistic
       concept - Christianity:

       "Mediaeval man felt himself to be bound up  with  a  single,
       uniform  culture,  a  member  of a great community extending
       over all countries, in whose bosom all  people  found  their
       place.  It  was  the community of Christendom which included
       all  the  scattered  units  of  the  Christian   world   and
       spiritually   unified  them....The  deeper  the  concept  of
       Christianity took root in men, the easier they overcame  all
       barriers  between  themselves  and  others, and the stronger
       lived in them the consciousness that  all  belonged  to  one
       great community and strove toward a common goal." [54]

            So we  see  that  the  glue  that  held  these  idyllic
       mediaeval  communities  together was not Kropotkin's "mutual
       aid," but rather Christian mysticism. Rocker was  perceptive
       enough  to  see this; Kropotkin apparently was not. But what
       both of these men failed to see was that  mysticism  is  the
       necessary  glue  of  ANY  communist  society.   The mystical
       Garden of Eden is the ultimate goal of every church  of  the
       communist  religion.  Unfortunately, as every good Christian
       will tell you, the only way you can stay in  the  Garden  of
       Eden  is to abstain from the "tree of knowledge." Communists
       are apparently willing to pay this price. Individualists are
       not.  It  is  communism's intention to carry religion to its
       ultimate absurdity: it would sacrifice man on the  cross  of
       altruism for the sake of - Man.

            I'd like  to  end  my  diatribe  against  communism  by
       quoting  another one.  This is what one prophetic Frenchman,
       Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, had to  say  about  communism  eight
       years  before  the  "Communist  Manifesto"  appeared  like a




                                  - 22 -



       spectre to haunt Europe - and like a good French  wine,  his
       words seem to have improved with age:

       "Communism - or association  in  a  simple  form  -  is  the
       necessary  object  and  original  aspiration  of  the social
       nature, the spontaneous movement by which it  manifests  and
       establishes   itself.   It  is  the  first  phase  of  human
       civilisation. In this state of society, - which the  jurists
       have  called  `negative communism', - man draws near to man,
       and shares with him the fruits of the field and the milk and
       flesh of animals. Little by little this communism - negative
       as long as man does not produce - tends to  become  positive
       and  organic through the development of labour and industry.
       But it is then that the  sovereignty  of  thought,  and  the
       terrible  faculty  of  reasoning  logically  or illogically,
       teach man that, if equality is the sine qua non of  society,
       communism   is   the   first   species   of   slavery....The
       disadvantages of communism are so obvious that  its  critics
       never  have  needed  to  employ much eloquence to thoroughly
       disgust men with it. The  irreparability  of  the  injustice
       which  it  causes, the violence which it does to attractions
       and repulsions, the yoke of iron which it fastens  upon  the
       will, the moral torture to which it subjects the conscience,
       the debilitating effect which it has upon society;  and,  to
       sum  it  all  up,  the  pious and stupid uniformity which it
       enforces upon  the  free,  active,  reasoning,  unsubmissive
       personality of man, have shocked common sense, and condemned
       communism by an  irrevocable  decree.  The  authorities  and
       examples  cited  in  its favour disprove it. The communistic
       republic  of  Plato  involved  slavery;  that  of   Lycurgus
       employed  Helots,  whose  duty  it  was to produce for their
       masters, thus  enabling  the  latter  to  devote  themselves
       exclusively  to  athletic  sports  and  to  war,  Even J. J.
       Rousseau - confounding communism and  equality  -  has  said
       somewhere  that,  without slavery, he did not think equality
       of conditions possible. The communities of the early  Church
       did  not  last  the  first century out, and soon degenerated
       into monasteries....The greatest danger to which society  is
       exposed  today  is  that  of another shipwreck on this rock.
       Singularly enough, systematic  communism  -  the  deliberate
       negation  of  property  -  is  conceived  under  the  direct
       influence of the proprietary prejudice; and property is  the
       basis   of  all  communistic  theories.  The  members  of  a
       community, it is true, have no  private  property;  but  the
       community  is  proprietor,  and  proprietor  not only of the
       goods, but of the persons and wills. In consequence of  this
       principle of absolute property, labour, which should be only
       a condition imposed upon  man  by  Nature,  becomes  in  all
       communities  a  human  commandment,  and  therefore  odious.
       Passive obedience, irreconcilable with a reflecting will, is
       strictly enforced. Fidelity to regulations, which are always



                                  - 23 -



       defective, however wise they may be thought,  allows  of  no
       complaint. Life, talent, and all the human faculties are the
       property of the State, which has the right to use them as it
       pleases  for  the  common  good.  Private  associations  are
       sternly prohibited, in spite of the likes  and  dislikes  of
       different  natures,  because  to  tolerate  them would be to
       introduce  small  communities  within  the  large  one,  and
       consequently private property; the strong work for the weak,
       although this ought to  be  left  to  benevolence,  and  not
       enforced, advised, or enjoined; the industrious work for the
       lazy though this is unjust; the clever work for the foolish,
       although  this  is absurd; and, finally, man - casting aside
       his  personality,  his  spontaneity,  his  genius,  and  his
       affections  -  humbly annihilates himself at the feet of the
       majestic and inflexible Commune!  Communism  is  inequality,
       but  not as property is. Property is the exploitation of the
       weak by the strong.* Communism is the  exploitation  of  the
       strong by the weak. In property, inequality of conditions is
       the result of force, under whatever name  it  be  disguised:
       physical and mental force; force of events, chance, FORTUNE;
       force of accumulated property, etc. In communism, inequality
       springs  from placing mediocrity on a level with excellence.
       This damaging equation is repellent to the  conscience,  and
       causes merit to complain; for although it may be the duty of
       the strong to aid the weak, they prefer  to  do  it  out  of
       generosity, - they never will endure a comparison. Give them
       equal opportunities of labour, and equal  wages,  but  never
       allow  their  jealousy to be awakened by mutual suspicion of
       unfaithfulness  in  the  performance  of  the  common  task.
       Communism  is oppression and slavery. Man is very willing to
       obey the law of duty, serve  his  country,  and  oblige  his
       friends;  but  he wishes to labour when he pleases, where he
       pleases, and as much as he pleases. He wishes to dispose  of
       his  own  time,  to be governed only by necessity, to choose
       his friendships, his recreation, and his discipline; to  act
       from judgement, not by command; to sacrifice himself through
       selfishness, not through servile  obligation.  Communism  is
       essentially  opposed  to the free exercise of our faculties,
       to our noblest desires, to our deepest  feelings.  Any  plan
       which  could  be devised for reconciling it with the demands
       of the individual reason and will would end only in changing
       the  thing while preserving the name.  Now, if we are honest
       truth-seekers, we shall avoid disputes about  words.   Thus,
       communism  violates  the  sovereignty  of the conscience and
       equality: the first, by restricting spontaneity of mind  and
       heart,  and  freedom  of  thought and action; the second, by
       placing labour and laziness, skill and stupidity,  and  even
       vice and virtue on an equality in point of comfort." [55]
