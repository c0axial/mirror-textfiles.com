                     EGOISM: THE PHILOSOPHY OF FREEDOM

                     "Many a year I've used my nose
                     To smell the onion and the rose;
                     Is there any proof which shows
                     That I've a right to that same nose?"

                   - Johann Christoph Friedrich Schiller

            The philosophy of individualist-anarchism is  "egoism."
       It is not my purpose here to give a detailed account of this
       philosophy, but I would like to explode a few  of  the  more
       common  myths  about egoism and present to the reader enough
       of its essence so that he may understand  more  clearly  the
       section  on  individualist  economics.  I am tempted here to
       quote long extracts from "The Ego and His Own," for  it  was
       this  book  which first presented the egoist philosophy in a
       systematic  way.  Unfortunately,  I  find   that   Stirner's
       "unique"  style  does  not readily lend itself to quotation.
       So what I have done in the following pages is  to  dress  up
       Stirner's ideas in a language largely my own.

            Voltaire once said, "If God did not exist, it would  be
       necessary  to  invent him." Bakunin wisely retorted, "If God
       DID  exist,  it  would  be  necessary   to   abolish   him."
       Unfortunately,  Bakunin  would  only  abolish God. It is the
       egoist's  intention  to  abolish  GODS.  It  is  clear  from
       Bakunin's  writings  that  what  he  meant  by  God was what
       Voltaire meant - namely the religious God. The  egoist  sees
       many  more  gods  than  that - in fact, as many as there are
       fixed ideas.  Bakunin's gods, for example, include  the  god
       of  humanity,  the  god of brotherhood, the god of mankind -
       all variants  on  the  god  of  altruism.   The  egoist,  in
       striking   down  ALL  gods,  looks  only  to  his  WILL.  He
       recognises no legitimate power over himself.* The  world  is
       there  for  him to consume - if he CAN. And he can if he has
       the power. For the egoist, the only right is  the  right  of
       might. He accepts no "inalienable rights," for such rights -
       by virtue of the fact that they're inalienable -  must  come
       from a higher power, some god.  The  American Declaration of

       --------------------

            * He does not, of course, claim to be omnipotent. There
       ARE  external  powers  over  him. The difference between the
       egoist and non-egoist in this regard is therefore one mainly
       of  attitude:  the  egoist  recognises  external power as an
       enemy and consciously fights  against  it,  while  the  non-
       egoist  humbles  himself before it and often accepts it as a
       friend.





                                  - 33 -



       Independence, for example, in proclaiming these rights found
       it  necessary  to invoke the "Laws of Nature and of Nature's
       God."  The  same  was  true  of  the  French   Revolutionary
       "Declaration des droits de l'homme et du citoyen."

            The egoist recognises no right - or what amounts to the
       same  thing - claims ALL rights for himself. What he can get
       by force he has a right to; and what he  can't,  he  has  no
       right.  He  demands no rights, nor does he recognise them in
       others. "Right - is a wheel in the  head,  put  there  by  a
       spook," [73] says Stirner. Right is also the spook which has
       kept men servile throughout the ages. The believer in rights
       has  always  been  his own jailer. What sovereign could last
       the day out without a general belief in the "divine right of
       kings"?  And  where  would  Messrs. Nixon, Heath, et. al. be
       today without the "right" of the majority?

            Men make their tyrants as they  make  their  gods.  The
       tyrant  is  a  man  like any other. His power comes from the
       abdicated power of his subjects. If people believe a man  to
       have  superhuman  powers,  they automatically GIVE him those
       powers by default. Had Hitler's pants fallen down during one
       of  his  ranting speeches, the whole course of history might
       have been different.  For who can respect a  naked  Fuehrer?
       And  who knows? The beginning of the end of Lyndon Johnson's
       political career might well have been  when  he  showed  his
       operation  scar  on  coast-to-coast television for the whole
       wide world to see that he really was a man after  all.  This
       sentiment  was  expressed  by  Stirner  when he said, "Idols
       exist through me; I need only  refrain  from  creating  them
       anew,  then they exist no longer: `higher powers' exist only
       through my exalting them and abasing  myself.   Consequently
       my  relation  to  the world is this: I no longer do anything
       for it `for God's sake,' I do nothing `for man's sake,'  but
       what I do I do `for my sake'." [74] The one thing that makes
       a man different from any other living creature is his  power
       to  reason.  It  is  by  this  power that man can (and does)
       dominate over the world.  Without  reason  man  would  be  a
       pathetic  non-entity  -  evolution  having taken care of him
       long before the dinosaur.  Now some people say that  man  is
       by  nature  a social animal, something like an ant or a bee.
       Egoists don't deny the sociability of man, but  what  we  do
       say is that man is sociable to the extent that it serves his
       own self-interest. Basically man is (by nature, if you will)





                                  - 34 -



       a selfish being. The evidence for this is overwhelming.* Let
       us  look  at  a  hive  of  bees  to see what would happen if
       "reason" were suddenly introduced into their lives:

            "In the first place, the bees would  not  fail  to  try
       some  new  industrial  process; for instance, that of making
       their cells round  or  square.  All  sorts  of  systems  and
       inventions  would  be tried, until long experience, aided by
       geometry, should show them that the hexagonal shape  is  the
       best.  Then  insurrections would occur.  The drones would be
       told to provide for themselves, and the  queens  to  labour;
       jealousy  would  spread  among the labourers; discords would
       burst forth; soon each one would want to produce on his  own
       account;  and  finally  the hive would be abandoned, and the
       bees would perish. Evil would be introduced into the  honey-
       producing  republic  by  the power of reflection, - the very
       faculty which ought to constitute its glory." [75]

            So it would appear to me  that  reason  would  militate
       against  blind, selfless cooperation. But by the same token,
       reason leads to cooperation which is mutually beneficial  to
       all  parties  concerned.  Such  cooperation  is what Stirner
       called a "union of egoists." [76] This binding  together  is
       not done through any innate social instinct, but rather as a
       matter  of  individual  convenience.  These   unions   would
       probably  take  the  form  of  contracting  individuals. The
       object of these contracts not being to enable all to benefit
       equally from their union (although this isn't ruled out, the
       egoist thinks it highly unlikely), but rather to protect one
       another  from  invasion  and  to  secure to each contracting
       individual what is mutually agreed upon to be "his."

            By referring to a man's selfishness, you know where you
       stand.    Nothing   is   done  "for  free."  Equity  demands
       reciprocity. Goods and services are exchanged for goods  and
       services  or  (what  is  equivalent)  bought. This may sound
       "heartless" - but what is the alternative? If one depends on
       kindness,  pity  or  love  the  services  and goods one gets
       become "charity." The receiver is put in the position  of  a
       beggar,  offering  nothing  in return for each "present." If
       you've ever been on the dole, or know anyone  who  has,  you
       will  know  that  the receiver of such gifts is anything but
       gracious. He is stripped of his manhood and he  resents  it.
       Now  the egoist isn't  (usually)  so cold  and cruel as this

       --------------------

            * Many people cite trade unions as a "proof"  of  man's
       solidarity  and  sociability. Just the opposite is true. Why
       else do people strike if not for their own  "selfish"  ends,
       e.g. higher wages, better working conditions, shorter hours?





                                  - 35 -



       description makes him out to be. As often as not  he  is  as
       charitable  and  kind  as  his  altruist  neighbour.  But he
       CHOOSES  the  objects  of  his  kindness;  he   objects   to
       COMPULSORY   "love."   What   an  absurdity!  If  love  were
       universal, it would have no meaning. If  I  should  tell  my
       wife  that  I  love  her because I love humanity, I would be
       insulting her. I love her not because she happens  to  be  a
       member  of the human race, but rather for what she is to me.
       For me she  is  something  special:  she  possesses  certain
       qualities  which I admire and which make me happy. If she is
       unhappy, I suffer, and therefore I try to  comfort  her  and
       cheer her up - for MY sake. Such love is a selfish love. But
       it is the only REAL love.  Anything else is  an  infatuation
       with  an  image, a ghost. As Stirner said of his loved ones,
       "I love them with the consciousness of egoism; I  love  them
       because  love  makes  ME  happy,  I  love  because loving is
       natural to me, because it pleases me. I know no `commandment
       of love'." [77]

            The lover of "humanity" is bewitched by a superstition.
       He  has  dethroned God, only to accept the reign of the holy
       trinity: Morality, Conscience and Duty. He becomes  a  "true
       believer" - a religious man. No longer believing in himself,
       he becomes a slave to Man. Then, like all religious men,  he
       is  overcome  with  feelings  of  "right"  and  "virtue." He
       becomes  a  soldier  in  the  service  of   humanity   whose
       intolerance  of  heretics  rivals that of the most righteous
       religious fanatic. Most of the misery in the world today (as
       in the past) is directly attributable to men acting "for the
       common good." The individual is nothing; the mass all.

            The egoist would reverse  this  situation.  Instead  of
       everyone  looking  after  the welfare of everyone else, each
       would look after his own welfare. This would,  in  one  fell
       swoop, do away with the incredibly complicated, wasteful and
       tyrannical machinery (alluded to  previously)  necessary  to
       see  to  it that not only everyone got his fair share of the
       communal pie, but that everyone contributed  fairly  to  its
       production. In its stead we egoists raise the banner of free
       competition: "the war of all against all" as the  communists
       put  it.  But wouldn't that lead to (dare I say it) ANARCHY?
       Of course it would. What anarchist would  deny  the  logical
       consequences  of  the principles he advocates? But let's see
       what this "anarchy" would be like.

            The egoist believes that the relationships between  men
       who are alive to their own individual interests would be far
       more just and  equitable  than  they  are  now.    Take  the
       property  question  for  example.  Today  there  is  a great
       disparity of income. Americans  make  up  about  7%  of  the
       world's  population,  but  they  control  over  half  of its





                                  - 36 -



       wealth. And among the Americans, nearly one quarter  of  the
       wealth  is  owned  by  5%  of the people.* [78] Such unequal
       distribution  of  wealth  is  due  primarily  to  the  LEGAL
       institution  of property. Without the state to back up legal
       privilege and  without  the  people's  acquiescence  to  the
       privileged  minority's  legal  right to that property, these
       disparities would soon disappear. For what  makes  the  rich
       man  rich and the poor man poor if not the latter GIVING the
       former the product of his labour?

            Stirner is commonly thought to have  concerned  himself
       little  with the economic consequences of his philosophy. It
       is true that he avoided elaborating on the exact  nature  of
       his  "union of egoists," saying that the only way of knowing
       what a slave will do when he breaks his chains  is  to  wait
       and  see. But to say that Stirner was oblivious to economics
       is just not so. On the contrary. It was he, after  all,  who
       translated into German both Adam Smith's classic "An Inquiry
       into the Nature and Causes of the  Wealth  of  Nations"  and
       Jean  Baptiste  Say's  pioneering  work  on  the free market
       economy, "Traite d'Economie Politique."  The  few  pages  he
       devotes  to economics in "The Ego and His Own" are among his
       best:

       "If we assume that, as ORDER belongs to the essence  of  the
       State,  so  SUBORDINATION too is founded in its nature, then
       we see that the subordinates, or  those  who  have  received
       preferment,   disproportionately  OVERCHARGE  and  OVERREACH
       those who are put in the lower ranks....By what then is your
       property  secure,  you  creatures  of  preferment?...By  our
       refraining from interference!  And so by OUR protection! And
       what  do  you  give us for it? Kicks and disdain you give to
       the `common people'; police  supervision,  and  a  catechism
       with  the  chief  sentence  `Respect what is NOT YOURS, what
       belongs to  OTHERS!  respect  others,  and  especially  your
       superiors!'  But  we reply, `If you want our respect, BUY it
       for a  price  agreeable  to  us.  We  will  leave  you  your
       property,   if   you   give   a   due  equivalent  for  this
       leaving.'...What equivalent do  you  give  for  our  chewing
       potatoes  and  looking  calmly on while you swallow oysters?
       Only buy the oysters of us as dear as we  have  to  buy  the
       potatoes  of  you, then you may go on eating them. Or do you
       suppose the oysters do not  belong  to  us  as  much  as  to
       you?...Let  us  consider  our  nearer  property, labour...We
       distress ourselves twelve  hours in  the  sweat of our face,

       --------------------

            * Contrary to popular  belief,  this  gulf  is  getting
       larger.  Since  1966,  despite a constantly mushrooming GNP,
       the American factory workers' REAL wages (as opposed to  his
       apparent, inflationary wages) have actually declined. [79]





                                  - 37 -



       and you offer us a few pennies for it. Then  take  the  like
       for your labour too. Are you not willing? You fancy that our
       labour is richly repaid with that wage, while yours  on  the
       other  hand  is worth a wage of many thousands.  But, if you
       did not rate yours so high, and gave us a better  chance  to
       realise  value  from  ours,  then we might well, if the case
       demanded it, bring to pass still more important things  than
       you  do  for  the many thousand pounds; and, if you got only
       such wages as we, you would soon grow  more  industrious  in
       order  to  receive more. But, if you render any service that
       seems to us worth ten and a hundred times more than our  own
       labour,  why, then you shall get a hundred times more for it
       too; we, on the other hand, think also to  produce  for  you
       things  for  which you will requite us more highly than with
       the ordinary day's wages. We shall be willing to  get  along
       with  each  other all right, if only we have first agreed on
       this - that neither any longer needs to -  PRESENT  anything
       to  the  other....We  want  nothing  presented  by  you, but
       neither will we present you with anything. For centuries  we
       have  handed alms to you from good-hearted - stupidity, have
       doled out the mite of the poor and given to the masters  the
       things  that  are  -  not  the  masters'; now just open your
       wallet,  for  henceforth  our  ware  rises  in  price  quite
       enormously.  We  do  not  want  to  take  from you anything,
       anything at all, only you are to pay  better  for  what  you
       want  to  have.  What  then have you? `I have an estate of a
       thousand acres.' And I am your plowman, and will  henceforth
       attend  to  your  fields  only for a full day's wages. `Then
       I'll take another.' You won't find any, for we  plowmen  are
       no longer doing otherwise, and, if one puts in an appearance
       who takes less, then let him beware  of  us.  There  is  the
       housemaid, she too is now demanding as much, and you will no
       longer find one below this price. `Why, then it is all  over
       with me.' Not so fast! You will doubtless take in as much as
       we; and, if it should not be so, we will take  off  so  much
       that  you  shall  have  wherewith to live like us. `But I am
       accustomed to live better.' We have  nothing  against  that,
       but  it is not our lookout; if you can clear more, go ahead.
       Are we to hire out under rates, that you  may  have  a  good
       living?  The  rich  man  always  puts  off the poor with the
       words, `What does your want concern me? See to  it  how  you
       make  your  way  through the world; that is YOUR AFFAIR, not
       mine.' Well, let us let it be our affair, then, and  let  us
       not  let  the  means  that  we  have  to  realise value from
       ourselves be  pilfered  from  us  by  the  rich.   `But  you
       uncultured  people really do not need so much.' Well, we are
       taking somewhat more in order that for it we may procure the
       culture  that  we  perhaps need....`O ill-starred equality!'
       No, my good old sir, nothing of equality. We  only  want  to





                                  - 38 -



       count for what we are worth, and, if you are worth more, you
       shall count for more right along. We only want to  be  WORTH
       OUR  PRICE, and think to show ourselves worth the price that
       you will pay." [80]

            Fifty years  later  Benjamin  Tucker  took  over  where
       Stirner left off:

       "The minute you remove privilege, the class that  now  enjoy
       it will be forced to sell their labour, and then, when there
       will be nothing but labour with which  to  buy  labour,  the
       distinction  between  wage-payers and wage-receivers will be
       wiped out, and every man will be a labourer exchanging  with
       fellow-labourers.   Not  to abolish wages, but to make EVERY
       man dependent upon wages and secure to every man  his  WHOLE
       wages  is the aim of Anarchistic Socialism. What Anarchistic
       Socialism aims to abolish is usury.  It  does  not  want  to
       deprive labour of its reward; it wants to deprive capital of
       its reward. It does not hold that labour should not be sold;
       it holds that capital should not be hired at usury." [81]

            Franklin D. Roosevelt  said  in  his  second  inaugural
       address  that  "We  have  always  known  that heedless self-
       interest was  bad  morals;  we  know  now  that  it  is  bad
       economics."  I've  tried  to show in this section that self-
       interest is "good morals." I now intend to show that  it  is
