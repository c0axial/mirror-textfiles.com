Editor's Word
_____________

There are three main proponents of egoism known today, Max Stirner,
Friedrich Nietzsche and Ayn Rand. Each of them has a very distinct
approach to egoism. While Rand has a very conceptual approach, asking
"who is the right beneficiary of a man's action" [1], Stirner takes
an almost opposite path, rejecting any "justification" outside himself,
in that the root of his egoism is to find in the einzige - the unique,
individual person. Nietzsche speaks about a "will to power" of a
thousand little emotional sub-selves that make out the total self,
while for Rand the self is the mind - the intellect - alone. Stirner
is close to the existentialist camp in his focus on the unique choice,
by his focus on the "creative nothing" which creates itself, while
Nietzsche, who believed himself to descend from Polish nobility,
emphasizes "fate" [amor fati] and belonging to the blood one is born
into.

So, we see there are more than enough choices of ones "egoism". Instead
of embracing one alternative and denouncing the other two as the false
- and possibly even evil - egoisms, I will try to explain in general (*)
outlines why I have chosen to emphasize one of them - namely Stirner+s.

Stirner is often described as a nominalist, one to whom concepts and/or
universals have no meaning outside groupings made by observers. I have
an opposite opinion on that: For Stirner, the road to egoism is seen as
going through Idealism, not outside. He recognizes ideals and thoughts,
only does not - surrender to them. Stirners "anti-conceptualism" is to
be found late in his book: "The conceptual question 'what is man?' -
has then changed into the personal question 'who is man?'  With 'what'
the concept was sought for, in order to realize it; with 'who' it is no
longer any question at all, but the answer is personally on hand at
once in the asker: the question ansers itself."   "... no -concept-
expresses me, nothing that is designated as my essence exhausts me; 
they are only names."  This is his insistence on his uniqueness as an
individual. An insistence not found equally strong by Nietzsche or by
Rand. Where the latter focusses strongly on abstract "Man" (**), whose
moral characteristics follow from the possession of reason, the former
at times (***) goes as far as negating the individual in his quest for
the "Ubermensch", the super-man, which is supposed to fulfill some
longing to go beyond oneself and beyond the transitory stage of Man: [2]
Man is but a rope over the abyss between the animal and the Ubermensch.

So, Stirner is unique in his emphasis on uniqueness. This is the central
element in Stirner+s thought - the first-person and particular view-
point, the me-outlook, as opposed to the third-person and general view-
point. The third-person, gemeral view-point is for him justified only
insofar as it is grounded in the me-outlook. "Away, then, with every
cause that is not altogether _my_ cause!"

Among the three, Stirner is the only one who makes no claim for anyone
as to how they should live, or what is suitable for their "kind", but
leaves it totally to individual choice. This is why I prefer Stirner.

(*) {The field is now open: Anyone wanting to express their unique path
     to egoism and why it has taken the form it has is invited to write
     such an article. If you want, make it an autobiography. Myself, I
     plan a more comprehensive article later. This was a start.}

(**){There is an open question of whether, and if so to which degree,
     Stirner's criticism of Feuerbach's "Man" is applicable to Rand's
     concept of "Man" as in "qua man". Perhaps subject for a later
     article.}

(***){Nietzsche is no systematic philosopher, and so one can find
      support both for and against egoism in his writing.}

                       REVOLUTION: THE ROAD TO FREEDOM?

          "It's true that non-violence has been a dismal failure.
          The only bigger failure has been violence."
                              - Joan Baez

            There's an old story about a  motorist  who  stopped  a
       policeman  in  downtown Manhattan and asked him how he could
       get to the  Brooklyn  Bridge.  The  officer  looked  around,
       thought  a  minute,  scratched his head and finally replied,
       "I'm sorry,  but  you  can't  get  there  from  here.   Some
       anarchists  are  now  wondering  if  you can get to the free
       society from where we stand today. I must  confess  that  I,
       too,  harbour  some  doubts.  But  if  there is a way, it is
       incumbent upon all who wish to find that  way  to  carefully
       examine the important end-means problem.

            "The end justifies the means." Few people  would  argue
       with  this  trite  statement.  Certainly  all  apologists of
       government must ultimately fall back on  such  reasoning  to
       justify  their  large  police  forces  and  standing armies.
       Revolutionary anarchists must also rely on this argument  to
       justify  their  authoritarian  methods "just one more time",
       the  revolution  being  for  them  "the  unfreedom  to   end
       unfreedom."  It  seems  that  the  only  people  who  reject
       outright this article of faith  are  a  handful  of  (mostly
       religious)  pacifists.   The  question  I'd like to consider
       here is not whether the end JUSTIFIES the means (because  I,
       too,  tend to feel that it does), but rather whether the end
       is AFFECTED by the means and, if so, to what extent.

            That the  end  is  affected  by  the  means  should  be
       obvious.  Whether  I  obtain  your  watch  by swindling you,
       buying it from you, stealing it from you, or  soliciting  it
       as  a  gift  from  you  makes  the  same  watch "graft", "my
       property", "booty", or "a donation." The same  can  be  said
       for  social  change.  Even  so strong an advocate of violent
       revolution as Herbert Marcuse, in one  of  his  rare  lapses
       into sanity, realised this fact:

       "Unless the revolution itself  progresses  through  freedom,
       the need for domination and repression would be carried over
       into the new society and the fateful separation between  the
       `immediate' and the `true' interest of the individuals would
       be almost  inevitable;  the  individuals  would  become  the
       objects  of  their  own  liberation,  and freedom would be a
       matter of administration  and  decree.   Progress  would  be
       progressive  repression,  and  the  `delay' in freedom would
       threaten to become self-propelling  and  self-perpetuating."
       [56]





                                  - 25 -



       But despite the truth of  Marcuse's  observation,  we  still
       find  many  anarchists  looking for a shortcut to freedom by
       means of violent revolution. The idea that anarchism can  be
       inaugurated by violence is as fallacious as the idea that it
       can be sustained by violence. The best that can be said  for
       violence  is  that it may, in rare circumstances, be used as
       an  expedient  to  save  us   from   extinction.   But   the
       individualist's  rejection  of  violence (except in cases of
       self-defence) is not due to any lofty  pacifist  principles;
       it's  a  matter of pure pragmatism: we realise that violence
       just simply does not work.

            The task of anarchism, as the individualist sees it, is
       not  to destroy the state, but rather to destroy the MYTH of
       the state. Once people realise that they no longer need  the
       state,  it  will  -  in  the  words  of  Frederick  Engels -
       inevitably "wither  away"  ("Anti-Duehring",  1877)  and  be
       consigned  to the "Museum of Antiquities, by the side of the
       spinning wheel and the bronze axe" ("Origin of  the  Family,
       Private   Property   and   the  State",  1884).  But  unless
       anarchists can create a general and well-grounded  disbelief
       in  the state as an INSTITUTION, the existing state might be
       destroyed by violent revolution or it might fall through its
       own  rottenness,  but  another  would inevitably rise in its
       place. And why shouldn't it? As long as people  believe  the
       state  to  be  necessary (even a "necessary evil", as Thomas
       Paine said), the state will always exist.

            We have already seen how Kropotkin would usher  in  the
       millennium  by  the  complete expropriation of all property.
       "We must see clearly in private property what it really  is,
       a  conscious or unconscious robbery of the substance of all,
       and seize it joyfully  for  the  common  benefit."  [57]  He
       cheerfully  goes on to say, "The instinct of destruction, so
       natural   and   so   just...will   find   ample   room   for
       satisfaction."  [58]  Kropotkin's  modern-day  heirs  are no
       different.  Noam Chomsky, writing in the "New York Review of
       Books"  and  reprinted  in  a  recent  issue  of  "Anarchy",
       applauds  the  heroism  of  the  Paris  Commune   of   1871,
       mentioning only in passing that "the Commune, of course [!],
       was drowned in blood." [59] Later in  the  same  article  he
       writes,  "What  is  far  more  important is that these ideas
       [direct workers' control] have been realised in  spontaneous
       revolutionary action, for example in Germany and Italy after
       World  War  I  and  in   Spain   (specifically,   industrial
       Barcelona)  in  1936."  [60]  What  Chomsky apparently finds
       relatively UNimportant are  the  million-odd  corpses  which
       were  the  direct result of these "spontaneous revolutionary
       actions." He also somehow manages to ignore  the  fact  that
       the three countries he mentions - Germany, Italy and Spain -
       were without exception victims of fascism within a few years

       of these glorious revolutions. One doesn't need a great deal
       of insight to be able  to  draw  a  parallel  between  these
       "spontaneous"  actions with their reactionary aftermaths and
       the spontaneous "trashings" which are currently  in  fashion
       in  the United States. But it seems the Weathermen really DO
       "need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows." [61]

            The question of how to attain the anarchist society has
       divided  anarchists  nearly  as much as the question of what
       the anarchist society actually is. While Bakunin insisted on
       the   necessity   of  "bloody  revolutions"  [62],  Proudhon
       believed that violence was unnecessary - saying instead that
       "reason  will  serve  us  better." [63] The same discord was
       echoed on the other side of the Atlantic some decades  later
       when,  in  the  wake  of the infamous Haymarket bombing, the
       issue of violence came to a head. Benjamin  Tucker,  writing
       in   the  columns  of  "Liberty",  had  this  to  say  about
       accusations  leveled  against  him  by  Johann   Most,   the
       communist-anarchist editor of "Freiheit":

       "It makes very little difference to Herr  Most  what  a  man
       believes  in economics. The test of fellowship with him lies
       in acceptance of dynamite as a  cure-all.  Though  I  should
       prove  that  my  economic views, if realised, would turn our
       social system inside out, he would not therefore  regard  me
       as  a  revolutionist.  He  declares  outright  that  I am no
       revolutionist, because the thought of the coming  revolution
       (by  dynamite,  he  means)  makes  my  flesh creep.  Well, I
       frankly confess that I take no pleasure in  the  thought  of
       bloodshed  and  mutilation  and  death.  At  these things my
       feelings revolt. And if delight in them is a requisite of  a
       revolutionist,  then  indeed  I  am  no  revolutionist. When
       revolutionist and cannibal become synonyms, count me out, if
       you  please.  But,  though  my  feelings  revolt,  I  am not
       mastered by them or made a coward by them.  More  than  from
       dynamite  and  blood  do  I  shrink  from  the  thought of a
       permanent system of society involving the slow starvation of
       the  most  industrious  and  deserving of its members.  If I
       should ever become convinced that the policy of bloodshed is
       necessary  to  end our social system, the loudest of today's
       shriekers for blood would not surpass  me  in  the  stoicism
       with  which  I  would  face the inevitable. Indeed, a plumb-
       liner  to  the  last,  I  am  confident  that   under   such
       circumstances  many  who  now think me chicken-hearted would
       condemn the stony-heartedness with which I should favour the
       utter  sacrifice of every feeling of pity to the necessities
       of the terroristic policy. Neither fear nor  sentimentalism,
       then, dictates my opposition to forcible methods. Such being
       the case, how stupid, how unfair, in Herr Most,  to  picture
       me  as crossing myself at the mention of the word revolution
       simply because I steadfastly act  on  my  well-known  belief






                                  - 27 -



       that  force  cannot  substitute truth for a lie in political
       economy!" [64]

            It is this issue of  economics  which  generally  sorts
       anarchists   into  the  violent  and  non-violent  wings  of
       anarchism. Individualists, by and large,  are  pacifists  in
       practice  (if  not  in  theory), whereas the communists tend
       toward violent revolution.* Why is this  so?  One  reason  I
       think   is  that  individualists  are  more  concerned  with
       changing the conditions which directly  affect  their  lives
       than  they  are with reforming the whole world "for the good
       of all." The communists, on the  other  hand,  have  a  more
       evangelical spirit. Like all good missionaries, they are out
       to convert the unbeliever - whether he likes it or not.  And
       inevitably this leads to violence. Another reason communists
       are more prone to violence than individualists can be found,
       I  think,  in  looking  at  the  nature of the force each is
       willing to use to secure and sustain his respective  system.
       Individualists  believe  that  the only justifiable force is
       force used in preventing invasion  (i.e.  defensive  force).
       Communists,  however,  would  compel  the worker to pool his
       products with the products of others and forbid him to  sell
       his  labour  or  the products of his labour. To "compel" and
       "forbid" requires the use  of  offensive  force.  It  is  no
       wonder,  then,  that  most  communists  advocate violence to
       achieve their objectives.

            If freedom is really what we anarchists crack it up  to
       be, it shouldn't be necessary to force it down the throat of
       anyone. What an absurdity! Even so superficial a  writer  as
       Agatha Christie recognised that "if it is not possible to go
       back [from freedom], or to choose to go back, then it is not
       freedom." [66] A. J. Muste used to say that "there is no way
       to peace - peace IS the way." The same thing is  true  about
       freedom:  the  only  way  to  freedom  is  BY  freedom. This
       statement is so nearly tautological that it should not  need
       saying.  The only way to realise anarchy is for a sufficient
       number of people to be convinced that  their  own  interests
       demand  it. Human society does not run on idealism - it runs
       on pragmatism. And unless people can be made to realise that
       anarchy actually works for THEIR benefit, it will remain

       --------------------

            * There are exceptions of course. It is hard to imagine
       a  more dedicated pacifist than Tolstoy, for example. On the
       other side of the coin is  Stirner,  who  quotes  with  near
       relish  the French Revolutionary slogan "the world will have
       no rest till the last king is hanged with the  guts  of  the
       last priest." [65]





                                  - 28 -



       what it is today: an idle pipe dream; "a  nice  theory,  but
       unrealistic."  It  is the anarchist's job to convince people
       otherwise.

            Herbert Spencer - the great evolutionist of whom Darwin
       said, "He is about a dozen times my superior" - observed the
       following fact of nature:

       "Metamorphosis is the universal law, exemplified  throughout
       the  Heavens  and  on  the  Earth: especially throughout the
       organic world; and above all in the animal division  of  it.
       No  creature,  save  the simplest and most minute, commences
       its existence in  a  form  like  that  which  it  eventually
       assumes;  and  in  most  cases  the unlikeness is great - so
       great that kinship between the  first  and  the  last  forms
       would  be incredible were it not daily demonstrated in every
       poultry-yard and every garden. More than this is true.   The
       changes  of  form  are  often several: each of them being an
       apparently  complete  transformation  -  egg,  larva,  pupa,
       imago, for example ... No one of them ends as it begins; and
       the  difference  between  its  original  structure  and  its
       ultimate structure is such that, at the outset change of the
       one into the other would have seemed incredible." [67]

            This universal law of metamorphosis holds not only  for
       biology,  but  for  society as well. Modern-day Christianity
       resembles the early Christian church  about  as  much  as  a
       butterfly  resembles  a  caterpillar. Thomas Jefferson would
       have  been  horrified  if  he  could   have   foreseen   the
       "government  by  the consent of the governed" which today is
       the hereditary heir  of  his  Declaration  of  Independence.
       French  revolutionaries  took  turns  beheading  one another
       until that  great  believer  in  "les  droits  de  l'homme",
       Napoleon  Bonaparte, came upon the scene to secure "liberte,
       egalite, fraternite" for all. And wasn't it  comrade  Stalin
       who in 1906 so confidently forecast the nature of the coming
       revolution?: "The dictatorship of the proletariat will be  a
       dictatorship  of  the entire proletariat as a class over the
       bourgeoisie and not the domination of a few individuals over
       the  proletariat."  [68] The examples of these ugly duckling
       stories in reverse are endless. For as  Robert  Burns  wrote
       nearly two centuries ago:

             "The best laid schemes o' mice and men
                  Gang aft a-gley;
             An' lea'e us nought but grief and pain
                  For promis'd joy." [69]
