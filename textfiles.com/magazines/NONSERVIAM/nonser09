Editor's Word
_____________

  The saga continues ... The chapter Ken Knudson's article today,
"Capitalism: Freedom Perverted" is probably the most challenging
chapter to the readers of Non Serviam, and I have no doubt that many
will wish to comment. Such comments do, unless they are themselves
articles, belong on the list, nonserv. As Ken Knudson is presently
on vacation, it might take some time beforehe replies.

  Happy reading, and I look forward to a good discussion.

                     CAPITALISM: FREEDOM PERVERTED

            "Permit me to issue and control the money of a
             nation and I care not who makes its laws."
                           - Meyer A. Rothchild

            Roosevelt, in blaming the depression of  the  'thirties
       on  "heedless self-interest," played a cheap political trick
       for which the world has been suffering ever since. The great
       crash  of 1929, far from being created by "free enterprise,"
       was created by government interference in the  free  market.
       The  Federal Reserve Board had been artificially controlling
       interest rates since 1913. The tax structure of the  country
       was  set up in such a way as to encourage ridiculously risky
       speculation  in  the  stock  market.  "Protective   tariffs"
       destroyed  anything  that  vaguely  resembled a free market.
       Immigration barriers prevented the free flow of  the  labour
       market.  Anti-trust laws threatened prosecution for charging
       less than the competition ("intent to monopolise")  and  for
       charging  the  same as the competition ("price fixing"), but
       graciously permitted  charging  more  than  the  competition
       (commonly  called  "going  out of business.") With all these
       legislative restraints and controls, Roosevelt still had the
       gall  to  blame the depression on the "free" market economy.
       But what was his answer to the  "ruthlessness"  of  freedom?
       This is what he had to say on taking office in 1933:

       "If we are to go forward, we must  move  as  a  trained  and
       loyal  army  willing  to  sacrifice  to the good of a common
       discipline, because without such discipline no  progress  is
       made, no leadership becomes effective. We are, I know, ready
       and willing  to  submit  our  lives  and  property  to  such
       discipline because it makes possible a leadership which aims
       at a larger good." [82]

            We've been on  that  Keynesian  road  ever  since.  The
       "larger  good"  has become larger and larger until today the
       only cure the politicians come up  with  for  the  economy's
       ills  is  more  of the same poison which made it sick in the
       first place. The rationale for such a policy  was  expressed
       by G. D. H. Cole in 1933:

       "If once a departure is made from the  classical  method  of
       letting all the factors [of the economy] alone - and we have
       seen enough of that  method  [have  we?]  to  be  thoroughly
       dissatisfied  with  it - it becomes necessary to control ALL
       the factors...for interference with one,  while  the  others
       are  left  unregulated, is certain to result in a fatal lack
       of balance in the working of the economic system.." [83] (My
       emphasis)




                                  - 40 -


            Many people, on hearing the individualist  critique  of
       governmental  control  of the economy, jump to the erroneous
       conclusion that we believe in capitalism. I'm sorry  to  say
       that  some  anarchists - who should know better - share this
       common fallacy. In a letter to "Freedom" a few months ago  I
       tried  to  clear up this myth. Replying to an article by one
       of its editors, I had this to say:

       "First let me look at the term  `anarcho-capitalist.'  This,
       it   seems  to  me,  is  just  an  attempt  to  slander  the
       individualist-anarchists by using a supercharged  word  like
       `capitalist'  in  much the same way as the word `anarchy' is
       popularly used to mean chaos and  disorder.  No  one  to  my
       knowledge  accepts the anarcho-capitalist label*, just as no
       one up to the time of Proudhon's memoir on property in  1840
       accepted the anarchist label. But, unlike Proudhon who could
       call himself an anarchist  by  stripping  the  word  of  its
       derogatory  connotation  and looking at its real MEANING, no
       one can logically call himself an anarcho-capitalist for the
       simple reason that it's a contradiction in terms: anarchists
       seek  the  abolition  of  the  state  while  capitalism   is
       inherently  dependent  upon  the  state.  Without the state,
       capitalism would inevitably fall, for  capitalism  rests  on
       the pillars of government privilege. Because of government a
       privileged  minority  can  monopolise  land,  limit  credit,
       restrict  exchange, give idle capital the power to increase,
       and,  through  interest,  rent,  profit,  and   taxes,   rob
       industrious labour of its products." [84]

            Now most anarchists when they attack capitalism  strike
       it  where  it  is strongest: in its advocacy of freedom. And
       how paradoxical  that  is.  Here  we  have  the  anarchists,
       champions  of  freedom  PAR  EXCELLENCE,  complaining  about
       freedom! How ridiculous, it seems to me, to find  anarchists
       attacking  Mr.  Heath  for  withdrawing government subsidies
       from museums and children's milk programmes. When anarchists
       start  screaming  for free museums, free milk, free subways,
       free medical care, free education,  etc.,  etc.,  they  only
       show  their  ignorance  of what freedom really is. All these
       "free" goodies which governments so graciously  shower  upon

       --------------------

            * I have since been informed that "the  term  `anarcho-
       capitalist'  is now in use in the USA - particularly amongst
       those  who  contribute  to  the  Los   Angeles   publication
       `Libertarian  Connection'."  It  seems  to  me  that  people
       accepting such a label must do so primarily  for  its  shock
       value.  Very  few  people  like  capitalists these days, and
       those who do certainly don't like anarchists.   What  better
       term could you find to offend everyone?





                                  - 41 -



       their  subjects  ultimately   come   from   the   recipients
       themselves  -  in  the  form  of taxes. Governments are very
       clever at concealing just how large this  sum  actually  is.
       They  speak  of  a  billion  pounds  here  and a few hundred
       million  dollars  there.  But  what  does  a   figure   like
       $229,232,000,000.00  (Nixon's proposed budget) actually mean
       to the taxpayer? Virtually nothing. It's just a long  string
       of  numbers  preceded  by  a  dollar  sign.  People  have no
       conception of numbers that size. But let me try to shed some
       light  on  this figure by breaking it down into a number the
       individual taxpayer can't help but understand:  the  average
       annual  cost  per family. This is a number governments NEVER
       talk about - for if they did, there would be a revolt  which
       would  make  the storming of the Bastille look like a Sunday
       school picnic. Here's how to  calculate  it:  you  take  the
       government's  annual  budget and divide it by the population
       of the country; then you multiply the result by the  average
       size  of  family (4.5 seems a reasonable number). Doing this
       for the American case cited, we come to  $4,800  (i.e.  2000
       pounds  per family per year!*). And that is just the FEDERAL
       tax bite. State and local taxes  (which  primarily  pay  for
       America's  "free" education and "free" public highways) have
       yet to be considered. I leave  it  as  an  exercise  to  the
       British reader to see why their "welfare state" also prefers
       to mask budgetary figures by using astronomical numbers.

            One thing should be clear from this example: nothing is
       for  nothing.  But the Santa Claus myth dies hard, even - or
       should I  say  especially?  -  among  anarchists.  The  only
       encouraging  sign  to  the  contrary  I  have  found  in the
       anarchist press of late was when Ian  Sutherland  complained
       in  the columns of "Freedom": "I object, strongly, to having
       a large section of my `product', my contribution to society,
       forcibly  removed  from  me  by  a  paternalistic  state  to
       dispense to a fool with  10  kids."  [85]  Unfortunately,  I
       suspect   that   Mr   Sutherland   would  only  replace  the
       "paternalistic state" by the "paternalistic commune"  -  and
       in so doing would  still end up supporting those 10 kids. My
       suspicions were nourished by what he said in the  very  next
       paragraph  about  "laissez  faire" anarchists: "perhaps they

            *  I  am  usually  quite  conservative  in  my  use  of
       exclamation  marks.   When  I  used this example in a recent
       letter to "Freedom", the editors saw fit to insert one where
       I  had  not.  In  keeping  with  their  precedent, I will do
       likewise.





                                  - 42 -




       should join the Powellites." Perhaps  Mr  Sutherland  should
       learn what laissez faire means.

            Laissez  faire  is  a  term  coined   by   the   French
       physiocrats  during the eighteenth century. John Stuart Mill
       brought it into popular English usage with  the  publication
       in  1848  of his "Principles of Political Economy," where he
       examined  the   arguments   for   and   against   government
       intervention  in the economy. The "con" side of the argument
       he called laissez faire. "The principle of  `laissez  faire'
       in  economics  calls  for  perfect  freedom  in  production;
       distribution of the returns (or profit) to  the  factors  of
       production  according  to  the  productivity  of  each;  and
       finally, markets in which prices are determined by the  free
       interplay of forces that satisfy buyers and sellers." [86] I
       find it difficult to see how any advocate of  freedom  could
       possibly  object to a doctrine like this one. Unfortunately,
       what happened in the 19th century  was  that  a  handful  of
       capitalists,  who  were  anything  but believers if freedom,
       picked up this nice sounding catch  phrase  and  decided  to
       "improve"  upon  it. These "improvements" left them with the
       freedom to exploit labour but took away labour's freedom  to
       exploit   capital.  These  capitalists,  in  perverting  the
       original meaning of laissez faire,  struck  a  blow  against
       freedom  from  which  it  still  suffers  to  this day.  The
       capitalist who advocates laissez faire is a hypocrite. If he
       really  believed  in  freedom, he could not possibly condone
       the greatest invader of freedom known  to  man:  government.
       The  capitalist  necessarily relies on government to protect
       his privileged RIGHTS. Let us look at the foremost  advocate
       of  capitalism  today,  Ayn  Rand. Her book "Capitalism: The
       Unknown Ideal" has two appendices. The first  is  on  "Man's
       Rights"  where  she say, "INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS ARE THE MEANS OF
       SUBORDINATING SOCIETY TO MORAL  LAW."  [87]  (Her  emphasis)
       Once  again  we  are  back  to  "rights"  and "morals" which
       Stirner so strongly warned us about.  And  where  does  this
       lead   us?   Directly   to  Appendix  Two,  "The  Nature  of
       Government," where she says that government  is  "necessary"
       because  "men  need  an institution charged with the task of
       protecting [you guessed it] their rights."  [88]  Let's  see
       what some of these precious rights are:

            I. Chapter 11 of Miss  Rand's  book  is  devoted  to  a
       defence  of  patent and copyright laws. In it she calls upon
       government to  "certify  the  origination  of  an  idea  and
       protect  its  owner's  exclusive right to use and disposal."
       [89] Realising the absurdity of PERPETUAL property in  ideas
       ("consider what would happen if, in producing an automobile,
       we had to pay  royalties  to  the  descendants  of  all  the
       inventors  involved, starting with the inventor of the wheel





                                  - 43 -



       and  on  up."  [90]),  she  goes  into  considerable  mental
       acrobatics  to  justify  intellectual property for a LIMITED
       time. But by so doing, she only  succeeds  in  arousing  our
       suspicion  of  her motives, for it seems strange that a mere
       lapse of time should negate something so precious as a man's
       "right"   to   his  property.  Admitting  that  "a  patented
       invention often tends to hamper or restrict further research
       and  development  in  a  given  area  of  science  [91], our
       champion of the unhampered economy nevertheless  manages  to
       justify  governmental  "protection" to secure the inventor's
       "rights." As for copyrights, our millionaire  author  thinks
       "the  most  rational"  length  of time for this governmental
       protection would be "for the  lifetime  of  the  author  and
       fifty years thereafter." [92] How does she justify all this?
       The way she justifies most  of  her  inane  arguments  -  by
       quoting  herself:  "Why  should  Rearden  be  the  only  one
       permitted to manufacture Rearden Metal?" [93] Why indeed?

            II. Capitalists are fond of proclaiming the "rights" of
       private  property. One of their favourite property rights is
       the right to own land without  actually  occupying  it.  The
       only  way  this  can  possibly  be  done  is, once again, by
       government  protection  of  legal  pieces  of  paper  called
       "titles"  and  "deeds."  Without these scraps of paper, vast
       stretches of vacant land would be open to  those  who  could
       use  them  and  exorbitant rent could no longer be extracted
       from the non-owning user as tribute to the non-using owner.

            There  is  much  talk  these  days  of  a   "population
       explosion."  It  is  claimed  that land is becoming more and
       more scarce and that by the year such and such there will be
       38.2  people per square inch of land. But just how scarce is
       land? If all the world's land were divided up equally, every
       individual  would  have  more  than  ten  acres apiece. Even
       "crowded" islands like Britain and Japan have more  than  an
       acre  per  person on average. [94] When you consider how few
       people actually own any of this  land,  these  figures  seem
       incredible.  It's  no wonder then that the absentee landlord
       is a strong believer in property rights.  Without  them  his
       vulnerable  land  might actually be used to the advantage of
       the user.

            III. Capitalists have always been  great  believers  in
       the  sovereign  "rights"  of nations. Ayn Rand, for example,
       thinks it perfectly consistent with  her  brand  of  freedom
       that  the  United  States  government  should tax the people
       within its borders to support an army which  costs  tens  of
       billions  of  dollars  each  year. It is true that Miss Rand
       opposes the war in Vietnam. But why? Because  "IT  DOES  NOT
       SERVE ANY NATIONAL INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES." [95] (Her
       emphasis)  So  we  see  that  our   advocate   of   "limited





                                  - 44 -



       government"  wouldn't  go  so  far as to limit its strongest
       arm:  the  military.  Eighty  billion  dollars  a  year  for
       national  "defence" doesn't seem to phase her in the least -
       in fact, she would like to add on a few billion more to make
       "an  army career comparable to the standards of the civilian
       labour market." [96]

            As every anarchist knows, a frontier  is  nothing  more
       than  an  imaginary line drawn by a group of men with vested
       interests on their side of the line. That  "nations"  should
       exist is an absurdity.  That a highwayman (in the uniform of
       a customs official) should rob people as  they  cross  these
       imaginary  lines and turn back others who haven't the proper
       pieces of paper is an obscenity too indecent to relate  here
       -  there  may be children reading. But if there are children
       reading, perhaps they can enlighten their elders  about  the
       obvious - as they did when the emperor went out in his "new"
       clothes. The nationalists of the world are  strutting  about
       without a stitch of reason on. Can only a child see this?

            IV. The cruelest "right" - and the one least understood
       today  -  is  the  exclusive  right  of governments to issue
       money. There was a time  about  a  hundred  years  ago  when
       nearly  everyone  was  aware  of  the currency question. For
       several decades in the United States it  was  THE  political
       issue.   Whole  political parties formed around it (e.g. the
       Greenback and Populist parties). William Jennings Bryan, the
       three-time  Democratic candidate for the presidency, rose to
       fame with his  "easy  money"  speeches;  next  to  Lincoln's
       Gettysburg  address,  his "cross of gold" speech is probably
       the best-known public oration of 19th century  America.  Yet
       today  virtually  everyone  accepts the currency question as
       settled. Governments issue the money  people  use  and  they
       never  give  it a second thought - it's just there, like the
       sun and the moon.

            The   capitalist   is   vitally   interested   in   the
       government's  exclusive right to issue money. The capitalist
       is,  by  definition,  the  holder  of   capital;   and   the
       government, by making only a certain type of capital (namely
       gold) the legal basis of all money, gives to the  capitalist
       a  monopoly  power  to  compel all holders of property other
       than  the  kind  thus  privileged,  as  well  as  all   non-
       proprietors, to pay tribute to the capitalist for the use of
       a circulating medium  and  instrument  of  credit  which  is
       absolutely  necessary  to  carry  out  commerce and reap the
       benefits of the division of labour. A crude example  of  how
       this  system works is given by the Angolan "native tax." The
       Portuguese whites in Angola found it difficult to get  black
       labour  for  their coffee plantations, so they struck upon a
       rather ingenious scheme: tax the natives  and  the  natives,





                                  - 45 -



       having  to  pay  their tax in MONEY, would be forced to sell
       their labour to the only people who could give it to them  -
       the whiteman. [97]

            The same thing goes on today on  a  more  sophisticated
       level  in  our  more "civilised" societies. The worker needs
       money to carry out the business of everyday life.  He  needs
       food,  he  needs  housing,  he  needs clothing. To get these
       things he needs MONEY. And to get money he has to  sell  the
       only  thing  he's  got:  his  labour. Since he MUST sell his
       labour, he is put into a very bad bargaining  position  with
       the  buyers  of  labour:  the  capitalists.  This is how the
       capitalist grows rich. He buys labour in a cheap market  and
       sells his products back to the worker in a dear one. This is
       what Marx called the "surplus value theory" of  labour.  His
       analysis  (at  least  here)  was  right; his solution to the
       problem was wrong.

            The way Marx saw out of this trap was to abolish money.
       The  worker  would  then get the equivalent of his labour by
       pooling his products with other workers and taking out  what
       he  needed.  I've  already  exposed  the weak points of this
       theory. What is the individualist alternative?
