            Phone Scanning for those who don't use war-dialers
                (Hey you, yeah you, your Disclaimer HERE!)

        Scanning for those who don't like war dialers is mostly for scanning
800#'s,(if you don't know what scanning is then please get a HPAVC education
course first before you read this) as i was saying, 800#'s can be fun to scan
and dangerous at the same time. Here are some of the most basic pointers.

        1) Scanning 800#'s from your home phone line is not only stupid but
                can probally get you in a shitload of trouble, most 800#'s
                have ANI(Automatic Number Identification) systems on them
                and these are a bitch, because once you find a good 800# that
                you're going to play with from your home phone you're just 
                going to get yourself in major trouble, especially if it's an
                extender. If you're going to do 800# scanning by all means 
                don't be stupid use different payphones from time to time so
                your chances of getting caught are less. Scanning at night
                might be a bit hard because you'll probally have a hard as 
                hell time trying to look at the number's. Just use one 
                payphone and make about 10-15 800# calls then move to the next
                alternate, don't use the same exact payphone everytime.

        2) When looking for interesting numbers don't start from 800-XXX-0000
                all the way through to 800-XXX-01000 or 9999, etc... be 
                creative use numbers like the below(note these aren't real #'s
                just examples)....

                        1-800-EAT-SHIT
                        1-800-NOT-4YOU
                        1-800-999-9999(The 9 line, dial itm and yell rape!)
                        1-800-THIS-SUX
                        1-800-YOU-FUCK
                        1-800-OHMY-GOD
                        1-800-FOR-PLAY

                etc... you get the idea just be creative, and allways remember
                what you dialed last, i once got some number that was security
                and procedures for some Penal colony(Prison).

        3) If you get an operator or one of those stupid personal 800# lines
                where family and friends can call for free, just ask for Joe
                or someone, and sometimes you might even get a reply, "Yeah,
                hello this is Joe what's up?", or "Joe's not home now try l8r"
                , etc.... anyways if it's something like a voice mailbox write
                it down and remember it, then hack the VMB later on. Hell use
                it for yourself. Tho i wouldn't suggest doing it so because
                someone else who know's how to hack VMB's will probally do it
                to your mailbox and listen to your messages. If you know what
                you're doing with VMB's you can blackmail people.

        4) You must be patient don't give up on the first try and get a busy
                signal, try your 800-and your last 7 digit's, try friends #'s
                try anything just have fun, that's what scanning 800#'s is for!

        5) Never be rude to someone else, otherwise they'll probally get pissed
                to all hell and have your number traced, well it don't matter if
                you're doing it from a pay-phone. But don't get them all siked
                and get more protective shit for their line. You may just may 
                have to hack out some stuff from them if they run a BBS or PBX
                at night, perhaps free phone calls.

        6) If you're going to be hacking 800#'s please read USU-003.TXT on 
                hacking 800#'s.
