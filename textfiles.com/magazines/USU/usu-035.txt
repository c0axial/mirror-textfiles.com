First off the dumbass disclaimer:

      This phile is for informational purposes only.  The <cough> views
stressed in this article are those of united States underground.  We
have the freedom of speech and there's not one damn thing you feds could
do about it. HAHAHA!!  (Enough Bullshit)


Now back to the subject.  Boxing should be treated as an art form to us
Anarchists and Phreakers out there.  There are some pretty damn cool
things you could do that combine phreaking and anarchy to result in
astounding (destructive) results.  There are also some unwritten rules
of breaking into cans and phreaking you should know about before trying
anything.


                    The Unwritten Rules of Phreaking
                     ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

1. The Pigs...cough....cops really don't know the first thing about
   phreaking so therefore you could do just about anything until they
   finally do realize what you're doing is illegal.

2. If a cop does happen to pass you by while you are in a can, just stay
   right there and keep doing what you're doing and they'll think that
   you're doing your job.  Hey it worked for me and I'm not really your
   average looking bell employee.  Usually, they have better things to
   do and figure that the phone company will handle it.

3. Always have a small pack of phreaking\anarchy tools so it doesn't
   look too obvious.

4. The people who could see you really won't give much thought to what's
   going on and won't call the 5 0.

5. It really helps to have a handheld police scanner at the scene so you
   know what's going on and have time to book out of there.

6. Don't worry about getting caught too much because it impedes your
   progress and concentration.  I once broke into a can at 1:00 PM with
   people walking down the street every 5 minutes.  No one cares!

7. Always wear gloves.

8. Don't pay for the shit that Radio Shack sells for 10 times the amount
   its worth.  Lift it or at least talk the guy down.  The cameras they
   have are a piece of shit.  They only point in one direction usually.


                         Grey\Beige\Modu-Boxing
                          ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

    A beige box, a grey box, and a modu-box all have the same purpose to
break into bell cans and make free calls.  A beige box is a nice box to
have but a grey a.k.a. modu-box is a much better box to use simply
because you don't alter anything but a wall jack and you can use ANY
phone.  All you need is a wall jack and two alligator clips.  But you
should know how to do this already so there's no use in me telling you
(See Schematic Below).  But when you're near the can always have your
phreaking pack on you.  Here's a list of tools to carry:

1. A "fanny" pack or other small bag to strap around your waist. (or a
   backpack if you feel safe.)
2. A pair of wire strippers.  Needed to strip the wires for easy access.
3. A pair of needlenose pliers for easy stripping and basic use.
4. A rachet-socket wrench with a 7\16" hex attachment and a phillpshead
   screwdriver attachment.
5. A small flashlight for night-boxing.
6. A roll of electrical tape to prevent the teleco from realizing you
   stripped their wires.
7. A small modular fone. (yes you can fit it)
8. About a foot of modular fone wire.  (the grey straight kind, not the
   spiral type)
9. Of course, a grey box.

You gotta be pretty stupid to not know how to make a grey box but just
in case here it is:

1. Alligator Clips <<<
2. Red Wire *******
3. Green Wire @@@@@@@@

                       Modular Wall Jack

             Note:     (Leave Red & Black Alone)



Find a can that is fairly secluded such as Behind a bush or large tree.
Now take your socket wrench and affix it to the bolts on the can.  Turn
the bolts about 1/3 of a turn until you hear a >>CLICK<< sound, one bolt
is open.  Do the same to the bottom bolt.  Now carefully open the can.
You're in!  Now you'll see a bunch of plastic covered pcboards.  Look
for the number of your victim and unscrew the two screws on each side of
the plastic cover using a screwdriver or the phillipshead attachment to
the socket wrench.  Or you could use an open one or frayed wire
depending on how many phellow phreakers already hit your spot.  Now look
for any two purple and white or sometimes orange and white wires.  Strip
them with your wire stripper.  Attach the gator clips to the frayed
wires and plug in your fone.  You should get a dialtone.  Phreak away!
You know what to do once you're tapped into someone's line (See Next
Section).  When someone happens to pick up don't worry.  Just press the
mute button or take out the mouthpiece or your phone.  It is good to
have a Radio Shack Line In-Use Indicator (Model #: 43-108) so you know
when they are off the line.  After you're done put electrical tape over
the frayed wires and screw in the plastic cover(s).  Close the bolts and
walk away.  That's pretty Cool.


              Possible Things to do While Beige\Grey Boxing
               ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

A true HPAVCT'er would have ALOT of ideas on who to call while grey
boxing or whatever.

1. Make Carding calls to 1-800 or LD #'s such as Damark or Computer
   Stores.  Or Chemical Stores.

2. Use a Labtop computer with a modem to call your favorite LD Int'l
   Elite\HPAVCT BBS's.

3. Also with the labtop call CBI (system password- Administrator)

4. Hack the HELL out of BBS's. Let the lamers pay!!

5. Prank call the president's bomb shelter or something.

6. Harass the <yawn> operator.

                           Anarchous Phreaking
                            ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

Here's something brand new to come into the world of HPAVC.  Anarchy to
The Teleco!  You can use many household items to phuck the hell out of
the teleco.  Such as Gasoline, Pineapples (duh), Scissors, Matches, etc.
Just go into a can and cut every wire you can find.  The whole
neighborhood will be complaining and it'll take weeks to fix.  Spray
some WD-40 into the can and light a match.  Again, it'll take weeks to
fix.  Plant an immovable bomb using a few mercury switches and some
pineapples and when the teleco goes to fix something that you did
they'll be in for a pleasant surprise.  Pour some gasoline into the
circuts and it'll melt the whole can.  It could take months to fix!
Have alot of Phucking Phun....
