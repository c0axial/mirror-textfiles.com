        Anyways I know their are other ways to make a chlorine bombs but this 
one shouldn't be deadly. It just really smmells ad and pisses people off. 
        
        So here is what you need. 
                                A Film cap
                                Enough Bleach to fill it half way up.           
                                And some dish soap enough to fill the other
                                Half of the film cap.

        Now here is what you do. Carry the shit outside in seperate containers,
put it near someones AC or near a fan that blows into the house and then 
mix the two, cap it, and shake it.
       
       The thing will explode and chlorine gas will go everywhere And smells
really fucking bad.
        
        Other fine places to use it!

- Put it in someones mail box.
- Put it inside a car.
- Drop it off at a phone both.
- Put it in a restroom.
- Leave it inside a subway car when you leave.
- Put it all over plants cause it will kill them.
- Leave it in one of those Porto-Poties.
- Dump in someones locker.
- Leave it in an Elevator.
- Leave it in a classroom
- Throw it into a LARGE croud of people.


        Ok now here is the fucking way that will probably smell and cause 
perminent damage.
        Mix a whole thing of dish liquid with a whole container of Clorox 
and dump it in a storm drain or smear someones animals with it. Guaranted a 
reaction.
        Pour it all over their stairs. Pour it all over the top of an Air
Conditioner it will stink up the place and ruin the Air Conditioner. Or just
dump it on them.

Just use your Imagination.

Later.
