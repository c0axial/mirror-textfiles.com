        hi, i'm black francis & this is my 'zine about crank & my love for
 crank.  i will release a new issue whenever i am feeling especially
 depressed that crank is with some white bread chicken shit & not me.  i am
 the only one who can truely love her like she needs to be loved & one day
 she will realize that.

        i love you, crank.

        i wrote this poem about crank, because i love her (a lot!).  i hope
 she likes it because if not i will kill myself.

        *ahem.*

        it's called, "crank".

 "crank crank
 you are not a skank
 you are very pretty like a flower
 & you have nice boobies
 i'd like to touch them someday
 i love you crank"

 - -- ---+ crank!

        crank used to date eightball & this guy called "turbo" & dead cheese
 & aoxomoxoa but she's never dated me & one time she even went after mogel.
 now she's dating murmur.  i don't like murmur because he is an inbred
 corn-huskin' motherfucker & he does not deserve crank's love.  stupid hick.
        
        i love you, crank.

 to keep me from my true love (that's *YOU*)!

       here is another poem i wrote about crank one night when i was thinking
 about her a lot, which could be any given night, 'cause i think about her
 all the time.  that is because i love her.

        this one's called, "crank".

 "crank
 you are pretty & nice
 i think about you when i masturbate
 draw on my dick."

        i love you, crank.

 - -- ---+ crank!

        ok, that's it for the first issue of the "i love crank" newsletter.
 i hope you enjoyed it, crank, because i love you & everything i do is for
 you & nobody else.  i love you.

        any similarities to persons alive or dead is intentional because i
 love crank.
