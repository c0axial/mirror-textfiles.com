Well legal crap is over let's get to business

How to make a timer into a detonator.

Well simplicity is always the best way to go. Many have wonder how to make a
timed explosion that will not cost you much in the checkbook. The only item
you need to buy is a MICRONTA ELECTRONIC TIMER (Yeah, the cheap ass brand at
radio shack) also make sure it is the one with the alarm and countdown feature.  
You will also need a phillips screw and a wire cutter (If you don't have 
one then you have never been an avid fan of H/P/A). 

Procedure:
First get the screwdriver and unscrew the screw on the back of the timer.
Next you need to open the timer. It's held by those wedge into hole type 
system. Now that it's opened look at the speaker (The little circle like 
thing). Cut both the wires. Pass the wire through the air-hole of the speaker
(on the other side of the plastic case). Now reassemble the timer and you 
have a fully working detonator. Use the wire to connect different types
of explosives. Look for uses in my EXPLOSIVES MADE EASY series.
