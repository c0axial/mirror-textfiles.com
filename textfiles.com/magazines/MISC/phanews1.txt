        Allright, so you're wandering through your local mall, and you're
thinking, "Why the Hell am I here?" You're surrounded by Flat-Chested Pre-Teens
with high-squeking voices and you're really starting to get annoyed.
        But Wait, Up Ahead in the Distance, you see a Shimering Light... Could
be? By George, it is.
                              RADIO SHACK

        The Possibilities are endless. An Entire Store, Filled with Idiots who
haven't the slightest Idea what they're doing. Once I was shopping there for
some Capacitors, POTs, etc.. and I asked the guy if I could substitute one part
for another (I was attempting a Red Box), so the guy says, "Nobody here knows
what this Shit is. We had a guy here a few years ago who did, But I fired him.
Didn't like him.."

        This should give you a picture of the Mentality of the Basic Radio
Shack employee. Anyways on with the story. These stores have lots of
potentially phun products. Let's take a step-by-step look at some of the better
ones.

        First lets look around for those Nifty Remote Control Cars they usually
have sitting around. Found 'em? Great. Now if you're EXTREMELY lucky they'll
have batteries in them. Most, however, will not. So you're going to have to
supply the batteries yourself. Not Carrying them with you? Go buy em from Radio
Shack. OK Now that you have you batteries put them in the car of your choice.

        Place the Car in a choice posistion in which you think it will startle
them the most. (ie: on top of the boxes of other cars, &c).

        Now you have two choices, either do it yourself, or have someone else
do it for you. I highly suggest the latter. So what you do is, turn the car on,
hopefully, the engine doesn't make too much noise. Now you have to get someone
to use the damn thing. A couple methods I find effective are

A) Go up to the guy working at the counter and say, "Excuse me, but could you
explain the little joystick in the middle of this thing to me?" He'll think
you're pretty stupid, but hey, we're dealing with Radio Shack Employees here.
Most Likely, his Explanation will involve moving the joystick, sending th car
flying off the boxes.

B) (Kinda week, But some people are really, really dumb) Place the controller
by one of their computers. Put a sign (hand written or typed) saying "Try our
NEW Wireless Joystick" Next to it. Some kid will eventually come along, and
Boom.. There goes the car.

        But there are other things to do here too! Yes that's right! More!
Go to the back (or wherever they have all their Electronic parts) and switchj
around all the labels for the CAPs, POTs, Etc... This will take the average
worker quite a while to get back in order..

        Also, most Radio Shacks are kind Enough to provide us with ready to use
computers. How Sweet. Most of them will have a nice text editor with them.
You can do pretty much anything from here. If you want to be direct about it,
just delete their hard disc. But I think we can have more fun with them than
that. You can screw around with their config.sys a bit, add a bunch of weird
shit in there and see what happens. Have phun with it. Then there's the
autoexec.bat file. You can fuck around a bit in there, make it...

:echo off
:echo Fatal Error 1012
:prompt -Please Reboot-
:echo on

        That wil keep the average worker wondering for a while. Yeah, like I
ssaid, they aren't too smart.

        Now if you're Really Phortunate, you may find a Basic Compiler (Or
Pascal, C, etc..) Lying around their disc somewhere. If you're familiar with
the language you can type up a nice virus and put it in their autoexec file.
What the hell, Bring your own virus to radio shack and stick it in there.

        I'm sure you get the general idea. Do whatever you want, it's not as
if you're the one who's gonna have to pay for it. Just make sure you pick up
one of their catolouges (which brings up another interesting radio shack
quote...

Me: Do you Have a Catolouge?
Worker Guy: Yup, Sure do!
<Pause>
Me: Well, You think maybe you can give it to me?
Worker dude: Oh! OK yeah sure!

... Anyways pick up one so you can look up all the parts for your, uhh.. ,
science project! Yeah that's it! Gotta do a science project on, uhhh,
Telecommunications in the 1990s. That's the ticket.
Have Phun.

1.Disclaimer
------------
        All lamers and narcs be aware that this textfile is purely for
informational and educational purposes.  Razor and his sponsor group will
P/H/A take no responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of any of the

Police!"

2.Question
----------
        Are any you one or more of the below? If so, then this textfile is
for you!

            1. A r0dent who likes to send anonymous hate mail.
            2. A hacker interested in the complex and enourmous innards of
               the mail system "available" for your use.
            3. Just some d00d who is interested in mail.
            4. A lamer who doesn't fit any of the above descriptions.

3.Nitty Gritty
--------------
        If you have a a gateway allowing access to the Internet and allows
the specification of a port to be applied as a suffix to the Internet address
of any system, you, whether you know it or not, have a very useful hacking
tool at your finger tips.
        This hacking tool allows you to both send fakemail from ANY system
accessible in the Internet and other network domains with an Internet address
and allows you to determine if a used on ANY system accessible from the
Internet exists.
        You should be able to realize the power of such a tool.  Think of
it this way, you can send anyone on the Internet fake mail for phun or
whatever, and you can verify the existance of ANY user accessible by mail;
something which will allow you to find an existing user and proceed to hack
that user's account on that user's particular host system.
        This tool is called "Sendmail" (easy enough), and is installed as
port 25, which can be accessed via Telnet (NOT TELENET) or Rlogin protocols.
Now we will go into getting to the port 25 and what to do once there.

4.How To
--------
        When you use a the Telnet or Rlogin protocol to connect to a
different computer system, you can specify an additional port of the host
system in question.  The port we are concerned with in this textfile is
port number 25, the Sendmail utility.  If you are wondering how to specify
an additional port to connect to, just add a " 25" to the end of the
Internet address you are attempting to access.

    ie...

    You want to make the fakemail appear as if sent from a system
    connected to 128.113.40.157:

    d00dnet>telnet 128.113.40.157 25

    You can also utilize the rlogin protocol or use a name such as
    "phavax.ucla.edu 25" if you don't want to type in the numbers.

    When you are connected you will get a message such as the
    following:

    220 phavax.ucla.edu Sendmail 5.59/1.13 ready at Sat,5 May 90 05:29:31 PDT

         |                        |                      |                |
         |                        |                      |                |
         |                        |                      |                |
   Host System             Version Of Utility     Date Information   Time Zone


5.Sending Fake Mail
-------------------
        If you are interested in sending fake mail from this host system, you
should first verify the existance of the receiver you want to send the mail
to. BTW, this can also be used to send valid mail if you really, really,
really, want to (duh...). The verify user command can be done by the
following:

    VRFY <USER NAME>

Where <USER NAME> is the person you want to send mail to.  This <USER NAME>
should be a full network/mail path the that user or your search may turn up
emptyhanded.  If the entered name is valid, it will it will tell you so and
if not it will tell you so.

    The next step is to tell the Sendmail facility who is to receive the
mail.  You do this like the following:

    RCPT TO:<USER NAME>

Where <USER NAME> is the recipient.  Then you tell the host who is sending
the mail. Do this like the following:

    MAIL FROM:<YOUR USER NAME>

Remeber that <YOUR USER NAME> does not have to be valid and that is most
adventageous use of this system.

    Now, if you really want to get dirty or messy, you can even fake which
host you are mailing from. This is done with the following command:

    HELO <HOSTNAME>

Again, the <HOSTNAME> does not have to be valid, but you probably want it
to look realistic; something like "D00DLAND.PHAVAX.EDU" would be cool.

    Ok, when you are done playing with changing names, recipients, systems
and whatever, you will find the time to actually SEND the message you want
to send to your victim (well, if the recipient isn't a victim by now, I don't
know what he/she is!). This is done by issuing the DATA command like the
following:

    DATA

Sendmail will respond and will tell you to type your message, ending it with
a "." on a line by itself.


6.Verifing Names
----------------
        The following command is useful for verifying the existance of account
names on the host system.  This can come in as handy in finding default
accounts on certain systems you might want to hack later or just to make sure
your victim exists:

    VRFY <USER NAME>

The <USER NAME> must be the full network path the the user's mailbox on
whatever system is host to him/her (such as "PRICK@PHAVAX.UCLA.EDU"). The
Sendmail utility will state whether or not the name is valid.


7.Misc...
---------
        Well that is about it. I hope that this information is useful to you.
In appendix A I have included a sample session which has been captured into
my buffer. Remember that you can get help at any time by typing HELP.

[Part 5]: NUA Scanning By NUAA
==============================

    The following is a large list of NUAs in domesic (SprintNet Domestic,
DNIC 3110) which accept collect calls and are working as of this release
date. Thanks to NUAA (Network User Address Attacker), this large scale
scanning was done in a minimal amount of time. Enjoy...
