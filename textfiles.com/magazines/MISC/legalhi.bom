     There is no need for a disclaimer in this article being that
     it deals purely with opinion.  If you don't like it then
     don't read it! My views are not necessarily the views of the

                   þ Should Drugs be Legal? þ

     This question has been asked many times throughout the years
and it seems that even though our country continues to fight this
so called "war" on drugs their use has not really declined. It is
necessary to look at both sides of this issue before one can make
a final conclusion. Let us look at why they are illegal and why it
is wrong or hypocritical that they are illegal. 
     Many people feel that drugs hurt people and their families and
a sad thing is that drugs can do this. However, is that a
reasonable cause to make them illegal? No. It is possible for any
substance to do this but that is the fault of the person who uses
it. Also, the government does not seem to care about this anyways.
For example, alcohol has been known to destroy more people and
families than most other substances. Yet is it illegal? Hell no!
The argument here is that the use of alcohol can be controlled. It
is also possible for people to control their drug use. Also, it is
hypocritical for the government to keep alcohol legal when it does
the same damage as drugs. You will also notice that cigarettes are
also legal and they can give cancer to those who smoke them and
those who are around people who smoke them. Yet for some reason
they are legal. Are you seeing any flaws in the claim that the
government keeps drugs illegal because they hurt people? I hope so
because they are numerous.
     What most people seem to think is that alcohol is harmless
compared to let's say marijuana for argument sake. What people fail
to realize is that both do damage. Look at it this way: If you get
a buzz from it you are doing damage to your body. They have linked
the use of marijuana to impotence and Alzheimer's Disease. Alcohol
can also cause Cirrhosis of the Liver, brain hemorrhaging, death if
too much is consumed, and it also causes Alzheimer's Disease. Not
once have I heard of anyone dying because they smoked too much
marijuana but how many times have you heard of people dying because
they drank too much? Alcohol can actually be more dangerous than
marijuana and yet it is marijuana that is illegal. Once again, a
flaw in the claim that drugs are illegal because they harm you.
     Another reason as to why drugs are illegal is that fact that
they alter peoples' moods and states which can cause bad things.
One of the great fears is that people will drive while they are
high. However is this a reason to keep them illegal? No. Alcohol
is legal and yet people drive on it all the time. However, it is
illegal to drive drunk. A law could also be passed to make it
illegal for one to drive while they are high. If people are
responsible for their actions when they are drunk then they can
alsobe responsible when they are high.
     Then of course there is the great fear of, "What will happen
to our country if drugs are legalized? Everyone will turn into
zombies!"  This is an exaggeration and also not anyone's business.
If people want to be zombies then it is their right to do so. It is
not illegal for anyone to be drunk all the time and yet it hasn't
messed up the country. The same would probably happen with drugs.
Just because they are legal does not mean that people would use
them all the time. In fact, usage would most likely go down due to
their availability. If it is an easy thing to get drugs then it
wont be a big deal for someone to have them and the urge wont be as
great to do them. You may have a little boom in their usage like
the usage of alcohol after prohibition but this would not last
forever.
     Lets start looking at how the country could benefit if drugs
were legalized. Right now it is obvious that our economy is majorly
fucked up due to our national deficit and it is greatly affecting
our lives. Nobody wants to pay taxes in order to do away with this.
The legalization of drugs would greatly help our economy. Drugs
could become a totally government owned industry our drugs could
just be taxed to the extremes. By just legalizing Marijuana we
could generate a hell of a lot of money which we could put towards
the deficit. No Republicans our Democrats should have any
objections to this because taxes would not have to be raised.
     Another benefit is where we could direct our crime
enforcement. A great deal of money is spent by the government to
fight a war on drugs and as we know drugs are one of the main
contributors to crime. If we legalized drugs we could cut off most
organized crime rings by the balls and they would have to go back
to the old days where they controlled gambling and prostitution.
The police could then focus their efforts on capturing murderers
instead of going after people who are just looking for a good time.
Millions of dollars would also be freed by this since the
government wouldn't have to finance a drug war which could all go
towards the deficit.
     And last, but definitely not least, drugs should be legal
simply because people want them. Is it really the governments
business what chemicals we are putting into our body? No! And does
the government even really care what chemicals we put into our
body? Of course not because known substances which do damage are
still legal (ie. NutraSweet, Saccharin, Cigarettes, and Alcohol.)
If people want to do damage to their bodies then they should be
allowed to. Our bodies do not belong to the government! Therefore
the government should not say what people can and can't ingest or
inject into their bodies. The government belongs to the people so
if people want to be able to legally purchase drugs then they
should be able to.
     However, drugs will not be legalized for many reasons. The one
theory I tend to believe is this. The alcohol has a heavy lobbying
group which gives money to the government in order to keep drugs
illegal. They do this because if drugs were legalized then they
would lose all the business of the teenagers which buy their
products. What teenager is going to go and buy a bunch of beers
for everyone at a party to get drunk on if he can go and buy a
little marijuana and get everyone feeling great without any
hangover effects afterwards? It is obvious that no teenager would
do this and that is one of the main reasons for drugs remaining
illegal. If people really want to see drugs legalized then they
must start a lobbying group of their own which can eventually
overcome the alcohol lobbyists. Talks and debates are not going to
do a thing because the government does not care. It is a money
thing. The day this happens is the day you will see drugs legalized
but this will probably not happen for a very long time if at all.
