        Is currently looking for submissions.  Past issues have included
        fiction, poetry, interviews, essays, critiques, and ascii art,
        but I'm always open to new forms.  Back issues of CORE can be
        found on ftp.etext.org, or via gopher at CICnet. 


        GUIDELINES

        Please submit no more than one piece of prose or three poems at
        a time.  These should be in ascii only, preferably without tabs.
        I expect them to be free of typos and other errors.  Genre 
        material is fine, but I recommend that Science Fiction be sent
        to Quanta, which specializes in it.


        Questions, submissions, and subscription requests should be sent
        to rita@etext.org
