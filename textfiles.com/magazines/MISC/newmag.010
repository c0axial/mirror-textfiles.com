hi kids... welcome to new mag's first issue... i was thinking about 
stuff... lots of stuff... you want to know what stuff?

it's secret stuff... oh so secret!@... i was thinking about the zine 
scene, about the people there, the groupies, the 'gods', the screen 
sessions sitting on #zines, about how mogel always makes me look like a 
pill popping druggie, about how accurate mogel's observations are (save 
the ones about me, hell, he can't even capitolize my name right), and 
about how everyone feels cool to eat pez.

[but pip!  this doesn't sound like your normal pip-zine.]

yeah, i know it doesn't... i'm complaining about the 'scene'... but you 
know something?  i'm going to stop right now... no more complaining about 
the scene from me... suffice to say i don't like it as much as i used to, 
maybe it's because the novelty has worn off, or maybe it's just because 
there's 2,000 people sitting in #zines, and 1,995 of them are screen 
sessions...

[well, what are you going to talk about now?]

i'm going to talk about a vietnam vet that i met the other day, and what 
i felt about him.

[sounds boring]

no one asked you, shut up.

anyway, one day after work i walk down to the bus stop so i can catch the 
t down to my street corner and i run into jim.  jim's a dirty old man who 
feels that life consists of three things, commies/beer/cheap women.  i, 
being a man of the world, disagree with him.  he tells me about how i'm 
going to go off to bosnia to die in a war that i have nothing to do with, 
about how he's going home to call up his 24 year old girlfriend who's in 
school right now to become a brat-teacher, about how he makes so much 
money working on power lines (then why's he on the bus?), and about his 
bitch ex-wife who has kept his kid away from him.  it makes me think, it 
makes me want to know how he led his life, so that i don't follow in his 
path and make the same mistakes.  he is the culmination of everything 
that i detest in the world, all things evil and dirty.  but why is he the 
way he is?  life?  vietnam?  money?  genes?  who knows, but when i'm 
awake at night hating myself for what i am, i think of him and am 
thankful that i'm not what he is.


[i don't see any wackyness yet, did i miss something?]

no...
