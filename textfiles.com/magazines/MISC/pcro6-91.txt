     With summer approaching, game devolpers will be picking up in their
releasing of new games since people will have more spare time  in  which
to play them.  For this issue, I have tried to put together a worthwhile
grouping of games from those available now to those soon to be available
to the public.
     Games are a good relaxer and stress reliever,  and  then  can  also
challenge the mind and skill of a person.  Hardly ANYONE can  say,  "Oh,
I don't like games.  I don't play them," simply because we all  enjoy  a
new game every so often.
     Well, enjoy the issue and drop me a line with any suggestions.

     "You are standing at the end of a  road  before  a  small  brick
building."
     And so starts the original adventure game, appropriately titled,
"Adventure".  Adventure games have come a long way over the  last  15
or so years.  Starting off with "Adventure" which was the first  game
to make the computer the eyes, ears, arms, and  legs  of  the  person
playing it.  Such simple one word commands such as "LOOK" or "N" were
used.  But now, moving all the way up  to  adventure  games  such  as
"King's Quest V" using CD ROM and a mouse interface.
     As I mentioned, "Adventure" was the very first  adventure  game.
Well, only a few years later came the very  first  graphic  adventure
game, "Mystery House".  It was a basic whodunit mystery in which  you
had to find the killer before he/she found you.  This was done  by  a
then relatively small software company named "Sierra On-Line".
     Sierra On-Line gradually became the country's most trusted  name
in software.  Sierra was the first to release a 3-D/move  the  person
with the joystick game, "King's Quest".  In  this  game,  you  became
Sir Graham, a brave knight  out  to  find  and  return  treasures  of
Daventry to King Edward.
     Later King's Quest games incorporated music,  spells,  and  even
day/night cycles.  They are now, overall, one  of  the  best  selling
adventure series to date.
     Might and Magic broke new ground in the fantasy/adventure world,
bringing forth a true  3-D  interface  in  which  you  were  actually
looking from the player's point of view.  The 3-D interface had  been
around for years, but Might and Magic  (and  Bard's  Tale,  and  many
others, to tell the truth) was one of the first to  put  it  to  such
good use.
     During the late 80's, adventure games  became  highly  techincal
and involved, including such features as  VGA  support, SoundBlaster/
AdLib support, and mouse support.  And now,  in  1991,  comes  a  the
newest generation of games:  CD ROM.
     King's Quest V is one of the first CD ROM games to be  released.
In the CD ROM version, the voices of the characters  aren't  figments
of your imagination, but actual voices you hear as you interact  with
them.  This is only one of the conviences of CD ROM.
     What's next?  Who knows.  But maybe  not  knowing  is  the  best
since it'll keep us surprised no matter what comes along...

     Maybe... Virtual Adventuring?  Hmm...

                        Dragon's Lair II - TimeWarp
                        ===========================
by Duncan Scarry


       Seeing that there are lots of new games comeing out, it 
is tiring to see that many of them are in the same old arcade 
style game.  One button for jump, one for attack, move your guy
to the right while killing whatever comes in your way.  Seems 
kind of useless after a while and tends to make some games that
would have been good, boring. It seems senseless to ruin a game
that you have paid programmers and graphics technicians money 
to create.  At least, that is how it seems to me.
        
        Dragon's Lair II is a breath of fresh air.  It still 
has a hint of arcade style, but it also has the look and feel of 
something very different.  Dragon's Lair II is a sequel to a popular
arcade game and has to done very well as a computer game. 
                            
        When Dragon's Lair I came out, sometime in the 
mid-eighties, it was a triumph in arcade games -- a breed of 
new technology.  The games were hand drawn cartoons stored on a 
laserdisc, which gave a little more of a life-like sense.  They
sometimes were a little choppy due to the fact that images had 
to be edited together on film before they were put on the laserdisc. 
But overall were much better than any of the graphical 
games.  Dragon's Lair I was a big hit and I am sure the its maker's  
were up to their ears in money.  Other games came out, like 
"Rebel," but the technology either didn't catch on or it was just 
too expensive to make.  Soon games went back to computer generated 
graphics and the laserdisc games were soon forgotten and lost 
forever.  Every now and then, you see an old game in the back of 
some arcade, like the old junk cars you see once in a while 
stumbling down the street.
 
        
        I saw Dragon's Lair II, and wanted to try it out; just to see how
well they imitated the laserdisc technology.  I wanted to 
see the general setup and what could be done with the good 'ole IBM. 

        I loaded the file onto my hard drive, and it took up a hefty 3 
megs.  Most of the size is due to large sized graphic files which 
help the game along.  You can install the game, or just put all of
the files in one directory and play away.

        Due to the size, I did note to myself that I thought the 
graphics would be very nice and indeed they were!  I saw a flurry 
of 256 VGA color and some animation that CAN'T be beat.  Dirk the 
Daring came out in great color and style.  Moved slyly and was 
nicely done.  Moreover, the whole graphical side of the 
game was nicely done.

        That was less than I can say for the story line and 
controls.  The story was the same as the first version -- boring run and 
get the Princess story.  I would have thought for all the time and work 
invested in the program that they could have at least thought of a 
new plot.  I see the company's point of view  not to 
change a good thing, but too much of a good thing isn't all that 
good either!

        The controls are stiff and short.  A two key combination 
will take you through an entire animation sequence.  As for the 
joystick, I think that it is an outrage about how badly they handled 
this area of the game.  The joystick is even less controlable than 
the keyboard and is almost intolerable.  I would not recommend use 
of the joystick during play.
  
        The game goes somewhat like this.  You must make your way 
through a maze of obstacles and people to finally kiss the princess 
and wake her from sleep.  Sounds kind of cliche?  Well it is; 
it is just another feeble attempt at a Prince Charming story.  
During play, there are several reccuring obstacles, such as a fat 
opera singer and a snake.  The opera singer is a fat, ugly lady 
with a viking hat and a rolling pin.  She chases you through some 
of the first scenes trying to smash you with the rolling pin.  The 
snake is also introduced at the beginning of the story. It is a colorful, 
stupid looking snake.  He shows up later in the story and you must 
out-wit him again.

        The story is an old one, but really never fails to bring 
attention and raise emotions.  It is an alright story-line, but I think 
that it could have been worked on and improved.

        The game also supports SoundBlaster, Adlib and some 
other sound cards.  I have only heard the SoundBlaster and oh 
boy!  That was a treat.  The SoundBlaster has digitized voice and 
other really interesting sound effects.  This may even be one of 
the best parts of the game.  The SoundBlaster veteran may not be as 
impressed as I was with this, but I assure you that anyone will 
like it.  If you do not have a sound card, the game supports no 
sound.  That's kind of snobbish and I really didn't like that 
feature.

        All together, the game is well put together and nicely 
done.  Although I can point out its errors, the game is so 
enormously well done, that it overpowers you.  I beleive that it 
is one of the better games out today, even in competition with Wing 
Commander and the like.  If you have a SoundBlaster and VGA, then 
this game will not fail you.  If you are lacking the SoundBlaster, 
then you will be just as duly impressed.  I have not seen the 
game in other video modes, and do not have much to comment on 
them.  I would think that the EGA would be semi-decent, and I do 
not even think the game supports CGA. 

        All together, this is a great game that I do 
fully recommend for all ages.  It works well and is nicely done.

                               Wing Commander
                             from Origin Systems

                              By Pat McCormick

      "NO!!!!!" I scream for the tenth time, watching as my
character in the cockpit helplessly shields himself as his ship
disintegrates from the final enemy blast. Then the camera moves to
the deck of the carrier, where my funeral is held and my body is
shot off into space...
      This is Wing Commander, the ultimate war game in space. You
are a pilot for the TCS Tiger's Claw, of the Confederation, locked
in a deadly war with the feline Kilrathi. What you do, basically,
is go out on missions with computer-controlled character as your
wingman, and come back alive, mission accomplished. But this is no
plain vanilla shoot-em-up. Using VGA graphics, expanded memory, and
an advanced graphics system, Origin has made what may be the finest
simulation ever. All of the battlefield imagery is not the usual
blocky polygon images us Microprose fans are so used to, but high-
detail bitmapped images. Also, pictures in the cockpit and aboard
the Claw are 256-color VGA. But you need a powerful system to
receive all of its benefits.
      When I ran it on a 10-Mhz 286 with 640k RAM, an AdLib card,
and a hard drive, it was not fast enough for my tastes, and I lost
many of the graphics shown on the box because did not have expanded
memory. For example, you do not get large explosions, visible
damage in the cockpit (panels blowing out, for example) and visual
contact on your communicator with 640k. But when I saw it on a 16
Mhz 286 with a megabyte of RAM, it was much faster, and many of the
graphics not seen on the 10 Mhz computer came out in full force on
the 16 Mhz computer.
      The game is a graphics and music extravaganza. Aboard the
Claw, you can talk to characters in the bar who talk, blink, snarl,
and smile. Your briefing is given by Commander Halcyon, and you are
assigned a ship, a wingman, and a mission. After the briefing, you
watch you and your fellow pilots rush to their fighters, and
finally launch into space. In combat, you can use any of the
variety of weapons your ship has to defeat the evil Kilrathi. The
detail in battle of the bitmapped images is beyond compare. You can
talk to your wingman, and insult the enemy as you send laser blasts
across his bow. The music that plays during the game really
heightens the tension; Origin has the music change smoothly to
different themes, depending on your situation in battle. And your
wingman is as mortal as you are: A few times that I let my wingman
fend for himself, he died, and I ended up watching HIS funeral at
the end of the mission. Needless to say, you don't see him at the
bar anymore. Likewise, you are rewarded with a ceremony if you were
exceptional in combat.
      Unlike other fighting games you may have played, Wing
Commander does not make up random missions, but follows a set
"tree" of missions. You do not have to win every mission, you just
end up following a different path on the tree if you lose. If you
become an expert at Wing Commander, and win the Vega Campaign,
additional data disks, called the Secret Missions, can be installed
for many more hours of enjoyment. They include new missions, new
enemies, and a new storyline to follow. So far, I have played the
Vega Campaign (original), Secret Missions, and Secret Missions 2.
I haven't won any of them yet, but they are all extremely
addictive. You are forced to "live" the game, because at any
moment, the war can hinge on your victory or defeat.

SUMMARY:

Title:   Wing Commander
Company: Origin Systems
Hardware Needed: High-density floppy drives, EGA or VGA, 10-Mhz or
faster, 640k (can use exp. memory). A hard drive, external sound,
expanded memory, and a 16 Mhz computer are recommended.
Copy Protection: Need numbers from included schematics.
In Short: The best space war shoot-em-up you will see today!

                               Space Quest IV
                     "Roger Wilco And The Time Rippers"
                            Sierra On-Line, Inc.

                              By Pat McCormick

    Space Quest IV is Sierra's latest and best offering in their
line of state of the art 3D adventure games. "Roger Wilco And The
Time Rippers" continues the funny, satirical Space Quest line
starring Roger Wilco, our heroic janitor. Close on the heels of
King's Quest V, SQIV includes full 256 color VGA support as well
as digitized audio and beautifully orchestrated music. All of these
features have a price, however: The 256 color version (16 color is
available also) comes on high-density disks totalling a whopping
7 megabytes! For best performance, it is suggested that you use it
on a 10-Mhz or faster machine with a hard drive and some external
sound support. But it is worth it!
        The story picks up after the end of Space Quest III, where
Roger is returning home to Xenon. During the introduction, he makes
a pit stop at Magrathea first, and is seized by the Sequel Police.
Suddenly, he is freed by an unknown savior, who quickly opens a
time rip and transports him into Space Quest XII, "Vohaul's Revenge
II". Here, the adventure starts. Using the new icon-bar interface,
introduced in King's Quest V, you move, see, talk, and complete
actions with Roger. The humor of the designers is apparent in the
descriptions and animations. For example, one of the first things
to do is capture the famed "Energizer bunny" of TV commercial fame.
During the game, with its nonstop graphics and sound, you move
through time and space, visiting four different Space Quests (even
go back to the past, to the original Space Quest!) As you play the
game, Roger gets captured by the "Latex Babes of Estros", is
pummeled by monochrome bullies, turns transvestite, and still has
to save the entire time-space continuum from the wrath of Sludge
Vohaul!
        Unfortunately, the game suffers from a few deficiencies,
due to (I believe) its hasty release. For one thing, the puzzles are
extremely easy compared to other Sierra games. The icon bar doesn't
help this. The commands used to play the game are walk, look, talk,
do, taste, smell, and use an object from the inventory. Taste and
smell are not even necessary to finish the game! I solved more than
one puzzle by accidentally clicking the "do" icon on an object.
Because of this, it takes much less time to solve than most Sierra
games. Also, the ending is something less than you'd expect. But
Space Quest IV still makes better use of graphics and sound than
almost any other game on the market. And it will keep you laughing!


SUMMARY:

Title:  Space Quest IV - "Roger Wilco And The Time Rippers"
Company:  Sierra On-Line
Hardware Needed:  VGA (16-color version for EGA and lower is
available separately), high-density disk drive, 10 mhz or faster.
Hard drive and external sound capability are highly recommended.
Copy Protection:  Need codes from manual.
In Short:  A funny, exciting adventure game, with some of the best
graphics and sound I've ever seen.

 Description: Your people were nearly wiped out when they were driven from
 their homeland generations ago.  Now, their numbers have grown, and many
 think that it is time to march and reclaim the homeland.  But the coming
 battle is anything but certain, for the enemy is very formidable.  A party
 must first recover the Staff of Retribution, a talisman of enormous power
 that was hidden by the priests when the final battle was fought outside
 the great temple named "Sanctuary".  With this power, victory would be
 more assured.

 So you find yourself leading the party, sneaking into enemy territory in a
 desperate bid to win entry into Sanctuary and then to try to discover
 where and how the Staff was hidden. But when you near the site, your
 entire band is wiped out in a surprise attack! You are the only
 survivor...but the Staff must be found!

 Comment: Every time I think that Sam has peaked out, he comes up with
 something new that amazes me.  With this adventure he again breaks new
 ground.  Starting with the 'encumbrance' system that originally appeared
 in 'The Boy and the Bard', it has been greatly expanded into what Sam
 calls 'ACE': Advanced Combat & Encumbrance.  ACE has many new features
 never seen before in Eamon.  Among them is a combat system that takes
 distance into account--for example, you might be pinned down by enemy
 bowmen who you would have no choice but to shoot with arrows. You carry a
 quiver and must actually nock an arrow for each round (this isn't as
 inconvenient as it sounds, for there are several different types of magic
 arrows available).

 There is TONS more Good Stuff.  Surprise attacks are possible.  You must
 brew your own healing potions.  More magic than you can shake a stick at.
 Lots of sophisticated combat.  Dozens of subtle puzzles.  Sam buries you
 in clues; which are real and which are bogus?  Most are real, but you will
 have to work it all out.

 Hack'n'Slashers can pass this one by; even the combat requires careful
 thought: sword or bow?  What kind of arrow? Is this thing supernatural?
 Is it charging?  Omigod, what weapons do I have readied?  A mindless
 approach will not give satisfactory results!  And some of the puzzles are
 pretty complicated, though I found them all to be reasonable.

 It's hard to judge the difficulty.  The SOLUTIONS program gives you a
 progression of hints that work right up to outright solutions of each
 puzzle and trap.  If you do it all yourself, it probably rates a (9) or
 (9.5) difficulty. If you use the hints, it of course drops considerably.

 One hint: if you think that you have run across some typos or mapping
 screwups, the odds are pretty good that you haven't!  I missed entry into
 a series of important puzzles because I made this mistake.

 I can't decide if this is the best Eamon that Sam has ever done, but it is
 certainly a contender!

                                  Countdown
                                  by Access

                              By Pat McCormick


      Countdown is the latest in a series of adventure games by
Access. Like its predecessor, Mean Streets, Countdown uses top-
quality VGA graphics and the digitized RealSound system. The
storyline is this: You are a man, trapped in a Turkish mental
asylum with no memory, and you have only a few days to save the
world.
      As you look at certain objects in the game, flashbacks appear
that give you a better idea of who you are and why you are in this
asylum. The flashbacks, I believe, are the best part. Real actors
were used to provide the synchronized video and audio flashbacks,
which are really mini-movies on disk. And the flashbacks add words
to your list of things you can ask people you talk to about. When
you talk to people, you can hassle them, bribe them, or be pleasant
and helpful. Different combinations of these moods can provide
important pieces of information needed to find out who you are,
why you were put here, and who wants to kill you.
      Countdown contains many tough puzzles in your quest to escape
the asylum and find out why you ended up there in the first place.
But along the way the RealSound system provides effects such as
snoring, doors opening, and your shoes clicking on the floor, as
well as providing voice to the flashbacks, through your own PC
speaker. You might be put into an asylum before finishing this one!

SUMMARY:
Title:      Countdown
Company:    Access
Hardware Needed: VGA display. Hard drive and mouse are recommended.
In Short:   A well put together, but dastardly tough, adventure game
that will keep you up nights playing it.

                                    Links
                                  by Access

                              By Pat McCormick

      Links, the new golf simulation by Access, is the most
realistic rendition of golf ever made. Using full 256-color VGA
graphics and Access' proprietary RealSound technology, Links makes
you feel like you are really there! The course that comes with the
game is the Torrey Pines South Course, located in California. The
game designers actually went to Torrey Pines and took pictures and
videotape of the entire golf course, then combined all of their
material to make a very close computer rendition of the actual
course. The trees, ocean, and clubhouse are all visible from your
standpoint, and the RealSound digitized bird tweets complete the
illusion of a sunny day alone on the course.
      Even with all of these tremendous graphics, the game does not
skimp on the simulation. Any and all variables are adjustable, from
the angle of your feet to the placement of the ball. For those who
don't want to fool with the many settings, 3 preset setups are
available, for a draw, straight, or fade shots, and you can set up
two custom arrangements for use throughout the game. You select 13
clubs out of a large selection, from drivers to an L-wedge (which
has an even steeper angle than a pitching wedge.) A helpful grid
is available for those tough putts, so you can see the slopes and
valleys of the green. It also allows both a forward and reverse
angle replay at the end of your shot.
      The digitized RealSound support, playing equally well through
either the speaker (which tends to be a bit soft), or a supported
sound board, adds an element of "being there" to the game. Besides
the sounds of the swing and sinking the ball into the hole, it also
provides occasional commentary, ranging from the obvious "It seems
I've hit a tree, Jim." to the motivating "Get down!" as it sails
over the green.
      But Links, with the complex graphics and digitized sound, eats
up much computing power. It requires a large hunk of memory, and
runs rather slowly if you do not have some expanded memory for the
loading of certain objects. Also, the screen redraws take some
time, even on a 16 Mhz machine.  But if you are into a realistic
and eye-opening golf simulation, Links is the game for you!

SUMMARY:

Title:      Links
Company:    Access
Hardware Needed:  VGA graphics, fast machine (at least 8 or 10, 16
or 20 recommended), 640k (can use expanded memory). Hard drive is
recommended. Various sound boards are also supported.
In Short:   A colorful, realistic golf simulation that will take you
into the action.

                           Sierra CD ROM Releases
                           ----------------------

Sierra actualizes the long-time dream of CD-ROM (Compact Disk, Read Only
Memory) applications with its re-introduction of Mixed Up Mother Goose CD-ROM
and King's Quest V.  Attractive 256 color high resolution background paintings
combined with delightful animation, a charming stereo soundtrack and digitized
speaking and singing voices bring a new experience in computer gaming to all.

Ken Williams, Sierra President/CEO says, "Our games have basically outgrown
what can be put in one box.  When you are shipping fifteen disks per game the
question of space becomes critical, and to reach the heights we want in terms
of quality and true interactive "film-like" entertainment is within the grasp
of every computer owner.  With each CD storing as much information as 1,800
5.25" diskettes, Sierra has been able to add whole new dimensions to its CD
products. Sierra's CD-ROM products that are scheduled for release by Summer
1991 include Mixed-Up Mother Goose, King's Quest V (will ship on TWO CD-ROM
discs), and Space Quest IV.  Additional details available in the New Release
Menu options for respective products.

Suggested retail price for our CD-ROM games will be $69.95 ($59.95 for Mother
Goose) when they are available.  Any CD-ROM drive that uses a read ahead buffer
or intelligent buffer that supports the High Sierra (ISO 9600) format for
CD-ROM should be compatible with the new upcoming releases.  Brands that have
this feature include Toshiba, Sony, NEC.  Full support for most industry
supported music hardware will be included, however in order to use the
digitized speech feature, a DAC channel will be necessary.  Current hardware
which support this feature include the Tandy 1000 TL/XL and the SoundBlaster
card.  Additional stand alone DAC channel cards will be available in the near
future.
