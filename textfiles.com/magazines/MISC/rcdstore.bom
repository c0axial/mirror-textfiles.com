    ------------------------------------------------------------------

        First off, to comply with the disclaimer, i must ask you 
        not to use this incredibly easy, efficent, foolproof, 
        error-free, so-simple-an-idiot-could-pull-it-off method
        for purposes as stated in the title.  Getting to the point,
        this does work, and i have acquired several CD's and tapes
        with it.  You require the following:

        1 (ONE) Brain with an IQ of 2 or better
        1 (ONE) Shopping bag <hopefully one that is not flimsy,
                See-through, or larger than a normal CD

        Once you acquire the following, you can get started.  Enter 
        the store.  You should let your eyes trace the walls and 
        ceiling for any security cameras.  Then find a CD that you 
        want.. or a tape.  Notice that it has see-through wrapping.
        At this point, you can do one of 2 things: 1. Wrip off the 
        celophane <the see-through shit> and sneak the item into your 
        bag, leaving the waste material behind.  I do not reccomend
        this, because it is messy, and takes a while..long enough
        to get noticed.  Plus, you have to dispose of the wrapping. 
        If you keep it on you, you will set off an alarm.  

        Method two.  This works for me.  Pick up the parcel <the CD>
        and inspect it, as if to be looking at the songs, the pic on 
        the front/back.  Look at the price tag, the UPC tag, anything
        that is not part of the wrapper, or box.  You should find
        something metallic.  These vary in size from a tiny one the 
        size of a hole in a paper from a hole punch, to a strip thats 
        a good 3-4 inches long.. when you find it, well, you should be 
        able to rip the fucker off without trouble.  You could bring 
        an X-acto blade to cut the plastic so you can take the tags off,
        since in most cases, the metal is under them, but usually visable.

        If you cant find anything like mentioned, hang near the counter.
        Look at the items surrounding the counter.  When the cashier gets 
        a CD from someone, watch what they do.  If they use a roller, 
        watch where they roll.  Record World uses a simple strip 3 inches
        long and 2mm wide, and its only taped on!  I just go to Macys, or
        some store with big bags, and i get one.  Then walk over, and do 
        the deed.  

        If you cant tell from looking at it, and the person at the register 
        does nothing to unprotect it, maybe its not protected, or they are
        pressing a button when you leave, but i doubt it.  

        If you have any questions, E-Mail me on most fine bbs's, or over
        the net Echo Of The Damned.  You can also Reach me via EntropyNet
        or Abyssal Net.

        And remember, these tactics could shorten your days in the free 
        world, and if you use em and go crying to me, its not my problem
        because in the beginning i told you not to do this, and it is for
        informational purposes.
