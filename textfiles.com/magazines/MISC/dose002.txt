                     Destruction Of Public Equilibrium
=============================================================================
                   "The Evils of Business Corporations"
=============================================================================

     Man... I started this Silicon Zine because I had a lot to say, and I was
also kinda bored.  I got a LOT of great support, but then it died out for the
past few weeks you might have noticed.  I have been REALLY busy, and seeing
how I never got any members (I actually did, but haven't called them in a 
while) nobody could really keep this up while I was busy... then I was
talking to The Dark Prophet (of 6PH) and realized I had dropped my interests
and status in the scene.  So I'm here to give you a quick update, and just
tell you to hang in there.  I am actually making most of this off of my head
but I'm sure there's a lesson to be learned in here somewhere... ;)

THE EVILS OF CORPORATIONS
-------------------------

     I have an issue in mind, and learned some stuff that you might be
enlightened with.  I was discussing Anarchy and Rebellion and stuff with one
of my friends (non-modemer).  He's a real active Anti-Corporation Punk Rocker
and really fucking cool too (how many 20 year olds do you know have nose 
rings still?).  I learned alot about how everything in society fits in.  He
only listens to 7 inches and stuff (those are records) and sold all of his
CD's.  I'll start with the basics of corporations.  Corporations are all
those big companies that run the US (Sears, Banks, Mattel, MTV) and basically
are those rich old white guys (no I'm not black).  It starts with advertising
their products, and TV and stuff.  Everybody says "I HATE COMMERICALS" when
they watch the tube... but they are very important.  The TV shows you see are
able to go on the air because the corporations fund the shows, and in turn
they get to advertise their product in between the intermissions.  It works
the same way on the airwaves too.  

So it's like this:
People watch the show - The product gets advertised - People buy the product
- The corporations get more money - Corporations advertise more

And then you're back to square one.  What's so bad about that you might ask?

Well nothing, yet.  But then you have a problem, if the corporations draw
back and stop advertising, then the funds for the shows drop, the TV company
loses viewers, and eventually the TV company dies.  So the big guys running
the corporations have a great deal of power over the media, and what you guys
and girls see.  Although it may not change the way YOU look at things, it
DOES change the way other people look at things.  So not only does TV
advertise products, but it advertises beliefs.  The corporations can control
TV shows in this way also.  If they want to or don't want to see something
on a show, then it will change to their desires.

CORPORATE ROCK SUCKS!
---------------------


     One thing that many people don't really understand is what corporate
rock really is, and what the difference is.  Corporate rock is simply the
bands which are owned by Major labels like Epic or Warner, MGM and all the
really big ones.  So what's the difference?  The difference is that the 
bands under these labels are the dolls of the corporations which is a puppet
master above them... and the strings are cash.  Makes me kinda sick to think
that all these teen idols, and role models are really in it for the money
and you can't tell if they are being sincere.  That makes MTV pretty horrible
because it is ALL corporate rock.  I think you know without saying that rock
stars are BIG INFLUENCES on the youth of America, so if Eddie Vedder wore
a hairstyle, then a lot of people would wear that hairstyle and crap like
that.  Crap... I used to like Pearl Jam, but then the Record Label must have
made them release more albums that was on their contract [now they suck]...

Well... this is all I'm gonna bring to you now... I'm just informing you on
how some things work.  I don't expect anybody to stop watching TV and buying
music and stuff, but just informing you on some facts on how Broadcasting
works... Later...

=============================================================================
Oh.. just thought I'd tag this on here before I release this...

I need some people to Distribute DoSE, write articles, code stuff... whatever

If you got some skill I could use, then please write back, and send me your
qualifications, and skills, and stuff... the better it is, the better your
chances...
