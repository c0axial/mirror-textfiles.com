----- Necronomicon Press Issue 1

Alone in a suburban house, four people sat around a table.  The first was
John Draper, or "Captain Crunch."  The second was Joe Engressia.  And the
other two were nameless blind people.  There they sat, relics of the past,
contemplating the past as if it were more genuine than the present.
 
23 miles away, four CIA agents in a van were speeding in the direction
of these four relics.  The first one on the left, code named "Agent Steel,"
was just that: steel.  His nerves were steel and his heart was steel.  The
next person to the right of Agent Steel was Mogel, the CIA expert on
terrorism and threats to society.  The third, sitting next to Agent Mogel,
was Creed, a man with no family and very little conscience.  The last man
was Joe.  Joe was a man set out to destroy the future dissidents and heretics
that would influence a number of the nation's youth to run amok and pillage
computer factories in an effort to destroy the 'information era.'  These men
did not play games, nor did they exist to commit worthless acts of sabotage
or mayhem.  But there was one thing they were good at, and that was killing.
 
210 miles up into the earth's atmosphere was an eagle.  The eagle had razor-
sharp eyes.  Its eyes could pierce the earth and search out anything.  The
eagle was a satellite, part of the NSA's keyhole satellite system.  The
eagle's mission was to keep an eye on John Draper and to see if he was
causing any disruptions in the balance between the government and the people.
John was a threat to the government.  The government had seen his mind, and
they knew what he was thinking.  They hated him, but they needed him, also.
As the satellite passed over John Draper's home, its lens opened and started
to "roll tape" on the house.  All quiet.  It relayed this information down to
the NSA headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland.  From the NSA it went over a
datalink fiber-optic cable to the Pentagon, all the while encrypted with the
tightest encryption methods.  From the Pentagon it would be sent to the CIO -
the Central Imagery Office.
 
Four blocks away from John Draper's home, 23 FBI agents waited in four black
unmarked vans.  Their mission was to secure the area around John Draper's
home and to evacuate the neighbors.  They were used to this kind of thing.
The CIA often used them for tedious tasks, although this was against policy.
Of course, this was never mentioned outside of the two agencies.

Back in John Draper's house, the four of them talked the new, upcoming plans
they would implement for their new world order.  They spoke of acts of
terrorism, in the Government's eyes.  They spoke of heretical ideas and
views.  They brought fear to the Government.  But the Government had faced
this sort of thing before, and they knew how to deal with it.  They knew how
to wipe out the spots that caused the Americans to get out of order, and they
knew how to reverse things and set things back up right.  Yet it did not
appear so.  It seemed like everyday people were being undermined in the so-
called civilized society.  But this was all propaganda.  And few knew of it.
Joe Engressia sensed something was wrong.  There was a noise, a strange
noise.  It came from outside.  It sounded like a block party.

"I think something's happening outside," said Joe.

"Check it out," John said.

Outside the house Joe saw that people were being thrown out of their houses
and taken into vans.  The roads were being blocked off, and the once-quiet
suburban street was being emptied out.  "Shit, something's going on."  The
others went to the window; they all felt what was coming.

The FBI agents were almost done evacuating the block and the roadblocks were
in place.  The CIA agents would be there any moment now, and the mission
would be completed shortly.

"Fuck this, i'm getting out of here," said John Draper as he hauled ass to
his back door.  But just then, in an instant, two CIA agents burst down the
back door and tackled The Captain.  As John wrestled with the CIA agents on
the floor, a third appeared from the front door and hit John with a billy
club, rendering him unconscious.  The other three, seeing what had happened,
attempted to flee out the front door, but three FBI agents already were
there, waiting.  The three FBI agents approached them and injected a fluid
into the other three's necks.  In a couple seconds the three were on the
floor, unconscious.
 
Several men that 'did not exist' carried the four "terrorists" out the door
and threw them into another black unmarked van.  The inside of the van was
padded, with no windows or handles on the door.  The four were handcuffed,
just in case they would wake up before they reached their destination.  Time
passed, and the group of men separated by views and ethics reached one of the
many CIA branch offices secretly located around the country.
 
Joe Engressia was already awake, but still in a daze.  They had been laid on
stretchers and securely strapped down so they could barely move.  Joe
Engressia and the two other blind people had been moved together to a room
several stories below the ground.  The top of the CIA branch office was a
front.  It was a legit business that made microprocessors.  Only the Chairman
and a few other members on the board, who were CIA agents, knew of the secret
levels below the factory.
 
The room where Joe Engressia and the other two were stored was not painted.
The walls were concrete, there were no windows, and there was only one door,
which was solid steel.  Once again, as in the van, it had no inside handle.
On the top of the right wall was a long mirror, which Joe suspected to be a
monitoring two-way mirror.
 
John Draper had been wheeled into a similar room, but it was padded.  In
fact, every wall - even the ceiling and floor of the room - was padded.
Again, on the right wall toward the ceiling was another large mirror.  John
Draper was released from the stretcher and thrown onto the padded floor.  The
door quickly closed behind him.  As in the other room there was no handle,
but the door was padded, unlike the other room.
 
It must have been hours that they were left there.  By now all four of them
had regained conciousness and were fully awake.  The rooms were pitch dark.
They had lights, but were not turned on.  Later, after a wait that seemed
almost like days, a man came into the room and fed the three in the
stretchers.  John Draper, in the other room, was not fed, however.
 
Several days passed and the four where beginning to lose all hope of ever
seeing light again, let alone be released.  John Draper was starving and had
soiled his clothes.  The other four were sometimes escorted to the bathroom,
and sometimes fed.  John started to show signs of malnutrition.  The CIA
agents sensed this and fed him a small meal and gave him some injections.  It
was not enough to properly feed John but it kept him from dying.  Several
more days passed and "The Captain" was taken into another room.  This room
was smaller, but it had a cot and a toilet and sink.  Other then that, there
was nothing - not even sheets for the cot.  The lights in the room were dim
but better then the days of darkness he had somehow survived.  He was fed
once a day and began to gain weight.

The next day John was taken into yet another room and was strapped into a
chair similar to a dentist's.  The room was not unlike the first room he was
in, except its lights were turned on, and the inside door had a handle.
Agent Mogel entered the room and John recognized him at once as the agent who
first tackled him back at his house.  A metal cart next to the chair carried
a large box on it, with a voltage meter and two wires leading out of it into
John's blood stream, like an IV needle.  John sensed what this was.
 
"State your full name." Agent Mogel demanded.

"Fuck... you..." John said.  At once the voltage in the box was raised, and
at Mogel's command, John felt PAIN.  He screamed out and felt as if his
scream would never end - but it did, and the pain was then over.

"That was the lowest level.  You refuse to answer my questions or lie to me,
and I will increase the level up one step."

"Please... no more.. no more..", moaned Captain Crunch.

"Just answer the questions.  Now, state your full name."

"John Lewis Draper."

"Good, and your occupation?"

"I make corporate web pages."

The interrogation went on for two hours this way, asking meaningless
questions.  Finally it began to pick up.  "What do you think of the
government?"

"I don't mind it."

"WRONG.  You hate it, I told you not to lie."  The box was once again
activated and even more pain flowed into The Captain.  "Are you ready to
answer with truth?"

No answer.

"ARE YOU READY TO ANSWER WITH TRUTH?" persisted the agent.

"Yes.." said John in a low voice.

"Good.. now what do you think of the government?"

"I hate it and everything it stands for."

"Very good - you did not lie this time.  I know when you lie and when you
speak the truth, so don't even attempt to lie again."
 
Over a thousand miles away in Philly, 50 or so computer geeks where gathered,
chatting about IRC and computers.  The convention was called 'Dummercon' and
was a get-together for e'zine writers and readers from the IRC channel
#zines. Many of them possessed a great deal of knowledge - not just
computers, but on real-world topics.  Many of them were antisocial people,
looking for attention on IRC.  Some of them were dreamers, and some of them,
hopeless.  One stood out from the crowd.  He was most different from the rest
of the crew, and was also viewed as a threat to the government.  His handle
was phorce.  phorce was very interested in all kinds of computer-related
topics, but his main interest was the government.  His room at home was lined
with books about the DoD, CIA, NSA, FBI, and other government-related topics.
Some of his favorites were written by George Orwell, such as _1984_, or
_Animal_Farm_.  He did not have a like for the government as it might have
seemed, but he hated it.  He wanted to undermine it and he wanted to control
it at the same time.  No, phorce was not an anarchist seeking to destroy the
government and for everyone to be equal - he was out to rule the government,
and to control it and it's people.  Like John Draper, he was also being
watched.  But because of his age, it would be a little more complicated to
capture and "cure" him.  The government would have to wait until later for
this.
 
The convention went on and phorce spoke with many of the different friends he
had never met before, apart from their typing on a computer screen.  Federal
agents where present, as usual, and watching phorce.  They noted everything
he did, and even his gestures and facial expressions, which later they would
decipher to see what he might have been thinking.  phorce possessed skill and
courage, and later in life would become a REAL threat to the government.
The feds knew this; but, of course, if the feds' plans went right (and they
always did), he would never reach that level and would be "cured."

With phorce was another person.  His handle was Mutter.  Mutter was satanic.
He believed in his cause very much, and he believed that at his death, Satan
would save him, and he would live forever in pain.  Pain that he accepted and
which he would enjoy, he thought.  Mutter was a fool, he believed these
things which most people did not, and most people were not fools.  Mutter,
however, was not a threat to the government.  The government's view on Mutter
was 'let him think how he wants.'  He posed no threat to the government.
Sure, one day in life he might murder, or steal - but that did not affect the
government.  It only undermined society, and the government is not society;
the government is the illuminati of the world, controlling all.
 
Just as John Draper and Mutter tried to undermine the government and to
somehow stop it they knew it would never work.  The government picks them out
from society, and they know the bad apples soon after they are born.  The
government is insane, not the people.  The people are stupid, but not
insane.
 
One day, as always, the illuminati will crash and burn.  And only from the
rubble of the old empire will emerge another group of patriots to form a new
government and to control people again, gradually tightening their hold on
the people's minds and actions.  Humans can never protect themselves from
each other.  One day, all will be clear when death becomes a reality and you
are joined with the other side.  Life is insanity controlled by a few humans,
and it can never be stopped.  Death is freedom when everything becomes clear.
 
Author's notes:
 
Who are these people?  Well, some of the names are real, and all of the 
handles are real.  No one in this story is real, however, and the people in
real life are not anything like the characters in this story.  What is all of
this?  Is it shit?  I don't know, but it was a thought of mine, and it caused
me to change a lot of my viewpoints on things.
