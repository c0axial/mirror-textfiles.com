1994-01-02  Purpose of the mini-Journal (*)

The mini-Journal of Irreproducible Results publishes news about overly
stimulating research and ideas. Specifically:

A) Haphazardly selected superficial (but advanced!) extracts of research
news and satire from the Journal of Irreproducible Results (JIR).

B) News about the annual Ig Nobel Prize ceremony. Ig Nobel Prizes honor
"achievements that cannot or should not be reproduced." A public
ceremony is held at MIT, in Cambridge Massachusetts, every autumn. The
ceremony is sponsored jointly by JIR and by the MIT Museum.

C) News about other science humor activities conducted by the MIT Museum
and JIR.

"The Wrinkle Factor Gene" by Max F. Rothschild
This paper describes experiments to identify a gene responsible for
excessive wrinkling in pigs, and subsequently in dogs and humans.

"Continuous Force Induced Medial Movement of the External Auditory
Medial Movement of the External Meatus and Auricle" by Laurence I. Barsh
To help prevent the spread of diseases, most notably AIDS, most dentists
now routinely wear masks that cover the mouth and are help in place with
elastic bands around the ears. A 36-month study assesses how much
"orthodontic" movement of the ear is induced by the continuous tensile
force which these bands exert.

"Footnotes to the First Paragraph of Chapter Three" by David Weinberger
Key literary, philosophical and technological allusions are identified
and explained for a brief quotation attributed to James Joyce, a senior
Vice President at a brokerage firm in Albany, New York. The quote was
discovered in the journal "Information Week," in paragraph 3 of an
article about high technology restructuring.

"The Effects of Peanut Butter on the Rotation of the Earth" by George
August, Anita Balliro et al
An extensive multidiscipinary study analyzes the effects of peanut
butter on the rotation of the earth.

"Untoward Behavior at the Third First Annual Ig Nobel Prize Ceremony" by
Francesca Thurston and Stephen Drew

1994-01-04  Commentary: The Gallo Case

Commentary by X. Perry Mental, Honorary Chairman, The Society for Basic
Irreproducible Research (SBIR)

     "Misconduct charges against Gallo withdrawn..."
          ---Nature, 366, 191, 1993

     "US clears top AIDS scientist"
          ---International Herald Tribune, Nov 13, 1993, p. 5

These are the surprising[1] headlines.  After nine years of suspicion
and 5 years of investigation, Dr Robert C. Gallo was cleared of all
charges of misconduct by the US dept of Health and Human Services
(USDHHS), after the office "abandoned hope of winning the final
adjudicatory hearing on Dr. Gallo..." because "the evidence produced by
ORI (Office of Research Integrity) did not stand up top legal scrutiny"
(Nature 366, 99, 1993). The charges against Gallo were that "he
misstated in a scientific article how important French research was to
his work and failed to give credit to another scientist (Gazdar) who had
invented the cell culture crucial to his work".

Actually the scapegoat[2] of the whole affair was Gallo's collaborator,
Mikulas Popovic, who originally was found by ORI guilty on 4 counts of
scientific misconduct (and as a result was unemployed for 4 years).
Popovic has now been exonorated by the USDHHS Appeals Board.

As a result of this whole affair, ORI is preparing revised guidelines on
the basis of which a scientist can be convicted of fraud only if he
(she) knew that "a sentence in his/her manuscript might be misleading."

Let us hope that this will be so.  Anyway, Power helps.

NOTES:
[1] to be accurate about it, let us say: "headlines surprising to many"

[2] one can rephrase this: "unfortunate victim"

results, and short notices of satiric and humorous intent. The editors
look forward to receiving your manuscripts, photographs, X-rays,
drawings, etc. Please do not send biological samples.

Articles are typically 500-2000 words in length. The entire manuscript
should be typed double-spaced on standard white bond paper, with
generous margins all around, and submitted with a photocopy.
Alternatively, you may submit via e-mail, in ASCII format.

Because of the volume of submissions, we are unable to acknowledge
receipt of manuscripts unless they are accompanied by a SELF-ADDRESSED,
ADEQUATELY STAMPED ENVELOPE.

1994-01-11  A Message From Our Beleaguered Technical Brains

We are currently experiencing some unfortunately non-irreproducible
difficulties.  One problem is that many subscribers are receiving
multiple copies of each issue.  With a list as large as MINI-JIR has
become, even behemoth computers seeem to have trouble getting everything
sent out in one try.  So, they start over and keep trying.  There is a
way around this problem -- maybe -- but we haven't been able to get it
implemented just yet.  In the mean time, as I suggested to one
subscriber who gave me information on his multiple copies, we suggest
that you use the extra copies to line the bottom of your virtual
birdcage for your ethereal parakeet.

A second significant problem is mail bounces we've received for users
whose nodes are not accepting mail.  Sometimes, nodes are not properly
registered; sometimes systems are down; sometimes the byte-sized Gods
just aren't smiling on us.  Subscribers in the United Kingdom seem to be
hardest hit.  As luck would have it, we haven't got a satisfactory
solution for this problem yet either.  If some kind colleague passes
this issue on to you because you didn't get your own copy, you can check
to see if you are properly subscribed by sending a one line message to:
        LISTSERV@MITVMA or LISTSERV@MITVMA.MIT.EDU
that reads:
        QUERY MINI-JIR
By return mail, you should receive information about your mail setting
for this list or a message stating that you are not subscribed.  If you
don't get anything at all, there's something wrong!  Check with your
local postmaster to see if the node is properly registered or what the
correct form of node name is.

"Surgical Management of an Epidemic of Penile Amputations in Siam," by
Kasian Bhanganada, Tu Chayavatana, Chumporn Pongnumkul, Anunt
Tonmukayakul, Piyasakol Sakolsatayadorn, Krit Komaratal, and Henry
Wilde, "The American Journal of Surgery," 1983, no. 146, pp. 376-382.
The report reads in part: "It became fashionable in the decade after
1970 for the humiliated Thai wife to wait until her [philandering]
husband fell asleep so that she could quickly sever his penis with a
kitchen knife. A traditional Thai home is elevated on pilings and the
windows are open to allow for ventilation. The area under the house is
the home of the family pigs, chickens, and ducks. Thus, it is quite
usual that an amputated penis is tossed out of an open window, where it
may be captured by a duck."
