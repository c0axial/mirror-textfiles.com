                   How To Contact BTW (also How To Submit):

1) Our Communications Director's InterNet address is david.shifren@asb.com
   If you are sending him submissions, please send them as enclosed files, not
   as the message body.

2) E-Mail me (or any other BTW member) on any BBS we call.  We can definitely
   be reached at BTW sites/distros/HQs.

3) We are working on a WHQ in the 516 area code with a matrix option for 
   submissions.

4) We are also working on obtaining a PO Box sometime soon.  However, this is
   nowhere near a top priority, so don't hold your breath.

5) Although I am not going to reveal our info here, anyone who has it can mail
   it to me or to The Maxx.
