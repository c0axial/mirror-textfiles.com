^   i~                     Big Shit, Another Lame Mag


                Yep, another fame-hungry computer geek hoping to satisfy his
innermost cravings of popularity, noteiritety, and uber-eliteness.  Another
mag to tell you how the world should be run and how to go about running it
that way.  It's more articles on "Hacking the CBI Computer Network."  And you
have the first issue right in your hands.

        Now that we have things clear, I will begin by telling you things that
will convince you that the message of this magazine is immortal and convince
you to view it as your bible from this day on.  Got that, good buddy?  Good.

        The purpose of this mag is nothing other than to inform the public of
what they SHOULD know, but aren't told by the government and media.  It will
also tell you the latest ways to pull yourself out of the drudgery by social
engineering and scamming.  This world is not someplace where one can survive
and become a full and complete person by sitting back and fitting into the
mold of society.  The future leaders in business, economics, and with any
help, politics will be the social eningeers of today's society.

        Yes, social engineering already takes place in governmental and
economic circles, but it isn't to create change, it's to maintain a status
quo and fine-tune opinions.  What will be discussed herein will be revolution-
ary compared to this pathatic display of what can be such a powerful tool.

        What exactly is the purpose of the magazine?  Well, it's not to help
change the would, or even a country.  It's not to plan for the future of
society.  It's to help you acquire money, connections, power, and information.
No matter what happens to these pathetic times we live in, most of the above
will still benefit you.  Even if you are picking this mag up five years from
now, much of it should still be current.  And if it isn't, that's your fault
for being too stupid to find Sabotage sooner.

^  ii~                  UPS Announces Two-for-One From the
                          Manufacturer of Your Choice


        Ever order something from a mail order house and have it shipped UPS?
Sure, just about everone has.  Ever have it show up on your doorstep when
you're out...you know...it was just left there by the UPS guy and no one signed
for it?  Are little bells and whistles going off in your head yet?  Well, it
should sound like the intro to "Time" by Floyd by now if you deserve to read
this mag.
        OK, so what exactly can you do here?  Let's establish a basis first:
you need to get a package delivered that you don't have to sign for.  Usually
UPS will leave regular ground shipments on your doorstep even if you aren't
home.  This is what you want, and you better not leave any notes on where to
put it or, "Just leave the package on the doorstep" because you just legally
claimed responsibility for the package.  This only works if the leave it
without you asking them to.
        Now, you come home and have your new whatever sitting on your doorstep.
Start smiling, because in a few weeks you'll have another.  Wait about 3 or 4
more business days, then call back and say, "Where is my goddamn package?  I
ordered this thing a week and a half ago!  Can you check on where it is?"
Chances are that it was sent out using UPS GroundTrack.  They will get the
GroundTrack numbers and call UPS only to find it was already delivered.
They'll call back and tell you that is was delivered on whatever day you picked
it up, and probably be stupid enough to ask, "Are you SURE you didn't get it
yet?"  Tell them to shove it up their ass, you want your new toy, and you want
it NOW.  They'll probably tell you that they need to call you back in a day or
two after they talk to UPS.  More than likely they'll put in a claim for the
"lost" package, as most places insure their shipments through UPS.  If you
are either pissed off enough or convincing and nice enough (the latter method
usually works best throughout this and all other phone contact scams) they
will ship out a replacment before they even get their UPS claim back (which
will take two or three weeks on average to be processed).
        This time, it doesn't matter if you sign for it or not.  Chances are
they will not drop it off unless you sign for it.  The won't drop anything
off unless someone it there to sign for a LONG time, so don't expect this to
work at the same address often.
        Now you have your second whatever it is.  If you ordered a hard drive,
congrats, you can always use more space.  If you ordered a new intake manifold
for your truck what the fuck do yount two for?  Well...to take advantage of
the "money-back satisfaction guarantee" that you were insightful enough to
look for before making your educated purchase.  Tell them it won't fit, it
sucks, you granny's Olds has a higher-performance intake on it that this piece
of shit you sent me, or whatever.  You just got one for free.

#Editor's Note: This text is a bit outdated in the equipment it talks about,
               but the general concept remains true and still works very
               well if properly done.

~This method has earned me a lot of good stuff, virtually any non-OEM company
will do business with you, Hayes, Xebec, Sony, Alpine, Hitachi, RCA, Hayes.
Look through a nice magazine, see something you like.  Once you find it, look
for a business phone number.  If there is one on the ad, then call it up, and
follow these steps:

B = You  C = Company

B: Hello, this is Joe Smith from Kplastic Magazine, may I speak to your
   Public Relations manager?
C: Sure Mr.Smith, you can reach him at 700-456-1000, ext 69, his name is
   Frank Getz.
B: Thank your sir, and have a nice day.
C: Thanks for calling First Class Peripherals!

    (call Frank Getz)

C: Good afternoon, First Class Peripherals, may I help you?
B: Hello is this Frank Getz, this is Joe Smith from Kplastic magazine?
C: Yes this is Frank Getz, what can I do for you today?
B: Hello, my name is Joe Smith, and I work for Kplastics magazine, and we are
   doing a story on Hard Disk Subsystems for the Apple II series, in our
   December Issue.  And we would like to include YOUR product in our survey.
   We were wondering if you could send us a interview system for a short
   period of 30 days for our story?
C: I'll have to check with some other associates, we'll need to ask a few
   questions first.  (ie: he asks how many subscribers you have)

B: Oh, my gosh, I believe we have a circulation of 190,000 people.
C: Ok, and who publishes your magazine?
B: We have a local printing office that does all our printing needs.

    <talk a little more, nothing really important>

C: Ok, where can I send the interview system to?
B: <Prearanged address>
C: Thank you, and we'll get one right out to you, thanks for calling Mr.Smith.
B: Ok Jack, and I'll be in contact with you again next week, have a nice
   weekend!
C: Oh you too!

You must be ready, when you do this, they might be cautious!  Some times
you have to do a lot more.  What you may need to do is to get a "No Charge 
Purchase Order".  Include your fake business name, and your fake alias on it,
and mark it up for:


Product                                      Unit Cost    Sale Cost
1 Sider 10 Megabyte Hard Disk                  $695.00        $0.00


Now once you have done this send it out to them, include a business letter.
Don't act like a complete hammer head when you do it.  Numbers look good.

So when doing this procedure, always have this list ready:

    o  A fake alias (ie, Joe Fitztein).  Be creative -- not overly.

    o  Have a fake business name.

    o  Have a 'No Charge Purchase Order' form ready!  Include your
       fake business name if possible.  If you can get a business
       logo onto the forms, do so..

    o  Have a circulation number ready -- ideal: 110,000

    o  Have a publisher name ready!  Use a fake name.

    o  Have your address ready for them to send it to. A PO box as
       described in the begining would do great -- but any address
       will do that you use for a 'dropoff' sit in carding and
       goods.


Have it all ready before hand!  Not after, impress him.  Be a pompous jerk.

If all works fine, and you have done a little planning, you will do fine.
Let me explain some terms we used, and give you some places to look.

                         Electronic Store of Your Choice

        It is so easy to rip off large electronic stores that you just HAVE to
take advantage of it.  If you want a new amplifier because you fried the old
one because your snowplow pump motor destroyed the electrical system of your
truck last winter (never happened to me of course.....<g>), or you want a
bigger hard drive...or anything like that, you should be able to pull this
scam off.  The only catch is that you need the cas to pay for what you want
for at least a few days.  Try this scam at stores like Silo, American
Electronics, or whatever you happen to have in your area.
        What you do is this: find an electronics store or whatever that is
too big for their own good.  You know what I mean...the sales people know
nothing, and they kiss ass to the point that they will accept a return for
any reason at all without any questions.  Well, let's say you have this fried
amp and you want to new one.  Go buy an identical one, and return the old one
in the new packaging.  In case they check to make sure you actually returned
the new one, just clean the old one up to look like new.  If it's scratched or
whatever, get out your screwdriver and put the old guts in the new case and
return that.  A few minutes of work and you won't get busted.  Most times they
don't even look.  To ensure this, open the packaging very carefully and note
how everything is packed.  Put it back together exactly the same way, and try
to make it look like it hasn't even been opened.....the tell them you didn't
even open it (oh...I bought it for my brother but it's the wrong one.  You
weren't open last night so we bough it somewhere else).
        A variation on this one it raping computer for everything they're
worth.  But one, take out EVERYTHING you can't see with the case closed
(hard drive, internal modem, video card, controllers, motherboard...whatever)
and return the rest.  If the store is big enough and you make your excuse
convincing enough they won't even check.  This is another case where repacking
exactly the way it came is important, since you really don't want them checking
it.  And even if you do get busted...deny you even opened it and tell them
it must have came that way.  They kiss so much ass in those stores that chances
are you'll get away with it.
        Some final notes on this: it's always best to pay in cash.  It also
helps to have your excuses ready beforehand so nothing sounds suspicious.
Also, don't overlook casing the store beforehand.  Spend some time in there,
find out their return policies, and figure out just how much the sales
people know.  Maybe even have one of your friends buy something and return
it a few days later (without doing anything to it) to see what their return
procedures are...but remember to act like you don't know when you go to do it
yourself.  Sometimes it even helps to have someone else return the "altered"
item for you.  It all depends on the location.  And a final reminder: the
higher the price of the item, the more likely they will be to check it more
thoroughly.
