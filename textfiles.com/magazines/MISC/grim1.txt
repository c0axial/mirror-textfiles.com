                              Editor's Note
                              -------------

        Well after a 1 year hiatus, the Grimore is back in 
action (we hope) and better than ever.  We've decided to 
take the Grimore to a level it seems Scrye, Conjure, Inquest, 
and the plethora of On-line fanzines that have popped up all 
over the place couldn't reach (or at least haven't reached yet,
IMHO).  
        To that of the competent player.  No more "Lich-Mirror 
Universe" combos, or useless ranting (o.k., maybe one or two 
useless ranting per-issue but that's it!).  We're going to attempt 
to make The Grimore the first Magic: The Gathering fanzine 
that doesn't insult the intelligence of the experienced player.  
To that end, you'll see a few changes around here, and in our 
magazine.  We still hope everyone will read, because we think 
there is a lot this publication has to offer for both beginners 
and veteran deulists.  We'll still keep our top ten, and mention 
a few prices.  But the big price guide carried in issues 1-3 is 
gone (look to Shadis for that!).  We would like to have some 
success in our contests, and we have Grimore sponsored 
tournament (starting here in the west) in the works.  But 
more on that later.  For now, let me be the first to welcome 
you to our re-vamped (no Jyhad [whoops, I mean Vampire: The 
Eternal Struggle] pun intended) publication.  We appreciate your 
support of out home-brew 'zine.  And as always welcome your comments.

  hope to hear from you all very soon! *

                        The Grimore's Top Ten
                        ----------------------
        ** Remember, the ranking expressed below are based on the 
        views of the Grimore staff (usually based more on play use, 
        than hype, picture, or $$$ value...though the first and last 
        seem to go together), and players in our area, if things are 
        different where you play and would like to make a suggestion 
        on a new card to add or slot change for a card that has 
        already made the list feel free to e-mail us with your 
        suggestion! **

                            A Bit of History
                            ----------------

        In future issues this space will be devoted to any 
mail that we receive (under a different title of course), 
however, this issue since we don't have any mail (a problem one 
frequently runs into on a first issue), I thought it would be a 
good time to give you a brief background on those of us that run 
Grimore and the 'zines off-and-on distribution.  
        By now your probably wondering, "Who the hell is this 
guy to tell ME how to play Magic?", the awnser to that is 
simple, just a player.  I started into Magic about 2 weeks before 
The Dark came out (roughly a year and a half ago).  I had been 
originally exposed to the game when I had some money to blow 
(a problem I haven't had since I started playing seriously by 
the way) and a store clerk told me this card game (???) was 
the hottest selling thing in the nation, I thought "what the 
hell" and gave it a try, I was hooked.  Since, I have averaged 
playing between one and two hours a day, every-day, and believe 
I have come to be somewhat competent in tournament play (though 
much less so in melee play, emporer rules, or any of the other 
hundreds of variations on Magic).  Whether this makes me an 
authority I don't know, I do know that I like to write, and I 
like to hear feedback on my ideas and so I thought why not 
take my strategies (few of which are original, but then what IS 
original now-a-days?) to the most opinionated place I knew 
(probably the most opinionated place on the planet) the 
Internet, that's how Grimore got started for me.  The other 
staff members, none of which "surf the 'net" are my 
friends who play, local shop owners, and players I see as 
"outstanding" (meaning they win a lot more than I do, and do 
it in new and unexpected ways).  
        The Grimore 'zine was influenced by three major 
aspects of my life at the time of its creations.  Wizards of 
the Coast's Magic the Gathering (duh!), Comic collecting, and 
my experiences on Internet, local BBS's, and America On-Line.  
The game, of course, influenced me most and still amazes me at 
the rate it changes, and new deck strategies rise and fall 
(anyone remember Kobold decks?).  The comic aspect, especially 
the mainstream fanzine "Wizard, the guide to Comics!", here, I 
thought, was a perfect example of some guys that loved their 
hobby and influenced it through words.  I had also read other 
Magic 'zines (ie Scrye, and Conjure) and found them to be 
lacking in everything except price-guides.  I had also briefly 
run a Vampire the Masquerade fanzine on a local BBS system and 
so had some exposure to it there, so I thought why not try and 
write something pertaining to Magic that someone with half a 
brain could make use of?  And so Grimore (not Grimiore, though 
that is the correct spelling of the word, by hey, can't 
someone be different?) vol. 1 issue 1 was born.  Originally 
posted (the first of its kind I know about) on America On-Line 
(because I didn't have the backing to print a magazine type 
'zine, and it was the fastest way to get the publication out 
to the greatest amount of people for the cheapest price 
[free], by use of their 10 free hour deal, and because I don't have a 
local I-net supplier that I like), received what I thought was 
phenomenal response over 700 downloads!!!!! (at least its a start! :))  
Issue 2 and 3 quickly followed, then as issue 4 was in production my 
computer crashed, and stayed crashed for 6 months (static 
electricity the repair guy said!!!).  When I re-logged on 
downloads on Grimore had plateaued at about 800, and I had no 
feedback waiting for me (the letters I had saved were lost in 
the crash), I was more than a little disillusioned and put the 
'zine on the back burner for awhile.  About 2 months ago I 
got a little free time, and logged back on AOL, to my surprise 
about 10 new Magic Fanzines had sprung up.  I read them 
hopping that at least one editor would have something new or 
useful to say about the game...they didn't, at least nothing I 
hadn't heard before (or course, maybe you've heard everything 
I have to offer in this issue a million times before, in which 
case maybe non of us should be writing magazines like this).  
It was then I decided to raise the Grimore from the ashes.  
Though delayed this issue should be getting to you 
Thanksgiving day (perhaps a few days after if something goes 
wrong).  Grimore should run monthly from now until next 
November (1 year) at which time I'll decide to continue it or 
just let it die depending on response, time I can devote to 
it, and threat of nuclear war with Morocco.
        I hope that has somewhat cleared up where this 'zine 
came from (or at least confused you enough to read further).  
If not, re-read it again, in a mirror and see if it makes more 
sense.

        strategies, not one or two card combos.  In that spirit each 
        issue we are planning to take one deck strategy (ie Overrun, 
        or Stasis) and expand on it exploring its pros, cons, and 
        commenting on it.  Any comments you may have on the deck 
        strategy we missed (hey, we're not perfect) can be mailed to 
        use at Zzzayxx@aol.com  **


        This month lets look at the "Creatureless" deck.  
First you might be asking yourself, what IS a creatureless 
deck?  Well, it could just be a deck with no creatures (duh!), 
but more appropriately it is a deck that does not rely on 
creatures to do its damage but may have some "utility" 
creatures thrown in for defense, or their special ability 
(for example, Abu Jafar, Time Elemental, or Ali from Cairo).  
But for now lets concentrate on the former, 
no-creatures-at-all deck.
        This deck style has become more popular recently 
because of the advent of more cheap direct damage cards 
(ie Incinerate) and more anti-creature cards (ie Pyroclasm).  
Also this deck is nice because it is a lot more flexible than 
creature decks allowing for more utility cards, color hosers, 
and anti-lock cards (ie Season of the Witch).  A typical 
"Creatureless" deck will have red and blue as primary colors, 
along with black and white as utility colors.  Most of the 
damage comes from the red (lightening blots, chain 
lightenings, incinerates, fork), while the blue contributes 
its share of damage, (Psionic Blast) some nice spoilers 
(Timewalk, Ancestral Recall, Time Twister) and possibly 
counterspells.  The White is used for (what else?) 
Disenchants, Swords to Plowshares and Circles of Protection.  
The black comes in handy with its Demonic Tutor, and 
Underworld dreams.  Artifacts can also play a big part in 
creatureless decks, vises are common as are racks.  Moxes and 
Loti are almost a must since many "creatureless" decks 
encompass three or more colors.  Also, Urza's Baubles allow 
the player to get to his damage fast, as can Brainstorms, and 
Portents.  The sideboard is important in an creatureless deck, 
because it is where the player must plan for any off-the-wall 
deck he/she comes up against.
        The main stay of a creatureless deck is to do as much 
damage as possible, in as little time, with as little mana.  
Therefore, lightening bolts, chain lightenings etc...  are 
preferred to Fireballs and Disintegrates, the fact that many 
creatureless decks are mana short also makes more than two X 
damage spells overkill.  Now that the player has his damage he 
will need a good defense, luckily in the last few expansions 
Wizards has given the creatureless deck player plenty of 
this.  Holy days work very well, as do Island Sancturarys 
(along with a Mystic Decree), meekstones, pyroclasms, wraths 
of god, energy storms, deflections, reverse damages, and 
probably a lot more I can't think of now.  All this makes 
creatureless decks a real pain to beat, and fun to play (its 
fun to win isn't it?).  But they, like everything, have their 
drawbacks.
        Just getting the cards to build a deck like this will 
cost you a lot.  The only way to ensure you don't get mana 
screwed is to pack your deck with multilands (old or new), 
then good luck getting the Psionic Blasts, Forcefields, Moxes, 
Lotus etc...  Needless to say this is a deck for people with a 
lot of cards, a lot to trade, or a lot of money!  Also, 
overrun, if its quick enough, can pound a creatureless player 
into the ground before he gets off too many spell.  Remember 
to that in this deck with no X damage spells (except maybe a 
few earthquakes in the sideboards) you only have a set amount of 
damage to dole out, if you spend your time zapping creatures you 
won't have enough to kill your opponent (of course Feldon's, recall, 
and time twister take care of this).  Land destruction decks are 
perhaps the most hampering because your mana is so varied the experienced
player will hit one color with all he spells (if he's smart, red) until 
you run out of that type of mana and can't do much to him.  So 
if you play creatureless play cautiously!!!

        That concludes this segment of Strategemos, next issue 
we'll look at the advantage of putting a few creatures in that 
"creatureless" deck of yours :), until then comments are 
welcome as always!  (Also, a creatureless deck will be 
showcased in the Drawing Board next month, do you have a 
kick-ass creatureless?  Submit it!)

Alpha/Beta/Unlimited
-------------------

-----------
Over Rated:
-----------

Ancestral Recall - 

O.k, I know its only one blue, GREAT with 
Vises.  But for 3 extra cards the $75.00 price tag is a tad to 
much!  Unless your playing a Zap deck (and there aren't to 
many Zapish things in blue) this card seems useless until 
mid-game when you have enough mana to the cards you get from 
the spell!

2-Headed Giant of Foriys - 

Unless your opponent is played a weenie deck where you could 
kill 2 creatures blocking for 2 damage each.  Other than that 
it's just an expensive 4/4 trampler that can be Psionic Blasted 
out of existence.  And the $30.00 price tag doesn't help much 
either.

Blaze of Glory -

O.k. this is awesome with an Abu Jafar, or Basilisk...but a 
lure works just as well doesn't it?  Unless its a color 
problem, in which case if your willing to pay $30-$40 for a 
white lure, and not $5-$8 for some Savannahs be my guest.

-----------
Under-Rated
-----------

Natural Selection - 

O.k. Everyone says this card sucks.  Visions can let you look 
at 5 cards, Orcish Spies 3 and they are both low dollar 
cards.  But Natural selection allows you to RE-ARRANGE these 
cards, which is awesome especially when you need mana, when 
you don't want them to have any mana or a specific card (these 
are a must in all my land destruction decks), or when your 
just about to cast Darkpact and want to exchange the Mox you 
anted with that Counterspell.  And as one of the lower priced 
OOPs they are still easy to get.  When more people realize how 
useful these cards can be, you can count on their prices shooting up!

Cyclopean Tomb - 

With all the craze over land destruction I'm surprised this 
card isn't more expensive ($35 or so right now!).  Since its 
only 2 colorless to change any land to a swamp (good w/ 
Karma!!!) and it can be hacked to any other land if say, they 
do play black (proving again Blue is the best color around! 
:)).  

Raging River - 

Yes the $35.00 price tag is a little much, but if you live in 
an area plagued by overrun, and white-green weenie decks this 
card works great.  Low casting cost, great effects...attack 
where your opponent is most vulnerable!  Works especially well 
with Goblin War Drums, Tramplers, and Eternal Warriors (or 
Windseeker Centaurs).

Guardian Beast -

I can understand protecting one's Moxes, but devoting a 
creature (a $60.00 creature non the less!) to protecting them 
is a bit much, if this guy protected artifact creatures it 
would be different but as it is he's just a show piece and 
little else!  I've never seen one used in tournament play, nor in 
a game now that I think of it (effectively at least).  But his 
price keeps going up and up (but hey, it IS a cool picture!).

Ali from Cairo - 

O.k. he probably DOES have the best ability in the game for a 
creature.  Its great not to go below one life (and with Jade 
Monolith out he's almost immortal).  But if your 
opponent in a match hasn't planned on facing at least 1 Ali 
today he probably doesn't deserve to win.  Fact is a simple 
sword to Plowshares, boomerang, or unsummon, and Ali fails 
you, and since all can be used as instants its no good hiding 
behind him (Unless he's spectral cloaked in which case 
Tranquilitys or Disenchants come in handy!).  And if you've built your 
entire deck on protecting Ali, well you must not be playing a 
competitive tournament.  Or have some way to ensure that you draw 
him!

Old Man Of The Sea - His 2 blue one colorless is actually 
pretty good for a 2/3 creature, especially in blue which lacks 
smaller creatures for lowish casting costs.  But lets face it, 
his special ability really bites.  Sure you can take control 
of Llanlower Elves, Scryb Sprites, and Thallids all day.  But 
that Shivan, or Scaled Wurm is a little out of reach for this 
geriatric wonder.  Of course loading him up with Unstable 
Mutations could allow you to take control of almost anything 
but then he's just a ticking timebomb waiting to, not only 
loose the creature but die himself.  Unholy/Holy strengths 
help also, but if you build a deck around your 4 Old Men your 
going to be hurting when you come up against a creatureless 
deck.  His high (actually its gone down recently, locally 
anyway) price of about $30-35, makes him a nice card for 
collectors.  But almost tournament useless...Use a $10 
Preacher or $2.00 Seasinger instead.

Ernahm Djinn - 

With all the hype over the ever popular Juzam Djinn.  His 
vegetarian cousin the Ernahm seems to have been left (sadly) 
in the dust.  Though this 4/5 for one green and 3 colorless is 
on of the best Power/Toughness to Mana ratios in the game, and 
he tends to come out earlier in a Multi-colored deck (without 
moxes, lotus, etc...) because of the 3 colorless and only 1 
colored mana requirement.  Even his "drawback" isn't really 
anything to be worried about, with Juzam at least your 
guaranteed to take 1 point per round (I know, I know, unless 
its Spirit Linked).  But with the release of Legends and The 
Dark, the Ernahm's "drawback" is almost non-existent.  There's 
Deadfall a Legends uncommon you can pick up for about $5.00 to 
stop Forest Walk all together.  Maze of Ith does a great job 
also.  As does Scarwood Hag which removes Forest Walk from a 
target creature.  Or even better simply give your opponents 
Royal Assassin, Birds of Paradise, or Time Elemental Forest 
Walk every round, its doubtful he'll be attacking with any of 
them anyway!  

Pyramids - 

With the evergrowing popularity of land destruction (and land 
stealing now that IA is out) and the slight boost it got in 
Ice Age the 6 colorless casting cost on this artifact suddenly 
doesn't seem to high!  The fact that they are a poly-artifact, 
and save land for 2 colorless a piece, make them a nice card 
to keep in your sideboard, just in case.  Still realitivly 
cheap (compared to all the OTHER Arabains) at $10-15, pyramids 
couldn't be hard to find for any player, veteran or 
beginner.  Now all you have to do is find the 6 mana to get 
them out before your opponent blows it up!

Abu Jafar - 

In tournaments plagued by twice Unholy Strengthed, Thrull 
Retainered, Juzam Djinns (now a 10/8, regenerator!).  This 
little one casting cost white 0/1, which prevents all those 
nasty things like regeneration and acts as a basilisk to 
anything is a live-saver.  Though certainly not a "must" in 
every deck.  He's certainly a sideboard card (a White utility 
just like Disenchant, and Swords to Plowshares), that in at 
the right time can save you from being eaten alive!  Relitivly 
easy to find, and not TO expensive ($8-$10).  But most of all 
quite easy to trade for since most people look at him as a 
waste of cardstock.  Another white weenie (0/1 no less!) where 
a Juzam could have been in that $50.00 pack they bought.

Colossus of Sardia - 

O.k.. should you ever manage to actually get one of these big 
boys out in a tournament game, you should be commended.  Of 
course it can be done (first turn even!; Mox Jet, Swamp, 
Lotus + 2 Dark Rituals and crack the Lotus = Colossus) but 
seldom is.  Lets face it 9 for a 9/9 wall (unless you want to 
play the 9 a round to untap him) is quite a bit.  Of course 
there are other ways to untap him, Twiddle, Jandor's 
Saddlbags.  And perhaps the best Elder Druid!  But over all, 
as a tournament card Colossus sucks!!  Wouldn't you rather use the 
above mentioned 9 Mana to do something more spectacular like: 
Mox Jet, Swamp, Black Lotus + 2 Dark Rituals = Juzam Djinn + 
Ancestral Recall + 2 Unholy Strengths + Thrull Retainer!  Now 
you have a 10/8 Djinn that untaps EVERY round, but hey there's 
still that one point of damage...

Obelisk Of Undoing - 

The Obelisk is cheap to get out, but a bugger to use!  The 6 
colorless activation cost makes it tough to use per-round, the 
fact that it only returns your cards to your hand makes it 
useless against attacking heavily enchanted creatures.  
Wizards of the Coast made this card almost worthless by 
printed Time Elemental in Legends, then re-printing it in 4th 
Edition.  Its low price ($8-$10) is huge compared to a Time 
Elemental you can pick up for $4 or pull for $2.50.  Possibly 
one of the most useless cards in the game, and totally 
worthless in tournament play.

Under-Rated

Powerleech - 

With the re-printing of 4th Edition and the massive insurgence 
of all artifact, or artifact dependent decks.  This Antiquities 
common should be a staple of every green players side board.  
Not only is it cheap to cast (GG), and requires no upkeep.  
And give you LIFE all contribute to make this one of the most 
useful, yet least used cards in the game.

Ashnod's Transmograte - 

This card is great in an overrun deck.  Not only is it +1/+1 
for only 1 mana.  It also makes your creature and artifact 
creature, and immunizes them from terrors (of course they can 
now be disenchanted, shattered, shatter stormed, and 
detonated).  Still early in the game one point of damage can 
make all the difference.  The fact that these cannot be 
tranqilitied away makes them nice also.  And that they can be 
held back for the 1 creature that made it through and used as 
fast effects make them great.  Even if you only sideboard 
them, just in case, Ashnod's Transmograte is a little used, 
potent card.


Legends

Over-Rated

Sword of the Ages - 

Yeah, this artifact is awesome when you attack with your Craw 
Giant, Giant Growth him twice and Berserk him.  Then use Sword 
of Ages to sacrifice him and shoot him at your opponent (48 
point of damage right there!).  Also great for Thallid or 
Thrull or Goblin decks, where you can shoot off hoards of 
your 1/1's to kill you opponent.  But, its the build up time 
needed get the sword out, much less get anything substansel to 
shoot from it that makes it almost useless in tournament play.  In 
a common Thallid deck the sword itself would probably come out 
on the 3rd or 4th round (w/ Wild Growths, Llanowars, and 
BoPs).  The Thallids themselves would take almost 5 rounds to 
duplicate themselves 10 times (this is assuming you have all 4 
of them out, and no Fungal Blooms).  So by we'll say round 6 
your ready to use the Sword.  Assuming it hasn't been 
disenchanted by now.  No 1 point earthquake has been cast, or 
you opponent hasn't been pummeling you with his Shivan dragon 
for 2 rounds now!  The fact that the Sword lists at $25.00 
makes it a hard acquisition for many players, and the raw time 
required to use it effectively make it just extra baggage in a 
good tournament deck.

Elder Dragons - 

The fact that these boys have neat boarders, fly, are all 7/7's,
and awesome special abilities.  Doesn't make them great, or 
even half-decent.  Sure for multi-player games maybe they are 
nice.  In a Eureka Deck they are o.k. if you can pay the 
upkeep.  But in a run-of-the-mill 3 color deck, the chances of 
getting any of these guys out, without him being immediately 
Swords to Plowshared, Countered, or Terrored is scarce.  The 
fact that only a few of these guys have trample, make them 
easy to block, and they usually just get used as expensive 
blockers.  

Gold Bordered Legends - 

I may be prejudiced, but I HATE gold-bordered Legends, oh 
sure there are a few exceptions (Rubina Soulsinger, Adun 
Oaksheild, Angus Mackenzie, Gwendlyn Di Corci, Johan, Ragnar, 
Tetsuo Umezawa, and Xira Arien) but most of these are the 3 
casting cost ones, still require diverse mana to activate 
them, and are only useful in certain types of decks.  On the 
whole GBLs (Gold Bordered Legends) are while pretty, 
incredibly over rated especially in tournament play.  How often 
have you seen Dakkon Blackblade come out in time to use him 
and stay out for long effectively!?  Mostly they are just prime
Maze of Ith targets, or expensive blockers (see Elder Dragons) 
and nothing more.

Forethought Amulet - 

Semi-Expensive to get out, and the 3 colorless upkeep can 
sometimes REALLY bite.  But as a sideboard card against those 
people that insist on playing with 4 fireballs, 4 
disintegrates, 4 infernos, 4 meteor showers, and 4 lava 
bursts.  This artifact works wonders!!!  Not as effective 
against chain lightenings, or lightning bolts but then against 
just put out you conservator and prevent that damage also!  
Probably one of the least used, most useful cards in the game.  

Al-abara's Carpet - 

Just like the Forethought Amulet above, Al's Carpet is an awesome 
(but unused) card especially against all the over-run decks that 
abound today. Play it with a gravity sphere and creatures become 
less than a problem for you.  The 5 colorless activation/casting 
cost can be a nuisance but for what it protects you against Al's 
Carpet is more than worth it!  Deffinatly worth its space in 
any deck, or at least sideboard.

Telekinisis - 

The closest thing to a fog WotC has given blue.  Telekinisis 
is more like a Feint, but more effective.  Why wouldn't you 
like to not only prevent that Ernahm from dealing damage this 
round, but also have him "paralyzed" for 2 rounds?!  This card 
is very useful against almost any creature deck.  Its lowish 
casting cost, and low (for a Legends rare) price of about 
$8.00 makes them easy to find.  Telekinisis is a great 
sideboard card, while it might not be wise to give it a place 
in every deck.  It deffinatly deserves a place in sideboards, 
and its a lot more useful than that Nicol Bolas that's just 
taking up space!


The Dark

Frankenstein's Monster -

The low (BB) casting cost is nice to have, but the fact that 
Franky relies on your DEAD creatures (creatures that SHOULD 
have been doing damage to you opponent!), fact is Franky is 
just no good in any deck (especially a tournament one!).  Sure he 
can be used with a Lord of the Pit deck and re-used those puny 
1/1's.  But getting enough creatures in the graveyard to make 
Frank worth it is difficult to do....besides that late in the 
game he'll probably just be countered or StoP'd (Swords to 
Plowshared), perhaps the most useless used card in Dark!

Leviathan - 

If you CAN'T figure out why this card is over-rated you should 
be drug out into the street and shot!  The HUGE casting cost 
aside, the upkeep is a bitch to pay.  Not to mention a maze of 
ith makes this guy useless.  If your really sadistic enough to 
to want to sacrifice something as important as land for a big 
creature.  Use a polar kraken instead, at least there its only 
life!

Stone Calander - 

O.k. I admit this card is really nice if you need to get that 
Force of Nature out, but lets face it just the 5 casting cost 
on this guy is to high!  Something like Planar Gate, costs 6 
but takes the cost down 2 instead of one.  In a multi-player 
game, or "friendly" match this card might work wonders.  But 
in a tournament game its simply a waste of time.

-----------
Under-Rated
-----------

Dark Sphere - 

I'm incredibly surprised more people don't play with these 
wonders!  Not only is the casting cost just right (0), its 
ability is one of the better ones in the game.  How many times 
haven't you wanted to half that 10 point fireball?  Or with 
multiple spheres reduce it to 0?!?!  The low price of these 
artifacts, and their usefulness should give them a place in 
almost every deck, or at least sideboard!  Especially good for 
direct damage, and big creatures, this artifact doesn't cut it 
against weenie decks (unless the difference between one damage 
and zero is the difference between life and death).  But then 
that's why you can sub them out for earthquakes, right?

Reflecting Mirror - 

Possibly the MOST under-rated card in the game, the only thing 
that makes the mirror even close to clumsy is its casting 
cost (4), but its still a easy 2nd round card.  More useful 
now than even now that Wizards has seen fit to give red a 
potential of 12 (!!!!!!) lightning boltish things in a single 
legal deck!  Not to mention the chance of reflecting something 
big like a 15 point fireball with the use of Basalts, Mana 
Vaults, and a High Tide or Two!  Even Counterspells can be 
reflected, mind twists, hymns to tourach and many more!  While 
not good against a creature deck the Reflecting Mirror should 
find a comfortable place in many decks.

Season of the Witch - 

I can't be the only one tired of all those Stasis Decks, how 
many times have you wished WotC had just not printed (much 
less re-printed) Time Elemental?  Well this card takes care of 
that problem quite easily.  Great in a sideboard, your 
opponent can watch his Zypher Falcons, Serra Angels, and 
Windseeker Centaurs destroyed.  Not to mention those untapped 
Time Elementals (almost as good as nettling them!!!).  The 2 
life upkeep, however, makes timing crucial (wait till he has 
all 4 Serras out! :) ), but should you ever get this card out, 
it'll mean an end for his whole deck's concept (especially if 
you can get it back every round with Skull of Orm, and avoid 
paying the 2 life!).

* Notes: This sideboard is geared toward current deck-building 
         trends here in Utah, ie the Fireball Deck (BeB's, and 
         Deflections), and Overrun (Pyroclasms).  I don't have any of 
         the color hosers in here because A) no room, and B) when you 
         play 4 of the 5 colors you'll probably hurt yourself more than 
         your opponent.   
Total Sideboard Cards; 15
Total $$$ Cost; $513.75
* Note: Of course I didn't PAY that much for it, nor would I 
        sell for that price, but adding all the local values together 
        that's the total.  Of course depending on area your total my 
        differ drastically (Sideboard cost was no added!).  This whole 
        price slot was added for a new player that doesn't know how 
        much you actually have to invest in a competitive deck.  Mine 
        was done with only 1 Mox, and no lotus.  Most of the winning 
        decks locally would run anyone well over $800.00 if they 
        bought every card individually at a medium price!  Of course 
        many of these are easier to get in trade, so don't think this 
        deck is impossible to build because of the price you'll find 
        things in here are easier to get than you thought! (I spent 
        $82.00 on it and traded for the rest)

* Note: This area is for us, the Grimore staff to fill out after 
        we read your deck idea, it lets us rate it in originality, 
        playability, simplicity, and chances of it actually winning 
        something!  Ratings go from;  

        *     - You based this deck on a combo you saw in Conjure 
                didn't you?
        **    - A 3 year old, who has been playing for 2 weeks 
                could come up with this much depth in a deck!
        ***   - You actually had to use a brain cell for this one!
        ****  - Hmmmmm, this just might work.
        ***** - We bow to you oh great Magic god!!!!

        We will always play your deck before rating it (unless its a 
        Stasis deck, then we throw it away), its to hard to grade stuff 
        on paper 'cides you might play it better than us!                      

Originality; **                           
* Note: Lets face it. Bloodlusting a Juggernaut, then Lightning 
        Bolting your opponent 8 times isn't exactly cutting edge!  
Playbility; ***
* Note: Timing is quite important in this deck, making it 
        difficult for someone new to the game it use correctly.  But 
        its still easy for a veteran to pick up this deck and use it 
        well.
Basic Coolness; ****
* Note: Some of the combos you can get off with this thing kick 
        butt!!  Wheel of Fortune, then fire off your Jester's Mask (he 
        got LAND!) is fun, not to mention the basic annoyance factor 
        of the Jester Stuff, and 12 Lightning Boltish things!  
Overall; ***
* Note: This deck is really just a beefed up starter deck with 
        some direct damage, but most creature stuff.  The Goblin War 
        Drums make it so more things get through, and the Time Walk, 
        Orb, Cap, and Mask slow down/annoy your opponent enough to get 
        them frustrated and make some REALLY dumb mistakes!

-=Staff Comments =-

Pro;    Nice when it gets going, the lightening bolts keep most 
        creatures down till you can get out your bigges, the Goblin 
        War Drums and Wind Spirits make the creatures more difficult to 
        block.  Also the deck is quite flexible, with cards put in for 
        a variety of deck types from Anti-Creature, to Overrun.  

Con;    If the deck doesn't get rolling right off the bat a 
        quicker deck (overrun), or land destruction deck might 
        overtake it.  Pyroclasm's help this but the Deck and sideboard 
        lack land destruction preventers.  Also, seems the deck has a 
        lot of Red cards, and only about 5 sources of red mana, 
        because of this about 1 in 10 games the player gets mana 
        screwed and just has to die gracefully.  

Suggestions;    Expand the sideboard to include a more varied 
                strategy, think about adding some non-red direct damage 
                (psionic blasts for example).  Also, try subbing the 
                Jothull Wurms out for Ernahm Djinns, they come out 
                quicker, even if they aren't quite so big.  As always a 
                lotus and more moxes would help the deck, but might be 
                hard to get.  Try at least to pick-up a Berserk, 
                and/or Forcefield (if for nothing else then for the 
                Eureka decks that are becoming more and more vicious).

        is relitivily easy (and cheap) to make.   

-= Ratings =-

Originality; **
* Note: The only thing that keeps this deck from getting a * 
        rating here is the use of white as a support color, and the 
        fact that most * decks exceed 75 cards.  The premise is to kill 
        you opponent ASAP, how original is that?

Playbility; ****
* Note: Very easy for beginners to play and do well with (if 
        they remember to attack every turn), also nice for experienced 
        players to experiment with since it doesn't revolve around a 
        5 card super combo (or any combos really), a breath of fresh 
        air for people tired of flipping coins, messing with counters, 
        and taking their entire turn in their upkeep.

Basic Coolness; ****
* Note: Scores well here because of the speed if nothing else, 
        its rare to find a deck tuned this well that acts and reacts 
        this fast, the balanced sideboard is also an asset.  And who 
        doesn't like to beat on their opponent with demon spawned 
        creatures?

Overall; ***
* Note: Quick, lethal and hard to stop, this deck makes 
        mincemeat of a lot of decks.  Its most important aspect is, of 
        course, speed, but the flying creatures, first strike (!!!), 
        and slotted (ie not just in sideboard) utility cards make it 
        semi-flexible and harder to stop.
 
-=Staff Comments =-

Pro;    As mentioned about twenty times above speed is this decks 
        big advantage, pit it against a deck with the same speed and 
        its more a matter of the best draw than good playing skill.  
        The Orders of the Ebon Hand are great because they are cheap, 
        and pumpable (foiling Power Surge decks), the creature 
        enhancers are nice especially the under-rated but indisposible 
        Thrull Retainers.  This sideboard is very well 
        balanced, but what about Hellfires?  They would be great to 
        get rid of big creatures (see below).

Con;    Like I said, this deck against a similar black 
        warp-speed deck and its more a matter of luck to see who 
        wins.  Also the mana ratio in this deck can be choking if not 
        mixed well, though only 3 mana is required to run the deck 
        effectively its drawing only 1 mana in the game that gets 
        frustrating.  Also, big creatures can be problems early on, ie 
        you opponent manages to get out a first round Shivan, until a 
        creature comes out with enough enhancers to kill it.

Suggestions;    If you come into a lot of money soon, try subbing out 
                your Erg Raiders for Juzam Djinns or Kabal Ghouls, the 
                former would be great to end games soon the later nice 
                for prolonged games (especially against Saproling decks!).  
                Think about acquiring the Pearl Mox, and maybe toss in a 
                few mana to see how it works.

                Your Complete Guide to Tournament Play!
                          Part I "Building"
                ---------------------------------------
        
        O.k. by this time everyone and their dog has written 
an article about building a good deck.  from former Champion Zak 
Dolan, to (I am not kidding) a kid that has played a total of 
eight games.  So a lot of the stuff in this article will 
probably be a repeat of what you have heard, but then 
again...maybe not.

        First myth to dispel, you don't need a specific theme 
to a good deck.  Only one theme need apply; WIN!  However you 
can, if that means playing the most annoying deck ever know to 
man (stasis deck incase your wondering) as long as you come 
out on top.  You don't need a multi-card combo, you don't need 
moxes or Loti, you do need a good strategy, some workable 
cards and at least some knowledge of the rules.  The later 
applies the most, nothing is more annoying than playing against 
a kid and having him take 10 minutes just to cast a Llanowar 
elf!  If your not clear on all the rules pick up a Pocket 
Player's Guide, and read the Spoilers list so you know what 
the cards do.  Once you've got a basic understanding of the 
game, play a few one-on-one duels with someone, learn some of 
the more intricate timing rules etc...  Ask you opponent to 
switch decks for a match, nothing helps you learn how to build 
a good deck then actually playing one, if he/she refuses 
either they've had cards stolen in this way (stuff like that 
is ruining the game!) or is to conceited to know that he/she no 
matter how long they have been playing, not matter how many 
Moxes they have stock piled, can learn something from playing 
someone else's deck (or if not, at least it'll bring back some 
nostalgia for when he/she was a beginner).  So now we'll 
assume you've played for about a month, and lo and behold a 
tournament is gearing up for next weekend.  You decide to 
enter, even though the chances of a beginner taking a field 
of experienced players are slim, you'll learn more from 
watching tournament players than anywhere else, look at the styles 
you like, copy cat one if you want to no one has patents on 
deck ideas, 'cides then you can play around with it, maybe add 
a few twists and spring it as a surprise next time around.  
        So we'll say the tournament is Type II (which makes 
knowing what the cards do essential) and you've decided to 
play 3 colors (two of which don't really matter, but one of 
which should be white if only for Disenchants).  Now comes 
picking the cards (remember our strategy; win) you can do this 
a variety of ways, pretty pictures, same artist, dice rolls 
but probably the best way is just going through your cards and 
picking out those cards that appeal to you and you think would 
work with your strategy (which differs from a theme in that 
your strategy just deals with HOW you kill your opponent) 
whether that be black warp-speed, blue counter, or red zap.  
You should have picked out around 80-90 spell cards, lay these 
out on a table stacking like with like, remember no more than 
4 of each card and all the other rules (they are in your 
rule book).  Toss out cards that are to specific (ie Typhoon, 
Acid Rain etc...), save them for sideboard or kindling.  Don't 
overlook commons and uncommons!!!  I've seen guys with all 
rare decks loose to some 8-year old playing a goblin deck 
(with no Goblin Kings).  Now you should have narrowed you 
field of choice down to about 50 cards.  You should have 40 
spell cards minimum, so narrow until you get there, if your 
having a hard time, remember 3 of something is almost as good 
as 4 (sometimes better), and that after play testing you can 
add/remove cards.  This basic deck should be just skin and 
bones, the bare essentials.  Now slap in some mana, 20 to 
start out with, though you should find that as you tune your 
deck the card:mana ratio will go down (my most competitive 
deck only has 15 mana producers in it).  Shuffle up your deck 
and try it out, against someone else, or by dealing yourself 3 
turns worth of hands.  Too much mana?  To little?  Not the 
right color?  Re-mix and try it again, if you encounter the 
same trouble consider taking out some mana (don't be afraid to 
take out mana sometimes you don't always need all 20 though most 
people out there will tell you that you do), adding some, or searching 
out those last two desired multi-lands.  
        60 CARDS!!!! MAXIMUM!!! 60 CARDS!!!! MINIMUM!!!!!  
Do not go over 60 cards unless your deck HAS to (ie its loaded 
with Howling Mines and your goal it to run you opponent out 
of cards), and even then do it only if completely necessary.  
In choosing these cards you need to look into getting the 
most bang for your mana.  Creatures with ability are the 
best, though usually a little tougher to get, creature 
enhancers that mirror another creatures ability (ie a Grey 
Ogre with Flight vs. a Granite Gargoyle) should be tossed out 
unless its impossible for you to get the card on short 
notice.  Now comes the two most important parts of tuning the 
deck; play testing, and sideboard construction.  Ideally you 
will have this test deck built about a week before the 
competition, now just spend some time at the store the tournament 
will be held at (or a place where some of the other entries 
play) test your deck.  If asked tell them this is just your 
"fun" deck and your super-mondo-destroyer deck is under wraps 
till the tournament if it works they won't sideboard against you.  
Gauge the types of decks being played by each player, a lot of 
players stick to one or two colors or (worse) have themes they 
like to play.  They will be the easy ones to beat since you 
know exactly what they will be playing.  Tune your deck as 
needed, swap out cards and try other in their place, get some 
ideas for your sideboard.  We will assume the tournament is 
scheduled for a Saturday, tune up until Thursday night then 
construct your sideboard (do NOT construct it in an all-night 
tuning session with friends, nothing is more embarrassing than 
falling asleep as you move in for the kill).  Go to sleep 
early, say your prayers, etc...  The next morning pick up any 
cards you have arranged to buy/borrow, and head to the 
competition.

author will weigh the pros (winning) and cons (getting

The Duelist
-----------

Pro;    The best paper mag. on the market for Magic (its put out 
        by the people who make the game what do you expect?), not much 
        on combos, or price-guides (thank god!) but still the up and 
        coming columns are nice.  Mr. Suitcase is good for beginners 
        while some of the more advanced rule discussions are 
        invaluable (plus this is where the rules get 
        updated!).  Magic the Puzzling is fun, if a little easy at 
        times.  All and all probably the best mag. out there for the 
        serious player.

Con;    One thing I've always wondered when reading Duelist is 
        why they bill themselves as the "Official Deckmaster 
        Magazine" and then go ahead and review other CCGs!  I mean the 
        only people reading their mags are Magic junkies anyway what 
        are they trying to do lose business?  Also some of the combos 
        they have are things that I heard of a year ago (ball 
        lightening, time elemental anyone?).  They need a little 
        update, or at least a few new ones each time around, I mean 
        they make the rules if they're hard up for a combo just change 
        them!!!!! (Well...maybe that isn't the BEST idea....)

Overall Rating: ****

MageZine
--------

Pro;    Probably one of the best data mags out there, the 
        editor seems to know what he's doing (or at least fakes it 
        well).  Plus it has been around awhile this is nice because 
        the 'zine gets more contributing writers, and has even started 
        offering subscriptions (just hope they don't start charging for 
        it!).  The fact that StupidJock takes time to put his creation 
        out bi-weekly demonstrates his dedication (or lack of life :) ), 
        and it's nice to know at least one of the number of home-brew's out 
        there will be around for awhile.  Repeat contributing authors 
        like SpectreMge and Arawyn give the mag a sense of consistency 
        (and they aren't bad writers).  For the most part MageZine is 
        worth the download time.
 
Con;    The editor (StupidJock) has some good ideas, take for 
        example his wanting to start up "MageZine Duels" good idea, 
        but it got almost no response.  Why?  Well first he limited 
        application by only inviting AOL'ers, second he's competing 
        with OGF Diamond's annual tournaments which are run much more 
        effectively and better than his would be (if for no other 
        reason than Di's been doing them longer and has worked out 
        some of the kinks).  The deck-building articles are a step 
        above some paper 'zines (ie Conjure) but still leave something 
        to be desired.  The plethora of contributed decks are nice, 
        but lack explanation and play stats, something that sounds 
        good on paper may not work well in a duel.  The 'zine lists 
        some combos but most of these are old (spotlighted card Time 
        Elemental??? That came about a year late!) and ways have been 
        found to defeat them that even the most novice player can 
        think of.  Some of the contributed articles are plain crap 
        (won't mention any names) but most are worth at least a 
        glance.  One of the better 'zines, but it could be a lot better.

Subscribers:

        We are planning to start a mailing list as soon as we 
have 50 names to put on it, recipients will get the 'zine over 
e-mail the day it's released, they will also get updates about 
Grimore sponsored tournaments, contests, and will be entered in 
our year-end drawing for a Mox (winner's choice of color).  If 
your interested in subscribing simply drop us a line at 
Zzzayxx@aol.com with SUBSCRIPTION in the title line, you'll be 
notified ASAP of your addition to the list!

Submissions:

        We here are Grimore would be very happy to get all the 
submissions we could.  However there have to be a few 
guidelines (as always).  Therefore we suggest you submit you 
idea for an article, or perhaps a short excerpt from it, we'll 
let you know if were interested and ask you to send us the 
whole thing or complete it.  We are always looking for 
consistent contributing authors, and as long as you've put 
some thought into your article, and it doesn't have to much 
profanity ( :) ) it'll probably see print.  Please no articles 
about card selling, or magic variations.  However articles on 
card trading, magic related fiction, tournament play, current 
card/deck building trends etc.. are accepted whole heartedly.  
Just send your proposal with SUBMISSION in the title line and 
we'll get back to you within 48 hours.
