yeah... so what if they don't talk to me and i try to confess my feelings 
to them but i don't know how to ... so what if i write horrible poetry 
and have more slits on my wrists than dick clark has had face-lifts...

standing
waiting
glancing
hoping
watching
smelling
forgetting
losing
ending

yeah... i'm pretty much a quiet kid... and yeah, i feel the need to make 
a statment in violence... maybe i should snap... maybe i should break out 
dad's .22 and sit on the roof of the school... yeah... take out a few of 
the fake sheep sitting around the school yard... the ones who make fun of 
me all of the time...

running
breathing
sweating
kneeling
hiding

maybe i should just take some prozac, something to quiet the riot in my 
skull... the constant battle between sanity and madness...

killing
raping
eating
fucking
living
hating

or maybe i should just get a clue...
