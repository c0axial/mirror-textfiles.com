1994-04-02      Purpose of the mini-Journal (*)

The mini-Journal of Irreproducible Results publishes news about overly
stimulating research and ideas. Specifically:

A) Haphazardly selected superficial (but advanced!) extracts of research
news and satire from the Journal of Irreproducible Results (JIR).

B) News about the annual Ig Nobel Prize ceremony. Ig Nobel Prizes honor
"achievements that cannot or should not be reproduced." A public
ceremony is held at MIT, in Cambridge Massachusetts, every autumn. The
ceremony is sponsored jointly by JIR and by the MIT Museum.

C) News about other science humor activities conducted by the MIT Museum
and JIR.

1994-04-03      Historic Abstracts from JIR, vol. 13, no. 4, Aug. 1964

        [JIR itself is published bi-monthly.
        In months between issues, this section of mini-JIR will contain
        historic abstracts from the JIR archives.]

"Why the IgNoble Prize was not Awarded in 1964," by J. Lorch
The IgNoble Prize Committee for 1964 was composed of Professors Black,
White, and Price. At their first meeting, only one candidate was
presented. At the second meeting, the distinguished professors nominated
themselves for the Prize. At the third meeting, there appeared a new
candidate "whose observations covered many fields, but his conclusions
were never properly published, and some were patently irreproducible."
As a result, no candidate was found suitable for recommendation.

[Unsigned Public Notice]
A reward is offered for information leading to the arrest of EDDY
CURRENT, charged with induction of an 18-year-old coil, named MILLI
HENRY, who was found half choked. CURRENT escaped Weston Primary Cell
and was missing since Faraday.

"On the Treatment of Annoying But Incontrovertible and Inexplicable
Facts," by A Furst
This paper proposes the so-called FURST MODIFICATION, which postulates
that if one is not sure what to do about data, one should ignore it, or
give it a name.

"The Aging Investigator," by A. Foraker
This is a detailed discussion of the effects of mental menopause, which
eventually leads to placing the investigator's name on papers of his
professional assistants, or to reading their papers at scientific
meetings.

"A Rapid Method for Inefficient Inactivation of Mosquitoes," by L'echec
Molestus
The techniques presented here is to use a soft-bristle broom to squeeze
mosquitoes congregating on the ceiling. Alternatively, one can use a
pillow which is thrown upwards. A side effect of the use of the pillow
method, in addition to the reduction of the equatorial dimensions of the
author's body, is the appearance of some interesting red patterns on the
ceiling."

"Peculiar Relationships Between Authors and the Subject of Their
Studies," by A. Kohn
It appears that often a scientists choice of what to study is associated
with his name. Classical examples of such a correlation are provided by
Lord Brain, who reviewed brain mechanisms, and Fox, who was
psychoanalyzed dogs with Oedipus complexes. Goodheart was interested in
toplessness in females, and Glascock produced a book on isotopic gas
analysis for biochemists. For those versed in German, it might be
interesting that Professor Fleisch wrote a book on proper nutrition.

"Improvement and Deletion of Memory," by (?)
The author claims that he has administered sublethal doses of strychnine
to human volunteers (school children) and found that a significant
improvement of memory was observed among the survivors.

1994-04-04      Our Stand on Abortion

Where We Stand
With recent advancements in medicine and biology it is now possible to
push back the time of a safe abortion. Because of this, and its impact
on society, it is important that scientists take a stand on exactly how
late an abortion should allowed. We propose 18 years.

                We also commissioned a public opinion survey,
                the results of which are presented here:

                                * * *

                The Abortion Controversy
                A Public Opinion Survey
                by Aaron K. Lish, Ph.D.
                The Institute for Public Acknowledgment

Background
We undertook a definitive survey of American public opinion about the
abortion controversy. Previous attempts to measure the public's views
about abortion have all been flawed or otherwise inadequate. In the
United States, abortion has become an increasingly divisive issue. An
accurate assessment of public opinion could have profound effects on the
country's political and moral climate.

The Survey Question
We surveyed 41,000 adults. The survey consisted of one question:

        Do you support the abortion controversy? (yes or no)

Results of the Survey
We tabulated the responses according to criteria of gender, age,
religious affiliation, and political affiliation.
[A detailed graphical interpretation of the data appears in section
1994-04-12 below.]

        Male:
        13% YES
        76% NO
        11% UNDECIDED

        Female:
        76% YES
        13% NO
        11% UNDECIDED

        Ages 18-50:
        59% YES
        32% NO
        9% UNDECIDED

[Note: In order to conform with recent Supreme Court interpretations of
U. S. laws, we have destroyed all data for the age group 51-64.]

        Ages 65 and above:
        23% YES
        21% NO
        56% UNDECIDED

        Protestant:
        83% YES
        12% NO
        5% UNDECIDED

        Catholic:
        12% YES
        83% NO
        5% UNDECIDED

        Jewish and/or Moslem
        43% YES
        42% NO
        5% UNDECIDED

        Other religeous affiliation, no religious affiliation,
        or illegible:
        3% YES
        3% NO
        94% UNDECIDED

        Republicans:
        32% YES
        62% NO
        4% UNDECIDED

        Democrats:
        62% YES
        32% NO
        4% UNDECIDED

        Independents:
        33% YES
        33% NO
        34% UNDECIDED

        Libertarians:
        98%YES
        2% NO
        0% UNDECIDED

Analysis and Conclusion
The American public is deeply divided on the abortion controversy.

1994-04-09      How to Submit Articles (*)

Since 1955, The Journal of Irreproducible Results has been the
publication of record for overly stimulating research and ideas. JIR
publishes original articles, news of particularly egregious scientific
results, and short notices of satiric and humorous intent. The editors
look forward to receiving your manuscripts, photographs, X-rays,
drawings, etc. Please do not send biological samples.

Articles are typically 500-2000 words in length. The entire manuscript
should be typed double-spaced on standard white bond paper, with
generous margins all around, and submitted with a photocopy.
Alternatively, you may submit via e-mail, in ASCII format.

Because of the volume of submissions, we are unable to acknowledge
receipt of manuscripts unless they are accompanied by a SELF-ADDRESSED,
ADEQUATELY STAMPED ENVELOPE.

Before you submit an article to The Journal of Irreproducible Results,
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE skim through a recent issue to see the typical
