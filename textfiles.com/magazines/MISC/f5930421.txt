POLITICAL zines.  Posted 21 March, 1993 by Jerod Pore.  
Included here are the political zines L. Reiko Higa and I have reviewed for
the up-coming Issue #47 of Factsheet Five, and the political zines Seth 
reviewed for Issue #46 of F5, AND reviews contributed by people on The
Net (thank you, thank you, thank you).  These are zines of a somewhat
"mainstream" bent, if one can consider communism, libertarianism and
anarchism to be mainstream.  The more extreme and/or "fringe" political
zines, such as white-supremicist zines, were included in the previously
released rant file (available now via anonymous ftp at red.css.itd.umich.edu
in /pub/Factsheet.Five).  Zines dealing with environmental issues, and
general 'news' zines were included in this file as well.

This file is part of FactSheet Five - Electric.  Questions or comments 
regarding FactSheet Five - Electric should be directed to

versions of Factsheet Five, the snailmail address is:

You might notice a change in our format.  This is due to using the official
Factsheet Five data-entry software.  The %Title: section is, for the most
part, the same, although we've added the date of the zine when available.  
%Descr: starts with a general review of the publication, indented thanks 
to the joys of FoxPro(tm), then a review of the issue(s) in particular, 
then, perhaps, a one or two line summary.  %Info: has the single issue and 
subscription prices followed by a carriage return, the number of pages, 
page size and the reviewer followed by a carriage return, then the 
policies on trading, submissions, reviews, back-issues, age-statements, 
ads and such.  This last section will still be somewhat error-prone as 
we aren't always clear on these policies when we read a zine.

The paper sizes translate as follows:
S -  Standard, or 8.5 x 11 inches
D -  Digest, or standard folded in half
L -  Legal, or 8.5 x 14 inches
HL - Half Legal, you figure it out
HS - Half Standard, or long digest 4.25 x 11 inches
T -  Tabloid, usually 11 x 17 or thereabouts
B -  Broadsheet, about 14 x 17
O -  Oversized and way bigger than tabloid or broadsheet
M -  Mini, from digest cut in half to postage stamp sized
A4 - Metric Standard, about 21 x 30 centimeters 
A5 - Metric Digest (don't have any handy to measure, and why does the 
     number get bigger when the paper is getter smaller?)
A2 - Metric Tabloid

Zines reviewed for Issue #47 of F5:



%Title:  COLTSFOOT: In appreciation of wild plants  Volume 13  Issue 6         
%Descr:  Nov/Dec.'92                                                           
         Essential and unique botanical zine dedicated to wild flora.
Altogether delightful, a joy to read and wonderfully illuminating, Coltsfoot
is a budding ethnobotanist's dream.  It offers up stories on the            
many-splendored gifts of the plant world, from suggesions of what to do with
old roses, an examination of ginseng, common smartweed and amazing new uses 
for common everyday plants such as the yew tree, the bark and berries of    
which are thought to be effective in treating lung and ovarian cancer, and  
weeds such as datura or "jimson weed" which one scientist has discovered is 
effective in recycling plutonium wastes.                                    
A must for every concerned and ecologically-conscious citizen!

The Missouri-based Frontier Report is an indie, reader-supported newspaper  
commmitted to "the empowerment of individuals through "sharing information, 
analysis and opinions of environmental, social, ethical and related topics. 
Full of anarchic humor, thought-provoking and rich rants, poetry and essays 
on everything from Bush to Bosnia-Herzegovina, African history, comfort &   
concern as a destructive irony of modern merican social reality, efforts to 
revise Holocaust revisionists, plus dispatches from the Vietnam Veterans

%Title:  NEW AGE PATRIOT: Quaterly Newsmagazine fro Drug, Environmental &      
%Descr:  Social Reform Activists  Volume 3  Issue 4  Winter, 1993              
         The New Age Patriot strives to solve drug, environmental and
         social problems.  One relatively easy fix to all three would
         be the re-legalization of marijuana.                        
This issue is dedicated to the probably lost cause of convincing Bill       
Clinton and Al Gore to take a stand on re-legalization.  Good luck.  The    
addresses they give are now out-of-date, but here's one for the email set:  
75300.3115@compuserve.com  That's the email address for the transition team.
Also part two of an exerpt from "The Great American Hemp Industry" by Jack  
Frazier, in which honest-to-God *facts* with cites and all are presented as 
to why Hemp is a far superior source of paper than trees.  Plus information 
on the second annual International Drug Policy Day to be held April 3, 1993 
at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, and elsewhere around the world. 
Probably the best US-based re-legalization publication.

%Title:  SALON: A Journal of Aesthetics  Issue 18  Winter 92/93                
%Descr:  "...the zine which explains libertarianism to artists and   
         art to libertarians - but anyone can play."  And it's my    
         favorite Libertarian zine.                                  
This huge issue focusses on Freedom of Expression, along with other         
forgotten elements of the Bill of Rights.  There's first-hand accounts of   
holding public readings of banned books, nasty encounters with local        
government art police, Island Records cowardly act of censoring             
Negativland's U2 single, Bob Z's run-in with the sanitation cops, court     
reporters arbitrarilly altering transcripts and the making of "Through the  
Wire."  Reprints from the Libertarian Alliance, great moments in censorship 
(from the 1600's to the present), Ace Backwards, Blair Wilson, quotes and   
notes from all over and (surprise!) government abuse of civil liberties.    
Signed, numbered, and essential.   Salon is especially essential if you     
though Libertarianism was raving Aynarchists out to make more money for     
Donald Trump.

%Title:  THE HOOKAH: The People's Pot Periodical  Issue 11                     
%Descr:  What's up with the campaign to legalize Cannabis in England.
A better version of all the world-saving abilities of hemp.  Mind you, I'm  
all for the legalization of pot, I'm just a bit skeptical of all the wonders
of a single plant.  But I'm no botanist.  Anyway, I've seen these claims    
over and over, but somebody *finally* gave some reputable documentation.    
The story of Howard Marks, the one-time main importer of hemp into England. 
Why hemp is so good for cattle.  Hemp through history.  Newsclippings,      
letters, form letters *you* can write, contact groups and so forth.  Better 
than most of the stateside publications on the subject.                     
Excellent take on the subject or relegalization.  Hemp cardstock cover.

comprised of parts of Montana, Washington, Oregon and Idaho and includes    
expansive farmlands, woodlands, oand orchards for optimal survival          
conditions, independent of fossil fuels.  The group behind the project are  
proponents of unifying U.S. and Canadian currency for one kind of universal,
worldwide method of exchange.  THe newsletter outlines the group's plan to  
build the Dancing Moose Lodge community; how much initial partners will be  
expected to contribute and what they will get in return.  A list of related 
publications and a resources guide are included.

%Descr:  120 years of writing about freethought 
         (or atheism, if you must) and honest money.  Just think what
         good shape this country would be in if it had 120 years of  
         freethought and honest money.                               
The big article this issue is on the covert history of the Federal Reserve  
and preceeding US central banks.  This is *not* a conspiracy theory,        
although I'm sure that the facts presented here have, or will show up in    
several.  One interesting point raised is that during the years of 1835 and 
1836, when there was no central bank in any form, the Federal Government had
a budget surplus that allowed for the building of universities, canals,     
bridges and roads.  Plus refutiations of Christian nonsense.                
An excellent perspective on values, monetary and humanistic.

         A disgruntled former employee of the National Security      
         Agency takes on government secrecy, government murder and   
         other all-too-typical government actions.  The Editorial    
         address is 2001 S Street NW  Suite 740  Washington DC       
         20009.                                                      
The Clinton administration as more of the same.  Commentary on the latest   
intelligence authorization bill (HR 5095), especially Gates' new openness   
policy that insists on classifying the few intelligence figures that have   
been published.  I hope this glasnost does for the CIA, NSA and agencies    
unknown what it did for the Soviet Union.  Even more bad news about INSLAW, 
BNL, the October Surprise and other tentacles of the mythic Octopus.

POLITICAL zines.  Posted 21 March, 1993 by Jerod Pore.  
Included here are the political zines L. Reiko Higa and I have reviewed for
the up-coming Issue #47 of Factsheet Five, and the political zines Seth 
reviewed for Issue #46 of F5, AND reviews contributed by people on The
Net (thank you, thank you, thank you).  These are zines of a somewhat
"mainstream" bent, if one can consider communism, libertarianism and
anarchism to be mainstream.  The more extreme and/or "fringe" political
zines, such as white-supremicist zines, were included in the previously
released rant file (available now via anonymous ftp at red.css.itd.umich.edu
in /pub/Factsheet.Five).  Zines dealing with environmental issues, and
general 'news' zines were included in this file as well.

You might notice a change in our format.  This is due to using the official
Factsheet Five data-entry software.  The %Title: section is, for the most
part, the same, although we've added the date of the zine when available.  
%Descr: starts with a general review of the publication, indented thanks 
to the joys of FoxPro(tm), then a review of the issue(s) in particular, 
then, perhaps, a one or two line summary.  %Info: has the single issue and 
subscription prices followed by a carriage return, the number of pages, 
page size and the reviewer followed by a carriage return, then the 
policies on trading, submissions, reviews, back-issues, age-statements, 
ads and such.  This last section will still be somewhat error-prone as 
we aren't always clear on these policies when we read a zine.

The paper sizes translate as follows:
S -  Standard, or 8.5 x 11 inches
D -  Digest, or standard folded in half
L -  Legal, or 8.5 x 14 inches
HL - Half Legal, you figure it out
HS - Half Standard, or long digest 4.25 x 11 inches
T -  Tabloid, usually 11 x 17 or thereabouts
B -  Broadsheet, about 14 x 17
O -  Oversized and way bigger than tabloid or broadsheet
M -  Mini, from digest cut in half to postage stamp sized
A4 - Metric Standard, about 21 x 30 centimeters 
A5 - Metric Digest (don't have any handy to measure, and why does the 
     number get bigger when the paper is getter smaller?)
A2 - Metric Tabloid

%Title:  COLTSFOOT: In appreciation of wild plants  Volume 13  Issue 6         
%Descr:  Nov/Dec.'92                                                           
         Essential and unique botanical zine dedicated to wild flora.
Altogether delightful, a joy to read and wonderfully illuminating, Coltsfoot
is a budding ethnobotanist's dream.  It offers up stories on the            
many-splendored gifts of the plant world, from suggesions of what to do with
old roses, an examination of ginseng, common smartweed and amazing new uses 
for common everyday plants such as the yew tree, the bark and berries of    
which are thought to be effective in treating lung and ovarian cancer, and  
weeds such as datura or "jimson weed" which one scientist has discovered is 
effective in recycling plutonium wastes.                                    
A must for every concerned and ecologically-conscious citizen!

%Title:  NEW AGE PATRIOT: Quaterly Newsmagazine fro Drug, Environmental &      
%Descr:  Social Reform Activists  Volume 3  Issue 4  Winter, 1993              
         The New Age Patriot strives to solve drug, environmental and
         social problems.  One relatively easy fix to all three would
         be the re-legalization of marijuana.                        
This issue is dedicated to the probably lost cause of convincing Bill       
Clinton and Al Gore to take a stand on re-legalization.  Good luck.  The    
addresses they give are now out-of-date, but here's one for the email set:  
75300.3115@compuserve.com  That's the email address for the transition team.
Also part two of an exerpt from "The Great American Hemp Industry" by Jack  
Frazier, in which honest-to-God *facts* with cites and all are presented as 
to why Hemp is a far superior source of paper than trees.  Plus information 
on the second annual International Drug Policy Day to be held April 3, 1993 
at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, and elsewhere around the world. 
Probably the best US-based re-legalization publication.

%Descr:  "...the zine which explains libertarianism to artists and   
         art to libertarians - but anyone can play."  And it's my    
         favorite Libertarian zine.                                  
This huge issue focusses on Freedom of Expression, along with other         
forgotten elements of the Bill of Rights.  There's first-hand accounts of   
holding public readings of banned books, nasty encounters with local        
government art police, Island Records cowardly act of censoring             
Negativland's U2 single, Bob Z's run-in with the sanitation cops, court     
reporters arbitrarilly altering transcripts and the making of "Through the  
Wire."  Reprints from the Libertarian Alliance, great moments in censorship 
(from the 1600's to the present), Ace Backwards, Blair Wilson, quotes and   
notes from all over and (surprise!) government abuse of civil liberties.    
Signed, numbered, and essential.   Salon is especially essential if you     
though Libertarianism was raving Aynarchists out to make more money for     
Donald Trump.

%Title:  THE HOOKAH: The People's Pot Periodical  Issue 11                     
%Descr:  What's up with the campaign to legalize Cannabis in England.
A better version of all the world-saving abilities of hemp.  Mind you, I'm  
all for the legalization of pot, I'm just a bit skeptical of all the wonders
of a single plant.  But I'm no botanist.  Anyway, I've seen these claims    
over and over, but somebody *finally* gave some reputable documentation.    
The story of Howard Marks, the one-time main importer of hemp into England. 
Why hemp is so good for cattle.  Hemp through history.  Newsclippings,      
letters, form letters *you* can write, contact groups and so forth.  Better 
than most of the stateside publications on the subject.                     
Excellent take on the subject or relegalization.  Hemp cardstock cover.

%Descr:  120 years of writing about freethought 
         (or atheism, if you must) and honest money.  Just think what
         good shape this country would be in if it had 120 years of  
         freethought and honest money.                               
The big article this issue is on the covert history of the Federal Reserve  
and preceeding US central banks.  This is *not* a conspiracy theory,        
although I'm sure that the facts presented here have, or will show up in    
several.  One interesting point raised is that during the years of 1835 and 
1836, when there was no central bank in any form, the Federal Government had
a budget surplus that allowed for the building of universities, canals,     
bridges and roads.  Plus refutiations of Christian nonsense.                
An excellent perspective on values, monetary and humanistic.

         A disgruntled former employee of the National Security

         other all-too-typical government actions.  The Editorial

The Clinton administration as more of the same.  Commentary on the latest   
intelligence authorization bill (HR 5095), especially Gates' new openness   
policy that insists on classifying the few intelligence figures that have   
been published.  I hope this glasnost does for the CIA, NSA and agencies    
unknown what it did for the Soviet Union.  Even more bad news about INSLAW, 
BNL, the October Surprise and other tentacles of the mythic Octopus.

POLITICAL zines.  Posted 21 March, 1993 by Jerod Pore.  
Included here are the political zines L. Reiko Higa and I have reviewed for
the up-coming Issue #47 of Factsheet Five, and the political zines Seth 
reviewed for Issue #46 of F5, AND reviews contributed by people on The
Net (thank you, thank you, thank you).  These are zines of a somewhat
"mainstream" bent, if one can consider communism, libertarianism and
anarchism to be mainstream.  The more extreme and/or "fringe" political
zines, such as white-supremicist zines, were included in the previously
released rant file (available now via anonymous ftp at red.css.itd.umich.edu
in /pub/Factsheet.Five).  Zines dealing with environmental issues, and
general 'news' zines were included in this file as well.

This file is part of FactSheet Five - Electric.  Questions or comments 
regarding FactSheet Five - Electric should be directed to 
jerod23@well.sf.ca.us

If you wish to send zines for review in both the electronic and print
versions of Factsheet Five, the snailmail address is:

You might notice a change in our format.  This is due to using the official
Factsheet Five data-entry software.  The %Title: section is, for the most
part, the same, although we've added the date of the zine when available.  
%Descr: starts with a general review of the publication, indented thanks 
to the joys of FoxPro(tm), then a review of the issue(s) in particular, 
then, perhaps, a one or two line summary.  %Info: has the single issue and 
subscription prices followed by a carriage return, the number of pages, 
page size and the reviewer followed by a carriage return, then the 
policies on trading, submissions, reviews, back-issues, age-statements, 
ads and such.  This last section will still be somewhat error-prone as 
we aren't always clear on these policies when we read a zine.

The paper sizes translate as follows:
S -  Standard, or 8.5 x 11 inches
D -  Digest, or standard folded in half
L -  Legal, or 8.5 x 14 inches
HL - Half Legal, you figure it out
HS - Half Standard, or long digest 4.25 x 11 inches
T -  Tabloid, usually 11 x 17 or thereabouts
B -  Broadsheet, about 14 x 17
O -  Oversized and way bigger than tabloid or broadsheet
M -  Mini, from digest cut in half to postage stamp sized
A4 - Metric Standard, about 21 x 30 centimeters 
A5 - Metric Digest (don't have any handy to measure, and why does the

%Title:  COLTSFOOT: In appreciation of wild plants  Volume 13  Issue 6         
%Descr:  Nov/Dec.'92                                                           
         Essential and unique botanical zine dedicated to wild flora.
Altogether delightful, a joy to read and wonderfully illuminating, Coltsfoot
is a budding ethnobotanist's dream.  It offers up stories on the            
many-splendored gifts of the plant world, from suggesions of what to do with
old roses, an examination of ginseng, common smartweed and amazing new uses 
for common everyday plants such as the yew tree, the bark and berries of    
which are thought to be effective in treating lung and ovarian cancer, and  
weeds such as datura or "jimson weed" which one scientist has discovered is 
effective in recycling plutonium wastes.                                    
A must for every concerned and ecologically-conscious citizen!

The Missouri-based Frontier Report is an indie, reader-supported newspaper

%Title:  NEW AGE PATRIOT: Quaterly Newsmagazine fro Drug, Environmental &      
%Descr:  Social Reform Activists  Volume 3  Issue 4  Winter, 1993              
         The New Age Patriot strives to solve drug, environmental and
         social problems.  One relatively easy fix to all three would
         be the re-legalization of marijuana.                        
This issue is dedicated to the probably lost cause of convincing Bill       
Clinton and Al Gore to take a stand on re-legalization.  Good luck.  The    
addresses they give are now out-of-date, but here's one for the email set:  
75300.3115@compuserve.com  That's the email address for the transition team.
Also part two of an exerpt from "The Great American Hemp Industry" by Jack  
Frazier, in which honest-to-God *facts* with cites and all are presented as 
to why Hemp is a far superior source of paper than trees.  Plus information 
on the second annual International Drug Policy Day to be held April 3, 1993 
at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, and elsewhere around the world. 
Probably the best US-based re-legalization publication.

%Title:  SALON: A Journal of Aesthetics  Issue 18  Winter 92/93                
%Descr:  "...the zine which explains libertarianism to artists and   
         art to libertarians - but anyone can play."  And it's my    
         favorite Libertarian zine.                                  
This huge issue focusses on Freedom of Expression, along with other         
forgotten elements of the Bill of Rights.  There's first-hand accounts of   
holding public readings of banned books, nasty encounters with local        
government art police, Island Records cowardly act of censoring             
Negativland's U2 single, Bob Z's run-in with the sanitation cops, court     
reporters arbitrarilly altering transcripts and the making of "Through the  
Wire."  Reprints from the Libertarian Alliance, great moments in censorship 
(from the 1600's to the present), Ace Backwards, Blair Wilson, quotes and   
notes from all over and (surprise!) government abuse of civil liberties.    
Signed, numbered, and essential.   Salon is especially essential if you     
though Libertarianism was raving Aynarchists out to make more money for     
Donald Trump.

%Title:  THE HOOKAH: The People's Pot Periodical  Issue 11                     
%Descr:  What's up with the campaign to legalize Cannabis in England.
A better version of all the world-saving abilities of hemp.  Mind you, I'm  
all for the legalization of pot, I'm just a bit skeptical of all the wonders
of a single plant.  But I'm no botanist.  Anyway, I've seen these claims    
over and over, but somebody *finally* gave some reputable documentation.    
The story of Howard Marks, the one-time main importer of hemp into England. 
Why hemp is so good for cattle.  Hemp through history.  Newsclippings,      
letters, form letters *you* can write, contact groups and so forth.  Better 
than most of the stateside publications on the subject.                     
Excellent take on the subject or relegalization.  Hemp cardstock cover.

%Descr:  120 years of writing about freethought 
         (or atheism, if you must) and honest money.  Just think what
         good shape this country would be in if it had 120 years of  
         freethought and honest money.                               
The big article this issue is on the covert history of the Federal Reserve  
and preceeding US central banks.  This is *not* a conspiracy theory,        
although I'm sure that the facts presented here have, or will show up in    
several.  One interesting point raised is that during the years of 1835 and 
1836, when there was no central bank in any form, the Federal Government had
a budget surplus that allowed for the building of universities, canals,     
bridges and roads.  Plus refutiations of Christian nonsense.                
An excellent perspective on values, monetary and humanistic.

         A disgruntled former employee of the National Security      
         Agency takes on government secrecy, government murder and   
         other all-too-typical government actions.  The Editorial

The Clinton administration as more of the same.  Commentary on the latest   
intelligence authorization bill (HR 5095), especially Gates' new openness   
policy that insists on classifying the few intelligence figures that have   
been published.  I hope this glasnost does for the CIA, NSA and agencies    
unknown what it did for the Soviet Union.  Even more bad news about INSLAW, 
BNL, the October Surprise and other tentacles of the mythic Octopus.
