     Well, this file has absolutely nothing to do with what we normally
  cover.  However, I've always enjoyed a good story and hopefully there are
  some other creative minds out there who will be encouraged to write for
  us. I hope you enjoy this story as much as I did writing it.

                              "Him"
     
     I am not crazy.  About that I am sure.  He was always there
watching me as he is right now.  It was hard to see him at first
but he can no longer hide from me.  Who he is I do not know.  He
has no face.  It is that face which he doesn't have that I've
feared and yet I can't draw my eyes from it.  
     It started a little while ago after I was exiting my office
and walking down the stairs that led to the garage.  I liked taking
the stairs even though they had so many problems with muggers at
one point because it was actually a way for me to get exercise.  As
long as you were careful and looked in the security mirrors set up
you didn't have to worry, but now I wish I never took those stairs.
     It was on the stairs where I saw him for the first time.  As
I was walking down the stairs I saw him in one of the security
mirrors. I stopped and concentrated more closely on this man in the
mirror.  A chill went through me as I saw that he was staring right
at me and yet he had no face.  But I could tell he was looking at
me.  But everybody has a face.  I figured it was just my
imagination getting the better of me after a long day of work so I
rounded the corner of the stairs and to my relief nobody was there. 
I didn't think anything more of it and just drove straight home
thinking it was just another typical day but now I know it wasn't. 
     I didn't see him again for two weeks.  When I did see him
again he was standing in the same spot on the stairs around that
corner but this time he wasn't in the mirror.  I know this now
because I always check the security mirrors when I round corners in
the stairs so I don't have to worry about hiding muggers.  But when
I rounded the corner, there he was again looking at me.  And there
was something hateful and eerie in the colorless void where his
face should be which almost caused me to lose control of my
bladder.
     I asked him what he wanted yet he said nothing.  Then a very
low, throbbing noise filled my head.  I covered my ears and yet
nothing seemed to stop it.  I then noticed that he was getting
closer to me and yet strangely he wasn't moving.  I was paralyzed
with fear as he got closer to me.  Finally, something in my head
finally broke through and said, "RUN! RUN," and I did.  I turned
around and ran straight back up the stairs and flew for my office.
Once I was in my office I bolted the door and it was there that I
spent the night.
     I was really frightened now because I knew that this thing had
something hateful against me.  Yet I had absolutely no idea who he
was, why he was after me, and where he came from.  I still don't
know.  Yet he is still out there waiting to pounce on me as soon as
he gets his chance.
     I saw Him again two days later.  Yes, it was in the same spot
in the stairs again and no, I didn't see him in the mirror (believe
me, I was checking all the time by now.)  I'm not sure what exactly
provoked me but I started yelling at him but then quickly stopped. 
A dagger had appeared in his hand.  It wasn't there before!  I know
this!  It just seemed to all of a sudden be there.  That low noise
started up in my head again and I still couldn't stop it.  It was
the worst sound I've ever heard.  It just seemed to rip through
your skull stopping all thinking and yet there was nothing you
could do to stop it.  He was getting closer to me again.  I bolted
for my office but when I exited the stairs he was standing outside
my office looking at me.  The noise was still going and he started
moving towards me again.  I had no idea what to do.  The noise was
making it impossible to think.  Like a confused rat in a maze I
just ran to the nearest exit which was the stairs again.  I wasn't
surprised to see him in the stairs again but this time I didn't
turn around.  I just kept on running down the stairs at him
thinking that maybe I could knock him over and get to my car.  Yet
somehow I didn't knock him over.  I just ran right through him and
he managed to slash my arm as I ran through him.  It was then that
I knew that he was real.
     I kept running until I made it to my car and then drove faster
than I ever have in my life out of that garage and back to my
house.  I may have been at my home for weeks yet the amount of time
I stayed at my home escapes me at the moment.  Naturally, during my
paranoid vacation at home my boss called me up to tell that my work
at the office was no longer needed.  I swore at my boss and then
slammed down the phone when that damn sound kicked in again.  I
looked out my window and there he was standing on my lawn.
     I decided it was time to protect myself so I got into my car
and pushed the remote control to open the door to my garage.  He
was standing right in front of the car with the dagger in his hand. 
I put the car into drive and floored it right into him.  Yet I felt
no impact when I hit him.  I looked back when I got to the end of
the driveway and he was still standing there looking at me under
that colorless blanket of a face.  The noise started up again and
I was overwhelmed with stress and fear.  I just closed my eyes and
blocked out everything.  When I opened my eyes again the noise
stopped and he was no longer there.  Had he ever been there?  No!
It was impossible.  Just as I started to relax the noise started up
and he was standing right next to my door.  The next thing I knew
I felt a stinging sensation on my face and blood was dripping on my
clothes.  Somehow he managed to reach through my glass window
without breaking and cut my face.  Yet he never moved the whole
time.  He just stood there looking at me through eyes that weren't
there.
     At that point I really began to panic and I just drove away as
fast as I could and yet the whole time I couldn't escape that
horrid noise.  And every corner I passed I saw Him there with his
dagger in hand looking at me.
     I parked my car outside a gun store and ran inside as fast as
I could.  That horrible noise was still filling my head and hearing
was the greatest challenge I faced at the moment.  The store owner
was obviously upset about my presence being that I was bleeding
from my face.  He told me that he thought I should get my face
looked at and I told him I thought he should mind his own damned
business.  From this point on he was very quiet and basically just
gave me the gun I asked for.  I decided on a nice rifle I saw
behind the glass display case and the store owner even gave me a
discount on the rifle and the shells.  I guess he wasn't too
disturbed about me being there to take my money and sell me a
rifle.
     I then went straight back to my house.  The whole time that
terrible noise had never stopped.  As I pulled into my driveway I
saw Him standing on my front lawn.  I pulled into the garage,
grabbed my rifle and ammo, ran into the house, and bolted the door
behind me.  The noise still hadn't stopped and I looked out my
window to see him still standing in my front yard looking at me.
I then loaded my rifle and fired it at him three times.  On the
third shot he disappeared and the noise finally stopped.  I drifted
off to sleep.
     I was awakened by a knocking at my door.  I looked through the
peep hole in the door and saw two police officers standing on my
front steps.  My neighbors had probably called the police about the
rifle shots that came from my house.  I opened the door and they
identified themselves and proceeded to ask me if I had fired or
heard any gunshots that day. I told them no but they didn't seem to
believe me.  They asked me if they could search my house and I said
they could.  I guess they were worried that I may have shot
somebody.
     The search went on for a long time and they seemed to be
spending an extra amount of time searching the basement.  I thought
the search had gone on long enough and I was about to walk down
into the basement and tell them about Him and what had happened
when I saw something.  I looked into the basement and I saw Him
searching around behind some boxes.  I couldn't allow Him to be in
my house so I quietly went to go get my rifle.  I returned to the
basement door with the rifle and still saw Him searching around. 
The sound kicked in again and it was more than I could take.  I
loaded the rifle and shot Him in the head.  He fell over on the
ground.  All of a sudden I saw him again and this time he had
again.  He fired the gun at me but missed and I shot Him again in
the head.  This Him also fell over.  The noise then stopped and I
started to regain my senses.  It was then that I realized that I
had just killed the two police officers.
     I ran up to the second floor of my house and into my bedroom. 
I was right about to go to sleep again when the noise started up
again louder than it had ever been before.  I looked out my window
and saw Hims everywhere!  One of Him was riding a bike and I took
the rifle and shot him in the head.  I laughed as he fell to the
ground.  All of the Hims started to run and I knew I had finally
beaten him because he was now scared of me.  I quickly reloaded my
rifle and shot one of Him in the head who was trying to hide behind
parked car.  Him's brains were all over the sidewalk after that and
I was pleased with the fact that I was finally defeating Him. 
There were a group of Hims who had been playing ball in the street
trying to run away but I couldn't let that happen.  I shot all of
them before they could reach their safety.  I shot all the hims I
could until I ran out of bullets.  The noise was still booming in
my brain but I knew he was scared.  I knew that I had killed enough
Hims to get my message across to Him.  Soon after this I blacked
out.
     When I awoke I was in a darkened cell all by myself.  I was
really frightened because I had no idea how I'd gotten here.  I
started to fear that maybe Him had gotten me while I was asleep and
my heart started beating a mile a minute.  I started to scream and
to my relief a police officer came to my cell and took me out.  The
officer brought me to a room where there were many other men
present.  They started to ask me questions and it was then that I
realized I had killed twenty-three people in that shooting spree I
had at my house.  The sound started again and I began to scream. 
The police were obviously in no mood to put up with me anymore and
I was escorted back to my cell.
     As we reached the hallway where my cell was I saw Him standing
at the other end of the hallway. He started to get closer to me
brandishing the dagger in his hand and yet he wasn't moving at all.
I started to scream and struggle against the officers who were
escorting me back to my cell.  They didn't hesitate to give me the
beating of my life right there and then to just toss me into my
cell like a dead body into a fire.  Luckily I was safe inside my
cell before Him reached me.
     Now he just waits for me outside the door to my cell.  All I
can see is the colorless nothingness where his face should be
through the window in the door to my cell.  I can't draw my eyes
away from his face anymore.  I am mesmerized by the nothingness I
see in his face and yet I no longer fear it.  I also have found
that low sound which fills my head to become oddly likeable.
     I know I am going to die the next time I leave this cell. 
There is no way Him will miss me this time and allow me to escape
again.  Yet I no longer seem to mind even though confronting him
again is the worst of my fears.  Yet it must be destined to happen
and I will not struggle against him.  If I die when I am dragged
out of this cell then you will know that this story is true.  I
hope it accurately answers all the other questions you never got to
ask also and provides you with a clear view of my situation. 
Please forgive me.
