Once again it's June. School's out, the pools are open, flowers are in full bloom, but most importantly, ACiD PLUM has returned. After a short haitus for finals, I went back to work sorting through all the latest submissions. Here's what I came up with, the best local writing around. As always, keep the submissions rolling in; poems, short stories, articles, etc. I am hoping to expand the PLUM into a ten pager but I can't do it without your help. KEEP UP THE SUPPORT!!!!!! This is just the text from the infamous ACiD PLUM 'zine. For an issue <complete with art and font work> E-mail ACiD PLuM 4 details.........THANX!!!!!!!!

There is something not said.
Something is not spoken.
Why are you in my mind?
I want you to go.
	Just go.
I'll watch you go.
	Just go.
I need you to go.
	Just go.
I'll die if you go.
	Just go...
And let me watch you walk away.

CULT BOY
Ed Cyzewski

   Bob, who had been surnamed Fierra de Guerra (which means "Wild Beast of War" in Spanish) surveyed the usual afternoon events of the walled-in compound.  The men were raising hell with their sub-atomic machine guns on the shooting range and the women were in the gymnasium instructing the little children on the true faith.
   As his euphoric state rose higher and higher, Bob realized just how happy his supreme leader, Marduk, would be.  Bob learned to respect and love Marduk ever-since he left his family to go join the cult, he would follow any order that Marduk gave.  The unusual mark of a smile cracked on Bob's stoic face as he realized what he and his fellow brothers were about to pull off.  In just a few short hours, they were going to scale the unsuspecting walls of the Nabisco Cookie Corp. in Philadelphia.
   To most outside observers, this may seem like a rather silly goal for a religious cult but of course there was a good reason for it.  Marduk informed his followers several days before that the Almighty Father told him that cookies were to be used to commemorate the last supper instead of bread.  Bob and 15 others loaded up all their fire-arms in the backs of two vans, preparing for the Nabisco siege.
   The next day they set out and arrived in the cookie warehouse parking lot and unloaded their weapons.  As they began their attack, a wall of state troopers enclosed itself around the faction, apparently tipped off by an undercover agent to the plans of Marduk's men.  The shocked cult members put up little resistance and were arrested and thrown in jail.  
   After sitting in their communal cell for a number of days, they were visited by an enraged Marduk.  The cult leader entered by doing a strange dance and chanting something about Vanilla Wafers, Nutty Buddies, and Oreo's.  Then, after completing his anger ritual, Marduk ascended the cell's lone bunk-bed.  In a loud, booming voice, he condemned them all to an eternity of suffering pain in the fiery  armpits of hell.  All the men groaned, bit their tongues, and began to emulate Marduk's corpeal fluctuations.  The end result -- a massive jail house mosh-pit.
  Some Neo-Nazi Skin Heads in an adjoining cell were moved by the enthralling scene and offered Bob and his brethren membership in their community.  Bob promptly accepted, whipping out a Bic brand razor, freeing his friends of the burdens of hair.  After two weeks, Bob convinced the police to release his men because in fact they were no longer volatile religious radicals.  Instead, they were harmless bunch of Nazi's.  The deal sounded sweet and so the cops let them go.  
   Three months later Bob and his men were lost at sea when they attempted to cross the Atlantic in a small fishing skiff in search of the motherland, Germany.
   The moral of the story -- Cults are bad, and so is nazism.  We must rise up, band together, and SAVE OUR COOKIE FACTORIES!!!!

TRIBE-13 REVIEW
Dave Konopka 

   Hard-core.  Anti-trust is not some watered down Smash punk dream.  It's HARD-CORE.  The product of local four-some, Tribe 13, Anti-trust rocks from start to finish.  The opening song, "Black Glass 2", delivers a thick mix of rocking guitar riffs and up-tempo drum rolls to the listener over a gooey layer of electronic toy-laser zaps.  Track six, "Bybery Rd.", offers another heaping helping of pure rock.  Singer Lon tells about his walk to the nearby mental institution on one fine sunny day amidst a screeching guitar, booming bass, and infuriating drum palpitations.  
   Tribe 13, originating in Philadelphia, is about three years old.  The group, made up of lead singer Lon, guitarist Jeff, bassist Bob, and drummer Mike, has played the Troc's showcase night and regularly tours local bars and parties.  Disc/ Connection stocks Anti-trust and a Tribe 13 show is planned for the record store in mid-August.  Also planned is a 7" release with the Deceptacons due out in mid-July.  For a copy of Anti-trust send $5 to : Tribe 13 c/o Bob Jacobs 9964 Hegermen St. Philadelphia, PA 19114 or for info. call Bob at (215) 824-3922.  CHECK OUT TRIBE-13 at Discconnection on Aug 13 with Shallow and Blind Witness. Call 639-ROCK for details.......TIX $3.00       

PENETRATION
Matt O'Brien

Whatever you've lost is always taken away.
What's thought forever will never stay.
What you have never dreamt true 
Is exactly now what is leaving you.
What you truly desire is no longer there.
What you have, temporarily, is just spare.
What's sparse is what's desired.
Depression, worthless and uninspired.
What life is presently is a just a waste.
All that is seen is images of her lips, remembering the taste.
In her arms you felt so strong.
Now in unfamiliar arms where you don't belong.
You will love until the end.
Once a lover, now barely a friend.

WHITE ZOMBIE CONCERT REVIEW
Gurn Lanley

   As school was about to close and the seniors were about to graduate, my junior class compadres and I got wind of a concert that would become the kickoff concert of our summer. Playing was my not-so-favorite band, White Zombie, with the Reverend Horton Heat and the Melvins.
   June 2nd came around and Mr. Ass, Esquire and Mega, the guitarists in my band Torpid State, piled in Mega's car and we hopped onto 95 and shot for the Tower.  After a long detour, we arrived.
   My heart leapt as Buzzo, Mark and Dale mounted the stage to the crushing sonic disturbances that have become the trademark sound of the Melvins and the rest of Seattle. I banged my head along with the slow, bone shattering dirges provided by Buzzo and Co. A few onlookers yelled "You suck!" to his majesty, King Buzzo. I screamed my undying support as the 7 minutes + of distortion subdued the crowd into a bewildered throng. Moods lightened as the Reverend took the stage. He, along with bassist Jimbo and a replacement drummer for normal lineup drummer Taz, suffered from a lack of crowd support but played with a FIERCE determination anyway. 
   White Zombie finally mounted the stage after an agonizing 35 minute wait. It was worth the wait to see the stage set up. The stage was something straight out of a B-movie with a gaudy, neon sign that read "White Zombie". It was truly a unique experience. Needless to say, I am now a fan and would encourage anyone to pick up their debut, La Sexorcisto: Devil Music Volume 1 or their new release Astro Creep 2000. 

TO MY FROG ON HIS LITTLE HAT
Matt Lydon

Stand tall, Little Frog
Death can't hurt you now
Overdose on happiness
Sunlight on your brow

Your magic hat has taken you 
Taken you places we've never seen
But you remember, of course you do
Remembering places you've never been

Start over, Little Frog 
And throw your drugs away
Learn to play with us again
And return to normal someday

OKLAHOMA
Mike Capozi

In Oklahoma, there has been a bomb
Killed my father, killed my mom
Lost everything I knew 
Now I don't know what I will do
Got no family, no one to live with
Peace and happiness?  It all seems a myth
Maybe an orphanage will be good for me
But I don't want to wait and see
At this point, desire to live is slim
All future prospects seem very dim
Maybe I'll finish school
If I didn't, I'd be thought a fool
But not much makes any sense any more
My heart is bleeding and my body is all sore
Or maybe I'll just lie down to rest
For soon I may take the final test 
Of whether I can make it through these times
Because of the evil men who committed these hideous crimes

DREAM
Dave Konopka

	The tall grass swayed in the early afternoon breeze.  The blue sky was blotched with enormous, swift puffs of white.  I could feel the chill, not in the air though.  We danced across the field, hand in hand, frolicing in the sun.  Ahead of us, a rising grade paramounting in a deserted thoroughfare.  Behind us, dark woods with a house here and a barn there.  We almost reached the road, but we came upon a perfectly rectangular pool. edged with cinder blocks.  The water was clear and pure.  We looked but needed little. We went on our way.
	In time, we came to a bend in the road.  To our right lay a single line of dark trees, then a path, then dense forest.  We cut through the row of pines and walked up the path between good and bad.  Up ahead lay a disabled cop car with a lone civilian passenger in the driver's seat.  We neared the vehicle and the man ran at us.  We ran as fast as we could but I stumbled alot.   She flew like the wind.  With no time to spare, she carried me and we out ran the plain clothes cop.  
	We left the path and walked on the road, the whole time holding hands.  I tried to steal a kiss here and grab a hug there but each time I was reminded of my brown shirt.  I offered a trip to my grandmother's but I was put off.  Up the street lay another curve.  Above, the sky no longer beamed, only devious grinning now.  A small creek beyond the bend erupted into tsunami shouts, spraying spit all over the road.
	I got us to safety, but on the path, shadowed from sun, she was not.  I found a phone, called her house...she answered "Are we still going to my Grandmom's?"  Then it hit me....She's back in her own....hang up the phone.  I did.  It rang.  I watched.  I forgot.

SUPPLEMENTAL INSANITY
Matt O'Brien

Does she feel remorse
Does she just feel pity
Did she take the right course
Does he hurt out of jealousy
Will their love ever unite
Will their love merely be forgotten
His eyes still put up a fight
The tears still run free, he cannot stop them 
He prays for harmonious life
But his swish is granted in sorrow
Learning to get a grasp on your life
Will help in the long-run starting tomorrow

ELIZABETH
Anonymous

There is an unrelenting surge of feelings 
That keeps affecting my mind.
The continual highs and lows
Question my waiting heart.
Feeling a touch from your golden silhouette,
There is a deep sense of passion and security.
Though we have aquainted but once,
As our lips met, the power was plain to see.
Together, you and me.

FEED
Marcy Cohen

You're turning into 
Everything that I detest
You're becoming worse 
Than all the rest

Red light, green light
You stop and you go
Good life, bad life
There's emptiness below

No matter what you do
No matter what you say
No matter what we want
It'll always go your way

Scared to look in the mirror
Because you know what's there
All the hidden pain
The dragon's lair

Egos feed on other's worries
Egos feed on other's tears
Egos feed on other's trauma
Egos feed on other's fears

You're no better 
Than anyone here
You try to hide it 
But I see your fear

Bright lights
Covered by nightmares
Winter dreams
Tell you to beware

See the flames
Burning in your eyes
Every time you open your mouth
Someone else's heart dies

Blue skies
Shelter from the storm
Orange sun
Keep us safe and warm

All your life is an insult
To the kindness of those who try 
All your is a reason
For those around you to cry

Five more months
Until self-destruction
No time left 
For reconstruction

Caught up in a net 
Captured by those who hurt
Re-light the fire
Put out by those you've burnt

ENUFF
Dave Konopka

Words are nothing when used to express the joy that you incite.
Paper is the last medium which I would choose to describe your angelic beauty.
I wish there was a phrase I could construct in which to show the warmth that all your ways 	ignite in me.
I wish there was a paragraph I could compose in which I opened you to all of the ways that 	heart brightens my days.
The best present that you have offered is not that of Chocolate or Cotton but rather of  	spirit and soul. 
My greatest regret is that I never met you sooner, my greatest comfort is knowing that we'll 	be together for much longer.
My heart is in your hands, safe I know.
My joy is in your voice, my happiness in your eyes.
By now I've probably bored you but forever you will inspire me.
These words are so ineffective anymore, but I certain  love you.

FREEDOM
Josh Anderson

Freedom, it wants to be.
All my life kept inside of me.
Freedom, can't be taken away.
People suppress one another every day.
Freedom, it has to live.
Society's a mess, we haven't learned
	
Freedom, wrapped up in stone.
Freedom, we're all alone.
Freedom, it is so great.
Freedom.  It's just monotony.

We have a ruler.  We have God.
We are bound by law.
We are suppressed by tears.
We are restrained by conscience.
We are suppressed by peers.
We are restrained by heart.
We imprison ourselves.

BOTTLE
Dave Konopka

Tonight I found a bottle, dingy and blue.
Tonight I found a bottle, dark and anything      
   but true.

Moonless midnight skies brighten the used   
   glass ornamentation,
Reflecting the depths of my dimmest     
   innermost lamentation.

The loosened cap is as tight as can be,
Inside is a note I can barely see.

What's this?Can I trust my eyes? Could this    
   note be from such a forgotten source?
It speaks of bright moons and radiant suns, 
   winds of summer and dews of eve,   
   happiness without force.

I place the letter on an absent shelf, 
The author in question is myself.
