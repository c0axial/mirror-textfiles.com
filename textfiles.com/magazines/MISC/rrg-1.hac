  Well, this is our first newsletter.  You're probably stunned, aren't you?
Well, lots of stuff has gone on since the last RRG file was released.  Shall
we talk about it? Good.

  First and probably most importantly, asmost of you know, the gold box does
not work, but the diverter box is supposed to.  Well, Gatsby and myself made
one [well, he made it, while I fixed his beige box...] and it did not work.
Us and two other non-RRG members tested it out. we ANI'd the numbers and
all, but one of them was always busy, and we couldnt' get it NOT to be busy,
so we couldn't use it.  If anyone has gotten a diverter/gold box to work,
PLEASE contact us on the board above.

  Next, Gatsby and myself alogn with a few other non-RRG members [didn't he
just say that?] went out to the desert by the border of Arizona and
California.  It was RRrreeaaalll fun. [yeah right.]  What did we do? We shot
off a model rocket with an explosive warhead, and of course, it didn't blow
up anything.  And we shot about 500 rounds into cactus. Wow, we're anarchists,
huh? I don't know why I am putting this here, I guess just because it is
soemthing to write about and we need a longer newsletter, right?

  We have a new project underway.  It will be the ultimate info-form buster.
Howeer, unlike loser AkRoNyM lists put out by others that try and tell us
BASIC does not mean Beginner's All-purpose Simplified Instruction Code, but
but Beginner's All-purpose Instruction Code, it will have more acronyms than
you will ever believe! Look for it at a board near you soon!

  Insanity Lane and The Crypt will probably soon switch to Elite BBS software
written by Doctor Dissector.  We haven't gotten any official words from
Scooter, Doctor Dissector or from another source, but we will be asking them
sometime soon.  If it works out, then the two boards are going to set up
an elite network with Alternate Reality on it as well.  This could help bring
the flow of information to alot of other places pretty fast.

  Next, as usual, Dimension Shifter hasn't written anything, and I'm
considering his expulsion...

  InterNet hacking has become a bit more difficult lately.  Brute Hacker does
not always pick up on passwords when it should be [reading them from a file],
and so we have switched to using Kode Crusher or something liek that by
Doctor Dissector.  But, then we found out that the program can't take too
big of a password list, and that will take me sometime to work at and program
out, which brings me to...

  There is a non-text file by RRG that I wrote a little while ago called,
"RRG-SEP.ZIP" or something similar.  This program will rip text files to
pieces so that you can use something like KC or Brute on a large password
list and have a whole bunch of passwords. Look for it on a quality board near
you or you can DL it from the Crypt.

  Finally, there is supposedly a new virus out, I've seen it as "NJERU.ZIP"
that will supposedly run itself when it's unzipped.  You might not care, but
if you run a BBS, then you're in deep shit.  Why?  Well, you had better
disable your extractor or you will be able to have anyone who wants just go
and infect your system with it.  I don't know if it's true or not, because
I am not stupid enough to try to unzip it.  if it says don't, then i won't,
but I will try to experiment with it.  I haven't checked to see if scan picks
it up, but I know you can type, "pkunzip -v njeru.zip" and you don't get
infected, so i doubt that it would infect you when you integrity test it,
either, but they could use the extractor to extract it on your board! And,
that would suck!

'till later.
