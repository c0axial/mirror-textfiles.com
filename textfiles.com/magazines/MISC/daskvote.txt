       ³ Voting form

         Please offer 5 minutes to fill out this simple voting form.

         You are not allowed to vote for your own group nor any of the
       members of your own group. You should not vote for any iSC
       members or iSC productions.

         The groups or persons you vote for, must be active on PC, and
       that means you cannot vote for other scenes than the PC scene,
       since this IS the PC-scene!

         For the demos, demogroups and the intros-charts, you must enter
       at least 5 entries, coders, musicans or graphicans-charts, at
       least 3 entries must be entered. You do not have to type anything
       at the 4kintro/diskmag/musicdisk entries if you don't know any,
       due to the fact that musicdisks are not so usual on PC yet, and
       people are not so keen on badly coded 4k intros yet. For the
       Norwegian chart, you do not have to enter anything unless you are
       Norwegian, but opinions from foreigners are also very welcome :-).
