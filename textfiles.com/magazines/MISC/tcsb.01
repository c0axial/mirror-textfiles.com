                  An Introduction by Doctor Cypher and Necrovore

   Welcome to the premier issue of TCSB, the no-bullshit technical journal.  We
aren't into politics, info-hoarding, or any of that rot.  We are into learning.
Since the demoralization of the underground there has been a rash of inform-
ation hoarding and a b;atant disregard of hacker ethics -- this must stop if
the underground is to survive.  Our groups, Bellcore and Xtension, are almost
misplaced in this day and age of the underground.  We believe not in politics
and images as do other groups, but rather in learning and sharing of knowledge.
You may or may not have heard of our groups, but that is irrelevant.  You see,
we don't call many boards any more.  It churns our stomachs seeing what has
become.  TCSB is our way of emphasizing our beliefs and our solution to the
problem.  Hopefully the information provided in this and future issues of TCSB
will prompt new happenings in the computer underworld.  We can only hope.

   TCSB is currently a fairly "closed" publication.  The articles are brought
to you from the combined efforts of the members of Bellcore and Xtension.  But
we are not arrogant people.  We will accept contributions as long as they are
in character with the general style and format of TCSB.  But you must contact
either Doctor Cypher or Necrovore, and, as said previously, that can be poten-
tially difficult.  But good luck.  Also, TCSB is not on any sort of regular
release schedule (such as other hacker mags are).  We feel that if we begin to
place deadlines on our releases then we will be stressed and will resort to
releasing any file.  That, in the end, affects the quality of the information
and we want all information released in TCSB to be of the highest caliber
possible.  As such, the next issue of TCSB will be released when enough good
files have been written.  Hey, it makes sense to us.

Enough of all this.  In this issue you will find:
