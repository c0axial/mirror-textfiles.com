1994-02-02      Purpose of the mini-Journal (*)

The mini-Journal of Irreproducible Results publishes news about overly
stimulating research and ideas. Specifically:

A) Haphazardly selected superficial (but advanced!) extracts of research
news and satire from the Journal of Irreproducible Results (JIR).

B) News about the annual Ig Nobel Prize ceremony. Ig Nobel Prizes honor
"achievements that cannot or should not be reproduced." A public
ceremony is held at MIT, in Cambridge Massachusetts, every autumn. The
ceremony is sponsored jointly by JIR and by the MIT Museum.

C) News about other science humor activities conducted by the MIT Museum
and JIR.

------------------------------------------------------------
1994-02-03      Historic Abstracts from JIR, vol. 3, 1956

        [JIR itself is published bi-monthly.
        In months between issues, this section of mini-JIR will contain
        historic abstracts from the JIR archives.]

Volume 3 (1956) of JIR is devoted primarily to zippers.

In the lead article, the zipper is defined as a fastening device
consisting of two flexible strands engaging and disengaging by means of
a sliding cam pulled between them. The zipper was invented in 1891 by
Whitcomb J. Judson (because he became fed up with lacing his shoes and
his wife's corset). After 12 years of toiling to make the device by
hand, he enlisted the help of a Swedish engineer, Gideon Sundback, and
by 1912 they devised the product as we know it today.

The second article is Harry J. Zipkin s "Theoretical Zipperdynamics"
Zipkin first discusses "Zipperbewegiung" of quantum theoretical nature
with no clear resolution of the problem. A semi-infinite zipper, based
on the Schroedzipper equation, is then described, the construction of
which was impossible because of the semi-infinite budget required.

The finite zipper, which, too, is based on the Schroedzipper equation,
presents other problems. These are discussed by Azo-KOHN in the article
"Applications and Complications of Zippery Mechanisms". The following
facts are described:
1. Production of finite zippers is connected with accumulation of Au and
Ag;
2. Concentrated sulfuric acid seriously disturbs the potential activity
of the zipper;
3. The introduction of the plastic zipper is beneficial for forgetful
surgeons: they can use it for closing abdominal postoperative wounds;
4. Electronically operated remote control zippers can be installed on
the oral apertures of talkative spouses;
5. A clear connection exists between the hybridization mechanisms of DNA
and the function of zippers.

Volume 3 also contains an article on "Grading Systems of Scientific
Workers" by D. Rougge. Several systems are evaluated:
1. Idea grading: based on IPM (ideas per minute). It works quite well
for scientists employing many graduate or postgrad students.
2. Execution grading: based on projects - no matter whether original or
not. The important factor is the number of publications or patents.
3. Disagreeable grading : Certain activities (administration of a
department, planning of laboratories, organization of conferences,
inspection of laboratories) seem to be quite disagreeable to scientists.
Promotions can be keyed to the performance of these disagreeable jobs.
4. Public relations: Grading depends on scientists ability to convince
potential investors to part with their money

H. J. Lipkin contributes another non-zipper related article. "The story
of Chanukah" discusses:
1. The view of Sceptics and Antisceptics.
2. The Scottish origin of McAbies.
3. The problem of why potato latkes (in Europe) and doughnuts (in the
USA) are associated with Chanukah.

1994-02-04      WARNING: Perfume as Biohazard

A special announcement from
        William Lipscomb, 1976 Nobel Laureate, chemistry
        Chemistry Department
        Harvard University

[Professor Lipscomb first presented this speech at the Ig Nobel Prize
Ceremony held last October at MIT]

                                        * * *
The international science community is worried about the future of the
earth's environment. The uncontrolled release of perfume into the
atmosphere constitutes a major biohazard.

Please -- after you have read a magazine, don't throw your smelly scent
strips in the trash. Recycle them.

At our recycling center in Cambridge, Massachusetts, we now have
separate bins for glass, for plastic, for metal, and for scent strips.
If your town doesn't recycle scent strips, please do the next best thing
-- stick your scent strips in an envelope and mail them back to the
magazine.

Thank you.
                                        * * *

CALL FOR NOMINATIONS for the 1994 Ig Nobel Prizes. Ig Nobel Prizes are
awarded for achievements that cannot or should not be reproduced.

CALL FOR PAPERS on the topic: "The Theory of Redundancy Theory."  Please
submit research results only, not speculative essays, please.

CALL FOR ESSAYS for JIR's "Worst Science Teacher Competition."
Essays must be 300 words or less, explaining how and why, despite the
competition, your nominee is the world's worst science teacher. Please
enclose any photographs, diagrams, or other evidence that might bolster
your case. All entries become the property of JIR. The winning essayist
and the worst teacher will both be invited to attend the 1994 Ig Nobel
Prize Ceremony at their own expense. [A stilted note for incurably
serious readers: the underlying purpose of this competition is to
publicize the importance of GOOD science teachers!]
