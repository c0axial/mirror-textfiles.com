IA. şIntrosuction by Necrosş
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Welp, I'd like to make a few points here. First, Mad Arab gos on
these rants at the beginning and end of the phile and I would like to 
point out that these are views expressed solely by Mad Arab, and DO NOT
reflect the views of Necros, or any other member of DaS. I will also have
you know that I edited some of Mad Arab's phile, but only the parts on the
actual hacking of Renegade. I did this because some of the file was 
unclear, or needed to be cleaned up a bit. None of the rants were edited.
        We have a new writer, his name is Whiz. Whiz is a internet/telenet 
specialist, and his first article should be DAS-008.
        We have gained another distrobution site, bringing the total to 4. 
Against the Grain, stationed in 215, is a good board. The sysop is SNoG. 
Give 'em a ring at: 215/736-8998.
        And one last thing. I have heard about trouble connecting to EoD,
and that you will get a FAX machine if you call, so from now until further
notice, EoD has been taken OFF the DaS Distrobution Site list. 


II. ş In the Ho ş
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Welp, I am finally writing my first iussue for DaS!  Ohh.. <G>  I'm sure 
you care a whole lot! :>  Before I get to the article, I'd like to say a 
word on Nirvana's late Kurt Cobain, GOOD!  Before he blew himself away 
Nirvana was just some break through punk band from the spawning Seattle, 
after he deep throated some nice buck shot, Nirvanna is this reall great 
band. And all their albums are the coolest thing, and everyone should buy 
them and sit and smoking pot while listening to them (That's the only way 
you will enjoy them!).  Before Kurt just just some rock star druggie lamer, 
and now that he is in the freezer he is "this generations John Lennon" and 
this really great rock god, who had to much potential, and was the nicest 
person in the world, BULLSHIT!  Has anyone listened to "In Utero" lately?
It SUCKS!  Half the guitar riffs just ooze together and you can't
tell one from the other.  So, in essense, I'm glad the schmuck shot 
himself, Nirvanna sucks, and all the fans should quit crying!

        Ok, Anyway... As every person who has even seen a H/P file knows
there are litterally hundreds of files on "hack" BBS prog's like TAG, 
Renegade, Telegard, ViSiON/2, Etc. and they all basicly say the same god 
damn thing!  How many times have you downloaded a file thinking "Wow, this 
is gonna be the coolest file known to man?  I'm gonna hack EVERYONE'S 
account!"?  Only to read it and have it say the same  exact thing every 
other file of this type states? 
IE:  "Beg, suck-up, U/l alot, and get Sysop Access"  Any idiot can do that!
Or how about the menu trick that doesn't work for Vision/2 or OBV/2?  And
how many of these files either didn't have any info on how to do what
it tells you to do, or the overly techincal (Make you think I'm smart, and 
I know everything) shit that explains these "Really easy and great way to
hack Bla Bla Bla software" only to find out it is so long and technical
that you would have to send 2 hours on-line just to try it and find out
it's a crock of shit?  Well, I'm bored of that too!!

In this issue I will explain two methods of hacking ReneGade BBS, one
of which I'm sure everyone knows, or may not know, and one which is 
actually and original idea! And because Renegade every sysop and his mother 
runs Renegade, you should have no trouble finding a Renegade board to try 
this on. Wow, what an interesting concept, originality!  Not another 
re-re-released idea which the group claims to be "100% original and his 
idea".  Ok, enough of this boring stuff...
                   
III. ş SysOp PW ş 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        How often have you been on a ReneGade or TeleGard BBS and while
chatting with the SySlop he has to do something so he asks you to hold on?
Too countless to remember?  Then you are in great shape.  This is your
perfect opptunity to grab his SysOp PW.  (*Note, This does not work on
versions of RG newer than 01/02.94*).  What you do is at the begining
of a new line type "Type Renegade.dat" or the name of the .DAT file for
TG.  If that does not work than you will have to put in the path also.
Common BBS Dir's are: TeleGard, ReneGade, BBS, or Board.  Then make sure you
you use "/CLS" to clear the screen.  This method is old, and most know it,
but I figured I'd review it anyway.  I cannot remember how many times
I have been on a system and the Sysop did something quick, and forgot to
take away my temp Sysop access, and with the PW, I could have been home
free.

IV. ş User PW'sş
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a brand new method of hacking out a users PW and it ONLY works with
the newest version of ReneGade (Verson 01/02/94 or later).  With the many
changes in the newest RG update, there are also some hidden flaws, and 
HUGE backdoors.  It used to be if you used a MCI code in a message like say
@A, the person reading the message would have his peice of info up for that
MCI code, whatever it stood for, be it, PW, Fon #, Handle, Time, Etc.  
And each user that read the messy with that MCI code in it would have his
info there, so the MCI codes seemed useless.  If a user got duped into
thinking his info was really there he could reply to a message and on the
numbered lines to pick to quote instead of the info being there, the
MCI code was there.  So he could tell he had MCI in his eye.  Then he would
quote it and it would go back to being the info. for who ever is reading
it.  Well, NO MORE!  Cott Lang really fucked up this time!!!  Now, a user
can put %UN and the reader would have his handle there, and he would reply,
and in the quote selection instead of being the MCI code, like it used to
be, it would still be the users info.  And when that quoted material
went back into the messy it was STILL the users info.  During that quoting
stage, it changed from a MCI into the users INFO!  And that was the way it
stayed, in the quoted section the info was the same for EVERYONE.

        That's one of the biggest and REAL backdoors around. I'm sure it 
will be out by next update.  BTW: The idiot when reading the messy will 
still think it is a MCI because to HIM it will look the same as MCI always 
did, but the other users know differently.  Heres what you do:

1: Call a lame RG BBS. (NOT a HPAV BBS!  Why would you hack a Hack BBS?!?)
2: Pretend you are a big hacker, you are, but, pretend. And post a messy
    saying how you hacked so and so's account, use MCI here, and post
    the PW and Fon # and all.
3: If the person is stupid enough he will quote it and blammo, it is then
    HIS info.  Alot of lamers fall for this.
4:  Then, you read the new messys, and there it is, his info just sitting
        there saying "Hack me, Hack Me!"  Be sure to log on the geeks
        account ASAP so some one else doesn't grab it on you first!! And
        change the PW.

There it is enjoy.  Also, if it doesn't work, try it one different Bases.
And delete the message that didn't work.  Unfortuneitly there is no MCI
for the SysOp PW, but hey, you can't have everything! :>  I will include
the MCI codes at the end of this file.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        It seems as tho a few months ago, everyone was jumping on the
"WaReZ D00dz" bandwagon and leeching their newest 0 day shit.  And soon    
all these people were the butt of every joke here in CyberSpace.  At that
time HPA was the "cool, non-geeky" thing to do.  Now it seems the trend is 
just the opposite.  More and more lame BBS's are popping up claiming to be
"HPAV" Etc.  And they just aren't.  The sysops don't even know what a 
Red or Beige box is for christ's sake!  And there are more and more "HPAVC" 
groups popping up then ever before.  Groups like "Hardcore Hackers"
"Vigilante" "LoTE" are invading the scene, claiming they are "tired of
the lame regurgatated texts being released".  And they go and do the same
thing and release a lame text so they can claim that they have 1 release 
per week.  STOP IT!!  This is very annoying and LAME!!  If you don't have
anything NEW to say, than keep you flap shut!

ÄÄÄ¯ Up-John!!! (With Rogain) ®ÄÄ
        Hey.  You!  Yea you.  Read this.  Yes, right now, read it, it could
save your life.  For the next 60 seconds (If it takes you longer you have
some problems) this DaS text file in co-operation with your eyes and brain
will be conducting a test.  If this were an actually a text file you would
have ran for your life.  Do not worry, this is only a test.  Ok, *anyway*
I found an update to the before mentioned backdoor in ReneGade BBS software.
What it is, the Sysop can put a security level restriction on the use of
MCI codes in the message bases.  Usually, the SySlop will have it set so
that only users with SysOp access will be able to use the MCI code feature.
Which means you can throw'em in a messy and other users can quote them,
and they will still be an MCI code.  Only users with access at or above the
set security level will the MCI codes work.  And since there are no MCI 
codes for the SySlop PW, this backdoor seems to be worthless.  But wait!
DaS and the Arab would release a huge text file with a worthless back door,
hell, we aren't like the above mentioned groups.

        Ta Da!!!  While it is possible to block the use of MCI codes in the
public messy bases, it is not, I repeat, IS NOT possible to stop MCI use
in the E-Mail!!!  With this comes a better, easier, safer hack method with
more advantages than you can shake a bloddy ax at, like the pope is in
front of you!  Now, you can pick and choose yer lamer at will, and do not
have to worry about more experienced users clueing this guy in.  No worrys
about other users grabbing the loosers account that you worked hard (HA!)
for.  Best of all, no matter what the SySlop does, this cannot be stopped.
(Unless he deletes the message.)
Use the MCI codes as you normally would have done only in E-mail.  And, if
you are lucky, you may even be able to mail the guy anonymously.  Then, he
may NEVER know who you are, so if he figures out whats going on, to bad for
him!  And when he calls back and finds his PW has been changed, alwell.

Enjoy!
