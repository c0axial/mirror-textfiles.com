Chapter 1-Introduction
Howdy for the information of the Public Enema anarchist group. This is my
first electronic publication, but not the first phile that I've written and
distributed. It's gonna be kinda' weak at first because I'm the only one
gathering information and writing articles. Hopefully, other people will join
in soon. Look for me(A. Nonomous/The Hare Krishna) on the bay area scene,
mostly east bay if you want to contribute. Well, hope you like it...

CHAPTER 2-STOP THE pEpSi CONSPIRACY!!!!!
    Caffine is in Pepsi. Caffine is a drug. Drugs are evil(so sez George). So,
by the substitution postulate(I have been paying attention in class!!!)
Pepsi=evil. Right???? So is it wrong to steal money from drug dealers??? I
didn't think so...


MATERIALS:
-A guy that's pretty skinny
-A knife
THAT'S IT!!!

    OK... First, you have to know where to look. On the bottom right side of
the machine there is a little hole. It's located above the base but below the
hinges.

€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€ <---- You're gonna want to look here...


The next step is the hardest part. Reach into the hole and reach up as far as
you can. You should feel a vinyl bag. You're going to want to pull this out.
THIS IS NOT EASY!!! Be patient. If you work long enuff, it will come. It helps
to be skinny(like me)... It might even help to use fishing hooks or some other
device to get it out easier, but I'm not sure. Once it's out, all you have to
do is chop it open. This is also not easy. My personal preference is to light
the bag on fire and melt it a little. This is also kinda' fun. There's nothing
like watching a Pepsi machine spew smoke. I know at my school I've made $110
in one night off of 2 machines without any effort at all.

    On the newer machines, that have the coolin' picture on the front, it's
super easy to get free pepsis(but I'm not sure about the money). Just open the
flap that the cans come out of and feel around. Usually there are a couple of
six packs there for storage. Pull them out of the plastic rings and you're set.

    Now, you may ask, doesn't this sound too good to be true??? IT'S ALL
TRUE!!! That's the incredible part. BTW-This techniche doesn't work on the
older machines, just the ones with bubbled fronts and/or chillin' pictures on
the front.

*NOTE* THIS MAY NOT WORK ON SOME MACHINES! YOU HAVE TO LOOK AROUND FOR ONES
THAT WILL WORK...

CHAPTER 3-FREE SPORTS PAPER
    Why you would want this piece of shit paper is beyond me, but hey, for
free, why not??? For those of you that have NO idea what I'm talking about,
the NATIONAL is a weekly sports newspaper that's distrubed by way of newspaper
boxes. These boxes can be found out front of convience stores, BART stations,
supermarkets, and on various street corners. Anyway, if you look under the
box, you'll find a little slit. Reach in a pull out a paper. It's really that
easy. Free papers in seconds!!!

*NOTE* THIS ALSO MAY WORK ON OTHER NEWSPAPER VENDING MACHINES! I'VE NOTICED
THAT THE LA TIMES HAS THE SAME SET UP...

CHAPTER 4-FREE PHONE CALLS FROM LONG'S DRUGS
    This is an easy/stoopid way of calling people for free from the Payfones
outside Long's drugs. It may or may not work on other
independently-owned(ie:non PacBell) payfones. It's easy... Just call a 1-800
number, tell them you got the wrong number, and wait for them to hang up.
After a short period of time, you will get a dial tone again. PRESTO! Call
away! If it doesn't work, then sorry, no free call.... bummer dude. It's
always worked for me though...


CHAPTER 5-SODOMY BOXING
    OK, I know this sounds wierd at first, but I couldn't think of a better
name. It's to "GET THE PHONE COMPANY UP THE BUTT!!!!"... It's actually a super
easy way to get free calls from Northern California(or at least my area)...
Ok, what it is is very simple...
    When PacBell adds another line, they put a grey box somewhere on the side
of your house. Open this box(with a screwdriver) and "PRAISE 'BOB'!!!!" it's a
phone jack. Everythings provided for... All you need is your own phone and off
you go!!! This is great for calling 976/900 numbers and calling phriends
that're FAR, FAR away. You could even bring a laptop along if you felt like
it...

*NOTE* DON'T DO THIS ON YOUR OWN HOUSE!!!!(DUH...)

CHAPTER 6-CONCLUSION
    Welp, I hope you like this issue of the Public Enema Electronic 'Zine...
I was originally going to put a picture of J.R. 'BoB' Dobbs in here, but it
didn't fit...Hopefully everthing else came out ok... SEEYA!!!
