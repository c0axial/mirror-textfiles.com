Operation Sundevil: What was it?
        by Shredder

        Operation SunDevil, a legendary event in computer history. But what
was it and what were the results of it?
        On May 9, 1990, the U.S. Attorney's in Phoenix, Arizona released to
the press an announcement of a crackdown on "illegal computer hacking
activities". The official name for this action was "Operation SunDevil",
named after the mascot of Arizona State University, where this case started.
        Twenty seven search warrants were used on May 8, 1990, resulting
in four arrests, with 150 Secret Service Agents carrying out the operation.
Operation SunDevil was an effort to arrest several hackers to posting stolen
credit card codes and telephone calling card codes. The targets for this 
crackdown had been selected through a detailed two year investigation. Forty
two computer systems were seized by the US secret service, and about twenty
five of them were actually running bulletin boards. During 1990, the 
Phoenix branch of the Secret Service had close to 300 BBS's that were
under observation, and all of them had been either called by Secret Service 
agents or by informers, who passed logs of their sessions on to the Secret
Service. The four people who were arrested were: "Tony the Trashman" in
Tucson, AZ on May 9th, "Dr. Ripco", sysop of the Ripco BBS, was also
arrested, on illegal firearms possessions however. Also arrested were
"Electra", in PA, and an unnamed male juvenile hacker in PA. 
        Along with the forty or so computers taken, the Secret Service also
took approximately 23,000 disks, and unknown quantities of printed material,
computer printouts, magazines, notebooks, diaries, non-fiction books on
hacking, and anything else that caught the Feds' eye.
        The Secret Service claimed in a press conference on May 9, 1990, that
the primary purpose of Operation SunDevil was to send a message to the  
hacking community, that they could not hide behind the "relative anonymity
of their computer terminals.", and that the Feds could and would bust them.
They said that this bust "should convey a message to any computer enthusiast
whose interests exceed the ethical use of computers." But who is to decide
what are the so-called "ethical uses" of computers?
        The outcome of Operation SunDevil was a let down for the Feds. They
had sent their "message", but only one indictment was served as a result
of the arrests. Prosecutors involved in the case say chances are "extremely
high" that all charges will be dropped. In the end, this two year, expensive
operation resulted in not much of a real prize for the Feds, and shows
that even if you do get arrested, the Feds don't really have much of a 
case against you, even if they do take all your stuff.

                        CALLS TRACED TO COMPUTER HACKERS
                        By Shannon Strybel
 
A two month spate os constant hang-up calls has been linked to a group of 
school-age computer hackers, according to Concord Police LT. Leonard 
Wetherbee.
        Wetherbee says that a group of computer aficionados, ranging from 
elementary school children to high schoolers, are probably responsible 
for a great majority of hang-up calls received by residents throughout 
town.
        So far three teens have been identified, but in their ongoing 
investigation police suspect a much larger group of students is 
involved.Because they are juveniles, police cannot legally reveal their 
names.
        The lieutenant says the station has been flooded with reports 
from residents saying they've received calls at all hours, and at regular 
intervals since December.
        "What these kids are trying to do is to find other computer 
systems and see if they can break into them. They think it's a great 
challenge."
        The kids set up their computer telephone modem to automatically 
dial hundreds of phone numbers until it finds another computer system. 
They put in a series of numbers, say from 369-000 through 369-1000, and 
the computer dials each number," explained Wetherbee. "As soon as a human 
voice picks up, it hangs up because it is not a computer."
        Wetherbee says he has received reports from companies in Concord 
who 's computer systems have been breached, but because the investigation 
is on going, he declined to state which companies. According to the 
lieutenant, many companies have systems which notify them through a print 
out when there has been an attempted or a successful break into their 
computers
        Inspector Paul Malone says he has identified three of he alleged 
computer hackers by tracing who owned the computer technology and 
expertise to try to break into computer systems.
        "I have spoken with the three, who are in high school, and 
explained that what they are trying to do is wrong and has serious 
ramifications punishable by law." says Macone "I told them that they are 
right on the edge. Iis as if they are walking around a building and 
trying to break in."
 
        Anyone charged with making annoying phone calls, a misdemeanor, 
can receive a fine of up to $500 an up to 90 days in jail. Police say 
someone who breaches a computer system can be charged with a variety of 
misdemeanors and felonies, from malicious destruction to larceny, 
depending on information gleaned and how that information is used. 
        The inspector says he is not sure how many juveniles are 
involved, but he suspects they range in age from elementary school 
students to th high school level. In addition he says the numbers could 
have been given out to any number of other computer hackers in the 
Greater Boston area.
        "There are clubs of these hackers who meet regularly throughout 
the state and exchange modem numbers so they can practice. Because of the 
information we have, we believe there is as unknown larger group with the 
concord numbers."
        Maura Roberts, who teaches a computer workshop as Concord 
Carlisle High School, says hacking is a challenge for many students.
        "Kids today start it [learning how to use computers] so young and 
they are more sophisticated in their approach to computers because they 
have no fear. It becomes a challenge to find out what else they can do 
with it."
        Roberts speculates younger children probably do not realize 
trying to break into other systems is wrong, but look at it as a game.
        "For older kids, part of the challenge may be that it is wrong."
