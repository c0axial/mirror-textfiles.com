       Issue #1.00 - Command Guide to the MPE/iX Operating System

12-1-92 - e'Zine! Birthday. Next year I want a cake!

Author: Hewlett-Packard and their nice help facility, along with
a little of my own MPE/iX knowledge. No dictionary, bad spelling.
I need Microsoft Word or something that checks spelling.

Intro...
With no more VaS, something has to take over! Well, here is
The DraiN e'Zine!, the first one, but what the hell, if you don't
like it, you don't have to read it! Remember, this is not a
newsletter, not a digest, not some lame 2 issue crap. This is
The DraiN e'Zine!... What's an e'Zine? Well I guess Electronic
Magazine. No pages though. If this is useful at all, print it
out and keep it for the next system you fuck your way into.


"If you haven't bashed a gay yesterday, DO IT TODAY!"


Hacking it:

MPE/iX Common/Default Accounts (Since MPE/iX is not a well known OS,
espically not as well known, as, say, VAX, it still has stupid
operators who leave in default accounts. Here they are.)

Format for login is: HELLO [SESSION] <USER.ACCOUNT,GROUP>

Users:
MGR MGT MAIL FIELD
User default passwords: MGR, FLD

Accounts:
SUPPORT     HPOFFICE
RJE         SUPPORT
TELESUP
Account default passwords: HPONLY, OFFICE

Groups:
PUB HPONLY HP3 HPP187 HPP198 HPP186
Group default passwords: PUB, HPONLY

So try stuff like MAIL.TELESUP,PUB and MGT.SUPPORT,PUB something will work!

Most MPE/iX will greet you with : as your system prompt, also as your
login. So, to login as MGR.SUPPORT, type (at the login thinge prompt)

HELLO MGR.SUPPORT,PUB

Which will login you under group PUB. You can try different groups.

The bad part about this system is that ANY field can be passworded,
and to tell the fields, MGR.HPOFFICE, MGR is the USER, HPOFFICE is the
account.

One place that runs MPE/iX is Westinghouse, wec.com on Internet and
422xxx on Sprintnet. Most 422xxx hosts I've found are Westinghouse.
(For those of you who are still in the dark, Telenet and Sprintnet
are the same thing!)

Tip: There is a Internet-Sprintnet gateway! Telnet to:
hermes.merit.edu
and at the Which Host? type Sprintnet-<host#>
It is Merit (yuch) but it works if you don't want to make another
call to your local Sprintnet PAD.

Sample login:

Well, I was going to have a sample login, but since the gateway
system I used to get to my MPE/iX system was abused by other
nerds who kept using the outdial, its gone. So I can't access
the HP 3000. Oh well, there's lots more out there!!

The real stuff:

Native Mode Commands

These commands operate in Native Mode in the MPE/iX operating system.

In the Help Facility, they are denoted by the notation (NM).

                      Compatibility Mode Commands

The following commands were part of the MPE V/E operating system.  Their
functionality has been enhanced in the MPE/iX operating system.

In the Help Facility, they are denoted by the notation (CM).

These commands are not supported in MPE/iX.  Almost all of them are
concerned with optimizing the performance of the system.  These
optimizing functions now reside in the background of the MPE/iX system.

                              SYNTAX RULE:
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
:::::::::::::::::  The old MPE-V/E syntax (shown in   ::::::::::::::::::
:::::::::::::::::  the syntax diagrams) always works  ::::::::::::::::::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

           The MPE-V/E syntax conventions are maintained
           throughout the Help Facility for consistency.  You
           may use the MPE-V/E syntax convention for and
           command:  NM, CM, or UNCHANGED.

           But you may use the more flexible syntax for any NM
           command except :SETVAR.  Suppose that the NM
           :CMDNAME command has the following syntax:

:CMDNAME KEYWORD1 = value1; KEYWORD2 = value2;... KEYWORDn = valueN

           Because it is a NM command, you may choose how you
           enter the command at the keyboard or in a job stream.

           For the NM command :CMDNAME, the following forms of
           entry are valid:

:CMDNAME KEYWORD1 = a; KEYWORD2 = b... ;KEYWORDn = n

:CMDNAME a, b,... ,n

:CMDNAME a, b; KEYWORD7 = g; KEYWORD4 = d ;KEYWORD3 = c

The order relationship between parameters is still important: positional
parameters must come before keyword parameters, as they did in MPE-V/E.
This is true for all commands, NM, CM, or UNCHANGED.  Because this order
relationship is enforced, the following attempt to enter positional
parameters after a keyword parameter will produce an error:

:CMDNAME a, b;KEYWORD7 = g, h

Introducing a keyword variable (delimited with a semi-colon)
terminates positional assignment.  The positional "h" produces an error.

    The online documentation for the :EXIT command causes a problem.

           The word "EXIT" is reserved in the Help facility.

    As a result, attempting to access the EXIT text from within the
    Help Facility ">EXIT<RETURN>" fails.  You may call up the :EOJ
    command ">EOJ<RETURN> and then use <RETURN> to "page" forward
    to the EXIT command text.

    * OR *

    You may invoke the Help Facility and the text for EXIT at the
    system prompt this way -- "HELP EXIT <RETURN>".

    This "direct" access to the Help Facility gives you the text
    specified and then returns to you to the system prompt.

OPERATION

     After you suspend a program or MPE/iX command operation by
     pressing [Break], the ABORT command terminates that program
     or operation.  Programs do not terminate while critical
     system code is executing on their behalf, but will terminate
     immediately following execution of that code.  The ABORT
     command is available only from a session and only during
     BREAK, but it does not disrupt the session.  Some operations
     abort immediately upon entering BREAK without requiring the
     ABORT command.  An ABORT command results in the Job
     Control Word (JCW) being set to the SYSTEM 0 state.  For a
     discussion of Job Control Words, refer SETJCW.

     This command may be issued from a session (in BREAK only).
     It is not executable from a job or a program.  Pressing
     [Break] has no effect on this command.
