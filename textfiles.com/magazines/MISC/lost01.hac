    N.A.S.T.Y. - National Alliance of Superior Technological Youth, is a group
which I founded a few months after the SUNDEVIL raids.

    N.A.S.T.Y.'s purpose is to educate the future hackers, to try and do what
most say is impossible, which is to make the hack/phreak world into what it
used to be.
                  [THE RENEGADE BOZO STEPS UP TO THE MIKE]

    There was a time when there where hundreds of hack/phreak BBS'es, there
were text files being written on a regular basis.  Now there are less than
10 truly hack/phreak BBS'es, and NO real text files being written.

    There was a time when people did not have to worry about having their
boards taken down, their equipment seized and their rights violated.  This was
a time when the First Amendment was more than mere words and writing a text
file was a fundamental American right!  [WHO _IS_ THIS GUY ANYWAY!? MORE
IMPORTANTLY.. WHO DOES HE _THINK_ HE IS!?!?]

    We will help anyone who wishes to run a hack/phreak board.[HELL, I'LL
    HELP ANYONE WHO WANTS TO TELL THESE GUYS HOW TO WRITE A TEXT FILE]
Simply call N.A.S.T.Y.'s contact board, The Realm of Chaos at 516-466-8259
and mail number 13 mail with:

The boards name
The boards number
All new user login passwords

I or another member will call [OH JOY] and we will discuss possibilities
for assisting your BBS.

Remember, a hacker is not merely some geek behind a computer[LOOK IN A MIRROR
BUDDY]he's a person dedicated to a certain way of life!A hacker is an explorer
whoseeks truth without worrying of the consequences of his actions. Since the
dawn of man, the spirit of hacking has existed; from the first man with fire,
to Christopher Columbus, [ARE YOU GUYS FOLLOWING THIS?! WHAT THE HELL IS HE
BABBLING ABOUT] to the first man to walk on the moon. Those captured the true
spirit of hacking, for if man would have blindly follow [YAWN zzz]the accepted
rules such as not to attempt to go explore the world because it was flat, or
not to attempt to go to the moon, were would we be today?  Hackers have always
valiantly faced opposition, oppression and condemnation; it's nothing new.

Introduction:


Have you ever gotten into a VAX/VMS [SPARE ME THE LENGTHY INTRO] system and
you go roaming around only to have the System Operator turns around and kick
-ing you off,or change the password to the account that you had?  If so, this
article will help you elude the System Operator while you explore the system
to its fullest.

    First, we are not going to create any new accounts because the System
Operator will more than likely notice new accounts appearing on the system.
One way to keep an account(s) on the system is to scan through the
'SYSUAF.DAT' for disabled accounts and revive them.  The only bad part about
this is that you must have an account that has system privileges in order
to access the UAF file.  If your account happens to have those privileges
then do the following:[I WONDER WHERE HE STOLE THIS FROM, PULL OUT YOUR
                       PHRACKS GUYS]
"$ Set Def Sys$System <CR>"

    This will take you to the System area of the hard disk.  In this area all
files that the system needs to run itself are stored here.  In this directory
you will need to run the 'Authorize' utility, by typing the following:

"$ run authorize"

You will be prompted with:

"UAF>"

    In this area you can request help on all 'Authorize' commands but this
file will explain most of the fields in a UAF record and how to modify it to
your
needs.

    The first thing you need to do is list all of the users in the
'SYSUAF.DAT' file.  At the UAF prompt type the following:

"UAF> List/Full"

    This will create a file with a full report of all the information
contained within the UAF as follows:

            %UAF-I=LSTMSG1, writing listing file
            %UAF-I-LSTMSG2, Listing file SYSUAF.LIS complete

    Next type "exit" to get out of the 'Authorize' utility, and either
download or otherwise capture all of the accounts out of the file called
'SYSUAF.LIS'.  After you have done this, scan through the list for people who
are 'DISUSERS'.  If you are lazy then use the help command for more
information on the 'search' command.  This is not recommended because, if
accounting is on, chances are more than likely that the System Operator will
notice the 'search' command.


    After you have found several disabled accounts, execute the 'Authorize'
utility again.  To list the disabled user you wish to modify type:

"show <username>"

    This will show the user.

    The following is an example of a UAF field for a user:

Username: JOHN                            Owner:  SYSTEM MANAGER
Account:  SYSTEM                          UIC:    [700,101] ([SYSTEM,DUDE])

Authorized Privileges:
  TMPMBX NETMBX
Default Privileges:
  TMPMBX NETMBX

    Most users on the system only have 'TMPMBX' (temporary mailbox) and
'NETMBX' (network mailbox) privileges.  Do the following to enable your new
user to have its own system privileges:

  UAF>Modify <user> /FLAGS=NoDisUser    <--Changes to enabled user
  UAF>Modify <user> /FLAGS=NOCAPTIVE    <--Makes sure user is not in a shell
  UAF>Modify <user> /FLAGS=NOAUDIT      <--Turns off Auditing features
  UAF>Modify <user> /PRIVILEGES=ALL     <--Grants all privileges
  UAF>Modify <user> /PASSWORD=newpasswd <--changes password

    This should set your disabled account to an account with full privileges.

    I hope this file has been helpful.  Although it does not cover all the
ways of securing access on a VAX/VMS it does show one of the many.  Look
forward to more files on the VMS Operating System.

Parameter  Description
---------  -----------

    0      National Options Marker

           This parameter serves to mark the division between International
           (X.3) parameters and Network Dependent (e.g., Telenet) parameters
           in an X.28 or X.29 parameters list.  All parameters preceding the
           marker are X.3, and those following are Network Dependent.  Values
           may be:

           0  CCITT specified value
           33  Telenet permitted value

           Telenet accepts either value.  Whenever possible, the CCITT
           specified value of zero should be used.

    1      Escape to Command Level

           This parameter allows the terminal to initiate an escape from Data
           Transfer Mode, in order to send a command to the PAD. Values are:

            0  Escape not possible
            1  Escape possible (default)

    2      Echo
                [YAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWNNNNNNN]
           This parameter provides for all characters received from the
           terminal to be transmitted back to the terminal, as well as being
           interpreted and forwarded by the PAD to the remote DTE.
           Values are:

           0  No echo
           1  Echo (default)

    3      Data Forwarding

           This parameter allows the PAD to recognize defined character(s)
           received from the terminal as an indication to complete assembly
           of characters to forward a DATA packet to the remote DTE.  Values
           may be OR-ed together (e.g., value of 3=1+2=Alphanumerics plus
           Carriage Return)

           0  No signal              [zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz]
           1  Alphanumerics
           2  Carriage Return (Default)
           4  Escape
           8  Editing Characters
           16  Terminators
           32  Form Effectors
           64  Control Characters
           128  Other Characters (Not valid according to CCITT
                recommendations)

    4      Idle Timer

           Should the interval between successive characters received from
           the terminal exceed the selected Idle Timer delay, the PAD will
           terminate assembly of characters and forward a DATA packet to the
           remote DTE.  Values are:

           0  Timer disabled
           n  multiples of 50 ms. (.05 seconds), where 1<=n<=255.  n=1
           n=1 and n=2 not recommended.  (Default is 80, 4 seconds)

    5      Auxiliary Device Control

           This parameter enables flow control between the PAD and the
           terminal.  The PAD uses the XON and XOFF characters (decimal 17
           and 19) to indicate to the terminal whether or not it is ready to
           accept characters.  Values are:

           0  No use if XON/XOFF (default)
           1  Use XON/XOFF

    6      Suppression of Service Signals

           This parameter provides for the suppression of all messages sent by
           the PAD to the terminal.  Values are:

           0  Signals not transmitted (messages not sent)
           1  Signals transmitted (messages sent) (Default)

    7      Break Options          [SNORE]

           This parameter specifies the action taken on receipt of a Break
           signal from the terminal.  The only valid values are:

           0  Do nothing (Default)
           1  Send INTERRUPT Packet to Host
           2  Send RESET Packet to Host
           8  Escape to PAD Command Stat
           21  Flush-on-Break (Discard Output, Send Indication of Break
               and Send INTERRUPT)

    8      Discard Output

           This controls transmission of data to the terminal.  Values are:

           0  Normal data delivery to the terminal (Default)
           1  Discard all output to the terminal

    9      Carriage Return Padding   [WHEN IS THIS THING GONNA END]

           This parameter provides for automatic insertion by the PAD of null
           character padding after the transmission of a carriage return to
           the terminal.  Values are:

           0  No padding
           1-31  Number of character delays

   10      Line Folding

           This provides for automatic insertion by the PAD of appropriate
           format effectors to prevent overprinting at the end of a terminal
           print line.  Values are:

           0  No line folding
           n  Character per line before folding, where 1<=n<=255

   11      Binary Speed

           This parameter is set by the PAD when the terminal establishes a
           physical connection to the network.  This allows the remote DTE
           or terminal user to examine the speed, as determined by the PAD.
           Values are:

           0    110     bps
           1    134.5
           2    300
           3    1200
           4    600
           5    75
           6    150
           7    1800
           8    200
           9    100
           10    50
           11    75/1200
           12    2400
           13    4800
           14    9600
           15    19,200
           16    48,000
           17    56,000
           18    64,000

   12      Flow Control of the PAD by the terminal

           This allows for flow control between the terminal and the PAD.
           The terminal indicates whether or not it is ready to accept
           characters from the PAD, via XON and XOFF characters.  Values
           are:

           0  No use of XON/XOFF
           1  Use XON/XOFF

   13      Linefeed Insertion

           This parameter instructs the PAD to routinely insert a linefeed
           (LF) character into the data stream following each appearance of a
           carriage return (CR) character.  Values may be OR-ed together:

           0  No LF Insertion (TP4 Default)
           1  Insert LF after CR on output to the terminal
           2  Insert LF after CR on input from the terminal
           4  Insert LF after CR on echo to the terminal

   14      Linefeed Padding

           This parameter provides for automatic insertion by the PAD of null
           character padding after the transmission of a linefeed to the
           terminal.  Values are:

           0  No padding
           1-15  null characters

   15      Editing

           This parameter enables local editing of text within the PAD before
           transmission through the network.  Note, if editing is enabled,
           transmission on timers is disabled.  Values are:

           0  Editing disabled (Default)
           1  Editing enabled

   16      Character Delete

           Parameter 16 specifies the editing character which causes the PAD
           to erase the previous character entered by the terminal.  Parameter
           16 is only valid if editing is enabled.  Default is 127.

                         TRANSLATING ORDERS INTO ACTION
                         ------------------------------

    When computers have to talk to one another, correct translation is as
important as it is at the United Nations.  This is because each machine
speaks a different language.  For both people and computer programs,
translation means taking instructions in one language or format and converting
them to another.

    Putting instructions into a particular format is a primary activity in
telephone companies. Changes in telephone services have to be put in a format
that an electronic switch and its particular computer program can understand.
This is done at the Recent Change Memory Administration Center (RCMAC).  In
these centers, translations are performed by personnel who process requests
for changes in telephone services that come from the business offices in a
variety of formats, and convert them into the languages used by the
various types of electronic switches.  As the number and type of switches
continue to grow, too much personnel time is used up.  Thousands of clerks
are involved in hundreds of centers across the United States.

    To solve this problem, the regional companies asked Bell Communications
Research (BELLCORE) for a solution:  a computer program that could take
most of the orders as they come in and translate them automatically into the
form needed by each type of switch.  The result of this request was the MIZAR
system, formerly called the Memory Management System.  As it is implemented by
clients, it will help relieve the buildup of clerical staff and make labor-
intensive operations less costly and more efficient to provide.

    Today's electronic switching systems, the result of specialized
applications of computer technology, depend on software to preform
functions like routing and completing calls.

    The MIZAR system has a template, essentially an order blank, for each
order type for each switch and version of that switch.  This is the basic
dictionary for translation:  a big matrix or array of possible messages in
each of the languages or formats used by the switches.

    When a message is passed from the Facilities Assignment and Control
System (FACS) it goes to the Work Manager, a dispatching system.  The
Work Manager provides both protocols and interfaces for the other systems,
acting as a central communications point for the MIZAR, COSMOS (COmputer
System for Mainframe OperationS) and FACS systems.  It provides priority
queueing and flow control, ensuring that the MIZAR system will not be
flooded with more messages than it can handle at one time.

    The MIZAR system then searches its memory for the appropriate template
for both the switch and the message type. It begins as a clerk would, by
filling in blanks step-by-step, automatically skipping over blanks that aren't
relevant to the particular change being processed.

    For example, one step may ask:  "Is this order two-party?"  In other words,
does it involve a change affecting two phones?  "If no, skip 20 lines and
proceed to question 41."  In this way, a template that may have 60 or 70 lines
will be filled in with only six or seven entries in many cases.  Using this
process of elimination, the MIZAR system creates the proper translation for
the service requested.

    Not all messages are translated by the MIZAR system.  For the more
complex ones, the system calls on COSMOS to generate an appropriate
translated message.  After these messages are generated, they can be called
up on a screen, where a clerk can swiftly check through them, comparing
them with the initial request and ensuring that they are complete and
accurate.  In some cases, COSMOS will be unable to generate all of the
necessary information, but the operators can easily intercept those messages
and correct them before they are sent to the switch.

    Once the orders are complete, they are sent off to a pending file
together with their activation dates.  The MIZAR system continuously scans
this file, searching for messages that need to be activated.  As it finds
them, it sends them out to the appropriate switch.  If the switch accepts
the message and completes the change, the message is then sent to a history
file for safekeeping.  This feature has prevented the loss of essential
change information when electronic switches have malfunctioned.

    If for any reason the switch rejects the order as incorrectly formatted
or otherwise in error, the change is put into a file for a clerk to review
and determine what went wrong.  The MIZAR system automatically carries out
the first two steps that previously were done manually.  It checks to verify
with the switch that the order is incorrect, and it coordinates information on
the rejected change with that on related changes to see if there are any
conflicts.

    All service orders (SERVORDS) are logged into the MIZAR system's
switch log (located in /tmp/swXX.out, where XX is the numeric code assigned
by the MIZAR system to that switch).  That is, if it was entered on the MIZAR
system.

    The MIZAR system has a number of significant benefits.  It works with
COSMOS, which reduces the amount of work that has to be done on the more
complex orders.  It also operates in four different modes:  with or without
COSMOS and with or without FACS so that the operating companies can
choose what best suits their particular memory-administration needs.

    Two other MIZAR features are notable.  All three systems, the Work
Manager, COSMOS and the MIZAR system, run on the same type of computer.
This allows fewer computers to be used for backup.  In addition,
administrative activities, such as editing messages and initializing
switches, are made easier by flexible, user friendly MIZAR programs.

    The MIZAR system was first implemented in Pacific Bell's RCMAC
in San Jose, California, in November 1985.  This system relied solely on COSMOS
for recent change messages.  A second application, the first using FACS,
occurred in Southwestern Bell's central RCMAC in St. Louis, Missouri, in
February 1986.  Today, close to a dozen clients are in the process of deploying
the MIZAR software.

    The MIZAR system will not magically eliminate staff needs in the various
RCMACS.  People will still be needed for reviewing complex orders and in some
cases completing orders that COSMOS can't handle.  But the MIZAR system can
help reduce the overall work load.

    The MIZAR system can help clients provide new services for customers.  In
many cases the customers can have "Instant Service," in which changes
entered in the service-order processor terminals are processed automatically
through FACS, COSMOS and the MIZAR system, implementing the changes at
the switch almost as soon as the order-entry process is completed.
Ultimately, new systems such as MIZAR system may help in making changes to
the phone system as swift and automatic as dialing a phone number.

                                   SAFE-SCAN
                                   ---------

A Safe-Scan inquiry automatically checks through the credit file to
determine if irregular or unusual patterns exist.  It examines the name,
address, employment history, telephone number and Social Security number
contained in each inquiry.

Safe-Scan is a "red Flag"[B-DUH] system, designed to alert you to potential
problems such as mail drop/prison/previously misused address.  And
Safe-Scan is a "living" database, one that is constantly growing through
information-gathering.

Safe-Scan is the Profiled Address warning.  By monitoring every inquiry
coming through the system, Safe-Scan warns you when, from a single
address, someone is using different names or different Social Security
numbers to apply for credit or employment.  Another is True Name Fraud,
which warns you if someone is attempting to obtain credit by stealing
real identities of innocent consumers. [THANKS FOR THAT BRILLIANT CONCLUSION]

                                    DTEC
                                    ----

DTEC is a service that allows users of Equifax to make inquiries via
     Social Security Number, simple as that.  It allows for more accurate
     inquiry entry.

                             On-Line Directory
                             -----------------
Extension: D

The On-Line Directory contains the current phone numbers of creditors
and inquiries which appear at the bottom of the credit report.

                              Connection Process
                              ------------------

Connection is established by several returns, then a <CTRL-S> to start
the login process, prompting "(CB) Please Sign-on."

The account should fit the format of:
xxxyyxx-yx or xxxyyxxxx-yx  (Y=Letter X=Number)

There are extensions that you may add on to your account to pull
different types of transactions.  The format is as such..

IDnumber,password,user,extensions.

One extension that you will always want to add on is Z.  it allows you
to view the companies name in the firm/ID section, instead of a
alpha-numeric representation.

For example, if I wanted to pull an Arcofile-Plus report with On-Line
Directory assistance I would enter my account like:

XXXYYXXXX-YX,James,DFZ.

Extensions:
D: On-Line Directory
F: Arcofile-Plus
Z: View w/names in FIRM/ID Field

After entering the account information you should receive the prompt:

A-XXX PROCEED:

The X's represent a location where the database is located.  here is a

Recently we received this note on our bulletin board (Realm Of Chaos), it
would have made us nervous if it weren't for:

1. They left a number that does not belong to MCI.
2. There is no employee listed as Ted Jahnsen at MCI.

This goes to show you just how low some people will go. Hope you get as good
a laugh from it as we did!

Hello.  My name is Ted Jahnsen and I am a representative at MCI
telecommunications in Texas.  My reason for calling you on this bulletin board
system stems from a number of unauthorized calls coming from this installation
address in the near-present and not-so distant past.  Aside from that, there
are also numerous attempts to call this system using MCI and subsidiary
long-haul lines, with illegitimate calling cards, to this system.  I have made
a note to the Fraud Control and Communications office here in Texas and they in
turn will contact your local office in New York.  NYNEX has been very
cooperative in providing us with the information we need in order to bring
charges upon you, most specifically US Code 1030 which involves wire fraud and
similar offenses.  Please note, a racketeering charge is also possible being
that you may have committed 2 or more violations in accordance with this
statute.

For some time we have also been aware of pro-hacker related activities on this
system as well.  We URGE you not to continue it unless you find it your
court.

Thanks for you time.

It has now been confirmed, DAVID LIGHTMAN (NPA 214) is a NARC.
This information was verified when he threatened a member of N.A.S.T.Y.[HAHA]
(JAMES BROWN) with calling up his friend at the Secret Service office and
giving him his full information. (Besides, wouldn't you think a guy who ran
a board called 'HACKERS' was a NARC anyway???)  After JAMES BROWN politely told
him to 'FUCK OFF' he then proceeded in calling the Secret Service.

It is a confirmed fact that Everlast (Julio Alverez NPA 305) is a narc.  He

Word is out on the upcoming raids stemming from the current investigations
involving the abuse of BT-Tymnet.  The investigation has an extremely large
number of agencies working together:  CIA, FBI, SS, Army Intelligence and
several Bell companies are rumored to be working closely with Tymnet
security to pinpoint the person(s) involved.  The focus is believed to be
on individuals in or around New York State.

New York Telephones INFO-LOOK Gateway will soon be discontinued.
Court rulings related to the breakup of AT&T prohibit NYNEX and the six
other regional Bell Operating Companies from providing their own information
services or regulating the content of the services they transport on their
networks.  The Bell operating companies are seeking to overturn these
restrictions preventing it from ensuring the quality and consistency of
services offered on INFO-LOOK.  (Censorship perhaps?)

The rumors of a new-revised Legion of Doom have been thoroughly denied by
still-surviving ex-member Erik Bloodaxe.  Bloodaxe says that he had toyed
with the idea of reforming the group with many of the still remaining active
members, with several new additions.  The group was to include:
Erik Bloodaxe, Skinny Puppy, Prime Suspect, Jester Sluggo, Phantom Phreaker,
Doom Prophet, Doc Holliday, Malefactor, Agent Steal, Epsilon, Pain Hertz,
and Parmaster.  The group was never formed due to a number of reasons.
Bloodaxe assures everyone that the Legion of Doom is gone, and any rumors to
the contrary are completely false.  Any people claiming to be in any new LOD
are liars and should not be believed.  Bloodaxe added that he wishes people
would stop 'flogging a dead horse' and lay the group to rest.
---------------[THANK YOU FOR THAT THOROUGHLY USELESS REPORT]----------------
JAMES BROWN received notice from BAGHEAD that he has been busted.  All his
notes and computer equipment were confiscated.

An as of yet unidentified hacker known as Dr. Doom is plaguing the Internet
Relay Chat (IRC) with rather childish antics.[PROBABLY A NASTY MEMBER]
on the GNU system POGO (pogo.gnu.ai.mit.edu) and is changing the system's
message of the day to read various things having to do with "the new LOD."
Because of the nature of the GNU system, and Richard Stallman's abhorrence
to computer security, system administrators refuse to investigate the
problem, but are becoming annoyed at having to continually change
/etc/motd to its original message.  Sources say that if the problem persists
GNU may rethink its open policy somewhat, since deliberate abuse of the
system's non-security defeats the nature of trust trying to be demonstrated
in having such a system.

I think that N.A.S.T.Y. needs to slow down and try to learn whats going and
figure out what people want to know about. There are about 20 CBI/TRW files
out and they are ALL more detailed than these. The other files were just
boring and useless. It's dead information and it has no use.

Suggestions for N.A.S.T.Y.:

1. Get Ace in your group to lead you
2. Tell Renegade Hacker to change his handle to Phrackmaster
3. Tell Damaged to trash himself a brain
4. Try stealing some more interesting material next time
5. Get a real name for christ, try 'OoI' Organization of Idiots
6. Much like your rumour on LoD, you should lay N.A.S.T.Y. to rest for a
   looooong time.
