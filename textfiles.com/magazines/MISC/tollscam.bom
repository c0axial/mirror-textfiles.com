        This is a very nice way to get alot of money which I noticed someone
  doing a couple years ago. It is a little dangerous so speed is of the 
  essence. Have you ever been on a Turnpike or Highway which requires you to
  stop at those little toll booths and throw in a quarter? Imagine how many 
  people drive through just one of those booths in a couple of hours. Here
  is a method for you which will allow you to get every one of those quarters
  thrown into the little basket. The first thing you must do is pick a booth.
  The booth must be an exact change booth! This scam will not work if a person
  is working in the booth. Next, study the basket where the money is thrown
  into. Watch where your quarter slides into after you throw it into the 
  basket. It is normally a relatively small hole. Now, take a cloth and block 
  up the small hole. The quarters will pile up in the basket! Nobody ever 
  stops to see if there quarter actually went in (at least not in New Jersey)
  and by the time you come back you could have a small fortune in quarters 
  waiting for you. Of course you have to work quick. It would look pretty
  strange to one of the toll attendents if they saw you trying to rig
  the cloth or removing a bunch of quarters from the basket. Also, before
  you do this you should note if there are surveilence cameras in the
  toll area. If there are then you obviously shouldn't do this. The one time
  I saw this done the basket was filled with quarters and my father removed
  the cloth causing the man who tried to pull the scam to lose everything
  so don't wait too long. Also, I have never tried this so I am not sure how
  easy it is but it seemed worth writing about. I hope you enjoyed the info.

  Closing note: Arete is now officially down for good. There is no point in
                trying to call there. It seems that lamers and just the
                overall hassle of running a BBS made him decide to close
                down. Farewell Eagle, hope to see you back in the scene 
                soon ;)
                Also, The BëM squad is still looking for sites and writers.
