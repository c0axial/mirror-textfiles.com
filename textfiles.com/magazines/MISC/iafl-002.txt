2.01     Welcome To Our Show/Editorial/Oops!
--------------------------------------------

	 Welcome back, my friends, to the 'zine that never ends.  I'm your
	 editor for this (and probably EVERY) issue, Matt Shaw, and I'd
	 like to take this opportunity to fill you in on a new
	 development:

	 We've a new contributor!  IAFL recently welcomed the Sonic Bellboy to
	 our staff.  The Sonic One's contributions to our representation of
	 hardcore/punk/non-conformism (i.e., people who just say "fuck you")
	 begin this issue.

	 Anyway.. before I get to the part where I express my opinion on a
	 chosen topic.. there was a version of IAFL #1 released in which
	 the articles were listed as being "3.01" and such.. that has been
	 corrected.

	 The New Year.. 1994.  So far, no different than any other year.
	 I lived through New Year's Eve, no problem.  I didn't go out.  Why
	 the fuck should I go out, when the only parties I knew of were
	 thrown by a couple of fucking Esprit/Gap asylum escapees?  Okay,
	 so one was cute.  But there was no alcohol there.  No chance to
	 get her inhibitions lowered, and -- never mind.  Accidentally
	 showed my carnal side, which is unusual, these days.

	 There's one thing that I hope, I pray, and will die to change this
	 year:  All these flannel-shirted motherfuckers who only started
	 wearing flannel when Nirvana hit the Top 40.. STOP MAKING TRUE
	 COUNTERCULTURE LOOK BAD.  (I hope that none of those people I
	 address are reading this publication.  Sorry for screaming, for
	 those who aren't.)  True punk or hardcore isn't a defined way of
	 dressing; it's whatever you want.  Whatever's comfortable.  Who
	 gives a shit what the girls who work at the Slurpee stand or The
	 Gap in the mall think of how you dress?  If you've got the
	 attitude that is the aura of the truly dedicated punk, you won't.
	 If you're just trying to cash in on a look that's been popularized
	 and had all meaning stripped from it by some fashion consultant
	 out in fucking Paris or wherever, you're not worth the eighty
	 dollars you shelled out for that flannel shirt.  It's like
	 pre-ripped jeans in the '80s: you have that much money to pay
	 someone else to rip your jeans, what the fuck are you doing being
	 "fashionable"?  Why the fuck weren't people like that at
	 cotillions, or whatever the hell those things are?  If you have
	 $80 to spend on a brand-name flannel shirt from some cool store in
	 the local jock/princess haven (aka "mall"), why even pretend
	 you're counterculture?  Go to a Young Republicans meeting; sweat
	 Polo; do something expected of those of your financial level.

	 The Sonic Bellboy had an anecdote that inspired this rant, and I
	 think he summed it up better than I did with this multi-page
	 thing.  Check it out:

       i saw a guy, snowboarding, with a flannel-from-stitches and
       oversized-jeans-bellbottoms with a georgetown hoyas hat at the ski place
       i was at. i asked him if he thought he was counterculture. he said yes.
       i asked him why. he said because he listens to alternative (he named
       nirvana, pearl jam and some other poser band) and that he dresses
       "different", i pointed out his jock hat. "it looks cool." there's the
       word that has stunted this generation. "cool." is that a "cool" thing to
       be? well, this guy was a perfect stereotype, and he was the first of (i
       counted) _39_ similarily dressed kemper-blorgers wearing flannel and
       likely freezing in those thin cheap jeans. well, i was warm in my black
       ugly nylon pants. i was warm in my hydro linesman jacket. i was
       protected with my 5oo glasses and my free giveaway touque. i was happy
       with my mennonite craft sale 50 cent mittens. i was warm.
       i was functional. and i was not "cool."
 
	 In closing, I'd like to say to everyone else what I said to SB:
	 Acting "cool" is difficult.  Being _cool_ is easy, if you're not a
	 fake, like the people I spent most of this editorial being pissed
	 off at, and like that one guy and his 39 clones that SB saw.
	 "Alternative" = "cool".  Hardcore/punk/underground = _cool_.  'Nuff
	 said.

	 Enjoy the mag.

2.02     The Mystery Of Barney Rubble
-------------------------------------

	 While rotting my brain watching cartoons one day, I noticed
	 something about the "Fruity Pebbles"/"Cocoa Pebbles" commercials.
	 Fred Flintstone's life's goal in these things appears to be keeping
	 Barney Rubble away from those Pebbles.

	 My question:  Why the fuck can't Barney go to the store and buy some
	 goddamn pebbles himself?

	 The Pebbles aren't manufactured by Fred (would someone as non-artistic
	 as Fred be able to design those cool boxes?), so they conceivably must
	 be sold at a store.

	 Barney _has_ a job (evidenced by his riding to work with Fred in the
	 original cartoon), so he's not too much of a lazy-ass.  Obviously
	 not.. the fool designs all these new cool ways to try and convince
	 Fred to give him the Pebbles.  Probably spends more money on these
	 fucking ideas than it would cost for a lousy fucking box of cereal.

	 My point is that it's pretty goddamn stupid for Barney Rubble not to
	 make it easier on all involved, and just go shell out a couple of
	 fucking dollars for some Pebbles.  Do I make sense on this one?

----------------------------------------------------
2.03     doc martens, the mafia, and paul westerberg
----------------------------------------------------

	 have you seen the good old docs these days? they are TRASH... a
	 pair used to last a good 3 years without falling apart, but
	 these -  give it two months of average wear, and they fall apart.
	 and look at the gaudy colors - Cheri Red, Paul Westerberg Green,
	 Blueberry Blue, Puke Yellow, FlannelFuck Plaid, Uma Thurman Pink,
	 the list goes on...and on...and on...

	 What happened to Black 3 holes? did the mafia buy up all of the
	 black shoes? now there are sandals! and high heels! and ones with
	 patterns! and custom band-logo ones...

	 I say all of us revolt, burn (if you have them) your docs. let's
	 all buy-(shuffle in the hat) BIRKENSTOCKS! (I AM just KIDDING!)
	 WHATEVER YOU WANT TO WEAR! no more uniformity. the nice thing about
	 punk culture is that there is no "punk look" i.e. we don't all make
	 our hair look permawet like the Jockfucks, we don't wear Flannel
	 and Wool Socks.

	 Here's a scary thing- the JOCK'S idea of a punk:
	 Leather jacket with chains
	 Safety pin through the cheek
	 Doc Marten shoes
	 Lots of pierced locations
	 Colored mohawk hair
	 etc.

	 know anyone like that?

	 Or my little sister's idea:
	 (remember GEM?)
	 Female lead singer who screams like a banshee
	 Red or multi-colored hair, cut randomly.
	 leather jacket with a big fluorescent skirt
	 big belt
	 a lot of makeup
	 a "keyboard guitar"

	 Sound familiar?

2.04     "Race Traitor"
-----------------------

	 I discovered, long ago, that talking to racist "skinheads" (notice
	 the quotes; these fools just rip off true skinhead lifestyles) is an
	 exercise in fruitlessness.  That knowledge was forever cemented in my
	 mind when the following discussion took place between myself and a
	 racist "skin":

	Racist :  Do you support the white race?

	Me     :  What does that entail, exactly?

	Racist :  You must hate all non-whites, like blacks, Orientals, Jews..

	Me     :  Wait just a fucking second.. Jews?!  MOST Jews are WHITE!

	Racist :  No, they're olive-skinned.

	Me     :  Look, whatever.  I refuse to hate an entire race, just for
		  the fact that they're different from me.  Besides,
		  generalization is stupid.

	Racist : You don't hate non-whites?

	Me     : Fuck, no.  Look, what the fuck are you, deaf?

	Racist : Then you're a race traitor.

	 So.  I am now a race traitor, according to someone who shaved his head
	 in an attempt to be "cool."  Because his fellow "Aryan soldiers" did
	 it.  Non-conformism at its peak of NON-EXISTENCE.  Free thought is not
	 a concept for the majority of these people.

	 Matt Shaw, the race traitor.

	 I argue that I am NOT a race traitor.  I don't support racist
	 philosophies, so I guess I don't support the neo-Nazi concept of the
	 "white race."  They're the race traitors, just like Hitler before
	 them; they have betrayed the race that they have forfeited their right
	 to be a part of.

	 The human race.

-----------------------------
2.05     racism is pointless.
-----------------------------

	 helloooooo, people. look at yourself. are you politically correct?
	 are you anti-racist? political correctness has stunted the most
	 important movement of this century. we, the WAM, are a _minority_
	 in a global perspective. WAPM (white american punk males) are a
	 minority, so i guess most of you understand the basic minority
	 feeling. but unfortunately, when anything is politically correct,
	 people overreact. look at the enviromental movement. it's overdone.
	 it should have been left to the small, dedicated groups (another
	 minority, minorities are based on _beliefs_ not _color_) but look
	 at the system now. _minorities_ and _women_ are being given job
	 preference over an equally qualified male. that is trash. so is the
	 new "tolerance" policy. i am not a racist. i do not try to be nice
	 to a person just because they are black. or anything else. i am
	 friends with people on one and one only basis: how much like me they
	 are, _inside_. my best friend (although she lives a long ways away)
	 is chinese. my background is mixed. most of my friends are diverse.
	 i have indian friends of both varieties. i have swedish friends. i
	 have german friends, and i have canadian friends. you see, when a
	 chinese person has lived in canada/us all of his life, as well as
	 many of his previous generations, he is still called chinese. and
	 people give him a racial quality. chinese, therefore from china,
	 therefore no speako english, therefore after my job and my girlfriend.
	 sorry folks, _you_ are just as or less american/canadian then they
	 are. you are both _immigrants_ you are both _residents_ and you are
	 both _racially indifferent_, as in my eyes, we have Homosapien and
	 we have homosapien.

2.06     True Stories of High School Hell #1
--------------------------------------------

	 Ah.. memories of high school.  From freshman year to senior year,
	 I was caught up in both the miasma of passage through adolescence,
	 and the process of education.  And I know exactly how to sum those
	 years up.

	 IT WAS HELL!  IT WAS LIVING, FUCKING, SEEMINGLY ETERNAL HELL!

	 But now, I can look back, and laugh.  Laugh because I'm not there
	 anymore, and because I'm doing what I want to do while the rest of
	 those pitiful fuckers are toiling away at Hardee's and
	 bullshitting profs who just re-teach them all the grammar classes
	 we took in high school.  But I digress.  Beginning with this
	 issue, I'm going to regale our faithful readers with tales of my
	 days of suffering.  This is one I call "The Whistle of The Demon".


	 ---

	 In my sophomore year, I was faced with the grim fact that I was
	 short a couple of credits, and I got called into the
	 principal/administrator's office.  I wasn't in trouble, or
	 anything, it turns out; he simply told me I hadn't taken one
	 class that I should have.

	 I closed my eyes, hoping he wouldn't say what he inevitably would.
	 As he uttered the words "Physical education," I cringed inwardly,
	 and my mind was filled with the possible torments I could be put
	 through by the more athletic students.  These days, of course, I
	 would just beat the holy shit out of anyone trying such a thing,
	 but that's beside the point.

	 The usual phys. ed. teacher had taken two years off to go live in
	 Pennsylvania, and the school alternated replacements.  Sometimes
	 the math/algebra/etc. teacher would be in charge of the class, and
	 let the kids play basketball (hey, it IS Indiana) or dodgeball, or
	 something.  The original teacher was kind of cool; he wasn't the
	 kind of asshole gym teacher you usually find, like the ones that
	 think they're the Terminator, and just come off like a bad
	 impression of Schwarznegger.  He was, and still is, a rather nice
	 guy.  I had hoped that we would get a replacement somewhat like
	 him for our class.

	 No such luck.  We get a guy straight from the Purdue training
	 camps.  Physically resembled a bulldog, both in face, and in
	 voice.  Similar temperament, as well.

	 The first class, there we are.  Decked out in sweats and T-shirts,
	 etc.  He comes out of the supply room, and looks at us like a
	 sergeant looking over his troops.  I'm already thinking, "Oh,
	 shit.  What have we done?"  The first words out of his mouth were,
	 "I'm Mr. H.," (real name withheld, although I should have no
	 mercy) "I am your instructor in physical education for the next
	 few weeks."  Sounded just like a drill instructor.. uh-oh.

	 The next few weeks were sheer hell.  We did incremental amounts of
	 pushups every day.  He forced us to play football, but play with a
	 ferocity that would have astounded a Viking.  When he was teaching
	 us some basic basketball maneuvers, he told us to dive for the
	 ball, saying he wanted to see our blood on the floor.  He broke us
	 down and tried to rebuild us.  He singled out the weak and made an
	 example of them.  It was like the first part of "Full Metal
	 Jacket", only we could go home and complain to each other every
	 day.

	 For my part, I was so broken down, I did everything he said.  I
	 kept myself in the shadows; he knew me by name only.  When he told
	 us to dive for the basketball and get some blood on the floor, I
	 goddamn wanted to see my blood on the floor, I was that broken
	 down.  I began to be scared of how seriously intent I was on being
	 a good soldier.  We began to call him "Coach".  To this day, I
	 would rather call him "Dead And In Hell" than "Coach".  As for
	 that, I can only hope.

	 Soon, though, hell's omnipresent flames receded from roasting our
	 backs.  In other words, the motherfucker left.  His last day, he
	 shook our hands and talked to us like we were his equal.  Although
	 then I didn't have half the sheer balls I have now, I had the guts
	 to glare at him and remain silent when he said goodbye to me.

	 The next week, the math teacher took over the class, and let me
	 tell you.. he was a welcome sight compared to the fucking maniac
	 we had called "Coach".

	 ---

	 Okay.. that's all for this one.  I have a million of these, I'll
	 keep 'em coming.

          still in hell.  Please send your sympathies his way. - ed.]

2.06     Ethics Quiz
--------------------

	 I'm sure you've seen those stupid ethics quizzes, like the ones
	 that ask, "Susie steals a rubber band from the supply closet.  Is
	 this ethical, unethical, or a crime?"  We at IAFL make fun of
	 things that piss us off, so here goes:

	 1. The Trix rabbit constantly attempts to deceive children in
	    order to get some Trix.  Is this:

	    a) ethical;
	    b) unethical; or
	    c) a clever marketing gambit?

	 2. Tom the cat always chases Jerry the mouse, for no apparent
	    reason except pure meanness.  Is this:

	    a) ethical;
	    b) unethical; or
	    c) monotonous to all but toddlers?

	 3. Lucky the leprechaun is beset by pre-adolescents always trying
	    to steal his cereal.  The children knock down other children's
	    snowmen ruthlessly to get these teeth-rotting bits of sugar and
	    the occasional fortifying mineral.  Is this:

	    a) ethical;
	    b) unethical; or
	    c) setting a really really bad example for the kids watching?

	 4. In yet another example of the consumption of cereal being a
	    crime, the Cookie Crook wants to have some Cookie Crisps, but
	    the Cop will not let him have any.  So the Cookie Crook steals
	    some Crisps.  Is this:

	    a) ethical;
	    b) unethical; or
	    c) showing a pattern in kid's cereal advertising?

	 Okay.. enough kid's commercial questions.

	 5. Danny Tanner, father of the "Full House" clan, is being pursued
	    by rabid hellhounds as he rides an old two-speed bike in a
	    frantic attempt to escape.  The hellhounds finally catch up to
	    him, ripping him to pieces.  A space-time warp opens up and
	    throws the Olsen twins (Michelle) and Uncle Jesse in for good
	    measure.  Meanwhile, Matt Shaw makes his move on Rebecca,
	    Jesse's wi -- er, widow.  She becomes his sex slave for as
	    long as he deems her necessary.  Is this:

	    a) ethical;
	    b) unethical; or
	    c) too good to be true (in the hellhound case) and not a chance
	       (in the Matt/Rebecca carnal union)?

	 Usual ethics quizzes have no "right" answer.  This one did.  If
	 you answered "c" to any of these questions, you think on the same
	 wavelength as we at IAFL do.  We are superior, and must band
	 together to execute those who answered otherwise.  Long live the
	 fighters!

	 [Uh.. yeah.  Actually, I wouldn't mind a "carnal union" with
	 "Rebecca".  But that's showing my carnal side again.  BTW, Jeff,
	 thanks for that vote of confidence.  Fuck you very very much.

2.08     White Punks on Punk (Reviews)
--------------------------------------

	 SOUND:

	 _Human Butt_ - Rollins (MS)
	 ----------------------

	 Henry Rollins, ex-lead singer of America's seminal hardcore band
	 Black Flag and current frontman/vocalist for his own Rollins Band,
	 is equally well-known for his spoken word discs as his musical
	 exploits.  _Human Butt_, a 2-CD set of spoken-word Rollins,
	 manages to be funny for the most part, yet tinged with Rollins'
	 own philosophy and that of the characters that populate his
	 true-life stories.
	     Consider his 52-minute "Adventures of an Asshole", in which
	 Rollins tries not to be an asshole for the duration of an
	 Australian tour with the Rollins Band.  Or "Smokin' The Filter",
	 where he recounts the tale of his first date and his subsequent
	 letdown.  Or (my personal favorite) "Donate Your Bodies To
	 Science, You Fools!", in which a homeless man called Crazy Paul is
	 made into a legend by a still-awed Rollins.
	     After hearing this album, you'll crave more of Rollins'
	 acerbic wit and wisdom; I know I did.  A definite must, in any
	 home.

						 - Quarterstick Records

	 _Telephone Free Landslide Victory_ - Camper Van Beethoven (MS)
	 ---------------------------------------------------------

	 Ska.  Probably not in the form it was meant to be played by all
	 those Brits, but ska nonetheless.  And GREAT ska it is.. a
	 half-speed, kind of folk/ska-tinged cover of Black Flag's
	 "Wasted", a few subcultural jokes with "Where the Hell Is Bill?",
	 and the classic "Take The Skinheads Bowling".  With the loopy
	 "Opi Rides Again/Club Med Sucks" and "Ambiguity Song" closing the
	 album, Camper Van put out one of the strongest, and most confusing
	 debuts of the 1980's.

					- IRS, orig. Pitch-a-Tent


	 War Wagon - _Finnigan's Tongue_  (SB)
	 -------------------------------

	 okay, well, its my cousin's band, SO WHAT...

	 1992, Independant, PUNK/FOLK/CELTIC

	 okay, ever heard of a cheesy irish band called the proclaimers (well
	 ah would drink five hundred boll's and i would drink 500 more just
	 to be the man who dran 1000 boll's to get so roarin' drunk
	 (doodaloodoo...etc.))?  well, think of them, with excellent clean
	 guitar, harmonica and other mixed in. well, its definitely not pop.
	 this is a great tape to listen to to escape from the monotony of
	 everlasting grunge and soundalike punk (even i get tired of it at
	 times) the guitar is played with laid back chording, with a nice
	 clean tube amp sound. the bass is subtly added to provide backing to
	 the guitar, not to blow out your speakers. there are many instruments
	 dropped out of the music scene incorporated... the harmonica and the
	 lead tambourine (a large tambourine that you can hear over the guitar)
	 as well as good, fly-by-you lyrics, like "Watching the rain, falling,
	 washing all my troubles, down the drain" and not a single word of bad
	 language in all of the 45 minutes of music.


	 Grapes of Wrath - _These Days_ (SB)
	 ------------------------------

	 Okay, its old, so what?

	 well, this is not punk, but it has a really nice feel, like the war
	 wagon, only bigger, with better equipment and less celtic-folk
	 influence. it isn't really pop, but it isn't really anything. just
	 cool to listen to when you are trying to concentrate.

	 The Butthole Surfers - _Hairway to Steven_ (SB)
	 ------------------------------------------

	 okay, well, what can i say?

	 okay, this is one of the early BHS tapes, the one with the cheesy
	 faces on the front. this is the one with no song names, just pictures.
	 it's great. i love it. my parents hate it. it just pounds out so
	 loud... that bass drum... that bass drum... ahhh.... i could just die.
	 i patch it thru my bass amp and knock down small skyscrapers... and
	 the lyrics make sense... and you can hear all of the instruments....


	 Sorry.  There will be NO Metallica reviews this issue, or ANY
	 issue.  If that was what you came looking for, no such luck.

	 SIGHT:

	 20/20 (heh, heh.. I kill me)

	 Seriously.. I haven't seen any movies lately.  Too busy keeping
	 myself literate (i.e., reading books).  What a concept.

2.09     Music Quiz For The Mentally Departed
---------------------------------------------

         What music do you like?
         a) what is music?
         b) the stuff in the elevators

         g) none of the above, where is grunge? *
              sorry. grunge is not allowed in this questionnaire as it is not

         h) Other

         * Heavy metal, Rap and "alternative" fit in this section.

         if you selected "other" before even looking at the other choices you
         are:
         (i) a poseur. if so, go back and select 'g'
         (ii) a person who likes cheating on surveys. select 'g'
         (iii) a non conformist. good, different is bad, therefore different
               is different (i could go into more on this but... no...)
         (iv) some loser trying to be cool

2.10     Dating in the 90's
---------------------------

         Being single in the 90's kind of sucks, to be honest.  Too many
         nasty diseases floating around.  Here's our guide to dating in
         the 90's, punk-rock, throwback to 1981 style:

         +-----------------------------------------------------------+

         Dating.  Argh.  One of the topics that none of us know like we
         know that there's no HC scene in our local area, but we're experts
         on it anyway.  Trust us.

         The most important thing to remember is this, and I quote Henry
         Rollins: "Women are evil.  Guys are morons."  There are
         exceptions, I just haven't met a woman who isn't evil, deep down,
         and there's not a guy I know, not even me, who isn't a fucking
         NITWIT when it comes down to the possibility of getting a date
         with a really great woman.

         THE LOGICAL PROCESSION
         ----------------------

         FIRST:  Decide which you want.. a girl, or a woman.  There ARE
         differences.  A _girl_ will not give head, usually.  But she can be
         coerced into going out, if you're suave enough (and older than she
         is by a couple of years).  And maybe you can work from there.

         A _woman_, however.. that's an entirely different story.  If you go
         out with a woman, she will not giggle when you make a humourous
         aside.. she will laugh.  And chances are, if she likes you enough,
         you'll be twisting yourself into varied positions all night long,
         and enjoying yourself the whole time.  A woman can LAST all
         night.. a girl, if she decides that you're "cool" enough, will
         last for one bout of intercourse, missionary position only, and
         then complain about how late it's getting, or will want to (God
         forbid) cuddle.  If a woman wants to cuddle.. you'll WANT to, as
         well.  They're that good.

         A word of warning.. some girls never grow up.  They'll be girls
         their entire life and will make whoever's fool enough to marry
         them miserable to the point of suicide.  Also be careful of women,
         sometimes; it's entirely possible that you may fall in love with a
         woman.  This is never the case with a girl, because girls are too
         flighty.  If you do fall in love with a woman, and she returns
         your love, celebrate.  Do the Dance of Joy.  If she doesn't, try
         to forget her.  And NEVER CONFUSE LOVE AND SEX.  Sex does not
         equal love.  (although the confusion's fun for a bit.)

         SECOND:  Pick the right places to go to meet someone.  If you want
         a nice girl, one you'll have no sexual contact with, go to church.
         If you want a sweet girl who you can have good sex with and be in
         love with and all.. let me know when you find a place you can meet
         one of those.  If you want a slut.. go to a bar, with a lot of
         money to buy her a few drinks.  We don't advise going with the
         slut, mainly because you could end up with some horrible STD.

         THIRD:  When you come in contact with the female of your choice,
         be yourself.  Don't come on like some cool-guy jock motherfucker
         if you're not.  If she's not impressed by you as you are, what
         fucking good is she?

         FOURTH:  Unless the female is obviously a slut, do not try
         anything sexual on the first date.  To attempt a kiss is
         admirable.  To ask for a blowjob or a fuck is not.  They don't
         like that very much, and if you try it, they certainly won't like
         YOU very much.  Be as much a gentleman as you can, and show her
         that it's the jocks/other normals who are the Neanderthals.


         HINTS THAT WILL KEEP YOU INTACT
         -------------------------------

         1)  Do NOT drop your standards for one SECOND.  If you're looking
             for a girl/woman who's slim, beautiful, sweet, etc., keep
             looking for her.  If you start looking at the girl you saw
             when you came in that made you go, "There but for the grace of
             God go I.." and thinking that she's not as bad as you
             thought, remember:  SHE IS!  She was when you came in, she is
             now, and you'll want to kill yourself if you wake up next to
             her tomorrow morning.

         2)  Scope carefully for her possible male companion.  It can be a
             real damper on things if you approach a really great woman and
             start talking, when some caveman wearing a letter jacket from
             his high school glory days taps you on the shoulder and uses
             his steroids-enhanced strength to beat you senseless.  Always
             look carefully before you leap, and make sure there's no other
             guys hanging around her.  Of course, if there are, it may be
             her brother, which would be just as bad if he's
             overprotective.  Or if THEY'RE fucking (only applicable to
             really remote parts of the States).

         3)  Protection.  Although this has been OVER-stressed by the media
             and anyone else who has no business knowing your business, we
             suggest that you take precautions to keep from living in fear
             of dying.


         REJECTION AND HOW TO DEAL WITH IT
         ---------------------------------

         Okay, first thing.. rejection REALLY sucks.  Especially if she's
         hot.  But that's beside the point.

         How to handle rejection varies, depending on your location.  If
         you're in church, for instance, you could simply say, "The Lord
         has not led our paths to cross one another."  If that response
         makes you ill, we'll use another example.  In a bar, you could
         always just say, "Okay, cool," nodding your head slowly.  Then
         walk away.

         Truth is, it varies from person to person.  I handle it with
         humor.  Other people handle it with cruelty and personal attacks.
         The less imaginative of the latter group frequently use "Fuck
         you!" as a comeback.  The more imaginative would simply go up to
         anyone else trying to hit on her and mumble something about her
         sexual preference/sexual history.  Be creative.


         DO OPPOSITES ATTRACT?
         ---------------------

         Fuck, I don't know.  Sometimes.  Two people who are called
         "opposites" aren't entirely opposite.  They could have a favorite
         movie in common, or a favorite album/type of music, or something.
         (I have yet to meet a female who's heard of Big Black by her own
         investigation, rather than having one of her ex-boyfriends
         introduce her.  But that's just my experience.)


         WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED?
         ---------------------

         Basically, be yourself and you'll do fine.  if anyone has a
         problem with you being who you are, tell them to fuck off.  Stick
         with your standards, don't hit on a girl whose boyfriend is
         standing right next to her, and don't forget those little magic
         prophylactics.

2.11     Mini-Slam List
-----------------------

         Decided there wasn't much to slam on except things we REALLY hate.
         here goes:

         My supreme bitch of an ex-girlfriend, who's one of those church
           christians and, for that reason, is REALLY stupid

         [yes, that was mine.  - ed.]

         argh! no more wannabe punks who think pearl jam = punk! death to
           all of them!

         the area mentality which drives us to believe we must slam on
         ANYTHING

         times that you just can't think of anything REALLY good to slam on

2.12     damn junies
--------------------

         okay, i used to work for a dj, selling tickets. now at one dance,
         we had 200 people, (i counted) 61 of which were junior highs. i was
         pretty drunk at the time, but shit.. these guys were roasted. this
         one girl (they were _all_ girls) was about 4'8", maybe 80 pounds,
         passed out in the main hallway. she had had a half a beer. the
         police pulled 11 people out, all juniors for drinking. they puked on
         the steps of the hall for 2 or 3 hours before getting the shit at home
         (plus a handy 185$ fine) plus 6 or 7 _narc_ charges. while i spent
         the entire night beside a cop, drunk as hell for the first 3 hours,
         then refreshed in the washroom and drunk again... i had a damn lot of
         beer - and i didn't get charged. or even got looked at funny. or
         anything. but christ... they all smoke, they all drink... hell, people
         said generation x was bad... this is generation degeneration. is their
         quest to grow up while still immature, so impertinent that they can
         only pick up on the bad habits? most of these 10-12 year olds,
         promiscuous as hell, were all dressed like a pile of sluts. tight low
         cut tops, super tight jeans, clear silk shirts, like hell - i don't
         see people that desperate in high school, and i have seen some pretty
         bad cases.

         more bitching by the bellboy of noize...

2.13     Why?
-------------

         Following the recent, unintentional semi-sexist slant this 'zine
         has taken in the past couple of articles (which is unusual.. I'm
         just having a bad week) is this issue's "Why?", fielded by yours
         truly, the editor:

         Q:  Why do women seem so evil?

         A:  (MS) Some are.  Some just don't realize that lying to us isn't
             cool.  Some aren't at all.  I'd like to meet one in that
             latter category.  It's pretty much just based on your
             observations, and personal opinion, rather than a matter of
             the woman actually being evil.  However, most of the ones I
             meet are REAL FUCKING BITCHES.

-------------------
2.14     An Apology
-------------------

         I must apologize both to you, the reader, and to my fellow
         contributors about my lack of strong contributions this issue.
         Some really trippy shit's been going down, and I've been
         distracted.  Rest assured, next issue, I'll be my normal, ranting,
         acerbic self again and you'll be howling just as much as you did
         w/issue #1 and all of ANA.

         Merry Fucking Christmas. This christmas i got a phone bill. it came
         today. i can't wait for daddy to open it and ruin my christmas. you
         see, it's over 300 dollars. i'm broke. damn. you see, in canada,

         christmas i want to get an axe, so i can axe murder my parents and
         blame it on Iron Maiden. i think that that would be cool. The only
         thing grease music is good for is as a fall music to blame things on.
         !!! Friend update !!! well, it has been 3 months now, still no
         friends. Heard a new band - Fl!pper... They are (like bodacious, man)

         km/h. have you ever driven that slow? i don't even have my licence
         (and likely never will) and even i drive faster than that... damn
         amish and those damn buggys always getting hit...

         i still don't see how you figure that the deal sisters are nice
         looking :)

         virgin wool
         syndicated television
         PEOPLE WHO TYPE IN ALLCAPS
         (BRANCH- why are new users inclined to type in allcaps? do you forget
         all of the shit they forced into your head in english on your first
         message? don't fucking yell or i will come and type in allcaps with a
         big hammer on your head)
         the fender guitar company
         my toes
         UNIX computers

         Okay, thats all for the Sonic Bellboy for this edition of Canadian
         connexshun.

2.16     Well, G'Night, Everybody!

         Thanks for reading.  Next issue: the return of my asshole
         attitude. <King Crimson's "Lark's Tongues In Aspic, Pt. I", just
         before the main riff.. suspense building.>

         Nods again to Sonic Bellboy, whose material basically carried this
         issue.  I just wish calls to Canada didn't cost so fucking much.
