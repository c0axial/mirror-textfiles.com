Welcom to Out Of Step Magazine, issue 2.  The first issue was done well over 
a year ago, and the little war charade halted intended monthly production.
We'll have to see how it goes this time.
Ok, this is the netware version.  Goes out on bitnet, internet, BBSs etc.
Hopefully we'll be able to get it up on eff.org on the internet.  Anyway,
we can also probably get you a paper copy if you want to redistribute
it in your area with all of the art and cartoons etc.  Check it out.

            Attack of the Killer Censorship

                         by FrankenChrist

    Hey, all you'se nifty folksies out there in the REAL world (haha), I
wuz just sitting here, wondering what I could rant and rave about, when I
remembered a little bit of nifty information.  Anyone a member of the
Columbia House Record club?  You know, the thing with 14 CD's for a penny
with only your promise to buy 6 more at regular club prices in the next 3
years?  Well, has anyone ordered Anthrax's "Attack
 of the Killer B's" from
there?  If not, DON'T.  Unless of course you like your music censored.  That's
right, the CH version has all them naughty words buzzed out.  By this I mean
that any time it sez fuck or shit or anything, a quite annoying representation
of a bee fills it's place.  And what's worse, "Startin' up a Posse" isn't
even on there.  How's that for fascism?
    Ahh, yes, censorship.  Brings back memories of the good ol' days with
Jello and Tipper-babe.  Don'cha just love it when someone
 else can determine
what you read, see, or listen to?
    Just bought a new FEAR CD.  No, you didn't read me wrong, a NEW FEAR CD.
It's a live disc from concerts and shit called "Live.. For the Record" and
guess what?  CENSORED.  All them dirty words are simply blanked out.  Don't
even get the courtesy of a "beep" or a "ding" or "ka-oooooooga".  And the
funny thing about it is it's put out by Restless Records, the same people who
now produce the Dead Milkmen and Agent Orange.  It's funny how these ba
stards
censor the lovable (?) Lee Ving and, after that, he even writes an intro for
the CD.  The Intro reads:


                                                      12 June 1991

     FEAR started in 1978 and some of us are still alive.

     This record is FEAR playing live at some radio station in
L.A., in 1986.  approximately [SIC] 190,000 good, pure hating, slammers
showed up, choking the streets of L.A. for ten square miles and it
was then that I began to dream of skinhead armies.

     
So this guy pulls up a 24 track recording studio built into
the back of a truck and the rest is history. . . . we listened to it.
Sounded good.  We already knew that yous [SIC] will buy anything.  so [SIC] we
released it.

     Hope you hate it!

     You deserve it!

            Thanx,       


     LEE VING

     Just kidding. . . .

     So this is a live recording of some previously recorded
stuff (you know, the ones from whence we got the really big bucks)
and as many that were never 
recorded.

     As we (FEAR) have recently conference called the
respective FEAR mansions and discussed the matter of maybe a
definite possibility of an even further reaching future masterpiece of
sound and philosophy, you may be hearing more from us.
So f--k [dashes, Ving] you!  Just kidding!

     [signature, Ving]

     LEE VING

**end of intro.

    Yeah, Lee, you're some tough guy, alright.  And as for Restless Records?
Oh, they're owned by a major label.  I'm not sure if it's CBS or RCA
, but does
it really matter?  Once again the big labels bring down another victim and
makes another sell-out.  Owell.  The day that Henry Rollings or Jello Biafra
sells out, I'm leaving planet earth.

                      Government Propaganda

                            by Quadrac

     The government has been building up large amounts of 
propaganda over the years.  During the time of peace between now 
and Vietnam was the worst.  Every night when the networks close
dow
n we get the flag and a proud, high flying jet in on our 
screens.  We have been seeing movies glorifying war.  Such as Top 
Gun, or Red Dawn.  These movies gave the American people a feeling 
of invincibility.  Most people think we can never be beaten and 
that whatever we are doing with our military is just.  At this 
time, neither is true.
     Media coverage over the years has also been very biased.  One 
of the major examples is NBC being owned by General Electric.  
General Electric is one of 
the largest "defense" contractors in 
the world.  You will never see anything controversial concerning 
government military actions or much about environmental disasters 
when nuclear energy is involved.
     In the last few years, TV reporters and journalists salaries 
have been going up considerably.  It would not be in their best 
interests to report the truth.  So they sprinkle in sufficient 
amounts of "politically advantageous" jargon.  Once you are 
getting paid enough, you no longer care abo
ut ethics.
     Here are a few good alternative news sources that produce 
unbiased reports because they are not owned by government 
affiliated agencies:
     The Militant (socialist newspaper)
     The Guardian (marxist newspaper)
     In These Times (leftist newspaper)


                       No S.S. In the U.S.

                            by T.I.M.

     The growing climate in America is increasingly reminding me 
of that of pre-war Nazi Germany.  The suppression of news and 
views that
 the government does not deem suitable for the American 
public is at an all time high.  The intelligence agencies of the 
United States seem to be developing into the government's private 
police force to spy on and threaten anyone who doesn't support 
America's goals.  The First Amendment rights that this country was 
founded upon are being taken back by the propaganda on the 
television and in the press.  After all, how can you have the
freedom to speak out  when you can't even think for yourself?
 
The United States pleads with Iraq to honor the Geneva Convention
when dealing with our prisoners of war, but plays blind, deaf,
and dumb when it comes to our own prisoners in this country.
Amnesty International has singled out the Chicago Police
Department in general and Chicago Police Commander Jon Burge in
particular for using "electroshock, suffocation, Russian roulette,
burnings, beatings, and threats of death and mutilation" on at
least 40 black, male prisoners between 1972 and 1984. Jon Bur
ge
is still in power.  Nationalism is on the  rise, and media
propaganda contributes to its rise daily.  
'Objective journalism' (in major American media) has become a term 
that now is in a class with 'jumbo shrimp' and 'military 
intelligence'.  George Bush speaks of a 'New World Order'.  Hitler 
spoke of one too. As any person with a functional brain can see, 
the U.S. is only moral when morality suits our goals.  We condemn 
the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, yet we continue to feed Isreal 
money 
when they have been occupying Palestine since 1973.  To this 
date, there has been no invasion of South Africa by U.S. forces 
when the black majority is (and has been) oppressed by a political 
system operated by the white minority government.  As you can see 
(assuming that you have made it this far through my ranting and 
raving), the United States is not the moral guardian that the 
media would like us to believe it is.  We the people need to stand 
up and speak out against this injustice.  We mu
st change this 
nation before it is destroyed by its own ego.


                        Is Killing Moral?


One of the major issues in the Persian Gulf War that is 
continuously overlooked is the fact that PEOPLE are dying.  The 
military and the media are largely responsible for this.  The
war has been totally dehumanized by the media and death count
figures aren't being released by the military as it would be
"politically unadvantageous."  As a result, many Americans don't
think about the man
y human lives, both American and Iraqi, being
lost everyday.  While we are all concerned about our loved ones
fighting in this war, we must also be concerned about the Iraqi
people who are dying every day.  These aren't "military targets"
or "assets" as the media and military refer to them but people 
just like us.  They have friends and loved ones just as we do
and they are no less human than we are.  Our military has even
killed civilians, completely innocent people, and the govern-
ment has the g
all to lie about the reasons why.  There are many
reasons why we shouldn't support this war, both political and
moral, but the human lives being needlessly destroyed is the 
most important reason I can think of.  
     Our laws are based on Judao-Christian morality, in part-
icular, "Thou Shalt Not Kill."  Yet many Americans support this
act of aggression by the United States even though our country
is killing and sending people to die every day.  No justifi-
cation by the government is able to expl
ain the necessity of
these deaths.  Why should so many people have to die?  A peace-
ful solution was never even tried.  The simple fact is killing
does not create peace just as darkness doesn't create light.
killing only creates more killing.  Only when we can find non-
violent solutions to our problems can we truly know peace.


                        Support the Whites

                            by T.I.M.

     People all across this nation of ours are using the slogan 
'SUPPORT THE TROOP
S'.  This essay is not about supporting the 
troops, it is about the selective support that the troops are 
receiving.  There are quite a few racists in America today.  Many 
of these racists tell us to 'SUPPORT THE TROOPS'.  Almost one-
third of the soldiers in the Gulf are black or hispanic.  How can 
these cross-burning hypocrites tell us to 'SUPPORT THE TROOPS' 
when they will refer to one-third of these troops as niggers or 
spics upon their return home.  If one chooses to 'SUPPORT THE 
TROOPS'
, SUPPORT THEM ALL !!!  There are enough hypocrites in this 
country already!  Racism is a social disease that is not only 
ignorant, but harmful.  Stop the ignorance!  From racial slurs to 
unjust investigation and imprisonment of minority leaders, stop 
the hatred!  Our nation was founded upon freedom.  How can we talk 
about liberating other countries when many people in America are 
not free from racism?

                           Fuck Racism

                            by Quadrac

     Wh
at comes to your mind when you think of racism?  The 
struggle between black and white?  Let's get a little broader 
people.  How about European, African, Asian, and Middle Eastern.  
Every racial group has their own special forms of racism, all of 
which are completely worthless.  There is only one race, the human 
race.  Why do groups like the Aryans and the KKK even exist?  They 
don't even know!  It's all a large combination of fear and 
insecurity.  Fear that the black man or the Jew will start 

thinking just like them.  Insecure in the fact that the world does 
not revolve around their simple minds.  Standing on their 
pedestal that they call America.  The same America built on the 
backs of Africans and Asians while he called Jews and Moslems 
heretics.  All for ego and using religion as an excuse.  
Destroying families and entire villages to make slaves, then strip 
them of their own religion!  Killing Native Americans to take the 
land and rape it!  Are you proud to be an American patr
iot?  If 
you are, you make me sick!Now you wonder why the Native American 
and the African is pissed?  You say that slavery and oppression 
are over?  What about "reservations" and economic slavery?  Find a 
place that houses "minorities" and label it a ghetto.  Don't give 
their schools any money and they can't get an education.  Putting 
liquor and gun stores on every corner hoping they'll kill each 
other off over drugs the government imports.  If you are young and 
been poor all your life, and 
your only chance to get paid is join 
the white man's army or sell drugs, what are you going to do?  
THINK ABOUT IT!

This picture was reality!

                Condoms and Dungeons and Dragons

                            by Quadrac

     What is it with the church?  Do you attend regularly?  Are 
you one of the people that puts flyers in D&D books?  Tear up an 
condom machines lately?
     Today people, one of the greatest enemies of freedom is the 
church!  You want to be a real patriot?  
Don't fly a yellow 
ribbon! Fight the church!  The church is literally killing people
and causing teenage pregnancy.
     There are a lot of religious zealots out there who refuse to 
teach their children about safe sex.  They tear out condom 
machines wherever they find them.  Does this solve the problems of 
people having pre-marital sex?  no! It causes AIDS to spread 
easier, and teenage pregnancy.  Is that what their religion is 
about?
     Where is a quote from the Bible (ugh) that says all p
eople 
should be forced to God (ugh)?  I'm sure if your kids don't read 
Dungeon's and Dragons, or Huckleberry Finn, then they'll become 
young, God fearing Christians.  What kind of God are you supposed 
to fear?  Why should you fear the ultimate good?  Why don't you 
people come out of your stupors and open your eyes to the REAL 
world. Solve some real problems like AIDS and homelessness instead 
of worrying about something you don't know really exists?

Here's a quote from Malcom X
   "I'm not 
an American, I'm a victim of Americanism."

What do you think you people are?


                       Sanctions From Hell

                            by Quadrac

     Remember the sanctions right before the war last year?  Well, 
we all know they are still in effect.  The government keeps these 
going so the people will overthrow the current government of Iraq. 
However, this doesn't seem to be working.  All of the population 
is about half starved.  They have no medical supplies, no 
electr
icity, no clean water, and no working sewer systems.  They 
are in shit ankle deep in Iraq.  Do you think it's the army and 
the government thats suffering?  Hell no!  It's the innocent 
civilians that don't want anything to do with it.
     The civilians are not going to be able to overthrow the 
government in Iraq.  It is plain and simple.  The army gets all of 
the food that they do produce in the country.  Most of the Iraqi 
army is still in tact.  They wouldn't stop the people just to stop 
the
m out of patriotism.  They would stop them so they could still 
eat!
     Most of the children in Iraq are malnourished.  Disease is 
spreading at an unprecedented rate.  Even the nations that we were 
"allied" with are losing because of this.  Turkey is losing 7 
billion dollars a year because they can no longer trade food and 
goods with Iraq.  The sanctions need to be stopped.  If we stop 
them now, maybe the people can still get some help.  The country 
would not be fully operational for years. 
 Children are starving, 
not armys!  If you agree that this should be stopped.  Organize a 
protest, write your congressman.  It may help just a little.  
Remember, Bush is losing his hold and his support!

I was riding the train the other day
There was this man setting in front of me
He had a shirt on that displayed a flag
I said, "Hey, what does that flag mean to you?"
He said, "It means liberty and freedom for ALL!"
I said, 
"What would you do if I burnt one?"
He said, "I'll kill you!"

Every time I try to write about the system
My thoughts go muddy
And I just become lazy and want to stop.
Do you think there are drugs in the water?
                                                                 

Now, all the religious people want to silence us
All the "patriots" are taking their aim
Alternateens, they worship us
And all the hardcore's think were lame
Either listen to us or don't
Go out there and stand up for you
r rights
If you have the guts to rock the boat
Rot in Hell, where you sit
Or pick up your baseball bat
And have a motherfucking fit.
                                                                 

New leaves in the spring
Strong as they'll ever be
Lacking maturity and blown off
By a wind that stinks of death
Dropping in the oily sea
And carried on the blackened waves
Only to land on a lonely beach
And tumble across the bloody sands

FREEDOM

I've heard stories of young soldiers
Shooting off one of their own legs
To get out of the military
Just like an animal
Who chews off his or her leg
To get out of a steel-jaw leg-hold trap
Just to be free
Everybody wants to be free
Everybody wants to be free
Everybody wants to be free

(As an afterthought, I think it's about time
 we stop chewing off out own legs and start
 chewing the legs o
ff the system.)

BEGGING FOR FREE SPEECH

Free speech
Does not include 
Asking for a dime
The first amendment
Does not apply to
Homeless people
Freedom of speech
Is not a right
You have to buy it
The 1st amendment
Belongs to the rich
Not to people living in the street

RED SUNRISE

Sun rise, the sky is as red as blood
Shed for greed
History is made out of the lie
Of the one who
 survives
Ships sail across the sea bringing disease
and the white man who came to steal the land
The old world is destroyed
As the might trees are all chopped down
The so called good word is spread
Like a cancer on the mother earth
And the native who doesn't believe
Is burned alive
500 years later
Where there was once sacred land
Now stands a shopping mall
Burial mounds make great places for condos
Trees once stood tall reaching to the sky
Now it's just telephone poles, buildings, wires
Stre
etlights, trash, cars and billboards
The once beautiful landscape is now
On giant landfill
And what about the people
Whose land was invaded?
They were burned, tortured, raped and mutilated
Because they were savage
White meaning of savage:
Respecting life
Living with nature, not against it
But nature is the enemy
That's what the white god said
And in the end
The white god always wins
So slavery and genocide
Was the native amercians' fate
For having the wrong color skin
Or worshipping the wro
ng things
Or for not just letting the white man
Take their land
500 years later
They're the bad guys
In all the John Wayne movies
Stereotyped on TV
Red tarbabies selling everything
From butter to cigars
And football games
GO REDSKINS!!!
Just one more slap in the face
After 500 years of pain

NORTH AND NOT SOUTH

On an empty lot that used to be a house
a family of seven completely wiped out
But it's o.k. they were North and not South
A 
little Christmas present
From our great Christian nation
Of course
That was the bad war
This is the good war
That was the bad war
This is the good war
(we lost that war
we won this war)

Cheese Whiz On Crack

I see the face
Then it is gone
From my mind
There, no more.
I look, I search, I seek, I ponder
But there it is not
In my memory
My memory
My twisted mind
Where the only order 
Is governed by General Chaos
And at his right hand:
Major Disorder.
My sanity is unraveling
Like the rope under strain
And I am walking on that rope
Waiting for the Fall
To plummet into the dark depths of my mind

And drown
In the sea of Insanity.


Emotions

I lose my appetite
When I think of you.
Your horrid face
Your ugly eyes
And the way you fix your nails just so.
I get really violent
When I look at you.
I want to slice, dice, mangle
and CHOP.
Grind you into tiny little bits and pieces
and call it a good job.
I die
When I think of you.
The way you took my heart
The way you took my soul
The love I gave to you that you returned to me in a box
Sealed with a kiss
And your echoing laughter
Ri
nging in my mind.

   Yo, G, It's Old Pink!

---> Ice Cube & David Duke: Brothers seperated at birth?

I bought it, I admit.  I went out and bought Death Certificate because
it was the new Ice Cube, and I was a big fan.  I couldn't understand
why he was so mad at me! Here he was, talking about killing the cracker,
beating down jack, and all that.  Damn, I was let down.  The few good songs
(Y
oung Man's Summer Vacation is one) are surronded by racist crap.  I don't
get it.  If I said the same things, I'd get beat down.  What is it?  He's
(at last count) anti white, black, Korean, Japanese, rich, poor, NWA, and
all that.  Uh huh.  n e ways, didja know Priority Records (which Ice Cube
owns) puts out Eazy E, NWA & Ice Cube albums.  So, besides all the bullshit
about NWA and stuff, he makes a buck or two off every NWA record sold. Huh.

David Duke.  Wow, I can remember when this guy was ridic
uled.  Oh well,
times are changing too damn fast for me.  Why do these people do this? I
see a picture in Newsweak of a 12 year old girl, big smile, "DUKE FOR PRES"
banner.  Makes me sick.  David Duke has been discredited by every major
politician, denied due process of ridicule of the masses, and is in general
a loser.  But he has a strong message, and that message sells.  His populist
message blends well with his racist rhetoric; the dovetail is so fine you
can't see it.  How do you draw the line? 
 This is one of those wedge candidates
you here about so often.  Very few vote for him, but those who do shape
the planks in the platform that seperates the opponents on either side.
Pat Buchanan (another Nazi) and Bill Clinton will both benefit from his
running.  

David Duke, head of NAAWP.  I used to read the shit he wrote, one I found
in my junior high school was about the scientific proof that blacks were
inferior to whites, that we were more highly evolved, and all that shit.

Ice Cube, head
 of the Lench Mob.  He preaches death and violence, drug use,
all that shit he was against in Boyz In The Hood (a great movie).

You decide.  Polar opposites, but are they that far apart or are they next
door?  Is the scale of racism a line or a circle?  Could Duke exist without
Cube?  It's up to you to decide. I think Cube & Duke should be locked in
a room and made to exist with each other for a year or two. I dunno.

   Yo,
 G, It's Old Pink!

---> USA, Timor, and how your taxes kill innocent people

I was reading in the New Yorker about this little country, Timor, that we
have fucked over.  This is our ally, remember. Here's what goes down:

A teenager is shot on the steps of a church by regime forces for speaking
out against it.  (this is a regime we installed, and supply with M 16's
and ammo and all that)  A group of locals built a little shrine, and came
to pray at the church.  A New Yorker photo guy & reporter w
ere there, and
they said there were a few regime troops standing around, watching the
funeral.  About 3 or 4 hundred folks showed, they picked up the casket and
carried it to the graveyard. Nothing going on, no violence, no nothing.
Just weeping over the death of a teenager.

They got to the graveyard, which had 5 foot tall stone walls around it.
As many people got in as possible, with the rest climbing trees to watch.Some people climbed trees to watch the burial, which was a buncha praying
and cryi
ng and stuff.  Someone yells, "Troops!" and sure as shit, a buncha
cia sponsored gestapo fucks with American supplied guns, American uniforms,
trucks, tanks, and shit cornered all these unarmed people and systematically
shot them to death.  The New Yorker folks said the only reason the lived
was that they were American, and Americans are above the law there.  

The US State Department issued no comment on this incident.  The Timorese
regime issued a statement about an armed uprising being put down at
 a  
graveyard, talking about hundreds of armed civvies in resistance colors
firing on regime troops. 

Keep in mind, our tax dollars go directly to this regime, to support the
head of state, to arm him and feed him and give him planes and boats and
shit.  This isn't a covert CIA thing; this is a yearly, budgeted thing in
our foriegn policy.   Think about it.

landing, unguided, in civilian areas
but fuck it man, kick his ass man!
cause we're wild, brave & free

We're so FREE that if you speak out
And exercise your freedom
YOU GET KILLED

We're so BRAVE if someone questions our thinking
we kick his ass
even if he is our friend

We're so WILD we send our
 flyboys all over the world
World Class Kick Ass Police Force
Even if they are scared college boys on LSD

Wild, Brave & Free.
Wild like a banshee, killing without reason
Brave as a lunatic, slaughtering the innocent
Free as a prisoner, dying in an invisible cell

Can you see the walls? I can.
Can you hear the screams? I can.
Can you feel the stings? I can.

But only if I want to.
Only if I must.


You must desire freedom to receive it.

--------------------------------------------<>

N
o walls

No walls surround me
I rule all
I am supreme.

Those who oppose me die.
Those who ally themselves to me die.
Those who are indifferent to me die.

I am a force of one. I am the leader.
I drive your quests. I drive your industry.
I am chained and pull your strings too.

You could control me
But you see walls I place to stop you
could kill me
could
but you won't
You're your own worst enemy.
Your fear me. I am fear. I rule all.

Death bows before me.
Step to the side as I pass, 
because you fear me.

I think I'll kill another one to boost my image.

--------------------------------------------<>

Flowers in the sky

In the land of the strong
stalked a killer
A man of incomparable strength.
A total killer, a killing machine.

He preyed on the weak, til only the strong survived.
But the strong became weak, as the crowd thinned.
In the end, even the strong were weak and died.

He was a good man, in the beginning.
He had friends, he had money
he had fame
but was bor
ed

So he corraled the world and killed it
dark blanket of death soaking the life of the planet
into outer space
and leaving
a bone white
dry cracked lifeless

America rules
