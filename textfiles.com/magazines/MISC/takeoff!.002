 Notes from the editor
 ---------------------
 
 
  Welcome to the second issue of Take Off!  I am glad that this newsletter is
not discontinued after the first issue, as I found that there are actually a
few publications dealing with flight simulators only.  I also have read some
of them, and found them to be better than this newsletter, although they are
printed publications, however.
  At first, there seemed to be no reason for me to continue this newsletter,
since there are already good publications, published by veteran flight sim
pilots.  But I decided to continue publishing this newsletter, as it actually
was a fun project.  Even though I have not received any feedback or letters
from users, I will continue to put a lot of effort into making this small
newsletter better and better.
  In this issue, I have reviewed more scenery files, flight simulators, and
things related.  I also added a new section: `Interesting facts.' which
deals with some interesting facts about flight simulatos, real planes, stealth
technology, etc.  The sources of these facts are various boods and articles, I
have been collecting.  As a matter of fact, I had to do some research on
these subjects in order to provide accurate and interesting information.  I
didn't want to write something that's boring to read, and hard to understand!
  All in all, I hope you will find this newsletter better than the first issue
and enjoy reading it!

                               Review
                               ------
  In this section I am going to review the scenery files for MS Flight
Simulator 4.0.  I will try to review the new scenery files, but as there
are many other good scenery files already created, I will do my best to keep
up with these files.
  The files in this section are ONLY for Microsoft Flight Simulator 4.0 and
its companion, Aircraft and Scenery Designer, also by Microsoft Co.
 
                              ---------------
                              Washington D.C.
                              ---------------
 
Author               : Rus Phillips with Jeff Bingham
Scenery Disk required: No
Things Required      : MS FS4 and Aircraft & Scenery Designer
Rating               : 7.5         (10 points is the best, 0 is the worst)
 
  Although, this scenery does not require any scenery disks it's better if you
have one (Scenery Disk 7).  Actually, it's an addon scenery to the SD-7, in my
opinion.  There aren't many buildings, or things to see, but there are a few
interesting airports, and buildings.
  It covers D.C. Metro, Baltimore, Maryland, and Northern Virginia areas, as
well as all the local public airports, and all local navaids.  The author has
merged his own design of the Washington National Airport with Jeff Bingham's
design, with Jeff's permission of course.  As a result, the Washington National
Airport is the most detailed airport in the scenery.  Another airport that
might be interesting is the College Park Airport, which was built in 1909 by
the Wright Brothers to test their Flyer.  In fact, it is one of the oldest
airports still in operation today.  It mostly caters to Cessnas these days.
There are other local public airports in the scenery, but they are not as
detailed as the Washington National Airport.
  There are 5 bridges across the river, and I found these bridges to be quite
nice.  They are detailed, and nicely rendered, but when you look at these
bridges from a distance, you will notice that they look as if they are floating
above the ground! (Maybe, my eyes are wrong,<G>)  When I was flying toward
these bridges, (yes, they are positioned very close to each other) I thought
there were only 3 bridges, but later I found that one of them was black, which
made me think it was the shadow of a bridge!  Anyway, I liked these bridges
pretty much.
  To list other interesting elements in the scenery, there are quite a number
of government buildings, such as the CIA headquarters, Smithsonian Castle,
David Taylor Model Basin, and Pentagon.  The David Taylor Model Basin is the
place used for testing ship hulls by the U.S. Navy.  This building has a huge
pool, which this editor found to be a very exciting place to land, and to take
off from, using any sea planes.  It is a great challenge to land the plane in
the pool without crashing into the building.  (It's hard, so beginners don't
try it! <Grin> )
  Washington D.C. scenery is a good addon to the SD-7, but it's not that good
as stand-alone scenery.  There is still much room for improvement to make it
stand-alone scenery.  Also, if you have a slow machine, you will want to
decrease the number of dynamic objects in the scenery setup menu, otherwise you
will have very slow frame rates.
  Overall, it is satisfactory.

                  -------------------------------------
                  Dallas Ft. Worth International, Texas
                  -------------------------------------
 
 
Author               : Rod Conklin
Scenery Disk required: No
Things Required      : MS FS4 and Aircraft & Scenery Designer
Rating               : 8.3          (10 points is the best, 0 is the worst)
 
 
 
  This scenery covers the Dallas Ft. Worth International Airport.  The airport
is heavily detailed, so if you have a slow machine you should turn off some
options in menu 1.  You will find some tips to improve frame rates in the
document file included with the scenery file.  Be sure to read the document
file, as it contains ILS frequencies, and some insights of the scenery.
  The main terminal is arranged in a series of semi-circles in the center of
the airport.  There are many hangers in the airport, and you can taxi into
those hangers.  Each hanger includes a fuel box for refueling.  The author
added some hangers and other elements which are not very accurately positioned,
or do not exist, but these will make flying around the airport much more fun!
(After all, the scenery files were created for fun, right? <g>)
  You won't see any other buildings other than the ones at the airport, unless
you have SD-1. A lot of roads are laid out in the scenery, however.  There is
an annoying problem I have encountered.  Whenever I started up a mod file
provided with the scenery, I lost all the sound.  Even though I tried numerous
ways to recover the sound, for some reason, all the sound disappered on my
machine. (Mine is equipped with a Soundblaster, and Mallard Sound/Aircraft,
upgrade kit).  If you know how to recover the sound, please let me know.
  It does not require SD-1, but you'll get more enjoyment out of this scenery
if you have SD-1.  Whether you have the SD-1 or not, you'll be impressed by
details of the airport.  The author used SEE03 utility, which provides
some nice effects in designing scenery, and it makes night flying more
enjoyable than the day flying.  Buildings and terminals at the airport get
dark at night, roads turns into series of lights, etc.  All these elements
make this scenery very enjoyable, but this makes for slow frame rates, as
mentioned earlier.  Machines with 25 Mhz clock or above should not experience
any significant slowness while flying around the airport, however.

Commercial Flight Simulators
----------------------------
 
 In this issue, I have reviewed two commercial flight simulators:
 Chuck Yeager's Air Combat, and Thunderhawk.
 
 
                       -------------------------
                       Chuck Yeager's Air Combat
                       -------------------------
 
 
 
Publisher     : Electronic Arts
Programmer    : Brent Iverson
Graphics      : CGA, EGA, MCGA, VGA, &TGA
Memory        : 640KB
Hard Disk Req : No, but recommended
SoundBoard    : Tandy, Roland, Adlib, Covox, and Sound Blaster
Retail Price  : $ 59.95
Rating        : 9.4        (10 is the best, 0 is the worst)
 
 
  Ever thought of sitting in the cockpits of World War II, Korean War, and
Vietnam era fighter planes?  Or, dreamed of flying your favorite jet against
the old prop-planes; shooting them down with missiles?  If that's the case,
this sim might be just for you!
  Chuck Yeager's Air Combat, designed and programmed by Brent Iverson, who
brought us the LHX simulator a while ago, is one of the most realistic fighter
plane simulators available yet.  This is the third sim that's affiliated with
General Yeager, from Electronic Arts.  As the name reflects, this sim has been
tested and endorsed by General Yeager, and therefore you should expect the
flight charactristics of all the planes in this sim to be very realistic.  But
by no means is this sim only for hard-core flight sim veterans.  It has many
options which you can turn on/off at anytime.  These options will make your
plane invincible, bullet proof, or a super plane, if you wish.
  There are also some other options that are helpful for beginners, such as
Target Window, and General Yeager's Window.  The Target Window will let you see
a locked target even if it's not in visual range, or behind you!  General
Yeager's window gives you advice and tips, such as `break left', `enemy on your
six', `missile coming', etc.  On the other hand, you can also turn off all the
options, set it to the hardest level, and you're up for a real hard time!  You
have to fly very skillfully and carefully in order to complete a mission
successfully in this mode.  One mistake... boom!!

continued from page 4...
------------------------
 
  One unique feature about this sim is that it lets you fly almost any planes
supported in the game, in any era (WWII, Korea, Vietnam) against any level of
enemies!  This can be accomplished by creating a custom mission in the mission
builder from the main menu.  The options you can choose from are: your plane
type, enemy planes, number of enemies, and the level of enemy pilots.  By using
this feature, you can put yourself into some exciting moments with the missions
you have created.  For instance, how about flying the P-51 against 4 Mig-21s,
controlled by excellent enemy pilots?  Or, you flying the F-4 Phantom against
an Me-109, blasting 'em with a missile or with your vulcan gun!  As you can
see, there are many more things you can do with the mission builder, with only
your imagination the limit!
  Of course there is a campaign mode which will let you fly in one of the three
eras mentioned above.  However, the campaign mode merely consists of a series
of separate missions, such that no one mission's result effects any other
missions.  Oh well, may be that's not that bad.
  As far as the graphics are concerned, you will be amazed by their smoothness,
of even if you have a 386SX.  Brent Iverson, the programmer of this sim,
is quite well known for making `smooth-graphics' based flight simulators, and
CYAC certainly is even better than the previous one.  As a matter of fact,
the editor felt that other flight simulators are too slow after playing
CYAC!  Jet Fighter 2 from Velocity is the closest flight sim that has about
the same smoothness of CYAC.
  Actually, I should not say this, but what the heck!  I liked this sim more
than the others I have, as it includes Korea as one of the theatres, which is
where I come from! <G>  There haven't been any previous flight sims, to my
knowledge, which include Korea in their scenery.  Anyway, whether you are a
veteran flight sim pilot, or a beginner, you will find this sim to be very
enjoyable and exciting!
  Happy flying!

  In a stormy night, you hear the sound of a chopper from a distance.  The
lightening strikes, and thunders...  A blurry image comes into your sight from
the sky, but the image isn't clear...  As the image comes near, you can see
that it's really a chopper.  The chopper lands in the garden of the White House, 
and a man in a long coat jumps out of it as soon as it lands.  You wonder what 
all this is about--why would a chopper come to the White House at this hour?
  What's all this about?  I don't know!  It's supposed to be top secret.
Oh well, maybe not, since this is just a game!  Thunderhawk from Virgin Games,
is another imported budget sim, based on some fictional theatres.  This sim
claims to be the ultimate helicopter combat simulator, but...it might have been
the ultimate if it came out about one or two years ago.  In these days, it
just isn't good enough to be the ultimate!
  The introducton is pretty nice with digitized speech, and cartoon-like
graphics and the briefings in campaign mode are informative and explain some
interesting background for each mission.
  As soon as the game starts, you have two options to choose, a sim mode, which
lets you practice in the simulator mode, with several options you can set,
such as difficulty level, time, and theatre you want practice in.  As for the
realism, even in hard mode, most seasoned players will find the control to be
very easy.
  Flight characteristics of the helicopter are very unrealistic. You can make
any bank turns without worrying too much about crashing your helicopter.
Anyway, once you get the hang of it, you can play (you don't have to go
through the simulator mode to play in the campaign mode, though), in the
campaign mode.  It features six campaigns, each comprised of a number of
indivindual missions.  As you progress through the campaign, you will be asked
to perform the roles of ground attack, escort, interceptor, etc.  All the
theatres of each campaign are fictional regions.

  Thunderhawk has the hardest night missions I have ever played.  During the
night missions, you can't see what is in front of you even at VERY close range!
I suppose the programmer wanted to recreate the excitement of real night
missions, however.  The details of ground are not as rich as that of Gunship
2000, from Microprose, and I guess, that's why this sim has such a fast frame
rate!
  To list some positive points about this simulator, it has very fast frame
rate, nice introduction, good story line, and good price.  Except for these
few points, there isn't much thing that this sim can offer.  It also suffers 
from the control keys assignment.  Although, Thunderhawk supports keyboard,
mouse, and joystick, controlling the helicopter with the joystick and
mouse is very awkward (you have to control the collectives and cyclics
with the joystick as well).  By the way, if you have a 386-20 or above, you'd
better turn off the turbo switch, as the screen updates will be very fast!  It
seems that this sim was developed on the 286, so it really flies fast on 386s!
  I can't see any reason why I bought this sim, as I have Gunship 2000, which I
consider a much better product!  (I know, I was too sleepy at the time......)
If I had a 286 or slower machine, then, I might have, but I would still prefer
to buy a helicopter simulator that has more details and runs slower, rather
than one running fast at the expense of details and realism.  This is another
example of a game with good concepts but with poor execution.

Hints or tips
-------------
 
This section is for tips or hints which would be helpful for playing a
flight simulator.  If you have any tips, or hints that might be helpful for
playing any sims, be sure to let me know.  I will publish them for sure.
 
 
  As I promised in the first issue, I have written some more tips for Gunship
2000.
  By the way, what did I write in the first issue???  I am losing my memory....
Oh well, I'd better read the first issue again! (please don't send me any
letters for this...<G>)  Ok, ok, I will get serious!  Hum,hum,hum..
  Here are some tips for Search & Destroy missions.  Most players have trouble
with this mission type, but actualy it is quite easy once you know how to find
the enemy! (Yeah, I know that's the hardest part, so keep reading! <G>) If you
are given a S&D mission, and if the targets are non-moving objects, send your
wingmen in different paths. Each of them should not be too close to each other,
but they shouldn't be too far apart either.  Send each of them around the
targets, covering 2 squares (on the map) from the original location given by
the intelligence report.  Look at the illustration below:

       | _________________________________________________|
    
  Obviously, you have 5 helicopters available, but I drew only 4 of them as
space is limited here.  If you use this techinique, one of your wingmen is
likely to find the target.  Once the location of targets is found, send all
your wingmen there as soon as possible. (This is why they shouldn't be too far
apart from each other). I have been able to complete all my S&D missions
successfully without any losses or failures using this strategy.
  You can also fly at high altitude, but this will expose you to the enemy, and
the targets are usually heavily guarded.  So, it's best to fly as low as
possible.
  If the targets are moving, study the map carefully before starting off.
Look at the direction arrow on the map, and try to predict where they would
end up on the map, while you are flying to the location.  They usually move at
about 1/4 of your normal speed(120). If the targets were moving from the road,
they usually follow the road, and they avoid any mountains, rivers, etc.
If you just can't predict the location of the enemy, use the technique I have
described above, but with some changes.  In fact, the first technique works
almost all the time, even with deep strike missions!  This works, because you
are confusing them by attacking from various points!
  I hope this will work for you too!  As I always say, fly low!!!  I mean ultra
low! <G>

  This is a helpful guide for playing Falcon 3.0 via modem, and if you have
been experiencing problems, this will probably help you to solve them.
 
 
  Below is a quick reference guide for connecting two Falcon .c pilots
through the MTM Lobby.  It is assumed that both players have an upgraded
version of Falcon .c, have a basic knowledge of their communication programs,
and have a general understanding of modem communications.  * Note: To upgrade
to Falcon .c, download FFIXC.ZIP from the Game Publishers Forum (GAMEPUB).
The file is in the Spectrum-Holobyte section of the library.
  First I would like to mention a money saving tip. Call the MTM Lobby at 300
baid to "chat" and arrange a game, then when you are ready to play, call back
at 2400 baud and play the game.  The MTM Lobby does not currently accommodate
baud rates higher than 2400.  * Note: Both players must communicate at the same
speed (baud rate).  Having said that, let us move on to how all this
communication works.
  The part of communications that most people find difficult is exiting from
the communictions software and loading Falcon 3.c WHILE REMAINING ON LINE!!
For Compuserve Information Manager (CIM) version, you must go to the Special
menu and select Session Settings.  Check the Baud rate, Dial Type, and COMM
Port. Select Modem... from this box and remove the +++ from ESCAPE.  (This
enables you to exit from CIM and remain on line).  For other communications
software please consult your manual.  The example of CIM is to show that some
communications software must be set to exit and remain on line before a
connection is established. Once a connection is established, exiting from CIM
will disconnect you from MTM and CompuServe unless you have previously set the
ESCAPE to `nothing'.
  Now that your communications software is set up, call MTM and either issue a
"Challenge", or "Accept" a challenge from your opponent.  As mentioned earlier,
by this time you must have agreed on the game settings.  This step is important
because both players must have chosen the same game settings if they are to
connect sucessfully.  Once a "Challenge" has been "Accepted" MTM connects the
two opponents' computers DIRECTLY together.  * Note: You must set Falcon .c to
DIRECT communications in the COMM Screen when playing on MTM.
  After you have connected directly on MTM, exit from your communications
software and load Falcon .c.  Just follow the instructions in the manual and
you'll soon be at , ft. with a bogey on your six.  Remember to select the
settings correctly...all of them.  If something goes wrong and the program
crashes you'll know because the computer will lock up.  When communications
are going well there are dots that appear on the screen to let you know that
the computer is doing something.  If this happens you'll have to reboot and
call the MTM Lobby back.  Good Luck and happy flying. :)

Beginner's Corner
-----------------
 
  This section is devoted to the beginners who are new to the world of computer
flight simulators.  If you have any questions, be sure to let me know. I will
try to answer all your questions as much as possible.  You can write me at the
address on the last page of this issue.  Once again, if you find anything that
is inaccurate or wrong, please let me know.
 
 
Questions & Answers:
 
Q: What's HOTAS?
A: HOTAS stands for 'Hands On The Throttle And Stick', and it's created by some
   FS Forum members to provide realistic feeling and control for your flight.
   This device will give you much more enjoyment for playing your flight simu-
   lators. (There will be a review of this device in the next issue.)
 
Q: Then, what are FCS, and WCS?
A: FCS, and WCS are made by Thrustmaster Inc, and they stand for
  `Flight Control System', and `Weapon Control System', respectively.  WCS
   provides a convenient way of controlling your weapons, and other functions.
   FCS also provides these functions, but it is also a joy stick and throttle
   controller, as well as giving the ability to do many other things, without
   touching the keyboard.  (This is done by using 8 independent buttons on the
   stick)  If you have one of these, you don't have to buy the other, it's
   usually unnecessary.
 
Q: I have Falcon 3.0, and I heard that there are several patches which fix some
   of the bugs in Falcon.  Is this true? and if so, where can I get them?
A: Yes, this is true, and there are 2 patches available now. They are versions
   `a', and `c'.  Note: Version `b' was skipped due to some problems.  They are
   available on CompuServe Infomation Service, in Spectrum Holobyte Library, in
   Game Publishers' Forum.  If you do not have either version, you should get
   the latest version available, which is version `c' at the moment.  (Refer to
   the hint section for more detail).
 
Q: How do I know whether I have version `a', or `c'?
A: You can find out which version of Falcon you have easily, by invoking
   "dir Falcon3.exe" at the DOS prompt in your Falcon 3.0 directory.
    Look below for the identification:
 
    Size                        Version
    ----                        -------
    1206158 ----------------->  Original Version
    1225284 ----------------->  Version `a'
    1240010 ----------------->  Version `c'
 
                       ********NOTE**********
  If you are upgrading from version `a', you should reinstall the whole game
  before installing the patch.  The readme file included in the patch says,
  you don't have to, but unfortunately you have to do this! :(

Interesting Facts:
 
  This section will deal with some interesting facts of real planes, simulators,
stealth technology, etc.  If you have any interesting stories, or infor-
mation that you would like to share with others, send it to the address
on the last page of this issue.
 
  Do you know why some fighter planes have "Swing Wings", such as F-14 ?  Well,
read on!
  One reason for the swing wing seems intuitively simple for some: it lets the
airplane go faster by swinging resistance out of the way.  It's the same reasoning
a child develops when he rides with his hand out the car window.  When he sticks
his arm straight out the side of the window (at right angles to the direction
the car is moving), he feels greater resistance than when he lets his arm swing
back.
  However intuitive this seems, it isn't the total reason for the swing wing.
There are two major types of drag.  The type that the young child experiences is
called parasite drag.  Parasite drag, sometimes called the "barndoor effect"
increases as the speed increases.  In fact, if the speed is doubled, the parasite
drag is quadrupled.  Halve the speed, and the parasite drag is cut down one
quarter.  It seems logical then, that some parasite drag could be reduced if
the wing were swept, and indeed it does.
  Induced drag is the other form of drag that contributes to the total drag
equation.  Induced drag is associated with lift.  A wing going through the air
disrupts the status quo, just as a rock does when thrown into a pond of still
water.  The air molecules sense that something is coming at them.  They
anticipate that they are going to run over the top of a wing.  This anticipation
of riding over the top of the wing causes the relative wind to come in from a
higher angle than when it was further out in the remote free airstream.  The
wing has to increase its angle of attack to get the relative wind coming straight
across it.  This increased angle tips the lifting force back slightly.  The
difference between the total lift on the wing and the effective lift force is
the induced drag.
  There is a positive pressure on the underside of the wing.  There is also a
negative pressure on the upper surfac of the wing.  Since the pressure is
greater under the wing, it tries to fill the area of less pressure on top.  It
does this by sliding around and over the tip of the wing.  In doing this, it
creates vortices.  This tip vortex combines with the anticipated relative wind
and further aggravates induced drag.
  There are several additional terms necessary to understand the full implication
of the swing wing.  The wing span, b, is roughly the distance from the fuselage
to the tip.  The wing cord, c, is the average distance from the leading edge to
the trailing edge of the wing.  The wing area, s, is simply the number of square
feet, i.e., for a rectangular wing the wing span, b, times the wing cord, c,
S= bxc.  An important term, Aspect Ratio, AR, is the ratio of the span, b, to
the average chord c, AR = b/c.  Aspect Ratio is important because the higher the
aspect ratio, the lower the induced drag.  If two wings have exactly the same
area, they do not necessarily contribute the same amount of lift.  The AR plays
a part.
 

     
                                 Page 11

 
The wing that is short and stubby, i.e., low AR, will create more induced drag
than the wing that is long and slender, the high AR wing.  Another way to say
this is that if two wings have equal area, and are creating equal lift, then
the wing with lower AR must necessarily be at a higher angle of attack.  As
mentioned previously, induced drag is partly a function of wing tip vortices
disrupting the flow at the end of the wing.  Ideally, then the further away from
the lifting part of the wing the disruption occurs, the better.  When the tip
vortices are closer, as they are in a low AR wing, they are proportionally
bigger with respect to the lifting area of the wing.  The closer vortex, creates
a greater disturbance in the downwash, and requires the wing to take a larger
bite of the air, due to a shift in the relative wind.  This larger bite creates
larger tip vortices and so on.  While in level flight parasite drag increases
with higher speed, induced drag decreases.  On the other hand, parasite drag
falls off as speeds lower, while induced drag increases.  Induced drag
increases because at lower speed, the AOA must be increased to maintain the
same lift.  Induced drag is one of the killers in the approach and landing
pattern.
  In the landing pattern, with the wings swept back, the AR would be low, and
induced drag would be high.  To land in this configuration would require the
high angle of attack and the high sink rates that can be developed with delta
wing aircraft.  By sweeping the wings forward, planes with these wings can
land at about 115 knots.  By contrast, most `fixed wing' planes land at about
140 knots.
  What's the advantage of the swing wing?  We can compare two theoretical
airplanes.  These two hypothetical airplanes with wing span, aspect ratio,
fineness ratios, and basic aerodynamic characteristics equal, differ only in
the sweep angle of their wings.
  These characteristics, broken down into operational capabilities for a fighter
airplane, dictate that for low landing speed, maximum range and endurance, high
sustained turn performance, a straight wing is preferred.  For maximum speed
and acceleration, low drag at transonic and supersonic speeds, the highly swept
(low drag) wing is preferable.  The solution is to develop a wing that may be
optimized throughout the operating envelope of the airplane.

Last words from the editor:
---------------------------
 
   Ahhh.....  Finally, I have finished writing the second issue of Take Off!
It was really tough to finish this issue, as I reviewed more flight sims, and
scenery files.  As I write this newsletter, I feel that my knowledge of flight
simulators, and airplanes is getting bigger and bigger.  And, I am glad that
some other people will benefit from (hopefully) reading this newsletter.
  I had to work a lot harder to finish this issue, as I released the March
edition in the last of week of March!  In order to synchronize the newsletter
release date, I had to push myself to finish it as soon as possible.  However,
you will find that (if you have read the first issue) this issue is better than
the first one in many ways.
  One thing that I find difficult about writing the newsletter is that it's
pretty hard to do all the stuff by myself.  I understand that some people think
this is not informative at all for whatever the reason, but if you do not tell
me what you think about the newsletter, there is no way I can improve future
issues.  So, if you have any comments, complaints, or suggestions, do not
hestiate to send them.  I am willing to listen!! <G>
  I am also looking for some people interested in reviewing Scenery Files, and
contributing writers.  If you are interested be sure to contact me.  By the way
it doesn't have to be scenery files, if you want to review any commercial
flight sims, or shareware, that's fine, too.
  Oh, I have a little favor to ask people who read this newsletter.  If you do
not mind, please upload the newsletter to your local BBSs, so that other people
can read it too.  This is another way of helping me and it will eventually,
make the newsletter better in future.
  I would like to express my appreciation to a couple of people: Seth L Turner,
and the assistant editor Lorna Anton.  I thank Seth, for sharing his useful
tips on Falcon 3.0 with other people, and letting me publish it in this issue.
I also thank Lorna for helping me finish writing the newsletter.  If she
didn't help me, you would see many annoying mistakes, such as typos and
grammatical mistakes.  
  Bye, have a nice Easter break!!
