Yeah well these guys laughed all the way to jail. That is what happens to
idiots..

In #2, we WERE to explore a group that has proven to be almost as clever as
NASTY..

Q: Who could be these minds at work?

A: LoL (Legion of Loosers)

They call themselves LoL/PHUCK, I think PKUCK LoL is more like it.

These giants of the industry have been at it for about a year I believe
and when will they stop? NOW I hope, but I don't think we'll be that lucky.

We caught up with Garfield (Sysop of Electric Eye ][) and he had this to say
in response to the question: "What do you think of LoL?"

He replied with "I ain't Garfield and I'm not sayin nuthin"

(I guess we're as popular as we thought)


Instead.. It has come to my attention that there are a new group of Nasties
at it.. (eh eh)

Q: Really? Who?

A: AXiS/MoF

Q: WHO!?

A: AXiS/MoF

Q: Who the fuck are they?

A: A group of "hackers" / VMB D00dz

Q: Oh...


Well to start it off, here is their greeting... What men!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello we are the new [YEAH, OBVIOUSLY NOT ESTABLISHED] Phreaking, Hacking [AS
IF THEY COULD], and Carding [WHAT!?!? HALLMARK CARDS???] group around, In our
newsletters we will tell you about all kinds of fun ILLEGAL [AS IF THEY ACTUALLY
HAD SOME ABILITIES...] stuff to do icluding valid codez [WHO WANTS DEAD CODES!],
cardz, [EMPHASIZE THE ZZZZZZZ'ZZZZZ] systems to hack, and all kinds of other
shit. We will try to come out with a newsletter at least once every two weeks
[YEAH, THAT IS WHAT THEY ALL SAY - PERSONALLY I ENJOY SEEING AXiS FILES,
BECAUSE AFTER YOU PRINT THEM OUT AND LAUGH AT THEM, YOU CAN USE THEM FOR A WIDE
VARIETY OF RECREATIONAL PURPOSES FROM ASS WIPING TO KINDLING] or so. If you
would like to become a member of or contribute articles to the newsletter
there's a form included (regaxis.app) and after you fill it out try to u/l it
to one of the AXiS boards.  And to get the newest newsletters out by us call
one of our bbs's.  We are also looking for some (out of Wa.) bbs's to be AXiS
nodes and distribute our shit. [THAT IS TRUE, THESE FILES ARE S-H-I-T] Thanks
[NO PROBLEM GUYS, I ALWAYS ENJOY PUTTING DOWN SUBHUMAN LIFE FORMS]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After AXiS got organized, they teamed up with MoF- here is the result.  Oh
also, remember, MoF is the best COMMODORE phreak group in the world [or so
they say, so all respectable Commie h/per's get PISSED..

              Axis/M.O.F. presents :        The Monitor

Some damn good scanning [YEAH, REAL HARD WORK] done by the hack god [LOSER IS
MORE LIKE IT.  WHO GETS IMPRESSED BY SOMEONE WHO CAN FIND A FEW CARRIERS?  BIG
DEAL...] himself ... G-String... [I SUPPOSE JOCKSTRAP HACKS THESE CARRIERS..]

Re-Written in this lame ass ansi shit [I AGREE, ANYONE WHO MAKES H/P TFILES
IN ANSI IS SAD.  OF COURSE, WHO CONSIDERS AXiS WORKS H/P ORIENTED.  MORE LIKE
COMEDY RELIEF] by: Desolation
alright..lets get down to some scanned shit...

                 Carriers at these numbers:
                1-800-955-XXXX  1034,1056,1057,1058.... 1600

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, these guys appear to be as bright as a burnt out lightbulb.  Let's see
some more of their Tom Foolery, and notice what experts and electronical
geniuses they real aren't...

Blue boxing has been dead for many years. [NO SHIT.  ANYONE IN ESS KNOWS
THAT.  WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE IN XBAR AND OVERSEAS - e.g. HOLLAND.  THESE GUYS
DON'T DO THEIR RESEARCH VERY WELL...]  Red and Green boxes are the new
blue boxes which work! [REALLY!  I ALWAYS THOUGHT A THAT BLUE BOXING AKA
TRUNK DROPPING IS A 2600 Hz TONE... RED BOX IS 1700/2100 Hz.  THEY ARE THE
SAME??]  They work on any fortress phones. [WHAT ABOUT COCOTS!  NEVER CAN
TELL...]  And in case you don't know what a blue box is it's a box which makes
sound into a pay phone, recordings of quartes being put in, [TIME OUT!!!
THAT IS A RED BOX.  CAN'T THESE GUYS GET ANYTHING STRAIGHT!] which allows you
to get all the long distance you wish for free

Part 1) A recorder which you can hook directly into a phone line.  If you use
a regular recorder you will have to make some small modifactions to it.  If
you have an answering machine you got it made!
[OK, I WILL JUST DRAG MY ANSWERING MACHINE TO THE NEAREST PAYPHONE...]

2) Find a fortress phone and follow the metal pipe from the phone to where
ever it ends up.  At some point on the pipe, there will be a small box which
 is held together by two screws,  unscrew the box.

[HOLD ON... THAT IS TRUE, BUT TO RED BOX, THERE IS NO NEED FOR WIRE
ACCESS... READ TAP MAGIZINE AND FUCKING LEARN SOMETHING AX-HOLES!]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Next, let us take a journey through their newest and only file (*):

I have previewed about 6 lines of this baby and I KNEW we had to make
a file out of it.. Its rather "bonehead" if I may say so...

Comments inside "["'s are made by LoST

* - Editor's Note - We consider this their only TRUE file that is in
ascii!  Wowie Zowie!  Instead of that fucking lame half assed ansi that
the other 4 are.

NEW ADDITION AS OF APRIL 1, 1991!!!

     Axis has now merged with M.O.F. (Ministry of Fear) of the commodore
realm.  We have now expanded with them, so we are pretty much a kicking group
now.  There will be a full detailed listing of all the members, etc.  So
be aware of that. [OH YES, I'M EXCITED ALREADY]
The group will have 2 names, but one group. [OH GOODIE] It will still
be M.O.F. and it will still be Axis, just one group.[THANKS FOR CLEARING THAT
UP SO I CAN SLEEP TONIGHT]
Call the Axis/M.O.F. commodore Headquarters:

gee whiz kids... that was real keen.. They sound like they have a real
plan.. lesse:

scam cash
scam free stuffs
run a vmb
and trade codes

Oh yea.. this sounds like the beginning to something big and new.
And the great thing is, they're based in the hacker capitol of 206land!

Lets see, theyve already listed 3 wareZZzz bbss as HQ's and listed people
as Warez "guys" but YET they say "Down with warez"

now.... is it just me or do these guys sound like they dont know what
theyre doing? They are a prime example of an oxymoron, or JUST PLAIN moron
in their case.

As I look through my AXIS package I'm encountered with about 20 BBS ANSI
ads (starting to remind me of the old winners SoC and theyre breathtaking
"get cc, order, pick up" carding file) and an ANSI I dont think I PERSONALLY
could do without labeled "Extenders.ans" listing various extenders such as
950-1033, 800-433-4778, gee those are real goodies.. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK
BOYS.. I sure am glad to be enlightened to some 2-3 year old extenders.

As I skip to my highly convenient RED1.ans (Gee I'm oh so glad they make
all their files in ANSI, its so keen) I see this soon to be famous qoute

"Red and green boxes are the new blue boxes which work!"

That is highly informative.. thank you... yes and included is a 3
page ANSI description of a red box basically saying THIS in _3_ pages:

"record a quarter tone of a payphone and play it back when it asks for
 money to place a call"

THERE.... you dont need to tell people how to FIND a payphone.. good god.
we're not as stupid as the average AXIS/MOF member for christ sake!!


Getting a dir on my other machine I notice a "RUNTHIS.BAT" (b-duh, tanks
for tellin me) After ANOTHER ad for thaty godawful Apopazit now I see
"Some damn good scanning done by the hack god himself....G-String.."

Yea, he goes way back.. what a god figure to us all.. why.. he managed
to find a list of 6 800 carriers to contribute to this AXIS mastermind
file!

oh goodie.. heres a list of VMB Systems these guys have listed.. Yay.

I then see before my eyes a list of 2 credit cards.. lets see.. I go
through more than 2 each DAY.

They're wonderful ANSI comes to a close with the following rumours:

713's tracing
426's tracing
346's getting harder
225's getting harder [225-_5946_!?!?]

this is extremely enlightening.. Thank you for the inside info.

The greatness trails off with a powerful closing statement:

"Look for all of our fucking rad new shit."

oh... we will...

Last but not least... we will explore the Axis APPLICATION form.
Let's have a look shall we?

Conclusion:

You might say Axis is a bunch of no talent idiots... well... your right.
They are full of contradictions, down with warez! we hate warez, if you
have uncrakced warez please u/l, etc etc.

Suggestions:

1. I am at a total and complete loss
2. SysOps, append your TRASHCAN.TXT files, and add their whole member list.
3. These guys should invest in some stuff... Spell checker, grammar checker,
   brain...

In final conclusion, if ANYONE has heard of ANY of these people.. I will
be surprised:

Member list: Desolation, G-String, Artifact, Night's Shadow, The Tall Man,
             Cerebrum, Wrong Way, Effendi, Terminator, ELectron, The Guardian
             Bounty Hunter (the famed warez d00d!?), Tyrant, Skull Krusher
             (my personal favorite), Mayhem, Violator, Night Chill

4. If these guys produce AXiS #6 after this has been distributed on all those
   k-k00l mediums of which AXiS knows so much of [BitNet, FTP sites, ***NON
   206 bulletin boards***, real hack/phreak systems, etc].  I then say, we
   will further entertain you with yet another LoST production.

Oh yeah... These guys are real winners.. I've seen them all over the place.


Oh well..Anyway.. This has been LoST Production #2....
