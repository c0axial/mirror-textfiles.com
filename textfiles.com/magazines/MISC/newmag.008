it seems that in each and every release that mogel seems to pump out 
lately has me portrayed as a pill popping druggie and mercuri as a 
phanboy of mine... well, that's not so... you see...

I LOVE MERCURI!@  I FOLLOW HIM EVERY-DAY!@

%%%[ ode to mercuri

oh mercuri, you are so nice
you smell good, you are my spice
i love you, and you're on #zines
you are the best, ostioperosis

%%%[ how many ways do i love thee?

oh mercuri, how many ways do i love thee?  let me count the ways,

1. the way you saunter into #zines
2. the way you are parodied in each mogel text file
3. the way you are happy to see in in #zines
4. i couldn't think of a #4, so there
5. i just love you
