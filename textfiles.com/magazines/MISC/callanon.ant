INTRODUCTiON...                 

  In a lot of places, the easiest way to get Caller ID Block is to dial *67 
 before you dial the number you wish to call. There are a few things you may
 want to know about this:

 1. If the number you call has the last caller call-back feature, well it is
 not affected by this in the LEAST. The person hits *-whatever and your phone
 is going to ring, no getting around that feature as far as I know.
 2. Doing this is NOT going to stop an ANI from identifying your number and
 it sure as hell wouldn't block a line trace.
 3. This is not going to work in some areas.

  Now, if you live in an area where dialing *67 does nothing, than you can 
 still have all the privacy with none of the hassle! The first chapter of 
 this text is going to deal with getting it if you don't have it. Then the
 second chapter is going to deal with tips on calling anonymously! Read on!

CHAPTER ONE...

  Okay, when I first heard that there was such a thing as Caller ID Block (I
 doubt the telco people call it that, it is probably something fancy), I knew
 only of the *67 method. I tried *67, it didn't work in my area...well, that
 was okay with me, I had wanted to talk to somebody at telco all day anyway.
  I got an operator, she switched me to the billing office or something, then
 a very nice and overly talkative lady asked me what she could do for me. I
 told her a little story that went like this:

  "Hi, I am planning on calling a number that has Caller Id and complaining
 about something to somebody there. The office I am calling does not have my
 number and I would much appreciate if they didn't have it so that they will
 not be able to make harassing phone calls to my house once I call."

  I'm not a half bad liar and lying to telco people is A-Okay in my book. So
 She told me that they had a provision for this, explained what it did and 
 did not do, asked me if I wanted it and if I was the owner of the phone (I
 was not, but I did, so I said "yes" to both questions). She then tells me 
 that my phone will have this Caller Id Block by the close of business the
 next day. Now, was that easy or what? I don't even have to dial *67...
CHAPTER TWO...

  There a couple of other things that take no real ability or effort to do
 and help to make your calling a little more anonymous...

é When you call collect, don't go for the "COLLECT" when the automated voice
 ask you to say one of the fallowing words...say "OPERATOR". Then when you 
 get the operator, tell her you would like to place an anonymous collect call
 and she can handle that for you. When the person gets a bill, they only get
 your AC, exchange, and the next 2 digits (XXX-XXX-XX??), this puts you into
 the one in 100 range, but unless you are sending death threats to diplomats,
 they will never know who you were. (as long as they didn't know your number
 well and guess who you are, in which case, don't bother with this)
é Call through a PBX, but of course you realize that 1 in 50 calls are traced
 (or so I heard) which means %2 of the calls are traced.
é Call through a dial-out.
é Use a diverter.
é Call from a payfone=] (this is probably safest=>)
é When you call an 800 number (try not to anyway) to hack a VMG, for God's
 sake don't keep hanging up and calling back constantly for days, somebody is
 bound to notice the amounts of calls and you ruin everything for everyone!
Afterword...
 
  That was a couple of things to do (or NOT to do) that you may or may not
 have thought about. The second chapter was lacking in great originality and
 absent of any real detail, but so? Anyway, you also have to keep in mind who
 you are calling, I believe places with ESS log your calls for 6 months or
 something, but this is good for keeping annoying piss ant 12 yr old sysops
 from calling you back when you just hung up in the middle of the 21 question
 new user form that reaks of WaReZ pupness (wow, can you say /<-R4/] ?=])
