"Sorry"
Angela DiFabio  

My twist of emotions change everyday -- I don't even know what I feel
I never meant for it to turn out this way -- I'm sorry
Looking back I want to be justified. But there is no justification...for me -- I'm sorry
I was born with you.
I AM you. I won't sever our ties together again -- I'm sorry
I will remember this as my feelings bang away at the corners of my mind. 
For this eternity -- I'm sorry

Crome Interview
Dave Konopscotch

   A few weeks ago I sat down with guitarists Todd and Mike, bassist Max, 
drummer  Dave, and vocalist Pete...aka Crome, a band with an uncanny knack 
for variety. With a new CD in the works for Sept '95, the group serenaded me 
with a few of their new acoustic tracks. I then sampled a few of their harder 
electric tunes.  I must say I was impressed. We settled in a for little Q & A 
session and here's a taste.
PLuM: To start off, what kind of band do you consider yourselves?
Pete: Well, we don't really like to classify ourselves. We like to play a 
      variety of different sounds.
Todd: Basically, our music is rooted in emotion and mood. How we feel is how 
we play. Our new CD is an even mix of gentle acoustic and rough electric.
Mike: Songs come to us real quick. Sometimes we'll just be sitting around 
jamming and Todd will hit some notes and I'll strike a chord, then Pete 
formulates the words and suddenly we've got a song. 
PLuM: Who were you guys influenced by musically?
Dave: Iron Maiden. 
Mike: The Chile Peppers, the Police.
Pete: Pearl Jam, the Doors.
Max: Definitely Primus and Flea.
Todd: Quicksand, Dave Matthews. As you can see we really don't have a 
collective favorite group. I think that's what makes us so versatile.
PLuM: Well how did you guys end up together?
Mike: Well that is a LONG story...I guess it all started when Todd and I were 
freshmen at Bensalem High School. He and a friend asked me to play in their 
band. We shifted alot, constantly moving people in and out, changing our name 
from Adversary to Sponge and finally to Crome. We had gotten a new singer 
named Andy, Crome was set. We made a demo and played a few battle-of-the-bands 
shows, the TROC,  the Cellblock, and some parties. Then we found out Andy had 
to go away to college in August so we let him go and hired Pete so we could 
make our new CD. 
PLuM: Do you guys feel any competition from other local bands such as Shallow?
Todd: Not really, Crome and Shallow are two completely different types of 
sound. We like Shallow alot but it's two totally different worlds.
Pete: We have alot of faith in our music. We've spent over five years working 
up to this point, we're proud of what we accomplished. We aren't on some ego 
trip, we just have alot of confidence in our work.  

Don't forget to check out Crome at Discconnections Aug. 20. For info on how 
to get tickets or for band info, call Todd Miller at 757-5076.        

PJ Harvey Review
Dave Konopka

     Violins, violas, and cellos.  What more could you ask for?  Poly-Jean (better known as P.J.) Harvey's latest release, To Bring You My Love, has it all.  When I first got the CD I was instantly locked into the radio release, "Down By the Water."  After a half hour of "Little fish, big fish..." I swam on and was delighted with the things I heard.
     In many ways, My Love is alot like P.J.'s earlier release, Rid of Me, but Harvey continually reinvents herself on each track of My love, wonderfully shifting from the grungey electric guitar riffs of "Meet Ze Monsta" to the delicate mix of violin and acoustic guitar on "Send His Love To Me."
     If you are in the mood for some emotional music and driving lyrics, I encourage you to give Poly-Jean a chance and check out To Bring You My Love.

"The Circus"
Melissa Richards  

do you like the Show?
everybody loves the Circus
i put it on just for you
all your favorites, under one big tent

come inside, see the sights
all of this fun is for your amusement
just don't get lost
things get a bit wild at the Circus

look up above; it's a Tight-rope Walker
she looks a bit unsteady, i hope she doesn't fall and break her neck
and over there is the Side Show, the collection of Freaks
all the mutants and perversions that no one wants for you to stare and laugh at

i hope you enjoyed your visit
come back soon and i'll put on the Show for you again
always just what you want to see
isn't that what the circus is for?

Phat Poem
Matt Lydon

leaves of a tree float to the ground
the death of a leaf that makes no sound
like when the tree falls in the forest with no one around
i'll be there

i hate the mimes of modern day
the only thing they do is play
they annoy me til the judgement day
they're so square

i went to work and i got drunk 
i came home and drove over a skunk
my mom told me that i stunk
damn that black and white hair

so i sit content to be 
whatever i need and i'll need what i be
did that make sense, no sireee
but i don't think anybody cares.

She
Aaron J. Brown

She is there
Standing before me
Waiting for something
I seem not to know what
But, I do
The only problem is
Which thought is it
Does she want to love me??
Or kiss me,
No, if it was only a kiss
We would be deeply embraced
I see hope in her eyes
What is she hoping for??
I want her near
I need to have her love
I know I will never get it
That is the hope in MY eyes
To hold her in my arms
until time ends 
and beyond
To feel a loving embrace
I would be forever happy!!
Unfortunately, as we all know
I will never be happy...

 Attention Girrrrrls!
Angela DiFabio
   Hello out there in srrrrrly land!  Or is anyone out there??  I have been 
   looking for some cool girls that wanna start a band but it seems that they 
   are non-existent.  However, I have found basically two types of girls that 
   actually show any interest at all. The first type just wants to be the lead 
   singer and litl' Miss Courtney Love.  They expect everything to happen 
   right now but they don't expect  to do any work to make things happen...OK!
   Then there is the girl that says, "Oh I really wanna be in a band but I 
   can't play anything."  After about a month of this girl saying she is 
   learning drums I find out she doesn't even have a set of drum sticks! What 
   I'm  trying to say to girls is to pick up an instrument!!!  Making music 
   isn't just for boys but you gotta realize that it isn't easy either.  If 
   you're too busy then don't bother saying you wanna be in a band.  If 
   you're too lazy to carry your big, heavy instrument to practice -- then 
   don't come!  Playing music is fun but it takes allot of work.  So girls, 
   go out, pick up an instrument, show everyone what you can do.

"Hole" 
Melissa Richards  

I'm screaming my heart out
    but you can't hear a sound
I'm too deep to be heard

I didn't pay attention to where I wandered
    and I blissfully fell into this hole
I've tried to get out, but failed

I never once noticed the gaping hole in front of me
    the candy coating hid it from view
I was lured in by it's sweetness

I've fallen too deep
    and I hurt myself on the way down
I guess I dug my hole too well

Shallow Preview
Dave Konopka

  On August 13, Kevin, Lou, Harris, Mike, and Jeoff (Shallow) will play their last performance together.  The band is splitting up to allow Kevin, Lou, and Harris to travel to college in the fall.  All three were high ranking Bensalem High School students and place education as their primary goal over music. Mike and Jeoff both attend local colleges and will remain to play in local band Shell Culture (scheduled to play the TROC on Aug. 25).
   Shallow's new album, To Trust is Sometimes To Surrender, is selling well according to  Michael Harrington of the band's record label, Triquetra.  "Shallow's become widespread, the album has almost reached it's second print."  Shallow is also featured on Triquetra's live compilation due out in the early fall. Be sure to check out Shallow's final performance at Disc/connections on Aug. 13. Tickets are $3. Call 639-ROCK for details.
   Look for the exclusive final backstage interview with Shallow in the next issue of the Plum.

BBS'in
Dave Konopka

    It's 2am do you know where your kids are?? Well if you have a modem, 
    there's a good chance that they're surfing BBS's.  Bulletin Board Systems 
    (BBS's) have quickly become a popular on-ramp to the information 
    superhighway.  A BBS is quite simply a databank that users can dial into 
    with their home computer and benefit from a number of services.  BBS's 
    are run by Systems Operators (Sysop's) who regulate users and maintain the board.  Most BBS's offer free trial access and subscription fees are usually very low (five or ten dollars).  Users usually create a handle that they use instead of their real name for privacy.
   One popular BBS function is teleconferencing.  Users from all over connect into one BBS and type messages to each other, a practice known as "Chatting".  Some BBS are part of a "Net".  In this case, users can "chat" with people world-wide in seconds.
    Another popular BBS function is known as a Forum.  A forum is a base where users can read and write messages to each other pertaining to a specific topic.  For example, ACiD PLuM maintains a forum on a local bulletin board.  People leave poetry and stories that they wish to submit to the Plum and have access to the text portions of past issues.  Forums are an excellent way to find  information on a specific topic.
   On-line, users play interactive games with other users.  Most are role-playing, dungeons and dragons text style games, some are trivia type, still others are card/board type games such as monopoly.  Many users come together and have on-line competitions, with each player reaching for the best score.
    BBS's carry many files available for download.  Users can access 
    e-'zines; specialized on-line magazines, pictures, games, and other 
    software for private use.  Many BBS's require that a user contribute as much as they download.
    BBS's are fun and easy way to access information and interact with others.  I suggest, if you have a modem, to check out the selected BBS numbers.  If you have any questions mail them to the PLuM or look for Muffin or ACiD PLuM on-line! Good Luck!

Swamp (Dreams 2)
Dave Konopka (Mike Tillison)

   I didn't want to dive.  I always stood at the water's edge, looking, wondering.  The water was so dark, murky, never stirring.  I couldn't see any life down there, but I'm sure there was some, I wouldn't be among them if there was.  Just then, a friend had come, unknown to me.  We spoke for hours, in all eight.  We stood at the edge.  I told her of my fears, my dread of the swampy depths.  Her arms embraced me, encircling my soul, enticing my trust.  With a wave of her arm, she closed my eyes.  A chill filled the air, but she told me of the sun, its warmth, its security.  I smiled, I believed. I knew she'd never go.  The forest floor plush with grass fell out from beneath my feet with a sudden blow to my back.  I was consumed by the tarry gook, she had pushed me in.  I kicked, I yelled...she smiled.  "It's not that bad..." she said, "Everything's OK!"  She threw me a three foot rope...she knew I was six feet away.  She left. I watched, all the while sinking deeper and deeper. 

Mother
Crazycool

A death grows
inside me
a rotting corpse
living with guilt and fear
her voice like a syringe piercing through my temples she screams
NO, she doesn't scream
she speaks
the echo of her horrid babble screams at me
i crawl into my grave
and curl up in a warm ball
ignore the plea
I lay in the feathers of life
until the day is through
when i can forever rest in peace

"Anatomy"
Angela DiFabio  

Always researching
Always questioning
Things so simple you twist
Everything becomes complex
Charging me with your magic microscope
You put me in water between two glass walls and observe
I want to watch love and death and you condem me for it
"I'm disappointed in you" you say
While I lie in the disecting tray you cut me open
You find butterflies in my stomach,
Dreams in my brain,
Love for you, in my heart.
But you see all these things as trash
Diseased and rotten
You discard my organs
Ripping for you own pleasure and curiosity
When you find what you were probing for you understand
You finally understand me! But its too late. So you throw me away and clean your tools.
