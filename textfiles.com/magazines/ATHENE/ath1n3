 ======================================================================         
                                                                                
      First, I want to thank everyone for waiting the extra week for            
 this month's issue of Athene.  I normally try to get the magazine out          
 during the first weekend of the month, but school and work forced me           
 to delay it by a week this time.  I'm confidant that December's issue          
 will be on time, even though it is only a couple weeks away.                   
                                                                                
      Since the last issue, I polled the readers of the plain text              
 edition of Athene for their opinion of the magazine's appearance.              
 From that response, that version of Athene will no longer have                 
 justified paragraphs.  It makes it easier to read on a display                 
 terminal, and it also makes it easier on those people who reformat             
 Athene for their own printers.  Thanks to everyone who responded!              
                                                                                
      Getting feedback from the readers is a great experience, and I            
 encourage you to contact me if you have coments relating to any aspect         
 of Athene.  I'd like to make this magazine as responsive to *your*             
 needs as possible.  In fact, I'm looking for a new logo, and I am open         
 to suggestions from the readers.                                               
                                                                                
      Here we are in issue three, and yet two of this month's stories           
 were submitted back before issue one!  In fact, "Final Memories" and           
 "Fundamentally Switzerland" were the first two stories Athene ever             
 received.  I want to thank Keith and Barbara for their great stories           
 and patience.                                                                  
                                                                                
      We also have an interesting story from the driving force behind           
 Quanta, Dan Appelquist.  "Winds" has a unique narrative style that             
 forces us to consider how we would react in extremem circumstances.            
 "I considered first person but it wasn't powerful enough," Dan says.           
 "The reader could still say ''I'd never do anything like that.'' With          
 the second person narration style, the narrator is telling *you* that          
 *you're* doing these things and that way you're forced to think about          
 it more, and doubt whether you couldn't be like that too."                     
                                                                                
      Also, after last month's excellent story "Solitaire," Garry Frank         
 gives us yet another good one with "Hampton Cafe."                             
                                                                                
      With these stories, I think that this issue was well worth the            
 wait.  Thanks again,

      I am tired and I hurt.  What's the saying?  Mother come take me           
 home?  Strange that I should die now when I am just coming to terms            
 with what I am.  Still, I do not think I would mind dying if only it           
 didn't hurt so much.

      Overhead I can feel the moon calling to me as I stretch my stiff          
 limbs.  I did not sleep well last night.  The hunger seemed to gnaw at         
 my bones and kept me from having a proper rest.  I must do something           
 to satisfy my curse but not yet, not yet.                                      
                                                                                
      I finger my crucifix ruefully.  He who visited this damnation on          
 me was destroyed by merely being in the same room as one but it seems          
 to have no power over me.  In truth I obtained this one in the hopes           
 that it would kill me but such was not my fate.  Perhaps it is because         
 I have never been what mortals believe.  I feel the beginnings of              
 despair and know I must seek the night and find release.                       
                                                                                
      I let change sweep over me and when it is done I bound up and out         
 through the basement window.  At the sight of the moon a keen howl             
 wells up in my throat but I hold it back.  This is neither the place           
 nor the time.                                                                  
                                                                                
      It is but a short run to where my love lies buried, murdered by           
 the foul creature that took me.  Ah my love, you were the fortunate            
 one.  Surely death can not be worse than what I must endure but endure         
 it I must.  Though I have tried to take what little there is of my             
 life, it resists most hardily.  Neither sunlight nor holy signs nor            
 running water seem capable of destroying me and I cannot bring myself          
 to employ more drastic measures.  Surely this is Hell, to abhor one's          
 self but not be able to do anything about it.  Now my love I must              
 leave.  The hunger grows too strong and I fear the pain of it might            
 make me hurt someone.                                                          
                                                                                
      I head for the park.  Not too long ago I caught a pair of rabbits         
 there.  Perhaps tonight I shall have similar luck.                             
                                                                                
      I hear them first; the soft padding of tennis shoes and the sharp         
 click of high heels.  Then I scent them, one has a decidedly masculine         
 smell while from the other wafts the delicate scent of some perfume.           
 Before I see them I know what to expect; two kids, probably from the           
 local college, out on a date, going for a romantic stroll by moonlight         
 in the park.  In short, fresh blood for the likes of me.                       
                                                                                
      My pulse quickens with the thought of the hot, rich, red liquid           
 coursing down my throat.  I catch myself as I begin to edge forward.           
 If I am not careful my instincts will get the better of me.  It would          
 be so easy, the humans never take any real precautions against such as         
 I and they are easier to catch than the animals which are my normal            
 fare but no, I will not give in to the hunger, I cannot.  I hate what          
 I am but I have to live with it and with myself.  And so I ease myself         
 back into the shadows as the humans come round a hedge.  I was right,          
 just a couple of college kids out to have a good time.  Silently I             
 wish them luck for I envy them their innocence.                                
                                                                                
      Then I see the wino that is no wino.  He wears the ragged clothes         
 of a street bum.  In one arm he cradles a bottle of Muscatel, of which         
 he reeks.  A battered hat shields his face from the street lights,             
 hiding it in shadow.  A good enough disguise to fool a human but not           
 enough to trick my senses.  Silently I laugh, where is the smell of            
 old vomit and urine that normally accompany such as you?  You cannot           
 fool me, old friend, for you and I are brothers.  I see the gleam of           
 hunger in your shadowed eyes, the glistening tip of your tongue as you         
 moisten your lips in anticipation.  I know what you are feeling so             
 intimately for I too just felt it.  But you are one of the weak ones           
 or worse, one of the ones that glories in such things as what we are.          
                                                                                
      He has been lying on the bench so still that the couple has not           
 noticed him.  Maybe they think he is asleep.  Maybe they were so               
 wrapped up in each other that they didn't see him.  Whatever the case,         
 they know he is there now as he lurches to his feet, hands reaching            
 out to grab and hold.  The boy, brave in his ignorance, shoves the             
 girl back and moves between her and the wino.  Undaunted the wino              
 lashes out, his hand a blur, to smash aside the boy with inhuman               
 strength.  The lad lies still where he falls, unconscious, possibly            
 dead.  Now the wino glides toward the girl, relishing the terror which         
 holds her paralyzed.  He opens his mouth in a leer and she screams at          
 the sight of his fangs.                                                        
                                                                                
      I am the wind as, on shadow silent paws, I rush past her to hurl          
 myself at the wino.  My jaws snap at his throat but it is no longer            
 there as he becomes mist.  Then it is another wolf that faces me.  We          
 circle each other warily for a moment.  I stop between him and the             
 girl.  He hungrily eyes the boy, then changes again; this time his             
 shape flows into that of a bat, and he flies away.  I consider                 
 pursuing the abomination but, no I must help the humans.                       
                                                                                
      ``Good boy,'' comes the girl's voice.  I turn to face her.  She           
 smells of fear but she is unwilling to leave the boy.  She moves               
 slowly towards him, trying not to spook me.  She is brave like the             
 boy.  I change and it catches her by surprise.  Before she can                 
 remember the legends, I trap her eyes with my own.  I remake history.          
 When I am done she remembers nothing of what has happened.  I release          
 her and turn to examine the boy.  He still lives.  With rest he will           
 recover.                                                                       
                                                                                
      I hear the sound of running feet.  People coming to investigate           
 the girl's screams.  I stand and nod at the girl, then fade into the           
 night.                                                                         
                                                                                
      It is late and I still haven't eaten.  I must do something soon           
 or the hunger will consume me.  But for now I am satisfied.  I am              
 nosferatu and I am human.                                                      
                                                                                
                                 * * *                                          
                                                                                
      A lot of people are afraid of death but I am not.  I came to              
 realize early on that death is inevitable; nothing lives forever.              
 Perhaps I shall see my love when I die.  I hope so.                            
                                                                                
                                 * * *                                          
                                                                                
      ``I love the night.'' Lynn laughs and her eyes seem to sparkle in         
 the moonlight.  ``I don't know why.  It just seems like the darkness           
 sets my spirit free.  I feel like I'm bursting with energy.  I want to         
 run and jump and shout for joy.'' Suddenly I am serious.  ``Lately I           
 feel that way a lot.  Whenever I'm with you.''                                 
                                                                                
      ``You've been watching too many old movies,'' jibes Lynn as she           
 gives my hand a squeeze.                                                       
                                                                                
      I grimace and moan, ``The lady doth wound me deeply.  I confess           
 my love and she laughs at me.''                                                
                                                                                
      ``Pardon me, kind sir.  How may I make amends?''                          
                                                                                
      ``If you would dance with me it might ease the pain some small            
 degree.''                                                                      
                                                                                
      Lynn laughs, ``Here on the sidewalk?  With no music?''                    
                                                                                
      ``Of course not,'' I exclaim.  ``What do you take me for?  A              
 fool?  No, don't answer that.  I mean on yonder hill in the faery ring         
 that crowns it.  There we can dance to the strains of an elvish                
 band.''                                                                        
                                                                                
      ``Has anyone ever told you that you're strange?''                         
                                                                                
      ``Of course, many a time.  I'll have you know that I work very            
 hard to make people think I'm strange.'' We are young and in love.             
 The night is full of silver magic.                                             
                                                                                
      Our waltz is interrupted by a dog's howl.  Lynn shivers so I pull         
 her close.  From behind me comes a growling sound and Lynn suddenly            
 stiffens.  I turn to find myself facing a wolf.  Once more it growls           
 and then it takes a step forward.  Pushing Lynn behind me I say,               
 ``Just stay calm and don't make any sudden moves.'' The wolf's muscles         
 seem to bunch and then it leaps upon me.  Startled I fall backwards.           
 My head strikes something cold and hard.  Unfriendly blackness                 
 consumes me.  The last thing I hear is Lynn screaming.                         
                                                                                
                                 * * *                                          
                                                                                
      When I awoke Lynn was dead, her throat torn away, and I was a             
 vampire.  I begin to laugh but it only makes the pain worse so I stop.         
 Funny how the past always returns to haunt you.  As if my life was not         
 already more horrid than I can bear.  The kids in the park reminded me         
 so much of Lynn and myself that I had to track down their attacker and         
 destroy him as I did the other.  I never thought I'd die doing so.             
 For a moment I gather my strength and then once more pull on the               
 wooden shaft which pins me to the wall like an insect.  It is to no            
 avail.  I look down at the pile of dust which is my murderer.  He made         
 the mistake of coming close to taunt me.  He never expected one of his         
 own kind to be carrying holy water.  Still, his is the last laugh.             
 His death was relatively swift and less painful than mine.                     
                                                                                
      Outside the window the day grows brighter.  I have to smile.  My          
 last sight will be sunrise.  The first light of morning touches me.            
 It seems to soothe me as a numbness radiates through my body from its          
 gentle caress.  The air grows hazy with sparkling motes of dust.  Is           
 my body crumbling away into nothing?  I can't feel anything.  About me         
 the world dissolves.                                                           
                                                                                
      Who's there?  I can feel your presence.  Lynn?  Lynn...

 ======================================================================         
                                                                                
      He was a small man, no taller than a boy of fourteen, but he              
 carried himself with an air of contentment and virility that made him          
 hard to forget.  I do not know his name, and I do not ever wish to.  I         
 met him for the first and only time in a small cafe near Hampton, a            
 place I would often escape to when I needed to be alone.  Hampton was          
 peaceful, and the cafe even more so.                                           
                                                                                
      It was not uncommon for me to spend hours of my time sipping              
 coffee and twiddling my spoon in a small, deserted booth in the south          
 corner.  It was a special place to me, a place I could go to be                
 thoughtful or dreamy.  Or in this case, sorrowful.                             
                                                                                
      I had gone to Hampton on the afternoon of October 12, 1981, two           
 days after the death of my brother, Matthew.  I had gone to the                
 funeral almost completely alone, since he and I were the last                  
 remaining members of our family, having been the only sons of a man            
 who was an only child.  That man, my father, had attained his own date         
 of mourning in the cafe some years earlier.                                    
                                                                                
      I invited none of my friends, not even Matthew's, and I wonder            
 sometimes if I hadn't intentionally avoided informing everyone but a           
 small handful of people about his death.  I do not like to cause any           
 more grief in the world than I have to.                                        
                                                                                
      I am not obsessed with death.  I think that I may have been the           
 only person at the funeral who truly accepted the concept of Matthew           
 being dead, and the peace that such a thing should bring.  All the             
 same, this acceptance did not stifle my need to escape to the cafe, to         
 my special table, sip coffee, and think.                                       
                                                                                
      The waitress gave me no more attention than she would give any            
 other patron and did not recognize me.  Nor did she make the                   
 connection between my face and the particular table at which I was             
 seated, the same table I had always selected for almost six years now.         
 The coffee was black and strong, and I had to mix several packets of           
 sugar with it to make it tolerable.  It cooled in the stagnant cafe            
 atmosphere, and when the steam had completely departed, it revealed            
 the old man, standing less than seven feet from my table, staring at           
 my coffee.                                                                     
                                                                                
      He was wearing an old but intact gray two piece suit.  His                
 stature was wide, and his shoulders broad, but he still had an aura of         
 humility about him that I could not explain.  His face gave away his           
 age, which was in the mid-seventies, I imagine, and it was                     
 clean-shaven, yet haggard, like the face of a man who has lost                 
 interest in appearance.  His shoes were clean, an extremely odd thing          
 to notice at that point, I know.  My acute sense of observation                
 sometimes gets the best of me.  Covering his short, brownish-gray hair         
 was a short-brimmed hat of almost the same color.                              
                                                                                
      His eyes were like dark chips of ice, yet when he stared at me            
 through the clearing steam, feelings of care and compassion swamped            
 over me.                                                                       
                                                                                
      "May I sit down?"                                                         
                                                                                
      His voice was clear and soft.  It took me a little by surprise.           
                                                                                
      "Yes, please do." I found myself saying before thinking about             
 what I might be getting into.                                                  
                                                                                
      He shuffled himself into the booth, sitting across from me,               
 nearer to the window.                                                          
                                                                                
      "Cold." He said, smiling and shrugging his shoulders, "That               
 coffee looks quite good."                                                      
                                                                                
      I paused for a second.  The man did not have the appearance of a          
 man stricken by poverty.                                                       
                                                                                
      "Would you like some?" I was full willing to by him a cup of his          
 own, if not to give him mine, which I seemed to had lost the taste             
 for.                                                                           
                                                                                
      "No." He shrugged.  "No, no, no...  I am not in need of favors.           
 I am simply making small talk."                                                
                                                                                
      I nodded, confused.  I had an urge to simply come out and ask him         
 what it was that he wanted.                                                    
                                                                                
      "Cold, yes.  Quite cold.  Very difficult times."                          
                                                                                
      I frowned.                                                                
                                                                                
      "Do I know you from somewhere?"                                           
                                                                                
      "Only indirectly...  In passing, so to speak.  I was a good               
 friend of your brothers."                                                      
                                                                                
      I accepted this in good faith, not taking the time to stop and            
 weed out the oddities of his story.                                            
                                                                                
      "I see."                                                                  
                                                                                
      "Very good friend indeed.  I understand you are now all that is           
 left of the family line."                                                      
                                                                                
      "Yes, you could say that."                                                
                                                                                
      I thought back briefly on what the old man had said.  Was a good          
 friend, he used the word was, and I had never seen this man before in          
 my life.  I had only told six people about the death, only one of              
 which was a good friend of Matthew's, and this man was not one of              
 them.                                                                          
                                                                                
      The obituaries, I thought to myself, he just read about it in the         
 papers.  I came up with the comeback myself: there hasn't been an              
 obituary report yet.  A clerical error had caused the local newspaper          
 to report the death two weeks after the event itself, so where,                
 thought I, did he find out?                                                    
                                                                                
      Again, I came to my own rescue, there must have been other                
 reports.  Other articles in the news.  This man had just been paying           
 acute attention.  Perhaps he was a consistent member of the church             
 where the service was held, and saw it written in the schedule                 
 pamphlet.                                                                      
                                                                                
      He was, after all, a good friend of Matthew's.                            
                                                                                
      So why wasn't he at the funeral..?                                        
                                                                                
      "Such a pity.  His demise, I mean.  That is, after all, the               
 reason you are here, is it not?"                                               
                                                                                
      "I'm sorry?"                                                              
                                                                                
      "You have come here to grieve, so to speak."                              
                                                                                
      My eyes were locked open.  He continued to speak with remarkable          
 calmness.                                                                      
                                                                                
      "Do not be frightened.  I am here as a friend."                           
                                                                                
      My throat was getting slightly dry, and it clicked as I                   
 swallowed.  I was genuinely intrigued, if not scared.                          
                                                                                
      "Look, I'm sorry, but I've never seen you before in my life, and          
 I knew most of Matthew's close friends."                                       
                                                                                
      "Are you saying that I'm not who I say I am?"                             
                                                                                
      "I'm saying that you haven't said who you are at all.  Now                
 please, my good man, state your business or leave me in peace."                
                                                                                
      "I have a message."                                                       
                                                                                
      I couldn't move.                                                          
                                                                                
      "A message?"                                                              
                                                                                
      "From Matthew."                                                           
                                                                                
      It was then that all time seemed to stop in the Hampton Cafe.  I          
 found myself mesmerized by this old man, held in some kind of                  
 imaginary, supernatural grip.  I began to breathe quickly, then                
 stifled it, to conceal my fear.                                                
                                                                                
      "I don't understand."                                                     
                                                                                
      "I have a message from Matthew."                                          
                                                                                
      "Are you in charge of his will?"                                          
                                                                                
      He chuckled.                                                              
                                                                                
      "No.  No, not at all.  This is not something that he wanted to            
 say to you.  This is something that he wants to say."                          
                                                                                
      There it was again.  Has a message.  Wants to say.  The fear of           
 this man, of the unknown crept up slowly from my heart.                        
                                                                                
      "Would you like to hear it?"                                              
                                                                                
      I paused.                                                                 
                                                                                
      "Yes." I whispered.                                                       
                                                                                
      For the next few seconds, a startling change came over the old            
 man's face, a change that I will describe only once, something which I         
 have never been able to satisfactorily explain since.  For the brief           
 moment when the old man relayed his message, his eyes changed.  His            
 eyes and mouth took on a new form, perhaps only in my mind, perhaps            
 not.  His eyes turned dark brown, and they somehow glistened                   
 differently, with youthfulness.  The eyes portrayed a different mind,          
 and the mind that was behind them was a mind that I did and still              
 could recognize at a moment's glance.  It was Matthew.  For a brief            
 instant, the old man's eyes became Matthew's.  He said:                        
                                                                                
      "Thank you, Jonathan.  For all you have given me.  Please forgive         
 the shortcomings of my youth, the pain of our days growing up, for             
 someday you will be with me, and together we will be happy."                   
                                                                                
      Then his eyes faded, and the man sat back in his cushioned seat.          
                                                                                
      "He thought you should know that before you went on living."              
                                                                                
      The old man slid to the end of the seat, and moved to stand up.           
                                                                                
      "Wait." I croaked silently.  He seemed to take no notice.  He             
 stood, and walked toward the exit of the cafe.  Just before he opened          
 the door, he stopped, and I got up enough strength to ask:                     
                                                                                
      "Who are you?"                                                            
                                                                                
      He nodded and stepped out the door.  I sat in my own sweat for a          
 long time, not knowing what to make of what I had just experienced.  I         
 have not told anyone about my periodic expeditions to the cafe until           
 just now.  Not even Matthew.  If this was some elaborate joke, how did         
 he know to come here?  Had he been shadowing me since the funeral?             
 Where did he get his information?                                              
                                                                                
      Breaking the spell, I stood up violently and stepped toward the           
 exit, just as he had done seconds ago.  I threw open the door, and             
 stepped out into the parking lot.  The wind was cold, and I had left           
 my jacket in the cafe, so I stood there, shivering, looking earnestly          
 for a trace of the old man.                                                    
                                                                                
      I found none.                                                             
                                                                                
      There had been only one automobile in the lot, and it was mine.           
 The only possible directions he could have gone walking (I heard no            
 motor) were well within sighting distances.  It was as though he had           
 just vanished.                                                                 
                                                                                
      Several explanations came to me later, ranging from the abstract          
 (I had merely lost track of time, and he had walked many blocks during         
 my spell) to the common (he had escaped on bicycle) to the silly (he           
 was hidden under my car).                                                      
                                                                                
      Since none struck me at the time, I resigned myself to re-enter           
 the cafe and sit once again at my booth.  I pondered the events which          
 I now chronicle, then paid for my coffee and left.                             
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
      It has been many years since my encounter with the old man at the         
 Hampton Cafe, and I am still as speechless about it as I was back              
 then.  What happened, you ask.  I do not honestly know.  Some                  
 elaborate prank?  There had been too much detail which would have              
 required so much research and money that the prank would have been             
 worthless without a punch line, so to speak.  And I have not been              
 bothered by laughing co-workers since.                                         
                                                                                
      Was this old man somehow a messenger from wherever Matthew is             
 now?  I do not know.  I am not even sure if I believe that myself, and         
 I was the one who recognized his eyes.  Did the event change my life,          
 do you ask?  I only wish it had.  I still find myself as much of an            
 agnostic as I was many years ago.                                              
                                                                                
      I still have no answers.                                                  
                                                                                
      The only change it brought about in my personal philosophy is not         
 one of conviction in the afterlife, or in Heaven and Hell.  The change         
 is acceptance that there are many things in this life which we cannot          
 explain.  I accepted this with the same calm frame of mind with which          
 I accepted Matthew's death:                                                    
                                                                                
      There are things in this world which defy logical explanation.            
                                                                                
      There is so much we don't understand.  I am convinced of that.            
 There is so much about this world that we do not understand.                   
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
      So now what?  I visited the cafe a total of three times after the         
 incident.  Once for the birth of my son, once for the death of my              
 wife, and once for the end of World War III.  Very few events other            
 than these have influenced my life.                                            
                                                                                
      I enjoy my life, but I am not afraid of losing it.                        
                                                                                
      The dingy cafe four miles to the East of the small Missouri town          
 of Hampton is still standing.  So am I.

 ======================================================================         
                                                                                
      Your name is Phil Miller.  The time is 21:34 on October 27, 2050.         
 You are packing a state of the art Phased Plasma Pistol, a real                
 beauty.  You can feel its cold metal pushing up against the skin of            
 your left side through the tight fitting radiation-proof cover-all.            
 Feeling the piece there gives you a sense of security, a feeling that          
 armies would fall under your fire.  The fact that you are on massive           
 amounts of speed, of course, does wonders for your sense of euphoria.          
                                                                                
      On the opposite side of your body, there is another object that           
 makes you feel good.  Although not as large as the pistol, you can             
 still feel it's weight.  It is a small iron bar, a one day pass into           
 the free-neutral city.  The city lies four hundred kilometers to the           
 southwest of the base you are stationed at.  Right now, you're driving         
 down a fairly straight road, bounded on both sides by seemingly                
 endless planes of glass-like residue, the only telltale that there             
 ever was a fusion explosion here.  The sight is familiar to you, so            
 you do not contemplate how this area will be barren for millennia to           
 come, nor of how you are only able to pass here due do the heavy               
 shielding of your '20 Chevy Sunblazer.  Your mind doesn't flicker              
 back, even for a second to the millions who died when the great city           
 that once stood here was annihilated completely.                               
                                                                                
      The speedometer reads 207 km/hr.  A respectable speed, but you'd          
 like to go faster.  Your left hand planted firmly on the wheel, you            
 toggle the velocity switch a few times until the green counter rises           
 to 265.  Normally, you wouldn't be able to control the car at this             
 speed, but the increased awareness and strength provided by the drug           
 does a lot to help.  The base won't notice a few patches missing from          
 the barracks supply station.  You think back, only for a moment, to            
 all your poor compatriots who don't have a friend in the supply                
 division; who can only experience what you're experiencing now while           
 in action.  Your thoughts quickly turn to contempt.                            
                                                                                
      "Fuck 'em!" you mutter venomously under your breath.  You raise           
 the velocity to 296.                                                           
                                                                                
      Now, through the leaded glass of your windshield, you can see the         
 towers and lights of the free-neutral city, and also something else of         
 interest.  Perched ominously over the lighted city is the hulking form         
 of the carnival zeppelin.  The zeppelin, now dark, will shine tonight          
 with the intensity of the sun.  Even at this distance you can feel the         
 members of the psycho-symphony tuning their instruments.  Nothing mind         
 effecting now, but later...  later...  You reach back behind your              
 neck, flick a switch on your brain implant, and the disturbances               
 cease.  It wouldn't do any good to have distractions now, not when             
 every movement of the wheel is life or death.  No..  As good as the            
 carnival psycho-symphony is, you decide to forgo tonight's                     
 performance.  You have some other entertainment in mind.                       
                                                                                
      The towers are closer now, as is the looming hulk of the                  
 zeppelin.  A blinking radar dish icon on your dash tells you that              
 you're about to enter into a speed patrolled area.  Regretfully, you           
 thumb the revert-legal button on the wheel and your speed drops down           
 to 150.  Even in your drugged state, you realize that the pistol               
 pressed tightly against your armpit won't save your from the automatic         
 guns that are the city's defenses.  You've seen city defenses in               
 action before.  You're not about to let that happen to you; not when           
 you've got so much to do.                                                      
                                                                                
      As you pull your vehicle in through the ramparts, your level of           
 excitement rises.  You can feel the blood course through your veins            
 faster and faster, driven by your racing heartbeat.                            
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
      You are in a field; a broad, green, gently sloping field; the             
 kind they had before the terror.  You are a child.  The grass is               
 thick, although not overgrown.  Small portions of it break off and             
 stick to your feet as you run through it.  The sweet smell of flowers          
 is near.  You don't know which ones.  It doesn't matter, the smell is          
 good.  As you run across the field, you start to bound, your bare feet         
 contacting with the ground, then your entire body raising into the air         
 with each stride.  How easy it is.  And how futile.                            
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
      "Your pass sir?  This is the last request I shall make.  I repeat         
 my assertion that I am prepared to use deadly force unless                     
 identification is certified."                                                  
                                                                                
      The voice of the gate computer brings you back from your reverie.         
 You remove the iron bar from your right vest pocket and insert it into         
 the slot next to the window.  You're amazed that you were able to              
 negotiate the car to its present position.  You try, in vain to                
 recapture your vision, but it is forgotten.  You can think now only of         
 the carnival's delights.  No doubt there will be mutant death                  
 wrestling, perhaps a few burnings of recently seized technocrats, and          
 certainly there will be the famed sex-slaves.  You reach down into             
 your left hip pocket and finger the coinage therein.  There is enough.         
                                                                                
      The light in front of you flashes green, and the gate opens.  The         
 auto-control of your car is engaged, removing you from the loop.  At a         
 creeping pace which angers you even more than the tone of that gate            
 computer, you are drawn into the spacious parking lot of the city.             
                                                                                
      When you finally stop and get out, a female voice gently reminds          
 you "remember where you parked, please." Your hand instinctively moves         
 to your gun, eagerly anticipating.  It is only when the weapon is half         
 drawn do you realize that the voice's source is the PA located at the          
 top of a high pole some thirty meters from you.  "Remember where you           
 parked, please" she states again, softly.  Fighting your nature, you           
 sheathe the pistol, but the swirling energy in your blood stream               
 remains undiminished.  You must consummate your feelings; soon.                
                                                                                
      You enter the winding walkways of the free-neutral city, walking          
 at what you consider to be a slow pace, so as not to broadcast your            
 condition.  Still, you seem to be passing out most of the other                
 walkers.                                                                       
                                                                                
      Perhaps it is the subliminal advertising boards hung above the            
 pubs, or perhaps you were simply too excited to notice it before, but          
 you suddenly feel parched beyond belief.  You must have a drink.  The          
 noisiest, most garishly colored bar attracts your attention and you            
 enter, anticipating the cool feeling of liquid passing down your               
 throat.  The place is crowded, hiding for the moment your                      
 conspicuousness; the wide open eyes and red lips that are the mark of          
 a soldier.                                                                     
                                                                                
      You look towards the bar, and she is there.  Just the same as she         
 was all of those years ago, at the first carnival.  There is no                
 thought in your mind as to how she is here, or why she doesn't                 
 recognize you when you sit down next to her and offer her a drink.             
 Your increased awareness does not extend to your inner being, and so           
 the illusion lives on.                                                         
                                                                                
      "I'd be much obliged, stranger.  Ooooh..  Are you a soldier?  How         
 interesting!  You must be very strong.  And very wealthy, no?  I'm             
 sure you have some coinage on you, eh?"                                        
                                                                                
      "I'll have a bourbon and soda, and a beer for the lady," you              
 state impassively at the bartender.  "Coming right up, sir," he says           
 as he turns around, revealing the series of raised switches on the             
 back of his neck.  A deserter, no doubt.  You hate deserters, but you          
 suffer him to live as long as he doesn't give you any lip.  "Do you            
 live here, or are you part of the carnival?" you ask politely, even            
 though she is obviously of the latter persuasion.  Her scant, ornate           
 clothing and wealth of hair, a commodity for which other less                  
 fortunate women would kill, give her away clearly.                             
                                                                                
      "I'm a carnie worker...  I'm, uh..  off for the day though." You          
 don't hear her.  You're too busy looking her up and down.  Her body            
 has some inconsequential differences to how you remember her, but all          
 in all she appears the same.  Large breasts heaving with the effort            
 she must take to breathe this thickened air.  Eyes dilated by                  
 depressants or pleasure heighteners.  Smooth skin unblemished by even          
 a single spot or bump.  She's been modified, as they all have.  It             
 goes without saying.  She is too perfect, just as she always has been.         
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
      You've run into a section of the field where the grass is taller,         
 thicker, more easily concealing.  Some of the long strands have a dry          
 seed pod at the top, waiting to be blown away by the wind, to                  
 propagate, to spawn, to swarm.  Bees buzz around you now, but you've           
 had your shots, so they don't come within a few feet of your heaving           
 body.  You ran hard and fast, and now your friends won't find you; for         
 sure they won't, and then you'll win.  You'll prove yourself superior.         
 You squat down to provide yourself even more protection than before.           
 Waiting, anticipating the moment you hope will never come, when your           
 questing friends will come upon you with a shout and you will taste            
 your defeat.                                                                   
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
      As you walk out of the bar with her, your excitement reaches a            
 peak level.  You start walking faster, faster, until she can barely            
 keep up with you.  "Why are you walking so fast?  What's the hurry,            
 honey?" You still don't hear her.  To you, she has become a                    
 non-person; an object.  As you pass a deserted alleyway between two            
 towering buildings, you push her in with all of your weight, following         
 close behind.  As her crumpling form hits the wet ground, you reach            
 up, to your left side, grasping your pistol, pulling it out of its             
 carefully fitted holster, aiming it for her crying eyes, now turned            
 full force on you and filled with a fear unequaled by any opponent you         
 have ever met in battle.  There is only time for her to scream a               
 plaintive "Why?" How dare she?  Why indeed?  Doesn't she know?                 
 Doesn't she remember?  With only a grim hate in your mind, you pull            
 the trigger.  The only evidence is a clean hole directly in the center         
 of her forehead.  You always were a good shot.                                 
                                                                                
      Kneeling over her dead form, you plant a kiss tenderly on her             
 stiffening lips.  "I loved you." Are the words yours?  You don't know.         
 You only feel the deep satisfaction that came from the kill.  You              
 raise your head to see the tops of the buildings and the huge hulking          
 form of the zeppelin overhead, blotting out the stars, the sky.  Soon          
 the lights of the zeppelin will brighten the streets of the city.  You         
 take out a small phial, remove a new patch and apply it eagerly,               
 discarding the old one.  Already you can feel the excitement course            
 through your veins, just as you can hear the blood rushing there even          
 now, pumped by a renewed purpose.                                              
                                                                                
      By now your drugged mind has almost forgotten the existence of            
 the corpse beneath your feet.  You must find her again, and kill her,          
 and again.  You will kill again tonight.                                       
                                                                                
                                 * * *                                          
                                                                                
      The time was twenty years ago.  You were a trainee.  Seventeen            
 years old, a mere boy.  But even then you had been carrying a weapon           
 when you rode into the city, a distant city, with your friends from            
 the academy.  Indeed, the academy required that all personnel on leave         
 carry a firearm at all times.  One never knew what scavenging scum one         
 might find in the wildernesses of the wasted world.  That city had             
 been much like this one.  Smaller, perhaps, but still much like this           
 one.  You remember seeing first the defense towers, and then the               
 radiation dome that that city had required, being in an area of much           
 higher risk, and of course there was the zeppelin.  You remember               
 sitting in awe in the main concourse of the city with thousands of             
 others as the psycho-symphony played through their set, the effects of         
 the performance sending waves of strange, undefinable sensation though         
 your body.  "Better than sex," you had remarked to one of your friends         
 afterward.  Well, perhaps, perhaps not.  Of course, you had been a             
 virgin at the time, so the use of the expression had been more comical         
 than anything else.                                                            
                                                                                
      She was at the city.  Her name was Juliana.  She told you she was         
 not a prostitute of the carnival, merely a worker for it.  Her job was         
 mostly in setting up the carnival, and so she had some time off, time          
 she usually spent in whatever city the carnival was in, looking                
 around, experiencing.  She was young, and not unpretty, although not           
 of the caliber required for the prostitutes and sex-slaves but to you          
 she was perfect.  What you and her shared that night was greater than          
 any pleasure you have since had.  You shared tenderness, you exposed           
 your soul to her, and she to you.  And for the first time in your              
 life, you believed yourself to be happy.  You cared for her, damn it!          
 You cared for her in the few weeks that you were together.  You spent          
 most of your time with her and when the call to return to the academy          
 for classes and training came, you disobeyed it.                               
                                                                                
      And then it had come.  A subtle change in the way she acted               
 towards you, the way she spoke to you.  Almost unnoticeable, but you           
 noticed it.  You felt her love for you deteriorate step by step, while         
 you tried to wish away the hour you knew would come, tried to tell             
 yourself it was just a passing phase.  You remember the moment when            
 you came back to the apartment she was renting.  She told you that             
 night that she had loved another man.  A man of the carnival.  The             
 carnival was leaving, and so was she.  She didn't want to see you any          
 more.  She was a wanderer, she didn't want to stay put for any length          
 of time.  Many other things were said, many more excuses.  All you             
 could think of was how she had used you, how horribly insensitive she          
 was to you, how much you had given to her and how she was now repaying         
 you, with her brutal farewell.  You remember running back to the               
 academy, to lick your wounds, to nurse your hate.  They reaccepted             
 you.  No reason was grave enough to give up a potential soldier.  And          
 a soldier was what they got.                                                   
                                                                                
      The image of her in your mind is skewed now, distorted, enhanced          
 by the images of other, lesser women.  Women with expressions of blind         
 terror frozen into their faces, just like the woman you even now leave         
 in the alley.  In a very real way, all of those women are and were             
 Juliana.  All of them.                                                         
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                 * * *                                          
                                                                                
                                                                                
      The field has turned a deep auburn color now.  Still the grass is         
 thick, but many of the strands are dry and brittle.  Now as you run            
 back towards the school the strands break under your feet, sometimes           
 causing pain.  The sky, formerly a deep shade of blue, now appears             
 gray.  Huge black clouds move fast and silently over the darkened              
 land.  Strong winds have begun to blow in from the south.  Already you         
 can feel the first drops of the storm impacting on top of your tousled         
 mop of hair.  The other children are already there, waiting for you,           
 calling to you, calling from safety, along with the worried teachers.          
 "Hurry up, Phil!" they shout plaintively.  "The storm's coming!  Get           
 inside quick!" Or maybe the voices come from inside.  The schoolhouse          
 seems so very far away.                                                        
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
      You walk several meters down the street from where the opening to         
 the alleyway lies when the lights come on.  From above, from the huge          
 form of the zeppelin, there is light; a bright white light, a magical          
 light.  You try to look up, but the zeppelin is too bright to look at          
 directly.  Like the sun.  Like the truth.  It leaves a shadow on your          
 vision that never seems to completely clear.  You feel a slight                
 brushing against your mind, a signal that the Psycho-Symphony has              
 started its epic concert.  Still, you make no move to cut out your             
 shield.  You've seen her now.  There she is!  Walking out of that              
 residence!  This time you'll have her.  This time she can't escape             
 your savage passions.                                                          
                                                                                
      Now another woman lies dead in a thirty-fourth floor hallway,             
 slumped against one wall.  This is the third for this night, and still         
 it is the first ever.  Again, the look of crazed terror on her face.           
 Again, the clean burn-hole bisecting her frontal lobe perfectly.  The          
 effect is enhanced by the bright light streaming down through the              
 picture window from the zeppelin, giving all objects in sight a                
 day-glow luminescence.  Still, you love her.                                   
                                                                                
      Skulking out of the residence, pistol still hot from the last             
 shot, you glimpse, out of the corner of your eye, an ambulance drone           
 carrying another one of this night's victims along with several other          
 corpses you don't recognize.  It appears you aren't the only one who's         
 been busy this night.  Far from it.  It's the way it always is at              
 carnival time.  Some corner of your mind reaches out to these other            
 murderers, leaving a trail of dead flesh just as you do.  You feel,            
 somehow, that you are all kin, a brotherhood.  But this feeling is             
 soon wiped clean from your mind by the all-pervasiveness of the new            
 dose of the drug.  You must kill again, for only in killing can your           
 passions be consummated.  Your carnal excitement reaches a fever               
 pitch.  Not thinking of your own safety, only of your purpose, you             
 reach for your pistol, tooking out across the crowded square for a             
 target; any target.                                                            
                                                                                
      "Phil?  Phil Miller?" The voice shatters your concentration like          
 a brick thrown through a plate-glass window.  You turn, hand still             
 gripping the pistol in its shoulder holster.  At first, you can't make         
 out who or what...  and then there she is.  "It's Juliana.  You do             
 remember me, don't you?  I know it's been a long time, but when I saw          
 your name come up on the city pass list, I just had to go looking for          
 you.  You all right?"                                                          
                                                                                
      You're not.  You're frozen in stark terror.  You can feel the             
 blood drain from your face, your pupils dilate.  It can't be!  Your            
 grip on the pistol is greater than ever.                                       
                                                                                
      "You OK Phil?  Oh dear!  I seem to have given you quite a shock!          
 Maybe I should have left well enough alone...  Want to sit down or             
 something?"                                                                    
                                                                                
      If you hear her at all, it is merely as a shadow, as all of those         
 other women were merely shadows of this goddess that stands before you         
 now.  Juliana, how could I profane you so?  The words only appear in           
 your head, but to you they are real.  You pull the pistol slowly out           
 of its holster.                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
      The storm is raging full force now.  Rain batters at the                  
 schoolhouse windows and roof, propagating waves of sound that                  
 reverberate throughout the cinderblock classrooms.  As much as you             
 tell yourself that the building will stand under this punishment, and          
 as much as the teachers reassure you, you can't help thinking that the         
 world is on the verge of collapse.  The wars in Asia and Africa seem           
 to grow nearer every day.  The blockades in South America are causing          
 more and more controversy.  The government, torn apart and dominated           
 by huge corporations, holds no answer, no hope.  Somewhere in your             
 mind, you realize that most of your thoughts now are in retrospect,            
 looking back on that day with the point of view of someone who's been          
 through it, but the image is still real.  The blinding flash far on            
 the horizon.  The rush for the underground shelters.  The horrible,            
 horrible noise.  These are real memories, no phantoms.  The death.             
 Only the death is unreal.  It could not be realized by even the                
 oldest, wisest minds, and certainly it could not be realized by a              
 child.                                                                         
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
      "Phil, no!  no!" She rushes at you but it is too late.  Your              
 enhanced motor functions bring your pistol to bear on your target with         
 deadly accuracy, and in a split second, the weapon is fired, muzzle            
 pointed squarely at your own forehead.  Seemingly in slow motion, you          
 see the plasma bolt come racing towards you.  Your last coherent               
 vision is of Juliana's eyes, older eyes, wiser eyes, open eyes.                
 Crying eyes.  Crying for you or crying for the world that has come to          
 this; for mankind?                                                             
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
      Still, the savage winds of the shock wave blow over the small             
 school house, a harbinger of an ever darkening future.

           in  film  studies  in  an attempt  to  broaden  his

           publishes his own magazine  (Quanta), takes care of

 ======================================================================         
                                                                                
      The black dress was not dirty, but Margaret dropped it down the           
 cleaning chute as soon as she removed it.  She climbed into the                
 bathtub and soaked, water as hot as she could stand.  At last she              
 drained the tub, wrapped herself in her warmest bathrobe and made a            
 pot of tea.  When it was poured and steaming she opened her purse and          
 took out the funeral program.                                                  
                                                                                
      The cover was a tasteful photograph of stars over a quiet sea and         
 a few lines from "home is the sailor." Inside was the order of                 
 service, a list of hymns, a short biography and a recent publicity             
 photograph.  Nothing in it seemed to have anything to do with Paul.            
 There was no mention of suicide.                                               
                                                                                
      The telephone was ringing.  Margaret crumpled the program and             
 dropped it in the waste chute.  She picked up the receiver before the          
 third ring.                                                                    
                                                                                
      "Yes?" she said.  "Oh, Andrea, hello!" She looked across the room         
 at the calendar, where a date three weeks ahead was circled in black.          
 "Yes, it was a lovely service ....  Your roses were beautiful ....  I          
 thought so too ....  No, I went alone.  I'm sorry you couldn't get             
 back in time.  How is Japan?"                                                  
                                                                                
      A longer pause.  "No, I suppose they didn't.  It happened on              
 Wednesday.  He was working on his new novel.  The machine was still on         
 when they found him.  He shot himself through the head.  He hadn't             
 even taken off his harness." Margaret was surprised how calmly she             
 could relate this.  "No, he didn't leave a note.  There was no clue in         
 the tape.  No one knows why he did it."                                        
                                                                                
      Damn him, Margaret thought.  I always hated his gun collection.           
 And his war books-- "It was a new Constantin Falcon adventure.                 
 Something about gold and white slavery in the banana republics.  He            
 was on the second draft." She stiffened.  "I wouldn't know, Andrea.  I         
 suppose you could contact his attorney."                                       
                                                                                
      Now she relaxed again, speaking as one professional to another.           
 "Yes, I'll have it in the rough tape by the end of the month ....  No,         
 I can work on it.  I lost a few days, of course ....  No, I'm fine             
 now.  In fact, the work should do me good." She smiled at the reply.           
 "Yes, Andrea ....  No, Andrea ....  I'll see you later, Andrea.                
 Goodbye."                                                                      
                                                                                
      Damn the bastard for killing himself, she thought, and the tears          
 finally came.  Why the hell should it hurt so much?  It's been over a          
 year since we split up.  We just meet at authors' parties, chat over           
 drinks.  It's all so fucking civilized.                                        
                                                                                
      She cinched her robe tighter, picked up her tea and walked to the         
 study.  The composing machine took up nearly half the room.  It was            
 the one she had used for 23 years, bulky with banks of flickering              
 lights and trembling meters.  She had to be half technician to operate         
 it.  But the new machines were less sensitive--                                
                                                                                
      She was starting self-hypnosis as she sat and pulled on the               
 receiving harness.  She pasted the pickups over the acupuncture                
 meridians, tightened the headband, clipped the ground wires to her             
 earposts.  She smiled at her reflection in the window, strapped and            
 metal-studded and umbilical-wired like a character in one of her space         
 fantasies.                                                                     
                                                                                
      She was adjusting knobs, choosing the tape.  She recited her              
 mantras for this novel, entering the mood.  "Fundamentally                     
 Switzerland.  So small against the immensity.  The high proud terror           
 of the snows." She settled into the chair and played the familiar              
 switches, advancing the tape to the roughed-in chapter.  "Margot flees         
 to the pass.  The pass -- the "col" -- is haven.  Escape from Italy.           
 Switzerland.  Premonition of the final terror." Should I record from           
 the start?  She decided to view for a while, as if she were audience.          
                                                                                
      Now, belted and strapped like a spaceman she descends, counting           
 downward through the three stages of sleep.  She has reached eyelid            
 catalepsy, she drains her arm of feeling, then fills it with light.            
 Far away as in a dream she feels it levitate.  When it reaches her             
 face it drops and she enters the story.                                        
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
      Blue sky, cloudless and cold, dark with high altitudes.                   
 Featureless--a sudden pain at the sun, overexposed--drops back to blue         
 and below, mountains.  These are white mountains, sharp ice edges              
 against the void.  A sudden cold, as if wind blows from the ice.  In           
 the cold a subtle undertone, a terror, a premonition or a nostalgia.           
                                                                                
      Margaret, surprised, decides that last mood flicker must be               
 removed.  This novel has nothing to do with nostalgia.                         
                                                                                
      The view drops from ice to rock, then down dark forest slopes.            
 Below is the road, two lanes, old blacktop, white dashed line.  It             
 clings to the mountain in vertiginous switchbacks, fades into blue             
 haze far below.  On the road two cars crawl about two turns apart, as          
 if linked by invisible string.                                                 
                                                                                
      We descend rapidly toward the red Chevy convertible, white                
 leather top open, a starlike reflection off the paint.  A glance               
 behind at the gray Mercedes, sharklike, implacable.  Now we are in the         
 car, a disembodied viewer in the passenger seat.  Margot, who is               
 driving, looks over her shoulder at the Mercedes two turns below.              
 Fear flickers about her mouth.  She controls the shudder, tries to get         
 more speed from the red convertible.  The car skids on a tight turn.           
 A quick glance at the blue depths below, a shudder of fear.                    
                                                                                
      We pass an Italian mile-post.  It is sixty-five kilometers to the         
 Swiss border.  Margot's mouth silently forms the words "sixty-five             
 kilometers." She looks up toward the col.  (Segue here--pass, col,             
 Ramuz, Switzerland.) Our gaze follows hers.  We know that the top of           
 the pass is the Swiss border and safety.                                       
                                                                                
      Our gaze lingers on the far snowfields after Margot's has                 
 returned to the road.  The cold returns, now mixed with Margot's fear.         
 (Is the nostalgia still there?)                                                
                                                                                
      Margaret decides to take control.  Far away, in a dream of                
 flickering lights and trembling needles, her wired hand moves to a             
 switch, presses it.  Tape reels revolve silently.  The mountains               
 heave, then stabilize.  The landscape is the same.  But now she is             
 creating it, wandering invisible in circuits of brainlike complexity           
 half a mile below the publishing house.  She feels the potent joy of           
 creation.                                                                      
                                                                                
      Margaret sharpens a mountain peak.  She defines the line of the           
 road where it crosses the snowfields, gray on white.  With the                 
 landscape in order she turns to her heroine.                                   
                                                                                
      Now that they are recording, Margot is aware of Margaret's                
 presence.  But she does not turn yet, still in character.  "The woman          
 menaced." Very good, thinks Margaret, studying her expression.  Just           
 the right touch of brave resolve over the fear.  Margot reaches back           
 and touches her hair where it is held by the clip, an almost                   
 unconscious gesture of vanity or bravado.  She glances back at the             
 gray Mercedes.  It is no closer.                                               
                                                                                
      "Good morning." says Margaret.                                            
                                                                                
      Margot relaxes and smiles.  "Good morning, Margaret.  Are you all         
 right?"                                                                        
                                                                                
      Margaret frowns, says "Well enough.  Why do you ask?"                     
                                                                                
      Margot looks at her strangely.  "Andrea was here this morning.            
 She left a note for you in the glove compartment."                             
                                                                                
      Margaret finds it:                                                        
                                                                                
          Great feel to the last chapter.  Keep up the good work                
          We're all pulling for you, kid.  Love, Andrea.                        
                                                                                
      Margaret smiles.  "Did you read this?" Margot nods.  "Someone I           
 once loved has killed himself.  Paul Constant.  He was a composer              
 too."                                                                          
                                                                                
      "He created Constantin Falcon, didn't he?"                                
                                                                                
      "Of course you remember him.  I had forgotten our joint story."           
 Margaret blushed.  "I had always sort of hoped we could do another.            
 That one was very popular."                                                    
                                                                                
      "Well, I enjoyed it."                                                     
                                                                                
      Margaret stares at her character.  My god, she acts so real               
 sometimes.                                                                     
                                                                                
      She remembers their first and only collaboration.  In the first           
 delights of mutual lust, they had created New Orleans brothels,                
 unspoiled Pacific islands, mad gallops over the Arabian desert under           
 the lurid moon.  When they finally settled on a plot they had edited           
 out all the sex scenes and left only the romance.  The emotional               
 undertones had required more skillful, professional editing before             
 Andrea would release it.  "We are NOT a porno house!" she stated,              
 tapping her pencil.                                                            
                                                                                
      ("I'll write her into my next as Queen Victoria," Paul had                
 whispered.)                                                                    
                                                                                
      "I'm glad Andrea dropped in.  Margot, let's try to finish up the          
 chase to the pass today.  I think we can keep the main action and              
 views we blocked in last week, and work on emotions."                          
                                                                                
      Margot frowned.  "I still think the action is a little weak.              
 Maybe we could leave it open for improv, see what turns up.  We can            
 always use the backup tape if it doesn't work."                                
                                                                                
      "Well, it is a little trite.  Why not?" Margaret trusts the part          
 of herself that has created Margot, that is Margot.  Paul always kept          
 the Falcon on a tight leash, a wooden puppet.  ("Hell, woman!  All the         
 people want is action!  The other stuff is all literature." Half               
 ironically, half meaning it.)                                                  
                                                                                
      Margot returns to the script, squeezing every ounce of power from         
 the red convertible.  Vertiginous views, spraying gravel, the smell of         
 hot brakes.  Margot's fear, more insistent, a hint of her thoughts.  A         
 memory image--golden sunset, Claude handing her the white packet by            
 the Grand Canal.  "They'll kill for this, love," he had said.  Now             
 they are trying.  The road again, the pass still far away, white on            
 blue.  Near panic, then control.  The high snows brood over all,               
 fundamentally Switzerland.                                                     
                                                                                
      Margaret notices the mountains sagging.  That's a hazard of full          
 recording, not depending on the tape.  Your attention wanders, things          
 change.  Stream of consciousness takes over.  Objects have emotional           
 undertones.  It can save a tired story or ruin it.  She plumps the             
 mountains up again, but the peaks seem softer, as if the ice were              
 melting.                                                                       
                                                                                
      Another turn.  The scream of tires on gravel echoes the silent            
 scream in Margot's head.  Good effect.  We'll keep it.                         
                                                                                
      She hears Margot gasp.                                                    
                                                                                
      The gray Mercedes has crept up a hundred yards.  There is now             
 barely a switchback between them.  Too early!  thinks Margaret.  But           
 let it be, maybe it will tighten the pacing.  Margot pulls ahead               
 slowly, regains the lost space.  Another turn, a skid near the edge.           
 Too close--we made it!  Relief, then remembering, the fear again.  The         
 road turns up a glacial valley and the ground becomes nearly level.            
 Dense forest blocks their view.                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
      "The car is boiling over," says Margot.                                   
                                                                                
      "That's not in the script."                                               
                                                                                
      "It's doing it anyway." The gauge needle is well into the red             
 zone.  Margaret tries to will it down.                                         
                                                                                
      "I suppose the radiator would have boiled if we had been driving          
 this hard," she says.  "Damn it, I keep forgetting about old cars.             
 Margot, I'm going to make a fork in the road ahead.  Take the left             
 road.  I'll get the Mercedes to take the wrong fork."                          
                                                                                
      It is hackneyed, but she doesn't know what else to do.  Margot            
 can't flee on foot in this country.  Nor can she have a shoot-out with         
 the men in the gray Mercedes.  That can't come until the end, five             
 chapters away, in a speedboat on Lake Constance.  "Maybe there can be          
 a small dirt road over a different pass, known only to local                   
 farmers...?" (Trite!  You're getting old, Margaret!)                           
                                                                                
      Or maybe I should give Margot a better car.  It would mean                
 retaping most of the chapter, but we could salvage a lot-- The                 
 intersecting road appears.  The tires squeal as Margot swings suddenly         
 to the left, a quick decision.                                                 
                                                                                
      Good touch, thinks Margaret.  Maybe this will work out after all.         
                                                                                
      "There's a gas station ahead," says Margot.  "I'm stopping."              
 There is, indeed, a small building with a sign that says PETROL, red           
 letters on white.                                                              
                                                                                
      Is that right?  Margaret wonders.  She changes the word to                
 GAZOLIN, then ESSENCE, but it still looks wrong.  I'll research it             
 later, she decides.  She pulls out her notebook (and far away a second         
 tape revolves.)                                                                
                                                                                
           Ask A. re: "gas" Ital. Switz., ca. 1967. Photos?                     
                                                                                
      Margot pulls up beside the pumps.  The mechanic lifts the hood            
 and begins spraying water on the erupting radiator.  "Won't that crack         
 the engine block?"                                                             
                                                                                
      Margot smiles.  "Trust me.  Let's go in and have a cup of                 
 coffee."                                                                       
                                                                                
      Margaret notices the little restaurant beside the gas station.            
 The white neon sign in the window spells CAFE ANTARCTICA.                      
 (Antarctica?!) "Why not?  I need time to think."                               
                                                                                
      The two women sit near the window.  Outside, trees sway in the            
 wind from the pass.  Above them the mountains look soft and                    
 vulnerable, like ice cream.                                                    
                                                                                
      In the station lot, the mechanic is doing something to their              
 engine with a large wrench.                                                    
                                                                                
      Margaret hooks her arm over the back of the chair and looks               
 around the cafe.  "Don't they heat this place?" Her breath fogs the            
 air.  The walls are brushed steel, the white linoleum floor spotless           
 as a hospital.  On the tabletop, which is a mirror, are a transparent          
 vase and one white rose.  The sign in the window, seen from the rear,          
 is reflected around it in puddles of white light.  CAFE ANTARCTICA,            
 reversed and inverted.                                                         
                                                                                
      Why Antarctica?  All that goddamn snow.  I'm freezing.  What's my         
 subconscious up to today?  Margaret shivers, hugs herself.  Margot             
 silently offers her a sweater.                                                 
                                                                                
      The waitress has come.  Expressionless, white as a nurse, eyes            
 hidden by mirrored sunglasses.  Her hair flames bright as a rainbow, a         
 shaggy cut dyed orange, blue and golden.                                       
                                                                                
      "Two coffees, one black, one with cream." It is Margot who                
 orders.  Margaret stares at their reflections in the table top.  Her           
 heroine, dark and slim, smooths her immaculate hair.  Margaret's own           
 image is large and blondish, visibly middle-aged.  She feels worn out.         
 Her shoulders ache.  She cannot find her comb.  She tries to recapture         
 the mood of the novel, repeats her mantras.  "Fundamentally                    
 Switzerland.  Facing the immensity alone.  Riding like a falcon above          
 fear.  Death in the high proud snows." When she reopens her eyes the           
 coffee has come.                                                               
                                                                                
      Horribly, it comes in clear glass mugs.  The steam rises above            
 the cups and sinks into the depths of the mirrored table.  The                 
 reflections of the ceiling lights look like stars.  She sips slowly.           
 Calm.  Be calm.  You are in control.  This your world, your self.              
 Fundamentally--                                                                
                                                                                
      Outside, the mountains roll past in stately progression like              
 waves on a peaceful sea.  The trees sway in the wind like seaweed.             
 Warped reflections from the ice fields dancing on the walls are like           
 the surface of water seen from beneath.  As a drowning man might see           
 it.  Once again the cold washes over her, and with it the strange              
 nostalgia.  She knows what it is now.  It is depression, nostalgia for         
 sleep.                                                                         
                                                                                
      So this is what I had in mind, Margaret thinks.  I had thought            
 this novel would be fundamentally Switzerland.  I wanted high proud            
 mountains over pastures, domesticated immensity.  Images taken from            
 the novelist Ramuz: cows climbing to fragile summer meadows, the               
 threat of avalanche, fear overcome by stolid courage.  Margot,                 
 exhausted by her pursuit from Italy, would meet this hardy courage and         
 make it her own.                                                               
                                                                                
      But instead it is becoming Antarctica.  I hate Antarctica.  The           
 snow there is dead snow.  It has been there since before there were            
 men.  The horror of frozen mountains under strange stars.  Green               
 witch-lights dancing in the night that lasts all winter.  Blank white          
 silence or wind howling in the dark.  The sleep of a land with no hope         
 of waking.                                                                     
                                                                                
      What the hell, perhaps I should scrap the whole thing and make an         
 adventure story.  One man alone on a snowfield with solitude and               
 death.  Wolves howl under the northern lights.  He's already eaten all         
 the sled dogs.  Death by freezing.  They say it feels warm, sinking            
 down to sleep.                                                                 
                                                                                
      I wonder how Paul--                                                       
                                                                                
      Goddamn it, I know depression when I see it.  Occupational                
 hazard.  Snap out of it!                                                       
                                                                                
      You're just tired, babe.  Mistake to work today.  Take the week           
 off and fly to Hawaii.                                                         
                                                                                
      Or maybe--                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
      The cafe door opens.  The young man who enters is, even before            
 introductions, unmistakably a reporter.  He tips his hat back on his           
 sandy hair, shakes out his plaid sport coat.  "Wind's rising!" he              
 announces.  "Are you Margaret Norris?"                                         
                                                                                
      Where'd I get him?  Margaret wonders.  He looks like something            
 from a 'forties film.                                                          
                                                                                
      "Sorry, ma'am.  Of course I know who you are.  I came here to             
 meet you.  But you're probably wondering if I'm real or something you          
 improv'ed." He extends his hand.  "Joe Jackson from the Chronicle.             
 We're doing a feature on famous composers and I thought it would be            
 great to do an interview on-line, as it were..."                               
                                                                                
      "How the hell did you get into my novel?"                                 
                                                                                
      He smiles and pulls up a chair.  "Coffee, black!" he shouts over          
 his shoulder.  "Oh, I have literary ambitions myself.  Taking a                
 composing class out at City College.  I've done a little computer              
 stuff before and -- well, I just hacked my way into your account.              
 Hope you don't mind."                                                          
                                                                                
      His coffee has arrived.  "Thanks, miss.  Great hair.  You see,            
 ma'am, I've always been sort of a fan of yours.  And I thought, Joe,           
 this is your chance of a lifetime.  You can actually be IN a Margaret          
 Norris.  See the master in action.  Will you do an interview?"                 
                                                                                
      He's real all right.  I couldn't possibly have invented this.             
 "All right," she agrees.  "But frankly I'm having a lousy day.  Just           
 keep it short.  And don't ever do this again, or I'll call the cops."          
                                                                                
      "Thanks, Ms.  Norris!" Relieved.  Not a bad kid, just a bit of a          
 nerd.  He turns on his tape recorder and sets it on the mirror among           
 the mugs.                                                                      
                                                                                
                                                                                
     Q.  Ms. Norris, a lot of our viewers have asked us, and                    
         frankly I'm curious too.  How do you put a dream on a disk?            
                                                                                
     A.  That's a good question.  You need an engineer to answer                
         it for you.  But basically, and I'm probably getting                   
         some of this wrong, the dream is never really on the                   
         disk.  There's too much data.  The disk just holds the                 
         addresses of the real images, which are stored in a very               
         large computer owned by the publishing house.  That's                  
         why you pay per viewing.  You're using computer time.                  
                                                                                
                                                                                
     Q.  Where do you get ideas for all your novels?                            
                                                                                
     A.  Well, I read a lot.  Before composing machines became                  
         so common I wanted to be a writer.  The Margot Noel                    
         series is based on the spy and adventure novels of fifty               
         years ago, which is when they are set.  Beyond that,                   
         it's hard to describe how it happens.  I work from                     
         dreams, sometimes, or waking fantasies.  This novel                    
         started with a few isolated phrases.   "The high snows                 
         of fear" was one, and of course that became the title.                 
         "Snow" was also slang for cocaine, which is the pivot of               
         the plot.                                                              
                                                                                
 (...and the adventure genre tied me closer to Paul, let me be Margot,          
 just as he as the Falcon.  But the rest of him was a bitter, balding           
 little man who drank too much and collected guns.  Who shot himself            
 through the head three days ago.  Just as the rest of me is a                  
 middle-aged writer manquee'.  We never forgave each other that.)               
                                                                                
     Q.  Do you base your characters on real people?  They seem                 
         so real.                                                               
                                                                                
     A.  I don't think you can make them real unless they                       
         are really part of yourself at some level.  Actually,                  
         after a while characters seem to take on a life of their               
         own.  It's not just practice.  They are partly stored in               
         the computer.  They get more interesting as you work                   
         with them.                                                             
                                                                                
     Q.  Sounds spooky!  Aren't you ever afraid they'll take                    
         over?                                                                  
                                                                                
     A.  Well, that's a common plot for horror fantasy, but it                  
         just doesn't happen.  The composing computer is                        
         incredibly complex, but it doesn't create.  It's more                  
         like a magic mirror from a fairy tale, that shows you                  
         your greatest hopes and fears.                                         
                                                                                
 (...as if that were any less dangerous.  And here I am in a blue funk          
 with my mountains melting.  Damn, but it's cold here.)                         
                                                                                
                                                                                
      "Thanks for the interview, Ms.  Norris.  Say, I was wondering...          
 but it's an awfully big favor."                                                
                                                                                
      "What?"                                                                   
                                                                                
      "Well, like I said, I'm studying to be a composer.  And I noticed         
 you're having a little trouble with the scenery today.  Mind if I fix          
 it up a little bit?"                                                           
                                                                                
      Margaret sighs.  "Be my guest.  I've given up on taping today             
 anyway."                                                                       
                                                                                
      Beyond the window the mountains are boiling like clouds.  The             
 reporter stares at them.  A snap like a shutter, and they freeze into          
 postcard outlines, with the Matterhorn dead center.  "Greetings from           
 Zermatt" half visible in the lower right-hand corner.                          
                                                                                
      Outside, the mechanic has been replacing parts in their engine.           
 There are red and yellow rubber things and coiled black hoses.  He             
 slams the hood down and walks away.                                            
                                                                                
      "Honestly, I don't think the Matterhorn is visible from here."            
                                                                                
      He shrugs.  "It's Switzerland.  They'll never notice.  Well,              
 thanks again.  Ciao!"                                                          
                                                                                
      He climbs into his Porsche and starts the motor.  Reporter, car           
 and postcard mountains vanish in an almost audible click.  Logout,             
 tape off, power down.                                                          
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
      God, I feel awful, Margaret thinks.  I'll have to erase the whole         
 chapter, start over from the backup tape or even from Venice.  "Margot         
 dear," she says, "I really don't feel like working today.  Shall we            
 take a few days off and start over?  Maybe where you leave Claude in           
 Venice."                                                                       
                                                                                
      Margot pats her hand.  "No problem.  But we've come so far today,         
 perhaps we should walk through to the pass scene, just to get the feel         
 of it."                                                                        
                                                                                
      Margaret hesitates, then agrees.  A rehearsal will make it easier         
 later.  If only the mountains would stop heaving.                              
                                                                                
      "Stop," she whispers, and they freeze back into mountains.  But           
 they are wrong mountains, more like bedpillows.  She sits while Margot         
 pays the bill, fighting down feelings that come in waves, a wave of            
 nausea, of memories of Paul, of cold, of weariness, that terrible              
 nostalgia for sleep.                                                           
                                                                                
      "I'm so tired," she says.                                                 
                                                                                
      "We'll be done soon." They leave the empty cafe.  Their car is            
 waiting for them.  Margot takes the wheel again.  Margaret lies back           
 in the seat.  She closes her eyes.  Remember Switzerland.                      
 Fundamentally....                                                              
                                                                                
      On the road again in the alpine air, Margaret finds she can think         
 more clearly.  The mountains are almost certainly proper mountains.            
 They show no tendency to shift.  Perhaps the break at the gas station          
 was what the plot needs.  A break from the panic.  What to use in              
 place of the reporter?                                                         
                                                                                
      No matter, this is just a rehearsal.  They will drive to the top          
 of the pass and walk through the scene there.  Then Margaret will go           
 home and take a hot bath.  A clean flannel nightgown lies across the           
 bed, with clean sheets.  In a distant dream Margaret senses her body           
 waiting patiently at the composing machine, strapped and studded like          
 a space explorer.  She smiles at it.  Hello body.  I'm coming home.            
                                                                                
      They are well above the snowline now.  Italy has vanished into            
 blue mist.  A milepost passes.  Three kilometers.  Another switchback,         
 and the col opens around them.  Two granite peaks frame a glittering           
 saddle of snow, slashed the road to the border.  The sky is deep blue          
 without clouds.  The high mountain wind smells of Switzerland.                 
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
      Margot steps on the brakes.                                               
                                                                                
      The gray Mercedes blocks the road.  A tall man in a trenchcoat is         
 leaning against it, waiting.  The sun glares silver on something in            
 his hand.  His hat is over his eyes.                                           
                                                                                
      The women get out of the convertible.                                     
                                                                                
      "Go away," says Margaret.  "Go away.  We are rehearsing."                 
                                                                                
      The man may have nodded.  It is hard to tell in the glare of the          
 snow.                                                                          
                                                                                
      Margot is walking toward him.  "Careful, Margot.  I'm not sure he         
 understands." Margot touches the man's sleeve and they embrace.  As he         
 turns in the kiss Margaret can see his profile.                                
                                                                                
      "Constantin Falcon!" she exclaims.  "You're in the wrong novel!"          
                                                                                
      They turn to her together, their arms still touching, the gesture         
 of old lovers.  (Our gesture!) He raises his gun.                              
                                                                                
      This has gone too far.  I must wake up!                                   
                                                                                
      Margaret flees across the snow that lies smooth and clean in all          
 directions.  It glitters and blinds in the sun.  Red specks lie                
 scattered over it like drops of blood.  Butterflies, dead on the snow.         
 She struggles to rise through sleep.                                           
                                                                                
      But it is so cold.  Her body lies passive before the flickering           
 lights.  She can't seem to focus on awakening.  She stumbles, falls            
 heavily in the snow.                                                           
                                                                                
      They are standing over her.                                               
                                                                                
      "Go away!  You're just part of my depression!  I shouldn't have           
 been working today.  I was upset about Paul.  I just need some rest.           
 You aren't real.  You can't kill me."                                          
                                                                                
      "Why not?" asks the Falcon.  "We already killed Paul."                    
                                                                                
      Margot brushes back a strand of hair.  She smiles, revealing              
 small, perfect teeth.  Like the teeth of a skull.                              
                                                                                
      The Falcon laughs.  "Shall I shoot her now, Margot?"                      
                                                                                
      "No, dear, she doesn't own a gun."                                        
                                                                                
      Margaret crawls away.  She must wake up.  She must escape.  If I          
 can only reach the peak.  It's the snow that's killing me.  I have to          
 reach the rocks.  But the rocks are so far away.  I can hardly see             
 them through the glare.                                                        
                                                                                
      Far and away on all sides the snow lies smooth as a bedsheet.             
 The red disks lie scattered like stars, thicker now, more insistent.           
                                                                                
      Behind her, she hears Margot's voice.                                     
                                                                                
      "Stand up, dear.  Walk to the bathroom."                                  
                                                                                
      She feels her distant body rise, unplug the cords, walk slowly            
 across the floor.  I must wake up!  She struggles through the layers           
 of sleep, but they lie heavy on her like water.                                
                                                                                
      Far away, in a world not attached to her, she sees her hand open          
 the medicine chest, remove the bottle of sleeping pills.  Margot's             
 voice floats directionless over the snow.  "Pour a glass of water.             
 Swallow them all.  All the pills."                                             
                                                                                
      She sees it all happening, tiny and clear, as if through an icy           
 lens which sits in the back of her head and focuses her thoughts.              
                                                                                
      This is not real.  I can control this.  I am just in my mind.             
                                                                                
      And in the brainlike computer.                                            
                                                                                
      No, that is ridiculous.  They are not something outside.  They            
 are not robots, or monsters.  They are part of me.                             
                                                                                
      But that is the worst of it.                                              
                                                                                
      I must wake up.                                                           
                                                                                
      She stretches her arm toward the distant rocks, forces her mind           
 upwards toward waking.  The peak wavers and shrinks.  Her hand almost          
 merges with that other hand, which holds the bottle.  They brush,              
 almost catch each other.  Then the lens melts.                                 
                                                                                
      She sags into the snow.  It warm under her body.  Far away, the           
 other body sets down the empty bottle, walks slowly to the bedroom.            
 There are clean sheets on the bed.  The other Margaret crawls into             
 bed, turns over, hugs the pillow.                                              
                                                                                
      So this is what it is like.  I read somewhere that death by               
 freezing was like sleep, and warm.  Like the sleep after love.                 
                                                                                
      Lying here in the snow she can see that the red disks have become         
 scattered rose petals.  She touches one.  It lies in a little hollow           
 in the snow, melted by sunlight.                                               
                                                                                
      Where did I get roses?  she thought.  I had meant them to be              
 butterflies.

  The Magazine of the Dargon Project         Editor:  Dafydd <White@DUVM>       
                                                                                
     DargonZine is an electronic  magazine printing stories written for         
 the Dargon Project, a shared-world  anthology similar to (and inspired         
 by)  Robert  Asprin's Thieves'  World  anthologies,  created by  David         
 "Orny" Liscomb in his now retired magazine, FSFNet. The Dargon Project         
 centers around a medieval-style duchy called Dargon in the far reaches         
 of the  Kingdom of  Baranur on  the world named  Makdiar, and  as such         
 contains stories with a fantasy fiction/sword and sorcery flavor.              
      DargonZine  is  (at  this  time)  only  available  in  flat-file,         
 text-only format. For  a subscription, please send a  request via MAIL         
 to the editor,  Dafydd, at the userid  White@DUVM.BitNet. This request         
 should contain your full userid (logonid and node, or a valid internet         
 address) as  well as your  full name. InterNet (all  non-BitNet sites)         
 subscribers will  receive their  issues in  Mail format.  BitNet users         
 have  the option  of specifying  the file  transfer format  you prefer         
 (either  DISK  DUMP,  PUNCH/MAIL,   or  SENDFILE/NETDATA).  Note:  all         
 electronic subscriptions are Free!
