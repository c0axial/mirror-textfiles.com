      Not only does this month mark the end of a decade, it also flags          
 the end of Athene's very first volume.  It seems that the beginning of         
 the nineties makes as good of a place as any to start the next one.            
                                                                                
      Keeping with the spirit, Athene will also be sporting a new look          
 after this issue, helped in part by an upgrade in the software used to         
 make the PostScript editions.  I was tempted to incorporate some of            
 the improvements into this month's issue, but decided against it for           
 two reasons.  Most importantly, I wanted to maintain some consistency          
 within the issues of this volume.  Secondly, this one was already late         
 enough as it was.                                                              
                                                                                
      Speaking of late, expect January's issue to come out in the               
 second half of the month.  I will be gone on vacation from December 21         
 through January 6, and so I won't be able to read my mail, much less           
 work on the magazine.  Since my size purges mail older than two weeks          
 of age, there is a good chance that any mail sent before December 26th         
 will get lost.  Because of this, I wouldn't try to contact me until            
 after that date.                                                               
                                                                                
      Dan pointed out an error with the Quanta information in last              
 month's issue.  The Bitnet node listed is incorrect, and should be             
 CMCCVB instead of CMUCCVMA.                                                    
                                                                                
      I would like to thank everyone who contributed stories since the          
 last issue!  This month brought in more submissions than usual, a              
 trend I only hope will continue as Athene gains more readers.                  
 Finally, I send a big "thank you" to you, the readers, for your great          
 support and encouragement throughout these first few issues!

 ======================================================================         
                                                                                
      Jesus Millagros looked up from under the blue '57 Chevy in his            
 small Los Angeles garage to see a fish-faced man snooping around the           
 auto-body-parts littered the shop.                                             
                                                                                
      "May I help you, Mister," he asked as he rolled out from under            
 the car and wiped his hands on his greasy coveralls.  The fish-faced           
 stranger cautiously approached the small Mexican man and took his hand         
 firmly.                                                                        
                                                                                
      "Name's Azul, Gordon Azul, and I wonder if you can do a job for           
 me."                                                                           
                                                                                
      The stranger led Jesus out into the parking lot to a brand new            
 1973 tan Volare.  There was no licence plate on the car and it still           
 bore the dealer's decals upon its windows.  "Caramba!" Jesus cried.            
 "Great wheels, man.  I'll bet Nixon can't afford one of these!" The            
 stranger said nothing.  He went to the trunk, opened it, and with-             
 drew a roll of technical drawings and blueprints.  He brought these            
 over to Jesus and spread them out on the hood.                                 
                                                                                
      "I want you to make some alterations," the stranger said.                 
                                                                                
      Jesus studied the drawings with care.  He was not at all sure             
 what all the symbols stood for--he had no idea what the equations              
 scrawled along the margins of the document meant--but he easily                
 recognized most of the parts and modifications specified in the body           
 of the plans.                                                                  
                                                                                
      "You want to do this to a car?!?  Are you sure you don't want to          
 be talkin' to a rocket scientist instead of me, man?  This is some             
 pretty weird shit.  Even my brother Julio doesn't have a car that..."          
                                                                                
      Gordon took his hands from the diagrams where they had held the           
 sheets spread out on the hood of the car and grabbed the Mexican's             
 shirt by its wide collars, hoisting him into the air.                          
                                                                                
      "Can you do it?" Gordon hissed between closed teeth.                      
                                                                                
      Startled, the little man was happy to oblige this ill-tempered            
 honkey.  "Yeah, sure man!  You pay and Jesus will play!  I'll make any         
 changes you want--just put me down!" Gordon dropped him, turned                
 around, and began walking away, down the street.                               
                                                                                
      "I'll be back on Friday," he said over his shoulder.                      
                                                                                
      Jesus gathered himself up, straightened his collar, and picked up         
 the blueprints.  As he did this, a wad of crisp C-notes fell to the            
 ground out of the papers.  "Holy Maria," Jesus said to himself as he           
 walked back into the garage, crossing himself and counting his loot.           
                                                                                
                                                                                
      Jesus worked diligently over the next five days.  He spent a lot          
 of time in the mechanical engineering section of the UCLA library, as          
 well as in the sections on experimental physics and applied                    
 thermodynamics.  He ordered parts from parts houses all over the               
 basin.  A few had to come from as far away as San Diego, Chicago, and          
 Duluth.  He spent every waking hour in the project, often working 23           
 hour days.  A few of the parts he had to machine himself, relying              
 primarily upon the technical specifications given in the blueprints.           
 The lamps of the garage burned continuously as Jesus shaped and                
 rearranged the guts of the infernal machine.  As he was working, he            
 had no idea what end this engine was meant to perform.  After he had           
 finished installing a set of parts, he would try out various theories          
 as to their function.  None suited him.  In all of his fifteen years           
 as an auto-mechanic and body man, he had never seen anything as                
 strange as the components he was so meticulously packing into that tan         
 Volare.                                                                        
                                                                                
      By sunrise on Friday morning, the job was complete.  Every                
 modification had been performed.  Every technical specification                
 fulfilled.  Jesus stood back and admired what he had wrought as the            
 early rays of the sun glinted on the chrome of his beloved.  "I wonder         
 when the gringo will show," he wondered to himself.  "Time enough for          
 a test drive, maybe?" "Naah, better not," he thought, remembering the          
 strength of his mysterious customer.  "It could use some paint,                
 though..."                                                                     
                                                                                
                                                                                
      Gordon arrived at sunset to find a glistening tan Volare (with            
 three new coats of tan paint) fully equipped with front and rear               
 hydraulics.                                                                    
                                                                                
                                                                                
      A red stripe starting from the front fender on each side made its         
 way along the sides of the car, expanding and finally exploding in a           
 blaze of glory in red-yellow-orange flames painted on the rear                 
 fenders.  Raised, knife- blade encrusted, Spartacus-style hubcaps              
 finished the masterpiece.  Jesus Millagros stood with his arms crossed         
 in pride as Gordon completely ignored every one of these cosmetic              
 additions.                                                                     
                                                                                
      "Is it done?" Gordon asked bluntly.                                       
                                                                                
      "Yes!  She is finished!" Jesus beamed back at him.  He had                
 expected at least some praise for the fine job he'd performed, but             
 none was forth- coming.                                                        
                                                                                
      "Good," said Gordon.  "Here's your money," he said as he handed           
 Jesus another wad of 100's.  "Get in."                                         
                                                                                
      Jesus was perplexed.  "Is she not beautiful, senor?  Don't you            
 want to open her up and look her over?  Her parts have been installed          
 just as you ordered.  She is..."                                               
                                                                                
      "Get in," Gordon repeated, as he opened the door and lowered              
 himself into the driver's seat.  Jesus said nothing as he got into the         
 car (pausing to admire the fiery sheen of the hood as it was                   
 illuminated by the dying rays of the sun.) Gordon started the engine,          
 and to Jesus, it purred beautifully, although with a dampened fury             
 that he'd never heard in a car before.                                         
                                                                                
      "We're going for a test drive," Gordon said.  "Ever been to the           
 Los Angeles Speedway?"                                                         
                                                                                
      "Sure, many times, Senor." Jesus was disgusted.  Cars were his            
 life.  He lived, ate, and breathed paint primer, axle grease, and              
 ether (respectively).  Ever since he had worked on his first                   
 automobile at the age of thirteen, he had always served the steel,             
 chrome, and glass god with a zeal that was atypical, even in his               
 neighborhood.  This car, in which they were now passing under the              
 amber streetlamps of Greater L.A., had become his idol.  It was                
 mysterious and beautiful and it seemed to have a power that was not of         
 this world.  It had taken every bit of knowledge and expertise that            
 Jesus had acquired over the years to assemble this monster of                  
 mechanical mastery.                                                            
                                                                                
      As they pulled into the unlit speedway, the security guard was            
 conspicuously absent.  Gordon slowly pulled onto the track and put the         
 transmission in park.  "Get out," he said.  Jesus got out of the car.          
 "You're here in case anything goes wrong.  I'm going to make three             
 laps around the track to pick up speed.  Stay out of the way.  I don't         
 want your intertia to slow me down one bit.  If I haven't made the             
 third lap in twenty seconds or less, I want you to wave this                   
 flashlight at me," he said handing a flashlight to the mechanic.  "Got         
 it?" Jesus nodded his head.  "Do you have a watch?" Gordon asked.              
                                                                                
      "Several," Jesus replied.                                                 
                                                                                
      "Good."                                                                   
                                                                                
      Jesus closed the passenger's door and stepped out of the way.             
 Gordon revved the engine several times and threw the car into gear.            
 The wheels squealed and the car was gone, already well into its first          
 lap.  Jesus bit his lip.                                                       
                                                                                
      The small man looked at his watch.  The Volare did its first lap          
 in sixty-one seconds.  The second in thirty.  Jesus swayed to the              
 music of the high-pitched squeal of the engine.  As the car came               
 around for its last lap, he studied it carefully.  It was going over           
 three- hundred miles per hour, and yet it seemed to be handling as if          
 it were only doing sixty.  Tears welled in his eyes as he saw his              
 beautiful beast race by for what would be the last time.  Gordon was           
 finishing his last lap.  Sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, he was almost           
 around...  nineteen...  Jesus trembled with the beauty and excitement          
 of the thing he had helped to bring to life.  Twenty!  Gordon was              
 around!...but he wasn't stopping.  Faster and faster he went.  The car         
 continued to race around the track, its tires beginning to glow redly.         
 The high- pitched wine had become a wail.  The air crackled and                
 smelled faintly of ozone.  The ground shuddered.  The sky opened up.           
 Great hosts of angels came down and danced and flitted around Jesus'           
 head.  Suddenly, a great wall of flame sprang up in front of the               
 five-speed, automatic, family-sedan-shaped demon.                              
                                                                                
                                                                                
      And in an instant, it was over.                                           
                                                                                
                                                                                
      An explosion rocked the ground.  An enormous fireball shot from           
 the place where the car had (apparently) collided with the barrier             
 wall.  Flaming shards of metal and ash rained down upon Jesus' head as         
 he watched the brilliant demise of his beloved.  All that remained was         
 the chassis and tires (all blown).  The hydraulics had remained in             
 tact.  The skeleton of the car sat in flames as it jerked up and down          
 with the nervous twitch of a decapitated insect.  Other than that, all         
 was still--except for the crackling of the embers which rained down            
 upon Jesus' head.                                                              
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                 * * *                                          
                                                                                
                                                                                
        Jesus wept.                                                             
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                 * * *                                          
                                                                                
                                                                                
      Gordon's eyes felt as though they were going to jump out of their         
 sockets, turn a cartwheel in the air before him, salute, and whistle           
 "Dixie" in the cloud of ammonia that had coalesced about his body.             
 Upon his exit of the car (in 1972) the glass of the windshield had             
 retorn his face on each side from the edges of his mouth to his ears.          
 It had not taken much force to reopen the scar tissue along the sides          
 of his face and the auto-glass had not yet melted from the heat of the         
 explosion.  Gordon, of course, had had nothing to fear from the                
 destruction wreaked by his slightly modified 1973 Volare.  He had left         
 1972 and was now hurtling backward through a glassy tunnel filled with         
 the past events of his own life.  He struggled to raise his hand to            
 his wound.  The viscous liquid that encircled him restricted his               
 motion and, in the end, he gave up all attempts at wiping away the             
 blood and simply rode the current.  The life of a time-traveller is            
 never easy.  The horrors of life: college, boot camp, and the senior           
 prom, hurtled past him with dizzying speed.  Occasionally, a figure in         
 the menagerie would reach out and try to draw him into one of the              
 blurry scenes.  Mary Jo Simpleton, summer camp, eleventh grade,                
 necking in the woods.  Her tiny hand pressed through the walls of the          
 multicolored tunnel, glowing redly for an instant before receding into         
 the mists of time.  Attempting to reorient his hurtling body, Gordon           
 managed to get his face up over the rest of his body, but his feet             
 kept wanting to fly up behind him, forcing him into a double                   
 somersault.  Finally, he managed to face forward (or backward,                 
 temporally) in a more or less upright sitting position.                        
                                                                                
      Up ahead, at the end of the tunnel, was darkness.  He was now             
 nearing the end of *his* portion of the journey.  Scenes of his early          
 years were now flitting by with an ever-increasing speed so they               
 appeared about as dim as did his memories of those same years.  From           
 the end of the tunnel a great wailing noise resounded.  Someone was in         
 great pain.  Suddenly, legs spread wide surrounding a large vagina             
 loomed before him.  Would he be able to make it?  "I really shouldn't          
 have eaten that cheeseburger in '73," Gordon thought to himself,               
 remembering the size and weight restrictions imposed by time travel.           
 He braced himself for impact.  The soft material, at this speed, had           
 the force of hitting a brick wall at thirty miles per hour.  Just              
 barely, he squeezed through the small opening.  An instant later,              
 Gordon lost consciousness in the sweet taste of amniotic fluid.                
                                                                                
                                                                                
      The surgeon looked nervous behind his white mask.  This woman was         
 far too old to be having a child.  The labor had already been hell             
 (the last seventy-two hours of it.) However, it now looked as though           
 she was going to make it.                                                      
                                                                                
      "That's it, Mrs.  Azul.  Easy.  Now B R E A T H !  That's good!"          
 A nurse blotted the sweat-covered forehead of the middle-aged woman,           
 whose screams and moans filled the delivery room.  "We're just about           
 there, Mrs.  Azul.  Now one or two more good pushes, and we'll have            
 him," said the Doctor.  He now took an instrument that vaguely                 
 resembled ice-tongues and approached the birth canal.  "I'm going to           
 have to pull him out by the head," the doctor warned.  "Now, when I            
 give you the signal, push.  OK, now, PUSH!"                                    
                                                                                
      The doctor reached into the body cavity and now pulled at the             
 tiny head that appeared at the opening with his metal instrument.              
 "One more time." He almost had him, then, there was the sound of an            
 explosion somewhere within the body of the middle-aged woman.  The             
 doctor lost his grip upon the baby, badly scarring its tiny face on            
 each side from its little blue mouth to its little blue ears.  This            
 child would carry these scars for the rest of his life.  The doctor            
 fell backward on the floor as the woman's body shuddered again.  There         
 was another dampened explosion and a loud "Pop!" and suddenly the baby         
 shot out of the opening, flew five feet across the room, and landed in         
 a pile of linens that were being stored there.  A nurse rushed over to         
 the place where the baby had landed.                                           
                                                                                
      The EKG responded with a steady "Beeeeeeeeeeeeee..." The woman            
 was dead.  Suddenly, the scream of a newborn infant's first tears              
 filled the room.  There was much applause.

           Phillip  is a  senior,  majoring  in Philosophy  at                  
           Mississippi  State  University.  His  philosophical                  
           interests  center   around  epistemology,  literary                  
           criticism,  and the  philosophy  of language.   His                  
           current philosophical project has been to "whip the                  
           dead  horse  of  Logical  Positivism  until  it  is                  
           nothing  but a  bloody pulp."  Even so,  he remains                  
           convinced that Rudolph Carnap is one of the premier                  
           philosophers  of the  last two  centuries, next  to                  
           C.S.   Peirce.   He  has also  been  influenced  by                  
           contemporary literature,  especially Thomas Pynchon                  
           and    Allain   Robbe-Grillet.     Phillip's   most                  
           noteworthy accomplishment to date,  he says, is his                  
           marriage  to the  "beautiful and  talented" Rebecca                  
           Beattie McReynolds.

 ======================================================================         
                                                                                
      "Don't worry," I said to her in a calm voice as we sat in my room,        
 which was darkened just enough to project the right mood for a first           
 hypnosis session (well, that's what I've read).  "I can't make you do          
 anything you don't want to do, and this first session will only get you        
 prepared for later.  You won't forget anything, and it won't even seem         
 like you're under hypnosis."                                                   
                                                                                
      She nodded and smiled.  "I'm not worried," she said, "I don't know        
 if you know it or not, but everyone at school trusts you."                     
                                                                                
      I nodded, while laughing a little bit inside.  The small two-page         
 hypnosis guide I got from the local computer hacker was the only thing         
 separating me from all the other people at the high school, including          
 Sandy.                                                                         
                                                                                
      "Now, I want you to sit back and relax." I took a candle out of my        
 desk drawer.  Her eyes, which had begun to drift closed, popped open.          
                                                                                
      "What's the candle for?" she asked, not as suspiciously as                
 curiously.                                                                     
                                                                                
      What was it that the "Guide to Hypnotism" had said?                       
                                                                                
      "The candle is to, uh, relax and calm you, so your mind is more           
 susceptible to suggestion.  That way, I can begin to prepare you for           
 the next session."                                                             
                                                                                
      "Oh, okay." She closed her eyes, and left it at that.  I honestly         
 don't know why these people trust me.  I certainly wouldn't trust              
 myself.                                                                        
                                                                                
      "Now, relax and concentrate on the candle flame.  Watch the flame         
 slowly move back and forth.  As it moves back and forth, you can feel          
 yourself becoming calmer.  All your stress leaves your body, and you           
 are completely relaxed.  Your mind is floating free of all tensions,           
 and your worries have left you." My relaxing talk went on for a few            
 more minutes, but I was wondering if I really needed it.  After all,           
 everybody always seemed to be completely relaxed in my presence.               
                                                                                
      "You are now experiencing hypnosis," I said in my soft tones, "and        
 it does not feel in the least bit menacing.  This is but the first in a        
 series of hypnosis sessions which will increase your self assurance and        
 my Biology grade.  You can now open your eyes and the hypnosis session         
 will be concluded."                                                            
                                                                                
      As she opened her eyes I blew out the candle and walked over to           
 the window.  I pulled the shade down, and it rolled back up into place         
 at the top of the window.  Light filled the room.                              
                                                                                
      "Well, that's all for today," I said to Sandy.  "We can do this           
 again...  maybe next week?"                                                    
                                                                                
      "Sure, that'd be nice," she said in a relaxed tone.  My little            
 suggestions seemed to work wonders.                                            
                                                                                
                                                                                
      On Wednesday, I called Sandy and asked if she could come over on          
 Friday.  She said she could stop by for a few minutes, but she was             
 planning on doing things Friday night.  I didn't bother to ask what.           
 Partying's not my kind of thing.  If I lost control of my faculties, I         
 might let it slip that I'm not as competent as they all think I am.            
 And I can't let that happen.                                                   
                                                                                
      Friday, after school, I met Sandy on the way to the school parking        
 lot.  I don't have a car, and it's just as well because I'd probably           
 wreck it in a split second.                                                    
                                                                                
      Now let me make this perfectly clear-- Sandy's a really nice girl,        
 and she's actually quite pretty, but I was never interested in her.            
 Really.  Now, I know that guys like me always seem to have a reputation        
 for slobbering all over any girl who might give us the time of day, but        
 that's just not true.  Besides, my friend Steve always had it bad for          
 Sandy.  He wanted her.  Everywhere she went, he followed.  In fact, he         
 was the one who suggested I get Sandy as my subject.                           
                                                                                
      Do you get the impression that my hypnosis experiment wasn't              
 exactly based on scientific curiosity?  Very smart, my friend, very            
 smart.  Indeed it wasn't.                                                      
                                                                                
      So, anyway, Sandy and I got into her car, a cute little '68               
 Mustang, and we drove on over to my house.  She had her car radio              
 blasting "Tequila Sunrise" and was wearing tight blue jeans and a denim        
 jacket.  I must tell you, I felt like quite an important guy, riding           
 out of the high school parking lot in a hot car, driven by a cute babe,        
 blasting some tunes.  And we were going back to my house, no less.  Not        
 bad.                                                                           
                                                                                
      Then again, everyone thought I was an expert before then.  No             
 doubt I just hypnotized her into being this way.  Yeah, right.  I              
 couldn't hypnotize a chicken into laying an egg.  Hell, I couldn't             
 hypnotize it into clucking.                                                    
                                                                                
      When we got to my house and had gone inside, I pulled out my              
 calendar and began planning when we'd hold the next four hypnosis              
 sessions over the next week.  Then I'd have the entire week to write up        
 my report and get an excellent grade in Biology.  The teacher loved me,        
 and besides, he probably thought I was an expert too.  My Biology grade        
 was most definitely cake.                                                      
                                                                                
      "Tommy," Sandy said to me in a deep, sexy voice, "I want you to           
 read something of mine.  Would you?"                                           
                                                                                
      My voice went up two octaves, but I still managed to squeak out           
 "Sure!" to her.  Sign me up for the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, and fast.         
 Either that, or gag me and tie me to a tree.                                   
                                                                                
      Sandy took a piece of paper from her purse and handed it to me.  I        
 unfolded it and found that it was a poem.  A love poem.  The first             
 part, "My heart's passion is for you/My life breaks without you near"          
 was really dumb.  But I liked the end bit: "Wherever you go, my Love,/I        
 will follow in the skies above." I mean, she rhymed love and above.            
 Now that's good poetry.                                                        
                                                                                
      "Now that's good poetry," I said to her.                                  
                                                                                
      "Really?  Oh, thanks, Tommy!  I'm so glad you like it!" She gave          
 me a kiss on the cheek.  Sigh.                                                 
                                                                                
      After we completed our little planning session and poetry                 
 workshop, we headed for the door.  As I opened my front door for her, I        
 began to speak out words that I had been composing for all of-- well,          
 all of two seconds.  They dropped right out of my mouth.                       
                                                                                
      "I really want to thank you, Sandy.  Without you, my Biology grade        
 would be in serious trouble." Yeah, sure.  "And you know how hard it           
 would have been for me to find anyone willing to volunteer to be               
 hypnotized-- hypnotism scares people." Mister humble.                          
                                                                                
      She batted her eyelashes at me, in a way that made me wish Steve          
 was here to see it.  "Oh, Tommy," she said, "every girl I know would           
 have done this.  Anything to be able to experience you in action." I           
 don't know whether there was an underlying meaning to that statement,          
 but I was afraid to find out.                                                  
                                                                                
      "Oh.  Well, whatever," I said.                                            
                                                                                
      I guess I'm just the master of impromptu speaking.  Somebody              
 please stop me, before I stick both of my feet in my mouth.                    
                                                                                
      She bid me farewell, muttering a typical high school "seeyalater",        
 and was about to turn around when my good buddy Steve, wonderful master        
 of timing Steve, walked up the driveway.  Sandy turned around, and,            
 seeing him, smiled politely.  She then turned around, crossed her eyes         
 at me, and got into her car.  I guess it was her sly way of telling me         
 that she liked me better than him.                                             
                                                                                
      Sandy had started up the car and driven out when Steve's voice            
 crept into my head.                                                            
                                                                                
      "Oh, man, she smiled at me," he was saying in his pathetic                
 love-induced tone which I had heard far too much for comfort.  "This is        
 great.  Now look, Tom.  I called her up, begged her to call you, and           
 she's now your hypnosis subject.  She wouldn't have done it if it              
 weren't for me."                                                               
                                                                                
      I didn't have the heart to mention about how well-loved I was,            
 about how all of the girls wanted me to pick them for my Biology               
 project.                                                                       
                                                                                
      "So you've got to do this for me, Tom." Then he started with his          
 scheme.  "We agreed that if I got Sandy to be your guinea pig, you'd           
 hypnotize her into loving me."                                                 
                                                                                
      "Oh, was that the plan, Steve?  I seem to recall something vaguely        
 along those lines." I had agreed to Steve's plan, of course.  If you've        
 been paying close attention, though, you'll realize that I had                 
 absolutely nothing backing up that little promise of mine.  Relaxing           
 her was going to be tough enough as it was.                                    
                                                                                
      "Good.  Thanks, Tom!" Steve was happy again.  "Can I watch Dave           
 with you?"                                                                     
                                                                                
      Sure, I told him, I'djustloveit.  Watching Letterman with Steve           
 was a seriously lame experience.  Not only were the subtleties of              
 Stupid Pet Tricks beyond his grasp, but even the meaning of Paul               
 Shaffer completely eluded him.  Simpleton.                                     
                                                                                
      He was probably my best friend, though, so I put up with it.              
                                                                                
                                                                                
      Saturday was a pretty lousy day, in the grand scheme of things.  I        
 was, of course, anxiously awaiting my second special session Sunday            
 with Sandy.  You know that any event involving that much alliteration          
 has gotta be good.  But that was still a day away, and so my Saturday          
 was instead spent with Steve.  What a weenie.                                  
                                                                                
      I mean, first off, I had to listen to him moan and complain about         
 Sandy, which was bad enough.  But then he conned me into going to the          
 movies with him.                                                               
                                                                                
      Going to see the new Stallone movie might sound fun to you,               
 especially if you've got the I.Q.  of wood pulp, but to me it sounded          
 like no fun sent down to walk among us in human form.  Come to think           
 of, that was Steve, too.  The personification of no fun.                       
                                                                                
      So, what did I do?  I went to the movies with him on Saturday             
 night, to see Sly blow stuff up.                                               
                                                                                
      About twenty people were outside the theater, in line to see              
 Stallone, I guess.  At the door, one of those typical employees at the         
 Cinema 10 was selling tickets-- he had what I could only call big hair.        
 Piles of it.  Poofing up all over the place.  There were ten screens in        
 the place, all about the size of a shoebox (with mono sound, no less)          
 and they probably had fifteen employees for those ten screens.  And            
 they all had big hair.                                                         
                                                                                
      While Steve was rambling on about one thing or another, about how         
 "cool" it was when Stallone shot at communists or homosexuals or               
 whoever he shoots at, my eyes were scanning the line in front of us.  I        
 was specifically looking at a girl, about seventeen, standing in the           
 middle of the line.  She was about 5'6", with teased blonde hair.  Her         
 lips were shiny with red lipstick, and her eyes were shaded with dark          
 blue eyeshadow.  She looked great.                                             
                                                                                
      From the neck down, it was even better.  She was wearing a tight          
 blouse, her fair-sized breasts straining against the buttons.  She wore        
 a tight leather miniskirt, which drew my attention to her legs, made           
 even more appealing by the black stockings she wore.  And, at the              
 bottom, spiked heels.                                                          
                                                                                
      She looked at me, snapping her gum (they always snap their gum,           
 girls like that), and I stopped slouching, pushed my hair back from my         
 forehead a little, just to be subtle, and smiled at her.  She smiled           
 back, and then licked her lips.  Soft pink tongue over bright, shiny           
 red lipstick.  I wanted her.                                                   
                                                                                
      And Steve was with me, damn him.                                          
                                                                                
      I listened carefully when she and the two girls she was with              
 reached the ticket window, and discovered that they were going to see a        
 comedy.  Thank God-- I wouldn't be able to accept a girl who actually          
 wanted to see Sly in action.  So what if she popped her gum?                   
                                                                                
      Anyway, Steve and I bought our tickets and went into the fifth            
 theater.  In there we found a huge collection of mental misfits, many          
 more than I'd ever seen before.  They wore Rambo T-Shirts.  One couple         
 sang the Over the Top theme while they arm-wrestled.                           
                                                                                
                                                                                
      All of this time, of course, I was planning my escape from Steve.         
 I figured that if I excused myself to go to the bathroom, he'd probably        
 go with me.  Steve was like that.  If I went to get refreshments,              
 though, I might be able to go alone and offer to bring some back for           
 him.  Then I was home free.                                                    
                                                                                
      Steve had me get him a small Coke and a medium popcorn-- he gave          
 me $20 to cover the Coke-and-corn.  My plan worked like a charm.  Of           
 course.  It was my plan, after all.                                            
                                                                                
                                                                                
      The comedy that my girl had gone to see with her two friends              
 started five minutes after ours.  In other words, while Steve sat              
 through the trailers-- which were no doubt advertising another movie           
 featuring an adult and child switching bodies, or maybe a second-rate          
 comedian teamed with a dog, or, better yet, a second-rate comedian             
 switching bodies with a puppy-- I could set about wooing my desire.            
                                                                                
      Wooing my desire-- that's right, isn't it?  That's how the Romeos,        
 the Don Juans of history put it, isn't it?  I doubt they talked about          
 trying to get into a girl's pants.  I really do.  Talk like that was           
 for, uh, uncouth cretins.  So I walked into the still filling theater          
 (it wasn't Bargain Night-- all seats $3, so it wasn't that full) and           
 looked for my woman and her two friends.                                       
                                                                                
      They were six rows back, and three seats in.  My love was on the          
 aisle side, and there were three empty seats next to her.  I set a             
 course for the middle of the three empties, warp factor one Mister             
 Sulu, damn the (photon) torpedoes.                                             
                                                                                
      I sat down in the chair.  Lock phasers on charm.  Then I turned           
 and looked at her, feigning surprise.  She smiled.                             
                                                                                
      "Hi!" she said in a high voice.  Well, I didn't expect poetry.            
                                                                                
      "Hi there," I said, shrewdly, and wiggled my fingers in a sort of         
 low-profile, cutesy wave.                                                      
                                                                                
      "Aren't you Tommy Baker?" she asked me, saying my name in the way         
 you might say the name of a movie star.                                        
                                                                                
      "How do you know that?" I asked in a semblance of modesty.  How           
 did she know it?                                                               
                                                                                
      "Oh, you're kinda famous around school." She cracked her gum.             
 "You're hypnotizing Sandy Chambers, right?"                                    
                                                                                
      "Yeah, that's me." I smiled.  "What's your name?" Oh, I must be           
 the king of originality.                                                       
                                                                                
      "Trish.  Trish Brooks." She paused for a second, but I was                
 enthralled, watching her lips, her eyes, (her breasts), and said               
 nothing.  Fortunately, she continued.  "You know, Sandy's pretty lucky.        
 I would have been glad to let you hypnotize me-- just for a chance to          
 see you in action."                                                            
                                                                                
      Hadn't I heard this somewhere before?                                     
                                                                                
      "Wow.  Thanks." Me, the master of dialogue.                               
                                                                                
      Then a thought came to mind.  I don't know why I did it, but I            
 did.  It just slipped out of my mouth, probably because of some                
 chemical reactions a bit lower down in my body.                                
                                                                                
      "Say," I said slyly, "I don't know about how I'm progressing with         
 Sandy.  I might need some more data from someone else."                        
                                                                                
      She gave sort of a questioning half-smile.  "Really?"                     
                                                                                
      "Sure!  If you're interested, and you have some spare time during         
 a few evenings over the next week or so..."                                    
                                                                                
      "Great!" she said, and smiled again.  Those lips.  Wow.  We               
 watched the movie together, just us and her two friends.                       
                                                                                
      I've never been so glad that Stallone movies tend to run longer           
 than comedies.  I managed to bring Steve his Coke and popcorn toward           
 the end of the climax.                                                         
                                                                                
      "Where have you been?" he asked faintly as he kept his eyes fixed         
 on the screen.                                                                 
                                                                                
      "Long line," I murmured, and handed him his nourishment.  He gave         
 an understanding grunt and left it at that.  What a guy.  What a moron.        
                                                                                
                                                                                
      Sandy was out like a light.  I had really done it-- but, then, one        
 episode of Cosby would have probably done the same thing.  It was a            
 good idea not to get cocky.                                                    
                                                                                
      "Imagine yourself on a cloud," I said.  "You are resting                  
 peacefully, with a slight breeze caressing your gorgeous body." I guess        
 positive reinforcement during hypnosis is always a good idea.                  
                                                                                
      "A tingling sensation begins to work its way through your toes,           
 moving slowly up through your feet, making them warm, heavy, and               
 relaxed."                                                                      
                                                                                
      It was working.  I could see her toes wriggling in her shoes.  I          
 was actually hypnotizing her-- of course, all I had done was put her           
 feet to sleep, which wouldn't exactly get Steve a date.  Unless he had         
 a foot fetish.                                                                 
                                                                                
      "The cloud is soft," I continued in my New And Improved Hypnosis          
 Monotone, "and your body is supported by that softness." The cloud she         
 was lying on was actually my bed.  And no, I didn't buy the Garfield           
 sheets-- my mother did.  Besides, Sandy said that they were cute.              
                                                                                
      "The tingling gently and slowly moves up your sexy legs, relaxing         
 them.  Making them warm and heavy." I theorized that I could probably          
 have had my way with Sandy's kneecaps if I wanted to, but I was much           
 too big a man to do such a thing.                                              
                                                                                
      "That feeling moves slowly into your, uh, chest, making your              
 breathing relaxed as well." With that, she let out a deep sigh, her            
 breasts straining against her shirt as she made her final deep                 
 inhalation.  I knew then that I should have set up the video camera.           
                                                                                
      "And now it reaches your head.  You drift away into the blue sky          
 as you rest blissfully in the cloud." That cloud was exactly where I           
 wanted her.  I figured that it was about time to start the suggestions.        
 Sure it was.                                                                   
                                                                                
      "On a nearby cloud," I began, "you see someone drifting toward            
 you.  As he gets closer and closer, you see that he's unbelievably             
 attractive.  You seem to recognize him from somewhere..."                      
                                                                                
      Sandy was breathing harder and harder.  I wasn't sure if this was         
 the right thing to do-- besides, hypnotism wasn't meant to work so             
 well.  I was afraid that if I suggested that the man on the cloud was          
 Abe Vigoda, Sandy would fall in love with him.                                 
                                                                                
      Nobody should have that kind of power.                                    
                                                                                
                                                                                
      "You told her it was who?"                                                
                                                                                
      Steve needed a little calming.  I theorized that a blow to the            
 head with a frozen TV dinner might do the trick, but I decided to try          
 talking him down.                                                              
                                                                                
      "Tom Cruise.  Don't worry about it.  I decided that it was far too        
 soon to have her fall in love with you." I mean, I wasn't sure if I            
 could hypnotize anyone before, but now I was afraid that I might be too        
 good.                                                                          
                                                                                
      "But why Tom Cruise?" he whined.  I suppose I could have picked           
 some other media stud, like Val Kilmer, Kirk Cameron, William Shatner,         
 or Don Knotts, but I decided that Cruise would be safe.                        
                                                                                
      "I wanted to see how powerful the suggestion would be, stupid!"           
 Oh, yeah, big shot-- make Steve feel dumb.  Choose the hard jobs.              
                                                                                
      "So now she thinks that Tom Cruise wants her to be relaxed?  Why          
 not have her think that he wants her to love me?"                              
                                                                                
      "You don't get it, do you, Steve?  Look." I sat down next to him,         
 placed my hand on his shoulder, and hoped that I could keep physical           
 contact at a minimum.  "My Biology project is supposed to be about             
 hypnosis relieving stress in individuals.  I have to make an effort.           
 Besides, she's got two more sessions, on Wednesday and Friday.  I've           
 got plenty of time to make her love you.  Or want you.  Or whatever you        
 like."                                                                         
                                                                                
      Then Steve did something quite amazing.  He smiled, let out a big         
 laugh, and patted me on the back.  "Thanks, pal!" he said.                     
                                                                                
      It was at this point that I wondered if a nice, smart girl like           
 Sandy deserved a gullible dweeb like Steve, especially considering his         
 horrible hypnosis plot.  I mean, Sandy was one of the most caring and          
 feeling people I had ever met.  She wrote love poems.  She told me that        
 she cries whenever she sees a movie any more dramatic than the Three           
 Stooges.  And sometimes she cries at the Stooges, too.                         
                                                                                
      She was a beautiful person.  Did I really have the right to force         
 her to love a guy like Steve?                                                  
                                                                                
      Fortunately, it was a philosophical argument that I wouldn't have         
 to worry too much about.  I had to get ready-- in a few minutes, I             
 would be having a session with a girl who had teased blonde hair, wore         
 leather minis, and cracked her gum.                                            
                                                                                
                                                                                
      They were pink this time-- her lips, I mean.  And she wore tight          
 jeans and a short top that exposed her waist.  But she was still               
 gorgeous, and I still wanted her.                                              
                                                                                
      Now, I know that I said I couldn't make someone do anything they          
 didn't want to.  But you've got to remember, Trish told me that she'd          
 do anything to see me in action.  So I figured that she probably liked         
 me already.  I just had to bring it out.                                       
                                                                                
      And I know what I said about easing into hypnosis gradually, over         
 several sessions.  But things had gone so well before, with Sandy's            
 relaxation and Tom Cruise on the cloud, that I figured I must have this        
 hypnosis thing down by now.  So I didn't wait-- the first time Trish           
 Brooks came over for a session, we worked our way around to the cloud          
 pretty quick.                                                                  
                                                                                
      The guy on the cloud, the one she was amazingly attracted to, was         
 none other that yours truly.  Who did you think I'd put on Trish               
 Brooks' cloud-- Don Rickles?                                                   
                                                                                
      After I had finished the session, counting from ten back to one,          
 and filling in all of my typical suggestions of rest and relaxation,           
 Trish didn't seem much different.  I guess that she was already                
 interested in me, and so it didn't make much difference.                       
                                                                                
      Standing by the front door, I decided to make my move.  "Trish," I        
 began, "I was wondering if you'd like to do something Friday night." I         
 was getting pretty good at this.                                               
                                                                                
      "Oh--" she smiled for a second, and then frowned.  "I have                
 something to do with my family on Friday night.  It's my sister's              
 birthday."                                                                     
                                                                                
      "Oh..." For a second, I thought that my hypnosis scheme was               
 nothing but a sham, that I was nothing but a phony, a fake, a                  
 charlatan...                                                                   
                                                                                
      "I'm free Saturday night.  How about then?"                               
                                                                                
      ...but just for a second.                                                 
                                                                                
      "Saturday night would be great.  How about dinner and a movie?"           
                                                                                
      "Sounds great," she said, and licked her lips.                            
                                                                                
      I had the power.  I really, really did.                                   
                                                                                
      Of course, I had known it all along.                                      
                                                                                
                                                                                
      It was Thursday when Steve got his list of demands to me.  I had          
 already completed my Wednesday session with Sandy, which had went well,        
 even if it wasn't very exciting.  I wasn't getting much data for my            
 Biology project, but I figured that I'd wait for the final session on          
 Sunday night before interviewing Sandy and assembling the report.              
                                                                                
      Steve's demands were scrawled in blunt pencil on a torn sheet of          
 binder paper-- it wasn't exactly neat.  It looked more like a list of          
 demands that a terrorist might have.  Except, of course, that it said          
 things like "Undying Affection" and "Everlasting Love", not to mention         
 "Faithful Devotion".  It was as if the terrorists had kidnapped the            
 president of Hallmark Cards.                                                   
                                                                                
      On top of all of those demands (which he made as if he was                
 ordering a pizza or something), Steve required that I force Sandy to           
 ask him out on a date.  Steve was so gutless that he couldn't even             
 stand asking out someone who had been bent to his will by my expertise         
 in hypnosis.  What a weenie.                                                   
                                                                                
      So my Friday session with Sandy started to bother me.  When we            
 were in her car, driving to my house, I began asking myself if I really        
 wanted to do this to her.  Steve was just a geek, but Sandy was a              
 beautiful person.  She didn't deserve him.                                     
                                                                                
      As we walked into my house and Sandy sat down on the bed, I tried         
 to think of ways to explain the reasons for my not hypnotizing Sandy.          
 He was such an idiot that I could probably work something up by Sunday,        
 when the experiment ended.  And he'd buy it, as usual.                         
                                                                                
      I mean, really-- who would doubt my word?                                 
                                                                                
                                                                                
      Sandy shifted on my bed as I began to finish my suggestions for           
 the day and bring her out of hypnosis.  The suggestions had been               
 working great, too.  She said that she hadn't gotten into any fights           
 with her parents in the past week, and that she knew that my hypnosis          
 was responsible.  I had no way of knowing if my suggestion that she            
 cluck like a boneless chicken while she was in bed had worked.                 
                                                                                
      "As you awaken," I said, "You'll feel relaxed and invigorated.            
 You will have the confidence to do well in life and in school, the             
 energy to put your best effort into all that you do, and a relaxed             
 attitude which will keep your mind free from stress."                          
                                                                                
      I counted from 20 back to one, and then she slowly opened her             
 eyes.  Her legs trembled a little as she threw her arms above her head         
 and stretched.                                                                 
                                                                                
      "Oh, Tommy," she said, "I feel so great!" She sat up, lifting her         
 head from my pillow, and dangled her feet over the edge of my bed.             
 "You've done so much for me, Tommy," she said.  "I really owe you a            
 lot."                                                                          
                                                                                
      I smiled, deciding that it would be best to be the King o'                
 Humility in this circumstance.                                                 
                                                                                
      "It's no problem, really," I said.  "Besides, you're helping my           
 Biology project along, remember?  Without you, there'd be no Biology           
 project.  You're my subject!  You're the key!"                                 
                                                                                
      Hey-- I had managed to be humble and throw out a big compliment at        
 the same time.  Sometimes I impress even myself.                               
                                                                                
      "How would you like to come with me to Brad Johnson's party               
 tonight?"                                                                      
                                                                                
      Brad Johnson?  The most popular guy at school?                            
                                                                                
      Party?  Me, invited to a party?                                           
                                                                                
      With Sandy?  Me, going to a party with a babe like Sandy?                 
                                                                                
      "Sure!" I said, trying not to sound too excited, but failing.             
 "When would be a good time?"                                                   
                                                                                
      "I'll pick you up at ten," she said.                                      
                                                                                
      "No problem!" I smiled again.  It seemed to work well.                    
                                                                                
      Sandy walked out the door, into the driveway, got in her Mustang,         
 and drove away.                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
      I had just fast forwarded past the end of my pirated copy of              
                                                                                
      "The Full Figured Woman's Workout" that I watched every once in a         
 while and was preparing to watch last night's Letterman when the phone         
 rang.  It was Steve again, and this time he seemed more anxious than           
 ever.                                                                          
                                                                                
      "I just talked to Sandy," he said.                                        
                                                                                
      Uh-Oh.                                                                    
                                                                                
      "We only talked for about a minute.  She said she had to do a lot         
 of things before she goes out tonight."                                        
                                                                                
      "Uh-huh..." I said, trying not to give anything away.                     
                                                                                
      "She didn't ask me out, Tom!  Did you give her the suggestion             
 yet?"                                                                          
                                                                                
      "No, not yet," I said, trying to get him back on the defensive.           
 "I'm still setting it up.  You don't want me to blow this whole thing,         
 do you?"                                                                       
                                                                                
      "You've had three sessions with her, for God's sake!" he cried.           
 "You should have been able to do something by now!  She didn't even            
 want to talk with me!"                                                         
                                                                                
      "Everything will be fine," I lied.  "You'll get your woman, Steve.        
 Don't worry."                                                                  
                                                                                
      "I'd better," he said.  Steve didn't seem to be buying my                 
 explanation.  "So, I'll be over at 7:30, right?"                               
                                                                                
      Huh?                                                                      
                                                                                
      "7:30, Steve?  What's at 7:30?"                                           
                                                                                
      "What do you mean, what's at 7:30?  I'm coming over, and we're            
 going to watch Rambo III!"                                                     
                                                                                
      "Oh...  right.  See you then."                                            
                                                                                
      Those Rambo movies only lasted two hours.  Steve would be gone by         
 9:30.  Plenty of time to get ready for the party.                              
                                                                                
                                                                                
      Yeah, well, Steve got there late, and the movie was over two hours        
 long, so it finished at 9:50.  At least I had enough foresight to              
 change into my party outfit before Steve came over.  He didn't even            
 notice that I was wearing nice clothes.                                        
                                                                                
      As soon as the movie ended, I jumped up and hit the rewind button         
 on my VCR.  I was hoping to get him out of the house as quickly as             
 possible.                                                                      
                                                                                
      There was a knock on the front door.                                      
                                                                                
      Now, any normal person would probably be panicked at such a turn          
 of events.  I mean, I was going to a party with the girl that my friend        
 was in love with, and he was still a little mad about the fact that I          
 hadn't hypnotized her into loving him.  You can see where Steve's              
 misconceptions might lead.  He might come to the conclusion that I had         
 hypnotized her into liking me.                                                 
                                                                                
      I didn't panic, though.  Of course not.  I would find some way            
 out.  I could explain my way out of anything.                                  
                                                                                
      "Wait here, and I'll get the door," I said.  Steve always did as          
 he was told-- he was like a faithful dog in that respect.  Actually, he        
 was like a dog in a lot of respects, one of which was his intelligence.        
                                                                                
      He stayed in the room, just as I thought.                                 
                                                                                
      I went to the door and opened it.  It was Sandy, of course, and           
 she looked better than ever.  She was made up a little more, because           
 she was going to a big party.  And I was going, too.                           
                                                                                
      It was then that I figured out my grand scheme: I'd just yell to          
 Steve that I had to go with my mother somewhere, like to the store, and        
 ask him to close the door behind him when he left.  A perfect plan.            
                                                                                
      That was, of course, when Steve walked out from my room, holding          
 his well-worn Rambo III tape, and looked at Sandy and I with bug-eyes.         
                                                                                
      "Sandy!" he said, shocked.  "What are you doing here?"                    
                                                                                
      I was about to wince.  But I didn't have enough time.                     
                                                                                
      "Tommy and I are going to a party tonight.  Didn't he tell you?"          
                                                                                
      Ouch.                                                                     
                                                                                
      "You're what?" Steve cried.                                               
                                                                                
      Like I said, you can guess the inferences he made.  I had, in his         
 mind, used my hypnotism for evil instead of good.  The ultimate comic          
 book sin.  (I always had a hunch that comic books comprised Steve's            
 entire reading list.)                                                          
                                                                                
      After he was through yelling at me, he ran out the door, screaming        
 something like "Friends don't betray friends!  I'll never be your              
 friend again, you jerk!"                                                       
                                                                                
      I don't remember his exact words.  But you get the idea.                  
                                                                                
      Sandy actually looked a little worried, though.  I tried to               
 reassure her.                                                                  
                                                                                
      "Don't worry," I said.  "He's a real geek-- I should have ditched         
 him years ago.  You know what he did tonight?  He wanted me to watch           
 Rambo III with him." I laughed.                                                
                                                                                
      Sandy laughed a little, too.  "Come on," she said.  We started out        
 to the car.                                                                    
                                                                                
                                                                                
      Brad Johnson's house was filled with all sorts of popular people,         
 most of whom I did not know.  Most of them knew me, though.  I guess I         
 was more famous than popular.                                                  
                                                                                
      "Tommy Baker," one tall, well-muscled guy said, "you're the guy           
 who's hypnotizing Sandy!" He reached out his hand, and shook mine.             
 "Glad to meet you, buddy!" he said, laughed, and drank some more beer.         
                                                                                
      "To tell you the truth," he said, "if I could hypnotize Sandy, the        
 first thing I'd do would be to make her take off her clothes!" He              
 laughed again, and slapped me on the back.                                     
                                                                                
      I wanted to tell him that I wanted to use my power for good, and          
 not evil, but that smelled like something Steve would say.                     
                                                                                
      Sandy came walking over, then, and the guy turned to walk away.           
 As he passed her, he put his fist out in a thumbs-up sign, as if he            
 were a slimmed down, pumped up Roger Ebert (sort of an Ebert without           
 the daily supply of rasinets and goobers), giving me approval.                 
                                                                                
      "Are you having a good time, Tommy?" she asked.                           
                                                                                
      "Sure," I said.  And I was.                                               
                                                                                
      "Great!" she said, "I'm going to go get something to drink.  Would        
 you like me to get you something?" She was being quite hospitable              
 toward me.  I felt more and more relieved that I hadn't made her fall          
 in love with Steve-- especially now that Steve had shown how much of a         
 friend he really was.                                                          
                                                                                
      "Um, I'd like a Coke." I smiled.                                          
                                                                                
      "Just a Coke?"                                                            
                                                                                
      "Yeah, just a Coke."                                                      
                                                                                
      She nodded, turned, and walked across the room.  I kept her in my         
 field of vision as she walked through different groups of people.  Over        
 at the other end of the room, she picked up a can of Coke and a bottle         
 of beer.  Just as she was opening the beer, a girl walked up to her.           
 They began talking.                                                            
                                                                                
      Of course, I have no idea what they actually said.  But I've              
 reconstructed the conversation by considering what happened after it           
 ended.  So pretend that this is like In Search Of..., and I'm Leonard          
 Nimoy (just imagine I've got the pointed ears), and you'll be fine.            
                                                                                
 GIRL:    It was nice of you to bring Tommy to the party.                       
                                                                                
 SANDY:   Well, he's been really nice, and those sessions of ours               
          have helped me a lot. He's done a great job.                          
                                                                                
 GIRL:    Sessions? I thought that you didn't work out and that he              
          had to find a new subject.                                            
                                                                                
 SANDY:   What? Where'd you hear that?                                          
                                                                                
 GIRL:    From Trish Brooks. She says that she's his new subject.               
                                                                                
      (At this point, Sandy set down her beer, an act that I am now             
 very grateful for.  She still held my can of Coke in her hand,                 
 however.  At the same time, another girl joined in the conversation.)          
                                                                                
 GIRL 2:  Consider yourself lucky that Tommy couldn't use you. I                
          heard that his geeky friend Steve was going to have Tommy             
          hypnotize his subject into falling in love with him.                  
                                                                                
 GIRL 1:  Gross!  (This is an assessment that I agree with.)                    
                                                                                
      Then Sandy turned and started walking very quickly toward me,             
 plowing through the groups of people that she had properly skirted             
 around before.                                                                 
                                                                                
      "Tommy, do you have another subject?  And were you going to               
 hypnotize me into falling in love with Steve?" She yelled this to me           
 from halfway across the room.                                                  
                                                                                
      It was at this point that I realized that I might be in the               
 middle of a little confrontation.                                              
                                                                                
      By the time Sandy reached me, she had about six people behind             
 her, three of whom were tall, strong guys.  One of them was that guy           
 who I had talked to earlier-- the "hypnotize her naked" guy.  You              
 remember.                                                                      
                                                                                
      "Um-- well," I stammered, "I'm also having sessions with Trish            
 Brooks."                                                                       
                                                                                
      "That slut!" one of the girls behind her muttered.                        
                                                                                
      "And Steve did want me to hypnotize you into loving him..."               
                                                                                
      I was going to use my diplomatic skills to explain how I had              
 evaluated the situation and decided to use my abilities for good, and          
 not evil, but I didn't have the time.                                          
                                                                                
      That was when Sandy threw that can of Coke at me.  So now you see         
 why I'm glad she set down the beer.  Aluminum is lighter than glass.           
                                                                                
      Then those big guys started advancing on me, as if I had insulted         
 Sandy by even considering to hypnotize her into loving Steve.  As if I         
 had hurt her by adding Trish as a second subject.                              
                                                                                
      I mean, Mister "hypnotize her naked" was even coming to get me.           
 As if he was any better than me.  What a hypocrite.                            
                                                                                
      Nevertheless, he was a big hypocrite, and I've been 5'8" for              
 quite a while now.  So I did the intelligent thing, and ran for my             
 life.                                                                          
                                                                                
      I got home at about 12:30.  The moment I walked in the room, the          
 VCR began taping David Letterman.                                              
                                                                                
      As I slid into bed, I considered the day's events.                        
                                                                                
      It wasn't so bad a day.                                                   
                                                                                
      I had ridden myself of that geek, Steve.  He would no longer              
 plague me with Sylvester Stallone.  The can of Coke only hit me in the         
 shoulder, so I wasn't visibly scarred.  Sandy had found out about the          
 true plan behind my hypnosis project, which meant that it would get            
 back to my Biology teacher.  I suppose it might hurt my Biology grade,         
 especially if I had no project to turn in at all.                              
                                                                                
      But what do I care?  I mean, really.  I'm still me, the same guy          
 I've always been.  I'm still well known around the school, and I was           
 able to control a girl's desires through hypnosis.                             
                                                                                
      And better yet, I had a date the next night.                              
                                                                                
      So what if she cracks her gum?

           Jason  Snell  is  a  sophomore  at  UC  San  Diego,                  
           majoring  in Communication  with a  possible double                  
           major in  either Media or Writing.   He claims that                  
           he  doesn't resemble  the character  in "Master  of                  
           Delusion" one  bit.  His story "Into  Gray" won him                  
           $100  in high  school,  has been  shot  (in a  much                  
           altered form)  as a  student film, and  appeared in                  
           the first issue of  Quanta.  He is currently trying                  
           to write something which  "looks like cyberpunk and                  
           feels  like meaningful  literature."  He says  he's                  
           afraid that  it will come  out looking more  like a                  
           long haiku.

 ======================================================================         
                                                                                
      Thank God it's Wednesday, Johnny thought to himself as he walked          
 home.  It was the only thing that let him let off steam from work.             
 Ever since taking that promotion to first-level manager, things had            
 only gotten worse.  When he was just a programmer, all he had to do            
 was get the job done.  As a manager, he had to meet unreasonable               
 deadlines, deal with the financial analysts, make sure the legal               
 department had okayed everything, listen to his employee's complaints,         
 excuses, and demands and still meet his personal goals.  No wonder             
 some of them took the Concrete Swan Dive.                                      
                                                                                
      He checked his posture.  Gotta be careful, he thought.  If you            
 looked nervous, you were a prime target and the gangs would rip you.           
 If you looked tough, the gangs would still rip you, to see if you              
 really were tough.  Unless you could fight them off or run faster than         
 they could, you'd end up the same way.  Red Stain Street.                      
                                                                                
      The streets hadn't been cleaned in years.  They held the stench           
 of millions of bodily excretions, intentional and otherwise.  The              
 concrete absorbed it all, mixed them into an exquisite odor, and               
 infused the air with it.  Johnny didn't know how the beggars could             
 take it.  Every so often, some new wretches would try to make it on            
 the streets.  Many of them ended up dead, or worse.  Food was                  
 sometimes hard to find.                                                        
                                                                                
      He punched his codeword into the door lock and slid it open.              
 Home, sweet home, Johnny snorted.  The apartment, more like a rabbit           
 hutch he thought, was just large enough for a person to stay sane.  It         
 consisted of a small main room, a tiny bathroom and small kitchenette.         
 A thin mattress occupied one corner, nearly buried beneath a pile of           
 dirty clothes.  A plastic desk, almost too large to fit separated the          
 bed from the rest of the room.  With it went a stained and old chair.          
 The only item of obvious value sat upon the desk -- his deck.                  
                                                                                
      Stepping over piles of dishes, making sure not to spill their             
 contents onto the floor, Johnny threw his backpack on the bed.  Last           
 time, the spoiled food damned near burned through the plastic.                 
 Fortunately, it had only left a dark brown spot on the floor.                  
 Selecting a not too dirty shirt and shorts, he put them on and sat in          
 the chair.                                                                     
                                                                                
      He ran his hands along the deck's smooth worn sides.  It wasn't a         
 top of the line model, but it was good enough, he thought.  Ripping            
 out a new set of diamond fiber patchcords, he plugged one end into the         
 deck, the other into the sockets on the backs of his hands.  The               
 sockets were unnecessary and were expensive as hell, but Johnny had            
 had them since his college days.  It was a mark of pride to him.               
                                                                                
      He felt them seat firmly.  He powered on the deck and adjusted            
 himself in his chair, making sure that his head wouldn't fall and his          
 neck get stiff.                                                                
                                                                                
      The Blind Spot slowly grew and surrounded him.  After a few more          
 seconds, he was in.                                                            
                                                                                
      Information technology had come a long way since Gutenburg first          
 perfected the printing press.  Information, originally kept in the             
 minds of people, could now be stored on paper.  As science and                 
 technology improved, information was stored magnetically, then                 
 optically, finally holographically, although biologically stored               
 information was "coming soon." In this day and age, print truly was            
 dead.                                                                          
                                                                                
      So too had the way people accessed information.  With                     
 bio-technology, direct links to the brain were possible.  Electrical           
 stimulus to the optic nerve made words and pictures appear before              
 one's eyes.  Similar stimuli to the other major nerves created                 
 illusions of sounds, smells, tastes, and touches.                              
                                                                                
      What shall I be tonight, he asked himself.  While out in the Net,         
 he could, through the correct programming, make himself look to others         
 like anyone he could imagine.  He settled on his usual persona,                
 himself with some cosmetic defects erased.  He was comfortable in it,          
 like a favorite pair of pants.  It also meant he didn't have to                
 role-play or over-play any specific caricature.                                
                                                                                
      He'd been out countless numbers of times, yet it was always a             
 thrill.  Leaving his home node, he entered the Net.                            
                                                                                
      A comfortable darkness surrounded him; then suddenly a thousand           
 and more brightly lit points, other data on the Net, appeared before           
 him; like fireflies, they were constantly in motion.  There were so            
 many of them, you couldn't discern a pattern.  It looked like chaos            
 itself.                                                                        
                                                                                
      Though potentially as infinite as space itself, the Net reflected         
 the thoughts of those who'd given birth to it.  He was almost                  
 completely surrounded by the many structures that seemed to form a             
 tunnel surrounding the main routes, partially protecting newcomers             
 from acrophobia, though it was not the sky that caused the fear, but           
 rather the Net itself.                                                         
                                                                                
      Pundits called the Net an electronic counterpart to the human             
 circulatory system.  Data packets were the red blood cells, holding            
 the vital information, transferring it from one "cell" to another, in          
 much the same way as the real one transferred oxygen.  The analogy             
 broke down in two places.  The Net's pathways were bidirectional, and          
 users were considerable more than mere red-blood cells.                        
                                                                                
      As Johnny traversed the Net's routes, he could see the myriad             
 institutions that lined this portion of the Net.  The highly                   
 symmetrical and sterile multinational subnetworks, the more loosely            
 arranged but just as large universities and research centers, and the          
 small fry, the haphazard public networks.                                      
                                                                                
      He went at his usual pace, checking if anything new had been              
 added, something worth checking out.  There was nothing new this time,         
 which surprised him.  Normally the turnover rate was pretty high.              
                                                                                
      He stayed on the normal routes.  Stray too far and you might get          
 lost permanently, as though the red blood cell decided to take a tour          
 of the rest of the human body.  A very few had gotten lost and made            
 their way back, telling stories of demons, which were definitely not           
 believed.                                                                      
                                                                                
      He was also very careful not to approach certain nodes too                
 closely.  Though quiescent enough now, if approached the wrong way,            
 especially the multinationals, their defensive sub-systems would               
 activate.  Johnny had heard that some of the ultra-secure networks             
 used defense systems that erased yet another line between biology and          
 technology.  Their security resembled the immune system.  Special              
 drones would check how you were organized.  If you didn't have the             
 right antigens, then antibodies would be produced to neutralize you.           
 Flatline EKG.                                                                  
                                                                                
      Johnny arrived in what was the electronic equivalent of Downtown.         
 Huge glowing signs beckoned to the Net travelers.  Their barker                
 programs endlessly repeated the same spiel: "You won't find a better           
 sensory stimulus simulation anywhere else!  Anything you want to do,           
 anyone you want to be!  For only a minor charge, you too...."                  
                                                                                
      He passed them by, like he always did.  They were traps, he'd             
 decided long ago.  They'd suck you in and fleece you for all your              
 credit before you could blink.  He switched at the next nexus and              
 arrived at his destination: Chuqui's.                                          
                                                                                
      Nobody seemed to know if Chuqui was real or an AI.  He was always         
 there, 24 hours a day, but no AI had yet passed the Petersen test.             
                                                                                
      The decor was different every night.  Chuqui's looked like what           
 Chuqui wanted it to look like.  Tonight it looked like Chuqui was in a         
 nostalgic mood.  It was a combination bar and restaurant, the kind             
 that you found in the late Eighties or early Nineties.  Period music           
 filled the air.  The smell of fine wood grain and sizzling meat filled         
 the air.                                                                       
                                                                                
      "Hey Johnny, how are you?" asked Chuqui.  He always recognized            
 everyone.  Johnny wasn't quite sure how he did it.  After hearing              
 about Chuqui's unusual talent, Johnny had tried using different                
 personas to fool Chuqui: he'd even come in as a woman once.  Chuqui            
 always saw through it.  So he just gave up trying.                             
                                                                                
      "Fine, Chuqui, just fine," he replied.  "Any action going on              
 here?"                                                                         
                                                                                
      "No, not really.  The usual?" Johnny nodded in reply.                     
                                                                                
      He walked past the bar that lined one side of the room, mementoes         
 of past dreams hanging on the wall above it, into a section of                 
 restaurant stools lining two walls.  You could watch the people across         
 the aisle watching you in the mirrors.  Beyond that, a multi-layered           
 area with both booths and tables.                                              
                                                                                
      Johnny found himself a table and drank in the atmosphere.  Chuqui         
 brought him his dinner.  He smelled real steak, not the yeast he               
 usually ate.  And his drink was a golden-colored beer in a frosted             
 mug.                                                                           
                                                                                
      He looked up from his plate and discovered that someone was               
 watching him from a booth near one corner.  Johnny was sure that the           
 booth had been empty when he'd come in.  And he hadn't seen anyone sit         
 down there.  No matter, he thought, there were plenty of back doors            
 into Chuqui's and some people preferred not to walk in.                        
                                                                                
      She was beautiful.  Her brown eyes had small epicanthic folds,            
 with long lashes.  Her hair was long and raven, bangs spilling forward         
 over her face.  Her skin was perfectly smooth and tanned and her teeth         
 were a sparkling white, set in a smile between scarlet lips.  She was          
 dressed in a shiny velvet-black dress, which was cut low enough to             
 reveal the swell of perfectly formed breasts.  She smiled and winked           
 at him.                                                                        
                                                                                
      Johnny walked over to the booth and sat down across from her.  He         
 caught a whiff of something indescribable which jolted his pleasure            
 center like an electric current.  He had never smelled anything like           
 it before.  But it was recognizable all the same.  It was the                  
 indescribable scent of woman.                                                  
                                                                                
      "Hello", he said.  He'd learned long ago that snappy pick-up              
 lines often didn't.                                                            
                                                                                
      "Hello yourself", she replied.  Her voice was low and husky.  A           
 corner of her lips twisted upwards in a small smile.                           
                                                                                
      "What do you think of Chuqui's tonight?" It never hurt to talk            
 about the place they were at.                                                  
                                                                                
      "This is the first time I've seen it like this.  Do you come here         
 often?"                                                                        
                                                                                
      "Yes, it's one of my favorite places.  He always seems to come up         
 with the most interesting decors."                                             
                                                                                
      "You call Chuqui a 'he'.  Rumor has it that Chuqui is an AI.  Do          
 you know what I think?" The last was in a playful voice.                       
                                                                                
      "No, what do you think", in the same playful tone.                        
                                                                                
      "I think it's a computer with a human brain connected to it.  An          
 experiment in permanent man-machine symbiosis.  A rather powerful              
 tool, the computer's speed with a human's intuition.  What do you              
 think?"                                                                        
                                                                                
      "That's an interesting theory.  But what about sleep?  A man              
 can't stay awake forever, and some people I know have stayed with              
 Chuqui for ten days straight.  If he was human, he'd have gone crazy."         
                                                                                
      "Well, I'd be willing to bet that they didn't keep him constantly         
 occupied.  That'd be how he could get sleep.  A "Russian Sleep"                
 inducer implanted in the brain.  Instant deep sleep for seconds or             
 minutes at a time.  Granted, Russian Sleep isn't REM sleep, but the            
 computer could take over for an hour or two to cover for him."                 
                                                                                
      It wasn't until some time later that Johnny noticed that he               
 wasn't intimidated by her intelligence.  Her theory was interesting,           
 and she seemed to have thought it out completely.  He was totally at           
 ease with her.  And those beautiful eyes continued to look at him, and         
 that mouth still framed that smile.                                            
                                                                                
      Chuqui brought a bottle of champagne in an ice bucket that Johnny         
 didn't remember ordering.  He expertly cracked it open and together            
 they shared the bubbly sweetness.                                              
                                                                                
      After finishing the bottle, he asked the inevitable question,             
 knowing she'd say yes.                                                         
                                                                                
      They left Chuqui's and went over to a nearby love hotel.  For a           
 fee, two or more people could rent a room by the hour or for the               
 night.  The room was tastefully done, and looked much like an                  
 expensive hotel suite.                                                         
                                                                                
      They kissed, his tongue and hers nuzzling, his pleasure center            
 being jolted repeatedly.  Then she stepped back and shrugged out of            
 her dress.  Johnny was not surprised to find that besides the dress            
 and her shoes, she wore nothing else.  He caressed her silky skin              
 while she undressed him.  Then she gently pushed him onto the bed and          
 she straddled on top of him.                                                   
                                                                                
      They moved together as men and women had done for thousands of            
 years.  As they got closer and closer to the explosion, she seemed to          
 blaze like an aurora borealis.                                                 
                                                                                
      He fell asleep with her head on his chest, his arm laid across            
 her smooth back.                                                               
                                                                                
      Johnny woke up back in his seat, his chin on his chest, his neck          
 painfully stretched.  He jacked out and switched off the deck.                 
                                                                                
      After stretching the kinks out of his neck, he took a shower, two         
 one-minute blasts of tepid water.  It felt oily and only slightly              
 brown.  Putting on the same shirt and tie as yesterday, he                     
 hop-scotched his way back to the door and left.  Time for another              
 lousy day at work.  After another night on the Net.

  The Magazine of the Dargon Project         Editor:  Dafydd <White@DUVM>       
                                                                                
     DargonZine is an electronic  magazine printing stories written for         
 the Dargon Project, a shared-world  anthology similar to (and inspired         
 by)  Robert  Asprin's Thieves'  World  anthologies,  created by  David         
 "Orny" Liscomb in his now retired magazine, FSFNet. The Dargon Project         
 centers around a medieval-style duchy called Dargon in the far reaches         
 of the  Kingdom of  Baranur on  the world named  Makdiar, and  as such         
 contains stories with a fantasy fiction/sword and sorcery flavor.              
      DargonZine  is  (at  this  time)  only  available  in  flat-file,         
 text-only format. For  a subscription, please send a  request via MAIL
