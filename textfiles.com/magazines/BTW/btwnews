                               BTW Group News:

        We continue to grow.  I would like to commend both Phantasm and The
Maxx for their fine work during my absence.  We are proud to welcome The Cell  
Block as our Central USHQ.  BTW may be undergoing a name change in the near
future, as we try to come up with another name for the group.  If so, the
magazine name may change as well.  Don't worry, the DIZ's will state "(Formally
BEER)".  Well, look out for our releases and PHuCK Da LaMeRZ!!!
