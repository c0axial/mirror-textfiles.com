                           A Message From sUMsDos:

        This is the premiere issue of our new E-Mag, BEER.  BEER is the
official magazine of BTW.  First and foremost, we would to apologize for the
fact that this issue is two weeks late.  This was due to problems with the
magazine's contributors (someone promised to submit an article, but didn't.)
        Moving on, all submissions by BTW members are virtually guaranteed to 
be published.  Non-members are also invited to submit, but their work will be 
less likely to be published.  We will accept submissions of any nature.  
Profanity and/or mature content is allowed. 
        Oh, and one more thing: DON'T RIP THIS E-MAG OFF.  I deliberately did
not distribute the magazine editing file for a reason.  Yes, it is easy to play
with the config and give your group a nice E-Mag of its own.  But don't.
        Thank you for wasting your D/L points on us, enjoy this magazine, and
PHuCK Da LaMeRZ!!!
