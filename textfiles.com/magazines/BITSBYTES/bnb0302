BOOM TIMES IN CYBERSPACE   (Jay Machado)

We open this edition of Bits and Bytes with some excerpts from Win
Treese's Internet Index #5. Inspired by "Harper's Index"*, the
statistics show that in 1994 the net continued its' amazing growth, 
albeit at a slightly slower pace than in 1993. Gopher traffic, for 
instance, merely quadrupled in 1994. An abundance of interesting 
sociological phenomena will no doubt occur as a 25-year old Internet 
struggles to integrate the latest wave of immigrants to cyberspace, 
most of whom are blissfully unaware of the net's longstanding 
traditions and social mores. These culture clashes already show signs 
of intensifying as the virtual battle lines are drawn between a 
longstanding net culture based on the free flow of information and 
the growing hordes of net entrepreneurs, who are working on various 
methods of extracting a profit out of the information $uperhighway.
Other clashes will occur as the freewheeling, decentralized tendencies
of the net meet Mr. and Mrs. America, who'd like to keep things clean
and wholesome for the kiddies. Already one company is offering net 
feeds with all the nasty parts excised. I was bitten when I posted the
Microsoft/Catholic church PARODY at work and raised the ire of a few
rabid Catholics. It didn't even occur to me that it would offend, as
used as I am to seeing far worse in my wanderings through the net.

These are exactly the kind of issues B&B is interested in exploring in
future editions, located as they are at the intersection of technology
and culture.
                                   
Growth of Gopher traffic in 1993:  1076%
Growth of Gopher traffic in 1994:   197%

Growth of WWW traffic in 1993:  443,931%
Growth of WWW traffic in 1994:    1,713%

Number of countries on the Internet in 1993: 60
Number of countries on the Internet in 1994: 81

Number of attendees at Internet World, January, 1992:     272
Number of attendees at Internet World, December, 1994: 10,000 +

Percentage increase in weight of the 2nd edition 
of the Canadian Internet Handbook:  280

Number of Internet messages causing Microsoft to issue a 
press release denying them: 1

TEN WAYS TO RULE THE WORLD THROUGH CYBERSPACE  (Keith Bostic)

 1. Killer Client
    Create an amazing monolithic web client. Get everyone hooked
    and then augment the standard until you've locked out your
    competition.

 2. Killer Standards
    The HTTP standards are way too simple now!  Any creative little
    company can get in on the action. Start making those standards
    FANTASTICALLY complex so just a few big companies can play. An
    MIT consortium could accomplish this without even meaning to.

 3. Killer Fonts
    Start a trendy magazine with hard-to-read fonts. Take smart drugs.
    Plan an on-line service of your own while labeling all potential
    competitors "obsolete" or "tired".

 4. Killer Shopping Mall
    Start an on-line service for people to buy things. Keep an eye on
    people's email to make sure everyone is shopping and NOT
    complaining to each other about crummy products.

 5. Killer Content
    If you happen to own the rights to serious amounts of popular Mass
    Culture (violent action movies, cute cartoon icons, etc), try to
    leverage that into deals with technology companies.

 6. Killer Set-Top Box
    If you happen to own a telephone or TV cable company, just design
    a set-top box so you can pump mindless drivel into people's homes.
    Home Shopping and Top-10 Movies On Demand would make you LOTS of
    money. Give the consumer enough upstream bandwidth so they can
    press the "buy" button on their remote, but not enough to actually
    get on-line and (god forbid!) communicate with each other.

 7. Killer Language
    Invent a little language and call it a "scripting" language or a
    "mark-up" language, so people will overlook the fact that its'
    syntax sucks or it has dynamic scoping. Try to insinuate it into
    the HTTP or MIME standards.

 8. Killer Buzzword
    Pick some industrial graphics standard and rename it as something
    sexy like "Cyber Space Modeling Language". Hope no one notices
    that CAD graphics modeling languages have little or nothing to do
    with interactive presence.

 9. Killer Magna Carta
    If you happen to be a collection of powerful communications
    corporations who are afraid the national net will be opened up as
    a common carrier, issue a manifesto in Wired Magazine ranting
    about how the government should stay out of Cyberspace. Talk about
    freedom and progress and hope no one notices that you just want to
    pump Home Shopping and Video Games into the home.

10. Killer Government
    If you happen to be the US government, then you ALREADY rule the
    world!  Just make sure you can eavesdrop on cyberspace and crush
    anything that looks like it's getting too big.

(NOT SO) STUPID EMAIL TRICKS: ACCESSING THE INTERNET BY EMAIL

Let kindly Doctor Bob be your guide to accessing the wonders of the
Internet via email. Bits and Bytes just recently came across the latest 
edition of this wonderful FREE guide. We'll let Dr. Bob himself take 
it from here:

"If your only access to the Internet is via e-mail, you don't have to
miss out on all the fun! Maybe you've heard of FTP, Gopher, Archie,
Veronica, Finger, Whois, WAIS, World-Wide Web, and Usenet but thought
they were out of your reach because your online service does not
provide those tools. Not so! And even if you do have full Internet
access, using e-mail servers can save you time and money."

"This special report will show you how to retrieve files from FTP
sites, explore the Internet via Gopher, search for information with
Archie, Veronica, or WAIS, tap into the World-Wide Web, and even
access Usenet newsgroups using E-MAIL AS YOUR ONLY TOOL."

"If you can send a note to an Internet address, you're in the game!
This is great news for users of online services where there is partial
or no direct Internet access."

Yes, Indeed. The guide contains detailed instructions for performing
these amazing feats. So if you are currently limited to email-only
access to the net, I would urge you to do two things: 1) Pick up
Doctor Bob's Guide to Accessing The Internet By E-Mail. Instructions
for getting it are listed below. You will be amazed at just how much
you can do. 2) Think about upgrading your service. SLIP/PPP hookups,
which give you access to the full range of Internet services like FTP
and World Wide Web can often be had for $20-30 bucks a month. Look
beyond AOL/Prodigy/Compuserve/Delphi/Genie and patronize a local
access provider. The net is rapidly becoming commercialized -- Master-
Card International and Netscape Communications have just announced 
that they are developing a secure interface for on-line transactions
on the net. Let's not let things get too centralized too fast. 
Remember how it was when there was only one phone company? The net's 
great strength is in the diversity of people and resources on it. It's 
not as difficult to navigate as you might suppose, and besides, 
finding your way around can be part of the adventure.

But I digress... here's how to get the latest version of the guide:
This document is now available from several automated mail servers.

STEPPING BACK FROM DIVISIVENESS  (Teresa Heinz)

Today, we seem to dread politics as a ghoulish thing. We have come to
envision Washington as a cave of horrors where zombie-like politicians,
mummified by the insular Washington air and chained to demonic special
interests, clank their insidious way down Pennsylvania Avenue,
perpetually sinking their teeth into our wallets and draining from our
veins the lifeblood of democracy.

Even politicians and would-be politicians describe each other as
nothing short of a monstrous criminal class.

Little wonder that fewer than a third of the American people trust
government to do what's right even a majority of the time. ...

But we must call on our politicians, on our leaders of all kinds,
to step back from the divisiveness, to forgo the opportunism, to stop
trying to profit from our anxiety and our differences.

As a country, we must focus anew on our similarities, on the shared
hopes and dreams that made us what we are.

The road back to hope, to a new sense of place is not through the
hateful swamp where the ideologues dwell; it is through the common
spaces of our dreams.

Philadelphia Inquirer)

THE EMPIRE OF THE USELESS II   (Critical Art Ensemble)

"Progress in the 20th century has primarily consisted of bourgeois 
culture looking for a new master. In the time of bourgeois revolution, 
the aristocracy was destroyed, as was the church with its spiritual 
hierarchies, but the primordial desire to serve the useless has never 
been affected. The 'primitive' ritual of offering goods to an angry 
or potentially angry God in order to appease it into a state of 
neutrality continues to replay itself in complex capitalist economy. 
All things must be subordinated to neutrality - to uselessness. One 
major difference between the age of the virtual and more primitive 
times is that the contemporary idols have no metaphysical referent. 
The ones that have been constructed are not the mediating points 
between person and spirit, or life and afterlife; rather, they are 
end-points, empty signs. To this paper master, sacrifice has no 
limit. The stairs of the temple flow with blood every day. How 
fitting for progress to come to this end in the empire of the
useless."

[The Critical Art Ensemble(CAE) is a collective of six artists of
different specializations committed to the production of a new genre 
art that explores the intersections among critical theory, art, and
technology.]

Computer Related Risks - by Peter G. Neumann [ACM Press/Addison-Wesley
1995. ISBN 0-201-55805-X. 368 pp. $24.50]
-
Digital Woes (Why We Should Not Depend on Software) - by Lauren Ruth
Weiner [Addison-Wesley, 1994. ISBN 0-201-40796-5. 252 pp. $14]

Every day, modern society becomes more and more dependant on computers
to get us through our day. There are tiny microprocessors embedded in
our toasters and microwave ovens, and the jets flying overhead are
dependant on computer guidance to arrive safely at their destinations.
Many of us eschew traditional forms of currency for the ease of use
and accountability of digital cash in the form of credit/debit bank
cards and other electronic payment schemes. Indeed, it would be hard
for anyone to get through a day without some form of interaction with
digital technology. Most of us don't give this fact a second thought; 
we don't stop and think about what would happen if there was a 
breakdown in the system.

Peter G. Neumann is the moderator of one of the most fascinating (and
popular) online newsgroups, the Forum on Risks to the Public in the
Use of Computers and Related Systems, commonly referred to as the
RISKS Forum (see the ACCESS section). The various ongoing threads in
the RISKS forum have been skilfully classified and clarified in the
book _Computer Related Risks_. This is one heckuva book. I couldn't
put it down. I'm here to tell you, Stephen King's got nothing on this
book in terms of sheer terror! I was wide-eyed with disbelief when I
learned that during one 2-month period (April-May) in 1986 (the same
year of the Challenger disaster), NASA lost not one, not two, but
THREE separate satellites! All of them were destroyed in mid-air after
they were launched. NASA's problems are well-documented elsewhere, and 
fortunately there was no loss of life in any of these incidents, but 
we're not always going to be so lucky.

Neumann places problems into several major categories: reliability and
safety problems, security vulnerabilities, security and integrity
problems, and threats to privacy and well-being. Not all problems
discussed are life-threatening, some are merely annoying, like if
you've ever been refused service or had to do the bureaucratic
shuffle because "that's not what the computer says". Other topics
covered include financial fraud by computer, annoyances in life,
death and taxes, hackers and crackers, and a great chapter on spoofs
and pranks.

More importantly, the book analyzes the underlying causes of
breakdowns in the system and offers various frameworks for analyzing
such problems and minimizing the chances of their occurring again.
Note that I said minimize, not eliminate the risk. As the book makes
clear, computer systems, however well designed, operate in the
physical world, and a variety of mishaps can befall them. Assuming the
system is well-designed (not always a safe assumption), any number of
things can go wrong, from human error, mechanical failure, and natural
catastrophe to such imponderables as the dreaded NASDAQ squirrel, who
chewed through some wires and brought the stock market to its' knees.

That we do relatively little thinking about such matters says much
about humanity, about our technological myopia, and about our
continuing inability to look down the road at the consequences of our
actions. That's how we get nuclear power plants built near earthquake
fault lines and other blatantly boneheaded "solutions" to the problems
of modern life. _Computer Related Risks_ is written to be accessible
by a wide range of people, and should be read by sytems designers,
software engineers, savvy managerial types, and interested laymen who
would like to make informed decisions about the technologies they 
choose to employ in their lives. 
---
In a similar vein, Lauren Ruth Weiner's _Digital Woes_ focuses on the
software component of the technological equation. It's no surprise to
those of us who write programs for a living that software is
inherently unreliable, written, designed and maintained as it is by
human beings. The Pentium error making headlines nowadays is a case
in point: it was a result of simple human error -- in this case a few
transposed numbers incorrectly entered into a hardcoded table on the chip.
Computer code is tricky stuff -- something as small as a misplaced
period can change the flow of your program and lead to unforeseen 
results. Writing code is still more of an art than a science. Although 
progress in this area is being made, and general principles of good 
coding practice have been identified, these principles are not always 
followed to the letter. Coding "on the fly", in response to day to day 
processing requirements, with no regard for future maintainability or 
overall program design, is not all that unusual in many IS shops.

In the shop where I work, the design process involves countless
meetings, committees and cross-functional working groups working in
politically-charged environments, often at cross purposes with common
sense, to produce preliminary designs that are in any case not always
followed as rigorously as they could be. (Hi, guys!) Even when the
design is good, subtle assumptions in the resulting software can
become errors years down the road, when technologies change, as they
are wont to do, or processing requirements change. This can bring out
undiscovered bugs (sometimes called undocumented features) in a
program. Stuff happens.

Ms. Weiner's book is a higly readable introduction to the problems,
both technological and sociological, inherent in software design. It 
contains lots of anecdotes that will enlighten even as they bring a 
chuckle of recognition to many a programmer or project manager. When 
you finish reading Digital Woes, you'll have a greater appreciation 
for the amount of effort that's involved in designing and constructing 
good software. Given how much can go wrong, you will marvel at how
much good software there is to be had out there. Interested laymen
will find the book an entertaining overview, and those wishing to
delve deeper will discover a wealth of resources in the book's
extensive footnotes and bibliography.

human being has been reported to have learned dolphinese."  Carl Sagan

THE OPENING QUOTE came from Technology Review, April, 1992.

BITS AND BYTES GUARANTEE. I will never again announce the theme of an
issue in advance. The B&B Faves issue is still under construction, 
much like the oft-requested Information Superhighway SuperExtravaganza 
Issue, which will see the light of day in 1995. We will serve no whine 
before its time.

HEY SYSOPS! If you are archiving B&B on your BBS, please drop me a
note. I'd like to mention your BBS in B&B.

LETTERS. How's my driving? We welcome submissions and commentary. All 
mail sent to the editor or to B&B will be treated as a "letter to the 
editor" and considered printable, unless you tell me otherwise.
