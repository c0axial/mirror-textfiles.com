National Information Infrastructure Agenda For Action Released

On September 15, The Clinton administration's Information
Infrastructure Task Force (see B&Bv1#5) released a document titled
"The National Information Infrastructure: Agenda for Action." Though
its scope is broad, encompassing a variety of emerging technologies
employed in all aspects of our daily life, the NII Agenda is a brief
document. Unlike the National Performance Review (180 pages), also
released last week, the NII is only 30 pages. This may mean that it's
short on details. However, a variety of sources who (unlike me) have
actually read it say it is carefully thought out, with a good
understanding of the issues involved. There are still many issues to
address and details to work out. Feedback from the community that
stands to gain or lose the most - and let's face it, that's us - is
needed. To this end, the document is being made available from a
variety of online sources (see listing below), and is required reading
for anyone interested in or involved with computers, communications
(regardless of content or media), or the US government. Did I leave
anyone out?

(From the Executive Summary)
All Americans have a stake in the construction of an advanced National
Information Infrastructure (NII), a seamless web of communications
networks, computers, databases, and consumer electronics that will put
vast amounts of information at users' fingertips. Development of the
NII can help unleash an information revolution that will change
forever the way people live, work, and interact with each other.

ALAWON, a publication of the American Library Association's Washington
office, reports that Major strengths in the proposal include:
              
* Recognition of the potential:  "Development of the NII can help
  unleash an information revolution that will change forever the way
  people live, work, and interact with each other."

* Extension of universal service: "Because information means
  empowerment--and employment--the government has a duty to ensure
  that all American have access to the resources and job creation
  potential of the Information Age."

* Enhanced access to government information:  "The Administration will
  seek to ensure that Federal agencies, in concert with state and
  local governments, use the NII to expand the information available
  to the public, ensuring that the immense reservoir of government
  information is available to the public easily and equitably."

* Library and school use of NII: Application areas and pilot projects
  the Administration supports include government stimulus for
  connectivity and applications in health care, education, libraries,
  and provision of government information.

* Process:  An Advisory Council on the National Information
  Infrastructure will include representatives of industry, labor,
  academia, public interest groups, and state and local governments.
  "The Administration will make a special effort to hear from public
  interest groups" in its efforts to develop a new concept of
  universal service.

Then ALAWON went on to raise it's doubts, which I guess will pretty 
much be the agenda of everyone with a vested interest in the NII. 
Though this is a working document and not an end product, the stakes 
are very high indeed, as we begin to grope our way into the 
information economy. I personally urge you to get a copy of this 
document and see what you think for yourself. More on this next issue.

Just Say Know

"Learning is not a task or a problem - it is a way to be in the world.
 Man learns as he pursues goals and projects that have meaning for
 him."  - Sydney Jourard

When it comes to acquiring new skills, many people just can't shake
the notion that learning requires outside help. Consultants now say
the best route to moving up the IS ladder is self-directed education.
Stewart Stokes, senior VP at QED Information Sciences Inc. in
Wellesly, Mass., has developed a nine-step plan for self-directed
learning. (It might help if you write down the results of this
process in a notebook for future use.)

1) Identify the goals of your organization.
2) Consider those goals within the context of your industry.
3) Determine your personal career objectives: Ask yourself where you
   would like to be in two or three years.
4) Determine the skills you'll need to get there.
5) Now assess your own competency level. This is a time for being
   honest with yourself as to your strengths and weaknesses, but don't
   sell yourself short either. Perhaps a trusted friend or advisor
   could look at your list to see if you are being objective.
6) Step 5 should expose the gaps between your current skills and those
   you'll need to meet your career objectives.
7) Set learning objectives to help close that gap.
8) Locate formal and informal learning resources: Magazines are a good
   source of current information on your chosen subject - there are
   magazines for every subject under the sun. If you want to learn C,
   buy a C compiler and a how-to book and spend an hour a night on it.
   The library is a great place to start, and a knowledgeable
   librarian is an invaluable resource. Take a night course at
   college, even if it isn't for credit. Get on one of the online
   services - many have discussion groups dedicated to computer-
   related topics where you can ask questions and share knowledge.
9) Finally, as your knowledge increases, continue to identify your
   newly modified learning needs. Remember that learning is a lifelong
   process if you do it right. In addition to advancing your career,
   you'll enrich your life, increase your self-confidence and make
   you a generally better person. Try NEW and IMPROVED learning today.

"IS professionals must remember first and foremost that they bear
primary responsibility for their own career development," says Stokes.
This is difficult for many people to accept, he adds, "yet it may be
the best advice they'll ever receive." (SOURCE: "Help Yourself To
Knowledge," Information Week 7/19/93, p. 58)

Good Sources of Information

With regards to learning a new and/or hot technology, here are six
simple things you can do to find the best source of training for the
technology you want to learn:

1) Contact the product vendor. It often has the most complete
   knowledge of training options for its products.
2) Talk to anyone who knows what you want to learn. Experts are often
   generous with their knowledge. Ask how they got their own training
   and what's required.
3) Call your local chamber of commerce. Members may give computer
   training as part of community service projects or run local
   seminars.
4) Invest in books and magazines. If you know the basics, your
   training will be more effective. Don't forget the library!
5) Join user groups. Even if the group isn't exactly focused on the
   technology you want to learn, chances are someone there shares your
   interest.
6) Visit local training vendors. "Shop around for prices and
   availability," suggests Michelle McLean, manager of professional
   computing services at Casco Northern Bank in Portland, Maine. Do
   anything that will give you bands on experience.

Sometimes companies will provide access to education or help you foot
the bill, but don't count on it. Even at relatively enlightened
companies there is often a gap between philosophy and reality. "In the
end, determination is the best teacher," says Terry Tipple, a systems
engineer at Cabletron Systems, Inc. in San Jose, Calif. "Nobody will
look out for your career like you do, so you had better stay on top
of it." (source: Stephanie Wilkinson, "What Employers Won't Teach,"
Computerworld, July 5, 1993)

Management Take Note: No Train, No Gain

...companies that aren't moving to train their staffs in new skills
are playing Russian roulette, according to "Changing IS Organizations:
The Effect of Client-Server Implementation on Job Skills Requirement,"
a recently released study. ... Untrained users will spend three to six
times as many hours to reach the same level of functionality on a
given application as trained users, the study finds. In addition,
formal training and support costs about $1,350 per application while
an untrained user will eat up between $3,000 and $5,000 to reach a
skill level at, or below, a trained worker. Multiply this by the
number of users on a given application and the cost can be millions of
dollars. The study was jointly prepared by the Gartner Group Inc. and
an education task force of the Open Users Recommended Solutions (OURS)
user group. (John P. McPartlin, "No Train, No Gain," Information Week,
7/26/93, p. 14)

Learn While You Work

An article in Computerworld (8/30/93, p. 81) describes integrated
performance support systems (IPSS) as the most cost effective way for
training new employees, and providing them with the support and
information they need on the job. IPSS combine a variety of techniques
to apply knowledge when needed: Computer-based training, interactive
tutorials and possibly multimedia for training; context sensitive and
inquiry based help and reference systems for information; expert
systems for help with problems; bulletin boards for sharing
information; print manuals, instructor-led training, and meetings and
briefings to keep everyone informed of new developments. The basic
idea is not to reinvent the wheel with each new employee - to capture
vital job skills and essential information and pass them on to current
and future employees, making them available when they are needed by
the most appropriate means. A well thought out IPSS program can cut
training costs (in some cases by 65%) and increase productivity, while
not wasting employees time with rote memorization of information that
is likely to change over a given period anyway.

Bits and Bytes Bookshelf: Resources For Learning

The Lifetime Reading Plan  by Clifton Fadiman [Harper and Row, 1978.
$10.00]
- The books discussed may take you fifty years to finish. They can of
course be read in a much shorter time. The point is that they are
intended to occupy an important part of a whole life, no matter what
your present age may be. Many of them happen to be more entertaining
than the latest best-seller. Still, it is not on the entertainment
level that they are most profitably read. What they offer is of
larger dimensions. ... They can be a major experience, a source of
continuous internal growth. Hence the word Lifetime. These authors
are life companions. Once part of you, they work in and on and with
you until you die. They should not be read in a hurry, any more than
friends are made in a hurry." (Clifton Fadiman)

The Independent Scholar's Handbook  by Ronald Gross [Ten Speed Press,
1993. $11.95]
- "The author doesn't describe the ways to get accreditation, academic
legitimacy, or even intellectual power. He tells you how to find out
the things that would change your life if you took the trouble to
learn them, how to tell other people about them, and how to support
yourself meanwhile." (Art Kleiner, Co-Evolution Quarterly)

How To Solve It  by Gyorgy Polya [Princeton University Press, 1973.
$8.95]
- "This is the best book I know of for lining up a problem for a
logical solution. The emphasis is on math, but it is simple logic and
can easily be applied to all forms of problem identification and
analysis. Better yet is that the methods shown really work even on
personal decision-making binds."
(J. Baldwin, Essential Whole Earth Catalog)

An Introduction to General Systems Thinking  by Gerard M. Weinberg
[John Wiley and Sons, 1975. $75.00]
- An informal, entertaining and enlightening introduction to a complex
topic. Questions for further research and additional readings provided
at the end of each chapter provide jumping off points for further
study. Full of great quotes and illustrative examples.

Encyclopedia of Computer Science (3rd Edition)  Edited by Anthony
Ralston and Edwin D. Reilly [Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1993. $125.00]
- 1,664 pages, with detailed articles on all major computing systems,
environments, technologies and software. An invaluable reference book
for the computer professional.
