          Let's Despoil Britain!
          ----------------------
Ever wanted to wreak general havoc on some of
those boring old landmarks that litter Greater
Britian? Well, what better way to do it than with a
bath of Watney's and semi-digested bangers? Or how
about London Pride and Bloodpie? It's great eating
and senseless vandalism all about the Island as we
go Despoiling Britian!

Sponsored by the same assholes that came up with
that damn "Chunnel" idea. Nuke them and their
fucking tunnel, I say. Anything that allows huge
smelly masses of froggies to cross the Channel is
inherently wrong and should be stopped by any means
necessary. Thank you.


What if disco wasn't really dead?
What if the Pope was a hamster?
What if Jessie Helms had a brain?

Ever wonder about these possibilities?

Thud.

     Dear Sirs,

     The Thatcher Government feels magazines such as Teenage Masturbation
Weekly are most inappropriate unless accompanied by color photos of nude MP's.

                                      Royally,

                                      Prince Phillip

a dog? Or a horse? Or something that could come outta the water? It's not
like we could take him to Show-and-Tell or anything! DAMNIT FLIPPER! . . .

And now, Steve's Madness!!  (oh gawd..)

I'm not a loadie
I don't know why
Not 'cause I'm shy
But to comply
With the hungry urge
To slurge
And get eaten
or beaten or cretin
To the pipe with bowls
Packed not with Skoals
But the wonderful weed
Without the seed
Can you dig it
When you take a hit
And your Purple maze
Falls to a Haze
Of camping trips
Of sailing ships
Of Lochness land
of my old man
Of my old man?
I'd Better hide
My pipe

I drove to San Jose the other day and was surprised to find not me but my
neighbor sitting on the grass eating a fig. I asked him why. He said,
"Because of the wonderfully great Social Standing I achieve.  I can
become anything I want just by eating this here fig.  Why, my good man, I
can give you a thousand reasons why eating this fig here can help you get
taller, or have longer hair, or to wonder about bicycles.  Do bicycles in
fact have any grapefruits hanging from their spokes?  Well, one would have
to assume that bicycles with such extremeties would eventually condescend
the moral conduct that everyone well respects and deserves when we trip hard."
I was disconcerted, to say the least.

There will not be an article for Jews.

#54 An Article for Jews
    An Article for Jews

Hey there you bloody twit! Can't your read!? This isn't an article for Jews.

Dump-da-da-da-TA!

It's 

Bowling for REPO-MEN.

Announcer: "Yes folks, time now once again for Bowling for Repo-men.
Our three-day returning champion with total winnings of $4500, 2
repo-men and a button-nose, please welcome Mr. David Beatmymeat from
Pilsbury.  Welcome back David."

David: "Uh, yeah.  Hi.  My names David and I have a wife and three
kids who work in a button factory."

Announcer: "Our challenger today on Bowling for Repo-men is a young
securities clerk from Boston.  He is currently not employed and is
spending time doing research in the Pacific Ocean studying the
reproductive activity of dust-mites, welcome Bob Grabmedong from Sussex."

Bob: "I gave at the office."

Announcer: "Are the two contestants ready?"

David: (affirmative nod)

Bob: (raises hand)

Announcer: (a little annoyed) "uh....Yes, Bob?"

Bob: "Are we going to have to raise our hand every time we have a question?"

Announcer: ". . . . . . . I don't think thats going to be necessary Bob.
Since both of you seem ready, let's start _Round One_ of Bowling for
Repo-men!"

(mild applause from audience)

(Bob and Dave take their positions in their lanes on the bowling alley.)

Announcer: "Our first question is to you, David since you are our returning
champion.  David, for $30 and a chance at bowling, who once ate three
crates of spam after smoking 5 bowls of marijuana, and threw up into a vat
of living whale sperm leaving Jane Fonda to clean up the mess?

David: "Uh, was it, ..uh... oh, uh, was it"

(audience claps)

Announcer: "Thats exactly right, David!  You earn $30 and get to make your
first `bowl' of the evening."

(David grasps bowling ball and prepares to bowl)

Announcer: "Now, David, if you can hit that repo man sitting on his
crotch over there by the Space Invaders machine, you get to keep him."

David: "Yeah! . . ."

(David appears serious as he bowls the ball across the aisle into the
games section and pegs a big black dude with a .45 hanging off his belt)

(audience gasps in horror)

Announcer: "ooooOOOooooo David.. thats not good. You forgot our
original (possibly) useful advice that bowlers should NEVER bowl for
repo men that carry (possibly) harmful projectile weapons. Now David,
you must dodge the repo-man's bullets or lose the $30 and the rest of
your life. Good luck!"

(announcer takes out a small kazoo from his shirt pocket and hums into it)

David: "Holy SHIT!"

(big black dude starts chasin David all over the alley screamin' and
shootin' and a scuffing up the bowling alley. Now we all know that
the management don' like them boys to be a roughin' it and a toughin'
it and generally scuffin' up the bowlin' alley, so we had the big
black dude suspended.)

Announcer: "And now a word from your sponsor."

'Toilet paper is fun to wrap yourself in,' and other great tunes can now be
heard on this all expense paid vacation trip to Maui for RENTING OUR CAR.
Yes, rent our car now and you will be eligible.  I mean, who wouldn't?
.. Who? .. Never heard of him.  You just can't pass up this tremendous offer.

(quiets down)

Good evening.  Tonight we present a series of films for culture lovers
entitled 'How to eat bologna without getting it in your hair,' Parts One
through Eleven, sponsored by Jim's Rubber Clothing. Part one commences
almost immediately.

(shuts up .. person eating sandwich appears on screen)

Wasn't that wonderful.  Part two commences almost soon enough, but first,
a word from these messages.

"Greetings folks. Today is National Diversity week. The day when you can go
outside and eat a frog and not feel guilty about it. The cost is only
$19.95 and you can even pay in stamps. So go on outside today, right now,
this instant, and eat a frog. Completely free, only partially immoral, and
wholly improper! So don't miss this once-in-a-weekend opportunity to eat a
frog, guilt-free, on National Diversity week. Try one, today! (gives big grin)
