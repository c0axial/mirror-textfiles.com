just so we'll leave 'em alone. YEAH! And after that, we'll call up the
public radio station and ask to hear Ozzy and Metallica! Right on! Shit,
it's gonna be hard to top that next Sunday. I hope them D.E.A. dudes
didn't get a trace. That'd be a bitch.

get so pissed that they call out this radio preacher to swear at us over
the airwaves. Ha ha haha haahahahahahahahahaaa!"
