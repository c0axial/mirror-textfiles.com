With your host, the very violent Mr. D.P. Gumby!

Good evening Fred! 

   Tonight I shall entertain you by explainin' Columbus' discovery of the
New World while 'ittin' meself in th' 'ead wif a brick!

Good evening Fred! 
 
   Columbus, wot was a dirty Portegee bastard, got sodden at the 'Get On Inn'
and stole three ships!

[POCK!] 

   THE GREAT SOT!

[SMACK!] [WHAP!] [CRACK!] [THUMP!] etc...

. . . And now on BBC 2 

     Do you live in Iseley?

     (old crone): "I do!"

     And do you like foreigners?

     "NO! Not a bit!"

     Perhaps YOU should join the Iseley 'I Hate Bloody Foreigners' Club.
Every week we go out and put the boot to dirty foreigners what spoil the
beauty that is forever England. You too can torment wops, eye-ties,
froggies and other assorted scum by setting their homes afire, letting
down their tyres and throwing dead dogs through their windows!

     "Oooh! That sounds like fun! How do I join?" 

     Just drop 50,000 quid in an envelope and send it to: 

     God I Hate Bloody Foreigners!

     London, England.

     It's BOGARTMAN!

(Two stoners in an alley)
 
"Hey bud, gotta joint?"
"Yeah, this is the last of that pound of killer scents my brother brought
back from Humbolt!"
"KILLER! Spark it, dude!"
 
(whips out a hefty ol' bomber and lights it) 
 
*WHOOOOOSH!*
 
(Dude in flaming red tights lands next to the duo)
 
"HEY! It's BOGARTMAN!"
"Oh nooo maaaaan. . ."

Bogartman: "Good citizen, let me sample that healthy spliff so that I may
determine if it's been contaminated by Paraquat!"

"Oh hey, they don't use that stuff any . . . HEY! Gimme that joint back, man!"

"Never fear, good citizen, I'll only take a small hit. . ."

TFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF-FF-FF-FF-FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF

"Oh hey man, you could have at least left us a ROACH!"

"Rest easy, Citizen, these ashes are wholly uncontaminated!"
 
"Oh thanks, man. . ."
 
"I must go now, Citizens.  My Brother-in-law just scored some 'shrooms.
I must pay him a visit!  All sortsa bad 'shrooms goin' around!"

(1 week later: same stoners, same alley)
 
"Hey man, that's a killer bong!"

"Yeah, too bad I don't have anything to smoke. . ."
 
"Dude, I gotta ball of some Turkish hash my Poli Sci teacher snuck outta
Istanbul! Two hits'll get you totally fucked up!"
 
"Pack it, dude!"
 
(packs this huge ball of hash into the tiny bowl) 
  
*WHOOOOOOOOSH!*

"Oh NO!"

"Citizens, it is I, Bogartman! Dirty bongs are a breeding ground for
harmful bacteria. Let me clean that for you!"

"No way man, you ain't gettin' this . . . HEY! Gimme that back!"

"The first thing I must do is burn off all this excess hash in your bowl!"

(One 15 minute long bong hit later. . .) 

"There you are, Citizen, a clean bowl!"

"You FUCKER! You just inhaled my entire hash ball!!"

"No need to thank me, Citizen.  It's all in a day's work for BOGARTMAN!"

(Same alley, same stoners: One week later) 

"Hey dude! Whazzup? Whaz in the bottle?"

"It's 450,000 mics of liquid LSD, man. Cost me 7 paychecks, but I'm gonna
get even with that damn Bogartman . . . Oh LOOK! I have this HUGE BOTTLE
of VODKA! Too bad BOGARTMAN isn't here to share it! I wonder where
BOGARTMAN is?! It would be a shame to let all this VODKA go to WASTE!! Oh
where ever could BOGARTMAN be?!?! (Where the hell is he?) OH . . ."

"Hey dude, it's the COPS!"

"Whaddaya got in the bottle, buddy?"

"Uh, it's, uh, BOTTLED WATER! YEAH! bottled water . . . uh-huh. . ."
 
"Well it looks like vodka to me and drinking on public streets is illegal. . ."
 
(cop grabs bottle and smashes it on the street)
 
". . . but I'll let ya off with a warning this time! HAHAHAHAHA!"
 
*WHOOOOOSH!*

Cop: "Who the hell are you?!"
 
"Stout law enforcement officer, I am Bogartman! And this man licking the
pavement here is my friend!  Just last week he let me smoke some of his
killer hash. . ."
 
(breaking out handcuffs): "Zat so?"

". . . and the week before he let me smoke his last joint!"

Cop: "Thank you, good citizen. . ." (slaps cuffs on hippies)

Bogartman: "No need to thank me! It's all in a day's work for BOGARTMAN!"
