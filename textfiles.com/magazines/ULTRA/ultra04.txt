How to Make a Time Bomb, Easily by Agent Cyclone 
------------------------------------------------ 
I. Why a time Bomb? 
 
The answer to this quetion is quite simple. First, the safety factor. Obviously, 
one would be much safer settting a time bomb and having a set amount of time to 
make a break. If you have a regular bomb, you only have enough time as the 
length of the wick will allow. This is rarely, if ever, practical. 
 
Second, you have time to make a clean get away. With the method below, you will 
have a maximum of 12 hours. That should be a sufficient amount of time to get 
out of nearly anywhere. Plus, when you light a regular bomb, your face is fresh 
in the memory of anyone who may have seen you. In essence, you could set your 
time bomb, and in 60 minutes, be a good 70 miles away from the scene. 
 
Finally, it offers you too much flexibility. Just think, you could set it up for 
someone who always gets home at a certain time. For a bus or train, that will be 
arriving somewhere. It is too easy to think of situations. This method beats the 
hell out of lame geeks who light up a homemade bomb (that often goes wrong) and 
throws it in someones window. 
 
II. Placement 
 
As I mentioned earlier, this is simple. While anyone can do it, it does have 
a major drawback. The ticking sound. What does this mean? It means that you 
will have to place it in an area that is somewhat noisy, at least enough to 
muffle the sound. That still leaves you a broad range of places. 
 
Where should you stick it? First think of a place to conceal it, under a bench, 
in the wheel well of a car, inside someones screen door, anywhere you can hide 
it. Now where could you actually plant the bomb? Depends on what you want to do. 
Destroy property, or kill people, or just wreak general TERROR. Here are some 
places that might give you some ideas: 
 
Hotels Shopping Centers School Lockers Private Homes Bus, and Train Stations 
Telephone Circuit Boxes Utiltity Poles, and Transformers Yourself (Suicide) 
 
III. Ingredients 
 
Ingredients  
1 old cheap clock, not digital 
Glue 
Lengths of Wire 
9-Volt battery with press studs at the end 
Explosives of Your Preference 
 
IV. Assembly 
 
First, pull either the minute hand, or the hour hand off the clock. Generally, 
it is best to pull the minute hand off because the hour hand is much stronger. 
Take a piece of bare wire. Glue wire to the hand so it extends beyond the face 
of the clock. Take a long bit of wire and run it from the center of the front of 
the clock and fasten the free end to the battery. Take another length from the 
battery to what you are going to activate. Then take another piece of wire from 
your object back to the clock. If you are facing the clock, have it jut out 
over the number 12. 
 
V. Set-up 
 
Set the hand where you want it, and just wait. The wire hand travels round 
toward the wire jutting out and eventually hits it at right angles. The 
circuit will now be complete from the clock, to the battery, to the object, 
and back to the clock. The clock hand will keep trying to tick around but the 
jutting wire keeps stopping it.  
 
VI. Conclusion 
 
Well I hope you learned something. Always remeber, KNOWLEDGE IS POWER. Look 
for Ultra in your area. If you cannot find it, call Blitzkrieg (502)499-8933.
