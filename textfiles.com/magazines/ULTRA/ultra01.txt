   Reasons for forming our own text file group were many. There seems to be a 
few groups already out there who are just rehashing old stuff, or just typing 
in chapters from some old dusty manual they found in a trashcan. Nothing that 
is shocking or original. We have formed ULTRA to break this chain and bring 
something new along. Our files will be different, outrageous, sick, evil, and 
just about everything else you could think of. Ultra will not have any set 
format or speciality. We will voice our own opinions and how we feel, they will 
not even reflect what the other group members personal opinions are. Hell we 
might even offend you. Ultra will not hold to any release date nor will we have 
any special hangout to call our headquarters. If you want our stuff bad enough 
you will find it. 
 
   Ultra plans on bringing you original text files on various subjects. We want 
to tell it like it really is. Ultra will have the law enforcement agencies 
faxing urgent bulletins across the states. We will bring you the most 
dangerous, the most fantastic, the most controversial, and some of the evilist 
stories you have ever laid eyes upon.
