     Having Fun At Target by Sinister X / Ultra      08-March-1991 
 
Basic Starters Information 
-------------------------- 
 
Dayton-Hudson Corp has opened a retail department store across the United 
States called Target. The stores range from Florida to the West Coast up to 
Minnesota. I decided to write this file for the thought of the chaos it would 
cause the employees of the stores if someone actually decided to try this stuff 
on an unsuspecting store one busy afternoon. 
 
As you go into the store one of the first things you will notice is a paging 
system being piped over the store through speakers in the ceiling. You will 
hear things like Hardware dial the operator, or maybe it will be a number like 
13 dial 209. First if you look around you will notice customer assistance 
phones on poles located throughout the store. Once you have located an out of 
the way phone you can begin your fun. The phone system at Target works on a 
small PBX system. You can do many things with it. There are phone extensions 
all over the store so employees can help a customer who is calling find an 
item. The phones are also used by customers to dial 234. After dialing 234 the 
phone rings for the in store operator to answer. She then asks the customer 
what they need help with and an employee comes to help. (Sometimes) Dialing 0 
will also get you the operator, but not on the same phone. 0 (zero) is used by 
employees who need someone paged etc. You may dial 9 from a phone in Target if 
it is Black and you will get an outside line. If the phone is Red it will not 
dial out. You can make calls to where you please off a black phone. 
 
Now for the fun stuff. To get on the intercom from ANY phone in the store 
simply pick up a phone and dial 41. This puts you on the loud speakers located 
all over the store. One of the most hated saying is "Attention ]<-]V[ART 
Shoppers there is a blue light special....." This will bring the whole store to 
alert and PISS off the Target workers since they hate K-mart. You can yell 
profanity or what ever crosses your mind. Be alert though because they will 
come looking for you as soon as you take hold of the system. You cannot get 
onto the intercom if someone already is on. Which means you will have to wait 
for the operator to shutup is she is on. 
 
Explaining the numbers and codes heard over the intercom. 
--------------------------------------------------------- 
 
All phones have extension numbers of 3 digits. All managers have 2 digit 
numbers to be identified by. I will list them for you.

11 - Merchandise Manager #2 
12 - Operations Manager #3 
13 - Assets Protection Manager (Gestapo Leader)

MOD - Manager On Duty  (Either 1,2,or 3)

Hardlines 2 - Sales floor people (electronic, toys, tools, cars)

These can often be heard called over the intercom to dial a certain number.

Target Security & Code 100 In Detail. 
------------------------------------- 
 
Target has plain clothes security who walk the floor looking for shoplifters. 
There are also camera systems but they are used to monitor employee theft more 
then customers. The security persons, are either male or female and almost 
always in pairs. Easy ways to spot them is to look for someone already watching 
another customer. They can often be seen looking around ends of aisles or 
between boxes trying to see a shoplifter conceal merchandise. They hang around 
the electronic department and the music sections, but are not limited to those 
parts. Sometimes they can be spotted by the clothes they are wearing. Say they 
came to work and it was sunny and warm. When you got there is was pouring rain. 
They will not have a rain coat on and will look stupid. Use common sense in 
figuring out who is security. They will watch you if you stay in the store to 
long, make loud noises and cut up with buddies, etc. 
 
The cameras are located in the following places. One is in the stock room above 
the electronics high ticket merchandise lockup. That is no concern to 
customers. One is over the electronics section and can see everything. Another 
is over the electronics counter and is used to watch the registers for employee 
theft or display merchandise theft this camera is only able to scan around the 
glass cases no furthur. Another is located in the mall entrance or near 
register #1. This is used to watch cashiers suspected of pocketing money. ALL 
CAHSIERS on registers 1-5 are being watched. There are no exception. They place 
them on cash only registers to tempt them even more into stealing and since 
they have them on camera, boom, instant busts. The last camera to worry about 
is located behind the service desk. It is used to film people taking back stuff 
that is stolen from another store or taken from the shelf and brought up to the 
desk trying to scam a return. 
 
The dreaded CODE 100 is used to get sales floor help in catching a shoplifter. 
Someone from security is either fighting or chasing a shoplifter and needs help 
one employee will be told to say code 100 over the intercom and state a 
location. Like code 100 to the front door. Meaning a shoplifter tried to run 
out the front door and is either fighting or getting away. Once a code 100 is 
called ALL MALE employees drop what they are doing and run to the location 
stated. This is where the common sales floor geek has a chance to get revenge 
after all the stupid customers they have put up with during the day. If someone 
is fighting they can jump in and help. This turns into a mob soon with a bunch 
of fired up red vest wearing geeks trying to beat the crap out of a shoplifter. 
If you are stealing someone by chance and hear code 100, you better give up or 
run for your life. I have seen many people fucked up trying to fight a mob of 
red vests. 
 
Well i hope you have learned a few things about how target operates and what 
massive chaos you can cause inside a store now that you know how it works. 
 
I will continue writing files for ULTRA and the will only get better since this 
is my first. I will more then likely have a few upcoming that will shock the 
hell out of you. 
 
I can be reached at the following boards for now. Since i only call 2.
