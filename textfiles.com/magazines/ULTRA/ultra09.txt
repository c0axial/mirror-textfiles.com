Supermarket Ideas 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Agent Cyclone 
 
I. Supermarket? 
 
     I know some of you are thinking, "What the hell is a supermarket good for?" 
  Yeah, well many people feel this way. These are the people who have never 
  learned how to use the big ol' general store to its fullest advantages. The 
  supermarket is one of the best places to shop for everything, if you know how 
  to shop right. With the supermarkets constantly increasing in size and 
  services, the opportunities never cease to expand. 
 
II. What to do? 
 
     As I mentioned earlier, there is too much you can do at one of these 
     places. Listed below are some ideas that you can have fun with. 
 
- First, and easiest, get a free meal. There are no supermarket police. If you 
  walk up and down the aisles, there is a huge selection of vittles. Take 
  whatever you like. When you are full, leave what you can't eat. No one will 
  ever say anything to you because they are afraid to and generally they are 
  too embarrassed. Just think, have all the seafood you like, or the stuff that 
  you can't afford. Of course, should anyone ever question you, just say you 
  are going to pay for it. I have been doing this for years and no one has 
  ever said a damned thing to me. 
 
- Second, there are a lot of milk crates left in the back near the loading docks 
  at night. These are great for storing things, and they are generally left 
  outside, FREE! Speaking of loading docks, this is the best place for you 
  underaged kids to steal all the beer you want. Wait until the big Bud truck 
  rolls in, it will generally sit there with its doors open. This is prime time 
  for thieving. There is no better buzz than getting drunk on stolen beer. 
 
- Third, your parents may send you to the grocery for mulch or any of those 
  garden products that sit outisde the store in big stacks. If you aren't too 
  nervous, just back your car up and take all you need. No one will ever 
  notice. If you are a little scared, than go in the store, buy one bag, and 
  go outside. Take the receipt, put it in your mouth so all can see it, and 
  take as much as you need. Hell, get a stock-boy to help you load it in the 
  car. 
 
III. Conclusion 
 
     While these aren't the wildest ideas you have ever heard, they are 
     practical. Why pay for a meal, when you can walk into the market and get 
     a free one. Why pay for mulch and shit, when you can pocket mom & dad's 
     money and get them their goods. Hope you put this crap to work in your 
     area...it is tooo easy.
