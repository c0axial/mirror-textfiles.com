  here we go with issue two of nyquil. in this issue we have recluse and
  pericles doing a very funny escapade in #chinese. i was very happy to
  see someone submit, and hope many more will follow. a little info on
  our policy, we release every three days, and are currently not taking
  sites or hq's of any kinds. however that does not mean that we will not
  be taking sites etc. in the near future. so sit back and enjoy nyquil 
  number two...

-- editors notes -- 

there has been a little rucus over the idea that i ripped the idea for irc
captures from a group call " k-lined ". i would like to make it clear to
k-lined and everyone else that i did not attempt to rip the idea. i hope we
can release in peace with each other.
