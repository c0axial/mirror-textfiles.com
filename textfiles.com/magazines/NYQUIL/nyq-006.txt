   ... here we go with nyquil number six. as you might have figured out
   reptile put together nyquil five all by himself, good job reptile.
   as mentioned in previous issues, sites have been handed out to several
   people. I do not remember all of the sites, so please remind me if you
   have one so i can compile a site list or something ... 

   ... in other news, i have been very pleased at the number of captures,
   ascii's, etc. there are just so many of them. many people who give me
   a submission keep asking me if their submission will be released. all
   i can say is to be patient. eventually yours will be put out, but there
   are no promises as to when. so keep the jokes and stuff up, remember
   that creativity counts ...

                       ---+ info on the presentor +---

   ... this issue is brought to you by shattered image. he does a very
   spectacular job of pretending to be a young gay boy who has a hot
   dog stuck in his butt ...

<b-man> Stuck, probably good to see a doctor. And get a dildo. It's much
        safer.
[Mal-ach!edelsohn@hamoa.mhpcc.edu] you should just be able to shit it out
                                   eventually -- it shouldn't do any damage
<Stuck> and i think it would be too embarrasing to goto the doctor :(
<b-man> Doctors see everything these days. they won't care.
<Stuck> i have taken exlax for the last week. and it doesnt help me...

           it up the center a ways and then pull it out..  would it work?
[*mal-ach*] i have tried.. when i try to shit.. it hurts.. and just wont come
            out
<Mal-ach> Are you saying that you haven't had a BM in a week?        
<b-man> drill bit? No, he could injure himself!

<Mal-ach> If the hot dog has created an impaction, get to a doctor
          immediately!
<Stuck> its the family doctor.. and she might tell my folks
<Wookster> stuck: is the hot dog real soft or hard?
<Stuck> and i dont like being naken in front of women either :(
<Stuck> i think its getting moldy

<b-man> Just tell the doctor! No big deal.

        with a vaccuum cleaner?)
*** elude (jrki@dana.ucc.nau.edu) has joined channel #gayboysex        
<Mal-ach> stuck: just tell the doctor that you stuck a hot dog up your ass
<elude> anyone into the prvt thing?
<Stuck> what if i drank some drayno?
<Mal-ach> stuck: they may try an enema to soften it and have it come out
          naturally
<DSE> prvt thing?
<Mal-ach> stuck: drano is just plain stupid        
[Vessago!jby2v@faraday.clas.Virginia.EDU] Did you really do that?  Don't 
   worry too much, since doctors encounter this all the time, at least 
   it's not a gerbal or something.        
[Vessago!jby2v@faraday.clas.Virginia.EDU] I know a person who works in an
  emergancy room, and she sees it lotsa times.  People just do that sort of
  thing.
[*vessago*] yes i did.. :(..

[Vessago!jby2v@faraday.clas.Virginia.EDU] Have you tried shitting?

[Vessago!jby2v@faraday.clas.Virginia.EDU] Luckily, I had an older friend who
  provided some advice to me on this subject.
[Vessago!jby2v@faraday.clas.Virginia.EDU] I'm really sorry... Hmm.. how long
               has it been up there?                     
[*vessago*] 4 days...
[Mal-ach!edelsohn@hamoa.mhpcc.edu] I would go an emergency room tonight 
[*mal-ach*] thanx.. i think i will do that tomorrow though...
[Vessago!jby2v@faraday.clas.Virginia.EDU] Look, you're just gonna have to go
  to a doctor, if not, things might get worse, and then you'll REALLY be in
  trouble.  I know it's easier said than done, but you have to.  Make an
  appointment with a stranger doctor, and go.  Please, do it!
[*vessago*] ok.. thatis what i will do.. i guess i have no other choice
[Mal-ach!edelsohn@hamoa.mhpcc.edu] it sounds more like it has rotated around
  and become stuck transversely in your colon

 I just don't want it to get infected or spread bacteria or something.  I'm
  only 17, but I'm certainly not stupid.
[*mal-ach*] ok thanx alot... i think i am gonna go now and make some calls
[Mal-ach!edelsohn@hamoa.mhpcc.edu] but this could puncture your colon and the
  impaction could cause other problems        
[b-man!barryy@seawolf.rs.itd.umich.edu] Good. OK to tell your doctor about
  this.                 
[*vessago*] ok.. i am going now :). thanx alot bud
