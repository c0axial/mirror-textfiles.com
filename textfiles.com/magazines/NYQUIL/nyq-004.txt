                     * nyquil issue number four *


    in this, the first duo issue of nyquil, we bring you two great
    performances. the first from mistawho, who pretends to be a KKK
 member in #black. the second from deathbringer who does a spectacular
   job of being a new irc user who is getting flashed. both captures
    were fairly small so i put them together for the first ever duo.

  the submissions have been coming in large numbers lately. there are 
    a few key things i would like to see in the submissions. i would
   like to see a creative plot, a lengthy log, and a fairly neat log.
   i am more than happy to go through and edit anything you give me.
   the editing is up to you though, but again, i am very willing to
   edit them. keep the submissions coming!

           you in the ASS.
<Sunspot> KKK: but you use one of the most hated organizations as a nick and
          make racist references
<pfuzz> sweetluv: ooh...such language!!! i love it
<K_K_K> SweetLuv : But but, my mother isn't a herm, so she can't do that to
        me, do you want me to ask her to wear a strap on?

<Sunspot> KKK: actually your refered to blacks not having good grammar
<K_K_K> Sunspot : So?  Can't help it if I point out the truth

* intermission *

     even though that was the second episode in #black i decided to
     release it in this issue. it was rather small but does well on
    content. to point out something, nyquil does not like to release
     issues dealing with only one or two channels. the more channels
     we have fun in, the better.

Deathbringer's Notation: Basically I went to #chatzone on the undernet and
pretended to be flashed and be a first time user.  You'll get the idea.
(My nick is `tyler'). I also waited around here and massflashed everyone 
a few times before I started shit so that a few people would share the 
same problem.

My crap is indented with one space and messages to me are in *starz*.

-- editors notes --

   nyquil is looking for some good ascii artists. i have no need for
   ansi at this time. obviously any form of art will be welcomed, but
  ascii especially. i have a great need for more ascii's. a site would
   not be far off for a few good quality ascii's.
