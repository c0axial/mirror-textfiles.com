     ..    nyquil seven. well it has lived till issue seven and it is still
	going. for some of you these jokes might be getting old. so we 
	will be coming out with something new next issue. might be on irc
	might not be. not really sure yet. however i do think it needs to
	expand a little bit.

     ..    any suggestions are still welcome and submissions are always 
	needed. in this issue recluse, the man, goes into #wicca. the log
	was small, and not that long, but hopefully some of you will be
	inspired or something.
