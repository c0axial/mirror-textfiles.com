                      * nyquil issue number three *

   rolling right along with issue number three. this issue is brought
 to you by reptile. he goes into #lesbos and pretends to be a confused
 girl. i think you will enjoy this one. we are now excepting sites for
 nyquil. anyone who submits and gets it released will be offered a site.
 other various sites will be given to friends etc. 
 
 in other news i have decided to name reptile my " cool guy number 2 "  
 in other words he has the second best position in the group, and to make
 something clear, there is only room for two people. however you can throw
 a nyquil affil anywhere you want if you submit. so think it over...
 but for now ...

i have been told a few times on irc that nyquil cannot and will not do
well due to the limited subject matter. this may be true, but i would 
like to give it a try. so again if you have any comments, suggestions,
or criticisms. find me on irc or mail me at paler@netcom.com
