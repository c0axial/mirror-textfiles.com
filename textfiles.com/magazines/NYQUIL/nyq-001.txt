                        * nyquil issue number one *

 it will not take too long to explain the purpose of this group so listen 
 up. all we do is go into irc channels and log practical jokes. this first
 issue happens to be me in #black pretending to be the reverend jesse 
 jackson. nyquil will be released every three to four days, so feel very
 free to log a joke and submit it. as far as rules and sites go, there are
 really none. maybe later on more regulations etc. will be made, but for 
 now i just want to spit nyquil's out every few days. so please submit
 something, only takes a minute.
