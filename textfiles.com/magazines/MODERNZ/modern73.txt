    It has happened to every serious carder, you get a card and attempt use
it, only to find out it is already dead.  This can be a major pain in the 
butt, especially if it compromises a good mail drop. Would it not be great 
if you could find out if a card is already dead, or has to low a limit, 
BEFORE you make the order?  Now you can, listed below  is the numbers, and 
merchant id's for all the major credit cards.  Call up like you work at a 
store and request authorization for a sale (with the dollar amount set to 
the amount you wish to spend). If it is dead the operator will reply with 
"pick up card"  or something similar.  If the card has to low a limit, the 
operator will reply  with "sale declined" or something similar.  If you 
happen to get an "authorization code" then you know the card is good, and 
can be used.  This way you will know if a card is good BEFORE you use it. 

    Okay that is enough of the boring stuff, now for the numbers/ID's.
