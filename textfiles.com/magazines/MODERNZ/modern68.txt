Disclaimer
----------

     I do not promote the act of credit card fraud.  If you get caught,
don't come crying to me.  You did this completely on your own.


Mail-Order Credit Card Fraud
----------------------------

     This is for carding things via mail or the phone.  These can be for
your computer, your car, or anything else you get out of a catalog..


  What is Carding?

        Carding is the act of using someone's(preferably someone else's)
credit card to buy stuff.  When I say "buy" I do not mean you go into a store
and ask for a pentium!  I mean through the countless number of mail order
catalogs out there.  Carding is a sure means of getting almost anything you
want, but caution must be exercised when one attempts to card.

  Who can Card?

        Anyone who can get a CCN(Credit Card Number) and has some balls can
card. But not everyone should.



Getting the Credit Card Number
------------------------------


        You don't actually get the card itself, you get the #, person it
belongs, their address+Zip, their phone number, and the expiration
date(very important), also not requiredm but useful, if you can find out the
limit, that will save you some worrying as to how much you can order.

     There are only 2 real safe ways of getting the card number.  The first
is if you work at a store that uses credit cards, you can just take a carbon
copy when nobody is looking and stick it in your pocket.

I.
 a.
       Another good way to get a hold of getting a hold of CCNs is if you
work at a job which requires you to handle CCNs, you can get them that way(I
won't waste time going over something so simple).  Some common places where
you can handle cards is in a clothing store, or just usually a store which
carries many expensive items.  If you do chose to use this method, BE SURE NOT
TO BE SEEN DOING IT!!
     Even though stores that use credit cards tear up the carbons, most times 
the numbers can still be pieced together.  If you don't work at a store, find 
someone that does and is willing to help you out.  Or just go behind some K-Mart 
at 3am and search through their trash. SOME STORES/BANKS HAVE VIDEO CAMERAS 
WATCHING THE GARBAGE!  Make sure to look for these before even thinking of 
going through it.  If you find one or more, make sure to cover them up or get
them out of the way.  Push them aside, crack the lense, spray paint them,
or whatever it takes.  Also make sure to check for anyone that might see
you.  When you're sure it's in the clear, just start digging for any
carbons that the store has thrown out.  It can get a little messy, but
the carbons are usually near the top, since the store throws them out at
the end of the day.

 b.  Trashing by Magik

    Well, i'm sure you have all heard of trashing, but how many of you 
actively trash? Let me explore some of the benefits for you. There are
several other possible goodies lying in the trash bins for you besides
credit card carbons(always a favorite though).

    For instance, i have found that generous amounts of information can
be gained about your peers by merely trashing at your school after it
gets out for the summer. You may obtain the entire class's grades and 
phone numbers in this fashion. For twenty minutes of work(max) not bad 
eh? The best part about this type of local information is, it can be 
sold on the street to any shnook in your town with some curiousity.
Even better, its at a school, so it would be very difficult for someone 
to bust you, and you wont have to do all that mission-impossible shit. 

    It is said that the greatest information is found in the bins of 
Bell offices, this is a much greater risk than trashing at your school
(i've seen BIG fences around some buildings .. you know, the kind that
say, " go away, go away"). However, you must also think about the payoff,
information is power, and power is the key. My word is on this one, do it
if you can handle the risks.

    If you are looking for financial information, a bank would be the 
obvious place to trash. This carries a great risk, and you never can tell
what the bank bastards are up to. A local bank here has metal covered
insets into a concrete wall. I assume this is common, and could be remedied
easily with a large amount of explosive, or an axe, but this would draw
much attention, which is not good in the least. If you run into this type
of security measure, try to cut the lock. The locks are usually those master
locks that weigh 5 pounds, those are a bitch to break. If you can, avoid 
them. If there is a locked dumpster, ALWAYS cut the lock, some are attached
by shitty little cables that any idiot could cut, but they may trip an alarm
, which should also be avoided. My point here is ... banks lock up all their
trash, and are a bad risk.

   The other places to find CCNs are stores that have the old credit-card
doohicky machine that makes carbons. These are the absolute best source of
CCNs. Some small stores use these, and it is quite simple to get into their
waste(they dont usually lock it up). Just go behind the store, watch for 
people, and go through their shit. No big deal. Hardware stores usually 
accept CCs, and most decent restaurants accept them. The only problem with
restaurants is, they throw out lots of nasty food and shit with the carbons.
Prepare to get messy.

   Should you do any of the actions i just described, always remember, look
in the paper waste first ...

   Oh yeah, and i'm not saying you SHOULD do these things ... just that
hypothetically if you were going to ...

II.                      

     You can also try getting your card number off of TRW, but be careful
with this.  If you don't have a valid password, hacking is out.  At the
first wrong password, TRW traces your phone number.  Two wrong passwords
from the same line, and they start investigating.

     If you want to get the card of some specific person, you can just catch
them as they're leaving work.  Knock them down, beat the shit out of them,
and take their wallet.  Take their watch while you're at it.  Just make
sure to cover your face so he/she doesn't know who you are.  

III.
        The most obvious place to get cards is a good HPVA board that has them
posted.  Also, there are people who will give you them if you card for them,
so you have to ask around, but use your judgment as to who to ask.  But the 
majority of times someone that is going to post a card on a board has already
use it till THEY don't feel safe with it any longer, or the card has a really 
low limit on it.
 
        One more way you can get CCNs is if your at a friends house, and
they're not exactly your best friend, or you don't mind fucking a friend over,
you can look for thier parent's wallet, purse, or whatever, and have you pick
of the multitude of cards there, once again DO NOT BE SEEN!!  This is
especially effective if your at a party, and there's alot of commotion to
distract everyone from you.
 

Identifying the Card
--------------------

     If you have a carbon copy, you need to know what kind of card it is.
The three main types of cards are Visa, Mastercard, and American Express.
They go by the following formats:

I. Visa

(Visa card)
4XXX XXX[X] XXX[X] XXX[X]
MM/YY    MM/YY*VISA
JOHN DOE

     Visa cards always start with a 4.  The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th group of
numbers can be either 3 or 4 numbers, depending on the card.  "*VISA" is
also sometimes replaced with a "BWG" on some cards.  Visa Gold cards have
the same general format, but always have all 16 digits on them.

     The card may also have letters after the "*VISA", which can identify
the card as the following:

     MM/YY*VISA V    [Preferred Card]
     MM/YY*VISA CV   [Classic Card]
     MM/YY*VISA PV   [Premier Card]

     The preferred cards are always backed with money, and are the safest
ones to use.  The classic cards are the newer cards which are harder
to copy.  Premier cards are the classic cards with preferred coverage.
Common numbers are 4448 020 XXX XXX, 4252 5123 6000 XXXX, and
4254 5123 8500 XXXX.  All 4712 1250 XXXX XXXX cards belong to the IBM
Credit Union, and are risky.

JOHN DOE

     American Express cards have any combination of numbers.  The format for
Gold Cards is XXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX, and is covered for up to $5000.00.




Verifying Your Credit Card Number
---------------------------------

     You can verify the credit card numbers many ways..  One number you can
call is 1-800-842-1250.  An operator answers on this one, so again, you
need to stay calm.  A much better way to validate your number is to call
1-800-228-1111.  A carrier will come up, sounding like a modem.  Hit the
# key on your phone.  Enter 5317007000220959 and hit the # key again.  The
recording will ask you for your card number, expiration date, and amount
of purchase.  Enter the # key after every entry.


Picking a Suitable Drop Site
----------------------------

     If you have the company send your merchandise to your house, you're
caught.  No doubt about it.  That's why you need a good place to have the
shit sent to, called a drop site.

     The best drop site is a house for sale, or an abandoned house.  Find
one that you are SURE no one lives in, because if there is someone staying
there, you have blown the whole thing.  Also, the best for-sale house are
those that were JUST moved out of.  And I mean just.  1-2 weeks is best.

     Another good drop site is someone else's house.  Not just anyone's
house, but someone who does not live close to you, and does not know you.
If they're old and don't have kids, it's even better.  Have the package sent
to their house, and prepare to do some good social engineering.  Get them on
the phone, and tell them that you had the package sent to the wrong address.
Do NOT give them your real name.  Don't tell them where you live, or any
real information that they could possibly trace.  After it's all over, it's
almost definate the police will come to them to investigate.  If they can
pin you, then you're caught.

     Do NOT try post office boxes.  You will get caught with these every
time, guarenteed.  Not a good idea.


The Execution
-------------

     Once you have your credit card number and your drop site, it's time to
make the order.  If you don't have a deep/mature voice, then you'll have to
get a friend that does.  It is a good idea to make the call from a pay
phone.  Some companies have caller ID lists of all calls in the last month,
and can figure out your number through the process of elimination.  If you
do pick a payphone, make sure it is a phone that is not on a busy street/in
a park/etc.  If the lady hears cars and other activity, she will get
suspicious.

     Go to your phone, and call up the company.  Make sure you have all your
information ready, so you don't have to search through papers and such while
you're talking on the phone.  (It does not look good when the operator asks
you for the drop site address and you have to look it up!)  You need a calm
voice while doing this.  Don't hesitate to say anything, and act as if you
know what you're doing.  When you've requested the product, the operator
will ask for your name, the name as it appears on your card, your phone
number, the billing address, the expiration date, and the method of shipping.
Some notes:  Make the name as it appears on the card your name, you should
obviously not give her your real name.  Also, if they offer overnight/next
day shipping, you should definately request it.  It gives them less time to
check you out, and besides, you're not paying for it anyway.  If the
operator has things to do, and starts asking personal questions, stay calm,
and don't say anything stupid.  Don't start to offer information, trying to
cover up anything you previously said.  (Example:  "Well, I live with my
wife and kids.  My three kids, that is.  And, uh, yeah, my wife is in Miami
right now.  No, I don't have any kids.  Did I say I did?  No, I meant, we're
thinking of having some kids.  Yeah.)

     The operator may request a call back to verify the phone number you're
calling from.  Do not stand around the payphone waiting for the call,
because it won't happen.  Most operators will call back in a few hours, or
the next day.  Try to bullshit the operator into skipping the call back.
Tell them you are at work all day and will not be there to accept.  If the
operator refuses, offer to have her call you back immediately.  This way you
can stay by the phone for 10 minutes and receive the call.


Picking Up Your Merchendise
---------------------------

     Go to the house late at night (2am, 3am) and put a note on the door
with some bullshit like, "I'm at work all day.  Please leave the package on
the doorstep."  Or if you're worried, have them bring it around to the
backyard.  Then after you're sure it has arrived, go to the house (again,
late at night), pick up the product, and get out of there as soon as you
can.  Do NOT stick around to check it out.  If you can, put it in a bag.  If
you're scared someone will see you, you can dress in black.  Whatever it
takes.

     Make sure no one sees you.  This is another good reason to pick a drop
site that is not near your house.  You can park a block or so down the
street, and if anyone does see you, they won't have a clue who you are.

     If you don't want to get it, you can give some kid 10 bux to pick it up
for you, but that is not that safe..  He could be seen, and when the police
question him, he will definately point the finger at you.

     After you have successfully carded the object(s), NEVER use the card
again, and DEFINATELY do not use that drop site again.  Forget you ever even
carded it.  Do not get greedy and think, "well, maybe they haven't found out
yet.  I can use another hard drive..".


Computer Service Credit Card Fraud
----------------------------------

     The best service to card on is Prodigy or Compuserve.  It is much like
carding from a mail-order service, but a few things are different.

     Like in mail-order carding, you need a valid credit card number and a
good drop site.


Getting a Account
-----------------

     This can be done a number of ways.  You can get one from local bbs's,
but they are not as reliable.  The best way is to get free trials.  Prodigy
offers them (1 month trials), and if you buy almost any modem/software, you
can get free "Basic Services" from CompuServe.

     Use your credit card number to subscribe to CompuServe/Prodigy.
CompuServe sends your permanent password to your address, use your drop site
address.  On CompuServe, you have to work fast because not only is the
shit you buy being charged to your card, but every minute you spend on the
system is charged to the same card.  That means the longer you take, the
more time they have to find you out.


Ordering the Product
--------------------

     Once you're on, go to the Online Shopping section.  Figure out what you
want to buy, and place the order.  If/When they ask you for a phone number,
you can either use one that is not used, or give them your Extension+9970.
(Example:  Your phone number is (201) 895-6666, give them (201) 895-9970)
This number is used by the phone company and is ALWAYS busy.  This is also
just a good number to give people in general if you are into Fraud.

     Whatever you order, do NOT go overboard!  Don't buy 30 USR DS's, or 15
hard drives.  They will definately check it out.

     To make it more authentic, you can have them send a card with some
bullshit like, "Happy birthday, Jimmy!!!" and such.  Try to make them think
it's just a little family present.


Picking the Product Up
----------------------

     Picking up your merchandise is mostly the same as picking up any other
mail-order product.  For details, read the above section on picking up
packages from your drop site.


Notes
-----

     Once you have received your package, never use your account again.
Throw it away.  Don't logon under that name, because if you do it will be
immediately traced.  Also, you might want to connect to Prodigy/CompuServe
via a PBX/Outdial, just incase they trace all calls and can look you up.


Conclusion
----------
