     I'm sure all of us have made, seen, or at least heard of a Molotov
Cocktail at one point..   This is basically a bottle filled with gasoline,
and a rag doused in the liquid hanging out of the opening at the top.  The
rag is lit, and the bottle thrown.  When the bottle is broken from the fall, 
the liquid inside is spread.  The lit rag then ignites the fuel, causing a 
significant amount of damage.

      There are many problems with the Molotov Cocktail.  As simple as it
sounds, it only has about a 50/50 chance of actually igniting the gasoline.
When thrown, the wind it creates could be enough to blow out of the flame.
The rag could also fall out.  There are several other factors which can
cause the Molotov Cocktail to fail..  which is where the chemical fire
bottle comes in.


Ingredients:

- Potassium Chlorate [2 teaspoons]
- *Concentrated* Sulfuric Acid [4 oz.]
- Sugar [2 teaspoons]
- Gasoline [about 8 oz.]


Materials:

- *Glass* Bottle [12 oz. size works for me]
- Cap for the bottle WITH plastic inside.  [Glass caps are best]
- Paper Towels
- Cooking Pan (with raised sides!)
- Glass/Plastic Cup and a spoon


Obtaining the ingredients:

Potassium Chlorate can not be made at home.  You must get this one from a
lab, or order it, or steal it from you school (this is how I get mine).

Sulfuric Acid is much to hard to make outside of a lab..  But you can get it
from any uncharged car battery.  To extract it, simply remove the top of the
batter and pour the acid into a glass container of some kind.  To obtain a
more pure sulfuric acid, you must boil it..  This will remove the pieces of
lead left over and other impurities.

All other ingredients/materials should be easily obtainable..

Before using the selected bottle, test the cap with some sulfuric acid.
Make sure the acid will not eat away at the cap within 24 hours..  If it
does, you'll need a new cap or bottle.


The creation:                                                             
[Note:  Read this through before attempting!]

1)  Pour the gasoline into the bottle, being careful not to let any drip on
the side.

2)  Pour the sulfuric acid into the glass bottle.  Wipe away any spills of
acid or gasoline, and screw the cap on tight.  Wash the bottle several times
to make sure there is no acid/gasoline on the sides/bottom.

3)  Put the potassium chlorate and sugar into your other glass/plastic cup.
Add 1/2 cup of boiling water, or enough to dissolve all of the potassium
chlorate and sugar.

4)  Place a sheet of paper towel onto the cooking pan with raised sides.  
Fold the paper towel in half, and pour the solution of dissolved potassium 
chlorate/sugar onto the paper towel until it is completely soaked.  Allow 
the towel to dry.

5)  Once dry, cover the outside of the bottle with sulfuric acid/gasoline
in it with glue.  Wrap the dry paper towel around the bottle, making sure 
that it sticks all around.  Store the bottle.  Make sure it does not fall 
over!

6)  Once completed, your solution in your bottle should be two parts;  a 
dark-brown solution at the bottom and a clear solution at the top.  This is 
the two solutions separating;  they will not mix.


Tips/Suggestions:

- NEVER open the bottle.  There might be drops of sulfuric acid on the cap, 
which could fall onto the paper towel and ignite the whole thing. 

-Make sure the cap is on TIGHT.  If any sulfuric acid leaks out of the top,
it will go off.

- If you want to test it, tear some of the paper towel off the side and put 
some sulfuric acid on it (only a few drops).  The paper towel piece should 
burst into a white flame.


Explanation:

     When the bottle is broken, the sulfuric acid comes into contact with 
the potassium chlorate on the dried paper towel.  The contact from a 
violent reaction of a large, white flame.  This flame ignites the gasoline, 
which spreads.  This has a damn near 0% chance of failing.

     That's about it.  Use the bottle just like any Molotov Cocktail..  
Throw it at the side of a house, or into a window..  whatever turns you on.
