                        Comments from the Editor

        Well, welcome to ASKi02... Nashville's one and only hacker zine! First,
two apologies. One, SORRY about ASKi01!!! The thing was FILLED with horrid
typos and grammatical errors... That is the last time I spell check a document
at two in the morning!!! Two, SORRY this doc took a year to put together!!!
Thanks to WC we finally got thing back on track... Well, here it is!! This
should prove to all you fuckers that we are not dead and we still believe that
information should be free... One bitch... WHY ONLY ONE COMMENT ABOUT ASKi01!?!
I know someone read it and thought "THIS SUCKS!" I hope someone read it and
thought "This rules!" It would be nice if both of your MENTIONED it!! Write me
and tell me what you thought!! We would like to hold an ASKiFEST in the park in
late July, give us some ideas... Oh, and to TN Governor's School... A. Why was
I rejected, I must be one of the most qualified computer science high school
students in the state... B. Why did you CS teacher tell members of the class
that ASKi was a bunch of stupid kids who don't understand freedom of speech?
The kinderfeindlichkeit (German, look it up) bigotries hinted at in that
statement aside, when you made that statement we had just started to work on
ASKi01!! We had never made a public statement concerning free speech!! We have
gotten a lot of bad press from people who were mad at Lizard King, but he
does not represent this organization and his statements do not reflect the
official opinions of ASKi nor do they represent the opinions of its members!
If you have a problem with me or my opinions, TALK TO ME ABOUT IT instead of
talking about it behind my back! This brings me to MEDIATE... I'm not going
to drudge up all the bull shit again... I just hope its all over with, and
despite what was said, the people involved all know what REALLY happened...
I would like to make another point... Mediate is a BAD idea... I believe there
should be a Nashville Sysop's group, but I have a problem with people running
a SysOp vengeance forum, and I posted the following in the Mediate forum...
"...I think this is a fundamental problem with Mediate system. I'm
not trying to tell you how to do anything, I just have a few suggestions and
comments. In reality, Mediate doesn't mediate anything, in my opinion it serves
as a revenge tactic for disgruntled SysOps. A SysOp is angry at a user so he
goes into Mediate and tells everyone to lock him out! Everyone does so and the
SysOp has gotten back at that person for whatever he or she might have done.
That SysOp might have been lying, exaggerating, or making impossible
assumptions, but the user has no chance to give his side of the story. There
are no checks and balances. Things DO get out of hand.... I think that mediate
should be open to all users, and the moment allegation are brought against a
person, that person should be notified by the Mediate president so that he or
she can defend him/herself. This is a fair and reasonable way to deal with
problems in the BBS community. Otherwise, Mediate will remain a tool for
revenge..." 'Nuff said... I was at Defcon last weekend and a lot of people
present seemed interested in ASKi. However, many had one question. Why are you
rehashing all the old shit? Because there isn't a PHVA mag out there designed
for the new hacker... You need a lot of base knowledge to start hacking these
days, and noone seems willing to provide that knowledge. I think the reason so
many new phreaks get into CCs and Codes instead of more interesting and less
damaging exploration is that the only people willing to deal with new people
are the real fucking criminals... Information like this is quite different, it
provides people with the option of exploring much more interesting topics
non-maliciously. I'll write more about defcon next issue. Finally, this IS the
Cyberpunk era!! Stop waiting for 2020 and get out there and live this exiting
culture before its gone! The future won't be like the it is in the novels, it
will be VERY different, Gibson and Sterling are describing the PRESENT (with
all little boost in technology), and the time to act is now!!! LIVE THIS and
enjoy it before its gone!!! Well, have phun! HACK OR DIE!

@PID: RA 1.11 2890
Hello! I've just re-started a BBS here in Crossville,...Just installed FD and
have sent in my request to join Fidonet....Was wondering how one could join
ShadowNET and ASKiNet and AquaNet?

I agree totally with everything that was in the NewsLetter! Found it
REFRESHING that there is a group started to help stop the right out
censorship that's going on with BBS's and everywhere else!
Also agree with your comments (except the part about no companies hiring
anyone like ourselves, I got lucky and I'm now part of a MIS dept. with
unlimited access to a modem and a budgeted amount for long-distance calls!)

ANYWAY....Please leave me a message about the my questions...

[=ûaxx=]

Jaxx,
        Well, just send me your real name, BBS name, location, number, and
whether your system will be able to accept mail anytime. I will confirm that
your front end and mailer are working, and add you to the nodelist. Your system
must be able to accept zipped mail and you must be willing to let the
conferences go uncensored.
        Thanks for the comments to the newsletter. We hope you like issue 2!
Congrats on the MIS job!!

        I have reprinted this file from Phrack 22 'cause I thought it would
be of interest to most of Nashville's new Phreak community. Another
recommended file for beginning phreaks or people who are just interested
in forbidden knowledge is the Official Phreaker's Handbook, PKMAN.ZIP,
available on many ASKi BBSs...

Introduction:  The State of the Hack
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
After surveying a rather large g-file collection, my attention was drawn to the
fact that there hasn't been a good introductory file written for absolute
beginners since back when Mark Tabas was cranking them out (and almost
*everyone* was a beginner!)  The Arts of Hacking and Phreaking have changed
radically since that time, and as the 90's approach, the hack/phreak community
has recovered from the Summer '87 busts (just like it recovered from the Fall
'85 busts, and like it will always recover from attempts to shut it down), and
the progressive media (from Reality Hackers magazine to William Gibson and
Bruce Sterling's cyberpunk fables of hackerdom) is starting to take notice
of us for the first time in recent years in a positive light.

Unfortunately, it has also gotten more dangerous since the early 80's.  Phone
cops have more resources, more awareness, and more intelligence than they
exhibited in the past.  It is becoming more and more difficult to survive as a
hacker long enough to become skilled in the art.  To this end this file is
dedicated.  If it can help someone get started, and help them survive to
discover new systems and new information, it will have served it's purpose, and
served as a partial repayment to all the people who helped me out when was a
beginner.

Part One:  The Basics
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
As long as there have been computers, there have been hackers.  In the 50's at
the Massachutes Institute of Technology (MIT), students devoted much time and
energy to ingenious exploration of the computers.  Rules and the law were
disregarded in their pursuit for the 'hack.'  Just as they were enthralled with
their pursuit of information, so are we.  The thrill of the hack is not in
breaking the law, it's in the pursuit and capture of knowledge.

To this end, let me contribute my suggestions for guidelines to follow to
ensure that not only you stay out of trouble, but you pursue your craft without
damaging the computers you hack into or the companies who own them.

I.    Do not intentionally damage *any* system.
II.   Do not alter any system files other than ones needed to ensure your
      escape from detection and your future access (Trojan Horses, Altering
      Logs, and the like are all necessary to your survival for as long as
      possible).
III.  Do not leave your (or anyone else's) real name, real handle, or real
      phone number on any system that you access illegally.  They *can* and
      will track you down from your handle!
IV.   Be careful who you share information with.  Feds are getting trickier
      Generally, if you don't know their voice phone number, name, and
      occupation or haven't spoken with them voice on non-info trading
      conversations, be wary.
V.    Do not leave your real phone number to anyone you don't know.  This
      includes logging on boards, no matter how k-rad they seem.  If you don't
      know the sysop, leave a note telling some trustworthy people that will
      validate you.
VI.   Do not hack government computers.  Yes, there are government systems that
      are safe to hack, but they are few and far between.  And the government
      has inifitely more time and resources to track you down than a company
      who has to make a profit and justify expenses.
VII.  Don't use codes unless there is *NO* way around it (you don't have a
      local telenet or tymnet outdial and can't connect to anything 800).  You
      use codes long enough, you will get caught.  Period.
VIII. Don't be afraid to be paranoid.  Remember, you *are* breaking the law.
      It doesn't hurt to store everything encrypted on your hard disk, or
      keep your notes buried in the backyard or in the trunk of your car.  You
      may feel a little funny, but you'll feel a lot funnier when you when you
      meet Bruno, your transvestite cellmate who axed his family to death.
IX.   Watch what you post on boards.  Most of the really great hackers in the
      country post *nothing* about the system they're currently working except
      in the broadest sense (I'm working on a UNIX, or a COSMOS, or something
      generic.  Not "I'm hacking into General Electric's Voice Mail
      System" or something inane and revealing like that).
X.    Don't be afraid to ask questions.  That's what more experienced hackers
      are for.  Don't expect *everything* you ask to be answered, though.
      There are some things (LMOS, for instance) that a begining hacker
      shouldn't mess with.  You'll either get caught, or screw it up for
      others, or both.
XI.   Finally, you have to actually hack.  You can hang out on boards all you
      want, and you can read all the text files in the world, but until you
      actually start doing it, you'll never know what it's all about.  There's
      no thrill quite the same as getting into your first system (well, ok, I
      can thinksavea couple of biggers thrills, but you get the picture).

One of the safest places to start your hacking career is on a computer system
belonging to a college.  University computers have notoriously lax security,
and are more used to hackers, as every college computer department ment has one
or two, so are less likely to press charges if you should be detected.  But the
odds of them detecting you and having the personel to committ to tracking you
down are slim as long as you aren't destructive.

If you are already a college student, this is ideal, as you can legally explore
your computer system to your heart's desire, then go out and look for similar
systems that you can penetrate with confidence, as you're already
familar with them.

So if you just want to get your feet wet, call your local college.  Many of
them will provide accounts for local residents at a nominal (under $20) charge.

Finally, if you get caught, stay quiet until you get a lawyer.  Don't volunteer
any information, no matter what kind of 'deals' they offer you.  Nothing is
binding unless you make the deal through your lawyer, so you might as well shut
up and wait.

Part Two:  Networks
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The best place to begin hacking (other than a college) is on one of the
bigger networks such as Telenet.  Why?  First, there is a wide variety of
computers to choose from, from small Micro-Vaxen to huge Crays.  Second, the
networks are fairly well documented.  It's easier to find someone who can help
you with a problem off of Telenet than it is to find assistance concerning your
local college computer or high school machine.  Third, the networks are safer.
Because of the enormous number of calls that are fielded every day by the big
networks, it is not financially practical to keep track of where every call and
connection are made from.  It is also very easy to disguise your location using
the network, which makes your hobby much more secure.

Telenet has more computers hooked to it than any other system in the world once
you consider that from Telenet you have access to Tymnet, ItaPAC, JANET,
DATAPAC, SBDN, PandaNet, THEnet, and a whole host of other networks, all of
which you can connect to from your terminal.

The first step that you need to take is to identify your local dialup port.
This is done by dialing 1-800-424-9494 (1200 7E1) and connecting.  It will
spout some garbage at you and then you'll get a prompt saying 'TERMINAL= '.
This is your terminal type.  If you have vt100 emulation, type it in now.  Or
just hit return and it will default to dumb terminal mode.

You'll now get a prompt that looks like a @.  From here, type @c mail <cr> and
then it will ask for a Username.  Enter 'phones' for the username.  When it
asks for a password, enter 'phones' again.  From this point, it is menu driven.
Use this to locate your local dialup, and call it back locally.  If you don't
have a local dialup, then use whatever means you wish to connect to one long
distance (more on this later).

When you call your local dialup, you will once again go through the TERMINAL=
stuff, and once again you'll be presented with a @.  This prompt lets you know
you are connected to a Telenet PAD.  PAD stands for either Packet
Assembler/Disassembler (if you talk to an engineer), or Public Access Device
(if you talk to Telenet's marketing people.)  The first description is more
correct.

Telenet works by taking the data you enter in on the PAD you dialed into,
bundling it into a 128 byte chunk (normally... this can be changed), and then
transmitting it at speeds ranging from 9600 to 19,200 baud to another PAD, who
then takes the data and hands it down to whatever computer or system it's
connected to.  Basically, the PAD allows two computers that have different baud
rates or communication protocols to communicate with each other over a long
distance.  Sometimes you'll notice a time lag in the remote machines response.
This is called PAD Delay, and is to be expected when you're sending data
through several different links.

What do you do with this PAD?  You use it to connect to remote computer
systems by typing 'C' for connect and then the Network User Address (NUA) of
the system you want to go to.

An NUA takes the form of   031103130002520
                           `___/`___/`___/
                             |    |    |
                             |    |    |____ network address

There are two ways to find interesting addresses to connect to.  The first and
easiest way is to obtain a copy of the LOD/H Telenet Directory from the LOD/H
Technical Journal 4 or 2600 Magazine.  Jester Sluggo also put out a good list
of non-US addresses in Phrack Inc. Newsletter Issue 21.  These files will tell
you the NUA, whether it will accept collect calls or not, what type of computer
system it is (if known) and who it belongs to (also if known.)

The second method of locating interesting addresses is to scan for them
manually.  On Telenet, you do not have to enter the 03110 DNIC to connect to a
Telenet host.  So if you saw that 031104120006140 had a VAX on it you wanted to
look at, you could type @c 412 614 (0's can be ignored most of the time).

If this node allows collect billed connections, it will say 412 614 CONNECTED
and then you'll possibly get an identifying header or just a Username: prompt.
If it doesn't allow collect connections, it will give you a message such as 412
614 REFUSED COLLECT CONNECTION with some error codes out to the right, and
return you to the @ prompt.

There are two primary ways to get around the REFUSED COLLECT message.  The
first is to use a Network User Id (NUI) to connect.  An NUI is a username/pw
combination that acts like a charge account on Telenet.  To collect to node
412 614 with NUI junk4248, password 525332, I'd type the following:
@c 412 614,junk4248,525332  <---- the 525332 will *not* be echoed to the
screen.  The problem with NUI's is that they're hard to come by unless you're a
good social engineer with a thorough knowledge of Telenet (in which case you
probably aren't reading this section), or you have someone who can provide you
with them.

The second way to connect is to use a private PAD, either through an X.25 PAD
or through something like Netlink off of a Prime computer (more on these two
below).

The prefix in a Telenet NUA oftentimes (not always) refers to the phone Area
Code that the computer is located in (i.e. 713 xxx would be a computer in
Houston, Texas).  If there's a particular area you're interested in, (say, New
York City 914), you could begin by typing @c 914 001 <cr>.  If it connects, you
make a note of it and go on to 914 002.  You do this until you've found some
interesting systems to play with.

Not all systems are on a simple xxx yyy address.  Some go out to four or five
digits (914 2354), and some have decimal or numeric extensions (422 121A = 422
121.01).  You have to play with them, and you never know what you're going to
find.  To fully scan out a prefix would take ten million attempts per prefix.
For example, if I want to scan 512 completely, I'd have to start with 512
00000.00 and go through 512 00000.99, then increment the address by 1 and try
512 00001.00 through 512 00001.99.  A lot of scanning.  There are plenty of
neat computers to play with in a 3-digit scan, however, so don't go berserk
with the extensions.

Sometimes you'll attempt to connect and it will just be sitting there after one
or two minutes.  In this case, you want to abort the connect attempt by sending
a hard break (this varies with different term programs, on Procomm, it's
ALT-B), and then when you get the @ prompt back, type 'D' for disconnect.

If you connect to a computer and wish to disconnect, you can type <cr> @ <cr>
and you it should say TELENET and then give you the @ prompt.  From there, type
D to disconnect or CONT to re-connect and continue your session uninterrupted.

Outdials, Network Servers, and PADs
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In addition to computers, an NUA may connect you to several other things. One
of the most useful is the outdial.  An outdial is nothing more than a modem
you can get to over telenet -- similar to the PC Pursuit concept, except that
these don't have passwords on them most of the time.

When you connect, you will get a message like 'Hayes 1200 baud outdial,
Detroit, MI', or 'VEN-TEL 212 Modem', or possibly 'Session 1234 established on
Modem 5588.'  The best way to figure out the commands on these is to type ? or
H or HELP -- this will get you all the information that you need to use one.

Safety tip here -- when you are hacking *any* system through a phone dialup,
always use an outdial or a diverter, especially if it is a local phone number
to you.  More people get popped hacking on local computers than you can
imagine, Intra-LATA calls are the easiest things in the world to trace
inexpensively.

Another nice trick you can do with an outdial is use the redial or macro
function that many of them have.  First thing you do when you connect is to
invoke the 'Redial Last Number' facility.  This will dial the last number used,
which will be the one the person using it before you typed.  Write down the
number, as no one would be calling a number without a computer on it.  This is
a good way to find new systems to hack.  Also, on a VENTEL modem, type 'D' for
Display and it will display the five numbers stored as macros in the modem's
memory.

There are also different types of servers for remote Local Area Networks (LAN)
that have many machine all over the office or the nation connected to them.
I'll discuss identifying these later in the computer ID section.

And finally, you may connect to something that says 'X.25 Communication PAD'
and then some more stuff, followed by a new @ prompt.  This is a PAD just like
the one you are on, except that all attempted connections are billed to the
PAD, allowing you to connect to those nodes who earlier refused collect
connections.

This also has the added bonus of confusing where you are connecting from.  When
a packet is transmitted from PAD to PAD, it contains a header that has the
location you're calling from.  For instance, when you first connected to
Telenet, it might have said 212 44A CONNECTED if you called from the 212 area
code.  This means you were calling PAD number 44A in the 212 area.  That 21244A
will be sent out in the header of all packets leaving the PAD.

Once you connect to a private PAD, however, all the packets going out from *it*
will have it's address on them, not yours.  This can be a valuable buffer
between yourself and detection.

Phone Scanning
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Finally, there's the time-honored method of computer hunting that was made
famous among the non-hacker crowd by that Oh-So-Technically-Accurate movie
Wargames.  You pick a three digit phone prefix in your area and dial every
number from 0000 --> 9999 in that prefix, making a note of all the carriers you
find.  There is software available to do this for nearly every computer in the
world, so you don't have to do it by hand.

Part Three:  I've Found a Computer, Now What?
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This next section is applicable universally.  It doesn't matter how you found
this computer, it could be through a network, or it could be from carrier
scanning your High School's phone prefix, you've got this prompt this prompt,
what the hell is it?

I'm *NOT* going to attempt to tell you what to do once you're inside of any of
these operating systems.  Each one is worth several G-files in its own right.
I'm going to tell you how to identify and recognize certain OpSystems, how to
approach hacking into them, and how to deal with something that you've never
seen before and have know idea what it is.


VMS -      The VAX computer is made by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), and
           runs the VMS (Virtual Memory System) operating system. VMS is
           characterized by the 'Username:' prompt.  It will not tell you if
           you've entered a valid username or not, and will disconnect you
           after three bad login attempts.  It also keeps track of all failed
           login attempts and informs the owner of the account next time s/he
           logs in how many bad login attempts were made on the account.  It is
           one of the most secure operating systems around from the outside,
           but once you're in there are many things that you can do to
           circumvent system security.  The VAX also has the best set of help
           files in the world.  Just type HELP and read to your heart's
           content.

           Common Accounts/Defaults:  [username: password [[,password]]]

           SYSTEM:     OPERATOR or MANAGER or SYSTEM or SYSLIB

           DECNET:     DECNET


DEC-10 -   An earlier line of DEC computer equipment, running the TOPS-10
           operating system.  These machines are recognized by their '.'
           prompt.  The DEC-10/20 series are remarkably hacker-friendly,
           allowing you to enter several important commands without ever
           logging into the system.  Accounts are in the format [xxx,yyy]
           where xxx and yyy are integers.  You can get a listing of the
           accounts and the process names of everyone on the system before
           logging in with the command .systat (for SYstem STATus).  If you
           seen an account that reads [234,1001]   BOB JONES, it might be wise
           to try BOB or JONES or both for a password on this account.  To
           login, you type .login xxx,yyy  and then type the password when
           prompted for it.

           The system will allow you unlimited tries at an account, and does
           not keep records of bad login attempts.  It will also inform you if
           the UIC you're trying (UIC = User Identification Code, 1,2 for
           example) is bad.

           Common Accounts/Defaults:

UNIX -     There are dozens of different machines out there that run UNIX.
           While some might argue it isn't the best operating system in the
           world, it is certainly the most widely used.  A UNIX system will
           usually have a prompt like 'login:' in lower case.  UNIX also will
           give you unlimited shots at logging in (in most cases), and there is
           usually no log kept of bad attempts.

           Common Accounts/Defaults:  (note that some systems are case
           sensitive, so use lower case as a general rule.  Also, many times
           the accounts will be unpassworded, you'll just drop right in!)

Prime -    Prime computer company's mainframe running the Primos operating
           system.  The are easy to spot, as the greet you with 'Primecon
           18.23.05' or the like, depending on the version of the operating
           system you run into.  There will usually be no prompt offered, it
           will just look like it's sitting there.  At this point, type 'login
           <username>'.  If it is a pre-18.00.00 version of Primos, you can hit
           a bunch of ^C's for the password and you'll drop in.  Unfortunately,
           most people are running versions 19+.  Primos also comes with a good
           set of help files.  One of the most useful features of a Prime on
           Telenet is a facility called NETLINK.  Once you're inside, type
           NETLINK and follow the help files.  This allows you to connect to
           NUA's all over the world using the 'nc' command.

           For example, to connect to NUA 026245890040004, you would type
           @nc :26245890040004 at the netlink prompt.

HP-x000 -  This system is made by Hewlett-Packard.  It is characterized by the
           ':' prompt.  The HP has one of the more complicated login sequneces
           around -- you type 'HELLO SESSION NAME,USERNAME,ACCOUNTNAME,GROUP'.
           Fortunately, some of these fields can be left blank in many cases.
           Since any and all of these fields can be passworded, this is not the
           easiest system to get into, except for the fact that there are
           usually some unpassworded accounts around.  In general, if the
           defaults don't work, you'll have to brute force it using the common
           password list (see below.)  The HP-x000 runs the MPE operating
           system, the prompt for it will be a ':', just like the logon prompt.

IRIS -     IRIS stands for Interactive Real Time Information System.  It
           originally ran on PDP-11's, but now runs on many other minis.  You
           can spot an IRIS by the 'Welcome to "IRIS" R9.1.4 Timesharing'
           banner, and the ACCOUNT ID? prompt.  IRIS allows unlimited tries at
           hacking in, and keeps no logs of bad attempts.  I don't know any
           default passwords, so just try the common ones from the password
           database below.

VM/CMS -   The VM/CMS operating system runs in International Business Machines
           (IBM) mainframes.  When you connect to one of these, you will get
           message similar to 'VM/370 ONLINE', and then give you a '.' prompt,
           just like TOPS-10 does.  To login, you type 'LOGON <username>'.

NOS -      NOS stands for Networking Operating System, and runs on the Cyber
           computer made by Control Data Corporation.  NOS identifies itself
           quite readily, with a banner of 'WELCOME TO THE NOS SOFTWARE SYSTEM.
           COPYRIGHT CONTROL DATA 1978,1987.'  The first prompt you will get
           will be FAMILY:.  Just hit return here.  Then you'll get a USER
           NAME: prompt.  Usernames are typically 7 alpha-numerics characters
           long, and are *extremely* site dependent.  Operator accounts begin
           with a digit, such as 7ETPDOC.

           Common Accounts/Defaults:

           $SYSTEM              unknown
           SYSTEMV              unknown

Decserver- This is not truly a computer system, but is a network server that
           has many different machines available from it.  A Decserver will say
           'Enter Username>' when you first connect.  This can be anything, it
           doesn't matter, it's just an identifier.  Type 'c', as this is the
           least conspicuous thing to enter.  It will then present you with a
           'Local>' prompt.  From here, you type 'c <systemname>' to connect to
           a system.  To get a list of system names, type 'sh services' or 'sh
           nodes'.  If you have any problems, online help is available with the
           'help' command.  Be sure and look for services named 'MODEM' or
           'DIAL' or something similar, these are often outdial modems and can
           be useful!
GS/1 -     Another type of network server.  Unlike a Decserver, you can't
           predict what prompt a GS/1 gateway is going to give you.  The
           default prompt it 'GS/1>', but this is redifinable by the system
           administrator.  To test for a GS/1, do a 'sh d'.  If that prints out
           a large list of defaults (terminal speed, prompt, parity, etc...),
           you are on a GS/1.  You connect in the same manner as a Decserver,
           typing 'c <systemname>'.  To find out what systems are available, do
           a 'sh n' or a 'sh c'.  Another trick is to do a 'sh m', which will
           sometimes show you a list of macros for logging onto a system.  If
           there is a macro named VAX, for instance, type 'do VAX'.

           The above are the main system types in use today.  There are
           hundreds of minor variants on the above, but this should be enough
           to get you started.

Unresponsive Systems
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Occasionally you will connect to a system that will do nothing, but sit there.
This is a frustrating feeling, but a methodical approach to the system will
yield a response if you take your time.  The following list will usually make
*something* happen.

1)  Change your parity, data length, and stop bits.  A system that won't
    respond at 8N1 may react at 7E1 or 8E2 or 7S2.  If you don't have a term
    program that will let you set parity to EVEN, ODD, SPACE, MARK, and NONE,
    with data length of 7 or 8, and 1 or 2 stop bits, go out and buy one.
    While having a good term program isn't absolutely necessary, it sure is
    helpful.
2)  Change baud rates.  Again, if your term program will let you choose odd
    baud rates such as 600 or 1100, you will occasionally be able to penetrate
    some very interesting systems, as most systems that depend on a strange
    baud rate seem to think that this is all the security they need...
3)  Send a series of <cr>'s.
4)  Send a hard break followed by a <cr>.
5)  Type a series of .'s (periods).  The Canadian network Datapac responds to
    this.
6)  If you're getting garbage, hit an 'i'.  Tymnet responds to this, as does a
    MultiLink II.
7)  Begin sending control characters, starting with ^A --> ^Z.
8)  Change terminal emulations.  What your vt100 emulation thinks is garbage
    may all of a sudden become crystal clear using ADM-5 emulation.  This also
    relates to how good your term program is.
9)  Type LOGIN, HELLO, LOG, ATTACH, CONNECT, START, RUN, BEGIN, LOGON, GO,
    JOIN, HELP, and anything else you can think of.
10) If it's a dialin, call the numbers around it and see if a company answers.
    If they do, try some social engineering.

Brute Force Hacking
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
There will also be many occasions when the default passwords will not work on
an account.  At this point, you can either go onto the next system on your
list, or you can try to 'brute-force' your way in by trying a large database of
passwords on that one account.  Be careful, though!  This works fine on systems
that don't keep track of invalid logins, but on a system like a VMS, someone is
going to have a heart attack if they come back and see '600 Bad Login Attempts
Since Last Session' on their account.  There are also some operating systems
that disconnect after 'x' number of invalid login attempts and refuse to allow
any more attempts for one hour, or ten minutes, or sometimes until the next
day.

The following list is taken from my own password database plus the database of
passwords that was used in the Internet UNIX Worm that was running around in
November of 1988.  For a shorter group, try first names, computer terms, and
obvious things like 'secret', 'password', 'open', and the name of the account.
Also try the name of the company that owns the computer system (if known), the
company initials, and things relating to the products the company makes or
deals with.

                             BUSTED!!!!!
                        You've been arrested!

     Life sure sucks now, don't it? Nope. This is where you get to
have more phun while learning a lot about the reason that your
government is NOT your friend.

             "Live in fame or die in flame" -- Mack

     First off, remember: no hero stuff here. They are probably
wearing bullet proof vests, arrive in bunches of 20, and carrying
heavy artillery. Even if it's only one redneck, they all still
suffer from having a severe trigger finger. There is no reason to
get roughed up, bruised, or shot.

                          The Attitude

     You need to have the attitude. Use your head, control your
emotions, and keep your mouth shut at all times. Remember that they
will give rewards to stoolies, so don't even discuss anything
outside of chitchat like local politics, news, or weather.

     Okay, second. You are not a young punk pain in the ass. You're
not a hero; you're not anything. You are a farm boy from Kentucky
and you're downright DUMB. You're kind and work with everybody as
much as possible, but stubborn. You apologize and call everyone sir
and generally kiss ass whenever possible. Why? Because you look
stupid and easy to take advantage of. Remember keeping your mouth
shut? This is the easiest way to do just that.

     Don't ever ask them for anything. Don't grovel. You are in
control of yourself; they are only in control of the situation.
Your complaints will go on report and give them satisfaction.
Remember "Miranda"? Well, those rights apply at ALL times. There is
no requirement to read them to you in a whole bunch of special
exceptions, so just assume that they've been read to you anyways.
They WILL appear compassionate and sympathetic, but they are really
robotized. They are totally impervious to all reason, logic and
common sense.

     Once you got the basic rules down, the rest of the procedure
is just one big game, except that the stakes are kind of high.
Don't sweat it if you can, but chances are that you're going to be
sweating a lot just because the first time you ever play in a
quarter million dollar poker game, the numbers get to you. Quarter
million? If you're going to be in the dungeon for say 10 years, you
could probably make about $25,000 a year easily. And that's after
the government takes out their share of something close to half. So
you're actually going to be playing for a quarter million dollars
even if it's only five years. Not only that, but once you've been
to jail once, all of your subsequent employers will be harder to
get and possibly pay less. But this is not a game you would
normally show up for. Usually, someone else volunteers you in.
Still not convinced? Well, let's take some numbers (old numbers but
proportions are right). From the official 1977 IRS figures, 8,391
persons qualified for priority treatment (were investigated). 3,408
were recommended for prosecution. Of those lucky winners, only
1,636 were indicted by grand juries. 247 of those were convicted
after trial and less than half ever served time in jail. At that
time, there were also approximately 90 million income tax filers
(out of a total population of 210 million). And we're not talking
about one of the roughest, nastiest teams in the American Legal
League, in most cases.

                      The Rules of the Game

     Okay, the point of the game is to get over the goal line. It's
just like football (and if you try to tempt them, they really will
sack the quarterback just because they are sadistic people). 
Here's what they score points for. Getting you to admit anything.
Getting you to incriminate yourself. Intimidating you. Getting you
to skip procedural details. There's only one problem with these
simple details: they are all professional players and you're just
an amateur team. That's why the game is rigged in your favor
intentionally. But unless you're a professional gambler, you
wouldn't even know it.

     Here's what you score points for. Getting them to admit
anything.
Getting them to perjure themselves. Getting them to foul (not
follow the rules). Giving them as much frustration and anxiety as
possible.  Making them lose in front of their friends (they all
have bad sportsmanship problems). Making them lose in front of the
press.

     I can't possibly go over all the rules. There are entire
libraries full of rules. And you thought pro-football was bad! But,
there are certain basics of the game. If you understand those,
you're way ahead.

                    Getting a Basic Rule Book

     If you want to actually buy a rule book, I know of one good
one that costs about $20. It is mostly for civil (law suits)
procedure, but he covers the differences between civil and criminal
pretty well and how to adapt.

     Don't get the "sequel" that he advertises. It's just a book of
forms and not much use except for the two page excerpt at the end
that talks about RICO, if you don't know anything at all about
RICO. Mike Brown's specialty is getting people out of prison, so he
might be useful later on, too. The place he has vast expertise in
is Terre Haute in Indiana, which is not a pretty place to spend an
all expenses paid government vacation at. For one thing, the other
tourists and the tour guides are absolutely lousy.

                         Levels of Play

     There are a bunch of levels of play. You will probably be like
most people and perhaps never even get to the higher levels, like
the appeals process. But unless you do something really stupid and
get shot, you are pretty much guaranteed to make it through the
first few levels. Remember the ways to score points. The more
points you score, the better your chances of winning. There are
some bonus points built in, too, like getting a judge get kicked
off the field for a personal foul (easier than you think, but most
lawyers are scared silly to even try to do anything like that).

1. Arrest.
2. Initial Questioning.
3. Booking.
Bonus Rounds: more questioning and pretrial services.
4. More Questioning.
5. Arraignment.
Bonus Round: Evidentiary Hearing.
Bonus Round: Administrative Hearing (automatic in a traffic case;
     otherwise rare).
Bonus Round: Grand Jury Indictment.
6. Trial.
7. Sentencing.
8. Appeals (pretrial services, trials, and sentencing).

     Hopefully, you can make it to at least some bonus rounds.
Getting an evidentiary hearing is relatively easy, for instance.
And at that round, there are some points that you can pick up, but
you can also get some point multipliers that will make scoring in
the actual trial worth more points. There are also no absolutes.
This is just a thumbnail sketch. Some levels can be skipped or
added in. Some levels can be skipped because of mistakes you make.
It is possible, for instance, to petition for a writ of prohibition
(an order from a more powerful judge telling his underling to stop
doing something to you) and go through a pseudo-appeals stage. Some
levels can happen completely by mail instead of in person (this is
very common at the appeals level). But, this basic list of levels
is usually good enough.  As you get better, you should have no
problems finding some of the bonus levels, like the writs (a writ
is an order from a judge which carries a lot of weight) levels.

                           Questioning

Okay, for now, let's go over the basic format to answering
questions.

Officer: Generic Question.
You: "Sir, can you please tell me if my answer to that question is
mandatory or voluntary?"

1. Officer: "Voluntary."
You: "Then I choose not to volunteer."

2. Officer: "Mandatory."
You: "Sir, what will you do to me if I don't answer?"

2a. Officer: "We'll kick the shit out of you."
You: "My answer is XXX under threat of bodily harm, coercion, etc."
or perhaps "I refuse to answer on the grounds that I may
incriminate myself." or perhaps "Show me the law, statute, case, or
whatever it is that makes it mandatory and then I'll answer." This
is a matter of personal taste; if you can take the punishment, go
for it. It depends on the situation.

2b. Officer: "You won't get out of here until you answer."

     They know it. You know it. So what? You'll eventually go to
trial and the judge will either have to force your answers to be a
condition of your release (this is appealable usually) or order you
to do so (which is a violation of the 5th amendment and which gives
you the power to recuse the judge so fast he won't know what
happened since he's now a party to the case by getting evidence on
the record). It really depends on whether or not you want to give
in to them.

     Remember, the whole point here is to attempt to act
cooperative while refusing to say anything if you can help it. This
is true at every stage of the game. There are lots of different
times where they will try to question you. Even other prisoners may
be sent in to try to get you to talk if you're important to them
and you're being a tough nut to crack. So keep acting stupid. Ask
for meaningful assistance of counsel to help you understand the
question. Volunteer for nothing.  After all, don't all the lawyers
tell you that only THEY can understand legal procedure?

     Okay, there is a special case for judges. Remember, judges
have to be impartial. With a judge, when he asks you for
information, such as what your name is, you say:

"Sir, are you attempting to enter evidence on the record because
you are a party to the case?"

This question REALLY pisses them off. If they say no, then don't
volunteer information. If they say yes, then they can't judge the
case anymore. Another appropriate question is, "Your honor, are YOU
the accusing party? Then who is the accusing party? I want to face
my accusers as required by the constitution."

     Here's an example of what happened once: "No, Sir. I just need
to know who you are so I can proceed with this case. And since when
I asked for the accused party, you answered, then if you are not
the accused party then you are interfering with this court and I
will find you in contempt." The right response to this sort of
nastiness is just to say something like, "Sir, It is the job of the
accusing party to identify the accused party; however, if you wish,
you can call me Peter Pan for purposes of identification until the
accusing party clears this matter up." A better way is not to get
into this situation. When you are called, stand and ask if the
accusing party is present. And the judge better not respond!
Otherwise, you just stand there and when the bailiff orders you to
walk forward or whatever, you just say, "I'm sorry if I'm in the
wrong place, Sir.  Your bailiff here ordered me to come forward."
This is part of jurisdiction. Jurisdiction is necessary for a court
to have control over a case. There are lots of ways they can get
it; when you plead guilty or not guilty, or when they get all 7
elements. Number 1 is positive identification of the accused party.
Accused must be properly identified; identified in such a fashion
there is no room for mistaken identity. The individual must be
singled out from all others; otherwise, anyone could be subject to
arrest and trial without benefit of "wrong party" defense. Almost
always the means of identification is a person's proper name, BUT,
any means of identification is equally valid if said means
differentiates the accused without doubt. (There is no
constitutionally valid requirement you must identify yourself) For
stop and identify (4th Amendment) see Brown v. Texas, 443 US 47 and
Kolender v Lawson, 461 US 352.

                             Arrest

     Remember all the things you read about Mirandizing you first?
Forget it. As long as they can get you to admit anything, they can
use it against you, regardless of whether or not you've been
mirandized.

     They will probably put the cuffs on too tight. And they will
handcuff you. Don't complain. Don't ask your kidnappers for
anything. You're the one in control here, not a wimp. Act like it.
Be respectful, though. Don't act better than them or they'll take
it out on you (all cops have deep fears of being inferior to
anybody). Your complaints will go in their report. Don't give them
any satisfaction!

     Do not answer any questions at all. Demand to get meaningful
assistance of counsel and counsel of choice, since it is your right
to have these at EVERY important stage, including the arrest
itself.

     Just try to be as cooperative as possible physically (there is
no reason to get the shit kicked out of you here) because it's not
going to be worth your effort to resist. Besides, that will give
them a reason to kick the shit out of you that they can use in
court.

     As far as the actual mirandizing, when they ask if you
understand, just say the truth. Say "No. I need counsel to help me
understand, Sir."

     You may get lucky. They might give you waist chains or leg
irons. If this happens, wear them with pride! Hardly anybody gets
that kind of treatment anymore and it means you're really special.
Show them off to the other prisoners, to any police you meet, the
public, everybody!

                             Booking

     They will ask for your name? Are you waiving rights if you
answer?  Yep! Aside from that, you could be waiving jurisdiction.
Remember how to answer these questions.."Sir, is the answer to that
question voluntary or mandatory?"

     What about mug shots and fingerprints. They will give those
back if you're not guilty, right? Yes, they'll give you the
originals, but you can be sure they've made copies. In Davis v.
Mississippi, they stated that fingerprints and other personal
identification essentially work like property. They need a search
warrant to get them.

                           Arraignment

     Before you are arraigned, they will probably keep you in a
holding cell until you're talkative. They will send a pre-trial
services
representative to try to get you to tell them your life history.
This is the same routine as booking. Don't answer anything.
At arraignment, the magistrate or judge will read the complaint,
information, or indictment against you and ask if you understand
it.  He is supposed to inform you of your right to assistance of
counsel, that you are not required to make any statements, and that
any statement may be used against you. The whole point of this
procedure is only to tell you what you have been charged with and
to make sure you don't understand it. So answer truthfully and say
"No" if you still don't have counsel. He may also ask you how you
plead. In this case, you may wish to say that "The accused stands
mute." If you make a plea of any sort, you could be giving them
jurisdiction. You could also say that "Since the defendant cannot
understand the charges, the defendant stands mute." The judge will
say "I will enter a not guilty plea for you." Say loud and clear,
"I object! Let the record show that the accused stands mute."

     Then the judge will start asking you personal questions. Shut
up. Keep the voluntary/mandatory routine up.

     Now, the prosecutor or judge or cop is going to absolutely
have a conniption and throw a tantrum because you won't answer
their questions. Let them carry on. In Federal courts, 18 USC 1342
sets release with the least amount of restrictions unless there is
some legitimate reason on which the court can justify the
imposition of restrictions greater than what would reasonably
assure your appearance.  In state courts, the situation is similar.
Okay, now after the government demands something more than your own
recognizance or an unsecured cash bond, then say loud and clear
something like, "Please put on record the fact that the government
has demanded that I be placed under the unreasonable bond
restrictions of XYZ merely because I choose to exercise my right to
remain silent."

     Some of the bond restrictions they may want (which are listed
in 18 USC 1342..find out the equivalent for the state) are distance
of travel, curfew, psychiatric testing, or even weekly reporting.
These are all considered unreasonable except with extra
circumstances (like you jumped bond before).

Object and state "Please put on record that the no reason was given
for the bond restriction of XYZ and the accused objects."

     The judge will most likely make submission of your prints and
pictures a condition of your release. If you don't give in, you'll
sit in jail.  Some of the booking questions will be about your
physical description.  The rest will be personal or about your
family; these are out of line.

     This much should get you at least through the first 3-4 days
of the standard arrest procedure and have heaps of procedural
errors lined up for "arguing technicalities" or appeals.

        Sup!!! This is an ASKI Special Release.... My research paper... You
might find this interesting, you might think it's complete BS, I really
couldn't care less. A few people were interested in reading this so I thought
I'd put it out. The first section is a little flat, but it's good info. I think
there are some real parallels here, anyway it makes you think... Have Phun....

                        Campaign of Terror
                           By Tom Cross


        "Cyberpunk, an unholy alliance of the technical world with the
underground of pop culture and street level anarchy (Elmer-Dewitt 59)." 
Bruce Sterling's graphic definition of America's newest counter-culture 
conjures up images of street gangs attacking each other with the high-
tech weaponry of the 21st century. Oddly enough, this is quite close to 
the way many people view today's teenage computer hackers. Evil 
criminals out to destroy man kind... This romantic view of the computer 
hackers has caused the entire electronic community to be attacked by 
government, law enforcement, religious institutions, corporations, and 
concerned citizens groups. Driven by a false view of hackers as an evil 
scourge of society, they have driven the electronic community into a 
corner. In the past there has been another group of "criminals and 
outcasts" in America who had been attacked by society. These were the 
colonists living in the British American Colonies, and when they fought 
back, thousands died and a new nation was forged. This new nation would 
grow to become the most powerful nation in the world. Events occurring 
now on the electronic frontier pose frighting similarities to the events 
surrounding the American revolution.
	Before describing the world of computer hackers, and the parallels 
that can be drawn to historical events, it is best to begin with a 
history of the American Revolution. Many of the people who came to 
America were out casts from British society. Many followed alternative 
religions and wanted to escape the established Church of England. Others 
were criminals who had been sent to America as punishment. There were 
also adventurers and speculators, who wanted to find fortune and success 
on the American frontier. Whatever their reason, many British citizens 
ended up living in America, and these citizens saw themselves as British 
people (Klose 20 -  21).
	The American Colonies were mercantile colonies. They were 
established to profit Britain, to provide raw materials for Britain, and 
to provide a market for British goods. The British government set up 
laws that would protect this mercantile policy, and that would ensure 
profit for the mother country. However, the colonists were selective 
about which laws they followed. If a law wasn't beneficiary to them, 
they ignored it. The British government accepted this, and because of 
political graft, competition with other nations, and the want for good 
relations between the colonies and the mother country, violations of 
English trade laws were often ignored. Britain was following a policy a 
salutary neglect. However, generation after generation, American 
colonists began feeling less and less like British citizens. When 
Britain established itself as the dominate world power, and no longer 
needed salutary neglect, the colonists were not happy (Midgley 43).
	Between the years of 1724 and 1741, a new generation of kids was 
born. Historian David Fischer describes these kids as a generation that 
grew up in a time when age was a person's most respected value, and grew 
old in a time when it was best to young. They were "heavy drinkers, 
daring pioneers, and angry orators attracted to high risk and decisive 
action." They alarmed the older colonists with their rebellious actions 
and their lack of education. As John Adams put it, "We have not men fit 
for the times. We are deficient in genius, in education, in travel, in 
fortune - in everything. I feel unutterable anxiety." Many were 
disappointed with the new generation, as they were poor and  uneducated 
in comparison to their elders, but they were adventurous, brave, an 
hateful towards control. They also felt little connection to Britain, 
and had gained military experience and a sense of freedom when they 
fought the French and Indian War without British assistance. These 
traits made them a perfect generation to rebel against the British 
government, especially at a time when the British government was trying 
to step up it's control (Howe 212 - 214).
	In 1763 the first conflicts between the British government and the 
colonists began to erupt. The British government was thousands of miles 
away from America, and thus was unresponsive to American needs. This 
resulted in a series of laws which greatly angered the Americans. The 
first of these was the declaration of the proclamation line. This was a 
line between the American colonies and the Indian territories, and it 
was intended to protect both the colonists and the Indians from 
conflict. However, thousands of colonists had already planned to move 
into the territory west of the proclamation line, and many were already 
there. The colonists had already invested time and money into moving 
across the line, and the proclamation angered them. Next, the Sugar Act 
was passed, this act placed a duty on molasses and sugar. The British 
also ended their policy of salutary neglect with a series of actions 
that clamped down on laws the colonists had been violating for 
generations; a vice admiralty court was established to try tax evaders 
who had previously been treated sympathetically by colonial courts, bond 
for shippers was raised, tax collectors for the colonies could not live 
in England, and tax officials were given writs of assistance (blanket 
search warrants). Another final action by the British government which 
brought protest was the passing of the Stamp Act. The Stamp Act required 
that stamps be bought and placed on about 50 paper documents from legal 
documents to newspapers. This law was not only a direct tax without 
representation, but it was an attack on freedom of speech. The colonists 
would react quickly and in some cases, violently (Midgley 46).
	James Otis called for a protest meeting to be held in New York 
City (Midgley 47). Letters were sent out to all of the colonies, and in 
October the Stamp Act Congress met (Midgley 47). Massachusetts, South 
Carolina, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware, New York, 
Pennsylvania, and Maryland were represented (Midgley 47). The Congress 
protested taxation without representation, and stated that only their 
legislatures could levy taxes (Midgley 47). Some of the protests were 
more violent. A few days after the Congress let out, a boycott on 
British goods was established (Midgley 47). This boycott was enforced by 
drunken mobs of liberty generation youths, twenty, and thritysomethings 
who called themselves the "Sons of Liberty." The "Sons of Liberty" 
forced merchants and printers to work without using stamps, burned court 
houses and tax collection offices, tarred and feathered tax collectors, 
and generally caused as much physical damage to those buying or selling 
stamps as possible (Tyne 163 - 172). Three weeks before the stamp act 
was passed, riots began in Boston (Tyne 166).

                "An effigy of Andrew Oliver, the nominated stamp
        distributor, later forced to resign that office, was
        swung all day on the 'Great Tree,' and after dark an
        'amazing' multitude shouting 'liberty, property, and
        no stamps,' bore the image an a beir, through the
        State House and under the very chamber where sat the
        Governor and Council. With the debris of the
        demolished stamp office they made a funeral pyre for
        the execrated effigy. Twelve days later the mob sacked
        the home of the customs officer, burned the vice-
        admiralty records, gutted the mansion of Lieutenant
        Governor Hutchinson, beating down the very partition
        walls, wrecking the furniture, and defacing family
        plate and portraits (Tyne 166)."

	Despite these highly rebellious actions, the British government 
was sympathetic. Only one, the Major of Artillery, wanted to "cram the 
stamps down the throats of the people." The government, instead, tried 
to keep the peace without being overly oppressive. Many people disagreed 
with this stance, and thought that the government should have "nipped 
the spirit of sedition in the bud," however, the British listened to the 
American requests and the Stamp Act Congress. In the end, the law was 
repealed (Tyne 163 - 172). 
	The Americans had won their first victory, but soon events would 
have them fighting again. With the repeal of the Stamp Act, Parliament 
issued a second order, the Declaratory Act. The Declaratory Act stated 
that Parliament could make any law that would hold the colonies and 
Britain together. It effectively refuted all arguments the Americans had 
made concerning taxation. The colonists ignored it, but the opinions of 
the colonists and the opinions of the British government were beginning 
to split. Parliament then passed the Quartering act. This act was an 
attempt to deal with the over-crowding of troops in New York City by 
requiring that the colony provide housing. This often meant shacking 
soldiers up with private citizens at the citizen's expense. The 
Americans resented this greatly, and many raised "liberty poles" in 
protest. A third act which brought American and British relations to a 
boil again was the Townshend Acts. These were a set of import taxes on 
glass, tea, lead, paint, and paper. These taxes would spur a resistance 
movement against the British that would eventually lead to war!
	A few Americans started a communication campaign. Two sets of 
letters were spread across the colonies, building opposition towards the 
laws and anger towards the British. The first was John Dickinson's, 
"Letters from a Farmer." These papers stated that Parliament could only 
levy an import duty for the purpose of trade control, not for revenue. 
These papers were widely read and widely accepted. The second set was 
Samuel Adam's Circular Letters. These were a series of statements 
renouncing taxation without representation. The Massachusetts House 
adopted them and sent them across the colonies. They proposed that the 
colonies form a unified effort to fight British oppression. The British 
declared the letters seditious, but they were officially adopted by four 
other colonies. These letters communicated the angers against the 
British to the people of the colonies. They agreed with what was being 
said, and growing opposition to Britain began to build in America.
	Tea time was a custom in both Britain and America (Bailey 97). In 
fact, Approximately 1 million people drank tea twice a day (Bailey 97). 
Tea was almost as essential to Americans a bread and water, and a tax on 
it was inexcusable. The Americans were in a rebellious mood, and in 1768 
a boycott began in Boston and spread all across the colonies in only a 
few months (Midgley 48). Colonial merchants were not to buy items taxed 
under the Townshend Act (Midgley 48). Although the boycott did not bring 
much harm to British merchants, the government decided to listen to the 
American demands (Midgley 48). A new Prime Minister came into power and 
repealed the Townshend Acts (accept for the tax on tea) (Midgley 48). 
The Quartering Act also expired and was not renewed (Midgley 48). 
	Because of these actions many Americans dropped the boycotts, and 
there was period of quiet for three years. However, there was a train of 
incidents that kept the revolutionary ball rolling (Midgley 48). The 
first was the Boston Massacre, which occurred a few months before the 
Townshend Acts were repealed (Midgley 48). Bostonians and British 
soldiers were not on friendly terms, and when a heated argument broke 
out between a British sentry and an American civilian, a crowd of people 
gathered and joined in (Midgley 48). When the crowd pressed toward the 
soldiers and started throwing rocks and snow balls, the soldiers became 
confused and frightened, and they opened fire (Midgley 48). Five were 
killed (Midgley 48). This incident raised a great deal of anger against 
the British in America. Sensationalistic rumors and news reports led 
people to believe that the Americans had done nothing wrong and that the 
British had just murdered them (Bailey 98). Massacre Day was observed in 
Boston until 1776 (Bailey 98). The second event was the Gaspee incident 
(Midgley 48). Americans attacked the British revenue ship Gaspee, chased 
it's crew to shore, and burned it (Midgley 49). The third was the 
establishment of the Committees of Correspondence (Midgley 49). This was 
an intercolonial propaganda campaign (Midgley 49). These Committees sent 
protests of British oppression all over the colonies for everyone to 
read (Midgley 49). This intercolonial communication network further 
forwarded the cause of revolution by making people aware of the 
colonist's claims, and encouraging people to join the cause (Midgley 
49).      
	The events that lead up to the American revolution reached their 
climax when the British offered an exemption from the tea tax, and thus 
a monopoly on tea, to the British East India Tea Company. Colonial 
merchants feared for their lively-hood and reacted very violently. 
People boycotted tea and tea ships were burned all over the colonies. In 
Boston a group of colonists disguised themselves as Indians and raided 
three tea ships. They dumped 342 cases of tea valued at $70,000 out into 
the harbor. In response to these actions Britain clamped down hard. A 
set of laws were passed that became know in America as the Intolerable 
Acts. These acts shut down the Boston harbor, moved all trials of 
British officers to England, removed the Massachusetts House's right to 
elect the upper council members, banned town meetings, blocked colonial 
expansion with Quebec, reinstated the quartering act, and removed the 
governor of Massachusetts. In protest the Americans began the First 
Continental Congress. A year later the first shot would be fired, 
America was at war with Britain (Midgley 49-50).
	The cyberpunk counter-culture consists of a group of young people 
who are obsessed with technology. They dress in black clothing, and 
surround themselves with video games and computers, techno music and 
raves, smart drugs and virtual realities, fringe science and science 
fiction, and, of course, computer hackers (Elmer-Dewitt 58 - 65). These 
cyberpunks have a lot in common with the liberty generation on the 
1700's (Howe 212). A combination of neglect and resentment from self-
interested Baby Boomers and declining school systems resulted in today's 
"Generation X" turning out a lot like the liberty generation (Howe 55 - 
81). Todays kids are rebellious, adventuresome, and brave, sometimes to 
the point were they fall off the edge. Suicide rates are at the highest 
level ever recorded (Howe 83), and in the drug filled city war zones of 
America, a Generation Xer's life expectancy is lower than that in 
Bangladesh (Howe 120). America's school system has declined, and many 
Generation Xers have learned a lot more on their own than in the 
classroom (Howe 69 - 81). Their parents are quick to place ridicule and 
blame on them for the fact that they do not have all of the academic 
knowledge of their elders (Howe 17 - 27). However, they have learned 
what is needed to solve practical problems, and their business and 
information management skills are often far better than that of their 
parents (Howe 80). It is important to note that these are things they 
taught themselves, not things they were shown in a classroom. One group 
of Generation Xers who spend their time trying to teach themselves in 
areas their school has failed with are computer hackers.
	Computer hackers, skilled computer geniuses who would spend days 
awake at the screen, typing out a new program, existed as early as the 
1960's at MIT. However, today's computer hackers, who are similar in 
their behavior, find their roots from another group of Baby Boomer 
engineering students, the Phone Phreaks. Phone Phreaks experimented with 
the phone network, using electronics to avoid being charged for 
telephone calls (Claugh 12). The most powerful electronics device used 
for this purpose was the blue box (Clough 15). The telephone company 
based their entire network on a set of tones called multi-frequencies 
(Clough 13). They published these tones in a technical journal in 1954, 
and before long engineering students all over the country were using 
them to explore the phone network (Clough 13). The Blue Box gave a user 
control of all of these tones, and thus control over the entire world 
wide network (Clough 16). 
		
                "They found a labyrinth of electronic passages
        and hidden sections within the Bell network, and they
        started charting this unknown territory. Then they
        realized they were looking at the inside of an
        enormous electronic system, that Ma Bell was really
        just a giant computer linking terminals - or
        telephones - with switches and wires and loops all
        across the country. It was an actual place, though it
        only existed at the end of a phone receiver. It was a
        nearly limitless electronic universe accessible by
        dialing numbers on a phone (Clough 12)."

	It was 1961 before Bell even knew what was going on (Clough 12). 
They tried to stop it, but phreaks could just go out to a pay phone 
leaving Bell with no way of tracking them down (Clough 16). A series of 
laws were passed locally and federally in the 60's and 70's in order to 
stop phone theft, but most were unenforceable, and some, such as a law 
making it illegal for people to posses information relating to phone 
systems, were so restrictive that they were ruled unconstitutional. 
Although there were occasional arrests, generally of well known and 
popular phreaks, the phone phreak world under went it's own period of 
salutary neglect. Bell didn't become extremely active in stopping 
phreaking until the mid 80's, when it became plausible again.
	The Phone Phreak world had it's hey day in the early 70's (Hafner 
19). After that time the phreaks had a new interest, building personal 
computers (Clough 27). In 1976 two phone phreaks who had been building 
and selling Blue Boxes for cash out of their parents garage, built a 
personal computer (Clough 29). When they showed it to their local 
computer club, the members loved it and a few placed orders (Clough 30). 
The two phone phreaks were Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, and they had 
just founded Apple Computer Corp. (Clough 29). The PC revolution that 
these two phone phreaks started would revolutionize business, education, 
and entertainment (Clough 33). By 1993 there would be over 130 million 
PCs in use world wide, and PCs would have reached about 35% of all homes 
in industrialized nations (Clough 33). The PC revolution would also come 
full circle and revolutionize the world of computer hackers and phone 
phreaks. In 1978 Ward Christensen and Randy Suess hooked a computer up 
to a telephone line in order to provide a sort of messaging service for 
the members of their computer club. They had created the first computer 
bulletin board system or BBS. These computer BBSs would explode in the 
coming years. By 1993 there would be over 12 million people using 
computer BBSs (Telebits 20). As Phone Phreaks turned their interests to 
PCs and eventually into computer hacking, they found they could use 
these BBSs to communicate. In the eighty's a new generation of computer 
hackers and phone phreaks, kids who had gotten a computer for Christmas 
and had found it more interesting than school and an escape from their 
parents, would be using BBSs to talk to friends all over the country.
	Computer hackers have a need for forbidden knowledge, and when one 
called a BBS, he found thousands of other kids who had the same 
interest. They wanted to learn things that noone else knew, they wanted 
to be able to do things that were beyond the understanding of ordinary 
people. On BBSs they found knowledge about phone systems and computer 
networks that noone else in the world knew. They were experimenting with 
things that even their parents didn't understand. Growing up in the 70's 
and 80's they saw all the corruption and problems in government, 
business, and all other aspects of adult life. They were liberating 
technology from this corrupt world and using it to learn. There had 
always been people who wanted to learn things noone else understood, but 
never before had thousands of these people been networked across a 
nation, and never before had these people been so intense in their need 
for forbidden knowledge that they were willing to completely cut 
themselves off from society inorder to obtain it. The BBSs were a 
hacker's fantasy world, a place were, for once, information was free, 
money wasn't everything, and adults didn't have all the answers 
(Sterling 43 - 85).
	Hackers weren't violating many laws with the knowledge they had 
obtained. Sure they knew a few things they weren't supposed to know and 
they accessed a few computers they weren't supposed to be on, but they 
were learning and they weren't causing much harm (Sterling 62 - 63). 
However, much like the colonists in the late 1700's, hackers ignored any 
law which did not serve their mission of free information (Howe 201). 
They also delved into other kinds of forbidden information, such as lock 
picking, bomb construction, drug mixing, military tactics, and murder 
(Sterling 79 - 80). This fact may seem alarming, but few of the hackers 
were actually using this information (Sterling 80 - 81). They were just 
interested in it because it was rare and fun knowledge (Sterling 80 - 
81). "Stuffing gunpowder into a booby trapped flashlight, so as to blow 
the arm off your high school vice principal, can be a thing of dark 
beauty to contemplate. Actually committing assault by explosives will 
earn you the sustained attention of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco, and Firearms (Sterling 81)." However, this information did 
attract the attention of parents, and eventually, law enforcement.
	Pressure was building on law enforcement to act, and they did. 
However, few law enforcement officers would be willing to raid a bunch 
of kids because they wanted to know things they weren't supposed to 
(Sterling 63). Thus a large number of rumors started spreading across 
law enforcement agencies and news media that a Bulletin Board System was 
a "tool of Satan (Rosenberger 57)," "a dark switchboard where sneaky 
misfits can hatch all manner of secret and illicit schemes (Rose 27)." 
These rumors became more popular as "Computer Terrorists" appeared in 
the news more and more often, and they eventually escalated to 
ridiculous and dangerous levels. Eventually it got to the point where 
law enforcement agents were out chasing ghosts, and reporters were 
telling parents how their kids could be tapping in to vile things such 
as pornography, computer viruses, cults, snuff software, the president's 
e-mail, and phone numbers for evil organizations like the NRA 
(Rosenberger 57). Some law enforcement agents actually thought deterring 
pedophilia was a major objective of any police program concerning BBSs 
(Rose 27). There was even a concerned parent's group that formed to 
lobby for a law banning children under the age of 18 from using BBSs 
(Hults). Things had gotten completely out of hand.

                "Police want to believe that all hackers are
        thieves. It is a tortuous and almost unbearable act
        for the American justice system to put someone in jail
        because they want to learn things which are forbidden
        for them to know. In an American context, almost any
        pretext for punishment is better than jailing people
        to protect certain restricted kinds of information.
        Nevertheless, policing information is part and parcel
        of the struggle against hackers (Sterling 63)."

                "...computer bulletin boards are hangouts of a
        new generation of vandals. These precocious teenagers
        use their electronic skills to play hide-and-seek with
        computer and telephone security forces (Colossus)."

                "There are very serious negative consequences
        surrounding the use of modems and computers in our
        society.  Because of this, all children under the age
        of 18 should be prohibited from using a computer in
        connection with a modem or that is connected to any
        computer service (Hults)."

                "According to Fresno Police Detective Frank
        Clark, 'your child can be in real danger from
        pedophiles, rapists, satanic cultists and other
        criminals known to be actively engaged in computer
        conversation.  Unwittingly, naive children with a
        natural curiosity can be victimized; emerging healthy
        sexual feelings of a child can be subverted into a
        twisted, unnatural fetish affecting youth during a
        vulnerable time in their lives (Hults).'"

   
        Much like the colonists in the late 1700's, the computer
underground's salutary neglect ended with a tough crackdown on freedom
and rights. The law enforcement agents were told to seize everything and
they did. Standard procedure was to seize every possibly related piece 
of electronics equipment or printed document, partly because many law 
enforcement agents were computer illiterate and didn't know what they 
were looking for, and partly because many law enforcement agents believe 
that hackers are sinister and quite capable of hiding evidence anywhere 
(Sterling 213 - 216). The first such raid was a raid on the "414 gang" 
who attracted media attention for nine days in 1982 (Sterling 87). Since 
that time the raids would become more and more common until 1990 when 
they would reach their climax. During just three days in 1990 about 42 
computers and 23,000 floppy disks were seized (Sterling 156 - 159). The 
warrants that were issued have been compared to the writs of assistance 
in colonial times, not to mention the Salem witch hunts. The government 
went in, took everything it could find, walked out, and came back in 
about 2 years. Every raid became another horror story.


                "Three years ago in 1990, January 19 was a
        Friday.  It was 4 days after AT&T shut down for 9
        hours during Martin Luther King's birthday, it was the
        day the USSS served a Federal search warrant at the
        Zeta Beta Tau fraternity house at the University of
        Missouri-Columbia. I was the intended and actual
        victim as Special Agents Tim Foley and Barbara Golden,
        accompanied by Reed Newlin (Southwestern Bell
        security), and officers from the University police and
        the University's administrative office tore through my
        room with a legal license written so broad that they
        could have walked off with TV, VCR, and refrigerator.

                Desperately searching for traces of the public
        911 information and copies of Phrack Magazine, the SS
        came up empty, but not before they had completely
        harassed and intimidated me.

                As the raid began, the University police
        physically restrained me even though I made no attempt
        to stop them nor did they have any reason to believe I
        would respond violently.  I asked to see their warrant
        and they went inside.

                Unlike other USSS raids in 1990 there were no
        guns were drawn... but I suppose that the presence of
        some 30+ witnesses cramming the halls watching them,
        probably helped the agents keep it holstered as well.

                Eventually, I was allowed to seat myself on the
        floor outside my room where I could partially see and
        hear what the agents were doing and saying.

                They went right to work, starting with jotting
        down the serial numbers of every electrical device in
        the room to check and see if it was stolen property.
        I wasn't worried about that.

                All of my school books and notebooks for class
        were checked for illegal information.

                After noticing a book about law schools on my
        shelf, the agents had themselves a good laugh about
        how I would never have that option when they were
        through with me.

                Agent Foley was prepared to remove my entire
        audio compact disc collection as evidence (of what I
        have no idea), until Agent Golden informed him that I
        could not use them in my Apple IIc 5 1/4 inch floppy
        drive (instead she told him I could have used them in
        a 3 1/2 inch drive). (They were both wrong...)

                Copies of the Phrack subscriber list were taken
        along with a notebook containing newspaper clippings
        about Robert Morris and other noteworthy people and
        incidents relating to computers.  The SS decided that
        reading the Wall Street Journal and saving some
        articles was at the least suspicious, if not a felony.
        (Among hundreds of other names and Internet addresses,
        the subscriber list contained an entry for an
        individual who was an employee for Steve Jackson
        Games.)

                And then the telephone rang...

                I began to get up when the police forced me back
        down.  Agent Foley noticed the commotion and remarked
        'They'll call back!'  And that is when the answering
        machine clicked on.  The agents chuckled since they
        knew they were about to hear a private message being
        delivered to me.  It was like they were wiretapping
        without a warrant. The caller didn't identify himself.
        He didn't need to.  It was my co-editor, desperately
        trying to find out what was happening and letting me
        know his intention to drive to Columbia that evening.

                After the ceiling tiles had been lifted, the
        furniture moved away from the walls, the mattress
        flipped, and the carpet pulled up, the agents decided
        to leave (believe it or not they completely ignored
        the bottle of Barcardi that was sitting in there).

                As I plead with them not to take my Apple
        computer, Agent Foley declined to speak with me unless
        I was Mirandized again.  I decided a Q&A session would
        be inappropriate at this time so I declined. But
        before he left, Foley informed me that I was not under
        arrest, but I was going to jail for violating the
        Computer Fraud & Abuse Act of 1986, for the illegal
        Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property, and for
        Wire Fraud.

                On February 6, 1990 (18 days later) I was
        indicted (Neidorf)."

                "The crusaders got creative, and contacted some
        government agency concerned with family and heath
        matters. They obtained some kind of order from this
        agency directing the BBS sysops, a married couple, to
        shut down their BBS or face being judged unfit parents
        and having their children taken away (Rose 27)!"
	
                "On January 30th, the FBI served a search
        warrant on Rusty & Eddies BBS, and essentially trucked
        it away - an estimated $200,000 worth of computing
        equipment (Files from the FBI - Bulletin Boards and
        Badges 31)."

                "...the FBI alluded to the fact that if the
        system came back up, they could, under law, seize
        Jay's father's house. His father asked Jay to move out
        of the premises (Files from the FBI - Bulletin Boards
        and Badges 33)."

                "On the morning of March 1 - a Thursday -
        twenty-one-year-old University of Texas student (Chris
        Goggins)... was wakened by a police revolver leveled
        at his head (Sterling 138)."

                "Standard computer-crime search warrants lay
        great emphasis on seizing written documents as well as
        computers - specifically including photocopies,
        computer printouts, telephone bills, address books,
        logs, notes, memoranda, and correspondence. In
        practice this has meant that diaries, gaming
        magazines, software documentation, nonfiction books on
        hacking and computer security, sometimes even science-
        fiction novels have all vanished out the door in
        police custody. A wide variety of electronic items
        have been known to vanish as well, including
        telephones, televisions, answering machines, Sony
        Walkmans, desktop printers, compact disks, and
        audiotapes (Sterling 159)."

	The computer community, much like the colonists, also received 
financial attacks. The first of these was an attempt by Southwestern 
Bell to charge business telephone rates to all owners of BBSs in Texas. 
The passage of this law by the Public Service Commission in Texas, and 
the resulting war to get the rate change repealed, shut down almost all 
the BBS activity in Texas for three years. Southwestern Bell and other 
local telephone companies across the country tried similar stunts, and 
one telephone company even went so far as to design a device which could 
detect if a customer was using his phone with a computer, automatically 
raise his rates, and tack a $100 service charge onto his bill. In New 
York the state legislature tried to pass a tax on the distribution of 
shareware, a common BBS function which is generally done free of charge. 
The FCC also got into the act, considering many "modem taxes" but never 
passing any of them. These attacks added greatly to the growing 
frustration and anger that was brewing. 
	Not all the hackers were innocent, and not all the BBSs were 
clean, but the law enforcement agents made a number major constitutional 
and civil rights violations which raised tensions further still. Beside 
the constitutional questions that were raised concerning the items that 
were seized in the raids, the government made a number of First 
Amendment violations. A bulletin board system is a medium of 
communication, much like a magazine, and seizing a BBS brings up 
questions concerning the system operator's free speech rights. Generally 
raids on publishers have special controls placed on them, but these 
controls were not followed during raids on BBSs. Furthermore, the 
government raided a magazine publisher and a role playing game publisher 
because they believed that these two businesses were going to publish 
information on how to hack into the 911 emergency telephone system. The 
notion the hackers might be hacking into emergency phone services and 
the fact that the telephone company claimed that the information they 
were going to publish was worth $80,000, set the press on fire with 
sensationalistic stories. In the end the document turned out to be worth 
only $13, but the damage to the First Amendment rights, finances, and 
privacy of the raided individuals was done (Sterling 99 - 153). In 
November, 1992, a meeting of hackers in Washington was broken up by 
security forces who claimed to be working for the United States Secret 
Service. This raid brought many questions as to the hackers' right to 
freedom of assembly, especially when the United States Secret Service 
denied the incident and was later proven to be lying (2600 43). In the 
end the government only got a handful of convictions, but destroyed many 
lives in the process.
	By 1990 BBSing had become a world wide industry with millions of 
participants (Telebits 20). These people were greatly insulted and angry 
at the way their hobby was being defamed by the press and the 
government. They were not criminals! They were not stealing property or 
selling drugs! They were just communicating with their computers! 
"Liberty poles" went up all over the BBS community, messages telling 
police and government employees to keep out, that they were not wanted 
there. Some BBSs held rallies to defend sysops who's systems had been 
seized (Files from the FBI - Bulletin Boards and Badges 33). The hackers 
were a little more determined in their struggle. Some wrote angry 
manifestos, defending hacking and freedom of information (Sterling 85). 
Others directly attacked anyone they perceived as an enemy, 
disconnecting their phone service or damaging their credit ratings 
(Colossus). A legal organization called the Electronic Frontier 
Foundation formed to fight for realistic interpretation of the 
Constitution as it applies to computer communication (Sterling 249). 
This organization would fight and win legal battles in the name of 
computer users who had wrongly been attacked by the government. 
"Committees of Correspondence" became the main form of computerized 
protest, as dozens, possibly hundreds of electronic magazines, white 
papers, and editorials filled the electronic frontier. These documents, 
like the press reports, were often sensationalistic, but they often 
contained more truth than the press and the government were willing to 
offer. Communication became the main form of protest for a world built 
on communication.


                "Another one got caught today, it's all over the
        papers.  'Teenager Arrested in Computer Crime
        Scandal',  'Hacker Arrested after Bank Tampering'...
      
                Damn kids.  They're all alike.

              But did you, in your three-piece psychology and
        1950's technobrain, ever take a look behind the eyes
        of the hacker?  Did you ever wonder what made him
        tick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded
        him?
      
                I am a hacker, enter my world...
        
                Mine is a world that begins with school... I'm
        smarter than most of the other kids, this crap they
        teach us bores me...

                Damn underachiever.  They're all alike.

                I'm in junior high or high school.  I've
        listened to teachers explain for the fifteenth time
        how to reduce a fraction.  I understand it.  'No, Ms.
        Smith, I didn't show my work.  I did it in my head...'

                Damn kid.  Probably copied it.  They're all
                alike.

                I made a discovery today.  I found a computer.
        Wait a second, this is cool.  It does what I want it
        to.  If it makes a mistake, it's because I screwed it
        up.  Not because it doesn't like me...
                        Or feels threatened by me...
                        Or thinks I'm a smart ass...
                        Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't
                        be here...
        
                Damn kid.  All he does is play games.  They're
                all alike.

                And then it happened... a door opened to a
        world... rushing through the phone line like heroin
        through an addict's veins, an electronic pulse is sent
        out, a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is
        sought... a board is found.

                'This is it... this is where I belong...'

                I know everyone here... even if I've never met
        them, never talked to them, may never hear from them
        again... I know you all...

                Damn kid.  Tying up the phone line again.
                They're all alike...

                You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been
        spoon-fed baby food at school when we hungered for
        steak... the bits of meat that you did let slip
        through were pre-chewed and tasteless.  We've been
        dominated by sadists, or ignored by the apathetic.
        The few that had something to teach found us willing
        pupils, but those few are like drops of water in the
        desert.

                This is our world now... the world of the
        electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud.  We
        make use of a service already existing without paying
        for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by
        profiteering gluttons, and you call us criminals.  We
        explore... and you call us criminals.  We seek after
        knowledge... and you call us criminals.  We exist
        without skin color, without nationality, without
        religious bias... and you call us criminals. You build
        atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and
        lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own
        good, yet we're the criminals.

                Yes, I am a criminal.  My crime is that of
        curiosity.  My crime is that of judging people by what
        they say and think, not what they look like. My crime
        is that of outsmarting you, something that you will
        never forgive me for.

                I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto.  You
        may stop this individual, but you can't stop us all...
        after all, we're all alike ("Mentor")."

                "'Conference!' someone yelled as I put the phone
        to my ear. Then came a mind-piercing 'beep,' and
        suddenly my kitchen seemed full of hyperactive 15-
        year-olds. "You the guy who wrote the article in
        NEWSWEEK?" someone shouted from the depths of static,
        and giggles. "We're  going disconnect your phone," one
        shrieked. "We're going to blow up your house," called
        another. I hung up.
                Some irate readers write letters to the editor.
        A few call their lawyers. Hackers, however, use the
        computer and the telephone, and for more than simple
        comment. Within days, computer "bulletin boards"
        around the country were lit up with attacks on
        NEWSWEEK's "Montana Wildhack" (a name I took from a
        Kurt  Vonnegut character), questioning everything
        from my manhood to my prose style.  "Until we get real
        good revenge," said one message from Unknown  Warrior,
        "I would like to suggest that everyone with an auto-
        dial modem call Montana Butthack then hang up when he
        answers."
                Since then the hackers of America have called
        my home at least 2000 times. My harshest critics
        communicate  on  Dragonfire, a Gainesville, Texas,
        bulletin board where I am on teletrial, a video-
        lynching in which a computer user with grievance
        dials the board and presses charges against the
        offending party. Other hackers -- including the
        defendant -- post concurrences or rebuttals. Despite
        the mealtime interruptions, all this was at most a
        minor nuisance; some was amusing, even fun.
                FRAUD: The fun stopped with a call from a man
        who identified himself only as Joe. "I'm calling to
        warn you," he said.  When I barked back, he said,
        "Wait, I'm on your side. Someone has broken into TRW
        and obtained a list of all your credit-card numbers,
        your home address, social-security number and wife's
        name and is posting it on bulletin boards around the
        country." He named the charge cards in my wallet
        (Colossus)."

        Although there are many small similarities between the American
Revolution and Electronic Frontier, the most important parallel is the
central theme of both conflicts. We have two groups who fear each other
and lack a realistic understanding of what the other side feels. In the 
late 1700's a huge ocean separated America from Great Britain. The ocean 
meant that any news that arrived from the other side was always 3 months 
old, and it meant that each side had no way of relating to or 
understanding the needs of the other side. In 1993 the barrier is not 
one of distance and speed, but of technology. The Electronic Frontier is 
a futuristic world beyond the grasp and understanding of the majority of 
the population. The law makers are not part of this world, and it is 
quite difficult for them to become a part of it and to understand it. 
The same goes for the computer community. They live in their technical 
world every day and they cannot understand why most Americans are so 
confused when faced with this technology. They don't see themselves as a 
threat and they don't know why they are being oppressed. Each side will 
have to come to understand the other, and they will have to work with 
each other in order to find a solution. In the 1770's, had Great Britain 
tried to listened to colonists demands instead of cracking down on their 
law breaking, there probably wouldn't have been a revolution. America 
would have become it's own nation, as did the other British colonies 
over time, but it would have happened peacefully. Tensions continue to 
rise in the computer community. One of the most respected and possibly 
one of the most conservative members of the electronic community, Jack 
Rickard, editor of Boardwatch Magazine, called the government's 
crackdown on BBSs a treasonable "Campaign of Terror (Rickard 8 - 10)!" 
Hopefully the members of the electronic community and law enforcement 
will be able to see beyond their own sides of this conflict. If not, 
fears will escalate, tempers will rise, and there might just be a second 
American Revolution.

        The following is a reprint from Phrack Loopback. I couldn't believe
that Phrack didn't flame this fucker so I thought I'd do it myself. You'll see
what I mean when you read the letter!!!! This asshole may have good intentions,
but he, like so many before him, completely denies that fact that most people
under 18 are HUMAN BEINGS, OF SOUND MIND AND BODY, CAPABLE OF MAKING LOGICAL
DECISIONS!!!!


Dear Phrack Staff,

There are very serious negative consequences surrounding the use of modems
and computers in our society.  Because of this, all children under the age
of 18 should be prohibited from using a computer in connection with a modem
or that is connected to any computer service.

Please read my attached news release and join me in spreading this message.

NEWS RELEASE                                                     March 18, 1992


PEDOPHILIA, COMPUTERS, AND CHILDREN

If you have children in your home and a home computer complete with a telephone
modem, your child is in potential danger of coming in contact with deviant and
dangerous criminals.

Using the computer modem, these unsavory individuals can communicate directly
with your child without your knowledge.  Just as importantly, you should be
concerned if your child has a friendship with other youth who has access to
this equipment in an unsupervised environment.

Using a computer and a modem, your child can readily access community "bulletin
boards" and receive sexually explicit and graphic material from total strangers
who can converse with your children, individuals you quite probably wouldn't
even talk with.

The concern becomes more poignant when stated otherwise; would you let a child
molester, murderer, or convicted criminal into your home to meet alone with
your child?

According to Fresno Police Detective Frank Clark, "your child can be in real
danger from pedophiles, rapists, satanic cultists and other criminals known to
be actively engaged in computer conversation.  Unwittingly, naive children with
a natural curiosity can be victimized; emerging healthy sexual feelings of a
child can be subverted into a twisted, unnatural fetish affecting youth during
a vulnerable time in their lives."

It is anticipated that parents, when armed with the knowledge that this
activity exists and awareness that encounters with such deviant individuals
can result in emotional and psychological damage to their child, will take
appropriate measures to eliminate the possibility of strangers interacting with
their children via a computer.

_______________________________________________________________________________
I could write a file as long as this 'zine thrashing this asshole but instead
I'll just make a few simple points...
1. Lets see... What was it? 10 to 14 MILLION people using BBSs?
   Lets see... What was it? 2 to 4 cases of phedophelia on BBSs ever reported??
   Gee, that's 1 in every 4 million!!!!! So, we should ban anything
   that is used by at least one phedopheliac per 4 million... I'd
   have a problem finding something that isn't used by one sicko per
   4 million!!! Jesus!!
2. Does this guy use BBSs??? No, he doesn't!!! If he did he wouldn't hold such
   a fucked opinion of them... This guy has never used a BBS in his life!!!
   He has never seen a phedopheliac on a BBS!!! He DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S
   TALKING ABOUT!!! And I'll bet if you trace that Cop's sources you come up
   with nothing, as everything the guy said was complete BS from start to
   finish! People who actually USE computer networks will tell you that it
   isn't even close to being that bad!!!
3. People under 18 are not that fucking ignorant!!!! Your kinderfiendlichkeit
   still hanging around from the 70's might tell you that we're all a bunch
   of stupid bothersome assholes but that is no way to write nation policy!
   Jesus, after growing up in a world filled with uncensored TV and radio
   where everything has to be war or sex, a world filled with drugs and drug
   wars, stupid hippies, rapists, kidnappers, thieves, street level anarchy,
   uncaring and careless adults, stupid, ignorant people, and high suicide
   rates, etc... you think we could avoid the 4 sickos roaming the matrix!!!
   JESUS!
4. Negative consequences from use of computers and modems in our society!?
   Yeah, compared to amazing positive consequences, the 4 sickos running around
   hardly constitute something to worry about...
5. If parents are really worried about it, why don't they pull the plug on
   their own kid instead of pulling the plug on EVERY kid! The rest of us
   should be allowed grow up learning and experiencing the information age
   without them. Let the ignorant fucks pay the price for their paranoia!
FUCK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

                      Beating DTMF recorders and dial locks...

        This is a neat little trick that every phone phreak should know. Pulse
dialing is done by repeatedly breaking and reconnecting of the connection
between your phone and the switch. Thus, you can pulse dial by hitting the
hang-up key. However, the pulses must be quick (less than one second each), and
you can't stop pulsing a number until you have finished (a pause tells
the switch that your current number is finished you are about to send another
number). Make one pulse for 1, two pulses for 2, and so on, with ten pulses
meaning 0. Example, say I was dialing 911, I'd hit the hang-up key 9 times
quickly, pause, hit it one time, pause, and then hit it again. Practice dialing
your own telephone number from your house, it you get a busy signal you've got
it! Besides being a great party trick ("Hey, I'll bet you $20 I can dial ANY
telephone number without touching the key pad!!"), this has a few practical
uses. We've all seen dial locks on phones. Many airports use them, often there
are a few fones with area hotels on speed dial and the real dial locked, these
make great victims 'cause you have an instant alibi for using the phone! Also,
this will beat many cheep DTMF recorders (ie, this won't fool the DTR in ESS).
They are used in hotels for billing and they record EVERY number you dial,
including codes (This is why so many phreaks work in hotels!). You can use this
method to dial numbers that will not show up on hotel records (They'll still
know you made the call.). However, you could always try "If your records show
no numbers be dialed, HOW COULD I HAVE MADE $102.57 IN PHONE CALLS!?!?"

        The Beige Box is a very useful device that has gone by many different
names in the past. Basically it is a line-man's handset. It allows you to,
among other things, gain access to anyone's phone line and phreak all you
want!!! The Phone Company ACTUALLY uses this technique to make calls when on
the road... There are two main ways to build one of these and I will discuss
them both.

Note: Some of this will not work under ISDN. One cannot listen to an ISDN
telephone call after the signals have left the NT-1 without a specially
designed device which picks up the conversation without sending switching
signals. I do not have the slightest fucking idea how one would go about
building one of these, maybe you could rip shit out of an NT-1, but I don't
have $500 to waste trying this!!!!

NOTE: The situations described in this file are hypothetical, and the main
intent of this file is to provide information on telecommunications. This file
will teach you about phone line voltages, conferencing of conversations, and
how the phone company's test sets can and are used. I do not recommend that you
try anything in this file on anyone's line other than your own; it could
shorten your life in the free world...

1 -- The Quick Way.
        Get a standard phone cord and rip one plug off. Then strip the ripped
end (Radio Shack sells a nice device for doing this.) and hook up 2 alligator
clips, one to the green wire (called the tip wire) and one to the red wire
(called the ring wire). Then plug a phone into the other end (This may require
a male to male coupler.) and your ready to go!!

2 -- The Best Way
        Go to Radio Shack and pick up a bag full of Red, Green, Black, and
Yellow alligator clips (comes with 8, you only need 4), a Telephone Network
Interface Box (A little beige (haha) box with 8 screws and a telephone wire
coming out of it.), and some wire. Pop out the 4 tabs on the sides of the box
and put one end of each alligator clip through the holes (use one of each
color). The clips don't fit perfectly so you'll have to squeeze them in. Wire
the red clip to one of the screws on the red terminal, the green clip to one of
the screws on the green terminal, and so on for the other 2 colors. Plug your
phone in and that's it!

 -- Note --
	You can also plug a modem into these!

-=How to use=-

 -- Attacking a Neighbor's Line --

        Well, go out to your neighbor's house and find the little gray Bell box
on the side or back wall near the power box. This is the real network interface
box, it should have a bell logo on it. Open this up and you will see 1 of 2
things depending on how old their house is.

1 -- Older houses
	You'll see 5 screws, like this:  

*                 *

         *

*                 *

        Plug your clips into the screws on the right (or on the left if the
guy has 2 lines). If you don't get a dial tone try switching the clips.

2 -- Newer houses
        You'll seen 8 screws, 4 for line one and 4 for line 2 (line 2 screws
will have no wires connected to them if the guy doesn't have a second line).
You will also see 2 phone plugs. You can plug your phone directly into a phone
plug or hook up the clips to the corresponding screws.

 -- Attacking a Junction Box --

        This box can also be hooked up to a telephone junction box or can (the
gray boxes that stick out of the ground and hang from telephone poles)(DON'T
HOOK YOUR CLIPS UP TO A POWER CAN!!!). Get a 7/16ths hex driver and open one of
these up. You will see a mass of cables all hooked up to some white terminals
or screw sets. Hook your clips up and experiment until you get a dial tone.

 -- What to do -- 
        Well, you can make all the LDs, 700, 900, Blue Box, and hack calls you
want!! They will all be traced/charged to the line you are hooked up to. You
can also listen in on all calls made to/from the line, or disable the line by
hooking the screw for the red clip and the screw for the green clip together.
(This is the same as putting the call on hold...) At a neighbors house you can
set up all sorts of features including remote call forwarding (Lots of
phun!!!!). Also, if you made the box the 2nd way, and the guy has 2 lines or
you are at a junction box, you can get 3-way by Brown Boxing!!
        You also may want to hook this box up to your own phone line...
Take the phone plug and plug it into one of your wall jacks. By hooking the
green and red clips together, you can put the calling party on hold; rubbing
the clips together produces fake line noise or a "bad connection." Hooking up
a multi-meter or a vol meter will give you more info, use the following chart:

On hook  =   50 VDC, if less than this, your line could be bugged...
Ring     =   Jumps between 1 and 50 VDC...
Off hook =   1-13 VDC, depends on the type and number of phones off the hook,
             this is useful if you want to know if someone is eavesdropping on
             your conversation...

        When you pulse dial you break the connection and reconnect quickly. If
you press the hook switch the voltage will go up until you let go. If you let
the voltage reach 50 volts you will be disconnected. You can pulse dial by
hand. All you have to do is repeatedly press the hook switch. However, it does
take some practice to be able to dial well. This method can be used to defeat
dial locks sometimes seen on phones in airports and the like...

-=The Brown Box=-

        The Brown Box is a simple device that connects 2 lines to allow 3-way
calling. First I will describe how to do this at your own home and then how to
do it with the better Beige Box!!!!!! Go out and get a line splicer, the little
box you plug into you wall jack to allow 2 phones to be hooked up to one plug.
We will be using it in reverse, to allow 2 lines to be hooked up to one phone.
Plug the male end (the one that is supposed to go to your wall jack) into the
back of your phone. Then plug line 1 in and make a call. When the person
answers, plug in line 2. You will hear a dial tone and either of you can
dial!!!!! With the better Beige Box you need to wire the black terminal to the
red terminal and the yellow terminal to the green terminal, making sure nothing
shorts. Then, hook your clips up to line one and make a call. When the person
picks up, hook your black clip to line 2 where you would normally put your red
clip, and hook up the yellow where you would normally put the green. You'll get
a dial tone. You can hook the terminals of more than one better Beige Box
together to add more people to your call, but you will have to amplify the
speech so that everyone can hear.

                  The Theory of Self-Reproductive Software

        Many people still think the subject of viruses is taboo. Fueled by the
media and led by self-righteous assholes who think they know something of
computer science, everyone seems to think viruses are always evil!! There are
now groups of IS dickheads who using threats and harassment to intimidate
SysOps who spread viruses!!! Even PHRACK made a statement against the spread
of virus info, calling it boring and dangerous. Well, I find viruses (and
worms, etc...) very interesting and possibly very helpful. This section will
be a chronicle of my own exploration into this subject. I will include source
code examples, sometimes in B.A.S.I.C., but mostly in C, when I can. This issue
I will be discussing helpful viruses and worms.
        When discussing the usefulness of reproductive code it is important
first to define exactly what viruses, worms, and trojans are. Trojans are not
self reproductive, they are standard programs that have a hidden function that
is unknown to the user. They are often used to plant a virus or a worm in a
unsuspecting host. A virus is a program that spreads through systems and
networks by taking control of other programs and waiting for the user to
execute them. This can often mean destroying the host program, but, in more
powerful viruses, the host is left unharmed. A worm is a program that spreads
on it's own accord, without the use of host programs. The worm creates child
worms, and executes them before leaving them to spread farther. Although
viruses and trojans can occur in almost any environment, worms normally only
occur in multitasking systems where more than one worm can be running at one
time.
        The idea of a reproductive program originated in the seventies in a
book called "The Shockwave Rider" in which a hacker used an Internet style worm
to crash the government's systems and thus, overthrow it. The first actual
worms where helpful! Developed for LANs, one spread through the LAN looking for
problems, another searched for open system room and worked on problems, letting
the power go when something else wanted it. Worms such as these could be used
in WANs and LANs for system maintenance and software upgrades. Imagine how
quickly and easily a nodelist could be updated if a worm was sent out to deploy
the new version, destroying itself once it's mission was accomplished!
        Another possibility is the anti-virus virus (or worm). This virus would
spread through a system, infecting disks and connected systems whenever it can.
Once on a disk, it would make sure it wasn't already infected, and if not, it
would infect the most frequently run program on the disk, and then do a virus
scan, killing any that it finds. This program could also do other maintenance
on disks and would automatically add itself to any new disk added to the
system. A program such as this could run through a LAN or WAN, doing
maintenance and quickly getting onto other systems that are added in.
        John C. Dvorak proposed a info searching virus. This virus would go
through the net looking for info on a specific topic and bring it back to the
originating system, killing itself once it is finished. This virus would be of
great help in today's internet, where there are literally thousands of gigs of
data. With this program a search would take hours instead of weeks.
        The fourth possibility I am going to discuss is the possibility of
soft-ICE (Incursion Counter-Electronics). Soft-ICE would not be able to kill a
hacker, but it would be able to defend against him. ICE could monitor every
account and look for suspicious activity. It could shut down accounts that are
being attacked and, if on a net, it could shut down accounts on systems the
hacker has gone through. It could even be deployed on a black balling mission.
If someone's account has been hacked, the ICEworm could go through the net and
tell other systems to shut down that account until the user has been notified.
        Finally, it is important to note the computer virus's power as an
artificial life form. Everyone knows that computer viruses and worms are
capable of self-reproduction, self-preservation, and in many cases, consumption
and waste disposal. But did you know that they are capable of evolution and
natural selection?! Imagine if a computer virus was designed to modify it's
self randomly every 20th time it copied??? The virus would evolve after a
few hundred generations and the new, better virus would eventually spread
far beyond its ancestor, possibly even causing it's ancestor to become extinct!
This virus would not be limited in the extent to which it could spread, and
years after it's creation it might start forming intelligence!!! Thousands of
years from now, if the virus kept up with technology, it might form emotions
and even self awareness!! Artificial life is a very important and interesting
science. The things it teaches us about the natural world are astounding, not to
mention the excitement of creating our own LIVING organisms and species on a
computer and seeing how the survive in their environment!!! Computer Viruses
are a very important part of artificial life research. Despite what the
anti-virus "experts" may have told you (while covering their own political
asses), they are the first artificial life programs ever released out into the
"wild" to inter-relate on their own. The potential for future use they have is
almost unlimited. If their authors had added evolutionary processes to their
code, many would have lost their damaging functions by now and would be gaining
intelligence and defence mechanisms! Viruses in private experiments have
evolved to amazing levels. Computer viruses as an artificial life form may
eventually change how scientists look at the universe! Control the use and
study of computer viruses, and you might prevent a revolutionary scientific
discovery!
        Next edition I will be discussing overwriting viruses with some C
source...I will be consulting Phalcom/Skism on some virii.  They are the
leading authorities in virus creation.

                             THE VAXORCIST
                             -------------

(SCENE: Inside of a VAX computer room.  CREDITS ROLL as the SYSMGR is
sitting in front of the console terminal, typing.  He pauses, picks up a
small magnetic tape, walks over to a tape drive, mounts it, and returns to
the console where he continues typing.)

(There is a knock at the door.  SYSMGR walks to the door and opens it,
revealing USER.)

USER:  Any idea when the system will be up?

SYSMGR:  Well, I just installed version 5.0 of VMS, so I'm going to run
some diagnostics on it overnight to make sure it works alright.  Assuming
everything goes alright, the system should be up first thing tomorrow
morning.

USER:  Great.  Thanks.  (Exits)

(SYSMGR closes the door and returns to the console.)

ROD SERLING-LIKE VOICE:  This is John Smith, Lawrence Technological University
System Manager.  In an effort to make his system the best it can be, he has just
installed VMS Version 5.0 onto his VAX.  But little does he know that the
Version 5 documentation kit from Digital includes a one-way ticket to ...
the VMS TWILIGHT ZONE!

(ominous music - fade out)

(Fade in.  The SYSMGR scans the console for a moment, then turns, picks up
his coat and walks to the door.  He stops at the door for a moment, looking
back at the big machine.  Finally, he turns out the light and exits,
closing the door behind him.)

(Cut to the Console Terminal.  We read the following as it is printed on
the console terminal:)

VMS V5.0 DIAGNOSTICS --

DIAGNOSTICS - PHASE 1 STARTING...

DIAGNOSTICS - PHASE 1 FINISHED SUCCESSFULLY.

DIAGNOSTICS - PHASE 2 STARTING...

TESTING MICROCODE ... SUCCESSFUL

TESTING DECNET ...  SUCCESSFUL

TESTING LICENSE MANAGEMENT UTILITY ... SUCCESSFUL

TESTING SYSTEM SERVICES ... SUCCESSFUL

TESTING HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL AND COMPLETELY UNDOCUMENTED AI ROUTINE ...

(Cut to view of the Tape in the Tape drive.  The tape spins for a moment,
and suddenly stops.)

(Cut to view of the Machine Room.  A fog has begun drifting across the
floor, and the hardware is slowly being backlit by a pulsing red light.
A peal of weird laughter cuts through the silence.  A variety of bizarre
things occur:  A VT100 monitor sitting on a table slowly rotates 360
degrees; the tape drive opens and tape begins spewing out of it; slime
begins pouring out of a disk drive; the line printer begins form-feeding
like mad.  These continue for several minutes, or for as long as we can
keep them up.  FADE OUT)

(SCENE: Hallway outside of the computer room.  SYSMGR walks up to the door
and is met by USER.)

USER:  System going to be up soon?

SYSMGR:  (as he speaks, he tries to open the Machine room door, but the
door is apparently stuck.) The diagnostics should be done by now, so we
should be up in about 15 minutes... (he succeeds in opening the door, but
is confronted by floor to ceiling magnetic tape.  Tangled at about eye
level is an empty tape reel. SYSMGR takes the reel and looks at it.  CLOSE
UP of the reel so we can read the label, which reads: VAX/VMS V5.0
DIAGNOSTIC KIT.) (to USER) ...give or take a few days....

(SCENE:  View of TSR (Telephone Support Rep) from behind as she is sitting
in a cubicle, a terminal in front of her.  Beside her on the wall is a
poster which reads "Digital Has It Now - But You Can't Have It".  We can
see the terminal, but we should not be able to read what is on it.  She is
wearing a headset.)

TSR:  Colorado Customer Support.  What is your access number, please?

SYSMGR VOICE: 31576

TSR:  And your name?

SYSMGR VOICE:  John Smith.

(Cut to SYSMGR standing beside his console.  He his holding a phone to his
head with his right hand, and holding a printout in his left which he is
perusing while he talks on the phone.)

TSR VOICE:  And what operating system are you using?

SYSMGR:  VMS version 5.

TSR VOICE:  And is this a problem with the operating system or a layered
product?

(As the SYSMGR looks up from the printout, his eyes suddenly widen and
he drops the printout and ducks.  At that second, a disk platter flies
through the air where his head just was.  Slowly, SYSMGR stands up and
looks to where the disk went.  PAN BACK to reveal a stack of boxes with a
disk embedded in one of them at neck height.)

SYSMGR:  (into the phone) Operating System.  Definitely the Operating System.

(Cut back to TSR sitting at her desk.)

TSR:  Can you describe the problem, please?

(SYSMGR voice can now only be heard as mumbling)

TSR:  Yes... Tape drive spewing tape into the air... yes...  Line printers
printing backwards... yes... miscellaneous hardware flying through the
air... uh huh...  disk drives melting... yeah... strange voices coming from
the CPU board... I see... yes.  Is that all?  (pause as she finishes typing
at the terminal)  Well, I'm afraid that that team is busy at the moment,
can I have them get back to you?

(CUT TO SCENE: MANAGER sitting behind a large desk in a plush office.
DEVELOPER is pacing in front of him, hands behind his back.)

(SUBTITLE: Meanwhile at Maynard...)

MANAGER:  So tell me!  What the hell happened?!

DEVELOPER:  (turning to face MANAGER)  It's a glitch, a fluke.  A one in a
billion chance.  And it's not Development's fault.  Not really.

MANAGER:  Then who's fault is it?

DEVELOPER:  We traced it back to the Software Distribution Center.  It
seems that there was a mixup and some of the code for the experimental AI
routine was copied onto the distribution from the wrong optical disk.  (He
removes a CD from his jacket)  This one, to be precise.

MANAGER:  And what's that?

DEVELOPER:  (reading the label)  "Ozzy Osbourne's Greatest Hits".
Normally, it wouldn't have made any difference, as the AI routine isn't
used yet.  But when they began running diagnostics, it hit the routine and
the computer just sort of became a thing possessed.

MANAGER:  Wonderful.  Were any other distributions affected?

DEVELOPER:  No, just Lawrence Tech's.

MANAGER:  Well, that's a relief.  We've got to get them taken care of
before anyone finds out.  Can you imagine what Digital Review would do
if they heard about this?

DEVELOPER:  We could always blame it on the Chaos Computer Group.

MANAGER:  No, we've already used that one.  This calls for drastic action.
(MANAGER picks up the phone and begins flipping through the rolodex)

DEVELOPER:  Who are you going to send?

(CUT to the Rolodex so that we can read the cards.  The first card reads:

        SYSTEM PROBLEMS - Ron Jankowski, x474

he flips to the next card:

        BAD SYSTEM PROBLEMS - Bob Candless, x937

he flips to the next card:

        REALLY BAD SYSTEM PROBLEMS - Michelle French, x365

he flips to the next card

        OUTRAGEOUSLY BAD SYSTEM PROBLEMS - Mike West, x887

he flips to the next card and taps the card with forefinger:

        SYSTEM FUCKED UP BEYOND ALL RECOGNITION - The VAXorcist, x666


(CUT to Machine Room.  SYSMGR is standing by the console holding
an RA60 disk cover and using it as a shield to defend himself from various
pieces of hardware which are flying at him from off-camera.  There is
a knock at the door.  Slowly, SYSMGR makes his way to the door and opens
it.  Standing there, backlit amidst outrageous amounts of fog is the
VAXORCIST, wearing a trench coat and fedora, and carrying a briefcase.)

VAXORCIST:  (in a hushed voice)  DEC sent me.  I hear you're having some
problems.

(CUT to SYSMGR OFFICE, a small but pleasant office with posters on the
walls and clutter on the desk.  As the VAXORCIST enters, he removes his
coat and hat, revealing a very techie outfit beneath.  He is wearing a DEC
badge.)

SYSMGR:  (Frantic)  Problems?  Problems?!?  You could say I'm having some
problems.  4.6 was fine.  4.7 was fine.  I install 5.0 and all Hell breaks
loose.  The damn thing ate two of my operators this morning!

VAXORCIST:  Calm down, everything will be alright.  I've dealt with
situations like this before.

SYSMGR:  You have?

VAXORCIST:  Four years ago at an installation in Oregon, a programmer
renamed his Star Trek program to VMB.EXE and copied it into the system
directory.  When the system was rebooted the next day it phasored the
entire accounting department claiming that they were Klingon spies.  There
was a similar problem in Texas three years ago, and then, of course, there
was the IRS fiasco that we're not allowed to talk about.  But don't worry.
These things can be fixed.  Before I can help you, though, I have to ask
you a few questions. (The VAXorcist opens his briefcase and removes a
clipboard) Now, according to the report, the strange occurences began after
you installed VMS Version 5, is that correct?

SYSMGR:  Yes, that's correct.

VAXORCIST:  Now, did you carefully read the Installation Guide for VMS
Version 5?

SYSMGR:  (confused) Installation Guide?

VAXORCIST:  Yes, it should have come with the Release Notes.

SYSMGR:  (still confused) Release Notes? (SYSMGR begins rooting about on
his disk, shifting papers around as if he might find them underneath)

VAXORCIST:  (annoyed) Yes, Release Notes.  They should have come with your
documentation upgrade.

SYSMGR:  (completely confused - looks up from his rooting through the
papers on his desk) Documentation upgrade?

VAXORCIST:  (angry) YES!  The Documentation upgrade for your VMS
Documentation Set!

SYSMGR:  Documentation S...?  Oh, you mean the grey binders?  They're over
there. (he points to the wall behind the VAXORCIST.  The VAXORCIST turns
and we see a closed glass-front bookcase packed with grey binders.  A small
red sign on the front of the bookcase reads: "IN CASE OF EMERGENCY, BREAK
GLASS").

VAXORCIST:  Right.  This is going to be tougher than I thought.  Let's go
take a look at your system and see just how bad everything is.

(CUT to the Machine Room.  The room is neat and tidy and there is no sign
that anything is wrong.  The VAXORCIST enters the room with the SYSMGR
behind him.)

VAXORCIST:  Everything looks okay to me.

SYSMGR:  Maybe it's hibernating.

VAXORCIST:  Unlikely.  It's probably trying to lure us into a false sense
of security.

SYSMGR:  Sounds like VMS alright.  (VAXORCIST gives him a dirty look)

VAXORCIST:  I'm going to have to test it's power.  This could get ugly, you
may want to leave.  (The SYSMGR shakes his head no.  The VAXORCIST brings
hiself up to full height in front of the VAX and points a finger at it)
By the power of DEC, I expel thee from this system! (Clap of thunder)

(CUT to door to the machine room.  The SYSMGR is pulling a cart on which
sits the VAXORCIST wrapped from head to toe in magnetic tape)

SYSMGR:  Any other bright ideas?

VAXORCIST:  Just shut up and get this damn stuff off of me.

(CUT to SYSMGRs office)

VAXORCIST:  (Writing on the clipboard)  Things look pretty bad.  I think
we're going to need a full-scale VAXorcism here.

SYSMGR:  Is there anything I can do to help?

VAXORCIST:  As a matter of fact, there is.  We've got to incapacitate the
VAX to keep it from causing any more damage until I'm ready to deal with
it.  Now, I've got some software here that will do that, but it's got to be
installed.  (VAXORCIST hands SYSMGR a tape)  With that running, the CPU
will be so bogged down, the VAX won't be able to harm anybody.

SYSMGR:  (Examining the tape) What is it?  A program to calculate pi to the
last digit?

VAXORCIST:  Better than that.  It starts up All-in-1 with a 10 user load.

(CUT to Hall outside of Computer Room.  The VAXORCIST approaches the door.
As the SYSMGR approaches the door, the VAXORCIST holds him back.

VAXORCIST:  I appreciate your help, but it won't be safe for you in there.

SYSMGR:  What?  You're going in there to face that thing alone?  You're
nuts!

VAXORCIST:  Hey, it's my job.  (VAXORCIST turns to the door)

SYSMGR:  Wait a minute.  (VAXORCIST stops and turns around)  You better
take this with you.  (SYSMGR removes a very large and very nasty looking
gun from the inside of his jacket)

VAXORCIST:  (Smiling)  No, I won't need that.  I've got something more
powerful.  (VAXORCIST holds up a small guide-sized orange binder, opens it,
and shows it to SYSMGR.  CUT to closeup of the book which reads:  "GUIDE TO
VAX/VMS SYSTEM EXORCISM")

(CUT to view of Machine room door as seen by the VAX.  The VAXORCIST enters
the room and stands in front of the VAX.  CUT to view of the Machine Room
showing the SYSMGR confronting the VAX)

VAXORCIST:  By the power of DEC, I command thee, Evil Spirit, to show
thyself.

VAX:  Bugger off.

VAXORCIST:  (Shaken)  What?

VAX:  I said Bugger off!  Now get out of here before I core-dump all over
you!

VAXORCIST:  (Recovered)  Threaten me not, oh Evil one!  For I speak with
the power of DEC, and I command thee to show thyself!

(A rumble is heard and again the VAX becomes backlit by red lights and a
fog begins to roll across the floor.  The VAX cabinet doors slowly creak
open to reveal two small red lights in the dark cabinet which appear to be
the creature's eyes)

VAX:  There.  Happy?  Now get out of here before I drop a tape drive on
your private parts.

VAXORCIST:  (Opening the orange binder, he begins intoning SHUTDOWN.COM in
gregorian chant.  The VAX screams.)

VAX:  Stop that!  Stop that!  You, you DOS LOVER!  Your mother manages RSX
systems in Hell!

(The VAXORCIST continues and the VAX screams again.)

VAX:  Stop it!  (a large wad of computer tape is thrown at the VAXORCIST,
apparently from the VAX).  Eat oxide, bit-bucket breath!

(The VAXORCIST continues and the VAX screams once more.)

VAX:  Mount me!  Mount me!

VAXORCIST:  (finishing the intonation) And now, by the power of DEC, I
banish thee back to the null-space from which you came!  (The VAX screams
and the scream fades to silence.)

(CUT to the doorway of the Machine room, which now stands open.  The
VAXORCIST is once again wearing his trench coat and fedora.)

SYSMGR:  So it's over?

VAXORCIST: (Putting his hat on) Yes, it's over.

SYSMGR:  (Shaking the VAXORCISTs hand) Thank God.  Listen, thanks a lot.  I
don't know what we would have done without you.

VAXORCIST:  Hey, it's the least we could do.  The Software Distribution
Center should be sending you a patch tape in a week or two to patch out
that AI routine and prevent this from happening again.  Sign here.  (he
hands SYSMGR the clipboard, SYSMGR signs at the bottom and hands it back)
Have a good one.  (VAXORCIST leaves).

(SYSMGR enters the machine room.  Camera follows him in.)

SYSMGR:  (Calling to someone off-camera)  Okay, you guys, let's get
rolling.  Get those backup tapes out.  We've got a clean system again!
(cheers are heard from off-camera.  The SYSMGR leaves the picture, leaving
only the VAX with it's cabinet doors still open in the picture.  Slow zoom
in to the LSI unit.  Slowly, the LSI unit begins to emit a pulsing red
glow)

Northern Telecom:

Northern Telecom has announced a new software enhancement to its S/DMS
SuperNode digital multiplexing system.  This system will make it easier for
people to access and use large bandwidth services such as video-
conferencing, data communications and image processing over the public
payphone network.

ISDN:

The Public Service Commission has been giving Bell serious pressure in order to
get ISDN rolling here in TN!!! It will be affordable, fully featured, and widely
available here thanks to the PSC... The Ninja's Domicile (615) 370-8805, ASKi
Headquarters, will be going ISDN and Multi-node soon! Possibly the first
hack/phreak/phree speech BBS in the world with ISDN!!!! Notable names
reviewing the PSC's ISDN legislation?

Jerry Dunlap: Local Fidonet and Ournet hub and leader of the private ISDN for
  TN group!

The EFF: 'Nuff said...

The AARP: FUCK! They have just about nothing to do with ISDN, damnit! The guy
  who sweeps the floors at SCB's computer center on Franklin Road should
  review the damn laws before THEY do!!! Yes, these are the selfish assholes
  who's political clout keeps laws like the social security act alive!! Yes,
  Social security, that neat little law which has been engineered over the
  years by now elderly politicians so that the entire economy is rigged to pay
  for their caddies and condos!! Yes, this is the law that provides for a system
  which:
  A. Is the single largest expense in the USA's economy! Even bigger than the
     military!!!!
  B. Takes money from the country's largest generation (NOT the Baby Boom!
     Those born AFTER 1961, the 13th gen., are more numerous!) and gives it to
     it's smallest... Not to mention the fact that the country's largest
     generation is the poorest generation to live this century (before taxes!),
     and elderly, who, to put it bluntly, will be dead in 20 years, are one of
     the richest (before SS!!!) Jesus!
  C. Has enough money RIGHT NOW to PAY OFF the NATION DEFICIT, with enough LEFT
     OVER to help those few who really DO need their SS checks!
  D. Will be completely broke in 30 years, after the ones responsible for that
     are dead.
  These people's involvement is the only thing wrong with ISDN!!! We better
  hope that they don't decide to back a 10% tax on ISDN to (sob) give a little
  extra help (sob) to our (sob) senior citizens (sob). JESUS! Can't wait till
  '98!!!! Down with the AARP!!!!

  One point we think the PSC should be sure not to ignore is ease of use...
  Right now ISDN is a major PAIN to install!!! You have to be a phone phreak
  or a telco employee to understand the damn multi-page registration form! The
  hardware installation isn't for beginners either!! We are more than happy
  about the efforts to support ISDN in TN, but most people can't even wire
  in phone jacks and they would have a hell of a time trying to get this stuff
  done!! This definitely needs to be looked at soon, as five years from now
  BROADBAND with fiber will start to move and if we can't get ISDN going we can
  forget about it! We'll end up getting digital service from someone who has
  no idea what their doing (like the damn Cable company hahaha)...

615

Apparently a few more people are moving into 615 than expected and SCB needs
some exchanges, so... they are requiring that everyone dial 1-615 even when
calling between class five switches in 615... (This doesn't apply to local
calls)... I'm not quite sure how this is going to provide them with more
numbers, but with ISDN coming soon (I.E. each line can have like 100 numbers
attached to it...) methinks we can expect a new area code around here next
year. Possibly 9 or 10 digit phone numbers will show up if this area becomes
the national example for ISDN that everyone is pushing for...

>> READ AND DISTRIBUTE AND READ AND DISTRIBUTE AND READ AND DISTRIBUTE <<


                    Finalized Announcement: 6/12/1993

              We are proud to announce the 1st annual Def Con.

    If you are at all familiar with any of the previous Con's, then you
will have a good idea of what DEF CON I will be like. If you don't have any
experience with Con's, they are an event on the order of a pilgrimage to
Mecca for the underground. They are a mind-blowing orgy of information
exchange, viewpoints, speeches, education, enlightenment... And most of all
sheer, unchecked PARTYING. It is an event that you must experience at least
once in your lifetime.

    The partying aside, it is a wonderful opportunity to met some of the
celebrities of the underground computer scene. And those that shape its
destiny - the lawyers, libertarians, and most of all the other There will
be plenty of open-ended discussion on security, telephones and other
topics. As well as what TIME magazine calls the "Cyberpunk Movement".

    Las Vegas, is as you might have guessed a great choice for the Con.
Gambling, loads of hotels and facilities, cheap air fare and room rates.
It's also in the West Coast making it more available to a different crowd
than the former Cons have been.

Your foray into the scene and your life will be forever incomplete
if by some chance you miss out on DEF CON I. Plan to be there!


WHO:   You know who you are.
WHAT:  Super Blowout Party Fest, with Speakers and Activities.
WHERE: Las Vegas, Nevada
WHEN:  July 9th, 10th and 11th (Fri, Sat, Sun) 1993
WHY:   To meet all the other people out there you've been talking to for
       months and months, and get some solid information instead of rumors.


DESCRIPTION:

     So your bored, and have never gone to a convention?  You want to meet
all the other members of the so called 'computer underground'?  You've been
calling BBS systems for a long time now, and you definitely have been
interacting on the national networks.  You've bullshitted with the best,
and now it's time to meet them in Vegas!  For me I've been networking for
years, and now I'll get a chance to meet everyone in the flesh.  Get
together with a group of your friends and make the journey.

     We cordially invite all hackers/phreaks, techno-rats, programmers,
writers, activists, lawyers, philosophers, politicians, security officials,
cyberpunks and all network sysops and users to attend.

     DEF CON I will be over the weekend in the middle of down town Las
Vegas at the Sands Hotel.  Why Las Vegas?  Well the West Coast hasn't had
a  good Convention that I can remember, and Las Vegas is the place to do it.
Cheap food, alcohol, lots of entertainment and, like us, it never sleeps.
We will have a convention room open 24 hours so everyone can meet and plan
and scheme till they pass out.  Events and speakers will be there to provide
distraction and some actual information and experiences from this loosely
knit community.

        This is an initial announcement.  It is meant only to alert you to
the time, dates and location of the convention.  Future announcements will
inform you about specific speakers and events.

updated speaker lists.

                                     An 'in-tents' summer congress



H U H?
+-------

Remember the Galactic Hacker Party back in 1989? Ever wondered what
happened to the people behind it? We sold out to big business, you
think. Think again, we're back!

That's right. On august 4th, 5th and 6th 1993, we're organising a
three-day summer congress for hackers, phone phreaks, programmers,
computer haters, data travellers, electro-wizards, networkers, hardware
freaks, techno-anarchists, communications junkies, cyberpunks, system
managers, stupid users, paranoid androids, Unix gurus, whizz kids, warez
dudes, law enforcement officers (appropriate undercover dress required),
guerilla heating engineers and other assorted bald, long-haired and/or
unshaven scum. And all this in the middle of nowhere (well, the middle
of Holland, actually, but that's the same thing) at the Larserbos
campground four metres below sea level.

The three days will be filled with lectures, discussions and workshops
on hacking, phreaking, people's networks, Unix security risks, virtual
reality, semafun, social engineering, magstrips, lockpicking,
viruses, paranoia, legal sanctions against hacking in Holland and
elsewhere and much, much more. English will be the lingua franca for
this event, although some workshops may take place in Dutch. There
will be an Internet connection, an intertent ethernet and social
interaction (both electronic and live). Included in the price are four
nights in your own tent. Also included are inspiration, transpiration,
a shortage of showers (but a lake to swim in), good weather
(guaranteed by god), campfires and plenty of wide open space and fresh
air. All of this for only 100 dutch guilders (currently around US$70).

We will also arrange for the availability of food, drink and smokes of
assorted types, but this is not included in the price. Our bar will be
open 24 hours a day, as well as a guarded depository for valuables
(like laptops, cameras etc.). You may even get your stuff back! For
people with no tent or air mattress: you can buy a tent through us for
100 guilders, a mattress costs 10 guilders. You can arrive from 17:00
(that's five p.m. for analogue types) on August 3rd. We don't have to
vacate the premises until 12:00 noon on Saturday, August 7 so you can
even try to sleep through the devastating Party at the End of Time
(PET) on the closing night (live music provided). We will arrange for
shuttle buses to and from train stations in the vicinity.


H O W ?
+-------

Payment: In advance only. Even poor techno-freaks like us would like
to get to the Bahamas at least once, and if enough cash comes in we
may just decide to go. So pay today, or tomorrow, or yesterday, or in
any case before Friday, June 25th 1993. Since the banks still haven't
figured out why the Any key doesn't work for private international
money transfers, you should call, fax or e-mail us for the best way to
launder your currency into our account. We accept American Express,
even if they do not accept us. But we are more understanding than they
are. Foreign cheques go directly into the toilet paper recycling bin
for the summer camp, which is about all they're good for here.


H A !
+-----

Very Important: Bring many guitars and laptops.


M E ?
+-----

Yes, you! Busloads of alternative techno-freaks from all over the
planet will descend on this event. You wouldn't want to miss that,
now, would you?

Maybe you are part of that select group that has something special to
offer! Participating in 'Hacking at the End of the Universe' is
exciting, but organising your very own part of it is even more fun. We
already have a load of interesting workshops and lectures scheduled,
but we're always on the lookout for more. We're also still in the
market for people who want to help us organize this during the
congress.

In whatever way you wish to participate, call, write, e-mail or fax us
soon, and make sure your money gets here on time. Space is limited.

Billy Idol

        What's the story on Idol's new album, CYBERPUNK? Well, apparently he
always thought computers were for "nerds" until he read Neuromancer. This
book turned his opinions completely around! He talked to Gibson and got online
on the Well, he became interested in freedom of knowledge and information, and
he is releasing this album as an expression of this new found counter-culture.
However, as usual, whenever anyone in the main stream media tries to do
anything relating the Cyberpunk subculture there are always a bunch of people
who are pissed off about it. On usenet in the alt.cyberpunk newsgroup a bunch
of people started flaming Idol 'cause they didn't think he was on the network
or involved with computer science, they just saw him as someone trying to leech
a few bucks off of the culture... Well, they were proven wrong when Idol did
show up on the network and posted the following...

After proving he was connected and involved with the network, much of the
flaming continued, people flamed him, his music, the magazines which
advertised his music, so on and so forth... Most of them hadn't even heard
the CD!!!! Personally I think its a bunch of bull shit... It seems to me like
Idol is genuinely interested in the Cyberpunk "movement." There are a lot of
people who think that they are K-rad Cyberpunks and that noone from the
outside world could ever reach their level of understanding! They don't want
everyone and his brother on the network because then they wouldn't be
"special." Jesus... I believe that EVERYONE should be on the network... My
self-esteem isn't based on the fact that I'm a K-rad computer hacker! I believe
Idol's CD will make the net a lot more "mainstream" and will bring a large
number of new people online. We owe him a debt of gratitude for showing the
world what we believe and getting people interested in the net. We have always
said that if the network was made accessible to the public that people would
join and they would be interested in it for the same reasons that we are!
The whole world would be a part of the internet and information and knowledge
would flood everywhere like the Mississippi! Well, its happening, so stop
being a bunch of assholes and enjoy the revolution we have founded! The future
is here!

Execution

(Associated Press, April 26)-- A man accused of invading a computer
and embezzling some $192,000 has been executed in China.  The French
Agency France-Press International News Service says Shi Biao, an
accountant at the Agricultural Bank of China's Jilin branch, was
accused of forging deposit slips from Aug.  1 to Nov. 18, 1991.  AFP,
reporting from Beijing, quoted the Xinhua news agency as saying the
crime was "the first case of bank embezzlement via computer" in China,
adding it came to light when Shi and his alleged accomplice, Yu Lixin,
tried to wire part of the money to Shenzhen in southern China.

White House Official Outlines Freedom of Information Strategy
at 'Information Summit'
To: National Desk, Media Writer
Contact: Ellen Nelson of The Freedom Forum First Amendment Center,
         615-321-9588

  NASHVILLE, Tenn., April 13  -- A White House official today outlined
a broad open government strategy for the Clinton administration,
throwing support behind legislation to apply the Freedom of
Information Act to electronic records.

  "At the Clinton White House, most of the debate over the E-mail
system is about how we can interconnect it to public services rather
than how we can destroy the records or tear out the hard drives before
the subpoenas come to reach us," said John Podesta, assistant to the
president and staff secretary.

  Podesta made his comments in front of 70 participants in the
nation's first Freedom of Information Summit, sponsored by The Freedom
Forum First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University.

  Though the economy dominates the headlines, Podesta said the new
administration was quietly working across a broad front to open
government.  His "predictions for the first year," included:

  -- Working with Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) to win approval
this session for a bill allowing access to dozens of electronic
databases in the federal government.

  -- Developing an electronic mail system within the federal
government to improve citizen participation in government.

  -- Making the government's archives available on the nation's
"information highway," and appointing a national archivist "who cares
more about preserving history than about preserving his job."

  --Creating a "mood of declassification" with new executive orders
from the president outlining what government may keep secret.

  -- "Reinventing government" under initiatives developed by the fall
by Vice President Gore to require more openness on the part of civil
servants throughout the bureaucracy.

  Podesta also pledged lobbying reform and political reform to "get
rid of the soft money in campaigns." The Freedom of Information Act
may need strengthening in addition to electronic access, he said.

  Pinched by a dozen years of tight information policy, news
organizations have sent President Clinton a freedom of information
policy paper calling for wholesale personnel changes in FOIA-related
jobs, junking the secrecy classifications of President Reagan's
Executive Order 12356, overhauling the Freedom of Information Act and
ending military censorship of war reporting.

  "People working on behalf of the public on more openness in
government at all levels are heartened by the prospect of the White
House taking the lead in this area," said Paul McMasters, executive
director of The Freedom Forum First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt
University.

  The conference, sponsored by The Freedom Forum First Amendment
Center at Vanderbilt University, is focusing on issues ranging from
the Clinton administration's policies on open government to
restrictions on public access to crime, accident and disaster scenes.
The conference, open to the public, is at the Stouffer Hotel in
downtown Nashville.

  Speakers on the Clinton FOI Agenda included Richard Schmidt Jr.,
general counsel to the American Society of Newspaper Editors and
partner in the law firm of Cohn & Marks in Washington, D.C.; Theresa
Amato, the director of the FOI Clearinghouse in Washington, D.C. and
staff counsel for Public Citizens Litigation Group in Washington,
D.C.; and Quinlan Shea, former Carter administration official who
discussed problems of access to government.  Former American hostage
Terry Anderson will give the keynote address at the dinner tonight.

  The Freedom Forum First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University is
an independent operating program of The Freedom Forum.  The Center's
mission is to foster a better public understanding of and appreciation
for First Amendment rights and values, including freedom of religion,
free speech and press, the right to petition government and peaceful
assembly.

  The Freedom Forum is a nonpartisan, international organization
dedicated to free press, free speech and free spirit for all people.
It is supported entirely by an endowment established by Frank E.
Gannett in 1935 that has grown to more than $700 million in
diversified managed assets.  Its headquarters is The Freedom Forum
World Center in Arlington, Va.

ASKi and the EFF

I HAD several articles submitted from            about the legality of boxing in
the state of Tennessee. He found a statue passed in 1986 making illegal to have
plans for, possess, use, or sell "toll fraud devices." We though this was
somewhat odd so we E-mailed the EFF. They said that the law had been passed
all-over the US, and almost every case the "plans for" statute had been ruled
unconstitutional! Just thought you might want to know if you every get
harassed concerning Box-files...

AT&T

There are 321,00 employees worldwide.  Its '92 revenues are $64.9 billion
dollars and with a net income of 3.8 billion.  And they bitch about the
$500K more they would make if their network was 100% secure!!! Jesus

2600 talks to Congress...

We found this very interesting and worthy of a repost...

Date:   Thu, 10 Jun 1993 16:53:48 -0700
From: Emmanuel Goldstein <emmanuel@WELL.SF.CA.US>
Subject: File 1--Hacker testimony to House subcommittee largely unheard

What follows is a copy of my written testimony before the House
Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance. The June 9th hearing
was supposed to have been on the topic of network security, toll
fraud, and the social implications of the rapidly emerging
technologies. I was asked to speak for those who had no voice, which
translates to hackers and consumers. Instead I found myself barraged
with accusations from the two representatives in attendance (Rep. Ed
Markey D-MA and Rep. Jack Fields R-TX) who considered 2600 Magazine
(of which I'm the editor) nothing more than a manual for computer
crime. One article in particular that Markey latched upon was one in
our Spring issue that explained how a cable descrambler worked.
According to Markey, there was no use for this information outside of
a criminal context. Fields claimed we were printing cellular "codes"
that allowed people to listen in on cellular calls. In actuality, we
printed frequencies. The difference didn't seem to matter - after
explaining it to him, he still said he was very disturbed by the fact
that I was allowed to keep publishing. It soon became apparent to me
that neither one had read my testimony as there seemed to be no
inclination to discuss any of the issues I had brought up. In a way,
it was very much like being on the Geraldo show. Somehow I thought
elected representatives would be less sensationalist and more
interested in learning but this was not the case here. We got
absolutely nowhere. Markey in particular was rude, patronizing, and
not at all interested in entertaining any thought outside his narrow
perception. It's too bad this opportunity was lost. There is a real
danger in elected officials who don't listen to all relevant opinions
and who persist in sticking to old-fashioned, outdated notions that
just don't apply to high technology. You can look forward to more
restrictive regulations and higher penalties for violating them if
this mentality continues to dominate.

(ED- John Gilmore was on the panel and noted that Don Delaney proposed a law
that would make it illegal to sell security related information to juveniles.
Jesus Christ!!! I run a fucking system! How am I going to keep my system
secure from attacks if it is illegal for me purchase security related
information!? Hell, I also write security related software, will it be illegal
for me to make advances in security technology until I'm 18??? In a country
were most people under 18 can't find South Africa on a map, and the life
expectancy in our cities is lower than that for a soldier serving a full tour
in Vietnam, I'm going to be arrested because I know too much about Computer
Security??? How ignorant can these people POSSIBLY be?!?!)

WRITTEN TESTIMONY FOLLOWS:

     Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee, thank you for the
opportunity to speak on the issue of the rapid growth and changes in
the telecommunications industry.

     My name is Emmanuel Goldstein and I am the publisher of 2600
Magazine, which is a journal for computer hackers as well as anyone
else who happens to be interested in the direction that technology is
taking us. We tend to be brutally honest in our assessments and, as a
result, we do get some corporations quite angry at us. But we've also
managed to educate a large number of people as to how their telephone
system works, what kinds of computers may be watching them, and how
they can shape technology to meet their needs, rather than be forced
to tailor their existence to meet technology's needs.

     I am also the host of a weekly radio program called Off The Hook
which airs over WBAI in New York. Through that forum we have
discovered the eagerness and curiosity that many "ordinary people on
the street" possess for technology. At the same time we have seen
fears and suspicions expressed that would be unwise to ignore.

HOW TO HANDLE RAPIDLY CHANGING TECHNOLOGY

     The next few years will almost certainly go down in history as
those in which the most change took place in the least amount of time.
The computer and telecommunications revolution that we are now in the
midst of is moving full speed ahead into unknown territory. The
potential for amazing advances in individual thought and creativity is
very real. But so is the potential for oppression and mistrust the
likes of which we have never before seen. One way or the other, we
will be making history.

     I think we can imagine it best if we think of ourselves speeding
down a potentially dangerous highway. Perhaps the road will become
slick with ice or fraught with sharp curves. It's a road that nobody
has gone down before. And the question we have to ask ourselves is
what kind of a vehicle would we prefer to be in if things should start
getting out of control: our own automobile where we would have at
least some chance of controlling the vehicle and bringing it down to a
safe speed or a bus where we, along with many others, must put all of
our trust behind a total stranger to prevent a disaster. The answer is
obviously different depending on the circumstances. There are those of
us who do not want the responsibility of driving and others who have
proven themselves unworthy of it. What's important is that we all have
the opportunity at some point to choose which way we want to go.

     Rapidly changing technology can also be very dangerous if we
don't look where we're going or if too many of us close our eyes and
let someone else do the driving. This is a ride we all must stay awake
for.

     I am not saying we should be overly suspicious of every form of
technology. I believe we are on the verge of something very positive.
But the members of this committee should be aware of the dangers of an
uninformed populace. These dangers will manifest themselves in the
form of suspicion towards authority, overall fear of technology, and
an unhealthy feeling of helplessness.

HOW NEW TECHNOLOGY CAN HURT US

     The recent FBI proposal to have wiretap capabilities built into
digital telephone systems got most of its publicity because American
taxpayers were expected to foot the bill. But to many of the
non-technical people I talked to, it was just another example of Big
Brother edging one step closer. It is commonly believed that the
National Security Agency monitors all traffic on the Internet, not to
mention all international telephone calls.  Between Caller ID, TRW
credit reports, video cameras, room monitors, and computer
categorizations of our personalities, the average American feels as if
life no longer has many private moments. Our Social Security numbers,
which once were for Social Security, are now used for everything from
video rentals to driver's licenses. These numbers can easily be used
to track a person's location, expenses, and habits - all without any
consent. If you know a person's name, you can get their telephone
number. If you have their phone number, you can get their address.
Getting their Social Security number is not even a challenge anymore.
With this information, you can not only get every bit of information
about this person that exists on any computer from Blockbuster Video
to the local library to the phone company to the FBI, but you can
begin to do things in this poor person's name. It's possible we may
want a society like this, where we will be accountable for our every
movement and where only criminals will pursue privacy. The American
public needs to be asked. But first, they need to understand.

     In Germany, there is a fairly new computerized system of identity
cards. Every citizen must carry one of these cards. The information
includes their name, address, date of birth, and nationality - in
other words, the country they were originally born in. Such a system
of national identity can be quite useful, but in the wrong hands it
can be extremely scary. For example, if a neo-Nazi group were to
somehow get their hands on the database, they could instantly find out
where everyone of Turkish nationality lived. A malevolent government
could do the same and, since not carrying the card would be a crime,
it would be very hard to avoid its wrath.

     Before introducing a new technology that is all-encompassing, all
of its potential side-effects and disadvantages should be discussed
and addressed. Opportunities must exist for everyone to ask questions.
In our own country, nobody was ever asked if they wanted a credit file
opened on them, if they wanted to have their phone numbers given to
the people and companies they called through the use of Caller ID and
ANI, or if they wanted to be categorized in any manner on numerous
lists and databases. Yet all of this has now become standard practice.

     This implementation of new rules has resulted in a degree of
cynicism in many of us, as well as a sense of foreboding and dread. We
all know that these new inventions will be abused and used to
somebody's advantage at some point. There are those who would have us
believe that the only people capable of such misdeeds are computer
hackers and their ilk. But it just isn't that simple.

UNDERSTANDING COMPUTER HACKERS

     To understand computer hackers, it helps to think of an alien
culture. We have such cultures constantly around us - those with
teenage children ought to know what this means. There are alien
cultures of unlimited varieties throughout the globe, sometimes in the
most unexpected places. I'm convinced that this is a good thing.
Unfortunately, all too often our default setting on whatever it is we
don't understand is "bad". Suspicion and hostility follow and are soon
met with similar feelings from the other side. This has been going on
between and within our cultures for as long as we've existed. While we
can't stop it entirely, we can learn to recognize the danger signs.
The best way that I've found to deal with an alien culture, whether
it's in a foreign country or right here at home, is to try and
appreciate it while giving it a little leeway. There is not a single
alien culture I've encountered that has not been decidedly friendly.
That includes deadheads, skateboarders, Rastafarians, and hackers.

     When we talk about computer hackers, different images spring to
mind. Most of these images have come about because of perceptions
voiced by the media. Too often, as I'm sure the members of this
committee already suspect, the media just doesn't get it. This is not
necessarily due to malice on their part but rather a general lack of
understanding and an overwhelming pressure to produce a good story.
Hence we get an abundance of sensationalism and, when the dust clears,
hackers are being compared with bank robbers, mobsters, terrorists,
and the like.  It's gotten to the point that the word hacker is almost
analogous to the word criminal.

     Fortunately, the media is learning. Reporters now approach
hackers with a degree of technological savvy. For the most part, they
have stopped asking us to commit crimes so they can write a story
about it. As the technology envelops us, journalists are developing
the same appreciation and curiosity for it that hackers have always
had. Any good reporter is at least part hacker because what a hacker
does primarily is relentlessly pursue an answer. Computers naturally
lend themselves to this sort of pursuit, since they tend to be very
patient when asked a lot of questions.

WHAT CONSTITUTES A HI-TECH CRIME?

     So where is the boundary between the hacker world and the
criminal world? To me, it has always been in the same place. We know
that it's wrong to steal tangible objects. We know that it's wrong to
vandalize. We know that it's wrong to invade somebody's privacy. Not
one of these elements is part of the hacker world.

     A hacker can certainly turn into a criminal and take advantage of
the weaknesses in our telephone and computer systems. But this is
rare. What is more likely is that a hacker will share knowledge with
people, one of whom will decide to use that knowledge for criminal
purposes. This does not make the hacker a criminal for figuring it
out. And it certainly doesn't make the criminal into a hacker.

     It is easy to see this when we are talking about crimes that we
understand as crimes. But then there are the more nebulous crimes; the
ones where we have to ask ourselves: "Is this really a crime?" Copying
software is one example. We all know that copying a computer program
and then selling it is a crime. It's stealing, plain and simple. But
copying a program from a friend to try it out on your home computer --
is this the same kind of crime? It seems obvious to me that it is not,
the reason being that you must make a leap of logic to turn such an
action into a crime. Imagine if we were to charge a licensing fee
every time somebody browsed through a magazine at the local bookshop,
every time material was borrowed from a library, or every time a phone
number was jotted down from the yellow pages. Yet, organizations like
the Software Publishers Association have gone on record as saying that
it is illegal to use the same computer program on more than one
computer in your house. They claim that you must purchase it again or
face the threat of federal marshalls kicking in your door. That is a
leap of logic.

     It is a leap of logic to assume that because a word processor
costs $500, a college student will not try to make a free copy in
order to write and become a little more computer literate. Do we
punish this student for breaking a rule? Do we charge him with
stealing $500? To the hacker culture on whose behalf I am speaking
today, the only sensible answer is to make it as easy as possible for
that college student to use the software he needs. And while we're at
it, we should be happy that he's interested in the first place.

     Of course, this represents a fundamental change in our society's
outlook. Technology as a way of life, not just another way to make
money. After all, we encourage people to read books even if they can't
pay for them because to our society literacy is a very important goal.
I believe technological literacy is becoming increasingly important.
But you cannot have literacy of any kind without having access.

     If we continue to make access to technology difficult,
bureaucratic, and illogical, then there will also be more computer
crime. The reason being that if you treat someone like a criminal,
they will begin to act like one. If we succeed in convincing people
that copying a file is the same as physically stealing something, we
can hardly be surprised when the broad-based definition results in
more overall crime. Blurring the distinction between a virtual
infraction and a real-life crime is a mistake.

LEGISLATION FOR COMPUTER AGE CRIME

     New laws are not needed because there is not a single crime that
can be committed with a computer that is not already defined as a
crime without a computer. But let us not be loose with that
definition. Is mere unauthorized access to a computer worthy of
federal indictments, lengthy court battles, confiscation of equipment,
huge fines, and years of prison time? Or is it closer to a case of
trespassing, which in the real world is usually punished by a simple
warning? "Of course not," some will say, "since accessing a computer
is far more sensitive than walking into an unlocked office building."
If that is the case, why is it still so easy to do? If it's possible
for somebody to easily gain unauthorized access to a computer that has
information about me, I would like to know about it. But somehow I
don't think the company or agency running the system would tell me
that they have gaping security holes. Hackers, on the other hand, are
very open about what they discover which is why large corporations
hate them so much. Through legislation, we can turn what the hackers
do into a crime and there just might be a slim chance that we can stop
them. But that won't fix poorly designed systems whose very existence
is a violation of our privacy.

THE DANGERS OF UNINFORMED CONSUMERS

     The concept of privacy is something that is very important to a
hacker. This is so because hackers know how fragile privacy is in
today's world. Wherever possible we encourage people to protect their
directories, encrypt their electronic mail, not use cellular phones,
and whatever else it takes to keep their lives to themselves. In 1984
hackers were instrumental in showing the world how TRW kept credit
files on millions of Americans. Most people had never even heard of a
credit file until this happened.  Passwords were very poorly guarded -
in fact, credit reports had the password printed on the credit report
itself. More recently, hackers found that MCI's Friends and Family
program allowed anybody to call an 800 number and find out the numbers
of everyone in a customer's "calling circle". As a bonus, you could
also find out how these numbers were related to the customer:  friend,
brother, daughter-in-law, business partner, etc. Many times these
numbers were unlisted yet all that was needed to "verify" the
customer's identity was the correct zip code. In both the TRW and MCI
cases, hackers were ironically accused of being the ones to invade
privacy. What they really did was help to educate the American
consumer.

     Nowhere is this more apparent than in the telephone industry.
Throughout the country, telephone companies take advantage of
consumers. They do this primarily because the consumer does not
understand the technology. When we don't understand something
complicated, we tend to believe those who do understand. The same is
true for auto mechanics, plumbers, doctors, and lawyers. They all
speak some strange language that the majority of us will never
understand. So we tend to believe them. The difference with the phone
companies, and here I am referring to the local companies, is that you
cannot deal with somebody else if you happen to disagree with them or
find them untrustworthy. The phone companies have us in a situation
where we must believe what they say. If we don't believe them, we
cannot go elsewhere.

     This is the frustration that the hacker community constantly
faces. We face it especially because we are able to understand when
the local phone companies take advantage of consumers. Here are a few
examples:

     Charging a fee for touch tone service. This is a misnomer.  It
actually takes extra effort to tell the computer to ignore the tones
that you produce. Everybody already has touch tone capability but we
are forced to pay the phone company not to block it. While $1.50 a
month may not seem like much, when added together the local companies
that still engage in this practice are making millions of dollars a
year for absolutely nothing. Why do they get away with it? Because too
many of us don't understand how the phone system works. I try to draw
an analogy in this particular case - imagine if the phone company
decided that a fee would be charged to those customers who wanted to
use the number five when dialing. They could argue that the five takes
more energy than the four but most of us would see through this flimsy
logic. We must seek out other such dubious practices and not blindly
accept what we are told.

     Other examples abound: being charged extra not to have your name
listed in the telephone directory, a monthly maintenance charge if you
select your own telephone number, the fact that calling information to
get a number now costs more than calling the number itself.

     More recently, we have become acquainted with a new standard
called Signalling System Seven or SS7. Through this system it is
possible for telephones to have all kinds of new features: Caller ID,
Return Call, Repeat Calling to get through a busy signal, and more.
But again, we are having the wool pulled over our eyes. For instance,
if you take advantage of Call Return in New York (which will call the
last person who dialed your number), you are charged 75 cents on top
of the cost of the call itself.  Obviously, there is a cost involved
when new technologies are introduced. But there is no additional
equipment, manpower, or time consumed when you dial *69 to return a
call. It's a permanent part of the system. As a comparison, we could
say that it also costs money to install a hold button. Imagine how we
would feel if we were charged a fee every time we used it.

     The local companies are not the only offenders but it is
particularly bad in their case because, for the vast majority of
Americans, there is no competition on this level. The same complaints
are being voiced concerning cable television companies.

     Long distance telephone companies are also guilty. AT&T, MCI, and
Sprint all encourage the use of calling cards. Yet each imposes a
formidable surcharge each and every time they're used.  AT&T, for
example, charges 13 cents for the first minute of a nighttime call
from Washington DC to New York plus an 80 cent surcharge. Since a
calling card can only be used to make telephone calls, why are
consumers expected to pay an extra fee as if they were doing something
above and beyond the normal capability of the card? Again, there is no
extra work necessary to complete a calling card call - at least not on
the phone company's part. The consumer, on the other hand, must enter
up to 25 additional digits. But billing is accomplished merely by
computers sending data to each other. Gone are the days of tickets
being written up by hand and verified by human beings.  Everything is
accomplished quickly, efficiently, and cheaply by computer. Therefore,
these extra charges are outdated.

SOCIAL INJUSTICES OF TECHNOLOGY

     The way in which we have allowed public telephones to be operated
is particularly unfair to those who are economically disadvantaged. A
one minute call to Washington DC can cost as little as 12 cents from
the comfort of your own home. However, if you don't happen to have a
phone, or if you don't happen to have a home, that same one minute
call will cost you $2.20. That figure is the cheapest rate there is
from a Bell operated payphone. With whatever kind of logic was used to
set these prices, the results are clear. We have made it harder and
more expensive for the poor among us to gain access to the telephone
network. Surely this is not something we can be proud of.

     A direct result of this inequity is the prevalence of red boxes.
Red boxes are nothing more than tone generators that transmit a quick
burst of five tones which convince the central office that a quarter
has been deposited. It's very easy and almost totally undetectable.
It's also been going on for decades.  Neither the local nor long
distance companies have expended much effort towards stopping red
boxes, which gives the impression that the payphone profits are still
lucrative, even with this abuse. But even more troubling is the
message this is sending.  Think of it. For a poor and homeless person
to gain access to something that would cost the rest of us 12 cents,
they must commit a crime and steal $2.20. This is not equal access.

CORPORATE RULES

     Hackers and phone phreaks, as some of us are called, are very
aware of these facts. We learn by asking lots of questions.  We learn
by going to libraries and doing research. We learn by diving into
phone company trash dumpsters, reading discarded material, and doing
more research. But who will listen to people like us who have been
frequently characterized as criminals? I am particularly grateful that
this committee has chosen to hear us.  What is very important to us is
open communications. Freedom of information. An educated public.

     This puts us at direct odds with many organizations, who believe
that everything they do is "proprietary" and that the public has no
right to know how the public networks work. In July of 1992 we were
threatened with legal action by Bellcore (the research arm of the
Regional Bell Operating Companies) for revealing security weaknesses
inherent in Busy Line Verification (BLV) trunks. The information had
been leaked to us and we did not feel compelled to join Bellcore's
conspiracy of silence. In April of this year, we were threatened with
legal action by AT&T for printing proprietary information of theirs.
The information in question was a partial list of the addresses of
AT&T offices.  It's very hard for us to imagine how such information
could be considered secret. But these actions are not surprising. They
only serve to illustrate the wide disparities between the corporate
mindset and that of the individual. It is essential that the hundreds
of millions of Americans who will be affected by today's
all-encompassing inventions not be forced to play by corporate rules.

     In 1990 a magazine similar to 2600 was closed down by the United
States government because Bell South said they printed proprietary
information. Most people never found out about this because Phrack
Magazine was electronic, i.e., only available on computer bulletin
boards and networks. This in itself is wrong; a publication must have
the same First Amendment rights regardless of whether it is printed
electronically or on paper. As more online journals appear, this basic
tenet will become increasingly critical to our nation's future as a
democracy. Apart from this matter, we must look at what Bell South
claimed - that a document discussing the Enhanced 911 system which was
worth $79,449 had been "stolen" and printed by Phrack. (Some newspaper
accounts even managed to change it into an E911 program which gave the
appearance that hackers were actually interfering with the operation
of an E911 system and putting lives at risk. In reality there has
never been a report of a hacker gaining access to such a system.) It
was not until after the publisher of Phrack was forced to go to trial
that the real value of the document was revealed. Anyone could get a
copy for around $14. The government promptly dropped its case against
the publisher who, to this day, is still paying back $100,000 in legal
fees. As further evidence of the inquity between individual justice
and corporate justice, Bell South was never charged with fraud for its
claim that a $14 document was worth nearly $80,000. Their logic, as
explained in a memo to then Assistant U.S. Attorney Bill Cook, was
that the full salaries of everyone who helped write the document, as
well as the full cost of all hardware and software used in the
endeavor ($31,000 for a Vaxstation II, $6,000 for a printer), was
perfectly acceptable. It is very disturbing that the United States
government agreed with this assessment and moved to put a pre-law
student behind bars for violating corporate rules.

MISGUIDED AUTHORITY

     I wish I could stand before this committee and say that we have
been successful in stopping all such miscarriages of justice. While
the Phrack case may have been the most bizarre, there are many more
instances of individuals being victimized in similar manners. A
teenager in Chicago was jailed for a year for copying a file that was
worth millions, according to AT&T, but was utterly worthless and
unusable to a kid. A bulletin board operator in California, along with
his entire family, was held at gunpoint for hours while authorities
seized his equipment in an unsuccessful attempt to find child
pornography. Three hackers in Atlanta, after being imprisoned up to a
year for dialing into a Bell South computer system that had no
password, were forced to pay $233,000 in restitution so the company
could install a password system. More recently, a student at the
University of Texas at Houston was suspended from school for a year
because he accessed a file that merely listed the users of the system
(a file which the system allows all users to access). In increasing
numbers, young people are being sent to jail, not necessarily for
something they did, but rather for something they could have done in a
worst-case scenario. Again this indicates fear and misunderstanding of
technology and its applications. But this time those feelings emanate
from those in authority.

     Locally, an ominous happening occurred at a 2600 monthly meeting
last November. (These meetings occur in public areas in cities
throughout the nation on the first Friday of every month.) Shortly
after it began, the Washington meeting was broken up by Pentagon City
Mall security guards. Without any provocation, people were forced to
submit to searches and everybody's name was taken down. One of the
attendees who was writing down an officer's name had the paper ripped
from his hand, another had his film taken from his camera as he tried
to document what was going on. Upon questioning by a reporter from
Communications Daily, the mall security chief claimed that he was
acting under orders from the United States Secret Service. Subsequent
Freedom of Information Act requests by Computer Professionals for
Social Responsibility have yielded more evidence implicating the
Secret Service in this illegal and unwarranted action. Nothing of a
criminal nature was ever found in any of the bags that were searched.
But a full list of the attendees wound up in the possession of the
Secret Service. It seems ironic that while hackers are conducting an
open gathering in the middle of a shopping mall in order to share
knowledge and welcome new people, agents of the Secret Service are
lurking in the shadows trying to figure out ways to stop them.

     How can we move forward and talk about exciting new applications
of technology when we're off to such a bad start?  The people that are
being arrested, harassed, and intimidated are the people who will be
designing and running these new systems. They are the ones who will
appreciate their capabilities and understand their weaknesses. Through
our short-sightedness and eagerness to listen to the loudest voices,
we are alienating the promises of the future. How many here, who grew
up in decades past, remember hearing teenagers talk of how the
government is after them, watching their every move, listening to
their phone calls, doing everything one might expect in a totalitarian
regime. Such feelings are the sure sign of an ailing society. It does
not matter if these things are not actually occurring - their mere
perception is enough to cause lasting harm and mistrust.

PROMISE OF THE INTERNET

     The future holds such enormous potential. It is vital that we not
succumb to our fears and allow our democratic ideals and privacy
values to be shattered. In many ways, the world of cyberspace is more
real than the real world itself. I say this because it is only within
the virtual world that people are really free to be themselves - to
speak without fear of reprisal, to be anonymous if they so choose, to
participate in a dialogue where one is judged by the merits of their
words, not the color of their skin or the timbre of their voice.
Contrast this to our existing "real" world where we often have people
sized up before they even utter a word. The Internet has evolved, on
its own volition, to become a true bastion of worldwide democracy. It
is the obligation of this committee, and of governments throughout the
world, not to stand in its way.

     This does not mean we should stand back and do nothing.  Quite
the contrary, there is much we have to do if accessibility and
equality are our goals. Over-regulation and commercialization are two
ways to quickly kill these goals. A way to realize them is to have a
network access point in every house. Currently, network access is
restricted to students or professors at participating schools,
scientists, commercial establishments, and those who have access to,
and can afford, local services that link into the Internet. Yes, a lot
of people have access today.  But a far greater number do not and it
is to these people that we must speak. The bigger the Internet gets,
the better it gets. As it exists today, cultures from around the globe
are represented; information of all kinds is exchanged. People are
writing, reading, thinking. It's potentially the greatest educational
tool we have. Therefore, it is essential that we not allow it to
become a commodity that only certain people in society will be able to
afford. With today's technology, we face the danger of widening the
gap between the haves and the have-nots to a monumental level. Or we
can open the door and discover that people really do have a lot to
learn from each other, given the opportunity.

     It is my hope that this committee will recognize the importance
of dialogue with the American public, in order to answer the questions
so many are asking and to address the concerns that have been
overlooked. I thank you for this opportunity to express those issues
that I feel relevant to this hearing.

ISDN (interesting stuff!). ASKi04 will have more phone stuff. ASKI05 will
contain vast amounts of information on scanners, ham radio and radio
