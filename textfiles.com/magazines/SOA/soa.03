-- The blood of the innocent on the hands of the guilty --

Getting on with the news and away from the recently stupid post on r.m.c.
(I'd like to thank the individual who posted that idiotic piece of junk..
we have something to talk about on my radio show Saturday night! Thanx
dude, we needed new material and this one's GOOOOOD!)...


The rumors are NOT true! King's X is NOT leaving their label, Atlantic,
nor is Atlantic dropping them.. it IS true, however, that King's X and
their longtime producer, Sam Taylor, have parted ways..

Oz Fox has reportedly left or will be leaving Stryper by the end of the
month, thus ensuring the band's demise... the end of an era for Christian
metal but the beginning of another one with new bands (and heavier ones,
thank God!) taking the mantle...

Die Happy will have a new album out in January, entitled "Volume II", and
expect that same brutal grunge/thrash as was found in their previous album
"Die Happy".. also coming out with new albums are Deliverance and
Tourniquet, both coming out with live studio releases in February.. there
has, however, been no word as to the release of any newer Sacred Warrior
material..

Godsent Humans are signed to New Breed Records (a division of FMG like
Intense Records) and their new album, "Liberty or Death", is due out in
January.. expect "gothic thrash"... hmm...

According to insiders, Recon has gone the direction of Seattle grunge a la
Applehead-meets-ragman, a complete departure from their old progressive
metal a la Queensyrche days..

Tickets for Cornerstone '93 are now on sale, though there has been no
official word as to who would be playing.. rumors lean toward Tourniquet,
Die Happy, Bride, Ordained Fate and Mortification... there is also a hot
rumor that Believer might be there!

Whitecross will be playing at PowerHouse in Euless TX (in the Dallas/Ft.
Worth area) on Friday, Dec. 11... also playing on Dec. 11 will be Amariah
and Recluse Chant, 2 local bands in the DC area (RC is being courted by 2
major labels, one of which is blonde but I won't say anything more!).. The
Brave will be in concert on Fri-Sat. Dec. 18-19 at the PowerHouse.. 

Redemption will reform at the end of this month when guitarist Scott
Hunstad returns to South Dakota from school in NY.. they are also talking
about recording a demo around New Year's.. they are a 5-piece power/brutal
metal band from SD...

New Year's Eve will be fun city in Fredericksburg VA at the Colonial
Theater when Recluse Chant, Crown of Thorns, M.I.A. (featuring ex-Taker
and ex-Armageddon guitarist P.J. Bussey) and others take the stage for an
all-evening musical assault to ring in the Year of Brutality: 1993..

They wore their Holy Soldier dog tags to the Persian Gulf in 1991, will
they be wearing them in Somalia? Write them and encourage them anyway!

Deathless is currently in the studio working on a new demo to be out early
'93.. they are a 5-piece speed metal band from Puerto Rico who recently
replaced their bassist...

Magdallan's Ken Tamplin's mug IS the mug you see on billboards in Los
Angeles! His likeness is used as an advertisement for a new music section
of the L.A. Times.. the other Magdallan dude, Lanny Cordola, has a new
solo album out, "of Riffs and Symphonies", featuring Greg and Matt
Bissonnette (David Lee Roth), soul/R&B singer Jon Gibson and House of
Lords singer James Christian..

globalWAVEsystem (betcha I didn't get this right anyway) will be releasing
their total hardcore industrial release on Blonde Vinyl in January.. look
for more posts from gWs members including cE!... they also promise a
harder-edge industrial release than new indies on the block - Under
Midnight, who wowed them at Cornerstone '92 along with new hardcore act
Three Nails...

** End of SOAE **

Stay Brutal or Die (or post stupid nonsense making Christians look stupid
and worthy of people blasting them in alt.thrash - so GET REAL!)

Phil

PS: Next SOAE look for some info on a bunch of new grunge acts from
Seattle on a tiny independent label (Household Gawd? Hmmm..)
