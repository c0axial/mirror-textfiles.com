** Soae **
  2/25/93

Well, folks, you can now send me mail.. my mailer works once again after
some bad file lunched it big time... I'd like to personally know why.

And on a real happy note: Screams of Abel (the real zine) #1 will be out
in March! Despite the fact that we have no front cover, back cover or an
available laser scanner until the publisher returns from Chicago.. 

** The News **

Well, here we go again.. a few weeks ago I posted about news I heard from
sources saying that SACRED WARRIOR broke up, however, finding out that the
band is indeed together and that they have a new bassist, formerly of the
band KEEPER.. well, here's Pt. 2! After a recent conversation last weekend
with Roger Martinez, VENGEANCE RISING has officially broken up!! Roger let
myself and Dave Kindervater of This Prophecy Magazine know that VR has
called it quits and that he's going into a new band that will be more
Seattle grunge-rock.. more details as they crop up (like who breaks up
next week! ARGH!)

Also in the news, the GALACTIC COWBOYS have announced their official split
with producer Sam Taylor, following KING'S X from last fall.. the Cowboys'
new album, "Space In Your Face", will be out April 13 on DGC Records..

On a MUCH happier note, San Diego death metallers RITUAL are getting a new
producer for their next demo due to complaints about the production on
"Crematorium of the Deceased".. they have also obtained their old bass
player back and a new guitarist, making them a 5-piece now, and their new
material "destroys their old stuff"...

New bands on the scene include a lot of death metal bands from around the
world! OBLATION is a new death band from Texas while CORPSE is a new death
band from Kentucky.. finally FLESHWALKER is a new (duh!) death metal band
from Australia working on their debut demo to be out in March.. 

DISCARNATED's debut release on CD will be out in March as well and can be
pre-ordered by writing and getting info from their band publicist Shade
at: Discarnated, c/o Shade, 16 Cumming St., Blackwood SA 5051 Australia..

Atlanta brutallers FINAL JUDGEMENT will have their debut album,
"Desolating Sacrilege", this spring on Anastasia Records (which will be
distributed in the Christian markets by R.E.X. Records).. bassist Todd
Davis informed me that their new sound will be early Slayer mixed with
"tribal drum rhythms"..

CATHERINE SPEED is a new brutal/weird band from Florida that features a
female vocalist/bassist named Jennifer.. the music is described as a cross
between Cannibal Corpse and White Zombie.. weird...

** Cornerstone '93 Update **

Some recent additions have been made to the Cornerstone '93 lineup! Aside
from BRIDE, GUARDIAN and REZ, there will be more heavy bands, according to
JPUSA/Cornerstone organizer Henry Huang, "a Metal Cornerstone"!!! Expect
to see BELIEVER, THE CRUCIFIED, TOURNIQUET, MORTIFICATION and just added..
DELIVERANCE and LIVING SACRIFICE... and also on the smaller stages expect
to see CONSECRATOR, DROP DEAD, FINAL JUDGEMENT, THE RISEN, PRECIOUS DEATH
and REDEMPTION.. Virginia progressive speedsters RECLUSE CHANT are also
planning to be there as well..

So, if you don't go, unless you can't afford it, you're a poser! Ok, I'll
be nice, you MIGHT be a poser!

** MARCH 3rd.. BELIEVER, "Dimensions" (although no word from REX) **

Speaking of LIVING SACRIFICE, it has been brought to my attention that
their new material is far heavier than even their latest album
"Nonexistent", in fact, DJ, bassist/vocalist, informed me that their
guitars and songs are now tuned down to B and his vocals are far lower,
along the lines of Morgoth/Suffocation.. also at Cornerstone '93 they will
have Rick Taylor, vocalist of THE RISEN, doing a duet with DJ on some
Living Sacrifice earlier songs including "No Grave Concern", on stage.. DJ
is also planning to fill in on the bass position current vacant in The
Risen at the Fest.. also, according to CIRCLE OF DUST and BRAINCHILD
frontman Scott Albert, a Living Sacrifice/Circle of Dust/Brainchild maxi
single will be available later this spring mixed and produced by Albert..

BRIDE will be in concert tomorrow (2/26) at Grace Church outside of
Fredericksburg VA, and Sat 2/27 at Potomac State College in Keyser WV..
local Virginia metal band CROWN OF THORNS will open for Bride at the
Fredericksburg show..

Scott Hunstad of REDEMPTION, when not with his band in South Dakota cuz
he's at RPI in NY, jams with another band called MORNING STAR that is hard
rock/metal sound.. Redemption will be recording their first demo later
this year and Jon Reich of Redemption let me know that it's along the
lines of HOLY SOLDIER..

Kyle David of SCARLET RAYNE has formed a new band, a funk/metal project
called SOULSCAPE.. they are still based in Wisconsin..

And finally, Delaware grunge/metal band RAGMAN has been making the
underground news! Lead singer Eric Hutts has recently obtained
distribution rights through major secular record companies and has formed
his own small label, Alphabet Records.. they also finally have a full
lineup and are planning some shows near Philadelphia in the near future..
