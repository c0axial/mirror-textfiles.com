  FirstText: How the Other Half Writes    by Jason Snell
========================================================

  I've been working in this world of "on-line" computers for a 
  long time, relatively speaking. In the early '80s, before the 
  movie _WarGames_ made a whole generation of moviegoers wonder if 
  computer hackers with modems could destroy the world (or their 
  credit rating), I was the proud owner of a 300 baud modem 
  attached to a Commodore Pet computer. About all I could do with 
  it was call CompuServe (which cost an arm and a leg, even then) 
  and connect to the billing system of the local hospital. Trying 
  to hack into that system had its appeal, but after a few weeks I 
  grew bored and the modem went back into the box.

  After I saw _WarGames_, I pulled out the modem and started 
  trying to use it again. This time I began connecting to the 
  world of local computer bulletin boards--one local (run by my 
  best friend), a few long-distance. In high school, I ran my own 
  bulletin board on an Apple //e computer. And in college, I 
  became interested in the Internet. Then, in 1990, _InterText_ 
  was born.

  I've made a lot of good friends--and uncountable casual 
  acquaintances--over the years, here in this otherworld of 
  computer communication. Most of them, both the good friends and 
  casual acquaintances, were males. _Of course_, you say to 
  yourself, _because most of the people on-line are men and boys._

  It's true. In all the time I've been on-line, the ratio of men 
  to women has been more or less what I'd expect it is in Alaska: 
  maybe 9:1, if you're lucky. The most common reason I hear for 
  this disparity (women _are_ slightly over half the population, 
  you know) is that women aren't as interested in computers. Why 
  _that's_ the case is open to question--some would say that 
  women are discouraged from scientific and technically-oriented 
  subjects from the time they're born. Others would say it's just 
  a natural difference.

  Maybe using computers as communication would turn off women who 
  prefer intimate, person-to-person interaction. (Though if they 
  knew what sort of conversations happen to people on-line, 
  perhaps they would think twice about the quality of "computer 
  talk.")

  Whatever the reason, a fact's a fact. Women are in short supply 
  when it comes to the on-line world--though things are 
  changing, slowly. (There are plenty more women around these days 
  than in the old days...)

  I'm sorry to say that for most of _InterText's_ life, we've been 
  part of this disparity. During our first three volumes, only 
  four of the 46 writers we've had have been women. This issue, 
  however, half of our stories--a full three of six--are by 
  women, including our cover story, "Home," by Ellen Brenner.

  No, 1994 hasn't brought a mandated gender quota to the pages of 
  _InterText_. It just so happens that of the stories we chose for 
  this issue, half happened to be by women. There are no promises 
  that such a thing will happen again next issue--for all I 
  know, 42 of our next 46 writers will be men.

  But I'd like to think that this issue is part of a trend--for 
  both _InterText_ and the Net in general. Women writers aren't 
  any better or worse than men, really--that's a terrible 
  generalization to make. But if I must generalize, I'll do it in 
  saying this: women writers offer a different perspective. It's 
  good to have them represented in these pages.



  On a radically different subject, I thought I'd mention that as 
  1994 opens, I begin a new chapter in my life. In addition to 
  editing _InterText_ and putting the final touches on my graduate 
  journalism degree at UC Berkeley, I am now an assistant editor 
  at _MacUser_ magazine. It'll be a busy few months, but hopefully 
  I'll be able to balance work, school, _InterText,_ and my home 
  life.

  What does this mean for _InterText?_ Probably nothing, really, 
  though the address subscribers receive this magazine from may 
  change as I gain Internet access at work. But Geoff Duncan and I 
  hope to bring you _InterText_ into the foreseeable future, just 
  as we've been doing for the past three years.

  And on that note--a sentence which foreshadows the fact that 
  our next regular issue (Vol. 4, No. 2) will mark our third 
  anniversary--I wish you good reading.

  Enjoy the issue.

  Mumford
---------

  I awake from a night made restless by my usual stew of 
  fragmented dreams to an early morning full of fog and the 
  effortless song of birds. Some people hate foggy days, but I 
  adore them. There's something about the acoustics of fog that 
  make bird-song, and all outdoor sounds, more intimate--held 
  close by all that opacity instead of flying away into the 
  unobstructed air. One tends to notice things like that when one 
  is held as still as I am.

  I lie there awhile, enjoying the birds and the patch of sky I 
  can see through the window without moving. I'm not quite ready 
  yet for the ordeal of getting my outlandish body out of bed. In 
  some ways this is the hardest part of my day. Not that any part 
  of my day is exactly easy, but every morning tempts me with the 
  appeal of just staying in bed and evading all my little daily 
  struggles. I do love life enough, despite my problems, that 
  getting up wins out most of the time. There is, however, that 
  occasional morning when I go ahead and let temptation win. And I 
  don't feel any too guilty about it either--even though every 
  single time I do stay in, someone inevitably comes looking for 
  me, worried that I've had one of my mishaps.

  That's life in small-town New England for you, everyone minding 
  your business as well as their own, especially when one happens 
  to stick out like the proverbial sore thumb. Heh. But I don't 
  mind. In fact I find it rather comforting because, truth to 
  tell, I really do just barely manage on my own. I mean, I try 
  not to make a habit of falling down or getting stuck somewhere 
  or otherwise getting myself in a fix, but it has been known to 
  happen, and it's not a whit less terrifying to me each time it 
  does. It's really only the confidence that somebody _will_ come 
  looking for me that allows me to go about my doings with any 
  semblance of serenity. So I bless every one of those beloved 
  busybodies, even the ones who would make me laugh out loud if I 
  were capable of it.

  Despite the hangover from my bad dreams, this is not a day from 
  which I really desire to play hooky. So I steel myself and 
  commence with the maneuvers required to get me off my stomach 
  and onto my feet. Glasses next--the usual moment of frustrated 
  groping, wondering if I have undone myself by putting them 
  someplace dumb, until finally my hand connects with them and I 
  nearly explode with relief. Like most visually impaired people 
  I'm perforce a creature of habit, so my glasses are nearly 
  always on the dresser where they're supposed to be. Well I 
  remember, though, one particularly ghastly morning that I simply 
  could not find them anywhere. Eventually Millie came looking for 
  me when I was an hour late for work, to find me nearly in 
  hysterics, having spent that hour methodically feeling every 
  horizontal surface in the house without success. Why I didn't 
  just break down and call her, I'll never know; I can get 
  pigheaded sometimes. We never did find that pair of glasses, 
  incidentally-- it's still a mystery where they went. Joel made 
  me another set that very day, while Millie sat with me the whole 
  time, reassuring me that I was not being a silly ninny for 
  having worked myself into such a state. I just love Millie. And 
  Joel, too, of course.

  Glasses found and strapped on so that I can at least somewhat 
  see where I'm going--now into the shower, and on with my robe. 
  My cane and my vocoder are right by the door where I usually 
  leave them, thank God. I grab the cane, sling the vocoder's 
  carrying strap over my shoulder, and carefully head out the 
  door.

  The village of Mumford is a tiny thing. The business district, 
  such as it is, comprises six blocks worth of Main Street. Its 
  storefronts maintain a balance between the utilitarian and the 
  picturesque: Joel's True Value and Rodding's Feed & Grain 
  coexist with Millie's rambling bookstore and a gaggle of antique 
  emporia. The cross streets are lined with wood frame houses 
  under elderly maples. Most of the structures are plain little 
  cottages, but a sprinkling are grand Victorian wedding cakes 
  festooned with verandas and cupolas, though their grandeur is 
  nearly all broken into flats these days. I live in one of the 
  plain cottages, though a room in one of the wedding-cakes would 
  have been more aesthetically pleasing. I just couldn't have 
  borne facing all those diabolical steps every single day.

  The fog has nearly all burned off by now. I make my slow 
  progression down the block to Main Street.

  "Hey! Pole!" a cheerful voice greets me just as I round the 
  corner. Since I can neither speak nor turn my head nor 
  acknowledge a greeting in any other normal way, I simply come to 
  a halt and wait until the person accosting me swims into my 
  field of vision.

  Of course I've already recognized the voice long before I set 
  eyes on the fellow. It's Crandell, one of my "biggest fans," as 
  I often joke to Millie--one of those people who seem especially 
  to enjoy my company because I offer the least resistance to 
  their desire to talk. Crandell's a dear, and mostly harmless, 
  but the volume of his outpourings never matches the import of 
  their content, so I don't even bother to power up my vocoder 
  (just as well--it's a real chore to walk and type at the same 
  time). I proceed on my slow way once he's caught up to me, and 
  let him blather on at my side, reflecting yet again on how I'm 
  saved from constant social disgrace by my inability to laugh out 
  loud.

  Thankfully, he has no business he can think of in the bookstore, 
  so he leaves me in peace at the entrance, heading off to the 
  cafe in search of more victims to harangue. The bell jingles and 
  the comforting book-smell wafts out at me as I negotiate my way 
  through the door, and Millie yells a hello from somewhere in the 
  back. This is my real home, even more so than the cottage that 
  serves as my domicile. Here I feel enfolded and supported; here 
  I can more than hold my own.

  Millie comes over and leans convivially over the top of my 
  computer hutch as I get myself settled. I can see her out of one 
  of the mirror-lenses of my glasses; she's giving me her 
  "concerned mother" look. "You seem a little tired," she 
  observes. "Didn't you sleep okay?"

  I have the vocoder on at this point, and stop to type in my 
  reply. The voice that flows out of the little notebook-sized 
  machine lacks something in inflection and nuance, but it is more 
  natural-sounding and beautiful than I ever would have expected 
  of a bunch of microchips. Emory worked really hard to get it 
  that way--one reason why he is another one of the people I love.

  "Frankly, no," I type. "I had another one of my patented nights 
  of surrealistic dreams. Definitely fueled by this upcoming 
  interview foolishness--at one point there was a bright green 
  lizard in a pink business suit shoving a microphone in my face, 
  asking how it felt to go through life with a pole up my butt."

  "You know you can always back out of it," says Millie. She's now 
  making her endearingly wry face--lips compressed, eyebrows up 
  into her bangs, head cocked to one side. She's forty-five, an 
  independent divorcee, and this bookstore is her baby of ten 
  years. She moved from Boston to this village just to birth it. 
  She takes great pride in being considered almost a local now 
  after a mere decade's residence.

  "Just because my unconscious is throwing temper tantrums does 
  not mean I don't want to go through with it," I type back. "And 
  it's hardly as if it's my first time. Though I sure hope it gets 
  easier with repetition. Hang on a bit."

  I have to stop typing because I need my hands free to carefully 
  lower myself into my chair. Another one of Joel's handyman fixes 
  for the peculiarities of my body. With Millie's blessing, he cut 
  a circular hole in the floor just in front of my computer 
  workstation, and affixed a cushioned bench equipped with sturdy 
  armrests above it. The bench has a slot cut into its seat, 
  perfectly aligned with the floor hole. This arrangement provides 
  me one of the few places in the world where I can sit on a chair 
  like a normal human being, for which I'm profoundly grateful. 
  But actually getting myself into that seat requires a few tricky 
  moves, to get that pole of mine properly inserted into that hole 
  and slot.

  Yes. A pole. Really.

  It's nearly impossible to explain myself to anyone who has not 
  yet heard the tale, without sooner or later hitting something so 
  ludicrous that the hearer bursts into laughter, insisting he or 
  she is being put on--it's a joke, right? Nothing so ridiculous 
  could ever exist. Hell, I _live_ with it, and _I_ often want to 
  laugh--when I don't feel like screaming, that is. (I wish I 
  could do either.) Even my unconscious seems to find it funny--"a 
  pole up my butt" indeed.

  But that's exactly what I have. Not just up my butt, but clear 
  through my body. About four inches in diameter, about six and a 
  half feet long, straight as the proverbial ramrod, made of an 
  amazingly hard organic material that has been shown by analysis 
  to be at least somewhat related to normal human cartilage; 
  spitting me clean through the long axis of my body so that it 
  issues from my mouth at one end and my anus at the other, 
  completely occluding thereby my throat, my esophagus, large 
  portions of my GI tract--

  Totally revolted yet? Nobody can figure out how this could have 
  happened, and nobody can say how it is that I am alive. The 
  scientific types have unhelpfully concluded that, technically 
  speaking, I'm _not_ really alive--not, at least, in any regular 
  sense of that word. I don't breathe, nor take in nourishment, 
  nor seem to especially need either. And a good thing too, as I 
  couldn't have managed either in the normal way; and thinking 
  about how I would have handled elimination only invites more of 
  the nervous laughter my predicament breeds like toadstools.

  Suffice it to say that I do keep functioning, sustained by some 
  mechanism and energy that cannot be determined by the white coat 
  brigade. They've poked and they've prodded, they've taken 
  pictures and scans and God knows what else, and all they come up 
  with is a great big nothing. A mystery of science and a prisoner 
  of absurdity, sibling to Kafka's cockroach but with nowhere near 
  the dignity or pathos--heh. That's what I am.

  Living or not, I have to put up with some pretty gruesome 
  realities. That unforgiving pole rules my body, forcing it into 
  a painfully undeviating alignment. My head it jams back at a 
  grotesque angle; my face it crams into a eternal gaping grimace. 
  My eyes wind up permanently fixed upon a spot on the ceiling 
  behind me--in other words, I am functionally as good as blind. 
  The upper end of the pole juts out a good eight inches before my 
  face, just long enough to make it a challenge to go through 
  doorways without fetching it a teeth- rattling whack. The nether 
  end extends to about two inches above my ankles, so that I can 
  walk, however awkwardly; but if the ground is any less that 
  perfectly flat I get completely tangled. Stairs become an 
  obstacle course. Sitting is completely out of the question, 
  except through Joel's exotic arrangements. And now you see why 
  lying down, or more accurately getting up from lying down, is 
  such a production. What else? I've already mentioned I can't 
  speak, can't make any kind of sound; I can barely move 
  either--it's astonishing how much one's range of movement is 
  limited if one's torso is rendered completely rigid.

  Is this horrifying enough? How about the fact that they can't 
  remove it? Turns out it's sensate, an integral part of my body. 
  It has the weirdest sensitivity to knocks and pings, like a huge 
  exposed funny-bone, as I've discovered to my agony from the 
  thousands of times I've smashed one end or the other against 
  something. Some bright-eyed whitecoat tried digging at it early 
  on, and I went into such deep shock that the whole brigade 
  feared for a bit that they had lost me--not that I felt they had 
  any qualms about my well-being, mind you, but they surely didn't 
  relish the embarrassment of killing such a promising subject 
  before they'd figured out how he was alive.

  Oh, and how about the fact that I have no more idea of where I 
  come from than anybody else? I have no memory at all of my life 
  prior to that night three years ago when I woke up-- naked, 
  disoriented, transfixed--in the woods outside Mumford, and dear 
  old Janeen Colver, seeing some strange commotion out in her back 
  woodlot, threw a coat over her nightgown and went out with a 
  flashlight to investigate.

  It was pretty easy to determine that I was not from Mumford. But 
  so far, I don't seem to be from anywhere else, either. My 
  fingerprints have been sent around the world and have produced 
  no match. Nobody has come forward with as much as a 
  missing-persons report. My traces of memory would seem to point 
  to the life of a typical middle-class American--but I must have 
  been a loner, and too nondescript to have had my fingerprints 
  recorded anywhere. I might as well have been dropped from the 
  sky--punted out of the heavens by a renegade deity with a 
  particularly sadistic sense of humor.

  I found myself a man without a past, and with the most laughable 
  excuse for a present, and with a future that would have been 
  very grim indeed, had I not been adopted by the inimitable 
  residents of Mumford. Dedicated eccentrics all, closely bound 
  and yet self-reliant, they felt an instant, unanimous pang of 
  compassion for this changeling that Fate had dropped into their 
  backyard. Without a moment's hesitation, they took me into their 
  hearts.

  A moment I shall never forget: caught in Janeen's flashlight 
  beam, unable to see whether I had found friend or foe, vainly 
  clutching at my distended silenced throat as this unseen other 
  swore under her breath in astonishment; and then her 
  surprisingly strong arm around my shoulders, her gruff voice in 
  my ear: "Lord bless you, son, I think you've been run through 
  with a--well, I don't know what--but just you take it easy and 
  lean on me, my house is just a few yards away."

  And then lying there in a daze across her big old four-poster, 
  shivering hard against this unyielding spear through my flesh, 
  listening to Janeen on the phone to old Dr. Harvey: "Harv, you 
  better come on out here. I've just found this young man in my 
  woods and he... well, I don't think I can do it justice, but 
  it's the closest thing you've ever seen to a feller swallowing a 
  telephone pole... I'm sorry, Harv, I can't explain it any better 
  than that... Well, then I suppose you'll just have to get out of 
  bed and come see the poor feller for yourself, then, won't you?"

  And then the strange procession of days that followed, in which, 
  by degrees, the entire cast of characters in this little family 
  theater called Mumford passed through Janeen's house, come to 
  see this poor stranger to whom such a dreadful thing had 
  happened--some wise, some foolish, some sensitive and some less 
  so, but all uniformly possessed of the most astonishing sense of 
  empathy. _Empathy?_ How could one possibly empathize with 
  something so bizarre? But that's the only word for it. Maybe 
  after years of living together in a small town, sharing each 
  other's tragedies and coping with each other's foibles, the 
  spectacle of this man with something like a telephone pole 
  through his body was not all that much stranger to them than 
  their own existences. Just another poor devil with his 
  particular cross to bear. Or so they seemed to be taking it.

  Further, since I had materialized in their woods, they as one 
  assumed that I was now their responsibility, and my predicament 
  their task to alleviate. They took me in hand with 
  characteristic country ingenuity. It was Janeen who first 
  noticed my vision problem and called in Joel, who took some wire 
  and some convex mirrors and rigged up the first, rough edition 
  of my now ever-present "glasses." Joel, in turn, called in 
  Emory, his nephew with the "fancy-pants technical-institute 
  degree," who turned an obsolete notebook computer and some 
  off-the-shelf voice-synthesis chips into a serviceable vocoder 
  in an afternoon. And Janeen herself, pragmatically realizing 
  that trousers were out of the question for me, sewed up some 
  warm flannel into a kind of loose-fitting caftan-like robe. 
  She's made my clothes ever since.

  But it was Millie who did me the most beneficial service of all, 
  if the least tangible. She sat by my side as I discovered 
  (rediscovered?) my voice, talking me down from my initial shock 
  into some semblance of sanity. How I remember lying there, 
  typing on that little makeshift vocoder, venting all my anguish 
  at this reality into which I'd been thrown: adrift in a freak's 
  body, with no memory of who I was, and no name except that 
  ghastly epithet "the telephone- pole man." "Well, then, what do 
  you want to be called?" I remember her asking me. "I don't 
  know," I typed back, and then I couldn't type any more because I 
  was crying too hard to see. And she held my hand and stroked my 
  head until I stopped crying, and we talked no more about my name 
  that day. By the time I was in any state to think clearly about 
  a name the nickname "Pole" had grown up around me and I simply 
  accepted it. Somehow the sting had gone out of it by then, 
  because the people who had planted that handle on me were no 
  longer strangers.

  Meanwhile, Dr. Harvey--after many persistent attempts to 
  persuade various specialists they were not being handed a 
  hoax--finally convinced some big-name city doctor to come down 
  and look at me, and suddenly I was in a whole new kind of 
  trouble. I was now up to my eyebrows in authorities, and under 
  their callous ministrations I began to get in touch with the 
  destiny of a freak. That was the period in which I nearly died 
  from some damned fool of a specialist trying to take a sample 
  from my "chondralloplasia," as they were pleased to call it. 
  With no name and no concerned next-of-kin to fight for me, I was 
  terrified I was about to be hauled off to some sort of dismal 
  facility, where I would be the subject of endless research 
  papers and most likely never see the light of day again.

  But I reckoned without the good people of Mumford, who got their 
  dander up at this treatment of their ward. Harv, chagrined at 
  what he had unleashed, talked to the town elders, and they 
  called a town meeting, and the town voted that the specialists 
  couldn't have me. Bang. Just like that. New England town meeting 
  style at its best. I have another indelible memory, this of a 
  scene somewhere on the edge of farce, played out in Janeen's 
  front parlor. All the specialists on one side, nervously perched 
  on Janeen's old horsehair settee in their proper conservative 
  suits; all the town elders on the other side, in their flannels 
  and denims, grim looks all around; and me propped up in a 
  corner, Millie and Janeen standing guard over me like a pair of 
  possessive she-bears. The specialists left without me. I now 
  belonged to the town.

  And I have belonged here ever since.

  I finish settling myself into my seat without any major 
  upheavals. I boot the computer, plug my vocoder into it, and log 
  into the net--by these actions I now can communicate with the 
  entire globe of computer networks. This is what I live for, 
  these days. It started out as a simple thing, just trying to be 
  useful and taking a stab at earning my keep, getting the 
  bookshop's finances on the machine and plugging into a few of 
  the basic news services. But then, with Emory's help, I began to 
  play around on the various networks. And then I discovered my 
  gift.

  At first all I did was talk--it was a pleasure to communicate on 
  bulletin boards, where nobody needs to know who you are or gives 
  a damn what you look like. Then, I began to play some of the 
  on-line games of chance, and was startled to find I had an 
  uncanny ability to second-guess the games. I would just look at 
  a poker hand--remember, we're talking video images here, not 
  even the paper cards favored by psychics--and I'd know what the 
  next draw cards would be, I would know the whole draw pile and 
  the dealer's hand. I was beating the odds to splinters; if I'd 
  been doing this in Vegas they'd have sent the bruisers after me 
  for card-counting.

  Emory could barely contain himself as he tried me out on 
  stock-market predictions. Soon, I was taking my modest little 
  paycheck from the bookstore and turning it into some astonishing 
  amounts of money. These days, I'm earning so much money that 
  it's a significant effort to keep it quiet. Only a very few 
  people know yet: Emory, of course, and also Millie, both of whom 
  I trust implicitly. But the venture is just about ready to go 
  public. And then there's that little interviewing gambit, which 
  will also prove to be most usefully lucrative....

  "Pole?" Millie is now favoring me with her penetrating look. 
  "Why are you doing this interview? I mean, the real reason. You 
  hardly need the money, right? Or have you had a change of luck 
  that you haven't wanted to worry me with?"

  "Don't be silly. If I did have a problem, you'd be the first 
  person I'd be blubbering all over--you know that. I just need 
  that one last hunk of cash for--well, I'll tell you, but only on 
  condition that you keep it a secret until the meeting tonight."

  "You're aiming to buy out Lowry."

  "Damned right I am. I am not having any slick bastard of a 
  developer come along and mess with my town. Not if I can help 
  it. And I think I can help it. For a change."

  "Va-va-voom! I just love it when you talk tough!" She gives my 
  shoulder a playful squeeze. Her voice is teasing but her smile 
  is full of admiration.

  "Hey, last of the true macho men, that's me," I banter back. I 
  love that smile of hers so much, sometimes I can barely look at 
  it.

  We're interrupted by the jingling of the doorbell. She goes to 
  greet the customer; I return my attention to the computer with a 
  certain sense of relief. I scroll through the various networks 
  on which I have membership. Several of my transactions from 
  yesterday have completed, all quite gainfully indeed. I sit and 
  sense the way of things, changing some of the orders still 
  outstanding, rescinding others and putting in new ones. In a 
  dozen brokerage firms around the world, transaction codes for a 
  "T. Pole" flash in. The yields add up in my head as I scroll 
  along--definitely enough, with the fee for the exclusive, to run 
  Lowry right out of town. And good riddance. I derive a deep 
  satisfaction out of this one power I can manifest over my 
  environment.

  Some key phrase from Millie's customer pulls me out of my 
  reverie--I think it was the standard, "Say, isn't that the guy I 
  heard about on TV...?" This, of course, is the downside of my 
  giving interviews, however infrequently; I become the modern 
  Elephant Man, the stuff of tabloid sensationalism. Millie 
  dutifully offers to introduce me. I know she hates these 
  gawkers, but I've forbidden her to be rude to her customers on 
  my account. The gawker swings into view: a typical tourist in a 
  lurid green windbreaker. His frank desire to gape is barely 
  concealed beneath a layer of gee-whiz reverence. His name is 
  something like Dobbs or Bobs--it goes through my head without a 
  trace.

  "Pleased to make your acquaintance," I type. He gets really 
  excited by my use of the vocoder.

  "Boy, I just have to hand it to you, your courage..." he gushes 
  on. All the while he stares and stares. No amount of simpering 
  he can muster can disguise the voyeuristic tension in that gaze. 
  Eventually he runs out of platitudes and takes his polyestered 
  self out of the store.

  "Auugggh!" Millie groans theatrically as soon as the door 
  clatters shut after him.

  "Actually, I'm thinking of charging these guys ten bucks a pop 
  to touch the pole," I type. "Or do you think that's just so 
  completely Freudian that even the polyester set would catch 
  wise?"

  Millie groans even louder.

  Eventually we both get back to work. The day passes 
  uneventfully. I finish my stroll through the gardens of high 
  finance and turn to my "real work." Millie does all the mobile 
  things--caring for the stock, waiting on customers. This is 
  Saturday, so there's a fairly steady stream of bodies through 
  the door. There's one more obnoxious-gawker type; the rest, for 
  the most part, are manageable, the kind who pride themselves on 
  being too liberal and sophisticated to patronize someone with a 
  deformity. These try their damnedest to look like they're taking 
  me completely in stride, but still steal discreet glimpses when 
  they think nobody is looking. It's a testament to how badly they 
  conceal their curiosity that even I can catch them doing it.

  Six o'clock, and we close up. Millie and I walk on down to the 
  cafe. A chorus of familiar voices greets us as we enter. I love 
  the smells of old Ciro's cooking--I have told him many times how 
  deeply I regret that I can't experience his food firsthand. He 
  simply laughs, and promises to see if I can be driven crazy by 
  the smell of his best avgolimono soup. (It really does drive me 
  crazy, but what a pleasant torment it is.)

  Joel has made a seat for me here, too, so that I can better 
  enjoy this hub of the village's social network. People make way 
  for me, teasing me cheerfully as I lower myself into place and 
  lay out my vocoder. Joel himself arrives, a mountain of rumpled 
  flannel crowned with a wild forest of hair. "Ah, Pole, my 
  friend," he rumbles at me, "the faith of the pious is being 
  sorely tested today."

  "Look, that's what you get for being a Red Sox fan," I retort. 
  "Now if you'd only see reason and switch to a truly worthy 
  object of worship like the Yankees--"

  "Sacrilege! Don't you go forgetting that this is a family 
  restaurant, you heathen!" Joel keeps threatening to load me in 
  his pickup someday and haul my unwieldy carcass to the "sacred 
  ground" of Fenway Park. Frankly, I'm not sure who would get more 
  stares: him or me.

  More people roll in. The TV's on to the middle of the second 
  game of the doubleheader, and the Sox by a miracle are not 
  snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. People argue 
  baseball, people fret about the growing season, people share the 
  latest gossip over a cold beer or a hot coffee. I luxuriate in 
  the combined sound of their voices. Each and every one of them 
  makes a point of coming over to me to say hello.

  The game ends with the Sox modestly triumphant. Someone says, 
  "It's getting on toward time for the meeting, isn't it?" I pry 
  myself up, and we all troop on over to the Congregational 
  meeting house. I manage to get on up the time-warped wooden 
  steps without seriously banging myself more than once. Here is 
  the third and last place in the world outside of my cottage that 
  is equipped to let me sit--sixth pew back on the left, just in 
  the right place to give me a full view of Pastor Bob in the 
  pulpit on Sunday morning.


  The Meeting
-------------

  Tonight it is not Pastor but old Cummings, the senior town 
  elder, who is in the pulpit. Pastor is down in the pew area, 
  working the crowd and pressing the flesh. When Cummings gavels 
  us to order, Pastor slips in next to me, on the side not already 
  occupied by Millie.

  I hear a surly growl go up from the crowd. "Lowry's lawyer just 
  came in," murmurs Pastor in my ear like a gently purring old 
  tiger-tabby.

  "What, he couldn't be bothered to come himself?" hisses Millie 
  in my other ear, sounding more like an offended Siamese.

  The lawyer's way out of my line of vision, but I know him well 
  from prior sightings-- polite, cosmopolitan, and completely 
  underwhelmed by any Main Street that has a grain and feed store 
  where there should in his opinion be an espresso bar. Lowry 
  never deigns to grace us with his own company, but he always 
  receives a detailed summary of every nuance of these meetings 
  from his dog's-body and his ever-present microrecorder. I know; 
  I have rifled the lawyer's reports via my computer. (Don't go 
  thinking I'm that pure. All's fair in love and land wars.)

  There is considerable fussing and fretting at this meeting. 
  Lowry has offered a significant sum of money for a large portion 
  of the town's common land. In this lousy economy, with tourism 
  flat and farming more a picturesque holdover from a bygone 
  century than a significant source of livelihood, such a sum 
  cannot be treated lightly. People are coming thick and fast up 
  to the podium in front of the chancel, working themselves and 
  each other into an uncomfortable state of anxiety. But I'm not 
  ready to plunge in with my offer just yet. I know if I do it too 
  early, before everyone has had time to get their feelings aired, 
  they just won't be able to hear or accept it.

  Finally, every last avenue has been explored, and there is a 
  pause. A distressing whiff of gloom wafts through the room. It 
  hurts me to see these people I've come to love in such pain, but 
  I'm also pleased. It means I have a chance of making these proud 
  folk accept my gift.

  I raise my hand to be called on, and a murmur goes up as I 
  laboriously get to my feet. I suppose nobody would take it amiss 
  if I chose to speak from my seat, but I feel this matter is too 
  important for half-measures. I can sense all eyes upon me as I 
  make my way forward and place my vocoder on the podium. And I 
  commence to address my people.

  "I would like to offer a modest counterproposal to that set 
  forth by Lowry Development Associates," I type.

  "Most of you are no doubt aware that I have found a rewarding 
  livelihood in my computer work. However, you may be surprised to 
  learn just how rewarding that work has been. I've been making 
  some investments, and they've been doing pretty well. In fact, I 
  am happy to report that I currently have some five million in 
  solid income from current investments alone." A gasp runs around 
  the room. "Further, I have just negotiated an exclusive contract 
  with a publisher who wishes to put out a book about me, with an 
  anticipated income from that project of another five million in 
  the next two years." More gasps.

  "Friends..."

  My hands are shaking. I have to stop a moment. I continue.

  "Friends, this town is home to all of us, and none of us wants 
  it to change. But I have an especially strong and admittedly 
  selfish interest in preserving it as it is. I simply don't think 
  I could exist anywhere else. I think you all know what I mean by 
  that. If Mumford stopped being the town I now know, and turned 
  into a fancy condo development full of strangers with big cars, 
  I just don't know how I could manage..."

  I have to stop again. The hall is completely silent, waiting for 
  me.

  "It is obvious to me that the funds I have just described are 
  far more than I could ever possibly need to support myself. I 
  would thus like to propose, with your consent, to donate a 
  sufficiently large proportion of these funds to set up a 
  perpetual trust, dedicated to the preservation of our town as it 
  is. That way, we will never have cause to regret turning down 
  any offer from any outsider, who, however well-intentioned, 
  can't possibly know what our town is really about. We can keep 
  our home the way it is, the way we need it to be..."

  Now I really can't go on any further. I am shaking so hard I 
  have to clutch at the podium to keep my balance. Someone has 
  leapt to their feet and started applauding wildly. In a flash 
  everyone is standing and applauding; they are pounding on the 
  pews with their fists and on the floor with their feet, it 
  sounds like a thunderstorm and it won't let up. Pastor is 
  suddenly at my side holding me up, and Millie's doing the same 
  at my other side. "I'm so proud of you," Millie whispers 
  fiercely in my ear. I shake and shake, I can't seem to stop 
  shaking.

  Cummings gavels the crowd to silence eventually. "Our friend 
  Pole has just made an exceedingly generous offer," she says 
  portentously. "I will assume that Pole knows exactly what he is 
  doing, and thus will not insult his intelligence with silly 
  questions about whether he really means it. I am now open to 
  entertaining a motion from the floor."

  "Move to accept Pole's offer!" Joel's roar shakes the rafters.

  "Second!" cry several voices simultaneously.

  "Move we vote to accept by acclamation!" cries old Janeen.

  "Second!" Another chorus of voices.

  "Do we have acclamation?" cries Cummings. The hall thunders back 
  uproariously.

  "Three cheers for Pole!" roars a stentorian voice. I soak myself 
  with tears as they commence an old-fashioned hip-hip et cetera. 
  I wonder distractedly what Lowry's lawyer is doing during all 
  this tumult. Probably coolly buffing his nails as his 
  microrecorder spools on and on. No skin off his nose. 
  Development corporations like the one he works for never put all 
  their eggs in one basket. I know for a fact they're working on 
  at least six other village buy-outs; that Mumford fought them 
  off will not bother them in the least, as long as they get a 
  handsome yield from their other projects. Which is exactly why 
  they need to have their greedy paws kept off our town; to them, 
  we're not a skein of tightly woven lives but a convenient 
  framework for a resort concept.

  But they're gone now, they're gone, they're gone, the battle has 
  been won; the Huns have been beaten back from our gates, and I 
  the one who did the beating.

  Much later--after many hugs and back-poundings that jar my body 
  no end but do wonders for my soul; after an impromptu party back 
  at the cafe, where I am toasted with champagne Ciro unearths 
  from God-knows-where, the look and smell of which makes me glad 
  I can't taste it; after more hugs, and some tears, and many 
  goodnights from friends not yet finished with savoring this 
  moment with me--I find myself before my own front door, having 
  been walked home by an ebullient Millie.

  We pause there a moment, silent. The crickets sound abnormally 
  loud. "I really am proud of you, you know," she says. Of all the 
  many looks she wears, the one she has on now makes me feel the 
  most awkward by far. I decide to turn partly away from her in 
  order to balance the vocoder on a railing for a reply. I feel a 
  little less vulnerable that way.

  "I'm rather proud of myself, to tell the truth," I respond. God, 
  did that sound fatuous or what? "I really wasn't sure I had it 
  in me." Better.

  "You have so much in you, I wish you could really believe that." 
  She comes around to my front and hugs me. My face goes hot. My 
  hands sweat. Not all of the rigidity in the hug I return can be 
  blamed on the pole in my flesh.

  She releases me eventually. I can't make out whether I am 
  relieved or regretful. "Thanks, Millie," I type, grateful for 
  the cheerfully neutral voice of the vocoder. "You know I love 
  you very much, don't you?"

  "And I love you too," she replies, a warm smile in her voice. 
  But I'm at the wrong angle to see her face.

  We part and I let myself into the house. I suddenly realize I'm 
  emotionally drained, even less equipped than usual to handle 
  confused feelings towards my dearest friend in the world. I get 
  all my props returned to their rightful places only by a massive 
  effort of will, and fall into bed exhausted.

  For some unknown period my sleep is deep and undisturbed. And 
  then I dream, and for perhaps the first time in three whole 
  years the dream is full, lucid, and unfragmented.


  The Dream
-----------

  I am in a dimly-lit, cavernous room. In the air is the faint hum 
  of power pumping through sophisticated machinery. I am standing 
  on some sort of a platform that looks a bit like a hangman's 
  scaffold, and the impending sense of doom I feel suits it 
  perfectly.

  A figure with brilliant emerald skin and a flowing crimson robe 
  stands by a control panel, hand poised on a great lever. Two 
  other figures stand by; they are too deep in shadow for me to 
  make out. "This is it, Cory," says one of the shadows. "Last 
  chance to reconsider."

  "You know I've got to go through with it," I say. "Do it. Get it 
  over with. Before I lose my nerve."

  A shadowy figure makes a sign to the emerald being, who nods 
  solemnly and throws the lever. A beam of light stabs down at me 
  from the ceiling and another stabs up at me from the platform, 
  trapping me in a column of light that shoots through my body and 
  up my spine and out my mouth. My head is thrown back and I am 
  screaming--a beam of light--

  I come awake to the pale dawn fog and the unconcerned songs of 
  the birds.

  The dream was so very real. My waking surroundings almost seem 
  like a dream in contrast. And there was a damn-fool alligator in 
  a pink suit, and what did the other one call me? Cory? Why does 
  that name ring such a clamorous bell within me, as if...

  And I didn't have the pole.

  But then came the beam.

  I am not handling this dream very well, nor the rush of strange 
  thoughts that it has set loose, swirling the more frantically 
  around in my head the more I focus on them. I don't think I want 
  to handle any of this. I think I need some help, and fast.

  Millie?

  Oh, dear. No. Not this time. I think, now, I need some help with 
  that situation too, and I've been putting it off for far too 
  long.

  I know who.

  The meetinghouse bell is just beginning to toll as I approach 
  those trying wooden steps. Millie never comes here for services; 
  she's a hardened atheist. But I'm here every Sunday, and I need 
  it today more than ever. So distracted am I that, when the first 
  person who spots me comes up and starts thanking me profusely, I 
  need a minute to remember what it is I'm being thanked for. God, 
  I can't believe I'm that rattled! Once again I'm glad I am 
  possessed of the literal poker-face. More people approach me as 
  I make my way to my pew. I'm a bit more composed now, so I am 
  able to give them such acknowledgment as I can. It's soothing to 
  talk with them about my recent triumph, it takes my mind away 
  from its new discoveries.

  Once the service starts, though, I'm back alone with my 
  thoughts, troubling companions with which to try to worship. 
  This is an old Puritan church, so there are no florid pictures 
  of Biblical scenes, and the simple wooden cross has no martyred 
  figure upon it. But how to be at Sunday service and avoid the 
  mental picture of the Teacher on his sacrificial tree? And how, 
  once it manifests, to keep that image from getting all tangled 
  with my dream of getting nailed by a beam of light?

  I sit and hear, and sit and hear, convinced that either I'm 
  beginning to remember a past that is far more disturbing than I 
  could ever have imagined, or else that I am finally cracking up.

  The soothing voice of Pastor Bob's preaching calms me somewhat, 
  and by the end of the final hymn I've got myself partway 
  convinced that I was overreacting. Yet when I finally speak to 
  Pastor at the door, having waited until almost everyone else has 
  left, there must be something in my manner that suggests I'm not 
  quite right. Pastor gives me a sharp look, has me wait until the 
  last few others have left, and then marches me immediately right 
  back to his study.

  "I regret I don't have a good place for you to sit in here," he 
  says as he closes the big oak door to the outside world, "but at 
  least here we can have some privacy."

  "I appreciate that," I type. I have placed the vocoder on top of 
  one of the more stable piles of books on his desk, and am 
  resting my weight on my feet and the pole in the manner of a 
  three-legged stool. It's not my favorite position, as the 
  pressure and shifts of weight on the pole send some truly weird 
  vibrations through my body; but it's better than nothing, 
  especially when I'm feeling so unsteady on my feet, so to speak.

  "Pastor," I type, "do you think I have been acting... peculiar 
  lately?"

  Another sharp look. "Peculiar? Not any more so than usual, that 
  I've noticed. Unless you count giving away ten million dollars 
  peculiar--which I of all people don't. Why--were you looking for 
  some suggestions?" His ribbing is softened with a just-kidding 
  smile. He is no simple country parson, our Pastor. He'd put in a 
  long illustrious career serving several urban, 
  social-action-oriented churches, and then taught social ethics 
  at a prestigious seminary; he took this call upon his retirement 
  "just to keep his hand in," as he put it. So this town has not 
  only a most joyful servant, but a particularly brilliant and 
  worldly one.

  "Thanks, no," I answer him. "I'm feeling quite peculiar enough 
  already. I just--how do I explain...?" I describe my dream in 
  detail. He listens carefully, rubbing his chin, occasionally 
  emitting a "uh-hum." He sits for some time after I finish, still 
  rubbing his chin and emitting a few more "uh-hums."

  "Why do you think this dream you had means you're getting 
  'peculiar'?" he asks at last.

  I hesitate. "Because," I respond, my hands trembling slightly on 
  the keys, "the only interpretation that suggests itself so 
  smacks of hubris, it makes me fear for my sanity just to 
  contemplate it."

  "And that interpretation is...?" He's not going to let me get 
  away without saying it in so many words.

  "That--if the dream is not just a dream, but a true memory of my 
  prior life--that I somehow volunteered for this... existence. In 
  order to save the world or some such nonsense."

  "Why does it trouble you so to contemplate being a savior? After 
  all, you just saved Mumford last night." He's smiling at me very 
  faintly.

  I come to a complete halt. Why, indeed? "It strikes me," I type, 
  thinking carefully, "that saviorhood is something much more 
  sensibly proclaimed by others than proclaimed of oneself. 
  Otherwise it smacks of hubris. Or of delusional thought 
  patterns."

  "Perhaps. To a certain extent. But one can also err in the 
  direction of keeping one's light stowed under a bushel, you 
  know. Strikes me you've always bent so far over backward to deny 
  your considerable gifts and graces that it's a wonder to me you 
  haven't snapped that pole of yours in two."

  I feel uncomfortably found out. "I wasn't expecting the 
  conversation to go in this direction."

  "I'm sure you weren't. And I'm not ready to let you change the 
  subject yet. Now I have to admit, I have never in my life had 
  the experience of looking anything other than unrelentingly 
  average, so I can't know how it must feel to carry the burden 
  you do every day. But I've been meaning to say this to you for 
  years, and you've finally given me the opportunity: you have got 
  to be one of the bravest, gentlest souls I have met in all my 
  long years of ministry, and it breaks my heart to see how you 
  won't let yourself accept what a wonderful person you are. Why 
  do you have to drive yourself crazy the way you do? Don't you 
  know there are people all around you who absolutely love you? 
  Not because they pity you, for God's sake--because they 
  genuinely love you and need you. Millie, just to name one 
  prominent example."

  I feel even more deeply found out. "What about Millie?"

  "What about Millie?" He laughs uproariously. "Son, a man of the 
  cloth doesn't gamble, but if I wanted to I could join any number 
  of pools in town taking bets on the day you'll finally wake up 
  and take that woman to the altar. What--you think people don't 
  have eyes? It's been the talk of the town for over two years. 
  And I'll tell you something else--though it may seem I'm taking 
  a considerable liberty with my ministerial privilege--not two 
  weeks ago, Millie was standing almost exactly where you're 
  standing now, all at wit's end over you, because she's loved you 
  desperately since almost the first time she laid eyes on you! 
  And you, you're so terrified at the very idea of getting 
  involved that she hasn't dared to as much as breathe a word of 
  it to you, for fear of scaring you out of eight years' growth!"

  "Millie came to church?" Somehow that just adds the final, 
  perfect touch of improbability to the matter.

  "I know; doesn't that suggest what lengths she's willing to go 
  to for you? Seriously, she thought I might have some in with you 
  that she wouldn't have, her being the source of the threat, so 
  to speak. So--what is it, son? What's the big holdup? Do you 
  want me to say that out loud for you, too? Or can I get you to 
  say it for yourself?"

  "Pastor, consider me laughing uproariously right now. No, I'll 
  say it myself. It's the obvious, of course. I mean--me? In love? 
  Me, inviting a person whose opinion matters more to me than 
  anything in the world, to enjoy physical intimacies with _this_ 
  body? I'm not even quite sure if my body is capable of such 
  intimacies, if you catch my drift. The very idea of risking this 
  friendship--risking the rejection, the confused feelings, maybe 
  the very friendship itself--of course I'm terrified! I just 
  haven't been able to do it, though don't think I haven't 
  agonized over it. But now, if what you say is true--"

  "Would I lie to you? So now you'll get out there and go after 
  her?"

  "I will. I'm still scared out of my wits, mind you, but I will. 
  Now about my dream--"

  "Your dream, if the truth be known, I'm rather less concerned 
  about. Knowing where you come from can be empowering, but not 
  nearly so much as knowing where you're going."

  "But do you think the dream was true?"

  "How should I know? For what it's worth, by the evidence of your 
  own body you are a unique occurrence on the face of this earth. 
  It is thus safe to assume that your origin is also unique. And 
  maybe someday we'd know the truth of where you come from--and 
  maybe not--but in either case you still have a life you need to 
  live. Perhaps your dream is true. But what does it matter? Does 
  your life become any more sensible by discovering you fell off a 
  flying saucer or whatever? You still have to live.

  "Now--does that help you at all?"

  "Well, it does lessen my fears for my sanity."

  "If your sanity is dependent on my word, son, you're in trouble 
  deep." He laughs again, and stands. "Go to her, son. She's a 
  good woman. She loves you. And I'll tell you a secret: I think 
  she needs you every bit as much as you need her, if not more. 
  Now get out of here, and God bless."

  I ponder Pastor's words all the way down Main Street. I don't 
  feel any less unsettled, but somehow I feel a little more at 
  peace with being unsettled, if that makes any sense. Actually, 
  the only thing that is making sense, and is gradually forcing 
  its way through the miasma of my conflicted thoughts, is 
  Pastor's message about Millie: "Go to her, she loves you."

  I begin to feel a wild strange euphoria pulsing through my 
  usually-placid veins. If I were capable of running, I would 
  break into a sprint right now. But I do speed up as much as I am 
  able, and commence to make a beeline for Millie's place.

  She lives about two streets over from me, in a flat on the 
  second floor of one of the most charming wedding-cakes. I can 
  see its stately roofline peeping out from behind the maples-- 
  the elaborately tiled mansard roof, the cupola with the 
  stained-glass mullions. A faint wind stirs the trees, and a wind 
  chime tinkles unseen on the wraparound veranda.

  I am getting closer. My normally sluggish heart is beating 
  madly. I actually feel alive, for the first time in the three 
  years of my known life. Here I am, I feel like singing, the 
  ill-made knight proven at last, fresh from securing my homeland 
  from the Huns, returning now in triumph to ask for the hand of 
  the lady who has always believed in me. The air in fact does 
  seem to be singing, humming with the sound of thousands of bees.

  There is something like a crack of thunder, and it is only as I 
  am falling to the ground that I realize that the corresponding 
  bolt of lightning has just struck me. It has shot right down the 
  pole as if I were a living lightning rod.

  I hit the ground with a crash, and lie there a moment, stunned. 
  The world has darkened-- have I suffered a concussion? All my 
  insides, the length of my body, are cramping uncontrollably. 
  They are trying to knot themselves around something that no 
  longer seems to be there. I find myself writhing on the ground 
  and groaning aloud with the pain of it--

  Wait a minute.

  "Thank the gods. And not a moment too soon. Come on, Cory, snap 
  out of it. We haven't a minute to spare."

  "Sabin--won't you back off a bit? The man's obviously shaken up. 
  Give him a moment to compose himself."

  "Look, Lucas--you're the one's been making all the noise about 
  how unstable this hiatus is, you're the one's been ragging on 
  about how difficult it's going to be to keep it open long enough 
  for us to do the intervention--"

  "Sabin. Leave Lucas alone. We're all under a lot of stress, but 
  just please try to stay focused. Cory, do you understand me? Do 
  you remember me? Please--speak."

  "My voice," I croak. My face feels like sprung elastic, my jaw 
  as if it has rust in its hinges. I am helped into a sitting 
  position. I am in the cavernous room of my dream, sprawled upon 
  the scaffold-like platform. The column of light juts down from 
  the ceiling, but comes to an abrupt halt about ten feet above my 
  head, like a piston poised and waiting to come crashing down 
  again. Two figures are leaning over me; I'm having trouble 
  getting my eyes to focus on them. A third stands over by the 
  control panel; I see a glint of brilliant green in the low 
  light.

  "The pain you feel is from the removal of the physical 
  distortion you suffered when you were projected out onto your 
  target plane," says the owner of the last voice to speak. "It 
  will lessen somewhat with time. Though I fear time is not 
  something we have a lot of."

  My head wobbles on the pivot of my neck as I turn to face the 
  speaker. "Dana?" I say wonderingly, my memories fluttering in 
  and out like shuffled cards. "What--I don't understand--"

  Dana smiles, visibly relieved; there are more lines in the wise 
  old face than I remembered. "Good. Your memory is beginning to 
  return. I'm sorry, Cory. We had a disaster during your 
  transmission. An interference from the inter-dimensional void. 
  The carrier beam went through, but we lost all communications 
  contact with your mind. Your memory went into stasis. We've 
  spent three years trying to reestablish contact."

  "Three years." My memories are now sliding back into place so 
  fast that it's making me dizzy. I shake my head to clear it--bad 
  move; my much-abused spine screams in protest. "Of course. Three 
  years of fighting it. Fighting assimilation into the milieu. 
  Fighting that ghastly physical manifestation. Until just this 
  past twenty-four hours, when I finally began to relax and accept 
  it all."

  "Congratulations," Dana replies. "That will go down in the 
  training manuals--adaptation to milieu under extraordinary 
  stressors of physical distortion and amnesia."

  "Look, this is all very warm and fuzzy, but may I point out that 
  the clock is ticking away?" Sabin. How could I have possibly 
  forgotten that abrasive tone of voice?

  "How much time do we have, Lucas?" asks Dana calmly.

  The glittering emerald cyborg consults its screens and readouts 
  before replying in its golden voice. "I can give you about five 
  more minutes before the connection begins to degrade 
  dangerously, ma'am."

  "It will have to do. Cory, listen. It's all well and good that 
  you established the linkage even under such harsh conditions, 
  but I can't in good faith let you go back there unless you 
  completely understand what the situation is. There was, as I 
  said, catastrophic interference with your original transmission. 
  It took three years for us to find you--for awhile, we weren't 
  even sure if your mind was still functioning. It was all we 
  could do to pull you back in, even for this brief hiatus. If we 
  send you out to the same target once more, I can't but wonder if 
  the same thing will happen to you all over again. Not only is 
  that a hell of a way to run an inter- dimensional mission, but 
  I'm not one bit happy with the idea of submitting one of my best 
  operatives to that kind of punishment--"

  "You realize," I croak, "that the interference is probably 
  symptomatic of the larger problem."

  "Don't I ever. The inter-dimensional stress has accelerated 
  since you've been gone. At this rate, we're going to have to add 
  at least a dozen more linkages to this one sector alone to 
  prevent it shearing off from the Continuum completely."

  "Which means you can't very well abandon this link of mine right 
  here."

  Dana looks at me, silent. What goes unspoken is the underlying 
  enormity of this mission, this generations-long project that all 
  of us have pledged our very souls to. With all the powerful 
  technology and knowledge possessed by this, our home dimension, 
  we have yet to find a more effective way to stave off the 
  fragmentation of the Continuum than to throw our very bodies 
  into the breach. We serve as the living linkages between worlds. 
  We are the only hope.

  Hubris? Perhaps. But what other society is in any position to 
  make this kind of sacrifice? Most of the other dimensions, like 
  the one in which I have just spent three years of pain and 
  confusion, are Pre-Contact; they don't even possess the 
  technology to detect the Trans- Dimensional Continuum, let alone 
  deal with the growing fissures in their realities. All they know 
  is that their civilizations suffer from a subtle but increasing 
  malaise, which is nothing less than the fragmentation syndrome's 
  manifestation on the level of the communal psyche. A few other 
  dimensions possess at least the basic technology to have 
  achieved Contact, but their cultures are either not yet mature 
  enough to produce more than the occasional true altruist, or 
  else they are already so infected with the malaise that they can 
  barely summon up the will to keep their worlds from 
  self-destructing. And a few dimensions, both pre- and post- 
  Contact, have already self-destructed, having sunk into any of 
  the all-too-numerous forms of cultural suicide.

  No, it's up to us, hurling ourselves bodily across the void, 
  anchoring all the dimensions to Continuum Core with the very 
  fibre of our beings. What is it one of the subcultures in my 
  target milieu calls that? A Kamikaze mission. Banzai--live ten 
  thousand years. But, actually, we do. Only, there are certain 
  risks to that kind of lifestyle.

  "I'm going back." I rise unsteadily to my feet, aware that this 
  may be the last time in a long, long time that I'll have an 
  unencumbered body.

  "Cory." Dana's eyes are glistening. Even Sabin is respectfully 
  silent.

  "I didn't say I'm looking forward to it," I continue. "But I'm 
  doing it. Besides, I'm pretty sure I might actually keep my mind 
  intact this time. I made a very powerful link back there, you 
  see. Very deep on the emotional level. I think I have a chance." 
  Millie. I feel the smile grow on my face.

  Dana nods, smiling faintly. "Yes. I sense you have. The gods go 
  with you, then, Cory." She and Sabin get clear of the platform. 
  She nods to Lucas. The emerald-green gatekeeper gives me a deep 
  bow of honor. And then it pulls the switch--


  Home
------

  The beam snaps back through my body so hard and fast that I 
  don't even have time to scream. And then, I no longer can.

  I hit the ground with a crash, and lie there, stunned.

  This hitting the deck is getting very old very fast.

  I am lying in dappled sunlight on a concrete sidewalk. Birds are 
  singing with blithe unconcern. The pole is still vibrating, like 
  a cold-sensitive tooth stung by ice-water, only this tooth is 
  shooting its displeasure the entire length of my body.

  I understand now. The transmission beam, the linkage, of which I 
  am the living anchor on this plane--somehow, because of the 
  interference, it is concretely manifesting as an organic part of 
  my body, instead of an intangible thread back to my home 
  dimension as it's supposed to do. No wonder it's so damned 
  sensitive. And all I've been using its power for is to second- 
  guess the stock-market and other intuitional parlor-tricks. 
  That's so funny, I truly wish I could laugh out loud.

  "Pole! Oh my God! Are you all right?"

  Good lord, it's Millie. What did she see? Did she catch any 
  glimpse of my retrieval and retransmission? God knows it was 
  noisy enough--thunder and lightning indeed! But these are the 
  kinds of unfortunate glimpses that can really screw up a 
  pre-Contact milieu--

  I hear feet pounding down the steps of the veranda, and then she 
  is upon me in a flash, picking me up off the sidewalk, brushing 
  me off, gathering up my cane and glasses and vocoder from where 
  they've scattered in my fall. She gets me up onto the veranda 
  and stretched out on my stomach across her landlady's chaise 
  lounge, and sits on the floor near my head, where I can actually 
  look her right in the eye without resorting to my mirror 
  glasses. I have a weary headache from all the energy and 
  emotions that have coursed through me this momentous day, and 
  the feel of a few places on my body suggests I'm going to have 
  some spectacular bruises.

  She ruffles my hair playfully, smiles her relief into my eyes. 
  "There. None the worse for wear, once again. I think maybe you 
  should take some of that ten million and install rubber matting 
  on all the town's sidewalks, for all the times you take a header 
  on a stretch of perfectly flat concrete."

  "Forget about it," I type--thank God I didn't bust the poor 
  little vocoder in the fall. "Can you just see me taking a bounce 
  off something like that?" Apparently, she has seen nothing more 
  than me taking a splat. Good. I don't need to muck up this 
  situation with any complex explanations that will just sound 
  like B-grade science fiction--even if they are all true. I just 
  want, for now, to be a normal, run-of-the-mill village oddity.

  "No, I'll live," I type. "I was just in too much of a hurry is 
  all. I was just down to the meetinghouse speaking to Pastor, 
  and... I'm really sorry, Millie, that it's taken me all this 
  time for reality to come and hit me over the head, but--Millie, 
  will you marry me?"

  She gasps, and just sits there a moment, stunned. I'm seized 
  with panic--oh God no, I can't have been wrong, Pastor assured 
  me.... But then she bursts into tears, and throws her arms 
  around my head, babbling on and on and on about how I have just 
  made her the happiest woman in the entire world.

  I hug her back as best I can, feeling the tears welling up out 
  of my own eyes. The afternoon sun is slanting down in golden 
  shafts onto the veranda. A warm and beautiful woman is in my 
  arms, her flesh soft and inviting under my hands. The living 
  antenna in the heart of my being is singing to full life at 
  last, singing a song of healing across all the dimensions, a 
  song that enfolds little Mumford and its world in its 
  protection, a song that is echoed by the birds in the maples.

  Auto Plaza Rag    by Adam C. Engst
====================================
..................................................................
  * Ever feel as if you were in a different time zone from the 
  rest of the world? Some people are like that all the time... *
..................................................................

  I took my Chevy Nova in to be fixed last Friday. I drove it up 
  to the BMW/Mazda/Subaru/Chevrolet/Volvo Auto Plaza and the door 
  opened and I drove it in. Ed edited my name on the computer, 
  adding a comma. "It won't be long," he smiled.

  Waiting room. Blue-gray concrete block walls with charcoal trim 
  outlining the doors. In case you can't find them. Lots of glass 
  and chrome. Window in front of me reminds me of the Swedish flag 
  except it is clear. Sign: "Your satisfaction is extremely 
  important to us!" Double line. "If you have any concerns or 
  suggestions please ask to speak with our customer assistance 
  manager Wendy Wallenbeck or if you prefer please call: 
  272-9292." Triple line. Couldn't Ed add some commas to the sign 
  too? I want to sleep with Wendy Wallenbeck. I want customer 
  assistance.

  Proctor-Silex coffee pot three-quarters full for customers only. 
  Windows stare at me. I stare back. Anderson Rent-All across the 
  street. "Hi, I'd like to rent Wendy Wallenbeck." Matter of fact 
  tone. Sign on the window. Mazda, "We surround you with 
  satisfaction." Snow flakes like cotton balls, like bunnies 
  hopping down the bunny trail.

  Blue-gray concrete block walls and clear windows. Grey seats. 
  Tasteful post-modern garage decor. Gold oval clock near the 
  door. On time. Four minutes slower than my watch because my 
  watch is four minutes fast in this time zone. Sign on the door. 
  "PUSH." Second sign on the door. "Notice of liquidation." 
  Curling at the corners. Van pulls up outside the windows. 
  Federal Express man wearing Federal Express coveralls and a 
  Federal Express knit hat unloads long, fat, oblong, thin, short 
  packages. Chiasmus. Slowly. One at a time.

  Snow slows to motes in the whites of god's Eye. "Don't shoot 
  until you see the whites of his Eye." Tall blonde on tall heels 
  clicks past four minutes fast. Wendy Wallenbeck? Styrofoam 
  cups--the cockroaches will build houses with Styrofoam cups 
  curling at the corners and en-spaces or is it em-spaces when the 
  world blows up. Short woman from PartsPlus wearing a PartsPlus 
  coat pulls up outside the windows. Carries in a small cardboard 
  box labeled in big letters "Air Filter." Blonde shoulder length 
  hair shorter than Wendy Wallenbeck's. I want to sleep with Wendy 
  Wallenbeck.

  Two men next to me. "Fifty cents on the TomTran to work. Fifty 
  cents back. You gotta keep a truck out of the salt and slush to 
  keep it nice." Gold clock sticks out. Wendy Wallenbeck couldn't 
  have picked it out? She looks pained when I mention it. Second 
  short woman from PartsPlus pulls up outside the windows. Dirty 
  brown hair crawling on the last legs of a perm. Wears PartsPlus 
  overalls under a brown PartsPlus jacket. Two men, "One dollar a 
  day. Thanksgiving Day I went over every inch my truck. Not a 
  speck of dirt on it."

  Sign on the window. Volvo, "We are ready to service you." Are 
  Volvos from Sweden? Can't hold it longer. Bathroom. Two 
  switches. One light, one fan. I turn off the fan. Blue-gray 
  decor except for the charcoal outline of the door, should I be 
  unable to find it. Sit down. Elliptical toilet paper dispenser. 
  Gives more torque, prevents more than five sheets of bathroom 
  tissue from coming off at once. Frustrated, I pull at it again 
  and again, generating lots of torque. Someone tries the door, 
  which I've locked in a fit of paranoia. I cough unconvincingly 
  so they don't use their keys or simply break the door down and 
  drag me off for interrogation. "How do you know Wendy 
  Wallenbeck?" It's a very effective technique, you know, 
  abducting suspects from the toilet.

  Plump blonde woman from United Parcel Service pulls up outside 
  the window. She has short curly hair and is wearing a UPS nylon 
  jacket. "Artificial milk or artificial sugar for your coffee, 
  sir?" asks Wendy Wallenbeck. The fake sugar is in a blue-topped 
  plastic dispenser and the fake milk is in a white-topped plastic 
  dispenser. "Mr. Slite. We've finished the alignment." That may 
  or may not be my name. It isn't a good idea to give out your 
  name to strangers. Some Indian tribes used to think if someone 
  knew your name, that person could control you. Now if they know 
  your name, they can call you and send you private offerings in 
  the mail and ogle your credit rating. It's all the same thing, I 
  suppose.

  "You don't have to call me sir," I tell Wendy Wallenbeck. "You 
  can call me--" Drowned out by "Carl Franks. Please dial five 
  hundred. Carl Franks. Five hundred." Two men, "Fifty cents to 
  and from work. Three months of this and I figure my truck will 
  stay nice." Hundreds of millions of years pass. "Mr. Slite. 
  We've finished the alignment on your Nova." "Ed, is it now a 
  super nova?" Yes, he replied and I thought I saw the motes in 
  his eyes glinting as it exploded.

  Bleeding Hearts   Sung J. Woo
===============================
..................................................................
  * Good friends support each other in times of need. But as 
  you're comforting your friends, ask yourself: how well do you 
  really know them? *
..................................................................

  "Does it really matter?" Denise says. "It's only Jim. He's 
  always like this after he gets the heave-ho."

  "I've known him since fourth grade," I say, looking at the 
  yellow mums, "in Mrs. McKimson's class." The flowers smell 
  wonderful; they smell like summer.

  Denise points to the back of the store with her right foot. "We 
  haven't even checked the cactus section."

  "You're funny."

  "Oh Cliff, you know, it's like he likes it."

  "What's that supposed to mean?" I ask, louder than I wanted to. 
  Some people look in our direction.

  "Maybe we should discuss this at the studios of WLJK, you know, 
  where only half the town will hear it."

  I just look at her, then look back at the mums.

  She puts her hand on my arm. We walk away from the mums. "Look, 
  I know Jim's your friend and all, but he's a sad case. No, don't 
  look at me that way. You know that it's true."

  We're now in the fern aisle, nothing but green, flowing leaves. 
  "I've known Jim for a long time," I say, touching a fern leaf.

  "Yes, since fourth grade, in Mrs. McKimson's class."

  "He's been there for me, over and over again."

  She shrugs and walks over to the roses. There are some things 
  Denise will never be, and I have come to accept that. Growing 
  up, I call it--realizing that everyone has limitations, yourself 
  included. I have faults, she has faults, we all have faults, and 
  it's dealing with those faults that counts.

  When I turn the corner, I have it. Lilies, white ones. I call 
  Denise over, and she comes along with a long-stemmed rose. "Is 
  this like totally sexy or what?" she says, and bites the middle 
  of the stem like some exotic dancer.

  "It's, like, totally you," I say, and kiss her. I had never 
  kissed anyone biting a rose before.

  "So--lilies, huh? Do you know what color?"

  "I like the white ones."

  "Me too."

  At the register I pay for a pot of lilies and a long-stemmed 
  rose, complete with tooth and lipstick marks.




  What Denise said about Jim was not totally true. He doesn't like 
  to be dumped--nobody does, although I do get the feeling he does 
  like some caring from friends in the aftermath. Is that so 
  wrong? And he isn't a sad case, either, it's just rotten luck. 
  As he often tells me, "Cliff, there are two things I'll never 
  have any luck with--cars and women." To my knowledge, he's had 
  more accidents and flats than anyone else, and almost always 
  there's a woman in the car when it happens. Two birds with one 
  stone.

  The potted lilies sit in the passenger side, the bulbs bobbing 
  in rhythm with the car. Lilies are very pretty flowers, and a 
  bit sad, too, in the way they seem to have a permanent slouch. 
  Perfect for this occasion.

  Times like these I wonder about Jim. He's not a bad-looking guy 
  at all--better looking than me, in fact, with fine red hair and 
  a bunch of freckles. Denise once told me how youthful Jim looked 
  with those freckles. "He's always going to be a high school 
  senior, you know. Age and cuteness do not go together well in 
  men." Denise, the Goddess of Men.

  That may be true in the long run, but Jim's my age, just turned 
  25 a month ago. That's when things were still good, when Jim and 
  Sandy were still together. Things couldn't have been better at 
  the party. Sandy seemed very happy, and I saw them smooching at 
  every chance they got, like a couple of junior high school kids.

  But something had gone wrong, and now it's all over. Holding the 
  flower pot in one hand, I ring Jim's doorbell. Nothing. I ring 
  it again, and this time I hear footsteps.

  "Cliff," he says. "I was dozing." He looks like hell, like he 
  hasn't shaved for a couple of days, complete with a phenomenal 
  bedhead. He waves me in.

  "Just wanted to see how you were doing," I say, closing the door 
  behind me.

  "What's the deal with the potted plant?" he asks.

  I shove it in his chest. "For you, my friend."

  "Lilies."

  "You got it. Denise helped me pick it out, sort of."

  He puts it down on the coffee table, plops down on the couch, 
  and stares at it. "Is this supposed to cheer me up?"

  "Not really," I say. "I just thought them appropriate."

  "Appropriate. They're droopy and sad-looking."

  "Like I said."

  "Thank you," he says, and manages to smile.

  "I haven't been around much," I say. "I thought I was leaving 
  you and Sandy alone, for you two to spend some quality time 
  together."

  "Another one gone, into the scrapbooks."

  "You could've called me, you know. You have a bad way of just 
  letting things fall apart around you once something happens. You 
  have friends."

  "I didn't want to bother you, I guess. Hey, pass me the 
  ashtray."

  He takes out a pack of Marlboro Mediums and lights up a 
  cigarette. "They went down in price, you know that? They're 
  starting a big price war with the other brands." He offers one 
  for me, and I take it. It had been a couple of months since I 
  last had my smoke, since Jim's last breakup, with the fiery 
  blonde Joleen. Have to remember to brush my teeth before I see 
  Denise.

  "So you want to talk about it?" I say.

  He shrugs. "Not much to say, really. It's the same old shit. Jim 
  meets nice girl, they date for a while, Jim gets dumped for the 
  usual reasons."

  "What, old boyfriend?"

  He shakes his head. "No, nothing so simple, I'm afraid," he 
  says, feeling the texture of one of the lilies. "She told me 
  that she just didn't feel right with me."

  "That's not much of an excuse."

  "She's not the type of person who would lie, though. That isn't 
  Ms. Bernstein at all." Jim never refers to one of his 
  ex-girlfriends by their first name.

  "I talked to her, you know, at your birthday party. She said you 
  were very nice."

  "Well, Cliff, you know what they say about nice guys."

  "Yeah, but you guys were messing around the whole time!"

  "That was a month ago. Things went sour. I just didn't notice, I 
  guess."

  I shake my head in confusion. " 'I don't feel right with you' is 
  not an excuse, Jim. Didn't you even bother to ask her to be more 
  specific?"

  He gets up and goes to the kitchen. "Want a beer? I just bought 
  some Sam Adams. And I have some leftover Domino's."

  "Sure," I say, exasperated. He sometimes seems so laid back that 
  it frightens me.

  "The first time you hear it," Jim says from the kitchen, "you 
  ask. You ask why, you ask why not, the works. Then the second 
  time you hear it, you ask again, wondering if the reasons match 
  the first one. Then the third time you also ask because 
  coincidences do happen." He comes back with two bottles of Sam 
  Adams and a greasy box of pepperoni pizza. "After that, you 
  don't ask, because you are sick of hearing the same shit over 
  and over again."

  "You never told me this."

  "Sorry," he says, "it just wasn't worth talking about, I guess. 
  I've never had a relationship for longer than three months, 
  Cliff."

  "What about Susanne Perkins?" I say, picking at a pepperoni.

  "I don't exactly count passing notes in gym in seventh grade to 
  be a fulfilling relationship."

  We eat for a bit, and suck on our bottles of beer. Maybe Jim's 
  just too nice of a guy, I think. Some women, and men, too, will 
  just walk all over you if you give them the chance. It's like 
  they see a crack in the dam, and they'll chip away at it until 
  the whole thing breaks.

  "Are you happy with Denise?" Jim asks me, catching me off guard.

  I pause and meet his eyes for a moment. Jim returns my gaze, 
  raising his eyebrows.

  "I guess I really don't think about it all that much," I say, 
  looking at the lilies. One of the buds has a small droplet at 
  its end, catching the sun that shines through the bay window. 
  "We live together, have lived without killing each other for a 
  couple of years."

  "Maybe I should do the same, this thinking business."

  "Jim, this is kind of weird," I say, smiling. "I always thought 
  you were really a laid-back kind of guy, you know, not really 
  thinking about a lot of things so much."

  "Well, let me tell you something else, Cliff." I'm still 
  surprised that Jim and I have been friends for so long, and how 
  little we really talk about real things, about each other.

  What he says next he says slowly, matter-of-factly, 
  undramatically. "I've never been happy with a girl."




  "Maybe he's gay," Denise says, chopping the onions.

  "What?" I say, sitting on top of the kitchen table. How the hell 
  does she come up with these things?

  She wipes her eyes. "God, these onions are nasty."

  "Care to repeat what you said, Denise?"

  "Don't get so defensive. God, you homophobic men, I tell you. I 
  just said that it's a possibility that he's gay from what you've 
  told me. I always did think of him as a bit flowery."

  "Flowery? Jim?"

  She puts the onions in the ground beef and starts kneading them 
  all together. She looks at me and says, "Goodness, isn't this 
  just getting under your skin? Is this because you knew this to 
  be true but you just couldn't face it yourself?"

  I laugh. "My, haven't we been remembering our Psych 101 lately? 
  Do you have any Sigmund Freud quotes for me now?"

  "Ve must relax," Denise says with an accent that couldn't sound 
  less German, "oont learn to use our sense of judgement."

  "You don't know Jim."

  "Do you?" she asks.

  "I certainly know him better than you."

  "You're not answering my question." Sometimes it sucks to be 
  with a girl who's studying to be a lawyer. I shake my head and 
  look at the salt and pepper shakers, a little farm-boy in 
  overalls and his girl in pigtails. The good old days.

  She comes over and lays a kiss on my forehead. "Can we stop 
  fighting about Jim, Cliff? I was just saying what I felt, okay? 
  I'm sorry if it hurts you." She goes back to the kneading. "I 
  may not know Jim, that's true," she continues, "but whenever I 
  see you guys or hear you guys talking on the phone, you guys 
  talk about nothing but sports or camping. And I know you, you're 
  not the type to gab."

  "Like girls."

  "Yes, if you want to put it that way, like girls. You may think 
  we talk about stupid stuff, but we at least know our friends."

  "God, why is it that whenever we talk about any kinds of 
  relationships that you blow it out of proportion and have to 
  include the entire female race?"

  She smiles at me. "Well, Clifford Johnston, if I can defend the 
  entire female race, I must be able to defend a person in a court 
  of law, huh?"

  Was that meant to be funny, a joke? Her becoming a 
  lawyer--sometimes I think that's all that matters to her.

  At dinner, Denise tries to make conversation, but I put a dead 
  stop to it every time. Eventually, she stops trying, and we 
  finish eating in silence.

  I watch the Mets on SportsChannel while Denise reads John 
  Grisham novels. She's read all of them in the last two days. 
  Even if it's fluffy garbage, I'm amazed at her speed. I'm 
  waiting for the movies. She tells me she's going to bed, and I 
  nod curtly.

  When the Mets finish losing, I turn off the television and go to 
  our bedroom. After brushing my teeth and changing, I slip 
  between the covers, next to Denise.

  "I'm sorry," she says, turning to face me, her voice sounding 
  hollow in the darkness. She puts her hand on my chest. I put my 
  hand on top of hers.

  "It's okay," I say, not knowing ifI mean it or not.

  "I'll tell you what," she says, "I'll set up Jim with Laurie."

  "Laurie," I repeat, the name unfamiliar.

  "She's in my Industrial Labor and Relations class. She's awfully 
  cute, and single. I remember her telling me at lunch the other 
  day that she has never really been happy with a man, in not so 
  many words."

  "Is she a lesbian?" I say, half-jokingly.

  "Very funny. Maybe they can both be unhappy with each other."

  "Or maybe they can both be happy," I say. "Thank you. I'll ask 
  Jim if it's okay."

  "I love you," she says.

  "I guess I love you, too," I want to say, but I don't.




  "So her name is Laurie Craven," I say into the telephone. 
  There's silence in the line. "Hello? You still there, Jim?"

  "Yeah," he says. "Thanks again for the potted lilies, Cliff. 
  They're really starting to grow on me. I never had my own plant 
  before."

  "You're welcome. Anyway, I had Denise talk to Laurie, and she 
  said she was free this coming Saturday. How about it?"

  "I guess so." His voice sounds tired. "I'm still getting over 
  Sandy, though, Laurie does know that, right?"

  "It's just a date, it's not like you're getting married."

  "I just want to make sure."

  "Yes, she knows, she's getting over a guy, too, I think, so you 
  two may have plenty to talk about."

  "Thanks."

  "Her number is 364-7247. You can take it from here?"

  "Of course. Okay, Cliff, gotta go. Thanks again."

  As I put the phone down, Denise walks in the room. She's looking 
  very pretty in black stockings, a modest navy blue skirt, a 
  loose burgundy blouse, and a matching navy blue blazer, complete 
  with shoulder pads, of course. With her auburn hair flowing in 
  thick, luscious curls, she couldn't look any finer, and I tell 
  her so.

  "I know," she says nonchalantly. She throws down the briefcase 
  and lies down on the couch, resting her head on my lap.

  "Tough day at class?" I ask.

  "Had an oral exam today."

  I split her lips with my fingers. "Your mouth looks fine to me."

  She smiles. "I talked to Laurie today. Told her that Jim was 
  going to call her. He is, isn't he?"

  "Yeah," I tell her, a bit annoyed that she didn't bother to wait 
  for Jim's go-ahead, but that's Denise. "I talked to him today. 
  Said it was fine."

  "Good. Let's hope they'll have some fun."

  "Let's hope that we'll have some fun," I say, cradling her in my 
  hands and getting up from the couch. She's too thin for her own 
  good, I think. It's what you get for being an overachiever. I 
  walk to the bedroom, holding her in my arms, her wriggling and 
  laughter driving me on.




  And Saturday passes by, and so does Sunday, and not a call from 
  Jim. When I call him, I get his machine. He's got one of those 
  messages that just say the phone number, leave your name and 
  your phone number and the date, please wait for the tone. I 
  wonder where he is, if things went okay, if they went fantastic, 
  if the two of them eloped together and are splashing in the 
  clear, blue waters of Cancun.

  I call him again on Monday, but again, I get the machine. Denise 
  gets back from the University half past six. By that time, the 
  barbecued chicken is ready. I tell her that I was thinking of 
  visiting Jim after dinner.

  "I talked with Laurie today," she says, ripping into a 
  drumstick.

  "I thought you only had class with her on Thursdays."

  "Yeah, but I saw her on campus today. I wanted to know what 
  happened between her and Jim."

  "So?"

  "She seemed sort of miffed at me. I asked her about Jim, and she 
  said that they weren't right for each other. A chemistry thing, 
  she told me. Bad vibes. I didn't ask further. Didn't look like 
  she wanted me to."

  "I'm definitely going to go see Jim tonight," I say.

  I drive up to Jim's condo after dinner, leaving Denise with the 
  dishes and Scott Turow's _The Burden of Proof_. Now that she's 
  finished with Grisham, she's on to her next victim.

  I ring his doorbell, and again, but there's nobody home, 
  although the living room lights are on. In fact, the lights are 
  a lot brighter than they used to be. Looks like he got another 
  lamp or something. Curious, I go into his balcony and peer 
  inside, through the blinds.

  And I see potted plants everywhere. Lilies. Daffodils. Violets. 
  Mums. Everywhere a pot can sit, it sits. The living room has 
  been transformed into a flower shop.

  I walk around to get to his bedroom window, which has its blinds 
  shut, but I can see three fern branches sticking between the 
  blades. There must be a plant, and probably more than one plant, 
  sitting on the ledge of the window.

  Going around the rest of the condo, I see a pile of lumber, a 
  few two by fours near the side of his garage, bags of concrete, 
  and some other various building material. Jim's car isn't here, 
  so he must be out.

  When I get back home, all I tell Denise is that Jim wasn't 
  there. It's not really any of her business, and she would only 
  shake her head and say, "That Jim, I told you he was flowery."

  I give him a ring the next evening, but all I get is the 
  machine.




  Standing in line, I look at the girl in front of me. From the 
  back, she's cute, short blond hair, wonderfully cut calves, and 
  just the cutest little butt you've ever seen. She's wearing a 
  white button-down shirt and a pair of denim shorts. I look at 
  what she's buying. She has in her hand Grisham's latest book, 
  _The Client_. Denise read that a week ago. I'm here to get 
  Stephen King's newest book on cassette. It passes the time in 
  long car trips.

  "Are you a part of Waldenbooks' Book Club?" the skinny, 
  pimple-faced kid behind the register asks her.

  "I think so," she says, her voice soft and shy, "but I don't 
  have a card or anything." She digs through her purse for a 
  second, then shakes a slow no.

  "I just need your name," he says, his eyes on her cleavage. Who 
  wouldn't?

  "Craven," she says and spells it out, "and first name Laurie. 
  That's spelled with an A and a U, if it helps."

  I hear the guy behind me repeat the name softly, as if to 
  memorize it. Smart man.

  Sure enough, the cashier finds her in the database. She pays for 
  her book and is about to leave, but I stop her.

  "Excuse me?" I say. She turns to face me. Like a doll, I think. 
  She's not someone you would call beautiful, but she would be 
  someone you'd call cute. Big, huge green eyes, button nose, 
  small yet full mouth, and this good-looking with virtually no 
  makeup.

  "Do I know you?" she asks.

  "Not directly, no," I say, getting out of the line. "You can go 
  in front of me," I tell the guy behind me.

  "Wanna switch?" he jokes. I smile and lead Laurie away from the 
  crowd.

  "I think you know Denise Beckwith?"

  "Yeah," she says, a little careful.

  "She's my significant other," I say.

  "You're... Cliff?" I nod. She puts out her hand. "Nice to meet 
  you."

  "Would you like to get some lunch with me? I'll buy."

  She looks a bit hesitant, but says, "Okay. I have to be at 
  aerobics class in about an hour, so I can't eat too much."




  At Friendly's, I order the tuna melt with fries, and she the 
  same. It had been a long time since I'd met anyone new, 
  especially a woman. Being in a relationship sometimes does that 
  to you. Laurie Elizabeth Craven was born in Rome, not the one in 
  Italy but the one in Upstate New York. "Quite different," she 
  said, and although she told me that she had never been to the 
  capital of Italy, she assured me that she had seen pictures. I 
  liked her sense of humor, the way she seemed so free with 
  herself.

  When I look at my watch, it's a quarter before three. "Didn't 
  you say you had to go to aerobics class in an hour? That was at 
  one o'clock." I call the waitress. "I don't want you to miss 
  your class."

  She looks at her watch, too, and slowly nods at me with a 
  contemplative smile. "It's okay," she says.

  The waitress comes over and asks, "Everything okay?"

  "Yes, everything was fine, thank you" I say.

  "No, everything wasn't fine," Laurie says, and the waitress 
  looks at her with some apprehension. "But everything will be 
  after dessert. I'd like to have the Heath Bar Crunch Sundae. How 
  about you, Cliff?"

  "Make that two," I say, smiling.




  "There was a reason behind this lunch," I say, digging into the 
  remains of my sundae with the long-necked spoon.

  "You mean it wasn't just to get to know lil' ol' me?" she says 
  with a Southern belle twang.

  "You went out on a date with a guy named Jim last Saturday."

  She scrunches her eyebrows and says, "I sure did, and boy, was 
  that an experience. The guy was just..." She stops. "He's a 
  friend of yours, I bet. And a good friend."

  I nod.

  "In fact, I bet you're the reason why Denise fixed me up with 
  him."

  I nod again.

  "And you want to know what happened."

  My neck was getting tired.

  "Okay. It's like this. He sounded a little odd on the phone, but 
  we were both a little nervous. He asked me for dinner on 
  Saturday and a concert afterwards, a Chopin recital that was 
  given by a twelve year-old at the JCC. Sounded great--I think he 
  knew him, too."

  "Probably Jason, his cousin. The kid is a prodigy, a genius."

  "So he picks me up in his Maxima, nice car ride, small talk. We 
  go to the Hasbrouk Inn. I love that place. He was cute in there, 
  under that soft, yellow light, I'll give you that, but he seemed 
  sort of distant. I didn't know whether that was just the way he 
  was or something had happened." She sips her glass of water and 
  continues. "Then, the concert. Wonderful. You're right, the kid 
  is a genius. I loved it, but again, Jim seemed sort of distant, 
  like he didn't care. I mean he clapped and he even whispered in 
  my ear a few times during the performance about this part and 
  that, but there was something unreal about it, like he was just 
  going through the motions." Then she stops and scrapes inside 
  her ice cream cup for some sweet stuff she may have missed.

  "So that's why you weren't right for each other. I don't 
  understand women. It's okay to say exactly what the problem is, 
  you know, just comie right out and saying it."

  She looks at me and says, "I'm not finished."

  Suddenly, I'm not sure if I want to hear it. I think back to his 
  living room, all those potted plants.

  "I would have given him a few more chances, had the night ended 
  like that. You don't meet good people that often in this world, 
  and up to that point, I thought Jim was a good person." She 
  pauses. "Then it happened."

  "What?" I say, although I think I know what she's about to say.

  "We went into a flower shop," she says.

  What else?

  "It seemed like a weird thing to do. It was a little before ten, 
  and the shop was about to close. When I asked him why we're 
  going in there, he told me that he wanted to get a pot of 
  tulips. Taking your date to a flower shop and buying a pot of 
  tulips? I thought maybe he wanted to get me some roses or 
  something, which would have been fun and very nice, but tulips?"

  I give her a small shrug. I would have felt weird, too.

  "But that's not all. We go in there and look at some of the pots 
  of flowers, but the next thing I hear is Jim arguing with the 
  cashier. He says something like 'Let me see the manager,' so the 
  girl goes and gets the woman in charge. At this point, I'm 
  hiding behind the display of mums, trying to figure out how to 
  strangle Denise for setting me up with this weirdo. 'You're not 
  taking care of your tulips,' I hear him saying to her. 'And 
  those daylilies need some more shade during the afternoons. They 
  don't like too much sun.' Something like that, and eventually, 
  the manager just agrees to everything, sells him the tulips for 
  half price, and kicks us both out."

  "Strange," I say.

  "He wasn't always like this, I gather."

  "No, not at all."

  "Anyway, on the ride back, I didn't say much. I think he knew 
  that I saw what happened at the flower shop, and he realized 
  that I thought he was weird. We pulled into my driveway, and he 
  said, 'You must think I'm strange.' 'Frankly, yes,' I said. 'I 
  guess people just don't understand,' he said, and he was really 
  sad about this, like I was missing out on something. 'I guess 
  not,' I said, and didn't know what to do next, the silence was 
  really awkward and weird, so I said good night, thanks for a 
  nice evening, and got out of the car."




  I pay for the check. "My treat," I say.

  "Then it will be my treat next time," she says.

  "You got it."

  "Do you and Denise get along?" she asks me as we walk out of the 
  mall and into the bright, cloudless afternoon. We both put on 
  our sunglasses.

  "Why do you ask?" I say.

  "You guys don't seem to be the types who would live together. 
  You guys do live together, right?"

  I nod. "We're different," I say.

  She stops at a red Volkswagon Cabriolet and gets in. Her roof is 
  down. Perfect, I think, as if the car was custom built around 
  her.

  "Something that just occurred to me," she says.

  "What's that?"

  "About your friend Jim. It wasn't that he was distant. No, 
  distant was definitely the wrong word to use."

  "What would be the right word, then?"

  "Love," she says. "He looked as if he was in love, and not with 
  me."

  We look at each other for a moment. I can do this for hours, I 
  think, maybe years.

  "I'm in the book," she says.

  "Craven, Laurie Elizabeth, Laurie with an A and a U," I say.




  From the mall, I go directly to Jim's house. It's a Saturday, 
  he's off from work, there's a good chance that he's home.

  His car is in the driveway, but when I ring the doorbell, nobody 
  answers. Then I hear some noise in the back. I go around to 
  look, and sure enough, it's Jim.

  "Hey Cliff!" he says. "Is this beautiful or what?" It's a slab 
  of concrete, held in place by four wooden dams on each side. "I 
  called you today but no one was in. I'm sorry I haven't returned 
  your calls last week," he says.

  "It's okay. You've been busy, I see." I see some aluminum frames 
  lying against the wall.

  "To say the least." He goes back to what he was doing, pouring a 
  bag of sand into a big container.

  "You're building a greenhouse," I say.

  "You always were smart," he says, laughing.

  "What are you doing now?"

  "Well, I'm done laying down a foundation. The concrete slab is 
  essentially finished, just have to damp-proof it with 
  polyethylene and then lay down the screed."

  "Screed."

  "One part cement, three parts sharp sand. It's like fine-tuning 
  your foundation, to make it nice and smooth. You want a beer? 
  Got a case of Killians yesterday. Need it for this kind of hard 
  work, you know."

  "Jim, what the hell is going on?"

  He pours some water and mixes the sand. "What do you mean?"

  "Don't give me that shit. What's the deal with all the friggin' 
  flowers in the living room, and this," I say, pointing and 
  gesturing with my hands. "You with this sudden flower fetish, 
  all this shit?"

  "Cliff," he says calmly.

  "Yes?"

  "Are you still my friend?"

  "I don't know. Yes. I guess so."

  "Then do me a favor. Leave me alone for about two weeks. By that 
  time this greenhouse will be done."

  "So what's next for you, Jim? Your own TV show?"

  "Go into my fridge, have a beer."

  "I can't find your fridge in the jungle."

  "If you care about me," Jim says evenly, "you are going to leave 
  me alone."

  I stick my hands in my pockets and shake my head.

  "I'll call you," he says.




  Two weeks pass by, and nothing.

  Three weeks. I think about calling him and asking him if he 
  wants to go out, but I'm afraid he may say, "Sorry, Cliff, but 
  I'm watering my plants tonight. You know, I've planned it for 
  weeks now." So I don't.

  Four weeks. Then he calls me.

  "Cliff." He sounds tired.

  "Jim."

  "I'm a bit late, I know. Delays. Took longer than I thought."

  "It's okay."

  "Can you come over?"




  "It's a lean-to greenhouse," Jim says, passing me a bottle of 
  Sam Adams.

  "It's beautiful," I say, and it is. Standing against the south 
  wall, the greenhouse glistens in the sunlight, every windowpane 
  perfectly fitted, not a single sign that says an amateur built 
  it.

  And inside the greenhouse are flowers of every kind and 
  color--I've never seen so much variety.

  "That one," Jim points, at a pink ball of tiny flowers, like a 
  big, fluffy dandelion, "is a flowering onion. Also called 
  allium." Then he points at a bunch of violet colored flowers.

  "Irises," I say, and he nods.

  "Bearded irises. And next to those are tigridias, speckled in 
  the middle?" Red, shaped like a fan blade. Next to those are 
  tulips. Taking your date to a flower shop and buying a pot of 
  tulips?

  "Let's go inside," he says. I wrinkle my nose at the smell of 
  the interior, which is good in some respects but also a bit 
  mildewy. "It's like a girl," Jim says with a wry smile, "perfect 
  and beautiful from the outside, not so blemish-free on the 
  inside."

  "There are those who are quite beautiful in both. Snapdragons!" 
  I say, looking at the pink flowers. "Do you remember..."

  "My mother's garden, and we used to take off the bulbs and make 
  them into little monster jaws."

  "Chasing Susanne and Kimmy with those jaws. That was a long time 
  ago," I say, again reminded of the fact that I've known Jim all 
  my life.

  "But I remember. I also remember my mother's passion for those 
  flowers of hers."

  "Is that where you get it from?"

  "Maybe. Doesn't really matter."

  "Where is that music coming from?" I ask, suddenly aware of 
  Mozart playing softly in the background.

  "Wired up a little system."

  "For the flowers."

  "I plan to work here a lot, and a little music doesn't hurt," he 
  says. I want to tell him you're not answering my question, but 
  that's what Denise would say, so I don't.

  "I met Laurie Craven," I say to him.

  "That's the girl I went out on the date with, right? Denise's 
  friend?" I nod. "You like her?"

  "Yeah," I say.

  "More than Denise," he says, more of a statement than a 
  question.

  "Denise and I have been together for three years."

  It was a perfect opening for The Denise Line, but Jim doesn't 
  say it. Instead he just smiles. "She reminded me a lot of you."

  "Of me?"

  "Yeah. Both of you are on the same level of reality, on the same 
  wavelength, if you know what I mean."

  I nod slowly, sort of understanding what he's saying. "I asked 
  her about your date," I say.

  "Didn't go so hot," Jim says, "God, it seems like so long ago." 
  We are silent for a second, Mozart's melody hanging in the air. 
  I think about asking him what's going on with his life, why he's 
  become Mr. Green Thumb USA after Sandy dumped him, why he 
  suddenly cares more about flowers than anything else, but I 
  don't even know where to start, so I blurt out something that I 
  had been thinking about.

  "Jim, you're not gay, are you?"

  He looks at me, then laughs. "I don't think so, and I should 
  know, I think."

  "I'm serious," I say.

  "Until I start wearing flower-patterned dresses, I think I'm 
  safe."

  I feel stupid for asking him, but I also feel a lot better.

  "I'm going to water those dicentras over there," he says with a 
  grin. "The pump doesn't do a very good job towards the end of 
  the greenhouse, I'm afraid." He gets a small plant waterer from 
  the corner and tends to his flowers. Bleeding hearts, that's 
  what dicentras are, small red, heart-shaped flowers that hang 
  off a long branch, like a bunch of lockets in a line, ripe for 
  picking.

  I watch him pour water into the soil, carefully, like a surgeon. 
  He pats the ground, then adds a little more water. I watch his 
  face, his movements.

  He looked as if he was in love, and not with me, Laurie said. 
  Love. How can he love flowers more than girls like Sandy or 
  Laurie? I don't understand, and wonder if I ever will be able 
  to. But who knows, maybe he'll meet a nice woman gardener, they 
  can talk about bees and how they carry pollen, and the next 
  thing you know they're in the sack together and they can grow 
  beautiful flowers together in their own garden of Eden.

  "You want to help? These bachelor's buttons," he says, pointing 
  at the blue flowers, "can use some water, too."

  "Love to," I say, picking up a pitcher next to the door.

  A Fish Story    by Susan Stern
================================
..................................................................
  * Sometimes it is not personal peril, wisdom, great costs or 
  great gains that motivate us: sometimes it is only the 
  inevitability of change... *
..................................................................

  Once upon a time there were two cities. The people of the cities 
  were great whales. They lived in a bauble worn around the neck 
  of a child and in the flicker between two breaths. They didn't 
  know this, of course.

  The bauble was shaped like a figure-eight laid on its side. A 
  wall of thin crystal separated the two spheres that held the 
  spires of the whales' homes. In one sphere, the whales swam in a 
  clear colorless medium; in the other, the whales flew through 
  blue air. Each group thought its own was much the superior means 
  of getting around, and they quarreled constantly, ranged 
  shouting in tiers before the wall, making the crystal ring and 
  shiver.

  One day the king of the winged people was lounging on his throne 
  of clouds when there was a deferential nose-tap at the door. He 
  nodded his ponderous head at his counselor, who opened the door. 
  A young whale tumbled in. He righted himself and balanced 
  upright on his tail in an attitude of respect. The king (for he 
  was a humane king) waved one gray sail, and the young courier 
  settled into a more comfortable position.

  "Speak," rumbled the king.

  "Sire," began the young courier, "Lord of the High Places, 
  Bringer of the Blue Light, Ruler of the Tall Towers--" The king 
  swished his ailerons (for he was an impatient as well as a 
  humane king). The courier gulped. "Um... et cetera. Sire, the 
  Winged People, the Best People, the People Who Do It _Right,_ 
  have sent me with a compliant. The complaint is this. This is 
  the complaint. In short. The others, the Inferior People, the 
  People Who Swim in the Colorless Void, Who Are Not the Best--"

  "Get to the point," said the king.

  "Er... yes. Anyway. The time has come (the citizens say) to do 
  something about those shouters, those swimmers, those 
  high-voiced criers, who make our days and nights tiresome by 
  yelling at the wall that _they_ are the ones who move by the 
  correct method. When everyone knows what the truth of the matter 
  is. Sire, it cannot be borne!" And the young courier became so 
  passionate that he spouted a stream of rainbow-colored bubbles, 
  which floated delicately into the turquoise air until they burst 
  with a tinkle like the clinking of cordial glasses. The king 
  politely pretended not to notice.

  Now the king had no desire for war, but he knew that his people 
  were getting restless, and a restless people are a dangerous 
  people. So he did not dismiss the sincere young courier 
  immediately.

  "Let us think on it," he boomed, and the floor of the palace 
  trembled. The young courier executed a slow-motion 
  back-somersault and exited. It took him quite some time to calm 
  down afterward, too.

  At the very same time, surprisingly enough, the queen of the 
  finned people was receiving a representative of _her_ subjects. 
  The graceful young messenger was as enthusiastic in espousing 
  her cause as the courier had been in his.

  "...I tell you, Majesty, Ruler of the Great Sea, Mistress of the 
  White Waves, Lady of the Hidden Places--" The queen sighed and 
  fanned one great fin. The messenger swallowed.

  "To sum it up--yes. I have been sent with a petition. This is 
  the petition. The petition is this. The Others, those fliers, 
  those murky-aired floaters, those low-voiced rumblers--"

  "Get on with it," sang the queen.

  "Majesty," cried the young whale earnestly, "they believe that 
  they are better than we! And it is well known that we do things 
  the _correct_ way. (Ask anyone. Anyone at all.) They pollute our 
  currents with their foul assertions. Majesty, it cannot be 
  borne!" And she flushed in the heat and conviction of her 
  beliefs.

  Now the queen in her sphere of water did not want a war any more 
  than the king in his sphere of air. But her people were bored, 
  and a bored people is dangerous people.

  "We shall think on it," she chimed in a voice like a ringing 
  dulcimer. She rose in the water, and her eyes glittered like 
  garnets. The messenger performed a graceful forward somersault 
  and exited. But she couldn't report the royal verdict directly, 
  because she had hyperventilated and needed to catch her breath.

  So in due time, the decision came forth in both spheres: War.

  There was a problem, though, with the war concept, for the 
  whales couldn't reach each other through the crystal wall. The 
  rulers set the counselors (who had never before had an actual 
  task) to working on the dilemma. Privately, they hoped that the 
  whole thing would be forgotten before the old mumblers found a 
  solution.

  No such thing happened, of course. Eventually the counselors 
  announced that they had found the answer.




  "Song?" growled the king.

  "Yes. We have discovered that the low pitch of our voices, while 
  harmless to ourselves and our structures, is damaging to the 
  others when played at high volumes. We have built special 
  amplifiers, and when we all sing into them and aim the sound at 
  the People Who Swim, the vibrations will cause shock waves that 
  will kill the Finned Ones and destroy their city."

  "You are sure about this?"

  "Yes, Sire, Lord of--et cetera. We are sure."




  "Song?" caroled the queen.

  "Yes. We have discovered that the high pitch of our voices, 
  while harmless and in fact pleasing to us, is at high volumes 
  lethal to Those Who Fly. We have built special amplifiers, and 
  when we aim our voices at them..." And so forth.

  Thus it came to pass that on a certain day the whales of the two 
  cities ranked themselves on either side of the crystal 
  wall--wave upon gray wave of them, giants as far as the eye 
  could see. There was a tight silence as though the very air and 
  water held their breath. And then, as it was agreed by the toss 
  of a clamshell that came up pearl-side-out, the people who flew 
  began to sing.

  And the hearts burst in the immense chests of the queen's 
  people; the walls of her city crumbled, and what hearts were not 
  broken by the song itself were broken by the ruin of the 
  shining, miraculous city.

  But the wall did not shatter.

  Then the people who swam were allowed to sing. And their voices 
  pierced the brains of the others like knifeblades of ice, and 
  the winged people turned upon one another and fought as their 
  city tumbled around them.

  But the wall did not break.

  This went on for many months. At length, almost all of the 
  people of the two cities were dead.

  And still the wall stood.

  Finally the king and queen knew that they had to end the 
  destruction. They agreed to send representatives to meet at the 
  wall and pitch their individual voices against each other. The 
  people of the one who survived would be the victors--although 
  they no longer remembered just what they had sought to win.

  The king chose as his champion the young courier--who had grown 
  far older with grief and responsibility than his age would have 
  indicated. The queen chose the young messenger, her smooth skin 
  now lined with worry.

  The day arrived. The courier and the messenger faced each other, 
  their shattered cities and broken people behind them. He was 
  still handsome in his scarred gravity. She was still beautiful 
  in her grace and pride.

  They took a breath.

  They aimed their notes.

  They sang.

  And the two songs together created a song so wonderful, his 
  fundamentals and her harmonics twining like living, flowering 
  vines, that they broke off in astonishment.

  At that moment, the child who wore the bauble lost interest in 
  the toy. She dropped it onto the floor and walked away.

  The crystal wall exploded.

  The worlds were thrown into chaos. The media mixed.

  In that winged second, the messenger thought she was swimming 
  through clear air; and the courier thought that he was flying 
  through blue water.

  And they both knew, with pain, and grief, and the faint, prickly 
  beginnings of hope, that none of it had really mattered, anyway.

  Piggy In The Middle    by Stephen Kingston
============================================

  "Can you smell shit?"

  "Yeah, pig shit." Dan Cooper sniffed deeplyand wrinkled his 
  nose. He pointed in my direction and gasped for breath. "It's 
  coming from over there."

  I pretended to ignore them of course. I had been ignoring them 
  for two weeks now, but things were not blowing over; if anything 
  they were becoming worse.

  I walked past feigning a total ignorance of their very 
  existence, although inside my stomach there was a familiar knot 
  of tension that was not founded on groundless fears. Already 
  there had been both threat and innuendo, as well as the kind of 
  practical jokes that just leave you cold. Yesterday I had 
  arrived in school to find my desk and chair arranged neatly 
  beside the bike sheds. They had left the exercise books out and 
  I spent ten minutes picking them up off the playing fields where 
  the wind had blown them. I have no idea what happened to my 
  English exercise book.

  John Tyler stepped out in front of me, his excess bulk obscuring 
  my view of the road ahead as well as my path. I attempted to 
  detour casually around him but he was not going to stand for 
  that.

  "Where you going then, pig-shit?" he asked. I ignored him. I was 
  not going to answer to anything but my own name.

  He grabbed my shirt collar and it felt like he was going to 
  choke me, but Big John was slow--I knew that--so I swung for 
  him. The problem was that Cooper was ready and he caught my arm, 
  deflecting it away so that I seemed to be feebly punching the 
  air like some weedy toad who had never hit anyone in his life.

  "I asked you a question."

  "Nowhere," I gasped, and now my heart was pounding and I 
  suddenly wanted a pee desperately.

  "How about a little walk with your friends, then."

  My heart sank. Come on lads, I thought, just get it over with. 
  You've been spoiling for a fight for long enough--no need to 
  prolong your wait. Still, I knew that any fight (here or 
  elsewhere) was going to be a one-sided affair. Maybe I could 
  joke my way out of this. Cooper had a sense of humor.

  "You don't want to go for a walk with me. I smell of pig shit." 
  I tried to smile as I spoke, but all I managed was a warped 
  grimace. Dan laughed though, and John smiled a little. Maybe I 
  was in with a chance yet.

  "Too right you do. Thanks to you my brother's going to court. 
  Did you hear that? They're gonna charge him."

  I had known, of course, and I should have been a little more 
  careful about going out today. Maybe if I kept my head down for 
  a few more weeks, things might have calmed down enough so that 
  life might just have gone back to normal.

  The thing was, the whole school knew I was a grass now and not 
  one of them would lift a finger to stop Tyler (or anyone else 
  for that matter) from giving me a kicking.

  It was like that in our area. Not just among the kids, mind--the 
  adults too. Some bloke had been shouting abuse at me just the 
  day before, and the woman from next door had been going on at 
  mum about how she would have slung her son out if he didn't know 
  how to keep his mouth shut. As I walked along the street women 
  pointed and stared, then they would ignore me. Except that in 
  doing so they were so theatrical it was as if they had tapped me 
  on the shoulder and said that was what they were doing.

  The only person in our street who was still speaking to me at 
  all was Mr. Singh from the newsagent's, and that was probably 
  only because it was his shop that Tyler's brother was robbing 
  when I called the police. Even Mr. Singh broke off his 
  conversation with me when Mary-Ella Edwards came into the shop, 
  turning up her nose at me as if I were something dragged from 
  the gutter and she was the Queen. He just served me then, taking 
  my money and giving me nothing more then a gruff "There's your 
  change."

  Oh, I regretted that call. Of all the telephone calls I ever 
  made in my life that had to be the stupidest. Mum had said how I 
  had done the right thing, but I could tell from the way she said 
  it that she would never have done it herself. She was saying I 
  was good and honest but she was thinking I was just plain 
  stupid--a trait inherited from my father no doubt.

  Now I had been just as stupid in walking slap-bang into Tyler. I 
  suppose I had thought he would never dare do anything to me in a 
  public street, but that was stupid too, because there was not 
  one person in this street who would admit a thing to the police 
  even if Tyler stabbed me on their doorstep and then knocked on 
  their door to return the knife.

  Now Tyler wanted me to come with him, and there was not much 
  choice about it. I could run to the nearest doorway and beg to 
  be let in, but I could guarantee they were going to be out. 
  People in this street would be out to me even if they were in.

  So I went with Tyler--and that was stupidest thing of all, 
  because at least if I had waited in the street and been beaten 
  up then eventually someone would give an anonymous call to the 
  ambulance service, or perhaps mum would see what was going on 
  and call the police. I should have just let him do his worst, 
  but instead I allowed myself to be taken to the gasworks.

  They were all there waiting too. I don't know how long they must 
  have been waiting, or how they could be so sure that I would 
  turn up, but somehow they knew. There was Matt Tyler, out on 
  bail with three of his skinhead friends and all their current 
  girlfriends. Elaine Cooper and two of her friends stood a little 
  apart with a group of boys from my year in school, and as soon 
  as I arrived they all began to cheer.

  They formed a circle around me, and I found myself staring at 
  Elaine. She was tall for her age, with her ginger hair cropped 
  short and a ring through her nose. Dan had once told me how she 
  would pick bogeys from the inside of that nose ring and flick 
  them at him when he managed to annoy her (which was often 
  enough). That was when Dan and I had been friends, which did not 
  seem like all that long ago.

  "Take your clothes off."

  I looked at her, aghast, but Elaine was not someone you messed 
  with. Still I did not comply--if they wanted the pleasure of 
  seeing me unclothed then they were damned well going to have to 
  take them off themselves, and I said as much.

  "Take your fucking clothes of or else I'll kick your genitals 
  into your larynx."

  "I bet you've been practicing that expression all day." It 
  seemed like I was never going to learn common sense--at least 
  not before these people prematurely ended my life. Elaine was 
  livid--probably the more so because I was right. She gripped my 
  shirt and tore it open. Several buttons popped off and I heard 
  the tearing of fabric. If I wanted any clothes left I had better 
  comply, so I removed the shirt and my watch, shoes and socks.

  As I pulled of my belt there came a tittering from the people 
  behind me, but I was concentrating on Elaine, who had barely 
  calmed herself. Her cheeks were flushed a deep pink and she 
  looked like she was about to bite me or something. I hesitated 
  before undoing the button on my jeans until Elaine moved a step 
  towards me. Then I had them down around my ankles so quickly 
  that Dan roared with laughter. Little runt--just wait. I'd have 
  him for this.

  The laughter calmed Elaine a bit, and she stepped back again, 
  enjoying, I'm sure, the feeling of having power over someone. I 
  stepped out of my jeans and stood there in my boxer shorts with 
  their stupid "Roger Rabbit" design printed all over, and my 
  cheeks burned with shame.

  "Did I say stop?"

  No. But I was not going any further. I shivered--not so much 
  from the cold (although it was cold), but more from fear or 
  hatred--I'm not sure which. They had had their fun now, and I 
  was not going to give them any cheap thrills.

  Then one of the skinheads wrapped an arm around me and pulled my 
  head back by the chin while Elaine pulled off my shorts.

  I covered myself with my hands as they all laughed at me. Oh, 
  hilarious I thought, but I could not stop the burning in my 
  cheeks or the liquid forming in my eyes.

  There was a click and a whir behind me and the crowd laughed 
  louder. Julia Day had a camera and was putting it to good use. I 
  tried to turn my face away from her, as if that made much 
  difference.

  "Stay still and give us a nice pose." There was no damned way I 
  was going to do anything of the sort and I turned away but Matt 
  grabbed me and pulled my right arm behind me in a half-nelson. 
  He was none to gentle and I shouted (or maybe screamed) with the 
  agony. He pulled my left arm back as well; Julia shot off 
  several more pictures before he let me go, and I allowed myself 
  to fall to the ground.

  Matt kicked me then--from behind, his foot landing in the back 
  of my knee and I definitely screamed then. I tried to curl up 
  into a little ball, exposing as little of me as possible, but no 
  more blows landed. Instead, the jeering mob moved away, 
  apparently satisfied.

  I didn't dare move for a couple of minutes, but then I uncurled 
  myself and surveyed the area through tear-stained eyes. I was 
  blubbering now. (It's not as if I will cry at the slightest 
  provocation, but the shock and the humiliation as well as the 
  pain in my leg was enough to set anyone off and I could not 
  control my sobbing.) I found my clothes, all except the boxer 
  shorts, which they no doubt kept as some kind of trophy. My 
  shirt was ripped around the button holes, and mum was not going 
  to be pleased--that was a fairly new shirt.

  I dressed quickly and then started for home when I saw Dan 
  sitting a little way off, not looking entirely happy--and more 
  then a little guilty. I changed direction, but Dan leaped to his 
  feet and caught up with me.

  "Elaine can be such a prat, you know."

  Yeah, sure. I thought. Too bad that she has a prat for a brother 
  too, but I just stayed quiet.

  "I didn't know about this, you know."

  "You're such a fucking liar." I shouted. I didn't really mean to 
  shout, but I didn't seem to have much control over my voice and 
  it was probably a bit squeaky too.

  "Yeah--okay, so I knew some of it. But honest, I didn't know 
  they were gonna have a camera, and no one was supposed to hurt 
  you."

  So what? Did Dan have any idea of what I had just been through? 
  How could I show myself in school on Monday? By then everyone 
  would know what had happened--and they would have the photos to 
  prove it. It was bad enough having everyone hate me, but now 
  they would all despise me. I could imagine the taunts now, only 
  I decided it was better if I did not.

  "Look, Tom, I admit that was a fart-arsed idea. I'm sorry I had 
  anything to do with it. Come on, give me a break, will you?"

  And being a total moron, and pretty weak-willed too, I did. In 
  fact, that was inevitable from the moment he started talking to 
  me again. Having no friends at all for a couple of weeks 
  certainly provides plenty of incentive to do whatever you can to 
  restore a previous friendship. We walked home, talking about TV 
  and the latest films at the cinema, and acting for all the world 
  as if the last half hour had never happened.




  Things were bad on Monday, but not so very bad. Dan was talking 
  to me, and he seemed willing to stick by me when the kids from 
  our year were jeering and calling me a fairy. Someone had hung 
  my boxer shorts from one of the netball posts, but Mr. Enright 
  removed them during first period and gave them back to me.

  I'm not sure if I would rather that he had held onto them, 
  because when I realized that he knew who they belonged to, I 
  knew that he probably had half an idea about how they had made 
  their way up there, too.

  I swallowed my pride and thanked him, stuffing them into my bag, 
  just before Dan came running up to me.

  "Tom, I've got some news."

  "Yeah?"

  "I know where the photos are."

  Well, great. So what? I'm sure I'd rather not know.

  "Julia got them developed at her chemist's and now she's left 
  them in the shop. I heard her telling Elaine. She's well pissed 
  off, 'cos she hasn't had the chance to show them to anyone yet."

  That might just qualify as good news, just so long as the 
  apocalypse happened before next Thursday's late-night shopping, 
  but surely it only postponed the inevitable. Julia worked in the 
  chemist's on weekends only, but she would only have to pop in on 
  Thursday to pick up the photos. Then I really would be the 
  laughingstock of the school.

  "Don't you see?" Dan was getting so excited now it made me want 
  to punch him--speaking to me as if I were some retard, totally 
  unable to comprehend the simplest of notions. He just wasn't 
  making any sense. "All we have to do is go get them tonight. 
  Julia won't be able to get them herself. Just so long as we do 
  it quick, we can be away with the piccies before anyone sees 
  'em."

  "What makes you so bloody sure she isn't going there tonight?"

  Dan gave me such a smug smile that I nearly did hit him, but I 
  restrained myself as he produced a key from his pocket. I raised 
  an eyebrow and he laughed.

  "I nicked it out of her school bag. The shop closes at five, so 
  she'd need a key by the time she got there--and I've got hers."

  Sometimes Dan could be a deceitful little rat, I decided. And I 
  smiled too.




  We met up after school by the corner shop and took the bus into 
  town. It was after seven and there was a drizzly rain falling, 
  but the town was still fairly full of people, even down this end 
  away from the main shopping precincts. We decided to go bowling 
  first and I paid for Dan because he was being such a mate. We 
  had two games and Dan thrashed me in them both, although I 
  certainly wasn't on form--I could not even scrape a hundred in 
  my second game. I guess I was too nervous about what we were 
  going to do later on.

  It was not as if we were going to do anything strictly 
  illegal--I mean, obviously we were breaking into the shop--but 
  we were not going to damage anything, nor were we going to steal 
  anything. That is to say, we were not going to steal anything 
  from the shop, at least.

  All the same, I was nervous. No, more then nervous--I was scared 
  stiff, and after losing a second game I suggested we go to 
  McDonald's and get something to eat. I was just trying to 
  postpone the moment when we broke into the shop.

  Chewing a Big Mac, I suggested to Dan that maybe the photographs 
  were just not worth the effort. Maybe we should just go home and 
  let Julia do her worst. Dan pulled a face at that suggestion.

  "If you think I'm sticking around with you while a bunch of 
  photographs of 'Fairy Tom' do the rounds, you've got another 
  think coming. I've got a reputation to keep, y' know?"

  "Oh come on Dan, it's not such a big deal. I mean--breaking into 
  a shop--that's criminal."

  "And don't you just know it."

  That was below the belt, and I clammed up. Matt Tyler had been 
  thieving. What he had done was just plain wrong, and he was only 
  doing it to pay for dope. No one seemed to appreciate this. I 
  was the guilty party in everyone's eyes because I had reported 
  him--that really pissed me off.

  "Oh come on, Tom. Thirty seconds and we'll be in and out, and 
  you can forget the photos ever got taken. It'll be all right... 
  just thirty seconds."

  "Yeah, I suppose."




  We eventually got thrown out of McDonald's, and now it was half 
  past nine. The town center was still half full of people, 
  especially so near the pubs, but as we walked to the chemist's 
  the crowd thinned out to nothing.

  "Here goes nothing." Dan inserted the key and the door swung 
  open. "Behind the counter--by the till. That's what Julia said."

  I ran to the counter and reached over by the till. In the half 
  light of the night lighting I could just make out an envelope 
  that could well contain photographs, so I picked it up. I was 
  about to check the contents when Dan whispered frantically from 
  the door.

  "Quick. Someone's coming."

  I stuffed the envelope into my inside jacket pocket and ran for 
  the door. Dan pulled it shut and removed the key.

  "Got them?"

  "Yes." I whispered. Why were we whispering? There was no one 
  around. Where was the person that Dan said was coming?

  I moved a few meters up the road to look down a side street, but 
  there was no one there at all.

  Suddenly there was the sound of breaking glass, and I turned, 
  startled. The glass door of the chemist's shop was broken just 
  by the lock. Suddenly I could hear blood roaring in my ears and 
  my heart was thumping so hard it was painful.

  "Run!" Dan shouted and I complied willingly enough. We ran up 
  the high street and down Princess street. Dan rushed into the 
  King's Hall amusements and I followed.

  We stopped now in the smoky half-darkness and I held onto a 
  fruit machine as I gasped for breath. The arcade stank of smoke 
  and sweat, although it was nearly empty. I looked around and 
  nearly wet my pants.

  "Like a lamb to the slaughter." Matt Tyler jeered. I was 
  speechless. There they all were--John, Matt and Elaine. Dan had 
  at once joined their company, gathered around a machine where 
  John was concentrating on losing all his money. He seemed quite 
  happy to have met them too.

  "Took your bloody time. This place closes in twenty minutes." 
  Julia remonstrated with him.

  "Not my fault. He wanted to eat first."

  "How does it feel to have committed a criminal offence, then, 
  Carter?"

  It felt bloody awful, and it was feeling worse every second. 
  What were they doing here waiting for me? "Dan, what have you 
  done?"

  Dan looked a bit uneasy, but his answer was all the more cocky 
  for any guilt he might be feeling. "Nothing more then you 
  deserve, pig shit."

  "Yeah, that's right." Matt picked up, "You're so ruddy green you 
  never even thought about the security camera did you?"

  Shit.

  "And the pigs know your face too. Even if it takes 'em a few 
  days, they'll soon recognize your snotty little mug.

  "What's more, if they don't put two and two together, you never 
  know who might tip them off. After all, you don't know how to 
  keep your mouth shut, so why shouldn't anyone else grass on 
  you?"

  "This ain't fuckin' fair, you bastards. You know I didn't steal 
  nothing."

  "Tough shit. And you did steal something, didn't you?"

  The question was asked of me, but Matt looked to Dan for 
  confirmation. Dan nodded and the older boy broke into a big 
  grin.

  I was about to turn tail and run, but Tyler stirred himself from 
  his machine long enough to grab me by the arms, while Dan 
  reached in and removed the packet from my inside pocket, doing 
  so ever so carefully, as if he were afraid to touch it. He 
  placed it in my hands.

  "Open it."

  I opened the envelope, and suddenly I wanted to puke. Instead of 
  photographs there was a small wodge of notes held together by an 
  elastic band.

  "The notes from tomorrow's float. Probably about thirty pounds." 
  Julia explained.

  "Well, that's theft and criminal damage as far as I can see. And 
  I nearly forgot--Dan's been with us since you came out of 
  bowling. You had a bust-up with him, you see, since you're such 
  a bad loser. Then he came with us and went to see a film." And 
  they even produced the tickets to prove it.

  "So Danny-boy has a watertight alibi. He isn't on the security 
  camera 'cos he stayed by the door, so you're in deep shit, and 
  no one's gonna dig you out."

  With that John let me go. They turned and started walking away; 
  all except Matt. He moved his face close to mine--so close I 
  could smell stale meatballs and beer on his breath.

  "Just think of it as a second chance. You take the rap like a 
  man, and we'll forget what a fuckin' scumbag you really are. 
  Don't try dropping any of us in it, 'cos the pigs ain't never 
  going to get enough evidence to bring any charges against us.

  "Keep quiet, take what's coming to you, and we leave you alone. 
  Deal?"

  I looked at him with utter hatred. They had dug me into a hole 
  and they were right--there was no way out. I wanted to cry, but 
  I couldn't. Not yet. I had to wait for him to go away.

  Oh, go away Matt. Fuck off and get out of my life. But he wasn't 
  finished yet.

  "Deal?" He asked again, a little louder this time.

  I loathed the sight of the zitty bastard. What could I do? Take 
  the rap? It would be my first offense; it was not as if I was 
  going to get locked up or anything. At least then the taunts 
  might stop. Maybe I'd get some street cred too. Maybe I could 
  say that was why I did it.

  Maybe everyone would just call me a rat-arsed hypocrite.

  Shit. Mum was going to kill me.

  "Deal?"

  "Deal."

  TimeBugs    by Carolyn L Burke
================================
..................................................................
  * In the same way no two people agree on everything, no two 
  clocks march to the same beat. *
..................................................................

  Once, the stars could be seen to be moving farther apart, where 
  the scale of mountain erosion was comparatively slow. Such time 
  had ceased to be meaningful as the world created by watching 
  observers relativistically sped up. Geometric growth had its 
  advantages--as an antidote to the static feeling of progress and 
  change for those jaded by a linear approach to curiosity. But as 
  this velocity became an acceleration, becoming geometric, 
  earning a potential logarithmic future, galactic time slowed. 
  The heavens, once a bright, vibrant and alluring clockwork, were 
  no longer a series of temporal gateposts for the aware. And with 
  contralto echoes of amusement, spideric voices could be heard, 
  if listeners could still have listened, greeting each other out 
  of time.

  What did bugs circle around before they had porchlights?

  The stars!




  I brushed the bug away as it aimed for the glowing luminescence 
  of the light. My sudden noticing of the digital watch brought to 
  mind a time without such progressive timepieces.

  My parents would talk about the days when television was a radio 
  perched high upon the bureau, with all the neighbors gathering 
  each evening to listen. The new mantleclock, state of the art, 
  chattered noisily through all the comedic monologues, hushing 
  only for news.

  That clock announced for all to notice that time was present. 
  Its ticking complemented the internal rhythms of the staticy 
  voices, a necessary ingredient for the enthrallment. With the 
  sign off, leaving only the wooden planks of the porch railing 
  and each other, the group would disperse mumbling about what 
  time took away. The clock stoically endured the responsibility 
  for their dimly encroaching awareness of tomorrow's routines, 
  where the radio was a forgotten pleasure dream.

  Time is constructed, it seems, of those unaware moments of 
  relaxation and escape, where each moment is strung on an 
  infinite cord in one linear row or column of life, and where 
  each person strives to wrap that cord tightly around their 
  fragile neck as a safety line for when they jump. And for a few, 
  those with the nerve to stare directly into the eyes of their 
  own self-worth, time stands still.

  I glimpsed the bug hovering near the crystal again. I shewed it 
  away with a Wittgensteinian flourish.

  My mind wandered back to my sister. It had been a hot day and 
  the two of us had hidden in the basement, cooling our 
  imaginations. A spider was crawling up the wall. It was one of 
  those compact tiger spiders that always stuck to the screen door 
  in the summer. They would jump whole inches at a time if you 
  bothered them. And this one had a fascination for the cheap 
  gold-chromed wall clock.

  It was climbing right up to the clock's rim, its bumpy edge a 
  remnant of the chromed coronal spiking my mother had disallowed 
  as too tacky. In it went. We giggled as little girls often do, 
  as we created a wonderous magical temple of a spider city 
  occupied once again by its goddess.

  Time ticked. And yet, it seemed to us that in no time at all the 
  clock started convulsing, every third tick louder, more 
  staccato. The second hand moved counter to clockwise, sucking 
  back the future, returning the day to its source. The spider 
  never emerged, but the clock's burdens were gone from its twelve 
  humped shoulders. How often will the ghost in the machine be a 
  spider? How often is the future merely yesterday's regurgitation 
  of last year?

  Most of my memories in time are of my childhood, my family. In 
  the present, I let the bugs wear my watch, where they beat the 
  milliseconds out with wings, where the nano-ants continue the 
  count with no end. I let the bugs remember.

  I remember that back then, amongst the minute men, I used time 
  to look the other way. Always in a hurry to be on time, in time 
  for a scheduled and measured period of interaction, counting the 
  minutes as hours in the glow of impassioned and well-orderd 
  mindlessness--the endless variety of timed wastes continued on, 
  as if suggested to all of us subliminally by a forgotten spirit, 
  tired, subconscious and hungry to consume meaning. Yes, my 
  family knew the value of a second.

  In the glow of my watch, I can still hear the radio-static 
  wing-beats of my life.

  There was a time when all events happened eternally. They 
  occurred sequentially, I'm sure, and yet no record was kept, no 
  attempt to glean ordering, to create history. I glance at my 
  watch. I glance away again. Maybe next year I will be able to 
  remember the bugs again.
