  FirstText: Thank You, Thank You Very Much   by Jason Snell
============================================================
  
  Five years ago I was news editor of the UCSD Guardian, and 
  apparently I had too much time on my hands, because in addition 
  to taking a full load of upper-division courses, I was busy 
  writing fiction and getting it published on the Internet. The 
  end of 1990 was one of the busiest times of my life, because for 
  10 weeks the powers-that-be at the Guardian decreed that we'd 
  publish the paper three times a week, instead of the traditional 
  two. It didn't last very long -- we managed to pull it off, 
  tired though we were, but the advertising wasn't there to 
  support the paper costs of that extra edition.

  But in the midst of that, I got word that Jim McCabe's Athene 
  was closing up shop, and I was crazy enough to take it upon 
  myself to start a new online magazine on this thing that was 
  sucking up more and more of my spare time: the Internet. Even 
  when prompted with the news that two other people, Geoff Duncan 
  and Phil Nolte, had also offered to take over Athene from Jim, I 
  didn't drop it. Instead, I contacted Geoff and Phil and we 
  proceeded to start working on what would become InterText.

  I can honestly say I didn't know what I was getting myself into. 
  When I do something, I do it until it's done -- but I really 
  never considered that since publishing a magazine is an endeavor 
  with no logical ending, there would never be an end. So now five 
  years have passed since that day in late March where I mailed 
  out Vol. 1 No. 1 of InterText from my Macintosh SE (complete 
  with 2400 baud modem) in my on-campus apartment. The day I 
  graduated from UCSD and lost my free college Internet account 
  came and went, but that artificial "end" to InterText passed 
  without any change. By then, I had decided to go to graduate 
  school at UC Berkeley, and by the time my access from San Diego 
  would expire, I'd have a new account in Berkeley. InterText 
  lived on.

  And before I graduated from Berkeley, I had already taken a 
  full-time job at MacUser magazine, a publication that obviously 
  provided Net access. InterText lived on. Now the Internet is a 
  common concept -- a word familiar to people born before there 
  was such a thing as an _airplane_. Bookstores are overflowing 
  with Internet books, but when I started InterText I had to learn 
  how to mail the magazine and transfer files through 
  word-of-mouth.

  I'm glad to say that in addition to the Net getting bigger over 
  the years, the stories we've printed in InterText have improved 
  greatly. Though there are some stories from that first year of 
  InterText I still enjoy, they can't hold a candle to the ones we 
  printed just two years later. Because we're not in a position to 
  pay our writers (I hope that changes sometime in the next five 
  years -- preferably sooner, not later), there are many who have 
  stopped appearing in our pages because they've moved on to 
  greener pastures. But there are always new writers who appear 
  and manage to amaze us with their ability.

  In the last five years I've had the pleasure to work with a lot 
  of remarkable people. First and foremost, I have to thank Geoff 
  Duncan. Geoff and I worked together on InterText more than three 
  years before we met in person. Without him, this magazine 
  wouldn't be half of what it is now. Any time I've gotten 
  complacent, stuck in a rut, or lost sight of what we should be 
  doing, Geoff's been there to nudge me in the right direction. 
  His good taste in stories has drastically improved the stories 
  we've printed. He's our Editor With An Art Degree, our 
  renaissance hacker, and he is so integral to so many steps in 
  our editorial process that I can't envision doing InterText 
  without him.

  The two other people involved in InterText editorially also 
  deserve a lot of credit. Phil Nolte was there at the start to 
  offer advice, support, and material. And a while ago Geoff 
  Duncan brought in one of his colleagues, Susan Grossman, as an 
  assistant editor. Her skill as an editor has vastly elevated the 
  quality of every single story that has appeared in this magazine 
  since her arrival.

  I'd also like to give my appreciation to Jeff Quan -- the former 
  graphics editor of that selfsame UCSD Guardian -- for 
  illustrating our very first cover and for illustrating countless 
  covers since then, up to this very issue. Jeff's the very best. 
  Without him we'd be running pictures of stick figures on our 
  cover. (You think I'm kidding? You haven't see me draw.)

  And finally, I'd like to thank the thousands of InterText 
  readers, especially those who have written stories for us. 
  You've helped make InterText what it is today.

  Who knows what the future holds? The Internet will be 
  unrecognizable five years from now. But no matter how much 
  full-motion video and interactive adventure games flood the Net, 
  there will still be a place for stories, for simple scratchings 
  on a cave wall or tales told in hushed voices around a campfire. 
  And so there will always be a place for something like this 
  magazine.

  InterText lives on.

  Their Turn  by Past InterText Contributors
============================================
...................................................................
  A few past InterText writers contribute their thoughts on the 
  occasion of our fifth anniversary.
...................................................................


  Greg Knauss (knauss@netcom.com)
---------------------------------

  It was in the offices of the Guardian, UC San Diego's one stab 
  at a semi-legitimate campus newspaper, that Jason Snell first 
  approached me about contributing to this fiction magazine he had 
  an idea for. He was an editor with far too much time on his 
  hands and I was a hanger-on who had found the one place on 
  campus inhabited by people with even fewer social skills than 
  myself.

  InterText, he was going to call it, because it would only be 
  distributed over the Internet. This was actually a fairly 
  radical idea at the time, as the Internet in 1990 wasn't much 
  more than a way for college nerds to play elaborate pranks on 
  each other. The idea of writing stories -- original, unique 
  stories -- for such a medium was something only a lonely 
  Communication major could conceive. At the time, I was editing a 
  small pamphlet of short stories called The Erratically, and it 
  was from back issues that I gathered up some stories that packed 
  -- packed, I tell you! -- two or three pages in the first 
  InterText.

  Truthfully, I didn't think InterText would go anywhere, or much 
  of anywhere. I was having a hell of a time keeping The 
  Erratically coming out on any sort of schedule and it was only 
  two eight-and-a-half by eleven pages, folded over. A full thirty 
  pages or so of fiction, every other month? **I** certainly 
  couldn't do it.

  But Jason could, and the Internet could. And still are. Amazing.

  InterText, near as I can tell, is the best, most consistent 
  source for fiction available online. Five years is a lifetime on 
  the Internet and a lot has happened. Now deep pockets are being 
  emptied in countless attempts to recreate what really only takes 
  a mailing list and a good idea. InterText may have more 
  competition now, but the quality, the originality, and the 
  simple fortitude of the magazine is as strong as it ever was. I, 
  as a reader, owe Jason, Geoff, and Susan a huge debt.

  Oh, and just for the record, that goofy line in a teensy-tiny 
  font at the end of every issue? Jason stole that from The 
  Erratically.

  Levi Asher (brooklyn@netcom.com)
----------------------------------

  If you walk into the computer section of a bookstore these days, 
  you'll probably find entire shelves devoted to books about the 
  Internet. Well, I remember when there was exactly _one_ book 
  about the Internet, and at the time one seemed like plenty.

  The book was Ed Krol's The Whole Internet Catalog (published by 
  O'Reilly & Associates). I bought it in late 1993 after becoming 
  an early victim of what would soon become a common malady: total 
  senseless addiction to email and newsgroups. I figured I'd try 
  to learn more about the Internet to lessen my devotion to the 
  newsgroups I was spending all my time in (at the time, 
  rec.music.gdead, rec.music.dylan, alt.tv.twin-peaks and 
  alt.barney.dinosaur.die.die.die).

  The book listed a few notable sites in an appendix, and I 
  noticed it had exactly one entry for literary fiction: a 
  magazine called InterText. An FTP address was listed, and I 
  proceeded to spend the next several weeks trying to retrieve an 
  issue of InterText>. Things were not so easy in late '93. The 
  major problem was that I had no FTP access at my job, but it 
  took me a while to realize that. I finally found a friend who 
  knew how these things worked, and he snuck an ASCII copy of 
  InterText into my directory. I then lurked in the vicinity of 
  the company printer for a few hours waiting for a moment when I 
  could print 30 pages of text without being noticed. I thought I 
  found a time, ran back to my cube to print, and two minutes 
  later received an angry phone call from an assistant 
  vice-president: "What is this crap you're printing?"

  The moral of this part of the story is: the World Wide Web 
  really did need to be invented. But the reason I'm writing this 
  is to thank Jason Snell, Geoff Duncan and the other folks at 
  InterText for pioneering the medium of contemporary online 
  fiction. The important fact is not so much that they did it, but 
  that they did it with such a sense of quality. The work 
  published in InterText is good -- very good. There's a quirky 
  intelligence behind almost every piece, and a pleasant focus on 
  down-to-earth human experience and "regular folks" that's a nice 
  break from the dark, nasty, cyber-heavy stuff that is often 
  thought of as the only kind of writing "computer people" like.

  Most of all, there's solid editorial attention behind InterText. 
  It takes nerve, sometimes, to do a good job at something, and I 
  bet there were moments, back in the early days of InterText, 
  when Jason and Geoff wondered why they was working so hard at a 
  project this uncertain, this time-intensive, this devoid of 
  profit motive. By forging ahead and producing a high-quality 
  online magazine, Jason and company set a standard that is still 
  being followed. Now there are countless venues offering fiction, 
  poetry and literary experimentation on the Internet and the Web, 
  and if all the purveyors of these venues were not directly 
  inspired by InterText (as I was), they were probably inspired by 
  somebody who was.

  A final note: by the time InterText published my first story, I 
  had my own FTP access and endeavored to retrieve the PostScript 
  edition instead of plain vanilla ASCII. Only then did I discover 
  what InterText was supposed to look like, and only then did I 
  realize how much work obviously went into producing it. I wrote 
  to Jason that if I'd known how serious this thing was I wouldn't 
  have had the nerve to submit anything to it. Luckily for me, I 
  didn't know.

  Jason, Susan and Geoff: Keep up the great work! Happy 
  anniversary, and let there be many more.

  Colin Morton (morton@gloria.cord.edu)
---------------------------------------

  The other day one of my manuscripts came back in the mail from a 
  print anthology -- a well-known publication that doesn't need a 
  plug from me.

  In a familiar tone, the editors thanked me for contributing to 
  their anthology, explained that they had received an 
  overabundance of good work, far more than they had room to 
  print, apologized for holding my story so long before returning 
  it, and encouraged me to send something new for their next 
  annual volume.

  The only thing extraordinary about this latest rejection letter 
  was that I sent them the manuscript two years ago. More than a 
  year ago, after giving those tardy editors up for dead, I 
  decided to send the story to InterText, where it appeared a 
  month or two later.

  No doubt many writers can tell similar stories. As publishing in 
  print becomes a more expensive and more perilous enterprise, 
  both writers and readers are rapidly discovering in cyberspace a 
  wide open frontier for exploration and innovation.

  "Crown Jewels," a science fiction story, was a bit of a 
  departure for me. I usually write mainstream and literary 
  fiction and poetry. But in those fields, too, the Internet has 
  both expanded the shelves of my personal library and put my work 
  within reach of many more potential readers.

  My mainstream novel Oceans Apart was published last May by 
  Quarry Press, a small literary publisher that doesn't have the 
  profile to get its books stocked by Barnes and Noble. Most of 
  the bookstores that did order Oceans Apart have already taken it 
  off the shelves to make room for the new season's titles.

  But for as long as the Internet lasts, readers and browsers will 
  be able to sample the excerpts from my book that appeared last 
  summer in the e-zine Gruene Street. Or the poems included in 
  Tender is the Net, an anthology put together by CREWRT-L, the 
  creative writing mailing list I belong to. Or any of the other 
  works I've collected on my home page.

  The Internet has changed the way I look at my computer and the 
  way I look at my world. For that reason it has probably changed 
  my writing too -- not that I've yet tried to create in 
  hypertext.

  The stimulating friends I've made here have changed my life in 
  ways even more profound than the fact that one of them offered 
  me my current job. And I know those changes are permanent and 
  accelerating. Thanks to the Net, I travel more, meet more people 
  face-to-face, and see into the lives of a greater range of my 
  fellow humans than ever before.

  InterText has been a part of those changes. Congratulations on 
  being one of the first settlements on this limitless frontier.

  Carolyn Burke (clburke@passport.ca)
-------------------------------------

  InterText published a short story of mine two years ago. That 
  experience changed my attitude about both writing and 
  publishing. After that story ran in InterText, I learned that 
  writing and allowing others to read what I wrote could be 
  incredibly fun and exciting. I took it up full time as a 
  consequence of that one story.

  Just over a year ago, I started a Web site called "Carolyn's 
  Diary" (<http://carolyn.org/%7Eclburke/Diary.html>) and have 
  been writing an electronic diary since then. This is not a 
  simple travelogue of my life, but rather the philosophical and 
  psychological reflections on life as seen and experienced by me.

  "Carolyn's Diary" has been quite well received, leading to 
  positive reviews from Web site-rating services, mentions in 
  Internet books, and even mentions on television programs about 
  the Internet.

  My experience with InterText was crucial in making this project 
  happen. Thanks, all of you!

  Gone   by Ellen Terris Brenner
================================


The adults, with their need for steadfast solids
Have to resort to vast built structures
To pull off the trick, to contain the chaos.
And that's not bad, in its own narrow way.
The trip that brought me here, with Papa,
Was on such a ship, and it was a wonder:
A star-Leviathan with a sun in its belly,
Bearing a thousand soft souls in its cells
As it swam the dimensional seas.

They fear to let you too near to the chaos.
But I stood, girl-face pressed to the viewscreen,
As we made the jump to the higher regions
And I saw not chaos, but order.
The cosmos revealed its weft to young eyes,
Each thing twined through every other.
I swung out in that net in a widening arc.
I could have jumped, myself, into hyperspace then
And been gone.

Two years later, it's Papa who's gone,
Borne to some business by another starship
While I wait for him on this planet of grasses,
Rank coarse grass that, if it were Terra,
You'd expect near an ocean; but no ocean appears.
Two years is a long time marooned.

I remember the trick that was played that day,
The order-in-chaos I saw in that screen.
So simple a dance; shall I do it now?
There are none here to hold me, much else that calls me.
I look around at the sealess sea of grasses
And they appear to nod their assent.

Turning my face and my heart to the sky, I begin.

A dance of four steps, with prelude.
Step zero: the point, dimensionless virtue.
Step one: the point draws out to a line.
Step two: the line broadens into a plane.
Step three: the plane rises into the solid.
And then, the release of step four...

I look around at the sea of grasses.
I look up to the empty sky.
Somewhere up there, a Leviathan swims
Bellyful of stars, my papa in tow.

Papa, I am leaving now.

Step four... and I am gone.

  The Hard Edge of Things   by Mark Smith
=========================================
...................................................................
  Going home or leaving home -- sometimes there's no difference.
...................................................................


  I thought how strange it was to find myself after all these 
  years back in downtown Temple, Texas, with no money on a 
  Saturday afternoon, facing the hard edge of things and no choice 
  about it. I'd hit the limit of what a body could do without a 
  car. The public library closed half an hour ago, and they didn't 
  allow sleeping anyway. I'd been to the park and watched 
  clean-cut guys in shorts pushing their kids in the swings. I 
  walked up one street and down another looking at the empty 
  stores, whitewashed, boarded up. I remembered them when people 
  still shopped there and air-conditioning was new and smelled 
  funny and my mama would buy me a Coke at Mackey's Drug Store. I 
  cupped my hand against the sun and looked through the plate 
  glass where there used to be a department store. A single 
  high-heeled shoe lay sideways on the carpet. I never felt so 
  low.

  I made up my mind that minute to walk out to the highway and get 
  out of town, no matter how long it took or how hot it was. But I 
  got stopped after a block by a big freight train passing 
  through, slow as a dream. It had about a hundred cars, so I sat 
  on the high curb to watch it go by. A guy on the other side of 
  the street had the same idea, except he had a flask of peach 
  brandy. He belched and I could smell it and hear it even over 
  the rumble of the train. I read the contents on the sides of the 
  cars: methanol, corn syrup, liquid petroleum gas, gravel. I 
  looked away, up to the big grain silos, and thought how much it 
  looked like Kansas or North Dakota. A black woman came up on the 
  other side of the train, waiting to cross to my side. She wore 
  shorts and a halter top and she had a baby in a stroller. Seeing 
  her flash between the cars as they passed gave an effect like a 
  series of still photos. She looked as hot as me standing there 
  in the sun.

  I thought about turning around and heading out South First 
  Street to see the spot where my grandmother's house used to be, 
  that big old house with stained-glass windows and a wide front 
  porch. But just then the last car went by, and I decided I'd 
  head out to the highway like I first planned. There wasn't any 
  point in going to South First anyway, since they'd torn the 
  house down to put in a Diamond Shamrock station and I knew that 
  would only make me feel worse.

  So I walked on, down the dusty streets, wondering when they 
  stopped having cabooses on the ends of trains.

  Danielle   by Edward Ashton
=============================
...................................................................
  The dividing line between love and obsession can be as thin as a 
  pane of glass.
...................................................................


  She works in my building. I see her sometimes in the stairwell 
  and sometimes in the halls. She's taller than I am, over six 
  feet, with long black hair and pale blue eyes and a neck that 
  curves up from her collar like a swan's. Her name is Danielle, 
  and if I'm feeling brave I might say "Hello, Danielle," or "Good 
  morning, Danielle," or even something about her jacket or dress, 
  how she wears it very well. She often says thank you if I say 
  something nice, but she never says anything unless I speak 
  first. In fact, I don't believe she knows my name, though we've 
  been working in the same building for almost two years.

  My wife's name is Laura. When I get home from work she says, 
  "How were things at work today? How's Danielle?" She knows about 
  Danielle because I talk in my sleep. I tell her things are the 
  same as always, that she doesn't know I'm alive. She says I 
  should let her know if things change, because she has a bag 
  packed and ready. I've looked for this bag and have never 
  actually found it, but because we have no children I consider it 
  a credible threat.

  Danielle lives alone in a one-story cottage on Herkimer Street. 
  I know this because a year ago I found her address in the 
  telephone book, and since then I've occasionally driven past her 
  house on my way to somewhere else. The neighborhood is quiet and 
  clean. In the daytime children play kickball in the street, and 
  at night I've seen couples and old people walking up and down 
  the block. I have never seen Danielle out walking, either alone 
  or with others. Once, in a moment of weakness, I parked across 
  the street from her house and sat watching her through an open 
  window as she ate her dinner and worked a crossword puzzle in an 
  easy chair. She was wearing glasses, which she never does at 
  work, and she was dressed in an old rumpled sweatshirt and torn 
  denim jeans. You'd think this might tarnish my image of her, but 
  in fact I found her more attractive then than I had before. When 
  she set aside her puzzle, stood, stretched, and went off to bed, 
  I had a terrible urge to slink around to the back of her house, 
  to try to find her bedroom window, to watch her as she slept. 
  But I haven't sunk to quite that level yet.

  Laura was waiting when I got home that night, demanding to know 
  where I'd been. I told her I'd been drinking at a bar, but there 
  was no alcohol on my breath, so she knew that was a lie. She 
  said that if I'd smelled of perfume she would have left me on 
  the spot, but since I didn't I'd probably only been hanging 
  around outside her window masturbating, which she supposed was 
  all right if that was as far as it went. I wanted to explain to 
  her that in fact there was nothing sexual in the incident at 
  all, but I could see that this wasn't something she could 
  discuss rationally. In the end I just nodded and left it at 
  that.

  I have a friend at work named Brian. He has an office across the 
  hall from mine. He's just turned forty and has been married and 
  divorced three times in the past ten years. He advises me to 
  leave Laura -- or, more likely, to coerce her into leaving me -- 
  and then to pursue and win over Danielle. I haven't done this 
  for two reasons: I don't believe that Danielle would have me, 
  and I truly would miss my wife, who is an excellent cook and a 
  good conversationalist. Brian has said more than once that if he 
  ever caught himself thinking of his wife in those terms he'd 
  either divorce her immediately or throw himself off the roof. I 
  think this attitude goes a long way toward explaining his utter 
  failure as a husband. Physical attraction is transitory. The 
  pleasures of the intellect are the only ones that last.

  I have a recurring dream in which I'm hiding in the bushes 
  behind Danielle's cottage, peering in her window as she 
  undresses for bed. She peels off layer after layer, but no 
  matter how much clothing she removes, she still has more on 
  underneath, until finally I begin to beat my head against the 
  glass in frustration. She comes to the window then and opens it, 
  but just as she's about to speak I always wake. I've tried many 
  times to fall back asleep and into the dream, but somehow it 
  always comes out twisted -- I end up staring in the window at my 
  wife getting undressed. Or, worse yet, it's me in the bedroom 
  and Laura on the outside looking in.

  Over lunch I tell Brian about the dream. He laughs and says that 
  if I want to get over my frustration I should come to his 
  apartment that evening, and that I should bring along a 
  twelve-pack of beer. When I get there we sit at his kitchen 
  table for a while, drinking and talking about work and women and 
  whether the Pirates still have a chance at the pennant. I don't 
  drink very often, and by the time we've gone through four or 
  five beers each I'm feeling light-headed and giddy. Brian asks 
  if I want to see something and I say yes, mostly because I feel 
  a need to get up and move around, so we go into his front room 
  and he puts in a black-and-white videotape of himself having sex 
  with a woman who looks like Danielle. She's on top of him, 
  straddling his hips, rocking forward and backward and grunting 
  each time. Brian on the tape turns and winks at the camera. 
  Brian sitting beside me bursts out laughing. I lean forward, put 
  my head between my knees, and squeeze my eyes shut. The room is 
  spinning and my pulse is racing and I'm afraid I'm having some 
  sort of attack. Brian tells me to sit up, that I'm missing the 
  best part. My stomach is heaving and Danielle is crying out to 
  God and Jesus and Brian is laughing and fluid is pouring out of 
  my mouth and splashing onto the carpet. I press my hands to my 
  ears and wait for the screaming to stop.

  I see Danielle in the stairwell at work the next day, coming up 
  to the fourth floor as I'm going down. I don't say hello. She 
  looks up with a half-smile when she sees me, but as we come 
  closer she glances away, and she turns to avoid brushing against 
  me as we pass.



  A month or so after that, Laura shakes me out of a sound sleep 
  at five in the morning and asks me if something is wrong.

  "Is there trouble in paradise?" she says. "You haven't mentioned 
  your girlfriend in weeks."

  I close my eyes and say I don't have a girlfriend. I only have a 
  wife. I feel Laura lean closer then, feel her breath warm in my 
  ear.

  "That's right," she whispers. "You do have a wife." She kisses 
  my ear, kisses my cheek, kisses my mouth. She pulls her 
  nightgown off over her head and climbs on top of me, and we make 
  love for the first time in the better part of a year. And it's 
  fine, it's good, until Laura began to shake and cry out and I 
  think of Danielle and the video and I just can't do it. I can't 
  quite get there. I pretend, but I think Laura knows, because she 
  doesn't say anything to me when we're finished. She just pulls 
  on her nightgown and goes into the bathroom, and I fall asleep 
  listening to the water running and dream that I'm in Danielle's 
  bed and it's her in the shower and not my wife. When I wake the 
  next morning, there's a note taped to the headboard. "I'll be at 
  my sister's," it says. "Get this out of your system. Then give 
  me a call."

  Two days later I'm drinking at the bar in a Mexican restaurant 
  after work when Danielle walks in. She looks once around the 
  place, and I half-expect her to leave when she sees me. But she 
  has no idea that there's anything between us, of course, and in 
  fact she comes over to the bar and sits down two stools away 
  from me. She orders a strawberry Margarita. I'm hardly aware 
  that I'm staring at her until she turns and sees me.

  "Oh, hello," she says. "Don't I know you from work?"

  "Not really," I say. "I have an office on the fourth floor."

  "Right, but -- " She hesitates, looks confused for a moment. 
  "You used to say hello to me almost every day, didn't you? But 
  you don't anymore. Did I do something rotten to you?"

  "Well," I say, "my wife just left me because of you. But I don't 
  suppose that's entirely your fault."

  "Oh." She's confused again, not sure if I'm trying to be funny. 
  I smile and shake my head, and she takes that as her cue to 
  laugh. The bartender brings her drink. She pays him, leaves a 
  quarter on the bar as a tip.

  "So really," she says. "Did I take your parking space or 
  something? If I did, I'm sorry, because you really used to 
  brighten up my day."

  "No," I say. "You didn't do anything. I've just had a lot of 
  things on my mind lately. I'm sure I'll be back to my old self 
  soon."

  "That's good," she says. The hostess calls my name. Danielle 
  nods and smiles. I wish her good night.

  I drive up and down Herkimer street six times that night before 
  I work up the courage to park. I leave my car two blocks away 
  from Danielle's, for fear that she might look out the window and 
  recognize it. When I get to her cottage the street is deserted. 
  Danielle is in the front room, half asleep in front of the 
  television. I walk up the driveway and around the side of the 
  house, trying not to look like a burglar until I'm out of view 
  of the street. The first window around back is her bedroom. 
  Light from the hallway falls across her pillows and onto the 
  floor. She has a dozen stuffed animals at the foot of her bed. I 
  wait for five minutes, then ten. At least her neighbors haven't 
  called the police. I lean my forehead against the glass and 
  close my eyes. It's a warm, clear night, with just a hint of a 
  breeze, and crickets are singing in the backyard...

  And then there is light. My eyes snap open and she's standing 
  there, her hand still on the light switch, only ten feet and a 
  pane of glass between us. A bathrobe hangs around her shoulders, 
  but it's open in the front and she's wearing nothing underneath. 
  Her breasts are sagging heavily and she needs to shave her legs. 
  She's looking straight into my eyes.

  I jerk back from the window, turn and bolt around the side of 
  the house and across the front lawn. No casual pretenses now, 
  I'm running flat-out down the middle of the street, expecting 
  every moment to hear her screaming behind me. But I never do, 
  and when I get home there are no policemen waiting at my door, 
  and the next morning when I pass Danielle in the stairwell at 
  work she smiles and nods.



  That night I have a new dream. I'm standing outside Danielle's 
  window again, but when the light comes on it's not her bedroom 
  I'm looking into, but my own. Laura slides the window up for me. 
  She offers me her hand.

  The old guy on the table didn't look capable of hurting anyone, 
  much less killing them. That was good. My rep depended on it.

  The wires retracted into their housing in the wall, which melted 
  back into its Dali camo. Disintegration of the Persistence of 
  Vision, this time. Last time it'd been the Last Supper, making 
  the lapsed Catholic in me feel kind of creepy. Jesus' eyes in my 
  back, staring me down as I checked the hotline to find her voice 
  there. "Help me." It always started like that. I decided I 
  should probably edit the Last Supper out of the playback loop 
  when I got the chance.

  I glanced at the guy's brain and the worms were busy doing their 
  thing, crawling on the contacts, converting the metal to gray 
  tissue. In about ten minutes there would be nothing on a medical 
  scan of this guy's head to show that he'd been plugged into a 
  dumper, nothing abnormal in his head at all -- just a few 
  patches of dead tissue. Normal for a senior citizen.

  I zipped him up, glued the rug down -- standard 
  old-man-white-with-a-touch-of-yellow hair -- and wheeled him 
  into the wake-up room, full of doctor-esque toys. I even had a 
  salt shaker dressed up to look like a medical instrument. 
  Sarcasm is my middle name. John Sarcasm Smith, you'll understand 
  if I don't shake hands, but I've gotta wash the blood off first. 
  Which I did, at a stainless-steel basin.

  He woke up in about an hour and I told him not to drive for at 
  least four days -- you just can't force-learn everything when 
  you get a brand new body. I told him to walk six blocks west and 
  catch a cab.

  Four hours ago he'd been a devastatingly gorgeous redhead with 
  three corpses on her conscience and the bad fortune to have left 
  blood on the last victim, enough for a tight-scope genotype. 
  Watching him walk away, I wondered if he'd notice the absence of 
  breasts and how it made his back hurt less. At least he didn't 
  have the swaying hips of the last female-to-male I'd done.

  I watched my work walk away, then I went into the house and 
  called Cardinal Points, telling them to send a cab to the 
  twelve-hundred block of Parkwest.



  I used to work for lockheed, and if that means nothing to you, 
  then you haven't been keeping up with USASF declassification.

  I was on the team working on the interhook, the biomechanical 
  interface between pilot and craft. I was one of the middle-level 
  techs on the bio side of things, with a high enough security 
  clearance to have more than a faint idea what I might be doing. 
  My specialty was biological memory storage. The sky over White 
  Sands was full of warbirds, mainly old-stock F/A-23 Bloodhawks 
  and EA-91 Eagle Eyes. The planes weren't the experimental part 
  of the project; the pilots were.

  Yeah, you say, I read about it in Popular Whatever, so what? But 
  this was sixteen years ago, long before anyone outside of a 
  tight circle of Aerospace Force brass knew what was going on. I 
  didn't really know; I guessed at some of it but I told no one. 
  The death penalty was in effect; it was wartime, remember?

  What war? The Big Fizzle. The one where we were gonna kick some 
  serious Second Soviet ass, except they crumbled. Hard to believe 
  we took 'em seriously again, ain't it? But there you go again, 
  forgetting historical context.

  Anyway, the pilots were the experiment.



  My phone rang.

  My phone _never_ rings. No one has the number. I've got a device 
  over the output on it that prevents my name and number from ever 
  leaving my house.

  So my phone rang and I thought, _Shit_.

  I answered it, though. What else am I gonna do? If it's cops 
  they've got a lot of nerve, warning me, and if it's anyone else 
  I wanna know where they got the number.

  "Hello?"

  "Hi, Philip."

  "Sorry, I don't know any -- "

  "Cut it," he said. "Don't bother ducking. It's Genera."

  Genera? Vaguely familiar -- "Hi." Nobody's called me Philip 
  since I quit answering to it. Fourteen years ago.

  "I understand that you've got a business going. Profitable."

  "From who?"

  "Never mind that. I need your services."

  "Go through the usual channels."

  "Wait on a -- "

  I unplugged the phone. Ten minutes later I plugged it back in 
  and it was, of course, ringing.

  "_What_, goddamn it?"

  "Philip, that was rude. I've never had to use the redial on this 
  phone, you know that?"

  "I care."

  "It works. Regardless, I need your services. A friend of mine 
  requires a body."

  "This better be secure. The phone."

  "Of course it is." Genera -- now I remembered. Cop, ex-cop. 
  Couldn't remember his real name, not right now. I'd done 
  bodywork for him once. But how'd he get my number? It didn't 
  matter. Not right now, anyway.

  "All right," I said, "I'll bite."

  "New body."

  "Well, duh. Male, female? I need an age, height -- "

  "I've got a blueprint for you. How much?"

  "Remember last time?"

  "Yeah."

  "Add four hundred percent."

  "All right." My price had actually only gone up three hundred, 
  but I figured he owed me for the phone call. The personal touch, 
  you know?



  The sky was gray and i should have known something was going on 
  just from that. I'm omen-driven; things that look wrong 
  sometimes have special significance for me. Red sky at night, 
  sparrows take flight. I'm still kicking myself.

  But I don't wanna give too much away.

  I met Genera -- turns out William Carlyle is his real name -- in 
  a small restaurant that served Szechuan food. I had something 
  green with too much curry. Soy sauce on it didn't help.

  "So where'd you get my phone number? And where'd you get my 
  name?" Genera looked pretty much like I remembered him. The hair 
  had gone gray, the stomach had expanded, but hey, same deal with 
  me. I allow myself to look middle-aged. It helps me blend into 
  my 'hood.

  "Your name was easy. They've got a file at the PD."

  "You're cop again? I have a gun, you know."

  "Yeah, but you didn't bring it."

  Damn, he was slick. I hadn't even seen him scan me. Unless he 
  had a cohort, which was unlikely.

  "And no, I'm not cop. They just have, um, unimaginative 
  passcodes."

  "Oh." I shoveled green-black rice into my mouth; tried to, but 
  I'm bad with chopsticks. "The blueprint."

  "Yeah. Actually, you should already have it."

  "Huh?"

  "In your computer."

  "Fuck that. You couldn't have hacked it, it's not connected." 
  Quite deliberately, I might add.

  "No, but it _is_ powered on."

  "Uh-huh," trying to see his point.

  "That's all my hackboy needs."

  "Bullshit."

  "Check it and see."

  At least he paid for lunch.



  It was raining when I pulled in back at my house, and that was 
  just another omen. The weatherman, lying bastard, had called for 
  clear and sunny the rest of the week. There was a niggling 
  feeling in my hindbrain that told me that something was off 
  here, but I sat down at my computer anyway. The words floated in 
  front of my eyes:



> Warning  --  New File in Tree:
> "genera/gotcha ashole." Disposition?

  "Get a hackboy who can spell," I said out loud.

  _Disposition?_ it repeated. I wished I'd bought voice chips that 
  didn't sound like Majel Barrett.

  "Clear it and then run it," I said.

  A pause. _File is clean._ Not viral, at least not in any way 
  that Majel could find. _Running. File is a standard image file 
  with text attachment._

  Deep breath. "Go," I said.



  The image was a 3V of a male, 172cm tall, age about thirty-nine. 
  Everything was pretty average in size and shape; the text said 
  that he was to have green eyes and thinning brown hair. You'd 
  pass him on the street and never know he'd been someone else 
  days ago.

  The body was easy enough. I went into the back, through the 
  hidden door, and grabbed a beer and a blue-labeled test tube. 
  Then I went and sat on my veranda, the rain drumming on the 
  green corrugated plastic above me, and watched the slanting gray 
  as it obliterated any visibility out there, musing over the last 
  time I'd been given a really _hard_ one.

  Green eyes, brown hair, that was easy. Thinning brown hair, I'd 
  have to work in a gene for male pattern baldness. Fine, easy. 
  The challenge was gone. But it was still big goddamn money, you 
  betcha. That was why I was still doing it, I think.

  I decided I'd give him a mole, too. On the left foot, just above 
  the heel. Gotta sign it somehow.

  The sky was clearing later on when I came back up out of my 
  fugue. I do that sometimes, get lost inside my head, thinking 
  about the engineering. My beer was warm and flat and still half 
  there, and the sun was setting. I finished the beer and went 
  down to the lab.



  In four days he was born, a tabula rasa for me to imprint 
  Genera's friend into. The new genotype is precisely that, a 
  _brand new_ genotype, not in the police records or anyone 
  else's, for that matter. They're all grown from clones, but I 
  tinker with them enough to make them all unique.

  And the cloning is only the least illegal part of the whole 
  deal.



  I dialed my hotline and listened to Genera saying he was ready 
  when I was. At least he hadn't called me again.

  We met at a Greek place up the street and around the corner from 
  the curry-intensive Szechuan place. I ate something I could 
  pronounce and Genera ate something I couldn't.

  Halfway through I told him I was ready. He said his hackboy was 
  fourteen and so it was no wonder he couldn't spell. I told him 
  that was pathetic and he handed me the rest of my money, cash, 
  in the time-honored black briefcase. I named a place for the 
  pickup and told him I didn't want to see his ugly face again. He 
  grinned and told me that wasn't what his women said. I left.

  I should have killed him, but there was no quiet way to do it. 
  Plus all I had was my taser.

  Besides, I didn't _know_.



  The body was lying on the table. The guy I was transferring told 
  me he'd never heard of this shit before, if it wasn't for Genera 
  it'd just be a matter of time before the rape-murder cops got 
  him on the genotyping. I hate hearing shit like that. I'd as 
  soon not know about what a client did. Guaranteed it's gonna be 
  bad.

  So I told him to lie down and attached the electrodes to his 
  forehead, the sleep inducers.

  When he was asleep I wheeled him to the real lab, opened up his 
  skull, shoved the metal transfer contacts in, and told the Dali 
  to dissolve and gimme the wires.

  The actual transfer is computer-controlled; once I connect the 
  wires, I might as well have a beer. I never do. I feel like I 
  should at least supervise, even though if anything goes wrong I 
  still have to depend on the computer. My reflexes are nowhere 
  near fast enough, and neither is my mind.

  So I hit the switch and watched the green lights flicker. 
  Nothing went red, or even yellow. That only happened once, a 
  red, and the computer caught it in time. No troubles.



  I built this stuff after the interhook project, ten years ago. 
  I've used it nineteen times since then. I know it intimately.

  The electronics are cobbled together from the flight system 
  interface, the place where the plane dumps itself into the 
  pilot. In the interhook, the pilot's senses are replaced. Taste, 
  for instance, becomes fuel mix; a sweet taste is ideal, bitter 
  is too lean, salty is too rich. Sight is suddenly the 
  cartographic outlay of the terrain, the targeting system. The 
  plane's skin becomes the pilot's flesh. Pain, depending on the 
  type and location and intensity, can indicate a hull breach or a 
  failing engine or a low fuel tank.

  My use of this technology, as far as I'm concerned, is simply 
  the next logical step. Dumping the personality of one body into 
  another is actually a two-step process: first the original's 
  mind is transferred to a buffer, a truly vast buffer, made up of 
  a generally-inert cloned brain, and then the buffer is dumped to 
  the new body. Two dumps for the price of one.

  This is the most illegal part of my work; most of the technology 
  I deal with is still technically classified. Don't ask me to 
  tell you how I got it. I have no intention of giving a friend 
  the death penalty.



  When his green eyes twitched open he said, "Philip Cabrierre, 
  you are under arrest. You have the right -- "

  "Genera, you shit," I said.

  " -- to remain silent, anything you say -- "

  "Dollhouse," I said.

  " -- can and will be used against you in a court -- "

  "Mambo," I said.

  " -- of law, you have the right to an -- "

  "Shitheel," I said.

  " -- attorney or an attorney program, if you cannot afford 
  one -- "

  "F-stop," I said.

  " -- one will be..." He sort of trailed off there. First time 
  I'd ever had to use the shutdown phrase.

  In the interhook there is provision for a hypnotic trigger 
  sequence. In the military it's generally used to induce a pilot 
  to carry out his mission. You don't want a bomber pilot, say, to 
  freeze up just because he's going to drop an H or three on a 
  city full of innocents. So you say some words to him and he's 
  yours, wide open, do anything you say. Drop them bombs, soldier. 
  Then repeat the phrase to close him up again.

  "Whose fucking idea was this?" I said, evenly.

  "Captain Carlyle," he said.

  Captain, huh? Genera, you shit.



  They'd been after me for seven years, he said. Genera -- Carlyle 
  -- had been a cop all along. They'd bought a bunch of people, 
  not the least of which was that damned redhead I told you about 
  earlier. They had me. This guy's voice wasn't smug, just 
  matter-of-fact. I told him to quit breathing. When he turned 
  that blue color I told him to start again.

  Then I sat down and looked into his blank eyes. "You are now 
  under my power," I said. "Your mission" -- should you choose to 
  accept it, as if he had a choice, wide open like that -- "is to 
  find and kill Genera. William Carlyle. You will go to your 
  station house or wherever it is that you came from. You will act 
  normally until you have the opportunity to kill Captain William 
  Carlyle. You will take the first opportunity you see. Do you 
  understand that?"

  "Yes." His voice was flat and dull.

  "State your name, rank, serial number, and mission for me."

  "Sigvaldursson, Davis Anthony. Corporal. Zero one four three 
  three one two eight dash seven B. I am to take the first 
  opportunity I see to kill Captain William Carlyle."

  "Good. Now give me a hand here, will you?"



  I watched the wires retract and Cygnes reflechis en elephants 
  come up. It was weird, lying there on the table while he did all 
  the work.

  "Okay," I instructed him, "now seal the scalp and kill the 
  cutout switch." I heard the seal -- it never sounded quite so 
  wet before -- as my forehead closed back up. Then all sensation 
  was back and I had one hell of a headache.

  I stood up anyway. "The blonde wig." I looked down at my new 
  bustline and was impressed. He'd done a good job. Too bad I 
  couldn't hire him on as permanent help. But he had other uses. 
  "Yeah, that one." I'd have to get a hair graft later. The wig 
  would do for now.



  "Dollhouse," I murmured to him, "mambo, shitheel, f-stop," and 
  then I walked away. I glanced back over my shoulder at him and 
  he was rubbing his eyes, then eyeing my butt in the snug shorts 
  I'd picked. Yeah, look real hard, boy. Just another 
  drop-dead-gorgeous girl you'll never get to know.

  That was two weeks ago. I've been watching the news, but I still 
  haven't seen anything about Genera. Maybe the hypnotic 
  suggestion doesn't work after the second code phrase.

  Maybe I'll have to do it myself. I'll give Sigvaldursson another 
  week, and then I think I'll buy a gun. Genera won't even see it 
  coming.

  I'm almost looking forward to it.

  Business   by Sung J. Woo
===========================
...................................................................
  Whoever said there's no honor among thieves was right. Trust, 
  friendship, and loyalty, sure -- but mostly there's just 
  _policy._
...................................................................


  There were five of us in the bathroom -- not including Chuckie 
  -- Eduardo, Two-Tone, Grease, Tony, and of course, me. I tiptoed 
  and stretched, but I still couldn't see over Two-Tone's huge 
  head. Two-Tone smelled of something awful, a cross between 
  garlic, rotten cheese, and the locker room at the Y.

  "Why the fuck do all you guys have to be here?" Chuckie said, 
  his pants down, his face red, sitting on the toilet.

  "Because we don't trust you, that's why, Chuckie," Eduardo said. 
  "Who knows, maybe you'll swallow it, you know?"

  "Give me a fucking break," Chuckie said. "Is it my fault I got 
  constipated? It's all that garlic shit pizza we ate."

  "Hey, I liked that stuff," Two-Tone said. "My mother used to 
  make it all the time."

  "Shut up," Eduardo said, "you guys are giving me a headache." He 
  sat down on the edge of the bathtub.

  "Oh shit," Chuckie said, "it's ripping. I can't do this, 
  Eduardo." I crouched down and looked at his bright red face 
  between Two-Tone's legs.

  "You get your asshole ripped," Eduardo said, "we can sew it up. 
  Grease's real good at that, right?"

  "I ain't touching nowhere nohow," Grease said. "I ain't going 
  near his hole."

  And everyone laughed, even Eduardo, even Chuckie.

  "Oh shit!" Chuckie screamed. "Oh shit oh shit oh shit it's 
  coming out, oh shit!" His face turned purple and he was shaking 
  all over.

  "Holy shit," Grease said, running out of the bathroom. Then 
  Two-Tone, Tony, and finally me. I slammed the door behind me.

  "What the fuck was that he ate that stinks so bad?" Two-Tone 
  asked us, laughing.

  "And Eduardo's still with him," Tony said. "I guess he really 
  doesn't trust him."

  Me and Grease and Two-Tone exchanged looks. Eduardo trusted 
  Chuckie; Eduardo trusted all of us. Tony had been with us for 
  the last couple of months and he still didn't understand. He was 
  a bit slow but pretty good at busting into safes.

  "It's okay, Chuckie," Eduardo was saying in the bathroom. We all 
  leaned closer to the door to listen. "You're doing fine."

  Then silence -- then a whole bunch of grunts -- then a final, 
  whopping yell of pain and relief. After a couple minutes of 
  waiting, Eduardo came out.

  "Pee-yoo, man," Grease said, clamping his nose shut with his 
  fingers. "Now you smell like shit."

  "Shit or not, he's done, and it's out," Eduardo said. Chuckie 
  followed him out, still adjusting his belt and tucking in his 
  black Ozzy Osbourne t-shirt, which had big dark spots under his 
  armpits.

  The bathroom still stunk, but we all had to look. After all, it 
  was ours.

  The log was green and brown and really thick, almost the girth 
  of a Coke can. And it looked really hard, not the usual 
  smoothness of regular shit. It had cracks and dimples and had a 
  shiny surface, like it was glazed. A few droplets of blood were 
  dissolving into the water, wavering like cigarette smoke in 
  still air.

  "Where the fuck is it?" Grease asked.

  A bamboo chopstick in hand, Eduardo slowly spun the log around. 
  And when we saw the other side, it was there, a bright red ruby 
  ring stuck smack in the middle.

  We all left the bathroom and went into the kitchen. I was 
  starving for some strange reason, and we still had some roast 
  chicken left over from the night before.

  "So who's gonna take it out?" I said, picking at the chicken.

  "Ain't me," Grease said. "I say whoever shat the fucking thing 
  go get it."

  Chuckie waved him off. "You want it, you get it yourself. I've 
  done my tour of duty today." Feeling his butt, he added, "Maybe 
  forever."

  So we were arguing, horsing around, having some fun now because 
  the worst was over. We got away from customs and we made it back 
  here and Chuckie had shat and we didn't even see Tony leaving 
  the kitchen and going into the bathroom, no, none of us saw it.

  "You hear that?" Eduardo said.

  "No," I said, unable to break free from his surprised gray eyes. 
  It was the sound of someone taking a leak.

  "Oh my fucking God," Grease and Two-Tone said at the same time, 
  and we all ran to the bathroom.

  Tony was there flicking his dick and pulling down the flush at 
  the same time. There was only one chance, and Eduardo dropped to 
  the floor and shoved his hand into the toilet as the water 
  swirled and swirled into the tunnel.

  We all held our breath. Tony held onto his penis, wondering what 
  all the problem was. Then he realized suddenly and left his dick 
  hanging out of his fly. "Oh shit, oh shit," he said jumping up 
  and down, looking like some kid needing to go to the bathroom. 
  "I'm so fucking stupid," he said.

  All eyes were on Eduardo and his right hand shoved deep into the 
  toilet. "Got something," he said, and pulled his hand out of the 
  water. His hand had a part of the log, only about half of it.

  It was breathless. Nobody said anything, we just opened our eyes 
  and hoped. Eduardo slowly opened his hand -- he had crushed some 
  of the shit, but it was still together.

  But nothing. He was holding the end without the ruby.

  I laughed. What else could I do? I laughed and laughed until 
  somebody shoved a hand full of shit into my face. Then everybody 
  else started laughing, so I laughed again, knowing little else 
  to do. What can you do but laugh at something like that?



  It's that feeling at the pit of your stomach, that empty and 
  hollow churning -- butterflies, some people call it. You've done 
  something wrong, and this man -- this _police man_ with his red 
  and white lights and his flashlight -- is going to get you.

  I'm talking about a speeding ticket here. Since almost everyone 
  has been stopped by a cop once or another, that's a good place 
  to start.

  They make you feel like a kid, even if you're past retirement 
  and the cop is just out of high school. I've seen the breakdown, 
  the sweat forming on the brows while the cop adjusts his cap a 
  little bit, like he's annoyed at everything that you do.

  So it's that feeling, but multiplied one thousand, ten thousand, 
  a million times. You don't understand the rush, the high. You 
  can only get it when you have a pound of hash stuffed under your 
  seat and the cop is checking out your license, staring at your 
  ugly mug. You can barely keep from laughing because you're free. 
  Until you break yourself away from the law and government and 
  all that stuff, you'll be trapped forever in a mindless maze. 
  Whenever we go on road trips, we stop at a 7-11 and hold one up. 
  Just one, because once you hold up two, you're giving them a 
  line. And lines have a way of pointing.

  These guys say they don't have the combination to the safe, who 
  cares? That's what Tony's there for. We just make sure they 
  don't press any buttons or anything like that. We tape them up 
  good with duct tape, which every 7-11 has, and I stick one of 
  the workers in the toilet feet first, threatening to zap him 
  while Grease fucks around with his 12-gauge.

  And the whole time we're doing this, I'm thinking _I'm free_. 
  I'm free to do whatever I want, whenever I want, whoever I want.

  Just last week I had the stash under my car when the cop pulled 
  me over and the whole time I'm trying really hard not to laugh. 
  Because if I laugh (I have a crazy sounding laugh, "like someone 
  rubbing two balloons together and playing the harmonica at the 
  same time," Grease once told me), it's all over.

  So that's what I'm thinking when the cop is looking over my 
  license, that if I slip, I'm finished. It's like thinking about 
  my stinky grandmother when I'm having sex, only a little 
  different. In both cases, it keeps me from laughing, which is 
  the important thing.



  I think all five of us have done time at one point or another. 
  It happens -- it only takes one fuckup to get caught. Then 
  you're in prison and there isn't a whole lot you can do about 
  it. You just start counting the days.

  I was in for armed robbery and kidnapping, for holding up one of 
  those fancy clothing stores downtown. They were having their 
  annual One Day Sale and a friend had told me they cleared more 
  than a hundred grand on that day. Of course, security would have 
  been beefed up -- so going up to the counter and yelling for 
  money would have been suicide. So I came up with a very smart 
  plan (I thought it was smart, anyway).

  I went into the store dressed in my best cloths and took a pair 
  of pants into the dressing room. Inside one of the cubicles, I 
  took out both my guns, sat down on the bench, and waited. 
  Eventually they would come, because they always did. And sure 
  enough, after a half-hour wait, they arrived.

  "After Daddy tries this on, you tell me what you think, okay?" a 
  voice said from the cubicle next to me, a pleasant news 
  anchorman's voice.

  "Yes, Daddy," a little girl said from outside the cubicle.

  "Just wait out there, Maggie, I'll be right out," he said, 
  unzipping his pants. It was time to make my move. I walked out. 
  The girl had beautiful red curls, the dripping kind, like 
  Slinkys. She looked at me and smiled but didn't say anything. 
  Little kids and I usually get along, I think mostly because I'm 
  not much taller than they are.

  I walked behind her and put my hand over her mouth, her head 
  shoved tight against my chest. Her eyes were about to pop out of 
  their sockets when I showed her my gun. I thought she would bite 
  my hand, but instead she became completely calm, as if she were 
  glad to see the gun. It's amazing what television has done to 
  these kids.

  I dragged the kid back into my dressing cubicle and closed the 
  door, at which point my neighbor finished putting his new pair 
  of pants on.

  "Maggie?" he said uncertainly.

  "Over here," I said. And I heard the tightening up of every 
  muscle in his body. "Don't even think about it," I said. "Unless 
  you want your little darling to look like Swiss cheese." I love 
  saying that kind of stuff.

  "Oh Lord," he said.

  I opened the door and let him in. It was a big dressing area, 
  enough to fit two adults and a kid comfortably. I had my gun on 
  Maggie's head, who didn't seem a bit nervous.

  "I'm not going to kill your kid," I said.

  "Thank God," he said.

  "If you do what I want you to do."

  "Oh Lord," he said. He was fat and bald and looked early 
  thirty-ish.

  "You're a deeply religious man, aren't you?"

  "No," he said. "No. Only in emergencies."

  I tried hard not to laugh. "Here's what I want you to do," I 
  said, handing him my second pistol. You can always tell when 
  someone is holding a gun for the very first time. They have an 
  awed look about them, as if they were holding something sacred. 
  "I want you to go outside, go up to the counter, and have all 
  the cash taken out of all the drawers and anything else valuable 
  they have stashed in there." I paused. "Announce yourself as 
  'Squeaky Norman' from the 'Zippadee-Dooda Money Laundry 
  Service.'" At this point I took the gun off of Maggie.

  "Zippadee-Dooda, I got it," he said, and pointed his gun at me, 
  quick as a tiger. "Let go of my daughter."

  I put my gun back into my belt. "It's not loaded, Norman," I 
  said. Eyes closed, he pulled the trigger -- without hesitation 
  -- and it went _click._ "Great," I said. "Now I know for sure 
  you can do the job. If you can kill someone as sweet as me, you 
  can certainly rob a store, can't you?" I told him to meet me at 
  the corner of 6th and Brown, in front of the deli, when he was 
  through with his job.

  I pushed him out the cubicle and waited with Maggie, who wasn't 
  saying a word. So I listened to the goings on outside. "I'm 
  Squeaky Norma, from the Zippadee-Dooda Money Cleaning Service," 
  he was yelling. Close enough, so he got a couple of words wrong. 
  After all, he was under a lot of pressure. I giggled.

  "Hey mister," Maggie said, pointing a gun at my butt. I went for 
  my own, but it was gone. She had somehow taken it out -- but 
  how? To this day, I still don't know what happened.

  I was going to say something like "You don't know what you're 
  doing," but she didn't even wait for that. She held the gun with 
  both hands, shot it, shot off my left buttcheek, and the gun 
  went flying from the recoil.

  I fell down and she ran right past me, not even giving me a 
  passing glance, and while I was wondering whether there was too 
  much violence on TV, the ambulance people and the police 
  officers landed next to me one by one like vultures. They played 
  musical chairs on the bench until a pair of men in white suits 
  carted me away.



  So I was serving my five year sentence in Greenwood and that's 
  where I got to know Eduardo. Although we had both arrived around 
  the same time and were serving out similar sentences (his was 
  also for armed robbery, but with first degree manslaughter 
  instead of kidnap), we didn't actually get to know each other 
  until the last year of our stay. Greenwood was a big place, 
  holding as many as four thousand people. It was divided into two 
  sections, North and West, and each of those sections were 
  subdivided into four more sections, A, B, C, and D. I lived in 
  North C, and Eduardo lived in West D, so that's why we never saw 
  each other.

  But because of some mix-up, both Eduardo and I ended up in the 
  same softball team that last year, me at second and Eduardo at 
  short. We got to know each other pretty well on and off the 
  field. He seemed like a straight arrow to me, someone who you'd 
  never expect to be involved with my kind of business. But once 
  you got to know him, you knew that there was no other kind of 
  life for Eduardo. Like me, he had to be free. Law and order were 
  things to be ignored, not followed.



  Although everyone talked about their future plans, it was a 
  serious subject between someone like me and Eduardo since our 
  time was up in a couple of months. Believe it or not, you get 
  used to prison life. After a couple of months, you get into a 
  groove. People can get used to just about anything.

  "I'm going straight," Eduardo said when I asked him what he was 
  going to do. "My brother works in construction, and he can 
  probably get me a job."

  "Oh," I said. That was a polite way for him to say that he 
  didn't want me to be a part of his business.

  "What are your plans?" he asked me.

  "Not sure," I said. "Not straight, that's for sure."

  He nodded and smiled. "We better take the field."

  The game went smoothly until the sixth inning, when the catcher 
  from the West team ran over Eduardo in order to prevent a double 
  play. It wasn't a slide -- it was a football tackle that knocked 
  Eduardo flat on his back.

  A fight broke in almost every single game we played, so this was 
  no big deal. Eduardo got up and kicked the catcher in the 
  stomach. From his stance, it was obvious Eduardo had done some 
  Thai boxing, fists held up next to his head, ready for anything. 
  Every time the catcher came close to him, Eduardo kicked him 
  somewhere and kept him away. After his fifth attempt, the 
  catcher whipped out a knife from his ankle and slashed Eduardo's 
  leg.

  It didn't take long for Eduardo, even with one of his legs 
  injured, to take the knife away from the catcher. Eduardo had 
  him down and was about to stick the knife somewhere when I 
  kicked it out of his hand.

  He came after me, but I kicked him in the injured leg, which 
  immediately knocked him down to the ground. Then the guards 
  came, and it was over.



  Eduardo and I didn't talk for the rest of the time at Greenwood, 
  not until the last day anyway. I was afraid he was angry at me, 
  and with so little time left, avoiding him wasn't a very big 
  deal. Softball was over, red and brown leaves were blowing in 
  from somewhere outside, and freedom was a few days away.

  I was in the rec room, watching a rerun of Barnaby Jones. I was 
  surprised to find myself feeling nostalgic -- this was the last 
  time I was going to be in this room, the last time I was going 
  to have to move the chair under the television, step up, and 
  pull on the on-off knob. I was lost deep in my thoughts when 
  Eduardo sat down next to me. It took me a few minutes before I 
  realized he was there. He didn't say anything to me, so I didn't 
  say anything back. Barnaby, a gun ready in his hand, was running 
  after a man in a rabbit suit.

  "I've been thinking," Eduardo said.

  I didn't say anything.

  "I'm not going into construction," he said. And that's all he 
  really had to say. I still didn't say anything. Barnaby had 
  caught up to the man in the rabbit suit. "Put your hands up," he 
  said, and the rabbit-man, complete with painted whiskers and a 
  bright red nose, slowly raised his hands in the air.



  "For a retard, he got us pretty good," Eduardo said. I looked at 
  Chuckie in confusion. "I just got off the phone with Merlo. Tony 
  sold the ruby to Montrose."

  "Sold it?" Two-Tone asked, rocking his huge head side to side. 
  It was a habit of his whenever he didn't understand something. 
  Two-Tone and Grease were playing ping-pong. I had winners.

  "It couldn't have been all an act, though," I said, looking at 
  Eduardo. I could tell what he was thinking. "Working for 
  somebody else."

  "Bingo." Eduardo watched the little white ball go to and fro. 
  "He didn't sell it to just anybody, he sold it to Montrose."

  "That ties him with our good friend Columbus," Chuckie said.

  "Columbus," Eduardo said.

  "Shit!" Two-Tone blew an easy shot.

  "What are we gonna do about it?" Chuckie asked.

  "Slice slice slice the motherfucker," Grease said, slamming the 
  tiny ball down the line.

  "Shit," Two-Tone said, tossing me the paddle. "Your turn." 
  Grease was on a hot streak, and I was worse at this game than 
  Two-Tone.

  Eduardo walked over to the balcony, lost in his thoughts. 
  Chuckie and Two-Tone were watching Mighty Mouse on TV. And 
  Grease was already trouncing me with his spin serves.

  Eduardo walked back in from the balcony and picked up the 
  phone. Pushing a couple of buttons, he went back out to the 
  balcony. It was a brief call, but a few seconds later, the phone 
  rang, and he answered it.

  "I do believe some rather unappealing events will soon take 
  flight," Grease said in a completely believable British accent.

  I nodded, thinking the same thing.

  "Get your stuff," Eduardo said to all of us. "We're taking a 
  little trip." We all looked at him, wondering where we were 
  going. "About a three-and-a-half hour drive up north. We'll take 
  the van."

  "You found Tony," Chuckie said.

  "At a motel in Upper Wayne," Eduardo said. "Come on, let's get 
  this over with."



  In the beginning, it was me, Eduardo, and Chuckie. Chuckie was a 
  serious bookie, and for the first couple of months we lived with 
  him and his girlfriend in a little shack overlooking the ocean. 
  Eduardo knew Chuckie from his hometown. According to legend, 
  they've been bad ever since the second grade, when they stole 
  cigarettes from the teacher's lounge.

  The first thing we did when we got out of Greenwood was 
  household robbery. We scouted the upper middle class 
  neighborhoods and got them one by one. After the fifth one or 
  so, each town would set up a neighborhood watch -- which was a 
  signal for us to move onto the next town. "Then after a couple 
  of months, we can go back for a couple more jobs or so," Eduardo 
  said. He compared it to crop rotation -- by not overdoing any of 
  the towns and going back to them after a short wait, we could 
  keep the jobs continuously flowing.

  Eduardo was a natural-born leader, one of those types that 
  people helplessly turn to for whatever reason. He was like a 
  wise old man, a father, and a mother -- everything. He was also 
  a visionary, but not a talker. He was a doer. What he wanted he 
  got, but he never got it alone. He needed us like we need him.

  Grease was the next to arrive, the blackest man I'd ever seen. 
  At night all you could see were his eyes, and maybe his teeth if 
  he were smiling, which wasn't often. He was from West Virginia, 
  and before we picked him up he owed some serious money. Eduardo 
  lent him thirty grand out of his own pocket, which still has 
  Chuckie and me wondering just what was going through his mind. I 
  mean he made the right call and all -- Grease turned out to be 
  an essential part of our business -- but at the time, the move 
  seemed completely unlike Eduardo.

  Grease's real name was Clement something -- something really 
  hard to say. Chuckie told me how he got his nickname. Just after 
  turning sixteen, Grease got a job at a diner as a dishwasher. 
  Somebody pissed him off (something to do with his sister, who 
  was murdered when she was just ten), and this is what Grease 
  does: he goes to the thing that fries chicken parts, the hot 
  thing with boiling oil, and he pours it over the guy, head to 
  toe, covers this guy with grease. "Grease! Grease! Grease!" the 
  guy yelled, falling to the floor and tossing and jerking in 
  pain. Then to top it off, Grease takes a match and lights the 
  guy on fire.

  Two-Tone was a much easier going guy. He wasn't much for taking 
  care of serious business, but then again, neither was I. Only 
  Eduardo and Grease have killed people. Two-Tone was his real 
  name, the name that was on his birth certificate (he has a copy 
  of it shrunk down to wallet size so he could show it to people). 
  "Dad had a two-tone Chevy Camaro, and that's where I shot out," 
  he told me. "And by the time I was getting hair on my balls, 
  this started to happen," he said, pointing at a part of his head 
  where the hair wasn't as dark as the rest. It was completely 
  natural, a part of his hair turning silvery-white. So the name 
  Two-Tone made more sense than ever. He'd dyed it regularly since 
  he was identified by a witness as a "guy with skunky hair."

  Two-Tone was a big guy, and fast, too. When he became a part of 
  our business, we got real serious, going after larger houses in 
  better neighborhoods. Chateaus and mansions, and when Tony came 
  along we got big.

  Tony. We knew very little about him. Maybe he wasn't as stupid 
  as we had thought. He didn't seem like a bad guy. Chuckie had 
  known him a long while back, so we thought if Chuckie knew him 
  he was okay.

  But now we were going to have to take care of him.



  We didn't talk very much on the road. I-75 is a calm drive, rows 
  of evergreens standing tall and straight, so thick that you 
  can't see anything but brown and green. Every so often there's a 
  sign for adopting a part of the highway for clean-up, so we 
  talked about doing something like that, but we soon fell back to 
  silence.

  I think Grease likes the act of killing, but even he doesn't 
  like the silence that comes before death. It's like we're having 
  a pre-funeral. None of us hate Tony, but what he did was 
  unforgivable. We all risked our lives for that ring.

  We got to Upper Wayne by sunset. Our motel is right off the 
  highway, Upper Wayne Motel, not terribly creative. The only neon 
  light that works on the sign is the word "Upper," flickering on 
  and off randomly, as if it can't make up its mind.

  We asked the motel guy about Tony, and he shook his head. Grease 
  showed him his gun. He gave us a key and told us to go to B8, 
  which was on the second floor, the fourth room on the right.

  We used the key and open the door. Tony was in bed, watching TV 
  while munching on some chips and drinking Budweiser. He looked 
  at us and that's all he has to do, that look. Guilt, sadness, 
  self-pity -- and at the end of it all, fear. It all came through 
  so clearly that he didn't have to say a single word.

  Eduardo and Grease both pointed their guns, and they each fired 
  two bullets, two to the head and two to the heart.

  Oak, Ax and Raven   by G.L. Eikenberry
========================================
...................................................................
  In olden days, life was simpler. All you had to worry about was 
  providing a home and food for your family, and stocking up 
  enough wood for the winter. Oh, and the occasional sentient 
  tree.
...................................................................


  See him? Over there, a few yards off, approaching the stand of 
  youngish oaks. A young peasant by the look of him. Is he trying 
  to grow a beard or just lax about shaving? He seems dressed well 
  enough -- at least, well enough for a peasant -- the vest is 
  leather, after all. And look at the ax. You can often tell a 
  great deal about a man from the tools he carries, and that ax is 
  quality.

  This is the third time he's come back to that particular oak 
  this morning. I'm willing to bet he truly means to put that fine 
  ax to it this time.

  "Yes, Flek, I do say so to myself, this is the tree. It is a 
  _special_ tree she wants, and it is a special tree I've picked. 
  If I be any judge of tree-flesh at all, Flek, I do say so to 
  myself, I've picked a fine tree. Just the right portion of 
  wisdom, and of straightness, and of -- well, the right portion 
  of all those other things she spoke into my forgetful ears. I 
  have picked a tree 'twill suit our purposes wonderfully.

  "The bestest part will suit itself to the crafting of the finest 
  of cradles for the son which my Arda will bear me on the other 
  side of this fast-approaching winter. The other parts will feed 
  the rich warmth of our hearth, proof against the cracks and 
  fissures that corrupt our frail habitation.

  "Yes, Flek, I do say so to myself, you have chosen well. There 
  will be no fault for Arda to find with this tree."

  This peasant is a talkative one! Although I begin to harbor 
  certain doubts concerning the initial assessment of quality. 
  Perhaps he filched the ax.

  And lazy! Laziness fertilized with wanton verbiage to yield a 
  most unbecoming harvest. Look at him as he as he pulls a scrap 
  of rough, unmarketable cowhide from his bag and places it on the 
  ground to sit. The cowhide testifies to the premeditated nature 
  of his sloth. He leans himself against the very oak he intends 
  to fell. He looks over this way as if to say he has done 
  something deserving of either rest or the crusts of bread and 
  curds he is this very instant stuffing into his garlic-reeking 
  maw, already over-full with crooked, yellow teeth. He spent the 
  entire morning meandering about looking at a few trees, and yet 
  I'd not be surprised if he were next to settle himself in for a 
  nap.

  There, see! He yawns and stretches. But, wait, I judge him 
  over-harshly. To give credit where credit is due, he stretches 
  to rise, apparently ready to heft that fine ax rather than 
  sleep.

  But, wait, he walks off -- meaning, perhaps to leave the work 
  for another day -- or --

  Why does he come _this_ way?

  The bumpkin means to fell the _wrong_ tree!

  I have not spent these many seasons spreading my vast and 
  complex network of roots throughout this district -- I have not 
  stood this ground for scores of years only to fall victim to an 
  obviously pilfered ax wielded by a prattling, hollow-headed, 
  landless oaf! Such indignities can scarce be -- ooommfff!

  That will be enough of that, you ignorant, insolent, irreverent 
  young -- uuurrrnnk!

  Very well. I shall just give -- him -- a jolt -- of -- his own 
  -- medicine -- communicated -- down -- along -- the handle -- of 
  that -- fine -- ax -- and see -- how he -- ... -- there!

  And perhaps, for good measure, I'll summon up a raven to follow 
  him back to his own rootage. We might even manage to infiltrate 
  a small amount of good sense and, perhaps, even a mote of 
  respect into that igneous head of his.



  "...yes, yes, of course, my dearest Arda, I fully comprehend. I 
  _did_, my dearest, get myself a goodly start on the job, but I 
  must assure you that the finishing of it will make no small 
  feat! I have chosen us the very finest of trees, but, being 
  such, it has its own mind about it. Its very own mind, I assure 
  you, and it very much prefers standing its own ground to being 
  felled for our son's cradle."

  "Can it be, Flek of Amber Hill, that you are even more 
  feebleminded than my father warned? Can you truly expect me to 
  believe this cat vomit you spew about trees resisting your ax? 
  You've little enough time left before the harvest to bring down 
  a suitable tree and lay it open to season whilst you busy 
  yourself with our lord's work. You'd best not waste any more 
  precious time with your laziness and your foolish piffle about 
  unwilling trees."

  "There are things in this world about which a woman knows 
  nothing -- "

  "I know a great deal about that sort of mumbling under your 
  breath! It was a form of insolence my father often tried against 
  my mother, and it served him as poorly as it shall serve you."

  "Woman, you vex me greatly!"

  "Vexing shall be the very least of your worries if you don't get 
  you back to the wood and -- what is that racket of rapping and 
  thumping at our door?"

  "Oh, dear me. How can it be, my dearest wife, that two so dear 
  to each other can be so constantly a-quarreling? I am certain 
  this boiling of our bloods can be of no benefit to the man-child 
  you have stewing in your belly. We must make our peace -- "

  "If it's peace you want, do something to silence that infernal 
  commotion outside our door!"

  "Of course, my dearest, I shall -- aaawk!"

  "Get it out! -- get that beast out of my house -- scat, you 
  demon -- scat, you -- begone!"

  "It's useless, dearest Arda. The beast has taken up a perch in 
  the rafters. Well beyond your reach or mine."

  "So what, then do you propose to do about it, dearest numskull? 
  Leave it there day in and day out until it expires by 
  starvation? Or, worse still, leave it there to preside over the 
  birthing of our child? I tell you this, Flek of Amber Hill, and 
  I tell you true: There will be no raven in this house as long as 
  I am here. Or no me in this house as long as it is here."

  "But Arda, most dearest -- you can't -- surely -- where?"

  "You can fetch me and the child I carry back from the safety of 
  my mother's house after, and only after, you have rid our own 
  house of that hateful beast and its dark and evil stare."



  The mighty and venerable oak sends up sprites of saplings from 
  the outermost reaches of roots recurving to probe the surface of 
  the earth, which gives itself to her care. The sprites lift free 
  and dance a slow hymn of celebration of their tree, gathering 
  acorns, which, in turn, give rise to ever greater numbers of 
  sprites. The growing congregation of life envelopes the monotony 
  of the drudge's dwelling. Within, the wife of two or possibly 
  three generations since the original insult weeps bitterly as an 
  enormous raven draws one, then another and another withered 
  sapling from the portal of her womb until, at last, mercifully, 
  her consciousness flees, screaming.

  Then it is the peasant, himself, who cries out, awakened by the 
  screaming from the crest of the vision carried to him by my 
  raven.

  The dim-witted peasant has moved himself out onto his door path 
  to sleep beneath the moon. It appears that he fears moon-madness 
  less than he fears sleeping beneath a roof shared by my 
  messenger.

  "Go. Go, damn you. Go back to your oak, you demon-spawned 
  apparition. My need of tree flesh is great, but not so great 
  that I can't take it elsewhere. It's my Arda that needs 
  satisfying, and she's not so demanding as all that when it comes 
  to tree flesh. I had no way of telling I had chosen me an oak so 
  great in spirit. I can be blamed, yes, blamed for -- well, I 
  know not precisely what. But surely whatever blame may be due me 
  is not blame beyond forgiveness."

  He throws open the door.

  "Leave us now. Leave our roof trees. Go back to your oak and 
  communicate my capitulation. Go! Be gone!"



  I am strong, but not hard. As he returns to my grove with the 
  next dawn, bearing, of his own volition, offerings of fresh 
  water and well-seasoned manure, my own reward awaits this rather 
  pathetic creature. Perhaps I did not, after all, misjudge him by 
  the quality of his ax.

  I watch him now as he struggles to carry off the last of the 
  pieces he has hewn from the plentiful windfall I left him from a 
  failing lower branch.

  Wave   by Craig Boyko
=======================
...................................................................
  It isn't hard to imagine a world without freedom. But try to 
  imagine a world without privacy -- a commodity without which 
  there can be no freedom.
...................................................................


  You can't see the street. I suppose you could, if you looked 
  directly down, possibly while you were walking, although it 
  would work better if you stood still. But you're not supposed to 
  stop and look at your feet, or the street. You're supposed to 
  keep moving, even if you've got no place to get to. The crowd 
  gets edgy if they're just standing around.

  It's the people. You can't walk down the street without running 
  into one; or in ten minutes, a hundred.

  I don't know where I'm going. I guess work, so I can save up 
  enough for another room with...

  I would slap myself, hard, but I might elbow somebody in the 
  face and instigate a riot. It's impossible to get into a fight 
  with just one person.

  And I keep forgetting.

  I think that's dangerous, psychologically, when you keep 
  thinking that a part of your life that's now gone is actually 
  still there, and you just take it for granted. Then you feel 
  like hitting yourself, crying, mourning.

  I never did mourn. And it's been two months. I've been counting 
  the days on my toes.



  I worked one day, and the manager, Bill with the green hair, he 
  seemed pretty impressed with me. He even told me to come back 
  whenever I could. And that's a rarity. But the problem is I 
  don't think I'll ever see Bill or his little food hut again, 
  because I can't remember what it looked like from the outside or 
  what it was called.

  I hear that's what usually happens. Which is why you consider 
  yourself lucky to get one paycheck at the end of the day.

  I remember I used that paycheck for an 8-by-8, partitioned with 
  delaminating blue foam, and behind that rusting corrugated 
  steel. There wasn't a lock on the door, and you could hear what 
  was going on in the other rooms, but it was worth it. I'd never 
  been in an empty room before. I had been saving up for a month. 
  Molly chipped in, too, with the watches and wallets she had 
  lifted from the undulating mass of humanity out on the street.

  I wonder where Molly --



  Stop it.



  My feet and legs are turning numb, becoming rancid blocks of 
  wood. I have to find a place to sit down, quick. I've heard 
  stories, where the wave just rolls over you.

  "Darwinism," Molly used to say, smiling contentedly at my 
  confused expression.



  I see flashing neon and tilt my head up to the emblazoned "Sit 
  'n' Dry" sign that looks like it's a mile up. Beside the sign is 
  a gilt-framed 3-D cutout of Uncle Luis, set off by seven 
  multi-hued spotlights on the roof of the building. Uncle Luis: 
  saint, supplier, and quasi-legal drug cartel. 'Course, when you 
  own 44 percent of the Drug Op Force, legal and illegal become 
  hazy concepts.

  The Sit 'n' Dry is free, but there's a time limit. Supposedly 
  Uncle Luis supplies the charity to the weary myriad of humanity, 
  in hopes that his benevolence will pay off in other areas of 
  business. I guess it's economic acumen: I'd go to a LuisBurger 
  before a Burger-Burger, even though I can currently afford 
  neither. Nor, I'm sure, can any of the people who actually need 
  to use the Sit 'n' Dry.

  "PR," Molly would say jauntily, straining over the ubiquitous 
  noise of people, as we stood in a corner of another nameless 
  bar, talking, since sitting always costs extra.



  Stop it...



  The place is packed, as always, but the bouncers at the eight 
  front doors try to limit the inflow to match the outflow. Still, 
  there's always about a hundred people standing around inside, 
  perfectly quiet, just waiting for someone to stand up for the 
  bathroom, or to leave altogether, or even for a bouncer to come 
  over and yank them out of their seat because they've been there 
  over two hours.

  There's no sleeping here, but usually you can get away with a 
  good hour if you rest your head on your hand. Uncle Luis also 
  owns Nite-Lite, which is a lot like this place, but the chairs 
  recline and the time limit is twelve hours, and it costs 100 
  bucks to get in the door.

  I see a bouncer talking to someone down the furthest right 
  aisle, number 59 that is, and I head for it instinctively. About 
  five others circle in on the possibility but stop dead about ten 
  feet away. You can get kicked out for not giving the sitters 
  their space. So you're not even supposed to walk down the 
  three-foot wide aisle unless you're pretty sure you're gonna get 
  a chair.

  The woman in the chair stands up, and I keep walking. She steps 
  away from the chair, following the bouncer out to the front, and 
  I'm a good three feet closer than all the others. I get it by 
  two feet, sit down and sneer at the languid guy who was the 
  closest. He backs off quickly, holding his hands up in a gesture 
  of peace, and hurries away, probably heading for the far left 
  aisle. He knows you're not supposed to run for the chairs. You 
  can get kicked out for that.

  I sit and just stare at the people walking around like vultures, 
  some of them wincing with each step. I've heard stories where 
  some people just collapse after days of waiting for a chair, and 
  the bouncers pick up their bodies, and nobody ever sees them 
  again.

  Of course, nobody ever sees anyone again, unless you're tied 
  together, or holding hands.

  Molly and I held hands for almost three weeks straight.



  A lot of people rent the rooms for sex. Molly and I could hear 
  them, in the adjacent rooms, their involuntary bestial grunts.

  We didn't. We sat on the bed and held each other for awhile, 
  savoring the space about us, the absolute emptiness of this 
  8-by-8 that became our world for three hours.

  We talked. In soft tones, always vaguely aware of the invisible 
  others behind the walls, who probably couldn't have cared less 
  if we were discussing assassinating Uncle Luis himself.

  Molly told me once about books, and she laughed mellifluously at 
  my puzzled stare.

  She told me about the encyclopedia she had found in a tiny 
  bathroom cubicle, where it was being torn apart page by page and 
  used as toilet paper. She had taken it, tucked away in her red 
  windbreaker that was her father's, disregarding all posted and 
  implicit laws.

  She told me how she carried that encyclopedia around for three 
  days straight, reading as much of what was left as possible. She 
  told me how difficult it was to read while walking, being jabbed 
  and shoved by other faceless and nameless bodies.

  I was nonplussed, utterly awed that she could read. Her father 
  taught her, she said, before he had to sell the abandoned 
  pesticide shed that they lived in. Before they got split up, he 
  gave her that red windbreaker she wore everywhere. It had been 
  raining the day Molly was propelled irrevocably into the real 
  world.



  Molly talked about roads. Like the street? I asked her. No, she 
  said. Roads. Roads for vehicles, for passengers, for buses, for 
  transportation. Roads that were paved twice a year, cleaned 
  every other month by huge machines with cleaning bristle-brushes 
  set underneath.

  She said she read about them in the encyclopedia. The 
  encyclopedia claimed that, at one time, everyone had a car, and 
  everyone had a house and a garage to store their car, and kids 
  who grew up to be 18 before leaving home.

  I told her that was impossible. There was no longer room for 
  houses or anything so silly as roads.

  She agreed, sadly, nodding her head as her black hair brushed 
  against the green foam that we lay upon.

  "But," she said, "suppose there were once. I think the book is 
  right. Suppose there were. Maybe there still are, somewhere."

  "But who would use them? There would no be room, with all the 
  people. I mean, look at the street..."

  "Maybe," she said. "But maybe, I think, the rich people could 
  afford them. How else would someone like Uncle Luis visit other 
  countries, all the Luis-Pizzas?"

  "Helicopters," I explained, matter-of-factly. Once, I heard a 
  guy in a bar talk about helicopters. And he hadn't looked very 
  drunk.



  Molly talked about babies. After a moment of silence, just 
  holding each other, listening to the sounds around us coming 
  from behind rusted iron and faulty fiberglass doors. She talked 
  about how the explosion was over, and the shrinking was going to 
  begin. Like the Big Bang theory of evolution. How humans would 
  be lucky if there was every a bang again, or even a whimper.

  I didn't know what she was talking about. "Babies," she said, 
  staring up at the peeling plaster of the ceiling, where chunks 
  were missing and you could see the mahogany slant of the rusted 
  steel roof.

  "There's not going to be any more," she whispered, her soft, 
  warm hand in mine.

  "What do you mean?"

  "I mean there won't be any more babies. There's sex, on this 
  kind of small scale," she said, gesturing at the blue foam walls 
  and beyond. "But even if there are babies, how do they grow up? 
  How do they even get born? Uncle Luis doesn't have a Quick-Stop 
  Baby Hut. Most likely, the mothers die, and the babies with 
  them."

  I thought about this in silence.

  "Is that why you don't?" I asked finally.

  "Don't what?"

  "Want to have sex?"

  She laughed her melodic laugh and leaned over to kiss my cheek. 
  "No," she said, squeezing my hand.

  "Good," I said, not sure if it was.

  Silence settled down, comfortable and warm. Above us, erratic 
  drops of rain struck the roof, creating a soothing metallic 
  patter. Molly's hand, dry and soft, brushed my chin.



  I guess I've fallen asleep, because a bouncer is pulling me up 
  out of my chair. I look back at it longingly, but I don't fight 
  to break the grip. When he sees I'm going quietly and that 
  someone else has already got the chair, he lets go of my 
  shoulder and walks on to find other misdemeanors.

  I bump into someone, which is not uncommon, but I turn to look 
  anyway. A woman looks back at me, not moving amongst the chairs 
  like the others, circling in for the kill. Just staring back at 
  me, appraisingly, very calm and quiet, a shadow of a smile on 
  her lips.

  "What?" I say, only vaguely aware that I'm speaking out loud to 
  a stranger.

  "Sorry," she says, the playful smile more apparent. In her hand, 
  she is holding an old Coke can, and she takes a quick pull from 
  it. A single clear drop of water trails down her cheek. "I just 
  kind of noticed your situation."

  "So?"

  "You tired?"

  "Isn't everybody?"

  "I know a place, cheaper than the Nite-Lite, if you're looking."

  "How cheap?"

  "How cheap you looking for?"

  "I'm broke."

  "Perfect," she says, taking another sip from the water in her 
  can. I watch her lips closely, enrapt as they conform to the 
  shape of the aluminum. "Follow me."



  I stay close, trying not to touch her or get in her way, but 
  also trying to stay less than a foot away, lest I get cut off by 
  the crowd and lose her. She doesn't turn around to look at me, 
  even when she turns into the alley.

  I've seen alleys before, from the street, but never really 
  entered one. The consensus is that the dangerous people hang out 
  in them, wielding knives and guns and electric prodders. All of 
  which I've heard a lot about, but never actually seen.

  Plus, alleys are supposed to be where they dump the bodies. The 
  street is full, and there's no room for those who just can't 
  stand any longer. And since everyone's scared of the alleys 
  anyway...

  The alley isn't empty, but it's surprisingly close. A few people 
  seem to be entering warily from either street at any given 
  moment, a few others are hurrying out, and some even sit down 
  with their backs to the faded gray brick, oblivious to the 
  dangers that are ostensibly skulking about behind every corner 
  and every rusted fire escape. No bodies... There's one, lying 
  down in a small dark space beneath an overhang. But he might be 
  just sleeping. Yes, his arm twitches.

  Still, it's amazing: there's no more than 30 people dispersed 
  about the entire alley. Which probably amounts to 20 square feet 
  of space per person. Amazing.

  The woman stops halfway to the other street, turns right into a 
  small alcove in the brick, below a metal skeleton of steps and 
  rail that looks ready to crash down to the cracked black cement. 
  The orange lamplight and the red neon glow from the streets is 
  nonexistent here. It's a quiet blackness that seems so 
  impossible, so far away from any reality, that it must be a 
  vacuum in the very fabric of sight and sound.

  The woman turns to me, a quick smile shooting out at me through 
  the dark. Just making sure I'm still with her, but her look 
  tells me that she wouldn't go searching for me if I wasn't.

  She pulls something from her coat; her right hand has 
  mysteriously lost the Coke-can of water. From the looks of it, 
  she is now holding a key. I'm sure of it. I've heard of keys 
  before, I think probably from Molly, because I've never really 
  known anyone else who had ever read through a volume of 
  encyclopedia.

  It's small, rectangular, white, and has a black strip on one end 
  she runs through a dead black box set upon the brick. The box 
  comes to life for a second, a green flash of digits and red LED 
  eyes peering out into the blackness, then it's dead and silent 
  again. Beyond the wall, a metallic slide and click, like bolts 
  moving out of position.

  She pushes the door open and is inside so fast that I don't have 
  time to look for a doorknob or to figure out how the door opened 
  before I'm following her into deeper darkness.

  Slick-chink.

  I back up. The door is icy metal on my spine. The cold sends a 
  shiver of fear up my back, into the tensed muscles in my neck.

  Here I am, locked indoors, off the street, in an oppressive cage 
  of inky black and piercing cold.

  But then the lights come on.



  My breath leaves my lungs, but I'm not sure at first why. And 
  then it comes to me, inexorable and supernal.

  It's the _space._

  This place is huge. There's got to be at least 350 square feet 
  of raw open space, possibly as much as 400. God, yes, the walls 
  are definitely 20 feet...

  There's a few chairs, a cupboard sticking out along the far 
  wall, and what looks like a fridge, and some other small square 
  machine that's plugged into the wall...

  Christ, _electricity._

  And a bed, enormous, and what could possibly be a television, 
  though much smaller and older than those mounted in the 
  LuisBurgers above the tables while you eat -- that is, if you 
  can afford to pay the $300 for a table...

  Of course, I've seen rooms this size, and I've seen rooms 200 
  times larger. But never, never in all my life, have I seen a 
  room this size with only two people in it. And one of them me.

  I notice the woman suddenly, as if for the first time. She is 
  standing ten feet away from me, smiling calmly, showing perfect 
  yellow teeth, and she seems to be the only tangible symbol of 
  reality in this surrealistic picture of emptiness.

  It scares me and enthralls me, equally and simultaneously.

  "Like it?" comes a voice, and it seems an eternity before I 
  match it to this woman standing before me.

  My lungs rasp out a choked breath, but speaking still seems an 
  impossible feat.

  "I know what you're probably thinking. It's huge, I know. I've 
  never actually brought anybody here before, so I guess I'm used 
  to it, but I can imagine, after the street..."

  I find my voice, small and tinny and miles away. "You... you 
  _own_ this?"

  "Yeah. My dad passed the ownership down to me. Got the deed 
  locked up in that safe over there."

  Sure enough, there is a safe over in the corner, sleek black and 
  shiny.

  The woman laughs, and the muscles in my neck and shoulders that 
  were pulled tight as arrow strings loosen slightly. I force my 
  hands to open. I uncurl my toes. I blink once, a full second, 
  and breathe deeply.

  "This place," I say, my voice no longer shaking and resonating 
  from somewhere near the bottom of a deep well, "must have cost 
  you a fortune." I'm not even sure if there is such a thing as 
  private ownership anymore. It makes my mind race back to Molly, 
  how she used to talk about houses, and how I thought it was 
  insanity....

  The woman smiles wanly, walks a few steps and sits down in a 
  chair. She motions for me to sit. I can't feel my legs, so I 
  just shake my head politely.

  "My dad owned a chain of water suppliers. Built it up from the 
  plumbing, and bought out most of that underground shit that 
  nobody wants anyway. I think before he died he was worth close 
  to 500 million. Everybody needs water, right? He sold out 98 
  percent of his holdings to buy this place, this one room. Gave 
  it to me a week before he died. Guess when you look at it that 
  way, this place cost about ten million per square yard."

  "Free parking," is all I can say, sitting down before my legs 
  collapse. (I said that once, in the 8-by-8, must have been. 
  Molly laughed, sweet laughter like champagne over rocks. 
  Brushing a hair back, looking into my eyes, her own lit up deep 
  aquatic blue. Wondered what the hell that was supposed to mean. 
  Just an expression, I guess, I told her. Funny, she said, how 
  the craziest things from the past can mutate into the craziest 
  things in the present, with no discernible transition. Something 
  about idioms, she said, running her hand through my hair, 
  declaring how impossible it would be for anyone else to learn 
  this language if everybody didn't already speak it.... But I 
  wasn't listening, just watching her perfect pink lips forming 
  the intricate shapes of the many words I had never even 
  heard...)

  And then I must have collapsed, somehow, because I'm no longer 
  in the fantastical dimension where beautiful women on the street 
  take you back to their impossible rooms, 400 square feet in 
  size...

  But then where am I?

  I'm comfortable, and warm, and I'm lying down. These facts alone 
  surprise me. I had no money for anything so exorbitant as a bed.

  A hand is on my shoulder, light and warm, moving ever so 
  slightly back and forth. Not a waking gesture...

  I turn and see the face of the woman on the street, lit up by 
  flashing blue neon light that filters in through a dirty plastic 
  pane above the bed. She smiles, shy yet intimate. Her hand is 
  still on my shoulder.

  "Are you okay?" she asks, her voice a whisper.

  "Yeah... I'm fine. Guess I really was tired."

  "It's okay, if you want to rest. Stay as long as you like."

  I don't say anything. Just watch her.

  After probably five minutes, a private eternity, my hand moves 
  to her cheek. My thumb brushes her skin slowly.

  Her smile from the street returns, confident and serene.



  "Why me?"

  The light from the sun is gone now, hidden from the night, lost 
  beyond the horizon. The only light that falls on her face is the 
  continuous blue flare from the street. When it sputters and 
  dies, sometimes minutes at a time, I can only make out the 
  outline of her jaw, her limp blond hair, the white t-shirt that 
  she wears.

  "What do you mean, why you?"

  "Why am I here?"

  "I don't know," she says, very quiet. "It sometimes... gets very 
  lonely."

  "I know." (Molly and I talked about this once. Or rather, Molly 
  talked about it, while I half-listened, fully in love with her. 
  She said something about the heavy irony of the situation, the 
  poetic justice. How the street was packed with strangers, 
  millions and millions, and every individual was still so 
  desperately lonely...)



  We lie like that for hours, blissfully content in each other's 
  warmth, miles away from the wave of humanity just beyond that 
  single pane of plastic.

  And still, I can't help but think about Molly.



  By the first gray tint of morning light, she strokes the hair 
  from my eyes. Neither of us has slept but has reached some other 
  form of consciousness. The peace of sleep, the perception of 
  wakefulness.

  Her hand runs down my back. Her lips meet mine. Above us, a 
  single drop of rain taps the plastic, immediately followed by 
  many more.



  I sit up in gray darkness, suddenly cold and tired. Outside, the 
  rain pours down. Behind me, on the bed, she reaches for me. I 
  brush her grasp away.

  "I can't," I say.

  She does not sit up suddenly, does not grab me from behind, does 
  not beg me to explain. She stays silent for a moment. Then, 
  simply, "Why?"

  "Molly."

  She sits up beside me, does not reach for me. Sits quietly, her 
  hands in her lap, staring at the vast expanse of floor. And in 
  her silence, I sense her understanding.

  "What happened to her?" she asks. I stand up, grab my coat from 
  a chair by the bed. I pause, then turn.

  "The wave. I was holding her hand, and we got pushed apart by 
  the people, and she just got backed into a corner. The wave just 
  rolled over her."

  I turn quickly, head for the door, fumble for the latch. She 
  calls out from behind me. I tear the door open. I hesitate. I 
  turn around.

  "What?"

  In her face, I see sympathy and deep sorrow. Sorrow not just for 
  me, but for herself, and maybe even for the damn wave. And in 
  her face, somewhere, I see Molly.

  That's why I have to leave.

  "I don't even know your name," she says.

  "I don't know yours."

  She smiles hollowly. "Then I guess it's okay." The door closes 
  behind me, _slick-chink._



  The rain is solid gray bars, soaking the gray concrete, the gray 
  flow of people. The flood of people, nondescript and cold, could 
  be the result of the rain.

  It clears up eventually, amidst the general sigh of relief from 
  the crowd.

  No one speaks, and the river flows silently on, branching out 
  occasionally, feeding the neon-framed franchises that line the 
  street, only to be spit back out into the torpid tide.

  Sometime, much later, a distant face smiles at me, framed by the 
  ripple of heads and shoulders. It's Molly's face, or the 
  nameless girl's, or maybe a figment dancing on my eyes. The hand 
  belonging to the face waves to me, then disappears altogether. 
  Behind and all around me, the wave goads me on.
