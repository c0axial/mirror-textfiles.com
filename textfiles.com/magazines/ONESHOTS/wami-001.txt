        issue one of WAMI (Works of Art that didn't Make It)

        (note-- this thing didn't go off as i wanted it to.  all this really
                proves is that "resurgam" is a dumbass.  i wanted to choose
                the most extremist right wing christian and interview him/her
                to get a quick laugh.  instead i found a dumbass who really
                isn't that funny.  i doubt you'll even want to read this...)
                <except perhaps the last two or three lines>

<Resurgam> kewlio
<Resurgam> what magazine is this exactly anyhow?
<fooled> alright.  the log's on.  for starters, tell me your first name, age,
          sex, age, current faith, and political party.  anything extra would
          be cool as well.
<Resurgam> gees.
<Resurgam> my name is Annelizabeth Kim and i'm 317 year old christian vampire.
<fooled> haha - that's funny.  really tho.
<Resurgam> or to be really serious, i'm 21 and my belief is in Christ
<Resurgam> (actually, that was really serious, hon)
<fooled> political party?
<Resurgam> none
<Resurgam> i'm a female, by the way
<fooled> are you a part of the christian coalition?  what do you think about
         it?
<Resurgam> i'm a youth minister/director/counselor
<Resurgam> i'm not involved in any christian coalition
<fooled> what do you think about it though?
<Resurgam> well... 
<Resurgam> i figure if you want to have a coalition, fine.
<fooled> lack of information to pass judgement?
<Resurgam> well, lack, yes, but from what've seen, it is okay.
<Resurgam> one thing though. 
<Resurgam> i am adamently opposed to prayers in school.
<fooled> why is that?

<Resurgam> prayers? because...
<fooled> because isn't a good enough answer...
<Resurgam> see, the Christians are seeking prayers in school with this weird
           wacked out thought that only christians are the ones that pray.
<Resurgam> but there are others out there in the world with different
           religions and world views
<fooled> don't you feel there should be a separation of church and state in
         this wonderful (ack) country?
<Resurgam> i mean, personally, if that is what you believe, hey, fine. but i
           don't want that shoved into my kid.
<Resurgam> i think there should be a separation.
<Resurgam> from the study of history
<Resurgam> most nations that has had the unity of state and church has had
           some sort of a several century long rebellion.
<fooled> true.  do you feel that christianity is the only "right" religion?
<Resurgam> yes, i feel that Christianity is the only right religion.
<fooled> so separation of church and state, in your opinion, would keep your
         child from learning of other religions?
<Resurgam> no, it would keep my child from learning it in school  (outside of
           maybe some history courses or philosophy courses.)
<fooled> so you would rather teach the child about those religions?
<Resurgam> ...hm... *grin*
<Resurgam> i would rather that i teach my child in a fair manner
<Resurgam> i have friends of all beliefs.
<fooled> eheh that'd be a little biased.  <grin>  - but here's one a little
         off topic.. who do you think you'll vote for in '96?
<Resurgam> that one ex-general if he decides to run.
<fooled> colin powell?
<Resurgam> yeah, that dood.
<Resurgam> i would want my child to form his or her own opinion.
<Resurgam> gag!
<Resurgam> biased? hehe
<Resurgam> hm... let's see...... hm...
<fooled> didn't you just say though that christianity is the only right
         religion?  what would you do if your child decided to switch over to
         another faith?
<Resurgam> you know, i think i'm speaking a bit fast, but i doubt that my kid
           would.
<fooled> ah... do you feel that religion is becoming less important as
         generations go on?
<Resurgam> actually, i think it's gotten a bit more important.
<Resurgam> not just christianity, but religion in general.
<fooled> actually, i think you're wrong.  most people i've talked to say their
         children really don't care one way or another about religion.  what
         do you think would spawn these feelings?
<fooled> do you think their music (nirvana, white zombie, pavement, etc)
<Resurgam> spawn what feelings about what?
<fooled> their lack of interest in religion.
<Resurgam> youc an't ask a kid who's 10 what his feelings of zoraostrianism
<Resurgam> that's rather obvious.
<fooled> well i'm not talking of a child who's 10.  i'm talking of kids who
         are 15-25+...
<Resurgam> you know, kids in all generation is and will be always influenced
           by three major sources: media, parents, friends
<fooled> zoraostrianism doesn't sound too bad either.  i was at one of their
         temples in california.
<Resurgam> well, alright that too. but any many kids know about
<fooled> do you think the popularity of music such as nirvana, white zombie,
         etc has a big effect on them though?
<Resurgam> really now? one of my best friends is a zoro
<Resurgam> i think it does
<Resurgam> let me say something
<fooled> my father is a zoro..
<Resurgam> in every generation... or a time period... hm... let's take the
           impressionist period for one...
<Resurgam> the poems and literature worked with the music and art  etc etc
           etc...
<Resurgam> they work together
<Resurgam> same with the works of like walt whitman... he worked with nature
           and so on and so forth
<fooled> your point?
<Resurgam> these are all working together to fuse in that period's thoughts
           and beliefs to one being... the human race.
<Resurgam> so my point is... OF COURSE IT'S GOING TO AFFECT THEM!
* Resurgam grins
<Resurgam> (iranina zoro or indian zoro?)
<fooled> ah i see.  i think i knew that though.  :)  how do you stand on
         homosexuality?
<Resurgam> iranian, even.
<fooled> <iranian>
<Resurgam> it's wrong.
<Resurgam> (dood, my answers sound anal)
<Resurgam> <kewl>
<fooled> here's the scenerio -- imagine your kid tells you he's/she's gay. 
         what would be your reaction?
<Resurgam> i think God didn't create homosexuals.
<fooled> god creates everybody, right?
<Resurgam> my reations?
<Resurgam> reaction? hehehe
<fooled> reactions, reaction...
<Resurgam> yes, he created everyone but hear me on this one...
<fooled> i'm listening
<Resurgam> God made explicite laws about homosexuality and his dislike of it
<Resurgam> if we are created in his image
<Resurgam> that doesn't say much for either of us, does it?
<Resurgam> i don't believe this biological doodah thingamajgic
<Resurgam> jig
<Resurgam> what i see is just society's way of coming up with one excuse after
           another.
<fooled> guess not.  ah well.  they're actually saying it might be genetic.
<Resurgam> it can't be genetic. heard that. been there, done that. i read up
           on it. ;
<Resurgam> ;>
<fooled> ah.  umm.. how about abortion?
<Resurgam> abortion is not right either although i've had friends who's had
           abortions.
<fooled> what about in cases of incest/rape?
<Resurgam> you figure this...
<Resurgam> taking God out of this for aminute (i've done this arguement
           forever)
<Resurgam> actually, rape babies are extrememly cute and somehow, God has
           blessed them even more.

*** fooled is now known as hotsex

<Resurgam> if a one celled organism is considered to be a living creature...
<Resurgam> uh...
