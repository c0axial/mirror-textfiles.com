    Well, this is the first edition of this paper. I hope it reads OK.
This article is not an original idea. In fact, it is a revision of a
paper by The Ultimate Hacker. It was written up by Booch and Tech Man,
but we had help from several people on ideas. Well, here goes.

  ...........................................................................

    OK, these are the plans for a line surger, made specifically for
those malicious bastards out there who have some enemies on the other
side of the phone line. What it does is, literally, plug the phone line
into the wall socket, thus sending up to 120volts over the lines into
the other person's modem, generally doing quite a bit of damage, if not
frying it.
    The list of materials needed:
        One DPDT switch (double pull double throw)
        One plug (the thing that goes into the wall socket)
        Some wire (phone wire)
    Not very much, is it?

    As to building it. . .
    Cut the phone wire going from your phone to the wall. Connect the
RED and GREEN wires from the wall to the middle two prongs of the switch.
Connect the plug to the top two prongs of the switch. Connect the red and
green wires going to the modem to the two remaining prongs of the switch.
    OK, now that really isn't too hard, but for those of you who don't
think exactly as I do, have a diagram. . .

TO WALL     |   |
            |   |_________GREEN_____TO
            |______________RED______MODEM

    Thats the diagram...
    Now, as to what to do with the thing. Leave the switch on the bottom
position, so that the modem is connected to the wall. This will allow
you to use your modem normally. When you want to send The Surge over the
phone lines, just flip the switch.
    A Warning. . . This model is as of yet untested, as we are going to
wait to build it at my house, not wanting to toast ourselves working
with 120 volts. I recommend leaving it unplugged until you want to use
it, so it is not activated accidentally, and trying it for the first
time on an old phone.
    Well, that about sums it up. If you have any suggestions, write to
Booch or Tech Man on
