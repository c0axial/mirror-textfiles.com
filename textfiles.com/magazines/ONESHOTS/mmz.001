welcome... let's start this off with a few ground rules... we 
(mmz) hate pip the angry youth (sellout).  no, it's more than just a hate, 
it's an extremely bitter taste on the levels of mango peels.  he is the 
natural born killer of m&t, and we really don't like that fellow.

so what are we going to do about it?

we're going to write an ENTIRE ZINE MOCKING HIS ZINE!#@!!@#!@$@#$!@ 
WOW, WE'RE MATURE@!#!@%#@!#$ YEEE HAW#@!$!%@!#$^!@#$

since my recent hiatus from writing pickles has ended, you're going to see 
quite a bit of releases from me.  spurratic yes, but does it have quality? 
i will leave that to you the reader.  some people actually have the 
misconception that i care what people think about my anus;  i have no 
customer base, i have no profits, and i turn girls gay.  this leads me to 
the conclusing that i don't really have to give two flying fucks about 
what some idiot in new jersey/cali/whereever thinks about me, especially 
someone who can't even get a non-angstful handle; but we're not going to say 
any names.

people look forward towards the releases of doomed to obscurity, slinky, 
and other misadventures of mogel that are logged into the 2599 list of 
t-files.  what ever happened to a zine that reviewed other zines within 
itself?  where there is one, there is the other;  where there's the 
performer there is always the critic.  i take this upon myself, i 
self-appoint myself to the level of zine critic.  when there is a new dto 
release, we will be there.  when mogel decides to cross state borders in 
spite of his parole, we will be there.  when an appocolypse-like storm 
comes up the east coast, we will be there to say what rattle had to say 
abou that.  when cerkit decides that the time is right to release a new 
issue of slinky, we will be there.  when pip decides to start up his 
gasp AGAIN, we won't even be in the neighborhood.

you don't think that i want to report on shit _that_ boring?  i may not 
have a life, but i at least have _standards_.

i'll also release reviews on albums, books, movies, and whatever else i 
deem fit to grace the pages of mmz.  stories?  of couse we'll have 
stories here... it wouldn't be a jamesyzine if there weren't any stories.  i 
think that if you're reading my zines, then you have an interest in what 
i put out, so i'd like to know what you'd want me to write about.  maybe 
i'll take someone's input into consideration.
