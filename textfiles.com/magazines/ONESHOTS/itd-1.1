       ABOUT EASI (EQUAL ACCESS TO SOFTWARE AND INFORMATION)
 
Since its founding in 1988 under the EDUCOM umbrella, EASI has
worked to increase access to information technology by persons
with disabilities.  Volunteers from EASI have been instrumental
in the establishment of _Information Technology and Disabilities_
as still another step in this process.  Our mission has been to
serve as a resource primarily to the education community by
providing information and guidance in the area of access to
information  technologies.  We seek to spread this information to
schools, colleges, universities and into the workplace.  EASI
makes extensive use of the internet to disseminate this
information, including two discussion lists:
EASI@SJUVM.STJOHNS.EDU (a general discussion on computer access)
and AXSLIB-L@SJUVM.STJOHNS.EDU (a discussion on library access
issues).  To join either list, send a "subscribe" command to
LISTSERV@SJUVM.STJOHNS.EDU including the name of the discussion
you want to join plus your own first and last name.  EASI also
maintains several items on the St. Johns gopher under the menu
heading "Disability and Rehabilitation Resources".
 
        For further information, contact the EASI Chair:
                    Norman Coombs, Ph.D.
                 NRCGSH@RITVAX.ISC.RIT.EDU
