                             NoT Newsletter #1

                         Edited on September 17, 1991


    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Introduction:

    The Nation of Thieves is a fairly new organization.  We've  started  to
    gain recognition, and plan to be an organization to stay around for the
    fight.

    This  new  group includes many parts of the underground, and it is only
    underground, and nothing but the underground.  We cover various  things
    such as, phreaking, hacking, terrorism, virii, and drugs.

    What  this  newsletter  contains  is  generally  a broad prospective of
    underground  information  and  articles.   We  will  be   releasing   a
    newsletter  every  so  often  with  our  latest  collection of articles
    written for NoT.

    NoT is currently looking for authors.   If  you  are  interested,  call
    Condemned  Reality at 618-397-7702 (PW:SMASHED) and send up a file that
    you have written, the members of NoT will review this file then  decide
    whether  it  would be in NoT's best interest to accept you as a member.
    This is your chance to get in on the newest  magazine  and  underground
    group, and potentially a long standing group.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Before  we get down to business, here's a little note to all you sysops
    out there that NoT would  like  to  give.   It's  a  touch  of  advice.
    There's  a  user  in  the  underground that goes by Horize or Hot Rize.
    Here's a summary of his dweebness:

    A  few  months  back,  Horize  got his line taken away from him because
    Mommy wouldn't foot the fone bill for him. At this time he was a member
    of NoT.  We in NoT decided that this was exactly what we were trying to
    get rid of, so we decided to drop him and his  system  from  Nation  of
    Thieves.   Well,  mommy's boy didn't like that one bit.    We  told
    him  nicely, and didn't call him a dweeb at that point.  So, the fucker
    called up Condemned Reality and uploads this ANSI pic  saying  that  it
    was  a suggestion for a NoT logo.  I looked at it, and turns out it was
    an ANSI bomb.  Thing was, Horize being the dweeb he was, was too stupid
    to make it right.  All the thing did was say echo off when you hit  the
    spacebar.   This  was where we got to calling this little shit a dweeb.
    I left his access on the  system  because  I  like  seeing  the  little
    fucker's  attempts  at  screwing  with it.  Then, he pissed me off.  He
    posted an AutoPost saying that I was a narc and I busted him.   He  was
    just,  of course, saying that to save everyone else.  Yeah, that's real
    good, Todd.  I've been running that system off and on since about 1985.
    And all that time I was just busting the hell out of people,  but  word
    never  got  around.  What a fucking moron.  I sent him mail telling him
    what I thought of him.  Then, he  replies  with  this  arrogant  little
    message:

    RE: That's fucking...

    I just love pulling your fuckin' chain you asshole.

    NoT is dead...Realize it now!!

    No  one  is  going to listen to your plea to delete me on other boards.
    I'm too popular and too well known while your a loser... HAHAHA
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Oh, now wasn't that sooooo cute.  I  like  this  shit,  he's  just  too
    popular,   everybody  loves  him.   Half  the  people  in  the  fucking
    underground have never heard of this dweeb  and  he's  claiming  to  be
    king.  Here's a wanna-be.

    Sysops,  do yourselves a favor if you see this fucking putz, delete his
    account immediately, it'll save you time from doing it later.

    The Responsiveness of Adaptive Routing:

    Adaptive  Routing  is  a  technique that allows a network to respond to
    changing traffic conditions.  If packets are backed up in a  buffer  at
    a given node, the system can send traffic through other nodes until the
    roadblock clears.  Simil- ar rerouting can occur if a transmission path
    is malfunctioning.

    The  type of adaptive routing employs a set of programming instructions
    called a forward-search algorithm.  In this scheme, the  network  keeps
    track  of  the cost (measured in daily time) of various routes from and
    to different nodes.  As packets make their way along the  network,  the
    forward-search  algorithm  is  perio-  dically  used  to  calculate the
    lowest-cost route from a given node to a givenm  packet's  destination.
    Adaptive  routing  of this kind may be overseen by a s supervisory node
    that  collects   delay-time   data   from   throughout   the   network.
    Alternatively,   the   responsibility   for   monitoring   delays   and
    calculating routes may be distributed among the nodes in the network.

    One method of measuring delay time is called time stamping.  Each  node
    monit-  ors the time a packet arrives in the node's incoming buffer and
    the time it departs from the outgoing  buffer,  and  then  reports  the
    amount  of  delay  either  to  a  supervisory node or, in a distributed
    system, to other nodes in the network. In either case, the  information
    is  plugged  into the forward search algorithm. (Although delay time at
    nodes is the only factor,  in  pratice,  the  forward-search  algorithm
    would  also  take into account other factors, such as transmission time
    between nodes.) By compiling and priodically updating delay  data  from
    every  node,  the  network  is  able  to  calculate  at  any moment the
    quickest route between any two points.

    EXAMPLE:    NODE1
                PACKET 1 TIME STAMP
                TIME IN: Millisecond 1000
                TIME OUT:Millisecond 1008
                -------------------------
                Delay                   8

    In this simplified example  of  time  stamping,  time  is  measured  in
    milliseconds (ms.), or thousandths of a second.  A packet enters Node 1
    at 1000ms. and leaves at 1008ms, for a delay at the link of 8 ms.  This
    figure(the info), along with figures from other nodes, will be combined
    in the forward-search algoithm for route planning.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Simplicity of Static Routing:

    An  alternative to adaptive routing is static routing, a technique that
    is more vulnerable  to  malfunctions  and  congestion,  but  reduces  a
    network's  overhead  by  relieving  the  nodes  of  many  computational
    responsibilities.  Two types of static routing are  fixed  routing  and
    flooding.

    With  fixed  routing, the network programmer establishes a directory of
    optimum routes to and from every  point  in  the  network.   Each  node
    simply  reads  a packet' s header to learn its destination, then either
    looks  up  that  destination  in  a  stored   directory   or   receives
    instructions  from  a  supervisory node.  Thus, every message and every
    packet of a message sent from Station A to Station B  will  follow  the
    same  route.   (In  networks  that employ a variation of fixed routing,
    there may  be  two  or  more  routes--with  predetermined  priority--to
    choose from.)

    Flooding  is  useful in cases where one message must go to all stations
    or in an emergency when, for example, part of a military network  might
    be  damaged.  Each  node makes several copies of all message packets it
    receives, and sends one along every transmission path except the path a
    packet came in on.  An obvious drwaback to flooding is that the network
    can become clogged as the number of copies increases.  One  method  for
    dealing  with this problem is to program the designation node to accept
    only one copy of each packet, and  to  destory  duplica-  tes  as  they
    arrive.  (Each original packet and each copy has a unique identifier .)
    Another  solution  is  to tag packets with a so-called hop-count number
    equal to some large value, such as the number of nodes in the  network;
    each  node  reduc  es by one the hop count of every incoming packet and
    destroys any packet whose hop count reaches zero.


                            TO NODE
                  1   2   3   4  5  6  7  8
                 --------------------------
               1|-    2   2   4  5  5  5  5
           F    |
           R   2|1    -   3   1  6  6  6  6
           O    |
           M   3|2    2   -   2  6  6  6  6

           O   5|1    6   6   7  -  6  7  6

                |
               8|6    6   6   7  6  6  7  -


    In this fixed routing directory--stored at Node 2, the supervisory node
    in this example-sending  nodes  are  listed  in  the  leftmost  column,
    receiving  nodes  in  the top row.  (In a distributed scheme, each node
    would store only the  row  that  listed  the  optimum  next  stage  for
    transmission to another node.) If Node 1 receives a packet destined for
    Node  8,  the  supervisory  node consults the direct- ory and instructs
    Node 1 to send the packet to Node 5.  Node 5, in turn, is told to  send
    the packet to Node 6, and so on; the supervisory node checks the direct
    -ory for the route one node at a time.


    In  a  flooding scheme, each node obeys a sequence of instructions that
    might run as follows for  each  packet  it  receives:  1.  Inspect  the
    address  in  the  packet  's  header.  2.  If this node is the packet's
    destination, forward it to the appro- priate station. 3. If this is not
    the destination, deduct one from the hop count . 4.  If  the  resulting
    value  is greater than zero, make copies and send them along all routes
    except the one the packet arrived on. 5. If the new value is 0, destroy
    the packet.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

                                    PREFACE

    I  have  read many text files on the carding and I have found that none
    of them really capture the full essence of the carding chain.  I  found
    that  the  majority  of  textfiles  contain  most  of  the same info in
    different words.  I have put my personal methods and  experimenting  in
    here  along  with  the traditional things.  I hope that this file helps
    you *LEARN* about carding.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    I.  Introduction

     I'll skip all the bullshit and get to the facts...  Credit Card  fraud
    is  simply  using  someone else's credit card to buy shit for yourself.
    Enough said!! There are many ways to use a cc such as ordering by mail,
    getting cash from Western Union, Order and go pick  it  up,  etc.   The
    possibilities  are  endless.   This file concentrates on the mail order
    aspect of carding.

     Before you start you should consider the risks:  Contrary  to  popular
    belief  cc  fraud  is  relatively  safe.   I'm  sure you've never heard
    anywhere in the media that  a  person  was  caught  and  sent  to  jail
    because  there  aren't  many. But for everyone that's caught, there are
    twenty people who get away with it.  They don't  publicize  it  because
    everyone would do it.  Now consider the possibilities that there are...
    Just about anything that you could want you can get illegally.

     And  for  all  you  dudes that are scared of the *FEDS*, realize this:
    Feds have other more important things  to  do  than  waste  their  time
    trying to bust a guy that's carding a watch a house that is targeted as
    a dropsite when there are real criminals out there!

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    II.  Getting Card

    There are a couple of good ways to get cards...

    1.  Trashing

    Trashing  is  simply  going  to  a stores trash bins to get Credit card
    transaction carbons.  I suggest that you hit  the  trash  after  a  big
    holiday  like  Christmas or something like that.  You can get enough in
    one day to last three months.  This can get messy and I prefer  to  use
    other means of attaining card numbers.

    2.  Raiding Mailboxes

    The advantage you have with mail boxing is you get the cc bill with the
    account  number,  billing  address  and  credit  limit but not the exp.
    date.  The expiration date is not necessary, if you don't  believe  me,
    substitute 6/92. Go to a condo complex or the like and walk casually to
    the  doors  and  pretend  to  look  for  a  friends place while opening
    mailboxes.  Look for anything with a return  address  of  a  bank  (ie.
    Citibank, First National, Comerica).

    3.  Inside Link

    If  you have a friend that works at a store which accepts credit cards,
    ask him to write down the info before they are  logged  and  stored  in
    files.  Of  the  three I have found mail boxing is the easiest and most
    rewarding.  I have found blank checks, department store  card  #'s  and
    once  I  found  an  actual  card  which  I put back in to ensure future
    jackpots.

    4.  Card Identification

    The first number of the account number determines the card type.

    Here are the templates for the credit cards:


                                 VISA:

                      CC#      4xxx xxx xxx xxx     -  Usually gold card
                Exp. Date      mm/dd/yy - mm/yy

                      CC#      4xxx xxxx xxxx xxxx
                Exp. Date      mm/yy - mm/yy


                              Master Card:

                      CC#       5xxx xxxx xxxx xxxx
                Exp. Date       xxxx mm/yy - mm/yy


                            American Express:

                      CC#       3xxxx xxxxxx xxxxx
                Exp. Date       mm/yy - mm/yy


                                 Discover:

                      CC#       6xxx xxxx xxxx xxxx
                Exp. Date       mm/yy - mm/yy


    Otay one more thing, if there is a group of numbers that is 000 or 0000
    this means that the card owner is a  'Prefered  Customer'.   I  haven't
    really researched it much though and do not know all the privilages.


    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    III.  Setting Up A Drop Site

     It  is  essential  that  you  have a GOOD drop site.  This is the most
    crucial point of the carding so choose wisely.  This is the only  place
    you can be physically caught. There are many good dropsites.

     Find  a  home  where  the people are out for the week or work all day.
    Make sure they will be out when they  "receive"  what  "they"  ordered.
    Make  sure you find out the persons name so that the address matches up
    with the phone number.

     The best place in my opinion is an apartment complex.  Go to the  door
    and  say  your  a  new  tenant  in  1D and Dad sent a package to 10D by
    accident. Ask if they could sign for it and  you'll  come  pick  it  up
    later.  This also works very well in old folks homes.

     Another  drop site I am experimenting with now is as follows.  Go to a
    street that has a vacant home or two on it.  Look around and  find  out
    if  some old dorks live on the block.  When you have found a block come
    back the following Monday.  Go up to the old ass's door and  tell  them
    that  you  are  moving a week from Friday and you just wanted to get to
    know the neighbors. Be REALLY nice and tell them how you're moving from
    Germany where you're dad was stationed.  Finally slip in the deal  with
    the  package  and  it would be Swell if they would take the package for
    you.  This never fails, also give them a  current  address  (Resident's
    inn  or  the  whatever) and a bullshit phone number.  Tell them to call
    you when you it comes in.  You already know exactly when it  will  come
    in and wait until it comes and get it 20 minutes later.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    IV.  Ordering

     When  ordering  the  merchandise, it is important to keep cool.  There
    are two kinds of credit  checks.   First  they  will  verify  the  card
    credit  line  on  the  CBI.  The CBI doesn't have the Exp. date because
    there are simply too many cards in the U.S.  The second way they  check
    is  either call you at home (if it's something like a 486 base system).
    But this costs a lot of money and they will more likely call the area's
    information (xxx-555-1212) and make sure  that  the  name  matches  the
    address.

     I  have found that if you want computer shit, you should buy a copy of
    Byte or the like  and  look  in  the  classified  for  small  companies
    without an 800 order number.  These companies won't spend as much money
    as larger companies.

     When  you  call  up, ask all sorts of questions about the product like
    about  the   warranty,   reliability,   compatibility,   years   before
    obsolescence,  etc.   Like  you were making a big investment.  Act like
    you would if you were actually spending your own hard earned money. Ask
    about all the products' differences and finally say something  like  "I
    sold  on  that  one..."  or some bullshit line like that.  Make friends
    with him/her and talk to him with his first name.   When  you  'decide'
    what you want, order in one sentence.

     She'll  ask  you what the billing address is, mailing address, daytime
    phone number, who you want to  ship  it  to,  card  type,  name  as  it
    appears  on  the  card,  account  number,  exp.  date.   This  is in no
    particular order.

                    Dialogue: Act mature!

     Salesperson: Hello, J&R MusicWorld, Jane speaking.
     You: Hello Jane, I would like some information on the Casio
     B.O.S.S. calculator, do you sell that?

     Salesperson: Yes we have several models in stock, which one are
     you interested in?
     You: I'm not sure, one of my co-workers has one and I was really
     impressed with it.  He referred me to this company for the lowest
     prices, payment plans, more bullshit...

     Salesperson: Models we have ETC.....
     You: Bullshit now in prices, value, etc.

     Salesperson: What model are you interested in?
     You: The 666 model...

     Salesperson: How will you be paying for this purchase?
     You: Mastercard, is there any surcharge?

     Salesperson: Not for MC (never for visa or MC), what's your last
     name?
     You: MY name is (card name) address is... cc# is 4000 0000,

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    V.  Delivery

     There seems to be some misconceptions about Federal  Express  and  UPS
    delivery.  I will clear up the facts regarding these companies.

     Federal  Express  offers overnight and economy delivery service.  Both
    services require signatures accepting the delivery.  The  delivery  men
    will  leave  packages  on the porch if there is a note with a signature
    on it to accept it.

     United Parcel Service on the other hand requires a signature only  for
    overnight  delivery,  not  for  2nd  day  delivery.   This is always my
    choice and if possible, I will avoid Fed  Ex  only  companies  such  as
    Hard  Disks  International  (  I  tried  to get a 100 megger from those
    bastards).  For overnight just leave note saying that you have to  work
    today.  Another thing that you have to consider is: if the delivery man
    thinks  that  it  is  unsafe to leave the package, he won't because UPS
    would be responsible. Again, just leave a note.

     The overnight deliveries are guaranteed there by 10:00.   The  Economy
    Service  can  be  delivered  any  time  in  the business day (9-5).  On
    saturdays UPS now delivers for more money.  This will ensure  that  the
    regular  delivery  boy  will not deliver and a sub will do the route in
    his place.  If you have an empty house you can remove the for sale sign
    and get it delivered there.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    VI.  Pick-up

     Dress normally, the chances are greater that someone will  notice  you
    and  remember your looks if you are wearing a sombrero and sun glasses.
    It wouldn't be a bad idea to wear something that identifies  you  as  a
    member of a group like Boy Scouts or some shit like that.

     Go  to  the  house  early,  about  and  hour  in  advance.   Watch the
    deliveryman drop off the package.  Go to  the  door  about  20  minutes
    later.  Carry a big box with a smaller one in it.  Walk up to the house
    normally.   Pretend  to  knock  on  the  door,  take the small box your
    carrying out of the big box and exchange it with the carded items. This
    will deter any nosy bitch neighbors.

     Try not to touch anything unnecessary like the doorknob.  Don't  order
    it  to  a  place that is not highly visible... The most important thing
    though is if you see ANYTHING that's vary  suspicious  or  out  of  the
    ordinary,  Do  NOT pick it up, wait and if the situation doesn't change
    leave immediately.

     When I started carding I knew a guy that carried mace or  an  electric
    stun gun with him (No really, I'm not BSin).  This seems a bit extreme,
    but  if  an  asshole  wants  to take you to the police station, what is
    better?

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    VII.  Aftermath

     Lay Low for a while, if you were careful, the chances  are  that  they
    will  not come to you.  Stash the merchandise at a friends home or in a
    locker somewhere for at least a week.  Let the area cool off, the  card
    owner will not find out until the end of the month when he/she gets the
    bill.   At  first  they  will  probably  think it's a glitch and try to
    straighten things out with the company while you are enjoying your  new
    HST.

     It  is  always  better  when  you  sell what you card and buy the shit
    legally.  And computer shit is 10 times harder to  card  so  card  shit
    like two tennis racquets, or a Wizzard, or CD's or blank tapes.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    VIII.  Live with parents?

     If  your  parents  know  anything  about your system then this poses a
    problem.  You  can  over  come  this  by  telling  them  that  a  local
    underground  BBS that John is on went down and he is selling his HST or
    whatever for 100 bux and that you have the money  saved  up.   You  are
    going  to buy it and you want to let them know.  This usually works for
    me.  Or tell them that a friend is going to Mexico for  the  summer  to
    visit  relatives  and  since he won't need it he is letting you have it
    for a while.  Or tell them that a SysOp of a PD board is the owner of a
    computer store and he is having a toilet  bowl  (bullshit)  sale  which
    means prices over 60% off!  He'll give you another 20% off!

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    IX.  What to Card?

     The  hardest  thing to card is computer equipment, as a rule, just get
    something else.  Your chances are doubled when you card  say..  a  tape
    deck.   I  recommend  you  card  something  that  someone  else  needs.
    example... A friend needs a new racquet but doesn't  have  much  money,
    Card  a  couple  $200 dollar racquets that your "cousin" wants to sell.
    That way the carded shit won't collect dust, You make a quick $150  for
    two days.

          Things I recommend carding because of their resale value...
               1.  Blank Disk ( lots of 50, get 300)
               2.  Compact Disks ( Top 40 and Classic Rock sell VERY Well)
               3.  Porno Tapes ( Kids love them)
               4.  Sports Clothing ( Pistons Starter Jackets, etc.)
               5.  Stereo Equipment ( Tape Decks, Discmans, Walk mans)
               6.  Sports Equipment ( Tennis Racquets, Shoes)
               7.  Office Supplies ( Telephones, Fax Machines)

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    X.  Fucked Up?

     If  you  get  caught  (God  forbid),  just say that you found the card
    number in a parking lot at so & so and hate those people.  You  had  no
    intention  of  keeping  the  stuff  and  it was just a cruel, malicious
    "joke".  This scenario shouldn't occur if your careful, but if it does,
    you didn't think that it would work and they would just be hassled.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    XI.  Miscellaneous Notes

     Computer equipment is  the  hardest  thing  to  card.   I  don't  card
    computer  equipment  and  have  only done it twice successfully because
    all the computer geeks that get a hold of a text file will try and  get
    a 200 megger and a HST. The majority of carders have nothing to do with
    computers.   I got started well before I got my modem and H.P access on
    a BBS.

     Take that into consideration. Never keep card numbers on  disk.   That
    way  If you get caught, they can't confiscate your computer.  Hide them
    in the garage or basement.  And if they are on paper, you can say  that
    you found the paper and knew that it was 'bad' so you hid it.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    I  hope  this  file  gives  you  new  insight and sharpens your carding
    skills.  If you have any suggestions,  E-Mail  me  on  Lifetime  Detour
    313/644/5505.

    Thanx go out to Tgr for getting me to write this fuckin file.

    Well, this brings together the first issue of the NoT Newsletter. Right
    now,  we have put no timing on the releases of this newsletter, but you
    can count on seeing more.   I will say once again that we  are  looking
    for  authors,  and  we invite you to check out our systems.  If you are
    interested in becoming a NoT member  call  Condemned  Reality  (in  the
    systems  listing)  and  send  mail  to Suicidal Maniac #1 telling about
    yourself and your general computing and underground experience.   Then,
    upload a file and put on the description "NoT Application".  We'll look
    over your file and get back to you on your acceptance.
