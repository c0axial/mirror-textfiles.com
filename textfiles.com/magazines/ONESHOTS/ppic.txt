History:
--------
The iNNER CiRCLE merged with Phose and Phree on March 1st, 1994. 
To form PPiC.  A diverse group devoted to hacking, phreaking,
anarchy, and other weird shit like storytelling and getting fucked.
   -Scourge and No Name, leaders of PPiC...



                        The True Game
                        -------------
                          -Scourge

        Who am I?  The question has happened many a time, over and over.
Am I the super-intelligent person some people make me out to be?  Am I the
brutal asshole others have labeled me?  Am I the vicious hacker, the
evil mischief-maker, the lover?

        I am fate.  I defy the bonds of the oppressing law, of the
corruption which eats at this world.  I destroy the corrupt, I live with it,
and it with me.  I am the lover, the fighter, the brain, and the devil.

        What is my destiny?  What am I meant to do?  Do I follow my current
path?  Does my destiny in destroying the security of this corrupt world
make me evil as well?

        I am not of this world.  I defy the corruption.  This is the True
Game.  The game of hiding, the game of seeking, the game of sex, the game of
war.  It is a battle I cannot win, but I will not lose.  Breaking
the standards others have set is not immoral, stopping the rise of the
evil of conformity is not immoral.  Fight the battle, and you may
not win, but we can still win the war.

Become the hacker.  Become the fighter.  Become the lover, the genius, the
thief and anarchist.  Join the movement.  We have the so-called power, if
we united, what law could stop us, what name could strike fear into our
hearts?


                        DESTROY CORRUPTION
                       ------------------
                     Stopping the Corruption:

There are several ways you can "liberate" freedom in your school.  
Sick of listening to conforming bitches like Mrs. Biatch, your 11th
Grade English teacher?  Well, you can give yourself a little relief (Grin)

        First, take the following:  
                Newspaper
                Scissors
                Glue
                Gloves
                Envelope
                Stamp.
Write a good nasty letter (bomb threat) to your school. 
Chances are 50/50 they will ignore it the 1st time.  Write a few more, get a
friend that's out of school to make a few calls from DIFFERENT pay phones.
(This is important.  If I hadn't said that, some poor kid would say,
"But mommy, Scourge didn't say I had to do it from different pay phones!"
If that doesn't close school, do this.  Take a little (PURE) ammonia, and
some iodine crystals.  Mix them till the iodine dissolves.  Dip some
toilet paper into the mixture, stuff it in the keyhole of the school
or something, while IT IS STILL WET!  Once it dries, anyone who touches,
hits, breathes on, or looks at the TP will probably be injured by the
explosion.  THEN, they will take you seriously.  Be VERY careful from now on.
If you get busted, you will most likely be on NATIONAL TELEVISION!  
(Still having trouble getting them to listen?  Wait for PPiC Online 2,
soon coming to you!  (Or wherever the hell you found this)).

                                                 -Scourge


                            No Names Shit
                            -------------
                               -No Name

Here's the shit.
We're new at this.  The shit's probably all fukd.  Typos and other shit will
be all over it. Sorry this'll be so short, but we wanted to get our name out.
As Scourge says, We are hackers/piraters/anarchists.  We plan on doing a lot
for the hacker community. But we need some help first. Call our board (29A)
give us some numbers of good boards to get on. In 616 there are only a couple
of kewl boards around so we need some more. -End of my shit.

About me: Past adventures.. Well, I remember when I became the "TiTANiC" and
sent a zip file that had a ansi bomb inclosed to many of the local bbs's.
which when unzipped redefined the return key to type format c: (enter) Y (enter)
Hacked around a security program that did loggins for a network. (Stole the
supervisor password with a log file.)
Fukn COSMOS, get the WireFrame, blah blah blah.  Phun wit skool, phun wit
napalm, phun wit RDX.  I'll put a log of my exploits in the next issue or
something.

Remove cover from area marked in the above illustration. (use pry bar.)
You will find four (4) wires. Red, green, yellow, and black. The Red and
Green wires are for phone use. The yellow and black are used to tell when
coins are inserted, and when to give them back. If none are exposed, Use
wire strippers and strip the red and the green wires. Attach the red and
green sides of the beige box to the appropriate sides. And there you go.
You have just bypassed the phones coin collect.

(If wall mounted or in a different shell, reach under it and feel around,
If not found, pull phone off of the wall and get the wires.)

     1......At Ease v1.0

               There are many ways to get by "At Ease v1.0"


                    1) Overite the "At Ease Preferences" file using
                         a Word Processor of your choice.

                    2) Delete the "At Ease Preferences" file using
                         any application with a delete function.

                    3) Start up with a boot disk. Then drag "At Ease"
                         into the trash. Drag the "Finder" from the
                         boot disk into the hard drives "System" folder.
                         Eject the boot disk and reboot.

                    4) Use "HyperCard" to make a script to delete the
                         file "At Ease Preferences". (Knowledge of
                         HyperCard  Programming is helpful)...req...

     2......Folder Bolt v1.0

                    1) Rebuild the desktop. (by holding Shft-Cmnd-Opt-Ctrl
                    during boot) Then do a finder file search. Search for
                    "Kind" contains "Folder". Keep hitting Cmnd-G until
                    you are in the System Folder. There you go!

                    2) Select the folder you want into. Then hit Cmnd-O
                    until the folder opens.

                    3) This is not yet confirmed...
                    Edit the FB???????? file using Norton or some
                    other hex-editor. This should show you the password.

                    4) Buy folder bolt. (or get the administrators disk)
                    Run the program "FolderBolt Administrator". Then select
                    uninstall. This should get rid of FolderBolt all to-
                    gether.

     3......After Dark Password protection

                    1) First start up with a boot disk. Then drag the "After
                    Dark Preferences" file into the trash. Empty the trash.
                    Reboot and the problem should be fixed.

     4.....Menu Hacking

                    1) Using ResEdit v2.x.x or above you can edit the menus
                    of the "Finder". Open ResEdit. Then open the finder and
                    edit the "MENU" resource. You should be able to rename
                    the menus and menu items. Have fun here. Try changing
                    names to your favorite cut-down sentence. (warning...any
                    changes to the finder a permanent so make a backup copy
                    first! ..other wise your computer maybe shot for life!)
