This is something that appeared on the Necropolis but I thought
I'd slip it into an HOB. It is pretty much self-explanatory:

Date: 1:25 am  Mon Mar 28, 1994        Number : 131 of 131
From: Sorc                             Sub    : ... jane says
To  : All                              Refer #: None
Subj: my own poetic contribution       BOngHiT: None
Stat: Normal                           Origin : Local


Seeing the recent tide towards poetry and since I've been feeling oh-so-full 
of boundless creativity, I decided to put pen to paper and produce something 
that I plan on submitting to _Oakleaves_, the annual GlenOak creative writing 
fest. Of course it has to do with my suspension and subsequent removal from 
the debate team. Here it is:

oxymoron - a word that i'm allowed to use
in the glenoak world of don'ts and do's
this oakleaves concept i peruse
is another proposition where i can lose

oakleaves, i accept your invite
but what am i allowed to think?
what am i allowed to write?
there can never be creative contemplation
when my own personal expression
can jeopardize my graduation.

aesthetic portrayal of my contention
is undermined by threats of suspension.
instead of thinking about how i should write,
i have to decide if my text is all right.

what provokes the system i buck?
how did i violate the code of conduct?
what scholastic responsibility did i duck?
i think its because i used the word fuck.


Of course, in the version I'm submitting, I've omitted the word fuck but 
hopefully the rhyme-scheme will illustrate that point.
