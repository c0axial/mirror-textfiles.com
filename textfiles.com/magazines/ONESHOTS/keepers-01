                  EDITORIAL POLICY

"Keepers" is an experiment in netnews message-filtering, a prototype 
that I hope will be widely copied and improved.

It reflects *only* the tastes of the editor.  There is no other common
thread.  The three sections are: short pieces, long pieces, and offensive 
pieces.  The offensive pieces, in the great netnews tradition, are
*extremely* offensive.

Even if most of the contents are familiar or boring, I hope the few
remaining interesting and new ones will make it worth the trouble of
subscribing.  (Though I make no guarantees that there will ever be a
#2!)

Grateful acknowledgments go to James A. Squires, whose JASBITS is the
model I'm building on. You can request a sample from:
jsquires@cerf.net-- use the subjectline: JASBITS FETCH.

Constructive feedback is very welcome: jorn@mcs.com (Jorn Barger)

This issue contains mostly messages posted between Wednesday and
Friday of last week.  Except for the custom graphics, it could have
been posted Friday.  (When trivially simple ascii cut-and-paste tools
become available, same-day custom graphics will be a cinch!)  I tried
to create a graphic for each piece, from my clip-art archives (some
are more successful than others).  And I tried to keep them to 21 lines 
so they'd display on a single screen using the normal 'more' pager.

All the art except the USA map is by others.  All the fonts except the
title page were done with a Unix/DOS utility called Figlet.  See
alt.ascii-art for details.

Subject: Verify your backups

The message below, from managers of wuarchive.wustl.edu, is one with
which readers of RISKS should be familiar.  How many of us are in the
same position?

For those of you who don't know, wuarchive.wustl.edu is one of the
largest and busiest Internet public archive sites, accessible via
anonymous FTP and other means.

----- From /README.NOW in wuarchive.wustl.edu -----
The entire archives were destroyed the afternoon of Thursday, January 13th
due to a bug in the system crash dump routines.  There have been serious
problems restoring backups due to a failed tape drive -- we have gotten a
loaner drive, but there may not be any recent viable backups of the archives.

Translation: everything was lost, the archive maintainers are scrambling
to find copies of all of the missing files -- it's probable that some
files were lost permanently.

Thanks for your patience,

The Management

Subject: Risks of Domain Names

At the end of December, after NBC Nightly News announced an address for
Internet email - "nightly@nbc.com" - I wondered if the other US television
networks had also established an Internet presence.  A quick check of the
Domain Name Service revealed the existence of "abc.com", "cbs.com", and
"fox.com".

A search in the InterNIC registration database showed that none of these
represented the organizations I would normally associate with those names.
Instead of TV networks, I found a design firm, a consultant, and an online
service.

The obvious risk is that of mistaken identity.

Less clear is the impact that such "misleading" email addresses may have on
the way people do business.  Increasing numbers of people do much of their
professional interaction via email.  Email addresses are appearing on business
cards and becoming as accepted as postal addresses.  The domain name portion
of an email address is coming to represent an organization.

Domain names are given out on a first-come-first-served basis.  This raises
several questions.  Will large companies consider "misleading" domain names to
violate their trademarks?  Will "misleading" domain names matching those or
large companies be registered with the intent of receiving compensation
for them when the companies eventually come on the Internet?

Not all the networks have been lagging behind, by the way - the Public
Broadcasting Service ("pbs.org") has been on the Internet for over a year.

Subject: Harvard Case of Stolen Fax Messages

This is dated but worthwhile for readers of RISKS.  The Boston Globe of
December 15 published an column by Alex Beam about an academic battle over the
Harvard Semitic Museum.  The Museum has an outstanding collection but was
recently closed down, leading to very public battles involving many
celebrities. What caught my eye in Beam's description of the controversy is
the following quote:

"Stager (the museum's director) instructed his secretary to remove used fax
cartridges from the trash, unravel the carbonized ribbon and reconstruct the
staff's facsimile transmissions, to monitor surreptitious fund-raising. (This
little trick won't work on modern laser-printed fax machines, in case you're
getting any ideas.)"

"Stager 'talked to the (Harvard) general counsel's office, and asked them if
it was against the law," his assistant, Eileen Caves, told the Harvard
Crimson.  They 'classified the carbon as ''abandoned material that was left in
a public place'' and said it was therefore public information."

Risks?  It may have happened at Harvard, it may be possible to reconstruct
messages, and it may be why lawyers should be buried 35 feet underground
since, deep down, they are very nice people.

Remember my post about the fifties "men's" magazine ad for
"100 TWO-DIMENSIONAL TOYS"?  I've found even more awesome toys for
your young ones.

Seems Hartz has decided that its cat toys don't look special enough
compared to the competition.  Next time you're at the supermarket,
hotfoot it over to the pet supplies aisle and look for Hartz's
INTERACTIVE cat toys.  These include interactive Bizzy Balls and the
famous interactive sack of catnip on a string.

Yes, INTERACTIVE cat toys.  Unlike boring ol' cat toys where your cat is
only allowed to LOOK at them on a rigidly-ahdered-to schedule--
INTERACTIVE cat toys permit the cat to PLAY with them!!!

Coming soon: interactive cats!

Menus - yes
Scrollbars - no
Full mouse support - no
Cut/Copy/Paste - yes

It is not for every Mac user.  However, If you miss GNU Emacs and all the
super lisp libraries that you have on your workstation, this is the editor
for you.  I haven't tested many of the lisp libraries that I've
accumulated, but C indenting works, as does dired mode, ispell, and
calendar.

I am very impressed by the work that Mac has done and dearly hope that he
will be able to improve Mac Emacs with v19 features.

Subject: Stylewriter vs Deskwriter

I have meant to write this note for a while...and if it helps one person
make a better printer decision than it will serve its purpose.

Note: All the opinions expressed herewith are mine! All mine!

I decided to buy a Stylewriter II over a Deskwriter for a bevy of reasons
most important of which was the fact that the drivers would always be up to
date.

I have since then regretted that decision daily. I look enviously at my
collegues with Deskwriters for the following reasons that have superceded
any concerns about driver software.

a) Water based ink. Document handling instructions:
No sneezing allowed. Do not eat an apple (whoa!) anywhere in the vicinity.
No drinking. Do not drop on the floor. Do not take outdoors. Do not water
your plants. Wear rubber gloves.
I LOVE the environment but this ink is insane. What are people out there
doing? Photocopying everything they print so that they will have
respectable documents?

b) The feed mechanism often eats, mangles and spits back paper.

c) I often want to print a single page on letterhead or envelopes. Not only
is the procedure inconvenient but exponentially raises the rate of mangling
in (b) above.

If I had to do it all over again I would buy a Deskwriter without a
picosecond's hesitation....

I hope this helps someone out there...

I cannot prove that I originated it.  I can confirm, however, that I
raised it to an art, and made it very popular.  In effect, I am a
popular artist.

For budding misc.test wannabe's, I would recommend posting to
rec.music.country.western saying that "YOU ARE ALL HICKS", then set
the followup to rec.music.country.western, misc.jobs.offered,
misc.test, and rec.humor.  The hicks will be too stupid to notice the
follow change and post; the misc.job.offerees will be so
narrow-mindedly anal in reminding people that the newsgroup is only
for job listings and post; and the rec.humorees will throw in a heap
of newbie college freshmen into the mix.

Garnish with beak.

A class by myself!

Not only am I the class clown, I'm also THE TEACHER!  Whoops, I used
ALL-CAPS!  Now I'll have to give myelf corporal punishment!  *WHACK!*

I was thinking today that there are certain basic life skills they should
teach in elementary school which are sadly lacking in our culture.
Each of these would take only five seconds or so of curriculum but would
make our world better in a major way.  I.e., "Don't swallow the
microphone if you grow up to be a subway announcer."  "Look at the
orange unit prices in the market."  "Red cars don't get you dates."
"Electric stoves suck."  "They'll tell you the wrong three primary
colors in fifth grade."  "Neckties are not required."  "Lawns are more
work than they're worth--PAVE!"  "Preheating the oven is not necessary."
"Kool-Aid is all the same flavor."  "Hold chopsticks near the far end."
"People can be easily manipulated by a simple sentence."

Jack Schmidling is not just a Usenet kook and a suburban-Chicago lawn kook,
he is an internationally famous amateur radio kook also.  Anyone remember
Jacks old .sig trumpeting his "ARF" (Amateur Radio Forum) on 14.313 MHz?
Jack managed to use roughly 40 lines of text in that baby.

Anyway, Schmidling & Co. staked-out 14.313 as their personal turf and
set up a swearing/yelling/threatening encounter group that, due to the
magic of ionospheric propogation, interfered with the normal activities
of amateur radio operators worldwide.  The last I heard, the FCC had
cracked-down on the 14.313 mob, issuing $10,000 fines and such, and the
frequency seems to be rather quiet now.  Anyone know if Jack got caught
up in the drag net?  Is that why he is now the master.loon of rec.arts.
brewing rather than rec.radio.amateur.misc?

        Well, folks, my main account gets this group just in time for that
machine to go down for maint for the night.  Sigh.
        Anyway, after a little thought, I have figured out that Alexander Abian
is a scientific Nietzsche, in a way.  And I don't simply mean this as an insult
to Nietzsche.
        Seriously, Abian's approach to science is remarkably similar to
Nietzsche's approach to morality, even if Abian doesn't come out and say it
himself (apologies if this comparison has already been done, by the way).  To
Nietzsche, there were two basic ways to look at morality: Master Morality and
Slave Morality.  Master Morality (in case anyone on a.u.k. doesn't know
already) is the morality of the noble, the strong...those with the greatest
Will to Power.  Such masters set their own standards of right and wrong, and
they were Allowed, because they had that special virtue needed to be able to
decide what was right and wrong: will to power, nobility in Fred's eyes.  Slave
Morality, on the other hand, is the morality of the masses, of the downtrodden,
it demands that all be treated nicely and with charity and so forth.  Needless
to say, a Master finds Slave Morality despicable and anti-life.
        Just as Nietzsche's Master Morality applies to his ethics, so it also
applies in a way to Abian's scientific method.  Instead of Will to Power as the
primary virtue, Abian establishes imagination and elegance.  "IMAGINATION IS
EVERYTHING, THE REST IS DETAIL" is one of his favorite quotes.  If you have the
proper imagination and vision, it is your perogative to determine what
scientific truth is, in this Master Science viewpoint.  On the other hand, most
current science is a sort of Slave Science...it demands proof that can be
accessed by all, it demands that anyone can reproduce a result.  In short, the
ideal is that anyone can do science.  Bottom-up scientific method...you need
not have the virtue of imagination to perform modern science (but it does
help).  People who go around proposing things right out of their heads without
following the "Slave Science" rules are called kooks, and alternately feared
and loathed.  To quote Nietzsche, from "Beyond Good and Evil," "According to
slave-morality, therefore, the 'evil' man arouses fear; according to the
master-morality, it is precisely the 'good' man who arouses fear and seeks to
arouse it, while the bad man is regarded as the despicable being."  Nietzsche
uses despicable to mean anti-life, against the Will to Power.  You may see in
this quote the anthem of all kooks everywhere, distilled into "You disagree
because you fear I'm right."
        The Master is not to be criticized by the Slave in Nietzsche's system.
For it is truly only the Master who has the right to make ethical decisions,
the slave morality is at best a cruel sham, at worst a deliberate insult to
life itself.  Similarly, the visionary "Master Scientist" will never allow his
theories to be submitted to the rigors of mainstream science, for such science
lacks the primary virtue of imagination.  For how can such little men judge a
giant?  Those with the Master point of view see themselves as giants among
Lilliputians...tiny men with tiny minds.  They think of things like proof and
reproducibility as crutches for charlatans who are intent on keeping their
place in the center stage and crowding out the true geniuses.  They feel
vindicated by cases where the Master visionary *was* right despite conventional
science...it has happened numerous times throughout history, after all.
        However, their fatal mistake is to assume that all one needs to do to
become one of the Masters is to seize the high ground.  Any assaults on their
position after that are simply seen as vindication of their rightness...why
would anyone attack them if not out of fear that the self-styled Master was
right?  Even Nietzsche doesn't propose master-morality be followed by all: it
is to be followed by masters, and always should be.  You don't become a master
by believing in master-morality...you attain the ability to exercise
master-morality upon becoming a master.  Likewise, you do not become a
visionary by assuming the kind of proof-denying stance Abian has, you must
first be a true visionary.  Then you can get away with bypassing proof.  }->
        Many net.kooks follow this Master pattern, but Abian is definitely one
of the clearest examples in his flat out refusal to accept the validity of
conventional science.  Most other net.loons don't assault the entire framework
of science, they simply say the results were suppressed, or are slightly
outside the bounds of conventional science, or whatever.  Abian denies science
entirely, and logic as well.  He feels himself some kind of Uberphysik,
divinely able to discerne the truth by fiat and imagination.  Perhaps he is
right.  But I doubt it....

bulletin board.  However, certain parts of it can be accurately described as

arguments on, well, most groups right now, and on the stall walls here....

                                  *

OTTAWA (Southam News Wire) -- The government has paid almost $7 million
in compensation to the unwitting guinea pigs of federally funded
brainwashing experiments in Montreal in the 1960s.

That figure may increase as justice department officials sort through
about another 50 applications from people who say they were patients of
the late Dr. Ewen Cameron at McGill University's Allain Memorial
Institute.

Jan. 1 was the deadline for applications for the $100,000 payments
announced in 1992 by then-justice minister Kim Campbell.

Although there are believed to be only 80 patients who received
Cameron's full "depatterning treatment" -- weeks of drug-induced sleep
followed by massive electroshock treatments, reducing the patient's mind
to a childhood state -- 329 applications for compensation were received,
justice department lawyer Lou David said.

So far, 69 people have received the lump-sum payments, while 214 were
rejected, Davis said.  Another 46 are still being reviewed by a
four-member justice committee and Ontario Blue Cross which first screens
applications.

                                   *

The article doesn't scratch the surface of this story -- though I'm glad
they at least ran the settlement notice.

What is missing? The _why_.  Why did Cameron do these horrid experiments
on unsuspecting patients?

A: As part of CIA research into "brainwashing".

In the 1950s and 1960s, the CIA was powerfully interested in psychiatric
reports suggesting that LSD could break down behavior patterns, for this
raised the possibility of "reprogramming", or, colloquially,
brainwashing.

Let me quote you a few paragraphs from Martin Lee and Bruce Shlain's
1985 book, _Acid Dreams: The CIA, LSD and the Sixties Rebellion_ that
deal directly with Cameron and the Montreal experiments:

     If LSD temporarily altered a person's view of the world and
     suspended his belief system, CIA doctors surmised, then perhaps
     Russian spies could be cajoled into switching loyalties while they
     were tripping.  The brainwashing strategy was relatively simple:
     find the subject's weakest point (his "squeaky board") and bear
     down on it.  Use any combination or synthesis which might "open the
     mind to the power of suggestion to a degree never hitherto dreamed
     possible".  LSD would be employed to provoke a reality shift, to
     break someone down and tame him, to find a locus of anonymity and
     leave a mark there forever.

     To explore the feasibility of this approach, the Agency turned to
     Dr Ewen Cameron, a respected psychiatrist who served as president
     of the Canadian, the American, and the World Psychiatric
     Association before his death in 1967.  Cameron also directed the
     Allain Memorial Institute at Montreal's McGill University, where he
     developed a bizarre and unorthodox method for treating
     schizophrenia.  With financial backing from the CIA he tested his
     method on 53 patients at Allain.

     The so-called treatment started with "sleep therapy", in which
     subjects were knocked out for months at a time.  The next phase,
     "depatterning", entailed massive electroshock and frequent doses of
     LSD designed to wipe out past behavior patterns.  Then Cameron
     tried to recondition the mind through a technique known as "psychic
     driving".  The patients, once again heavily sedated, were confined
     to "sleep rooms" where tape-recorded messages played over and over
     from speakers under their pillows.  Some heard the message a
     quarter of a million times.

     Cameron's methods were later discredited, and the CIA grudgingly
     gave up on the notion of LSD as a brainwashing technique.  But that
     was little consolation to those who served as guinea pigs for the
     CIA's secret mind control projects.  Nine of Cameron's former
     patients have sued the American government for $1,000,000 each,
     claiming that they are still suffering from the trauma they went
     through at Allain.  These people never agreed to participate in a
     scientific experiment -- a fact which reflects little credit on the
     CIA, even if the Agency officials feared that the Soviets were
     spurting ahead in the mind control race.  The CIA violated the
     Nuremberg Code for medical ethics by sponsoring experiments on
     unwitting subjects.

     Ironically, Dr Cameron was a member of the Nuremberg tribunal that
     heard the case against Nazi war criminals who committed atrocities
     during World War II.

                                    *

Faith in psychiatry.

I will follow-up this post with the ascii-transcribed chapter this
snippet was taken from.)

Today's "Conspiracy for the Day" (CfD) was written especially for 
the readers of CfD by Carol Wallace. The subject today deals with 
the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby back in the 1930s. Carol 
Wallace is an expert on the subject, having written her master's 
thesis on the Lindbergh kidnapping as well as being widely read 
in the history of that era. Wallace wrote her doctoral 
dissertation on the Fatty Arbuckle scandal of 1921. She teaches 
Mass Media Law, with a special interest in notorious trials and 
publicity. Regarding the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby, she 
says, "I love this topic, and am glad to discuss it anywhere."

"...comparisons between Lindbergh and Hauptmann --that the two men 
were very similar in an unbelievable number of ways, physically, 
through life and family history, etc.  ...it was as though 
Hauptmann was the dark side of Lindbergh.  But, if the latest 
theories have any validity at all, it seems as though Lindbergh 
was the real dark side."

On March 1, 1932, Ollie Whateley, butler at the Charles Lindbergh 
home in Hopewell, New Jersey,  called the local police to report 
that the Lindbergh's infant son had been  stolen. Within hours, 
local and state police, plus press and ordinary sensation seekers 
were all over the grounds.  While local  police saw a crude 
ladder, built in sections, lying near the window from which it 
appeared the baby had been taken, and two grooves where the 
ladder had rested, most other footprints and possible clues were 
obliterated in the rush to investigate the rain-soaked grounds.
 
Lindbergh, hailed as the great American hero after his historic 
New York to Paris flight in 1927, took charge of the 
investigation himself.  He refused to allow other members of the 
household to be questioned.  According to him, the child was 
discovered missing when his nursemaid, Betty Gow, went  in to 
check on him and found the crib empty.  She reported this first 
to Anne Morrow Lindbergh, the child's mother, then they went to 
Colonel Lindbergh's room.
 
"Do you have the baby?" asked Anne. Lindbergh denied having the 
child, and accompanied his wife to the nursery.
 
The crib was empty.  Lindbergh turned to his wife.  "Anne," he 
said. "They have stolen our baby."
 
Instructing his wife and Betty Gow to remain where they were, 
Lindbergh shouted to the butler to phone the police, grabbed a 
rifle, and raced outdoors.  When the butler came to report, he 
found Lindbergh sitting in his car.  Lindbergh asked the butler 
to drive into town and buy a flashlight, so that he could 
investigate.  But before Whateley could do so, the police arrived.
 
Lindbergh led them straight to the window under the child's room, 
pointed out the discarded ladder, and led them to the prints 
which the ladder had left, and a footprint. According to police 
reports, he was very calm and collected.
 
He then led the police upstairs to the nursery, where he pointed 
to an envelope resting against the window.  He told police that 
he had ordered that it not be touched until a fingerprint expert 
could be summoned.
 
The envelope was opened in the presence of the police.  
Anonymous, it bore an elaborate coded symbol as a signature, and 
claimed that the writer and associates were holding the child for 
ransom and would communicate the particulars later. The letter 
appeared to have been written by someone foreign, probably 
Germanic.
 
The fingerprint expert found no prints on the envelope or letter.  
Nor did he find any on the window, or the child's crib.  He 
didn't even find Lindbergh's prints, or those of the nursemaid or 
Anne Lindbergh, who had searched the room before police arrival 
(incidentally, failing to notice the ransom note .)
 
Over the next several months, Lindbergh continued to spearhead a 
most unusual investigation.  He rejected the FBI's offer of 
assistance, but called in Morris Rosner, a member of the 
underworld.  Claiming that he was convinced that the kidnapping 
was the work of organized crime leaders, he asked Rosner to 
circulate the ransom note and see if he could get any information 
from his underworld connections.
 
Soon after, Lindbergh received a call from Dr. John F. Condon of 
the Bronx.  Condon had placed an ad in the Bronx Home News 
offering to add his $1000 life savings to the ransom money if the 
child would be safely returned. Condon told Lindbergh that he had 
received a note from the kidnappers, appointing him the go- 
between  for the ransom negotiations.  Lindbergh accepted this, 
and it was Condon, operating under the code name of Jafsie, who 
went to the cemetery where the transfer of money was supposed to 
take place.  Condon, on his second visit, turned a wooden box 
containing $50,000 in gold certificates to a man whom he called 
"Cemetery John."
 
John, he claimed, was of medium build, with a pointy face, high 
cheekbones, slanted, dark, almost "oriental eyes", and a cough.  
His accent sounded either German or Slavic, although  Jafsie 
claimed that he attempted some German, but "John" did not appear 
to understand.
 
Although the money was delivered as instructed, the child was not 
returned.  Instead, Jafsie was given a letter which gave 
directions to the childs supposed location on "boad Nellie (the 
allegedly Germanic spelling of "boat.")  A determined sweep of 
the area where boad Nellie was supposed to be found nothing.
 
The search for the child  ended on May, 12, 1932, when a truck 
driver, stopping to relieve himself in the woods about two miles 
from the Lindbergh home, found the decomposed body of an infant 
partially buried in a pile of  leaves. The child's sexual organs 
had been eaten away, but there was evidence of a skull fracture, 
as though the child had been dropped from a ladder.  Although the 
Lindbergh family physician could not make a positive 
identification, Lindbergh, after a 90 second inspection where he 
counted the corpse's teeth, identified the body as that of his 
son.  The kidnapping had now  officially become a murder.
 
The search for the  criminal continued for two years.  Then a 
German-born carpenter named Bruno Richard Hauptmann , with high 
cheeckbones and a pointy face, but fair and blue-eyed, was caught 
passing one of the bills from the ransom money. Hauptmann was 
arrested and charged with the kidnapping.
 
In what has since been termed the Trial of the Century, Hauptmann 
was convicted, and sentenced to the electric chair, where he died 
proclaiming his complete innocence.
 
The fact that $18,000 of the ransom money was found in 
Hauptmann's garage acted strongly against him.  Hauptmann claimed 
that he found the money in a package left with him by his 
business partner, Isador Fisch, before Fisch left on a trip to 
Germany.  Fisch died there, of tuberculosis.  While cleaning a 
leaking closet, Hauptmann rediscovered the box, and discovered 
that it was full of waterlogged bills.  He claimed that he took 
these to his garage and began to dry them, hiding each bundle as 
it dried.  Fisch, he said, owed him $7,000, so he felt entitled 
to keep and use that portion of the money in the box.  Police and 
reporters labeled this "the Fisch story."
 
Many legal experts and researchers believed Hauptmann, but could 
not save him from the electric chair.  There were too many holes 
in the case, too many unanswered  questions.  But in the 60 years 
since then, four major theories have emerged about what really 
happened in Hopewell New Jersey that day in 1931.
 
The first is that Hauptmann was guilty.  A variation of that was 
that he was guilty, but had not acted alone.
 
The last two theories are more startling.  In 1993, two books 
came out claiming that there never had been a kidnapping; that 
Lindbergh and his family were actually covering up a killing.
 
The premise that the kidnap was a coverup appears to answer many 
of the questions that the arrest and execution of Hauptmann 
raised.  Much of the evidence against Hauptmann was 
unsatisfactory; much of it was plainly manufactured.  And much of 
Lindbergh's conduct during the trial is, in hindsight, very 
peculiar.  A quick review of the basic questions answered and 
left open, will demonstrate this.
 
 
HAUPTMANN
 
Hauptmann was convicted basically on 7 points of evidence.
 
1.  He had $15,000 of the ransom money, and explained it away 
with the "Fisch story."  Since Fisch was conveniently dead, there 
didn't appear to be any way to confirm this.
 
However:  $30,000 of the ransom money remains undiscovered to 
this day. And  almost $3,000 in gold certificates were turned 
into the bank when the county went off the gold standard by one 
JJ  Faulkner. Faulkner was the known pseudonym of a convicted 
master forger, Jacob Novitsky (a man with a pointed face, dark 
complexion and dark, almost oriental eyes) who bragged to his 
cellmates of his involvement in the extortion of the ransom. Just 
before Hauptmann's execution, Faulkner wrote to New Jersey's 
Governor Hoffman claiming that they had arrested the wrong man.
 
2.  Police found, at the site of the crime, a 3/4" chisel.  When 
they examined the toolbox of Hauptmann, a carpenter, they claimed 
that he had no 3/4" chisel, but that this would be standard 
equipment for any competent worker.  Forty years later, crime 
reporter Anthony Scaduto checked the archives of the New York 
police, and found not only the chisel found at the scene of the 
crime, but two more, wrapped in a brown bag labeled "Found in 
Hauptmann's garage."
 
3.  Two witnesses came forward to say that they had seen 
Hauptmann in the Hopewell area the day of the crime.  A foreman 
from the Majestic Corp., for which Hauptmann claimed he was 
employed on that day, brought forth a time card purporting to 
show that he had not been at work. If Hauptmann was working, he 
would not have had time to get to Hopewell within the correct 
time framework to commit the crime.
 
a.  One of the witnesses who placed Hauptmann at the scene was 
legally blind.  In the prosecutor's office, he identified a vase 
of flowers as a woman's hat.  Yet he claimed to be able to 
recognize the face of a man going by in a car.  The second was a 
known pathological liar who denied categorically that he had seen 
anything unusual until the offer of a reward was announced.
 
b.  Police had these witnesses pick Hauptmann from a line-up.  
The line-up consisted of the blond, slight Hauptmann, a burly  
and very Irish detective, and a policeman still in uniform.  
Hauptmann was the only one who even resembled the description of 
"cemetery John" given by Jafsie.
 
c.  On the time card which allegedly showed that Hauptmann had 
not worked that day, all other workers who were absent were 
marked with a line of zeros. Hauptmann's line was marked with 
blots, suggesting that something beneath had been blotted out.
 
4.  Dr. John F. Condon identified Hauptmann in court as the man 
with whom he negotiated the ransom.
 
Until his appearance in the courtroom, Condon refused to identify 
him; at one point, on record, he said that it was definitely not 
"cemetery John."
 
5.   In court, the prosecution produced a board from Hauptmann's 
closet which had scribbled on it Jafsie's phone number.  
Hauptmann couldn't recall writing it there, but conceded that 
since it was in his closet, maybe he did, because he had been 
interested in following the case.
 
A reporter for the New York Daily News later bragged to fellow 
reporters that he had written the number there himself, on a day 
when there was no fresh news in the case and his editors were on 
his back for front page material.
 
For those who doubt this, consider two things.  Hauptmann had no 
phone. If he was using a pay phone to contact Jafsie, he probably 
would use something more portable than a closet board to record 
the number on.  Also, to see the number, one had to remove both 
shelves in the closet and stand in the back using a flashlight. 
Hardly convenient for quick and unobtrusive reference.
 
6.  Police claimed to have found a missing board in Hauptmann's 
attic which matched the wood in the kidnap ladder.  This 
"missing" board was discovered after several previous searches.  
And when the board in question was matched against the piece it 
was allegedly cut away from, it proved to be thicker than the 
board still  in the attic floor. This caused New Jersey's 
governor, Harold Hoffman, to make an open accusation that the 
evidence had been falsified.
 
7.  The piece of evidence that apparently carried most weight 
with the jury was Lindbergh's identification of Hauptmann's voice 
as the same one he heard in the cemetery .  This was a voice that 
Lindbergh heard, only once, two years earlier, from a distance of 
several hundred feet, shouting only 5-6 syllables -- either "hey, 
Doc!  Over hear" or "hey Doctor, over here."  Most experts 
expressed great doubt about the validity of this identification, 
but the jury was impressed.
 
Another point in Hauptmann's favor was the ladder itself.  It was 
very crude, causing most people who knew woodworking to believe 
that no carpenter had ever made it.
 
Consider, too.  William Randolph Hearst, who instructed his 
reporters to cover the trial in a manner that would light a flame 
of indignation in people everywhere, then paid for Hauptmann's 
defense lawyer, Edward J. Reilly.  Reilly was suffering from 
syphilis which caused his institutionalization several months 
later, he routinely had several martinis at lunch during trial, 
and spent less than 40 minutes in consultation with his client.  
He was paid up front, regardless of the outcome of the trial.
 
 
THE "GANG"
 
There is clear evidence that more than one person was involved in 
the collection of the ransom.  In the files of the Bronx police 
dept., Anthony Scaduto found an FBI document giving Lindbergh's 
description of a dark, swarthy man with a rolling gait who acted 
as lookout for cemetery John.
 
This was never brought out at trial.  Kidnap notes always 
referred to plural collectors, which may or may not have been a 
rhetorical device to mislead investigators.       However, when 
Lindbergh called Morris Rosner in to help the investigation, 
Rosner showed copies of the original note to many members of the 
underworld. Contemporary handwriting experts appear to concur 
that the first ransom note was written by a different person than 
those that followed.  (There were people willing to testify to 
that effect during Hauptmann's trial, but they were not permitted 
to testify, since that would have ruined the "lone killer" 
scenario.)
 
Jafsie relates that, during one phone conversation with the 
Scandinavian (both Condon and the cabdriver who delivered the 
ransom-collector's note to Condon originally stated that the man 
was Scandinavian, not German) he heard another voice in the 
background shouting "Statto cito" [shut up, in Italian.]
 
Given the peculiar construction of the kidnap ladder, it would 
have been impossible for a single person to descend the ladder 
with the child.  First, it would not hold more than 160 pounds 
without breaking, according to police tests.  The child would add 
an extra 30 pounds.  Second, the rungs were so awkwardly spaced 
that it would take all but an extremely tall person two hands to 
descend.
 
If Hauptmann (or Fisch) acted alone, where is the rest of the 
ransom money?  And how did Jacob Novitsky, alias JJ Faulkner, get 
at least $3000 of that money?
 
     
CONSPIRACY THEORIES
 
The latest theories claim that there was no kidnapping at all; 
that the kidnap story was devised as a way to cover-up the guilt 
of a member of the Lindbergh family.  In this theory, the ransom 
collection was separate from the death of the child; it was an 
attempt by underworld figures to cash in on the Lindbergh's when 
they were in a vulnerable position.
 
Many researchers have questioned Lindbergh's behavior throughout 
the investigation.  Burdened by their belief in the original 
premise -- that there was a kidnapper at large who must be 
treated carefully so that he wouldn't harm the child-- they 
explained this behavior as both fear of criminal reprisal and an 
attempt to protect his wife.  Scaduto seemed to question this 
protective instinct, despite his apparent acceptance of a 
kidnapping theory.  Lindbergh was not the tender protecting type.  
He was given to cruel practical jokes, and was essentially a 
rather cold person. The cover-up theory, however, explains 
Lindbergh's behavior, and a few other questions unanswered by the 
arrest and conviction of Hauptmann.
 
1.  Why would a kidnapper choose to steal the child during hours 
when household members were still awake and obviously moving 
around the house?
 
2.  How did the kidnapper get down the ladder carrying a 30 pound 
child? At the time of their original investigation, police 
insisted that the criminals must have exited through the house, 
and initially suspected a member of the household.
 
3.  Why were there NO fingerprints at all in the child's room? 
Anne Lindbergh and Betty Gow both admited to searching the room 
when they first discovered that the child was missing, but when 
police arrived on the scene, their fingerprints were missing, 
too..
 
4.  Why did the two women not see the ransom note during their 
search of the room, so that Lindbergh was able to spot it when he 
reentered?  And why was it left on the windowsill, when the 
criminal was already burdened with the child, instead of in the 
crib, which would have been the logical place to put it?  And, on 
discovering that his child was missing, how could any loving 
father have ordered that the note be left untouched, and leave it 
so for two full hours until a fingerprint expert arrived to open 
and read the note?
 
5.  Why did the family dog, Whagoosh, prone to barking at the 
slightest disturbance, not bark on the night of the crime?  And 
why, when the entire staff and Anne Lindbergh testified that the 
dog always barked at disturbances and at strangers approaching 
the house, did Lindbergh deny this?
 
6.  Why did Lindbergh refuse the offer of help from the FBI, and 
consistently refuse to allow police to carry out routine 
investigative procedures, then call in members of the underworld 
to help the investigation?
 
7.  Why, after Lindbergh observed Hauptmann shouting "Hey, 
Doctor" did he wait 10 days before deciding that Hauptmann's was 
the voice he had heard in the cemetery?
 
8.  Why did Lindbergh refuse to allow police to question his wife 
or household staff following his report that the child had been 
stolen?
 
9.  How, if he had no flashlight, did Lindbergh manage to lead 
the police straight to the marks left by the ladder in the ground 
beneath the nursery window?
 
10.  How would an outside criminal know that the Lindberghs were 
at the Hopewell house that Tuesday, when they had never before 
stayed longer than Saturday through Monday?
 
11.  How did the alleged kidnappers know exactly which window 
were the child's, and of those, which one was warped so that it 
wouldn't latch?  This fact could not be determined by routine 
surveillance.
 
These questions made many people suspicious, even at the time of 
the investigation.  If Lindbergh had not been the superhero of 
his times, they would not have been brushed aside so easily; 
today it is almost certain that he or a family member would have 
led the list of suspects. But, in 1931, Lindbergh symbolized all 
that Americans most claimed to value, so any thought of possible 
conspiracy was dismissed as unthinkable.
 
However, there are two theories that appear to answer the above 
questions.
 
The first, presented in Noel Behn's "Lindbergh: The Crime", is 
that the child was murdered by Anne's sister, Elizabeth Morrow.  
Charles Lindbergh originally courted Elizabeth, and the press 
reported rumors of an engagement. However, Elizabeth flew to the 
aid of an ailing brother, and when Lindbergh paid a return visit 
to the Morrow home, only Anne was there.  They began to court, 
and married.  Elizabeth had a mild heart attack following this 
news, and there is some evidence of a nervous breakdown.
 
After the birth of Charles Lindbergh, Jr., several disturbing 
incidents led his parents to give strict orders that the child 
was never to be left alone with Elizabeth.  Household servants 
all filed affidavits that Elizabeth Morrow killed the family dog, 
and once threw young Charlie out along with the household garbage.
 
According to Behn's theory, the staff DID leave Elizabeth alone 
with Charlie.  And, to avoid further disgrace, further hounding 
of the family by the press, the family spent two days dreaming up 
a way to cover up the crime. The kidnap story was the result; the 
fact that Morris Rossner's display of the kidnap note sparked an 
extortion scheme played right into the plans, since it appeared 
to confirm that there really was a kidnap gang out there.
 
Elizabeth Morrow was institutionalized soon after the crime.  
Gossip about her possible involvement persisted, at least in low 
key whispers at least through the 50s.  However, to accept this 
theory, one must also accept that not only Lindbergh but the 
entire Morrow family, and the staffs of both households were 
involved in the cover-up, and that they all lied on the witness 
stand, knowingly sending an innocent man to his death.
     
The second theory, on its face, is even more incredible: 
Lindbergh himself killed the child in the course of a practical 
joke.  Lindbergh was known for cruel practical jokes.  He often 
filled bunkmates beds with lizards and other reptiles; on one 
occasion he put a snake in the bed of a man who was terrified of 
them.  Asked if the snake had been venomous, Lindbergh replied 
"Yes, but not fatally."  He also filled a friend's canteen with 
kerosene and watched him drink it; the man was hospitalized for 
severe internal burns. And, only two weeks prior to the reported 
kidnapping, Lindbergh hid the child in a closet then ran to his 
wife's room, claiming the child had been stolen. He let the joke 
go on for 20 terrifying minutes before confessing.
 
In "Crime of the Century", Ahlgren and Monier theorize that 
Lindbergh tried that joke one too many times.  In their scenario, 
Lindbergh called home to say he would be late, but actually 
arrived at the usual time.  He climbed his makeshift ladder to 
his son's room, planning to spirit the child out and arrive at 
the front doow with him in hand, claiming something like "Look 
who I met in New York."  Unfortunately, the ladder broke, 
Lindbergh slipped, and the child's head was smashed against the 
side of the house.  Lindbergh then hid the body, went home, 
failed to check on his young son even though the child had been 
sick, and spent some time in his study alone before Betty Gow 
reported the child's disappearance. Ahlgren and Monier speculate 
that Lindbergh wrote the original ransom note during this time.  
Most experts agree that the wording of the note was typical of an 
English speaking person trying to sound Germanic, rather than of 
a real German.
 
To accept this theory, as amazing as it may be, is somewhat 
easier than to believe the charge against Elizabeth Morrow.  The 
great American hero was above suspicion. Police would never think 
to check his alibi, to see why he arrived home an hour later than 
usual that night.  Nor did they hesitate to follow his orders 
throughout the investigation, although they, not Lindbergh, were 
the trained investigators.
 
An analysis of Lindbergh's character makes this sort of practical 
joke a strong possibility; that he could cover it up so 
successfully can be attributed both to the awe in which he was 
held, and the successful diversion of the ransom note.  Much of 
Lindbergh's more peculiar behavior can be attributed to 
understandable moments of panic.
 
In the late 1930s, when Lindbergh openly associated with Nazis, 
and made many public statements about the desirability of a 
Master Race here in America, there were some fitful rumors that 
Lindbergh had killed his own child because it was genetically 
defective -- retarded. As war and memory faded, these whispers 
died down.  Baby boomers, if they knew much about the case at 
all, tended to hear it from the perspective of Lindbergh, the 
vulnerable hero; his later politics forgotten.
 
There is no proof that Lindbergh in fact killed his own child; 
however, the theory answers questions left open by Hauptmann's 
arrest and execution.  And in this theory, only one person had to 
keep a dreadful secret and perjure himself.  If true, however, 
Lindbergh is guilty not only of the death of his son, but of the 
cold and deliberate murder of Bruno Richard Hauptmann.

2. The Future History of PepNet
===============================

1994
====

- July 1994:

Pepsico Inc., makers of Pepsi-Cola, announces the creation of PepNet.
PepNet will be a public-access network of BBSes, with nodes in most major
cities, providing low-cost access to images, sounds, and text files.  The
press release states that Pepsico will purchase files on a lump-sum basis for
public domain distribution, and that Pepsico believes the cost to it of the
network will be offset by the positive publicity generated.

- December 1994:

PepNet is up and running, with approximately 500 subscribers North
America-wide.  The most popular download items are R-rated images purchased
from Playboy, images and sounds from popular Paramount TV shows and movies,
and the library of public-domain classics schnorred from world.std.com.  The
fact that all of these are available freely elsewhere does not seem to faze
the PepNet people.

Pepsico announces the expansion of PepNet services to include Internet
services, in particular the Usenet newsgroups, on some sites.

1995
====

- March 1995:

PepNet is a standing joke on the Internet/Usenet, but its success proves that
it will at least not be an embarrassment to Pepsico.  Pepsico starts heavily
promoting PepNet in computer circles.

Pepsi releases a general-broadcast TV ad which features two 1/2-second shots
of young people laughing while looking at a computer screen and drinking Pepsi.

- August 1995:

In a major joint press release, Pepsico, Microsoft, and Apple announce the
CyberSurfBoard, a low-cost computer specialized for connecting to nets such as
PepNet.  Along with the low price for hardware and software, users get 1 month
of free access and 1 hour of free download time on PepNet.

- December 1995:

CyberSurfBoard sales are brisk.  There are now approximately 20,000
subscribers to PepNet, and nodes in every major city.  Magazines such as Time,
Newsweek, Sports Illustrated, and Wired, and the four major US TV networks,
have now jumped on the bandwagon and are releasing images and sounds.  Various
copycat services are starting up or in development by Philip Morris, GE, and
Mitsubishi.

The success of PepNet baffles longtime Internet users, since all the services
it provides are provided better elsewhere.  This point of view does not get
much coverage in the established media.

PepNet begins providing very low-cost Usenet feeds to other sites.

1996
====

- March 1996:

Coke releases an ad featuring young people talking and laughing while looking
at a computer screen and drinking Coke.

- June 1996:

Pepsico and an unnamed Chicago BBS operator reach a quiet out-of-court
settlement.  The sysop was sued for allegedly harboring and encouraging people
who took images from PepNet and distributed them free on the Internet.  The
sysop agrees to pay Pepsico $350,000 and to desist from operating a BBS for
five years.

- September 1996:

PepNet subscribers are in the high hundreds of thousands.

20% of all Usenet articles now flow through the sites uh-huh.pepnet.com and/or
new-gen.pepnet.com (which are really virtual sites made up of dozens of
machines each).  3% of all non-technical articles on Usenet come from PepNet
sites.

A flame war breaks out on several technical and non-technical newsgroups about
whether the presence of things like "uh-huh.pepnet" and the line
  Organization: PepNet (The Net for a New Generation)
in the headers of Usenet messages constitutes advertising, and if so whether
it subverts NSF Internet use policy.

- October 1996:

Pepsico announces "The PepNet Eloquence Awards".  The 10 people who write the
most eloquent Usenet articles of the year (in PepNet's opinion) will receive 1
year of free access and unlimited download time on PepNet.

Time-Warner and Pepsico announce a long-term cooperative agreement on provision
of images and services.  _Time_ gives exclusive rights to its electronic
version to PepNet.  Paramount bites its lip but continues to provide images to
PepNet, since it's the biggest thing going.

1997
====

- January 1997:

The "advertising" flame war is being won by Pepsi.  Many university
administrators, alerted that PepNet offers outrageously cheap Usenet feeds,
have switched to PepNet feeds.  Now about 35% of Usenet articles flow through
PepNet sites.

- April 1997:

The PepNet Eloquence Awards are announced.  Five US college students,
including two who argued vociferously in support of PepNet, are among the
winners.

JetStream (Philip Morris's copycat network) and Spectrum (Mitsubishi's copycat
network) now route about 8% of Usenet articles.

1998
====

- January 1998:

The number of articles per day on Usenet is now about 30 times what it was
five years ago.

PepNet, JetStream, and Spectrum now route 80% of Usenet articles.  15% of
articles on technical newsgroups are posted from sites on these three nets.
This is attributed to companies and universities cutting back on direct Usenet
feeds because of good group PepNet rates.

Pepsico announces a modest downturn in profits.

- February 1998:

Pepsico announces cuts to its Advertising and PepNet divisions.  Further
financial review is undertaken.

PepNet modestly increases its user fees.

- April 1998:

_Time_ runs an article on how the three major Usenet providers are losing
money on their networks.

Pepsico makes its full financial report for the fiscal year.  It seems that its
profits have dipped more sharply than it had previously announced.

Pepsico floats a modest proposal on the net.  Either:

(a) It can increase its user fees by 50% in order to save PepNet, or
(b) It can drastically reduce the Usenet feeds it provides, or
(c) It can add the header
      Sponsored-by: Pepsico, makers of Pepsi-Cola
    to all articles it routes, and the header
      X-Advertising: You got the right one, baby!
    on all non-technical articles it routes, and cut its advertising division
    instead.

- May 1998:

PepNet proponents have the edge in the resultant massive flame war.  Several
people claim that the addition of advertising to Usenet was Pepsi's intention
from the start.  They are labelled paranoids, and their credit records are
somehow revealed via an anonymous server in Venezuela.

- August 1998:

Brad Templeton, the Undersecretary of Science and Information Technology in
President Quayle's administration, announces a major shift in NSF policy.
Advertising on NSF sites, "within acceptable limits", is explicitly allowed.
Cuts to financial support for university computer networks are made.

1999
====

- March 1999:

Pepsico announces an upturn in profits.  Joel Furr, the head of PepNet since
its inception, is credited with the success.

2000
====

- January 2000:

PepNet has 10 million subscribers worldwide.

95% of Usenet articles have at least 3 lines of "sponsorship" or advertising
messages.

50% of Usenet articles have at least 8 lines of advertising.

10% of the total messages on Usenet, in every newsgroup, are ads for
non-computer-related products and services.

The ailing Coca-Cola Company is taken over by Philip Morris Inc.

2020
====

Furr retires from Pepsico at age 45, with a generous pension, after numerous
accolades on his brilliance.  An unauthorized biography of him, written by
Moon Unit Zappa, is released.

The biography gets great attention on the Internet... which is now generally
known as PepNet.

[I thought some of the news.future crowd might be interested in some of the
 new developments, especially Internet-sharable virtual newsgroups.]

        Strn (Scan TRN) version 0.9.2 is now available.
See below for FTP sites.  [Some of the uunet mirrors might take a day or
two to get a copy.]

        Strn is based on trn (version 3.4.1 by Wayne Davison), and
contains all of the trn commands and features.  It adds many new
capabilities to trn, such as a newsgroup browser, virtual newsgroups,
scoring/rating of articles, and easy configuration menus.  Strn has
been developed and tested over the past year with the help of more
than 50 alpha testers.  The beta release is intended to make the
current version more widely available, test out some of the new
concepts (such as index-moderation using virtual newsgroups), and
gather suggestions for improvement.

        Strn is still under development, although most of its planned
features are implemented.  Future versions of strn will mainly improve
the documentation, scoring ease-of-use, and configurability of the
program.  Version 1.0 release is expected in a finite amount of time.

Outline of major strn features:
* The "scan mode" interface
    o A consistent full-screen interface for the four scan modes.
        . Implements many common commands such as movement, shell escapes,
          and searching.
        . Common code allows quick development of new scan modes.
    o Uses arrow keys for movement (trn-style 'n' and 'p' are also allowed).
    o X windows mouse selection (when strn is run under "xterm").
* Group scan mode
    o Full-screen interface for newsgroup selection.
    o Can replace the trn newsgroup selector for most purposes.
    o Easy subscription/unsubscription to newsgroups.
    o User-definable and sharable topic hierarchies.
        . Example: one could have an "IBM PC" topic containing
          the groups in comp.sys.ibm.pc.*, comp.os.msdos.*, comp.os.os2,
          and comp.os.ms-windows.*
    o Topic hierarchies can be easily shared:
        . Locally, by adding a link to another user's topics.
        . Remotely, by sending the topic files to other users.
        . Via Internet using Uniform Resource Locators (URLs).
* Virtual scan mode
    o Supports "virtual groups" consisting of articles from any newsgroup.
    o Supports an easy-to-use "hotlist" of selected articles.
    o Merged groups, such as rec.arts.sf.* (all articles in those groups)
    o Virtual group files can be mailed to other users, and (with some setup)
      automatically added to a user's virtual group files.
    o Posted virtual group files can be used directly, allowing easy
      "index-moderated" newsgroups.
    o Virtual newsgroups can be shared via Internet and URLs.
* Article scan mode
    o Subject-based "threading" available.
        . All articles with the same subject can be displayed as one line.
    o Summaries and keywords can be displayed.
    o Articles can be marked and read as a group.
    o Displays articles in either arrival or score order.
      (See below for more information on scoring.)
* Scoring
    o Articles are assigned a score by scoring rules consisting of:
        . Header matching: either exact text or regular expressions.
        . (optional) NewsClip programs.
    o Scoring allows high scoring (interesting) articles to be presented
      before non-scored (ordinary) or negative-scoring (uninteresting) ones.
      For instance, in sci.space, one could give higher scores to
      postings from NASA or JPL, and easily read only those articles.
    o Articles are graded on a continuous scale, rather than a binary
      keep/junk distinction.  (Articles scoring below a threshold
      value can be junked automatically.)
    o Scoring is *fast*, typically limited by I/O times to fetch article
      headers.
    o Scoring rules can be entered with an easy-to-use menu.
    o Scoring can be done from a shell script run by cron/at.
    o Scores are saved to a file so they don't need to be recalculated.
* Online help (help scan mode)
    o Typing 'H' at almost any prompt enters help scan mode.
    o Help scan mode presents menus of documentation, containing:
        . The complete trn manual, broken into sections.
        . Full strn documentation.
        . Introductory USENET documents (such as "What is USENET?").
    o Help files can be easily edited by the local administrator.
* Online configuration
    o Easy menu-based configuration of almost all strn options.
    o Accessible from the newsgroup selector or group scan mode.
    o Configuration changes are automatically saved for the next strn run.
    o Site-wide configuration

Lines: 31

I too wonder if the revealing blouse was a "commission generator."  There is a
Merry-Go-Round that I know of where the women all but hang their tits out!
 I used to go there when I had no money, just to look at the women. Personally,
 i found the whole experience irritating because they were into some serious
 high-pressure sales.  They would tell the guys how great they would look in
something, let's say, a shirt. As I'm putting on the shirt, they'll toss a pair
 of pants in and insist that they haven't seen the pants on anyone yet and they
 just want to see how they look on someone. Next, they'll toss a pair of shoes
in, and then a belt.   I was foolish enough to fall for this, and all the while
 they're smiling, exposing cleavage, telling me how great I look in these cloth
es.  After I'm in these clothes, looking in the mirror, they calculate how much
 all of these clothes cost and the various forms of payment that they accept -
including lay-away!    After I put on $200 worth of clothes, looked at all the
cleavage, and listened to how great I looked, I reminded them that I was
 "just looking" when I got into the store.   And it was amazing what happened.
When I took off the clothes and left the dressingroom, there was no one out the
re. The smiling cleavages were GONE!!!   ONE lady was around to take my clothes
 to put back on the shelf - and she did a poor job of concealing her ire. But t
he cleavage was gone!

So, I think the revealing blouse was part of the sales technique.

I could elaborate on the vast amount of sailors that crowd Merry-Go-Round on
  paydays!!  And I believe that this is because they get to see a little tit, a
nd get their ego stroked while these women sell them very cheesey, very trendy
 clothes.

  I never thought I'd post to the net again, but my heart goes out to you
little Chelsea.  I think it's time you shold know the truth.

  Honey, in my days as the Enema Bandit, I did alot of bad things.  Sometimes
it was just pushing women onto the ground at night and putting an enema tube in
their butt, then squeezing warm tang from the attatched bag into their colon.
Honey, you gotta realize...Well, shoot.  Honey, sometimes I didn't use tang.
Sometimes I used my own manseed, diluted in a mixture of corn syrup and
water (hummingbird feed).  I'm afriad this gloucose mixture energised my
seed, which implanted a stray ball of shit in my victim's ass.

  This ball grew and grew and one day when Bill Clinton was fucking the woman
in the ass, it attatched itself to the end of his little penis.  When Bill and
Hilly discovered the growth, they decided that Bill must be pregnant (after
all, Hillary was so much more MASCULINE).  The shitball which had now begun
feeding on Bill's already tiny choad^H^H^H^H^Hpenis eventually grew over a
period of weeks.  When it fell off his bleeding stump, Hilly picked it up and
that's when they named you, Chelsea.

  But I'm your real father, sweetheart.  You're a product of my loins, and I
think you've been away from them for far too long.  I see you on the news with
that lost look in your eyes...You're so much more advanced than your friends.
