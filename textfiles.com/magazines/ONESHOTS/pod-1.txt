Rancidium (A quick & easy explosive)

- Take a liquid plumber bottle, 1/2 EMPTY... Put in lighter fluid, & put on
top plastic wrap to seal it. Pierce plastic wrap & insert a wick (preferably
long). Then, set the wick on fire & run.. Basically what you just created is
: Chemistry coming up here:

- Lighter fluid starts burning
- Liquid Plumber becomes active
- Internal pressure causes Liquid Lighter misxutre to mix w/ plastic
- Plastic blows
- Little bits of corrosive-acid laced plastic blow all over & anyone in the

Some thoughts on Christmas
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Christmas is the one holidat which makes me physically sick. Think. What
is their to celebrate? The birth of Jesus? Mi amigo, that is total bullshit.
(Quick history lesson coming up)
Way back in the 100 ads, Christianity's main competition among the outskirts
of the Roman Empire (where the Roman religion hadn't exactly caught on), was
a religion called Mithraism. Mithraism worshipped "Mithras", a prophet who
lived in Persia. He was credited with healing the sick, feeding people,
prophecy & all the things your typical holy man does. But, with a difference:
According to the religion, Mithras was born on December 25th to a virgin.
Wow! Sound familar? Anyhow, Mithraism was a pretty damn cool religion, with
most celebrations marked by getting drunk & having massive orgies. Of course,
Christianity with it's somber, brainwashing, no-sex no-fun no-anything
philosiphy couldn't compete that well. So, the Church seniors decided to
have a symposium on how to cope with it. So, they decided to celebrate Jesus's
birthday every 25th of December, with a somber church service. (Not fun, but
with the proper spin put on it, well...).
So now you know the truth about Christmas. So now what do you have left?
Just lots of commercial bullshit by big corperation$ wanting you to buy their
neato 300,000$ new products, the church celebrating a BS holiday, & stupid
motherfucks from the Salvation Army begging for money. And the stupid
HYPOCRISY of Christmas sickens me.. The theme is supposed to be love &
happiness, but all people do is hate & threaten each other over the holiday.
Geez...
