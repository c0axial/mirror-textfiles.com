| Article 01:  Breaking into King Soopers Vans. |
+-----------------------------------------------+

We were sitting around at FLAK World Headquarters, waiting for
Wargames to come on the U.S.A. Network when Tprof came up with the
idea of breaking into Bell vans.  We all that that would be a pretty
cool hack, so we decided to skip Wargames (I have it on a pirated
videotape anyway) and go break into some vans.  Because we had all
read "Secrets of a Super Hacker" we all knew not to dress up before
something like this, so we all switched intp old dark clothes and hit
the streets. Miss March is the only one of us with a car, so she
drove.  We drove around the city for three or four hours and couldn't
find a Bell van.

We did eventually spot three King Soopers vans parked behind King
Soopers, so we decided to hit them.  Two of them were locked, so those
were out.  The third, which Tprof checked, was unlocked.  Tprof and I
broke in while Miss March kept watch for the feds.  We got some really
eleet paperwork which Miss March told us was something about
registration.  We are now registered King Soopers employees!  Tprof
found a screwdriver and a lug wrench which we will use for breaking
into more King Soopers vans in the future.  We also found some
customers names, addresses and phone numbers.  No credit card numbers,
but we've got their info!  God, I love being a hacker!

| Article 02.  Eleet script to exploit Windows bug to gain root in MS-DOS. |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

We at FLAK have recently discovered a bug in Microsoft Mindows
that will give you root on any DOS machine.

This script will give you root on any DOS machine running Microsoft
Windows.  To use it, save it to a file called ROOT.BAT on the drive
where Windows is installed and then type ROOT.  After that, typing
WIN will give you root.  To get back into normal windows, you will
have to type WINDOWS.  This is pretty noticeable, so you had better
clean up before your victim catches you.

-- BEGIN ROOT.BAT --

@CD\WINDOWS
@MV WIN.COM WINDOWS.COM
@ECHO @PROMPT # > WIN.BAT
@ECHO @ECHO You are now root! >> WIN.BAT

-- END ROOT.BAT --

| Article 03.  Review of "Secrets of a Super Hacker." |
+-----------------------------------------------------+

We purchased "Secrets of a Super Hacker" by the Knightmare and we all
read it.  This is the coolest book since Unearthed Arcana.  I'm not
sure who Knightmare is, but I think he was in the Legion of Doom.

The Knightmare told us how to hack root on our local library system.
He also listed passwords which are used at our local university and
listed some of the super secret ASCII codes.  I don't know how the
feds let this book get published with all of those ASCII codes in it.

If you are serious about being an eleet hacker, you've go to read this
book.  It's published by a company called "Loompanics."  I'd print
their address and phone number, but I'm not sure it's public info.  If
we can get in tough with them, we will put it in the next issue.

Our next release will include an eleet GIF of Miss March.
Or, if we can't card a scanner to make the GIF, we'll
release an ANSI of her.
