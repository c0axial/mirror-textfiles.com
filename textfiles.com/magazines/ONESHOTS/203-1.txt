Welcome to our first issue!
***************************
      Wouldn't it be nice to see a 'zine that breaks from the trend of all
those others out there? You asked for it, so here it is. This premier issue
will just outline the group's focus and provide you with our member list.
Give me credit for at least doing this one : our existence was kinda hinging
on it and I didn't feel like doing it. And with that shit outta the way...

Article 1 : 2o3 Up Close - An outline of our group
Written by Scoop on 9/29/94
-=-=-=-
      
      Ok, all of you guys know that the original reason 2o3 was formed was to
be a competitor to KoV in the revival of the local scene. It was also a local
h/p/a group (well, somewhat). And then after 2o3 was made a part of Valg's
bunch it sorta died out due to the non-commitment of its seniors. Well NO
MORE! 
      2o3 is now a group working for the rights of modemers and gamers. We
will also touch on highlighting the efforts of others to improve our local
scene and other scenes around the country (now that KoV is a semi-national
group).
      I can't really say anymore at this time 'cause I've got more important
stuff to do, so if you have any questions 'bout the group send 'em in for our
FYBITE (Letters to the editor) column.

joining.

Shoutouts to that fool bro of mine, The Bohemith, I'm taking 2o3 out of your
hair now; Lord Valgamon for his concern (I hope you're happy man); Dark Death
YOU STINKY LITTLE MONKEY - act your fucking age man; Alloy & Alkaline for
the compliments on my taste in women; Joe Lieberman who moved me to fuckin'
tears when he said he didn't want his kids playing Mortal Kombat and Night
Trap (DUH SHITHEAD THEN DON'T LET THEM!); ID Software and Midway Electronics
who, in the face to bureaucrats, flipped a big fat bird; to all of ACiD for
yet another PH4T P4Q!; to Kim A. Holcomb - save me a room on East Campus; and
