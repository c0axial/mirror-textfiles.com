	here it is boys and girls, the introductory issue of mystery!  an
e-zine dedicated to the expression and exploitation of all those wonderful
poems we write -:- because face it -:- our world's pretty fucked up.  so
let's talk about it!

	from that annoying boyfriend or girlfriend to the psycho stalker,
you know we've all felt it.  and we'd all go crazy if we didn't try to
figure out exactly why we let these things get to us.  here are a couple
of little poems i've written because no one can tell me they know how i
feel, and it's almost useless to try and explain it. 

     	"unless you can see inside my head, you can't possibly understand." 
                              				-less than jake

	so for all you girls out there tired of holding it all inside, i'm
just here to say that people will listen if you speak loud enough.  you
just have to get their attention :) and that's not hard to do... so before
i turn the music on for my strip tease i'd just like to say that's there's
fun to be had for all... but just as much pain in the end.

	lots of tasty poetry, so eat up!

                    the world around me
                    crumbled down
                    my thoughts i wish
                    i could erase
                    i want things to be
                    the way they were
                    before i saw your face
                    you were just an illusion
                    the way i wanted you to be
                    but now i see you're no different
                    just pure complexity
                    so try and let me down
                    without too much bother
                    i can't be hurt anymore

                    the days were short
                    but the nights grew long
                    because i always wanted more
                    so tell me what you want from me
                    and then i will tell you...

                    my lust is crazed
                    i can only say this

                    take the risk
                    you've told me you want me
                    in so many words
                    but the distance betwee us
                    holds us apart

                    and it's hard to tell
                    just what i'm being told
                    i need an answer
                    can't waste anymore time

                    for once in my life
                    i felt it was right
                        innocence
                    it was different
                    something new
                        truth
                    we didn't lie
                    or try to be fake
                        reality
                    but then i left

                    we promise to meet
                    make future plans

                    so my hopes are there

                    so still i write
                    and he replies
                        love
                    so i need him

                    from far away
                    you smile at me
                    share your dreams...
                    and fantasies
                    it's the closest thing
                    i've found to love
                    but it still remains...
                    will you be the same
                    when i see you again
                    will your smile have changed
                    by the time i see you again
                    will you wait for me
                    so far away
                    what do you want from me...
                    so far away
                    i expect so much from you
                    i destroy myself
                    so i give up
                    and turn inward
                    have i found another happiness?
                    or just proved myself a hypocrite
                    so many questions
                    i'll never get to answer
                    maybe if i ignore them,
                    my problems will go away
                    just like you

                    unexpected meeting
                    we find each other
                    cheerful greeting
                    we turn away from another...
                    we're pushed together
                    renew our past
                    talk to one another
                    a future? we asked
                    a sudden complication
                    of which i'm not aware
                    i'm afraid to ask the question
                    i'd never even dare
                    my irresponsible ignorance
                    foolish pride and spite
                    keep me from the truth
                    who knows what's right
                    this happened in our past
                    our only other encounter
                    we should have learned
                    from our last mistake
                    i guess neither of us has changed

                    things have changed so quickly
                    but i don't seem to mind
                    i guess i wasn't ready
                    to see what i could find
                    or maybe i just wouldn't wait
                    for the plans i had inside
                    you were an excuse to put things off
                    a reason to brush aside
                    but now i know what i want
                    and it's not you... 
                    so i guess i lied
                    i thought my feelings were real
                    maybe they were -:- i'll never know
