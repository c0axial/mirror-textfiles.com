                          MAYAN UPDATE IN THE EIGHTIES


                     Before it was a one-sided conversation

                     with rocks and dirt.  While sweating

                     And swatting, we glared at rocks,

                     trying ot give them some humanity.

                     Ancient ball games pitted captives

                     against one another for their lives.

                     Heads of the losers were the balls.

                     Blood was the mortar of life.

                     Aristocrates drew their own blood

                     to nourish the gods and inspire

                     hallucinations in the heads of serpents.

                     Before going to war for example,

                     The king punctured his penis

                     with a stingray spine while the queen

                     drew a thorn-barbed rope through her tongue.

                     Thus the Mayans kept the universe alive.

                     The name for one king was shield.

                     "It"
                         more than adds up
        what I know of mathematics
               the unclean universe
                    lines parallel from any angle
        "you & you&you&you&you& "
                    lines perpendicular from any point
        I love you absolutely
               & you too
               I'm always happy
               when the phone rings
               it's always good news
               when you call
        no time for aught but love
        my heart is full
                   I stroke my calico cat pull out
                   a few clumps of hair visit my ailing neighbor weep
                   for the dead send out frantic bursts of psychic love
                   to save on my own long-distance bills:
                                  I can make you (you, you) phone
        it's all good
               when you call
                   I'm imprisoned by these coordinates
                                :  /noise/memory
                       someday the coffee'll be tepid
                                            (just how I like it)
               at every 3 a.m. feeding
                   the letters'll be rich & frequent
                       the jokes apropos
        titles & new names fluff
        round my dizzy head like relentless rowers
                          "I'd hate to see you when you're happy"
        are we tired or is her exuberance crowding our joy?
                   I cannot go on without you/
                   I can live without anyone:I must
                   there are more irrational numbers than rational
               tho the number of each is infinite:
                   my unswerving valiance
                                   you(you,you,you..........

                                            part 2


                  Empires filter, misinterpret the old
                  tales to keep afloat, thought always being
                  just the continuuing of one thought.
                  In battle or lovemaking, hero's blond
                  wig falls off. He hides his face,  loses head,
                  becomes all shoulders, contraposto murdered
                  beautifully by fate's delicate hands. We weep
                  only at change, hating the lover for
                  queering the ideal, however slightly.
                  Only proffs that love exists are pets, sex
                  organs, never quite severed umbilical.

                  Burly-queen savior, neon-lit, annunciated,
                  killed, mourned, resurrected over the week-
                  end, in his undershorts. Light shone through
                  the fabric.  I helped carry him away.
                  We didn't know where we were or who we
                  were or where we were going. We avoided
                  everyone, to stay in the dream-- which love
                  made, only to keep us from...

                  red tangoies, weeping. Man robed in silken dress-
                  ing gown in large apartment in great city
                  takes one too many, observing a news-
                  paper as though it were life, observing
                  but not acting, made incomplete by
                  business, war,
                                 while

                                         waits for the bus in
                  dead towns, Z scrapes his shoe sole twenty times
                  in front of a church or steals/owns a fast
                  car, pure laminated animal joy
                  beneath a suddenly chill August moon,
                  cleaning up the day's mess and sleep for
                  another. One becomes one's shadow, moves
                  inexorably to empty streets, voices
                  of slightly durnk friends in the distance,
                  and an evening of farts that hill breezes
                  blow away with exhaust fumes,
                  though when you hear what you
                  had waited for for so long coming, there's
                  a moment's fear.

                  old on a bench at one a.m. holds his
                  heart, watches his watch, fat, few head hairs,
                  quickly decides to smoke a cigaret,
                  pretend to wait for a bus.

                  Night world reflected on black water scrim
                  of shop windows that stars high silent
                  solitaries, in murders, back the way
                  I came, curling up to sexy death
                  above butcher shops, where
                                            his
                                               son
                                                 (perhaps
                  it's his son) is slowly disrobing.
                  Tomorrow he must go to work, with his
                  kind hurt gaze, too short, wrong accent.
                  On the second night he soiled his shirt, the
                  third his pants. Nothing quite works though he surely
                  does. He turns bright gold in his sleep, dreaming
                  he's staring at the gates of paradise.

                     daughters a daughter-in-law, the mother
                    then looks up "lubricity" in the

        BY CHICO.  On wall of PANTRY SUPREME . Across from Veselka's
        big window.  Pop painting of Mr. Magoo, Culture Club Japanese /
        Woody Allen, Mr. Fox and Mr. Rabbit playing in the same
        cartoon band. Two hearts on the sidewalk -- E. 9th street.
        A twenty foot black arrow 52 feet high on side of building
        pointing nowhere . Monday night. 11 p.m. Downtown. Painted
        on a fence. SLAM DANCING. ROCK AGAINST RACISM.  One guess.
        The people of Nicaragua.  Mumble -- I can't hear a word. Signature
        on sidewalk -- DON'T KILL THE PEOPLE OF MANAGUA. Lower East
        Side Corn Garden. Slogan. HORN OF PLENTY. NOT THE GENTRY. The
        grey six stroy building. And the dirty brown brick ones. Fire-
        escapes by burnt windows. Beneath -- sunflowers. Greenery. A
        community bulletin board. Next -- a car drives across Ave C.
        / Completely changed on the exterior of car -- Big Antlers
        on welded racks front of the car. Blinking  J E S U S  LIGHTS .
        Plastic Hail Maries stuck to outside body of car.  Mariachi

        A CORN ROAST IN COMMUNITY GARDEN.  1/4 block vacant lot at Ave
        B and E. 6th St., converted into community garden. On late
        Sunday afternoon (an odd light rain falling, in the late summer
        1985). A grey, warm day. The garden nearly ripe with cabbage,
        corn, cherry tomatoes, banks of herbs and small flowers,
        cucumbers, onions, kale and giant sunflowers.  S U N F L O W E R
        GARDEN. Primrose -- a little overgreen. Clam shells in circles
        on a flower bed. In the garden house (a shelter built from
        wood found in nearby Lower East side Refugee Ruins) -- accordian
        music is played. People sit on chairs, stools. Everybody knows
        everybody or even the strangers are eating corn, too -- since
        the event has been advertised.

             Surrounding the garden on two sides are high buildings
        (can't see over them) -- hand-laundered green and black shirt
        still hangs out window to the north/east -- downtown side.
        IN THE G A R D E N  a prayer wheel is turned. A blessing
        for the corn. On surrounding cyclone fence, the purple
        and white morning glory.

        would i rather in dirty rotten
        spend countless days to finally
            in so many undereyelines later
        see that face in a small

        The days of adventure are over
        The rains of leaden question fall the same as snow in the east
        but it isn't cold.

        Magic star dust blows away and now is a windy tow

        where old beats are still good beats
              snapping out the poetry in
              a beard. a belly now
              upright tits in a t-shirt

              the golden gate
              the golden words
              their golden time
                When a black man poet sat at the Trieste
              with good blondes from the midwest
                When a black man poet could live on charm
              before he lived off the friends
              gathered here to say goodbye on Chorus Shore.

        We walked up to a dark door that said Open.

              It was a black ocean
              then a mountain
              topped with our spilled seeds.

        Your horn played to wind sucked
        into sunset. living more
        than in a room where everything bounces back.
        We are the are of saxophones
        more alive outside.

                  of your hand on my neck
                  held thumb and finger
                  a grasp
                  not affection
                  but defined touch

                  as we searched so diligently
                  for our sushine responding
                  with ecstasy jumping
                  skin to fore
                  all colors
                  rising
                  our jaws and groins
                  the warm not taken lightly
                  a godforce found shining in

             But here
             in this city land
                     play park
                     six flags over destitute
             i ride a gesture
             to the sea or building range
             Where is my imagination here?

             There are cold winds that cross the path
             but the guides say walk in warm streams
             keep tuned in
             know the air when
             all the visions and plans seen a far away
             are treasure maps.

                  I've cried truth
                  in fleet moments
                  seeing myself for the first time sincere
                  and aching with realizing so clear and hard.

             There is no cheating in the vault called Agate.

                             After you said

                             We are the loves

                             of our lives

                             I said

                             jumping out a plane

                             You are a lighthouse

                             that's showing a movie

                             You are, you said,

                             I run each night



                             And I said

                             Loving you is like

                             slipping underwater

                             and breathing

                             better than I ever have before.

        I wonder what would happen if I didn't wipe my ass:  this poem?

        I hear you every night around this time sweet stuff is that

        Your doggie panting so hot & happy to get out? the last

        Piss of the evening is perhaps the most sentimental one of all

        I see my face reflected reflective in the blue of the bowl

        You are so beautiful, I whisper, I have never seen you

        Looking so fucking beautiful! would love to fuck you

        If only I could! I run wetting the floor to the window

        To see you looking up you run your tongue around those newly wet lips

        while your mutt takes an aching crap:  "Ohh, lick it up"

        You could say that to me & I'd hear you, you could even leash me

        You stare down the dark frightening street, a cat in heat

        You pretend you don't hear my heart knocking out a beat, you take it out

        To take a leak, a hard piss, like yellow tears

        Short-panted upon a stoop watching I bet for cops

        This block's for drugs & that goes for all you mugs

        One simply walks faster or slower according to one's character
