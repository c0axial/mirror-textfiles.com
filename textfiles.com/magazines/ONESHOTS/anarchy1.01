Welcome to Anarchy!, a new mag from Chaos. As a person who wrote the 
terrormag series, I wanted to continue to write such mags but expand 
them. Joining Chaos was the best thing I could have done for this. When I 
looked at 2 mags called Phun and Phrack, hacking mags, I liked their 
format and decided to do a newsfile that was more like that. This mag is 
currently looking for 1 more editor and several writers for the mag and 
we are looking for submissions to this mag. I don't care what your 
article is about. If its on hacking, phreaking, the pirate world, a BBS 
review, I don't care. I would like to see it computer related but that is 
not neccessary. Things such as incendiary devices explained easily or 
"How to sabatoge a bridge" or things of that nature are acceptable. 
Editorials <about this mag, the group, the group's activities or BBS's or 
sysops or any BBS related topic> are more than welcome. And now, on to 
the show.

What happened with Sun Devil
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Unless you have been in a cave or your modem broke, preventing you from 
logging on any BBS's, there was a national raid on hackers in mid May. 
This raid, dubbed Operation Sun Devil, resulted in at least 28 search 
warrants in 14 cities and 7 arrests according to the police. I estimate 
that more than 20 people have been arrested as a direct result of Sun 
Devil. One teenager in long island was arrested, supposedly using the 
handle "Crazie Eddie" and was charged with "Computer tampering and 
trespass, and unlawful use of a computer and theft of services." The 1st 
two charges are felonies while the other two are misdemenor charges. All 
in all, over 24,000 disks were confiscated, as well as dozens of computer 
systems. This operation made arrests in early april on some hackers in 
the Legion of Doom <LOD> because the feds believed they posed a 
"frightening threat" to individuals and institutions. It was alleged that 
they were capable of disrupting 911 emergency phone service in at least 6 
states. <911 is a joke, btw.>
 Much of my information came from New York Newsday and other newspapers 
but we all know the press is hardly fair in its treatment of hackers and 
in reporting anything dealing with computers. I should subscribe to 2600 
and get the real truth, or at least attend one of their meetings. I think 
its funny how the feds go all out to bust hackers, but don't seem this 
agressive to do anything in our war against drugs, or to fight 
homelessness or to help improve education. Here's a quote from NY Newsday 
and assistant secret service director Garry M. Jenkins: "Today, the 
secret service is sending a clear message to those hackers who have 
decided to violate the law of this nation." According to various phone 
companies and other companies, the fraud perpetrated by some of the 
hackers who were busted <and other hackers not yet caught> cost them more 
than $50 million in telephone services.

More on Sun Devil
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
As I purchased the Sunday newspapers as I do every week, I rarely 
purchased the NY Times. However, I scanned the headlines and noticed this 
headline on page 1:
 
"Drive to Counter Computer Crime Aims at Invaders"
"Legitimate Users Voice Worries Over Rights"
 
I looked at it harder and promptly purchased the Times. With Sun Devil 
over, and certainly newer investigations into hacking activities, there 
are some questions that needed answers. Are these hackers really a threat 
to comerce, research and national security? Is the government violating 
these alleged hacker's civil rights or anyone's for that matter in their 
attempts to stop this "threat" to security?  Some civil liberties experts 
say that the crackdown on hackers is affecting computer users who are not 
breaking the law. These users are being intimidated and searched 
illegally and other violations of their civil liberties, such as the 
freedom of speech. It is parallel to the campaign against drugs, where 
minorities are always subject to questioning by police and youths 
assaulted by cops under the pretense the youths were arrested for drug 
usage. 
 
Stephen McNamee, the US Attorney for Arizona and a central figure in the 
government's efforts against computer crime, says "It's a whole new era. 
Computers are providing a new avenue for criminal activities. It is 
possible to transmit computer information for an illegal purpose in the 
blink of an eye." Fortunately, some people think the government is going 
too far, like a California Democrat named Don Edwards. He says "Every 
time there is a percieved crisis, law-enforcement agencies and 
legislators overreact, and usually due process and civil liberties 
suffer. The Fourth Amendment provides strict limits on rummaging through 
people's property."
 
A tradgedy of this operation, and an example of innocent people suffering 
from government actions is a computer game maker. he has not been 
charged, yet investigators have seized his equipment and have not 
returned it as of yet. He is on the verge of going out of business as a 
result. The secret service surreptitiously eavesdropped on BBS's and 
telephone conversation in weeks prior to Sun Devil and have entered these 
networks as legitimate users to trade information. The FBI interrogated 
dozens of experts and hobbyists in an investigation  of a theft of an 
important program from Apple Computer Inc. last year. (I don't recall 
what exactly it was, however, there was a protest of Apple's policy not 
permiting macintosh clones from being built, and could have been related. 
I also think this program was related to Macintosh's DOS or the windows 
or Icons it uses.> 
 
Civil libertarians and some business executives have begun to organize 
defenses. Mitchell D. Kapor, creator of Lotus 1-2-3, is planning a 
defense fund of several hundred thousand dollars for some of the accused 
in Operation Sun Devil. Harvey Silvergate, a Massachusetts lawyer and 
civil liberties expert working with mr. Kapor, said "You have innocent 
people who are being terrorized as well as investigations of people who 
have broken the law." He termed the government's actions as "typical 
American [and Chinease by the way] solution: throw your best and 
brightest in jail." 
 
Some officials of the secret service, which has been the primary federal 
enforcer of computer fraud laws since 1984, believe that an alarming 
number of bright, young computer enthusiasts are using computers 
illegally. "Often, a progression of criminal activity occurs which 
involves telecommunication fraud, unauthorized access to other computers, 
credit card fraud, and then moves on to other destructive activities like 
computer viruses." said gary M. jenkins, secret service assistant 
director.
 
Mr Kapor of Lotus said he believed the danger posed by the computer joy 
riders had been greatly exagerated. "Now that the Communists aren't our 
enemies anymore, the American psyche has to end up inventing new ones," 
he said. He and other experts are also alarmed by new investigative 
techniques that employ computers. The power of advanced machines 
multiplies the risk of search and seizure violations, these experts say, 
because they can perform so many simultaneous tasks and absorb and 
analyze so much information. Added to this problem is that legal 
precedents are not clear on how the 1st amendment protects speech and the 
4th amendment protects against searches and seizures in the electronic 
world. My question is, is saying how to hack out a system, or codes for 
examples illegal? Is my freedom of speech protected when I talk about how 
to hack out codez, or distribute them? Having a 10 digit number suddenly 
becomes illegal, and similar confusion exists. I thought using a code was 
illegal. Computer Email could be swept up in a raid that is totally 
unrelated to anything illegal, or at least to that investigation.
 
Updates on Sun Devil will come in future issues. If anyone has any 
information about "The Hacker's Conference" which meets somewhere on the 
west coast, please send correspondence to myself, Iys Kyewb on one of the 
Chaos BBS's.

The Truth to Caller ID (or Automatic Number Identification, ANI)
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Is it big brother when you call someone and they know your phone number 
before you can even say "hello"? I'm upset over the phone company's total 
apathy over my right to privacy. What if I hadan unlisted number? What is 
the purpose of unlisting your number when its readily avaiable to people 
you call or businesses? It's hard to convince the phone company when you 
call BBS's and don't necessarily want the sysop to know your phone 
number, if you're poor like me and have only 1 line. I can imagine any or 
all of you saying either "if you can't trust the sysop, don't call their 
system" or "I hate getting out of the shower to find out its a sales 
pitch" or whatever lame excuses. Just because I can't trust a sysop <who 
can you really trust these days?> doesn't mean the sysop runs a terrible 
BBS. Also, you need to get out of your shower or wake up or get away from 
relaxing just to see what the phone number is of the person calling you . 
And suppose its a call from your spouce or sibling or child and its from 
a public phone? Are you not going to pick it up because the phone number 
could be that of an organization? If you don't want to be bothered with 
the ringing of the phone, turn off the ringer or unplug the phone. Your 
right to privacy is not violated when someone calls your phone number. If 
you truly feel it is, then talk to the phone company about getting a line 
that cannot recieve calls, only make them. You could save some money and 
your misconception of privacy is not violated. Of course, no one could 
get through to you. Its like having a pager. Is getting a page a 
violation of your rights? if you don't want to be bothered, turn it off, 
ignore it or stop subscribing.
 
Now, there is the question of prank phone calls. ANI is a deterrent to 
it, but so is a less costly and more private alternative. Call Blocking 
and Call trace are 2 features that New Jersey Bell offers. Call blocking 
prevents someone from making a call to your phone number from a specific 
number. Example: joe from 555-1234 calls jane at 555-2345 to harass her. 
With call blocking, she dials a code and the number she wants to block 
<555-1234 in this case> and when joe calls, he gets a recording "This 
number is no longer accepting phone calls." Joe would then assume her 
phone is disconnected and obviously cannot prank her anymore. Of course 
he could always try from another phone and she can only block 6 phone 
numbers. But that is effective in reducing prank calls. Call trace is the 
kicker. Rather than waiting for months for the phone company to put a 
tracer on your line, dialing a simple code will initiate a trace of the 
last phone call made to that number. Example: joe calls jane from 
555-1234 100 times. jill calls jane from 555-1122 and tells her about 
call trace. joe calls back at, say 8 am. jane leaves, goes to work and 
comes home around 5pm. she has NOT recieved any phone calls. she presses 
a few digits on the phone and call trace is initiated. It is assumed this 
service will be used immediately after joe pranks her but that is not 
necessary. Lala Land bell then traces the call to 555-2345 and will do 
whatever they think is necessary to stop the calls, usually give the # to 
the local police or something of that sort. With call trace costing $1 
per trace and call block $6/month, its alot cheaper than ANI, costing at 
$60 for the lousy unit and $6/month. It would take 60 traces initiated to 
make up for the money lost in ANI which explains whi the companies hype 
ANI instead of call block or call trace. My recommendation would be to 
stop wasting money and take your phone # off the unlisted status because 
once a company finds your number and address <compiled in a database> 
they sell your addresses to other companies as a mailing list and you 
will still recieve those annoying calls with a sales pitch. I personally 
have never recieved one but I don't do much mail ordering myself.

Begining Lock Picking
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Ever get locked out of your room/house and wished you could get in 
because your keys were sitting on your desk? Or wanted to enter someone 
else's room to surprise them but you didn't have a key? Or just merely 
wanted to know how to pick locks? Well, this is a begining guide to 
lockpicking. I will make some recommendations. They are:
 
Do Not even try to pick Medeco locks unless you have ALOT of experience 
with lock picking. These locks are extremely hard to pick because of the 
way the lock is designed. Notice locksmiths charge more to duplicate them 
than other, normal keys? Well, take a look at one. If you look at the top 
of the notches, you will notice they are not all arranged in a straight 
line. They are curved. With the pick I will show how to build, I even 
doubt it is possible to pick this kind of lock. If it is possible, you'd 
have to spend hours trying to pick it, and that defeats the whole purpose 
of lockpicking.
 
The Pick I will show you does not work with Tubular locks, "skeleton key" 
locks or other types like the fitchet kind. It is for basic, 1 slot keys. 
Padlocks are good locks to try to pick with this.
 
First, you need to find a thin and somewhat long piece of metal that is 
somewhat stiff but pliable enough to shape. How long? Judgement tells you 
what length but if its really long, you can make 2 or even 3 tools. it 
should be at least 13 inches so you can make 2 such tools, a pick and 
torque bar. Now where do you find such a metal? Well, Oil Dipsticks, and 
Automatic Transmission dipsticks are usually good, but try to find one 
thinner and not so flexable. The best kind are from the brushes of the 
street sweepers. Ever see them clean the streets? The brushes are made of 
hundreds of metal strips that sweep debris from the gutter and supposedly 
into the machine I guess. These metal pieces break off and are very much 
suitable for this task. I think it is the easiest type of metal to use. 
Where do you find them? Well, a friend told me to check out the gutters 
where the machines sweep the streets. I checked out my neighborhood in 
the Bronx and looked on 1 block and found nothing so I figured I'd have 
to look elsewhere. However, when I was in Bayside, Queens recently, I 
decides to look and I found over 20!!! pieces of these brushes, some 
metal pieces were long enough to make 2 tools. I recommend looking nearby 
sanitation depots. You could also approach the sweeper and pry off some 
pieces but I don't know how hard that is.
 
Next, find a stone grinder. You can attach one to a drill but it works 
best if you have one mounted on a desk or something. Its alot like the 
ones used to sharpen axes or other such equipment. If you don't have one, 
check out the machine shops in your school, or in colleges. Ask other 
students where any machine shops exist and you should be able to find a 
grind stone. I don't recommend asking everyone, just some students who 
are into such things.
 
Now, after fou have found a metal piece or two and a grinder, you're 
ready to build a lock pick or torque bar, or Ideally both. The torque bar 
is easy. Take a pair of pliars or similar instrument, grip the metal 
strip and bend it until its bent into a 90 degree angle. It should look 
like an L when looked at from the side. Do not twist it, unless you have 
alot of metal strips, or many torque bars, since that can do different 
things and make it easier or harder to pick some locks. For a basic set, 
i don't recommend that. The torque bar should be about 7 inches in length 
and the little "stub" of the L part should be no more than 1/2 an inch. 
Now you need a pick. You need the grinder to shape the metal strip into 
something like this shape:
                           -----------------------------
  /\      <---A--->       /                            |
 /  \--------------------/                             |
c------------------------------------------------------|
 
for you commodore users, \ is a diagonal opposite of / <an X without "/">
and | is a straight, verticle line
 
The front should be rounded <the "c" part> and the part labeled "A" 
should be somewhat long but no longer than 1/3 the size of the whole 
stick. The edges should be somewhat smooth but not necessarily perfectly 
round. Also, make the narrower part narrow, but not too narrow, as that 
makes the pick brittle, and your pick will break inside of the lock, 
which will fuck shit up. For locks that have longer keys, the part 
labeled <---A---> should be longer but for regular locks, that isn't 
necessary. Torque bars should be long enough to maximize torque but not 
too long since it becomes brittle. 
 
After making the above tool, you can paint it, put rustoleum on it or 
whatever. Since it is steel, it can rust but as long as it isn't brittle, 
thats ok. If you find a rusted strip, you can cand off the rust if you 
wish, but thats personal taste. As long as <repeated for the last time> 
it isn't brittle, anything is ok. Just don't twist or bend it, since it 
needs to be very straight! Bending any of it is not a good idea for an 
inexperienced lock picker. 
 
So where do you start? Simple things like padlocks or the locks to your 
disk storage things <the 1st thing I picked and it took 15 seconds> or 
similar things. How is picking done? Well, the pick enters the lock and 
the bar is used to twist the cylinder much like when you twist your key 
through the lock. Fiddle with the pick enough and you'll figgure out how 
to open locks up. Some locks may take up to half an hour for even 
experienced lock pickers, <again regular locks, not Medecos> but do the 
easy, non-trouble getting into stuff 1st. And most of all, amaze your 
friends by entering their lockers and stealing jackets, walkmen, etc.! 
Steal next weeks mid term! Break into payphones! Enter an office and 
steal equipment!!! heh, I'm getting abit carried away here but with these 
two tools, you are on the road to becoming an expert lock picker. Also, I 
recommend getting an L-slide or 2. An L slide is an L shaped piece of 
metal <usually> that enables you to open doors that are usually double 
doors. Some doors have "card" blocks and those blocks usually prevent 
these doors from being L-Slided, but I can't say for sure. Having 
L-slides of different sizes is a tremendous advantage since some bolts 
are not easily gotten to easily. Some doors are "blocked" from the front 
and with a long L-slide, you can slip it through anyway. Notice the way 
that door bolt on every door with a knob is sloped on one side, usually 
away from you but sloped towards you? Well you need to pull the slide 
onto that so the door can open. Unfortunately, many doors have a blocker 
that, ugh its hard to explain. I need better graphics than ASCII to show 
you. Maybe next time I talk about lock picking I can explain further.
 
 
Disclaimer- the above was written for general purposes and was not 
intended for illegal purposes. Remember, picking a lock to enter a room 
without the room's occupant knowledge is Breaking and Entering and is a 
felony. The author of this text or file, members of Chaos and owner of 
the BBS this file is on is not responsible for any actions of anyone 
diretly resulting from this file, nor are we responsible for anyone's 
getting caught.

General BBS News
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Well, This is a review of news in the NYC BBS world since aproximately 
May 1st, 1990. There is no guarantee the information occured before or 
after that date, but I'm telling you what I know. I can guarantee that 
the information is acurrate and true.
 
Shadoworld went Public Domain, as Sun Devil hit the nation. E><el 
apparantly decided it was too risky to maintain a pirate BBS with such 
taking place, and considering he used to have a h/p sub <which the Sage 
copied onto his BBS but took it 1 step further by having a h/p UD area> 
it WAS indeed risky to have anything illegal, in case a hacker that used 
to call SW got busted and the feds called shadoworld to see if they were 
involved in hacking or phreaking. Unfortunately, Shadoworld is down, 
because of the phone bill. Its down indefinately but I expect it to be up 
soon. 
 
The Shelter went down for good. No news on whether or not the technician 
will put it up again or put up a new system or whatever. It was the 1st 
multiplexing commodore BBS in New York City. Not a bad BBS in my opinion.
 
Camelot left RAID and Mysticore's Rhadmanthus decided not to join. This 
wasn't a blow to RAID as they did grow to 4 canadian BBS's and several 
more out of state BBS's.
 
Boot Camp BBS went Image 1.2 and added Turbo Rels, which made this once 
slow BBS into a superfast system. Calling it at 2400 is like calling a 
Cnet 128 V4.0 at 2400, or very close in speed. 
 
Harry Hazardous, hitman of RAID, has decided to go legit and stop hacking 
and phreaking. I don't know if he left RAID or is merely no longer Hitman 
for RAID. I do know he changed his handle, to something that I forgot and 
was told not to reveal, which I do not plan to.
 
Nynex Ninja returned early this year but it was revealed he was actually 
Renegade hacker, who claimed to me in Email that he had joined BTI but 
then changed his mind about joining, or something as ridiculous as that. 
in addition, Jimmy <Nynex Ninja> gave him permission to do all of that, 
for what reason I don't know. There is a Nynex Ninja in NEC but it is 
unknown if it is the same one of BTI fame.
 
And speaking of NEC, NEI has cropped up, NEI standing for North East 
Importers. It appears NEI will take over where NEC left since many NEI 
members are in NEC, and I saw a realease with NEI on it but not NEC. 
 
NASA, another graphics group, has grown somewhat in New York and 
nationwide. It is unknown how many BBS's are actually NASA bbs's since 
the number was "Inflated" E><el, leader of RAID, tells me. I do know 
Commodore Conextions is a NASA bbs, and I saw the word NASA on a graphic 
done on an out of state BBS I once called.
 
Paradise warez was down. Rumors flew around that Renegade Hacker 
disconnected his phone in the latest "skirmish" in their loooooooooooong 
laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaame "war". However, PK's mother disconnected it for 
unknown reasons, possibly over the phone bill or he was merely grounded 
for something lame. There are rumors that it is back up as of 6/7/90 but 
at a different number. I tried his number and it was busy. I assume it is 
back up at (212)/888-4773. 
 
In addition to getting 1.2, many image BBS's are now getting Networking, 
something that allows for posts to be shared among numerous BBS's. 
Unfortunately, Terrordome and Boot Camp plan on only networking with each 
other and Shadoworld, which is redundent since all of them have 
essentially the same users and are in the same city. I called Gear 
Jammers ][ in Philly (215)/487-0463 and saw their Network and it looked 
awesome. They were networked with many BBS's all over the country and I'd 
like to see Boot Camp network with a BBS like that, or a BBS on that 
network.
 
The Sage's Hut, that bastion of new UD's, Posts and kewl cosysops was 
supposedly down as of 6/6/90 but appeared to be up and running the next 
day! More on this story next time.
 
As if that wasn't enough, Johnny and The Sage's Hut was booted out of 
RAID. Johnny was left in charge of allowing new users to join RAID but he 
got too big of a head and was saying shit that pissed off Incubus, so 
Incubus booted him! Hopefully, more in the Combat mag on this topic.
 
Look for T00n T0wn, a new BBS in the 718 area code. Bebop was posting 
this. I don't know if he's the sysop but i know it will be:
2400
20+megs
And either Image 1.2 or Cnet 4.0
 
Mystiore initiated a "No Groups in Signature" rule on their BBS and, 
personally, i think it sucks. This is a foolish and annoying move. There 
is no purpose in this at all. He feels it is annoying to see:
 
<handle>/group1/group2/group3/group4/etc...
 
yet does nothing about the people who use MCI in non MCI subs and uses 
commands like \s9 or \p4 or \w8 or any of the variable commands. <for 
those not familiar with MCI, \p# is a printing mode, allowing you to 
print a character and then do something like move to the end of the line 
and come back to type the next character, or something lame like that; 
\s# is the # of tenths of a second the computer waits before printing the 
next character. It is very annoying since 2400 can look suddenly like 110 
baud; and \wn tells the computer to wait # seconds before doing anything 
<usually printing the next character> and is very annoying. The variable 
commands print the user's handle, name, phone number, password or other 
things and can confuse many people.>

<bewtween us, we have about 10 years experience compared to Demoniac's 2 
or 3, and none of the other Chaos members have more than 2 other than 
maybe Exploited> As a result, HiFi disbanded with Great Golem somewhere 
and Crusader on the Sage's hut. Crusader, if you're reading this: We did 
HiFi to do something but I did everything and you did nothing. My not 
being near a computer does not and should not prevent you from doing 
anything for the group such as getting us a HiFi BBS or something to that 
effect. Considering you are cosysop on at least 2 BBS's, thats really 
lame. Comwood was in the group for a shorter period of time, yet he wrote 
a terrormag and compiled codes for magic candle with Dr. Who. 
 
Chris has been discovered to use many handles, among them Chris, 
Bumrusha/er, Scope and now, Abadox. Many sysops are tired with our war 
with him, and I can't really blame them but they have been reacting a bit 
too harsh, deleting people for mentioning chris, for example. I say we 
leave him alone after the next combat mag.
 
More news available in the Combat! mag.

BBS reviews

Sage's Hut
(212)/928-2406
3/12/2400
image 1.2
20+ megs
 
The BBS used to be good but Johnny (Sage) deleted Demoniac. Since then, 
the BBS slid downhill but survived, until a galacticomm went up called 
"Advacomm" and Johnny called it every day. While calling it, the BBS 
number was busy, but noone posted, sub obs and UD-ops couldn't do their 
work, like validate warez, and cosysops couldn't do anything. The BBS got 
lame and now when you call, you see dozens of unvalidated wares and maybe 
10 new posts/responses on the whole subboard area. 
 
On a 1-10 rating, used to be 8.3 but now a dismal 2.3. Only reason why I 
call is because I have unlimited credits.
 
 
Defcon 3
(718)/984-2273
3/1200
Chaos!! HQ#4
DMBBS
 
I haven't really called this BBS much, its gotten lukewarm reviews. The 
posts appear to be okay. The speed is good for a DMBBS but kingsx should 
go Cbase instead.
 
On a 1-10 rating it gets a 4.6 but only because I made 1 call to it and 
wasn't terribly impressed by what I saw. However, since it IS a chaos 
BBS, it can't be that bad. If I like what I see, I will raise the rating 
in the next issue of Anarchy!
 
 
Mysticore
(718)/837-4710
3/12/2400
Cnet 4.0
20+megs
 
The sysop is getting annoying. Once a good bbs, its gotten bogged down by 
some wierd rules. He wants us all to be a "family" yet bans group names 
in user's sigs. Dr. Who said he thought Black Magic was bullshit and was 
told not to post anymore on Mysticore, to shut up and a few other things. 
I assume Demoniac will go into this in more depth in the Combat mag. 
 
Once a 8.6, now its a 5.4 and rapidly declining.
 
 
Boot Camp
(718)/464-8189
3/12/2400
Image 1.2 with TurboRels!!!!
105 megs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Chaos HQ#2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
Once a dreadfully slow BBS, now with the turbo RELS and the CMD drive 
hooked up in an unknown way, this Image is almost as fast as a Cnet 4.0 
in 2400. The subs have improved. The UD's get an INC since I didn't see 
them but there is alot of space to upload and I guess the UDs are good.
With an Empire contest <and Empire "wall" and MP command> the BBS is 
eternally busy! Very hard to get through!
 
One a 5.3, now a 9.1 rating
 
 
Terrordome
(718)/984-2273

Image 1.2
Chaos HQ#3
20+ Megs
 
Was named Elm street and used 1.0 Image, dreadfully slow then. Now its 
quicker but could use those neat turboRels to speed things up a notch. 
1.2 was a significant change, as was "Terrordome" from Elm Street BBS. 
The subs are ok but the Chaos sub is forever getting posts! Dudes! Post 
in the Boot Camp when you get through!
 
Once a dismal 3.5, now a 9.0
 
Thats all for now. Here are some BBS's to try out. I'll review them next 
issue:
Gear Jammer's ][ (215)/487-0463
Lahnkmar's       (609)/858-2033 or 2003, i have to correct this
Just Say Yes     (415(/922-2008

Networking
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Networking is the hottest thing around but this isn't so much about the 
aspects of networking but merely a request for:
 
docs of networking on Cnets and Images
a listing of the networking BBS's and names of networks, especially how 
to join the networks.
 
Please send correspondence to Iys Kyewb on either:
Lahnkmar BBS <number above>
GearJammers ][ <see above>
Boot Camp
Terrordome
 
Thank you.

The Consience of a Hacker
Entered by Iys Kyewb
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
I found this in Phrack inc. volume one, issue 7. Phile 3 of 10. Its cool, 
I should mail it to Dear Abby/Ann, heheh.
 
 
      The following was written shortly after my arrest. I am currently 
groupless, having resigned from the Racketeers, so ignore the signoff...
 
 
The Consience of a Hacker... by The Mentor 1/8/86
 
 
      Another one got caught today, it's all over the papers. "Teenager 
Arrested in Computer Crime Scandal", "Hacker Arrested after Bank 
Tampering"...
 
      Damn kids. They're all alike.
 
      But did you, in your three-piece psychology and 1950's technobrain, 
ever take a look behind the eyes of the hacker? Did you ever wonder what 
made him tick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded him?
 
      I am a hacker, enter my world...
 
      Mine is a world that begins with school... I'm smarter than most of 
the other kids, this crap they teach us bores me...
 
      Damn underachiever. they're all alike.
 
      I'm a junior in High School. I've listened to teachers explain for 
the 15th time how to reduce a fraction. I understand it. "No Ms. Smith, I 
didn't show my work. I did it in my head..."
 
      Damn kid. Probably copied it. They're all alike.
 
      I made a discovery today. I found a computer. Wait a second, this 
is cool. It does what I want it to. If it makes a mistake, it's because I 
screwed it up. Not because it doesn't like me...
 
      Or feels threatened by me...
 
      Or thinks I'm a smart ass...
 
      Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here...
 
      Damn kid. All he does is play games. They're all alike.
 
      And then it happened... A door opened to a world... rushing through 
the phone line like heroin through an addict's veins, an electronic pulse 
is sent out, a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is sought... A 
board is found.
 
      "This is it... This is where I belong..."
 
      I know everyone here... even if I've never met them, never talked 
to them, may never hear from them again... I know them all...
 
      Damn kid. Tying up the phone line again. They're all alike...
 
      You bet you're ass we're all alike... We've been spoon-fed baby 
food when we hungered for steak... the bits of meat that you did let slip 
through were pre-chewed and tasteless. We've been dominated by sadists, 
or ignored by the apathetic. The few that had something to teach found us 
willing pupils, but those are like drops of water in the desert.
 
      This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, 
the beauty of the baud. We make use of a service already existing without 
paying for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering 
gluttons, and you call us criminals. We explore... and you call us 
criminals. We seek after knowledge... and you call us criminals. We exist 
without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias... and 
you call us criminals. You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, 
cheat, and lie to use and try to make us believe it's for our own good,
