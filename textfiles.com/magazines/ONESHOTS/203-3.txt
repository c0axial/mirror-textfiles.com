Article I : FYBITE - Fuck you buddy, I'M THE EDITOR!
Replies to notes by Scoop, dates not important
**********************************************
   That 203-2 sucked soooooo bad.
- SHS
   I almost care.
- Scoop

   So what do you think about writing.  I willing to contribute, but I don't
enjoy your style of knocking Joe Lieberman without the facts.  IMHO, I never
present an argument without proof which you did in 203-1.  Maybe you're
right, but hey, I'm didn't read 203 to hear opinionated editorials.  Maybe
for your next issue, you could make you opinions a little more subtle. 
- Joco
   My proof was not only verified by Lieberman's own TV ads which state "He
(Lieberman) fought for removing violence in video games to protect our
children" <which parents already censor from their kids who are too young>,
and on a C-SPAN hearing regarding the entire issue. I understand your concern
for the truth and slanted opinion in TLS articles. I try my best to research
a topic before writing about it - and this is one thing I do not write about
without facts. As for the tone I write with - you don't have to agree with
it; it's your prerogative.
   Thanks for the offer to write. Pick whatever you like and I'll try to 
accomodate you.

Article II : Mortal Kombat III and Doom II - Sequels v. U.S. Senate
Written by Scoop on 10/22/94, contributions from Electronic Gaming Monthly
**************************************************************************
     News from the pages of EGM shows that two of the current hot games, 
Doom and Mortal Kombat II, have sequels either in production or already here.
It seems that ID and Midway don't acknowledge our government's attempt to
censor the top source of entertainment for the younger generation.
     By now we all know that ID Software has released the second installment
to the goriest game in history, DOOM II. This version, outside of shareware
and warez versions, is available commercially in many stores. This release
came on the heels of Sega succumbing to the official government ratings
system, which will be first applied on their Genesis 32X translation of the
original DOOM!. According to EGM, the game will carry a rating of M or
"Mature gamers 17 and up", and retailers of the game will enforce this when
a sale is made. Price for the Sega version has not been released yet, but
expect it to be almost $100.
     Word from Midway Electronics points to Mortal Kombat III, yet another in
the line of popular blood-gushers. A report in EGM shows this version to be
a Double Dragon-type game, unlike the first two which were one-on-one fights.
Some people claim that the game is already out and about, but unfortunately
no release date was mentioned.
     No word from Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D-CT) as of yet on this recent
information, but TLS will keep you posted.

Article III : Doom/Doom2 at 14.4; Hamden H.S. Cafe
Written by Dark Death on 10/21/94
*********************************
     Are you sick of those stupid utils that claim to let you go at full
speed but instead stop at 9600? Well here are a few suggestions that might
work. 
     Both Dooms should have a MODEM.CFG file. If you haven't already, edit
it and change baud speeds to something higher (DUH dumb ass). Try 14400 but
most modems don't use 14400 since it isn't in the multiples (19200 works for
me). That probably won't change much. This should work on all modems using
the Hayes command set. There should be a part of the init that says S37=###
(### being some number). If that's there then your modem speed in Doom will
not change. (Mine says S37=11 chances but look in your modem manual to be
sure). Set the baud rate to 19200; that should do it if all else fails.
     Find me if you need more help or someone to play modem Doom II with. For
Doom I players, if you want something other than the setup program for stuff,
find the Doom masters program. It's real good. Also for Doom II guys, if you
didn't read the README file, to make the game more of a challenge, use the
-FAST command. It makes the game go 300% faster! Imps shoot rapid fire,
demons and spectors are alot more lethal, cyber demons, well...

     In other news, myself and other investigative reporters recently
launched an investigation into what the mysterious mystery meat on top of the
living nachos at Hamden High are. What we found is a pile of some reddish
lumpy stuff and a live horse : half in a wood chipper, and half... well...
probably in the bucket. Also expect the price of soda cans to go up to 10
dollars by the time you graduate.
