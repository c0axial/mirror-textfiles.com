*****************************************************************************

	Welcome to the inaugural issue of Rage, an E-zine created and run by
me, Cronie.  You're probably thinking "Oh boy, another fly-by-night, 
so-called 'Underground' E-zine written by some high school kid that lives 
with his parents."  Well you may be right, you may be wrong, only time will
tell, but I'll try push this mag out as long as I have stuff to print.  That
means that I'll only be writing one article per issue until I get writers,
or else this zine won't last past issue 2.


	Rules of submissions:
	1. Submissions must be informative and/or entertaining
	2. Please don't send personal/business phone numbers, addresses, 
		etc... with the sole intent for other people to harass them.
		I'm into harassment as much as the next guy but I'm not going
		to use this mag to do your dirty work for you.  Interesting
		Internet sites, phone numbers and addresses are fine, though.
	3. Send your submissions to cronie@hotmail.com

*****************************************************************************


	In this day and age, all hackers and phreaks are severely agitated by
CallerID as it forces them to dial '*67' every time they need to make a call.
However, a bright idea popped into my head this morning while I was looking
over the previous night's scans: why not use CallerID to my advantage and use
it like a CNA?

	I'm sure that someone somewhere has tried this before but I've never 
read a file on it or heard of it being done, so I figured why not type this 
up?  This takes no technical knowledge, your success will depend on how well
you can BS and the gullibility of your target.

	What you will need:
		CallerID service (duh)
		CallerID display unit (duh)
		Your target's name and mailing address
	Optional:
		Second phone line 
		answering machine

	Now is where your BS skill comes into play: you must somehow get your
target to call you.  One way would be to just ask him to call you but you're
probably not on friendly terms with your target so my plan would be to forge
a letter from some official sounding organization.  For example, you could
send a letter saying to call your number and claim a prize of some sort, but
this could arouse suspicion as people today are wary of the various 
mail/phone scams out there, and your target may just discard your letter or
start harassing you, calling you up constantly asking where the Hell his 
prize is.  In this case your plan will have completely backfired.  I would
suggest forging a letter from none other than the local phone company itself.
Now, the more detailed and aware you are, the better your chance of success.

	The following is a skeleton letter I just thought up to get you 
started.

For example:

	<Address of your 
	 phone service 
	 provider here>

					<Target's 
					 address
					 here>

Dear Customer:
	We are experiencing problems with excess noise on subscriber lines 
servicing your area which may have been caused by a recent system upgrade.  
Please dial <your # here> and listen for three distinct tones.  Dial this 
number direct, without using a calling card or any star codes as these may
disrupt the test.  If you do NOT hear three tones after ten seconds then dial 
'9' (touch tone or pulse) and leave a message requesting service to your 
line, you will not be charged extra for requesting this service.  We 
apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

					<Some signature
					 of a higher up.>

	This letter is meant only for a template, if you can think of 
something better then by all means, use your idea.  Remember, the more 
official you can make it look, the better, so don't write this up in ink and
hand print the address on the envelope.

	Now if you use the above example then you will want to set up an 
answering machine with "three distinct tones."  Generate them with your 
computer, a tone dialer, whatever, just make sure that they are loud and 
clear.  I would suggest you use a second line to do this (such as your data 
line, just stay off the modem for a few days) in case your primary line gets 
tied up with telemarketers, relatives, etc...

	With a little luck, your target will call your number and discard the
letter.  Now I'm not saying that this is risk free.  Your target may get 
suspicious and do some further investigating, which is something that you 
don't want to happen, so don't try this on paranoid types like you and I.
This is another reason to use a line dedicated for your modem:  If he ever
calls again then he will just get a constant ring or busy if you're online.

	Another idea is to give the number of a friend that has callerID 
that you always hang out with.  Just drop by his house peruse his callerID 
history, (DO NOT lead on that you know anything about a guy calling for some 
test number.)
	
	Good luck!
