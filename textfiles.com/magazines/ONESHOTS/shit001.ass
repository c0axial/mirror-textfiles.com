                        How To Buy Weed

    To begin buying weed is a complicated process, but needs to be 
learned by everyone planning on, and who does smoke pot.  Imagine, 
what if you had to move suddenly.  You would have to start all over 
again, getting contacts and shit!  Anyhoot.  Ok, the first thing you 
need to do, is have a rep, or LOOK like you have a rep.  If you're a 
prep, dork, fag...whatever, no one will sell to you.  So, get some 
irritated eyes, push people around, get suspended a couple of 
times.  Ok, second of all, you need to know terms, prices, and where 
and who to go to.

                        Terms

Dime - However much weed you can get for $10.  Depends on quality, 
where you live, who you get from etc...At least try to get two 
joints worth.

Doobage, Green, Pine, Mary Jane, Shit, Cabby, Indo, Chronic, etc - All 
terms for weed.

Eigth - 1/8th of an ounce.  Should cost $20-$25 on average, less for 
shit weed, more for the bomb..:)

Quarter - Quarter bag.  Should cost no more than $45-$50.

Joint, J - A marijuana cigarette, the most common way of ingesting 
the kind herb.

Bong - A device for smoking marijuana, usually filled with water, to 
filter out some carcinogenic substances in the smoke.

Bowl, Pipe - A simple pipe-like device with a screen, to smoke 
marijuana in.

Pocus - Bad weed.

Da Bomb - Good weed.

                        Who To Look For

    Look around when ye'r in suspension.  Look for people who 
look/smell/talk like they smoke weed.  Try to start talking to 
them.  As long as you don't look like you'd narc, they'd probably 
sell to you.  The key is to talk like you know what you're talking 
about.  Anyways, that's about it.  Now, you're on your own.

               How To Get Porno Gifs (Or, Porn For Kids)

    Ok, getting those porno files is fairly easy.  All you have to 
do is get a Credit Card Number Generation Program (call BSi), a 
computer with a monitor and gif viewer, modem, and the cashola to 
pay the phone bill.
    First, invest in a 14.4.  It will save alot of YOUR money, and 
waste more of THEIRS!  Next, generate a list of CC Numbers.  Keep 
this handy.  Next, get an issue of PC Magazine or something similar, 
and look up the BBS section.  Some BBS's that I suggest are Lace 
(818-709-4275, VERY high quality pix, but BIG, and axess gets lost 
QUICK), Event Horizons (1-800-466-6336, VERY high quality pix, VGA 
movies w/ sound, 800 NUMBER!, axess HARD to get <Have to call VOICE> 
and gets lost QUICK), Fantasia (714-579-7022, poor quality pix, but 
if you fake a girls name, you get free axess, and the accts last 
LONG).  All these BBS's have high speed modems, so...
    Anyhow, now, all you need to do, is log on as NEW, put in a 
bunch of not TOO fake shit (don't make it obvious that the info is 
false), and put in a cc number, and make up a exp date (All this 
shit can be made up, since MOST don't check up on this).  Now, you 
have FREE axess to PAY boards.  Neet, huh?
    P.S.  This also works for Internet Services, such as Delphi, and 
Bix.  However, I think that I personally hacked so many accts on 
there, that the only way I can get the accts validated now is by 
calling the 800 number to sign up (ANI, ouch..), but, it works.

                            Shitty Shirts!

    Pretty soon, we're going to get some SHiTTY SHiRTS printed up, 
available exclusively to our readers/distributors.  The graphix on 
the front will most likely be drawn by a commercial artist friend of 
mine, and the concept will be similar to this.  A hick on the front, 
shoveling some shit, with the BSi Logo on the Left Chest, and on the 
back, big font "I Shovel Shit, And I'm Proud", for distributors, and 
a little kid, playing in a pile of shit, BSi Logo on the front, and 
on the back, big font "I Play With Shit, And I'm Proud."  Of course, 
a list of all distribution sites w/ numbers & sysops will be 
included on the back of these shirts.  They will cost somewhere 
between $10-$15.  Anyone who may be interested in these, please 
leave me mail on BSi, or see me sometime on IRC, I hang out in 
#hack, #phreak, #2600, and on occasion #warez, just for the laughs.  
I'm usually on weekends, between 1-4 am.  Anyhow, I won't be 
skimming any money off the tops of these shirts, so whatever the 
printer charges, that will be your price!  SHiT, DiRT CHEAP!
