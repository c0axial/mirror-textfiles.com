This is a variation we designed from the bomb outlined in Phrack Inc., Vol. 1,
Issue 3, phile 3 0f 10.  It is simpler, easier to make, causes more damage, and
works better because the older design had a tendency not to work all the time
because it would not always hit the ground primer first.  This sort of bomb
is well suited to attacking/defending against large groups, or just for creating
a big bang and general havoc.  In order to throw to together this fun little toy,
you will need the following wacky items:

1>shotgun shell(s)  (12 gauge if at all possible)
2>surveyor's tape   (if you don't know what it is, just ask at your hardware
                     and they'll get it for you)
3>duct tape
4>cork              (preferably from that wine bottle you just finished off)
5>thin nail(s) about 3/4" long, with head

First, cut a length of about 2' of surveyors tape.  Tape the two ends to the
non-primer end (the end without the metal) so that you have a loop of ribbon.
This acts as a semi-parachute that doesn't slow the shell down, but it aligns
the shell so that it hits primer first.

Second, cut a cylinder of cork about 1/2 an inch thick and put the nail through
the center of it.  Make sure that the nail is not too loose as to fall out, but
not too tight.  You should be able to slide the nail in and out with your hand.
Now, glue the cork with nail onto the primer (end with the metal) so that if
you were to hit the nail hard, it would hit the primer of the shell like the
firing pin of a gun.  Once you have this on, be very careful, and do NOT drop
it.

To throw, hold by the shell (NOT by the surveyor's tape) and throw high and
hard.  We highly recommend that you duck behind some sort of barrier.  A sheet
of 3/4" plywood to duck behind works very well.

Comments:
During the hours of late night bomb testing at mnop's house, we found that the
less tape that you put on the body of the bomb, the better the explosion is.  We
have also contemplated the merits of throwing them at high speeds from a car
window at other cars that we do not find satisfactory.  Another option is to
saw about a quarter inch off the non-primer end and empty out all the bb's out
and omit the surveyor's tape.  Then walk up to somebody and throw it hard, like
a dart, at their feet and watch them piss in their pants.  Now, go out and
have fun, but don't blow your hands off, okay?

        Materials:
                1. box or two of wooden "strike anywhere matches" (the kind
                        with the white phosphorous tip)
                2. tennis ball
                3. a heavy ball bearing (about the size of a marble, you can
                        pick one up at your local hardware store)
                4. paraffin (also available at your hardware store)


        This is a great low budget pyrotechnic device, guaranteed to make a
great blast.  It's easy to get your hands on the material, and simple to make.
        First, take the tennis ball and cut a piece about the size of silver
dollar out of the top. Save this piece!
        Second, fill the tennis ball "shell" about half way up with match heads
that you cut off of the 'strike anywhere' matches.  Set the ball bearing in the
center.  Fill the tennis ball the rest of the way up with more match heads.
        Get as many match heads as you can fit in the tennis ball, and then
take the piece you cut out of the tennis ball and seal it back in place with
the paraffin.  You should put enough match heads in so that it is tight and
everything isn't rolling around inside.  DON'T SHAKE IT!

        To use, either drop it off of an elevated place or throw it.  For best
results, try and get it to land on a fairly hard surface.  If you decide to
throw it, remember to accelerate your arm SLOWLY to avoid it detonating in your
hand.  When it lands, the heavy ball bearing smashes through the match heads,
and they all ignite at once, making a great explosion, so make sure your grenade
is tightly packed with match heads.


Comments:  Filling the tennis ball with the match heads is a slow and tedious
           process, but do not be tempted, when you are halfway done, to drop a
           lit match in to see what happens.  A friend of mine tried this, and
           spent several weeks with his right hand completely bandaged.  Also,
           make this OUTSIDE!

        This simple design that was thought up one day when some of my friends
(mnop and his brother) and I were devising some good, easily concealed weapons.
This one is great and is guaranteed to smash anyone's skull, and is perfect for
any type of fight, as long as the other person doesn't have a gun or something.
Remember, only use this weapon if you are planning on REALLY hurting the person,
'cause it will do serious damage.  It does about the same amount of a damage
as a baseball bat, but it is easier to handle and use, and it is much more
inconspicuous.

Okay, here's what you need:

        1. the biggest pool stick that you can get (you should be able to pick
           one up pretty cheap at Wal-Mart).  If you can't get a pool stick, you
           can use a broom stick, but it won't be as good...
        2. some lead pellets, you know, the kind that some bb-guns use?  (also
           available at your friendly Wal-Mart outlet)
        3. an metal cup, large spoon, or even better, a ladle with a spout.
        4. a good heating element
        5. a drill with the longest drill bit that you can find.  Use about a
           1/4" drill bit, a little bigger if you want, but no smaller.
        6. plastic wood (comes in a tube, at hardware stores, just ask for it
           and they'll know what you are talking about)

        Alright, first, take the pool cue and cut off the thick end so that you
have a tapering club about the length from your armpit to your wrist, or a
little shorter (this is so you can carry under your arm, alongside your body
without attracting too much attention).  Now you should have a nice club that is
heavily weighted on one end (the thick end).
        Next drill a hole into the thick end of the pool stick.  Do it carefully
and slowly to avoid cracking the stick.  The deeper it is the better (you'll see
why in a minute).  Try and drill the hole like this:


                      make the hole wider
                  at the top so it easier to
                      pore the lead in
                           |
                           |
                         _   _
                        | \ / |
 cross section          | | | |
 of thick end -->       | | | |
 of pool stick          | | | |
                        | |_| |
                        |     |
                        |     |
                        |     |
                        |     |


        Now, put a couple of lead pellets in the ladle (or whatever you are
using) and heat it up until the pellets are completely liquefied.  Do this
outside if at all possible because it makes an awful stench.  We used a
blow torch to heat it up, but you could make a fire in a barbecue grill or
something.  Now once you have it completely melted CAREFULLY pour it into the
hole you drilled in the pool stick.  DO NOT HOLD THE POOL STICK IN YOUR HANDS
WHEN YOU DOING THIS!  Just stick the thin end in the ground or prop it up some
how.  Continue melting and pouring in lead into the hole until it is filled to
about half an inch from the top.  At this point just let it cool for an hour or
so.  When it is completely cooled, scrape away the thin layer of burnt wood, and
fill in the last half inch of the hole with plastic wood.  This is necessary
because the lead will usally come loose and slide out of the hole.

Now that you have it, go test drive it on the head of your choice....

        Materials:
                1. few wooden matches (the bigger the better)
                2. few small safety pins (preferably very sharp)
                3. wire cutter
                4. pliers
                5. vise (optional)
                6. sheet of notebook paper
                7. glue (elmer's or wood glue works best)
                8. a sharp razor or x-acto knife
                
        This little dart is loads of phun!  It is stable and strong enough to
be thrown accurately from up to 15 or 20 feet with a little practice and still
stick in a wall! (or a person for that matter!)

Here's what you do:

        First, take one of the safety pins, and cut as much of the sharp needle
part as you can with the wire cutters.  You should now have a very sharp little
needle.
        Second, take a match and cut the chemical part off that you light.
Secure the match in some fashion (like a vise), and, using the pliers, push the
needle into the end of the match (blunt end first, so that the sharp end is
sticking out).  This takes patience and a few tries before you can get the pin
in without splitting the match in two, so keep trying.  Next, rub wood glue in
around that end of the match to strengthen the wood.
It should look something like this:


           [||||||||||||||||||||||||]---------
                        /\                   /\
                       match               needle, sharp end facing out



        Third, take the match out of the vise, turn it over, and put it back
in the vise so that the other end of the match is sticking up.  Carefully make
a quarter inch long cut with the x-acto knife into the other side of the match
(as if you were going to cut the match in half lengthwise).
        Fourth, cut two 1" by 1/4" pieces of paper from the notebook paper, and
slide these into the slit you made.  Bend the sheets apart and put a drop of
glue in the slit.  Pinch it together until dry.
Here, maybe this will help:

                 ____

side view:      ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||---------
                |    |
                |____|


here, if you can figure this out, this is looking at the END of the match:


                  \     /                 11 represents the match
                    \ /

                 /      \

That's it!  And remember what Mommy said..."Don't go and poke your eye out."

                           The Tried And True
                         Home Production Method
                                  For
                          Bootleg Black Powder
                          In Three Easy Steps
                                  By:

This is cheaper to make than to buy at the store and may help you out if
the store won't sell it to you. THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS! Please don't
work around open flame (!), be careful, and this takes a long time if
you are making a large batch.

Bootleg Black Powder
75% Sodium Nitrate (Saltpeter)
15% Charcoal
10% Sulfur
Water (or urine)

Sodium Nitrate can be found in most high school chemistry labs. You can
also get it from a chemical supply house. If all else fails, dig around
a graveyard. The white crystals found around the graves is sodium
nitrate.

Charcoal can be gotten at any store that sells fish tank supplies. Look
for the charcoal that's used in the filters. If you want to make it, use
SOFTwood (pine, willow, redwood) as opposed to HARDwood (oak, maple). It
makes less ash. Seal the wood chips in a metal can with a tiny hole in
the top (to vent the smoke). Light a fire under the can and when smoke
stops coming out of the hole, rake the fire from under the can, plug the
vent, and let it set over night.

Sulfur can be found in schools, supply houses, or probably in a drug
store. You can get this stuff in a chemistry set.

Step 1: Powder all the ingredients SEPARATELY! A mortar and pestle works
best but if you don't have one, improvise. Only use wood (preferred) or
glass. Metal and other surfaces (like two rocks) may cause the sodium
nitrate to blow up.

Step 2: Mix all of the finally powdered ingredients together in a bowl of
some sort and add a little water till you get a biscuit dough type mix.
(Note: If you substitute stale urine for water it'll boost its
performance because it gives it more oxygen). Be sure you mix it VERY
well. Roll it out on a flat surface and let it dry completely. (If you store
it before its fully dried out, you'll get a lot of dud shots).

Step 3: Break the dried dough up (be careful here) and put it in an air
tight container and store it in a cool, dry place. This is potent stuff!
The slightest spark can set it off! Flashburn isn't too nice...

There you go... This makes usable powder for bombs, zip guns, and what
ever else you want to blow up or set on fire. NEVER mix it with other
explosives or other ingredients if you plan to use it in a gun! It could
turn the muzzle into a grenade!

If you really want to make a mess mix up some magnesium shavings (REAL
bright, hot fire), or iron fillings/copper powder (splatters sparks
everywhere). Dip some stiff twine (not the nylon type if you can help
it) in white glue and then in gunpowder for a nice stiff fuse thats
hard to put out (great for those pipe bombs!)

                          Bombs of All Types!
                                  By:
                              Shadow Demon


Know of any really GOOD bombs? I got a few good ones here... Maybe
somebody else can expound on it?

Molotov Cocktail:

EVERYBODY knows how to make a cocktail right? Well in case you don't...
Take a nice big GLASS bottle and fill it up (around 2/3 full) with gas
or any other flammable liquid. Stuff a rag soaked with the same liquid in
the bottle, light it, and chunk it at something you want to see BURN!

Flash Bomb:

Fill a small bottle (again glass) with gun powder and tape a fuse to it
(run the fuse inside but put tape to keep it from falling out. (How to
make a fuse is above)). Again light it and chunk it at something....
POOF! A small cloud of smoke... Makes a nice distraction if your trying
to get away...

Pipe Bomb:

Get a small pipe with threads at both ends. Get two caps (also
with threads) that will fit the pipe. Pack the pipe with gun powder and
drill a hole in one of the caps. Assemble the pipe, run a fuse down the
hole, light it and run like hell! Makes a good grenade if there is
enough powder and the pipe is thin enough to blow up. You'll have to
experiment to see what combination works best. (This should work with
any kind of metal piping.)

Flash Bomb II:

This is like the first one but use a plastic medicine bottle packed FULL
of powder. Put a hole in the lid and stick a fuse in it. This makes a
nice BIG mushroom cloud. (You should be able to string up a row of these
connected by a string of blasting caps and a battery for nice special
effects!)

Does anybody know how to make nitroglycerin? I know you cook glycerin
with some kind of acid?? (Hydrochloric or sulfuric?)
