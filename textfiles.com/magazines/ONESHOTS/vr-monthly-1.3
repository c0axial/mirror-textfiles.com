3DO CUSTOMIZES BLADEFORCE FOR VR

    BladeForce, a flying action-shooter title from Studio 3DO, has been
customized to operate with X-O-Tron VR.  A life-sized gyroscope that immerses
gamers into the bullet-dodging, tail-spinning, and dive-bombing action of 3DO
games, the VR gyro has already been snapped up by Paramount's Wonderland in
Ontario, Canada, and at Dollywood in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee.   
    Besides targeting amusement parks and shopping malls, the manufacturer of
the X-O-Tron --  Altare Advanced Technologies -- also has plans to sell the
X-O-Tron to health clubs as a form of exercise and entertainment. Pricing for
the VR technology starts at $22,000.
