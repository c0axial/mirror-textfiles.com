this is
KNKKKKKKKKKKK #2
made by K.N.K. members
in 1993 summer

well, this is zine of my friends and mine, made in
spring of 1993. Now, as i have possibilities, i remaid
it into e-zine. Few interesting pages are disappeared
somewhere, such as Albania scene report, but all in all 
you'll have a somewhat look at Lithuanian scene at 1993
and of our neighbourhoods too.

 Here below i include brief history of K.N.K. (thought 
                         it may be interesting for you):

 I DON'T KNOW WHEN KOKS NORS KELIAS WERE REALLY STARTED,
cause I wasn't with them from the very begining. At my 
first years in University I've met Snapsas, and step by
step here we go... At first I'va done some graphic work
and after that there was an idea to use an advantages of
computer world instead of typewriter...
 At that time the axis of work was "widely opened altern
ative music fanzine". It was made in our native Lithuanian
language and spread in underground scene for freeeeeeee.
So there was KNK#4, KNK#6 (there's no mistake, simply 
there was a rumour that someone had seen a guy reading
#5 already, so we jumped over this number), KNK#7 (at 
that time -- and i think even now -- it was a biggest
Lithuanian zine -- about 40 pages -- some kind of leader), 
KNK#8, KNK#9 (with a single of some punk band included).
In the autumn of 1993 KNK#10 was released. To make all 
this we needed mony, so there were made two issues of
KNK in English, in order to earn money. They were 
called KNKKKKKK, i.e. KNK c(K)omercial. One of them you
read now. Earned money were used to make copies of
Lithuanian numbers and to make a punk festival (lots of
fun :).
 And now were are in 1994. There's another KNK#11 made
through spring and summer, another huge edition containing
about 40 pages, but we have no money to make copies
of it, because prices of xeroxing became high enough.
And also the leader of stuff - Gonzikas - has left the
country heading for the Praha - studies in C.E.U.
And now all our activities are in KNK / RADIO MARABU 
RADIO SHOW on radio TITANIKA. This program is held out
weekly on Monday evenings, and an one hour of it is 
dedicated for alternative music compilation, where 
we can promote also your's works. If you are interested

SCENE REPORT
-------------

Ive been considering for some time what should we 
choose as a basis of a scene report of dying lith
uanian underground.And one night as was laying on
my pillow a nice idea came to my head:
   REHEARSAL PLACES!!!!! that's it !

Im a bit sorry that this story is a bit chaotic,
but I will try to cover as much bands as possible
Rehearsal place is essential thing for any band 
as it starts and all the time on.Most bands call
their shitty dwelling places tenderly,like 'our
studio'.Most of the places are shared by several
bands,like sharing also amps and drumset and then
standing and waiting for their neighbours to fini
sh.A sad sight. It usually takes several months 
to find any possible place and another two to lo
se it.I believe a band which found a good rehear
sal room is automatically committed to stardom.
But all that punky scene which we are part of ...
SA SA,a first legendary Lithuanian punk band of 82-
87 (yes there were punk bands even then.Linas out
of Turbo Reanimacija tells that when he came to li
ve to Seskine district in 1981 found 'Punk and  '
grafitti on his house...) rehearsed in a place ca
lled children/pioneers club cos somebodys lover was
this clubs director.There they managed to create
their brilliant cynical songs...but they patologi
caly avoided any publicity and remeined a mystic
part of our underground.They staged performances
and plays there,which were very unique.IR VISA TAI
KAS YRA GRAZU YRA GRAZU another brilliant avangar
de/indie/God knowswhat our band (called lithuanian
Cardiacs????? ) rehearsed in a cellar under guitaris
ts house.Once they had a new song 'Death of Husse
in' with cellos,tubes,trombones and so on.But chi
ldrens chorus members who had to sing in that son
g could not get inside because of lack of the spa
ce so they ran away.SVASTIKOS SUKITES GREITAI once
an angry guitar rock band used to rehearse in coll
ective gardens.It is a piece of land outside the
town usually 25mx25m given away by soviet governme
nt for urban people to grow vegetables.It is a kin
da strange in our country,we dont have suburbs but
block house districts and this small piece of land
with house.They look terrible but is a good place
for parties.So SSG rehearsed there and moving bass
drum left a deep trace on a luxury oak floor so as
dad saw it he got terribly angry.Now they a pop ba
nd so they have a place near Rasu cementary which
they share with several thrash bands.SIAURES KRYP
TIS,another leading lithuanian indie band,used to
rehearse in a basement in a cinema.Their bassist u
sed to live there and he had to listen to all the
se sounds of strange movies.Now they grew big and
found sponsors.LYGIAI LYJA another gothic band fro
m Siauliai were lucky cos they got a brilliant pla
ce in Institutes international club like in soviet
times a prestige room to meet guests from Middle A
sia.In general many bands especially thrash/death
ones rehearse in their (former) schools.Sometimes
you have a hall shared with folk song chorus (VIE
VERSELIAI) or modern dance groop (PRESERVATIVE FAC
TORY.By the way I witnessed how they were attacked
by dumb macho boys with gas ballons cos the invade
rs liked only pop music).Or you can go to school
cellar or pioneer room,which in soviet times had
Lenin posters and red banners all around.In Kaunas
I 3 years ago visited thrash band ABSCESS in a sch
ool.Their guitarist was hiding from service in so
viet army and his own parents,so they played in
their studio only at nights.He said the most annoy
ing thing in his life was to be waked by school
bells.Also often you can get into a situation when
some ukvedys takes the keys and even doesnt allow
to take away equipment,like when MORGAS rehearsed
in Central Kaunas Heating Network office.Now in
Vilnius punky band DEPRESIJA rehearsed on a roof
of 9 floor building cos their drummer lived there
They were extremely afraid of wind blowing...Un
lucky ones like ALAUS ALAUS or SC had to choose
a cellar of the same kind of building.It is as
big as 2mx3m.The lithuanian punk77 leading band
ERKE MAISE rehearsed everywhere including WC.
Then they found another childrens club and squa
tted a cellar under it,now proclaimed a 'Vilnius
Punk Club'.They have now all other bands rehear
sing in this collective like 16 OBOROTOV,SKAT
and so on.Sometimes they have bands from exUssr
coming to play in their punkjamsessions.Luk Haas
and Donny The Punk out of MRR have visited this
wonderrful place.Sometimes they have catastrophes
there.Once vamzdis broke and shitty water filled
up all basement.Also upstairs they had a big
collection of various animals like rats,fish,etc.
But the guy who was responsible often got drunk
for several days and was forgetting to feed them.
So recently all the fauna died.Leading lithuanian
hardcore band TURBO REANIMACIJA started in vario
us places including all members living room (also
very fashionable thing in our scene).When they got
a place in school a TV came to make programme abo
ut them.In that they shouted that they dont need 
to be sponsored,so surprisingly various businessm
en started phoning them.Then they lost their pla
ce and their brilliant demo 'Turbo Reanimacija'
was recorded/mixed using Sony walkman and russian
audio amp.Then they got a place in Pedagogical Un
iversity campus,but were thrown away by fire secu
rity cos nearby there were various clothes and st
uff stored and that could catch fire.So they use
d to get into the romm by tiny window at night cos
they had no key.But then the pipe broke and all
was covered by shit canalisation water.Now lucki
ly they have a rehearsal place in Philosophy facu
lty,but line-up is shaking.

Now a bit of my personal experiences from Kaunas
scene of 88-93.Many bands like DEFLORACIJA or SAL
IN SETONA were using palepes for rehearsing becau
se they lived in private houses.But as sound goes
to all neighbours that wont last long.SALIN SETONA
then skipped to private house cellar half of which
was occupied by a bath.Another great lithuanian pu
nk band of late 8os 33% KIAULIU PAKELIUI I VATIKANA
first rehearsed in a living room but as walls were
extremely thin there and they often used it as pub
lic house they had to escape.Then they had it in a
far suburb in Greenhouse Plant building.PIONIERIAUS
GARBES ZODIS had a wonderful palce in city theatre.
KELIAS I KOMUNIZMA a Kacergine villadge band had
a place in so-called culture house,a cinema in a 
villadge,but split up when place was remade into a
commercial building for wedding parties.But band
KOMUNA from Svencionys play only in weekends cos
under their place there are postoffice and villad
ge officials.

My own band PRIEMONES had a nice place in Televis
ion plant in a suburb of Kaunas.Deep in its teri
tory,you must pass posts and workshops,there is
a tiny sauna with snooker game room made for wor
king class parties during soviet times,full of
empty bottles.ORFANAI C another my band used to
share a cellar with avangarde band NAJ which was
bought by their drummer.It included a strange em
pty building where all alcoholics and pigeons
from nearby bazar used to shit.But cellar was
extremely wet even in a hot summer so all our
equipment was covered by pelesiai.We were thro
wn away for breaking avantgardists equipment,then
tried out a Agriculture Academy and Trolleybus
Park place.Vilnius based indie band SKYLE re
hearse in a Medical Faculty place which has a
deep smell of formaline.AS MYLIU BLIXA BERGELDA
IR RUSIJA a noise/industrial band got a nice pla
ce in a new district,but their noises were too
much.A old woman came from nearby blockbuilding
to check out who is breaking the baldai...
She was extremely shocked to find their metal
instruments and nobody drunk or stoned...and
you know as you make a gig in your room someti
mes neighbours call a police...

The example of new economical thinking is band
MARICHUANA.They have a rich dad who managed to
get them a place in LITEXPO centre,big white
building for markets and exhibitions...
But somehow it is a big pity that we are not li
ke latvian bands which all have one big rehear
sal hall in Riga Tornis water tower.Someones dad
was a director of all Riga's canalization...

IR VISA TAI KAS YRA GRAZU YRA GRAZU 
-----------------------------------

 HOW DID YOU START?
 Arturas:It was all in 1987 when I had my painying exhi
 bition with music.Then Baras came to my place and said
 - your music is very cool,lets strat an avantgardee
 band.I reply - ok,lets go.We went to Rudamina,a villadge
 where I am a music teacher,found a drumkit,my wife played
 flute,I played guitar and Baras sang.So this was the start
 of the band.Then we began searching for musicians,I found
 one more guitarist,then my brother found a drummer and we
 all arrived in Rudamina and started playing...we had no
 plans then.
 Rimas:even Atsuktuvas played drums
 A:Yes first it was Atsuktuvas we bashed out a few songs
 and a had an unsucessful gig in students fest.The work
 really started when we went to Vilnius and started rehear
 sing in some cellar.

 AND NOW ..
 A:Now I have invited two saxophonists - bariton and alt,
 no more solo guitars,I play all string instruments,also
 drums,violin and vocal.Now my little wife sings.The sa
 xofonist said that she is becoming lithuanian Laura An
 derson.Quite not bad...
 R:We dont know what will come out of her...
 A:I would like her to grow like Aras,her Aras...

 HOW DO YOUR FIND YOUR LYRICS..
 A:What??
 R:Maironis,outstanding lithuanian peot of 20s...
 A:My brother and Baras used to pick up the lyrics.This
 means Baras provided patological part and Rimas the in
 telectual part.We found some really fine verse.So spea
 king frankly it was a sort of middle between dumb wri
 ting and intelectual verse.Anyway lyrics must be lyrics.

 WHY HAVE YOU CHOSEN YOUR STYLE OF MUSIC?..
 A:Va!..we cant do it another way.And we never have in
 our minds beforehand which style we could use,when we
 get together I say "Gee,I have got an idea".And we ne
 ver cared what and how may come of it.At first stage I
 and Baras desired to have an avantgarde band.I collec
 ted many instruments,many various nonsenses,but as soon
 as we had drums it all changed a bit,wanted we it or not.

 WHY DO YOU PLAY?
 I play fifteen years already.Even more.I paint and play
 all the time.My guitar is always covered with paint.It
 is always aside me.I play and paint,I paint and play.
 This is essential part of my life.So I cant answer this
 question.I can demonstrate this...maybe then when we
 make something,so it seems it is cool,and others can
 appreciate it.

 CAN YOU TELL SOME STORY...
 A:I remeber when we wereon the merge of splitting up,I
 tried to stick it all with glue.I invited them all to
 Rudamina to celebrate national independence day.It was
 very good to rehearse then we became good friends.

 AND SOMETHING MERRY...
 It was interesting when we went to Riga to play in so
 me avantgarde festival.We didnt rehearse,because our
 singer was drunk for a month.We decided not to go,but
 drunk Baras suddenly came to Rudamina when it was
 five hours left to the train.It was really something.
 And when we came to Riga instead of going to have a
 little sleep,we went to the movies.And it was a porno
 film.We all went out like t h i s,with standing dicks.
 F**k it,we need a beer...

 AND WHAT ABOU THAT GIG?..
 A:It was cool..
 R:I was playing really loud,itwas  like a toothache...
 A:The violin was really very loud.It is hard to deal
 with acoustic instrument,and that was a violin and al
 so a flute.I went to the sound engineer and told him
 that if we have no violin and skuduciai,lithuanians
 will f**ky strangle you.
 R:So he exegerrated it all.
 A:We played quite many gigs for the students,several
 times we fooled in sports hall(capacity 1000) using
 a playback.There were gigs,even a solo gig in a pla
 netarium...the vocalist though was too drunk...

 DO YOU LIKE ICECREAM?
 A:Yes!!! In general I like sweets.
 R:I cant stand them.

 DO YOU WASH SOCKS?
 A:Yes,I do.
 R:Baras didnt wash socks.So he had to leave.We couldnt
 stand the stinking,it made rehearsing difficult.

 ANYTHING ELSE?
 We had many projects,we want to jam a little with BIX,
 they have a nice place,we could use three drummers.We
 would like to have a tape or LP out,but we need to play.
 And it is hard to play in summer,the strings are too
 hard..hot.Before we wanted to do something with children
 chorus.I asked ten children to come when we did a song
 "Death of Hussein" But it was not enough place in our
 rehearsing cellar,we had too many musicians,some woman
 played violin,tube,trumpet.and children were afraid
 of music so they ran away.Now they feel sorry...I cant
 paly from notes.Once I wanted to play some spanish piece
 from notes..../wawes his hand/....
 R:choroso bylo....
                                   (:      :)

C.Q.A.
------

this interwiew introduces one of the best punky bands
from Vilnius,that is russian language band.Kliaksa
conducted interwiew with their leader San Sanytch.

STORY OF THE BAND?
our band has a simple history.We were three silly young
boys who couldnt play instruments and listened too much
to SEX PISTOLS,read Bakunin and watched The great rock
n'roll swindle who decided to change the world.It happe
ned at the end of 1990.Later other members choose other
styles:first our guitar player started a thrash duo ATO
NEMENT a'la KOROZIJA METALA,also our drummer plays thrash
only more interesting and original.Second guitarist Pepsel
now plays with some stupid man named Coi and copies KINO.
And I play wherever I can and whoever I meet.
The name C.Q.A. means credo quia absurdum and I cant remem
ber who said that but someone from first christians.Before
we were named 16% after the strength of beer "Tauras".We
loved it and still love it,at the time it was best brand
of beer in Lithuania.

WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU NEVER PLAYED MUSIC?
I would draw or create sculptures.After all these possible
stimulations my head has tons of energy and ideas and if
you wont get them outside you can be overloaded and explo
de.What I do in a music field is just simply shit - remains
after my mental activity.

WHAT DO YOU THINK OF GRAZDANSKAYA OBORONA?
One can recieve,accept G.O. at two levels.First level is e
motions.It is similar at animals (e.g. dogs) when they howl
at the music or at shamen,witches in ancient tribes.So if
you are into G.O. at this level then all songs are just
curses,magic words where lyrics in fact have no sense at
all,the words are needed to express sounds.You can check spe
cific literature if you want go deeper.The second level --
are the lyrics themselves.In order to recieve GRAZDANSKAYA
OBORONA in this level one needs to be very wise or one must
have lived for a longer time in conditions like Letov himself
lived in.What about me,so I love G.O. but I am not going to
copy them and if my early pieces sounded like G.O. it was
just because of youthfullness.

IN ONE YOUR TAPE YOU DO SOME SPOKEN WORD PIECE.IS IT TO IN
TRODUCE YOUR SONG 'SLEPOGLUCHONEMOTA' ?
This was called 'Phoenix the bird' and I am just citing 
Ray Bradbury '451 F' and it has nothing to do with my songs.

WHAT ABOUT YOUR GIGS,PUNK SESSIONS?
There were lots of them concerts,sessions,mostly in Vilnius.
We went to play in Kiev,Ukraine aand the one in Kishinev,
Moldavia did not turn out.The best one was when I had no 
bass in Cure fanclub in Vilnius this april,probably that
wont happen again.However the sound engineer was very scared
and constantly turned the vocals down.

PUNX IN LITHUANIA?
In Lithuania as well as everywhere punks split into two parts
government punk and underground punk.I dont want to talk about
government punks and I know and love punk bands like ERKE MAI
SE,SKAT,SMALKES (unfortunately they split),PILK plays punk
with a drive and also my friends Frenk,Manula and Kesar play
Letov kind of punk,before they had a name G.K.D.S.L (group of
communist diversants in free lithuania).I hate TURBO REANIMA
CIJA cos they are pigeons and play mainstreamish childish
songs.

BAKUNIN,KROPOTKIN,MACHNO...?
Such people existed all the time,now it may be called punk,
later a new name may come.Such people will always be they may
only choose a different name.Anarchy exists inside oneself
it is an ideal concept.It is no use to think of anarchy in
a global perspective.Homo sapiens doesnt need anarchy it 
even may be dangerous for him.F**k war.I am a pacifist,I
can talk much about my ideology but  I doubt if anybody is
interested...

WAHAT MUSIC DO YOU LISTEN TO?
Starting from classics:DOORS,early JIMI HENDRIX,early ROLLING
STONES,some BEATLES.Hard rock - BLACK SABBATH.Punk: SEX PISTOLS,
DEAD KENNEDYS,solo BIAFRA,NO MEANS NO,LARD,TUMOR CIRCUS at the
grass,TOY DOLLS,G.O.,AVTOMATICESKYE UDOBLETVORITELI,V.V.,JMKE,
Hardcore:JESUS LIZARD,TYPE OF NEGATIVE,CRUMBSUCKERS,SUCKSPEED.
Industry:MINISTRY ir SONIC VIOLENCE.Shizo:SONIC YOUTH,BUTTHOLE
SURFERS and I also love PINK FLOYD but rather older stuff.And
many more.

WASNT I F**KING BORIN?
And me?...
                           :)

TURBO REANIMACIJA
-----------------

   THIS A VERY SERIOUS TALK WITH KASTIS OUT OF
           *** TURBO REANIMACIJA ***
     BEST LITHUANIAN HARDCORE BAND CONDUCTED
         IN DECEMBER 1992 IN VILNIUS

A BIT ON THE HISTORY OF THE BAND?
The main reason to form TR was that all its members
even when they werent TR members had watched too many
animation films and read a lot of books for children
(and not only).RE/animacija + TURBO (turn quickly).
I was panically afraid of musical instruments,but I ad
mired sounds.Thus our first attemps were really pseudo
minimalism.I met Kriaucius (drums) in school choir and
a week after that we were experimenting with "drums".
Only after 5 years TR have suceeded to record their ef
forts in 8 track studio.Before recording we had many
other pieces which are worse than our last songs only
because of bad quality of spaces between the songs.

LINE UP?
Up to 1991 we had 3 members,in 1992 there were 4 of us.
Kriaucius - drums,Akela/Klaidas - guitars,Artas "10/20"
bass and me on voice & guitar.Kriaucius is a student
and studies in a stupid university so he is always busy.
Akela has a wife so he was also busy and not too creati
ve so he had to leave the band.Artas worked in opera&
ballet theatre so he was the only one who took the music
seriously his bass parts reminded me the repertoire of
our opera house.Last summer new bass player was like fresh
air for us so we had many alcoholic dishes at the sunny
seaside.TR got more strength howewer after doing the new
demo "Linkime pasveikti" in february 93 he was dismissed
from the band cos he was a thrash fan.I am most unstable
member of the band,I lack strength ; I never manage to
drink more than Kriaucius,Akela,Artas...I only like to
praise Lithuanian language.Once I wrote a letter to Ger
many in which I said that our music is shit only our lit
huanian lyrix are wonderful.I never got an answer since
then.

WHAT DO YOUR MUSIC AND LYRIC MEAN?
All good lyrics must be written down lay in a notebook
and wait for some time.Sometimes Kriaucius makes pressu
re upon me,he says that I should write strong,hard lyri
cs,speak about inequality,social and partially economic
problems and I unwittingly after a few weeks...maybe mi
ndsstart appearing in my head...I write something,though
in general I am against it.Our music deals with HC and
PUNK.Kriaucius and me -- we were interested and liked
this kind of music.We have done very little things co
ming from our own...So,f**k that youthful receptivity...

WHAT CAN YOU SAY ABOUT PUNK/HC SITUATION IN LITHUANIA?
Speaking in general about punkrock movement it is possi
ble that it was no such thing in Lithuania at all.Well,
I dont want anybody to have my opinion but if you look
at things from aside I can say that some people had
overtaken some elements of punkrock aesthetic.It is re
lated to the fact that 20th century was a century of
denying and some kind of revolt,many people really re
jected aesthetical and etical norms.This century united
all spheres in which revolt took place,like a chance
for an individual to come and say "I want it to be this
way not that way" and the authorities had to adjust to
that.This has deep roots.And when it came to Lithuania
-- now or a few years ago - it was not another western
dogm but just a moment of time when a man wants to exp
ress his inner freedom has come.It is very important to
avoid superficiality.Really nice music was made in 1987
88 when a rise of punkrock took place but now we have
very few bands.The essential things can be weighted only
by time,but anyway now I can say that only a few small
islanda left where people try to do something,to declare
something or maybe just live for themselves.Here in Vil
nius I could name only a few persons and maybe even more
bands because people often play in several bands.
It is easy to play punk if you are not looking for some
thing new.There are some quadratic tunes here,which
after some time sound like primitive musical experiences
and are very simple to be used and play.I watched the si
tuation in Lithuania in festival WEGGA92,we had many
(around 15) bands,but gain they demonstrated a low level
I should say that strange conservativity is significant
for Lithuania.Many bands,usually being unaware of this
play something like punk77.The latvians in the festival
had more interesting program.Six bands had played and it
was possible to point out something newer and more seri
ous of their music.Their point of wiew concerning music
is quite differend.Their music is more complicated and
they want to make something harder than punk...Because
really much time has passed and it is really possible
to achieve something more perfect in this field of mu
sic.It is important that the movement or its aesthetic
which destroys stereotypes shouldnt become a streotype
itself.THATS ALL.

WHY DO YOU PLAY THEN?
Usually it may be primitive and very nice wish to beco
me popular.But I think that most difficult thing is to
become nobody.There are lots of people around,who want
to wand to better than others:they are united by the
same outlook : but one tries to play do-re-mi-fa-sol
la-si in a special way,another makes efforts to hammer
a nail in a special way or to earn money.
By the way the most perfect choice is to take an inst
rument,go to the mountains stay there for a ten years
and learn to play,make the sound perfect (if one can
express perfection at all) and hide from everybody el
se.Its the most perfect way to hide and know that you
are nobody.It is absolute rejection of the world.Then
you dont care about hardcore,punk,disco,etc.

POLITICAL BELIEFS..
Every authority is violence.But also you should know
that there are so many people,so somebody started to
rule them.Political beliefs is a sort of childrens ga
me,no,sorry,-adults games.Authority does all kinds of
things which makes the society be patient and have a
hard skin.I should say that masses f**k me up - they
understand only hammering of their heads,they are not
able to see any culture or movement.Time and violence
have done their job - the masses really became harden
ed creature with a hippopotamus skin.MY morbid wish -
to sacrifice the comfortable life of the masses,maybe
together with themselves for the sake of the culture.

WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU HAD A MILLION?
If I had a million I would catch an ilness of spiri
tual onanism.I would use it terribly,that million...
It would be my friend and would kiss my ass,then it
would kis my friends' asses,it would kiss our music
between legs.I would cherish that million and it
would ride around free country.Then I would give half
of a million to the unemployed and it would kiss their
asses.And when winter comes I would by an overcoat,
scarf and a pair of boots

DO YOU WASH YOUR SOCKS?
Member of TR wash their socks regulary when they begin
to stink.But we have some exceptions:some days I dont
wash my socks.I hide them under my archair,but my dog
finds them and pulls them into the daylight;somedays
we have rain and socks wash themselves automatically
in the shoes in need only to dry them.Artas was always
speaking of bourgeois in the west that they dont wash
socks they buy new ones and throw the old ones out.By
the way people can also be socks,but it is another
topic...F**k such system - there is no freedom for ex
pression of personality...ha ha!!

ALCOHOL,WIMIN..
I can only say about alcohol and wimin that this is
good.In any case alcohol and wimin are dangerous only
when music brings them.Music cant give you pleasure,
it must give you joy

WHAT DO YOU THINK OF TR NOW  (that is last autumn)?
I feel that we are moving forward.If we will go on
"flowing" we will be Turbo Reanimacija.Now we have
many various things,so if somebody says that ESSEN
TIALLY,really,there are less things,it will be par
tially our foult.

LATVIAN SCENE REPORT
--------------------

Latvia is aside with Lithuania and have many coommon featu
res including the one that latvian language is the only one
taht at least slightly reminds lithuanian.Not much of close
ties or unification has left now.Latvia was forced to become
more multinational - over 50% of Riga people are not latvian
and now erm... they live better all north Lithuania tries to
sell bread and butter in Latvia because of higher price.So
here we include Latvian scene report done with help of Janis
Daugavietis at Dziga fanzine.Some summer I vivited Latvia
and the famous Tornis tower where all underground groups re
hearse in Riga,drink,f**k,talk whatever.It is big old water
tower tower in the 3rd floor there are two rooms equipped for
modern two track studio and reel tapes,latvian and russian
fanzines all thrown around....creating a real underground work
shop atmosphere.Most of the time bands just not rehearse but
jam around or in summer they just go to the seaside and play
football and basketball oh whatever.Janis said that the main
fun is to go to shows arranged by Western capitalists in Riga
parks drink beer and watch singing children.
Whatabout conclusions to punk and related movements in Latvia,
Janis once said : punk in Latvia is not dead yet because it
was not born.And then it waas a talk that Riga should be ca
pital of northern underground.A la la la,so here we introduce
all latvian bands...
                                     :|
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

LINKSMA MASTURBACIJA was fun
punk hc band from a little town
aside of Riga.Now leader of the
band Wimboo Fish said ;"no
more this"and they have split
up,leaving a demo "Brutal Com
pensation"(Tornis rec93).Bassist
Mad Rob hopes to start his own
band RAMAIS TUPLIS.

DILONIS is the strongest band from
Kuldiga earlier working           
under the name of N.D.A.The members
of the band also did a fanzine "WILKS"
which was produced in a typing house
by someones dad at nights one time
it was all green.They had several demos
out all in fasty but traditional punxo
style.Now they incorporated two former
LINKSMA M members Vesturs so they
sometimes use two bass guitars oh what
ever.Their rehearsal,drinking,f**king
place in Kuldiga is called VONS and
in fact is a squatted place...

TRUBAPSIHS  is a band of former member of
FUNIS & PIJOLI Martins which
 now has changed name into
AINIS SARKANAZOBIS.The band plays in schizoick style .

INOKENTIJS MARPLS - DAMBIS leader,singer and vocalist of the
band started it in fact in 1985,the name comes from around
1987.They "started recording something in a room,first appea
ring in public in 1986.The the drummer was taken to soviet
army and put in jail for 4 years for escaping it and he spent
3.5 years in prison.I imitated 'suicide' in order to get
to mental hospital and avoid army thus I had to spent some
time in psychiatric clinics and once in army hospital.
In 1987 we made a debut in Riga rock club -- at the time
in Latvia it was a band ZIG ZAG playing some post punk.
One nice day bassist left us cos he lost finger from his
right hand.At the same time we went to Vilnius to play
in some punk fest but we didnt know when it happens so
we came 3-4 days too early.We know nobody in the town but
we met some punx and drank with them.They also knew not
hing about the fest and made efforts to leave us,most 
probably they thought we were hippies and cant play HARD
CORE.So after spending 2 days in Vilnius railway station
we finished our first Lithuanian tour.
In the end of 1987 we made a festival in Riga with all
new bands,different styled but at the time it was all UN
DERGRAUND,it was once again in summer 1988.Our appearence
was tragic,I fell down from stage and fell asleep.Some
body woke me up and we performed something.I howled
into the mic because I couldnt see the mic hangs on my
guitar (I was told about it later).We staged a show
then cos one man who was as much gone as me was cutting
a chair with a mechanical peel.I wonder how nobody was
injured then.Friend told me that he escaped the show
because he did not to watch somebody cut into pieces.By
the way our bassist brought 50 bottles of homebrew vod
ka at that show...
We appeared in Lithuania also in fest "Purvinoji Ziema"
in Kaunas 88,and fest VILNIUS UNDERGROUND 89 made me
a huge impression,it was a big MADNESS,a forced anarchy
was in the air.Our drummer from new line-up wanted to
escape,probably he was much scared.Our show ended as
somebody jumping from stage tore off the cables.When
we went home we felt like returning from war.
In 1989 I got a phone call from Moscow,some men intervie
ved me and invited to OSTANKINO television to record
and make a video for a programme 'Devils circle'.Video
was quite shitty and it was all about Riga rock club.
Howewer the program was not aired and censored.Later 
I read in a newspaper that it was propaganda of nazism
and pornography in it...
During 1990 we sstill apeared in Riga rock club but
later it was all broken for some time" Up to now
IM has no stable line up and Dambis plays with occaso
nal fans of jazz\hendrix and develops his band
AMORALA PSIHOZE.
"My band is not influanced by anybody,I have no favou
rite and listen to different kinds of music.I play
what I like and never dig making covers.Lyrics are
different - about social problems,political,philoso
phical,humorous s\\mitymes schizophrenic.I express
my world wiews and the current day in them..."
Dambis still continues being active with band,gigs,
tapes,etc...

M.GVARDE was a glitter punx band
which has done their second
tape "Dublu valsis this winter". 
But them the band has split up
because their sound engineer Ingus
has died tragically.The bassist
Ivars Poskins has returned back 
to his old band BEZ GREZNIBAS 
playing proletrock it has started 
again after one year of missing.

SHINE ON a indieyouth band was 
considered one of best really
new bands in Riga after recording
their demo "Hronikass" /s.youthstyle/
in 1992.Janis says they are the
only band that continued rehear
sing even in summer after theey
had joyned new member El.

TUKSA MUCA a indie band with depres
sive elements was considered to be
best running Tornis band,they are
very productive with producing seve
ral demos early this year "Trajektorija:
sapni-relejs "and "Mikroskops".Only
the founder of band Andizons has left
from first line up with former guita
rist Juris on dr and Raimonds on g,
but girl Liene playing sax has left...

ULDIS DUMBIS is a representative of 
tornis core style - the one that oc
asionally records some tape in Tornis
and is constantly looking for a drummer.

VIHERS a country punk band with fenomenal
screaming vocalist Sviests have started
again they hope to mobilize themselves
with a new drummer and deep into wawes
of latvian punk.Though
abortion?Shimmy foetus???
well,nevermind they can remembertheir shows go on...

R.A.F> is defined as CCCP punk band
but they have just started rehea
rsing and getting ready for their
first demo.Janis also mentioned the
surprrising fact that in spite the 
fact that there are more russian popu
lation in Riga than latvian there
are practically no russian bands.The
only one who was at least a bit active
was II3MEHA.Also some bands happen in
Ventspils.

GRINDMASTER DEAD is another Tornis band
but they have left the only heavy grin
dddd underground band.I remember them
doing a song of a man who died and left
nothing after him and all for got him.
Let it be! Fly little latvian angels and birds.
As you see I always end with a happy note.Din!

P.A.G.A.N. is now proclaimed best new band in
Latvia being a 4 men pure hardcore (death me
tal influenced) with name standing for people
against good and normality.They come from 
russian town Liepaja and rehearse in
a garage there.Now they appeared in Riga,did
a gig and 22 song demo,though before they
went to Moscow to hang around...

AHIMSA

P.O.BOX 30
02-105 WARSZAWA
POLSKA

WHO ARE YOU REALLY...?
We are little,green creatures with triangled
heads,three tubes and two teeth and knockles on
both sides of the head.Generally our shape mostly
does re mind something like samowar...

I USED TO KNOW OLD POLISH HARDCORE.WHAT DOES
POLISH SCENE LOOK LIKE TODAY?
 Bands like Dezerter and Armia go on
 playing.Nowadays they are very popular bands
 having big audiences sometimes several thousand
 people.They are as much as popular as big stars
 of polish rock,winning various f**ken readers
 polls ,etc.
 Today Poland has quite many various bands - at
 least we have a country with 38 million
 nation.Some 'corpses' decided to play again
 mostly
 because they lacked some money.Many new bands are
 coming,trying to introduce something new,trying
 to show that music doesnt end with exploited and
 oi destroy,that it is obvious that instend
 mutting the water one should move own ass and
 start working.The scene here means young bands
 which indentify themselves with positive side of
 hc/punk (wegetarianism,ecology,antifascizm,fight
 against racism,sexism,church,nationalism,etc...),
 Hundreds of zines appear.We had some protest
 actions against atom power station in Zarnowiec,
 buildings in Czorztyn,korrida,against army...this
 also comes with a number of charity gigs,in 1991
 we played in a gig for free Lithuania.

 WHAT DOES NOTHER EARTH MEAN TO YOU AND WHAT ABOUT
 PLANS FOR SAVING IT?
 'Saving of Mother Earth' is a very wide
 conception.This is something more that things
 around industrial ecology - all tthese clean
 technologies,flirts are not enough.It is needed
 to juump inside peoples minds to have an
 ecological consciousness - man must come as a
 little part in harmony with other little
 particles in a huge nature system,but not like
 mad exploiters of the earth.Life according to
 nature,RESPECT FOR YOURSELF are the things to
 start from...

 WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT JAZZ?GRIND?
 Jaazz - sometimes is nice sometimes is not,but I
 think it is rather nice,a sort of rock jazz -
 king crimson,yes or jazzycore - victims
 family,assasins of god,primus,24-7 spyz...
 grind - a pile of noise and someone vomiting,I
 dont understand this kind of music.It was a
 spreading of this style in Poland 4 years ago,now
 all these bands play death metal.This is the end
 of it...

 CAN YOUR MUSIC BE CALLED A COMERCIAL PUNK?
 Never heard anybody defyning us in that way
 though people want to find some name for our
 music.Most simple name for our music could be
 emojazzhippiesoulprogressivesoftcore. Commercial
 punk that could be sex pistols or exploited and
 we have nothing to do with this music.Smash
 rock'n'roll!

 WHAT DO YOU THINK OF TROTTEL?  Nice band.
 WHAT IS YOUR FAVOURITE ANIMATION CARTOON?
 THere lots of them like our polish: Bolek&Lolek,
 Zaczarowany Olowek,Porwanie Baltazara gabki,
 czech A je to!.. ,russian wolk i zajac ,french
 barbapapa ... and lots more.I am nervous when I
 see any shitty american piece with all these
 robots,cosmicshits,f**king supermans...

 WHAT ABOUT STRAIGHT EDGE?
 Ideas of S.E. were very important for us when we
 started (late 89) it was a sort of revolt.Up to
 now we dont drink,but it is rather about our
 personalities,nnot some sort of indentifying with
 S.E.Straight edge would be very useful in our
 drunk and vomiting land.

 WHAT DO YOU THINK OF LIFE IN LITHUANIA?
 /some sort of bragging on end of bolshevism and
 independence in our kingdom/
 ..urm seriously speaking we hope that Lithuania
 escapes this soret of situation in Poland where
 absolute capitalism is introduced by
 politicians.It looks lie some 19th century
 bouergoise forms,instead of people living better
 it gets worse more hungry and homeless people
 more of them life on the verge of
 poverty.Politicians avoid social problems but
 f**k oround things like abortion,changing of
 anthem etc... and they steal milions from state
 with massive economic corruption.Christian
 nationalists seem tto take power with dangerous
 and fanatic looks.It feels like a totalitarian
 state
 It seems like f**king ruler as comunist must be
 changed into some image of priest...

 WHAT ABOU A QUESTION WITH A HOOK?
 erm its a sort like - why do you fish without a
 hook?  answer is because fishing is
 bloody,f**king sport ...
                                       * *

LITHUANIAN BEER REPORT
----------------------

 LITHUANIAN BEER INTRUDUZIOOOO!!!

 Starting this lithuanian beer report we must say that
 the main idea about it is that we suggest that anyway
 you could better go and have some beers instead of re
 ading idiotic braggings about from our piece.But in
 the case your hand holds some styupid beer can made of
 shitty metal so you beter go on reading all our story
  The production of ber in Lithuanian began ages ago.
 These days nobody knew f**k pistols but ALUS (beer in
 lithuanioan) and MIDUS (another mystic lithuanian dri
 nk that nobody has tasted but supposedly vodka meets
 honey).It was years before Christ.The lithuanian cele
 brations included worshiping of bbeer god Ragutis to
 gether with consuming beer in enoprmous quantities.
 Thuis is absolutely natural,no? In medieval chronic
 les lithuanian ancestors are described as drunk barba
 rians with rare introductions describing pagan fests.
 OK,here we start travelling thru beery Lithuania.You
 can supposedly sail into our port named Klaipeda.This
 good town has brewery named "Svyturys" founded in 1784.
 Svyturys in english means lighthouse which is very
 simbolic.THe best beer "Baltijos" (alc.vol.4%),the
 weaker variations are "Baltijos light"(3.2%)and "Bal
 tijos original"(3.6%).Another zajabys beer is "Sirve
 nos"(4.4%)."Kursiu" beer is legendary but shitty cos
 it is light (2.8%).Anyway we must say that lithuanian
 beer is much different from western beer.We cant ima
 gine these idiotic stories of high priced beer sold
 only for adults.Beer in lithuania is all ages show and
 not anything like higly pasteurized light lemonade
 shit with a tiny bit of alcohol.Our beer is thicker,
 harder,heavyer and after having some you feel like a
 very brave knight! Klaipeda also has f**kin great
 old city where you can come across nice pubs (Ugnius
 recommends "Siksnosparnis") with old germanic atmosp
 here.
  Lets go to the next time.Another town in western li
  thuania region named Zemaitija is Mazeikia another
  bastion with brewery "Lokys"("Bear",founded in 1932)
  but new ber brads produced here "Zemaitiskas light"
  "Zematiskas dark","Lokio"(3.2%),"Venta"(2.8%)do not
  promise much.In general this area Zemaitija people
  dont like beering too much and dont understand it.
  There peasantss mostly f**k with vodka.Lets quickly
  skip to more merry corners:
 Siauliai is a town in centre of Lithuania,though it
 is mostly understood as part of Zemaitija with nice
 brewery (founded around 1890)"Ggubernija".Beer is go
 od and original and earlier it used to be even bet
 ter.Smiling bbeers are "Gubernija"(4.3%),and also
 "Siauliu"(3.7%),"Pirslio"(3.4%),"Sodzius"(3.9%),"Dva
 ro.".THere aro no more nice facts about Siauliai.
  Kaunas is second biggest Lithuanian town.The best
  and power old brewery "Ragutis" (named after fam
  ous lithuanian beer god,founded 1861) now splits
  into some productive ancestors which cover at le
  ast with 1/3 of lithuanian land with beer (more
  job is done by "Utenos gerimai").Among many scree
  ny bear sorts are "Birzieciu"(6.1%),"Sirvenos"(4.4%),
  "Ukininku"(3.9%),and during the heavy/thrash festival
  in Kaunas i tasted a new thing - "The old Kaunas"
  (4.2%).VERY GOOD! (but it's not clear , what is bet
  ter : "The old Kaunas" or the festival , where i did
   stage diving). So , everything seems to be O.K. in
   Kaunas with berrr.Come and hyujumkukbyj !
   Before going to lands that are owerflooded wiht
   beerry we have a little stop in most shitty towny
   "Panevezys".It is most full own american styled
   shaved sportswear kids (not exactly skinheads),
   which enjoy attacking newcomers.A little nice bre
   werty is "Kalnapilis" (founded in  ... dont know
   Besxt brands are "Aukstaiciu"(5%),"Birzu"(5%),
   other "Cicinsko","Zveju","Panevezio"are  a bit
   more bitter but weak and smell like shit like all
   Panevezys very specific to all this town.Beer from
   Panevezys is better when bought in some other town
   witout going into this crusty hole.
  And now welcom e in NORTH LITHUAANIA! Please belie
  ve this is nice land with kind people.Anyone who has
  at least some respect toi himself here makes homebrew
  beer,shares it with neighbours and makes efforts to
  distribute it among people.Homebrew is many times bet
  ter than factories production.This taastes good and
  IS strong.This is awesome!.The capital of homebrew
  beer is little town Pasvalys.Ber is produced here
  almost in every second house.This town has a really
  good name in underground circles.Each year they have
  small musical fest which attracts hitchhikers from
  all country.Many people dont have a chance to see
  anything besides beer when they come there,but in
  the next morning friends teel each other stories
  what did they did last night,what they saw though
  their memories often have blach holes.All these sto
  ries have a shape,smell and taste of magic,absurd
  and wonderful tales...everybody go to pasvalys!..
   Birzai is a town near Pasvalys.There is another
   brewery "Kalnapilis" with nice brands "Sirvenos
   "Birzu","Baltijos","Kauno"(3.4%).Also this town has
   an old castle and lake so you can have a rest and
   drink on the grass and riot on.On tthe road to Pas
   valys there are many gardens with fresh apples so
   when we missed the bus and walked we survived on
   apples..then we were attacked by a bull when we
   decided to steal some water from the cows in the
   night.Then we got into a truck...Speaking frankly
   Birzai is nice.
   Also homebrew beer is produced in towns Joniskis,
   Kupiskis,Rokiskis.
Region named Aukstaitija was always OK.It has many la
1kes and forests - good places to drink.Also it has
Lithuanian Beer Capital - Utena.The circulation of
beer lovers never stops at huge brwwery "Utenos Geri
mai" (founded in 1975).Beer is here very good it is
produced also for export.The most weird story is that
much beer is exported to Australia for lithuanian exi
les,which prefer it to local brands.Most strongest
beer in Lithuania "Porteris"(6.4%)is produced there to
gether with "Utenos"(4.6%),"Lietuviskas"(5%)-wowww!!!,
"Baltijos"(4%),good brands are "Bociu"(3%),"Aukstaiti
jos"(3.2%).Also they started producing elitist kind of
beer which is quite highpriced (0.5$)"GJ" which sounds
like "Utenos " beer meets german brands.Wuilia.! The
town itself has a lot of metalfans,bikers and stuff.
Beer is everywhjere,life can not proceeed witout it.
 And also Vilnius.The capital has good brewery "Tau
 ras" (founded in 1869)with reallu good brands like
 "Tauras"(4.5%),"Senieji Trakai"(4.2%)& "Vilniaus"(3%)
 Also beer can be bought by liters.Almost every day
 in green parks of Vilnius young underground genera
 tions spend many hours drinking beer.Each 5 minutes
 some older people dressed in rags come and ask for
 empty bottle.
  IN general in Lithuania there are no problems with
  beer.Previous comunist regime was controlling too
  many things,so it was a bit of disorder in beer in
  dustry.Now you can drink what you like and as much
  as you like.Usually in our country the beer is avai
  lable in liters so you need some can to avoid f**king
  with glass bottles.The most popular is 3 liter jar.
  Underground people drink in cellars in winter and
  in the parks or near the lake in summer or you can
  go to the bar or on the roof.We are happy!!!
