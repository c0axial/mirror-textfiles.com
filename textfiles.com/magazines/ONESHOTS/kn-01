To all KNOTTED subscribers,

    The volume of submissions for issue five has been very low
  when compared to issue four, and for this reason I am sending
  a note to our devoted readers.  Please get off your fannies
  and write some quality articles!  Kipp would love nothing more
  than to spend endless nights editing the next issue of KNOTTED.
  If you are totally stumped for a submission idea, here are a
  few of my current favorites to help you along:

  1. If you haven't had a chance to write a letter to the editor 
     blasting Gary St. Larwence for last issue's articles, please
     feel free to join the club.

  2. Exactly how much do you hate Image, its comics, and the 
     company.  This is always a fun one.

  3. Todd McFarlane, Demi-God or dweeb?  Just ask The Saint about
     this one.

  4. Dirtbag, can Rich pull it off?  How much can the Internet
     community influence the market for independent comics?  With
     the sudden surge in racm readers, is it possible for independent
     comics that promote over the Intenet (like Dirtbag) to succeed?

  5. KNOTTED NOTED, exactly what does that mean?  Was John too
     lazy to draw an S in place of the D?  Why doesn't someone
     draw an S?  Hey, that gives me an idea!

**Contest**
    The best article for issue five that includes an S to replace
    the D in the word NOTED will get a Dirtbag #1 (I purchased 2
    of them, and if we are lucky we can get Rich to sign one!).
    Rich has also offered up as a bonus prize, an official Dirtbag
    #2 Ashcan, sure to be a collectors item.  The best article and
    S will be judged by Kipp and myself, with results announced in
    KNOTTED #6.

  Just remember, we don't have the ability to skip an issue and
  resolicit at a later date so get those submissions in! :)

  Submissions for the next issue of KNOTTED are now being accepted
  by the editor.  Please send any material to:

          Address:     ah804@FreeNet.Carleton.CA (Kipp Lightburn)

             Body:     Your very important submission.
