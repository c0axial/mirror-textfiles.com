³WHY ANOTHER MAGAZINE?³
ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

     In the underground, there can never be enough magazines.
I have read a large majority of them, with the best being
Phrack, LOD Technical Journal, and Phun to just name a few.
I have also read total flops, magazines that a little kid
could write and probably did.  My intentions, for this
magazine is to cover some of the topics that others magazines
have not, in a clear, easy to understand format.
     I have been in the underground for a while now.  I am
not new, but no one ever knows everything and I am always
open to people's ideas.  The underground needs to go through
a reform in the 90's.  It is really ludicrous that we fight
against ourselves when that anger could and SHOULD be
directed towards law enforcement.  If people spent the time
they use fighting amongst themselves, and directed that
energy and time to a fruitful cause such as scanning,
hacking, or writing text files, the underground would be a
much more advanced place.

³LAW & LEGISLATION³

     Due to an increasing amount of law and legislation
designed to deter hackers, I will ask that anyone who comes
across any new legislation to please send it to us.  I would
also like to keep tabs on the status of Caller ID.  Which
states have it?  Which states is it pending?
     It seems as though the government has declared war on
the underground.  Let's try and stay one step ahead of them.
     I would also like to hear from anyone who was busted in
Operation Sundevil.  In a future issue I hope to spotlight
that.

³IN THE NEWS³
ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

     This will probably be your favorite section.  If you
have been out of the scene for a while, this section will
tell you what is going on.
     I would like to compile a list for H/P, of all the
groups in the United States and Canada.  The groups must be
HP though.  I will NOT spotlight warez groups although if
your group combines the two then fine.  Please include what
type of people you are looking for, modem speed,
headquarters, NuP, specialtys, etc.
    I am including in this issue a magazine article that
everyone should be interested in about TymNet and Credit
Card Fraud.  I'll let you make up your mind on it, but
some of you had better watch who you are trading with
on QSD and Lutzifer.
     Speaking of TymNet, let's face it.  NUI's are pretty
scarce.  I read an article that said Microwire received a
$350,000 fone bill.  the T.HONxxx nuis go up and down.  If
anyone has a NUI hacker I would be VERY interested.
    I have also included some articles from the book John McAfee
wrote titled, "Computer viruses, worms, trojan horses, and
other threats to your system", or something like that.
If you aren't familiar with John McAfee, he is the one who
writes and publishes the SCAN, CLEAN, MDISK type of anti-virus
utilities.
     If anyone has ever dealt with the EFF, (Electronic
Frontier Foundation), please send me any information
possible.  I know that have helped a lot of people and if
anyone tries to say anything about this magazine, well first
off, they can kiss my ass, second, if it's some 3-letter
agency, I would like to be prepared.  It is my right by
freedom of the press to publish whatever I damn want to.  If
you have something to say about this magazine or any
magazine, you should listen to yourself and then write a
better one.  Until you do that, you have no room to talk.

³Computers Feed International Credit Card Fraud³
ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

    By Joe Abernathy
    Houston (Texas) Chronicle
    May 19, 1991


    A new international den of thieves linked by computer may be going to town
with your credit card.
    Stolen credit card and other account information is both currency and
commodity in this technological underworld, which is giving rise to the
specter of offshore "data havens" outside the ready grasp of the U.S. law.
    "Once the hackers get some live numbers, they trade," said Jim Steele,
Mastercard's director of security for the central United States.  "It's a real
problem."

    Secret Service Agent Tom Moyle agreed, calling the potential for public
harm, "tremendous."

    The new data havens represent a kind of hacker's bazaar, where many
participants don't even share a language.  But words aren't needed when
numbers do the talking.

    In a home near you, a hacker may be staring at a monitor with a list of
pseudonyms and nationalities.  At the touch of a key he can excahnge purloined
credit card information with a comrade in Finland.

    "MasterCard 5424 1800 2674 5624 exp 9/91 Thomas Wright," read one recent
message, typical of the lot.

    (The phrase "computer hacker" originally was a characterization proudly
claimed by computer hobbyists, with its roots in the hacked together nature of
early computer exploration.  It is still used in some computer circles, but in
the law and popular vernacular it is now usually understood to describe people
who gain unauthorized access to computer systems for fraudulent purposes.)

    One overseas gathering point offers over 400 megabytes of software for
copying, representing hundreds or thousand of stolen titles.

    Each of the data havens is actually a computer in somebody's home or
business.  They have names - QSD, Lutzifer - and serve as electronic
communities.

    The "citizens" are physically located continents apart, while
communicating in an electronic forum that has been convened in a third world
country. Calls may even be routed through a fourth nation for additional
security, with each step in the process making law enforcement's job more
difficult.

    "Try getting Israel to cooperate with an Arab country for an
investigation," said one hacker, laughingly describing the logistical
nightmare authorities face.  "Or go through South Africa and try to get anyone
to cooperate with them."

    Authorities must get a search warrant or permission to conduct
surveillance at each step in the communications link.  And that may not even
be possible - not every nation has a legal structure designed to respect
credit ratings and intellectual property.
    Those making use of the data havens are doing so through the commercial
communiations network designed specially to link computers around the world.
    To customers, these networks are known as Telenet, Sprintnet, EasyLink
(Southwestern bell) or TymNet; generically, they are called "x.25 networks"
for the technical standard describing details of their operation.
    "Those systems are set up simply as a vehicle to communicate," said Moyle,
supervisor at the Secret Service fraud devision.  "If you sign up, get an
account and pay your monthly bill, you've got very clean data transmission
lines and you can talk to a variety of places for a variety of reasons.
    "You've got business folks using those lines, folks involved in research.
That's the legitimate use for them, messaging.  You're connecting up to
bulletin boards, is all you're doing."
    Most of those calling the overseas fraud boards via the x.25 networks are
stealing air time from service providers and their customers - a fact that has
helped attract investigative agencies to the scene.  One company had to pay a
$350,000 bill recently for hacker phone calls.  (GK-That had to be Microwire!)
    "A lot of the three-letter agencies are there," said Don Murtaugh, chief
of security for British Telecom International, the parent of TymNet.  "Because
we're still pursuing it, you hate to say too much."
    Using a variety of plays, hackers created user accounts and hacked into
accounts of legitimate users.  Account names and passwords were passed around
for others to use.
    "Many of the IDs were IDs that customers had and had stopped using or
failed to cancel," said Murtaugh, explaining that the customer is liable for
the bills run up by using x.25 phone accounts.  "If you look at the number of
those (stolen accounts) it was in the hundreds.  We found ourseles being
violated."
    Murtaugh confirmed that federal agencies making inquiries include the
Secret Service, Central Intelligence Agency, FBI and National Security Agency.
    The CIA, FBI and NSA refused to comment.
    So many agencies are interested.  The Secret Service specializes in fraud
investigations, for example, and the CIA worries with external security.
    The NSA, an ultrasecret agency nominally charged with decrypting
intercepted foreign communications, is widely believed in the computer science
community to engage in routine monitoring of communications throughout the
world's computer networks.
    "It's a felony to possess 15 or more credit card or telephone access
numbers," said Moyle, explaining the law most likely to be invoked for
trafficking in access device numbers - the name collectively given to such
things as credit card numbers and computer passwords.
    "Simple possession is a felony, let alone actually using them.  If you
traffic in or use one or more and the aggregate value of loss is $1,000 of an
access number, then that meets the black and white statute also."
    The only problem with the rule of 15, Steele said, is that it only applies
in the United States.  The data havens operate overseas.
    He added that the $1,000 threshold can be reached by one typical
merchandise order placed on a stolen credit card number by one computer
hacker.  And each stolen number may be used repeatedly by any number of
hackers over a period of weeks.
    "It's not like a person was mugged," he said, in which case a stolen card
would be canceled quickly, typically taking a maximum hit of only $1,500.
    "If somebody posts your number on a bulletin board, you're not going to
know until the next billing cycle.  That's why the significance of the dollar
loss can be greater for that kind of crime."
    Computer hackers have trafficked in credit cards and other access device
numbers for as long as there have been hacker bulletin boards.  Often, the
information they trade in their high-tech haunts comes from a tool as low-tech
as "dumpster diving" - rummaging through a store's trash for credit card
carbons.
    Because stolen account numbers are so easy to obtain by these less
sophisicated means, hackers are only a part of the overall problem, Steele
said.  Precisely how much is difficult to measure.
    Of the $301 million MasterCard lost to fraud in 1990, $26 million occurred
through telephone sales, which is the most common technique hacker's emply.
"Counterfeiting" of cards, another popular ploy in which a stolen number is
usually superimposed over an old card, accounted for $33 million is losses.
    And, of course, MasterCard is only one credit card company.  Visa is
nearly twice its size.
    "There are some real scam artists who use the bulletin boards as a way to
get live access devices," said Steele, a former Secret Service agent.  "There
are others who look at penetrating any system as a challenge - they post some
information just to say, hey look, I can do it.
    "But of course when you post that information, you've got proprietary
information that can be financially damaging, military records, things like
that."
    The electronic mail and other documents of at least one Secret Service
employee were allegedly compromised by a TymNet hacker.  He used an internal
network management tool to monitor this agency employee while he was using a
computer either at home or one the job.
    The inspector's office of the Secret Service launched an internal
investigation after being informed by the Houston Chronicle of the apparent
breach.  Inspectors would not comment on the investigation.
    Information concerning the credit card trafficking and abuse of the x.25
networks came to the attention of the Chronicle during a series of telephone
conversations and meetings with members of the computer underground in
Houston, San Francisco and New York.  The information was used to parlay
further details from security officials and others.
    Activities within the data havens were monitored by a reporter online.
MasterCard security officials and the issuing institution were alerted to the
stolen credit card number printed in this story.
    "The individuals who are involved in this world, are very bright and very
inquiring by nature," said Moyle of the Secret Service.  "There's an
attraction to dealing with folks in different countries because it provides a
different perspective, a different learning base, a different knowledge base
to inquire about."
    "We certainly have no objection to normal sharing or learning.  Where they
come to our attention and invoke our wrath, if you will, is when they cross
over the border - the legal border not the geographic border."

³THE HACKER PROFILE³
ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

    By John McAfee


The intellectual skills of the hackers invite respect, and most of them would
not dream of acting maliciously.  But there are many who may be regarded as
social misfits because of the dominant role that computers play in their
isolated lives.  This isolation and inevitable introversion in personality
appear particularly prevalent among hackers operating on the dark side, who
irresponsibly break into systems for personal gain or to spread viruses.  They
often shun conventional human contact and tend not to make friends or have
social interchanges apart from interaction on electronic bulletin boards.
    One programmer - call him Joe - was recruited through the National
Bulletin Board Society, and he typifies this hacker reclusiveness.  Joe
stipulated in his contract that he would never meet or discuss his work
person-to-person with his client, even by telephone.  Joe's programming was
extremely elegant and precise, and he could complete even complex tasks within
days when average programmers might take weeks.  He was obviously a name of
extreme intelligence and ability, but he just could not cope with human
contact in the conventional sense.  However, he relates strongly to computers
because, like many hackers, they have become animate things, more satisfactory
and dependable in many respect than humans.
    The complexities of these extreme relationships between hackers and their
machines mirror the complexities and intensities to be found in conventional
interpersonal relationships.  Joe, for example, despite his extreme antisocial
attitude, loved computers and would never consider planting a virus that might
compromise a system's integrity.  Indeed, he was so precise in everything to
do with computing that he could not tolerate the fact that the internal clock
on one of his client's systems was not absolutely accurate, and he felt
compelled to leave his own keyboard to fix it.
    After another hacker, Kevin Mitnick, was arrested and charged with
breaking into Digital Equipment Coporation's system, the Los Angeles Times
reported that when the investigator for the Los Angeles County district
attorney's office accused him of harming a computer, tears came into his eyes.
The investigator, Robert Ewen, described Mitnick as having an umbilical cord
from the computer to his soul, becoming a giant when he got behind a keyboard.
    Hackers with such personalities who spread viruses do not consider
themselves to be attacking computers per se, but the people and organizations
using them are the ones they perceive to be the real enemies.  The potential
threat from a reclusive personality obsessed with computing - indeed, addicted
to it - when coupled with a real or imagined gradge against big business, the
government, or against the computing community establishment as a whole is
similar to that of the snipers who take revenge by indiscriminately firing on
crowds.  A virus give the maverick hacker a powerful weapon against perceived
enemies.
    There are indications from the monitoring of bulletin board activity that
some of the lonely hackers are striking up somewhat formalized relationships
with other of their kind to develop ever-more potent virus programs.  The
viruses show a distinct trend toward becoming more malicious, dangerous, and
hostile.  However, it is still unclear whether the primary perpetrators of the
worst viruses are mainly individuals or groups.  There are underground hacker
organizations that bring together antisocial individuals who pool their skills
to create viruses.  Such collaboration became a feature of hacking in the late
1970s and the early 1980s, before virus programs were being written on any
scale and when the prime interest was simply breaking into secure systems.
But the main threat at this stage of the virus epidemic still appears to be
from individuals hostile to society who work entirely alone, alienated from
direct contact with others, who write viruses as an extension of the hacking
activites that form their substitue for conventional social intercourse.
These lone hackers are almost impossible to identify.
    There is a schism opening up between different types of hackers as a "good
guy versus bad guys" situation develops.  The malicious hackers find it
creative and exciting to write viruses and to spread them; however, others are
finding it even more stimulating to try to thwart their evil intentions.  It
is becoming thrust and parry as the virus writers come up with new techniques
and the "good hackers" counter with ways to combat them.  Increasingly, the
good guys are counterattacking, making preemptive strikes with programs
containing protection features that anticipate the next phase of virus
offensives.
    Generally, hackers do not fit into any of the traditional social grouping
or psychological stereotypes, which make it difficult for the security
specialists, for whom they have become serious adversaries, to understand they
motivations.  Hacking is not just a hobby or area of interest, but often
becomes a dominant lifestyle to which its participants make a strong
commitment.  Many spend all night, alone at their computer, devising fiendish
programs and trying to break into other people's systems.  Their activities
seem incomprehensible to those not fascinated by computers or who simply use
them as the tools of their trades.
    Hacking is now so widespread that there is a hacker in nearly every
neighborhood.  A seemingly innocent teenager, who appears to be working late
on a school project while the rest of the family is watching television or has
gone to bed, may well be creating a malicious virus program and trying to run
it in a system at IBM, General Motors, or the Pentagon.
    Hacking is predominantly a male activity which parallels intellectually
the physical excitement of big game hunting - tracking a quarry, pursuing it
until it is cornered and then - with the virus a new and powerful weapon -
making a kill.  The main difference in the electronic expression of basic
hunting urges is that one has much more control of the odds, and losing out to
an adversay involves little physical risk.  As with video games, a player can
be zapped out, yet immediately rise to do battle again.  There is a merging of
fantasy and reality, typified by the macho pseudonyms that some hackers adopt
through bulletin boards.  Mitnick, for example, called himself Condor, after
the title role played by Robert Redford in the movie Three Days of the Condor,
a character that symbolized the isolated loner fighting a corrupt political
establishment.  James Bond and his 007 "licensed to kill" status frequently
crop up in aliases; Mitnick allegedly used Bondian pseudonyms for one of his
hacked telephone accounts.
    What really sets hackers apart is their joy in the process of computing,
reported Harvard University sociologist and psychologist Dr. Sherry Tuckle
after studying the hacking phenomenon at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.  She wrote perceptively about it in her book The Second Self -
Computers and the Human Spirit.
    "Though hackers would deny that theirs is a macho culture, the
preoccupation with winning and subjecting oneself to increasingly violent test
smakes their world peculiarly unfriendly to women," she wrote.  "There is,
too, a flight from relationship with people to relationship with the machine -
a defensive maneuvre more common to men than to women."
    Dr. Turkle found that the MIT hackers engaged in what they called "sport
death," finding in computer programming an addiction to control similar to
that found among some racing drivers and test pilots.  In each case, the
participants push their resources beyond what seems possible, with the hackers
concentrating on giving themselves ever more demanding mental, rather than
phsycial, challenges.  This is why viruses are so facinating to them - and why
the hackers must be understood better as adversaries by those wishing to
protect their systems from invasion.  The hackers' motiviation for
manipulating other people's systems is usually very different from the
motivations for personal gain or revenge involved in other computer crimes.
    "It is a culture of people who have grown up thinking of themselves as
different, apart, and who have a commitment to what one hacker described as
'an ethic of total toleration for anything that in the real world would be
considered strange'," Dr. Turkle wrote.  "The people who want to impost rules,
the inhabitants of the 'real world,' are devalued, as is the 'straight'
computer science community . . . . The hackers have to keep changing and
improving the system.  They have built a cult of prowness that defines itself
in terms of winning over ever-more complex systems."

³SCANNING³
ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

    Of the many things I have done.  Scanning has to be one of the more
lucrative things to do.  With everything you can find when scanning, it is
hard to believe that ANYONE would not scan.  Someday, I'll have to publish a
fone book of scans..ehhee.  Joke maybe, but, we'll see.  I would like to get a
scanning group together to scan directly for HP magazine.  If there is anyone
who would like to be in my scanning group, contact me.
    The below scans are for the 1.800.444.xxxx prefix.  I jumped around a
little bit, but should have TONS more scans by the next issue.  This should
last you a little why though...

³LOOZER LIST³
ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

There have arisen in the Underground and the entire Computer world as a whole,
a group of people, that I can not think of much more of a name for them.  The
simplest thing to call them, are LOOZERS.  I have already recieved threats of
lawsuits and the sort for posting peoples name in the loozer list.  But, I am
not telling anyone to do anything.  It is your choice what you do.  I am
mearly spotlighting those few people, who well, make it tough for all of us to
go forward.  And of everything, I am mearly stating facts.  Home addresses,
fone numbers, entire names, bulletin boards, and what they do.  There is NO
law against that, and if you have something to say about it, say it.  I'm
ready.

This guy (?) is accused of turning classified underground information to
certain Public Doman Sysops including Allen Lee.  Was in the underground for a
short time.  Believes himself to be the best hacker in the world.  Has a habit
of thinking he is superior to the rest of the world.  Very Obnoxious.

Spicoli was busted.  Answers are vague.  Information is being held until
either a court case or questioning comes.  What Spicoli was busted on is still
a mystery.  Hopefully, we will soon know what it was.  I warn all to stay away
from the bridges that Spicoli was calling.  If you know what I'm talking
about, you know what to do.

It is illegal for anyone, including government agencies to put a tap on your
line.  If you think your line is being tapped, call your operator.  Then have
her connect you to repair service.  Tell them you think you are being tapped
and that you would like to have the line checked.  They will usually give you
the number for that Telco's Security Department.  Call them, and they will
check out the line for any sort of tap.  Then give you the option to press
charges, if it can be discovered who is tapping it.

 ³BBS REVIEW?³
 ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

    Well, I must admit, I did run out of time on this magazine. Therefore my
BBS Review and VMB Review will have to wait till next issue.  But I will list
a few good boards that I can think of right off hand.  If I leave you out,
which I probably will, please excuse me, and I will try and get you in the
next issue.

    Dragon's Keep
    Home of HP Magazine
    513.277.6oo6
    12oo/24oo
    NuP OPTIONS
    SysOp-Term Inal aka Dragonlord
    CoSysOp-Genghis Khan
    Running Telegard

    I am Co-SysOp on this board, give it a call.  I have some innovative ideas
in effect on this board including a message base called Phreak Klass.  We have
had a great response for the Phreak Klass Base and hopefully we are producing
some good New Phreakers.  Unlike some I have seen recently who think they know
everything and don't.


    High Voltage
    513.898.8768
    12oo/24oo/96oo/14.4/38.4
    NuP CourierHst
    SysOp-Circuit Breaker
    CoSysOp-Genghis Khan

    I also have co-sysop status on this board.  More oriented towards the
usage part of phreaking and not the fundamentals.  Still a good board to call.
Message bases galore.  But the Circuit Breaker has a past of being a warez
d00d.  I converted him, and he is now half half.  Give it a call. Well worth
it.  Running Telegard.


    Gonzo's Gabanza
    513.89o.o655
    12oo/24oo/96oo/14.4/38.4
    NuP GATE*WAY
    SysOp-Gonzo Merkazoid

    Pretty good H/P board.  Specializes in just about everything.  Many files
to choose from.  Overall, one of the better boards.  Running Telegard.


    Crow Technologies
    513.433.861o
    12oo/24oo
    NuP CORAL
    SysOp-Crow Meister

    Specializes in Virii and Trojans.  If I can remember right, has at least
400 viruses.  And I'm sure that is an old count.  Getting access is difficult.
Easy for me, easy for some.  Those who do not know there stuff need not apply.
Running TcH 3.0.  Very nice board.


    These boards are all local to me. If you have something you would like to
see in HP Magazine or would like to comment on the mag, please leave you
messages on these boards.  Thank you.

 ³CONCLUSION³
 ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ


    I feel somewhat bad about the content of this magazine.  Being the first
issue I hoped to make it great.  But I didn't anticipate how long it would
take.  I am sorry if I let some of you down.  The next issue will be much
better.  Time was ticking down and I had to get this baby out.  So, use what's
in here while you wait another month, till January 6th, 1992.  I will include
AT LEAST 2 Interviews/profiles.  Scans galore, Complete BBS Review.  A VMB
Review.  More Loozers.  More News.  Don't miss it.

    And to all who are reading this.  Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to
you. Let's make the headlines in 1992.
