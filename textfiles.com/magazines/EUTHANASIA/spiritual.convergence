                  SOLAR CEREMONIES SET FOR MARCH 21, 1995

          ELDERS CALL FOR WORLDWIDE CONVERGENCE OF SPIRITUAL INTENT

As with Harmonic Convergence in 1987, the moment of Sunrise on March 21, 1995
marks a crucial opportunity for prayer and ceremony as understood by the
indigenous Mayan people of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico.  Contemporary Mayan
Daykeepers and Traditional Elders have revealed that their sacred texts
identify this date, and "implore the human race to awaken, so that it can
fulfill its sacred destiny, which is to be true sons and daughters of the
Cosmic Light." 

Please consider this message carefully as a call for human beings to unite as
they did at Harmonic Convergence in 1987 (also identified by the ancient Sacred
Calendars of the Americas).  March 21, 1995 is a crucial opportunity to strive
through prayer and ceremony to bridge the gaps between the continents,
religions, cultures, and races for all ages.  It is time, Traditional Maya
Elders say, to live out our true solar destinies.  

By the use of their ancient calendar cycles, widely recognized as far more
accurate than the Gregorian calendars now used by the Western world, the Maya
understand that the 1995 spring equinox is the completion of a prophecy marking
the end of two cycles of Kal'tun (two cycles of 260 years), initiating a time
when ancient and hidden knowledge is to be reawakened.  Don Hunbatz Men, Mayan
Shaman and Daykeeper, emphasizes that this information is for everyone, not
just the Maya.  

                 The Path of the Sun and Mayan Prophecy

The Sun travels 182 days to the North and returns 182 days to the South again
every Earth year.  This is the cycle of the Solstices.  The midpoint of this
cycle is another cycle of East and West called the Equinoxes.  On the Equinoxes
the Sun crosses a center point and makes an exact 90-degree angle directly over
the Pyramid of Ku'Kulkan (El Castillo) at the sacred site of Chichen Itza on
Mexico's Yucatan peninsula.  This creates the world famous phenomenon of a
dramatic shadow of 7 triangles that represent the potential awakening to 7
centers of the human body.  This event happens every Equinox, but it is in the
year 1995 that the reawakening of the cosmic human is to be activated.  This is
indicated in the paraphrased Mayan prophecy below.  

In the year 1475, before the arrival of the Spanish, The Supreme Maya Council
revealed the long-held vision of an ancient Solar Grandmother named X'Nuuk'K'in
that a calendar cycle of twice the Kal'tun of 260 years had to go by in order
for the Solar Culture to flourish again for the benefit of all humanity.  In
the spring of 1995, this 520 year period will be completed.  Thus, 1995 is a
decisive year and the human race will have to enter the path of cosmic light if
it is to remain a thinking species.  Humans will have to seek the path of
initiation on Earth and in Heaven.  Through Solar Initiation they will be able
to see the luminosity of the Great Spirit...  through Solar Initiation, the
sleeping body of humankind can be awakened...  "Hunab K'u (Creator) will flash
like lightening that will pierce through the shadows that envelop the human
race.  Let us prepare to receive the light of knowledge." 

The Maya understand this event as an opportunity for initiation into a luminous
consciousness that will awaken humanity into the Age of Knowledge (Itza Age). 
By the use of the magnetic grid of energy that covers planet Earth, the solar
ceremonies in Chichen Itza will anchor a unifying intent to activate humanity.
This will initiate a potent healing process for all as we enter an age of
knowledge and peace.  We will begin to remember the ancient knowledge of the
cosmos.  

Those who are unable to join the Mayan elders and invited Tibetan Lamas in
ceremony in physical form may join in Spirit.  The Mayan Council has asked
people of good heart -- no matter their race or their spiritual tradition -- to
unite in prayer at Sunrise on the morning of March 21, 1995 with the
understanding that we are all connected and live in the same house, the house
of Mother Earth.  They ask all to send the energy of the Father SUN into Mother
EARTH, giving her essential energy for healing.  You may also send letters of
inspiration and prayer to:  The Center for Mayan Studies APDO 7-014 Merida, 7
Yucatan, Mexico.  These letters will be anchored in a sacred site during this
ceremony.  

                     The Solar Meditation / Ceremony

The Maya had and have an intimate relationship with the Sun.  They know that
the information/energy we require to live comes from the Creator through the
Sun.  They understand that the Sun can heal our physical and emotional
illnesses.  In these times when humanity receives so much of its information
and energy from sources other than the Sun, we must begin to remember how to
work with the Sun.  To receive Solar Initiation one must reconnect with the
Sun.  It is a simple process and all that is needed is your heart's intention.
Below is a solar ceremony you can begin now, and perform in unity with others
from around the world during the Spring Equinox, 1995.  Everyone is encouraged
to initiate solar meditations and related events at Sacred Sites or in the
areas where they live at Sunrise - March, 1995.  

Face the rising Sun and begin to meditate.  With respect, ask the Creator
(Hunab K'u) for permission to reenter cosmic memory.  Ask to be reawakened to
the ancient knowledge of the cosmos.  As the Sun begins to rise look directly
at it.  Use discretion here:  just one second of pure sunlight directly in the
eyes is enough, more can be harmful.  Then close your eyes and begin to say the
name of the SUN in the Mayan language (K'IN) and catch your Spirit by holding
your hands out in front of your face as if you were holding a sphere.  As
Om-m-m is a name for the Universe, K'IN is a name of the SUN.  It sounds like,
"K'ieeeeeennn" with a distinct 'E' sound.  You may need to practice this a
little while to get the habit of it.  When you do it properly you will hear the
sound of the Sun in your ears and in your head.  

Say K'IN seven times into your hands for your body, 7 times for your spirit,
and 7 times for the healing and awakening of the Earth and humanity.  You will
feel the energy in your hands, and hear the sound of the SUN in your heart. 
Now offer the blessings of your Spirit on the Earth by bending down and placing
your palms flat upon the Earth.  Allow your Spirit to enter the Earth and send
your blessings and intentions to walk on Earth in a sacred manner that will
awaken yourself and others into right living once again.  So Traditional Elders
among the Maya have asked.  

                             --O O O O O O--
