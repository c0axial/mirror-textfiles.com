Sunday e-sermon #1 

Greetings, and welcome to the Church of Euthanasia.  Hopefully almost all of
you have received issue number one of our journal by now.  I am sure that many
questions still remain, and I'll try to address the most popular ones, which
are how, and why.  

How did we find you?  A detailed explanation would not be appropriate here, but
suffice it to say that all of you have posted to one or more of the same
newsgroups over the last month or so.  These newsgroups were carefully chosen
for their degree of intersection with the core principles of the church.  We
knew that many would react negatively to our methods, but felt this was
outweighed by the need to make a widespread, immediate impact.  

Why did we do this?  As many of you are no doubt aware, the population summit
concluded this week in Cairo.  If you have been following it in the papers, you
will know that almost nothing of any substance was accomplished.  Most of the
conference was devoted to an acrimonious battle with the new Vatican-Muslim
alliance over whether the various charters that were signed could contain the
words 'abortion' and 'contraception.' 

Meanwhile, entire nations are starving to death, while Americans watch it on
television.  Almost every day for the last month there has been at least one
article in the Boston Globe about overpopulation.  Many of them have stated
clearly that the population is expected to double in twenty years.  This news
might as well be on the sports page:  the spectacle continues without
interruption.  

The turbines still spin, the oil is still sucked out of the earth, the cars and
trucks still poison the air.  The consumers still stand in line in supermarkets
to buy food wrapped in plastic.  The ideals displayed on American television
still dominate the daily lives of billions of human beings.  What will man do
when even the bottled water is poisonous?  What will he do when the air makes
him sick, and the sun is so strong he can't go outside anymore?  

The planet is a living being, and quite capable of self-defense.  If the
two-leggeds cannot control their numbers, she will do it for them, and her
measures will be harsh.  Read the Hopi prophecies.  Many of them have already
come true.  Now is the time of 'koyaanisqatsi,' or 'life out of balance.' 

The Internet is the backbone of the so-called 'cyberculture,' an impossible
vision of the future in which men 'rule' the Earth through machines.  It is for
this reason most of all that we felt it so important to target the Internet. 
Messages were delivered to the Whitehouse, to heads of corporations, to
high-ranking members of the military, to scientists, professors, and just
regular folks.  Needless to say, many of the recipients are upset.  This is a
regrettable, but neccessary consequence of any Dada action.  

Dada turns people upside down, by temporarily destroying one or more of their
everyday assumptions.  The suspension of 'normal' assumptions allows messages
that would ordinarily be screened out to penetrate, even if only for a short
time.  The method is unpleasant, but highly effective when dealing with strong
indoctrination such as that provided by television programming, or university
education, for example.  Internet users are by in large highly educated members
of the elite, and therefore very likely to be indoctrinated.  

The Internet is far more than a communication system, a web of wires and
computers:  the Internet is a set of assumptions, based on the specific
world-view of its creators.  Who are these creators, and what is their
world-view?  The Internet depends directly on the institutions of the consumer
culture, including the federal government, the military, and the universities
and corporations that cooperate with them.  Let us not forget that the Internet
has its roots in ARPAnet (the Department of 'Defense') and NSFnet (the National
'Science' Foundation).  The Defenders of Science.  Why are they defending
science?  Who are they defending it from?  

They are defending it from us, my friends, from the Church of Euthanasia and
many other groups like us who oppose their senseless war with our Mother the
Earth.  Their schools teach that what cannot be measured, does not exist.  This
is Empiricism, the foundation of the spectacle, the principle that Socrates
died for.  Their leaders say that everyone is entitled to as much as they want,
of whatever they want, if they have the money to buy it.  This is the American
Way, of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness for the violent and
ruthless.  Their elites are determined to fight to the bitter end for their
world-view.  Their God is Moloch, who eats his children, leaving only filth,
solitude, and ugliness.  In the words of the Cree People:  

Only after the last tree has been cut down,
Only after the last river has been poisoned,
Only after the last fish has been caught,
Only then will you realize that money cannot be eaten.

Let us pray.

Spirits of the four directions, East, South, West, and North,
Powers of the Elements, Air, Fire, Water, and Earth,
Wheel of the seasons, Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter,
Be here now, as we invoke this sacred space,
And for a moment in time, free ourselves from all limitations,
>From all delusions of separateness.
Be here now, and help us, to draw our spirits down
>From the lonely flights of the ego, into our bodies,
And let us be filled with the joy of your limitless light,
Beyond the bounds of time,
where night and day,
Birth and death,
joy and sorrow,
meet as one.


At this very moment, American warships surround Haiti.
The second time the United States invaded Haiti, in 1915,
it kept troops there for nineteen years.
Let us take a moment of silence,
and extend our hearts to the people of Haiti.


The Circle is open, but unbroken.
