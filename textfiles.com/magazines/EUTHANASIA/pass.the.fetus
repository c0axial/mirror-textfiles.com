Chinese trade in human fetuses for consumption is uncovered

By Yojana Sharma in Hong Kong and Graham Hutchings in Beijing

ABORTED human fetuses intended for human consumption are being sold for as
little as =A31 in the Chinese city of Shenzhen, according to reports in Hong
Kong yesterday.
    The Eastern Express newspaper said journalists from its sister publication,
Eastweek, had gone to Shenzhen, across the border from Hong Kong, to see if
fetuses were being sold. Shenzhen hospitals carried out 7,000 terminations last
year, including a number on Hong Kong women seeking cheap abortions.
    At the state-run Shenzhen Health Centre for Women and Children, a female
doctor was asked for a fetus. The next day, she handed the reporter a
"fist-sized glass bottle stuffed with thumb-sized fetuses".
    The doctor was quoted as saying: "There are 10 fetuses here, all aborted
this morning. You can take them. We are a state hospital and don't charge.
Normally we doctors take them home to eat - all free. Since you don't look
well, you can take them."
    At private clinics, aborted fetuses could be obtained for between =A31 and
=A31.75, the newspaper said. There was no evidence, however, that fetuses were
being sold in large quantities to middlemen for sale in Hong Kong.
    Zou Qin, a doctor working at the Luo Hu Clinic in Shenzhen, said the
fetuses were "nutritious" and claimed to have eaten 100 herself in the past six
months.
    She said the "best" were first-born males from young women. "We don't carry
out abortions just to eat the fetuses," she said, but added that the fetuses
would be "wasted if not eaten". The newspaper said the fetuses were eaten as a
soup, together with pork and ginger.
    A woman doctor, referred to only as Wang, from the Sin Hua Clinic,
Shenzhen, was quoted as saying the fetuses were "even better than placentae" in
nutritional value. "They can make your skin smoother, your body stronger and
are good for kidneys," she said.
    Dr Warren Lee, president of the Hong Kong Nutrition Association, said:
"Eating fetuses is a traditional Chinese medicine deeply founded in folklore."
However, he considered the alleged properties of fetuses little more than
old-wives' tales. Others said the practice was abhorrent.
    Dr. Cao Shilin, of the Hospital of Chinese medicine in Shenzhen, said
aborted embryos were taken to factories where they were used in the production
of medicines.  She did not know if any were sold to private individuals, but
said there was little medical value in embryos older than eight weeks when, in
Chinese terms, they were classified as fetuses.
    She had not heard of fetuses being sold in Shenzhen, but warned that eating
them could be dangerous, given the strong medicines used in abortions.
    A doctor in Beijing, who declined to be named, said parts of fetuses would
have medical value, singling out the liver as something that could help to cure
anaemia.  But hospitals in Beijing had ovens for the destruction of aborted
fetuses, and she had not heard that they had been sold for individual
consumption.
    The sale and consumption of placentae is common in China, though frowned
upon by the authorities. Only those with good connections to the medical world
can obtain placentae, which cost between =A32.50 and =A33 each.
    According to traditional Chinese medicine, it is regarded as particularly
beneficial for a nursing mother to eat her own placenta because it improves her
milk. It is usually drunk in the form of a soup.

Sounds delicious!  And while we're on the subject, I'd like to share a little
correspondence with you.  We get a lot of peculiar mail here, but this one
really took the cake.

Congratulations on your hilariously facetious portrayal of abortion as a means
of population control.  The positions stated on your Web page show to what
absurdities abortion could lead.  It simply devalues man to nothing.  I hope
this is blunt enough for all those pro-aborts out there.  Have a blessed
Easter!

Looks like the joke's on you, Dominik.  It must be tough getting through life
with the cranial capacity of a chipmunk.  We are pro-abortion.  Shall I say it
again?  Pro-abortion, Dominik, as in sucking human fetuses out of vaginas with
a bloody great vacuum.  Now Dominik, you're not a vegetarian, are you?  Does
the thought of eating flesh bother you?  I hope not, because we think pro-life
cretins like you should be munching on those fetuses, Dominik.  That's right,
not only are we pro-abortion, we are also pro-cannibalism, as you would have
discovered if you were capable of comprehending anything other than the
Reader's Digest edition of the bible.  And I'll bet you do read the bible,
Dominik, don't you, so you'll be delighted to know that we're also pro-sodomy.
Yes indeed, the only thing we'd like better than watching you dine on mangled
human fetuses would be watching you get fucked up the ass with a giant rosary,
while our entire board of directors take turns peeing in your mouth.  Of
course you'd probably rather kill yourself than submit to such an ungodly
invasion of your sacred sphincter, and that's just fine with us.  I hate to be
pushy, but it's time to go.  We'll all be much better off.  Eat a queer fetus
for Jesus, Dominik, and then SAVE THE PLANET--KILL YOURSELF!
