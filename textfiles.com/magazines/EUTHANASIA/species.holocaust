[The cover of the Church of Euthanasia's new CD "Six Billion Humans Can't
Be Wrong" features a photograph of Rev. Korda naked inside one of the
ovens at the Dachau crematorium.  The German music magazine "Beam" has
charged Rev. Korda with anti-semitism, and the following is Rev. Korda's
response.  The photo URL is http://www.freespeech.org/coe/dachau.jpg]

Nationalists believe that one group of humans is superior to all others.
Concentration camps are a well-known symbol of what happens when this
belief is carried to its extreme.  Dachau has been preserved as a
monument, to remind visitors that something shameful happened there. 
National shame has had positive consequences: patriotic displays are
still discouraged in Germany to this day.

Humanists believe that one species is superior to all others.  This
belief has also been carried to its extreme, with an equally predictable
result: the extinction of at least a third of the non-human species on
earth, over a period of a few thousand years.  The pre-human rate of
extinction is estimated at one species from any major group every
million years.  By comparison, a species currently disappears every
thirty minutes.  

The Jews suffered terribly, but any sane person will admit that there
are still Jews in the world.  The same can't be said for the millions of
plant and animal species that have become extinct as a result of the
human population explosion.  Where are the symbols of this species
holocaust?  Where are the monuments to remind us that something shameful
has happened, and is still happening, every day, faster and faster?

The Nazis stabilized the currency, built autobahns, and restored
national pride.  Many Germans were grateful, and avoided asking too many
questions.  It was better not to know where the trains were going,
because knowing would mean either accepting guilt, or fighting the
Nazis.  Today, citizens of the industrial nations are in much the same
position.  Each year, there are more cars, computers, and shopping malls
filled with merchandise.  It's better not to know where the oil is
coming from, or where the garbage is going.  It's better not to know
that the earth is poisoned.  Why spoil the fun?

The Holocaust was not an exception, but the rule, the extension of
industrial technology to the extermination of humans, rather than
insects or plants.  The railroads and crematoriums were familiar,
because the same techniques had already been applied to animals for
decades.  In the United States, one billion animals are slaughtered
every year, in factory farms that look suspiciously like concentration
camps.  It's better not to think about this, while we watch the flesh
cooking in our ovens.

By August of 1999, the human population will exceed six billion. 
Wilderness will continue to vanish like smoke, and with it the
biological diversity that keeps the planet habitable.  A planet of
weeds, on which only rats, roaches, pigeons and humans thrive, is not
only ugly and shameful, it is the next step towards a desert planet. 
Members of the Church of Euthanasia take a lifetime vow to never have
children.  This is one way of facing the shame, and taking personal
responsibility for allowing the earth to heal.
