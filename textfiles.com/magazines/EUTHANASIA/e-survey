WAIT!!!  PLEASE!!!  BEFORE YOU COMPLAIN TO THE POSTMASTER!!!

IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE YOURSELF FROM THIS LIST FOR ANY REASON
just send an email to listserv@netcom.com containing only the line:

unsubscribe snuffit-l

We are aware that some of you did not request subscriptions to this list.
The problem stems from names that were copied from the "ThoughtCriminals"
list on neonate.atl.ga at the request of one of their members.

We are doing everything we can to rectify the situation, but unfortunately
many people are choosing to complain to the postmaster instead of complaining
to us, so we have no simple way of telling who wants to be unsubscribed.
By far the SIMPLEST SOLUTION is for YOU to just UNSUBSCRIBE YOURSELF.

We APOLOGIZE for any inconvenience!  We're doing the best we can!  If you
must flame us, at least send it here to coe@netcom.com, so we can read it.
If you don't want to be on the list, DO NOT READ THE REST OF THIS E-MAIL!

-Pastor Scott
