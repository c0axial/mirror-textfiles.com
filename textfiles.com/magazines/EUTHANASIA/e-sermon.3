Sunday e-sermon #3

Dear brethren, today I have a special surprise in store for all of you.  Today
we have with us none other than the amazing Yanni Cooper!  Yanni is a real live
Snuff It-thumping environmental extremist, a loyal follower of the church, and
I'm proud to call him my friend.  He will be delivering today's sermon, and I
suggest you all hold on to your benches and pews, because otherwise they might
blow right over!  But first, before we get started, let me take this
opportunity to thank ALL of you who came to last Sunday's picnic.  It was a
roaring success, and there were many enlightening conversations.  Later
everyone got very drunk, volleyball was played naked in the mud, and several
acts of public sodomy were performed, one of which I still have bruises from,
but never mind.  On a more serious note, those of you who still follow the
Spectacle will know that at the last minute, thanks in large part to YOUR
earnest prayers, the tiny island of Haiti was NOT saturation-bombed into the
stone age by the B-52s of the United States Air Force.  Gaia be praised.  With
your continued prayers, the situation is bound to further improve.  I've said
it before and I'll say it again: why waste money on the military when people
need to die right here at home!  And now, without further ado, let's hear it
for Yanni "moise" Babatunde Cooper!

(microphone adjusting, howling feedback, etc.)

I'm sick of hearing about inner city violence.  I'm sick of hearing about the
millions starving every day.  It's a historically proven fact that the best way
to prevent war is to have the populace of one or both countries die off from a
famine or plague or something.  I mean, almost no one wants to conquer a desert
filled with starving babies and lepers and raving lunatics.

The biggest problem in the world today, the largest cause of suffering and
pain, the biggest contributor to the unbalancing of the ecosystems of Gaia and
destruction of whole species, is none other than you, the gentle reader.
Gentle my ass!

Maybe you consider yourself to be "environmentally conscious".  Sure but do you
drive a car?  "Oh but it passes the emissions test" you say.  So?  That is just
what the current governmental body think is the amount they can allow you to
pollute the atmosphere, with out it effecting their chances of getting
reelected.  And riding a bike instead doesn't help that much even though it is
better then a car.  Do you have any idea how much waste is made in the creation
of just ONE bicycle?

You recycle?  Bravo, well done.  Though unless you live off soda most likely
you recycle less than 10-15% of your waste.  Boy is that going to save the
environment.  Chances are that you aren't buying recycled materials either.
Oh, you are?  Well I'm sorry then I guess you ARE environmentally conscious;
except that most likely what you are buying is not really recycled material.
To be truly recycled it has to be 100% P.C.W.  (post-consumer waste).  That
means someone used something previously, recycled it and now you are using bits
of it again.  Most things touted as "recycled" nowadays are merely the using of
the scrap left over from the creation of other products.  Legally companies are
allowed to put recycled on it because it is technically using something that
has been previously used.  But they would have used it anyway.  And even if
they do contain P.C.W. most products are still 70-85% virgin products or post
industrial waste (the scraps I was telling you about earlier).  Chances are
that no matter how environmentally conscious you think you are, you aren't.
Well maybe you are a member of Green Peace or some other "Save the Animals"
type club.  Fat lot of good that will do.  Most of that money you send them
every couple of months merely goes into someone's pocket or towards recruiting
new members to give them more money.

Oh, wait, what is that?  You're a vegetarian?  So instead of having a bunch of
cows destroy 12 acres or so of arable land for you, you will just defoliate
one.  Good job.  But then you are not a true vegetarian are you?  You eat dairy
products, or chicken, or fish.  So I guess vegans are the only ones I can't
chew out for being "unconscious" of what they are doing to the environment.
Except that, as usual, I can.  See they are still helping to destroy the
harmonic balance the earth had, just cause there are so damn many of them.
"O.K.," you say "I guess I am always in the wrong, but what can I do about it?"
I'll tell you what you can do.  Stop.  Stop using the world's precious
resources.  Stop procreating like crazed weasels.  Stop eating ten times what
you need to just because you can.  Stop eating period.  Join the Church of
Euthanasia.  Kill yourself!

Yes you heard me right.  I am telling you to snuff your light out.  You and
everyone one else reading this.  That is the most socially acceptable way of
reducing the world population, and stopping this horrid calamity that has been
visited upon our mother earth, which happens to be called the human race.  I am
sure many people will be offend by this letter but that is all right.  Many
animals are offended when we spill oil all over their homes.  Many more are
offended at being raised with ten cubic inches of breathing space just to be
eaten.  If you step back a little and look at the Earth you can tell she is
offended by all the shit we have done to her.  If you want more information on
the Church of Euthanasia I can get it to you.  If you just off yourself or can
help some one else off themselves you will be just as valuable though.
