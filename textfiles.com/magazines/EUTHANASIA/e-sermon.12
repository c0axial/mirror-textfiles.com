Today's sermon will be delivered by the immortal Jacques Ellul, grandfather of
the Situationists and author of _The Technological Society_.  According to
Ellul, "what characterizes technical action within a particular activity is the
search for greater *efficiency*."  Technique, as Ellul defines it, is truly the
great weakness of the tool-wielding apes.  In the words of Robert Merton, ours
is "a civilization committed to the quest for continually improved means to
carelessly examined ends.  Indeed technique transforms ends into means. . . .
The Technical Man is fascinated by results, by the immediate consequences of
setting standardized devices into motion."  The glittering Spectacle feeds on
this passive quality of fascination; in the Age of Absorption, we de-evolve
into mere automatons, eyeballs with fingers.  When every individual agrees that
a single most efficient technique exists for every objective, and that these
techniques can and should be arrived at, all is lost.  How can we defeat the
overwhelming logic of efficiency?  Surely not with technique; we become what we
resist.  Only individual transformation can stem the tide; the spread of
enlightenment becomes our greatest responsibility.  John Wilkinson said of
Ellul that "To him, to *bear witness to the fact* of the technological society
is the most revolutionary of all acts."  We share Ellul's profound conviction,
as well as his hope, that humans may yet prove stronger than the powers they
invoke.  Dear brethren, I give you, Jacques Ellul.

    The term *technique*, as I use it, does not mean machines, technology, or
this or that procedure for attaining an end.  In our technological society,
*technique is the totality of methods rationally arrived at and having absolute
efficiency* (for a given stage of development) in *every* field of human
activity.
    It is said (and everyone agrees) that the machine has created an inhuman
atmosphere.  The machine, so characteristic of the nineteenth century, made an
abrupt entrance into a society which, from the political, institutional, and
human points of view, was not made to receive it; and man has had to put up
with it as best he can.  Men now live in conditions that are less than human.
Consider the concentration of our great cities, the slums, the lack of space,
of air, time, the gloomy streets and sallow lights that confuse night and day.
Think of our dehumanized factories, our unsatisfied senses. . . . our
estrangement from nature.  Life in such an environment has no meaning.
Consider our public transportation, in which man is less important than a
parcel; our hospitals, in which he is only a number.  Yet we call this
progress. . . .
    It must be emphasized that, at present, technique is applied outside
industrial life.  The growth of its power today has no relation to the growing
use of the machine.  The balance seems rather to have shifted to the other
side.  It is the machine which is now entirely dependent on technique, and the
machine represents only a small part of technique.  If we were to characterize
the relations between technique and the machine today, we could say not only
that the machine is the result of a certain technique, but also that its social
and economic applications are made possible by other technical advances.  The
machine is now not even the most important aspect of technique (though it is
perhaps the most Spectacular); technique has taken over all of man's
activities, not just his productive activity.
    From another point of view, however, the machine is deeply symptomatic: it
represents the ideal toward which technique strives.  The machine is solely,
exclusively, technique; it is pure technique, one might say.  For wherever a
technical factor exists, it results, almost inevitably, in mechanization:
technique transforms everything it touches into a machine.
    It is an illusion--unfortunately very widespread--to think that because we
have broken through the prohibitions, taboos, and rites that bound primitive
man, we have become free.  We are conditioned by something new: technological
civilization.   I make no reference to a past period of history in which men
were allegedly free, happy, and independent.  The determinisms of the past no
longer concern us; they are finished and done with.  If I do refer to the past,
it is only to emphasize that present determinants did not exist in the past,
and men did not have to grapple with them.
    In my conception, freedom is not an immutable fact graven in nature and on
the heart of man.  It is not inherent in man or in society, and it is
meaningless to write it into law.  The mathematical, physical, biological,
sociological, and psychological sciences reveal nothing but necessities and
determinisms on all sides.  As a matter of fact, reality is itself a
combination of determinisms, and freedom consists in overcoming and
transcending these determinisms.  Freedom is completely without meaning unless
it is related to necessity. . . . We must not think of the problem in terms of
a choice between being determined and being free.  We must look at it
dialectically, and say that man is indeed determined, but that it is open to
him to overcome necessity, and that this *act* is freedom.  Freedom is not
static but dynamic; not a vested interest, but a prize continually to be won.
The moment man stops and resigns himself, he becomes subject to determinism.
He is most enslaved when he thinks he is comfortably settled in freedom.
    In the modern world, the most dangerous form of determinism is the
technological phenomenon.  It is not a question of getting rid of it, but, by
an act of freedom, of transcending it.  How is this to be done?  I do not yet
know.  That is why [I] appeal to the individual's sense of responsibility.  The
first step in the quest, the first act of freedom, is to become aware of the
necessity.  The very fact that man can see, measure, and analyze the
determinisms that press on him means that he can face them and, by so doing,
act as a free man.  If man were to say: "These are not necessities; I am free
because of technique, or despite technique," this would prove that he is
totally determined.  However, by grasping the real nature of the technological
phenomenon, and the extent to which it is robbing him of freedom, he confronts
the blind mechanisms as a conscious being.
    If man--if each one of us--abdicates his responsibilities with regard to
values; if each of us limits himself to leading a trivial existence in a
technological civilization, with greater adaptation and increasing success as
his sole objectives; if we do not even consider making a stand against these
determinants, then everything *will* happen as I have described it, and the
determinants *will* be transformed into inevitabilities. . . .
    [My] purpose is to arouse. . . . an awareness of technological necessity
and what it means.  It is a call to the sleeper to awake.
