I need to get [a vasectomy].
What is the name of the group that helps finance them?
Where can I contact them?

The vasectomy ministry is an off-shoot of VHEMT (the Voluntary Human
Extinction Movement), one of our sister organizations.  The vasectomy
ministry raises money to provide free vasectomies, and they also make
nifty stickers that say "Vasectomy Prevents Abortion."

You can reach the ministry at this address:

Respect For Life
4326 Woodstock Blvd #419
Portland, OR 97206-6270

If you have any trouble reaching them, contact Les. U. Knight at VHEMT:

These EXIT Times
P.O.Box 86646
Portland, OR 97286-0646

Thou shalt not procreate.
