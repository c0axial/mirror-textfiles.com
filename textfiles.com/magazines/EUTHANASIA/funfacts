The following facts are drawn from "Diet for a New America" by John Robbins,
and other sources.  For a printed booklet called "Realities for the 90's,"
which contains most of these facts, including footnotes, please send $1 to:

EarthSave Foundation
706 Frederick Street
Santa Cruz, CA 95062-2205
(408)-423-4069

We love them, but the feeling is NOT mutual so please don't mention us.

Create your own DADA event!  Print out these facts, get a bunch of
friends together, and head for the nearest overpopulated area.  Give
each person a few pages, and then read them all out LOUD, simultaneously.
The more people reading different things at once, the better.  The effect
is overwhelming; we've seen it work many times, and it's completely legal.
It's even better if you're wearing "Save the Planet, Kill Yourself" T-shirts.
Skull masks are nice, but be sure to cut a big enough hole for your mouth.
