We heard too little for too long.  It seemed that Clipper was
losing steam.  Industry has not been thrilled with the idea,
more and more major software companies are deploying non-Escrowed
RSA encryption in consumer products, comments received by NIST
ran like two-hundred-something to one against, Clipper was
widely criticized and parodied, people behind it were demoted, etc.

This batch of press releases makes it look to me like the Clinton 
Administration is really determined to push it through.  Bad News.

Some personal news:  I've got my sun3 at home up and running live on
the Internet via The Little Garden (you remember the blurb we
surfpunked back in december) and I've almost got DNS working and its
domain name registered.  I've been putting time into this and also into
writing cryptographic tools.  I got my licensed copy of PGP from
ViaCrypt but still need a DOS box or emulator of my own to run it on.
(Call ViaCrypt in Phoenix AZ to order yours.)   I'll continue
publishing Surfpunk as interesting material appears, but I'm not
scouring the net myself these days as much as I used to, and I just
haven't found that much I thought interesting enough to qualify for
Surfpunk.  We'll probably continue to be low-volume for a while -- but
you probably get enough junk in the mail already, right?           strick

Subject: Alert--Admin. names escrow agents, no compromise on Clipper - 7 files

EFF Press Release            04/04/94             * DISTRIBUTE WIDELY *

At two briefings, Feb. 4, 1994, the Clinton Administration and various
agencies gave statements before a Congressional committee, and later
representatives of civil liberties organizations, industry spokespersons
and privacy advocates.  The Electronic Frontier Foundation's position,
based on what we have seen and heard from the Administration today, is
that the White House is set on a course that pursues Cold War national
security and law enforcement interests to the detriment of individual
privacy and civil liberties.

The news is grim.  The Administration is:

 * not backing down on Clipper
 * not backing down on key escrow
 * not backing down on selection of escrow agents
 * already adamant on escrowed key access procedures
 * not willing to elminate ITAR restrictions
 * hiding behind exaggerated threats of "drug dealers" and "terrorists"

The material released to the industry and advocacy version of the briefing
have been placed online at ftp.eff.org (long before their online
availability from goverment access sites, one might add).  See below for
specific details.

No information regarding the Congressional committee version of the briefing
has been announced.  EFF Director Jerry Berman, who attended the private
sector meeting, reported the following:

"The White House and other officials briefed industry on its Clipper chip
and encryption review. While the review is not yet complete, they have
reached several policy conclusions.  First, Clipper will be proposed as
a new Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) next Wednesday. [Feb.
9]  It will be "vountary" for government agencies and the private sector
to use. They are actively asking other vendors to jump in to make the
market a Clipper market. Export licensing processes will be speeded up but
export restrictions will not be lifted in the interests of national
security. The reason was stated bluntly at the briefing : to frustrate
competition with clipper by other powerful encryption schemes by making
them  difficult to market, and to "prevent" strong encryption from leaving
the country thus supposedly making the job of law enforcement and
intelligence more difficult.  Again in the interest of national security. Of
course, Clipper will be exportable but they would not comment on how other
governments will view this.  Treasury and NIST will be the escrow agents
and Justice asserted that there was no necessity for legislation to
implement the escrow procedures.

"I asked if there would be a report to explain the rationale for choosing
these results - we have no explanation of the Administration's thinking, or
any brief in support of the results. They replied that there would be no
report because they have been unable to write one, due to the complexity of
the issue.

"One Administation spokesperson said this was the Bosnia of
Telecommunications. I asked, if this was so, how, in the absense of some
policy explanation, could we know if our policy here will be as successful
as our policy in Bosnia?"

STATEMENT OF THE VICE PRESIDENT

Today's announcements on encryption represent important steps in
the implementation of the Administration's policy on this critical
issue. Our policy is designed to provide better encryption to
individuals and businesses while ensuring that the needs of law
enforcement and national security are met.

Encryption is a law and order issue since it can be used by criminals
to thwart wiretaps and avoid detection and prosecution. It also has
huge strategic value. Encryption technology and cryptoanalysis
turned the tide in the Pacific and elsewhere during World War II.

ATTORNEY GENERAL MAKES KEY ESCROW ENCRYPTION ANNOUNCEMENTS

Attorney General Janet Reno today announced selection of the two
U.S. Government entities that will hold the escrowed key
components for encryption using the key escrow encryption method.
At the same time, the Attorney General made public procedures
under which encryption key components will be released to
government agencies for decrypting communications subject to
lawful wiretaps.

Key Escrow Encryption (formerly referred to as Clipper Chip )
strikes an excellent balance between protection of communications
privacy and protection of society. It permits the use in
commercial telecommunications products of chips that provide
extremely strong encryption, but can be decrypted, when necessary,
by government agencies conducting legally authorized wiretaps.
Decryption is accomplished by use of keys--80-bit binary numbers--
that are unique to each individual encryption chip. Each unique
key is in turn split into two components, which must be recombined
in order to decrypt communications. Knowing one component does not
make decryption any more feasible than not knowing either one.

The two escrow agents are the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST), a part of the Department of Commerce, and the
Automated Systems Division of the Department of the Treasury. The
two escrow agents were chosen because of their abilities to
safeguard sensitive information, while at the same time being able
to respond in a timely fashion when wiretaps encounter encrypted
communications. In addition, NIST is responsible for establishing
standards for protection of sensitive, unclassified information in
Federal computer systems.

The escrow agents will act under strict procedures, which are
being made public today, that will ensure the security of the key
components and govern their release for use in conjunction with
lawful wiretaps. They will be responsible for holding the key
components: for each chip, one agent will hold one of the key
components, and the second agent will hold the other. Neither will
release a key component, except to a government agency with a
requirement to obtain it in connection with a lawfully authorized
wiretap. The system does not change the rules under which
government agencies are authorized to conduct wiretaps.

When an authorized government agency encounters suspected key-
escrow encryption, a written request will have to be submitted to
the two escrow agents. The request will, among other things, have
to identify the responsible agency and the individuals involved;
certify that the agency is involved in a lawfully authorized
wiretap; specify the wiretap's source of authorization and its
duration; and specify the serial number of the key-escrow
encryption chip being used. In every case, an attorney involved in
the investigation will have to provide the escrow agents assurance
that a validly authorized wiretap is being conducted.

Upon receipt of a proper request, the escrow agents will transmit
their respective key components to the appropriate agency. The
components will be combined within a decrypt device, which only
then will be able to decrypt communications protected by key-
escrow encryption. When the wiretap authorization ends, the device
s ability to decrypt communications using that particular chip
will also be ended.

The Department of Justice will, at the various stages of the
process, take steps to monitor compliance with the procedures.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE
CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S ENCRYPTION POLICY

Q. 	What were the findings of the encryption technology review?

A. 	The review confirmed that sound encryption technology is 
needed to help ensure that digital information in both computer 
and telecommunications systems is protected against unauthorized 
disclosure or tampering. It also verified the importance of 
preserving the ability of law enforcement to understand encrypted 
communications when conducting authorized wiretaps. Key escrow 
technology meets these objectives.

Specific decisions were made to enable federal agencies and the 
private sector to use the key escrow technology on a voluntary 
basis and to allow the export of key escrow encryption products.

In addition, the Department of State will streamline export 
licensing procedures for products that can be exported under 
current regulations in order to help U.S. companies to sell their 
products abroad.

To meet the critical need for ways to verify the author and sender 
of an electronic message -- something that is crucial to business 
applications for the National Information Infrastructure -- the 
federal government is committed to ensuring the availability of a 
royalty-free, public-domain Digital Signature Standard.

Finally, an interagency working group has been established to 
continue to address these issues and to maintain a dialogue with 
industry and public interest groups.

Q. 	 Who has been consulted during this review? The Congress? 
Industry? What mechanism is there for continuing consultation?

A.	 Following the President's directive announced on April 16, 
1993, extensive discussions have been held with Congress, 
industry, and privacy rights groups on encryption issues. Formal 
public comment was solicited on the Escrowed Encryption Standard 
and on a wide variety of issues related to the review through the 
Computer System Security and Privacy Advisory Board.

The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and the 
National Security Council will chair the interagency working 
group. The group will seek input from the private sector both 
informally and through several existing advisory committees. It 
also will work closely with the Information Policy Committee of 
the Information Infrastructure Task Force, which is responsible 
for coordinating Administration telecommunications and information 
policy.

Q. 	If national security and law enforcement interests require 
continued export controls of encryption, what specific benefits 
can U.S. encryption manufacturers expect?

A.	The reforms will simplify encryption product export licensing 
and speed the review of encryption product exports. Among other 
benefits, manufacturers should see expedited delivery of products, 
reduced shipping and reporting costs, and fewer individual license 
requests -- especially for small businesses that cannot afford 
international distributors. A personal exemption for business 
travellers using encryption products will eliminate delays and 
inconvenience when they want to take encryption products out of 
the U.S. temporarily.

Q.	Why is the key escrow standard being adopted?

A.	The key escrow mechanism will provide Americans and 
government agencies with encryption products that are more secure, 
more convenient, and less expensive than others readily available 
today -- while at the same time meeting the legitimate needs of 
law enforcement.

Q. 	Will the standard be mandatory?

A. 	No. The Administration has repeatedly stressed that the key 
escrow technology, and this standard, is for voluntary use by 
federal and other government agencies and by the private sector. 
The standard that is being issued only applies to federal agencies 
-- and it is voluntary.

Does this approach expand the authority of government agencies to 
listen in on phone conversations?

No Key escrow technology provides government agencies with no 
[sic] new authorities to access the content of the private 
conversations of Americans.

Q.	Will the devices be exportable? Will other devices that use 
the government hardware?

A.	Yes. After an initial review of the product, the State 
Department will permit the export of devices incorporating key 
escrow technology to most end users. One of the attractions of 
this technology is the protection it can give to U.S. companies 
operating at home and abroad.

Q.	Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a 
drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using 
the device. What would they have to do to decipher the message?

A.	They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a 
court order, to do the wiretap in the first place. They would then 
present documentation, including a certification of this 
authorization, to the two entities responsible for safeguarding 
the keys. (The key is split into component parts, which are stored 
separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow 
system.) They then obtain the components for the keys for the 
device being used by the drug smugglers. The components are then 
combined and the message can be read.

Q.	Who will hold the escrowed keys?

A.	The Attorney General has selected two U.S. agencies to hold 
the escrowed key components: the Treasury Department's Automated 
Systems Division and the Commerce Department's National Institute 
of Standards and Technology.

Q.	How strong is the security in the device? How can I be sure 
how strong the security is?

A.	This system is more secure than many other voice encryption 
system readily available today. While the algorithm upon which the 
Escrowed Encryption Standard is based will remain classified to 
protect the security of the system, an independent panel of 
cryptography experts found that the algorithm provides significant 
protection. In fact, the panel concluded that it will be 36 years 
until the cost of breaking the algorithm will be equal to the cost 
of breaking the current Data Encryption Standard now being used.

Q.	Is there a "trap door" that would allow unauthorized access 
to the keys?

A.	No. There is no trapdoor.

Q.	Whose decision was it to propose this product?

A.	The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the 
Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in this 
decision. The approach has been endorsed by the President, the 
Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet officials.

AUTHORIZATION PROCEDURES FOR RELEASE OF ENCRYPTION KEY COMPONENTS    
     IN CONJUNCTION WITH INTERCEPTS PURSUANT TO TITLE III

The following are the procedures for the release of escrowed key 
components in conjunction with lawfully authorized interception of 
communications encrypted with a key-escrow encryption method. 
These procedures cover all electronic surveillance conducted 
pursuant to Title III of the Omnibus crime Control and Safe 
Streets Act of 1968, as amended (Title III), Title 18, United 
States Code, Section 2510 et seq.

	1) In each case there shall be a legal authorization for the 
interception of wire and/or electronic communications.

	2) All electronic surveillance court orders under Title III 
shall contain provisions authorizing after-the-fact minimization, 
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 2518(5), permitting the interception and 
retention of coded communications, including encrypted 
communications.

	3) In the event that federal law enforcement agents discover 
during the course of any lawfully authorized interception that 
communications encrypted with a key escrow encryption method are 
being utilized, they may obtain a certification from the 
investigative agency conducting the investigation, or the Attorney 
General of the United States or designee thereof. Such 
certification shall

		(a) identify the law enforcement agency or other 
authority conducting the interception and the person providing the 
certification; 

		(b) certify that necessary legal authorization has been 
obtained to conduct electronic surveillance regarding these 
communications; 

		(c) specify the termination date of the period for which 
interception has been authorized; 

		(d) identify by docket number or other suitable method 
of specification the source of the authorization;

		(e) certify that communications covered by that 
authorization are being encrypted with a key-escrow encryption 
method;

		(f) specify the identifier (ID) number of the key escrow 
encryption chip providing such encryption; and

		(g) specify the serial (ID) number of the key-escrow 
decryption device that will be used by the law enforcement agency 
or other authority for decryption of the intercepted 
communications.

	4) The agency conducting the interception shall submit this 
certification to each of the designated key component escrow 
agents. If the certification has been provided by an investigative 
agency, as soon thereafter as practicable, an attorney associated 
with the United States Attorney's Office supervising the 
investigation shall provide each of the key component escrow 
agents with written confirmation of the certification.

	5) Upon receiving the certification from the requesting 
investigative agency, each key component escrow agent shall 
release the necessary key component to the requesting agency. The 
key components shall be provided in a manner that assures they 
cannot be used other than in conjunction with the lawfully 
authorized electronic surveillance for which they were requested.

	6) Each of the key component escrow agents shall retain a 
copy of the certification of the requesting agency, as well as the 
subsequent confirmation of the United States Attorney's Office. In 
addition, the requesting agency shall retain a copy of the 
certification and provide copies to the following for retention in 
accordance with normal record keeping requirements:

		(a) the United States Attorney's Office supervising the 
investigation, and
		
		(b) the Department of Justice, Office of Enforcement 
Operations.

	7) Upon, or prior to, completion of the electronic 
surveillance phase of the investigation, the ability of the 
requesting agency to decrypt intercepted communications shall 
terminate, and the requesting agency may not retain the key 
components.

	8) The Department of Justice shall, in each such case,

		(a) ascertain the existence of authorizations for 
electronic surveillance in cases for which escrowed key components 
have been released;

		(b) ascertain that key components for a particular key 
escrow encryption chip are being used only by an investigative 
agency authorized to conduct electronic surveillance of 
communications encrypted with that chip; and 

		(c) ascertain that, no later than the completion of the 
electronic surveillance phase of the investigation, the ability of 
the requesting agency to decrypt intercepted communications is 
terminated.

	9) In reporting to the Administrative Office of the United 
States Courts pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 2519(2), the Assistant 
Attorney General for the Criminal Division shall, with respect to 
any order for authorized electronic surveillance for which 
escrowed encryption components were released and used for 
decryption, specifically note that fact.

These procedures do not create, and are not intended to create, 
any substantive rights for individuals intercepted through 
electronic surveillance, and noncompliance with these procedures 
shall not provide the basis for any motion to suppress or other 
objection to the introduction of electronic surveillance evidence 
lawfully acquired.

AUTHORIZATION PROCEDURES FOR RELEASE OF ENCRYPTION KEY COMPONENTS
         IN CONJUNCTION WITH INTERCEPTS PURSUANT TO FISA

The following are the procedures for the release of escrowed key 
components in conjunction with lawfully authorized interception of 
communications encrypted with a key-escrow encryption method. 
These procedures cover all electronic surveillance conducted 
pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), Pub. 
L. 95-511, which appears at Title 50, U.S. Code, Section 1801 et 
seq.

	1 ) In each case there shall be a legal authorization for the 
interception of wire and/or electronic communications.

	2) In the event that federal authorities discover during the 
course of any lawfully authorized interception that communications 
encrypted with a key-escrow encryption method are being utilized, 
they may obtain a certification from an agency authorized to 
participate in the conduct of the interception, or from the 
Attorney General of the United States or designee thereof. Such 
certification shall

		(a) identify the agency participating in the conduct of 
the interception and the person providing the certification;

		to conduct electronic surveillance regarding these 
communications;

		(c) specify the termination date of the period for which 
interception has been authorized;

		(d) identify by docket number or other suitable method 
of specification the source of the authorization;

		(e) certify that communications covered by that 
authorization are being encrypted with a key-escrow encryption 
method;

decryption device that will be used by the agency participating in 
the conduct of the interception for decryption of the intercepted 
communications.

	4) This certification shall be submitted to each of the 
designated key component escrow agents. If the certification has 
been provided by an agency authorized to participate in the 
conduct of the interception, a copy shall be provided to the 
Department of Justice, Office of Intelligence Policy and Review. 
As soon as possible, an attorney associated with that office shall 
provide each of the key component escrow agents with written 
confirmation of the certification.

	5) Upon receiving the certification, each key component 
escrow agent shall release the necessary key component to the 
agency participating in the conduct of the interception. The key 
components shall be provided in a manner that assures they cannot 
be used other than in conjunction with the lawfully authorized 
electronic surveillance for which they were requested.

	6) Each of the key component escrow agents shall retain a 
copy of the certification, as well as the subsequent written 
confirmation of the Department of Justice, Office of Intelligence 
Policy and Review.

	7) Upon, or prior to, completion of the electronic 
surveillance phase of the investigation, the ability of the agency 
participating in the conduct of the interception to decrypt 
intercepted communications shall terminate, and such agency may 
not retain the key components.

	8)   The Department of Justice shall, in each such case,

		(a) ascertain the existence of authorizations for 
electronic surveillance in cases for which escrowed key components 
have been released;

		(b) ascertain that key components for a particular key 
escrow encryption chip are being used only by an agency authorized 
to participate in the conduct of the interception of 
communications encrypted with that chip; and 

		(c) ascertain that, no later than the completion of the 
electronic surveillance phase of the investigation, the ability of 
the agency participating in the conduct of the interception to 
decrypt intercepted communications is terminated.
