Subject: [surfpunk-0100] TLG: an Internet buyers club 

I've personally been interested in finding out more about The Little
Garden.  [Thanks for writing, Tom!]   I've got my sun3 at home running
again, and would like to back-door IP to friends with macintoshes, etc.  
This sounds like the kind of net I'd like to join & extend...

I think it's time to create little (& big) private nets and extra
connectivity where ever we can.     --strick

Just wanted to say, I subscribed after seeing you in some WWW listing,
and lo, I was not disappointed. Thanks. 

The recent noise re: commercialization is especially fun. I come from
another world, FidoNet, where we all had to pay our own way, never
having had sugar-daddies in the form of R+E funding and suchlike.
(Though FidoNet has it's own quite militant anti-commercial fanaticism,
it's out of recognition of the likelyhood of drowning in the flood,
though the playing field is now so changed, etc.) 

Hey, we have an Internet buyers club, or lack of a better word. I'd just
send a brochure along, but that would look like I'm blatantly looking
for free advertising. Oh hell, I'll append it, and you can K)ill it or
publish it or ignore it as you see fit. 

We're not Alternet, or even BARRnet, we're wierdos. Well... by some
accountings. We have cypherpunks in key points. We allow infinite
back-door reselling. We have what I call our "content-free AUP", yuk
yuk. And we're real, and on the air (quaint phrase) now. And we're
cheap! 

We are not looking for infinite expansion, and we're not competing
head-on with our neighbors. 

PS: I have punk spin, not surf.


THE LITTLE GARDEN -- IP SERVICES

The Little Garden (TLG) is a buyers club providing Internet
connectivity in the greater San Francisco Bay Area.  Our prices are the
cost of connectivity plus our reasonably low overhead. In exchange for
these low prices, we expect members to be somewhat self-sufficient
technically.  Many members become involved in the operation of TLG,
though this is not necessary.

We have Points of Presence (POPs) in San Francisco, Mountain View and
Palo Alto. We have affiliates in other regions providing similar
service. We are working on extending into other areas.

TLG provides high-quality, reliable basic IP connectivity via full-time
SLIP or PPP, secondary Domain Name Service (DNS), and in some cases,
address space. We provide you with the help necessary to get online. We
don't provide shell accounts, shared, part-time IP, etc.

TLG places no restrictions on content or use of your connection,
including reselling, "back door" hosts, etc. You are of course required
to comply with any AUPs of any networks you communicate with or through
and of course any applicable laws. Compliance with this is the member's
responsibility.

PRICES:

56K SERVICE PRICES:
    One-time installation fee (non-refundable) . . . . . . $400.
    Monthly connection fee . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $325.

T1 SERVICE PRICES:
    One-time installation fee (non-refundable) . . . . . . $500.
    Monthly connection fee . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $800.

Each member must provide their own CSU/DSU pair, and a 56K or T1
capable connection to their system (such as a router). Each member
must also provide a standalone router at the TLG end or pay for a
fraction of a multi-port router.

OTHER HIGH-SPEED SERVICE:

We are more than willing to work out fair prices on other types of
connections at other speeds, such as 64Kb/s ISDN, 200Kb/s radio,
etc.

LOW-SPEED DIAL-UP SERVICE PRICES:

TLG offers modem-based full-time IP using telephone lines and
dialup-type modems. Additional information is provided near the
end of this datasheet. Ask for further details.

    One-time installation fee (non-refundable) . . . . . . $250.
    Monthly connection fee . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  $70.

The following list gives estimates of goods and services that the
member must cover.

    (Probable telco one-time installation fees, total  . .  $70.
    (Probable monthly telco charges, total . . . . . . . .  $21.
    (Pair of v32bis/v42bis modems, retail  . . . . . . . . $400.

PAYMENT DETAILS:

One-time installation fees, and member-supplied hardware must be
provided before TLG initiates the connection.

Members are invoiced for monthly connect fees three months at a time.
Net 15 days, unless otherwise arranged.  Initial billing starts with
the first full week following the connection completion, or three weeks
from start of the installation, whichever comes latest.

POSSIBLE TLG/MEMBER RESOURCE SHARING:

Under certain conditions, TLG may be willing to pay for the leased line
to the customer's site, and a portion of the connect fee, if TLG can
install a new POP at the member's site.  Depending on various factors,
this could significantly lower the cost to the member for IP services.

As more sites are connected to this new POP, the member housing the POP
would receive a portion of each additional connection fee, effectively
paying for bandwidth used.
