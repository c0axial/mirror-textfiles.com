MACROEZ of DISTRUKSION is a parody of the stuff that takes place on 
bulletin board systems run by 10 year olds. If your telecommunications 
experience is limited to Internet and you've never called a BBS in your 
life, then you probably won't find M.o.D. funny.

Actually, studies have shown that only 1 in twenty people who ARE 
familiar with BBSing find these files funny.

If you have a question about M.o.D., or would like to become a support 
board, or would like to contribute, or wish to know the location of the 
MACROEZ of DISTRUKSION RENT-A-CAR nearest you then contact:
