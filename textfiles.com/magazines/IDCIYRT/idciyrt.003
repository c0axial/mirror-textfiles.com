[setting: a sleepy southern trailer park in georgia.  a grown
 man and a young boy are swimming in an aboveground pool.  a car lies on 
 cinder blocks in the driveway while the yard is littered with children's
 toys.  the man is looking up into the sky.]
 
man: looks like rain.
boy: chips.  need more chips.
 
[suddenly a freak accident accurs, a lightning bolt rips through
 the pool and through the ground striking several leaking waste
 cans.  the cans were set there twenty years ago by the government
 to dispose of radioactive waste.  the reaction between the waste
 and the bolt of electricity is insurmountable.  the waste shoots
 directly up through the fissure in the earth into the pool and
 bathes the two in it's toxic glow.]
 
man: i feel... strangely invigorated by this... this... wait,
     what was that word i said?  in vinegar?  was i talkin'
     again?  i shore hate it when i do that.
boy: beer.  need more beer.
man: we need more than just beer, we need costumes.  and secret
     identities, i feel as strong as twenty monster trucks! i shall
     be called... THE WHITE POWER RANGER!
boy: chips.  need more chips.
wpr: yes... yes... you also need a name... you shall be my faithful
     sidekick... REDNECK BOY!  we shall stand up for all that is
     right.  when we see injustice being done, we shall be there,
     when we see a mexican crossing our sacred borders, we shall
     be there.  when we see some lousy blackie taking a white man's
     job, we shall be there.  we shall stand for truth, justice, and
     the inbred way.
 
[with that, they went down to the local liquor store to stock up on
 chips and beer.  ready to spread their twisted views on politics, they
 are suddenly distracted by a strange alien force.]
 
wpr: ... so i tell her that either she gets me a beer from the
     fridge, or i'm going to have to beat her, again.  so she
     threatens to call the cops on me... hey!  would you look
     at the jugs on her, what i wouldn't do to that...
rnb: beer.  need more beer.
clerk: doesn't he say anything else?
wpr: well, he hasn't been quite normal since the 'accident'.
clerk: oh.
 
[enter a man wearing ski-mask holding a loaded .22 rifle]
 
man: if any one of you honkey's move, i'm gonna fill your chest full
     of lead.  now fill up the bag with your cash, white bread.  oh,
     nice costume whitey.
wpr: foolish negro!  not realize who i am?  i am:
 
[tinny sounding music by garth brooks]
 
wpr: THE WHITE POWER RANGER!
man: dude, i don't care if you're the fucking duke of earl.  empty your
     pockets before i put a cap in yo' ass, fool.
wpr: alright, i gave you your chance.  now you will have to taste
     the wrath of my CROWBAR OF JUSTICE!  taste the pain of a
     thousand episodes of mork and mindy!
rnb: beer.  we need more beer.
 
[the white power ranger pulls out a glowing crowbar from his sack.  he
 swings it at blinding speed at the head of the assailant turned
 victim.  the man attempts to duck but the crowbar slams into his head,
 slightly denting the skull]
 
man: oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit...
 
[enter two other masked men carrying shotguns]
 
man2: leroy!  fuck man, what the hell happened to you.
man3: dude, check out the funky white bread.  thinks he's superman.
man1: don't mess with him... he's the one who fucked up my head
      man.  let's just the the hell out of here. move, move, MOVE!
 
[as they make their getaway, the white power ranger sticks his head
 out of the door]
 
wpm: y'all come back now, y'hear?
 
[the white power ranger and redneck boy get into the IncestMobile, a
 converted chevy pickup with special minority group finding
 equipment.  wpm checks the MinorityFinder camera for anyone who may
 be close by.  it catches a glance on some skater punk kids on their
 way home from an offspring concert]
 
rnb: beer.  need more beer.
wpm: there's some foul evildoers, let's show them what a little hate
     misunderstanding can do.
 
[with that, wpm engages the refried beans jet fuel and takes off at an
 alarming rate.  they catch up with the punks easily, then get out of
 the pickup]
 
wpm: halt, ye of little genetic makeup.
skater1: what's your beef, bro?
skater2: don't mess with us.  we'll school you man.
skater3: jim's a blade-man, man.  he'll cut you, man!
s1: yeah dude, jim's more punk than you.
s2 (whispered): shut up dudes, my piece is at home.  mom took it away.
s1: bummer.  listen, we don't want any trouble, we're just on our
    way home for dinner.  just let us through.
wpm: don't try to talk your way out of this one, i know about
     your type, i watch inside edition.  you and your drugs and
     rock'n'roll.  if you ask me, i'm about to do the world a
     favor, you polecat.
 
[the white power ranger pulls out another of his weapons of
 ignorance, a glowing baseball bat]
 
wpm: say hello to mr. wilson, shithead.  feel the sting of a thousand
     mighty budweisers!  he-yah!
 
[wpm starts to swing his baseball bat towards the punks, gets one of
 them down, then a police car pulls up]
 
cop: well shit-on-me... if it isn't the white power ranger, what do
     i owe this honor upon, sir?
wpm: these bastard hippies were skating up the street, wearing
     horrible clothing, probably coming from a rock concert and
     on some sort of drugs.
cop: izzatso?  looks to me like i'm gonna have to do some
     regulatin' here.  c'mere boy, let me show you what the law
     thinks about your type.
s1: shit...
 
[the officer pulls out his billy club and starts to whack away at
 the helpless skater punks.  the next day the paper headlines with:
 THE WHITE POWER RANGER SAVES TRAILER PARK FROM CERTAIN DOOM.
 in the insuing months, tales of wpm's crusade spreads far and wide
 throughout the county.  the news falls upon the ears of the north
 east coast's number one superhero, politically correct man.  he
 is agast at the atrocity.]
 
politically correct man: great scott!  how can someone come up with such
                         a dastardly plan?  these are all potential
                         voters... i feel as if i should do something to
                         help them...
 
[a voice sounds from the other room]
 
voice: just make sure that you don't damage your image, sir...
 
pcm: but of couse, thank you democratic party boy; i don't know where
     i'd be without you.
 
democratic party boy: you'd still be in arkansas kissing ass...
 
pcm: yes yes yes, but that's not important now.  there _has_ to be a way
     i can use this to my advantage and win votes for 1996.  hmmm...
     wait, i know!  and it's been done before... come into the planning
     room al... errr... i mean democratic party boy...
 
dpb: sure... lemme just wipe first... (to someone else) thank you
     hillary.
 
hillary: any time, big boy.

  what plan does politically correct man have in store for the white
  power ranger?!  does this mean that the story's finally developing a
  plot, going against pip's original plan?  why can't democratic party
  boy wipe his own ass?  and why was hillary doing the dirty work? these
  and other questions to be answered in the second part of our story, in:
 
  THE WHITE POWER RANGER RIDES OFF
 
  or
 
  MOMMY, HOW MUCH IS THAT SHOTGUN IN THE WINDOW, THE ONE WITH THE
  WAGGILY CLIP?
