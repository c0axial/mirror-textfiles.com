ode to my faithful companion
 
i had a dog named merri that's like no other
i thrived on to petting, feeding, and loving her
she fetched the paper for me every single day
oh, how i loved the look in her eyes as we play
but one foul day happiness was taken away from me
hate and murder soon became all that i could see
some fucking shithead hit her in his truck
i was forced to go out and find that damned fuck
i saw a truck parked out in front of sam's bar and grill
it had a merri sized blood stain, i felt a sudden chill
so patiently i had waited in the bushes with my baseball bat
soon a man came out with a sun burnt neck and yankees hat
he headed for the ford and attempted to put his key in
as i sneaked out from behind the bush i started to grin
i connected the bat to his skull with the greatest of ease
his blood shot out in every direction that you please
he hit the ground in complete pain, i knew i would win
i brought my doc martins back and kicked him in the chin
his head whipped back faster than any man's eye could see
i drank alot of beer before, and now i had the desire to pee
urinating on the man was one of the best things i've done
he thought i was finished with him, but i was just having fun
i brought out the hacksaw and started to amputate his arm
starting with the fingers, i thought of better ways to harm
i shoved my baseball bat up his ass, then hammered it in further
he started to bawl, i think he was crying for his damned mother
to silence his cries, i kicked him violently in the throat
he was instantly quiet, ha! that certainly got his goat

man down by the river
 
one early fall day i was taking a walk down by the river
an elderly gentleman was tossing rocks into the river by himself
i watched him for a while, until he put his watch in his pocket
i jaunted down the riverbanks down towards him silently
i came up behind him, and put a cap in his punk ass
taking his watch, i tossed his hide into his beloved river, bitch

how much i love thee
 
you are more lovely than a summer's breeze
you are so cute when you make a sneeze
your hair smells like one thousand roses
you're the most beautiful girl since the time of moses
the way the sun filters through your hair
the perfect loving with you i want to share
i know that you are the one to fix my itch
i want to taste your cunt on my tounge, bitch.
