                                              dto
 
i'll explain the illustration.
 
-- mogel and bf --               -- jamesy --
hoe was born of cdc              milk was born of blah
red was born of hoe              mat was born of tho and milk
red died                         mat died
hoe died                         alt-251 was born and died
dto rose from the ashes of hoe   std rose, then merged with hoe
 
-- pip --
tho was born of boredom
tho died
pip and jamesy joined to make mat
pip left because he was getting frustrated with mat
gasp was born aftî pip went bye bye
gasp died when pip moved to california
idciyrt was born of boredom
 
so what can we learn from this?
 
mogel, bf, and jamesy started t-file groups because they wanted to imitate
their idols.
 
pip starts t-file groups because he's bored quite a bit of the time
