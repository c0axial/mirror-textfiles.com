	"Dialectics is living, many-sided knowledge." [Lenin]

	"Dialectics is the soul of Marxism." [Stalin, _Problems of Leninism_, 
1940]

	"Communists the world over are wiser than the bourgeoisie [because]....
they understand dialectics and they can see further." [Mao, _Selected Works_, 
1961]

	"In this world, friendship exists only between one cat and another, not 
between a cat and a mouse." [Mao]

	"LENIN ABANDONS STATE OWNERSHIP AS SOVIET POLICY....
	Lenin has thrown communism overboard." [_NYT_, Aug. 13, 1921]

	"GORBACHEV BURIES THE COLD WAR" [_NYT_, MAY 7, 1992]

	"Formerly top-secret documents released this week to _The Washington 
Post_ and the Russian popular magazine _Ogonyok_ make clear that a worldwide 
Communist 'conspiracy' really did exist for much of the past seven decades, 
with the Kremlin secretly funding client parties from India to El Salvador." 
[_Wash. Post_, Mar. 1, 1992]

	"...Secretary of Defense Cheney's stated concern that the Soviet 
missile fleet continues to be upgraded and aimed at American targets..." 
[_NYT_, Dec. 3, 1991]

	"...Russia still controls the second most powerful navy in the world, 
one that is modernizing even as it shrinks, and the only one outside NATO with 
an effective nuclear missile stockpile....'It is very difficult to find out 
where their submarines are, and how many are out there from other sources 
[other than reconnaissance near the Soviet shore]....Soviet Navy is still 
sending out four to six ballistic missile submarines on patrol at any given 
time....Soviet Navy test-fired a ballistic missile from a submarine....In 
December, the only large-deck aircraft carrier built by the former Soviet 
Union sailed from the Black Sea to join the Northern Fleet off the Kola 
Peninsula....an Oscar and an Akula attack submarine are under construction, a 
Typhoon clas sub us being modified to accept more accurate ballistic miussiles, 
and a nearly finished Delta sub, which also carries ballistic missiles, may or 
may not be completed after work was apparently halted last year..." [_NYT_, 
Feb. 23, 1992]

	"Thousands of nuclear weapons were intended to deter such a war or to 
prevail[!] in war if deterrence failed." [Gorbachev aide Igor Malashenko _NYT_, 
Oct. 18, 1991]

	"The deployment of rail-mobile SS-24 and road-mobile SS-25 has 
continued....[By] 1 January 1991....36 launchers had been mounted on 12 trains 
which were deployed at three sites. It is estimated that about a further 54 
SS-24 have been deployed in former SS-19 silos. SS-245 deployment has probably
now reached 300; the missile was seen for the first time at the October Day 
Parade held on 7 November 1990. It is reliably claimed that follow-ons to both 
the SS-24 and SS-25 are under development. While the deployed numbers of SS-18 
remained at 308, more have been modernized with the ten-warhead Mod 5 and a new 
single-warhead Mod 6 replacing older Mod 2, 3, and 4 missiles." [annual book, 
International Institute of Strstegic Studies, Oct. 1991]

	"...the U.S.S.R. Institute of the U.S.A. and Canada recently wrote 
that military spending would rise from 26 percent of the Soviet budget for 1990 
to 36 percent in 1991....the Director of Central Intelligence, William 
Webster...said [the Soviets] launched a new Delta-4 ballistic misisle submarine 
in 1990, with more under construction, and are continusingf to develop three 
additional strategic missiles....The C.I.A. assessment concluded that the 
Soviet's modernization of strategic weapons will substantially improve their 
strategic capability....the START treaty...will allow the soviets to have 1,100 
warheads on mobile ICBMs, up from 660 in current inventory." [Hoover 
Institution's Richard Staar, _NYT_, Aug. 19, 1991]

	"U.S. CONSIDERING SHARP CUTS IN MULTI-WARHEAD MISSILES, CORE OF THE 
NUCLEAR FORCE" [_NYT_, Jan. 1992]

	"A note informing the Far Eastern Democratic Republic of Siberia that 
it has been recognized by the Russian Soviet Government was sent 
today...[_NYT_, May 19, 1920]

	"FREE FROM SOVIETS, GEORGIA PROCLAIMS....Independence of Moscow Is 
Unanimously Declared by Republic's Parliament" [_NYT_, Apr. 10, 1991]

	"In order to placate the deaf-mutes, proclaim the (fictional!) 
separation of our government and governmental institutions (the Council of 
People's Commissars, etc.) from the Party and the Politburo and, in particular, 
from the Comintern, declaring these latter agencies to be independent political 
groups which are tolerated on the territory of the Soviet Socialist Republics. 
The deaf-mutes will believe it." [Lenin's notes copied by Yury Annakov and 
published in "Lenin and the 'Deaf-Mutes,'" _Bulletin: Institute for the Study 
of the USSR_, May 1962]

	"The revolutionary will accept a reform in order to use it as an aid in 
combining legal work with illegal work and to intensify, under its cover, the 
illegal work of the revolutionary preparation of the masses for the overthrow 
of the bourgeoisie." [Stalin, _Foundations of Leninism_,]

	"SOVIET REFORMISTS DECIDE TO CREATE OPPOSITION GROUP" [_NYT_, JULY 2, 
1991]

	"You will have to go through fifteen, twenty, fifty years of civil wars 
and international conflicts..." [Marx, in Marx and Engels, _Works_ (Soviet?)]

	"...the transition from capitalism to communism [is] an entire 
historical era..." [Lenin]
	
	"Who has not heard of that disease of narrow empiricism and 
unprincipled practicalism which has not infrequently caused certain 
'Bolsheviks' to degenerate and to abandon the cause of the revolution?" 
[Stalin, _Foundations of Leninism_]

	"America remains an open society in which opposing forces can surface 
and clash, a necessary precondition for their solution." [Gorbachev, _NYT_, May 
28, 1992]

	"...our country, (where a phase of history well known to us took its 
start and ran its course)....the society and civilization we are now creating 
should be understood in their full complexity, with all their many facets and 
contradictions. That precisely[!] is the point of intellectual and political 
freedom and of pluralism....representatives of socialist parties and members
of the Socialist International are in the governments of countries where the 
market dominates the economy." [Gorbachev, _NYT_, Feb. 24, 1992]

	"War Foe to Oversee Military in House....Ronald V. Dellums, almost 
certain to be the new chairman of the House Armed Services Committee..." 
[_NYT_, Dec. 24, 1992]

	"After the U.S. invasion of Grenada, U.S. forces retrieved a letter 
from [a] Dellums aide...to the Communist strongman Maurice Bishop...'Ron, as a 
political thinker, is the best around and Fidel will verify that in no 
uncertain terms....[Ron] is really hooked on you and Grenada and doesn't want 
anything to happen to building the Revo[lution] and making it strong....the 
only other person that I know of that he expresses such admiration for is 
Fidel.'....Medical Aid to El Salvador...has more than a dozen congressional 
sponsors, among them...Dellums....According to a laudatory article in the May 
28, 1983, [far left] _Gaurdian_, donations to Medical Aid funded 'various 
projects in liberated[!] areas of El Salvador, each supervised by the Farabundo 
Marti National Libertation Front/Democratic Revolutionary Front (FMLN/FDR)."
...House Democrats in activities sponsored by the Soviet-front World 
Peace Council, and its U.S. affiliate, the U.S. Peace Council....Dellums [among 
them]." [_National Rev._, July 31, 1987]

	"Hillary [Clinton] served in 1987-88 as director and chair of the board 
of directors of the New World Foundation....In 1988, New World gave $5,000 to 
the Committee in Support of the People of El Salvador (CISPES) education fund. 
CISPES was founded at meetings in New York City in 1980 by Farid Handal 
(brother of El Salvador's Communist party chief Shafik Handal), who had come to 
the United States to mobilize American support for the FMLN, the major 
Communist guerilla organization in El Salvador....In 1988, Hillary lavished 
$20,000 on the Christic Institute, the far left [at least] crackpots who 
flacked the 'secret team" theory [and who]....were assessed $1.1 million in 
court-ordered sanctions for filing a frivilous lawsuit against...supposed 
secret teamsters. Hillary doled out $15,000 in 1987 to the National Lawyers 
Guild, founded in the 1930s as an adjunct to the American Communist Party and 
retaining party ties to this day. Support also went to the Center for 
Constitutional Studies...and [its ally and/or parent organization,] the 
[Marxist] Institute for Policy Studies." [_Am. Spectator_, Aug. 1992]

	Gennadi Yanayev lead the "coup" which "ended" Soviet Marxism. The 
_NYT_, in almost the first thing it reported about him, said, "Likes ice hockey 
and has been described as having an earthy sense of humor..." The _NYT_ also 
said, "Made his way to the top through...the trade union movement..."
	"There is mounting evidence that [he] now has become Gorbachev's chief 
of staff and the key man in charge of Soviet active measures [political war or 
political influence operations]....He is also probably the chief planner and 
coordinator of Soviet active measures in the West....made his career in 
organizations that are central[!] to Soviet active measures." [_Political 
Warfare_, Spring 1991] Yanayev has been a top official of the CPSU-controlled 
All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, which controls the World Federation 
of Trade Unions and other international Marxist labor fronts. He then sat on 
the Politburo and was Central Committee secretary for the International 
Affairs Commission. Soon after, he was "elected" "vice-president" of the SU. 
	The International Affairs Commission controls the International Dept, 
the revolutionary, non-state, organization which coordinates the various 
national Marxist and allied parties, national liberation movements, guerilla 
and terrorists groups. This is the institution of the international communist 
conspiracy, as described by the Radio Liberty Research Bulletin Supplement 
("Foreign Depts," Oct. 27, 1980), _Problems of Communism_ ("International 
Dept_, Sep. 1984, p.47), and _International Journal_ ("International Dept.,"
Winter 1976-1977, p.41). In _Breaking With Moscow_, defecting Soviet UN 
Ambassador Arkady Shevchenko said the state Soviet Foreign Ministry was 
controlled by the International Dept., an observation consistent with the 
Marxist view of the state as the dialectically temporary agent of revolution.
	
	"Gorbachev Names Top Liberals As Advisors....former Foreign Minister 
Eduard A. Shevardnadze...[,] Aleksandr Yakovlev...[,] an architect 
of...glasnost and perestroika[,]...the new liberal[!] head of the 
KGB[!!],"...and the new liberal[!] head of state television, Yegor Yakovlev."
	Shevvardnadze was identified as KGB by the House Subcommittee on 
Terrorism. Yakovlev was International Policy Commission secretary before 
Yanayev. Soviet state television is controlled by the International Information 
Subdepartment, an important agency of Marxist "active measures," of the 
Ideological Commission of the Central Committee of the CPSU.

	In 1989, the (Soviet) Novosti Press Agency (of the International 
Information Subdepartment) published _The Problem of Compromise in Politics as 
Seen by Lenin in the First Post Revolutionary Years (1918-1921)_ by Alexander 
Lebedev, described as a journalist. Lebedev is head of the International 
Information Subdepartment and deputy head of its controlling Ideology Dept. The 
conventional Western meaning of compromise as an end to conflict radically 
differs from Lenin's meaning, as quoted by Lebedev, "truth turns into error 
[when] we recognize only one road, only the direct road, and...will not permit 
tacking, conciliatory manoevers, or compromising[!]." [ZIG-ZAG is seeking the 
English edition] Soon after publication, Marxism dialectically ended in the SU.

	"A report in _Tass_ [on Dec. 7, 1992]...quoted [First Deputy Russian 
Defense Minister Pavel] Kokoshin as saying that the Russian military would give 
acqisition priority to strategic nuclear forces and space-based intelligence- 
gathering equipment as well as communication, command, and control and mobile 
technologies. He said, 'Emphasis will be laid on the creation of scientific and 
tecnical facilities for the development of advanced armaments and through 
modernization of existing weapons." [_Wash. Inquirer_, Jan. 1,1993]

	"The anticipated reductions sketched out in the proposed START II 
Treaty really mean that if, Russia, has heretofore enjoyed better than a 5 to 1 
advantage in deliverable megatonnage as many experts believe, ikt can logically 
still retain the same advantage after making the putative radical cuts. 
Moreover, it is untrue to suggest, as is being done in the media, that 
multiple-warhead (MIRVed) missiles will be altogether eliminated." [_Wash. 
Inquirer_, Jan. 8  1993]

	"...HITLER IN SPEECH KEEPS PEACE DOOR OPEN" [_NYT_, Sep. 27, 1938]
	"...GERMANS TO ENTER SUDETEN AREA TOMORROW" [_NYT_, Sep. 30, 1938]

"The existential atmosphere of [the pre-WW1 West] (which was then being 
destroyed by Europe's philosophical trends and political systems) still held a 
benevolence that would be incredible to the men of today, i.e., a smiling 
confident good will of man to man, and of man to life."             Ayn Rand
