"For to win one hundred victories in one hundred battles is not the acme of 
skill....To subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill...Thus, what 
is of supreme importance in war is to attack the enemy's strategy....Next best 
is to disrupt his alliances....Pretend inferiority and encourage his arrogance..
..When he is united, divide him....Now the crux of military operations lies in 
the pretence of accomodating one's self to the designs of the enemy....All 
warfare is based on deception. Therefore, when capable, feign incapacity; when 
active, inactivity....Offer the enmey a bait to lure him; feign disorder and 
strike him....One who wishes to appear weak in order to make his enemy arrogant 
must be extremely strong. Only then can he feign weakness."
[Sun Tzu, _The Art of War_]
________________________________________________________________________________
	ADVENTURES OF THE DIALECTIC 
        ---------------------------
	"Russia Orders American Reporter Questioned in State-Secrets Case
	The Russian Ministry of Security...has ordered a  _Baltimore Sun_ 
reporter to report back to Lefortovo Prison....to answer questions in 
connection with a case brought against a Russian chemist....[who] wrote that 
Russia was continuing to test and produce chemical weapons in violations of its 
own promises." [_NYT_, April. 8, 1993]
	The dialectic quickly progresses from retreat to attack when the 
Marxist ability to make war is threatened.

	"U.S. TO CUT COSTS, SEEKS RUSSIAN ROLE IN SPACE STATION
	Clinton Sees Opportunity in End of Cold War to Save Money and Cooperate 
in Space" [April 7, 1993]
	Marxists temporarily retreat from revolution and get offer to study the 
advanced technology of the "main enemy."

	"NICARAGUA TO GET BLOCKED U.S. AID....$50 MILLION
	[Conservatives] had criticized [President] Chamorro for suppposedly[!] 
ceding control over the military and the police to the [Marxist] Sandinista 
Front." [_NYT_, April 2, 193]
	Short-range Pragmatist compromisers eagerly accept the smallest lie 
from their enemies. Obviously Nicaraguan Marxists retain the ability to create 
a Marxist dictatorship.

	"7 NATIONS PLEDGE $28 BILLION FUND TO AID RUSSIA" [_NYT, April 15, 
1993]
	The U.S sold steel to Japan after it was common sensibly obvious that 
war was ahead. Marxists temporarily retreat and temporarily split their forces 
and their traditionalist and Pragmatist class enemies give them tribute because 
they are too stupid and too cowardly to recognize that they are already at war.

	"[U.S.] Capitol Stirs to...Gorbachev
	The swift and seamless[!] nature of Mr.[!]Gorbachev's life-change[!] 
from Communist strongman to environmental star[!] was epitomized by Senator 
John F. Kerry....'I think it fair to say you might have called him the 
environmental President,' Mr.Kerry said. [_NYT_, Apr. 16, 1993]
	"Senator John Kerry hired a former [Marxist Institute for Policy 
Studies] fellow, Gareth Porter, to be his legislative aide. Porter...defend[ed] 
the bloody [Marxist] Pol Pot regime in Cambodia long after the evidence of its 
genocide [classocide] of its own people had become overwhelming." [_Communists 
in the Democratic Party_-Concerned Voters]
	The moral obscenity of calling a Marxist mass murderer a "star" is 
part of America's decline and, possibly, fall.

	"Yeltsin Leaves Talks With Firm Support and More Aid
	Clinton Promises Review of Cold War Laws
	[He] had asked Mr. Clinton to lift 'discriminatory limitations on trade 
with Russia' like...restrictions on export of high-technology..." [_NYT_, Apr. 
5, 1993]
	Soviet Marxists said they would rather have convinced
America to not produce the atom bomb rather than steal its plans.

	"After Four Decades of Bitterness, China and Taiwan Plan to Meet
	The dialectic splits Marxists from each other and unifies them with 
class enemies-until the contradiction in that phase of history develops into, 
as the Chinese Marxist theoretical journal, _Hong-ki_, said, "a new unity on a 
new basis." [_NYT_, Apr. 12, 1993]

	"Yeltsin...Is Attacked by Political Enemies [_NYT_, Apr. 27, 1993]
	Marxists understand this attack, real or not, as a temporary part of 
history's contradictory progression to communism. The attack itself is a Soviet 
deception, part of political war (political influence operations or "active 
measures"]. 
	
	"U.S. to Send General to Vietnam, Hinting a Thaw
	"...could lead the United States to withdraw its opposition to 
international bank lending to Vietnam..." [_NYT_, Apr. 10, 1993]
	The practical effects of a dialectical retreat are powerful.

	"Colonel Fights With His Pen, Defending the Poor
	For a lieutenant-colonel who retired only[!] last year after 27 years 
of service [murdering Americans and Vietnamese], and a Communist Party member 
since 1970, Nyguyen Khac Truong hold decidedly non-conformist [in a 
totalitarian society] views. What's more, he  [or a ghostwriter] has expressed 
them in a novel that was not only published but even shared the 1991 fiction 
prize of the Vietnamese Writer's Association....'I believe fully in Buddhism,' 
the writer said. He laughed when reminded of his 23 years of Communist 
membership." [_NYT_, Apr. 9, 1993]
	Paul Hollander's _Political Pilgrims_ is a description of the Marxist 
use of intellectuals to divert attention from revolution. This is active 
measures, a classic Marxist method of presenting a false front.

	"The Smiles for Americans, and Other Paradoxes
	The contradictions of Vietnam are evident everywhere, as the Communist 
government tries to combine a free-market economy with rigid, one-party 
rule....Vu Huu Ngoan, deputy director of the Institute of 
Marxism-Leninism...took pains to assure a visitor that the [dialectical] demise 
of their sister institutes in Europe, along with the parties that trained their 
functionaries there, had served only to reinforce their faith. 'I don't believe 
the doctrine has collapsed,' Mr. Ngoan said. 'on the contrary, the collapse of 
those countries proves the that the principles are right and they applied them 
wrongfully'....but because of the declining[!] standing of Marx and Lenin, some 
of whose ideas they said had proved erroneous, the institute last May took out 
a kind of dialectic[!!!!!] insurance. Mr. Ngoan said the name of Ho Chi Minh 
was added to the school's title. 'Maybe their own gods are no ideological 
giants, but they are their own, a [Marxist] Russian diplomat said. Tran Cong 
Man, an amiable [of course] retired[!] major general and journalist[!] 
who,often serves as informal [formally informal] party spokesman [retired?!], 
conceded that there was an ideological crisis. but all th eold ideas of the 
class struggle still apply....'We want to have more democracy every day under 
the rule of one party [Lenin's democratic centralism].'" [_NYT_, Apr. 27, 1993]
	Statements of the continuing Marxist revolution rarely get
clearer than this. The _NYT_, by its mention of "dialectics," understands this 
but refuses to alert its readers, partly because of its own long-term Marxist 
sympathies and partly from Pragmatist stupidity, the animal-like ignorance of 
the meaning of ideas. For Pragmatists, the contradictions of Marxist Vietnam 
are chaotic. For Marxists, those contradictions mean the "dialectic of history" 
is progressing towards communism. 

	"Chinese Find Their [or the Party's] Voice: a Radio Call-In Show
	Callers to the talk show first tell a producer what they want to 
discuss and leave their name, position, and telephone number. If the producer 
approves, the station calls the person back-for efficiency, the station says, 
but it is also a way of making sure that no one calls the mayor a turtle's egg 
on the air [or damns Marxism]." [_NYT_, Apr. 26, 1993]
	Readers surprised at the restrictions should study Rousseau's general 
will, an important source, through Kant's categorical imperative, of Marx's 
species being. Collectivists think freedom results from sacrificing oneself to 
society so one is free of individual responsibility. The talk show, far from 
an expression of individualism, is an insidiously clever and dialectical 
method of loosening and tightening the prisoner's chains at the same time. It 
permits trivial expression of outrage at Marxism, just enough to keep the 
slaves working and docile. Identifying serious dissidents is a bonus.
________________________________________________________________________________
"Lenin and [his Minister of State] Chicherin were not the only sources of 
inspiration of the revival of strategic disinformation. The ancient Chinese 
treatise on strategy and deception, Sun Tzu's _The Art of War_ [was] 
translated into Russian in 1950 (shortly after the communist victory in China). 
...the preparation of a semblance of democratization in order to 
provide...support for the communists outside the bloc in realization of the 
major strategies....the introduction of controlled political opposition, which 
will provide the basically totalitarian regimes with a convincing impression of 
a fundamental change and a semblance of democracy....The preparation of a false 
opposition, during the introduction of controlled democratization in the 
communist regimes, for the purpose of creating a favorable condition for unity 
of action with the social democrats, the free trade unions and with the 
Catholics against NATO and the US military-industrial complex. [Anatoliy 
Golitsyn, _New Lies For Old_, Dodd, 1984]

	"Black 'Think Tank' Opens a Foreign Institute"

	"...TransAfrica, the lobby best known for its anti-apartheid campaign, 
opened its foreign policy institute here [in Washington]....Randall Robinson 
[is the] executive director....Among the....500 guests....at the dedication of 
the institute [were] Bryant Gumbal, the NBC News anchor,....Donna Shalala, 
Secretary of Health and Human Services; news anchors Ted Koppel and Bernard 
Shaw, and Iman, the Somalian-born model...The institute's library is named for 
[recently deceased tennis star, Arthur] Ashe, who served on the board of 
TransAfrica since its founding in 1977. Transafrica, a lobbying group of black 
Americans, was the driving force behind the campaign for Snited States 
economic sanctions against South Africa....During Angola's civil war, both 
sides competed for black American support. The exiled President of Haiti, 
the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristede has also sought support from American 
blacks; he was among the guests....many prominent black Americans have shown an 
interest in exercising their influence. Among those contributing to the 
institute's support are [comedian] Bill Cosby [who may buy NBC,] actors Robert 
Guillaume and Joyce Deep, and the boxer Sugar Ray Leonard. Corporations that do 
substantial business with blacks have shown interest in supporting the venture. 
Transafrica has 20,000 or so members in 12 chapters around the country and many 
prominent black members. There is no precise way to gauge whether its policy 
positions on Africa and the Caribbean reflect the views of most American 
blacks. Some critics of the organization argue that it is too liberal 
and too sympathetic to third-world leaders. "As long as 
they're not the exclusive voice, this institute is a wonderful thing," said 
Sanford Unger, dean of the school of communications at American University and 
a longtime commentator on Africa. "They've sometimes tended to ignore the 
domestic record of some African leaders. The forum will offer programs 
including one that works with historically black colleges to train students 
for the Foreign Service. [_NYT_, June 6, 1993]

	"...TransAfrica grew out of the...1976 Black Leadership Conference on 
Africa, convened by the Congressional Black Congress [1] and presided over by 
then U.S. Representative Andrew Young [2]. The conference created a task force, 
chaired by Randall Robinson....on the board of directors are such radicals 
[Marxists] as Courtland Cox [3] and Carlton Goodlet....a member of the 
Presidium[!] of the Soviet-controlled World Peace Council, and...a veteran 
member of the Communist Party, USA....[TransAfrica] joined with a 
host of other leftist [and Marxist] groups in signing a May 1982 statement 
opposing [American] "Covert Intervention in Nicaragua."....Among the 
signers...were: Council on Hemispheric Affairs (COHA) [4], American Friends 
Service Committee [5], _Counter-Spy_ [6], Maryknoll Sisters [7], National 
Council of Churches [8], National Lawyers Guild [9], NACLA [10], Unitarian 
Universalist Service Committee [11], Washington Office on Latin America [12], 
and the U.S. Peace Council [13]....TransAfrica's annual dinner of June 5, 1982, 
Washington, featured a keynote address by Michael Manley, the socialist, 
pro-Castro former Prime Minister of Jamaica....[I]n documents seized on Grenada 
during the 1983 rescue mission there....[e]xecutive director Randall Robinson 
said he would urge black American soldiers to betray their country and 
disregard orders if they were sent into action on behalf of 'suspect' 
governments....[He] told _USA_ [Dec.30, 1982] that the [Marxist] Cubans saved 
[Marxist] Angola from from [anti-Marxist] Aouth Africa....[He] and TransAfrica, 
as well as the Free South Africa Movement which he leads, are staunch backers
of the [Marxist African National Congress]. The Free South Africa Movement 
has been given wide propaganda play by the [Marxist] World Peace Council....
[According to United Press International on June 8, 1984, Sam Nujoma, leader of 
the Marxist, African terrorist group, SWAPO,] went to a dinner held in his 
honor by TransAfrica....[In the captured Grenada documents] Robinson 
explained....[an] advantage he hoped would result from the visit [of Marxist 
Grenadan dictator Maurice Bishop to the U.S.]:...the appearance of Bishop as a 
spokesman and leader in the Caribbean and Central America.

	[1] [According to the May 1987, U.S. Marxist journal, _Political 
Affairs_,] The role of the Congressional Black Caucus, the most active and 
_progressive_ bloc in Congress, illustrates the level of sophistication the 
Afro-American people have reached in utilizing the legislative power....The 
[U.S.] Communist _Daily World_ on October 4, 1986, reported favorably on a CBC 
three-day conference in Washington at which plans for electing CBC candidates 
to Congress were discussed....[In 1980, the El Salvadoran FMNL Marxist 
political agent, Shafik Handel, said, 'My] meeting with the Black 
Caucus took place in...the meeting room of the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee.'
	[2] Young's former Latin American advisor, Brady Tyson, is a prominent 
member of NACLA [see below]. After Tyson was expelled from Brazil for Marxist 
propaganda, Young said, 'That would recommend him to me.'....[Young is on the 
advisory board of the (Marxist) Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA)], a 
major element in Washington's powerful Castro lobby....He supports CISPES, the 
American political warfare branch of the Marxist El Salvadoran FMNL].
	[3] Cox was speaker for _Counterspy_ [see below].
	[4] [COHA] was started...by Lawrence Birns, a professor of Latin 
American studies at the New School for Social Research and an associate of the 
late Chilean Communist and Cuban operative Orlando Letelier....[He] described 
COHA's purpose as 'to manipulate the sophisticated political and academic 
communities'....[and] said...that he and his organization supported the Marxist 
Allende government in Chile....[and] was a participant in the 1976 Third Session
of the International Commission Inquiry into the Crimes of the Military Junta 
in Chile, a creation of the [Marxist] Soviet...World Peace Council.
	[5] [The AFSC distributed a defense of Marxist Cambodian Khymer Rouge 
mass murders] more than a year [after] the evidence of Cambodian Communist 
genocide was overwhelming....John McAuliffe, director of the Indochina Program 
of the [AFSC] said that, 'all reliable sources indicate that the [Marxist] 
Vietnamese are carrying out the task of reconstruction with extraordinary 
humaneness.'....The [AFSC] began as a Quaker organization. but in recent years 
it has become so identified with far left causes that many Quakers now disown 
it. Its top board members are still Quakers, but many of its executives are 
not.
	[6] [_Counter-Spy_ (now the _National Reporter_) was founded by, among 
others, Marxist ex-CIA agent Philip Agee who said,] 'I approve KGB activities, 
Communist activities in general, when they are to the advantage to the 
opressed.'....[It's published by the Advisory Committee for the Fifth Estate, 
one of whose members is Marcus Raskin, co-founder of the Institute for Policy 
Studies, perhaps the largest American Marxist agency-of-influence and in 
contact with Marxist spies from, at least, the Soviet Union and the "former" 
East Germany. This is an anti-American Intelligence magazine. Contributor 
Philip Wheaton is a sponsor of US Out of Central America (USOCA), whose 
internal documents reveal that] Marxists 'were among those who first conceived 
of OSOCA.' [The magazine helped sponsor, along with the Communist Party USA 
Central Committee, a conference] in February 1979 to discuss a broad-based 
strategy to ensure that the FSLN [Sandinista National Liberation Front] took 
power [in Nicaragua] and kept control. [With an offshoot, _Covert Action 
Information Bulletin_, _Counter-Spy_] identified--and mis-identified--hundreds 
of undercover American intelligence personnel[, one of whom, the Athens 
station chief, was murdered afterwards.]
	[7] One foreign missionary branch, the Maryknoll Order [of the American 
Roman Catholic Church] has been deeply involved in promoting the cause of 
Castro in Latin America. Maryknoll's former director of publications, Father 
Miguel D'Escoto, [was] the Sandinista foreign minister[!] One of Maryknoll's 
staunchest supporters in the U.S. government is also one of the most 
powerful[,] house speaker Thomas P. O'Neill, a bitter opponent of the Reagan 
Administrations's Central American policies...._U.S. News and World 
Report_...wrote that Speaker O'Neill 'says his views on Central America are 
shaped less by official U.S. reports than by priests and nuns of the Maryknoll 
order....[Gregory] Craig of Senator [Ted] Kennedy's office also contacted [Bob] 
Stark [of the Central American Historical Institute, which] disseminate[s] 
Marxist propaganda and gather[s] intelligence on behalf of the Sandinista 
government] as well as Peggy Healy, a former Kennedy staffer who heads the 
Maryknoll Sisters in Nicaragua [in an effort to provide 'contra' victims 
for a May 1984 Washington forum. The 'victims" were located for Craig by 
Michael Ratner,] president of the [Marxist] National Lawyers Guild in 1982 and 
1983.
	[8] "Not only does the [National Council of Churches] fund some of he 
pro-Castro groups directly, but its role in promoting Communism in Central 
America and in the Caribbean is far-reaching. Documents captured from the 
Marxist guerillas in El Salvador have revealed that the NCC has channeled money 
to aid the armed terrorist movement in that country. In its January 23, 1983 
program CBS's "60 Minutes" exhibited a number of pro-Marxist publications 
produced by NCC-funded groups including booklets on U.S. "colonialism" in 
Puerto Rico, a film strip supporrting the [Marxist] FMLN terrorists in El 
Salvador, an NCC study booklet on Cuba holding the [Marxist] Castro regime up 
as a model for the Caribbean, and documents produced by [the Marxist] CISPES. 
THe CBS program reported that a forged document on Central America fabricated 
by the [Marxist] Koviet KGB was disseminated by the Washington Office on Latin 
America, which is supported by the [NCC]."
	[9] "[Marxist] infiltration of American legal organizations began in 
1922[!] when the Communist International founded...[the International Class War 
Prisoners Aid Society]. This became known as the International Red Aid....An 
American section was set up in 1925 called the International Labor Defense. In 
1936 this ILD helped to organize the National Lawyers Guild, which in 1946 
became affiliated with the International Association of Democratic Lawyers..., 
the world-wide communist front group for attorneys. today the Guild has several 
thousand members, offices in 50 cities, units in most of the leading law 
schools and a major operation in Washington....Cited several times by HUAC and 
the Senate internal Security Committee as a Communist front, [it] obtained a 
dismissal of the listing...[because] of 'lack of prosecution'....it has 
continued to exhibit unmistakable signs of Communist domination, its continued 
membership in the IADL, its consistent espousal of communist causes, the large 
number of identified Communists in its membership..."
	[10] [The North American Congress on Latin America] was founded in 
1966 by some members of the Marxist/leftist Students for a Democratic Society. 
It sought to attract people 'who...favor [Marxist] revolutioary 
change....NACLA's Berkeley office is headed by...a former member of 
the...[Marxist] Venceremos Brigade (young Americans who trveled to Cuba to be 
trained in [Marxist] revolutionary techniques). An affilaiate of the Berkeley 
office is Research Associates International..., an organization active in 
research against CIA activities around the world. The London 
correspondent...is...an associate of [Marxist CIA defector] Philip Agee [who 
helped start _Counter-Spy_ (see above) and who published information on CIA 
employees and contacts in _CIA Diary_] with assistance from [NACLA].
	[11] "The Unitarian Universalist Service Committee...has been 
underwriting congressional "study tours" to El Salvador. _Congressional 
Quarterly_ reported that these trips, 'usually include trips to [Marxist] 
rebels and other dissidents not on the agenda of officially sponsored tours. 
Most of the trips have been for liberal lawmakers-including Rep. Studds, who 
credits his January 1981 visit with making him one of the most outspoken House 
activists against aid to El Salvador."
	[12] "[In 1982 t]he Salvadoran Army captured a communist guerilla base 
and found several documents including a trip report by Farid 
Handel...describing his trip to the U.S. in 1980 to set up a propaganda front 
group. Handel wrote that....he had the cooperation of the Communist Party USA, 
....[and] reported that [a senior party official] proposed a national 
conference under the auspices of [,among other groups, the Washington Office on 
Latin America] WOLA....WOLA has serves as a conduit through which pro-Castro 
personalities from Latin America have been brought to Washington to testify 
before Congress and to present their views before a variety of forums. [One of 
these people was Ernesto Cardenal, a self-proclaimed Marxist and admirer of 
Fidel Castro who was also a Catholic priest. In November 1977, Cardenal-who 
[later] serve[d] the Sandinista regime-revealed that he was a member of the 
[Marxist Nicaragua] Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN). Another 
WOLA-sponsored church witness was Maryknoll priest Miguel D'Escoto, the current 
Sandinista foreigun minister[!]."
	[13] "[The U.S. Peace Council] is the American branch of the [Marxist 
Soviet] World Peace Council. It was founded in 1979 largely by the initiative 
of the U.S. Communist Party. Michael Myerson,a high ranking CPUSA official, 
becanme the Executive Director of the USPC, and Alexandra (Sandy) Pollack, 
another top CPUSA official, became the USPC's 'international solidarity 
coordinator.'" The main purpose of this new organization intitially was to 
promote the cause of the [Marxist] Sandinistas in Nicaragua. A major player in 
these events was the [USPC]. It organized a National Conference on Nicaragua in 
1979, along with several other radical [Marxist?] groups, to discuss a 
strategy to ensure that the Sandinistas took control....Ron Dellums, Tom 
Harkin, and Walter Fauntroy in the House, and Mark Hatfield and Edward Kennedy 
in the Senate...lent support to this Conference. [Both groups were]...cited in 
several FBI and State Department publications as communist fronts that 
concentrate on undermining the U.S. defense effort and justifying the Soviet 
arms build-up."  

	In the above _NYT_ story: the international Marxist attack on 
Angola is called a "civil war;" Aristede is described as "[t]he exiled 
President of Haiti" without reference to a prior _NYT_ description of him as a 
Marxist; TransAfrica is said to want to offer programs for Foreign Service 
training but no mention is made of the danger to American foreign policy from 
programs offered by an extensive network of international Marxist 
revolutionaries. 

	The Marxist revolutionaries involved with TransAfrica and described by 
the _NYT_ as "too liberal and too sympathetic to third-world leaders" is the 
tip of a dangerous and treasonous iceberg of political war. This IS the 
international communist conspiracy. And there are many TransAfricas. These 
people must be punished for treason but, before that, the leading U.S. 
officials, Presidents and Attorneys General, who knew of this treason yet did 
not use the law to seek the death penalty, should be the first to be punished. 
Treason is, basically, foreign policy not aimed at defense of the nation. 
Espionage is relatively trivial in its harm.

	"It has become difficult in recent years to identify Communist agents 
in the media or other influential organizations. The FBI has been ordered not 
to investigate subversive activity unless there is _already evidence of 
criminal behavior_. This restriction has literally wrecked the Bureau's ability
to monitor Communist subversion....The FBI's number of open cases of security 
investigations dropped from 21,414 in 1973 to 50 in 1979. Investigation of 
Ccommunist _propaganda_ activities in the U.S. is considered even further 
outside the FBI's present charter....Not only the FBI's counter-subverion 
efforts, but the congressional committees that used to investigate 
Communist...subversion. have all been dismantled, including the Senate 
Internal Securities Subcommittee, the Subcommittee on Criminal Laws and 
Procedures, and the House Internal Security Committee. The subversive 
Activities Control Board has also been abolished....there are probably a few
thousand Communist propaganda agents working within the United States today, 
and that over $240 million is being spent annually on such efforts." [James 
Tyson, _Target America_]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	"In the 1960s, Communist literature, including the Communist [p]ress, 
_The Daily World_ and _Political Affairs_, announced four main objectives for 
the Party over the coming years. Abolition of the: 1. House Unamerican 
Activities Committee[,] 2. Senate Internal Security Subcommittee[,] 3. [t]he 
Subversive Activities Control Board[, and] 4. [t]he Attorney General's List of 
Subversive Organizations.
	By 1976 _all of these objectives had been gained, mainly by the actions 
of Democratic leaders in Congress....In 1957 the Communist party launched a new 
front, the National Committee to abolish HUAC....[Those mainly responsible 
for abolishing U.S. defenses against Marxist political war are: Senator William 
Proxmire, Senator Sam Ervin, Republican Mark Hatfield, Senator Edward Kennedy, 
Senator Joseph Biden, Frank Church, Otis Pike, President Ford and his Attorney 
General, Edward Levi...Reagan...attempted to restore some of the FBI's ability
