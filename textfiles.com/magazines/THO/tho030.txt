                             Earvin "Magic" Johnson


    This is a book report on a basketball star by the name of Earvin "Magic" 

Johnson.  Basketball entered Earvin's scope of interest during the early 

childhood stages of his life. He was raised in the west side of Michigan where 

basketball there was known throughout the state as a giant powerhouse. All 

through the junior high school years of his life he played on the school team, 

at Everett High, and the team were consistent winners. Because of his 

outstanding play, he was invited to join some of the best college basketball 

teams in the nation. Some of his choices were North Carolina, Michigan, Notre 

Dame, Maryland and UCLA. The highlight of his recruitment process came when 

Indiana came down to play Michigan State. Bobby Knight, the coach for the 

Indiana basketball team who was a legend at the time, paid Earvin a visit. 

Although he was honored to be selected by Knight, Earvin was not promised a 

starting position on the team, so he turned that school down also. For his 

final choice, Earvin finally decided to attend Michigan State where he would 

be gauranteed a starting position. The team, who finished 10-17 the previous 

year, needed some new blood and Earvin said that,"The University of Michigan 

would be a contender with me or without me. But Michigan State would be a lot 

better with me."


     
     Earvin "Magic" Johnson was born on August 14, 1959, and the middle of 

seven children. He was raised in Lansing, Michigan, about a half-hour from 

Detroit. He and his family squeezed into three small bedrooms ont he second 

floor which was always crowded because of the amount of people in the house 

all the time. With so many kids in the family to take care constantly, his 

parents didn't really have a lot of money to spend but they always had enough 

to eat and tended to get along fine without any major financial problems. 

Earvin attended Everett High School, where basketball was known throughout 

the state of Michigan as a basketball powerhouse. Everyone in the 

neighborhood supported the school and went to all of their games since it was 

such a big event at the time. Earvin was part of the varsity basketball squad 

and sent his team to the state championships in 1976. The team became state 

champions during that year which happened to be Earvin's senior year there. 

Because of such national and local attention upon the team and himself he was 

looked upon but numbers of college scouts. His final choice was to go to The 

University of Michigan where he was much needed because of the teams previous 

season record of 10-17. Michigan State was in the Big Ten which is one of the 

hardest conferences in NCAA basketball to play in. Earvin boosted the teams 

confidence in the very first year and improved their record to 25-5 which was 

an outstanding turn-around from the previous years. 



     An experience that had a strong influence on Earvin had to be the most 

popular of his problems - his announcement of the AIDS virus. Earvin had 

already played a number of strong solid years in the National Basketball 

Association (NBA) and had announced his retirement due to his infection with 

the HIV virus, which causes AIDS. For a while he was feeling much remorse 

over this because the public wanted him to still play. But he got his chance. 

He was elected to play on the United States Olympic team in the 1992 Summer 

Olympics in Barcelona. He and other members of the team such as Michael 

Jordan, Charles Barkley, and Patrick Ewing led the United States to a gold 

medal and finished the games with a perfect record, going undefeatedagainst 

all the foreign countries they played. But still the fact remained that he 

was infected with the AIDS virus. So instead of worrying about his disease, 

he formed many AIDS research programs to help find a cure for the disease 

which is sweeping the nation. So far, Earvin has helped to raise over $6 

million for AIDS research.



     The only unusual qualities or abilites that may have contributed to 

Magic Johnson's fame and success is something that not every person is born 

with - outstanding height and incredible vision. Johnson, being 6' 6", he 

towered over most opponents by "slamming" over them. This also contributed 

to his Most Valuable Player awards, which he recieved three times for his 

scoring and playing ability. Another thing Magic may have been noted for is 

his vision. In basketball vision is probably more important than skills 

itself. You have to know where all the players are and who to give it to in 

order to have effective scoring. Johnson was known for the "no-look" , behind 

the back, and bounce passes. His passing and skills led his team, the Los 

Angeles Lakers, to much success over his span with the team.


     
     Several of Earvin "Magic" Johnson's outstanding accomplishments would 

have to start with his fame and fortune in the NBA. He played for the Lakers 

since 1979 and was named the NBA's Most Valuable Player three times. Another 

of Johnson's accomplishments is bringing home the gold from Barcelona in the 

1992 Summer Olympics. He was named to the team because of his partial 

commitment to the Lakers before announcing his retirement because of the HIV 

virus. He played with the best of the best including great players such as 

Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, and the legendary Larry Bird. This 

astonishing team was referred to by many Americans as "The Dream Team". A 

suitable name for the right people since they were undefeated in the games, 

totally obliterating each opponent without much trouble. Another 

accomplishment in his life that does not have to do with basketball would 

have to be his founding of the Magic Johnson Foundation, which was put 

together to help put an end to the AIDS virus which he himself is infected 

with. He is also the author of his own book about AIDS awareness, "What You 

Can Do to Avoid AIDS", to try and teach the young Americans about the disease 

itself and what they can do to prevent themselves from getting the disease.


     
     The person' that probably had the most effect on his life would have to 

be his wife, Cookie. He met her during his NBA Lakers carrer during a game at 

home in the Coliseum. She always stood behind him through everything that he 

has been through. From the NBA Finals against Chicago to the announcment of 

his infection with the AIDS virus, she was always there for him. Actaully, 

his wife helped him set up his foundation for AIDS research so she too could 

be a part of the fight against the disease. Also another person who is a 

major part of his life is his son, Earvin Johnson III, who was born on June 

15, 1992. The baby was tested for the AIDS virus which he may have obtained 

from Earvin but the tests came back negative. Johnson would like to see his 

son, Earvin, follow in his footsteps and be another NBA great like he himself 

was.


      
      One of the biggest problems that arose during Magic's life would have 

to be his announcment that he had contracted the AIDS virus and was forced to 

retire from the NBA under advice from his doctors. This was a major blow not 

only to the team but the general public also. The team was not expecting it 

and neither was anyone else. This was very hard for Johnson to explain 

because he loved the sport of basketball and didn't want to leave the team or 

the sport forever. He resolved this by conquering his fear of eventual death 

and did something about it. He set up thousands of organizations to help 

inform people about the virus and to keep them aware of the disease that is 

becoming a major problem in the United States today. He set up his own 

organization, the Magic Johnson Foundation which has already helped to 

raise over $6 million in funds to help find a cure for the AIDS virus.


     
     Three incidents that I would feature in a movie of Magic Johnson's life 

would have to be chronologically in the following order (A,B,C) :


   
   A: His acception into the University of Michigan and bringing them to the 

national finals in only their second season. He brought the teams record up 

drastically and boosted the teams confidence for many years to come.

   
   B: His carrer in the NBA with the Los Angeles Lakers. He brought this 

team to two back-to-back National Championships. He was the Most Valuable 

Player for three years in a row during his reign over the L.A. Lakers. He 

also dazzled many basketball fans around the world with his passes and 

miraculous shots to win the game in the final seconds.

   
   C: Finally I would bring up his dedication to the foundation for the 

research of AIDS. He is dedicating most of his life to the research for 

finding the final cure for the AIDS virus.


     
     This book has had a slight influence on me and my way of thinking and 

view upon life. I think that Magic Johnson had a large impact on the world's 

view upon life in general. His perspective on life is to never give up. Also 

his view on life was to strive for your goals no matter how big the obstacle 

is that stands in your way.
