                            PiP the Angry Youth

  Well, I guess that I shall give you a little back ground of this all...
Fusion has several handles <the lowness of a lamer> and thinks he's bad shit
because he Hacked and Crashed a local board called World Of Peace.  He took it
upon himself to become a complete jerk to me and my very good friend Panther
for no other reason than he got kicked off of Mayhem!, World of Peace and
Asylum.  He hasn't any friends and has a $50 price on his head set up by a
person that will remain Annonomous, we'll call him Percy X.  Well, Percy X and
Fusion go to the same school and Fusion has a vandetta against Percy X for
some reason or other so he fucks up Percy X's computer by formatting the HD
remotely.

DragonStrike = Fusion





Here you go... enjoy a flamming
