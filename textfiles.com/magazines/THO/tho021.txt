  Welcome to the twenty first installment of THO, in this issue I shall
  be adressing the subject of (dum dum dum...) DEATH!!!  Of course this
  won't be your everyday run of the mill story keep in mind, but none
  the less it shall be rather good.

                              Dead

  Who would've thought I would go out like this?  On my back, alone and
  light headed.  None of us saw the gas coming down the corridor until
  it was way too late for any of us.  At first it seemed like nothing
  was going to happen, but it took about an hour for me to notice
  anything different.  First the room started spinning around and
  around, I think I heard someone scream for help, but I wasn't able to
  see what direction it was coming from let alone help them.

  I lived the charmed life, protected from everything on the outside, I
  had a wife and kids.  My God, what will my wife think?  It's too late
  for worry, but not for regrets.  I can't remember the last time I told
  her that I loved her.  My dear, I hope to see you on the other side.

  What about work?  I had alot more to do with my life, I never bothered
  anyone in my life and look where it got me!  No, I must stop feeling
  sorry for myself.  I have to get ready for the afterlife, if there is
  one.  What if there isn't a God?  What if this is just the end of it
  and I am swallowed by the nothingness that is death?  What if... What
  if... What if...  No more what ifs, what is about to happen is all
  that matters.  I'm going to die here without anyone to hold me,
  without anyone to grieve for me.  Everyone else is allready gone, the
  poor fellows.  We're all alone and not another cockroach to speak to.

  Good bye cruel world, good bye.
