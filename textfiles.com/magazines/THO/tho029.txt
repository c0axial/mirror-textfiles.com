The Hand of Fangs  by Exodus             

(*]}=--------------------------- CHAPTER I -------------------------------={[*)
                                Swamp Water
  
  "Damn it!", cursed Kalek as he made his way through the swamp.  How come Var
insists on living in the worst places known to man.  In truth, he didn't
know Var extremely well.  Born in Technia, as a poor wretch Kalek was lucky
indeed that Var had taken him in under his wing.  Technia was the capital
of New California, a city of thieves and rogues where there were powerful
corporations that ruled it with an iron-fist.  Var was a businessman of
sorts... he is a mercenary.  Var led a highly skilled cyber-netic
group of rogues called the Hand of Fangs.  He trained Kalek in mostly
everything he knows now.  Besides Var being a powerful character
in Technia and a rogue, Kalek didn't know much more about his personal life. 
Kalek had wondered why Var had summoned him to meet him in one of his secret 
bases.  Kalek mused that it was for a "favor".
     
     A sudden swishing in the swamp jerked Kalek's mind from the past to the
present.  Before he could react a tentacle the size of a boa-constricter
was wrapped around his wraist and dragged him under the water.  Kalek's 
warrior instincts instantly took over.  He remained calm, deathly calm.  He 
knew he couldn't reach his neuro-sword in his current predicamant for his 
arms were flat against his taught body.  He only hoped that the creature would
bring him up above the water so he could stand a better chance.  Luck was
shining on him today.  The tentacle did raise itself above the water, giving
Kalek a breath of air, and a chance if anything to study the
situation.  Stupid creature he thought, to give away the obvious advantage
it had had on him.  Kalek carefully examined his foe.  The creature was
12-feet tall and had the look of a huge grisly-bear, it had two
tentacles pertruding from each side of it's body.  Two horns about 4 inchs
long jutted from it's huge head."A raglor",Kalek said aloud.Raglors were
common outside in the swamp-wastes of New California's wilderness.They
were toxic mutations brought on by too much industrialization in
concentrated areas.Companies would dump large amounts of waste wherever
they felt,corrupting many of the wildlife in the immediate area outside
of cities and heavily populated sectors.Kalek had to think fast,for the
raglor was pulling him in,to suffocate him,quicker than he liked.He
examined all his surroundings...A rock behind the raglor,a few trees,and
Ah a branch hanging down 4 feet from the raglor itself.Kalek immediately
thought of a plan of action.His body like a spring he waited until the
creature pulled him right under the branch.He somehow managed to get one
leg free and kicked the raglor square in the chest.The creature
roared,not sure of what to expect from this clever foe.While the blow
didn't knock the creature over it certainly did stun it.And unfortunetly
it lessend it's grip on Kalek.That was all the time he needed.He didn't
have enough time to get his neuro-sword yet,so with all his strength he
mananged to rip the branch from the tree.Before he knew it the monster
was upon him again,but this time he had a weapon of sorts.He repeatedly
clubbed the monster in the head, until it was stunned and let him go.Then
he drew his neuro-sword."Sleep tight", he growled as he drove the blade
deep into the monster's skull.
     He was so exhausted that he failed to notice a lithe figure jump on the
rocks."Ah,I see you've already met the locals",Var chuckled."You have
become more of a warrior I see"."You mean to tell me,that you watched
that whole battle",gasped Kalek."It was quite entertaining I might
add",mused Var."Why did you not help me?" quizzed Kalek."Oh I would
have,if it got too messy",said Var."Yeah right",Kalek acidly
replied."Come,come,I have taught you everything you know about fighting
Kalek",Var said."It wasn't enough I might add",Kalek said dryly."Come
follow me,let's get down to business",said Var.
     The walk to Var's secret base,was longer than Kalek had wished for."I liked
it better when your main base was in the city",said Kalek."Really?,I
kind of like this place it's peaceful",said Var."You never were one for
the swamp now, were you?",asked Var."Who is?",replied Kalek."Besides,the
swamp keeps clowns out like you",said Var."So tell me,how is the Hand of
Fangs doing?",asked Kalek."Business as usual,you know",said Var."We only
consist of four members right now",he said."Don't worry you'll meet them
soon enough",Var added.
     The two beings moved swiftly and silently through the swamp.Their dull
silver bodies carefully concealed by thier newly installed comouflage
circuits. Not a sound echoed from the ground where they walked,not a
branch cracked under their swift footsteps.With their camouflage
circuits,they blended in perfectly with the immediate surroundings.Not
even a foot print was left under their wake. They were doing what they
were programmed for,to hunt and kill.The swamp did not deter these
creatures one bit.They seemed to "glide" along the ground,indeed even
the most skilled warriors would have trouble spotting them.They were
starting to get excited now,for they were only 10 minutes away from
their "prey".
     "Something is not right",whispered Kalek."We are being followed",he finished.
"I've known that for the past half-hour",grinned Var."I have been
leading us and our pursuers in a big wide circle",said Var."I don't want
to lead them to the base" ,stated Var."I though maybe it was just a
coincidence,but I'm positive we ARE being followed",Var said."I've have
noticed too,that our enemies do not make any tracks",said
Var."Interesting,assassins perhaps?",mused Kalek."Of course,the main
question is,what type?",asked Var."My infra-eye,detects no body heat on
the ground where the creatures have walked,only ours",said Var."You
think robots?", asked Kalek."I think so",answered Var.Var pointed over
to a pile of huge rocks, "Over there,we'll duck behind those and see
what the hell is on our trail"."Good idea",Kalek agreed.
     They immdiately ducked behind the rocks,and sat waiting for their predators.
"I bet they see in the infared spectrum",said Kalek."Here take this",he
gave Var a small purple capsule.Var gave him a questioning look."Just
take it",said Kalek. "It reduces your body's heat output,no risk taking
chances".Var stared at the capsule one last time then said "Down the
hatch"."Quiet look",whispered Var. "They are robots",Kalek
confirmed."And smart ones at that,they know were around here
somewhere.",Var said."They seem to have a camouflage circuit,which
means..", Var broke off."Which means what?",demanded Kalek."Which means
were in deep trouble", replied Var."What is it?",asked Kalek "I know
your keeping something from me". "Don't worry about it,I'll tell you
later,let's just finish these off",said Var. "Agreed",said Kalek.And
with that he unsheathed his neuro-sword."Don't you ever use a
gun?",asked Var."Na,I like to do things the old-fashioned way",said
Kalek.Var pulled out his subcor rifle."A beauty",he said.He also pulled
out his phalcon blade and placed it over his left hand.Looking a little
like the end of a hockey stick, except made of orionan,one of the
hardest substances in the known galaxy,it was also sharpened to the
point of perfection.A deadly weapon,one that rogues loved to use.Var
bent low and prepared to fire his rifle.Unfortunately Kalek and Var did
not know that they had led themselves into a trap.They failed to notice
a third assassin behind thier position.Just as Var fired his rifle,it
too fired a sheer blast of heat in Kaleks direction."Look out boy!,looks
like there smarter than we predicted.",yelled Var.Kalek barely dodged
the shot,and immediately charged the robot with his blade drawn.Var
meanwhile continued his barage against the other two robots.The third
assassin readied to fire another shot,but before it could react in
time,Kalek was on him.Using his sword,he plunged it right into the creatures
chest,then with a ripping noise,brought his sword upward through the
head. "Careful!" roared Var,"I want one of these assassins head's
intact"."They probably have a servo-chip inside,with that information I
can find out who's trying to kill me",Var said.Even with it's chest torn
open and wires hanging out,the assassin continued on.With no more time
to fire it's weapons,it decided on a more subtle approach,strangling."Oh
no you don't",said Kalek sensing the robots thoughts. With one mighty
thrust he jabbed his sword into the robots armpit,then began to move it
in a certain pattern."Feels good?,doesn't it metal man?",he sneered at
it.Then with one swoop cut the entire arm off,with a thud.The robot
though, quick to react brought it's other hand around Kaleks arm.It
promptly began pulling, very hard with a jerking motion,intended to rip
Kaleks arm out of the socket. "ARGGHHHH",yelled Kalek.The cracking of
bone was heard,as Kaleks arm began to loosen visibly and tear.With one
final kick he nailed the assassin in the head completely severing it's
motor circuits,therefore disabling it.Meanwhile Var's had been in a
firefight with the other robots.Quickly swallowing a pain-reliviating
pill,Kalek was then back beside Var."Little banged up eh?",said
Var."Just keep 'em busy,I sure hope this pill's effects doesn't wear off
anytime soon",said Kalek. Kalek then promptly dove to the ground and
starting making his way out toward a huge tree,near the assassins.A shot
wizzed by Kaleks head,too close.He felt the heat of the blast,and it
made him feel slightly sick.He had almost made it to the tree when one
of the assassin's noticed him.It promptly started shooting in his
direction.Kalek got up and ran like hell to the tree."Keep 'em pinned
down", he yelled at Var.He then used his neuro-sword to cut a large
enough hole in the tree so that it would fall right toward the
assassins.While not enough force to kill them,it did stun them.For
enough time,so that Var could run up and join the melee.
      "Greetings",said Var as he went into a bow,then promptly dug his phalcon
into the robots stomach."I want what's inside your head,that's all",Var
stated. Kalek quickly dove in the battle,using his strength and his
sword to even out the odds."Cut off their heads!",said Var.Who just
successfully chopped off the head of his foe.Kalek did the same,sending
his oppenants head flying right into a tree. "Well look's like we won't
be using that one's circuits",laughed Var."Hey at least I killed the
stupid thing",replied Kalek."Good job at that",said Var.
      Using his phalcon,Var quickly cut through the assassin robots head,locating
the circuit he so desperately desired."Ah ha",he grinned."All in all,a
rather sloppy job,I might add",said Kalek."Exactly which leads me to
believe,that they were just merely stalling us from our objective",said
Var."I have a bad feeling about this",said Kalek."I'm getting tired of
your bad feelings",replied Var. "Quickly though let's return to my base".
      It took them the better of two hours to make their way back to the base.
The whole time they were making sure no one was following them.Once they
had, however reached the base,Var's worst fears were awakened.He simply
pointed at where the base at once been "It's been completely
destroyed."

                                Prisioners


        The three figures moved slowly through the swamp.Their arms and
legs were attached together by laser straps.If they moved one of their
limbs too much in a certain direction,then the strap would get very
tight and uncomfortable.They were captives,prisoners,and their pace
showed it."Get moving!",yelled a guard as he jabbed the male prisoner on
the right."I'm moving as fast as I can!",yelled back Snakes."Perhaps,if
you would be so kind to loosen our bonds we wouldn't walk so
slowly",spit Snakes."Shut up vermin",snapped the guard,and with that he
promptly slammed a psy-club into Snakes side.
        "Perhaps,you should have tried a more subtle approach",whispered
Lori into Snakes ear."I thought it was subtle enough",replied
Snakes."Apparently not",said Lori."Apparently not",agreed Snakes."I just
wish we could figure out who are captives are",whispered Snakes."I've
been thinking about that for the last hour or so,and I still can't pin
anything down yet"."They are obviously Var's enemies,perhaps one of the
corporations?",asked Lori."I would assume so,but which one?,Var isn't
too popular with many of them",said Snakes."Be quiet!,or I shall make
the bonds even tighter!",threatened a guard.
        Snakes decided to be quiet,he didn't want to push the guard and
believed the guard would go along with his threat and possibly worse.For
now Snakes decided that he,Lori,and Kayzo should remain quiet,and play
it by ear.Something a experienced rogue knew how to do.
        In truth Snakes wondered about the ambush,that had practically
destroyed their base.He had to admit to himself that he couldn't
honestly figure out who had captured them and why.These guards were
obviously cyber-guards,half-man and half-machine.If he,Lori and Kayzo
could get their weapons back,then they would be back in
action.But,seeing each guard heavily armored in blackver armor,(as hard
to cut through as solid stone),and armed with a heavy subcor rifle,he
decided against it.And what an unexpected time the ambush had come
at.They were all sleeping after a long mercenary raid,in Technia.Being
trained warriors they were all armed and ready within 3 minutes,but by
then it was almost too late.Using the subcor rifles the eight guards had
punctured holes in key positions of the bases armor,then raided
through.He and Kayzo,the cyber-ninja,had managed to kill two guards,but
then they had overwhelmed them.Lori,a beautiful netwarrior,and an
accomplished sniper,had managed to take down a guard too,during the
ambush.Snakes cursed himself for the easiness in which the base was
taken over in.If the base was in the city they would have been more
prepared for an attack.But,since the base was in the swamp,they thought
no one would attack the base,let alone find it.As second in command of
the Hand of Fangs mercenary group,he felt largely respnsible for the
blunder.Oh well,he thought to himself,that's the past,now I must
concentrate on getting the hell out of here.
        Three of the five guards huddled together and were apparently
discussing something."I wonder what's going on?",asked Lori."I sense
movement all around us in a five-hundred foot radius",said Kayzo."Can
you sense what kind of creatures they are?",asked Snakes."I'm not
sure,but I believe they are raglors",answered Kayzo."How many?",quizzed
Lori."About ten to my best estimates",replied Kayzo."Hmmm,I've fought
with those kind of odds before,I just wish I was armed and ready",stated
Snakes.
        Before Lori or Kayzo could reply,one of the guards walked up to
them."We have detected movement all around us",stated the guard."We know
of your fighting prowess,espiecially in the swamp.So we have decided to
hand you back your weapons"."But make one mistake or attack against us
and we will be forced to kill you without incident",stated the
guard."Looks like we don't have a choice",said Lori."Apparently
not,though I don't like the situation at all",Snakes said."With all of
us armed and the five guards with thier rifles it appears the odds are
practically even",Kayzo said.
        "Enough talk,we will give you your weapons now,be quick for they
will probably attack soon enough",and with that the guard unbonded them
and led them over to a floating container that was containing their
weapons.Snakes pulled out his plasma gun and his phalcon blade.With his
main weapons he felt more secure of the current situation at hand,but he
still didn't like the conditions.Lori grabbed her plasma rifle,with an
extended scope,which she used frequently.She also grabbed a small stak
knife.It's surprisingly small blade was extremely deadly and sharp,as
many of her enemies would agree.What was amazing about the knife though
was that it retracted into the handle and was only a molecule thick.The
last to get his weapons was Kayzo,and rightfully so.He was the quietest
of the group,but was also the best warrior by far.For what seemed like a
half-hour Kayzo was adding weapons to his repertoire.For even though the
guards had thought they had stripped the companions of all of thier
weapons,they were wrong.Kayzo was always armed,always.For he was a
hunter,a true warrior.Quickly scanning the container he saw what he
wanted.He took a plasma gun,two stak knives,a techmancer sword,15
"thought" shurikens,2 containers of plastic explosives,and a laser rope
with a grappling hook.He glanced knowingly at the techmancer sword.Two
hundred years old and passed down in his family for generations,it was
an honor to fight with such a marvel.The blade was technologically a
miracle,for it would take whatever shape of a sword the master so
decided.A scimitar,broadsword,longsword,the possibilties were endless.
        The party examined the nearby area looking for a good place to
fight the inevitable battle.They already were in a clearing of some
sorts.A few trees surrounded the area,a few 30 feet tall or higher.Some
of the trees were even thick enough to climb on,Kayzo took note of.There
was also a few boulders in the immediate area,possibly cover or some
other advantage.There was fog all around beyond the clearing making the
whole scene a little eerie,and making it hard to tell where thier foes
were going to come from.The ground here was slighty soggy,but not
entirely swamp muck,so they could gain a footing.
        Snakes quickly looked over his friends.Lori was extremely
beautiful,her blue-sky eyes looking around,scanning the area for the
enemy.She was holding her rifle close.He could tell she didn't like this
at all.Being a sniper she liked to see where her opponents are coming
from,but with all this fog,she couldn't make out anything.Snakes then
looked at Kayzo,who was just standing there still,apparently
concentrating.How calm Kayzo seemed,perhaps that was the scary part
decided Snakes.Kayzo was born a fighter,it was as natural to him as
eating and walking was for Snakes.He definately felt safer with Kayzo in
the group.A quick lookover of the guards revealed their readiness for
the upcoming battle.Thier subcor rifles were held and ready to be shot
at any moment danger arose.Snakes wondered how good those rifles would
be at close range,however once the battle begun.True the subcor rifles
were very good weapons but they needed a far enough range to fully be
effective.He suspected that the guards had a few secrets up thier
sleeves,maybe a weapon or something,Snakes wasn't sure.
        All of the sudden Kayzo awoke from his trance,and started toward
the patch of trees."Where are you going?",Lori curiously asked,"To
even the odds",said Kayzo with a smile.Kayzo walked easily across the
swamp muck,without a sound and leaving not a single footprint.He walked
with the gracefullness of a hunting cat,and with a single step was
easily climbing up the tree and then had dissapeared into the fog."He
may be our greatest asset in this battle",said Snakes."He always is our
greatest asset in any battle",Lori replied with a wink.
        The party quietly possitioned themselves behind the various
rocks and trees.Snakes taking a position behind the biggest rock and
between one of the huge trees.Lori was about fifteen feet to his
left,wedged in between two rocks.The guards took various other positions
in the clearing.
        Very close by,they heard a roar,then the roar turned into a
wimper,then they heard no more."Kayzo",Snakes grimly said aloud.All of
the sudden four huge shapes emerged from the fog."Yep,there raglors all
right",said Lori.With that,she readied her rifle and shot a blast right
into the monsters head.It had been a dead shot,the monster died
instantly.However,now the raglors were ready,and with a mighty roar all
three charged the party.
        They first attacked the nearest guard,who didn't have enough
time to fire his subcor rifle.Three tentacles grabbed him all around his
body.One draped around his neck,the other slithered across his
waist,and another latched on firmly to his right arm.A look of sheer
terror crossed the guards face,for he knew he was doomed.None of the
companions dared fire thier weapons for they didn't want to accidentally
hurt the guard.Snakes immediately started rushing over to help the poor
victim.His phalcon blade on his left hand he was running as fast as he
could.But,Snakes wasn't fast enough,with a sickening ripping noise the
two raglors literally tore apart the unfortunate guards body.
        "Butchers!",yelled Snakes as he charged the two raglors.
Meanwhile,two more raglors emerged from the fog,this time very close to
Lori's position.She cracked another shot at one of them,but only managed
this time to hit it square in the leg.The raglor immediately fell to the
ground howling in pain.Lori then blasted the thing to kingdom come,with
grim satisfaction.However this allowed the other raglor enough time to
gain enough ground toward her.It's tentacles quickly wrapped around her
legs and started to pull her in,where it could get a stronger grip and
kill her.Luckily it was only one raglor not two,or Lori would have had
the same fate that the unfortunate guard had had.Grasping at
anything,fingers clawing the ground desperately,Lori was trying as hard
as she could not to get pulled close enough to death itself.Her fingers
bleeding she was trying hard,but unfortunately not hard enough.The raglor
now had her close enough to kill her,but instead it was bringing her
right up to it's face.The monster apparently didn't want to strangle
her,it wanted to taste her blood right away.She cryed out in
desperation,she couldn't even get out her stak knife to hack the
monster.Lori reasoned though,that the blade couldn't really kill the
monster anyway.The monster reeled her in,she was incredibly close now to
the monster's mouth,it was aiming to rip out her jugular.She could smell
the creatures hot breath down her neck."No!",she cried out.The creatures
mouth slowly started descending on her neck.She could feel her own warm
blood start to trickle down her neck.
        She suddenly felt consciousness ebbing away....Then before she
knew it the dreadful pressing stopped.The mouth had released it's deadly
grip and the tentacles relaxed immediately.She opened her eyes,to see a
techmancer sticking through the monster,it had apparently been driven
right through the heart with deadly precision.The monster slumped over
revealing Kayzo on the other side."Are you alright?",he asked."Oh
yeah,just fine thought I had almost lost it though",replied Lori."I did
too there for a moment",Kayzo said with a smile.He then moved off,with
the noise of a feather falling,as he went to help Snakes.
        Snakes was successfully keeping the two raglors at bay,with his
phalcon blade,and a stak knife that he had concealed the whole time.When
a tentacle would entrap him he would quickly stab it repeatly until it
retracted.He had even managed to cut two of the tentacles off entirely.
        Kayzo had to decide on a plan of action,Snakes couldn't hold off
two raglors indefinitely.He noticed that both monsters were near some
trees,an idea hit him.He immediately climbed and nearby tree and jumped
over to one of the trees,so that he was roughly about six feet over one
of the raglor's heads.He drew his techmancer then drew a deep
breath.Pointing it downward he jumped downward,sending the blade on a
trajectory right toward the monster's skull.With a successful thud the
blade drove about two feet into the monsters head,cleaving the brain in
two and actually shattering the top of it's spinal column.
        "Nice work",said Snakes,"Thank you very much,that frees my other
hand....".Snakes then drew his plasma gun and shot point blank right
down the raglor's mouth.It's head instantly exploded,killing it."There's
more",said Kayzo,"There's always more",replied Snakes,pointing to five
new raglors that had just appeared out of the fog.
        The companions were so busy fighting the raglors that they
failed to detect more movement close by.But these figures weren't
raglors,as a matter of fact there were 2 dozen of them moving silently
toward the clearing.They quickly surrounded the clearing and waited for
the signal.Then it came,a brief flash of light from their leader.They
then calmly walked into the clearing with thier rifles raised,ready to
take their captives.
        "Uh-oh",said Snakes to Lori."More company",she said,looking at
2 dozen guards that had just entered the clearing."Maybe they'll
help",stated Lori."Oh they'll help alright",cursed Snakes.
        The guards were wearing heavy armor and were carrying subcor
rifles with them,they looked basically the same as the other guards that
had captured the companions before.Except one of them had a red and
yellow seal on his chest,Snakes reasoned that he was the leader of the
whole detachment of these soldiers.
        The leader said something to the guards,and then the firing
began.The whole clearing was amess with laser fire as the guards with
their rifles blew away the raglors.It lasted about 15 minutes to mop all
the remaining monsters up.Snakes and Lori took cover behind a huge
boulder,while the firefight went on.There was no use running for them
now,these guards were obviously more equiped and could track them if
they did try to escape.
        Once all the raglors were killed,Snakes and Lori rose slowly
from the safetly of the boulder."You are our prisoners",said the leader
guard."It would appear so",Snakes arrogantly replied."Keep your tongue
still,or I shall have the pleasure of cutting it off.",spitted the
leader."Remove their weapons",barked the leader.The guards quickly and
thoughly had the two friends disarmed and imprisoned again.
        "Now my,my",said the leader to the original guards that had
captured the companions in the first place."It appears you have failed
all my expectations,your mission was very sloppily done,our boss does
not like messy affairs"."I will enjoy watching your deaths",laughed the
leader."Execute them",and with that he motioned to three armed guards
nearby.They promptly fired their weapons at the guards,disintigrating
them into nothingness."See how I treat my enemies",said the leader to
Snakes."Real lovely",replied Snakes."Be quiet",the leader slapped Snakes
real hard across the face.
        Within a few moments the whole group was on there way,wherever
that may be reasoned Snakes.In all the confusion something had
overlooked Lori,that now she noticed.She couldn't locate Kayzo anywhere
in the group.She immediately began to worry about her friend,and what
had happened to him.She sensed someone was looking at her,so she turned
and saw Snakes.He obviously could tell what her questions were.He
answered them with the biggest smirk,she had ever seen.Kayzo was nowhere
to be seen.................
