Welcome to THO #24, in this issue I shall share the lyrics of one of my
favorite songs, Punk Rock Girl by the Dead Milkmen.  This song appears
on the album "Beezlebubba" and I really really think that you should go
out and buy it.  Peace.

"Punk Rock Girl"

One Saturday I took a walk to Zipperhead,
I net a girl there and she almost knocked me dead,
PUNK ROCK GIRL please look at me,
PUNK ROCK GIRL what do you see,
Let's travel round the world just you and me Punk Rock Girl.

I tapped her on the shoulder and said "Do you have a beau?"
She looked at me and smiled and said she did not know,
PUNK ROCK GIRL give me a chance,
PUNK ROCK GIRL let's go slam dance,
We'll dress like Minnie Pearl just you and me Punk Rock Girl.

We went to the Philly Pizza Company and ordered some hot tea,
The waitress said "well, no, we only have it iced."
So we jumped up on the table and shouted "ANARCHY!",
And someone played a Beach Boys song on the jukebox,
It was California Dreamin' and so we started screamin',
On such a winter's daaaaaaay!

She took me to her parents for a Sunday meal,
Her father took one look at me and he began to squeal,
PUNK ROCK GIRL well it makes no sense,
PUNK ROCK GIRL your daddy's a vice president,
Your dad's the Duke of Earl yeah, you're for me Punk Rock Girl.

We went to a shopping mall and laughed at all the shoppers,
The security guards trailed us to a record shop,
We asked for Mojo Nixon, they said "He don't work here!",
We said "If you don't got Mojo Nixon then your store could use some fixin!"

We got into her car away we started rollin',
I said, "How much you pay for this?", 
She said "Nothing, man, it's stolen!",
PUNK ROCK GIRL you look so wild,
PUNK ROCK GIRL let's have a child,
We'll name her Minnie Pearl just you and me,
Eat fudge banana swirl just you and me,
We'll travel round the world,
Just you and me Punk Rock Girl!
