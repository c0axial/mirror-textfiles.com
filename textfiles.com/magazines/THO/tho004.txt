  This file would just happen to be an assorted collection of poetry and
other pieces of shit that some I wrote, and the rest others wrote.  You can
rest easily knowing that I will only take credit for my own works and noone
else's.  But the shit that is someone else's that is here is only here 
because I thought that you would enjoy it :).


                            Queen Berets

FALLING FARIES FROM THE SKY
I BROKE A NAIL, I COULD CRY
I DON'T LIKE HOW MY TUSH SWAYS
WE ARE THE FAGS OF THE QUEEN BERETS

BILL CLINTON'S WORDS UPON MY EARS
YOU GUYS HAVE RIGHTS TO BE GLAD YOU'RE QUEERS
I ONCE WAS SCARED NOW I'M O.K.
CAUSE I'M A FAG IN THE QUEEN BERETS

PUT SILVER EAR CLIPS ON MY NUTS
I LOVE THE PAIN, NOW SPANK MY BUTT
THE WAY YOU WALK IS AWFLLY CUTE
I SURE WOULD LIKE TO PACK YOUR CHUTE

THIS ARMY STUFF IS PRETTY SLICK
FREE MEALS AND CLOTHES AND LOTS OF DICKS
WHEN I RETIRE I STILL GET PAID
I THANK YOU BILL FROM THE QUEEN BERETS

[Dunno who wrote it, but it came into my possesion, nice eh?]


                              SUICIDE

MY BLOOD IS DRIPPING RUBY RED,
MAN, PRETTY SOON I'LL BE DEAD,
FILL THE TUB WITH SUCH HOT WATER,
MAYBE NOW SHE'LL KNOW I LOVE HER,
I AM GETTING VERY SICKLY,
NOW WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH ME?
SUICIDE'S NOT THE WAY TO GO,
DO I WANT TO DIE?  HELL NO.
BUT NOW IT'S TOO LATE FOR ME,
WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG TO SEE,
THAT NOW ALL SHE'LL DO NOW IS CRY,
I'M SCARED, I DON'T WANT TO DIE,
THE ROOM IS SPINNING ROUND AND ROUND,
I'M GONNA DIE WITHOUT A SOUND.

[Ok.. ok.. so I have an emotional side to myself, so fucking shoot me. :) ]



                             DIE

Your eyes are like twin pools,
like twin pools of piss.
You are such a fool,
you I will not miss.

Your lips are like velvet,
they're tattered and torn.
I don't want to kiss it,
you should'nt've been born.

Your humor makes me laugh,
and the rest of you too.
It's that of riff-raff,
HEY!  That's you!

FIRST PERIOD ALGEBRA II

OH TEACHER, YOU WONDER WHY I DON'T MAKE A PEEP,
WELL THAT'S BASICALLY BECAUSE I'M FAST ASLEEP.
YOUIR CLASS, TO ME, IS SUCH A DAMN BORE,
I HOPE I DON'T WAKE MY BUDDIES IF I BEGIN TO SNORE.
YOU GO ON AND ON ABOUT THE SLOPE OF A LINE,
YOUR VOICE IS BEGINNING TO NUMB MY MIND.
LOOK AT THE CHALKBOARDS, THEY'RE FULL OF DUST,
IF I WERE THE TIN MAN, I WOULD'VE BEGUN TO RUST.
WEHN YOU WALK AROUND YOU JIGGLE YOUR BUTT,
AND WHEN YOU TURN PROFILE, LOOK AT THAT GUT!
FIRST ROW, THIRD SEAT, THAT'S ME, I'M DROOLING,
IF SONEONE SAYS THEY'RE ENTHRALLED, THEY'VE GOT TO BE FOOLING.
