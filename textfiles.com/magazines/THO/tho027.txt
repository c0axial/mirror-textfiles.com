LIFE OF POE

  Edgar Allan Poe was born on January 19th, 18O9 in Boston Mass.  He was

orphaned at the age of three and was then raised by John and Francis

Allan in 1811 but unofficially adopted.  John Allan was a wealthy

buisnessman from Richmond Virginia, but sadly enough he didn't approve

of Edgar's literary stridings (we'll get into that later). (         )



  Edgar was an excellent athelete and a briliant student at Manor House

School in Stoke Newington, England between the years 1815 and 1820, but, as

I said before, his guardian didn't approve of his literary ambitions and

decided to send him to University of Virginia in 1826.  Poe accumulated

vast gambling debts there and left because of it.  After the University

of Virginia, Poe went into the armed services starting with West Point.

He joined West Point in 183O and made well for himself.  The main reason

that he went into West Point was to make peace with his adoptive

parents, but to no avail.  He had himself purposefully expelled from

West Point when he learned that reconsiliations with his adoptive

parents was basically an impossibility.  The Allans pushed him out of

the family after the fiasco and made him live out in the street.

(           )


  Poe went to live with one of his poor aunts and married her daughter,

Virginia Clemm.  They were married on May 16, 1836, but she died only

eleven years later in 1847.  She died at the age of 25 from

turberculosis (which means that she was only fourteen when he married

her) which served only to intensify Poe's dark and moody feelings

towards everything. (         )



  Poe himself died on a Baltimore street walk on October 7th, 1849 due

to a brain lesion complication.  It was by this time that he was

starting to show signs of insanity.  His burial site is in the

Westminster Presbyterian Churchyard in Baltimore, Maryland.

(        ) 

CAREER OF POE

  Poe has served many jobs in his life, including novelist, critic,

short story writer, poet and has had a military career.



  His military career started before his enrollment at West Point with

his joining into the US Army under the psuedonym of Edgar A Perry in

1827.  He was promoted to Regimental Seargant Major in 1829 and was

discharged from duty in 1829.  He then went into West Point in 183O and

purposfully had himself expelled two years later due to complications

with his adoptive parents. (       )



  Poe's first literary career was when he bacame a staff member of

Southern Literary Messenger in Richmond, Virginia in 1835.  He was

promoted to Assistant Editor of the same paper in 1836.  He finally left

that job in 1837 and did not work for two years.  In 1839 he was the

Co-Editor of Burlington Gentleman's Magazine in Philedelphia until 184O.

Literary Editor of Grahm's Lady's and Gentleman's Magazine was his job

between the years of 1841 and 1842, truely facenating.  For one year he

was a Staff Member of Evening Mirror in New York City, New York in 1845.

His last real job was as Owner and Editor of the Broadway Journal

between the years of 1845 and 1846. (           )



  Even though he made many more pieces than this, he was only given

awards for two of his pieces.  They include a first prize in fiction for

Ms. Found in a Bottle in 1833 and another first prize in ficion for The

Gold Bug ten years later in 1843. (          )



  His other works include such beauties as Alone, Mesmeric Revelation,

William Wilson, The Oval Portrait, The Fall of the House of Usher, The

Sphinx, The Raven, The Bells, The Premature Burial, and The Masque of

the Red Death.  (          )



MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH


  The Masque of the Red Death is set in the later Middle Ages during the

Plague.  The location is somewhere in Eastern Europe inside of one

Prince Prospero's castle during a party.  The Prince has invited around

only one thousand of his closest friends to join him in an around the

clock party that is held in seven symbolic and differently colored

rooms.  The point of the party is to avoid the 'Red Death' that is

ravaging the countryside.  In the end, the walls of the castle turn out

to be no match for the power of the 'Red Death'.  The colors of the rooms

are used to symbolize the seven stages of life.



  The first room is colored blue to symbolize birth and innocence.  The

second room was bathed in purple which would just happen to symbolize

the earlier years of life.  Green was the color of the third room which

symbolized growth and the gathering of knowledge.  The fourth room was

encased in orange to symbolize the fall of life in to the middle ages.

Fifthly, the white room was to symbolize old age and wisedom.  The sixth

room in this procession was clad in violet to show the twilight just

before death.  Lastly, black was the identification color of the seventh

room which symbolized death and the end.



  A final piece of symbolizm would be the Ebony clock in the seventh

room.  This lovely work of craftsmanship clanged on the hour, but

whenever it did so the band that was playing the music would stop

playing the music and would force the dancers to do likewise.



  As if in some strange fit of ESP, none of the 'inmates' went into the

black room towards the end of the day.  It was if they knew that

eventually the 'Red Death' would take over no matter what, it was just

time that stood in the way.




  So it was, time was all that they had between them and the 'Red Death'

for when the clock struck midnight a stranger masked appeared.  What

made him different from the others was that he wasn't dressed in

fanciful clothing, but in rags soaked in blood.  The Prince, being the

complete dip that he was, was initially shocked by the appearance of

this strange guest and then angered.  He charged at the masked stranger

shouting and yelling and generally throwing a general hissy fit about

everything the stranger was.  The stranger stood there, until suddenly

he started taking measured steps towards the Prince.  This so scared the

Prince that he ran from all the way from the blue room straight to the

violet.  It was in the violet room that he drew out his daggar and

turned at the stranger.  He suddenly dropped the daggar and promptly

died in the typical plague ridden way.  After seeing the Prince fall at

the feet of the stranger, all of the partiers lunged at the Stranger and

each died one by one.



  The meaning, or moral if you will, of this story is that no matter

what you try to do, reality will allways find you.  So there.

(             )

CONCLUSION

  Poe wasn't really noticed for any of his works other than the two I

mentioned previously.  It took many years before anyone really really

awknowledged his works in any way shape or form.
