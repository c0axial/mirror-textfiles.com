                      The Million Dollar Question!
                         By Pip the Angry Youth


  Well, you may be asking me "What the hell is `The Million Dollar
  Question!?'"  Well, The Million Dollar Question! is this:

                 WHICH SODA IS BETTER, PEPSI OR COCA-COLA?

  I (out of sheer boredom) have decided that they are just as good, I
  don't mean that they are the same, but they rate about the same on my
  chart.  In this issue of THO, Pepsi and Coke take the Pip Challenge.



  PEPSI

  Pros
  1) Tastes good warm
  2) Carbonation isn't overpowering
  3) Doesn't try to fool you on the 'Serving Size'
  4) No fat (but wait for the CALORIES in the cons!)
  5) Has a 1-8OO line (I'll tell you it later)

  Cons
  1) 15O CALORIES!!!
  2) No protein
  3) More additives than Coke
  5) Plastic bottle is hard to get out of fridge.
  6) NOT MADE OF 1OO% RECYCLED MATERIALS (Bad Pepsi, BAD BAD!)
  8) Will rot your teeth faster than Coke


  COCA-COLA

  Pros
  1) Really great for belching.
  2) Lower Sugar
  3) 1-8OO line
  4) Plastic bottle is easy to take out of fridge.

  Cons
  1) Strong Carbonation
  2) Smaller serving size (makes it harder to judge what's actually in
     there)
  3) 15O CALORIES!!!
  4) No protein
  5) Asks you to recycle, but doesn't do it itself.


  Another thing that I have found is that Coke has an 8 oz serving size
  and Pepsi has a 12 oz serving size, so this makes it rather hard to
  see who is better, but lucky me, I happen to have a calculator handy.

  Well, you can clearly see that Coke and Pepsi are tied in every thing
  except for the big 'S', SALT!!!  Coke has 33% more salt in it than
  Pepsi.  Keep in mind tho, salt doesn't affect your blood pressure in
  any way unless you allready have a blood pressure problem.  So you
  people out there be weary.


  INGREDIENTS

  Well, the ingredients of Coke and Pepsi are pretty straight forward.
  None of that Twinkie BS there.  Every word in there is under 4
  syllables (sp?), the largest word there being CARBONATED.  Enough
  babbling, here are the ingredients.

  COKE

  CARBONATED WATER, HIGH FRUCTCOSE CORN SYRUP AND/OR SUCROSE, CARAMEL
  COLOR, PHOSPHORIC ACID, NATRUAL FLAVORS, CAFFEINE.


  PEPSI

  CARBONATED WATER, HIGH FRUCTCOSE CORN SYRUP AND/OR SUGAR, CARAMEL
  COLOR, PHOSPHORIC ACID, CAFFEINE, CITRIC ACID, NATRUAL FLAVORS.


  Well, Pepsi has an extra acid in there, so that's why it'll rot your
  teeth alot faster.  Coke tries to fool you with the word 'Sucrose' in
  its ingredients but I'm no fool.  Coke also tries to fool you about
  its sodium content, on the top of the bottle right above the nutrition
  information it says "VERY LOW SODIUM" yet it has 33% more salt in it
  than Pepsi <SNIFF SNIFF, do I smell bullshit?>.  None the less, I feel
  that Cranberry Juice wins the Pip challenge, 100% natural, no additives,
  and it doesn't spend anywhere near as much on advertizing.  One more
  observation, if Coke wants you to recycle so badly, how come it says
  "NO REFILL" on the bottle?  Jerks.
