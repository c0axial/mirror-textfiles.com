                            Modern Day Fables III
                                 by Thanatos


   This is a story about a guy named John. John was short and paralyzed,
and had this lid that lifted up on his lap. Everyone liked John. They were
always giving him yummy gifts.

   One day, a man put so much wrapping paper on the gift that he gave
John that John decided that he would give some of the gift that he received
back to the man with plenty of water to show his appreciation. But did
this man show his gratitude for John's gift? No! He stuck a big stick with
a rubber part on the end down John's throat!

   This hurt John both emotionally and physically. He decided that he would
get even. John started sucking very quickly, and swallowed the man's arm.
He kept slurping until there was nothing left of the man but the wrapping
paper that John had given back to him.


     MORAL:  If you're rude to people who give you gifts, all of your
             efforts will be washed down the drain.

     YOUR FORTUNE:  Don't look a gift toilet in the mouth.

     LEGEND:  Wrapping Paper = Toilet Paper
              John = Toilet
              Gifts = Pee-Pee and Poo-Poo
              Stick With Rubber = Bathroom Plunger

Duncan - Edit away; I don't know if the LEGEND should go there; you'd
         hafta be pretty stoopid not to get this (after the first few
         hints, that is). :)  -Mike
