Loud Lyrix, #9, 5/17/94
-----------------------

Here we are again people, back again, like always. Whew! What  a  wonderful
and horrible week it's been. The best part about  this  week  has  been  of
course the amazing win of the Toronto Maple Leafs  to  shut  down  the  San
Jose Sharks, after being down 3 games to 2, and to come back  and  take  it
all, what a feat! I went to see the last game at Skydome on the  JumboTron.
Most of you American's should know that building, the home of the two  time
World  Series  champion  Toronto  Blue  Jays!!  Anyways,  it's  now  on  to
Vancouver, it's gonna be a wicked series, not a  fucking  boring  one  like
the Sharks. Vancouver ain't a wimp team, and neither is the Leafs, so  this
is gonna be mighty interesting. (Hope SOME of  you  people  out  there  are
even remotely interested in hockey, it does RULE!)

It now looks like I'm gonna be seeing The Scorpions on June  25.  They  are
playing at the Kingswood Music Theatre in Canada's Wonderland. It's only  a
$12  show,  should  be  pretty  good.  I'm   still   going   to   see   the
Metallica/Suicidal/Danzig show, and the  Pantera/Sepultura/Biohazard  show.
Oh yeah, hehehehe... it looks like they are  gonna  be  showing  the  Final
Star Trek Episode at the Skydome! I got my tickets, and I  can't  wait  for
that.

Well, I guess that what's new this week, and I  had  to  write  a  friggin'
English essay comparing two  plays.  That  was  almost  the  end  of  me...
anyways, it's pretty lucky that I actually was able to get  this  issue  of
Loud Lyrix out... praise the Lord people!

Ok people, I think that more than a few you  are  probably  bored  to  hell
right now. I'll be done soon. There were six reader submissions this  week,
that's really good, thanks guys for the effort.... it  looks  like  we  are
gonna be getting hooked up with a listserv soon,  I  had  another  response
from a listserv in Colorado, and they wanted to see our  ad.  But  I  would
really rather get hooked up with the local one, but oh well, any  one  will
do.... I've added two more newsgroups to our list, rec.mag  and  alt.etext,
hopefully we won't be rejected by these guys, but who knows, I have get  to
really do some looking for appropriate newsgroups,  but  don't  despair,  I
will as soon as this shit called school calms down!

BTW This is for the guy that mailed "Fade To Black" to me,  I 
just wanna tell you that I checked the back  issues,  and  it 
seems that I printed that song in Issue #4, so I put in  "For 
Whom the Bells Tolls" instead, if you want ish #4, just  mail 
me ok?

Ok people, that's it, I've kept you long enough... here's the lyrix, and  a
little background info on a Norwegian band called  Darkthrone,  thanks  for
listening, l8r!

Chapter 6, "The Eye", by King Diamond

**********************  F A T H E R   P I C A R D  **************************


A new chaplain has arrived
Madeleine and a few other nuns
At the convent will meet him tonight

Father Picard:
"Welcome to My quarters, do come inside
Welcome dearest sisters, come into the light!"

"I'm Father Picard, I'm taking over
Things will be different here
You are the four GOD has chosen
To be his angels in white
Drink my sweet Holy Wine!!"

"Oh yeah come on it's not a crime
>From now on every Sunday this time
You will attend this communion of mine"

Father Picard is hiding something
A white powder for the wine

Father Picard:
"I'm Father Picard, I'm taking over
Things will be different here
You are the four GOD has chosen
To be his angels in white
Drink my sweet Holy Wine!!"

The nuns freak out, lust in their eyes
>From now on every Sunday this time
Father Picard's in control of their minds

Father Picard was hiding something
The white powder in the wine

Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On the fight, for they are right, yes, by who's to say?
For a hill men would kill, why? They do not know
Suffered wounds test there their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know
chorus:
          For whom the bell tolls
          Time marches on
          For whom the bell tolls

Take a look to the sky just before you die
It is the last time you will
Blackened roar massive roar fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now the will see what will be, blinded eyes to see

[sung to the tune of -- oh you know]

Come listen to a story 'bout a man named John
A poor ex-marine with a little fraction gone.
It seems one night after gettin' with the wife,
She lopped off his schlong with a swipe of a knife.
(Penis, that is.)
(Rodeoed, fillet-load)

Well, the next thing you know there's a ginsu by his side,
And Lorena's in the car takin' Willie for a ride.
She soon got tired of her purple-headed friend,
And tossed him out the window as she rounded a bend.
(Curve, that is.)
       (Pricker shrubs, wheel hubs)

       She went to the cops and confessed to the attack,
       And they called out the hounds just to get his weenie back.
       They sniffed and they barked, and they pointed "over there,"
       To John Wayne's Henry that was wavin' in the air.
       (Found, that is.)
       (By a fence; evidence)

       Now Peter and John couldn't stay apart too long,
       So a dick doctor said "Hey! I can fix your dong."
       "A needle and a thread are the things you're gonna need,"
       Then the world held its breath til they heard that Johnny peed.
       (Whizzed, that is.)
       (Stitched seam, straight seam)

       Well, he healed and he hardened and he took his case to court,
       With a cock-eyed lawyer since his assets came up short.
       They cleared her of assault and acquitted him of rape,
       And his pecker was the only one they didn't show on tape.
       (Video, that is.)
       (Unexposed, case closed.)

When the Sun has Died
When the Angels are Blind
When the Fog Lies Thick
Over the Palace of god

When the Full Moon Lights the Earth
When the Wolves Gather in the Open
When Blood rains from Heaven High
And from the pearly Gates

When Jehovas Hordes are Slaughtered 
When Disciples Twelve are Dead
When Beliefs of Easter Lands
Are Raped and Raped again

When the Whore of Babylon Rides 
When Pity turns to Hate
When All Sons of Satan 
Sodomize the Lambs of christ

When the Gates  have all been opened
When the Funerals Never End
When Satans Powers Paint our Hearts 
And Satisfies our Souls

When Witches Burn the Priests 
When the Ancient Ones Return
When the Demons Ride the Nuns
With their Horns of Dark Desire

[Here's a little background info on  Darkthrone  from  our  good  Norwegian
friend Hellcrusher, it's a bit long, but interesting anyways, hope ya  like
it. -- Editor]

  This band, Darkthrone, is the band who actually started this  Black-Metal
wave in Norway. It seems like when they appeared folks were  pretty  pissed
off with that Sweden/Florida  Death  Metal  sound.  O.K.  so  Entombed  and
Obituary were great bands, but everyone copied them,  so  the  whole  thing
became boring. I myself when I heard "A Blaze  In  the  Northern  Sky"  the
first time were quite shocked over this amazing music.  It  had  alot  more
intensity than ordinary Death Metal. It reminded me of the  old  days  with
Celtic Frost and Bathory(great swedes!!). Well about the  band.  Darkthrone
hasn't done alot of interviews like "The Count"  has.  That  seems  like  a
smart thing though...

  Darkthrone actually started out as a Death Metal band. They were known as
quite good around  here.  They  gave  out  the  album  "Soulside  Journey".
Darkthrone became a popular DM-band, but suddenly  they  did  a  change  in
their style. They started to use corpsepaint, and when Morbid Angel  wanted
them to warm up for them at a gig in Norway, Darkthrone told them to  "Fuck
off". This was due to a religious conflict. It then seemed weird to me, but
now I know better... 

  Morbid Angel were members of the Satanic Church in California, under  the
lead of Anton Szandor LaVey. All true(?) Norwegian satanists regards  LaVey
as a humanist. Darkthrone & Co in Norway meant that  only  TRUE  evil  were
satanic. I can in fact agree with that (even though I'm not  evil  either).
This Satanic Bible of LaVey seemed to me like some kind of right-wing info. 

  Anyway, Darkthrone has refused to go on a tour "until 50 per cent of  the
now touring bands stops". They have also said that they will only give  out
three albums. The albums are "A Blaze  in  the  Northern  Sky",  "Under  A
Funeral Moon" and "Transylvanian  Hunger".  They  also  regard  the  before
mentioned "Soulside Journey" as  a  "non-Darkthrone"  record.  During  this
"Burzum case" in Norway, Darkthrone has held a low profile. The only  thing
that was written about them, was about their drummer and songwriter Fenriz.
He was known as "the satan-poet who worked in the post". Darkthrone are  in
fact so shy that they for a long time didn't answer any requests from their
record-company, Peaceville!! How many bands can do such a  thing  to  their
record-company?? 

Well I think this is what I have about Darkthrone. The only thing we  await
from Darkthrone is their  third  and  last  album:  "Transylvanian  Hunger"
Drummer Fenriz  also  have  his  project  "Isengaard"  going.  It  will  be
interesting to see how thing turns out for him. -- Hellcrusher

Knowledge was gained, the tears were restrained
The time is coming for a whole new life
The change is made, I am afraid
I am afraid of this life that may be.
Everyday life is no longer simple
A walk through the park with a saddened whistle
The temperature outside is incredibly hot
I]'ve got to get inside before I cannot
The change is made, what have I done
What have I done to deserve this torment.
Some days the legs do not stand, others
no sight or use of hands.
The question I often ponder, did I bring this on myself?
The change is made, what do I do
What do I do to endure this condemnation.
Still able to play bass and not knowing why
Waiting to know who is worthy to know who to glorify
Getting reborn through Jesus into my life
Making me realize just why I am alive.
God holds the key that will set me free
Spreading the Word through music is for me
Controls all maintaining the truth always beside me
 with every move.
The change is made, I'm no longer afraid
I'm no longer afraid of this life that may be.

I think it's totally cool to have a place to post great metal lyrix.  I  am
sorry to say that sometimes metal  lyrix  are  a  total  disgrace,  on  the
kindergarten level, specially with glam bands... OK, here is an  absolutely
totally cool Sabbath song from 1969 -- Shimon Godes

Now the first day that I met ya
I was looking in the sky
When the sun turned all a blur
and the thunderclouds rolled by
The sea began to shiver
and the wind began to moan
It must've been a sign for me
to leave you well alone
I was born without you, baby
but my feelings were a little bit too strong

you never said you love me
and I don't believe you can
'cause I saw you in a dream
and you were with another man
You looked so cool and casual
and I tried to look the same
But now I've got to know ya
tell me who am I to blame?
I was born without you, baby
but my feelings were a little bit too strong

Now the whole wide world is movin'
'cause there's iron in my heart
I just can't keep from cryin'
'cause you say we've got to part
Sorrow grips my voice as I stand here all alone
And watch you slowly take away
a love I've never known
I was born without you, baby
but my feelings were a little bit too strong

In the time of chimpanzees I was a monkey/ Butane in my veins, and I'm out to
cut the junkie/ With the plastic eyeballs/ Spraypaint the vegetables/ Dog
food skulls/ With the beefcake pantyhose/  Kill the headlights and put it in
neutral/ Stock car flamin with the loser on the cruise control/ Baby's in
Reno with the vitamin T/ Got a couple of couches/ Sleep on the love seat/
Someone keeps sayin' I'm insane to complain about a shotgun wedding and a
stain on my shirt/ Don't believe every thing that you breathe/ You'll get a
parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve/ So shave your face with some
mace in the dark/ Savin' all your food stamps/ We're burnin' down the trailer
park/ Yo...... cut it

Soy un perdedor/I'm a loser baby/ So why don't you kill me

......doublebarrelled buckshot........

Soy un perdedor/I'm a loser baby/ So why don't you kill me

Forces of evil/ in a bozo nightmare/ Bent all the music with a phony gas
chamber/ Cuz one's got a weazel and the other's got a flag/ One's on the pole
shove the other in a bag/ With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose job/ The
daytime crap of the folksinger slob/ He hung himself with a guitar string/ A
slab of turkey neck and it's hangin' from a pigeon wing/ Ya can't write if
you can't relate/ Trade the cash for the beef for the body for the hate/ And
my time is a piece of wax/ Fallin' on a termite/ It's chokin' on the
splinters

soy un perdedor/ I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me

Get crazy with the cheese whiz...

Soy un perdedor/I'm a loser baby/ So why don't you kill me

driveby body pierce<?>....yo, bring it on down....i'm a driver, i'm the

things are gonna change, i can feel it...

You won't hear me, But you'll feel me
Without warning, something's dawning, listen.
Then within your senses, You'll know your defenseless
How your heart beats, when you run for cover
Your cant retreat I spy like no other.

Then we race together.  We can ride forever
Wrapped in horsepower, driving into fury
Changing gear I pull you tighter to me

I'm your turbo lover.  Tell me there's no other.
I'm your turbo lover.  Better run for cover

We hold each other closer, as we shift to overdrive
And everything goes rushing by, with every nerve alive
We move so fast it seems as though we've taken to the sky
Love machines in harmony, we hear the engines cry.

On and on we're charging to the place so many seek
In perfect synchronicity of which so many speak
We feel so close to heaven in this roaring heavy load
and then in sheer abandonment, we shatter and explode.

The dual substance of Christ
The yearning so human
Of Man to attain God
Has always been a deep
Inscrutable mystery to me
My principle anguish and source
Of all my joys and sorrows

Religious domain is all I see
Suffocate the scum with mediocrity
Lying and changing your fate
Anno domini ends -- misery

>From my youth onward
Has been the incessant
Merciless battle between
The spirit and the flesh
And my soul is the arena
Where these two armies
Have clashed and met

Holy wars unleashing bloody raids
The sacred earth without a face
Consumed by murderous sinners
Psychotic leader
Insane -- insane -- insane -- insane!

Living in a dying age
Persecute the human race
Triumph of death in the wasteland
Blood signs your epitaph

Religious domain is all I see
Suffocate the scum with mediocrity
Lying and changing your fate
Anno domini ends -- misery
