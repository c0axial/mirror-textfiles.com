Loud Lyrix, #11, 5/31/94
------------------------

Well people, you know what they say.... all good things  must  come  to  an
end, right? .. Well, it looks like Loud Lyrix will be going on  hiatus  for
a little while, this will be the last Loud Lyrix sent from this  site,  the
sysadmin was a little bit pissed at the last issue  'cause  it  was  sooooo
huge, so he decided to pull the plug, but I knew it was coming, so I'm  not
mad at all... anyways... you HAVE to admit it was worth  it!!  Didn't  that
fucking issue #10 just fucking blow you guys away?!! I loved doin' it,  and
I hope more than a few of you enjoyed it too...

So anyways... this will be the last issue of  Loud  Lyrix  sent  from  this
address, so that means that next week there may not be an issue,  so  don't
be surprised, I have to get  things  straightened  out  with  the  LISTSERV
owner over here, and get me a spot on it,  and  then  LOUD  LYRIX  WILL  BE
BACK...... with a vengeance!! Anyways,  if  I  do  miss  next  week,  don't
despair 'cause I WILL make it up to youse!

Oh yes people!!! It's this Saturday!!!!!!  METALLICA/DANZIG/SUICIDAL  ..  I
just can't wait!! This weekend is gonna fucking ROCK!! ... check this  out,
Friday night is my friend's birthday party, we're  getting  a  nice  Howard
Johnson Hotel room for him, and we're  gonna  party  all  night,  it'll  be
soooo amazing, just imagine, 20 people  in  one  room....  hehehe...  we're
gonna get ripped, and at like 3am when everyone leaves,  we're  gonna  jump
into the van, and wheel it up to Molson Park, and sleep in there  'til  the
morning... and then we'll be the first in line for the Gen. Adm. concert!!!
Then at 2pm, the gates open... and it's MOSHING TIME!!!!! yeah,  I'm  gonna
be surfin' the WHOLE damn concert! Then I get back, and fucking just  crash
at home 'cause I'll be soooo dead tired. Then next day at 12:30pm  I  gotta
work, and then on Monday at 11:35am I have my Driving  License  Exam  (take
number two!).. hopefully I'll  pass...............  FUCKING  HOLY  SHIT!!!!
What a weekend!

Ok dudes.. so here it is, just a quick little  Loud  Lyrix  'cause  I'm  in
kinda a rush... hopefully we'll have the LISTSERV by  next  week,  if  not,
don't despair... I'LL BE BACK!!

BTW... I had a request from JEWELS <JKS0748@ritvax.isc.rit.edu> to  include
the  lyrics  for  "Fucking  Hostile"  by  Pantera  in  this  week's  issue,
unfortunately that song was already printed up in issue #4, so  I  included
"No Good (Attack the Radical)" from the same  album  instead,  I  hope  you
don't mind Jewels!

Sacrifice, holy rites, secrecy and altar wine
Black candles burning low, to the meetings again they go
Picard can't wait to take away another soul
Oh it's a shame, Picard was so insane

In the year of 1642, it came to an end
In 1642, imprisonment

Sacrifice, holy rites, secrecy and altar wine
Black death come this way, Father Picard will soon be going
He's ill, so sick, now his meetings are forever over
Oh it's a shame, they went along with his game

In the year of 1642, it came to an end
In 1642, imprisonment

Sacrifice, holy rites, secrecy and altar wine
The nuns can't take the blame
One after one they suffer a breakdown
Confession, confession, they confess to diabolic possession
Oh it's a shame, even Madeleine has gone insane

In the year of 1642, Madeleine was leaving hell
In 1642 she found freedom in her prison cell

                     Album: "Vulgar Display of Power"       


In the States there's a problem with race.
Because of ignorant past burned fires.
>From evolution we've been killing each other.
I figure man should have it down to a science.

No chance, not for a minute, not for a second I won't be defensive.
I'm straight out in my opinion.
You'd better listen to a man who knows what he is saying.
I've seen your side.
You run and hide for the mere fact that you feel inferior.
Be superior, and know your interior.

Pre:
Race, pride, prejudice
Blackman, whiteman, no stand
Live in the past, we make it last, a hated mass.
No solution, mind pollution, for revolution.

Chorus:
So low behold my eyes, this land of fools will rise.
No good, for no one.

You blame oppression and play the role of criminals.
To rape and burn show progress is minimal.
White hoods and militants you know it's such a pity.
Living, breathing, violence in your city.

If one man had one home in one world.
He'd live alone without variety.
Full of anxiety, no one to point at, question, or even talk to.
In his private grave, no matter what color, he wouldn't be saved from hell
He dwells, a closed mind playing the part of prison cells

(Pre)
(Chorus)

When you wake up in the night
And you stare into the dark
Your eyes will scream for sight
Evil left its mark
 
You'll be looking all above
Looking all around
But if you want to see them
You have to look down
 
Tortured by thoughts
Stricken with fear
Blasted to hell
The end is near
 
As you wait upon your fate
Your throat is full of pain
And when you try to scream
You know it's all in vain
 
Nothing you can change
Destiny is complete
Silence seems so strange
As you start to feel the heat
 
Forever to burn
Infinite pain
Demons of darkness
Warriors domain
 
You think you're so secure
Protected from above
Gaze into the hell fire
I know you'll fall in love

They'll hunt you down at night
Your flesh is what they want
Your eyes will scream for sight
When evil comes to haunt

Cursed by nightmares
When you sleep
They'll cut your throat
And blood will seep

Fighting through the mist
Forever trapped in hell
Crushed with satan's fist
You can't escape his spell
 
Sanity will pass
Reality is just a word
Evil does its task
With its mighty sword
 
Open your eyes and die
By the hand of mass
Escape and you'll defy
My long awaited grasp
 
They want to steal your soul
Death will steal away
Your wrongs will take their toll
Below the crust you'll lay
 
Spell has cast no hope
Forgotten thoughts of good
Your neck awaits a rope
And things go like they should
 
Enslaved in forever torment
Blood drips from your eyes
There is no way to repent
>From your wicked lies
 
Blades of metal
Cut off your head
Served as a meal
Satan is fed
 
Masters of evil
Blasters of hell
No one can stop them
We're under their spell
 
Red eyes are glowing
With you in sight
And if your knowing
Scream out in fright

Powerlines...steel webs confine, violating the brownish sky.
Hard grey smothers, earth, like cancer. Cracks revealing, ground below
                                                  broken and bleeding
                                                  every seed every stone.
I've heard the promise, I feel hunger, I realize. As time creeps over me
                                                  and days are torn away.
There are no answers only bitter lies, the only voice I'm believing
                                     is the
                                                      beckoning blade.

I know the feeling the loss of control
                   voice of reason slips away
                                   eyes staring back at me
                                      so dark so cold
                   reflecting all the remains.

I know the enslaver
I taste its poison...felt its sting deep inside.
It has no answer, only bitter lies but its voice I'm hearing,
                                                      keeps calling my name.
Who can tell the torture of the soul?
Is it wrong... tell me is it wrong... to close your eyes...to sleep forever?

Upon a cross a nun will be hanged, she will be raped by an evil man
Knock spikes through her hands, things will come she won't understand
You're a nun you haven't had no fun, living your life as a virgin queen
I'm gonna change it and I'll get it done, tomorrow you won't be a virgin queen
C.U.N.T. that's what you are, you're C.U.N.T. yeah
I get it up, I get it up in the dark, I make her feel I'm not a holy man
Faster breathing, she's like a shark, she wants more
I'm gonna give her my cross
Nuns have have no fun, they just have their fathers and sons
But I'll give them hell, I never fail
I get it up, I get it up in the dark, I make her feel I'm not a holy man
Faster breathing, she's like a shark, she wants more
I'm gonna give her my cross
C.U.N.T. that's what you are, you're C.U.N.T. yeah.

    Enlighten your sense of thought, of touch, of real, a shield,
    An underground for this coward.
    Building a blood in water scent. It's like some raping,
    without judgement. Boy in a pocket, balls in a bag,          
    Serve and protect you. His dick his gun, his brain his badge.


    A faster way to kill them all would take too goddamn long.
    Absorb through pores the great escape. Kill that fuck to show him up,
    equal his displeasure now. Stab his ass a reminded past of
    What the fuck we live for.
                              Ourselves.
    
    Arm yourself. A branch. A third arm. Extend your health,
    Crawl inside euphoria. Building a blood in water scent. It's like
    a scraping, it's entrapment. Boy in a pocket, balls in a bag,
    Perverted handle. His getting by is a fisted fuck.

    A faster way to exterminate them takes too fucking long. 
    Absorb through pores he great escape.
    Kill that fuck to show him up, equal his displeasure now,
    Stab his ass, a reminded past of what the fuck we live for.
                              Ourselves.

    Half assed for most his life. Piss poor little ham. NARC-BOY
    a fake fuck limp dick, sucking up to the man.
    And the world. We need a fucking cold war.

Thunder and lightning the gods take revenge
Senseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing

   On through the mist and the madness
   We are trying to get the message to you
   Metal Militia
   Metal Militia
   Metal Militia

Chained and shadowed to be left behind
nine and one thousand
Metal militia for your sacrifice
iron clad soldiers
Join or be conquered the law of the land
What will befall you
The metalization of your inner soul
twisting and turning

   On through the mist and the madness
   We are trying to get the message to you
   Metal Militia
   Metal Militia
   Metal Militia

We are as one as we all are the same
fighting for one cause
Leather and metal are our uniforms
protecting what we are
Joining together to take on the world
with our heavy metal
Spreading the message to everyone here
Come let yourself go

   On through the mist and the madness
   We are trying to get the message to you
   Metal Militia
   Metal Militia
   Metal Militia

Everybody you don't have to choose it
You don't have to prove it
It's only rock 'n' roll
Mama don' told me
Papa don' scold me
Superstition, black cat in the cradle
Dancing on the table
Don't you snake on me
Mama don' told me
Daddy don' scold me, told me, show me
You know that he told me

[CHORUS:]
Come hell or HIGH WATER
Come hell or HIGH WATER
Come hell or HIGH WATER
Come hell or HIGH WATER

Blood money, lyin' through your back teeth
Fightin' on the main street
Breathe your last breath on me
Mama don' told me
Poor boy get home
Hot lovin' trigger-happy feelin'
Touchin' up and teasin'
You know it so bad
Mama don' told me
Papa don' scold me, rock 'n' rolled me

[REPEAT CHORUS (twice)]

Come hell, come hell, come hell

It's a long time, a long time comin'
You tell me how you think i should be
It's so easy
You tell me what people want from me
Well i'll just be myself
It's the only way i can be but you don't see
You accuse, abuse integrity
You don't know one damn thing about me
Not one damn thing
Build me up and then you tear me down
Curse my name when i'm not around
And it's a
Long time, long time
A long time comin'
A long time, long time
A long time comin', a vicious circle
In your face i'll come runnin'
Try and stop me
A long time, much too long
And i'm comin'
Try and stop me
I like to keep my friends around me close
But my enemies closer
Friends accept me for just who i am
Not someone i'm supposed to be
Or something they expect for free
Do you know me?
I live with myself, i know my place
Wipe that bullshit smile off your face
The show is over
Build me up and then you tear me down
Curse my name when i'm not around
And it's a
Long time, long time
A long time comin'
A long time, long time
A long time comin', a vicious circle
In your face i'll come runnin'
Try and stop me
A long time, much too long
And i'm comin'
Try and stop me
You and me are gonna take a walk
I think it's time we had a little talk
I said, you and me are gonna take a walk
And we're gonna do more than walk and talk
Let me see how you think i should be
You think it's so easy?
Put yourself on trial everyday
Against a hung jury
You don't know a thing about me
You believe the hype you see
But in my heart god knows i'll be true
To what my life will bring
And it's a
Long time, long time
A long time comin'
A long time, long time
A long time comin', a vicious circle
In your face i'll come runnin'
Try and stop me
A long time, much too long
And i'm comin'
Try and stop me
