Loud Lyrix, #15, 7/12/94
------------------------

Hey dudes!! How's it goin'? Good? I hope so...  everything's  pretty  great
for me over here.. Italy's kicking ass in the World Cup,  and  I'm  fucking
happy, St. Clair (the street where ALL the Italians in Toronto hang out) is
just rocking right now, it's really Sat the 9th when I'm writing this, so I
might be eating my words if they lose the next round,  but  I  doubt  that!
Fortza Azzuri!!!!!!! I know all  you  Brazilian  subscribers  are  probably
gonna flame my ass to the wall (There are at least 10 of you for sure), but
that's ok.. hehehehehehe.. Italy'll kick your ass!

Anyways... back to the 'zine... this week's 'zine is a pretty  average  and
ordinary issue... I've had time to do it this week so it's  not  as  rushed
as it's been in the past couple of installments... sorry  about  all  that,
but this summer ain't turning out to be as relaxing as I thought it  would!
hehehehe... but still, I'm having fun, and that's the main thing! Ok  guys,
this week, the last SIX songs are reader  submissions!  That's  GREAT,  I'm
glad so many of you decided to contribute to  the  'zine  this  week,  it's
greatly appreciated... 

Ok people, a word about lateness, as I'm writing this editorial right  now,
I know for a fact that Loud Lyrix #14 hasn't been mailed outta  my  site!!!
FUCK!! You don't know how much that pisses me off!! I  swear,  this  site's
mailer is getting on my nerves!! It's not the listserv that's screwing  up,
not in the least.. it's the BBS that I call to do my email, and from  where
I have to send ONE message to the listserv to explode it to all the subbers
That BBS is fucking up, and can't connect to the University so it  can  get
on the actual  Internet..  understand??  Anyways..  that  means  late  Loud
Lyrix's for all you guys.. I'm REALLY  sorry  about  it  people,  but  shit
happens, you'll have to bare  with  it  for  now,  but  hopefully  I'll  be
mailing this issue from a new site, ginof@tvo.org, HOPEFULLY!!

Ok guys, there is one thing that I've been waiting to have in an  issue  of
Loud Lyrix, and that is a 'Reader's Survey' !!! Kewl idea eh?? Well, as  it
seems that I have some time on my hands (the next coupla hours), I am gonna
try and write it up to include in this issue... make  sure  you  answer  it
truthfully, and send it back, completed to lyrix@terranet.cts.com,  I  will
give you all **5**, count 'em, FIVE weeks to  get  all  your  surveys  into
me.... at that point I'm gonna add 'em all up, and post the results. Anyone
who does NOT send in a completed survey will  be  DELETED  AND  BLACKLISTED
FROM THIS 'ZINE, unless you provide a valid doctor's note! :)

Oh yeah, I just got word that Biohazard is gonna be coming  to  Toronto  on
Aug 3... I MIGHT go to the show, but I'm not too sure, it all depends if  I
like any opening acts, and if 'the price is right'. Who  knows?  But  it'll
be one helluva mosh!

BTW, it came to my attention that someone uploaded issue #8 of  Loud  Lyrix
to the Etext archives at  U  of  Michigan....  I  freaked  when  I  saw  it
there... I really wanna know who it was, so  whoever  you  are,  could  you
please mail me, and lemme say thank you  to  you,  and  give  you  ALL  the
issues so you can upload 'em all...

Ok guys, it's time for some WICKED songs.. so here they are, enjoy....

                               Album: "Them"


On the following friday as I turned out
the light
 Grandma' came and knocked at My
door
"Wake up King, wake up My dear
I am gonna show You about the house
of Amon"

It is time for tea, it is time again

"Even Your mother is present
We made her sleep in My rocking
chair"
At first I felt really scared but there
was no reason to
As I saw the knife sneaking out from
Grandmother's dress
Then it cut a tiny wound in My
mother's little hand

It is time for tea, it is time again

Blood was running into the tea pot,
then I heard "THEM" laugh
"A bit of this in a cup of tea, is what it
takes to set "THEM" free
You will hear "THEM" telling stories
from far beyond this earth"
What I saw and what I heard made me
want to stay and learn

I really hope this dream will never
end, it's hard to describe the kind of
feeling that went on in My mind
A paradise

Hearing "THEIR" stories and feeling
"THEIR" warmth
We laughed with tears in our eyes
>From the first cup of tea, to the last
drop of blood
Nothing seemed to matter at all
anymore
My Mother? She didn't exist to me,
Oh I felt so heavenly

It is time for tea, it is time again

Well, my name it is a number
It's on a piece of plastic film
And I've been growin' funny flowers
Outside on my little window sill

And don't you know I'm a 2,000 man
And my kids, they just don't understand me at all

You know, my wife still respects me
Even though I really misuse her
I am having an affair
With the Random computer

But don't you know I'm a 2,000 man
And my kids, they just don't understand me at all

Oh daddy, proud of your planet
Oh mommy, proud of your sun
Oh daddy, proud of your planet
Oh mommy. proud of your sun
Oh daddy, your brain's still flashin'
Like they did when you were young
Or did they come down crashin'
Seeing all the things you'd done
Spacin' out and havin' fun

Oh daddy, proud of your planet
Oh mommy. proud of your sun
Oh daddy, proud of your planet
Oh mommy. proud of your sun

Oh daddy, your brain's still flashin'
Like they did when you were young
Or did they come down crashin'
Seeing all the things you'd done
Spacin' out and havin' fun

But, don't you know I'm a 2,000 man
And my kids, they just don't understand me at all
But don't you know I'm a 2,000 man
And my kids, they just don't understand me at all
Understand me, u-understand me, u-understand me, now understand me
But don't you know I'm a 2,000 man
And my kids, they just don't understand me at all
But don't you know I'm a 2,000 man
And my kids, they just don't understand me at all
I'm a 2,000 man, I'm a 2,000 man
I'm a 2,000 man, I'm a 2,000 man, yeah, 2,000

                         Album: "Among The Living"


Disease! Disease! Spreading the disease.
With some help from Captain Trips, he'll bring the world down to his knees.
Power, yes Power! He'll show them all his power.
It pulses through his ice cold blood, a whole world to devour!

*Bridge*
  He's seeing, he's calling, his legacy he's spawning.
  He's coming, corrupting, among the living!

Murder! Murder! Commit cold blooded murder!
Like Nazis during World War Two, they only follow orders.
Hatred! Hatred! A crucifix is your bed,
Once he turns his eye on you, you'll be better off dead!

*Chorus*:
    I'm the walkin' dude, I can see all the world!
    Twist your minds with fear, I'm the man with the power.
    Among the living, follow me or die!

Man, fights Man! Divided they can't stand!
United, they can battle back, and make him force his hand!
Fear, yes fear! His end is growing near,
He didn't count on Man's good faith, and their will to persevere.

*Bridge*
*Chorus*

FIRE! HOT FIRE!! Purge the world with fire!!
Damnation is the price he'll pay, for an evil man's desire!
Good, versus Evil! The stand to vanquish evil!
Man can only live one way, that place right in the middle.

*Chorus*

  Among Among Among Among Among Among Among Among Among Among Among Among!

One day in the life of the lonely
Another day on the round about
What do they need
Somebody to love

One night in the life of the lonely
There's a miracle on the screen
What did they see
Somebody to love

He guarantees you instant glory
Get your money on the line

Gotta send me a plastic Jesus
There's a check in the mail today
That's what I need
Somebody to love

We just won't eat on Sunday
Gotta buy him a limousine
Somewhere to live
Somewhere to pray

Every penny from the people
Keeps the wolf outside the door
Shop around and find forgiveness for yourself
But he'll give you more, yeah

Chorus:
Holy father, holy ghost
Who's the one who pays the most
Rock the cradle don't you cry
Buy another lullaby

Jack is nimble, Jack is quick
Pick your pocket, turn a trick
Slow and steady, he's got time
To commit another TV crime
TV crime

One day in the life of the lonely
Back again on the round about
What do they need
Somebody to love

Yeah

One night in the life of the lonely
Another miracle on the screen
What did they see
Somebody to love again

A supermarket of salvation
Take a look inside the store
Shop around and find forgiveness for yourself
But he gives more

Holy father - holy ghost
Who's the one who hurts you most
Rock the cradle when you cry
Scream another lullaby

Jack be nimble, Jack be slick
Take the money, get out quick
Slow and steady, so much time
To commit another
TV Crime, TV Crime

Mr. Crowley, what went on in your head
Mr. Crowley, did you talk with the dead
Your life style to me seemed so tragic
With the thrill of it all
You fooled all the people with magic
You waited on Satan's call
Mr. Charming, did you think you were pure
Mr. Alarming, in nocturnal rapport
Uncovering things that were sacred manifest on this Earth
Conceived in the eye of a secret
And they scattered the afterbirth
(solo)
Mr. Crowley, won't you ride my white horse
Mr. Crowley, it's symbolic of course
Approaching a time that is classic
I hear maidens call
Approaching a time that is drastic
Standing with their backs to the wall
Was it polemically sent
l wanna know what you meant
I wanna know
I wanna know what you meant

Hail! Just submitting this nice piece of lyrics, from Macabre's self-titled
album... Lots of fun, I like showing lyrics like this to  stupid-asses  who
think Cannibal Corpse  or  Deicide  lyrics  are  amusing...  Well,  I  have
complete lyrics to the whole album, and they  are  all  as  funny  as  this
song... P.S. Perhaps you don't care, but I was quite pissed with  last  #13
of Loud Lyrix... It was over 50kb, and sent in  a  single  message...  Holy
shit, my 2400 modem fucked up with NO CARRIER 6  times  before  I  got  it!
Can't you send lyrix, comments and  concert  info/ravings/etc  in  separate
messages? -- Gregory

[Sorry about that dude, but I can't  send  this  mag  in  sections,  sorry,
however, if you see a huge Loud Lyrix in your mailbox,  simply  delete  it,
and ask me to send it to you in pieces, I'll be glad to PERSONALLY mail  it

In a far away town, many years ago
There lived a man who caused much woe
He'd murder young men and slice up the meat
And sell it to hungry town people to eat

Chorus
       Fritz Haarmann - He chopped up young men
       The Butcher - Made steaks out of them
       Fritz Haarmann - He sold them as meat
       The Butcher - For the people to eat

Young men were missing, nowhere in sight
But they ate their steak with hungry delight
They'd go to Fritz Haarmann to get more meat
But they didn't know young men they'd eat

Chorus
       Fritz Haarmann - made young men into meat
       The Butcher - sold them on the street
       Fritz Haarmann - he'd sell them as steaks
       The Butcher - for the profit he'd make

Here's a little contribution to the 'zine, two of my favourite  heavy-metal
songs. And about the violence of the brasilian cops, it's  really  hard  to
beat, specially here, on the Rio Grande do Sul  (Brasil's  extreme  south),
where the police force which is  responsible  for  the  "security"  of  the
streets is called, literally, "Military  Brigade"  (Brigada  Militar)  and,
because of its military status, is  submitted  only  to  the  rule  of  the
State's Governor, not for the civillian society. The 'Brigada  Militar'  is
guilty of lots of homicides of no farms' agricultural people and  political
dissidents of the old military regime in Brasil  (1964-85),  hiding  their
bodies and declaring them "missing" people. -- Iuri

[Thanks for the info on Brazil and for the songs Iuri, they  are  also  two
of my fave's as well, fight the  power  dudes,  teach  the  cops  who's  in
charge!...... THE HEADBANGERS OF THE WORLD!!! -- Editor]

Cascaded darkness
Walls close in on me.
Nailed shut but my eyes still see.
Severe anguish as my body evolves.
The pain of life after death it resolves.

Emptiness in twilight's rebirth,
The faint sounds of shoveled earth.
Madness growing as your mind dissolves.
Merely secret in my dreams.

Night grows cold, twilight's near,
On the edge of madness the wounds are sheared.
Forms of hanging, flesh shredded carcass
No spared breath.
Imprisoned in a shell, ready to explode,
Dead soul,
Stone cold,
Out into the night.

Voices inside my head
Hold me under.
Voices oppress.
Like roaring thunder.
An echo bouncing inside my brain.
How much can I take of the pain,
The pain!

A war raging deep inside my head,
A split decision that will end with me dead.

You see the agony in my eyes,
Protruding aimless,
I think it's time to die.

A cannibals desire feeds the fire
that burns in your head.

Intense pain eats away at your brain,
Thorazine pumping through your veins.

Death walks inside of you,
Smell death around you,
Hell's evil spell takes a soul,
Hear the sound of the bell
Counting off death tolls.

Laughing as you eternally rot,
Searching for human flesh
And life's blood.

Live Undead.

Bodies fill the fields I see, hungry heroes end
No one to play soldier now, no one to pretend
running blind through killing fields, bred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be
a servant `til I fall

[Chorus:]
   Soldier boy, made of clay
   now an empty shell
   twenty one, only son
   but he served us well
   Bred to kill, not to care
   just do as we say
   finished here, Greeting Death
   he's yours to take away

   Back to the front
   you will do what I say, when I say
   Back to the front
   you will die when I say, you must die
   Back to the front
                 you coward
                 you servant
                 you blindman
[End Chorus]

Barking of machinegun fire, does nothing to me now
sounding of the clock that ticks, get used to it somehow
More a man, more stripes you bare, glory seeker trends
bodies fill the fields I see
the slaughter never ends

[Chorus]

Why, Am I dying?
Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lying
Hell, Hell is here

I was born for dying

Life planned out before my birth, nothing could I say
had no chance to see myself, moulded day by day
Looking back I realize, nothing have I done
left to die with only friend
Alone I clench my gun

[Chorus]

Back to the front.

Oh the devil is rising with the moon he cries and my blood runs cold.
Oh no never was the darkness so black,no light and nowhere to go.

My spirit is crying for a love so tired of being alone.
I remember he came here to steal and your are his stealer of souls.

I see a Black Moon rising,and it4s calling out my name
Oh it's calling my name.

I've been blinded,lost and confused,darkness will call me no more.
Heaven is no friend of mine,no god ever knocked on my door.

I see a Black Moon rising,and it's calling out my name
It4s calling out my name,it's calling.

I see a Black Moon rising,and it's calling out my name
Oh it's calling my name.

I'm standing on the dark side of time reaching for the power of her hand.
She's weaving an unholy light and calls from Lucifers land.

I see a Black Moon rising,and it's calling out my name
An Angel of hell is rising,heaven's no friend of mine.

I see a Black Moon rising,and it's calling out my name
I see a Black Moon rising,and it causes so much pain.

An Angel of hell is rising,heaven's no friend of mine.
I see a Black Moon rising,and it's calling out my name.

It's calling my name,this spirits crying for love.
Heaven's no friend of mine.

As I wandered, walked along on a lazy path
I shook a hand, he seemed to know so much more
So I listened, tried my best just to understand
Then I followed to where I knew nothing of

Over the hill, come see the thrill awaiting you
There's so much more, go through the door

Walk in the big parade, learn just what to say
They will all try to fool you
Don't believe anything, I'm your everything
They will all try to fool you
And don't ever think you'll see another friend
See another friend

As time went on, we were friends of a different kind
But something there always tearing apart
Standing tall on a surface of glass and rain
We travelled on with a hope and a prayer

Over the hill, come see the thrill awaiting you
There's so much more, go through the door

Walk in the big parade, learn just what to say
They will all try to fool you
Don't believe anything, I'm your everything
They will all try to fool you
And don't ever think you'll see find a better friend

Walk in the big parade, learn just what to say
They will all try to fool you
Don't believe anything, I'm your everything
They will all try to fool you
Walk in the big parade, learn just what to say
They will all try to fool you
Don't believe anything, I'm your everything
They will all try to fool you
And don't ever think that I can do you wrong

He's the king of sting, Mr. Morphine my friend
Uncle Slam, medicine man
And I'm a junkie with a big King Kong sized monkey
Crawling up and down my back

Oh, I'll help ya son to rearrange your mind
Oh, I'll help ya son but ya gotta buy this time
I'm your doctor

Help me please, oh doctor, help me please
Doctor Rocktor, you know I need you
Doctor please, my M.D., fix me in my time of need
But can you see the fire that's in my eyes

It's the mirror from the wall that's on the table
Feeding me little white lies
And I'm wasted in a waste land, I'm a junk man
I got tombstones in my eyes

Oh, I'll help ya son to rearrange your mind
Oh, I'll help ya son but ya gotta buy this time
I'm your doctor

Help me please, oh doctor, help me please
Doctor Rocktor, you know I need you
Doctor please, my M.D., fix me in my time of need
But can you see the fire that's in my eyes

Ah, help me Uncle Slam, the beast claims another man
Cocaine, codine, 714, a tuinol blindfold just what I need
Help me, help me, help me

Help me please, oh doctor, help me please
Doctor Rocktor, you know I need you
Doctor please, my M.D., fix me in my time of need
But can you see the fire that's in my eyes
