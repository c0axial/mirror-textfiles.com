Loud Lyrix, #16, 7/19/94
------------------------

Hey all you 'bangers out there in 'bangerland..  what's  up!!   hehehehe...
what a cheesy greeting... but anyways... I'm back with issue #16, a normal,
no frills attached, RAW edition of Loud Lyrix, just a little  blabber  from
me, and then into the lyrics... anyways... you lazy asses are  pretty  damn
lazy you know that?! Fuck guys, c'mon!  I  had  ZERO,  count  'em...  **0**
submissions this week, you think that just  'cause  of  the  survey  that's
exempting you from submitting?? Well no siree Bob! Snap to it, or  pay  the
price, you will feel the wrath of your almighty  Editor!  :)  Ok,  anyways,
that means that all of this week's songs are "Editorz Choice"  so,  if  you
have any complaints.... TOO BAD... send in some shit,  or  request  it,  or
else get used to my tastes.... 

BTW.. I actually got something from someone.... WOW!  I  am  amazed..  it's
from Shimon Godes, a review of a Babes In  Toyland  concert  he  was  at...
hope you guys like it, I know I wish I was there!!! ;)

Ok people.. just a little word about the listserv.... we've been  having  a
couple of problems with it, and because of that, you guys got a spaced  out
issue #14, and fortunately, an OK issue #15.... hopefully, by the time  you
get this issue, I will have already remailed issue #14 to you all...  sorry
about that... anyways... I'm also in the process of setting up  an  'INDEX'
diskspace for Loud Lyrix on planet.org's listserv.... I'm gonna be  storing
all the back issues, the AD, the FAQ, and the PGP keys here... I will  also
be mailing you all instructions on how to retrieve these files if you  want
'em... So hopefully that'll be a little better for all  of  you...  another
thing is late issues... sometimes, the mailer at the site that I access the
Internet from goes down, and that means that when I mail  the  listserv  to
send out the latest issue, that mailing doesn't get there until the  system
is back up, so it can't mail the issue out to all of  you...  unfortunately
this can happen sometimes, so if your Loud Lyrix is late in arriving, don't
fret, don't mail me and cry about your Loud Lyrix... ok?  Just  sit  tight,
and the issue will get to you soon.. sorry about that...

Well, this week I bought Slayer's "Haunting the Chapel" on CD, I found this
rare item for $12.99 and I just HAD to snatch it up... the lowest that I've
EVER seen a Slayer CD was $19.99, so I couldn't pass  up  the  opportunity,
anyways... this CD  fucking  GRINDS!!  It's  a  three  song  EP,  (with  an
additional track,  "Aggressive  Perfector"),  it's  got  Chemical  Warfare,
Captor of Sin, and Haunting the Chapel..... fucking amazing stuff, I  can't
peel myself away from it... anyways, I just have a question for any of  you
Slayer fans out there, I've got the Show No Mercy  cassette,  and  it  ALSO
includes "Aggressive Perfector", but it doesn't sound the same at all! Does
anyone know if it's a remix or if it's on the Show  No  Mercy  cassette  at
all?! It's listed in the liner's,  but  I  dunno!  Anyways,  I've  included
"Haunting the Chapel" in this issue, plus "Tormentor" an amazing tune  from
Show No Mercy.... enjoy, and yes, I AM a  Slayer  freak...  fucking  August
people.. August is the month for their new album to come  out!!!  No  exact
date set yet!

Ok people, just one final word concerning the survey... I've notice  a  few
minor errors with it.... one thing was that for the "Which rock video shows
do you watch?" I forgot to include a none of the above option. And  another
thing was the question of whether you tape  albums  onto  blank  cassettes,
lemme just tell you dudes to CHILL OUT man... fuck guyz, I  ain't  no  NARC
or some asshole sleazy record company exec, it was just that  the  M.E.A.T.
survey had that question, and I thought I'd include it..  big  deal!  Don't
worry if you say yes, I really don't care, it's just a question.

Ok dudes, that's it... don't forget to get those survey's in, as of now,  I
have had 7 handed in, that's outta like 300 of you!! Hurry  up!  Issue  #20
is right around the corner,.... ok guys, that's it...  BTW!  Guess  what  I
just noticed... it was exactly four months ago on this day that  I  started
Loud Lyrix... On March 19/94 I wrote the Loud Lyrix FAQ and the Loud  Lyrix
AD, and that's when this huge  thing  started...  fucking  amazing..  guys,
thanks to you all dudes.... let's keep this thing goin' forever!!

You don't say dude!!! The concert was awesome. Their LOOKS!!!! The  drummer
has wild Bob Marley type of hair (blonde...) and the  coolest  tatoo  of  a
snake crawling down her right ankle, (they all played barefoot btw...). The
drummer played like she just came out of the jungle and somebody gave her a
drumkit and told her: "this is drums, now PLAY!!!"  Tribal  stuff,  totally
wild and wicked...

The bassist is amazingly, incredibly sexy!!! She stood less  than  a  meter
from me (I was right next to the stage...). Her name is Maurine  Herman,  I
got to talk to her a bit after the show (no, not enough to  use  my  charms
and....). She's a cool bass player as well, and what's most exciting -  she
does that Frank Zappa trick - lights up a cigarette,  smokes  it  during  a
song and then sticks it in the space between  the  strings  and  the  upper
bridge (where the tuning keys are), so it looks like a candle...

As for the show itself, they played most of the stuff from  Fontanelle  and
the other album. The talked to the crowd a lot and were  very  nice.  There
was a lot of moshing and stagediving. Then when they played  "Handsome  And
Gretel" (my favourite song, as you can guess  from  my  posting...)  I  was
headbanging so violently that I banged my head against the  lamp  post  and
passed out for a few moments... All in all the show was WILD!!!! Just  what
I expected... Uncool stuff: Some fucker stole  the  singer's  purse  (while
they were  playing),  where  she  had  her  passport  and  $$$.  Very  very
uncool!!!!! Also, the fucking bouncers were beating the  shit  out  of  the
stagedivers, so bad that at one point the singer had to stop the  song  and
"save" a fan from being beaten to death...

Tonight would be the last night that
we had our tea
That bloody tea, which sent us into
ecstasy
Yesterday Mother complained, feeling
dizzy, all in pain

Mother's getting weaker, looking
paler day by day

As morning came, she could not make
it out of bed
And Grandma's spell was getting
straight into her head
Not a single word, she didn't seem to
be alive

Getting weaker, looking paler day by
day

Then Missy came in and she led me by
the hand
I didn't want to go, Oh but I should
have known
Mother was barely conscious, why
should I care
Just looking forward to the next
ordeal

I think I heard My sister begging me
to stay
She gave me the phone, so I could call
someone for help
I simply let go of her hand, then I cut
the wire

Missy was crying as I left them both
behind
And Mother's getting weaker, Missy
shouted at My back
"I hate You"

                           Album: "Show No Mercy"


Afraid to walk the streets
In the coldness all alone
The blackness of the night
Engulfs your flesh and bones
Hoping for relief
>From the fear you feel inside
Losing all perspective
Of reality in the night

(Chorus:)
Running from shadows
Blinded by fear
The horror of nightfall
Is ever so near
I slowly surround you
As terror sets in
Are you afraid of the night

I see the fright in your eyes
As you turn and run
But is your mind playing tricks
On a body so very young
Feeling as if no one cares
The fear runs down your spine
But I know I'll never rest
Until I know you're mine

(Chorus)

Afraid to walk the streets
In the coldness all alone
The blackness of the night
Engulfs your flesh and bones
Feeling as if no one cares
The fear runs down your spine
But I know I'll never rest
Until I know you're mine
I know you're mine
Too late to hide
Too late to save your life
Tormentor

There goes the siren that warns of the air raid
Then comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Out for the scramble we've got to get airborne
Got to get up for the coming attack.

Jump in the cockpit and start up the engines
Remove all the wheelblocks there's no time to waste
Gathering speed as we head down the runway
Gotta get airborne before it's too late.

Running, scrambling, flying
Rolling, turning, diving, going in again
Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
Run, live to fly, fly to live. Aces high.

Move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers
Let off a sharp burst and then turn away
Roll over, spin round and come in behind them
Move to their blindsides and firing again.

Bandits at 8 O'clock move in behind us
Ten ME-109's out of the sun
Ascending and turning our spitfires to face them
Heading straight for them I press down my guns

Rolling, turning, diving
Rolling, turning, diving, going in again
Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
Run, live to fly, fly to live, Aces high.

Land of anger
I didn't ask to be born
Sadness, sorrow
Everything so alone

Laboratory sickness
Infects humanity
No hope for cure
Die by technology

A world full of shit coming down
Tribal violence everywhere
Life in the age of terrorism
We spit in your other face

War of races
World without intelligence
A place consumed by time
End of it all

We're born   With pain
No more   We're dead
Embryonic cells

Corrosion inside -- we feel
Condemned future -- we see
Emptiness calls -- we hear
Final premonition -- the truth

Land of anger
I didn't ask to be born
Sadness, sorrow
Everything so alone

Laboratory sickness
Infects humanity
No hope for cure
Die by technology

We're born   With pain
Suffer   Remains
We're born   With pain
Suffer   Remains
We're dead

If ever words were spoken, painful and untrue.
I said I loved but I lied
In my life, all I wanted was the keeping of someone like you.
As it turns out, deeper within me, love was twisted and pointed at you.
- Never ending pain, quickly ending life -

Chorus:
You keep this love, thing, child, toy.
You keep this love, fist, scar, break
You keep this love.

I'd been the tempting one, stole her from herself.
This gift in pain, her pain was life.
And sometimes, I feel so sorry.
I regret this the hurting of you.
But you make me so unhappy, I'd take my life and leave love with you.
- I'd kill myself for you, I'd kill you for myself -

(Chorus)

No more head trips.

The holy cross
Symbol of life
Anticipate the lives of Christians born
Speak of death
The words of hate
Anticipate the rules among the dead
Hell has seen
Priests condemned
To bring forth the lord of the cross
Strike twelve
Raise the dead
The chapel comes under attack

The ghosts of dead
Torment the priest
Their altar will soon be destroyed
Heaven's mass
Turning black
The church will belong to the dead
Blackened magic
And thus we're lost
Lucifer will supreme
The crystal ball
Children of faith
Their lasting eternal scream

Those who never make the people scream
Have no task for all of time
Satan's form of soldiers stand in lust
Destruction charged upon the cross

Attacking there's seven ways to go
Tormenting the priest, hell to the cross
Haunting the chapel has to prevail
Death will come to the house of God that failed

Guilty as charged
But damn it, it ain't right
There is someone else controlling me

Death in the air
Strapped in the electric chair
This can't be happening to me

Who made you God to say
"I'll take your life from you!"
chorus:
          Flash before my eyes
          Now it's time to die
          Burning in my brain
          I can feel the flames

Wait for the sign
To flick the switch of death
It's the beginning of the end

Sweat, chilling cold
As I watch death unfold
Consciousness my only friend

My fingers grip with fear
What I am doing here?
chorus:

Someone help me
Oh please God help me
They are trying to take it all away
I don't want to die

Time moving slowly
The minutes seem like hours
The final curtain call I see

How true is this?
Just get it over with
If this is true, just let it be

Wakened by the horrid cream
Freed from the frightening dream

What is this that stands before me?
Figure in black which points at me
Turn around quick, and start to run
Find out I'm the chosen one
Oh nooo!

Big black shape with eyes of fire
Telling people their desire
Satan's sitting there, he's smiling
Watches those flames get higher and higher
Oh no, no, please God help me!

Is it the end, my friend?
Satan's coming 'round the bend
people running 'cause they're scared
The people better go and beware!
No, no, please, no!

[I think that this is one of the coolest songs ever... it's got an  amazing
plot and everything.. the only drawback is that it's like 15 minutes long!!
I was going nuts trying to fit it on a 90 minute tape...  anyways..  enjoy!

                            Album: "Powerslave"


Hear the rime of the ancient mariner
See his eye as he stops one of three
Mesmerizes one of the wedding guests
Stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea.

And the music plays on, as the bride passes by
Caught by his spell and the mariner tells his tale.

Driven south to the land of the snow and ice
To a place where nobody's been
Through  the snow fog flies on the albatross
Hailed in God's name, hoping good luck it brings.

And the ship sails on, back to the North
Through the fog and ice and the albatross follows on.

The mariner kills the bird of good omen
His shipmates cry against what he's done
But when the fog clears, they justify him
And make themselves a part of the crime.

Sailing on and on and north across the sea
Sailing on and on and north 'til all is calm.

The albatross begins with its vengeance
A terrible curse a thirst has begun
His shipmates blame bad luck on the mariner
About his neck, the dead bird is hung.

And the curse goes on and on at sea
And the curse goes on and on for them and me.

"Day after day, day after day,
  we stuck nor breath nor motion
as idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean
Water, water everywhere and
  all the boards did shrink
Water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink."

There calls the mariner
There comes a ship over the line
But how can she sail with no wind in her sails and no tide.

See...onward she comes
Onward she nears out of the sun
See, she has no crew
She has no life, wait but here's two.

Death and she Life in Death,
They throw their dice for the crew
She wins the mariner and he belongs to her now.
Then...crew one by one
they drop down dead, two hundred men
She...she, Life in Death.
She lets him live, her chosen one.

"One after one by the star dogged moon,
too quick for groan or sigh
each turned his face with a ghastly pang
and cursed me with his eye
four times fifty living men
(and I heard nor sigh nor groan)
with heavy thump, a lifeless lump,
they dropped down one by one."

The curse it lives on in their eyes
The mariner wished he'd die
Along with the sea creatures
But they lived on, so did he.

and by the light of the moon
He prays for their beauty not doom
With heart he blesses them
God's creatures all of them too.

Then the spell starts to break
The albatross falls from his neck
Sinks down like lead into the sea
Then down in  falls comes the rain.

Hear the groans of the long dead seamen
See them stir and they start to rise
Bodies lifted by good spirits
None of them speak and they're lifeless in their eyes

And revenge is still sought, penance starts again
Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on.

Now the curse is finally lifted
And the mariner sights his home
spirits go from the long dead bodies
Form their own light and the mariner's left alone.

And then a boat came sailing towards him
It was a joy he could not believe
The pilot's boat, his son and the hermit,
Penance of life will fall onto him.

And the ship sinks like lead into the sea
And the hermit shrieves the mariner of his sins.

The mariner's bound to tell of his story
To tell this tale wherever he goes
To teach God's word by his own example
That we must love all things that God made.

And the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man
And the tale goes on and on and on.
