Loud Lyrix, #5, 4/19/94
-----------------------

Wow! What a week this was, I was up to my ass in overdue assignments and  a
whole shit load of work from school, I just can't  wait  'til  summer!  For
once it's actually a good thing I didn't have many  submissions  this  week
to sort through, but that doesn't mean you should stop  sending  me  stuff,
remember, if there is something you want to see  in  Loud  Lyrix  that  you
think maybe I'm neglecting, the situation won't change until you  speak  up
about it... if I don't get submissions, I put in  the  songs  that  ***I***
wanna see! :-)

Well, nothing has changed much this past week for the 'zine, remember  that
the 'zine's address  is  now  lyrix@terranet.cts.com,  any  and  all  'zine
related mail should be sent there, try and be considerate,  and  only  mail
me directly if you really need too or if,  for  some  strange  reason  your
mail can't get through to lyrix@terranet.cts.com.

We are still looking for a LISTSERV to hook up  with.  The  ever  expanding
list of subscribers is making it harder and harder  for  me  to  do  it  by
hand, help me out, and try  and  find  one  for  me....  thanx!  Also,  the
Newsgroup hunt is still on, find some newsgroups for me to  regularly  post
the 'zine to each week... 

One more thing, last Saturday, I got a call from a friend of mine, he  told
me, "Holy shit Gino, you'll never believe these two shows that  are  coming
soon!" So I asked him who was playing... the first concert, at  Maple  Leaf
Gardens, $30 a ticket, with a 5000 person Gen Adm. mosh pit  in  the  rink!
The bill includes Biohazard!  Sepultura!!!!  Pantera!!!!!!!!   Whoa!...  We
got the tickets, could you believe that the entire pit  (5000  people)  and
the Gold seats in the Gardens (500 people) were sold out before  my  friend
could buy the tickets at the store!! Shit, damn these credit  card  people.
Anyways, we got Red seats... they are like the best seats... nice  view  of
the stage and everything!

The second Concert, at Molson Park in Barrie, a  30,000  person  Gen  Adm.
show (that's where they had Lollapolloza in Toronto)  includes...  Suicidal
Tendencies!! Danzig!!!! and Metallica!!!!!!!! This is the  best  news  I've
ever  had!!  I  just  can't  wait...  I'm  wearing  the  wrist  band   from
Ticketmaster right now, it guarrantees me a place in line  Thurs  when  the
tickets go on sale, number 27... I can't wait! To celebrate  these  amazing
events, I've included one song from each of  those  bands  in  this  week's
issue, except for Biohazard, since I can't find their lyrics ANYWHERE! Argh!

Later dudes, and BTW, tell me if you know ANYTHING about  these  shows,  if
you've seen 'em already, or you've heard of these tours  or  anything..  it
was a huge surprise for me!

Chapter 2 of "The Eye", by King Diamond

***************************  T H E   T R I A L  *****************************


La Reymie:
"Jeanne Dibasson, You stand accused before the Burning Court
for practising witchcraft.  Do you confess?  We have ways
to make you talk. How do you plead?"

Jeanne:
"I never did any harm to anyone.  I don't believe this."

La Reymie:
"Lead the witch to the dungeon for the test (muhahahaha)...
Bring out the glowing pins... Do it now!"

This is rotten to the core.
Jeanne is naked on the floor.
In the dungeon they want more.

La Reymie:
"Oh Jeanne you feel so good"

La Reymie is touching her body
Wrinkled fingers all over her.

La Reymie:
"So this is how you make with the devil.
We're gonna get you witchy woman.
we will never believe in you
so you better repent your sins now."

Sticking needles into her skin yeah
In the dungeon blood is everywhere
Glowing needles, needles and pins yeah
She's getting weaker, no more pain to feel

La Reymie:
"We will never believe in you 
so you better repent your sins now."

".....  We are the servants of GOD, we believe in the devil
and we've found his mark on You.  Confess witch!

".....  Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.  
Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death"

Jeanne:
"Never did I lie with any beast of thine
dogs or cats or goats. Now leave my soul alone"

La Reymie:
"He that sacrificeth unto any god save the Lord only
he shall be utterly destroyed!!!"

Jeanne:
"Now I hear, deceiving lying tongues
never have I done harm to anyone"

But they did not turn her loose
Horns and tails and cloven hoof
Can you tell me where's the proof...

where's the proof....
where's the proof....
where's the proof....
where's the proof....
where's the proof....
where's the proof....

!!!!!!!!!!!!!

[Editor -- last Monday, April 11, Sepultura hosted the Power  30  (Canada's
Headbanger's Ball), the last video they showed  was  a  new  one  for  this
song, they said that it was the first time it would be seen, but  I  wasn't
sure, could someone tell me when the first time they saw the  new  vid  for
Refuse/Resist was? Thanx... amazing song.]

Chaos a.d.
Tanks on the streets
Confronting police
Bleeding the plebs
Raging crowd
Burning cars
Bloodshed starts
Who'll be alive?!
 
Chaos a.d.
Army in siege
Total alarm
I'm sick of this
Inside the state
War is created
No man's land
What is this shit?!
 
Refuse/resist
Refuse
 
Chaos a.d.
Disorder unleashed
Starting to burn
Starting to lynch
Silence means death
Stand on your feet
Inner fear
Your worst enemy
 
Refuse/resist

                      Album: "... And Justice For All"


Blackened is the end
Winter it will send
Throwing all you see
Into obscurity

Death of mother Earth
Never a rebirth
Evolution's end
Never will it mend

Never

   Fire
   To begin whipping dance of the dead
   Blackened is the end
   To begin whipping dance of the dead
   Color our world blackened

Bustering of Earth
Terminate its worth
Deadly nicotine
Kills what might have been
 
Callous frigid chill
Nothing left to kill
Never seen before
Breathing nevermore

Never
 
   Fire
   To begin whipping dance of the dead
   Blackened is the end
   To begin whipping dance of the dead
   Color our world blackened

              Blackened

Opposition...contradiction...premonition...compromise
Agitation...violation...mutilation...planet dies
   Darkest color
   Blistered earth
   True death of life
Termination....expiration...cancellation...human race
Expectation...liberation...population...lay to waste
   See our mother
   Put to death
   See our mother die
 
Smouldering decay
Take her breath away
Millions of our years
In minutes disappears
 
Darkening in vain
Decadence remains
All is said and done
Never is the sun

Never
 
   Fire
   To begin whipping dance of the dead
   Blackened is the end
   To begin whipping dance of the dead
   Fire
   Is the outcome of hypocrisy
   Darkest potency
   In the exit of humanity
   Color our world blackened
 
              Blackened

                     Album: "Vulgar Display of Power"       


Revenge. I'm screaming revenge again
Wrong. I've been wrong for far too long.
Been constantly so frustrated, I've moved mountains with less. 
When I channel my hate to productive, I don't find it hard to impress.
 
Pre: 
Bones in traction
Hands break to hone raw energy
Bold and disastrous, my ears can't hear what you say to me.

Chorus:
Hold your mouth for the war
Use it for what it's for
Speak the truth about me
Determined.

Possessed. I feel a conquering will down inside me
Strength. The strength of many to crush who might stop me.
My strength is in number, and my soul lies in every one. 
The releasing of anger can better any medicine under the sun.

(Pre)
(Chorus)

There comes a time within everyone to close your eyes to what's real.
No comprehension to fail. I vacuum the wind for my sail
Can't be the rest, let others waste my time. 
Owning success is the bottom line.
Like a knife into flesh. After life is to death.
Pulling and punching the rest of duration
NO ONE can piss on this determination

Sometimes I try to do things, and it just doesn't work out the way  i  want
it to and I get real frustrated, and like, I try hard to do it and  I  take
my time and it just doesn't work out the way I want  it  to,  it's  like  I
concentrate on it real hard, and it just doesn't work out, and everything I
do and everything I try it never turns out, it's like I need time to figure
these things out, there's always someone there going, hey mike,  you  know,
we been noticing you've been having a lot of  problems  lately,  you  know,
maybe get away, and like, maybe you should talk about it, you'd feel a  lot
better, I go no, it's ok, you know, I'll figure it out, just leave me alone
I'll figure it out, you know, I'll just work it out myself,  and  they  go,
well you know, if you wanna talk about it I'll be here you know, and you'll
probably feel a lot better if you talk about it,  so  why  don't  you  talk
about it, I go, no, I don't want to, I'm ok, I'll figure it out myself, but
they just keep bugging me and they just keep bugging me, and it  builds  up
inside,
 
So you're gonna be institutionalized
You'll come out brainwashed with bloodshot eyes
You won't have any say
They'll brainwash you until you see their way
 
I'm not crazy - institutionalized
You're the one who's crazy - institutionalized
You're driving me crazy - institutionalized
They stuck me in an institution
Said it was the only solution
To give me the needed professional help
To protect me from the enemy, myself
 
I was in my room and I was like just staring at  the  wall  thinking  about
everything but then again I was thinking about nothing,  and  then  my  mom
comes in and I didn't even know she was there and she calls my name  and  I
didn't hear her and then she started screaming, MIKE, MIKE, and I go  what,
what's the matter, and she goes what's the matter with you?  I  go  there's
nothing wrong mom, and she goes don't give me that, you're on drugs,  I  go
no mom, I'm not on drugs, I'm ok, I'm just thinking, why don't you get me a
Pepsi? She goes, no, you're  on  drugs,  I  go  mom,  I'm  okay,  I'm  just
thinking, she goes no, you're not thinking, you're on drugs, normal  people
don't act that way. I go mom, just get me a Pepsi please, all I want  is  a
Pepsi, and she wouldn't give it to me, all I wanted was a Pepsi,  just  one
Pepsi, and she wouldn't give it to me, just a Pepsi.
 
They give you a white shirt with long sleeves
Tied around you're back, you're treated like thieves
Drug you up because they're lazy
It's too much work to help a crazy
 
I'm not crazy - institutionalized
You're the one who's crazy - institutionalized
You're driving me crazy - institutionalized
They stuck me in an institution
Said it was the only solution
To give me the needed professional help
To protect me from the enemy, myself
 
I was sitting in my room and my mom and my dad came in and they pulled up a
chair and they sat down, they go, mike, we need to talk to you, I go  okay,
what's the matter? They go me and your mom, we been noticing lately  you've
been having a lot of problems, and you've been going out for no reason, and
we're afraid that you're going to hurt somebody, and  we're  afraid  you're
gonna hurt yourself, so we decided that it would be in your  best  interest
if we put you somewhere where you could get the help that you need,  and  I
go, wait, what are you talking about, we decided? my best interest? How  do
you know what MY best interest is? How can you say what  MY  best  interest
is? What are you trying to say?  That  I'm  crazy?  When  I  went  to  your
schools, I went to your churches, I went  to  your  institutional  learning
facilities. So how can you say I'm crazy?
 
They say they're gonna fix my brain
Alleviate my suffering and my pain
But by the time they fix my head
Mentally I'll be dead
 
I'm not crazy - institutionalized
You're the one who's crazy - institutionalized
You're driving me crazy - institutionalized
They stuck me in an institution
Said it was the only solution
To give me the needed professional help
To protect me from the enemy, myself
 
It doesn't matter, I'll probably get hit by a car anyway.

Mother
Tell your children not to walk my way
Tell your children not to hear my words
what they mean
what they say
Mother

Mother
Can you keep them in the dark for life
Can you hide them from the waiting world
Oh Mother

Father
Gonna take your daughter out tonight
gonna show her my world
Oh Father

Not about to see your light
but if you wanna find hell with me
I can show you what it's like
'till you're bleeding

Mother
Tell your children not to hold my hand
Tell your children not to understand
Oh Mother

Father
Do you wanna bang heads with me
Do you wanna feel everything
oh Father

Not about to see your light
but if you wanna find hell with me
I can show you what it's like
'till you're bleeding

Words, they told me the words to say,
They taught me the way to pray,
Not 'til now I know
Feel, the way that I want to feel,
But how can it be so real
When I feeling so low?

So reach out and touch me
Show me that you're there
Teach me how to feel you whisper that you care
I know that you're my shelter, my strength, my need, my all
So why's it when I'm feeling down I can't feel you at all?

Touch me in a way that I'll know it is you
Hold me and embrace me, make me something new
Fill me with your laughter, your life, your gifts, your all
Pull me up I'm in selfbound, so numb but soon not anymore

You give me life, give me hope, give me resurrection,
You give me your peace, give your all.

There's a silence surrounding me
I can't seem to think straight
I'll sit in the corner
No one can bother me
I think I should speak now
	Why won't you talk to me
I can't seem to speak now
	You never talk to me
My words won't come out right
	What are you thinking
I feel like I'm drowning
	What are you feeling
I'm feeling weak now
        Why won't you talk to me
But I can't show my weakness
	You never talk to me
I can sometimes wonder
	What are you thinking
Where do we go from here
	What are you feeling

It doesn't have to be like this
All we need to do is make sure that we keep talking

	Why won't you talk to me
I feel like I'm drowning
	You never talk to me
You know I can't breathe now
	What are you thinking
We're going nowhere
	What are you feeling
We're going nowhere

	Why won't you talk to me

	You never to talk to me

	What are you thinking

Where do we go from here

It doesn't have to be like this
All we need to do is make sure we keep talking

Ok, that's it... don't forget to let me know anything you  know  about  the
concerts/tours  I  told   you   about...   and   also   about   Sepultura's
Refuse/Resist video.... Thanx dudes... see ya next week, and send  me  some
shit... l8r

Update: I just caught the new Anthrax video for  "Hy  Pro  Glo"...  fucking
amazing tune... their newest album truly rocks, John Bush is a genius  (did
I ever mention I high-fived him at their  concert  at  least  20  times!!),
anyways, tell me when the first time you  Americans  or  whoever  saw  this
video, I wanna know how much earlier you guys get to see shit than us.

PS: Last week, I  finally  took  the  time  to  figure  out  PGP,  the  big
encryption program that everyone is talking about... well anyways,  I  made
a key for the 'zine, and here it is... so if you have to send  me  anything
confidentially for what ever reason, or  if  you  are  just  some  paranoid
lunatic, here it is....
