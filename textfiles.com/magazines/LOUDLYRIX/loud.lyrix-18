Loud Lyrix, #18, 8/2/94
-----------------------

Hey people! We're back with issue #18 of the best 'zine on  the  net:  Loud
Lyrix!!! Yep, that's right.... you're eyes aren't deceiving you!! Hehehehe.
Anyway, it seems like forever since I did the last issue, that's  'cause  I
put that one together last Saturday... so I dunno, this issue seemed a  bit
overdue to me... but still... here we are, and better'n ever.......I HOPE!!

Ok dudes, the first five songs are "Editor's Choice" and the remaining  six
are all reader's submissions.... Thanks a lot to all our submitters...  you
guys know who you are, and I just wanna thank you for all the  work  you've
done to keep Loud Lyrix from getting stagnant and  boring...  keep  up  the
great work! I wanna see just as many, if not MORE submissions next week!!

Hey people!!! Have you gotten your survey in yet?? For about 250 of you,  I
SERIOUSLY DOUBT IT!!! C'mon people.. I've only gotten  about  30+  survey's
in so far, and the deadline is August 16th, issue #20.... so c'mon, if  you
haven't filled out your survey, snap to it,  and  get  it  in  to  me,  I'm
reprinting it in this issue again for any of you that missed issue #15.

Ok people, ok issues #14 and #16.... we  are  STILL  experiencing  problems
with the listserv, so I still do not have permission to send  those  issues
out yet, but I WILL get 'em to you, don't you worry....  anyways,  some  of
you may have gotten issue #14 perfectly, but most  of  us  got  it  with  a
shitload of blank lines in between each line of text,  so  that's  why  I'm
remailing that issue, and for #16, it didn't get out AT  ALL...  so  that's
obvious... anyway.... sorry for all this shit.

As for me, the past week has been  pretty  good,  'cept  at  work,  fucking
supervisors are SERIOUSLY starting to piss me off.... the are fucking  over
everyone, and if they don't watch out, some  heads  are  gonna  be  broken,
anyways, enough nastiness.... everything else  has  been  pretty  much  OK,
nothing special, but tolerable... ok then people.. that's it... now to  the
songs.

BTW... in someone's survey,  I  got  a  compliant  about  me  posting  King
Diamond lyrics all the time... all I gotta say  is  TOO  BAD...  each  King
Diamond album is a concept album, and if I don't  print  the  WHOLE  thing,
it's just plain useless, I hope at least  some  of  you  are  enjoying  the
story.

                               Album: "Them"


I stumbled out of Grandma's room,
down the stairs and out of the house
Once outside I felt My mind begin to
fight a battle for control

With the tea pot broken I kind of
realized
That "THEIR" power was less here,
here on the outside

I fell to my knees in haziness
And I looked in through the window
to the cellar

Things were moving down there,
"THEY" were searching for something
And "THEY" really found it,
the big axe was flying

Flying out through the cellar door
Up the stairs to the kitchen...
Then I passed out

The next thing I remember seeing was
the smoke coming from the chimney
I soon realized the smoke I saw was
actually... Oh No!
All there was left of Missy and her
dress, poor little girl

The spell was broken, I really felt the
change
As my mind and body became one
again

The moon was alive with its silvery
eye
Staring right into My evil heart

I went back to see if My Grandma'
was still there
Waiting for me in the attic... Oh I hate
that bitch

                             Album: "Psalm 69"


All the locals have the tears of regret
Open fire cos i love you to death
Sky high, with a heartache of stone
You'll never see me cos i'm always alone
How to love without a trace of dissent
I'll buy the torture cos you pay for the rent
Tied high with a broken command
You're all alone to the promised land
I'm in love with this malicious intent
You've been taken but you don't know it yet
What you will know must never live to be found
Cos it's been subject to the eyes of the drowned

                        Album: "The Ethereal Mirror"


Lack-lustre vacuum magnetizes the land,
Scopeless material in ruthless demand,
concrete spectacle superficially grand,
divine animation buried in sand.

Chorus:
Well rise from the ashes of stagnation,
crystal warriors of damnation.

Nullified grafters manufactured from the womb,
out of the repro-clinic into household tomb.
Drag the nothing tiring through coal-dark underground,
drive the wheels of iron round and round.

Repeat Chorus

Souring eyes scar through that book of lies,
and to the truth,
well our search is dignified.

Whilst the yawny drone of physical machinery
march in the robot mode to terminal destiny.

Microscopic observance,
forsaken innerland,
spiritual inertia,
absorbed in bland,
well our significance shan't sink in their charade,
'cos through their drab pantomime I say were gonna ride!

Chorus: End.

See the rider,
Rides in with the storm
And you were right beside him
But never lived a scout yet have been born
Do you, do you hear it, do ya
Hear the thunder
Deafening the devil in his abode
Can you, can you see it, can you
See the mountains darken yonder
Black and running time is running out.

Sacrifice to vice, all die by the hand of the
                                Sinner!
                                Sinner!
                                Sinner!
                                Sinner!

His steed fury,
Eyes of fire and rain ablaze
Demandin' vultures stulkin'
Drawn by the smell of warm and pain
He roams the starways
Searching for the caucuses of war
But it is only that his
Very presence
Disrupts the calling to the storm

Curse and damn you, all you fall by the hand of the
                                Sinner!
                                Sinner!
                                Sinner!
                                Sinner!

Part of the Devil, part of the Devil
OK, have you brain
Part of the Devil, part of the Devil
You better run away
Can't you hear their souls calling out
                         in their pain
Can't you see their bodies wanting searching
                         for their light

Can't you hear their souls weeping
Some chant
Or is it insane
And it's only a rant
The Sinner is near
Sensing the fear
And the beast will start movin' around...

Can't you see their souls calling out
                         in their pain
Can't you hear their bodies wanting searching
                         for the light

     ...Sinner, Sinner, Sinner, Sinner!
                                Sinner!
                                Sinner!
                                Sinner!

Sacrifice to vice, all die by the hand of the
Curse and damn you, all you fall by the hand of the
                                Sinner!

[Backwards: "Join us" x times]
[Welcome back]

Existing on damnation's edge
The priest had never known
To witness such a violent show
Of power overthrown

Angels fighting aimlessly
Still dying by the sword
Our legions killing all in sight
To get the one called Lord

The Gates of Hell lie waiting as you see
There's no price to pay just follow me
I can take your lost soul from the grave
Jesus knows your soul can not be saved

Crucify the so called Lord
 He soon shall fall to me
Your souls are damned your God has fell
To slave for me eternally
     Hell awaits...

The Reaper guard's the darkened Gates
That Satan calls his home
Demons feed the furnace where
The Dead are free to roam

Lonely children of the night
There's seven ways to go
Each leading to the burning hole
The Lucifer controls

Priests of Hades seek the sacred star
Satan sees the answer lies not far
Zombies screaming souls cry out to you
Satanic laws prevail your life is through

Pray to the moon... when it is round
Death with you shall then abound
What you seek... for can't be found
In sea or sky or underground

Now I have you deep inside my everlasting grasp
The seven bloody Gates of Hell
Is where you'll live your last

Warriors from Hell's Domain
Will bring you to your Death
The flames of Hades burning strong
Your soul shall never rest

The Gates of Hell lie waiting as you see
There's no price to pay just follow me
I can take your lost soul from the grave
Jesus knows your soul can not be saved

Sacrifice the lives of all I know they
Soon shall die
Their souls are damned to rot in Hell
and keep the fire growing deep inside
     Hell awaits...

[Your posting of "Fuck Me  Dead"  brought  to  mind  Alice  Cooper's  necro
classic, "I Love The Dead." In fact, "Fuck Me Dead" seems like  a  kind  of
rip-off. "I Love The Dead" is a little less graphic and less  misogynistic,
but it gets to the point -- Richard]

I love the dead before they're cold.
They're bluing flesh for me to hold.
Cadaver eyes upon me see nothing.
I love the dead before they rise.
No farewells, no goodbyes.
I never even knew your rotting face.
While friends and lovers mourn your silly grave,
I have other uses for you, darling.
We love the dead,
We love the dead, yeah.

                    Album: "The Last Temptation Of Reid"


Don't ask me why
But I was walking down the streets
Of Fairfax, California
And I saw this flyer hangin'
On a telephone pole, and it said
CAN GOD FILL TEETH?

For a $10 "donation"
You could see silver fillings turn
To gold and other "supernormal dental happenings."
New caps! Filled cavities! Bring a
Flashlight and a mirror and observe

But wait a minute
Didn't I just read
About how the cops are getting parents
To plant bugging devices
In their kids' teeth
So if they disappear they can track 'em
Before they wind up on the backs of milk cartons
And all that

And didn't I read
That these devices can go two-way
And everything that I do or say
Is all goin' on tape somewhere right now
Planted in my cavities
And they didn't even tell me
No wonder every bad thing
In and out of my mouth
Keeps winding up on my employment record

All those fillings
All those crowns
I'll show them
Who's the boss of my big mouth

Where's the pliers
God dammit! Where's the pliers?!?
Wilma!  Where'd you put my electric drill
This is all coming out now-TODAY!

CHORUS
Agh! Agh! Agh!
Agh! Agh! Agh!
Agh! Agh! Agh!

Must be some kind of conspiracy
The whole world's a God damn conspiracy
Look anywhere long enough, you're gonna find a conspiracy
Man, LIFE is a conspiracy!

CHORUS

Needlenose
Up my nose
-Agh!-
Where did all these wires come from?
How far up into my skull do they go
I pull out more and more copper spaghetti

How'd my Weekly World News get all wet?
God damn fishsticks melted again
What are they trying to do to me?
No secrets in the land of the free!

There
No one's gonna tell me what to do
It's worth eating baby food
The rest of my life
To be a free man
Bastards
Probably wouldn't understand me anyway

Sittin' lone inside my Head
No mirrors to reflect
Is this here the season of joy
Or the season to Inject
Lord this must be judgement day
Take a close look at myself
Are you Happy?
With the hand that you've been dealt

The bells they toll silently
Inflict Invisible Pain
Tell me which is more righteous
Chivas Regal or Cocaine
Friends won't answer your phone calls
Call your long distance family
Well i hope someone is listening
As I sing on Bandaged Knees

On this holy day
I look to the skies
Are you tryin' to find yourself
Or just rearrange the time
Open up your spirit boy
Pass that liquid love
Do you prefer possessions
Or the purity of the dove

Sing to me my little sister of mercy
Inspiration of my life
You know that I cant stand the pain
but you know that I never cry
I play for you my love song
Sung only for the damned
I wish I could spend tonight with you
But you know that I can't

Look inside my black lines
Telling stories without couth
You might not like what they say
Cause they only speak the truth
play to me (My) Tarot
Slip my neck in through the belt
You can't change the ways of the game
When the cards are already dealt

Chorus

I hear a sound 
 humming just above the ground
Above the bird sounds 
 I hear a black sound

It's dark inside
 where all the insomniacs hide
Alone and deprived
 waiting for fire to pump up the sky
 
Inside of the mound
 the oil oozes out
Like blood to the ground
 into the face, out of the mouth
 
Look Darwin in the eye
 he says evolve or die
Like bees to the hive
 so must we to survive
 
This planet is infested
The world is infested
America's infested
This planet's infested

The world is round
 the weak fall out
I see the clouds
 I'm stuck here on the ground
 
Waiting for the flood again 
 while every face is dripping with 
  the same expression, spinning, and 
   we're out  
   
This planet is infested
The world is infested
America's infested
This planet's infested

We have come from the ashes, of the burning away
Pouring blood in the fire, on the altar of pain
Led into temptation, now the black gods align
Here there is no salvation, and your blood is my wine

Here is a world that is waiting, between the living and
The dead. here the flesh and it's pleasures are 
Eternally wed. all is all for the taking, for a life or a
Lie. at the end of the breaking I'll be watching you die

Crawl to the silence, renounce and deny
The stars and the numbers,, foretold of this time
To the words and the wisdom, too the promise of lies, by
Their anger and fury,
The strong will survive.

Can't take it, never could
Time to end it, wish you would
Friends and family, they're all gone
Life for you is just a con
Dig yourself a hole in the ground
Push up daisies six feet down
Take a dirt nap, buy the farm
Inject a bubble in your arm
CHORUS: Kill yourself, kill yourself
        Why don't you kill yourself
        Don't rely on no one else
        End it all and kill yourself
        Kill yourself, kill yourself
        Why don't you kill yourself
        Don't rely on no one else
        End it all and kill yourself NOW
Life is just a one-way ticket
Everyone must go around
Here's a bucket, go and kick it
Slit your wrists without a sound
When you go don't make a big deal
No dramatics, don't overplay
'Cause don't you know that we'll all feel
Better once you've gone away
CHORUS
You're a loser
There's nothing left for you
A worthless loser
At everything you do
KILL YOURSELF NOW!!!!
