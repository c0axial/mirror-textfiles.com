Loud Lyrix, #4, 4/12/94
-----------------------

Here it is everyone, once again, week after week, the never ending,  always
persistent and God of all 'zines -------> LOUD LYRIX! <tremendous cheering>

Well everyone, it's been a sad week, as you probably know, Kurt  Cobain  is
dead at the age of 27, father of one, and husband of Courtney Love.  May he
find the peace in death, that he couldn't in life.

As you may have noticed, Loud Lyrix has changed it's address... we are  now
located at lyrix@terranet.cts.com, I have decided to make a new account for
the 'zine, and leave myself a nice, UNFLOODED, personal account. So I  just
want to tell all of you that from now on, all 'zine related mailings should
be sent to lyrix@terranet.cts.com, and that includes subscription requests,
and sign offs. So if you are 'spreading the word' for me, make sure you use
the new address ok? Again.. that's lyrix@terranet.cts.com. Thanx!

Alright people, I have a serious request for  you  all,  I  am  starting  a
"Great Usenet Hunt" here for the 'zine, I  want  all  of  you  with  Usenet
access to look around for newsgroups that I can regularly post the 'zine to
every week without getting flamed to hell! Just mail me, and  tell  me  the
address for it, eg. alt.music.zines or whatever.... I want to  change  that
line in my header that reads: Usenet: None

Ok! So here we are, we've had ONE, count 'em, ONE  response  to  "Manifest"
by Sepultura, it is from a Brazilian  brother  who  knows  what  it's  like
there, so read it. I've also included another Sepultura song in this issue,
hope you all like it.

I've also started the posting of "The Eye" by King Diamond...  look  for  a
new chapter each week... there are 10 in all, and I'm telling  you  now,  I
will NOT send anyone any chapters ahead of time, so don't even ask. :-)

We had quite a bit of submissions this week, so I wish  to  thank  all  you
people for taking the time and becoming more involved  with  Loud  Lyrix...
and that's it everyone, hope you enjoy this issue... and remember... we are
now at lyrix@terranet.cts.com.

Subject:      Re: Loud Lyrix #3

Since I'm a Brazilian, please excuse my English, I must  state  my  opinion
about Sepultura's lyrics. First, I think it's necessary to understand a bit
of Brazilian history to explain what happened. As a result of 20  years  of
dictatorial government, some sectors of society are  corrupted  and  people
have not reacted to it. Brazil has the 4th largest TV network in the  world
(Globo TV) and people only know what Globo tells them. Like this  massacre,
other facts aren't known by the Brazilian people, so the situation  doesn't
change. Or I should say it did not change. Since late 1992, when  president
Fernando Collor was deposed by a democratic  impeachment  process,  we  are
cleaning Brazil out.
   I wonder if bands like Sepultura should also communicate  this  kind  of
loud criticism in Portuguese because only 1% of the 190 million  population
of Brazil can understand English.

[Editor -- It would be nice to see  Sepultura  expressing  their  views  in
their native tongue, but I think they are singing in English  because  they
want the message to get across to the rest of the world. But they  do  have
some old songs that were in Portuguese, they sang some  for  an  encore  at
their gig here in Toronto.]

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

[Editor -- Ok everyone.... I am gonna post all the lyrics off of a  certain
album, by a certain fellow, who in my un-humble opinion,  is  the  greatest
writer and lyricist ever to walk the earth! His name is King  Diamond,  and
this certain album is called "The Eye".... I'd tell you what's it's  about,
but you can just read the songs to find that out! I  will  be  posting  one
song from the album in each issue  of  Loud  Lyrix....  in  this  one,  I'm
posting the Prologue, that gives a little background of the story (which is
for the most part true by the way!), and all the songs on this  album,  are
like a chapter in the total story.. it's really kewl.... if  you  want  the
full effect of the album, and it's energy and all that  rot,  I'd  strongly
suggest going out, and buying it! Ok.... now for the Prologue... I hope you
enjoy it, see ya on the other side!]

                  in 1625, after having been seduced by a  priest.  Died  in
                  1647 in prison.

Father Pierre David: Chaplain of the convent at Louviers till his death in

********************  E Y E   O F   T H E   W I T C H  **********************


It's so cold inside on this summer's night
Black clouds in the sky dancing before my eyes
I'm losing track of time

It's the Eye of the Witch
It's the Eye of the Witch

Thunder bring the rain, penetrate my brain
I am no more the same, that special night has come again
Losing track of time

It's the Eye of the Witch
The Eye...The eye...the eye

Another glass of wine to heat the blood of mine
And as I look inside the necklace called "The Eye"
I'm going back in time

It's the Eye of the Witch
It's the Eye of the Witch
The Eye...The eye...the eye

[Editor -- As everyone should know by now, Kurt Cobain, singer  of  Nirvana
has committed suicide at his home in  Seattle.  He  exited  this  realm  of
existence with a shotgun blast to the cranium. I can't say that I  was  the
biggest Nirvana fan in the world, but I am still as shocked or more so than
most people. As much as I hate crediting Nirvana with the "birth of Grunge"
I have to admit that they were influential in popularizing the sound,  and
I can't really say if that's a good or a  bad  thing.  But  anyways,  Kurt,
dude, this one's for you man, let's hope you're in a  better  place,  where
the tunes are always cranked, and the moshing never ends.]

                             Album: "Nevermind"


Load up on guns and bring your friends
It's fun to lose and to pretend
She's over bored and self assured
Oh no, I know a dirty word

Hello, hello, hello, how low?

I'm worse at what I do best
And for this gift I feel blessed
Our little tribe has always been
And always will until the end

Hello, hello, hello, how low?

And I forget just why I taste
Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile
I found it hard, it was hard to find
Oh well, whatever, nevermind

With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto
An albino
A mosquito
My libido
Yay, a denial

                     (original lyrics by Joan Baez)


I'll be damned, here comes your ghost again
but that's not unusual
it's just that the moon is full
and you decided to come

And here I sit, hand on the telephone
hearing the voice I'd known
a couple of light years ago
headed straight for a fall

But we both know what memories can bring
they bring Diamonds and Rust
yes we both know what memories can bring
they bring Diamonds and Rust

Now I see you standing with brown leaves all around and snow in your hair
Now we're smiling out the window of the crummy hotel over washington square
and then comes that white clouds, mingles and hangs in the air
Speaking strictly for me
we both could've died then and there

Now you're telling me you're not nostalgic
then give me another word for it
you were so good with words
and at keeping things paid

cause I need some of that vagueness now, it's all come back too clearly
yes, I love you dearly
and if you're offering me diamonds and rust
I've already paid

But we both know what memories can bring
they bring Diamonds and Rust
yes we both know what memories can bring
they bring Diamonds and Rust

Diamonds, Diamonds and Rust
Diamonds, Diamonds and Rust
Diamonds, Diamonds and Rust
Diamonds, Diamonds and Rust

Why don't you get a life and grow up
Why don't you realize that you're fucked up
Why criticize what you don't understand
Why change my words, you're so afraid

You think you have the right to
Put me down
Propaganda hides your scum
Face to face you don't have a word to say
You got in my way, now you'll have to pay

Don't, don't believe what you
See
Don't, don't believe what you read
No!!!

I know my ways, I'm here to stay
I didn't start all this yesterday
I'll prove you wrong all the way
Life teaches me you're always alone

Don't, don't believe what you
See
Don't, don't believe what you read
No!!!

                          Album: "Back in Black"


She was a fast machine,
She kept her motor clean,
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen,

She had a-sightless eyes,
Telling me no lie,
Knockin' me out with those American thighs,

Taking more than her share,
Had me fighting for air,
She told me to come, but I was already there,

'Cos the walls start shaking,
The earth was quaking,
My mind was achin',
And we were makin' it and you...

Shook me all night long,
Yeah you, shook me all night long.

Running double time on that seduction line,
She's one of a kind,
She's just mine all mine,

Well her claws,
Are just another cause,
Made a meal out of me, and come back for more,

Tried to cool me down,
To take another round,
Well I'm back in the ring to take another swing,

But the walls were shaking,
The earth was quaking,
My mind was aching,
And we were making it and you...

Shook me all night long,
Yeah you, shook me all night long,
Knocked me out, I said you
Shook me all night long,
Had me shaking and you,
Shook me all night long,
Had me shaking,
Well you shook me...

[guitar solo]

You really shook me and YOU!
Shook me all night long,
Aaaaahaaaahaaaah You...
Shook me all night long,
Yeah yeah you,
Shook me all night long,
You really got me and you,
Shook me all night long,
Yeah you shook me,
Yeah you shook me,
All night long.

Almost every day. I see the same face on broken picture tube
It fits my attitude.
If you could see yourself, you put you on a shelf, your verbal masturbate
Promise to nausiate
Today I'll play the part of non-parent
Not make a hundred rules for you to know about yourself
Not lie and make you believe what's evil is making love
And making friends, and meeting God your own way.
The right way.

Chorus:
To see, to bleed, cannot be taught 
In turn you're making us fucking hostile
We stand alone

The truth in right and wrong, the boundaries of the law.
You seem to miss the point.
Arresting for a joint?!
You seem to wonder why hundreds of people die.
You're writing tickets man, my mom got jumped, they ran!
Now I'll play a public servant.
To serve and protect by the law and the state.
I'd bust the punks that rape, steal and murder.
And leave you be, if you crossed me.
I'd shake your hand like a man, not a God.

(Chorus)

Come meet your maker boy, something you can't enjoy.
Because of heaven/hell.
A fucking wives tale they put in your head.
Then put you in your bed.
He's watching say your prayers, cause God is everywhere.
Now I'll play a man learning priesthood.
Who's about to take the ultimate test in life.
I'd question things because I am human.
And call NO ONE my father who's no closer than a stranger.

I won't listen.

(Chorus)

Wine is fine
But whiskey's quicker
suicide is slow with liquor
Take a bottle drain your sorrows
Candied thoughts await tomorrows
Evil thought and evil doings
Cold, alone you hang in ruins
Thought you'd escape the reaper
You can't escape the master keeper
'Cause you feel life's unreal and you're living a lie
Such a shame who's to blame and you're wondering why
Then you ask from your cask is there life after birth
What you saw can mean hell on this earth
Now you live inside a bottle
The reaper's travelling at full throttle
It's catching you but you don't see
The reaper is you and the reaper is me
Breaking laws, knocking doors
But there's no one at home
Made your bed, rest your head
But you lie there and moan
Where to hide, suicide is the only way out
Don't you know what it's really about

Wine is fine
But whiskey's quicker
Suicide is slow with liquor
Take a bottle drown your sorrows
candied thoughts await tomorrow

Why can't we hear
The time must come for us to leave here
Emotion has withered away
Out burnt out love has decayed

Obsessed to leave the earth
Tragedy has overrun since birth

Now our righteous fathers weep
As we greet eternal sleep
Are we born to pass away

Cry at all that remains
"Chosen words" fail to sustain
The wisdom of powers heard
In dismal thoughts seemingly absurd

Now as hope and glory dies
We'll scream at our demise
Are we lost forever more

 As we greet eternal sleep
 Are we born to pass away]

Life it seems, will fade away
8Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free

Things are not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filing me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me, but now He's gone

No one but me can save myself, but it to late
Now I can't think, think why I should even try

Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death Greets me warm, now I will just say good-bye
