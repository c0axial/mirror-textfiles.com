!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  W E ' R E   B A C K  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Yes people, it's true!! This is NOT a mirage, Loud Lyrix is finally back in
distribution after a LONG two week sabbatical... anyways, TONS has happened
during this time.

For one thing, I have finished school, after writing three exams,  and  I'm
now working at  Canada's  Wonderland,  ooops!  I  mean  Paramount  Canada's
Wonderland. (It's a big theme park located just north of Toronto for  those
of you that don't know, which is probably about 90% of you!) Well,  as  you
can probably imagine, I'm happy as hell  that  skule's  over...  I  thought
that I'd finally have a little time to rest, and catch  up  on  some  sleep
and get rid of the bags under my eyes, but NO!!  It's  even  fucking  worse
than before!!! Holy shit, I'm half dead.

Anyways, let's get to the big thing, our NEW listserv!! Many thanks go  out
to Joe Baptista of  Planet  Communications  for  taking  me  on  outta  the
goodness of his heart (!!!) Anyways, this makes things MUCH easier for  me,
more than any of you can possibly know! Hopefully by now,  Joe  has  gotten
around to sending everyone Loud Lyrix's revamped FAQ. The FAQ has  all  the
information that you'll need to know about the listserv, how to  subscribe,
and how to sign off, make GOOD USE OF IT! And  one  last  thing,  remember,
don't send anything to the list  address,  lyrix@planet.org,  'cause  it'll
just   bounce   that   mail   back   to   the    administrative    address,
lyrix@terranet.cts.com, so DON'T WASTE RESOURCES......thank you.

Ok dudes!! Ton's has happened since Issue #11 on June 7th, I  went  to  see
Pantera, Sepultura and Biohazard, and had a fucking  WICKED  time!!  But  I
unfortunately DON'T have the time right now to type  out  the  whole  story
for you dudes... it's currently 11:09 on Tuesday the 21st so I'm in a  huge
rush to get the issue done, but don't despair, I will get around to writing
an essay for this concert, plus the Metallica/Suicidal/Danzig concert  from
the 4th, AND the Scorpions concert this Saturday the 25th too!! Whoa!  What
a line up, you dudes are in for a treat.

Ok, the line up for this week  is  pretty  typical,  the  last  song  is  a
reader's submission, the rest are my own picks (as if you guyz  can't  tell
by now eh?). Yes, it's true, we have finally finished King  Diamond's  epic
"The Eye" album. Chapter 10 is  the  final  installment  in  the  story,  I
really hope you dudes liked it all, but I urge ALL of you to grab this  CD,
and listen to it, nothing compares to the actually music with  the  lyrics,
it's the only way to get the full effect. Well, the next concept  album  is
King Diamond's "Them". This album is pretty awesome, although not  as  good
as "The Eye", but still, King Diamond just can't go wrong with his stories!
This album however is MUCH better  with  the  music,  there  are  lot's  of
little special F/X that they have on the album that really  make  it  cool.
I'd recommend getting this album as well.

Well people, that's just about everything,  hopefully  next  week  I'll  be
able to write those essays I  promised,  but  I  seriously  doubt  it,  I'm
pretty fucking packed with work and other shit,  it's  UNREAL,  anyways,  I
WILL WRITE THEM!! By issue #25 I'll have 'em done for sure! :)

Chapter 10, "The Eye", by King Diamond

***************************  T H E   C U R S E  *****************************


I know what you're thinking, I can see through your brain
I know what you're doing, even though I'm far away

The power I get from the chain is mine
Only I can use it
The power I get from the chain is mine
Only I can use it

It was only yesterday, thunder rolling by, breaking up the sky
And the rain was pouring down
Pounding on my brain, driving me insane
I was drinking wine again, oh yeah blame it on the wine

The curse of "The Eye", it will take you back in time
If you look at "The Eye", it will take you back in time

The curse of "The Eye", it will take you back in time
If you look at "The Eye", it will take you back in time

I know what you're thinking, I can see through your brain
I know what you're doing, even though I'm far away

I know there's a bad side to the power of the chain
I know I'll be going back in time once again

It was on the 1st of May, thunder rolling by, breaking up the sky
And the rain was pouring down
The Inquisition came, I felt the pain
I had to relive it all in just one day

The curse of "The Eye", it will take you back in time
If you look at "The Eye", it will take you back in time

The power I get from the chain is mine
Only I can use it.

[And so ends one of the best concept albums I've ever heard in my life,  in
my un-humble opinion, Kind Diamond is THE master of story  telling...  soon
to come will be another concept album of his, entitled "Them". See ya.  And
what do you know, here it is!! I've decided  not  to  wait,  and  to  start
posting the songs to "Them" right away. -- Editor]

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

[Ok dudes, here it is, another King Diamond  concept  album,  "Them"  is  a
story about a little boy, who's name is surprisingly  "King  Diamond"!!  :)
No, I'm serious about that, ok, and he has a sister, "Missy" and a  mother,
and they live in an old house that is  supposedly  haunted  by  "THEM"  and
apparently "Grandma" is in league with "Them", and they just have one  HELL
of a time when she comes to visit from the Asylum!! Enjoy. -- Editor]

  | o whom it may concern.

    I am scared to death. 9 years ago they finally let me out,  and  I  was
just beginning to feel better. I am not Myself  any  longer.  I  guess  You
could not even recognize My face if You saw Me now. That phone call 2 hours
ago has torn Me apart. It was Grandma. She  invited  Me  back  to  the  old
house. I do not want to go back, but I must. Maybe You will  understand  My
fear if I tell You what happened during My childhood.

    18 years ago I was living  with  My  mother  and  My  sister  Missy  in
Grandma's old house. I had been told  that  Grandma  was  away  on  a  long
vacation, and that she would soon return. She did.

    I have later found out that she was actually being released  from  that
same asylum. "She's insane", they said, when she  kept  on  babbling  about
"THEM". I still cannot make up  My  mind  about  who  really  did  separate
Grandpa's head from his shoulders. You see, "THEY" were always so  nice  to
Me.

    Anyway, time is short and I must leave for the old house.  So  here  is
what happened 18 years ago. And in case we never see each other  again,  at
least You will know why.

    I bet we are going to have tea.

Look, the old bitch is back - yeah,
finally we'll get some company again
the attic room has been
locked up for far too long - just like the
old bitch herself - she's on time
though - why that silly wheelchair?
Oh she's pretending as always - but
she does make a good cup of tea.

"Oh My God she's here. Missy, listen
to what Mother says: Now You be
good to Grandma; and remember
she's been away on a long vacation.
That goes for You too King. And stop
playing that thing. Answer the door"

Hog the road, swamp the beat

Trip back on the serpent move z-man slowly bang the groove
Takin' a trip, "A real kick" to hell (shout it!)
Think'n that when she die, spirit go up to the sky
Devil come a stepp'n, brainiac a look'n below

There I was completely wasting, out of work and down
all inside it's so frustrating as I drift from town to town
feel as though nobody cares if I live or die
so I might as well begin to put some action in my life

Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law

So much for the golden future, I can't even start
I've had every promise broken, there's anger in my heart
you don't know what it's like, you don't have a clue
if you did you'd find yourselves doing the same thing too

Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law

You don't know what it's like.....

Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law

Breaking the law......

You walk this earth without a heart
You tear the innocent's soul apart
You shovel your conscience into the grave
You walk this earth without a heart
Your uniform couldn't be taken off
A tattoo burned into your flesh
Your mind, your voice
These are your instruments of death
How could you dare to be so bold
You only did as you were told
Marionettes dancing in time
To the apologetic lines
For all the monsters of our time
Who is evil, who is blind?
In the name of who you'll find
A city of souls dying for peace
Welcome to the belly of the beast
One mind, one voice
Welcome to the belly of the beast
Who hears, your voice?
Millions, never, never again
Madness, never, never again
Martyrs, dead that can't die
Monsters
Insanity, the normal state
The left hand a hammer, the right the stake
Driven so deep into the heart
It's killing love, it's killing faith
It's killing 'cause it's from the heart
What better way to demoralize
When your own children are your spies
The things you trust are not the same
Trust in death, trust in grief
Trust in hope is trust in pain
Who is evil, who is blind?
In the name of who you'll find
A city of souls dying for peace
Welcome to the belly of the beast
One mind, one voice
Welcome to the belly of the beast
Who hears, your voice?
Millions, never, never again
Madness, never, never again
Martyrs, dead that can't die
Monsters
Who is evil, who is blind?
In the name of who you'll find
You're not supposed to question faith
But how do you accept this fate?
Madness, tear the innocent's souls apart
Martyrs, shovel your conscience into the grave
Monsters
A city of souls dying for peace
Welcome to the belly of the beast
One mind, one voice
Welcome to the belly of the beast
Who hears, your voice?
This is the belly of the beast
And all the souls dying for peace
Inside the belly of the beast
Millions, never, never again
Madness, never, never again
Martyrs, dead that can't die
Monsters

We come from the land of the ice and snow,

The hammer of the gods
Will drive their ships to new lands,
To fight the horde, singing and crying:
Valhalla, I am coming!
On we sweep with threshing oar,
Our only goal will be the western shore.

Ah, ah,
We come from the land of the ice and snow,

How soft your fields so green,
Can whisper tales of gore,
Of how we calmed the tides of war.
We are your overlords.
On we sweep with threshing oar,
Our only goal will be the western shore.

So now you'd better stop and rebuild your ruins,
For peace and trust can win the day
Despite all your losing.

I was born on Olympus
To my father a son
I was raised by the demons
Trained to reign as the one

God of thunder and rock and roll

I'm the lord of the wastelands
A modern day man of steel
I gather darkness to please me
And I command you to kneel

Waiting for the revolution
New clear vision - genocide
Computerize god - it's the new religion
Program the brain - not the heartbeat

Onward all you crystal soldiers
Touch tomorrow - energize
Digital dreams
And you're the next correction
Man's a mistake so we'll fix it, yeah

Take a look at your own reflection
Right before your eyes
It turns to steel

Chorus:
There's another side of heaven
This way - to technical paradise
Find it on the other side
When the walls fall down

Love is automatic pleasure
Virtual reality
Terminal hate - it's a calculation
Send in the child for connection

Take a look at the toys around you
Right before your eyes
The toys are real

Chorus

Midnight confessions
Never heal the soul
What you believe is fantasy

Your past is your future
Left behind
Lost in time
Will you surrender

Waiting for the revolution
Program the brain
Not the heartbeat

Deliver us to evil
Deny us of our faith
Robotic hearts bleed poison
On the world we populate

Virtual existence
With a superhuman mind
The ultimate creation
Destroyer of mankind

Termination of our youth
For we do not compute
No !

When you have been down in your grave...alive
Your mind decays and you're the coffin's slave
And when at midnight an uncanny bell tolls...
Terrible noises, the dark graveyard calls

Limbs break through the dirt
Decay stinks like hell
Dark creatures in the fog
Crusted blood on the dead

Triumph of death
Triumph of death

Euronomous sends his souls
Buried by a horrible mistakes
You feel,you're eaten by worms
And the night's alive again

Repeat verse I
