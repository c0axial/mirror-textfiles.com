Loud Lyrix, #3, 4/05/94
-----------------------

Hello all you cool headbanger's out there  in  cyberspace,  Loud  Lyrix  is
back with our 3rd issue.... Where has the time flown! It  seems  like  just
yesterday that Loud Lyrix was nothing more than a spark of ingenuity in  my
mind, and now look at us, after only 2 issues, Loud Lyrix now has over  120
subscribers, plus 5 newsgroup postings, so who know  HOW  many  people  see
the 'zine.... I just wanna say thanx to all our  contributing  subscribers,
it has definitely taken a load off of myself, and it's nice  to  know  that
there actually people alive out there, and willing to help...THANX!

Now it's time for a serious request I have for all of  you,  I'm  in  GREAT
need of a LISTSERV that I could  hook  up  with,  so  I  can  automate  the
subscribing and mailing of Loud Lyrix... if any of you are  postmasters  or
sysadmin's or moderators of some list, I desperately need your help...  all
I ask  is  for  inclusion  in  your  LISTSERV...  you'll  have  my  eternal
gratitude, plus, Loud Lyrix will be better and  faster  for  everyone,  I'm
asking again.... please, please please!! :-)

Ok people, I've thought it over, and I want to offer  you  guys  something,
from now on, in addition to sending in submissions or  comments,  you  guys
can send in requests for lyrics... I will do my best to locate  the  lyrics
in the archives around the world, and if that still doesn't  work,  I  will
post your request in the 'zine, so that maybe a subscriber can help.

Ok everyone, last thing, I'm pretty disappointed in most of you, I  haven't
been getting the number of comments that  I'd  like,  if  I  don't  receive
comments, I can't print any, so you will  get  a  dry,  boring  issue  like
this one, but if I had lot's of people mailing me with  some  reactions  to
the song's we've printed, the 'zine would be a whole lot  better  and  more
interesting.... so c'mon guyz... make an effort....

Ok, here you are, Loud Lyrix #3... enjoy!

Preface: I know I don't really share most of the tastes expressed  by  Loud
Lyrix, but I like to invade lists with  my  own  perverse  tastes  whenever
possible :-). I happened to have the lyrics from an old  X-ray  Spex  album
near my computer, and I think they're pretty funny and sharp. Besides, this
great late '70s band definitely was LOUD! -- Richard Singer

[Editor -- just to let everyone know, we aren't  as  strict  as  you  think
about posting ONLY Heavy Metal lyrics in Loud Lyrix, as long as  you  don't
expect us to print some pop or A/C songs, don't worry about the  genre  you
send in, as long as it's funny or makes a statement, I'll probably  put  it
in, it's always worth a shot to ask right?]

I know I'm artificial
But don't put the blame on me
I was reared with appliances
In a consumer society

When I put on my make-up
The pretty little mask not me
That's the way a girl should be
In a consumer society

My existence is illusive
The kind that is supported 
By mechanical resources
My existence is illusive
The kind that is supported 
By mechanical resources

I wanna be insta-matic
I wanna be a frozen pea
I wanna be dehydrated
In a consumer society

In a consumer society
In a consumer society

The Reverend he turned to me
Without a tear in his eyes It's nothing new for him to see
I didn't ask him why
I will remember
The love our souls had sworn to make
Now I watch the falling rain
All my mind can see
Now is your (face)


Well I guess
You took my youth
I gave it all away
Like the birth of a
New found joy
This love would end in rage
And when she died
I couldn't cry
The pride within my soul
You left me incomplete
All alone as the
Memories now unfold

Believe the word
I will unlock my door
And pass the
Cemetary Gates

Sometimes when I'm alone
I wonder aloud
If you're watching over me
Some place far abound
I must reverse my life
I can't live in the past
Then set my soul free
Belong to me at last
Through all those
Complex years
I thought I was alone
I didn't care to look around
And make this world my own
And when she died
I should've cried and spared myself some pain...
Left me incomplete
All alone as the memories still remain

The way we were
The chance to save my soul
And my concern is now in vain
Believe the word
I will unlock my door
And pass the cemetary gates.

Well I've opened up my veins too many times
And the poison's in my heart and in my mind
Poison's in my bloodstream, poison's in my pride
I'm after rebellion, I'll settle for lies

Is it any wonder that my mind's on fire
Imprisoned by the thoughts of what you do
Is it any wonder that the joke's an iron
And the jokes on you

Experiments that failed too many times
Transformations that were too hard to find
Poison's in my bloodstream, poison's in my pride
I'm after rebellion, I'll settle for lies

Yes I know the secrets of the iron and mind
They're trinity acts a mineral fire
Yes I know the secrets of the circuitry mind
It's a flaming wonder telepath

Well I've opened up my veins too many times
And the poison's in my heart and in my mind
Poison's in my bloodstream, poison's in my pride
I'm after rebellion, I'll settle for lies

Is it any wonder that my mind's on fire
Imprisoned by the thoughts of what you do
Is it any wonder that the joke's an iron
And the jokes on you

And the joke's on you ...

A good night, the best in a long time
A new friend turned me on to an old favorite
Nothing better than a dealer who's high
Be high, convince them to buy

What's my drug of choice?
Well, what have you got?
I don't go broke
And I do it a lot

Seems so sick to the hypocrite norm
Running their boring drills
But we are an elite race of our own
The stoners, junkies, and freaks

Are you happy? I am, man.
Content and fully aware
Money, status, nothing to me
'Cause your life is empty and bare

You can't understand a user's mind
But try, with your books and degrees
If you let yourself go and opened your mind
I'll bet you'd be doing like me
And it ain't so bad

Say, I do it a lot!
Say, I do it a lot!
Say, I do it a lot!
Say, I do it a lot!

Eyes wide open, feed on every line
Every picture, every word
The cut so deep and razor fine
And is it any wonder
That what I hate is what I seek?

When blood becomes the common scene
When heart is hard and flesh is weak?
And I will not be lied or denied
I will not accept, respect or bow to..

Everything you give is everything you take
And I don't even think
That I know how to.

Turn around and walk 
Into the death that was my life
Or maybe life that was my death
And I may be your human target
But only 'til my final breath.

Force fed
Exploited 'til dead
Force fed
Misguided 'til dead

Crush the soul and fill the hole
With any substitute to take the place
Far away
>From sacrifice and grace

Eyes wide open and
I'm blind, blind, blind
Smoke from your lips to
Take my vision
Blood from the sun to make me shine.

[ Editor -- Ok people, I just want to mention  that  this  is  my  FAVORITE
Metallica song of ALL TIME... it ranks as one of my all time favorite songs
ever, truly a master piece, but of course, the without the music, how could
you tell? :-) ]

By the last breath of the fourth winds blow
Better raise your ears
The sound of hooves knocks at your door
Lock up your wife and children now
It's time to wield the blade
For now you have got some company

   The Horsemen are drawing nearer
   On the leather steeds they ride
   They have come to take your life
   On through the dead of night
   With the four Horsemen ride
   or choose your fate and die

You have been dying since the day
   You were born
You know it has all been planned
The quartet of deliverance rides
A sinner once a sinner twice
No need for confession now
Cause now you have got the fight of your life

   The Horsemen are drawing nearer
   On the leather steeds they ride
   They have come to take your life
   On through the dead of night
   With the four Horsemen ride
   or choose your fate and die

Time
has taken its toll on you
The lines that crack your face
Famine
Your body it has torn through
Withered in every place
Pestilence
For what you have had to endure
And what you have put others through
Death
Deliverance for you for sure
There is nothing you can do

So gather round young warriors now
and saddle up your steeds
Killing scores with demon swords
Now is the death of doers of wrong
Swing the judgement hammer down
Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat

   The Horsemen are drawing nearer
   On the leather steeds they ride
   They have come to take your life
   On through the dead of night
   With the four Horsemen ride
   or choose your fate and die

You ran out of lies!
You ran out of lies!  Lies!
Stronger than reason, stronger than life
The only truth I know is the look in your eyes
The look in your eyes!
Just like a car crash, just like a knife
My favorite weapon is the look in your eyes
You ran out of lies!

You ran out of life!
You ran out of lies!
Get out of my life!

And I'm chewing on glass and tasting my fingers
I'm not the one who's run out of lies, lies!
You ran out of life!
You ran out of time!

Judging my faith and walking on splinters
I lost my soul to the look in your eyes
Your eyes!  You ran out of lies!
Ran out of time...
Stigmata!  You ran out of lies!

Oh, you have empty eyes!  (yes)
Oh, you have empty lies!  (yes)
They told me nothing
Nothing but lies!
Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!
Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!
Fuck me!  Fuck me!
Fuck you!  Fuck you!
Fuck everyone!  Fuck the church!
Fuck Jesus!  Fuck Mary!
Fuck the Jews!  Fuck the Buddhists!
Fuck the Hindus!  Fuck George Bush!
Fuck his ugly wife!  Fuck Tipper Gore!
Fuck everyone!  Fuck Gorbachev!
Fuck Noriega!  Fuck all these assholes!
Fuck you!  Fuck me!  Fuck all of you!
Stigmata!  Stigmata!  Stigmata!  Stigmata!
They told me nothing but lies!
Lies!  Lies!  Lies!  Lies!

[ Editor -- Ok dudes, here is one song that I want EVERYONE to comment  on,
it's by Sepultura, a Brasilian Death Metal band (if  you  didn't  know),  I
think this song has an excellent message, and it pretty  much  explains why
they had "Kill the  Cops"  and  "Pig-Proof"  on  their  speakers  at  their
concert!... but still, I believe that their hatred is  justified,  if  this
story is any indication of the behavior of Brasilian cops. ]

                            Album: "Chaos A.D."


Friday, October 2nd, 1992
Chaos has descended in  "Carandiru,"
The biggest penitentiary complex in
South America
Over a hundred inmates dead and
Hundreds injured on the massacre
The police arrived with helicopters
And over two hundred armed forces

They took the jailblock
Called
"Pavihao Nove"
And opened fire on the
Inmates in a Holocaust, method of
Annihilation, the government of the city
Of Sao Paulo cannot control
The brutality of its police

Holocaust, body piles
Confrontation, mutilation
Discipline, ignorance
Conflagration, torture
 
Over eighty percent of the inmates were
Not sentenced yet, the bodies were filled
With bullets and bites from the police dogs
The police try to hide the massacre saying
There were only eight deaths

The violence of Brasilian cops is very well
Known outside of Brazil, this kind of
Extermination is a method that they use to
Get rid of the over population in the jails
The violence of the cops left the whole
Pavillion destroyed after the rebellion

"Pavihao Nove" (Pavihao 9)

Whew! That's it! .... if any of you are interested in how long it takes for
me to put together an issue of Loud Lyrix.... it usually takes me 10 to  20
minutes to put all the songs  together,  and  type  up  my  editorials  and
stuff, but first I have to format the songs the way you see them, and  that
is a very tedious job... but enough boredom... have a good  week  everyone,
I hope your Easter was enjoyable,  and  don't  forget  about  the  LISTSERV
thing, I BADLY need one to hook up with, so please help me out.

C-ya!
