Well every time I move  Every step I make
You know I just can't seem to take the right direction

I'm always wrong  I'm never right
Right or wrong  There always seems to be a correction

And I give everything I got
And they take Take Take Take Take everything I'm giving

My back is tired my legs both ache  
In this life there is no cake   This life I'm livin'

CHORUS:  
I stand alone today   WHY YOU FEEL   Don't ask me why I feel
I just know I feel this way  WHAT YOU SAY  I stand alone today
I stand alone today   WHY YOU FEEL   Don't ask me why I feel
I just know I feel this way  WHAT YOU SAY  I stand alone today

Well you look at me  Shake your head
Don't like my hair  You're so misled  I shit like you do
But the curse is more than on my head
Sometimes I think I'm better off dead  It's worse than Voodoo

And I'm reaching out for help  
But it's No No No No No until you give in

My back's still tired  My legs both ache
In this life there is no cake   This life I'm livin'

CHORUS:

Well they take They take everything I'm givin'  
It's a rough life  This life I'm livin'
Give me more  Give me more   I take more everyday
I'm gonna take it till they take Take Take Take 
Take Take Take Take me away

SOLO

CHORUS:

I say I--I--I stand alone today   I--I--I stand alone today
I say I--I--I stand alone today   I--I--I stand alone today
I say I--I--------

If there's a way  I'll be the first in line
But it better work this time

What d'ya mean I couldn't be the President of the United States of America?

I fucked your girlfriend last night.
While you snored and drooled, I fucked your love.
She called me daddy, and I called her baby when I
smacked her ass. I called her sugar when I ate 
her alive till daylight, and I slept with her all 
over me, from forehead to ribcage I dripped her ass.
Sometimes I thought you might be spying, living out some
brash fantasy, but no. you were knocked out. But we were 
all knocked out you know. In a way

I serve to many masters.

We didn't know you'd break the bottle that the magic 
came in to use those jagged shards to slit our wrists
and neck, and you'd do it too, you're that kind of dude
But you wouldn't know what you were doing because 
I didn't, your girlfriend could have been a burn
victim, an amputee, a dead body, but god damn I wanted to 
fuck

I'm serving to many masters.

Drifting
In the Air
Above a Cold Lake
Is a Soul
>From an Early
Better Age
Gasping for
A Mystic Thought
In Vain... but Who's to Know
Further on Lies Eternal Search
For Theories to Lift the Gate
Only Locks Are Made Stronger
And More Keys Lost as Logic Fades
In the Pool of Dreams the Water Darkens
For the Soul That's Tired of Search
As Years Pass by
The Aura Drops
As Less and Less
Feelings Touch
Stupidity
Has Won too Much
The Hopeless Soul
Keeps Mating

In An Hour Of The Night I Hear The Summoning Voices
And Wake From My Funeral Sleep
In Time Before Light In Crypts Of Eternal Deeps
Dust From My Grave Blew Away With The Winds
On A Cryptic Journey Unto The Other Side
Beneath The Mountains And Passed Beyond The Gate Below
Floating Evil Reign With Fear In These Sarcastic Caves
Enlightened Into A Blacker Dark For There Are View In
Darkness
The Light Is Searching To Save The Soul Of Mine
It Is Blind And Cant See The Gate To Immortality
Harnessbells Hail My Soul The Gate Is All I Know
See The Eternity Open
The Light Will Disappear It Was Never Here

                    Parody of "Unforgiven"  by Metallica


She runs around in shorts,
And skimpy halter tops,
She's always fighting crime,
Her work it never stops.

Throughout her life the same,
She puts bad guys to shame,
The fight they cannot win,
A pretty dame they see will make them pay,
For their sleazy scuzzy ways,
This woman of such fame,
Of course she has a name......

Long black hair, gold head band,
She an justice, hand in hand,
Fighting crime -- all the time,
To this she'll put an end!
Long black hair, gold head band,
She and justice, hand in hand,
There's some hope -- she's got a rope!
So we dubbed her Wonder Woman....

Articulate retention attenuating tension
Weaknesses are tucked away
Mesmerizing fiction, cover-up addiction
Flattery is here to stay

    Benevolence astounding
    Sunshine smiles abounding
    Cannot stop this flattery
    Evasiveness ungrounded
    With tolerance confounded
    Cannot stand this flattery

    Cannot stand this easy
    Flattering society

    Flattery

Rushing to attention, forestall-your-wish intention
Ever-pending sympathy
Never contradiction, conformity affliction
Bordering on insanity

    Benevolence astounding
    Sunshine smiles abounding
    Cannot stop this flattery
    Evasiveness ungrounded
    With tolerance confounded
    Cannot stand this flattery

    Cannot stand this weakly
    Cowering society

    Flattery

Reconciling antics, words without semantics
Circle of stupidity
I write these poison pieces, they will when they read this
Smile benignly, flatter me

    With euphemisms lightening
    Wrongs they should be fighting
    Mean superficiality
    Still these things amaze me
    Think I'm going crazy
    Had to write this parody

    Cannot stand this easy
    Parody of equality

                Parody of "Through the Never"  by Metallica
                

All that is, was and will be
Chopped up fruit much too big to drink
Time and space never ending
Disturbing thoughts, questions pending
Limitations of methods of containing
Too quick to realize
Obligation to liquify
We hunger, oh gimmie five
 All that is, ever
 Ever was
 Will be ever
 Twisting
 Turning
 Through the blender

In the fridge, see past the fries
Pursuit of meat no matter where it lies
Gazing up to the shelves in the heavens
On a quest, pasta, raisins
Came to be, how it begun
All alone in the family on the run
1 pm lunch break teasing everyone
Drink it down, lunch done at half past one
 All that is, ever
 Ever was
 Will be ever
 Twisting
 Turning
 Through the blender

On through the blender
It must go
On through the blender
Out to the
Food digestor
It must go
On through the blender
Forever blender runs
 All that is, ever
 Ever was
 Will be ever
 What we eat
 Is forever
 Twisting
 Turning
 Through the blender
 Blender

I'm a rolling thunder
pouring rain
I'm coming down like a hurricane
My lightnin's flashing
across the sky
you're only young
but you're gonna die

Prechorus
 Won't take no prisoners
 won't spare no lives
 nobody's putting up a fight
 I got my bell
 gonna take you to hell
 I'm gonna get ya
 Satan's get ya

Chorus
 Hell's bells Hell's bells
 You got me ringing
 Hell's bells
 my temperature's high
 Hell's bells

I'll give you black sensations
up and down your spine
If you're into evil (??)
you're a friend of mine
See my white light flashing
as I split the night
cause if good's on the left
I'll stick to the right

Prechorus

Get up
And get your grandma outta here
Pick up
Old Jim is workin' hard this year
And baby
Do the things he says to do

Baby, if you're feeling good
And baby if you're feeling nice
You know your man is workin' hard
He's worth a deuce

Honey
Don't put your man behind his years
And baby
Stop cryin' all your tears
Baby
Do the things he says to do
Do it

Baby, if you're feeling good
And baby if you're feeling nice
You know your man is workin' hard
He's worth a deuce

And baby, if you're feeling good
Yes baby if you're feeling nice
You know your man is workin' hard
Yeah

   Covered in sinners and dripping
              with gilt
     Making you money from slime
           and from filth
 Parading your bellies in ivory towers
  Investing our lives in your schemes
           and your powers

   You got to watch them - Be quick
              or be dead
   Snake eyes in heaven - The thief
             in your head
  You've got to watch them - Be quick
              or be dead
   Snake eyes in heaven - The thief
            in your head...
	       Be quick!
	      Or be dead!
	       Be quick!
	       Or be dead

   See... what's ruling all our lives
   See... who's pulling the strings...
  I bet you won't fall on your face...
   Your belly will hold you in place

   The serpent is crawling inside of
               your ear
  He says you must vote for what you
             want to hear
Don't matter what's wrong as long as you're
               alright
     So pull yourself stupid and rob
            yourself blind

All right, before you go, lemme just remind you of a couple things... 

As you can see, I've started posting to Newsgroups, thanks  to  Sartre  for
helping me find some groups that wouldn't mind being posted to, but I  know
for a FACT that there are more groups out there, so just drop me a note  if
you find any good ones, and I'll add it to the list....

We STILL are not on a LISTSERV, so tell me if you can get one for me.

And for all you contributors... thanks a lot for  your  help,  but  PLEASE,
make sure that you have this when you send in songs:

The TITLE OF THE SONG
The Title of the album
The Name of the group
And your Name, as you would like it to appear in the 'zine

Now that ain't too hard is it?

C-ya
