Loud Lyrix, #2, 3/29/94
-----------------------

Hello people! We're back with our second issue of  Loud  Lyrix.  The  first
issue went really well, and I'm glad you guys (the ones  that  wrote  me!),
liked it. I hope you all enjoy this issue as much or more! This week  we've
had some reader submissions, only the first three songs are  from  me,  the
rest are from readers, plus a bonus  song,  "Reeking  Breath",  a parody of
Metallica's ever kewl "Creeping Death".... it's really funny, so I  thought
I'd share it with the rest of you.  I  still  have  lots  of  work  to  do,
converting some lyrics I have  to  printable  format,  and  checking  their
spelling and everything, but don't fret, I'll get around to  it  sooner  or
later.

Many thanks to all our subscribers who have  been  spreading  the  word  on
Loud Lyrix. As it stands right now, we  have  79  subscribers.  An  amazing
number considering this is only our second issue. But we need more and more
people to spread the word, so if you know of some lists  or  newsgroups  to
post our ad too, just tell me, and I'll send you an official copy of our ad
so you can post it.

Comments and reactions are always welcomed, most, if not all  the  comments
I receive will be printed in an upcoming issue. Also, as  always,  SEND  IN
LYRICS, if there is something you want to see, or some band that you  think
we never print, then either send me the lyrics,  or  send  a  request,  and
I'll do my best to find them. BTW, when you send in lyrics, make SURE  that
you tell me who performs the song, which album  it's  from  and  especially
the title of the song. Also, tell me if it's a cover or not,  and  who  the
original performers were. This is just common  courtesy,  because  I  don't
have time to hunt around, and find the information  on  a  whole  bunch  of
miscellaneous songs.

Ok everyone, here's Loud Lyrix #2.

Nah . . . Maybe this band just doesn't do it for me . . . The lyrics strike
me as pretentious, the song doesn't convey enough meaning to  justify  some
of the big language. It's just a matter of taste -- don't start a flame war
with me now :-) . . .

I laughed at this in spite of myself . . . The black humor  is  reminiscent
of the Dead Boys. But when the Dead Boys sang "I'm gonna beat up  the  next
hippie I see" back in 1977, it was a little more fun, because  the  hippies
were putting out so much bad music and culture. But  what's  the  point  of
picking on a hippie these days? The targets of this song are too easy . . .
It's easy to poke fun at marginal types. Gwar's point  may  be  that  these
people choose to marginalize themselves, but the people in  the  mainstream
often are even worse. I guess I'm going on longer about  this  one  because
Gwar shows a great comic talent . . . I just wish it were aimed at a better
place. (I like their grotesque puppet videos, though.)

                          Album: "'74 Jailbreak"


There was a friend of mine on murder
And the judge's gavel fell,
Jury found him guilty,
Gave him sixteen years in hell.
He said "I ain't spending my life here,
I ain't living alone,
Ain't breaking no rocks on the chain gang,
I'm breakin' out and headin' home.

Gonna make a Jailbreak
And I'm lookin' towards the sky,
I'm gonna make a Jailbreak,
Oh, how I wish that I could fly.

All in the name of Liberty
All in the name of Liberty
Just set me free

Jailbreak, let me out of here
Jailbreak, sixteen years,
Jailbreak, had more than I can take
Jailbreak, yeah."

He said he'd seen his lady being fooled with
by another man.
She was down and he was up
He had a gun in his hand.
Bullets started flying everywhere
And people started to scream
Big man lying on the ground
With a hole in his body
Where his life had been
But it was

All in the name of Liberty
All in the name of Liberty
I got to be free.

Jailbreak, Jailbreak
I got to break out
Out of here.

Heartbeats they were racin',
Freedom he was chasin',
Spotlights, sirens, rifles firing,
But he made it out
With a bullet in his back.

End of passion play, crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your deaths' construction
Taste me you will see
More is all you need
You're dedicated to
How I'm killing you
    
    Come crawling faster
    Obey your master
    Your life burns faster
    Obey your Master
              Master

    Master of puppets I'm pulling your strings
    Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
    Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
    Just hear my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
    Master
    Master

Needlework the way, never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror
Taste me you will see
More is all you need
You're dedicated to
How I'm killing you

    Come crawling faster
    Obey your Master
    Your life burns faster
    Obey your Master
              Master

    Master of puppets I'm pulling your strings
    Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
    Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
    Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
    Master
    Master
    Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
    Master 
    Master

Master, Master, where's the dreams that I've been after?
Master, Master, you promised only lies
Laughter, laughter, all I hear or see is laughter
Laughter, laughter, laughing at my cries

Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Never ending maze, drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season
I will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you too

    Come crawling faster
    Obey your Master
    Your life burns faster
    Obey your Master
              Master

    Master of puppets I'm pulling your strings
    Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
    Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
    Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
    Master
    Master
    Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
    Master 
    Master

Up here in space
I'm looking down on you.
My lasers trace
Everything you do.

You think you've private lives
Think nothing of the kind.
There is no true escape
I'm watching all the time.

I'm made of metal
My circuits gleam.
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean.

I'm elected electric spy
I protected electric eye.

Always in focus
You can't feel my stare.
I zoom into you
You don't know I'm there.
I take a pride in probing all your secret moves
My tearless retina takes pictures that can prove.

Electric eye, in the sky
Feel my stare, always there
There's nothing you can do about it.
Develop and expose
I feed upon your every thought
And so my power grows.

Protected.  Detective.  Electric eye.

No more will I regress backward,
from that which I believe.
I owe no mann an explanation,
expect no apology.

Logic defends age old prophecies,
Christ's life, death and
resurrection,
proof of absolute deity,
expect no apology.

Not one regret
impenitent

No more will I regress backward
from which I believe
I owe no man an explanation
expect no apology.

Not one regret

This song is "Face The Day" by The Angels (an aussie metal band).  You  may
be more familiar with the Great White version, which was after  all,  their
first big hit. Here's the original, which really kicks twice as much ass as
the GW cover did. -- Alex Carranza

I don't wanna face the day, the day, today
I don't wanna face the day, the day, today

Long night leaves me stranded
Black visions, danger signs
No love, need protection
Feels like I'm on production line
Daggers of dawn, cold hearted-day
Why does it have to be morning?
Cover my head, stayin' in bed
Too late, the luckless warning

I don't wanna face the day, the day, today
I don't wanna face the day, the day, today

Outside, screaming city
Red lights and hungry eyes
Sucks like a space invader
The vacuum of its lies
Stealing my strength, stealing my time
It's reigning in a world of traitors

I don't wanna face the day
I don't wanna face the day

Let me keep on sleeping
Forget that I'm alone
One day of faceless living
Is 24 hours too long!

I don't wanna face the day
I don't wanna face the day

I don't wanna face the day, the day, today
I don't wanna face the day, the day, today

Give the night, it's more forgiving
Hold back the light from my eyes
Please stay invisible darkness
Can't see the tears I cry
I know it's coming loaded with nothing
Trapped in a tunnel of time

I don't wanna face the day  (repeats to end)

Blood keeps drinking away
Certain of its destination
Driving through New Orleans at night
Gotta find a destination

Just one fix

Life keeps slipping away
Fighting in a war with damnation
Poised, keep cutting away
I'm looking in through to salvation

Just one fix

Like if I boarded a train
Trying to take in another station
Join us and the choice will be made
Unless we kill the lie as a nation

Just one fix

                        Album: "Dark Side of the Moon"

 
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
You fritter and waste the hours in a off hand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
  
Tired of flying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you       
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun      
                                                              
And you run and you run to catch up with the Sun              
But it's sinking and racing around to come up behind you again
The Sun is the same in the relative way, but you're older     
And shorter of breath and one day closer to death             
                                                              
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time    
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone the song is over, thought i'd something more to say
