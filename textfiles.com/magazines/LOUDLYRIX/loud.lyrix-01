When the power chords come crashing down go tearing through my senses
It's for the strong, not for the weak
In the light and dark dimension

It stimulates, regenerates
It's therapeutic healing
It lifts our feet up off the ground
and blasts us through the ceiling

Between the eyes
I hear it screaming
And it electrifies
Your inner feelings

Hot shock waves charge the air
All heads are banging
Fists pumping everywhere
Guitars are cranking

Heavy Metal, Heavy Metal
What do you want
Heavy Metal, Heavy Metal
What do you want

Ten thousand lights come blazing down
With razor sharp precision
The speakers pour out molten steel
The beat gives double vision

An armour plated raging beast
That's born of steel and leather
It will survive against all odds
Stampeding on forever

Between the eyes
I hear it screaming
And it electrifies
Your inner feelings

Hot shock waves charge the air
All heads are banging
Fists pumping everywhere
Guitars are cranking

Heavy Metal, Heavy Metal
What do you want
Heavy Metal, Heavy Metal
What do you want

Well sweet little sista's high in hell cheat'n on a halo
Grind in a odyssey holocaust heart kick on tomorrow
Breakdown
Agony said "Ecstasy" in overdrive she come a riding on the world
Thunder kiss'n 1965
Yeah, wow! Five, yeah, wow!!
Demon-warp is coming alive in 1965
Five, five, yeah!           
Livin' fast and dying young like a endless poetry
My motor-psycho nightmare freak out inside of me
My soul salvation liberation on the drive
The power of the blaster move me faster 1965
Yeah, wow! Five, yeah, wow!!
Demon-warp is coming alive in 1965
Five, five, yeah!
Gimme that, gimme that now, now, now, yeah!
Roll'n like a supersonic another fool that gets down on it
Pig sweat a million miles, I got a heart atomic style
I make it look easy, that's what I said
Blast of silence explodes in my head
Yeah, yeah, yeah, gimme that, gimme that now
Step to the moonshine frenzy hail: The Resurrection
What's new pussycat, can you dig the satisfaction
Well, you can't take it with you, but you can! In overdrive
Yeah! Some like it hot and twist'n, 1965
Yeah, wow! Five, yeah, wow!!
Demon-warp is coming alive in 1965
Five, five

Can't you see I'm easily bothered by persistance
One step from lashing out at you...
You want in to get under my skin, and call yourself a friend.
I've got more friends like you what do I do?

Pre:
Is there no standard anymore?
What it takes, who I am, where I've been, belong.
You can't be something you're not
Be yourself, by yourself, stay away from me.
A lesson learned in life, known from the dawn of time

Chorus:
Respect, Walk

Run your mouth when I'm not around, it's easy to achieve.
You cry to weak friends that sympathize.
Can you hear the violins playing your song?
Those same friends tell me your every word

(Pre)
(Chorus)

Are you talking to me?
No way punk.

       Having control... a principle obsession
       Rivalry and retribution
       Death! The only solution!!
                      
Injured soul lies on the ground
Head blown off... face down
Lying in a blood of blood
An accidental death, homocide!

Chorus

Struggling to survive
The drug induced warfare
To have control.. and principal obsession
Expenable youth... fighting for possesion
Violence is ONLY a friend

Expenable youth
Fight for possesion
To have control... a principal obsession
Rivalry and retribution
Death! The only solution!!!

       Album: "Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed, and the Way to Suck Eggs"


They get you ready to fight
The fuse is ready to blow
You shoot to kill on sight
They call you G.I. JOE
You never wanted to stop
The smell of burning flesh
The hero marches alone
Across the highway of death
 
It's not a matter of rights
It's just a matter of war
Don't have a reason to fight
They never had one before
You're just a killing machine
He's come to take you down
We take the gas that we need
And pump the blood on the ground

They're gonna set you up
So they can take you down
They're gonna suck you dry
They've left the blood to be found
They're gonna rip you apart
You're gonna burn at the stake
Cuz when it's time to collect
It's only heroes who pay

                     Album: "Scumdogs of the Universe"       


With a battle-cry go forth
Which is "give the people what they want"
And what the people want could only be the senseless slaughter
of the gutter-slime which litters this nation for cash and prizes

Yes, this is the show where people bet their lives to win something big
'Cause when your life is shit, then you haven't got much to lose
On Slaughterama...

This next geek is guilty of the following:
A grateful dead life in which he's been wallowing
Tried to tell us, "Give peace a chance"
Met the National Guard and you shit in your pants
It's not your imagination, it's not a bad tripping
Yes, that's it:  it's a big, smelly hippy

Hello Mr. Hippy, nice to meet ya'
Hey, you got a little shit between your toes
So, how are things at the ol' manure factory?
How's little Tofu?
What, she grew another head?
Well, ya gotta lay off that LSD, ya know
Kinda makes your offspring goofy looking

So, how do you hide money from a hippy?
Put it under the soap!

I'm sorry, but that answer wasn't in time
You're gonna have to put your mouth on this
Oh, I blew your head clean off
Good thing I was such an expert shot
With the National Guard back at Kent State
I bagged four that day
There's nothing like hippy hunting
My dad always used to take me along with Lee Harvey Oswald

All right, we're rockin' now!

World's highest hair, world's tightest pants
Got no circulation but you still can dance
Fashion is a statement, sometimes a risk
Every fashion had it's faults but yours is the pits
Always in black, looks like he's dead
Here's the Art Fag lying on his death beg

Hello, Mr. Art Fag, c'mon out here
Say, whatta hair do
Why it's awfully big
As big as the...the...the Hindenburg
And it'd probably go up just as fast if I put this lighter to it
But no, I'm gonna' hold out and ask you this question

What ever happened to Eddie Munster?
I'm lookin' at him!

Oh, Oderus, help the boy with his hairdo, there
Ooo!  It's getting ripped off!
Ow!  Ya' know that's gotta hurt!
What on the other side of his face?
Is that a facelift?
Whoa!  He's torn that face clean off!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Help that sod outta' here

Gave up pussy, stopped doing toot
Now ya' can't wait to kiss him on the boot
Elbows and knuckles all you know how
Follow the herd, just another cow
Brain full of shit, boots full of lead
Straight from Hitler's ass, it's the Nazi skin-head

Hello, Mr. Nazi Skin-head, how ya' doin'
How's Geraldo's nose?  Still broken?
Well, it's good to see you're still on the job.
You know, when you're mugging talk-show commentators in bathrooms
Always remember to draw the swastikas turning to the right
Not to the left, always to the right.

Hey, why do Nazi skin-heads wear red suspenders anyways?
He doesn't have to tell you!

Time to give this Nazi skin-head one more haircut
Real close to the shoulders like
Whoa!  His head's been decapitated
Look at all that P.S.I. in his aorta artery
Whoa!  Is he a gusher or what?
A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

Well everybody, that's all for this week
We've killed everybody that's worth killing
Hope you do the same
We'll be back next week with another edition of

Slaughterama, Slaughterama, Slaughterama
It's a drama
Slaughterama, Slaughterama, Slaughterama
It's a drama, yeah!

It's called existentialists, man
It's for the people who just don't care
Don't feel sorry for them
They've chosen their own path in life
