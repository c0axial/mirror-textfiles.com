----------------------------------------------------------

ALRIGHT DUDES!!!! We're back! And stronger  than  ever!!  I  hope  all  you
dudes and dudettes out there like this MEGA-FUCKING-ISSUE. I  found  myself
with an abundance of free time on my hands this LONG Victoria Day  weekend,
so I thought that  I'd  so  something  REALLY  damn  special  for  all  you
headbangers out there. This  issue  is  HUGE,  over  1500  lines  of  news,
comments, lyrix of course! and a special surprise too!

Well people, finally, after  many  weeks  of  searching,  asking  and  then
downright begging for it. It looks like we are  finally  gonna  be  getting
the long awaited LISTSERV!!! ...  it  was  fortunate  that  I  came  across
someone from Toronto in Cyberspace,  and  he  said  that  his  site  has  a
LISTSERV, and that the sysadmin would very likely be willing to take me on.
Well, I mailed the guy, and he thought the 'zine was really  cool,  and  he
said "Sure! I'll give you a list", but the only thing is that  he's  moving
his system somewhere, and it'll be a little  while  'til  he's  ready,  but
don't worry guys! The day WILL come at long last!!

I finally had time this week to search in  my  ULTIMATE  Usenet  list,  for
some newsgroups to post too, and I found about 19 more newsgroups  to  post
to. I won't start posting on them this week since this issue is  so  HUMO!,
but I will start with  issue  #11...  let's  hope  we  don't  get  TO  many
rejections. But it seems that my Usenet list ISN'T completely up  to  date,
so if you guys know of any other newsgroups that would be a good  place  to
post the 'zine too, PLEASE let me know...

Whoa! I went to another party last nite (hehehe.... I bet you guys are  ALL
ears now!)... it was amazing!!! Fucking wicked I'm telling you.  It  wasn't
ruined this time by  anyone  putting  their  head  through  a  window,  but
something's still got broken... holy shit, the beer was flying  freely,  we
got some of that new Red Dog beer, it's pretty shit,  but  fuck,  I  didn't
notice at all I was so pissed!... We had about 2:1 girls to guys there, and
I'm telling, things got a  little  outta  hand  (all  the  better  for  me!
hehehe)... I don't know if I can show my face in school on  Tuesday..  it's
gonna be a little embarrassing, but OH WELL! Sorry  if  I'm  offending  any
women out there, but I just can't lie! (I'm an angel, really  ;-]  Anyways,
I'm still alive, and that's what really counts now doesn't it!  Lucky  some
people were still sober there, or things would  have  REALLY  gotten  crazy
pretty fast....

Alright people, enjoy this week's  MEGA  ISSUE.  I've  jammed  packed  this
fucker with 20 songs, plus a couple more goodies,  I'm  sure  you  guy's'll
enjoy it... the last four songs are reader submissions, and  the  rest  are
"Editor's Choice"....  I  wanna  say  thanks  to  Hellcrusher  for  putting
together the story on Burzum's "The Count", good job!  Oh  yeah,  one  last
thing, if some of your mail handler's out there couldn't process this  mail
'cause it was too long, just give me a yell, and I'll  chop  up  this  file
into as many bloody chunks as you want!

Subject: Loud Lyrix #1-#6

FINALLY got round to read LL from #1 onwards last night.
Definitely some good stuff here.

Loud Lyrix #2
-------------
I haven't bought Master of Puppets yet - its on the cards, my birthday's on
the 1st of June. MoP is about coke, yeah? There's only 1 line  to  give  it
away about breakfast on a mirror so is that a good guess?

[You got it John! Master of  Puppets  is  about  drug  pushers,  and  their
addicts -- Editor]

New addition to the lyrix - date of release.
Loved TIME - sounds just like me.

Loud Lyrix #3
-------------
Wow - X-Ray Spex! That brings back  memories  of  mid-teens  and  the  punk
movement which I really missed the boat  with.  Too  young  to  really  get
involved but then few people REALLY did. Most punks were weekenders anyway.

Loved Cemetary Gates.

They play Sepultura a lot on the Rock Show (a programme of a  few  hours  a
week on national radio 1). Definitely a band to support, especially  if  it
helps get their message across.

Loud Lyrix #4
-------------
I love the changing logos.

Oh, you're Canadian - at last info on the man himself is creeping out.

[Am I really that much of a mystery  to  all  you  guys?  Well,  if  that's
really the case, I've decided to include a little bio  on  myself  in  this
Mega Issue! Not that I'm an ego-maniac or anything :) -- Editor]

Toronto, isn't that where "The New Music" TV program hails from? Used to write
to a guy in Toronto who did C&W music but he got too busy and I lost  touch
with him.

Do you have all the Nirvana lyrics on file? The LP I have didn't come  with
them and I can't make out all the words. It  was  embarrassing  at  Reading
Rock 1992 not being able to sing along with the 1000s of other  people  who
somehow DID know all the lyrics.

Fade to black - great lyric. What are these guys on?!?

Loud Lyrix #5
-------------
Wristbands to queue for tickets?  Interesting  idea  to  beat  credit  card
phone-ins, eh?

I used to walk to work (before I got my bike) listening to Metallica on  my
personal stereo and reading Cthulhu mythos paperbacks. Let me tell  you  on
dark winter evenings this is a spooky combination.

Institutionalized - good read, good lyric; thought-provoking.

Loud Lyrix #6
-------------
I'll be 30 next month and I'm buying a house this week. God, I hate getting
old.

Non-lyric stuff - I'll trawl the  Microsoft-internal  boards  for  anything
useful. I think I'm getting immune to songs about ecology or  human  rights
or whatever. I just think, hey, people are LIKE that;  there'll  always  be
idiots and bastards who make a mess of things for everybody.

Enjoyed "I have seen the future" - sounds true!

More to follow!

[I definitely hope so! You guys have really been lazy about  commenting  on
some songs... come on guys! Do I have to pester you forever! -- Editor]

                             aka Gino Filicetti
                             

Well, it seemed to me that'd it'd be a good idea if I would write a  little
about myself, that way, you guys  out  there  wouldn't  be  wondering  what
kind of person I'm really like... but, some of you probably won't  want  to
know anything about my awesome life, so just skip this  section  and  check
out the rest of our 10th Weekiversary Mega Loud Lyrix!

It was a cold stormy day on  that  memorable  Jan  6th  in  1977  that  the
Editor of Loud Lyrix was born. The exact place was York-Finch  Hospital  in
Toronto, Ontario, Canada. To my mother was begotten a brown  haired,  brown
eyed bundle of love! :) hehehe... Anyways, my parents are Italian, born  in
Italy, my father from Calabria, my mother from Molize, they came to  Canada
in their early twenties, and got married in 1968. Currently my father is 58
and my mother is 47. I myself am  an  energetic  17  years  old!  Well,  my
childhood was as normal as anyone's, I had good parents, and  a  good  home
and I regret nothing.  As  I  remember  it,  my  first  exposure  to  God's
wonderful gift to the earth, Heavy Metal, was when I was about 3 years old,
it was my old cousin, who was a teen back then. He used to blast  Kiss  all
day long, and his room was plastered with all kinds of posters, so that not
a speck of the wall was visible. So Kiss is like the first band that I ever
liked. And my story with Kiss doesn't end there, my brother, Sergio, 21, is
also a Kiss freak. I know almost all the words  to  every  Kiss  song  ever
made, and not cause I listened to 'em, but because my brother  always  did.
Well, the first album that was mine, and only mine was 1984 by Van Halen, I
was 6 at the time, and I was crazy for those dudes. Then I remember getting
Twisted Sister's "Stay Hungary",  a  totally  righteous  album  for  sure..
anyways, after that, I wasn't really INTO Heavy Metal with all my heart and
soul like now, I was sort of a drifter, a mixer what ever  you  wanna  call
it. It wasn't until Grade 8 that I dropped every  other  form  of  mediocre
musik, and dedicated myself to the one true and great genre in  the  world.
HEAVY METAL!! At this time, I was  listening  to  sort  of  soft  bands  as
compared to what I listen to now. Bands like AC/DC, Van  Halen,  Rush,  Led
Zeppelin. As time went on, I started getting  heavier  and  heavier  in  my
musical tastes, I started  listening  to  the  likes  of  Metallica,  Ozzy,
Sabbath. And I just keeped going.. to where I am now, my main  interest  is
in Thrash Metal, I like it the best, but I do listen to my share  of  Death
Metal (especially Sepultura), Classic Metal, SOME Grunge, the heavier side,
but not to much of that, I REALLY detest the whole Seattle  scene  bullshit
that has emerged in the last couple of years... most of these  fuckers  are
nothing more than cash grabs, and poseurs... I like bands like  Soundgarden
and Alice in Chains mostly... here is my list of favorite bands:

1. Black Sabbath (no one can put down the fathers of metal)
2. Slayer (absolutely the best band around today, true non poseurs)
3. Metallica
4. Sepultura
5. Judas Priest
6. White Zombie
7. Anthrax
8. Pantera
9. King Diamond
10. Megadeth

Now for some non music stuff, hmmm.. let's see, I love sports, I guess  you
could say I'm pretty athletic,  although  I'm  not  on  any  sports  teams,
that's only 'cause our  skule  is  pure  cheese  in  the  sports  dept.  My
favorite sport is HOCKEY OF COURSE! The Maple Leafs are gonna take the  cup
this year for sure!! What a party, can't wait to go down to Yonge St.!!   I
pump weights too, it's the best thing you can do to keep  in  shape,  hands
down... I've been doing 'em Mon, Wed, Fri every week since Oct  11,  and  I
gotta admit, it's  the  best,  really  does  work.  My  favorite  movie  is
Goodfellas, heehe.. gotta love those mob movies, umm... oh yeah, of course,
I'm  totally  into  computers..  I  program  in   QuickBASIC,   I've   been
Internetting for the past 3 months (and I already have  a  'zine,  weird!),
the Internet rulez... nothing like  it....  and  well,  that's  about  it!!
Pretty long, but if you've read this far, I hope you ain't disappointed,  I
tried my best....

Later everyone!

******************  U P D A T E   F R O M   N O R W A Y  ********************
                       "The Count" gets his sentence!


N e w s : O.K. here's some stuff about the murder on Euronymous. During the
summer of 1993, the relationship between the  "Count"  and  Euronymous  had
cooled down a lot. I think Euronymous was pretty tired  of  that  Grischnack
were acting like a clown in media. In Norway Grischnack had been a big joke
until he killed Euronymous.

The "Count" on the other hand didn't like Euronymous' communist thoughts. In
an interview the "Count" has said that "Euronymous joined  the  communists
to be evil, and get more niggers into Norway". The "Count" really  disliked
this  opinion  among  several  more.  In  interviews  around,  the  "Count"
distanced  himself  from  Euronymous.  Other  things  are  that  Euronymous
threatened to refuse to give out some Burzum records on his record company.

One of the accused in the case characterizes Euronymous'  attitude  to  the
"Count" as "aggressive, critical and negative".  When  this  man  told  the
"Count" about Euronymous' attitude, the "Count"  bursted  out:  "Euronymous
must go. He stands in the way of my economical prospects!" 

Later that night the "Count" spoke a lot about killing  Euronymous.  With  a
second fellow they discussed several ways to kill him. One suggestion  were
to chop his head off with an axe when he  opened  the  door(!).  The  first
fellow meant that it would look silly to carry an axe in the neighborhood.
An other alternative was to make Euronymous show something on his  PC,  and
then stab him in his back with a knife.

On Monday, August the 9th, the  three  men  hired  three  videofilms  which
they'd all seen before. If the cops later would ask about the  films,  they
would have an alibi. The second fellow were  left  behind  in  Bergen.  The
meaning was that he should use the "Count's" credit card while he was  gone.
This would make another alibi. The thing was  that  this  fellow  took  the
wrong card. He took a telephone card instead...

The "Count" meant  that  it  would  look  suspicious  if  two  Black  Metal
Satanists  should  drive  from  Oslo  right  after  a  Satanist-leader  was
killed(The distance between Oslo and Bergen is about 60 Norwegian miles, or
a 7 hour long trip). The first fellow lent a white sweater  to  the  second
one, to look less satanic. The first fellow were alledgedly ordered  to  be
the driver. During long parts of the trip, the "Count"  was  lying  in  the
backseat. In fact, when they came to a smalltown and wanted  to  fill  some
gas, he was also in the trunk. When  they  entered  Euronymous'  apartment,
only the "Count" went inside. Later, when his fellow came inside, he  heard
a lot of screaming. According to the "Count", this  provoked  him  as  Hell,
when Euronymous was screaming. Later he said that it  was  less  honorable
for a Black Metal leader to die in his underwear. 

Well I could probably write down a lot more  here,  but  it  is  difficult,
since none of the witnesses says the same thing.

Anyway the result is that the "Count" gets 21 years, the  longest  sentence
anyone can get in Norway. But he can appeal, and I can't see why  not.  His
idiotic lawyer tried to label him as "insane", so that he  could  get  less
years in prison. I would rather spend 21 years in prison, than  be  labeled
as insane the rest of my life!

His (ex)fellow, which drove the car to Oslo, got 8 years. This is more than
they had hoped for. The "Count's" face bursted out in a big smile  when  he
heard the sentence. 

Though I don't agree with the "Count" in everything, I think  that  he  has
more honour left than anyone else in this case. The ex-fellow's lawyer were
moaning about that he was allergic and depressed and was easily  influenced
by the "Count". I think THAT is weak!

Chapter 7, "The Eye", by King Diamond

*******************  B E H I N D   T H E S E   W A L L S  ******************


Walking in the garden, picking flowers in the sun
Madeleine is on her own
She can't see any of the other nuns
Is she blind or is it her mind
What's going on? What's going on behind these walls...

All the birds are singing, but Madeleine can't hear their song
Memories of screams in the night
Moaning coming from below where the prison cells are cold
She does not understand what's going on

Now the bell is ringing, communion time has come again
Is Father Picard really a friend?
The bible in her hand reminds her of the wine
The sour tasting blood of Christ
What's going on? What's going on behind these walls...

What's going on? Behind these walls...

Chapter 8, "The Eye", by King Diamond

************************  T H E   M E E T I N G S  **************************


The night is black
7 figures walk the streets of Louviers
Picard is one, another two are priests
And then the nuns, going to

The meetings held in secrecy
Evil company full of secrecy, again and again

The room is dark
Candles on the wall, they've been here before
The Christian cross is hanging high above
The altar of God

Madeleine is at the gate
Hazy feeling in her brain
As the strangers come in to

The meetings held in secrecy
Evil company full of secrecy, again and again

The strangers brought
The sweetest little child, but something's wrong
The baby cries, someone here will die
And now the nuns pray

The meetings held in secrecy
Evil company full of secrecy, again and again

Madeleine and the other nuns
They hold the infant up to the cross
As father Picard and the priests
Approach with hammers and nails
There's no more to tell

[This is a wicked song! I remember reading soooo much shit on this song  by
those fucking Evangelist assholes  about  how  evil  and  runchy  it  is...
here's an excerpt: 
"Rock music has changed. The consensual fornication of a generation ago has
been replaced by forcing oral sex at gunpoint  ("Eat  Me  Alive"  by  Judas
Priest), masterbation ("I F... Like a Beast" by W.A.S.P., ie We are  Sexual
Perverts), and rebellion ("We're Not Gonna Take  It"  by  Twisted  Sister".
Hehehehe... fucking funny eh? .. ah well, these losers are sooo  lost  it's
not funny, they know nothing about being a real Christian -- Editor]

                       Album: "Defenders of the Faith"


Wrapped tight around me
Like a second flesh hot skin
Cling to my body
As the ecstasy begins

Your wild vibrations
Got me shooting from the hip
Crazed and insatiable let rip

Eat me alive

Sounds like an animal
Panting to the beat
Groan in the pleasure zone
Gasping from the heat

Gut-wrenching frenzy
That deranges every joint
I'm gonna force you at gun point

To eat me alive

Bound to deliver as
You give and I collect
Squealing impassioned as
The rod of steel injects

Lunge to the maximum
Spread-eagled to the wall
You're well equipped to take it all

So eat me alive

Revolution in their minds - the children start to march
Against the world in which they have to live
and all the hate that's in their hearts
They're tired of being pushed around
and told just what to do
They'll fight the world until they've won
and love comes flowing through

Children of tomorrow live in the tears that fall today
Will the sun rise up tomorrow bringing peace in any way?
Must the world live in the shadow of atomic fear?
Can they win the fight for peace or will they disappear?

So you children of the world,
  listen to what I say
If you want a better place to live in
  spread the words today
Show the world that love is still alive
  you must be brave
Or you children of today are
  Children of the Grave, Yeah!

My Cheerios just ain't the same
I wish I had some goddamn milk

I'll just wait 'till Mommy buys more
I'll just have, wheat thins and beer
If I get sick the toilet is near

Razors edge
Outlines the dead
Incisions in my head
Anticipation the stimulation
To kill the exhilaration
 
(Chorus:)
(part 1)
Close your eyes
Look deep in your soul
Step outside yourself
And let your mind go
Frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die
 
(part 2)
Close your eyes
And forget your name
Step outside yourself
And let your thoughts drain
As you go insane... (go) insane
 
(this verse has changed place with verse 3)
Inert flesh
A bloody tomb
A decorated splatter brightens the room
An execution a sadist ritual
Mad intervals of mind residuals
 
Close your eyes
Look deep in your soul
Step outside yourself
And let your mind go
Frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die
 
Close your eyes... and forget your name
Step outside yourself... and let your thoughts drain
As you go insane... (go) insane
 
(this verse has changed place with verse 2)
Innate seed
To watch you bleed
A demanding physical need
Desecrated, eviscerated
Times prostrated (sings "perpetuated")

Well, I see you standin' there
with your finger in the air.
Ev'rything we do,
you wanna leave it up to you.

Who do you think you are?
You think you are a star,
try'n' to run the town,
always try'n' to put us down.

Well, you think that you're right.
You think you're out of sight.
Tell me something, mister;
why'd you have to make us so uptight?

Well, you say you've been try'n'.
You know that you're ly'n'.
I think you need some groovin'.
Who do you think you're foolin' now?

Well, you better start changin'.
You life needs rearrangin'.
You better do some talkin'
or you better do some walkin' now.

Yeah, you think that you're right.
You think you're out of sight.
Tell me something, mister;
why'd you have to make us so uptight?

I know what you're doing,
all that you been doin' wrong.
I don't know what you're feelin',
oh, but you been feelin' long.

Well, you think that you're right.
Tell me something, mister;
Why'd you have to make us so uptight?

She walks by moonlight
No one really knows
Enchanted starlight
Never goin' home

I know she's goin' down, goin'
Everybody knows she's so good

Doin' well for others
She doesn't really know
The powers are within her
As she takes off her clothes

I know she's goin' down, goin'
Everybody knows she's so good

Doin' well for others
She doesn't really know
The powers are within her
As she takes off her clothes

I know she's goin' down, goin'
Everybody knows she's so good

Whiskey woman
Don't you know that you
Are drivin' me insane
The liquor you give
Stems your will to live
And gets right to my brain

You're tryin' to find your way thro' life
You're tryin' to get some new direction
Another woman got her man
But she won't find no new connection
Takes another drink or two
Things look better when she's thro'

Takes another look around
You're not goin' anywhere
You've realized you're gettin' old
And no one seems to care

You're tryin' to find your way again
You're tryin' to find some new
Another woman got her man
But she won't find no new
Takes another drink or two
Things look better when she's thro'.

You've been foolin' with some hot guy
I want to know why is it why
Get up get out you know you really blew it
I've had enough I've had enough
Good God pluck me

Once she was wonderful
Once she was fine
Once she was beautiful
Once she was mine

Now change has come over her body
She doesn't see me anymore
Change has come over her body
She doesn't see me anymore

Changes
Changes
Victim of changes

                      Album: "The Number of the Beast"


"Woe to you, Oh Earth and Sea, for the Devil sends the beast
with wrath, because he knows the time is short...
Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast
for it is a human number, its number is Six hundred and sixty
six." -- Revelations 13:18

I left alone my mind was blank
I needed time to get the memories from my mind

What did I see can I believe that what I saw
that night was real and not just fantasy

Just what I saw in my old dreams were they
reflections of my warped mind staring back at me

Cos in my dreams it's always there the evil face that twists my mind
and brings me to despair

The night was black was no use holding back
Cos I just had to see was someone watching me
In the mist dark figures move and twist
was all this for real or some kind of hell
666 the Number of the Beast
Hell and fire was spawned to be released

Torches blazed and sacred chants were praised
as they start to cry hands held to the sky
In the night the fires burning bright
the ritual has begun Satan's work is done
666 the Number of the Beast
Sacrifice is going on tonight

This can't go on I must inform the law
Can this still be real or some crazy dream
but I feel drawn towards the evil chanting hordes
they seem to mesmerize me...can't avoid their eyes
666 the Number of the Beast
666 the one for you and me

I'm coming back I will return
And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn
I have the fire I have the force
I have the power to make my evil take its course

Crazy, but that's how it goes
Millions of people living as foes
Maybe it's not too late
To learn how to love
And forget how to hate
Mental wounds not healing
Life's a bitter shame
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I've listened to preachers
I've listened to fools
I've watched all the dropouts
Who make their own rules
One person conditioned to rule and control
The media sells it and you live the role
Mental wounds still screaming
Driving me insane
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I know that things are going wrong for me
You gotta listen to my words
Yeh-h
Heirs of a cold war
That's what we've become
Inheriting troubles I'm mentally numb
Crazy, I just cannot bear
I'm living with something that just isn't fair
Mental wounds not healing
Who and what's to blame
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train

Fifteen years in the academy,
He was like no cadet they'd ever seen.
A man so hard, his veins bleed ice,
And when he speaks he never says if twice.
They call him Judge, his last name is Dredd,
So break the law, and you wind up dead.
Truth and justice are what he's fighting for,
Judge Dredd the man, he is the law.
 
With gun and bike he rules the streets,
And every perp he meets will taste defeat.
Not even Death can overcome his might,
Cause Dredd and Anderson, they won the fight.
When the Sov's started the Apocalypse war,
Mega-City was bombed to the floor.
Dredd resisted, and the judges fought back,
Crushed the Sov's with their counter-attack.
 
*Pre-Chorus*:
  Respect the badge - he earned it with his blood.
  Fear the gun - your sentence may be death because...
*Chorus*:
  I AM THE LAW!
  And you won't fuck around no more - I AM THE LAW!
  I judge the rich, I judge the poor - I AM THE LAW!
  Commit a crime I'll lock the door - I AM THE LAW!
  Because in Mega-City... I AM THE LAW!
 
In the cursed earth where mutants dwell,
There is no law, just a living hell.
Anarchy and chaos as the blood runs red,
But this would change if it was up to Dredd.
The book of law is the bible to him,
And any crime committed is a sin.
He keeps the peace with his law-giver,
Judge, jury, and executioner.
DROKK IT!
 
*Pre-Chorus*
*Chorus*
 
CRIME - The ultimate sin,
Your iso-Cube is waiting when he brings you in.
LAW - It's what he stands for,
Crime's his only enemy and he's going to war!
 
CRIME - The ultimate sin,
Your iso-Cube is waiting when he brings you in.
LAW - It's what he stands for,
Crime's his only enemy and he's going to war!

[Hey! There is something on this song too, from that same file  I  got  the
"Eat Me Alive"... umm.. "critizism"! .. check it out.

"Perhaps even more dangerous than these deviant sexual themes are  Satanism
("Altar of Sacrifice" by Slayer, "Possessed" by Venom, "The Number  of  the
Beast" by Iron Maiden, "Disciples of Hell" by Malsteen, "Burn in  Hell"  by
Twisted Sister), murder ("I kill children" by the  Dead  Kennedys,  "Bodily
Dismemberment" by Rigor Mortis, "Kill for Pleasure" by  Blood  Feast),  and
suicide ("Don't Fear  the  Reaper"   by   Blue   Oyster   Cult,   "Suicidal
Failure" by Suicidal  Tendencies,  "Killing  Yourself  to  Live"  by  Black
Sabbath, "Fly to  the  Rainbow"  by  the  Scorpians,  "Fade  to  Black"  by
Metallica). The examples are only the  tip  of  the  iceberg."  Isn't  this

Father forgive me for I know not what I do
I tried everything, now I'll leave it up to you
I don't wanna live, I don't know why
I don't have no reasons, I just want to die
 
I'm a suicidal failure, I gotta have some help
I have suicidal tendencies, but I can't kill myself
 
Tired of this way of life, my patience has expired
I'm barely just 19, but my life I will retire
I went down to a rifle store, I bought myself a gun
I pointed it at my head, but I couldn't get the job done
 
I'm a suicidal failure, I gotta have some help
I have suicidal tendencies, but I can't kill myself
 
I took all my mothers sleeping pills
I jumped off a freeway bridge
I drank three kinds of poison
And drove my car off a ridge
I beat myself with a bat
Put a noose around my head
I've overdosed on heroin
But I'm still not dead
 
I'm a suicidal failure, I gotta have some help
I have suicidal tendencies, but I can't kill myself
 
Death may not be the answer, it can't be all that great
But me I'm not into living, with life I can't relate
By some masochistic reasoning, I think it will  be fun
I want to start my second life now
So shoot me with your gun

Welcome to my world
Involve yourself within my dream
Experience a life
Just like your mind thought not to be
Take a look through time
At past or present worlds to be
I rule this inferno
Enthroned for eternity
 
Coils of the serpent unwind
Buried beneath you will find
Deep in the halls of the damned
Spirit in black till the journey's (doesn't sing that) end
 
Spirits damned to rot
Amidst the brimstone fireballs
Eyes of the dead
Watching from their living walls (sings "hall"?)
Broken glass reflections
Show your flesh eaten away
Beyond the gates I'll take you
Where the blood forever rains
 
Coils of the serpent unwind
Buried beneath you will find
Deep in the halls of the damned
Spirit in black till the journey's (doesn't sing that) end
 
Afterlife confession
Tell me who you used to be
Looking on in wonder
As I show you it was me
Burning from within
You know one spark is all it takes
Hear the piercing cries of all
Who found that hell awaits
 
Living nightmare can't you see
You really have no choice
Faded memories haunt you
Listen closely to my voice
Feed me all your hatred
Empty all your thoughts to me
I can fill your emptiness
With immortality
 
Welcome to my world
Involve yourself within my dream
Experience a life
Just like your mind thought not to be
Take a look through time
At past or present worlds to be
I rule this inferno
Enthroned for eternity

Oh yeah!

Some people say my love cannot be true
please believe me, my love, and I'll show you
I will give you those things you thought unreal
The sun, the moon, the stars all bear my seal

Oh yeah!

Follow me now and you will not regret
leaving the life you led before we met
You are the first to have this love of mine
forever with me 'till the end of time

  Your love for me has just got to be real
  before you know the way I'm going to feel
  I'm going to feel
  I'm going to feel

Oh yeah!

Now I have you with me, under my power
Our love grows stronger now with every hour
Look into my eyes, you will see who I am
my name is Lucifer, please take my hand

Mankind,
The public enemy's not the man who speaks his mind
The public enemy's the man that goes and acts blind
Searching for an answer that he'll never find
An action from reaction and you can't make a retraction
Once you've put your head out
And then you're blue in the face,
As you try to state your case
You can think with your dick but it can't shout
Yo.
I try to understand what the hell is going on
I can't imagine how things ever got so far gone
You separatists, say you want your own state
I'll give them a state, a state of unconsciousness
Retribution, no solution, constitution
Discrimination, through the nation, raining hatred
I yell, when there's schism you must rebel
I yell, so you'll hear
I yell, i refuse to live in your hell
I am what you fear
I'm the truth, i don't keep it in the family
Live your life, take someone else
Keep it in the family
The real world's outside your door
You can't keep it in the family
You've got the longest way to fall
Keep it in the, keep it in the, keep it in the
Family
Don't even try to tell me what you think is right
When to you blacks are niggers, and jews are kikes
And you expect to be taken seriously
But your actions, they're more than curiously.
Juvenile, you emulate what you hate
And you don't even know why you feel this way
'cause daddy hated this, and mommy hated that
And your own ability to reason's like a tire gone flat
Yo.
I try to understand what the hell is going on
I can't imagine how things ever got so far gone
You separatists, say you want your own state
I'll give them a state, a state of unconsciousness
Retribution, no solution, constitution
Discrimination, through the nation, raining hatred
I yell, when there's schism you must rebel
I yell, so you'll hear
I yell, i refuse to live in your hell
I am what you fear
I'm the truth, i don't keep it in the family
Live your life, take someone else
Keep it in the family
The real world's outside your door
You can't keep it in the family
You've got the longest way to fall
When you keep it in the, when you keep it in the
When you keep it in the family
When you keep it in the, when you keep it in the
When you keep it in the family
Acting out of pure cold hatred
'cause of what another's race is
Color of another's face is
Different, and your own frustrations
Taking on a violent nature
Full of hate, so full of hate
You'd kill a man is that your fate
Your street becomes a police state
Why the hell do you hate?!
Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Hate, hate!!!
I'm not gonna stand for it
Someone's gonna pay for it
I yell, we rebel
We're the truth and we won't keep it in the family
Live your life, take someone else
Keep it in the family
The real world's outside your door
You can't keep it in the family
You've got the longest way to fall
Keep it in the family
I'm the thing that you most fear
I don't keep it in the family
I am the truth you won't hear
Keep it in the family
The real world's outside your door
You can't keep it in the family
You've got the longest way to fall
Keep it in the family

If you feel alive
In a darkened room
Do you know the name
Of your solitude
If you ain't got the answer
If you don't know the truth
If you want the power
Then let it flow through
 
Would you let it go
Would you let it go
They cannot end this mourning
                of my life
Show me
How the gods kill

If you feel alive
If you got no fear
Do you know the name
Of the one you seek
If you want the answer
If you want the truth
Look inside your empty soul
There
You'll find the noose
 
Would you let it go
Would you let it go
They cannot end this mourning
                of my life
Show me

How must we move ourselves,
with what violence must we,
the new gods of the culverts, po-go our dance
for leaving to bow the new century?
In what language, with which screams,
will we, the sons of Cain,
have to pronounce the anarchy of the beast?
With what blood will we have to paint the walls
of the ancient and decadent empire?
What boots should we use for trampling the old fossils?
What trinkets should we use for the feast?...

[Night is dressing a lukewarm and lustrous skin like the black leathers
& the stars shine like ironworks over its surface...
Today its streets own a name -a word-
that only we could pronounce...
Let's get out to seek the word
that knocks to pieces the glasses of the system...
Horoscopes are tracing new constellations
that point out the Pluto step by the ascendants of the era... 
...REVOLUTION!]

With what furor and in what rythm
will we, the new angels of the extermination,
have to finger the hexachords of steel?
How much shampoo, how many musical phrases, how much acid 
will we need for dissolving
so many fuckin' <<caspa>> [dandruff]?...

...HEAVY METAL: music for the head!
solos of guitar that devour the core of our soft viscera...
Molybdenum clefs in the way of the staff 
of the great culture
broken riders leaned against blinded walls & tearing away screams
that pronounce knives against the world's jugular...

>From the Veins of a Nearly Dead Boy
Once There Was Hatred
Once There Was Cold
Now
There is Only
A Dark Stone Tomb
With an Altar
An Altar which
Serves as a Bed
A Bed of Eternal Sleep
The Dreams of the Human in Sleep
Are Dreams of Relief
A Gate out of Hell
Into the Void of Death
Yet Undisturbed
The Human Sleep
And One Day
Will the Grave Be Unlocked
And the Soul
Must Return to His World
But This Time as 
A Lost Forgotten Sad Spirit
Doomed
To Haunt
Endlessly
