Well everyone.... how's it hangin' ? This is been a pretty  cool  week  for
me, I had like absolutely no HW at  all,  and  that  is  always  a  relief!
Saturday I went to a wicked awesome party...  what  a  bash,  everyone  was
hammered to hell, headbanging to whatever  the  hell  was  on  the  fucking
radio, I can't even remember if it was the New Kids or what!  :-)  ...  too
bad it was an apartment, we got the  neighbors  mad,  and  one  called  the
cops, that's when we all shit our pants... and dumped all the drinks,  (for
those who don't know, you awesome Editor here is a 17  year  old  'banger),
but the cops  never  crashed  the  party,  we  just  calmed  down  and  the
neighbors were happy. Then a friend of  mine  totally  ruined  the  fucking
party... he went mental destroying things, it took four of us to  hold  him
down... fucking asshole, I'm gonna give him his shots at  school  tomorrow,
(it's Sunday right now), anyways... he was so fucked, he  friggin'  smashed
his head through a window!! Lucky nothing happened to him... shit,  what  a
party.... it was so good 'til he flipped out and scared all the girls... 

Anyways... I don't mean to bore you with my teenage tales... I just  wanted
to write it down... anyways... thanks go out to a cyber pal of  mine,  Kain
<kain@io.org>, for sending in all the parodies that appear in  this  week's
Loud Lyrix...

We are STILL fucking looking for a LISTSERV!!! I guess it's useless to  ask
you guys anymore... I'm just wasting space... anyways..  I'll  get  off  my
lazy butt one day, and mass post to listserv owners  and  beg  them  for  a
spot.

C'mon guyz! You can't tell me that none of you are on Usenet out there!  So
where are all the newsgroups I asked you all to find for me... I  need  you
all to find some newsgroups for me to regularly post  the  'zine  to,  make
sure that they won't be flaming me for posting it...  choose  related  ones
pleez! ... c'mon, get cracking.

Well, you guys are pretty sad you know! I am getting absolutely NO  readers
responses to any songs I post!  You guys are  frustrating  me,  so  I  said
"Fuck it!" I won't bug you no more about this shit, if you  wanna  send  in
anything, just do it... I'll print it for sure...

I've also gotten requests from a couple of  people  to  expand  the  mag  a
little bit, with interviews, reviews, and concert dates and shit. So I  was
thinking, COOL! I'd be willing to do it for you guys, but I can't do it  by
myself at all... I could review some new albums, and SOME concerts,  but  I
ain't too good at writing reviews. However, I'll bet there  are  more  than
one of you out there that CAN write this stuff.. so, if there  is  anything
you wanna see in the 'zine... any CONCERT  DATES,  INTERVIEWS  OR  REVIEWS,
just send 'em to me, and I'll print 'em up.... but  remember,  I  can't  do
this by myself, if you want it to happen, ya gotta help, or  else  I  might
forget about this.

Ok dudes... have a good seven days...  don't  put  your  head  through  any
windows, hehehehe... have fun as always, and keep the songs coming!

Chapter 3, "The Eye", by King Diamond

**********************************  B U R N  ********************************


The Inquisition will take her to the hill
Ready for the kill, giving GOD his will
Everybody's there, none of them will care
Not a single prayer

Burn in the night, You're the devil's child
Burn in the night, You're the devil's child

Looking at the sky, soon the girl will die
Nobody will cry, hear her screaming "why?!"
The priests are all in line, now they give the sign
Let the fire shine!

Burn in the night, You're the devil's child
Burn in the night, You're the devil's child

They say the devil is here tonight
Then let him play his violin so wild

Higher, burning higher, flames will soon devour
Higher, burning higher, the smell of skin turned sour

Higher, burning higher, her legs are scorched by fire
Ashes to ashes, I see a smile on their wicked faces

Burn in the night, You're the devil's child
Burn in the night, You're the devil's child

Lightning from the sky, magic's coming by
As her necklace flies right into her eye
The priests are all in line, now they give the sign
Let the fire die

Burned in the night, there are no remains
Burned in the night, just a magic chain

Under the lights where we stand tall
Nobody touches us at all
Showdown, shootout, spread fear within, without
We're gonna take what's ours to have
Spread the word throughout the land
They say the bad guys wear black
We're tagged and can't turn back

You see us comin'
And you all together run for cover
We're takin over this town

Here we come reach for your gun
And you better listen my friend, you see
It's been slow down below,
Aimed at you we're the cowboys from hell
Deed is done again, we've won
Ain't talking no tall tales friend
'Cause high noon, your doom
Comin' for you we're the cowboys from hell

Pillage the village, trash the scene
But better not take it out on me
'Cause a ghost town is found
Where your city used to be
So out of the darkness and into the light
Sparks fly everywhere in sight
>From my double barrel, 12 gauge,
Can't lock me in your cage


You see us comin'
And you all together run for cover
We're takin over this town

Here we come reach for your gun
And you better listen my friend, you see
It's been slow down below,
Aimed at you we're the cowboys from hell
Deed is done again, we've won
Ain't talking no tall tales friend
'Cause high noon, your doom
Comin' for you we're the cowboys from hell

                         Album: "Handle With Care"


The bio-sphere, the place we live
It seems like we don't give a damn
Other species flushed down the tubes
We need another race to rape
The way we live, we will destroy
Every other living thing
Till none are left except our race
And then we will destroy ourselves

Another oil spill
Atomic waste displaced
Another forest dies

Bring on the acid rain
Slightly insane, the type of greed
That makes a world unfit for life
Toxic wastes destroy our seas
While poison gas pollutes the air
A waste of life, while no one cares
The earth becomes a giant tomb
Critical mass will be achieved
And ruins will be all that's left

Another oil spill
Atomic waste displaced
Another forest dies

*groovy solo*

A hell on earth, what we create
Dragging life to death with us
All living things destroyed or used
By shortsighted human beings
We do these things, let them be done
Apathy creates despair
The damage done will be too great
The world wounded beyond repair

Another oil spill
Atomic waste displaced
Another forest dies

[Hello! I thought that I  could  contribute  with  a  lyric  by  Venom.  As
everybody should know Venom were the true inventors of Black Metal,  Thrash
Metal and Death  Metal.  Here's  the  song(!)  "Die  Hard"  It's  among  my

Satan, Father
Help me from this grave
Demons, warriors
Ever be my slaves
I can't reason with men and mortal fools
They won't die hard, hear the Golden Rule
      Die Hard - Legions iron and steel
      Die Hard - Men of war revealed
      Die Hard - Captors of the brave

Sinner, liar
Guard your Crown of Thorns
Priestess, Parson
Live your lives of scorn
I can raise the fires of Hell and blasphemy
We can grow strong, Satanic Royalty
      Die Hard

Evil Angels
Vultures of the night
Ride the wings of Hades' death is on our side
Burn the furnace bright, we ain't getting tired.
      Die Hard

Let's skate!

Seemed like such an innocent toy
He was the All-American boy
Got a skate at eight years old
Now the story can be told

Beware he's Possessed to Skate!

Skating takes him up in height
He's a pilot on a modern flight
See him flying through the air
I he don't land then he don't care

Chorus:
Cause he rips-he rips
When he skates-he skates
Cause he never hesitates
He's a wizard on the wheels
Like a modern gladiator ain't got no fears
So skate

He shoots the pool like a launching pad
If it ain't insane than you can't get rad
Skating is all that's on his mind
He's skating radical all the time

Chorus
Beware he's Possessed to Skate!

Looks like a magic carpet ride
Six foot aerials inverts backside
Optical illusion it must be
He redefines insanity

Chorus
Doesn't understand why you'd wanna walk
Ain't got no time to sit and talk
Used to be just like you and me
Now he's an outcast of society

Beware he's Possessed to Skate!

And the skating's getting radical

                           Album: "Show No Mercy"


Blasting our way through the boundaries of Hell
No one can stop us tonight
We take on the world with hatred inside
Mayhem the reason we fight
Surviving the slaughters and killing we've lost
Then we return from the dead
Attacking once more now with twice as much strength
We conquer then move on ahead

(Chorus:)
Evil
My words defy
Evil
Has no disguise
Evil
Will take your soul
Evil
My wrath unfolds

Satan our master in evil mayhem
Guides us with every first step
Our axes are growing with power and fury
Soon there'll be nothingness left
Midnight has come and the leathers strapped on
Evil is at our command
We clash with God's angel and conquer new souls
Consuming all that we can

(Chorus)

                         Album: "Fear Of The Dark"


          I am a man who walks alone
       And when I'm walking a dark road
    At night or strolling through the park

       When the light begins to change
      I sometimes feel a little strange
       A little anxious when it's dark

      Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
     I have constant fear that something's
                 always near
      Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
        I have a phobia that someone's
                always there

        Have you run your fingers down
                  the wall
    And have you felt your neck skin crawl
     When you're searching for the light?
         Sometimes when you're scared
               to take a look
          At the corner of the room
        You've sensed that something's
                watching you

       Have you ever been alone at night
      Thought you heard footsteps behind
     And turned around and no one's there?
        And as you quicken up your pace
        You find it hard to look again
         Because you're sure there's
                someone there

     Watching horror films the night before
        Debating witches and folklores
       The unknown troubles on your mind
       Maybe your mind is playing tricks
       You sense, and suddenly eyes fix
        On dancing shadows from behind

      Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
     I have constant fear that something's
                 always near
      Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
        I have a phobia that someone's
                always there

        When I'm walking a dark road
         I am a man who walks alone

Menstruation is a pain,
Chemical changes in your brain.
See the box of tampons,
And you know it's your last one.
Better grab the dishrag,
Before the blood drips down your leg.
It's already past your knee,
By your toes, under your feet.

Tampax is pettal soft,
Cardboard can rub you raw.
Refuse to use a pad,
Causes leaks and diaper rash.
Just stained my new panties,
Wash 'em in new Tide with bleach.
If that won't clean them by dawn,
To the trash, they'll be gone.

No one but me can pull the string 'tween my legs.
Push it up there, way deep inside.

These cramps, it seems, have no point for existance.
Take three Advil, and tell the pain goodbye.
goodbye.

I want to be a rebel
I want to fit in
in the new-tech revolution
in the new scheme of things

I will read Mondo-2000
and Wired magazines,
I will join a hacker group
and be into that scene

CHORUS:

I have seen the future
It is computers and french fries,
CD-ROMS, 3DO and cryptography
with a little mustard on the side

Crypto-hacker, Compu-rebel
Cyberpunk, yes, those are my names!
I am so bad..
I just can't believe myself

I am such a rebel
I write an electronic magazine..
I'll become so famous and quoted,
you're not gonna believe

CHORUS:

I have seen the future
It is computers and french fries,
Virtual Reality, 500 channels
with a little ketchup on the fly

I am so self assured,
well read and full of grace
that I have the need to wave
my degrees in your face!

I am such an anarchist
the government is after me..
for opposing Clipper
and drinking Chinese tea

CHORUS:

I have seen the future
It is Computers and french fries,
MUDS, Raves and Cyber-Sex
with a little KY-jelly on the side

A philantropist, a writer,
glorified and interviewed
worship me now, before
Uncle Sam gets you fooled

And when I retire
I'll start a consulting firm
In a month I'll make more bucks
than you'll ever earn!

CHORUS:

I have seen the future
It is Computers and french fries,
Interactive TV and desktop video
with a some mayo on the fly
