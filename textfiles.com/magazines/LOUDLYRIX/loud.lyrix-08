Loud Lyrix, #8, 5/10/94
-----------------------

I'm back people, this week fortunately, I finished all  the  shitty  school
work I had a little early, so I had more time to work on the 'zine, I  hope
you guys like it better this week,  just  for  a  little  comparison,  last
week's issue took about 20 minutes to put together, this week's took  about
2 hours.

Ok, as you may have noticed, last week we  started  posting  the  'zine  to
newsgroups. I did post a little warning to each group telling 'em that Loud
Lyrix was about to invade them, and to tell me if they didn't want us  xtra
kewl 'bangers around... three newsgroups did indeed reject  us,  they  were
the HARDCORE,  INDUSTRIAL  and  ALTERNATIVE  groups...  well,  I  willingly
complied with their demands, and quietly exited. Not  that  I  really  care
about these groups, but I did receive some flames for the posting..  and  I
REALLY told 'em where to fucking go, flaming me like idiots.. God.. I mean,
what do these people want! I fucking went to the trouble  of  typing  up  a
warning, and I still get flamed... oh well, fuck 'em! I've  always  thought
that the fans of those  three  genre's  in  particular  are  usually  major
assholes.. I don't wanna offend anyone, 'cause I know we have a few of  you
in our ranks of readers, but most of these fans that I've had contact with,
have always hated metal for no reason in particular, or for some  dumb  ass
reason like.. "huh huh huh, how can you take guys in  lipstick  seriously?"
Fuck man.. that's what I really hate... these fuckers  are  just  so  outta
touch with modern Heavy Metal that it's not funny.. anyways..  to  all  you
industrialer's and alternative dudes that are reading this, I'm sorry,  but
just the plain fact that you are subscribed to Loud Lyrix proves  that  you
are beyond the level of these sub-humans...  thank  you  for  showing  some
intelligence.

Ok, enough of this nastiness... I have some good news  for  you  all.  Loud
Lyrix is now under consideration by the owner of a LISTSERV to be  included
on it. I was able to find a local Toronto site  for  us,  and  it'll  be  a
dream come true if we are indeed accepted... I hope that  we  are.  Anyways
if we do get on this LISTSERV, there may be chance  that  all  of  you  may
have to resubscribe to the 'zine, if there is any  other  possible  way  to
circumvent this situation, I will definitely try and find it, but  if  not,
I just wanna warn you  all  now,  but  don't  worry,  how  hard  is  it  to
subscribe to a LISTSERV?

All right people, I'm just about done talking, or typing as  the  situation
is, I just wanna tell you all to keep on the look up for some  good  Usenet
newsgroups for me to start posting to. I'll humor any suggestion,  as  long
as it's sane.. just check 'em out for me ok? 'Cause  I  don't  have  Usenet
access, and I only post the  'zine  using  the  Usenet-by-mail  service  at
decwrl.dec.com... Ok then guys.. here it is.. our longest Loud  Lyrix  ever
to make up for last week, clocking in at an unprecedented 713 lines!!

((Sorry about the delay this week, I don't know what the hell 
is wrong with my internet feed site, something is definately 
screwed up... I doubt you guyz will even get this issue!))

[Editor -- I just wanna say sorry for forgetting to include  a  Chapter  of
Kind Diamond's "The Eye"  last  week  in  the  'zine.  It  just  completely
slipped my mind, I was in a MAJOR rush to finish the  'zine  anyways..  but
don't despair... here's TWO chapters from "The Eye" just to make up for  my
mistake]

Chapter 4, "The Eye", by King Diamond

*********************  T W O   L I T T L E   G I R L S  *********************


One little girl with dirty fingers
Playing with her broken doll
As the other girl is lying
Digging deep into the ground
They seem to play an evil game
A game that doesn't have a name
Both of them are in the ashes
At the stake where witches burn!

If only they could see beyond, the ground they played on
The girls are laughing still, they think they're having fun
They should be far away, watching the sun go down

One little girl picked up a necklace
>From the ashes of the witches
It had wings, and then the other
Cried out loud, "Now let me have it!!!"
The other looked without a sigh
Right into the witch's Eye
The kind of horror that she saw
Made her choke for ever more!

I wish they could have seen, beyond the ground they played on
They would be laughing still, having the best of fun
They would be far away, watching the sun go down

Chapter 5, "The Eye", by King Diamond

*********************  I N T O   T H E   C O N V E N T  *********************

 
Madeleine is running away from herself
Afraid of the shame, she's crying out for help
To be clean again!

No one cared and no one ever will
Her feelings were not shared, she wants to break the spell
and she's going.....

Into the convent, a smile on her face
Into the darkness to hide all her sins
Wondering what could go wrong in this place

Father David:
"Welcome Sister, I'm your Chaplain
Down on your knees, and pray if you please
In this convent I'm your Master
Kiss my Cross now, dearest Sister
In the Name of..."

Madeleine is running away from herself
As father David said: "At communion you must be undressed"
Why did she go?!

Into the convent, a smile on her face
Into the darkness to hide all her sins
Wondering what could go wrong in this place

Father David:
"Come along Sister Madeleine
Unfold your wildest dreams, it's time to join and sing
Let the feast begin"

That night she awoke to find "The Eye"
On the stone cold floor, Why?, She never ever would know why
But she put it on

Next day Father David passed away
At communion time
Why, he never ever would know why
But he looked at "The Eye"

The Eye of the necklace is taking it's toll
Inside the convent a soul will rejoice

*********************  T O   B E   C O N T I N U E D  **********************
Typed by: Death Incarnate

[Editor -- Ok dudes.. I hope you are getting the story.. Madeleine  is  the
little girl from the last Chapter who killed the other little girl with the
necklace.. that event has haunted her.. and she goes to a convent to escape
herself.. but the priest is a nut case, he rapes the sisters at  communion,
then the Eye appears and she unconsciously puts it on and kills  the  Priest
when he  looks  at  it...  and  the  sisters  rejoice...  but  the  joy  is
premature.... hahahahaha.. until the next chapter dudes... goodbye!]

                             Album: "Undertow"


There's a shadow just behind me.  Shrouding every step I take.
Making every promise empty.  Pointing every finger at me.
Waiting like a stalking butler, who upon the finger rests.
Murder now the path of must we, just because the son has come.

Jesus, won't you fucking whistle.  Something but the past and time?

Why can't we not be sober?  I just want to start this over.
Why can't we drink forever?  I just want to start this over.

I am just a worthless liar.  I am just an imbecile.
I will only complicate you.  Trust in me and fall as well.
I will find a center in you.  I will chew it up and leave.
I will work to elevate you, just enough to bring you down.

Mother Mary, won't you whisper.  Something but the past and time?

Why can't we not be sober?  I just want to start this over.
Why can't we sleep forever?  I just want to start this over.

I am just a worthless liar.  I am just an imbecile.
I will only complicate you.  Trust in me and fall as well.
I will find a center in you.  I will chew it up and leave.
Trust me...

Why can't we not be sober.  I just want to start things over.
Why can't we sleep forever.  I just want to start this over.

I want what I want...

[Editor -- This song is one of my all time favorite songs. I love  the  way
it talks about the Holocaust, and Joseph Mengele is particular, who  is  of
course, "The Angel of Death". I remember, once in English  class,  we  were
supposed to right a poem about the Holocaust, and I thought... SHIT!  If  I
could just remember the words, I'd write down Angel of Death.  Too  bad,  I
would've liked to see the shock of my teacher when  I  recited  it  to  the
class out loud! Muuuhahahaha]

Auschwitz, the meaning of pain
The why that I want you to die
Slow death, immense decay
Showers that cleanse you of your life
  Forced in
  Like cattle
  You run
  Stripped of
  Your life's worth
  Human mice, for the Angel of Death
  Four hundred thousand more to die
  Angel of Death
  Monarch to the kingdom of the dead
Sadistic, surgeon of demise
Sadist of the noblest blood

Destroying, without mercy
To benefit the Aryan race

Surgery, with no anesthesia
Fell the knife pierce you intensely
Inferior, no use to mankind
Strapped down screaming out to die
  Angel of Death
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead
Infamous butcher,
  Angel of Death

Pumped with fluid, inside your brain
Pressure in your skull begins pushing through your eyes
Burning flesh, drips away
Test of heat burns your skin, your mind starts to boil
Frigid cold, cracks your limbs
How long can you last
In this frozen water burial?
Sewn together, joining heads
Just a matter of time
'Til you rip yourselves apart
  Millions laid out in their
  Crowded tombs
  Sickening ways to achieve
  The holocaust
Seas of blood, bury life
Smell your death as it burns
Deep inside of you
Abacinate, eyes that bleed
Praying for the end of
Your wide awake nightmare
Wings of pain, reach out for you
His face of death staring down,
Your blood running cold
Injecting cells, dying eyes
Feeding on the screams of
The mutants he's creating
  Pathetic harmless victims
  Left to die
  Rancid Angel of Death
  Flying free

  Angel of Death
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead
Infamous butcher,
  Angel of Death

Angel of Death!

[Editor -- I LOVE putting in White Zombie songs just for  the  hell  of  it
once and awhile. They are one of the coolest bands around, but their  words
are TOTALLY meaningless, and if you listened to  the  music,  you  probably
wouldn't really care, 'cause the words were picked to go  with  the  groove
of the music... At least, that's what I think... hehehe.. enjoy!]

Thrust in deep there are no limitations
Wing shaped constellations everywhere now
Creep, babe, creep your life's like a suicide 
And I said "I'm gonna ride it"
She don't care now, yeah! Maybe
The night ride gonna bleed, yeah! Maybe
This is what ch'all need!
Sink'n deep into your destination dig the demolition everywhere, now
Creep, babe, creep into your ring o' fire
Burned out on the wire
She don't care now, yeah! Maybe
The night ride gonna bleed, yeah! Maybe
This is what ch'all need!
Open the darkness an hour later to the minute (moment)
Move under the guilty she went deep into the corner
Snap dog city hypnotize and break the mercury
Rig test, oil inject freak hallucination
Shot through the backdoor 
Buzz a whirling locomotion west straight to another
Through the sea of love, life on the line
Still in time, you will find "She has gone away"
Don't ask way, super sky
Live or die, "She has gone away."
Figure this, no more, sis-spanish kiss
"She has gone away."
Thrust into a diamond generation
Dexceleration everywhere
Up from hell a missile to the moon and zero to the 3 and 4 and 5 and 
Yeah! Maybe
This is what y'all need!
How fast can you really move me come on, come on, come on, come on, yeah!
A ritual electro-nation, yow!

                    Album: "Suicide's An Alternative"

 
Yesterday, as I went out of the house
I saw a body lying down quiet as a mouse
Lying face down in the sewer
I got up closer and realized that I knew her
All her organs coming from her inside
Slashed up skin sliced up hide
Turned over and saw the tire tracks on her head
That's when I realized she was dead
I saw your mommy and your mommy's dead
I saw your mommy and your mommy's dead
 
Twisted body chopped off feet
Her body was minced meat
Bugs crawling on her arms
She's dead, can't do no harm
Gnarled up legs, broken and bent
Her last breath has been spent
I wonder, how much would I pay
To get your mom killed in such a bloody way
 
I saw your mommy and your mommy's dead
I watched her as she bled
Chewed off toes on her chopped off feet
I took a picture cuz I thought it looked neat
But the thing I liked seeing the best
Was the rodents using her hair as a nest
I saw your mommy and your mommy's dead
I saw your mommy and your mommy's dead
 
Twisted body chopped off feet
Her body was minced meat
Bugs crawling on her arms
She's dead, can't do no harm
Gnarled up legs, broken and bent
Her last breath has been spent
I know, that she won't really be missed
But make it look good at her funeral
and giver her a little kiss
 
I saw your mommy and your mommy's dead
I saw her lying in a pool of red
I think it's the greatest thing I'll ever see
Your dead mommy right in front of me
I'll always remember her lying dead on the floor
I hope she dies twenty times more
I saw your mommy and your mommy's dead
I saw your mommy and your mommy's dead
 
Twisted body chopped off feet
Her body was minced meat
Bugs crawling on her arms
She's dead, can't do no harm
Gnarled up legs, broken and bent
Her last breath has been spent
I wonder, how much would I pay
To get your mom killed in such a bloody way

Preface: I know I don't really share most of the tastes expressed  by  Loud
Lyrix, but I like to invade lists with  my  own  perverse  tastes  whenever
possible :-). I happened to have the lyrics from an old  X-ray  Spex  album
near my computer, and I think they're pretty funny and sharp. Besides, this
great late '70s band definitely was LOUD! -- Richard

[Editor - just to let everyone know, we aren't as strict as you think about
posting ONLY heavy metal lyrics in Loud Lyrix, as long as you don't  expect
us to print some pop or A/C songs, don't worry about the genre you send in,
as long as it's funny or makes a statement, I'll probably put it  in,  it's
always worth a shot to ask right?]

I clambered over mounds and mounds
Of polystyrene foam
Then fell into a swimming pool
Filled with fairy snow

[Chorus:]
And watched the world turn 
Day-Glo you know you know
The world turned day-glo you know

I wrenched the nylon curtains back
As far as they would go
Then peered through perspex window panes
At the acrylic road

[Chorus]

I drove my polypropylene car
On wheels of sponge
Then pulled into a Wimpy Bar
To have a rubber bun

[Chorus]

The X-rays were penetrating
Through the latex breeze
Synthetic fibre see-thru leaves
Fell from the rayon trees

[Chorus]

A note to the parody non-fans...the parodies I write are in no way meant to
make a mockery of Metallica or their songs. I respect  the  guys'  work  as
much as you. I just do it 'cause it's fun trying to  come  up  with  really
funny stuff, 'cause lots of people *do* like 'em, and 'cause if my  spirits
are low, it helps lift 'em quite well! We're all here ta have some  fuckin'
fun, RIGHT?!?! -- Crash

[Editor -- Right on Crash! I personally bust a gut every time I read  a  one
of these parodies, and I hope you dudes out there like 'em too.  Thanks  to
Kain for sending them in almost every week... let's hope these  guys  don't
run out of ideas!]

Fucking! Everywhere...
 Crying! Pulling hair...

Jerkin'! Peek and enjoy!! (4x)

She's a sex machine, yeah that's her style...
But she's got a man who can go the last mile!
Tits they bounce, as she rides him quicker!
She starts to buck her hips, he swigs his liquor!!

Fucking! Everywhere...
 Crying! Pulling hair...
 Coming! A thousand screams...

Fucking! Everywhere...
 Crying! Pulling hair...
CUMMING! A thousand screams!!

Jerkin'! Peek and enjoy!! (4x)

Her climax has died, and she's sprawled on the floor.
But *he's* just not fulfilled, he's always hungry for more!
Soon they're up again and building speed...
And he slows down his jerks, so he can follow her lead!

Fucking! Everywhere
 Crying! Pulling hair...
 Coming! A thousand screams...

Fucking! Everywhere...
 Crying! Pulling hair...
CUMMING! A thousand screams!!

Jerkin'! Peek and enjoy!! (4x)

This band is one of my all time favourites and this track one of  the  most
memorable for me - I used to sing it to myself  after  a  break-up  with  a
long-term girlfriend when I was thinking of the "other guy"  {grind  teeth,
etc}. No, I never did manage to get him... -- John Breakwell

You thought it was gone
But the fire goes on
And I thought you knew me
I told you before
'Til I settle the score
That I'll never run free
I have enough pain and anger in my brain
To last many lifetimes
Yet still it grows, and the more that it shows
I won't have peace of mind

The fire, the fire still burns
The fire, the fire still burns

I have a dream
And as strange as it seems
There's no embers glowing
The fire's gone out
And there's no need to shout
'cause no angers showing
But it's not true, nothing I ever do
Seems to ease my fury
Get out of my way
I'm the hangman today
And the judge and jury

The fire, the fire still burns
The fire, the fire still burns

The fire, the fire still burns ((repeat a lot))

I need your skulls
 
Demon i am and face i peel
To see skin turned inside out cause
Gotta have you on my wall
Gotta have you on my wall cause
 
I want your skulls
I need your skulls
 
Collect the heads of little girls and put em on my wall
Hack the heads off little girls and put em on my wall
 
I want your skulls
I need your skulls

Ok dudes.. that's a wrap to Loud Lyrix #8,  hope  you  all  enjoyed  it,  I
luckily had a little break from my "English Homework from Hell", so I  made
sure you guys all had a good solid Loud Lyrix to make up  for  last  week's
mediocre issue.

But I have bad news yet.. next week, or the week after that, there MAY  not
be a Loud Lyrix.. I hope that I will  find  some  time  to  piece  together
SOMETHING, but I can't guaranteed anything.. if I can, I will try  and  get
one out, but it might be a couple days late, so don't  worry  about  it,  I
thought it would be best to warn you all.

Ok, that's it people... keep sending those submissions in, and in a  couple
of weeks, as soon as May is over, I will be FREE! No more essays and  shit,
and then we'll REALLY get this 'zine rocking!

C-ya
