Loud Lyrix, #14, 7/6/94
-----------------------

Hey Duuuudes!! Here we are! Back with another Loud Lyrix,  a  little  late,
but here anyways! So people, just lemme say  sorry  for  putting  out  this
issue a day late, I've been pretty damn busy lately,  and  my  job  doesn't
help any! Anyways, this issue is a  little  small,  but  guys,  I'm  really
pressed for time... 

This week's been awesome!! The reason I couldn't put the issue together  on
the weekend was because of another AMAZING PARTY!!!!!! Yeah!! This one  was
the best yet... fuck man, we had it in this guy's basement, with a  fucking
KEG!! Of Molson Canadian.... 7 and  a  half  fucking  2-4's  !!!!  Wow!  We
didn't even finish the fucking thing... anyways.. it was awesome,  his  dad
bought the keg for us, and they had other drinks  upstairs,  including this
amazing French wine, which I also drained!... it was kewl... we slapped  on
some White Zombie, and went mental moshing like true 'bangers.. I'm telling
you, it was worse than a REAL pit... smashing into walls, fuck, I got  more
bruises than at the Pantera gig! A friend  of  mine  sprained  his  ankle..
hahahaha.. that was funny...

Alright people, I know that over a HUNDRED of you  subbers  out  there  are
new  to  Loud  Lyrix,  and  that  this  is  your  first  issue  (see  guys,
advertising pays off), anyways... we have  now  over  250  subbers,  and  I
haven't checked for like 4 dayz, so  it's  probably  more  like  300+  now!
That's just soooo great... I hope all you newbies like Loud Lyrix, but  you
have to make sure you get involved! Send in  submissions,  lyrics  to  your
favorite tunes, reviews, interviews, shit.. ANYTHING that's related to  the
amazing world of metal, if I like it, I'll print it... 

Ok dudes... so, the last three songs are reader submissions, the  rest  are
my choice.. we're up to Chapter  3  of  10  in  King  Diamond's  "Them".  I
included those three Megadeth songs, and the Judas Priest  song  because  I
just bought the albums that they are  on...  Megadeth's  "Rust  In  Peace",
"Peace Sells...", "So Far, So Good... So What!" and Judas Priest's "Ram  it
Down".. these albums totally smoke, I'm telling you! I included what in  my
option is the best song on Slayer's "Show No  Mercy"...  "The  Antichrist",
I'm listening to the album right now as I put together this issue  of  Loud
Lyrix... it rulez!!

BTW... if anyone knows anything about the  last  song,  "Fuck  Me  Dead"...
like who sings it, or which album it's off of, post me and tell me PLEASE!!

Alright people.. that's it from me,.. all you new people, don't  forget  to
get a copy of the Loud Lyrix Ad.. and post it like nuts  everywhere...  oK?
Keep them submissions coming, and I'll see you dudes and dudettes l8r!

Late that night I awoke from My sleep
Hearing unknown voices laughing
insane
Grandma' was one, Oh it's coming
from the room next to mine

It's Grandma' room... the invisible
guests

As I stood there alone in the dark
Peeking through the keyhole, couldn't
believe My eyes
I'd never seen anything like it, only
Grandma' was inside the room

Speaking to no one... the invisible
guests

Cups were rising in thin air and then
emptied on the floor
Suddenly the door was open and
Grandma' said
"Do come in My little friend"

Missy and Mother were sleeping
downstairs
If they could see me in Grandmother's
chair

Grandmother said "look Me deep in
the eyes
You will forget what You saw here
tonight"

"I will let You in on the secret of this
house
The secret of Amon... that's what we
call this house
Now I want you to go back to sleep,
now go back to sleep My dear"

The invisible guests

Cups were rising in thin air and then
emptied on the floor
Suddenly the door was open and
Grandma' said
"Now you must go back to sleep"

"Go to sleep"... "Go to sleep"...
"Go to sleep"...

Missy and Mother were sleeping
downstairs
If they could see me in Grandmother's
chair

                           Album: "Rust In Peace"


Brother will kill brother
Spilling blood across the land
Killing for religion
Something I don't understand.
Fools like me, who cross the sea
And come to foreign lands
Ask the sheep, for their beliefs
Do you kill on God's command?
A country that's divided
Surely will not stand
My past erased, no more disgrace
No foolish naive stand.
The end is near, it's crystal clear
Part of the master plan
Don't look now to Israel
It might be your homeland.
Holy Wars

Upon my podium, as the know it all scholar
Down in my seat of judgment gavel's bang, uphold the law
Up on my soapbox, a leader out to change the world
Down in my pulpit as the holier-than-thou-could-be messenger of God.

        -- The Punishment Due --
Wage the war on organized crime
Sneak attacks, repel down the rocks
Behind the lines
Some people risk to employ me
Some people live to destroy me
Either way they die.  They die!

They killed my wife and my baby,
With hopes to enslave me
First mistake...last mistake!
Paid by the alliance, to slay all the giants
Next mistake...no more mistakes!

Fill the cracks in, with judicial granite
Because I don't say it, don't mean I ain't thinkin it.
Next thing you know, they'll take my thoughts away
I know what I said, now I must scream
Of the overdose
And the lack of mercy killings...mercy killings
Mercy killings...killings...killings
Next thing you know, they'll take my thoughts away

"Pull over, shithead, this is the cops!"

Full tank, pockets lined with cash
Full throttle, gonna rip some ass.
Drive all day, and through the night,
Romance the road, winding left to right.

        The stars above guide me, the moonlight is free.
        A feeling inside me, and the whole world to see.

Driving fast makes me feel good,
The speed of light trapped under my hood.
Breaking laws cause there's nothing to do.
Driving the interstate, stopped for a 502

Hundreds of miles rolled off today.
Signs lose their meanings, minutes tick away.
Dirt roads to the interstates, I must have drove them all.
Cigarettes and burgers, caffeine and alcohol.

        Drive until daybreak, always on the go.
        Life on the freeway, night shift till dawn patrol.

Driving fast makes me feel good,
The speed of light trapped under my hood
Breaking laws cause there's nothing to do.
Driving the interstate, stopped for a 502.
Stopped for a 502, next time it's gonna be you.

Stars above guide me
This feeling inside me.
I drive until daybreak.
Life on the freeway is Hell.
I'm coming through!

                   Album: "Peace Sells, But Who's Buying"


Welcome to our sanguinary sect of worship.
Feel at home in our black conventicle,
As we anathmatise
All those who oppose us.
Don't summon the devil,
Don't call the priests,
If you need the strength,
The Conjuring.  Obey!!!

Behold!  The flames rise
>From the compass' cardinal points.
Burn the sacred oil,
And, with the ashes you'll anoint.

Arrange the symbols,
Of the wizard, and magician.
Light the candles,
Place the parchment paper in position
Between its leaves place
The lash from a black cat's eye,
A straw of a broom,
Fold, and burn, and centralize.

Don't summon the devil,
Don't call the priests,
If you need the strength,
The Conjuring.

I am the devil's advocate,
A salesman, if you will.
You know my name.

I met your father years ago,
Gave him what he'd please.
He called my name, you'll do the same.

I'm claiming what is mine by right,
It's time to close the deal.
You're bought and sold, bought and sold.

Come join me in my infernal depths,
Mephisto's hall of fame.
I've got your soul, I've got your soul.
The Conjuring.  Obey!!!

As the sun goes down, I move around
Keeping to the shadows
Life, hangs by a thread
And I've heard it said, that I'll not see tomorrow

If that's my destiny, it'll have to be
So I'll face the future
Running out of time
I'm on the line
But I'll go down fighting

Fell the hand of justice
Telling wrong from right
Threw me out upon the street in the middle of the night

Cybernetic heartbeat
Digital precise
Pneumatic fingers nearly had me in their vice

Not begging you
I'm telling you

You won't break me
You won't make me
You won't take me,
Under blood red skies

You won't break me
You won't take me
I'll fight you under
blood red skies

Through a shattered city, watched by laser eyes
Overhead the night squad glides
The decaying paradise

Automatic sniper
With computer sights
Scans the bleak horizon for its victim of the night

Not begging you
I'm telling you

You won't break me
You won't make me
You won't take me,
Under blood red skies

You won't break me
You won't take me
I'll fight you under
blood red skies

As the end is drawing near
Standing proud, I won't give in to fear
As I die a legend will be born
I will stand, I will fight
You'll never take me alive
I'll stand my ground
I won't go down

You won't break me
You won't make me
You won't take me,
Under blood red skies

You won't break me
You won't take me
I'll fight you under
blood red skies

You'll never take me alive
I'm telling you
Hands of justice
I will stand, I will fight
As the sun goes down
I won't give in to fear

War inside my head
War inside my head
War inside my head
War inside my head

War inside my head ain't a pretty sight
But I don't want no sympathy
It's happened a thousand times before
It's just a harsh reality

Chorus:
War inside my head-can you sense it
War inside my head-can you see it
War inside my head-can you feel it
War inside my head
  Can you hear the-Pain
  Can you see the-Pain
  Can you sense the-Pain
  Can you feel the-Pain
  Can you help the-Pain
  Can you fix the-Pain
  Can you taste the-Pain
Can you hear the war inside my head

The only thing real is the way I feel
And that's the pain that's deep inside
The battle from within is gonna begin
And there ain't nowhere to hide

Chorus
War inside my head every night and day
I never get no piece of mind
It ought to be a sin, I just can't win
And pure hell is all I find

Screams and nightmares
Of a life I want
Can't see living this lie no
A world I haunt
You've lost all control of my
Heart and soul
Satan holds my future
Watch it unfold

I am the Antichrist
It's what I was meant to be
Your God left me behind
And set my soul to be free

Watching disciples
Of the satanic rule
Pentagram of blood
Holds the jackal's truth
Searching for the answer
Christ hasn't come
Awaiting the final moment
The birth of Satan's son

Screams,
>From a life I live
Torment,
Is what I give
Torture,
Is what I love
The down fall,
Of the heavens above

I am the Antichrist
All love is lost
Insanity is what I am
Eternally my soul will rot [rot... rot]

Anything you want
Anything the world has to offer

If you just reach out to me
Take my hand
Everything a kiss cannot bring you
I will give you

And it's freedom

And it's freedom
In my arms
In my arms
In my arms
 
Anything you want

I can give you
All this world and its glories
And its sins
I will give it all to you
Take my hand

Anything you want

Anything you need
It's in my arms
Anything you want it's in my arms
Anything you need it's in my arms
In my loving arms
In my arms

Fell in love with a country girl, mornin' sunshine
She was up from another world
Just to bust another soul
Her eyes were an endless flame, holy lightning
Desire wore a special name made to snatch your soul away, yeah

We sailed away on a crimson tide, gone forever
Left my heart on the other side
All to break it into bits
Her smile was a winter's song, a sabbath ending
Don't sleep or you'll find me gone
Just an image in the air, oh

In dreams I think of you
I don't know what to do with myself
Time has let me down
She brings broken dreams, fallen stars
The endless search for where you are

So wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong

Now fell in love with a country girl, mornin' sunshine
She was up from another world
Just to bust another soul
Her eyes were an endless flame, unholy lady
Desire wore a special name made to snatch your soul away, oh

Don't sail away on a crimson tide
Don't leave your heart on the other side
Her eyes are an endless flame
Desire wanna scratch your name

Don't ever fall in love
Don't give your heart away
No never, never fall in love
With a country girl

     (I have no idea who did this song, it was passed on from a friend)
     

I like the name tag between your toes
I like the snot running out of your nose
I like the stains on your panty hose
Just a cold stiff mummy when I hold you close
 
I like rigor mortis when it just sets in
I know where you're going I don't care where you've been
A pillow and a coffin just as nice as a bed
And baby I love it when you fuck me dead
I said baby I love it when you fuck me dead
 
Every new girl's another three day affair
Rather be * pull of your hair
Really doesn't matter if you're gray-haired and old
Really doesn't matter * long as she *
 
Smiling emergency * ok
Rather make it with you when you're DOA
Lying there stiff when it's time to pay
I can't wait till the undertaker goes away
 
Hanging upside down when you're getting drained
S & M pleasure on the wall when you *
When you * up just *
Oh baby I love it when you fuck me dead
I said baby I love it when you fuck me dead
 
Every new girl's another three day affair
Doesn't really matter if I pull on your hair
Doesn't really matter if she's too young or old
I got to be careful *
 
Baby baby I'll hold you close
Quick quick before you decompose
Baby baby I'll hold you close
And baby I love it when you fuck me dead
I said baby I love it when you fuck me dead
I said baby I love it when you fuck me dead
I said baby I love it when you FUCK!
