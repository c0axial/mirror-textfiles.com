Issue #13 - 6/28/94 --> LISTSERV Celebration Semi-Mega Issue!
-------------------------------------------------------------

Alright dudes!!!!!!! Here we are ONCE AGAIN!!!  And  we  are  finally  back
with a fucking vengeance! Here is the LONG  AWAITED  'LISTSERV  Celebration
Semi-Mega Issue' !! And I'm telling you guys right  now  it's  gonna  be  a
dousey!

Anyways.. I've finally decided to type  up  my  'experiences'  at  the  two
concerts I've been to see this month.. you guys should  get  a  kick  outta
'em... please excuse me for the Metallica show.. 'cause  it  was  almost  a
month ago, so it's not exactly fresh in my mind... anyways... these are  by
no means a review of  the  shows,  I'm  just  relating  to  you  guys  what
happened to me during the shows... hope you enjoy 'em!!!

Ok dudes.. I got a major bone to pick, and it has to do with  submissions..
I NEED 'EM!!! How do you expect me to keep having a variety in this 'zine??
If I don't get any submissions, you'll more than  likely  keep  seein'  the
same old bands in this 'zine... these are my favorite  bands..  so  when  I
don't get any submissions I just pick them myself... that's why  I  MAJORLY
need lots and lots o' submissions.. you guys were getting great at  sending
in submissions and shit... I was really happy with you all, but now,  since
the two weeks that I had to take off, you have begun to slack  off,  and  I
don't blame you one bit, but I need youse guys again... BADLY... I know you
don't want this 'zine to become monotonous, so send in  those  submissions,
just type up your favorite songs, or anything you wanna see in the 'zine...
I'd love to get other things too... other than just lyrics...  like  record
reviews, and concert reviews, and most importantly, a couple of comments on
some songs that have been posted... also, any other shit you wanna  see  in
the 'zine.. I'm willing to put anything 'metallic' in the 'zine.. just send
it to me, it's never useless sending anything to me, I have an  open  mind,
and I'll look at anything, just try it out, and if it  involves  a  lot  of
typing, then just give me a summary, and  I'll  tell  you  if  I  like  the
idea.... anyways... let's get some variety in this mag... when  I  get  the
next M.E.A.T. (Canada's Premier Metal Mag), I'll  type  up  some  of  their
record reviews... ok? You see, I'm doing my bit, now it's your turn... just
think of something you can contribute to the 'zine, and send it to me, or a
summary, and I'll give you the ok, and print it up for you... just remember
this.. don't send me 100000 lines of text and crap and expect me  to  print
it up... I like short and concise things, but if the  situation  calls  for
something really long, by all means, go ahead, if it's something good, I'll
put it in regardless. Anyways, that's it... SEND ME ALL THE  SHIT  YOU  CAN
MUSTER!!!

Ok, now... what's next? .. Oh yeah... Another thing I want  all  you  dudes
to do now that we have a LISTSERV is to start spreading the word around  on
Loud Lyrix.. ok?  Just  leave  me  a  note,  and  I'll  send  you  the  NEW
advertisement for Loud Lyrix,  and  you  can  just  go  MENTAL  posting  it
EVERYWHERE you think is worthy to have such a high  caliber  document  (!).
Anyways.. let's get this membership  list  past  the  170  mark  for  ONCE!
Jeez... ok.. don't forget to ask for the advertisement.

Another thing.. ton's of people have written me asking what the hell  'PGP'
is ??? Well, the rule of thumb is, if you don't  know,  don't  worry  about
the PGP key I send out, just let me say that  it's  an  encryption  program
that's  used  for  the  private  transfer  of  sensitive  information   (!)
Anyways.. use it if you feel a need too.. I thought it'd be kewl to have  a
PGP key for the 'zine... if you want more information on   PGP,   just  use
FTP   and   connect   to   ftp.eff.org   and   look   in   the   directory:
pub/Net_info/Tools/Crypto/PGP... ok?

Some kewl news.. I just got word that Napalm Death and Entombed  are  gonna
come to Toronto.. I have no idea when, put that's what I heard, and I  know
I'll be goin' for SURE!! What a fuckin' show THAT'LL be... I can't  wait...
I  just  love  Entombed,  Napalm  Death  is  ok,  but  good  for   a   mosh
nevertheless...

Hey guys.. I've been having this idea floating around in my  head  for  the
past couple weeks.. I want to have a big, little survey  in  the  'zine  in
the next couple of weeks... if I do have it, EVERYONE MUST PARTICIPATE!!!!!
It has to be a group effort, or it's nothing... I'll give you all three  or
four weeks to get the results in to me.. and then print 'em up.... so  look
for the survey in the next couple o' weeks....

Ok dudes.. I think that's it.. I HOPE!!  It  feels  as  if  I've  forgotten
something, but I can't remember, so never mind... hope you like the  songs,
and ROCK ON BROTHERS AND SISTERS !

                             Experiences with:
*********  P A N T E R A / S E P U L T U R A / B I O H A Z A R D  ***********
                      by  G I N O   F I L I C E T T I
                      

It all started at about 3:00pm on Saturday June the 18th, me and my  friend
Edgar were gonna start to head downtown (Toronto),  and  just  hang  around
until the show started at 7:00pm.. so we get down to the Bloor/Yonge Subway
Station, this spot is like the centre of the city. So we get off, and start
walkin' deeper into the heart of city. We always do this walk, it's  really
kewl, 'cause we like check  out  all  the  shops  on  the  way  down  Yonge
street... there are TONS of head shops and other 'banger hangouts... it was
amazing, I'm telling you, even at 3pm  everywhere  you  looked  you  saw  a
brother wearin' a Pantera shirt, or a sister wearin' a Sepultura shirt.. it
was really kewl... I had my Judas Priest shirt on, It's a  nice  small  and
tight one that I like wearin' to concerts 'cause baggy  shirts  always  get
ripped... Anyways.. there we are just bumming around downtown, waitin'  for
7pm to roll around.. we went and ate at the huge Pizza Pizza at  Yonge  and
Dundas. We also hung out at the Mega HMV.. we went to see  the  DJ  at  the
back of the store, and they just changed over to the show they usually have
'Heart Attack' that's when they play  all  metal..  it  was  kewl!  Another
wicked thing is that the DJ of 'Heart Attack' is Metal  Tim  Henderson..  a
former writer for M.E.A.T. magazine! I had a ball talkin'  with  him...  we
talked about everything from the Kiss Tribute Album  (_Kiss  My  Ass_)  and
about the new Slayer album coming out in August (Fuck!! that pissed me off,
they were supposed to release the fucking thing in MAY!!), anyways,  before
we left, he gave us some awesome posters, it was kewl, we got a  nice  huge
one from the Metallica show of two weeks prior.... Anyways... we bought out
a locker, and stashed the goods in there and it was now off to the  amazing
building called Maple Leaf Gardens... and time for  the  show  to  begin!!!
Anyways... they set up the seating so that you  could  have  seats  on  the
sides of the stage, and in the middle, (where the hockey rink usually  is),
they had the huge 5000 person mosh pit!! We had pretty good seats, but  the
bad thing was just that, THEY WERE SEATS.... so  anyways..  we  go  to  our
seats and wait for Biohazard to come on. Around 8pm Biohazard finally  came
on, and started playin' some of their stuff, we were sitting in our  seats,
and watching the pit go INSANE, and wishing all the while that we  were  in
the middle of it all... Biohazard played for about 30 minutes... they ended
their set with 'Punishment' my favorite song of  theirs..  it  was  wicked!
Anyways, after that  we  had  our  first  intermission...  and  desperately
awaited the arrival of Sepultura, the band that I most wanted to see  outta
the three. Anyways.. after about 1/2 an hour, Sepultura comes blasting  out
onto stage.. I get up outta my seat and I'm just ROARING!!  It  was  purely
amazing, I was having the time of my life, headbanging like  there  was  no
tommorow, and singing at the top of my lungs, and  I  still  couldn't  hear
myself! Anyways... I was like the only dude that was into them THAT much in
the seats.. I'm telling you I was HURTING to go into the mosh pit, I wanted
to join all  my  brothers  down  there  soooooo  desperately...  but  fuck,
anyways... they played all  their  best  songs  from  Chaos  A.D.  and  the
classics from Arise and Beneath the Remains... I 'banged  and  'banged  and
'banged.. it was soooooo wicked.. I just  love  that  band...  it  was  the
second time I saw 'em, I saw 'em for the  first  time  with  Fudge  Tunnel,
Clutch and Fear Factory.. that was an amazing show...  they  RULED  there..
it's definately one of, if not my favorite show of all time.  Ok,  so  next
after Sepultura was done, it was time for the band most of the building was
waitin' for... PANTERA. This time, me and Edgar decided that there  was  no
way in HELL that we'd be stuck in the seats for this  set!  So  during  the
intermission, we positioned ourselves for a quick  entry  onto  the  floor.
First we sat on the end of our row, and when the way was clear,  we  jumped
down to the Gold section and took some seats beside the aisle.  Next  thing
you know, I look at the dude beside me, and I startin' FLIPPING...  it  was
none other than Drew Masters the totally cool editor of M.E.A.T. !!!! I was
fucking freaked out, anyways, me and him start talking,  about  EVERYTHING,
about M.E.A.T., about the show, about the Metallica show, about the  scene,
about the pit, about just fucking everything... he is a real cool guy,  I'm
telling you, he treated us like equals, he didn't  give  us  no  'your  not
worthy' attitude or no shit like that... and I always knew that  he  was  a
cool guy, just from reading the mag for the past 2.5  years.  Anyways..  we
even  met  his  wife  Francine,  a  kewl  chick,  although  she  was  kinda
disappointed that we weren't into stuff like Pearl  Jam  and  Stone  Temple
Pilots!! HAHAHAHAA... Anyways, the time was drawin' closer for  Pantera  to
come on, so we gave Drew our goodbyes and good lucks and told him  to  keep
the mag goin' strong. Anyways.. after that the house lights went  off,  and
WE WERE OFF.. we ran down the aisle, jumped  the  boards,  and  disappeared
into the crowd... WE MADE IT!!! It was such  an  awesome  feeling.  So  now
Pantera comes out, and they start off their set with a song from their last
album "Vulgar Display of Power" called "A New Level" (check it out later in
this issue!).. it was wicked.. it felt soooo good  to  finally  be  in  the
mosh... so there we are goin' mental, and having  a  ball,  Edgar  is  just
surfin' left and right, and finally we lost each other.. that  was  when  I
noticed a tiny hole leading to the rail, right  in  the  first  row!  So  I
squeezed into it, and there I was!!! Front row... Center! (Ok, just a touch
off center!) I  got  there  during  their  third  song,  another  one  from
"Vulgar..." called "Walk".. So that's where I stayed for most of  the  rest
of the show. They played the entire new album "Far Beyond Driven" and lot's
of old classics. I gotta say that Pantera is one of the  coolest  bands  on
stage, I'm telling you, they  really  are  into  their  fans  a  lot,  like
sometimes, there were some people tryin' to scramble up the speakers to get
on stage, and the bouncers are tryin' to yank 'em down, but Phil  (Anselmo,
singer) always came over and helped him up, telling security to fuck off...
it was wicked, they let tons of people on stage, who later exited by taking
the eternal plunge, right into the crowd! Some other  stuff  happened  too,
like Phil saw this guy in the crowd with the same  tattoo  on  his  stomach
that says in big stamp letters "UNSCARRED" he got the crowd to surf the guy
up to the stage... and he let him on, and after dive off of  course...  and
then he saw a familiar face in the crowd... so Phil yells  out  "Hey!  It's
Mad Dog everyone!!!" So he got the crowd to get Mad Dog up on stage, and he
goes, "C'mon Mad Dog, you gotta do it for us man.. do the  trick".  So  Mad
Dog goes, "Ok Phil... I'll fucking do it... just for you man!".. So they go
and get him a beer in a plastic cup, and then  Mad  Dog  starts  doin'  the
trick..   he   'drinks'   the   entire    beer    through    his    FUCKING
NOSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Can you believe that?!! Well believe it dudes.. 'cause I saw it...  it  was
fucking amazing.. truly  incredible  and  unbelievably  surreal!  Ok..  so,
between all this fun Pantera is just hammering  away  at  their  songs..  I
gotta admit, they are a really good band... good, tight show, I  liked  it.
Yeah, there was another thing that Phil did too... it's a well  known  fact
that Pantera are 'Legalize  Marijuana'  advocates,  so  Phil's  out  there,
talking about the greatness of the 'Sweet Leaf' and he tells the  audience,
"You know, that's what I could go for right  now..  I  nice  DOOB!"  So  of
course one of us loyal fans toss Phil up a joint, which he promptly  lights
up and takes a couple drags of before starting back into the musik, with  a
new sense of .... relaxation, anyways, the pot didn't affect his singing at
all.. they also started tossing out beers in cups to the crowd, I'm telling
you, they musta  tossed  out  like  30  cups  into  the  crowd..  that  was
awesome... hehehe... Near the end of the concert, someone else tossed  Phil
up doob, which he put in his mouth, and promptly took out  and  stared  at,
with a pleased look on his face, the joint was obviously  laced  with  hash
oil! Anyways, it's was near the end of their set, they were  singing  their
cover of the Black  Sabbath  tune  "Planet  Caravan",  and  that's  when  I
couldn't take it anymore... I was beginning to become lightheaded and tired
up there on the rail, with 5000 people  pushing  on  me,  and  the  fucking
bouncers were the worst ones I've ever seen, they were  stingy  with  their
fucking water, it's the first time that the bouncers didn't give the  first
row fans some water to drink..  it  was  absolutely  horrible.  Anyways,  I
couldn't stand it one more minute up  there...  I  was  totally  wasted,  I
REALLY had to get outta there,... so I pushed my way back to where I jumped
the boards, and I jumped back, and when up the same flight of stairs that I
came down, I saw Drew, and I gave him an exhausted look.. hehehe.. I  musta
looked so shitty, it's funny to think of it, my hair all  over  the  place,
I'm dripping wet, and none of it's from 'external' water! Anyways,  I  made
my way up to the washrooms, and drank  outta  the  facet  for  at  least  5
minutes straight 'cause I was soooooo dead.. after that, I made my way back
down to Drew and Fran, and I sat there, the show  was  almost  over,  so  I
decided not to go back to the pit.. anyways.. there was  about  20  minutes
left including the encore, and it was pretty good... at the end, there were
throwing out these round things like frisbee's, and one came right  for  me
and Drew, we jumped up, and some other guy caught it... fuck.. Drew flipped
too, and almost broke his neck!  hahahahahahaha....  anyways...  after  the
show was over, I talked some more with Drew,  he  was  debating  with  Fran
whether to go back stage or not, she didn't want too, 'cause it was too hot
(the concert was during a brutal heat wave we had here, the temperature was
like 35-38C (90-100F) every day, it was murder).  Anyways,  that's  when  I
hear my name being shouted from the floor, it was Edgar, he was down there,
being held back by security, so I said goodbye to Drew once again.. thanked
him for the mag, and I joined Edgar and we left... I immediately ran out to
go and buy some kind of drink... fuck I was dead!! Anyways..  it  was  WELL
worth it all.... I really liked that concert... anyways.. as I said, I  was
really there for Sepultura... but all the bands rocked... anyways,  I  kept
my ticket stub in my socks so I wouldn't lose it, and when I  got  home  it
was like.. DISINTEGRATED!! Anyways.. sorry for making this soooooo long, it
looks like I can't write the Metallica Story now, since it's  like  midnite
on Tuesday oh well... I'll save that for next week...

Grandma' welcome home... You have
been gone for far too long
Is this a dream, are You really back?

Let me help You out of the chair...
Grandma'
Let me touch You, let me feel... Ahhh

Grandma' take a look
What do You think of the house and
the silvery moon?
We are going to repaint the front door
soon

Let me help You out of the chair...
Grandma'
Let me touch You, let me feel... Ahhh

Wait till You see Your room up in the
attic
Prepared just like You said, without a
bed
You will find Your rocking chair and
the tea pot that Missy found

Let me help You out of the chair...
Grandma'
There is someone waiting for You,
now come along

Missy and Mother, they are dying to
meet You
How strange... she's spoken no word...
I wonder Grandma'! Are You all right?

Grandma' what was it like to be on
that holiday site
"Oh it could have been worse but
with "THEM" by my side
In the twilight "THEY" sang all the old
lullabies"
Grandma' who are "THEY"... "never
mind You dirty little brat"

"Let us go inside, something's on
"THEIR" mind
"THEY" are still alive, can You feel
"THEIR" eyes
Can You feel "THEIR" eyes?
Now that You are stuck with me You
better be my friend.

If your havin' trouble with your high school head
He's givin' you da blues
You wanna graduate but not in 'is bed
Here's what you gotta do -
Pick up the phone
I'm always home
Call me any time

I lead a life of crime

Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap
[repeat]
[repeat]
[repeat]
Dirty Deeds and they're Done Dirt Cheap

You got problems in your life of love
You got a broken heart
He's double dealin' with your best friend
That's when the teardrops start -
Pick up the phone
I'm here alone
Or make a social call
Come right in
Forget about him
We'll have ourselves a ball.

Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap
[repeat]
[repeat]
[repeat]
Dirty Deeds and they're Done Dirt Cheap
[repeat]

If you got a lady but you want her gone
But you ain't got the guts
She keeps naggin' you night and day
Enough to drive you nuts -
Pick up the phone
Leave her alone
It's time you made a stand
For a fee I'll be happy to be
Your back door man

Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap

Now I'm gonna tell ya a story
A tale of wrong and Right
and freedom is the reason
You can't take it without a fight
 
So now I'm startin' up a posse 
(Suck my dick, suck my dick)
To come and look for you
We're gonna put a stop
To what you want to do
You fucking whores 
(You fuckin' whores)
That's all you are
 
You say our records are offensive 
(You're a douche, You're a douche)
Our messages ain't right
You say "We're gonna label records
So our kids can grow up right"
You fucking whores 
(Let them decide)
That's all you are
 
Chorus
Shit, fuck, satan, death, sex drugs, rape
These seven words you're trying to take
Shit, fuck, satan, death, sex, drugs, rape
Right or wrong it's our choice to make
America the beautiful, Land of the free
Don't change the words to land of Hypocrisy
 
Now I'm startin' up a posse 
(Fascist scum, fascist scum)
And we'll damn sure make you see
Something that offends you
May not be offensive to me
You fucking whores 
(You fuckin' whores)
That's all you are
 
Now you might take offense
To a word like "fuck" or "shit"
(Dick)
But you fuckin' don't have the right
(Cunt)
To discriminate me for saying it
You fuckin' whores
(You fuckin' whores)
That's all you are
 
Chorus
 
So now I'm startin' up a posse 
(Motherfucker, motherfuck)
To fight for freedom of choice
To fight for freedom of speech
We're gonna make you hear our voice
 
And now I don't do this to shock you 
(That's the end, that's the end)
I don't do this for spite
You've got the choice, don't buy it, don't read it,
And don't say your opinion's right
You fucking whores 
(You fuckin' whores)
That's all you are 
(Cunty, cunty, cunty, cunt)
 
You know you can't censor my feelings
You can't censor my thoughts
Censorship's against 
Everything America stands for
You fuckin' whores 
(Let us decide)
That's all you are
(And this ain't sexist, either)
 
Chorus

Raise the sights, the city lights are calling
We're hot tonight, the time is right, there's nitro in the air
In the street is where we'll meet, we're warning
On the beat, we won't retreat, beware

Thousands of cars and a million guitars
Screaming with power in the air
We've found the place where the decibels race
This army of rock will be there

To ram it down, ram it down
Straight through the heart of this town
To ram it down, ram it down
Razing the place to the ground
Ram it down

Bodies revvin' in leather heaven in wonder
Lights are dimmin' and heads are swimmin' as thunder hits the stage
Hell breaks loose, turn on the juice get stronger
We metal maniacs begin to rave

Thousands of cars and a million guitars
Screaming with power in the air
We've found the place where the decibels race
This army of rock will be there

To ram it down, ram it down
Straight through the heart of this town
To ram it down, ram it down
Razing the place to the ground
Ram it down

Shout it out, we're all together now
Shout it out, we join as one, one

Thousands of cars and a million guitars
Screaming with power in the air
We've found the place where the decibels race
This army of rock will be there

To ram it down, ram it down
Straight through the heart of this town
To ram it down, ram it down
Razing the place to the ground
Ram it down

You're sittin' in your seat
And then you stand and clutch your breast
Our music drives you wild along with the rest

You watch me singing this song
You see what my mouth can do
And you wish you were the one I was doing it to

And you watch me playin' guitar
And you feel what my fingers can do
And you wish you were the one I was doing it to
Well, listen

You've got great expectations
You've got great expectations

You're dying to be seen
And you wave and call my name
But in the day it seems that I'm a million miles away

You watch me beatin' my drum
And you know what my hands can do
And you wish you were the one I was doing it to
Well, listen

You've got great expectations
You've got great expectations
You've got great expectations

Then you feels these eyes from the stage
And you see me staring at you
And you hear between the lines, my voice is calling to you
Well, listen

You've got great expectations
You've got great expectations
You've got great expectations, do you want to play the role
You've got great expectations, you'd even sell me your soul
You've got great expectations
You've got great expectations
You've got great expectations, do you want to play the role
You've got great expectations, you'd even sell me your soul
You've got great expectations, as long as you can play the role
You've got great expectations

   The rebel of yesterday, tomorrow's fool
    Who are you kidding being that cool?

     Trying to break away from running
              with the pack
     But they ain't listening so you've
              gotta go back

       You're a weekend warrior when
          you're one of the crowd
    But it's over, just look at you now...

    You're not so brave the way you behave
    It makes you sick, gotta get out quick
      It's all bravado when you're out
              with your mates
   It's like a different person goes through
                those gates
            And the game begins
            the adrenalin's high
       Feel the tension maybe someone
                will die...

          A weekend warrior lately
         A weekend warrior sometimes
      A weekend warrior maybe you ain't
             that way anymore

     You've gotta get out gotta get away
    But you're in with a clique it's not
               easy to stray
       You've gotta admit you're just
               living a lie
     It didn't take long to work out why

    It's hard to say why you got involved
           Just wanting to be part
          just wanting to belong...

          A weekend warrior lately
         A weekend warrior sometimes
      A weekend warrior maybe you ain't
             that way anymore

     Some of the things that you've done
            you feel so ashamed
   After all it's only a game... isn't it?
     And after all the adrenalin's gone
        What you gonna do on Monday?

          A weekend warrior lately
         A weekend warrior sometimes
      A weekend warrior maybe you were
           never like that at all

I've got somethin' to say

'Cause sweet Death wants Last Caress.

"Kill for the thrill.  (assassin)  Some people think newspapers
exaggerate juvenile crime.  All that is defined mostly to the
large cities, juvenile delinquency is underlined.  Thus parents
think something is going wrong with the environment.  Adults
create the world, children live it.  Juvenile delinquency is
always rooted in adult delinquency.  And in this process, parents
play the key role when children grow up among adults who refuse
to recognize anything that is fine and good, or worthy of
respect."

People look to me and say
Is the end near, when is the final day
What's the future of mankind
How do I know, I got left behind
Everyone goes through changes
Looking to find the truth
Don't look at me for answers
Don't ask me - I don't know
How am I supposed to know
Hidden meanings that will never show
Fools and prophets from the past
Life's a stage and we're all in the cast
Ya gotta believe in someone asking me who is right,
Asking me who to follow, don't ask me, I don't know,
I don't know - I don't know - I don't know
Nobody ever told me I found out for myself
Ya gotta believe in foolish miracles
It's not how you play the game
It's if you win or lose you can choose
Don't confuse win or lose, it's up to you
It's up to you - it's up to you - it's up to you

deadly petals with strange power
faces shine a deadly smile
back up on you at your trial

Chill and numbs from head to toe
icy sun with frosty glow
Why'd you go reaching your sorrow?
why'd you go read no tomorrow

Feel your spirit rise with the priest
feel your body falling to its knees
Take your walk of remorse
take your body to a corpse
take your body to a corpse
take your body to a corpse
if you want all remorse
take your body to a corpse

Now from darkness, there springs light
Wall of Sleep is cold and bright
Wall of Sleep is lying broken
Sun shines in, you are awoken

Chaotic violence in my eyes
This whole world moves backwards
Peace, another sign that lies
Life today is not worth the pain

On the radio, another homicide
Inmates suffocate in jail
Severed heads of revolt
I wish I'd never been born

Same hand that builds -- destroys
Same hand that relieves -- betrays
Same hand that seeds -- burns
Same peace that exists -- here lies

I can't trust anymore
Criminals within the law
I have something to say
Where I live, don't believe in another day

Heresy and graft
Apartheid
Same religion that saves -- damns you!

Convicted witch my life will end
At midnight on the stake
My dedicated life was spent
To insubordinate
Secured by lock inside a cell
Imprisoned for no crime
The shackles will be useless
When your life is out of time

Incantation spell gone by
I will see life again
My deals will made eternally
I signed the book of red
My rage will be unleashed again
Burning the next morn
Death means nothing, there is no end
I will be reborn

No gift of exile in my fate
I'll get no amnesty
You can't control my destiny
There is no habitual need
Proclaim my death, to end my wrath
It takes more than one try
Indulge your ineffective curse
I will never die

You think by killing me tonight
My powers will not rise
There'll be nowhere for you to run
When my hatred comes to life
Condemned to fill the prophecy
Allowing no first born
Defy your morbid declaration
Leave you ripped and torn

Count your blessing would be priest
As I burn upon the stake
You'd be forgiven endlessly
But your values are all fake
Forever servant of my Lord
By choice and not submission
Maybe now I've made you wonder
Am I superstition

Incantation spell gone by
I will live again
My deals will made eternally
I signed the book in red
My rage will be unleashed again
Burning the next morn
Death means nothing there is no end
I will be reborn

I got a story to tell, now listen up real well
Pay attention this way to what I got to say
Took it to the street, rap to the people we meet
Now we're rocking out hard, to the Suicidal beat
Tried to deny our right, so we put up a fight
Just doing our thang, they tried to call it a gang
Saw the way we tool, that's all that it took
That's all she wrote, they had their scapegoat

Dressed down, Homeboyz, Minority-Join the Army

We're the few, we're the proud, we like to jam it loud
The music we play, won't have it any other way
We're armed to the bone with our music and our tone
Recruiting on the street, with the sound of our beat
Growing larger every day, and everytime we play
Don't need no college plan, we're just a hard-rocking band
We like our music to please, but we ain't gonna appease
No pressure's too much, to make us change our touch

Hardcore, Metal, the New Wave
We're not a gang-Join the Army

Don't be no fool, don't let your prejudice rule
Don't judge by your feer, judge us by your ear
Can't believe every word, of every story that you've heard
Just play the song, I know you'll start to rock along
Well I don't care, 'bout the clothes you were
It's the size of your heart, not the length of your hair
Don't make no difference to me, the color that you be
Black, white or brown, it's all the same to me

Well if you still don't believe, you best get up and leave
Do what you must do, but this ain't the place for you
You got no right, but if you start a fight
We'll be rockin your head, but with our fists instead

I'll fight it with the band, right down till the end
Ask anyone I've met, this ain't no idle threat
Don't flap no fit, and it won't come to this
Bust as for me, I'm down with the Army

New York, Venice
Why join a gang?
Join the Army

Suicidal Rock-Join the Army
Suicidal Rock-Join the Army
Suicidal Rock-Join the Army
Suicidal Rock-I WANT YOU TO Join the Army-S.T.

                      Album: "Countdown to Extinction"


Endangered species, caged in fright,
Shot in cold blood, no chance to fight.
The stage is set, now pay the price.
An ego boost, don't think twice.
Technology, the battle's unfair,
You pull the hammer without a care.
Squeeze the trigger that makes you Man,
Pseudo-safari, the hunt is canned...
The hunt is canned.

< CHORUS >
All are gone, all but one.
No contest, nowhere to run.
No more left, only one.
This is it, this is the Countdown to Extinction.

Tell the truth, you wouldn't dare.
The skin and trophy, oh so rare.
Silence speaks louder than words.
Ignore the guilt, and take your turn.
Liars anagram is lairs,
Man, you were never even there.
Killed a few feet from the cages,
Point blank, you're so courageous...
So courageous.

< Chorus >

One hour from now, another species of life form
Will disappear off the face of the planet, forever...
And the rate is accelerating.

< Chorus >
