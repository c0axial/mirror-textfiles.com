cool freebies.  The number of winners will depend on how much and what kind 
of "stuff" we have around, but we've been getting some great stuff lately.

This is the reply card for Volume 2, Issue 3 of CYBERSPACE VANGUARD 
MAGAZINE:  News and Views of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Universe.

For those of you who are new to the publication, we normally do some sort 
of opinion poll in this space, but since we still have the second question 
from last issue to report and because we're about to embark on this 
multimedia journey, we thought we'd take a break from the usual poll and 
ask a few demographics questions to get a feel for who our audience is, and 
then list our past articles and interviews so you can help us pick the 
"Best of" CV.

Confidentiality is assured.  We won't be releasing this information to 
anyone but us, and no identifying information will remain attached to it.

1)  Where are you located?

2)  What kind of computer (if any) do you use?

3)  Do you normally subscribe to any science fiction newsmagazines (other 
than this one)?

4)  Do you normally subscribe to any science fiction literature magazines?

5)  Do you normally buy either of the above off the newstand?  (If so, 
which one?)

6)  Do you have a computer at home?  What kind?

7)  What do you normally use your computer for?

8)  Do you normally cruise the net looking for sf/f newsbites?

9)  Does the idea of a multimedia version of CV interest you?  Would it 
interest you if you weren't on the net?

10)  What sort of features would you like to see in a multimedia sf 
newsmagazine?

you like to see re-done in a multimedia format?
