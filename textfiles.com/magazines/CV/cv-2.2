--!1!--   Ramblings of a Deranged Editor (and a few deranged readers ...)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     There's been some sort of merging of realities lately, but except for 
a small part of the back of my mind, I haven't really noticed.  Oh, 
intellectually I knew that the net was becoming more and more prevalent in 
The Real World, but still I took refuge in my little corner of 
cyber-reality, secure in the knowledge that while they would find us 
someday, that someday wasn't here yet.
     It's here.
     It started with a trickle, a not even noticed increase in subscription 
requests.  A couple every few days.  Then, all of a sudden, there was an 
explosion, a constant stream sometimes as high as 10 in one day.  And 
that's without having a new issue out.  Now, I like this little project, 
but I was beginning to suspect that there was something going on I didn't 
know about, especially as the number of subscribers edged over 1000.  I was 
right.
     First I got a request mentioning that the person had seen us listed in 
ONLINE ACCESS.  I was surprised to find out that this was an actual paper 
magazine and not an electronic listing, which I was used to.  Then I was 
told we were listed in NETGUIDE and was shocked to find, in my local 
bookstore, that this was a real live BOOK that had us listed.  (True, we 
were under "Cyberpunk" and not "Science Fiction," but hey, I was too 
surprised to complain.)  By the time I got several messages mentioning our 
listing in THE INTERNET DIRECTORY (which I also didn't know about) I was 
merely pleasantly surprised.
     So perhaps it's only fitting that this issue, as we marvel at the 
merging of physical space with cyberspace, we hear from the man who 
invented the term, WILLIAM GIBSON, who's Sprawl novels have become, in some 
sense, a standard for everything else to follow.  Gibson is probably one of 
the few people in history to be the acknowledged father of a movement that 
isn't believed to exist by the people supposedly in it.
     We're also going to hear from STEPHANIE BEACHAM, who plays Dr. 
Westphalen on SEAQUEST.  For years people have been talking about the lack 
of strong women role models in science fiction, and she's got some thoughts 
on the matter.
     And speaking of the real world, I've been thinking about a con that 
goes on near here.  This year events will include panels and workshops, art 
show and auction, masquerade and dance, 90 table dealer's room, filking, 
and gaming.  Most cons have that.  But this one will also be host to free 
laser shoot 'em up games courtesy of Q-ZAR, computer gaming, a psychic 
fair, virtual reality demo, SETI tour, two 24-hour video rooms, 
Japanimation, "Channel 12", the in-house 24-hour "B" Movie channel and 
babysitting.  So how did they manage to convince a hotel to let them do all 
that?  Steve Schwartz, chairman of Marcon 29 and its hotel liason for many 
years, took some time to explain how to develop a good relationship between 
your convention and the hotel you hold it in.  (Marcon, BTW, is being held 
May 13-15 this year.  For more details, see the convention listings 
section.)
     We've also got the beginnings of some new sections, with the second of 
our (hopefully) regular science pieces -- this one on "mind uploading", or 
transferring your mind, intact, to a computer -- and the addition of "mini-
reviews" to allow us to give you more reviews.  (As with the rest of the 
magazine, both of these sections are open to anyone.  If you're interested 
in doing mini-reviews or any other type of article, let us know!)
     So, having said that, let's get to some reader comments:

   "Keep up the same good work. No criticism of the present contents tho' 
    of course a lot of the spoilers are irrelevant for me (and other non-US 
    subscribers) cause we don't get the shows here - or are several seasons 
    behind but this is not something you can do anything about as besides I 
    imagine most of your subscribers are from the us.  I am quite impressed 
    by the WIDE range of topics that are covered in the issues from ghosts 
    to biosphere and more.  This catholic taste is, I think, a strength of 
    the zine. Perhaps one thing that could be added is the occasional 
    prose/poem. I'm sure there's plenty of budding writers out there - one 
    only has to look at the *.creative groups to see that! While the idea 
    of the zine does seem to be "news and views and humour" I would think a 
    bit of "more serious" fiction would enhance things.  I have seen such 
    format elsewhere & it does come across quite good. And before you 
    suggest it ..."Damnit I'm a chemist, not an author!" :) Alas to my 
    regret I can't help out there. :)"
                                                         ----  David Powell

[From the editor:  Interesting perspective on the spoilers.  I know that 
many of the serious fans here especially enjoy getting despriptions of 
shows that haven't aired here yet because it gives us a feeling of being 
clued in depite our not having seen the actual show.  
     As for fiction ... (sighs heavily from lack of sleep) ... it's a topic 
that's been brought up before.  There are just two problems:  First, this 
thing is so large already that it would either have to be VERY short 
fiction or it would have to wait until the time that we are up to speed 
with enough help to go monthly again.  The second problem is that ye olde 
editor barely has enough time to put this thing together in the first 
place.  Help in screening submissions would definitely be required before 
it could even be considered.  HOWEVER:  If there's enough interest in the 
idea, I promise to attempt to find the help and make it work.  This 
magazine belongs to the readers, too.  So if you'd like to see perhaps a 
story per issue, let us know.  Also let us know if you don't have any 
interest in the idea.  (We've also been tossing around the suggestion of a 
fiction contest, but again, only if people really want it.) ----  TJ]

WORLD WATCH:
     Since we have nudged over 1000 in direct subscribers, we thought we'd 
update the list of countries that are receiving CV.  We know we've got 
readers in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Costa Rica, England, Ireland, 
Spain, France, Belgium, Sweden, Iceland, Norway, Finland, Greece, Poland, 
Germany, Russia, South Africa, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Italy, Malta, 
Austrailia, New Zealand, Argentina, Austria, the Netherlands, Switzerland, 
and Slovenia just via Internet.  If you're reading this from another 
country, please let us know, either by electronic or regular mail.  We know 
there are more out there.
--------
On a personal note:  I'd like to take a moment to congratulate Debra and 
Matt Hisle on the birth of their son Timothy Lincoln on March 11, 1994.  
Debra has been with us since the very beginning, and we are thrilled to 
share her joy with all of you.

--!2!--   Travelling the Cyber-Highway with William Gibson
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           by Marisa Golini

     William Gibson was the science fiction success story of the early 
'80s, first with his stylish short fiction (much of it published in OMNI) 
and then with his first novel NEUROMANCER, which won both the Hugo and 
Nebula awards for best novel of 1983.  Gibson coined the term "cyberspace" 
-- referring to the world within computer communication -- and foresaw 
Virtual Reality and Information Networks years before they became the hot 
technologies of today. His vision of the future is a Bladerunner-esque 
hard-edged world where information is the most valuable currency.  However, 
he'll tell you he doesn't write about the future, he writes about the 
present with the "volume turned up."   Along with Rudy Rucker, Bruce 
Sterling, Lewis Shiner, and Pat Cadigan, Gibson was dubbed the leader of 
the "Cyberpunks", a label that stuck despite the fact that almost everyone 
it was applied to  promptly rejected it.  Gibson looked on much of this 
brouhaha with amusement.  He followed up NEUROMANCER with COUNT ZERO, a 
novel set in the same future but not a direct sequel, and with BURNING 
CHROME, a collection of short stories that put him in the spotlight.  MONA 
LISA OVERDRIVE completed the loosely-connected three-book series often 
referred to as the "Cyberspace trilogy" or the "Sprawl novels."  Gibson 
also recently rattled the snooty art-lit world with AGRIPPA (A BOOK OF THE 
DEAD), an expensive limited-edition book on computer-disc, booby-trapped to 
disintegrate when read.
     Gibson was born in Wytheville, Virgina. He now lives in Vancouver with
his wife Deborah and kids Claire, 10, and Graeme, 15. His latest book is
VIRTUAL LIGHT.
********
     It's just a typical day in the newsroom of a Rock radio station in
Canada's capital.  I've just finished doing my morning news run, and my
colleague is going through some advance copy hardcovers we periodically
receive for possible interviews.  Knowing I enjoy S.F., he says, "Got a new
Science Fiction book in.  Interested in interviewing the author?."
     "Maybe," I says.  "Who is it?"
     "Some guy named Bill Gibson.  Is he important?"
     I look up a little dumbfounded.  My collegue is not into S.F. at all 
so maybe I heard wrong.  "William Gibson?, " I ask.
     "Yeah, that's right," he says.
     I shrieked.
     Taking that as an affirmative to his original question, he phoned up
the lit. agent and we booked the interview.
     A few weeks later, Gibson ambled into the station ... about 45 minutes
late due his terribly crunched interview schedule, but I figured I had him
now and everyone else could wait ... so we settled in for a little chat.  I
really didn't know what to expect from Gibson.  In truth, I was afraid I'd
be faced with some intellectual elitist.  How wrong I was.  I found Gibson
witty, charming, laid-back, easy to talk with, and full of interesting
anecdotes -- all recounted with that delightful Virginian drawl.  Of 
course, he probably thought I was not your average interviewer -- what with 
my black garb, Docs, Bajoran earring and clutching a hard copy of AGRIPPA.
All in all, it made for a rather atypical, but certainly enjoyable 
interview....
***********
MG:  So what's up with this Cyberpunk revival?

WG:  Revival?

MG:  O.K.  Re-emergence.  Haven't you noticed?  It's been around for at 
least 10 years, at least since NEUROMANCER ... but as of late, TIME 
magazine does a cover story, local newspapers publish articles.  All of a 
sudden, it's something completely new ...

WG:  That's a good point.  I think 10 years ago it was a literary term you
used in pop culture analysis.  So initially you could say "these six guys
are writing cyberpunk science fiction" ... and then it sorta became "see 
that video, that's very cyberpunk" and then it got to the point you'd hear,
"man, those trousers ... those are way cyberpunk" ....So it became one of 
the colourations of 80's pop culture.  But I think the reason it's coming 
out now is becuz the meaning has changed.  So now if you did a dictionary
definition of cyberpunk, definition #1 would be something like "bohemia
with computers" or "the underground with computers".  It's the first time
the underground has *had* computers. I mean the 60's would've been really
different if all us hippies had had desktop publishing!

MG:  Techno rebels!

WB:  Yeah.  I think we may be headed for something like that, but it's 
gonna happen in the early 21st century.  People will probably look back 
from the mid-21st century at what we call cyberpunk, and see it sorta like 
the precursor phenomenon to whatever it is they're going through.

MG:  So you don't think [cyberpunk's re-emergence] has anything to do with
just more people using computers and therefore finding out about that
"scene"?

WG:  Well, there's that too.  But I don't think we're gonna see anything 
too drastic happen culturally around computers until the user-interface 
evolves to the point where it's easy to use.  I mean, the reason it's kinda 
sexy and far-out when you say "hey, I do a lot of e-mail" or "hey, I hang 
out on the Internet" -- the reason that has a kinda elite buzz to it is 
that the learning curve is still too steep.

MG:  Since this is a rock station, I have to ask you ... What do you think 
of these groups and artists such as U2, Donny Fagen and Billy Idol who say
that *you* have inspired their latest works?  Becuz, I know as far as U2
goes ... their Zoo TV tour was like something out of the dark and squishy
parts of your brain!

WG:  Yeah!  I was really happy with that!  I met them (U2) during both 
their stops in Vancouver.  How I came to their attention was the men who 
designed the "Steel Wheels" set for the Rolling Stones were working totally 
from my early fiction, and sold the "Steel Wheels" design to the Stones by 
giving the Stones my books and saying "read this, this is what we're gonna 
do."  I didn't know that at the time or I would've gone to see the show.  
Anyhow, the same company did "Zoo TV" and this time told me about it.  
Actually, one of the plans -- it didn't work out 'cuz I couldn't convince 
my literary agents to let them go ahead and do it -- but Bono suggested 
they should run the one of my novels on one of those electric light-bulb 
ticker tape screens...just run the text through during the course of the 
concert.

MG:  That would've been great!

WG:  Yeah ... anyway I've hung out with them and there has been some 
exchange of ideas.  We've been trying to figure out some way we can work 
together on something.
     With Donald Fagen ... after having so heavily larded my first novel 
with Steely Dan references, I was really delighted to find that he actually 
read them, and thought it was cool!  Early Steely Dan tunes have always 
been huge favorites of mine.
     Now, we come down to Billy Idol ...

MG:  Oh-oh ... and he's getting flamed on the .net ...

WG:  Oh god I just don't know!  I mean before I heard the album, I was
dodging the issue by saying "hey, don't worry about that ... the thing you
really want to worry about is Pat Benetar's album is called `Gravity's
Rainbow.'"  That's much, much stranger.  Why does Pat Benetar's new album
have the title of Thomas Pynchon's great underground classic?  That's
really weird.  GRAVITY'S RAINBOW is arguably a much more famous and
important book than "Neuromancer" ... at least Billy Idol didn't call his
album "Neuromancer".  I mean, what's next? Are we gonna have "Ulysses" by
Bel Biv Devoe?  (in psuedo-rap) `Yo Joyce! Man, the things he does with
language, it tore us up!' (big laughs) I don't know, it's a strange trend.
     Anyway, now I've heard the album ... and I just don't get what he's on
about.  I don't see the connection.  A London journalist told me when Billy
did his "Cyberpunk" press junket over there, he made it a condition of
getting an interview with him, that every journalist had to have read
"Neuromancer" ... Anyway, they all did but when they met with Billy, the
first thing that became really apparent was that Billy *hadn't* read it.  
So they called him on it, and he said he didn't need to ... he just 
absorbed it through a kinda osmosis.  I don't know.  I had lunch with Billy 
years ago in Hollywood and we were talking about the possiblilty of his 
acting in a film that someone was trying to make based on some piece of 
fiction of mine, and I thought he was a very likeable guy.  He had a sense 
of humour about what he was doing that is not apparent in the product he 
puts out.  If I run into him again, we can have a good laugh about what 
he's doing now!
     If you wanna hear a group that, to my mind, really does embody what
I'm doing ... there's a West German band called Plan B.  They sound like 
early Elvis Costello turned into rap music ... I've got them in heavy 
rotation!

MG:  Let's talk VIRTUAL LIGHT ... it's a different vision than your earlier
novels ... some people have said it's less bleak, more fun, and more
accessible.  Would you agree?

WG:  Wellll, I think it's less bleak if you read it in a certain way.  It's
a comic novel.  The intention is comic.  But comic doesn't rule out bleak.  
In the sense that Terry Gilliam's "Brazil" was a pretty funny movie -- but
*very* bleak.  I think the take on that is how you interpret the term "happ 
ending."  So if you think, O.K., he gets the girl, the bad guys get the
shaft -BUT- what have they bought into to get this to happen?  You can read
it both ways.

MG:  Yeah I guess so.  I also think it's really cool that one of your
protagonists is a bicycle messenger, and I like the whole idea of
information -- even in the hi-tech age -- still having to be carried around
by hand for security reasons.

WG:  Well, you can't fax a plane ticket!

MG:  It seems like it would keep you grounded ... that you still have to 
rely on the "pony express" so to speak.

WG:  Yeah.  Like the creepy guy from the Medellin cartel who gets his 
throat cut ... he's another kind of bicycle messenger.  He's flying around 
in a Concorde and staying in luxury hotels, but his job is to physically 
carry this piece of information.  Chevette's there because bicycle 
messengers, particularly in San Fransisco, are a really hot sub-culture.  
They've become a source for a lot of creative people.  Lotta people, like 
designers, are watching what bicycle messengers are wearing.  And they have 
their own bands ... here's places where messengers hang [out], and there's 
messenger fanzines!  I got everything I know about being a bike messenger 
from "Mercury Rising" which is a fanzine put out by the San Francisco Bike
Messengers Association.  There's this terrific coffeehouse near the Haight
called The Horseshoe where messengers hang and young people with lots of
tattoos and multiple piercing go there too ... and it's the only coffee
house I've ever seen where they've got laptop computers super-glued to
the tables.  Each computer has it's own e-mail address so you can go in, 
log on and do your stuff.  So these kids come in off the streets with bones
through their noses, their bodies covered in heavy Samoan blackwork, and
looking like extras out of the back streets of Bladerunner, and they sit
down and they do their e-mail!  The underground in San Francisco has 
mutated into a really astonishing thing.  And people haven't taken San 
Francisco seriously as a source for alternative culture for a long time, 
but I think they're gonna come back with a vengeance ... Just don't wear 
any flowers in your hair!

MG:  Obviously setting the novel so near in the future didn't restrict you
in any way ... the problem being with predicting things 10 years from now,
some of the beginnings of those changes have to be happening right now.

WG:  Actually one of the things that actually delayed the completion of the
novel was that I had to wait for the Soviet Union to formally collapse.  I
didn't quite realize at the time what I was waiting for ... But really, the
world of VIRTUAL LIGHT is just "now" with the volume cranked up.  It 
doesn't really say in the book that it's 2005...I think you can work out 
exactly when it is cuz you figure out when Rydell was born, etc.  But in 
the proposal that I sent to the publisher's, I mentioned 2005, and they put 
it in the flap copy which I wasn't entirely happy with, but I've sorta 
gotten into it now becuz people come in and say "hey that can't possibly 
happen now ... things can't change that much in 10 years", and I say "yeah, 
that's what they said in Yugoslavia."
(laughs)
     No really, a lot can happen in 10 years ... particularly as you near 
the end of the century and the millenium.  We're gonna see a lot of pretty 
wacky religious stuff come down, unfortunately.  I mean, we've already seen 
it.  That stuff in Waco weirded me out a little more than it did most 
people because I'd already written in that Sublett, the Texan from the 
video cult, was from Waco.
     The other thing I got really lucky with was Tommy Lee Jones. [In the
novel, Sublett tells Rydell that he reminds him of Tommy Lee Jones]

MG:  That's right.  He's really hot right now!

WG:  Yeah, cuz when I put that in, I did it just cuz I *love* Tommy Lee
Jones, but there weren't that many people who knew who he was.

MG:  Now [becuz of THE FUGITIVE] everybody knows who he is!  How the hell 
do you do that?! (laughs)

WG:  Oh I dunno ... just prescient I guess.(laughs)

MG:  But, a lot of the things you write about, at least to me, seem
perfectly plausible ... sometimes you really creep me out when I read this
stuff!

WG:  Well, you know it's funny, sometimes when I go to do interviews with
the press, an older interviewer will be both horrified and depressed by the
book.  One woman in Toronto said to me after the interview, "But is there
nothing you can tell me to give me hope?" (laughs) That's one response ... 
but then I saw some people being interviewed while standing in line for my 
book signing in Montreal and one guy said, "I can't wait to live in the 
world he's describing!  I wanna live in a Willam Gibson novel!"  But he was 
maybe 20, so there's very different responses.

MG:  Would *you* like to live in a William Gibson novel?

WG:  Well, not particularly ... but I'd like to go there for a vacation!
[At this point, the lit. agent was waving a watch at me thru the glass.  I
smiled and squeezed in a few more bits and pieces]

MG:  I guess we're running out of time, and there's so much more I wanted
to ask you including WILD PALMS ... and JOHNNY MNEMONIC -- is that still a
go?  Tell me that's still a go ...

WG:  Well, it's not *not* a go.  That's about as good as it gets.  I've 
seen some beautiful amazing sketches for the set designs.  If it happens, 
the production will be based in Toronto -- probably shoot the interiors 
there -- and the exteriors may be shot in some kind of industrial ruin in
Hamilton.  They'll dress up this old steel mill to look like a sort of
anarchist community hung under a bridge made of dozens of gutted Greyhound
buses.

MG:  So they could start filming within the year?

WG:  Yeah, if they're gonna pull it off at all, they'll have to start
shooting in late November.  It's got a chance to go, but my experiences in
Hollywood have been so depressing with things falling apart that I don't
like to say it's happening.

MG:  I understand, and I just want to mention that I read your ALIENS 3
script and I loved it.  It was so much better than the dreg we ended up
with.

WG:  Thank you. [My version] would've cost about 170-million dollars  to
film, so that was part of the problem ... a few thousand full-sized aliens 
on screen is asking for a bit much I guess!

[At this point I handed him my copy of VIRTUAL LIGHT *and* a hard copy of
AGRIPPA to sign...we had a good laugh over that.]

WG:  Hey, where did you find it [AGRIPPA]?

MG:  It's still on the Internet...just ask and you shall receive!

WG:  Really?  What I've sorta come to realize after the fact,  is *that* 
was the whole point.  Like, how else could you  guarantee that a 2000-word 
poem would remain on the Internet forever?  I *built* my daddy a monument 
in cyberspace!  I think that's cool!

MG:  It's very cool.

WG:  I recently got an edited 70-page version of what happened  [what was
posted] on the Internet after Agrippa came out.  It was very weird ... all
these messages started appearing from "W. Gibson"-- but they weren't from
me -- they were kinda manifesting with no return address.  And everyone was
saying I was mad -- but I *wasn't*!  Now I kinda know what it feels like to
*be* a UFO! (laughs)

MG:  Well, thanks a lot for chatting with me today.  I really enjoyed this.

WG:  I enjoyed it too.  Thanks very much.

     Stephanie Beacham went a long way around before landing in her current 
role as Dr. Kristin Westphalen on SEAQUEST.  Born and raised in 
Hertfordshire, England, she has run the gamut from the Royal Shakespeare 
Company and the National Theatre (with Sir Ian McKellen) to theater in Los 
Angeles opposite Charlton Heston to films with Marlon Brando and Michael 
Crawford to American television.  Once she got there she played Sable Colby 
on DYNASTY and THE COLBYS, then moved on the SISTER KATE, through various 
othe projects, and finally as Luke Perry's absentee mother on BEVERLY HILLS 
90210 before ending up playing the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Science 
Officer of the largest submarine in the world.
     So why does she have such a hard time accepting a woman calling her up 
to interview her for a science fiction magazine?  Oh, it's not that she 
wasn't nice about it -- far from it.  She's the epitome of grace, and quite 
possibly one of the nicest, most "real" people in Hollywood.  She just had 
one question for me as I explained the concept of CYBERSPACE VANGUARD to 
her:  "Now don't you think that's more boys' toys?"
     Boy's toys?
     "You know," she continues as I try to explain, "I dragged Ted -- you 
know, Ted Raimi [who plays Lt. J.G. Tim O'Neill on the show] -- I dragged 
Ted today, in the lunch hour, to my game, which is dolls' houses.  I 
completely blew his brains out.  He couldn't believe why people would do 
these things.  That's what I think of as 'girls.'  I don't think of 'girls' 
as science fiction people.  I always meet men who are interested in science 
fiction, not women."
     But why would that be?  For a moment she becomes introspective, soft.  
"I am not absolutely certain unless it goes along with an extended version 
of the knight in shining armor and the brave warrior and those 
stereotypes."
     Of course, most people in fandom know that there are plenty of women 
involved.  In fact, for some fandoms, such as QUANTUM LEAP, BEAUTY AND THE 
BEAST and HIGHLANDER, they seem to outnumber the men.  "Yes.  But that's 
because it's got more of the female archetypal stuff in it, which has to do 
with the fair maiden. I mean HIGHLANDER is 'hero' in the sense of WATCHING 
the knight in shining armor.  So it doesn't surprise me."
     She pauses for a moment before making her point.  "You give a little 
girl a stick and a piece of cloth and it will become a baby wrappped up.  
You give a little boy a stick and a piece of cloth and it becomes a gun, 
and a flag ... Do you see what I mean?  We forget all our conditioning, our 
basic, basic instincts.  BEAUTY AND THE BEAST doesn't surprise me at all.  
I don't think of that as science ficton, I think of that as fairy tale."
     She is definitely more drawn toward the fairy tale-type things.  
"Hardware just bores the life out of me.  People interest me totally.  
Hardware, software, whatever sort of ware it is, I find it completely ... 
cold.  Without interest."
     Strange words from an actor in such a technological role.  "I don't 
know if you've noticed it, but the science side I'm fascinated by because 
it's just so interesting to have a part that opens a whole new door to you.  
I mean, I've had to learn on my toes.  Qualified women interest me too.  
But actually, she's got quite a lot of humanity about her.
     Enough that she seems almost like a mother for the rest of the crew?  
"She is.  She's the ship's doctor, and I've often wished for more 
confidences from the cew.  Can you imagine if you're really stuck in this 
situation, away from home and family, how many times you would think you 
have a tummy ache and you really did have a tummy ache but what you really 
had was a sort of missing ... I think that a lot of the humanity has been 
missing from the show, and I think we're finding it rather late in the 
season.  I hope we will be given the opportunity to explore the people in a 
greater depth.  I do hope we go to a second season and can do that."
     SEAQUEST was originally considered a guaranteed hit, but initial 
ratings began to drop off as many fans because disenchanted with it.  
Rumors circulated that Executive Producer Steven Spielberg, busy with his 
triumphant SCHINDLER'S LIST, returned to find himself among the 
disappointed.  Staff changes were made, but the reports of mass firings 
were untrue.  "Oh, there've been SO many changes but we still don't have a 
single girl on board, a single woman on board.  I'm not talking about on 
board the ship.  We don't have a single writer-producer who's a woman, and 
I really say that not even vaguely from a feminist standpoint, just from a 
female perspective standpoint, which I think also then reflects viewers.  I 
mean, that LOIS AND CLARK business, apart from the fact that it's got Tracy 
Scoggins on it who's my best friend, is just plain silly as far as I'm 
concerned.  BUT, it's got romance, and the female audience, and we do push 
the button, likes a bit of romance."
     Ah, romance.  The topic that got the single largest number of reader 
questions.  Ms Beacham had the same question:  "Well I'd like to know what 
Westphalen and Bridger are up to. I wish they'd get on with it a bit."
     So do many viewers, so are they going to?  "Well, we're beginning.  
But I think it's too little and too late, really as far as this season is 
concerned, although last week's episode [with William Shatner] had a good 
step forward.  You know, sometimes when you work alongside someone you 
hardly notice them then you suddenly realize that somebody else fancies 
them and you look and you say 'Oh, my goodness me.  They are a bit, aren't 
they?'  And that's what happens to Roy [Scheider]'s character last week 
when somebody else wasy paying heavy interest to me.  He suddenly thought 
'Oh I feel a bit possessive about this one.'  And I thought THAT'S the way 
to go.  So I think it's sometimes DOES work like that.
     "The very last episode of this season will have a bit of that in it.  
But I think we should have got on with it earlier."
     But does that have anything to do with the lack of female writers, the 
difference between "boys' toys" and "girls' toys"?  "Yes I think it does, 
because I think our priorities are different.  Women like relationships."
     But if they succeeded in putting relationships into the show, wouldn't 
that put off part of the audience?  "Without a doubt.  You would be okay in 
that the environment is the biggest sub in the world.  But why should I 
care if the whole lot die or not?  I'm only going to care if the whole lot 
die or not if I care who's in it.  If you don't concentrate on your cast, 
if you don't concentrate on relationships between the cast ... I hate to do 
the old STAR TREK comparison, but you've always known who they are.  You 
know it?  So you can care."  But the show has an exceptionally large cast, 
and "that could be considered a problem."
     Among that large cast, the character of Dr. Westphalen is being held 
up as an example of a strong, competant woman -- a rarity in science 
fiction.  "Yes, and I'm delighted.  It's the one reasons I wanted the part.  
I really thought OK, so I've been one of THE most stunning examples of the 
selfish eighties, with Sable on THE COLBYS and DYNASTY.  And I'm 
particularly delighted to have worn so much coordinated jewelry.  Fabulous.  
But who do I want my daughters to be?  I don't want my daughters to be a 
woman who depends on a man.  A woman who works alongside a man, of course!  
A woman who appreciates all human beings, and I want them to be 
independant, certainly."
     But there are three sides to every story.  What do her daughters, too 
young to thing about that sort of thing, think of Wesphalen?  "They're so 
pleased that I'm not a b*tch.  I think they see this as being nearer to 
mommy."  On the other hand ...  "I think they think I've thrown the baby 
out with the bathwater as far as looks are concerned, that I don't need to 
look quite as dull as I do, but they're delighted that I'm playing someone 
who cares about humanity because they feel that's much closer to who I am.  
Although I have to say that Westphalen is much cleverer than I am.  She can 
throw out chemical analyses of things that I couldn't begin to.  I'm not 
saying that I was a bright science student at school.  I wasn't."
     Of course, she probably couldn't act as well.  The thought amuses her.  
"Yes, this is probably true.  But it's hard to act technical stuff.  You 
get away with it, but you don't act it.  You can only REact to emotional 
situations or caring situations where there's some feeling involved.  This 
is why I do think that humanity is what the show was GOING to be about, but 
somehow has missed the boat on.  I DO hope that we have time and audience 
to literally warm things up."

--!4!--   Getting Blown Up for Fun and Profit:  The Indiana Jones Epic
                                                          Stunt Spectacular
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     His name is Indiana Jones.  He travels the world, looking for
adventure, for treasure, for archaeological clues to history.  What he
generally finds, however, is trouble.  Being shot at, getting into fist
fights, even coming close to being blown up, are business as usual for him.
     But still, he gets to do it in exotic locales and pretty much always
makes it out in one piece, pushing the action from crisis into adventure.
And everyone wants adventure, right?
     Down in Florida there's a place where you can get close to the
adventure, feeling the heat of the explosions and hearing the bullets whiz
overhead, and if you're really lucky you can even fake the punches.
     That's right, FAKE the punches.  The place is the Indiana Jones Epic
Stunt Spectacular, part of Disney/MGM studios in Walt Disney World, and
"extras" are chosen from the audience to participate in some of the simpler
stunts.
     Two people who perform the dangerous stunts, such as running from a
400 pound boulder or an exploding fuel truck, are Todd Warren, who plays
the Indiana Jones role, and Michelle Waitman, who plays the Marion
Ravenwood role.
     Todd has been performing the role of "Harrison Ford's stunt double"
for about a year and a half.  He's an athlete, and went through college on
a full ride athletic scholarship.  Michelle's role involves a bit more in
the way of tumbling, which suits her fine.  A gymnast since the age of
eight, she thought she was auditioning for a simple tumbling role.  "I was
really surprised to find out I was auditioning for the girl!"  She's been
performing the role for four years.
     You will probably notice by this point that neither one of them is a
professional stuntperson, though their official occupation is "stunt
performer."  Both have been extensively trained.  Michelle was trained by
Glen Randall Jr., who was the stunt coordinator for the Indiana Jones
movies.
     Despite that fact that there is an "Indiana Jones" store right outside
--  no whips, for safety reasons, and not an accurate leather jacket in
sight -- this show is no cheap ripoff.
     The stage, which includes several different sets, some sectioned to be
moved out of the way, was designed with "a large amount of cooperation"
from Lucasfilm, which of course owns the rights to the Indiana Jones
character, and looks quite authentic.
     Included in the show is a recreation of the Nazi plane scene from
RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, complete with the ... attitude adjustment to the
German mechanic.  Both the plane and the fuel truck are in fact replicas of
those used in the films, and as such cause their own problems.  Since the
stage includes such accurate sets, film crews, such as those working in
Terry "Hulk" Hogan's new show, THUNDER IN PARADISE, often film there, and
restrictions are placed on what and where they can shoot.
     Those aren't the only restrictions placed on other crews.  Even if
they bring their own stunt coordinators, other productions can't perform a
single stunt unless it passes the rigorous requirements in place to protect
the actors.
     The requirements are by no means formalities.  Every stunt must pass a
triple check.  The first check is the Operations and Control Center, or
OCC.  Next it must be approved by the stage manager, Tim Maimone.  Besides
making sure that the stunt itself is safe and everything is working
properly, there are other things to consider.  For instance, today the
German mechanic was not hit by the plane.  Instead, Michelle and Todd had
to adjust their routine, with him falling out of the way and her shooting
the German from the cockpit of the plane.  Why?  Tim decided that there was
too much wind, and the smoke would not completely conceal the actor as he
dropped through a hole in the stage floor.  Because of this responsibility,
it takes a minimum of 3 months to train a new stage manager.  Finally, if
the actor feels uncomfortable with a stunt, he or she can call it off
without having to justify him or herself.
     Even with all the caution, however, accidents happen.  Things are
carefully planned, but they are still dangerous stunts.  Trucks are blown
up and flipped over, actors swing on poles 40 feet in the air, fall
off buildings ... it's an insurance agent's nightmare.  Michelle says that 
the usual injuries are ankles and knees.  Usually the audience doesn't even 
know what has happened.  Michelle has had her nose broken, "and nobody down 
there even realized it."  On the rare occasion that there is a more serious 
injury, the show has been brought to a halt, and if another cast member 
could be dressed and ready, the show has been continued when the injured 
party had been removed.
      Despite the occasional injury, after more than four years, Michelle
says she's not frightened of anything in the show.
     Todd feels that if anything, "it's an adrenaline rush when it looks
like something might be going a little bit wrong or if something doesn't
look exactly familiar."
     During the busy season, the stage hosts as many as 12 performances per
day.  It would be impossible for Todd and Michelle to do all those
performances themselves.  In fact, there are three "casts," each with two
Indy/Marion teams, who play the "Director of Photography" and "Casting
Director" respectively, when they are not performing the stunts.  This
allows them to limit themselves, never doing the stunts more than four
times in one day, and even that is a strain.  Altogether, the casts
coordinate the actions of 6 different performers.
     Often children write back after they have seen the show.  One boy,
Johnny Kenny, was so earnest about his desire to be a stunt person after
seeing the show that he was invited back and given a grand tour of the
stage and sets.  Everyone involved feels that it is "a rewarding
experience," and when the show is over, dozens of children inevitably
approach the stage for an autograph from "Indy."  So is there any pressure
in playing such a cultural icon?  Todd says "I always stress the fact that
I'm playing Harrison Ford's stunt double, rather than the character
himself."  Nevertheless, many of the younger children fail to grasp the
difference.
    Michelle doesn't have as much of a problem.  "They really don't care
about the girl."  She laughs.  "Seriously, though, it's quite an honor for
me."

--!5!--   Mind Uploading:  Downloading Your Brain to a Machine
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               by J. Strout

Introduction

     Progress in both neuroscience and computer technology has been 
advancing rapidly within the last century.  Researchers are currently 
working on building machines which imitate the functions of the human 
brain.  At the same time, computers continue to grow exponentially in 
storage and processing capacity.  These parallel developments suggest that 
it may someday be possible to reconstruct a complete human brain.  Such a
reconstruction, if done accurately, would possess all the memories, 
feeling, and dispositions as the original.
     The potential process of copying a brain into a functional
reconstruction is called "mind uploading" (or just "uploading" when the
context is clear), because the subject's mind is perceived to be 
transferred into a new machine, just as software is transferred to a new 
machine when uploaded to an archive site.  The possibility is exciting 
because it offers an indefinite lifespan, and great flexibility for 
adapting to other environments or purposes not foreseen by evolution.  
However, a number of serious issues must be addressed if uploading is to be 
taken seriously.

Overview of neuroscience

     The information-processing capabilities of the brain (and the rest of
the nervous system) arise from an intricate network of specialized cells
called neurons.  Neurons have long branches (axons and dendrites)
connecting them together.  The sites of the connections are called
synapses, where the electrical signal of one cell is converted to a
chemical signal which reaches the other cell.  In general, the operation of
a neuron is relatively straightforward.  The various input signals from
other cells change the neuron's electrical potential, either raising it or
lowering it depending on the type of synapse and chemical messenger used.
When the neuron's potential reaches a certain limit, it fires an electrical
output signal, which propagates down its axon to all the other cells to
which it connects.  While the operation of a single neuron is fairly
mundane, amazing tasks can be accomplished by networks of such cells, as
has been amply demonstrated by researchers in artificial neural networks.
     Of course, this brief description does not do justice to the great
complexity and variety of neurons and supporting structures of the brain,
but it captures the essence of neural function.  What makes one neural
network different from another is the pattern of connections.  Indeed, much
of the current research in artificial neural networks attempts to devise
ways of setting the connections though training.  Other researchers use
fixed connections based on the morphology of networks found in simple
animals.  Our own brain patterns are a combination of genetics, experience,
and possibly chance.  Through experience, connections are established,
destroyed, or changed in strength.  The pattern of connections in the brain
is believed to store all of your memories, skills, hopes, and fears, as
well as the innate circuitry which (for example) enables you to convert
visual input into a three-dimensional representation of your environment.
Mind uploading will depend critically on duplicating the connections among
neurons in the brain.
     Another factor to consider is the role of extracellular influences in
the brain.  In addition to cell-specific signals, some neurons release
chemicals diffusely into the extracellular fluid, which affect the
operation of neurons in the area.  This includes hormones from the body as
well, which can have pronounced behavioral effects.  Hormones are also
thought to be vital to emotions such as fear, anger, or joy.  While
probably not critical to the operation of the brain, diffuse chemical
influences will have to be simulated accurately if the uploading process is
to retain the full effect of being human.
     Finally, some notion of the size and number of neural structures is
needed to estimate how much processing capacity will be needed to store or
simulate the nervous system.  Table 1 presents some very broad estimates;
take these numbers as orders of magnitude rather than specifics (which are
still unknown for many of these levels).

----------------------------------------------------

Uploading procedures

     The most plausible uploading procedure requires, somewhat regrettably,
destroying the brain very thoroughly.  The technique, reconstruction from
serial sections, involves slicing the brain into extremely thin sheets, to
be scanned and reassembled as data in a computer.  The process has been
used on a much smaller scale for years, to determine the morphology of
synapses and local circuits.  The technology needed for uploading is far
more advanced, but essentially the same in theory.  I will attempt to
illustrate the proposed procedure with a plausible scenario.
     A hospital patient is pronounced metabolically dead -- that is, his
heart and lungs have stopped and do not respond to resuscitation.  The
patient is kept on artificial life support while the cryonic equipment is
prepared.  Then, surgeons carefully perfuse the patient's body with
fixating agents, remove the head, and freeze it solid.  This part of the
procedure is similar to that currently in use by cryonics organizations,
but the goal here is not long-term storage -- rather, it is merely to
forestall decay and keep the brain structures rigid for the scanning
process.
     When the head has been thoroughly frozen, it is placed in an uploading
machine.  This machine automates what would otherwise be arduous or
impossible.  Starting at one side of the head, slices (less than .001 mm
thick) are shaved off one by one.  With each slice, the exposed cellular
structures are scanned by high-resolution instruments (e.g., electron
microscopes).  Relevant neural structures are identified and recorded by
the computer (a nontrivial but tractable task).  Although most of the
volumes of information in each slice can be discarded or simplified, the
database from a single patient would still immense by today's standards.
     When the patient's brain has been entirely scanned, the data is loaded
into an artificial brain and body.  The peripheral nervous system is
assumed to be relatively standard, so that the patient's peripheral
circuitry can be replaced with "generic" peripheral circuitry with little
inconvenience.  As soon as the artificial brain has been configured with
the patient's brain patterns, the upload is activated.  The patient, after
overcoming some initial disorientation, leaves the hospital feeling young
again.
     This scenario is not as outrageous as it may seem at first glance.
There are two theoretical hurdles.  First, and most serious, it will be
necessary to determine the exact type of each synapse so that the effect of
one cell on another can be duplicated.  This may not be recoverable from
morphology alone -- it may be necessary to detect certain classes of
chemicals in both the sending and receiving parts of the synapse.  Thus
microscopy may have to be combined with other techniques (e.g.,
spectroscopy) to obtain all the relevant information.  The second hurdle is
simply processing capacity -- the brain is enormous when examined at such a
tiny scale, and today's technology is dwarfed by the demands of the task.
It is easier to imagine handling the data of, say, a nematode, which has
only a hundred or so neurons; indeed, such a small network could be easily
simulated by many of today's computers.  For an insect, the technology
needed would be a bit more advanced, and for a mouse, far greater -- but
still much less than that needed for a human.  But computing capacity has
been growing in an accelerating manner, and what is possible on a small
scale will soon be possible on a larger scale as well.  (Note that because
neurons act only on information that is available locally to them, the
difficulty of simulation is only linearly proportional to the number of
neurons.  This means that uploading will not suffer from the exponential
scaling of some other classes of problems.)  Moreover, it is assumed that
the simulation task will not be done by a general-purpose computer, but
with specialized hardware designed for the job.

Nature of artificial brains & bodies

     When considering the prospect of an artificial body, many people
picture the clumsy mechanical character C-3P0 from the film STAR WARS.
While early bodies may indeed be crude (C-3P0 would be a technological
marvel by today's standards), the social and economic pressure for more
natural, human bodies would surely be strong enough to inspire rapid
innovation.  Within a few decades, it seems likely that artificial bodies
will be casually indistinguishable from natural ones. This will probably
involve technologies currently beyond speculation, but it may still be
helpful to highlight some of the current research which may prove useful
for uploading in the future.
     For muscles, currently popular techniques -- hydraulics, pneumatics,
and motors -- seem inadequate.  Muscles are needed which can contract very
quickly and strongly but still with fine precision, and if they can also
mimic the structure of human muscle, so much the better.  Researchers
working with so-called "smart polymers" seem on the right track; these
polymers can expand and contract to a variety of stimuli, including the
application of an electric current.  Bundles of polymer fibers,
appropriately connected to artificial neurons, may be attached to an
artificial skeleton in the manner of natural muscles.  This would give the
upload smooth, natural movement and a familiar body structure.  Smart
polymers even seem suited to such versatile and important muscles as the
tongue.
     Among the senses, vision may be considered the most important, but not
the most difficult.  The anatomy of the eye and functioning of the retina
are fairly well understood, and attempts at duplicating it are already
making progress.  Hearing is likewise fairly straightforward.  Touch, on
the other hand, is vitally important and least explored in current
research.  The artificial skin will need dense receptors for pressure,
temperature, and pain.  Internal senses (e.g., of limb position) will work
in a similar manner.  Finally, taste and smell will be highly demanded,
though it might be argued that uploading could be a success without them.
Taste and smell will probably depend on smart polymers as much as the
muscles.
     The artificial brain may be quite unlike the artificial computers of
today; the circuitry will probably need to be three-dimensional to
accommodate the rich pattern of interconnections.  Progress has recently
been made in growing three-dimensional semiconductor "dendritic trees,"
which the researchers suggest may be useful for constructing neural
networks.  More exotic possibilities include the optical computer, which
enjoys the advantage of connections crossing without interference, and the
quantum computer, with elements so small that quantum mechanics plays a
role in their operation.  Whatever technology is used, the artificial brain
will be extremely complex, but probably also compact, durable, and
efficient.

Conclusion

     When space travel was merely science fiction, the idea was opposed by
some very thoughtful writers, who pointed out that travel in space would
never be possible since there is nothing to push against.  The concept of
uploading faces a similar situation now -- as a strange new idea in its
infancy, it is sometimes opposed by well-meaning thinkers who work from a
misunderstanding of the brain.  At this point, there appear to be no
genuine theoretical problems with uploading; the difficulties are merely
technological, and as such, will be overcome if the current pace of
progress continues.  Uploading technology will have profound effects on
humanity and society, and the complex issues which will arise should be
explored soon -- for within a century or two, uploading may be upon us.

--!6!--   The Business Side of Conventions:  Building a Better Hotel 
                                                               Relationship
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            by Steve Schwartz

     Getting (and especially keeping) a hotel that is right for your 
convention is very important, particularly when you want to ask them to 
allow you to do something they normally wouldn't let you get away with.  
There are things you can do to build rapport with your hotel's convention 
sales, catering, or convention services staff, and most of them aren't 
difficult.
     Opening negotiations will set the tone for your entire duration there, 
so getting off on the right foot is important.  Many people go into their 
first meeting with the idea that they will try to get away with as much as 
possible to save money.  I reccommend that you stay entirely above board 
with every aspect of your dealings, however, as they will eventually find 
out the truth, and then you are doomed to failure.  Sneaking in extra food 
and/or beverages or alcohol to avoid corkage fees or high costs is not a 
way to build trust with your hotel.  The usual fear is that the hotel won't 
understand the foibles and quirks of our attendees, so discussions about 
people wandering the halls at three in the morning, weird costumes, or 
impromptu late night filks are avoided.  An example of full disclosure 
avoidance is with our relaxacon called NECROCON.  One hotel never fully 
realized what a "convention" was, and exactly how weird things could get.  
After the convention, they decided that we must all be in league with the 
devil, and refused to have us back ever again.  If we had explained exactly 
what to expect, we would most likely have been OK.
     Always be certain to find out before it is too late what the hotel 
expects.  If they are only used to business conventions, they need to be 
educated; but if they have had Shriners in before, everything will probably 
be all right.  If they have restrictions about weapons (stage or 
otherwise), pets, costumes, alcohol, etc., be certain to make your 
attendees aware of them before they arrive.  Ferrets, swords, rayguns, and 
semi-nude bodies are very fannish; but particularly bad if the hotel 
doesn't approve.  From a noise viewpoint, you want to be certain the hotel 
blocks your rooms together so as not to bother "mundanes."  If your 
convention has room parties, make certain that all parties involved know on 
what floor they should be held.  I maintain that if the hotel understands 
what to expect up front, they will agree to most reasonable requests.  For 
example, with our science fiction and fantasy convention, MARCON, the Hyatt 
Regency places no restrictions on weapons, or costumes, as long as they 
remain in our convention areas.  The trade-off is to ask our attendess to 
cover up their bodies, and their weapons, in the "public" areas of the 
hotel such as the lobby, elevators, restaurants, etc.  It is important that 
we abide by their rules, so we instruct our operations/security people to 
handle any problems, before the hotel even becomes aware of them.  I can't 
stress enough how important these simple words are.  Marcon has moved up to 
the largest hotel in the Columbus, Ohio area, and will be taking over the 
entire space available there starting with Marcon 30 in May 1995.  We would 
not be where we are now if we had ignored any of these points.
     To make your life simpler, you will want to set up a "corporate 
account" with your hotel.  They will want some sort of credit information, 
which shouldn't be too difficult to produce.  After you set up your 
account, it will be much easier to arrange guest rooms, food functions, 
alcohol purchases, etc.  Otherwise, you will need to pay as you go, ar at 
best pay up by the last day of your event.  The corporate account number 
will also make you seem more professional to your guests, especially at 
check-in and Guest of Honor meal functions.
     In most states, hotels cannot restrict what you are allowed to do 
(within state laws) in the privacy of your rightfully rented hotel room(s).  
Most hotels will, however, have "in-house" rules regarding "official" 
function spaces that are difficult to get around.  For example, many of 
them will want to charge you corkage for beverages, or cater your food 
functions themselves.  You must get them to let you bring in some basics 
(i.e. dry snacks, nuts, soda, etc.).  With Marcon, we started out getting 
approval to bring in some "donated" snacks and beverages.  Each year the 
list expanded and we were able to get more items to bring in, until they 
eventually lifted all non-alcoholic restrictions.  We now have our consuite 
in what used to be a hotel restaurant/lounge, and all with the Hyatt's 
blessing.  A hotel will most likely never allow you to bring in your own 
alcohol for your consuite, due to legal restricitons and liabiligy issues.  
We end up buying our beer and wine directly from the hotel.  However, we've 
been able to get the price lowered to an affordable figure by explaining 
that we don't have a corporate expense account (i.e. begging and 
grovelling).  Sometimes offering them a food function, such as a banquest 
at your guest of honor speeches, will justify having them lower your hotel 
food and beverage bill.
     There are many other things to consider that will make your convention 
affordable.  One is to have the hotel adjust your convention room rate up a 
dollar or two, and use that as a credit toward your hotel bull.  With 
enough attendees, this could be a sizable amount.  Another important aspect 
of keeping costs down is selling room nights for your hotel.  All hotels 
have a scale by which you can get free or significantly lowered function 
space or consuite room nights based on the number of attendees who buy 
rooms there.  Most use the ratio of one free hotel room night for every 
fifty you sell to your attendees.  These are free rooms you can use for 
guests or small functions.  You might also get the hotel to give you free 
suite nights by offering them two or three of your comlementary room nights 
in exchange.  For additional space your hotel will want to charge you based 
on the square footage of the function space you need for your events.  A 
part, or even all this function space should be complementary.  The 
percentage of the hotel's function space you get free will likely be based 
on a ratio of the hotel rooms you sell compared to the hotel's capacity.  
Be certain to get this scale placed into the contract, so everyone 
understand the rules.  For these reasons, the most important thing for your 
convention's continuted existance is to sell hotel rooms for your host 
hotel.  Always be certain to ask attendees to be loyal to your hotel, and 
mention your convention to get the preset "con rate".  Stress to the hotel 
that you are doing everything in you power to help them.  In most cases 
they will even give you stacks of pre-printed envelopes to send to your 
attendees with your progress report(s).  Then "at con", follow up by asking 
the hotel for a list of all names of in-house guests during your stay.  You 
can check this list against your membership list to be certain of getting 
full credit on your bill.  Methods such as these help your con budget go a 
little further.  In actuality you are spreading part of the cost to each of 
your con attendees without having it hurt as much as a higher membership 
rate.
     Two or three months out from your convention you will want to meet 
with your representative.  Make room layouts for any function spaces so 
they will know in advance where you want tables, chairs, podiums, water 
setups, trash containers, etc..  Work out a schedule for picking up trash 
and filling water setups you can both live with.  This is especially 
important for the more complex events and room change-overs.  Staff will 
want a resonable time to change room layouts, usually 1.5 to 2 hours 
minimum.  Also stress which setups are the most critical, or must be set up 
before other things happen.  That way the hotel can bring in extra staff 
and schedule them wisely.  Consider that the spaces you need most will be 
for the dealer's room and art show, which take additional setup before 
being ready to open.  The hotel will appreciate all of your efforts when it 
comes time to setup your function spaces.  There will ALWAYS be some 
problems, but if you prepare properly you will certainly minimize them.
     Finally, remember to be very nice to the important people you deal 
with at your hotel.  I try to be certain that they get to meet any guests 
in which they have an interest, and offer other perks like con T-shirs, or 
"excess" consuite provender.  We encourage any hotel personnel to come in 
and observe what we do.  Operations is instructed to allow anyone with 
their hotel ID badge in.  This way they can see we are a legitimate 
organization.  We also schedule a meesting between the key staff member 
both organizations the night before the con starts.  Seeing faces and 
ironing out last-minute problems is easier then than it is during the 
hectic hours that start your event.  Lastly, we schedule a meeting after 
the con, so problems that cropped up at the con can be dealt with while 
facts are still fresh in everyone's minds.  Then thank you letters and 
small gifts to key hotel staff members complete the process.  Believe me, 
it is worth the trouble if you want to keep your hotel happy with you.
     Rumors of bad dealings and hotels throwing conventions from our 
special interest group out do not help things.  By following these general 
rules, more hotels will see the benefits of holding a reasonably profitable 
and mostly trouble-free event.  The more wide-spread the belief becomes, 
the easier it will be on all of us.  Above all else, please realize that it 
doesn't hurt to ask for something from the hotel; you might even get it.

                    GREEN MARS by Kim Stanley Robinson
        Bantam Spectra, ISBN 0-553-37335-8, 1994, 535pp, US$12.95.
                     A book review by Evelyn C. Leeper
                      Copyright 1994 Evelyn C. Leeper

     This is the second book of Robinson's "Mars" trilogy.  The first was
last year's Hugo-nominated RED MARS, and the series will be finished with
the upcoming BLUE MARS.  (I should mention again that while Robinson's
novella "Green Mars" appears to take place in the same future history as
this series, it is not a part of this novel.)
     GREEN MARS, it must be said, suffers from the same flaws and
difficulties as most middle-of-a-trilogy novels.  It does not start at the
beginning, nor does it go through to the end.  While RED MARS can be read
as a stand-alone novel, GREEN MARS cannot.  You must know what happened in
RED MARS for GREEN MARS to make any sense or have any meaning.  (I would
really have appreciated a brief glossary of major characters and political
groups -- my memory of the details of RED MARS has faded over the
intervening year.)
     There is also (to my tastes) far too much technical discussion of
terraforming and areology, particularly in the first half of the book.  For
example, on page 148 Robinson writes: "The surface of the glacier appeared
to be extremely broken, as the literature had suggested -- mixed with
regolith during the flooding, and shot through with trapped carbonation
bubbles.  Rocks and boulders caught on the surface had melted the ice
underneath them and then it had refrozen around them, in a daily cycle that
had left them all about two-thirds submerged.  All the seracs, standing
above the surface of the glacier like titanic dolmens, were on close
inspection found to be deeply pitted."  (By the way, a regolith is a layer
of loose rock material resting on bedrock, a serac is a large mass of ice
broken off the main body of a glacier and remaining behind in a crevasse
after glacial movement or melting, and a dolmen is a prehistoric megalithic
[large stone] structure consisting of two or more upright stones with a
capstone, typically forming a chamber (which doesn't actually sound like
what the seracs would look like, but what the heck).  All definitions
courtesy of the AMERICAN HERITAGE DICTIONARY.)  I could be wrong, but I 
also think that the discussions on pages 175 through 187 and elsewhere of 
the poisonousness effects of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are confusing 
it with carbon monoxide.  While inhaling large amounts of carbon dioxide 
can cause death by suffocation, it is not poisonous in the usual sense of 
the word, and it is not clear to me that in an atmosphere with a certain
percentage of oxygen it matters whether the remainder is nitrogen or carbon
dioxide, at least as far as human respiration goes.  (Though the
atmospheric pressure would be important -- consider the possible
side-effects of nitrogen to deep-sea divers.)
     This may all seem terrible technical and nit-picky, but the book lends
itself to that so well that is should be somewhat expected.
     It is only in the second half of GREEN MARS that Robinson returns in
force to the political and historical aspects of the series.  While one may
argue that the key event that triggers the "phase change" of GREEN MARS's
final chapter is totally arbitrary, there's no denying that historical
triggers often are.  Still, I have to reserve final judgement on GREEN MARS
until BLUE MARS concludes the series, and then see if GREEN MARS serves its
purpose in the overall picture.  That is the only way to view this book and
much as I want to see Kim Stanley Robinson finally get a Hugo, it makes no
sense to look at this as a possibility.  (I mention this because this had a
British edition in 1993, and hence would be eligible for the Hugo awards
for last year, to be given at Conadian this September.  I note this just to
clarify its eligibility for anyone who does want to nominate it.)

EMPIRE'S END by Allan Cole & Chris Bunch
Del Rey Science Fiction, ISBN 0-345-37696-X

EMPIRE'S END is the eighth and final Sten adventure.  If you have not read
any of the previous adventures, especially the immediately preceding novel
(VORTEX), you will probably not appreciate this book -- though I would
suggest trying the first novel of the series, STEN.  If you have been
following the series and enjoying it, this book is definitely consistent
with what has come before and you will not be disappointed.  We have all
the standard stuff -- narrow escapes, space battles, willy guns, and
infiltration that you expect packaged up in a moving tale that even has a
message -- what more could you ask.  But Bunch and Cole should probably
write a cookbook soon and get it out of their system. -- David Gibbs

THE SUN THE MOON AND THE STARS by Steven Brust
Ace Fantasy, ISBN 0-441-79099-2

If you only like to read fantasy (or sf) you should probably avoid THE SUN
THE MOON AND THE STARS as, despite the labelling, this book is definitely
not fantasy.  It tells the story of a group of young "starving" artists who
have setup a studio together, focusing especially on the protaganist, Greg
Kovacs and his thoughts while attempting the largest canvas he has yet to
attempt, interleaved with a traditional Hungarian folk tale that Greg is
relating to his friends, and some discussion on the question of "what is
art?".  This book is well written, and well told, all in all an excellent
work of fiction, it just isn't fantasy. -- David Gibbs

--!8!--   The Infamous Reply Cards and What You Said
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           by Linda E. Smit


     With the latest team just beginning their experiment in Biosphere 
living, the answers we received to our last response card question are 
interesting.  Only eighteen responses were returned, but they all seem to 
be carefully considered answers. While nine readers said "no," six said 
"yes."  Two people said "no and yes" and one said he just wasn't sure of an 
answer.
     The responses really fell into three categories.  There were 
unequivocal yesses, unequivocal nos, and several "depends."  I felt like I 
was playing a game of Scruples(TM) with all the variations on why people 
would/would not go, according to the situation.
     The major reason for not participating in a Biosphere-like project was 
time taken away from family or a relationship.  One respondent said he'd go 
if his wife could go as well.  Another said his children are too young for 
him to leave them for such an extended period of time.
     Yet, some of the people unwilling to do Biosphere said they WOULD 
participate in a trip to Mars or live on a space station. Several folks 
said they could understand the importance of learning how to live in a 
closed system in order to colonize other planets--they'd just rather wait 
until there was something more to get out of the experience.
     And one of the "yes" responses emphasized the difference between 
Biosphere and a space project: 

          "It would certainly be a challenging and 'interesting' time
     (whether or not 'interesting' would fulfill the idea of that
     ancient Chinese curse. :))  Since however, we are talking about
     a hypothetical biosphere 3 (or greater), I would see the question
     are referring to two types, another earth-based biosphere project
     or a 'real' space based biosphere.  I think that the scientific
     value of an earth based biosphere has been well & truely
     established so the challenge & the scientific value would not be
     as great.  Not that I wouldn't consider the offer, but I wouldn't
     'leap' at it (needless to say, I would probably say yes.)  On
     the other hand, if the project would be in space (either in 'deep
     space' or on a planet/moon/etc then I would literally kill to
     get in.  The challenge and the scientific value would go without
     saying, and besides, I would do almost anything to get into
     space.  :)  So where do I sign up?"

     And I asked the same question.  Where do I sign up?  The yes responses 
recognized the difficulties encountered by people in a closed system, but 
decided that the advantages outweighed the disadvantages.

          "I would take the opportunity because it would be a great
     chance to learn about yourself and how to deal with others.
     Living in such a closed environment would be very challenging
     and getting along with the inevitable cliques that would ensue
     would be a learning experience.  I doubt such an effort would
     always be enjoyable but it would be an unique experience."

     And I feel the same.  I think living in a closed environment, whether 
it be Biosphere, a space station, or a spaceship would be an incredible 
learning experience.  For a writer, it would be an experiment in patience 
and veracity.  It would be an adventure that would not only teach you about 
other people, but also about yourself--things you might not ever learn 
otherwise.

(If you new Biosphere folks are reading this--good luck to you!)

BABYLON 5 NEWS
....................
by David Strauss

     The first season of BABYLON 5 has begun, and viewers all over the 
country have buckled in for what's sure to be an entertaining ride.  The 
first few episodes of the first season were designed as a slow introduction 
to the projected five year story arc, but as the season moves on, we'll be 
seeing the overall arc become more prominant in individual episodes.
     Ratings for B5 have exceeded Warner Brother's anticipations.  The show 
has ranked each week in the top 20 syndicated shows, with higher ratings 
than TIME TRAX and KUNG FU: TLC.  The decision on whether BABYLON 5 gets 
picked up for a second season will be made in late-April.  If you like what 
you see, be sure to contact your local station that carries B5 and let them 
know you'd like it to continue.
     The big news on alt.tv.babylon-5 lately has been discussion over the 
creation of a Babylon-5 rec group, entitled rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon-5.  
Voting completed March 18, and the results will probably be known between 
the time this column was written and the new issue was released.
     Filming for the first season of B5 completes on March 23. Several 
episodes still have major post-production work required, especially the 
ones with long CGI sequences.  New episodes will probably be run during 
April and May, with a summer of mainly reruns, so that the final run of new 
episodes will be shown during the November sweeps, including the season 
finale, "Chrysalis."
     Several veteran actors will appear later in the season, including JUNE 
LOCKHART and THEODORE BIKEL.  (For a list of other actors who will be 
appearing in the first season, see the issue 2:1 of CV.)  Also look for a 
soundtrack album by CHRISTOPHER FRANKE, possibly as early as this summer.
     If you'd like to learn more about the BABYLON 5 universe, a recent 
cover story in the magazine CINEFANTASTIQUE would be required reading, 
although it does contain some spoilers about the first season.  (The guide 
to first season episodes is also severely outdated.  The spoilers included 
in this issue of CV are far more current.)  The best net.source for 
BABYLONJ5 information is the FTP site at ftp.hyperion.com, or its faster 
echo at ftp.uml.edu.  Included there are various text files with background 
information, episode guides, synopses, and even early drafts of a fan-
produced tech manual.  For the more historically minded, there's files on 
the history of ancient Babylonia, which the show's creator, J. MICHAEL 
STRACZYNSKI, has mentioned as giving hints to the direction of the B5 story 
arc.
     On a personal note, your author is proud to say he became one of the 
first members of the B5 fan community to have a character named after him 
in a BABYLON 5 episode.  Just watch "The Parliament of Dreams" and listen 
for a reference to the (unseen) waiter at the Fresh Air restaurant.  That's 
me. ;)  
....................
And a note from BABYLON 5 creator Joe Straczynski:

     If I can put a word out onto the electronic web ... usually, in the 
network shows, a series runs its course, and at the end of the season, the 
network decides whether or not to renew.  Because of the schedule of PTEN, 
the decision to renew or not comes in April/May.
     While the ratings are good -- mention of the B5 ratings got a headline 
in today's "Hollywood Reporter" along with ST -- there's a new wrinkle in 
the situation.  The new Paramount Network.  They're making deals with 
stations as fast as they can, snatching up the independent stations and 
trying to secure the few remaining available timeslots (which with the glut 
of programs now are continually growing smaller in number).  So for a 
station, it's a choice between two or more shows that might rate equally 
fine, but there's outside pressure.
     Point being this (and anyone who wants to upload this entire message 
to other nets, feel free): if -- IF -- you genuinely enjoy the show, and 
would like to see it renewed, this would be a very good time to drop your 
local TV station a letter indicating this.  The stations have a direct 
input as to whether or not shows are renewed.  It certainly couldn't hurt.

                                                            jms

HIGHLANDER NEWS
....................
by Debbie Douglass

     I am happy to report that main unit filming for "HIGHLANDER III: THE 
MAGICIAN" was completed in Montreal in February. Location work is now 
proceeding in Japan, Australia, and Scotland. Sorry, no release date 
information is available at this time.  One minor correction to the cast 
listed in the last issue: The female lead will be DEBORAH UNGER.
     Well, it looks like CHRISTOPHER LAMBERT will finally realize his dream 
of breaking-in to Hollywood studio films. Despite his international box 
office draw (HIGHLANDER II, KNIGHT MOVES and FORTRESS collectively earned 
$150 million overseas in contrast to the disappointing performance of a 
total of $30 million in the U.S.)  he will temporarily abandon his normally 
high fee to work for Universal Studios in the film KIRINA (aka CORINA or 
KORINA) in April.  LAMBERT will be working for scale plus 10%.  JOHN 
LAWTON, who wrote "Pretty Woman," will be directing this tale of an 
American in Japan pursued by assassins. Lambert fans shouldn't worry 
though. H has already committed to doing FORTRESS II for 20th Century Fox 
for fee befitting a superstar. FORTRESS II is expected to start production 
late this year in Australia. Even though I have enjoyed all of his previous 
films, I hope that maybe one of these days we'll see our favorite actor in 
a film using his lovely native accent again.
     Attention Diet Pepsi fans: MEILANI PAUL, one of the Uh-Huh girls (and 
wife of Highlander star ADRIAN PAUL) will have a guest role in "Counterfeit 
Part I", the first of the two part season finale for Highlander: The 
Series.
     HIGHLANDER:  THE ANIMATED SERIES was announced at the New York Toy 
Fair last month scheduled to premiere in September '94. Previously released 
information describes the scenario for the series set far in the future, 
following a Holocaust, where much of civilization has crumbled. None of the 
current characters from film or TV will be featured.  Accompanying the 
announcement was a display of an animated hero with ponytail, leather 
boots, blue tights, padded shoulders, spiked shield, broadsword, and puffed 
sleeves posed in front of Gothic-style ruins. Shall we get in line for our 
action figures now? ;-)
     Please help us ensure that Highlander is picked up for a third season. 
Write Keith Samples, C/O Rysher TPE, 3400 Riverside, Burbank CA 91505 with 
comments about what *you* like about Highlander. Also write your local 
station to encourage them to keep Highlander on their schedule.

STAR TREK NEWS
....................
by TJ Goldstein

     As ST:TNG draws to a close, old favories are returning.  "Genesis" 
will see the return of Barclay (DWIGHT SCHULTZ), the second to last episode 
will include Ensign Ro (MICHELLE FORBES) despite past denials -- and 
Patrick Stewart will direct that episode -- and "Journey's End" will see 
the return of Wesley Crusher (WIL WHEATON), The Traveler (ERIC MENYUK), and 
several of the more minor characters, such as Jack Crusher and Admiral 
Necheyev.  
     "Journey's End" will feature the forced relocation of an American 
Indian group from the planet they have settled.  This is significant 
because one of the characters mentioned for ST:VOYAGER is a member of this 
group.
     As for movie plans, according to convention reports, the TNG movie, 
STAR TREK: GENERATIONS will see appearances from only three of the original 
cast members, WILLIAM SHATNER, JAMES DOOHAN, and WALTER KOENIG.  They will 
appear in only about 20 minutes of the fim.  LEONARD NIMOY has refused to 
appear in the film because he doesn't like the script, but there is no word 
on whether the ohter TOS cast members are absent from the film by their 
choice or the studio's.  The film will go into production at the start of 
April, immediately after STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION finishes filming.
     And in related news, Disney's "Action Friday" series of cartoons will 
reportedly include GARGOYLES, featuring the voices of JONATHAN FRAKES and 
MARINA SIRTIS, according to TV GUIDE.

OTHER TV NEWS
....................

FROM THE EDITOR:  It's letter writing season in the science fiction 
universe, as shows battle to keep themselves on the air.  General hints for 
conducting a letter writing campaign were carried in Volume 1, Issue 2 of 
CV, but we thought we'd add two more:  
     First, write to and call your local stations, especially if the show 
is in syndication.  A syndicated show's fate is determined by how many 
stations buy the right to air it.
     Second, write to your newspapers.  That right, newspapers.  A 
television columnist for a major newspaper was mentioning to ye olde editor 
that she had to turn down an interview with one of the stars of an sf show 
for the simple reason that they weren't getting any letters about it.  So 
look for the television columnist in your local or national newspaper, 
think of a question relating to whatever show it is you're trying to save, 
and send it in.  You'll give the columnist an excuse to give it some press.

Contrary to rumors, SEAQUEST has not been cancelled, nor has the decision 
as to whether to carry the show next year been made, at least as of 
March 24, 1994.  Cast and crew are still hoping and expecting to be renewed 
for next year, according to spokesman Vic Heutschy.

ROBOCOP has hit the small screen in syndication -- and not cheaply, either. 
Skyvision Entertainment bought the rights from Orion and decided to take 
him back to his roots, spending $36.5 million (yes, thirty six and a half 
MILLION dollars) on the production.  Robocop creators EDWARD NEUMEIER and 
MICHAEL MINER wrote the premiere and set the tone for the show.  Instead of 
the ultra-violent Robocop that has lately been seen on the big screen, this 
is a Robocop struggling to regain his humanity.  Added to the universe is 
Gadget, a twelve year old orphan adopted by the Sargeant, Diana, who is 
"the ghost in the machine" -- a woman who was murdered so her brain could 
run the huge computer network that controls the city, and Commander Cash, 
and animated mascot for Omni Consumer Products (OCP) who will appear in 
each episode to extol the virtues of consumerism and advertise the 
wonderful things OCP brings the citizens of Detroit.  The show stars 
RICHARD EDEN ad Robocop, YVETTE NIPAR as Officer Lisa Madigan, BLU MANKUMA 
as Sgt. Stan Parks, SARAH CAMPBELL as Gadget, ANDREA ROTH as Diana Powers, 
and DAVID GARDNER as the Chairman of OCP.

According to USA today, DEAN CAIN will be starring in an action thriller 
his father, CHRISTOPHER CAIN (YOUNG GUNS) is directing.  USA TODAY also 
carries an interview with L&C producer DEBORAH JOY LEVINE on which she 
reportedly say that the "vibes for renewal are good."  There had been a 
letter to the editor of a comics magazine claiming that the show had 
already been cancelled, but this is absolutely not true.  (Letter writing 
wouldn't hurt, though, of course.)

PHYLLIS COATES and JAMES EARL JONES will be appearing in the two-part 
season finale of LOIS AND CLARK.  Coates, who played Lois in the original 
SUPERMAN television series, will be playing Lois's mother.

Frustrated by the abrupt end of ALIEN NATION?  Relief is in sight.  Fox is 
making ALIEN NATION:  DARK HORIZON, a two hour television movie that will 
re-tell the story of the last episode, solve it, and take up a plot where 
those who enslaved the Newcomers in the first place return to re-take their 
slaves -- and the human race.  The original television cast will return.  
It will air later this year.

Another round of QUANTUM LEAP videos are due out, but the fate of future 
releases depends on pre-orders.  That's right, whether or not other videos 
will be released reportedly depends on how many people ask for this batch 
before they actually arrive in the stores.  In fact, in order to count, 
they need to be pre-ordered before April 6.  The episodes that will be 
arriving April 20 are "The Leap Home (parts one and two)", "Jimmy", "Shock 
Theater", and "Dreams".  DEBORAH PRATT reportedly told guests at Quantum-
Con that "Dreams" will have never-before-seen footage.

In other QL news, stymied in efforts to get radio stations to play SCOTT 
BAKULA'S version of "Somewhere in the Night," Crescendo Records is taking 
advide and repackaging the single with less QL oriented artwork.  
Apparently adult contemporary stations, which normally would play it, were 
put off by the heavy QL emphasis.

Fox has bought 65 episodes of THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN for Saturday morning 
cartoons and 20 more episodes of X-MEN.  Genesis Entertainment is making an 
hour-long cartoon which for the first year will feature Iron Man and the 
Fantastic Four, which will supposedly be closer to the original comics.

STEVEN SPIELBERG is attempting to obtain the rights to DR. WHO in order to 
produce an American version of the show.  Nothing is definite and a new 
Doctor has not been chosen, even though some rather large names have been 
bandied about.

MOVIE NEWS
....................

WILLIAM GIBSON's JOHNNY MNEUMONIC will finally be making it to the big 
screen.  Based on the short story of the same name, KEANU REEVES will play 
Johnny, a man with stolen Yakuza information stored in his brain trying not 
to get killed by DOLPH LUNDGREN.  Probably because of her place in the 
sprawl novels, the character of Molly Millions could not be used, and has 
been replaced by Jane, played by DINA MEYER.  She's basically the same 
character, however, as "we've stuck very close to the original story, and 
Mr. Gibson is VERY involved with the project.  He's written the screenplay 
himself," says unit publicist Wendi Laski.  She couldn't quote a budget 
figure but says that "the sets look spectacular."  The film is being 
directed by ROBERT LONGO, and ICE-T will play Dog.  Tri-Star will 
distribute it in the U.S., and MDP in the rest of the world.

In other news from the brain-implant front, the low budget film CYBERTEENS 
IN LOVE is the first recipient of Canada's "Next Wave" competition.  The 
film, which stars JUSTINE PRIESTLY and MARTIN CUMMINS, is the first project 
to use Sony's new Digital Betacam format, which allows it to be output in 
either 35 mm film format or in a 4x3 aspect for television.  It's directed 
by BRETT DOWLER for Shadowface Productions in accosciation with British 
Columbia Film and The National Film Board - Pacific Centre.

If you've got a copy of the laserdisk of WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT, hold onto 
it.  Disney animators reportedly had a little fun, figuring that nobody 
would catch on if they played with a frame or two.  Rumored to be available 
to those with a laserdisk and freeze-frame:  a full frontal nude shot of 
Jessica Rabbit, an explicit sexual encounter, and, of all things, Disney 
chief MICHAEL EISNER'S home phone number.  Known to be present are three 
frames where Jessica's dress is flying and her underwear is missing.  
According to newspaper reports, 100,000 copies of the disk were originally 
pressed, and Disney, which says that since the film was technically put out 
by subsidiary Touchstone it was not subject to Disney's rigorous standards, 
will probably not re-press the film without the offending frames.

LOU BUNIN, best known for his 1951 classic ALICE IN WONDERLAND, which 
pioneered film puppeteering techniques,  died February 17 of a stroke.

KURT RUSSELL and JAYE DAVIDSON will be starring in STARGATE.  Filmed in 
Yuma, it's a high budget film about Marines "warped" into a futuristic 
desert planet.  From Carolco.

Faced with a proposed law requiring ratings for video games, the industry 
promised to institute a voluntary rating system that would label the sex 
and violence content of games going to marked after November 1 and 
"submitted by publishers in a timely fashion," Jack Heistand, chairman of 
the industry group charged with coming up with the new ratings system said 
in newspaper reports.  Congress is not prepared to drop the bill, however, 
until the system is firmly in place.

JOHN CANDY (SPACEBALLS, LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS, 1941) died March 4 of a 
heart attack.  He was nearing the end of filming WAGONS EAST with RICHARD 
LEWIS in Mexico.  He was 43 years old.

JON PETERS, producer of BATMAN and creator of Polygram Pictures, is heading 
back to Warner Bros. after a stint as co-chairman and producer at Sony 
Pictures.

Loch Ness researchers, far from being happy with the famous 1934 photo of a 
sea serpent poking its head out of the water, were actually relieved this 
month to find out that the whole thing was in fact a fake cooked up by a 
self-styled big game hunter hired to find the monster after the first 
sighting in 1933.  According to newspaper reports, one of the last living 
co-conspirators confided in researchers from his deathbed that it was 
actually a model serpent's head on a toy submarine.  Apparently the photo 
contradicted other research into Nessie, so researchers are glad to find 
out it's a fake.  In early March the Inverness Tourist Board announced that 
early April would see the beginning of tourist trips beneath the surface of 
Loch Ness for those who wanted to look for the monster.  According Reuters, 
they will ride six at a time for $105(US) in a specially adapted research 
sub.  

There is talk of a fourth RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK film, but there's just 
one problem.  Although HARRISON FORD has said in interviews that he would 
be willing for the right script, director STEVEN SPIELBERG has been riding 
the wave of seriousness generated by his magnum opus, SCHINDLER'S LIST, and 
has said that he couldn't go back to easy films right now.  In fact, he 
only got to do the film at all by promising to make JURASSIC PARK first in 
case just such a thing happened.  Spielberg told Reuter that "I can't make 
a musical or a western or a sequence to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK.  I just 
could not do this now."  He plans to "take a year off and think about my 
life and my career."

TriStar is reportedly making a film out of the original FOUNDATION TRILOGY 
by ISAAC ASIMOV.  Directed by JEAN-JAQUES ANNAUD (QUEST FOR FIRE), it is 
due out either in late 1995 or summer of 1996.  If it does well they plan 
to make fims out of the other books.

Some upcoming horror films:  RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD PART III, CANDYMAN 
II, HELLRAISER IV, and another NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, reportedly dealing 
with time periods between other films.

According to the Helper's Network Hotline, Spelling Entertainment is 
looking into the possibility of a movie based on BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.  
Fans are urged to send their support of such a venture to Spelling 
Entertainment, attention: Marcia Basichis, Senior Vice President of 
Development, 5700 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90036.  The phone number 
for the Helper's Network Hotline is 513-961-3317.

Those who have bemoaned the absense of a Robin to the cinematic version of 
BATMAN may or may not be happy with BATMAN III.  There's going to be a 
Robin, all right, and open casting calls are being held around the country 
looking for him.  But BURT WARD he won't be.  Director JOEL SCHUMACHER is 
reportedly looking for someone a bit tougher.  Avenues they are exploring 
besides the usual include reccommendatons from gang liasons and parole 
officers.

     FREEDOM OF THE PRESS. Does your small-press magazine review horror 
books or movies?  Just watch it.  PAUL BARNETT explains: "In mid-February 
John Gullidge, editor of SAMHAIN, was stitched up in the WESTERN MORNING 
NEWS and EXETER EXPRESS & ECHO in the wake of the seizure elsewhere in the 
country of whole stacks of video nasties; according to these papers, 
SAMHAIN was little more than a trading ground for such stuff and the police 
were about to swoop.  The E&E also made a jolly link-by-proximity (as a 
tag-on piece) between John's activities and the Jamie Bulger memorial 
service, with a good plug about how the judge had said it was all caused by 
CHILD'S PLAY 3 -- but nothing, of course, about the police refutation of 
that claim.
     In fact SAMHAIN rarely even mentions video nasties (as opposed to 
legit horror movies) except in passing, and enjoys excellent relations with 
the trading standards people, who feel that John's conduct of the magazine 
is -- so far as their interests are concerned -- exemplary. The E&E knew 
this but didn't bother to mention it; the WMN did not know it because 
they'd omitted to do any in-depth research such as ringing John up (a 
failing which they pathetically described as "no one was available for 
comment"). With the true instinct for integrity in journalism, neither 
paper deigned to print a letter from him correcting these and other errors 
of fact; and John doesn't feel he can either sue or go to the Press 
Complaints Commission because some of his other activities rely on 
reasonable relations with these formerly sycophantic slime-buckets.
     The net result is that as far as the local population is concerned, 
there is a Monster in our Midst. John is getting ill treatment in the 
streets to the extent that he goes out as little as possible; several 
parents have withdrawn their kids from the Woodcraft Folk group of which he 
is playleader, and he's been summoned to an extraordinary meeting to be 
confronted by them; etc. The whole thing makes me see red. Grrr!"
     The above was faxed to both papers for comment. None as yet.

CECELIA HOLLAND has finally read William James's SUNFALL trilogy, noted 
here last year as bearing a Curious Resemblance to her 1969 historical 
novel UNTIL THE SUN FALLS.  Ms Holland seems to agree, in an incandescent 
letter which we may publish after she's taken legal advice. Latest rumour: 
devotees of her mediaeval novels THE EARL (in UK, A HAMMER FOR PRINCES) and 
GREAT MARIA may also find happy memories in the pages of SUNFALL.

JOHN HOLM, Harry Harrison's collaborator on THE HAMMER AND THE CROSS, is 
(unsecretly) Tom Shippey.  His minor billing may not reflect his share of 
the novel: one pundit reckons it's "90% Shippey."  Yet the US Tor edition 
omits "Holm" entirely....

JACK KIRBY died on 6 Feb. ROB HANSEN writes: "Born Jacob Kurtzberg, Kirby 
was one of the true giants of the US comics industry. Starting in 1935 with 
newspaper strips, he developed a repertoire of techniques that by the time 
of his Marvel Comics work in the 1960s had given his artwork unparalleled 
power and dynamics. For better or worse, Kirby established the visual 
grammar of superhero storytelling; his influence was immense. He created 
CAPTAIN AMERICA with JOE SIMON in 1941, but will be most widely remembered 
for his ground-breaking 1960s work on FANTASTIC FOUR, THOR, INCREDIBLE 
HULK, X-MEN, etc."

TERRY PRATCHETT, in an astonishing reversal of expectations, won the BCA 
Fantasy & SF Author of the Year Award (latest addition to the commercially 
oriented British Book Awards).

CARL SAGAN disliked Apple's use of "Carl Sagan" as internal nickname for a 
planned computer. Insider sources now add that he chiefly objected to the 
company of sister projects named Tesla, Piltdown Man and Cold Fusion. Thus 
the machine briefly became the BHA, for "Butt-Head Astronomer" ... only to 
be renamed, in short order, the LAW: "Lawyers Are Wimps".

HELEN SHARMAN, Astro-OBE, will present the Arthur C.Clarke Award on 20 
April: Kennedy Room, Irish Centre, Murray St, Camden. 6pm for 7:30. MC: 
Geoff Ryman. More data: David V.Barrett.

BRUCE STERLING heard from a Brit who got a job in telecomms after reciting 
large chunks of THE HACKER CRACKDOWN at his interview: "Suggested 
promotional line for the sf audience of the 90s: 'Read Bruce Sterling and 
actually get a job'."

THE DEAD PAST:  Almost remembered US fan Tom Perry has a squib on HEINLEIN 
in Damon Knight's MONAD #3 which may outrage the easily outraged. Tracking 
down the 30's political activity which RAH kept so dark, Tom finds it was 
(by US standards) left-wing: erstwhile socialist Upton Sinclair's "End 
Poverty In California" platform.  The "moderate Democrat" story told to and 
published by Jerry Pournelle seems untrue in numerous details. Tom wonders 
if RAH suppressed this innocuous-seeming data in fear of Nixon and McCarthy 
(whose investigations he ironically "saw little wrong with"), since EPIC 
links could be taken as evidence of "un-American activities". Was this why 
Heinlein was touchy until death about his 1941 Worldcon speech, threatening 
legal action in 1973 when the text -- arguably in the public domain -- was 
reprinted through the well-meaning efforts of FORREST J ACKERMAN?  Its 
second paragraph approvingly mentions Sinclair-as-politician, you see....

TOO GOOD TO CHECK. "A fan of HITCH-HIKER was in a bar with a friend who 
worked in a nut house. The fan happened to use one of the HHG tag-lines 
("Here, put this fish in your ear" or something) and the shrink jumped up 
saying, "WHAT?!"  Seems they had a guy locked up who would only respond to 
questions with HHG bits; since a lot of psychos have languages all their 
own, and no-one who'd dealt with this guy knew HHG, they were going nuts 
themselves trying to decipher him." [NR] Just needed a fish in the ear, 
really.

AMAZING STORIES suspended publication after appearing since 1926; current 
owners TSR may have it redesigned. [_SFC_]

OTHER WRITTEN SF
....................

The new generation of STAR WARS fans (ie, anybody who's not old enough to 
have seen it in the theaters originally) will finally get to read the 
original spin-off novel, SPLINTER OF THE MIND'S EYE, by ALAN DEAN FOSTER, 
when it's released this month by Del Rey.  KEVIN ANDERSON'S book STAR WARS: 
JEDI SEARCH debuted in the top ten, and the week of March 9th it was number 
two on the PUBLISHER'S WEEKLY list.  Anderson, who keeps up with the 
Fidonet SW echo, took some time to thank net.fans for their support.

Del Rey has also contracted with bestselling author R.A. Salvatore, best 
known for the Forgotten Realms Dark Elf novels THE STARLESS NIGHT and THE 
LEGACY, for three fantasy novels, beginning the the summer of 1996.

ORSON SCOTT CARD has finally finished the Homecoming Saga.  THE SHIPS OF 
EARTH, the third book, is out this month, EARTHFALL, the fourth, is due out 
in January 1995, and the fifth will be out the following May.  Having done 
that and turned it in to Tor, according to Tor editor Patrick Nielsen 
Hayden he will now work on the fourth Alvin novel.

ROBERT ANTON WILSON, author of more than 20 books including the 
SCHRODINGER'S CAT trilogy and THE ILLUMINATUS! trilogy (with ROBERT SHEA), 
died February 21 of an apparent heart attack.  He was 63.

DIANE DUANE will be writing a SPIDER-MAN novel for Byron Preiss Visual 
Communications.  Due out in spring of 1995, it will NOT be a novelization 
of the upcoming Spidey film.

NESFA 1993 Hugo Recommendations
For a second year, the New England Science Fiction Association (NESFA) is 
maintaining a list of Good Stuff to read. Any NESFA member who reads 
something that they would like to recommend to others to be considered for 
a Hugo nomination can add it to the list.  We will publish it from time to 
time in Instant Message and on the nets. (Feel free to reproduce it 
provided you reproduce it intact!) It's neither definitive nor complete, 
but it contains the stories, novels and non-fiction works that a bunch of 
well-read fans feel may be worthy of a Hugo nomination.

SF IN FRENCH AND FRENCH SF NEWS
....................
by Jean-Louis Trudel

     The Winter SF season saw a batch of new and interesting books come on 
the market.  In Canada, the new Sextant imprint of Quebec/Amerique was 
launched with the publication of Elisabeth Vonarburg's alternate history 
novel LES VOYAGEURS MALGRE EUX (The Reluctant Travellers)  and of Joel 
Champetier's horror novel LA MEMOIRE DU LAC (The Memory  of the Lake).  
Both novels have Quebec settings, and Champetier's novel is reportedly 
doing well in the stores.  Novels by Jean-Pierre April and  Francine 
Pelletier are expected to appear under the same imprint, perhaps  by the 
end of the year.
     Canada's francophone SF authors continue to find an outlet in young 
adult fiction.  Last Fall, in addition to Stanley Pean, there was Michel 
Belil who ventured into the field with a fiction collection called LA 
GROTTE DE TOUBOUCTOM (The Cave of Toubouctom).  This Spring, Jean-Louis 
Trudelis turning out his first young adult novel, ALLER SIMPLE POUR 
SAGUENAL(One Way Ticket to Saguenal), for the Editions Paulines of 
Montreal, which is also releasing a fantasy novel at the same time, by 
young veteran JoelChampetier:  LE SECRET DES SYLVANEAUX (The Secret of the 
Sylvans).
     On the magazine scene in Canada, SOLARIS 108 offered up interviews 
ofQuebec author Jean Dion and of French illustrator and artist Jean-
YvesKervevan, whose beautifully gruesome art graced the issue's cover.  
Therewere three stories:  "La derniere orbite" (The Last Orbit) by new 
authorPierre Dion, "Contamination" by Jean-Louis Trudel, and "Les 
yeuxtroubles" (Misty Eyes) by Claude Bolduc.  Dion's short story, about 
anincident involving a space station, the Space Shuttle, and the Russians, 
would not have been out of place in an American SF magazine like ANALOG.  
My own story focused on aliens defeated by humans and dealing with human 
tampering with their reproductive system.  Bolduc's story was his best so 
far, a suspenseful tale of terror about a man's possession by another.
     The latest issue of IMAGINE..., numbered 66, included stories by 
Frenchand Canadian authors.  The best was by Harold Cote, who crafts in 
"M8v"(not a stellar classification, but a planetary designation) a 
quiteclassical SF story, with a mystery that has to be solved rationally.  
On the other hand, Claude Bolduc's "Rouge" (Red) is a rather banal vampire 
story and Thierry Di Rollo's "Le Grand-Mainate" (The Great Mynah) seems 
somewhat pointless, as the tale of two ill-fated explorers meanders to 
itsend.  Quite cleverer is Jean-Pierre Guillet's "Dodo!" (Sleep!), a 
gadgetstory with a soft horror twist ending.  In the same issue, 
DanielleTremblay's serial "Pas de paradis sans... l'enfer" (No Paradise 
without... Hell) continues with a second episode devoted to a young man's 
initiationinto a New Age version of Starfleet Academy...
     In France, the most prestigious imprints which still include novels 
byFrench authors are put out by Denoel.  Last October, it re-issued 
anotherclassic SF book, ODYSSEE SOUS CONTROLE (Odyssey Under Control) 
byStefan Wul.  In November, it published Serge Brussolo's new MANGE-
MONDE(World-Eater) and TERRITOIRES DE L'INQUIETUDE 7 (Lands of Anxiety7), 
an anthology of fantastic/fantasy edited by Alain Doremieux and gathering 
stories by American and French authors.  The French contributorswere Jean-
Pierre Andrevon, Richard Canal, Jean-Claude Dunyach, andRaymond Milesi, all 
well-known names in French SF.  
     Finally, in January, Denoel put out one French SF novel, LES 
PERSPECTIVES DU MENSONGE (The Perspectives of Mendacity) by newcomer Yves 
Ramonet, and one French fantasy novel, LA MORT PEUT DANSER (Death Can 
Dance) by veteran Jean-Marc Ligny.  The difference in experience shows.  
Ramonet's novel wanted to set a hectic, helter-skelter pace through 
variousrealities, but winds up being chaotic and boring.  Ligny's novel, 
inspired by the alternative musical group DEAD CAN DANCE, is modern 
fantasy, shifting between the story of Forgaill in twelfth-century Ireland 
in the time of the Norman invasion and the story of a group called DEATH 
CAN DANCE in twentieth-century Ireland.  It's entrancing, it's the best 
novel I've read  from Ligny, and it's one of the best French fantasy novels 
I've read.  It has the warmth and the personability of the works by Charles 
de Lint and Emma Bull, but it also has the maturity of the greats like 
Robert Holdstock and John Crowley. 
     The other major French SF line is the Fleuve Noir Anticipation.  One 
recent novel there is ARAGO, by Laurent Genefort.  Despite some inventive 
flashes, it's essentially a vacuous and gratuitously violent quest story, 
set on a colony planet of Earth.  
     French SF novels from J'ai Lu are rarer, but L'HISTRION (The Buffoon) 
by Ayerdhal ranks as their principal effort of the last months of 1993.
     Finally, in Switzerland, the House of Elsewhere, a museum of 
sciencefiction and fantasy, is presenting its "Alien & Heidi" exhibit of 
SwissSF art until April 24.  On May 1st, it will launch its 
"Parapsychologie"exhibit on ESP in SF, which is scheduled to last until 
October 23.The House of Elsewhere, better known as the Maison d'Ailleurs, 
is located in the Swiss town of Yverdon-les-Bains, North of Lausanne.

Japan Report
............
by David Milner

     GODZILLA VS. MECHAGODZILLA recently completed its run in Japanese 
theaters.  The film was very successful, but it did not do quite as well as 
last year's GODZILLA VS. MOTHRA.
     The twenty-first Godzilla film is scheduled to be released in Japan in 
December.  It tentatively is going to pit Godzilla against both an updated 
version of Mogera, the giant robot that appears in THE MYSTERIANS, and 
"space Godzilla," a monster somehow created from the remains of the one 
brought to life by the combining of cells from Godzilla, a woman and a rose 
in GODZILLA VS. BIOLLANTE.  The baby Godzilla introduced in GODZILLA VS. 
MECHAGODZILLA also will be in the film.
     Toho's special effects crew recently completed work on MONSTER PLANET 
- GODZILLA, a 3D ride featuring Godzilla, Mothra and Rodan that is 
scheduled to open at the Sanrio Puroland amusement park located just 
outside of Tokyo in the middle of March.
     A concert featuring music written by Akira Ifukube for a number of the 
Godzilla films was held near Osaka on November 23rd.  The orchestra was 
conducted not by Ifukube, but instead by Masaru Sato, who scored GODZILLA 
RAIDS AGAIN, GODZILLA VS. THE SEA MONSTER, SON OF GODZILLA and several 
other monster films.  A CD will be released in Japan sometime during the 
summer.
     Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio, the two people who wrote the script for 
Walt Disney's ALADDIN, have completed the script for TriStar's upcoming 
Godzilla film.  The film reportedly will be directed by Alex Cox, whose 
credits include REPO MAN, SID & NANCY, STRAIGHT TO HELL and WALKER.  
Shooting is scheduled to get underway in May. 
     Toho has announced that it will release LEGEND OF JAPAN, a film 
loosely based on the 1959 epic JAPAN BIRTH, in Japan in July.  Previews for 
the film featuring a few shots of the Yamata no orochi (hydra of Yamata) 
have already begun running in Japanese theaters.
     It has also been announced that GIANT MONSTER DECISIVE AIR BATTLE 
GAMERA will be released in Japan in March or April of 1995. It is going to 
pit Gamera against Gaos, the giant vampire bat seen in both GAMERA VS. GAOS 
and GAMERA VS. GUIRON.
     Due out within the next few months are new Godzilla games for the 
Super Nintendo Entertainment System, the Turbo Duo and Gameboy.  All three 
feature Godzilla battling a number of other monsters. Also in the works for 
the SNES is a game called MILO VS. GODZILLA.

"Miracle Man" -- When several inform and crippled people mysteriously die 
after being tended to by a young faith healer, Mulder and Scully fly to 
Tennessee to investigate his ministry.  Have the young man's miraculous 
healing abilities turned from good to evil?  Or is he a charlatan with a 
murderous bent?

"Fire" -- When several of Britain's top politicians die suddenly in 
mysterious fires, high level scurity is called for to protect the prime 
minister who is thought to be the next target.  Mulder's old Oxford flame, 
now a Scotland Yard detective, enlists his and Scully's help to look after 
the minister and his family while they are on vacation in the U.S.  Mulder 
must confront his own fear of fire when they uncover that fact that the 
assassin posessed startling pyrotechnic abilities.

"Shapes" -- Mulder and Scully travel to a small Montana town to investigate 
the shooting death of a young Native Indian man.  the rangers who killed 
the Indian insist they were shooting at a wild animal which Mulder believes 
to be a Manitou -- an evil spirit that can change a man's body into that of 
an animal.

"Beyond the Sea" -- After two North Carolina students are kidnapped by a 
serial killer, Scully and Mulder seek the aid of a convicted killer 
awaiting execution who claims his psychic powers can help them rescue the 
teenagers before they are killed.  When the convict's clues establish 
several key facts about the identity and whereabouts of the killer, Scully 
must weigh her own skepticism of psychic abilities against the startling 
accuracy of the information.

                           THIRD SEASON  1961-1962

TWO ***
Writer/Director: Montgomery Pittman
Cast: Elizabeth Montgomery, Charles Bronson, Sharon Lucas  
In this contemporary Adam and Eve story, the two lone, frightened survivors 
of a nuclear holocaust must start the world afresh. 
LW: Golly, we got the other half of "Bewitched", Elizabeth Montgomery 
    (Samantha) herself.  Strange how so many people from TZ episodes went 
    on to work together in the late 60's. Or maybe not so strange when you 
    consider the relationships built up with MGM and other studios over 
    this period.

THE ARRIVAL ***
Writer: Rod Serling                     Director: Boris Segal
Cast: Harold J. Stone, Bing Russell, Robert Karnes, Noah Keen, Jim Boles, 
    Robert Brubaker, Fredd Wayne  
The aviation administration is completely baffled by the appearance of a 
mysterious empty airliner - until an examiner poses the unlikely but 
apparently sound theory that the craft is imaginary. 

THE SHELTER ****
Writer: Rod Serling                     Director: Lamount Johnson
Cast: Larry Gates, Peggy Stewart, Michael Burne, Jack Albertson, Jo Helton, 
    Joseph Bernard, Moria Turner, Sandy Kenyon, Mary Gregory, John McLiam  
When a possible nuclear attack is announced, several suburban friends and 
neighbors are reduced to selfish, vicious animals in a struggle over one 
family's bomb shelter.
LW: A strong cast (including Jack Albertson) lend power to this dramatic 
    story of emotions and fears running wild during a yellow alert.

THE PASSERBY **
Writer: Rod Serling                     Director: Eliot Silverstein
Cast: Joanne Linville, James Gregory, Rex Holman, David Garcia, Warren 
    Kammering, Austin Green  
A company of Civil War soldiers who believe they are marching home from 
battle soon come to realize that they are actually dead.

A GAME OF POOL ****
Writer: George Clayton Johnson          Director: A. E. Houghton
Cast: Jonathan Winters, Jack Klugman  
A young pool player finds himself playing against a long-dead master pool 
shark.  The stakes: his life.
LW: A good one.  Klugman and Winters are the only actors onstage at any 
time 
    during this powerful and well acted episode.  

THE MIRROR **
Writer: Rod Serling                     Director: Don Medford
Cast: Peter Falk, Tony Carbone, Richard Karlan, Arthur Batanides, Rodolfo 
    Hoyos, Will Kuluva, Vladimir Sokoloff, Val Ruffino  
In the state offices of an overthrown government, a revolutionary leader 
uses a mirror reported to possess strange powers - it can show the viewer 
the face of the person who will kill him.
LW: An interesting role for Faulk.  The segment is really not terribly 
good. 
    The country is obviously a thinly obscured representation of Castro's 
    Cuba.

THE GRAVE ***
Writer/Director: Montgomery Pittman
Cast: Lee Marvin, James Best, Strother Martin, Ellen Willrad, Lee VanCleef, 
    William Challee, Stafford Repp, Larry Johns, Richard Geary  
When a gunman scornfully defiles an outlaw's grave, he sees the man's dying 
threats come true.
LW: Not a bad cast for a TZ!  Not a terribly good story, but well done 
    nevertheless.

ITS A GOOD LIFE ***
Writer: Rod Serling                     Director: Jim Sheldon
Cast: Billy Mumy, John Larch, Cloris Leachman, Tom Hatcher, Alice Frost, 
Don 
    Keefer, Jeanne Bates, Lenore Kingston, Casey Adams  
A rural community is held terrorized by the unearthly powers of a young 
boy.  
Based on a short story by Jerome Bixby.
LW: Billy Mumy and (a relatively young) Cloris Leachman playing on TZ.  Will 
    wonders never cease?  This is an interesting episode, particularly since 
    Serling had to spend the first five minutes setting up the basic premise 
    of the story by using a U.S. map and individually introducing us to the 
    main characters!  If you have ever read the classic story of the same 
    name by Bixby, you will know why this was necessary.

DEATHS-HEAD REVISITED **
Writer: Rod Serling                     Director: Don Medford
Cast: Joseph Schildkraut, Oscar Beregi, Chuck Fox, Karen Verne, Robert 
    Boone, Ben Wright  
A visit to a concentration camp at Dachau forces a former Nazi to confront 
the horrifying ghosts of his ghastly wartime crimes. 
LW: A well-meaning episode, but rather poor in overall quality.

THE MIDNIGHT SUN ****
Writer: Rod Serling                     Director: Anton Leader
Cast: Lois Nettleton, Betty Garde, Jason Wingreen, Juney Ellis, Ned Glass, 
    Robert J. Stevenson, John McLiam, Tom Reese, William Keene  
The Earth is being slowly drawn into the sun, causing drought, devastating 
heat waves - and panic.  This episode features an outstanding musical score 
by Van Cleave.
LW: A fine episode.

STILL VALLEY ***
Writer: Rod Serling                     Director: Jim Sheldon
Cast: Gary Merrill, Ben Cooper, Vaughn Taylor, Addison Myers, Mark 
Tapscott, 
    Jack Mann  
A strange book presents the Confederate Army with a difficult choice: they 
can win the Civil War - but they must make a pact with the Devil.  Based on 
a short story by Manley Wade Wellman.

THE JUNGLE **
Writer: Charles Beaumont                Director: William Claxton
Cast: John Dehner, Emily McLaughlin, Walter Brooks, Hugh Sanders, Howard 
Wright, Donald Foster, Jay Overholts, Jay Adler  
A contractor who has violated certain African lands must deal with the fury 
of the African tribal wizard, even back home in the United States.

ONCE UPON A TIME ****
Writer: Richard Matheson                Director: Norman Z. McLeod
Cast: Buster Keaton, Stanley Adams, Gil Lamb, James Flavin, Michael Ross, 
    Milton Parsons, George E. Stone, Warren Parker  
A janitor in the late 1800s finds himself in the next century when he 
innocently fiddles with his inventor-employer's contraption.
LW: Boy, is THIS a strange one! Note the presence of Buster Keaton as the 
    main character in the cast. The whole beginning and ending segments of 
    the show (whenever we are in 1880) are done as a SILENT FILM!  We get 
    the usual slightly sped up effect, piano music, and dialog cards. When 
    we go into the future (or rather, OUR present), we suddenly go from 
    silent mode to regular sound, regular speed photography!  This is one of 
    the class of Twilight Zone comedies, and is a very good one indeed.
 
FIVE CHARACTERS IN SEARCH OF AN EXIT ****
Writer: Rod Serling                     Director: Lamont Johnson
Cast: William Windom, Murray Matheson, Susan Harrison, Kelton Garwood, 
Clark 
    Allen, Mona Houghton, Carol Hill  
Five people trying to escape from some sort of large cylindrical container 
have no memory of who they are or how they came to be there. One is a 
soldier, one a clown, one a dancer, and one a bagpiper.  At least I think 
there was a bagpiper.  Hmm.  There was also one other character (total must 
equal five for the title to work!)  Based on a short story by Marvin Petal.
LW: A good cast, and what has to be about the simplest set ever used in a 
    TZ, or almost any other television show for that matter.

A QUALITY OF MERCY **
Writer: Rod Serling                     Director: Buzz Kulik
Cast: Dean Stockwell, Albert Salmi, Rayford Barnes, Ralph Votrian, Leonard 
    Nimoy, Dale Ishimoto, Jerry Fujikawa, Michael Pataki  
A soldier gets a fresh, frightening perspective on his militaristic ways 
when he suddenly experiences a war situation from the enemy's point of 
view.
LW: The only notable element of this episode is Leonard Nimoy in a 
    relatively minor role.

NOTHING IN THE DARK ***
Writer: George Clayton Johnson          Director: Lamont Johnson
Cast: Gladys Cooper, Robert Redford, R. G. Armstrong  
A frightened old woman who has sealed herself off from the world to avoid 
confronting death, admits a wounded policeman and soon learns that she may 
have made a big mistake.

ONE MORE PALLBEARER ***
Writer: Rod Serling                     Director: Lamont Johnson
Cast: Joseph Wiseman, Trevor Bardette, Gage Clark, Katherine Squire, Josip 
    Elic, Robert Snyder, Ray Galvin 
A rich man schemes to wreak revenge on three people who humiliated him at 
various points in his life. How? By staging a fake nuclear war, just for 
their benefit.

DEAD MAN'S SHOES **
Writer: Charles Beaumont                Director: Montgomery Pittman
Cast: Warren Stevens, Harry Swoger, Ben Wright, Joan Marshall, Eugene 
    Borden, Richard Devon, Florence Marly, Ron Haggerthy, Joe Mell  
When a derelict dons the shoes of a dead gangster, he finds himself 
following the course of the dead man's life.
LW: Not very good really, but it has a couple of fair moments.

SHOWDOWN WITH RANCE McGREW ***
Writer: Rod Serling                     Director: C. Nyby
Cast: Larry Blyden, William McLean, Troy Melton, Jay Overholts, Robert J. 
    Stevenson, Robert Cornwaithe, Arch Johnson, Robert Kline, Hal K. Dawson  
An obnoxious cowboy star gets his comeuppance whan he suddenly finds himself 
confronting one of the outlaws who has been poorly presented in his 
television show.
LW: Tongue-in-cheek.  Fairly humorous.

THE HUNT ***
Writer: Earl Hamner, Jr.                Director: Harold Schuster
Cast: Arthur Hunnicutt, Jeanette Nolan, Titus Moede, Orville Sherman, 
    Charles Seel, Robert Foulk, Dexter DuPont  
When a hunter and his dog are killed while stalking their prey, they go to 
the Gates of Heaven, where they must deal with St. Peter. Or IS it really 
St. Peter?

KICK THE CAN *
Writer: George Clayton Johnson          Director: Lamont Johnson
Cast: Ernest Treux, Russell Collins, Hank Patterson, Earle Hodgins, Burt 
    Mustin, Gregory McCabe, Marjorie Bennett, Lenore Shanewise, Anne O'Neal, 
    John Marley, Barry Treux, Eve McVeagh, Marc Stevens
A children's game somehow offers rejuvenative powers to an old man.
LW: Blech. Sopping sentimentality again. A number of these crept into the 
    series.

A PIANO IN THE HOUSE  **
Writer: Earl Hamner, Jr.                Director: David Greene
Cast: Barry Morse, Joan Jackett, Don Durant, Phil Coolidge, Cyril Delevanti, 
    Muriel Landers  
The right tune played on a mysterious player piano will reveal the 
listener's true nature.
LW: Note the presence of Barry Morse (later of "Space: 1999" among other 
    shows).
 
TO SERVE MAN *****
Writer: Rod Serling                     Director: Richard Bare 
Cast: Richard Kiel, Hardie Albright, Robert Tafur, Lomax Study, Theodore 
    Marcuse, Susan Cummings, Nelson Olmstead, Lloyd Bochner  
When aliens come to Earth bearing promises of a utopian existence, the 
military's suspicions and skepticism eventually prove justified. But too 
late. The alien "Canamits" were executed by make-up artist William Tuttle. 
Based on a short story by Damon Knight.
LW: This is a "super-classic". Probably the most popular TZ episode of all 
    time, and one of my personal top favorites as well. EXCELLENT.

THE LAST RITES OF JEFF MYRTLEBANK **
Writer/Director: Montgomery Pittman
Cast: James Best, Ralph Moody, Ezelle Pouley, Vickie Barnes, Sherry 
Jackson, 
    Helen Wallace, Lance Fuller, Bill Fawcett, Edgar Buchanan, Mabel 
    Forrest, Dub Taylor, Jon Lormer, Pat Hector  
Because a young man has seemingly awakened from the dead, the superstitious 
townspeople assume he is possessed by the Devil.

THE FUGITIVE **
Writer: Charles Beaumont                Director: Richard L. Bare
Cast: J. Pat O'Malley, Susan Gordon, Nancy Kulp, Wesley Lau, Paul Tripp, 
    Stephen Talbot, Johnny Eiman, Russ Bender  
A magical old gentleman uses his powers to help a sick little girl, thus 
risking being returned to his home planet if agents of his planet locate 
him.

LITTLE GIRL LOST *****
Writer: Richard Matheson                Director: Paul Stewart
Cast: Sarah Marshall, Robert Sampson, Charles Aidman, Tracy Stratford  
A couple can hear their daughter's desperate cries, yet she is nowhere to be 
found - she's fallen through an invisible "hole" in her wall, and is lost in 
the fourth dimension.
LW: Another classic.  Another excellent episode.

PERSON OR PERSONS UNKNOWN ***
Writer: Charles Beaumont                Director: John Brahm
Cast: Richard Long, Frank Silvera, Shirley Ballard, Julie Van Zandt, Betty 
    Harford, Ed Glover, Michael Kelp, Joe Higgins, John Newton  
A man's day gets off to a bizarre start when he awakens to discover that no 
one knows who he is.
LW: Richard Long also starred in several other TZ's over the years.

THE GIFT **
Writer: Rod Serling                     Director: Allen Parker
Cast: Geoffrey Horne, Nico Minardos, Cliff Osmond, Edmund Vargas, Carmen 
    D'Antonio, Paul Mazursky, Vladimir Sokoloff, Vito Scotti, Henry Corden  
A group of Mexican villagers are convinced that a downed flyer is, in fact, 
an extraterrestrial.

THE LITTLE PEOPLE ***
Writer: Rod Serling                     Director: Bill Claxton
Cast: Joe Maross, Claude Akins, Michael Ford  
Everything is relative, as a space traveler soon learns when he proceeds to 
lord his size over the tiny folk who inhabit a planetoid.

FOUR O'CLOCK **
Writer: Rod Serling                     Director: Lamont Johnson
Cast: Theodore Bikel, Phyllis Love, Linden Chiles, Moyna MacGill
Based on a short story by Price Day.
Theodore Bikel is cast as demented Oliver Crangle, a man dedicated to the 
expulsion of evil... at all costs. His plan: reduce all the evil people in 
the world to 2 feet tall, at 4 o'clock.

THE TRADE-INS ***
Writer: Rod Serling                     Director: Elliot Silverstein
Cast: Joseph Schildkraut, Noah Keen, Alma Platt, Ted Marcuse, Edson Stroll, 
    Terrene De Marney, Billy Vincent, Mary McMahon, David Armstrong  
Youth isn't all it's cracked up to be, as an old man learns when a mind and 
personality transplant gives him a lonely new life in a young new body.
LW: Actually, he doesn't get the body until near the end of the show. The 
    primary focus of the episode is that he and his wife only have enough 
    money for ONE of them to be transplanted.  A good show.

HOCUS POCUS AND FRISBY ****
Writer: Rod Serling                     Director: Lamont Johnson
Cast: Andy Devine, Milton Selzer, Howard McNear, Dabbs Greer, Clem Bevans, 
    Larry Breitman, Peter Brocco  
The town windbag so impresses a visiting group of aliens (who are 
masquerading as humans) with his tall tale stories that they attempt to take 
him back to their planet for study as a prime Earth specimen. Based on a 
short story by Frederic Louis Fox.
LW: Crusty-voiced Andy is perfect in his role.  Very humorous.

THE DUMMY ***
Writer: Rod Serling                     Director: Abner Bibberman
Cast: Cliff Robertson, Frank Sutton, George Murdock, John Harmon, Sandra 
    Warner, Ralph Manza, Rudy Dolan, Bethelynn Grey  
A cut-rate ventriloquist starts believing that his dummy actually has a mind 
- and a will - of its own.  Based on a story by Leon Polk.

THE CHANGING OF THE GUARD *
Writer: Rod Serling                     Director: Robert Ellis Miller
Cast: Donald Pleasance, Liam Sullivan, Phillippa Bevans, Kevin O'Neal, 
Jimmy 
Baird, Kevin Jones, Tom Lowell, Russ Horton, Buddy Hart, Darryl Richard, 
James Browning, Bob Biheller, Dennis Kerlee, Pat Close  
A popular teacher faces the prospect of a life without purpose when he is 
asked to retire from his post.
LW: Very little socially redeeming value to this one.

YOUNG MAN'S FANCY **
Writer: Richard Matheson                Director: John Brahm
Cast: Phyllis Thaxter, Alex Nicol, Wallace Rooney, Ricky Kelman, Helen 
Brown  
A young man yearns so desperately for the days of his youth that the past 
does, in fact, reappear.
LW: In fact, he becomes a little boy again, and goes back to his mother 
    (deserting his fiance).  There is a scene in the episode where the 
    fiance sees the elements of the man's youth, right up to his mother, 
    start to appear around them.

I SING THE BODY ELECTRIC *
Writer: Ray Bradbury                    Director: James Sheldon
Cast: Josephine Hutchinson, David White, June Vincent, Vaughn Taylor, 
    Charles Herbert, Dana Dillaway, Paul Nesbitt, Susan Crane, Veronica 
    Cartwright, Judy Morton  
A girl comes to understand that a grandmother can be a tender, thoughtful, 
caring, loving woman.  Even if she is a robot.
LW: To all the Bradbury fans out there, I'm sorry, but this episode is 
    TERRIBLE. Probably one of the five worst TZ's ever made.  Is dripping 
in 
    sentimentality, has rather poor acting, and is generally a lose.

CAVENDER IS COMING ***
Writer: Rod Serling                     Director: Chris Nyby
Cast: Carol Burnett, Jesse White, Howard Smith, William O'Connell, Pitt 
    Herbert, John Fielder, Stanley Jones, Frank Behrens, Albert Carrier, Roy 
    Sickner, Norma Shattuc, Rory O'Brien, Sandra Gould, Adrienne Marden, 
    Jack Younger, Danny Kulick, Donna Douglas, Maurice Dallimore, Barbara    
    Morrison  
In this pilot for a never-launched series, a klutzy guardian angel's 
attempts to make a bumbling woman happy don't work out quite as expected.
LW: If it weren't for the presence of Carol Burnett and Jesse White, I 
would 
    only give this TWO stars.  Another guardian angel plot. Obviously, it 
    was a comedy.  Carol tries hard despite a horrid script. Jesse White has 
    played many character roles, but perhaps is best known as the lonely 
    Maytag repairman! The basic plot is VERY similar to the "Mr. Bemis" 
    episode above.  By the way, this episode had one very unusual aspect, it

Crew Manifest:

PAT BERRY (Copy editor) is a 34-year-old freelance technical writer and 
self-described "computer geek" living in Cary, North Carolina.  He has two 
children, saw STAR WARS over 30 times during its theatrical run, and annoys 
his friends by quoting lengthy passages of Dave Barry's writings from 
memory.

DEBBIE DOUGLASS (HIGHLANDER news) is the list owner of HIGHLA-L, an 
electronic mailing list discussing HIGHLANDER."

TJ GOLDSTEIN is the editor of this monstrosity and is probably responsible
for any typos that made it into this version.  TJ is beginning to think 
that professional help might not be such a bad idea after all, and not just 
for the magazine.

ESTHER JENKINS (Convention listings) is a bored, single, 27-year-old femme.  
She's over-qualified for most every job she applies for with her two BS 
degrees (one in Applied Math from Georgia Tech and one in Industiral 
Engineering Technology from Southern Tech).  Originally from Germany, she 
moved to the States in 1973 and has been living in Georgia ever since.  
Esther got introduced to science fiction and cons by an ex-boyfriend many 
years ago, and is an avid reader (and collector) of books of all kinds and 
comics.  Right now she is working as a temp while looking for a 
manufacturing job and has lots of free time on her hands to compile this 
little column for Cyberspace Vanguard.

EVELYN LEEPER (Book Reviews) is best known for her lengthy convention 
reports, but also writes book reviews and general commentary on science 
fiction, and publishes the clubzine for the science fiction club at AT&T 
that she and her husband Mark founded fifteen years ago.  Her work appears
in fanzines such as LAN'S LANTERN, PHLOGISTON, and SF-LOVERS DIGEST and
on Usenet.  Her 1992 output included four dozen book reviews, two
convention reports, and two travelogues, and totaled 110,000 words.
Evelyn and Mark live in New Jersey, with 18,000 books, several hundred
videotapes, and no extra space.  They are currently recovering from a
three-week trip to India.

DAVID MILNER (Japan news) is a big Japanese monster movie fan who has 
written for a number of different publications, such as CULT MOVIES AND 
VIDEO, MARKALITE and THE KAIJU REVIEW.

LINDA E. SMIT (Reply cards) lives in Athens, GA, surrounded by Bulldog 
fans, Braves fans, and a healthy enclave of scifi and fantasy fandom.  Her 
real job is in library acquisitions, and she works her tail off in 
community theatre.  Guess which one she prefers to do.

DAVID STRAUSS (BABYLON 5 news) is a second year law student at the 
University of Virginia Law School.  He's also a displaced New Yorker, 
diehard New York Islander fan, and administrator of the Islanders Internet  
Mailing List.  By this time next year he hopes to be finished begging for a 
job.

JOSEPH J. STROUT will be receiving his degree in Psychology from Miami
University in May of 1994, when he plans to pursue a Ph.D. in cognitive
neuroscience at another university.  His current research focuses on
computational models of the human visual system.  Other research interests
include neural models of attention, working memory, and visual imagery.
In his spare time, Strout serves as a programmer/analyst at a manufacturing
company and does occasional consulting.

JEAN-LOUIS TRUDEL (French news) is a Canadian SF writer.  He is the author 
of one novel, serialized in the magazine IMAGINE... (1985-1987), and of 
several short stories in French, one of which was translated and published 
in the English-Canadian anthology TESSERACTS3.  In English, he is the 
author of two short stories, which appeared in the English-Canadian 
anthologies ARK OF ICE and TESSERACTS4, both in 1992.  He has written 
literary criticism for
THE NEW YORK REVIEW OF SCIENCE FICTION.

CAROL LEON-YUN WANG (Correspondent/reporter) is a recently defended Masters 
student in Computer Graphics Animation who has replaced thesis deadlines 
with conference submission deadlines.  She is on a slow westward migration 
that started in Regina, SK and is currently stalled out in Calgary, AB.  
She is a voracious reader of genre books and comics, and completely 
nocturnal.  She still likes Capt. Kirk better than Picard, even though 
William Shatner was a lousy actor and a truly atrocious director.
