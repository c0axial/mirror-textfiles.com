-! 1 !-  Ramblings of a Deranged Editor
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

     They say that if you aim for nothing, you usually hit it.  What 
they don't tell you is that if you aim too high, what you usually 
hit is your head.  
     Don't worry, there's a point to this.
     Many of you have been waiting, patiently, for the next issue of 
Cyberspace Vanguard, and we appreciate that.  It's been a 
ridiculously long time since the last one.  (So long, in fact, 
that we won't talk about how long it's been.)  Here's why:
     As you all know, CV is distributed without charge.  As such, it's 
not very good at paying the bills, so everyone involved has to 
have a full time job.  (We're all really fond of eating.)  
     Personally, Sarah and I have also moved -- twice.  This second 
time, we moved 1300 miles, from Cleveland to St. Petersberg, 
Florida.
     The last move was for yours truly to take a job doing interactive 
multimedia -- the type of thing we want to do with CV.  When I got 
here I discovered that what I was trying to do with an artist and 
our spare time was being done by a full time staff of 14 people.
     Naturally, this prompted a re-think.
     So, we have made arrangements for space on the World Wide Web, and 
are presently setting up a "starter" site.  In the next couple of 
months, we'll be putting up interviews with Rene Auberjonios, K 
Callan, Geraint Wyn Davies, Mira Furlan, Lisa Mason, Ethan 
Phillips ... oh, lots of people.
     The URL, if you'd like to pop over and check it out, will be 
"http://www.actwin.com/cvanguard".  We're still setting up, so have a 
little patience, and we'll try to make it all worthwhile.
     In the meantime, we bring you MICHAEL PILLER, 
co-executive producer of the 3 new STAR TREKS and UPN's 
LEGEND, which will be having a special airing following 
ST: VOYAGER on June 12 as executives try and decide whether 
or not to keep it.  (Letters of support can be sent to 
LEGEND@paramount.com as well.)
     So enjoy!  And when you check out our website, drop us a 
note and tell us what you think of it.  Like CV itself, we want to 
make it something you're a part of.

-! 2 !-  The Old West and the New Future:  Michael Piller on saving 
         LEGEND
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

     Michael Piller is a busy guy, for the most part.  
Besides Executive Producing both of the current STAR TREKs, 
he has also created and is producing LEGEND, a "comedy 
western" about a writer, played by MACGYVER'S Richard Dean 
Anderson) who winds up impersonating his heroic creation 
with the help of a nineteenth century mad scientist/genius, 
given life by ST alumnus John de Lancie.
     LEGEND is what's keeping Mr. Piller busy these days, 
even though filming has pretty much wrapped up, because the 
show is currently in limbo.  Officially, UPN has not decided 
whether or not to drop the show along with all of the rest 
of it's current lineup (aside from ST:VOYAGER, of course). 
"The UPN network," Mr. Piller told CV in a phone interview, 
"in response to a really remarkable amount of letters and 
wishes from people who like the show, has asked for more 
time to make up their minds about the show, so we've 
extended the contracts so they can give us some more tryouts 
in June.  They are going to put us on Monday night June 12th 
following VOYAGER.  The message is very clear.  If we hold 
that STAR TREK audience, then we are going to making a big 
impression on UPN."
      Monday's show will be a new episode, featuring John de 
LancieUs character, Janos Bartok.  The guest villain in this 
tale of the late 1800's will be played by Robert Englund, 
perhaps best known for his role as Freddy Kreuger in the 
Nightmare on Elm Street films.
     Ernest Pratt, the show's main character, and Professor 
Bartok will have plenty to fight the villain with, of 
course.  Mr. Piller describes Bartok as "someone who's ahead 
of his time.  Somebody who could take steam and turn it into 
a moving vehicle.  Somebody who could take electricity and 
turn it into a stun weapon.  Somebody who could do something 
with the science that was available in 1876 that was beyond 
history, but possibly within the scientific knowledge of the 
time."
     Of course, all of this creates a challenge for the 
writer:  how not to let them invent their way out of any 
problem that they face.  "Well that's an interesting problem 
and one that we run into all the time.  We don't want to 
make it easy for them.  They have a great advanage with 
these weapons, and their balloon that they travel around in, 
and the cars and the wings and the other things that our 
hero has invented, so we just have to work hard to put them 
into situations where not all of these inventions always 
work, creating jeopardy that they can't always easily solve.  
And that, in the great tradition of drama, is the writer's 
problem."
     And, of course, all of this has to be done within the 
constraints of 1876 science, or it becomes fantasy.  There's 
nothing wrong with fantasy, of course, but it's a subject 
that has stirred up controversy around the STAR TREK shows 
for years.
     "From the day I got here, Rick Berman and Gene 
Rodenberry made it very clear to me that they felt there was 
a very important line between fantasy and science fiction 
and that we were to stay on the side of science fiction with 
STAR TREK.  The difference was that things happen in fantasy 
that have no logical explanation.  That essentially was our 
operating assumption.  So if somebody came in with a story 
that did not have a basis in science, it was generally 
frowned upon.  As the years have gone by, I'd say that we 
have expanded that line quite a bit, but we still require a 
scientific basis for any of the fantastic events that occur 
on STAR TREK.  
     "We are currently developing a story in which one of 
the characters on the Voyager finds himself mysteriously back 
home where he doesn't belong.  He's back on Earth, living a 
life he shouldn't be living.  When he starts to investigate 
he discovers that Voyager is in fact missing, but that he 
was never on the crew in the first place, and that in his 
place is somebody who wasn't actually on the ship when he 
was there.  So that's a pretty fantasy based story.  But, in 
order to make it STAR TREK, or rather to make it fit into 
the vision and rules that Gene Rodenberry had worked out for 
us, we have created a circumstance involving an alien 
culture that explains how this could have happened 
scientifically, even though the story we wanted to tell is 
... well, pretty Twilight Zone.  
     "I don't think science is 'very important', I think its 
absolutely essential."
     And yet the net is full of science-oriented people 
ready to pick apart the show whenever it mentions anything 
specific.
     "I'm not a scientist, so excuse me, but I think when 
you deal with speculative science there are interpretations 
and subjective opinions that come into the judgments.  A lot 
of these are things that could possibly occur.  I don't 
think there are many mistakes that are clear and obvious 
mistakes.  I can tell you that from day one Gene thought it 
was very important to have a science consultant on the show 
who read every script and gave notes on the show, and that 
this be a legitimate scientist with good credentials.  We 
currently have a gentleman who holds a Ph.D. with and 
astrophysics background and a variety of other degrees who 
goes over everything that we do and makes corrections, makes 
suggestions, helps us with the science.  We never 
deliberately violate scientific principles. We're always 
trying to make the science something that could conceivably 
be the outgrowth of some contemporary science that we're 
aware of."
     Of course, with the lighthearted nature of LEGEND, the 
science seems to be less of an issue.
     While Bartok was inspired by turn of the century 
scientist and inventor Nicola Tesla, Pratt himself was 
inspired by ... well, itUs hard to say.  Both Pratt and 
Piller are writers who have backgrounds in journalism -- Mr. 
Piller started out with CBS news -- but ...
     "I can tell you that  I am not a womanizer, a drinker, 
nor a gambler, but I count many of them among my friends.  I 
would say that Pratt is much closer to Bill Dial, my 
collaborator.  But I can tell you what he is.  What I tell 
all the people who come in to write LEGEND is that he's the 
closest thing to us that you'll ever have to write.  If you 
want to know what's going on in this character's mind, look 
inside your own, because he's a writer.  He thinks like a 
writer.  He speaks like a writer.  He uses language like a 
writer.  He uses language as a weapon to disarm his 
opponents.  These are all things that I think are important 
to bring to the character."
     So what's a writer to do if he (or she) wants to do 
just that?  Several years ago ST: THE NEXT GENERATION began 
reading unsolicited scripts, as long as they were 
accompanied by the proper release forms.  ST: DEEP SPACE 
NINE continues the tradition.  The decision about accepting 
scripts for ST: VOYAGER has not been discussed, but Mr. 
Piller feels that if LEGEND continues, it is something he 
would like to do.
     "I think that once a show is on the air and people can 
see what we're doing and how we write the shows, they can start 
going to their typewriters and word processors and coming up 
with ideas.  I just feel it's so important to generate ideas 
from a wide variety of sources  We've gotten so many good 
writers this way that even if we get a hundred bad scripts, 
it's worth it to me to get the 101st one that gives me an 
idea that we'd like to buy, or finds us a writer that we'd 
like to develop something with."
     Not that writing for LEGEND will be easy.  Aside from 
the jeopardy issue, there is the genre itself, which seems 
to have a hard time finding a mainstream audience.
     "It is an unusual genre, a comedy western with 
overtones of science, but I believe in the genre.  I believe 
it can work.  It just needs time to find an audience.  I 
would like it to have the same audience as ST."
     As for the future of STAR TREK, "We plan to continue on 
how we're going, and not throw any more STAR TREK's on the fire and 
dilute the audience any further."  The next feature film, 
which will feature the cast of TNG, is in the planning 
stages, but Mr. Piller is not involved with it.
     That's probably just as well, as he seems to have his 
hands full trying to save LEGEND.
     "The most important thing to communicate is that we are 
trying very hard to go to cyberspace to save LEGEND.  A 
group of people who have never seen each other but who have 
a shared experience with a television show have sent 
hundreds of letters.  A letter from a person who's seen a 
show sends a message to an executive, with, of course, the 
most important message being the ratings.  We've never done 
this before but I think we're finally defining a use for the 
Internet.  I think that with this experiment LEGEND will be 
saved.  I'm very gratified and hope people keep watching and 
will tell everyone else to watch.  It will all be decided in  
couple of weeks."
     His "absolute commitment to saving this show" means 
he's reading every piece of e-mail that comes in to him at 
LEGEND@paramount.com.  (Comments to the United Paramount 
Network can also be sent to UPNmail@aol.com.)  Of course, 
he's not the first producer to come to cyberspace looking 
for support, but not everyone agrees with the practice.
     "One person said it was unseemly for a producer to be 
seen to ask for help in saving his show.  Well, if it's 
unseemly, then so be it.  I think LEGEND is important 
because it celebrates history, science, literature; it's 
heroes are nonviolent.  If we don't work to save shows like 
that, we're going to lose them."
