The Bollweevils
Stick Your Neck Out!
(Dr. Strange, Box 7000-117, Alta Loma, CA 91701)
After one listen you'll know that these punks hail from the Chicago
school of melodic hardcore. Pegboy, Naked Raygun and Screeching
Weasel will immediately come to mind. Daryl's vocals are a nasally
cross between Ben Weasel and Dave Smalley. Although the material on
this CD has all been done before, it's never been done this right.
This CD is a very solid release - I've been listening to it every
day since I obtained it, and in my mind, it surpasses this year's
NO FX and Rancid releases. Their cover of Tommy Tutone's "Jenny"
will have you slamming in no time!
-Shawn Merrill

Bone of Contention
Stay Calm
(Igor)
This CD from the Pittsburgh foursome is a great recording with lots
of depth and passion that will get the band absolutely nowhere
financially. I earnestly hope that they can survive making good,
fun music and don't have any yucky ambitions for Top 40 status.
What first struck me about Stay Calm was the wondrous diversity.
Sure it's all basically rock and roll, but they really put a spin
on the norm. The lyrics in such tunes as "We'll Do Fine" are funny
in a comedic, black way: "You bring the Prozac, I'll bring the
wine." "Crawl" gits funky: "I wanna see you sweat, I wanna see your
upper lip wet." Most of the songs are created in a tongue-in-cheek
mood. Look at the song titles alone - "Like Richard Brautigan,
Lonesome on a Saturday Night" and "All The Things You Could Be By
Now If Henry Miller's Wife Was Your Mother." Are they
intellectuals? Other bands that came to mind? They smack a little
of Violent Femmes and even My Dad is Dead (the vocals anyway). I
like Stay Calm, and I look forward to liking it even more in the
future.
-Andrew Creighton

Mark Burgess And The Sons of God
Zima Junction
(Pivot/Cargo)
And everyone thinks Bono has a messianic complex - here's Mark
Burgess surrounding himself (or should that be Himself) with Sons
of God and playing skiffling English and Scottish folk-derived
songs abounding in Gaelic and Welsh epics and rustic visions of the
apocalypse, Arcadia and Xanadu rolled into one. Could be a simple
case of the former Chameleon changing his skin and envisioning
himself as a bardic conscience of Britain, its history and cultural
demise. Zima Junction is mostly valuable as a curiosity, a lightly
tripping folk rendering of myth and prophecy that thankfully
succumbs to none of the gaudily pretentious Marrilionesque idiocies
of bands that have read too much Tolkien and Gaelic myth. But the
real curiosity here are the two covers: a poem by "The Shetland
Poet Vagabond" set to Philip Glass's "Facades" and a similarly
hypnotic version of the old Bond theme, "You Only Live Twice,"
which I would almost swear is not sung by Mark Burgess, but by Marc
Almond, bathing in all the luminescence of pop melodrama. St.
Etienne must be kicking themselves that they let this one get away.
-Chris Wodskou

Kepone
Ugly Dance
(1/4 Stick)
I'd like to quote one of the three reviews that was used on the
back of the bio for this band because it epitomises how I felt
while listening to this album the second or third time; "Woah. Wow.
Geez. Man. Golly. Shucks. Shesh. Whew. Damn..." Said reviewer went
on to write the most aggressively positive review I've ever read.
But, after listening to Kepone's newest and first full length, Ugly
Dance, you'll concur. Kepone are from Richmond, Virginia and are a
power trio made up of an ex-Honor Role dude, and an ex-Gwar dude
(Go figure?). Ugly Dance is likely the record I'll listen to most
until the next GVSB album comes out. Blending aggro vibes like Big
Black with melodic tones lying somewhere between Minutemen and
Volcano Suns, Kepone are worth your time and money. 1/4 Stick
strikes again.
-Phil Saunders

===================================+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++????????
oh oh I feel a rAnT!!! coming on...What do we mean by anti-copyright????????
===================================+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++!!!!!!!!

        Exactly this: Now that your reading this, there is
        nothing we can do to stop you from making any number
        of copies of this, and giving it away to whoever you
        want. No amount of intellectual indignation can change
        this one iota. In fact, we kind of rely on that aspect of
        this kind of venture. So the last thing we'll be doing is
        spending millions on corporate lobbyists to lean on
        the crooks in Ottawa on behalf of our so-called copyrights.

        I was recently at the Stentor Corporations love-in with
        the "Canadian Music Industry" at the King Edward Hotel
        in Toronto. These are the guys who aim to wire Canada
        in 10 years and 8 billion dollars. The public relations
        wing of the conglomerate is on tour right now, meeting with
        "special interest groups" (of which we all belong to so
        many). In the morning they met with "the handicapped" to
        explain to them that they will be looked after in the
        new infoshere. That night they unrolled a cash bar, dumped
        a few kilos of shish-kabobs onto a serving table and let in
        "the music biz".
             There were a small number of people there,
        varying from CIRPA (who organized the event) to David
        Basskin from the CMRRA, some suit from EMI Publishing,
        college radio, CHART, the Record and what have you...

        Aside from a question of equal access, my techie-nerd
        questions, almost all the talk was of copyright protection.
        When I first asked a question I had to fight off the urge to
        to grab the microphone, leap atop the pedestal and scream: "you
        neo-corporate-fools!!! Can't you see it's futile? H a Ha Ha aH hA!!
        People who want to get their media out DON'T NEED YOU. Ha aH hha Ha.
        Go back to the mainstream, you've not the courage to venture into
        the internet!" But I didn't. I was talking to David Basskin after
        the talk and what he said was essentially this: The Music Industry
        is fueled by a.few.big.acts a year. These acts generate so.much.money
        they fuel the entire industry. This is all threatened with this
        entire internet thang. If the _big stars_ get ripped off so much
        there will be less money for the industry in general. My response
        was that he was absolutely correct up to a point. I think
        big.star.acts will dwindle in time. Rather than have 10 acts a
        year sell a million records, you'll have one or two thousand
        bands moving the equivalent of 20-30,000 units. Some more some
        less, but the result will be my long anticipated extinction of
        the Tyrannosaurus Majorlabellus and the Obsoletis Supergroupiccus.

        I for one, can't wait.

    Miscellaneous Item #1. Trent Reznor, frontman for industrial
act du moment Nine Inch Nails, is, apparently, in advanced style
denial. Recently, at the all-too-trendy New York nightspot, Jackie
60, I ran into up and coming fashion designer Walter Sessna, who
doubles (who doesn't) as a stylist. Trent was, until recently, one
of his clients. Walter had just returned from a disastrous two-day
business trip to LA, where he had a major fight and final falling
out with Trent. It seems the morbid musician (who had,
incidentally, until a few months ago, been staying at one of the
sites of the Manson Massacre, which he claimed, by the way, not to
know had once been the former Tate-Polanski home. "Oh, that's why
the rent is so cheap," he was heard to say disingenuously) accused
Walter of leaking to the press that he was, indeed, employed as his
stylist/image consultatnt. (Walter denies any indiscretion on his
part.) Please, Mr. Reznor! There is no shame in having a stylist.
After all, the entire entertainment industry complex is built on
the backs of hard-working, stylewise, trendspotting homosexuals.
Smells like an advanced case of style denial to me! 
 
  Miscellaneous Item #2. During Fashion Week in New York, gorgeous
Kim Gordon pulled a Monika Treut by showing her new Riot Grrrl
Resort collection on the street between the locations of two major
fashion shows, thereby snagging some of the attention from the
fashionistas dashing from runway to runway, including Francis Ford
Coppola and jetsetting daughter Sofia. Kudos to Miss Gordon, who,
judging from her memorable Gap ad, certainly knows how to
manipulate the media while coming out smelling like a rose: the
savvy songstress got more attention for doing the ad than the ad
itself generated. Good luck to Miss Gordon on both her new X-girl
fashion line and her other new project - baby Coco. (The
expression, "pulling a Monica Treut," by the way, means to sponge
off other people's publicity, which is what Ms. Treut did at the
press screening of one of my movies in New York. We shared the same
publicist, who told her to get her German carcass over to the lobby
to the theatre where my movie was showing to a full house of press
to talk up her new movie. I happen to know this because she
happened to rustle up as her date a certain famous gay novelist
whom she pulled out of the theatre and made leave with her after
only ten minutes, having already accomplished her self-serving
task. Tsk, tsk. 
 
  Miscellaneous Item #3. True Richard Kern stories. Recently, while
I was over at Richard's in New York being photographed with a big,
thick candle shoved up my ass for possible use in Future sex
magazine - which I hate, but I felt like I owed Richard a favour
after he appeared so gamely in my movie - he told me that he
recently had a "model" over being photographed, and he had her hung
upside down from her feet in bondage, and the rope broke, and she
fell right on her head! She could've broken her neck! And try to
explain that bondage gear to the cops! Fortunately, she was okay,
and she didn't sue. By the way, Richard was afraid to come to my
post-screening party with all those damn homosexuals there. He's so
cute. 
 
  Miscellaneous Item #4. True Glory Hole domination stories. Glory
Hole was almost fired from Billy's Topless for a) flashing her
pussy; b) licking her tits; and c) being intoxicated while working.
The rumours about her drug use started when she showed up for work
wearing the "DRUNK" hat I bought her, not removing it for her
performances throughout the evening. Glory Hole lobs her purse
unceremoniously onto the small stage before she mounts it, and that
same evening, the purse flew open, spilling out the contents of a
bottle of Tylenol with Codeine that I had also brought her from
Canada (along with the DRUNK hat). The management and customer
raised their eyebrows in unison as she tottered over in not much
more than her stiletto heels and G-string and gathered up the
pills, exclaiming, "My dolls, my dolls!" The perpetual smile
plastered across her face as she does the burlesque also may have
contributed to the drug rumours. Anyhow, so the owner of Billy's
called her into his office to give her a severe reprimand. Glory
Hole denied both the charges of drug use and pussy-flashing ("Why
would want to?" she asked, wide-eyed.) As for the tit-licking
question, she promised never, ever to do it again. 
 
  Miscellaneous Item #5. Lucas Haas, child star of such Hollywood
movies as Witness and Ramblin' Rose, was recently caught
shoplifting a rap tape at Tower Records on Hollywood Boulevard in
LA. The manager of the store, a queen, took several Polaroids of
the poor boy as he sat locked up in the back room waiting for the
cops to come, telling him it was standard procedure for
shoplifters, but actually snapping the shots because he thought the
young actor was so cute. Excuse me, but if he was that cute, why
didn't you just let him go? After all, Lucas was just carrying on
a long tradition of star shoplifting, pioneered by Hedy Lamaar in
the 60s.
