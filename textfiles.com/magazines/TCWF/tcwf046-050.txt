A meeting of the world's biggest oil companies has finalised a plan to
restart the Gulf War by donating funds to Saddam Hussein. Delegates at
the meeting were told it would help keep world oil prices up. An oil(y)
executive said, "we think this is a good move for the world. And us in
particular. Besides our humungous profits, think of all the jobs it will
create in the defence industries and journalism, and the lessened effect
on the atmosphere due to no-one except us being able to afford to drive
cars."
    When it was pointed out to him that the burning of oil-fields due to
the war was possibly one of the worst ecological disasters this century,
he replied "ah yes, but that wasn't our fault! Anyway, that Saddam's a
really nice bloke, and we said please, and he guaranteed he won't do it
again. Not only that, but he won't even gas the Kurds. Well, not much,
anyway."
    The US government and its allies objected to the move until they
were told that the Allied forces would also be sponsored by the oil
companies. This will involve the placement of oil company logos on
strategic weaponry and other hardware. Amongst the other sponsorship
deals organised, the helicopters will be sponsored by Mobil, the new
TXjet fighters (see TCWF #36) by Texaco, the navy by Caltex, the guns
by BP, and the shells by Shell. Exxon will sponsor the body-bags.
    The FBT (Fucking Big Tank, see TCWF #36) has failed to be sponsored,
and will not be used, as the oil companies are concerned that this would
bring victory to the Allies too soon.
    US officials announced a range of new jobs available in the defence
industry as a result of the decision. A new company, partially funded
by the government, known as Death Killing And Mass Destruction For
Christianity Against Them Goddamn Iraqi Scumsuckers Pty Ltd will be
formed to help construct and maintain the various weapons used by US
forces.
    The Pentagon also announced the formation of a new ground battle unit
of the US Army. It consists of Sylvester Stallone and a film crew, and
will fight its way into Southern Iraq, destroying everything in sight. A
spokesman reported "If Sly can't kill enough of them muthas himself, the
special effects people will help." With cinema ticket sales predicted in
the millions, the operation is expected to be an astounding military and
financial success.
    One of the plans that will not be accompanied by a film crew is a
scheme to dress troops up as giant ducks, in order to surprise opposing
forces. A White House spokesman commented "While they're laughing their
heads off, we'll shoot their heads off." Before being restrained, he also
commented (or perhaps screamed is a better description) "We'll bloody
murder those fuckers! We'll chop them up into little bits with our
chainsaws, scoop up the bits into big crates and send them by Comet
courier to Baghdad! And then we'll get vicious!!" The spokesman was then
escorted out of the press room by two heavily armed giant ducks.

Next we were going to have a bit of U.G.H. (Under-Graduate Humour)
involving the usual amount of foul language involved in such scribblings.
However, due to the previous article raving on about F.B.T.s, the Toxic
Custard Workshop has used up it's entire "fuck" quota for this week. Oops,
there goes another one. Now we're over-budget. And if we use up too many
four-letter words, next week we can't use any! How terrible that would be.
    At this point I would go into a list of authorised frequencies for
various profanities, but we've just about exhausted our entire budget for
this week, so I can't! Oh well. Damn. Oh shit, there goes another one.
    Anyway, aren't we offending the more refined readers of this drivel?
No, I didn't think so. But only because we haven't got any. Fact is, I
would bet that the majority of TCWF readers are currently beached in front
of a computer terminal. That's the type of person that reads this muck!
Don't try and run away and pretend you weren't reading this! We all saw
you!
    Now for more textual vomit..

                          Purely due to lack of

MONASH UNIVERSITY COMPUTER CENTRE - MODEM DIAL-UP SERVICES

Users of the Greater Monash University can now access the computer systems
via  modems  24 hours except when they are out of order. All four campuses
are equipped with dial-in lines which under normal circumstances should be
either engaged or not operational.
    Your modem and  communications software should be set up to operate in
8-bit mode with no  parity and 1 stop bit. Except when it shouldn't. Which
may or may not be the case when and if you are using the dial-ins.
    Modems  at  Clayton Campus can  utilise  the  MNP-4  error  correcting
protocol. But don't.  'Cos to be honest, we haven't worked out how to turn
the bloody things on yet. If anyone has any ideas, please tell. Well, they
were a job lot going cheap without manuals, you know how it is...

Mafia boss Alfredo Cappucino has evaded capture once again. The forces of
good were narrowly defeated at a "Capture a Mafia Boss" charity soccer
match held in Milan. A combined Interpol Police team failed to score
against the heavily armed Mafia United Soccer Club League Enterprises
team. Just after half-time when the referee awarded a penalty Interpol's
way, the Mafia team made good use of their violin cases, resulting in the
first European soccer match ever in which the teams were more violent than
the crowd. The performance was described as the best since the Berlin
Philharmonic's "Eine Kleine Nacht Musik" one memorable evening in 1978.
Conductor Hans Goldberg was in fine form, his thighs glistening in the
moonlight as he strutted his stuff in front of an estimated crowd of
90,000 confused football hooligans. Afterwards, a crowd of over two
thousand of them went on a rampage through the city, setting fire to
garbage bins and throwing up on people's cars, and chanting bits of
"Carmen". They were stopped in their tracks near the city-centre by the
entire Berlin Philharmonic, who, making their second appearance in this
paragraph, dispersed them with water canons.

US President George Bush has changed his usual practice of being
surrounded by security men and is now surrounded by medical men. White
House officials assured journalists (who were apparently sick with worry
about the president's health) that the situation was only temporary, and
that the president would not shortly be surrounded by six blocks of wood
and quite a lot of dirt.
    Dan Quayle was relieved to hear this.
    Though he didn't know what it meant.
    The security men who had been surrounding Bush and are now surrounding
Quayle were also relieved to hear it, as the entire Secret Service has
actually run out of ammunition since the CIA '91 Annual Hoover Memorial
Rabbit Hunting trip last week. The CIA deny that the trip included the
ritual hunting and slaughter of communists that has occured in previous
years. But only because they couldn't find any. However, suspected
communist rabbits were a suitable substitute, and a special vacuum squad
will be sent to the area to de-bullet it before next year's trip.
    Bush meanwhile was taken to the very nice Bethesda Naval Hospital near
Washington. While treatment at the hospital is not valid for Medicare, he
apparently still doesn't have to pay for it. Just like you can't book a
holiday to fly on Air-Force 1; you have to be a little bit privileged.
    Aides have denied that he has been seen in the company of sailors,
even medical ones, and have scoffed at rumours that Barbara Bush has been
seen in the company of Frank Sinatra. In fact, they laughed their heads
off when it was suggested. "No no, that was Nancy Reagan", they insisted.
In fact, some enterprising ex-White House officials have reportedly been
making a killing with blue movies of the couple filmed on the White House
video security system. Entitled "Nancy and Franky - Red Hot in the House
of White", it's available on Aifam Home Video for only $29.95.

The Fascist Fuckwits Federation (F.F.F.) are proud to announce the 1991
annual picnic, march, loot, and desecration of non-Aryan graves next
Tuesday, weather permitting. BYO army boots. Normal skinhead dress will
be expected. Brains will not be required. The planned schedule for the
day is:

   11am - Meet in the park
   Noon - Lunch
    1pm - Racist speeches
    2pm - Swastika tattooing, and head-shaving for the kids
    3pm - Spontaneous march through the city demonstrating about how
            the Jews, wogs, chinks, Japs and all their filthy foreign
            friends get all the best jobs and stuff, just 'cos they're more
            intelligent and better qualified. It's a conspiracy against
            the supreme race of the world! Us!

During the picnic, the FFF will have various stalls organised, where you
can buy Nazi flags, Union jacks, Nazi earings, skinhead wigs, Nazi
headbands, air-tickets to South Africa to help our white brothers rid
their country of the undesirables, Nazi bumper stickers, old copies of Mein
Kampf, and the latest in neo-Nazi fun for the kids- the plastic inflatable
Jew (matches supplied).

Good evening, you're watching ABC News, and I'm... I'm... I'm sorry,
the autocue machine seems to have vanished. And the top news story tonight
is the big autocue theft scandal. Yes, all over the world, autocue machines
have gone missing. Dubbed "the autocue thief" by police, someone who steals
autocues, has stolen some autocues. I could keep babbling like this for
half an hour, but I'll cross, live to our reporter on the scene, on the
other side of the studio, Katy Voxpop. Katy.

Thank you.. erm.. I'm sorry, I forget your name... umm.. it's thingo, isn't
it.. c'mon, we had lunch in the canteen just a few hours ago... Ri.. No no,
it could be J.. no no, I can't remember. Isn't it crazy; you know someone
for years and as soon as there comes a time that you have to say thank you
to them on national television, you forget their name. I mean it's stupid!
Anyway. Thank you. Police investigating the autocue theft are also looking
into the disappearance of several microph...

Suddenly, with malice of forethought, Calendiar burst triumphantly into
the file, the blaze of fire surrounding him. He stood triumphantly, and
triumphantly thrust out his groin to try and look butch, before sauntering
to his destiny. He was back. And while the minor details such as plot were
not yet sorted out, it was true that Calendiar's image was unsurpassable.
The threat, though vaguely littered with banana references, was not obvious
yet, and Calendiar had to be content with looking like a hero, but not
being able to use his undeniable skills against a definite enemy. Calendiar
was a professional hero. Only trouble was, he'd got himself stuck in a shitty
little production which would do nothing to enhance his public image. It was
all very well to write dynamic stories about the secret service (minus the
homosexual romps in custard), but this kind of thing was puerile.
    Calendiar slided into the custard, looking for clues. He went under,
managing to avoid the writhing secret service agents around him. He could
see little through his goggles, which was just as well, and felt his way
down to the bottom of the pool of custard. Nothing. He went back up to
the top, and buggered off. So to speak.
    He went to a cheap restaurant, one of the ones that had just installed
a special "dish dirtying" machine, so you'd KNOW it was cheap when you
ate there. Ordering a salad (to quick march into his mouth), he noticed
it. The mysterious banana motif on the waiters aprons. Not just a normal
average painted on logo, or a toxic plastic thing stitched on, but the
actual remains of a long-half-eaten banana.

MOTOR RACING
A new development in motor car racing was announced today; one that will
revolutionise grand-prix, touring, and motorcycle racing. In recent years,
vehicles have been daubed all over with advertising slogans for sponsoring
companies. It was discovered recently that the paint and stickers on
vehicles actually accounts for a great deal of extra weight on top of the
actual car itself. Therefore, all teams have announced that from now on,
NO advertising will be put on cars, saving up to 5% on lap times from
lighter vehicles.
    Sponsor messages will be limited to the pit-crew's jackets. This
means, of course, that all the vehicles racing will be plain white, which
may cause some confusion. But the teams hope to have this sorted out soon
by having them identifiable using a number of different patterns and
colours, including plain colours, stripes and polka-dots.


Meanwhile, the Frod Motor Company  has announced a new breakthrough. The
plasticine motor car. Whilst the chassis of the car is normal, the
bodywork is entirely plasticine, meaning easy adaptation from sportscar to
station-wagon to luxury limousine. And while the car has had some problems
in high wind, with both air-bubbles and a strange tendency to fall apart,
Frod are confident that these, as well as the slight safety problems (the
car has been described as "fucking dangerous" by motoring associations)
will be overcome and that this new breed of motor car will be all the rage
in the nineties.
    In fact, some of the safety problems have already been solved. New
models will now be made with Silly Putty, which bounces. When hitting an
object, the car will still fall apart in dozens of bits probably killing
the occupants, but it *will* bounce. And there'll be no problems in
cutting bodies out of the wreckage. What's more, a plasticine car is NEVER
wrecked, because a little manipulation of the plasticine will mean it
looks like new!
    It was thought that theft of the cars might be a problem, but trials
proved that 97% of all car thieves are intelligent enough to know not to
steal a useless heap of crap like that.

                NEW FROD PLASTA - HAVE YOU DRIVEN A FROD LATELY?


Meanwhile, a plan to develop plasticine houses has also emerged. Although
prone to burglary, the house would be cheap, easy to renovate, and even
portable; the whole of it being able to be rolled up into a big ball of
plasticine... bringing a new dimension to the phrase "moving house".
Research on both schemes has been sponsored by the major world
manufacturers of plasticine. While the cars will be made in the USA by
Frod, the houses will most likely be constructed in South Korea.


Meanwhile, in South Korea, the people have once more being protesting
against an oppressive dictatorship, the deaths of their comrades at the
hands of police, and the fact that they are one of the only countries in
the world where Beta is more popular than VHS.
    Meanwhile, the United Nations has been forming a plan to impose trade
sanctions on countries still using Beta. The move, put forward by Japan
and the United States, and coincidentally supported by the JVC company,
would mean that UN forces would search suspected areas, hunting out Beta
owners and subjecting them to public humiliation.
    The USSR supported the move, the Soviet delegate commenting, "In my
country, Beta owners are laughed at in the street."
    The Chilean delegate countered this by saying, "In my country, Beta
owners are taken out and shot!"
    The South African delegate mentioned, "In my country, the coloureds
are forced to use Beta. VHS is a white man's format."
    And the United States delegate rounded up the discussion, by saying,
"In my country, Beta owners are made to watch PTL."


Meanwhile, the American PTL television network, as a entirely Christian
and virtuous move, has made a huge donation to the Bangladesh relief fund.
The donation, which PTL described as "the gift of life" and "the biggest
gift we have ever bestowed to our fellow man", is of 10,000 videotapes of
sermons given by Jimmy and Tammy Bakker.

**BY MR LUXURY-YACHT (DANIEL BOWEN)********************tcwf@gnu.ai.mit.edu**


Welcome to the fiftieth TCWF! Yes, we have reached our half-century, as
they'd say in cricket, and the blame falls squarely on YOU, the readers.
Over the past week, tributes have been pouring in from world leaders:

  - "The entire world is appalled by the dreadful act"
             Javier Perez de Cuellar (United Nations) (peacelover@un.uucp)

  - "We are deeply shocked..."
                           Mikhail Gorbachev (USSR) (gorby@kremlin.gov.su)

  - "tragic"         Bob Hawke (Australia) (hawkie@lodge.canberra.gov.aus)

  - "I found this news absolutely dismaying..."
                      Edith Cresson (Premier, France) (edith@paris.gov.fr)

  - "..just appalling"    George Bush (USA) (bigboss@white-house.wash.gov)

Stay tuned for more tragedy, coming right up.

ALIEN INVASION IMMINENT

It now known that an alien species has been watching this planet for
several years now. They have sent their scouts ahead, who have infiltrated
much of the civilised world. Thousands upon thousands of them live in our
big cities, inconspicuously placed. They can be found on many street
corners.. watching, ever vigilant. The little green men are among us.
Hidden in our traffic lights. Our raving reporter, Arnold Psychopath,
disguised as a little green man, infiltrated a secret little green man
meeting, at the Guild Of Little Green Men Who Want To Take Over The World.
A little green man army is said to be being raised, armed with lethal
bananas. Many of the little green men present were in fact well known
politicians, scientists, other significant public figures and New Kids On
The Block.

AND NOW FOR MORE BLACK COMEDY.
Hullo dere! Dis is de Rasta-News! Dah Prime Minister today went down da
beach cruisin' man. He had himself a real mellow time... [Was this just an
excuse to run the Jive program? Probably not. But it sure looks dat way.]

ROADWORKS:

HUDSON'S ROAD, SPOTSWOOD: The railway level crossing near Spotswood
Station will be closed for track work from 7.30pm tomorrow until 4.30pm on
Wednesday.

BURWOOD AVENUE, HAWTHORN: Burke Road to Burwood Road, closed to through
traffic until about mid-October.

COTHAM ROAD, KEW: Outbound traffic restricted to tram tracks from Uvadale
Grove to Florence Avenue until about January 2007.

MILLERS ROAD, BROOKLYN: Westgate Freeway to Blackshaw Road, road
reconstruction will restrict traffic to one lane each way until about 31
May. A roadworkers' strike will then delay construction another three
months, followed by an earthquake later in the year that will require
complete reconstruction of the area. An industrial chemical accident early
next year will cause most of the western suburbs to become inhabitable for
the rest of the century, resulting in heavy traffic leading out of the
area. In 2032, worldwide pollution will cause the world to end, meaning
widespread panic, the death of the entire human race, and traffic delays
in most areas.

MACBETH, ACT 5, SCENE 9  -  WITHIN THE CASTLE

[Retreat and flourish. Enter with Drum and Colours, Malcolm, Siward, Ross,
Thanes and Soldiers]

MALCOLM: I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.

SIWARD: Yes, they were due an hour ago. Damned late trains.

MALCOLM: Macduff is missing, and your noble son.

ROSS: Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt:
      He only lived but till he was a man,
      The which no sooner had his prowess confirmed
      In the unshrinking station where he fought
      But like a man he died.

SIWARD: Are you trying to tell me he's dead? At a railway station? A train
        accident, or some sort of riot? Or perhaps a football game?

ROSS: Ay, and brought off the field: your cause of sorrow
      Must not be measured by his worth, for then
      It hath no end.

SIWARD: Well well well, poor old Siward Junior, and I thought he'd get to
        play the whole match. I'm gonna have to have a word with that
        coach. Where is he, in the grandstand, or on the interchange
        bench, down the front?

ROSS: Ay, on the front.

SIWARD: Well, Young Siward had a good game. He's improved his form since
        last season, too. But I'll be sorry to see him out of the team.

MALCOLM: He's worth more sorrow,
         And that I'll spend for him.

SIWARD: What are you on about? Ah, who's that approaching? It's ol'
        Macduff- whatcha got there, 'duff mate?

[Enter Macduff, with Macbeth's head.]

MACDUFF: Hail, king! for so thou art. Behold, where stands
         Th'unsurper's cursed head

SIWARD: Jesus Christ Macduff, what the fuck are you doing? Whose head is
        that?

MACDUFF: the time is free

SIWARD: You'll be doing time all right if you get caught with that head!

MACDUFF: I see thee compassed with thy kingdom's pearl,

[Enter Inspector Unnecessary-Violence, Sergeant Flatfoot]

SIWARD: Shit, it's the pigs!

INSPECTOR: All righty.. what 'ave we 'ere?

MACDUFF, MALCOLM, ROSS, OTHERS: Siward did it!

SIWARD: You bastards.

INSPECTOR: Okay Siward, your number's up.

SIWARD: I never touched him!

MACDUFF: Yes he did officer, we all saw him go up to poor old Macbeth with
         an axe, lop his head off and plant it on me so I'd get in
         trouble. Euch.. horrible it was, with blood everywhere. Talk
         about "out out damn spot", it was all over the bloody place!

INSPECTOR: Siward, you are under arrest for the lopping off of Macbeth's
           head. You do not have to say anything, but we'll probably beat
           the shit out of you if you don't cough up, so you may as well
           admit it right now. Cuff him, sergeant.

And penultimately...

WORLDWIDE JOKE SHORTAGE:
Comedians everywhere are suffering due to the worldwide joke shortage. If
you have any spare jokes lying around the house that you don't want
anymore, please, give them to someone who can use them. Don't hesitate.
Jokes over two lines long are tax-deductible.


And finally...

AN ANNOUNCEMENT:

last paragraph that the author doesn't exist, this has been the final of
the Toxic Custard Workshop Files.
