Okay, okay, so we know you got a message two weeks ago saying the sequel      (
to TCWF would be known as Noxious Pudding. But the truth, the utter truth     n
is that a volkswagen of Toxic terrorists from Canada burst into the           o
Workshop and demanded on pain of tickling that we keep the name the same.     t
And as the tickling was to be done with barbed wire on the soles of our
feet, who were we to argue?                                                   t

The man with the biggest feet in the world, Irish-born, Italian-raised        t
Giovanni O'Shamus caused an upset at Wimbledon during the week, when he
stepped on his opponent in the first round of the Men's Singles. The          i
squashed man, American Rocky Steinburger was rushed to hospital but was       t
pronounced flat on arrival. O'Shamus, who is ranked forty-three thousandth    '
in the world, claimed he had been unable to see because John McEnroe's ego    s
had got in the way, obscuring most of the court, making it too dark to see
where he was going.                                                           a

ART NEWS
The art world was rocked yesterday at the announcement of Professor Hans      a
Von Fabre of the discovery of a new primary colour. The fourth primary        n
colour, to be known as hans, will revolutionise art and technology all        y
over the world. TV News services worldwide have not been able to broadcast
pictures of the new colour because TV sets are manufactured to generate       S
pictures from blue red and green, but not hans. Electronics companies have    h
welcomed the new colour, saying it will increase their income by making       a
everyone go out to buy new TVs and computer monitors. Art critics have        k
acclaimed hans as being able to bring a new lease of life to the art          e
world.                                                                        s

HORSE RACING
Tragedy struck the owners of Fast Sausage yesterday when the horse was        w
accidentally put in the wrong horse-box and sent to be slaughtered and        e
turned into 200 cans of dog-food. The owners said that they don't mind        l
very much, and look forward to getting rid of more useless horses this        l
way. Fast Sausage's descendants, two ponies (Pork Sausage and Long            ,
Sausage) will be cared for by the St Pharlap's Home for Orphaned Horses.

Just a quick note to say that the money raised from the Save The              w
Orphans Bingo Night was a princely $157, but that on the instructions         e
of the bishop, $80 of that has gone to the Church's investment fund.          e
In the three o'clock at Flemington, apparently.                               k

I hope the orphans are well.  Little urchins, some of them.  Have you
recovered the orphanage front door yet?  And I hope that delivery man         T
is out of intensive-care.  Regards,                                           C

We are very proud to announce that next Friday the 5th of July 1991 is       a
World Spit In A Rich Bastard's Face day. Millions of people worldwide        r
will take the opportunity to get-back at rich bastards around the
globe. Not only is the event going to raise charity money, it will           o
also be immense fun for the majority of the participants (ie, the            h
spitters).
    A representative of the Rich Important People's Occidental               d
Fellow's Federation (a well known rich-bastard's association) claimed        e
that anyone in the entire world who even considered thinking about           a
spitting in one of their member's faces would be violently threatened,       r
made unemployable and probably sued out of existence.                        ,
    However, organisers of the day have expressed their disagreement,
saying that they have found a loophole in international law that makes       h
it legal to spit in the face of anyone earning more than $75,000 per         e
year.                                                                        r

Police are investigating the mysterious collision between a car and a        y
fast moving tree on the Nepean Highway earlier in the week. A police         o
spokesman said he'd personally beaten up ten people in the past              u
fortnight before he realised the microphone was on. He then went on to
say that the "Black Box" drive-recorder had been recovered from the          a
wreckage of the car, and had been analysed. He said that a transcript        r
of the last moments of the car before the collision had been prepared,       e
and that he had listened to it, but that no, the media couldn't report
it. He commented that perhaps that joke would be expanded at a later         a
date.                                                                        g
    All occupants of the car thankfully escaped uninjured, but most of       a
the occupants of the tree, including a rare type of owl, were killed         i
in the collision. The driver of the car swore blind to police that the       n
tree had come from nowhere at high-speed, without even using its             ,
indicators.

FUN-RUN REEBOK MASSACRE                                                      a
The 1991 New York Fun-Run-let's-dash-through-the-city-out-of-breath-         d
and-die-of-heart-attacks-afterwards-Marathon was struck by tragedy           i
half an hour into the event, when local neighbourhood gunmen opened          n
fire on the runners. When the police arrived a short while afterwards        g
(as they occasionally do when massacres occur), they found more than
250 dead joggers, all missing their Reeboks. Blame has been placed           t
equally on the professional Reebok re-selling gang involved and the          h
kind of idiots who pay more than $250 for a matching set of two rubber       i
and leather containers for feet.                                             s
    Rumours abound that the real people behind the affair are in fact
a consortium of Reebok's rivals in the shoe business (there's no             d
business like.. no no no). Nike's advertising agency recently came up        r
with a slogan that said "Okay, so you can get killed bungee-jumping in       i
Nike's shoes if you're stupid enough to attach the rope like that, but       v

Dear Father Harry,                                                           o

Thank you for your note of last week, it's always a pleasure to hear
from you. I was delighted to hear of the Bingo Night proceeds. The           h
Bishop recently asked for a portion of our grocery budget for Church         a
purposes, too. He muttered something about St Trifecta's Holy Convent.       v
The orphans are adapting well to the change in our menu, which is a          e
relief. (Coincidentally, the Sisters and I are expecting to earn quite
a hefty sum upon publication of our cookbook, "1,095 Ways to Serve           a
Gruel".)                                                                     n

We are hoping to use some of the proceeds from the cookbook to replace       t
the front door; meantime thank God the weather has been mild. We've          h
been using the large crucifix, which some of the older boys pried            i
down from over the altar, to dissuade would-be trespassers.                  n
                                                                             g
Yes, all of the orphans are well, though little Brian is still
suffering a bit with the flash burns, and yet another delivery man has       b
succumbed to their pranks. It's as well that they couldn't find any          e
nails or we might not have been able to get him down from the "front         t
door".                                                                       t

Hoping you'll be back to celebrate a mass for us soon,                       r

MEGABOGUE IN COURT AFTER CONCERT RAMPAGE                                     e

Contraversy continues to dog heavy-metal band Megabogue. After the           e
concert riot during their recent "Guns And Bogans" tour, some fans
involved in it have begun legal proceedings against them. During the         w
concert, rhythm guitarist Vimmy "The Thorn" Halen went into a wild           e
frenzy and attacked members of the audience who he claimed had quite
clearly been listening to the music. Vimmy took a conveniently placed        a
machete and jumped into the audience, chopping three people up into          r
small pieces. He was aided by security staff, one of whom commented          e
later "yeah well, the band pay our wages."
    The rest of the band joined in the fighting, including drummer           a
Slasher Rists, who, though having lost his arms and legs in a 95 car         g
pile-up during a tour of Toxic Custard #15, managed to bite several ears     a
off. Including, with some difficulty, one of his own.                        i
    Bonk Mee, the peaceful and laid-back poet, lyricist, bass player and     n
shouter of the band hit people over the head with his guitar, while          ,
Harry "Headbanger" Wall, the lead guitarist, got some explosives out of
his sports bag and blew up the entire concert hall.                          y
    After an interval, the concert continued.                                o

      aid of any painkillers, die, get buried in the Celebrity Graveyard     ,
      over there, resurrect yourself, walk through two hundred metres of
      marshland without sinking, fly to the moon and back with the aid       w
      of only a small potato, burst the balloons which are pumped full       r

Thanks for your mail. I bring grave tidings today. I have been informed      .
by the police that one of the young boys from the orphanage has been
arrested on suspicion of arson. They say that after the football game
last week against the local school, where the orphans lost by 3 points,
he went and torched the school. I of course assured them that the boy in
question, young Brian Hitler, could not have done such a thing, and in       P
fact is a paragon of virtue, apart from that incident at the synagogue       a
last year.                                                                   t

I'm glad to hear that the orphans are coping with their change of diet       e
due to lack of funds. Early next week I'll be dropping in with something     t
for them; a little abandoned puppy-dog we found last week. I do hope         i
they like it. Kind regards,                                                  c

Calendiar, almost forgotten by now, trudged into view. Who would read
his exploits back here, at the end? He would be better to return the         n
week after, in a more significant spot in the file. If he could be           i
bothered at all. Thus surrealist stuff wasn't really leading anywhere.       c
Or was it? Did anyone know? Did anyone care? "I'll be back - that's a        e
promise", he muttered.

Calendiar knew this was an emergency. He had to get back into the Toxic      I

nothing else to be done. He called the File Brigade.

Once more back in a prominent position  (on  top  of  a pedestal in the      t
middle  of  Swanston  Street),  Calendiar  crowed  gloatingly.  Then he
sparrowed. Then he ducked, as someone started throwing fruit at him, in      t
an attempt to dislodge him. Calendiar decided to  continue  in the duck      h
vain,  and to duck like a duck that's ducking after  having  been  shot      i
during the  duck season. He moved downwards, fast. Until he reached the      n

dirt cheap. *Dirt* cheap. And yet, dirt was nowhere on the list. A list      n
of  foodstuffs. Correction. A list of stuff, some  of  which  could  be      e
loosely described as food. Some were common, some not so common.
                                                                             r
    For instance:                                                            e
        - A horse tongue                                                     a
        - A truckload of used potato peelings                                d
        - Two truckloads of offal
        - 3 feet from a turtle                                               t
    and so on. You get the general idea.  The mission had been given to      h
Calendiar,  he incorrectly presumed, by Scottish Intelligence.. because      e
his contact's  surname  was  Mc  something.. In fact Calendiar was on a      s
top-secret  mission collecting the ingredients for  McDonald's  Chicken      e
McNuggets.
                                                                             b
    Calendiar looked suspiciously at the crowd nearby.  A demonstration      i
of  the  Surrealists  for  Humanity  In   Today's  Society  group  were      t
demonstrating loudly in the  street,  over  a  member  of  theirs being      s
sacked  from  the  position  of  media  court-room  sketch-artist,  for      ,
painting  the defendant in a fraud case with a little too much zeal. If
the surrealists  had  their  way,  Calendiar  thought,  he'd be back in      w
Tobago investigating ostriches killed by bananas. He was  determined  -      o
there  would  be  no  more bananas in his adventures. Calendiar ignored      u
surrealists,  and  waltzed  penetratingly  the   other   way  down  the      l
Strelitzia.                                                                  d

Parents' groups have protested against the recent trend of nice movies       b
coming out of Hollywood. They compiled a list of 270 nice acts in the        o
latest Disney movie, "Bambi and John Go Out To Play In The Garden".          t
    A spokesman for concerned parents, Martin Believable, commented.         h
"How on earth can we teach our kids to grow up to become psychopathic        e
killers if they're constantly subjected to all this niceness? In this        r
latest Disney film, there is not one machine-gun murder. No crazed
axe-killings, and not even a serial rapist."                                 p
    Mr Believable quoted a recent case where as a direct result of           u
viewing the Bambi film, a child in Florida in the United States had          t
shared a packet of sweets with another child.                                t
    "This is tragedy in the making. When will the film-producers             i
realise what they're doing to society?", said Mr Believable, before          n
going home to kill his wife.                                                 g

Dear Father Harry,

Thank you for the mail, grave though it was.  I'm quite concerned about
little Brian's court appearance, but I am sure the Lord will take care
of it all (lest Brian release those photos of the Lord's wife and
you-know-who to the papers...One would think that the wife of a public
official would exercise more discretion!)  Ah well, "judge not, that ye
might be judged".

The orphans were delighted with the puppy.

It's amazing what Sister Cook can do with just a simple casserole...         e
reminds me of the parable of the loaves and fishes.                          s

Father, I must go...I hear screaming in the courtyard. What have those
children got up to now, I wonder.                                            I

God bless,                                                                   w

Armed with a bloody big gun.
Fred Daly went to the street today,                                           s
Convinced he was Attila the hun.                                              i
He'd seen a Rambo film once too much,                                         d
Then gone down the street to fulfil his grudge,                               e

Clever little Fred Daly,                                                      s
Has got his ma-chine gun,

He'll be runn-ing round the woods,                                            s
Blasting everything he sees,                                                  s
Because he thinks he should.                                                  a

Fred went to a big gun shop,                                                  e
And brought himself a gun,                                                    s
Because he is allowed to-o-o-o.                                               .

Now everybody's running for their lives,                                      Y

Imagine my surprise when hearing of the news that a local shop has            s
donated a new VCR and television to the orphanage. When I confirmed it        l
with the proprietor, he glanced nervously at some of the orphans who were     y
nearby (with their baseball bats, ready for the next game), and hastily
nodded confirmation of the donation.                                          o
                                                                              n
I am delighted to say that the orphans have been putting this equipment       e
to good use; having found them watching an educational film called
"Chainsaw of Lust" whilst looking for you late yesterday. I didn't see        o
any of the film myself, but they looked enthalled in it. I must dash- I       f
have to see what the two policemen who have just walked in want.

Israel has declined to join in Middle East peace-talks proposed by the
US, not, they say, because they refuse to negotiate, but because they
have been invited to a party that night, and they know it's a DREADFUL
bore, but they did promise to go.
    A second date proposed for peace-talks had to be scrapped when Jordan
said they couldn't arrange a baby-sitter in time. The United States has
now countered these rejections by saying that for the talks to go ahead,
everyone must behave, like Syria. Any tantrums, and it'll be called off,
and each misbehaving party will have its bottom soundly smacked. Israel
immediately began sulking, the PLO moaned, and Lebanon said it wouldn't
go unless it got a lollypop and an icecream. Israel took one of Lebanon's
lollypops in 1967; the Israeli government have refused to hand it back.
