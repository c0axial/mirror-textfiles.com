*Readers have recently commented on the shrinking size of Toxic               A
Custard. So our raving reporter, Arnold Psychopath, took a look at the        n
size and value for money of the average Toxic Custard Episode.*               o
                                                                              t
How much humour is in Toxic Custard? I looked at TCWF 54, and splitted        h
it.. splut.. splitted.. I spluttered it up by content. Of a total of          e
114 lines, I found the following:                                             r

    Title / signature / copyright                     10 lines (9%)           r
    Plugs- Rocket Roger / back-issues                 11 lines (10%)          u
    Blank lines / Dividing bits to split-up bits                              s
               to keep them apart from other bits     22 lines (19%)          h
    Actual humour                                     71 lines (62%)          e
                                                                              d
As you can see, the humour in TCWF 54 only accounts for 62% of the
file. In the old days, before the deregulation of the computer humour         o
industry, laws ensured that a file was at least 75% funny. TCWF 3, for        n
example was some 80% humour! Bring back the old days, that's what I           e
say.
    When we spoke to the author, in a concrete bunker fifty feet below        I
the wreckage of his bedroom, he claimed it was due to the worldwide           '
joke shortage. This is quite obviously complete bullshit, and we urge         m
all readers to protest in the streets, roads, highways and lanes right
now.                                                                          a
    Yes, pick up your placards labelled "More toxic for all" and "We          f
want custard" and shout loudly at people who are unlucky enough to be         r
passing by. If everyone did this, something might or might not be done.       a
The More Custard movement will go a long way. Possibly as far as the          i
state border.                                                                 d
                                                                              .
Please excuse my ramblings. They aren't house-trained yet.                    .

A new tax has been announced which will further increase the costs of         s
running a motor car. The government announced yesterday that motorists        t
will now be charged directly for all the greenhouse gases they burn up        i
driving around.                                                               l
    "This is shocking", a spokesmechanic for the Club of Automobile           l
Reactionaries said. "They are denying our right to drive our nice shiny       ,
clean cars. Who do these people think they are, not letting us burn
fossil fuels? It's not as if the fossils need them anymore. Why should        t
we catch a bus, train or tram to work when there's a perfectly good           h
adjacent road to use?"                                                        a
    When asked what could be done about polluting smog, he suggested          t
"close the window and turn on the air-conditioning. Next thing you know       '
this country will be being run by a bunch of Green-age Mutant Whinger         s
Turtles."

The police force has claimed a crime-fighting victory, announcing that        e
the number of robberies, assaults and other crimes occuring in doughnut
shops has fallen to zero. Operation Doughnut, which has been going for        w
as long as anyone can remember, has seen every doughnut shop have at          a
least one police officer assigned to it. When asked about the high and        y
possibly co-incidental increase in street-crime, burglaries, murder,
rape, armed-robbery and drug-dealing recently, a police spokesman,            i
Constable Suidae said that if people felt unsafe on the streets or in         t
their homes, the best thing to do was to go and buy a nice hot
doughnut.                                                                     g

After the START signing last Wednesday in Moscow by Bush and Gorbachev,       s
an explosion rocked the Kremlin after Gorbachev dropped his pen onto a        .
concrete floor. The pen, made from scrapped missiles, was destroyed in        .
the explosion, which blew a hole in the wall big enough for a Lada with
no steering to get through. The Pentagon are now investigating what           Y
happened to the rest of the batch of 50,000 pens made from the scrapped       o
missiles. Allegations have been made that most of the pens were               u
purchased by the Iraqi government. The United Nations will formally ask
Baghdad to report on the current status of all Iraqi pens. Rumours are        s
afoot that the US Air Force is installing Liquid-Paper anti-pen               n
missiles into their bombers in preparation for a bombing raid to              i
destroy the pens.                                                             v

You must have written your last note to me from the PC here at the            d
convent, as you did eventually succeed in finding me late in the              e
evening.  I often take comfort in cleaning the sacristy when I am             r
troubled, as you now know I was.                                              s

Viewing the educational video the orphans brought home, "Chainsaw of          w
Lust", raised many questions in my mind... all of which you answered to       i
my expectations that night. Thank you.                                        l

And in particular, I want to thank you for taking the time to hear my 
confession. The penance you gave me was quite, quite hard; however,           j
your penances always leave me feeling so satisfied... I am certain they       u
do my soul boundless good!                                                    s

AUSTRALIAN BUREAU OF STATISTICS

C E N S U S  -  6 AUGUST 1991

WHY A CENSUS?
The Census is like a stocktake of our nation. That's why the entire
nation stops while it happens. Not that anyone notices the difference.
After the stocktake has finished, we'll throw out any damaged or soiled
people, and have HUGE discounts on all of last season's fashions.

COLLECTION AUTHORITY
The information asked for is collected under the authority of the Census
and Statistics Prying Gestapo Privacy Invasion Act.

CONFIDENTIALITY
None.

WHEN?
When what?

WHEN IS THE CENSUS?
Census Night is Tuesday 6th August 1991.

WHEN SHOULD THE CENSUS FORM BE FILLED IN?
Anytime really. Who cares? Just get on with it.

VIRTUAL REALITY BREAKTHROUGH                                                  N
The NASA Ames Research Center have announced a breakthrough in Virtual        o
Reality. They have simulated the entire world within a computer. This is
the second attempt. The first time, they fed in all the information           r
about the world into the computer, data containing every detail about         o
the planet, and the behaviour and characteristics of the people who live      o
on it, what happens, where; everything. They ran the computer simulation      m
at high-speed for several months before simulated pollution and
simulated UV-rays killed every simulated thing on the simulated face of       f
the simulated earth. The programmers looked for bugs, but couldn't find       o
any.                                                                          r
    This second attempt has resulted in a "nice" world to live in. A
world without oppression, crime, anger and hunger. And it only cost $43       m
million billion to generate. Thank goodness the money is being spent on       u
something peaceful.                                                           c

"inferior beings" in the small town of Ventangersdorp where a                 e
"back-stabbing bastard betrayer" was speaking in the almost aptly named
Kommando hall. They were protesting about the proposed introduction of        t
democracy.                                                                    h
    "It's not fair!" a recently not deloused representative in a brown        a
shirt shouted incoherently above the noise of machine-gun fire. "How          t
dare they put us on the same level as those black bastards? We are the
superior beings. We obey no-one." He then disappeared to help attack a        i
mini-bus of them.                                                             s
    A.W.B.B.B.B. leader Eugene Terre'Ism later condemned the Police for
trying to stop members attacking passing blacks. "It is our white             i
right, right? That's what this country should stand for. Equality,            n
freedom and wealth for absolutely everyone as long as they're white
church-going heterosexual conservative racists who speak Afrikaans.           q
Squalor, oppression and poverty for the rest of them. That's how this         u
country should be run. It has been for years; why change tradition?" Mr       e
Terre'Ism has proclaimed that he will lead a new white nation into            s
prosperity, to last a thousand years.                                         t
                                                                              i

Calendiar casually strolled down to the corner. It was one of those odd       S
street corners, which wasn't so much a corner as a right-angle. He            o
looked casually each way, scouring the background for movement.               m
Nothing. A frog bounced by. Calendiar's last mission had ended when           e
he'd been arrested for crimes against the chemical disposal laws. Of
course, they'd got him off. Nothing simpler. The influences of                p
Calendiar's department reached everywhere. And they would stop at             e
nothing to influence a judge. They wouldn't even stop at a                    o
gift certificate from a massage parlour. And they hadn't.                     p
    Calendiar stood still for several minutes, deliberately, to               l
confound any moves to have him adapted into a cartoon strip. Popsicle         e
hissed at him from behind a streetlamp. "Stop hissing at me", replied
Calendiar. "Watcha want? What are you doing back there?"                      h
    "I don't know, but I think something surprising is about to happen.       a
And then something vicious."                                                  v
    Surprisingly, the street filled with people. People everywhere.           e
Popsicle struggled to move, the crowds pressing in on him. Everyone was
there, it seemed, from the Reverend Skilbey to Alfredo Cappucino.             m
    Even more surprisingly, and suddenly, the street was calm, as the         e
shoppers continued to window-shop, and sip coffee. Quiet, mild mannered       n
Arnold Psychopath, recently resurrected, had arrived on the scene with        t
his AK-47 and machete, about to do something vicious, in an obvious           i
comment about gun control by the author. But he would be stopped. This,       o
after all, was a civilised country. A madman can't simply run around          n
shooting people and get away with it. There are laws to protect               e
people's lives.                                                               d
    Inspector Unnecessary-Violence put his hand on Arnold's shoulder.
"You can't fuckin' do that", he said. "Gimme your gun licence."               t
    Arnold, quite reasonably for a crazed psychopath, showed him the          h
licence.                                                                      a
    "Hmm, quite fuckin' legal. Thank you. Now kindly fuckin' move along       t
please sir."

Dan Quayle's reaction on Monday to the news that Gorbachev had been           e
deposed and the Vice-President had taken power: "Oh, have I really?"
                                                                              s
Anyway, the attempted Soviet coup is over now, and Communism is dying.        i
Party activity has been outlawed in all state bodies.. so I guess             l
they'll have to go to discos. And of course, the world may never see          l
the new model Revolutionary Lada 9L Washing Machine, made in the Soviet       y
Union, with built-in political agitator.
                                                                              s
I wonder if you've met my pet Rik Aster. He's my pet *. The great thing       i
about *s is that they just sit there on your screen, not doing very           d
much at all. *s don't need to be fed or anything. You can backspace           e
over them at will if you'd prefer them not to be on your paragraphs,          w
but settle them down anywhere. Your pet * isn't fussy. And they're            a
delightful little critters, too. But please don't maltreat your *, or         y
you might be reported to the RSPC*.                                           s

You know how when you want to carry a heavy load but the shop only has        m
fairly weak and flimsy plastic bags.. and they give you two; one inside       e
the other. How come your load doesn't break through one, then break           s
through the other, then break some more.. break into little bits on the       s
ground? No, don't answer that.. it's probably something to do with            a
physics, but I was never very good at that, and I'd far rather remain         g
thinking that it's one of the great unanswered mysteries of the world.        e
                                                                              s

(HAVE A SLICE OF) DEADLY RADIOACTIVE TOXIC CUSTARD


Take 200 grams of politically conservative redneck voter. Carefully
sift out all the brains. Put the remains in a saucepan on a low heat,
add prejudices and stir until thickened. Pop in a drop of raw hatred
and some paranoia and leave to simmer for a couple of elections,
stirring occasionally. And presto! Gun lobby activist!

Or, if you find that totally repulsive, why not try some Toxic Custard?

He was definitely lost. Somewhere. He scoured the horizon. Sand to the        I
north (or what, since he had no compass, he would call the north for          t
the moment.. just for argument's sake. It might well be east, or south        '
by south west, it didn't really matter). Sand to the east. Sand to the        s
south of him, and sand to the wes.. oh bugger, had he turned too far?
Was that west, or was he looking north again. No, it didn't really            t
matter, because it was certainly very sandy. A bit too bloody sandy. I        e
mean, you might think the beach was pretty sandy sometimes, but that          r
was nothing to the predicament that Calendiar was in this time. He            r
looked around again, longing to be somewhere where the storyline at           i
least went somewhere, and where the continuity between episodes could         b
be checked.                                                                   l
    Calendiar thought back to the street corner he had been hanging           y
around last week, and decided that if it wasn't a figment of his
imagination, then he wished it had been, because he hadn't liked it           a
very much. He wondered about wandering, then stopped. He looked down at       n
the portable scrabble game he had somehow collected somewhere, for some       n
reason which was bound to be explained in the next few lines; probably        o
just a cheap way to get a joke. There were only four letters in this          y
one; it was an economy version. D A S and N were the letters.                 i
    Calendiar frowned. And who could blame him? Not me. Nor you, I            n
suspect. He looked up. Well, at least it wasn't sand. Then he looked          g
down, mostly because he hadn't done so yet, and was astonished to find        ,
a (this is not the astonishing bit) trapdoor, underneath which was a
short passage (neither is this the astonishing bit) leading to (we're         b
coming up to the astonishing bit around about now) a rather nice hotel,       u
where he checked in.                                                          t
    "Hi!" said the receptionist in a poor imitation of either a French
accent. "Welcome to the Hotel Sable. I'm Sandy."                              I
    "So am I", replied Calendiar," so would you show me to my room so I       '
can have a shower and get on with the plot?"                                  v
    After his shower, Calendiar went down to the garages to find his          e
smog-producing phallic symbol, and drove off into the next episode.

Sick of going to the shops and paying $1.95, $3.95, $4.95 or whatever         r
for goods? Well, the government has finally come up with a way to             g
lighten our pockets - the 95 cent coin. It will be shaped identical to        o
the $1 coin, but with an 18 degree segment cut out of it. This will           t
make it simple for sight-impaired people to identify.                         t
    Two groups, one supporting the royal family, and the other                e
supporting animal liberation, have opposed this, saying that it will be       n
an act of mutilation of H.M. The Queen on one side of the coin, and the
five kangaroos on the other. The two groups also opposed a proposal           w
last year to directly link the value of the Australian dollar to US           h
currency, by chopping an 80 degree slice out of all coins.                    a

That was another one of those silly Toxic Custard Workshop
