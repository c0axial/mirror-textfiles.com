                     TOXIC CUSTARPEDIA - VOLUME 4

DATABASE
  Developed in the early 1800's, by Rodney Database of Darlington,
  the database is a marvellously efficient way of putting large
  amounts of information into one central repository, never to be
  seen again. The design of the database is now an art form in
  itself, and will usually include:
      - just a dash of normalisation
      - a whole bunch of useless information
      - a whole bunch of fairly important information that no-one will
        ever actually ask to see
      - a whole bunch of very important information which will get
        unexpectedly lost when a hardware fault occurs (eg someone
        presses the wrong button) and the whole of your disk gets
        wiped / paper files get burnt / tape gets melted down into a
        large pudding, thrown out, buried in landfill and split in
        two during an earthquake

DEATH
  Death is the ending of life. But do we really know what death
  involves? No, of course not, that's a stupid question. Only a
  completely brainless nerk with an intellect the size of an atom
  would ask a question like that. But in fact, I have recently
  experienced a near-death experience, when I went to Ballarat. On an
  Easter weekend. During an opera festival. (Okay, so it wasn't
  recently except maybe in a universal cosmic historically vague
  sense).

DEVIL
  A popular character in mythology, commonly blamed by Christians for
  everything from plagues to burnt toast. Of course, if the devil
  ever actually appeared, it would scare these people shitless.

DEWEY, MELVIL (1851-1931)
  American librarian who invented the Dewey Decimal system for
  categorising books in libraries. Unfortunately, he died long before
  the widespread use of computers, meaning that all the zillions of
  books on this subject have to be squashed into 001.64

DEBUSSY, CLAUDE ACHILLE (1862-1918)
  French composer/performer. His confrontational politics and total
  scorn for the status quo led many to believe that this pioneering
  hardcore performer was the only punk act to be on a par with the
  Sex Pistols. Debussy's frenetic rave-ups offer little more than a
  cluttered cacophony of speed and noise.

DICKHEAD
  A close relative of the penis brain, dickheads can be found in all
  the major centres of the universe, doing really irritating and
  stupid things. The term "Dickhead" was coined by explorer Sir Jimmy
  Criquet, who had visited the island of Dikhedos, just off Greece.
  There lives a race of people who spend their entire days getting in
  people's way on footpaths, driving in tram lanes, writing articles
  for the Melbourne Agenda, raising money for the IRA and/or Ulster
  Freedom Fighters, voting in support of French Farmers, evicting
  people one week late with rent, etc etc etc.

DICTIONARY
  A book, generally in alphabetical order, which lists the
  definitions of a number of words. It is often postulated that
  persons who are unfamiliar with the spellings of words should refer
  to dictionaries. This is of course bullshit, 'cos if you don't know
  how the word's spelt, how are you going to find it? The people that
  make this sort of suggestion are probably child-molesting Osmond
  fans who enjoy anal sex with kangaroos in the corridors of mental
  hospitals...
      I'm sorry. But it's been bothering me lately.

DISCOUNT
  The art of making shoppers feel happier about having just bought
  something by letting them know that they didn't get as badly
  ripped-off as they would have if they'd bought it when the discount
  didn't apply.

DONATION
  Often promoted as the best way of getting rid of your money while
  feeling good about it, donation in fact has the opposite effect.
  The vast majority feel awkward as they hand over the money,
  clumsily trying to avoid the $50 note in their pocket.
      A much better way to get rid of money while feeling good is to
  go out and by a whoppingly expensive consumer appliance.

DULL
  Yes it is, isn't it.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

"LOSING MY CONNECTION"            REM / "STATEMENT"

Oh disk, is smaller
Smaller than you and you are not me
The backups I will go to
The distance between tapes

Oh no I've filled the disk
I filled it up

That's me in the system
That's me at the login
Losing my connection
Trying to stay logged in

And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no I've grepped too much
Couldn't grep enough

I thought that I heard deleting
I thought that I heard you say
I think I thought the files were safe

Every print-out of every waking hour
I'm dumping all my data
Trying to keep my files on you
Like a hurt lost and blinded LAN... LAN
Oh no I saved too much
I saved it all

Consider this
Consider this bug of the century
Consider this the bug
That brought DOS to its knees

What if all these data dumps come spewing out
And now I've printed too much

I thought that I heard you printing
I thought that I heard you swear
I think I thought I saw you print

That was just a ream
That was just a ream

That's me at the printer
That's me in the print queue
Losing all my source code
Trying to keep coding

And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no I've saved too much
I haven't saved enough

I thought that I heard you PRUNEing
I thought that I saw me save
I think I thought I saw the files

But that was just a dream
File, line, byte, die
That was just a dream
Just a dream, dream

"Winners of the 80's". We'll be profiling Ivor
Fleming, who, while pissed on New Years Eve 1985,
bet all his money and his house that the Space
Shuttle would blow up in 1986.

                    TOXIC CUSTARPEDIA - VOLUME 5
EAT
  Eating is often advised for the hungry, and can often alleviate the
  problems caused by starvation. Many theorists and scientists have
  proposed that eating generally be limited to food. Civil
  libertarians have naturally attacked this as an infringement of the
  rights of the citizens to do really stupid things. In fact the
  Stupid Now! movement has held demonstrations in many major cities.
  Last week's demonstration here in Melbourne was estimated by Stupid
  Now! to be a crowd of twelve, although police estimated only two or
  three people attended. When confronted with the discrepancy, Stupid
  Now! admitted that they had counted an old lady with her shopping
  cart who had stopped to watch the street theatre, two kids running
  along the pavement parallel to the march, and a guy waiting for a
  bus. But they still maintained at least eight people had marched in
  "unity and oneness with the entire strength of the human voice".
  Yeah. What has this got to do with eating? Not much.

ECONOMICS
  Economics is the study of the movements of imaginary monetary
  values around the place. The financial world of the 1990s relies on
  the whims of a bunch of stock-market analysts who enjoy bumping the
  dollar up and down for a laugh. No really, it's true. Last week one
  of them pressed the wrong button and bankrupted a moderately sized
  African country!
      But actually, the study of economics is all about supply and
  demand, import, export, GDP, GDT, GMT, and all that stuff. And then
  of course there's microeconomics, which is when you don't have very
  much money.

EDISON, THOMAS ALVA (1847-1931)
  American inventor. Apparently he was expelled from school for being
  retarded. I wonder if the descendants of whoever made that decision
  have erased this person from their family tree out of embarrassment?
      Edison took out more than 1000 patents during his life,
  including the gramophone, the light bulb, and the megaphone.
  Amongst his lesser known inventions were the electrical powered
  nose cleaner, the inverse heat sensor wok, and the unfortunately
  flawed hand stapler. Mind you, three duds out of 1000 ain't bad.

EGG
  An egg is an oval-shaped object commonly found in saucepans being
  boiled. And perhaps one of the most asked questions of the whole of
  humankind is "How does one time the boiling of one's egg?" Well,
  okay, it's probably not usually that pretentious. But it does
  remain an important and unanswered question, something which is not
  going to be solved by reading some pathetic little electronic
  journal churned out by some guy in Australia who thinks he's still
  at university.

ELASTIC
  Long known for its stretchy qualities, elastic is related to
  rubber, which, should it manage to hold this joke together, can be
  used to mould various shapes. One of the recent movie hits used
  this to good effect, with giant rubber dinosaurs terrorising a
  bunch of rubber actors in an amusement park after breaking out of
  their elastic enclosures. "Elastic Park", that one was. Didn't
  really work, did it? Filled up eight lines though.
  
ELECTRICITY
  Electricity is a marvellous discovery, enabling mankind to harness
  its power to generate huge fuel bills.

ELTON, JOHN
  John Elton was born Harry Webb, and burst onto the music scene in
  1963 after being "discovered" praying in the Cavern Pub, in
  Liverpool. His first major hit came in 1965 with "High Generation",
  in which he encouraged listeners to "blade away", a prediction of
  the rollerblade craze of the early 1990s. Elton's lyrics coupled
  with paint magnate Bernie Taubman's music continued to produce hits
  into the 1990s. By this time, however, the two had decided to give
  up on music, becoming caretakers, and the final album of their
  songs was a tribute by other artists, entitled "Two Brooms".

END
  No, the end is down the bottom. The end can be defined as the final
  moments of existence of something. There is a healthy employment to
  be made in the prediction of the end of the world, especially at
  the moment, as the millennium freaks gear up for the big 2 triple
  zero. Stand-by for the raining frogs, boiling acid, Dante poems,
  etc.

ENTITY
  A word far too cosmic sounding to be involved in systems analysis.

EXTRA
  Well, that's like... extra, innit. More than what would have been
  if there hadn't been extra, if you see what I mean.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

I was looking through the biographical dictionary looking for
material, and it struck me what cool names people used to have, eg:
John The Fearless, Peter The Cruel. Why can't people nowadays have
names that describe their personalities or jobs...
    "Who comes hither, friend or foe?"
         "Tis I, Eric the Analyst!"
    "And who be this with thee, O Eric?"
         "Tis Kevin the Prat! We come in search of thy sales
         receipt ledger specifications!"
    "Then enter, friends! But beware of Daniel the Not Very Good
    Writer."

FACE
  The mass of skin, teeth and other parts that form the front section
  of the head. Faces can be arranged in any number of combinations,
  for differing reactions, such as horror, nausea, and laughter.
  Facial hair can be allowed to grow, principally by men who:
      - want to look like folk-singers
      - make up for the lack of hair on the rest of their head
      - just can't be bothered shaving.
  The increasingly popular "goatee" beard still looks really silly to
  me, I'm afraid. The remainder of the face is generally made up of
  two eyes, a mouth, and a nose. Someone should tell the people who
  make Lego.

FALL
  To drop in altitude rapidly. Audible responses to sudden falling
  should be made as follows:
     IN THE FIELD OF      RESPONSE
     -----------------    ----------------------------------------
     Mountain climbing    Oh shit, I'm going to die
     Aeronautics          Oh shit, we're all going to die
     Stockmarket          Oh shit, we're all going to have heavily
                              reduced equity

FAT
  Research has now shown that Fat is actually an alien life-form
  that travels the galaxy, looking for other beings to attach itself
  to. Fat beings first arrived on Earth in the late 1960s, attracted
  by signals sent into space by the Graceland Observatory in the US.
  Fat beings are now found in most areas of the world, but mostly
  attached to Maggie Tabberrer. There are theories that the
  dispersion of Fat beings from one's body may be achieved by
  performing diet and exercise rituals, but this is pure speculation.
 
FARTBOROUGH, LORD (1783-1827)
  English statesman. He lived all his life at Fartborough Hall, in
  Essex. Fartborough is best remembered for his resounding posterior
  evacuations, from which the most obvious word is coined. Their
  resonation with the brickwork of Fartborough Hall eventually caused
  its collapse, burying Lord Fartborough at last with his revolting
  odour.

FINE
  Term used by weathermen when they don't really know what it's going
  to be like. Of course, if the rest of us made as many mistakes in
  our jobs as weathermen do in theirs, the entire world would be a
  disaster area. "Well guv, I expect if we use this plastic pretend
  bolt to hold up this building, the structure will be FINE with
  possible later collapse on Thursday."

FIRE
  Red and/or yellow hot thing. Don't touch.

FIVE
  The fifth number, except for computer people, who always seem to
  count from zero. The number five was first conquered in the sixth
  century BC by Pythagorus, who was taking time off on his theorem to
  enter a counting competition. He came first, breaking the world
  counting record of the time, and subsequently appeared in the
  Ginthorus Book Of Records.

FREUD, SIGMUND (1856-1939)
  Austrian gynaecologist and founder of psychoanalysis. And a
  down-right pervvy.

FRICK, MR
  The most unfortunate name for a school teacher in the universe.

FUCK
  You've just been waiting for this definition, haven't you. Here is
  how to use the word 'fuck' in almost any conversation.
      NORMAL EXPRESSION                            FUCKING EXPRESSION
      ---------------------                        ------------------
      I am surprised                               Well, fuck me
      Please go away quickly                       Fuck off
      My condition is one of fatigue               I'm fucked
      You seem to have made an error of judgement  You fucked up
      Stop engaging in frivolous activities        Stop fucking about
      He is a person of below average intellect    What a dumb fucker
      That option is not a suitable choice         Fuck that
      I have not made significant progress         I've done fuck all

PHOENIX
  This shouldn't be in here. It just sounds like it starts with an F.

A quick moment of reflection.           .noitcelfer fo tnemom kciuq A

Have you ever wondered why we're here? What are we doing? And where
are we going? If you have, and God knows, most of us feel pretty
existential at times, then why not consider a trip to the Most Holy
Church Warehouse Of The Prophet Fred.
    Fred is not just your average priest. He can and will provide a
full range of ecumenical services at BELOW COST! Direct from the Lord
to you!(*)
    All this week, if you quote this ad, you'll receive seven sins
for the price of five! And a free tenth commandment with every nine!
Trade in your old Testament on a shiny new one! These miracles can't
last, so ride your camel, walk on water, however you get here, just
rush down to the Most Holy Church Warehouse Of The Prophet Fred.

                    TOXIC CUSTARPEDIA - VOLUME 7

GARDEN
  The garden is where all the nasty bugs and insects that you see on
  those wildlife documentaries are. A succession of features on
  spiders, ants, bees and wasps, all filmed using really expensive
  lenses, have left me scared shitless of the slightest bit of
  greenery. I've even been giving the plastic Christmas tree some
  funny looks. Are those sparkly things meant to be on it? Tinsel,
  eh? What genus is that?
      I'm not sure why David Attenborough et al are convinced that we
  need to see a giant 17 inch Huntsman crawling across our screen to
  devour another garden inhabitant. Lucky we haven't got a bigger
  telly. And why do those programmes always concentrate on only two
  events in the species' day? Humping and eating. Don't they get to
  do anything else? Imagine what would happen in a documentary about
  humans. All we get to see is your average human eating Maccas,
  doing the mating dance in the nightclub, followed by the quick
  grope back at his place. It wouldn't exactly cover the full gamut
  of human existence, would it?

GAS
  What liquid turns into if you boil it. The basis for Kernigan's
  Third Law. Kernigan's Five Laws of children's science TV programmes
  are as follows:
     1) Dried ice is interesting
     2) An egg can fit through a milkbottle
     3) Steam looks good and is cheap to make
     4) Mirrors never fail to delight
     5) Magnets the compass maketh

GENERATION, OLDER
  The people that don't understand you.

GENERATION, YOUNGER
  The people that you don't understand.

GENITALS
  The bits of the body that are used specifically for rude purposes.
  They come in varying shapes and sizes, and are used in varying
  ways. Please don't expect a detailed biological examination of
  these most enormously complex body parts, or even a cheap joke
  about the size of penises.
      However, as a tribute to the late, great, Mario Innuendo, from
  here, we will substitute the word "the" with the word "penis" in
  capital letters for the remainder of this TCWF. Nah, on second
  thoughts...

GERM
  Another of those tiny tiny organisms that you can't see, and often
  wonder if they haven't just been made up by scientists to hold
  together the fabric of society. Rumour has it that germs were
  simply designed to get you to wash your hands after going to the
  lav, to keep soap manufacturers in business.

GLASS
  Container which shatters at the most inconvenient and unexpected
  moments. Glasses are known to have properties that cause them to
  throw themselves out of people's hands. Glasses are also specially
  designed not to bounce. On anything.

GOAT
  A horned beast, known to cross troll-infested bridges in packs of
  three. Goats are unable to eat flowers, lest they explode. The
  goats, I mean. It'd be pretty silly if flowers exploded. Then they
  couldn't have florists. They'd become explosists. "Anywhere in the
  world, send a message to show you hate. Intexploder."

GOLDFISH
  Small orange coloured fish designed to fit easily into cat's claws.

GOOD
  The opposite of bad. Just down the road from nice. Around the
  corner from great. A world away from nasty. And simply not related
  to flowerpot.

GRASSY KNOLL
  It's so lucky that someone happened to be filming when JFK got
  shot. Ever since then, they've made sure that there is a camera
  trained on the President 24 hours a day. Which is why we always see
  Bill Clinton jogging, eating McDonalds, etc. About the only thing
  we don't get to see him doing is having a crap in the White House
  Out House.

GREATBIGOSAURUS
  Last of the great dinosaurs, the Greatbigosaurus became extinct
  just last week, when it got run down by a film-crew on its way to
  film a Traffic Accident Commission commercial. Well, come on, if
  you were 65 million years old, you'd be a little slow crossing the
  street too.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Another Custard is come and gone
So now it's time to soldier on
Stop reading for another week
Else you'll look like a complete geek
Old Custards they are still around
But not to be found on the ground
There's plenty more for you to see
All you do is f t p
Want to know where to ftp to?
Then just mail tcwf@gnu.ai.mit.edu

                    TOXIC CUSTARPEDIA - VOLUME 8

HAGGIS
  A Scottish dish made of the heart, lungs, and liver of a sheep,
  chopped up with suet, onions, oatmeal etc, seasoned and boiled in a
  sheep's stomach-bag or substitute. I think I'm going to be sick.
      Have you ever considered the argument that vomit is a lifeform
  in itself, subject to the same foibles as the rest of lifekind?
  Pretty stupid idea, huh? Well, I thought so too, until I was
  convinced by a most holy and devout man, shouting very loudly in
  the street one day. He told me that vomit was food that was reborn.
  He gave me a leaflet about it, and - do you know - it changed my
  life. Suddenly, I could look at vomit the way I had never looked at
  vomit before. It became part of me. I could talk to it, express
  myself to it, and before long, take it for picnics in the forest.
  And the vomit would talk back. It would read me poems. It would
  sing songs about regurgitation. And it would tell me jokes. Very
  bad jokes. It would tell me jokes with incredibly bad punch lines.
  And I eventually came to a conclusion. That vomit is sick.

HAIL
  Like rain, but harder. Meteorologists have conducted studies about
  the weather patterns relating to hail, and the likely occurrence of
  it, and have concluded that it is most likely to hail when you are
  walking down the street without even an umbrella for protection.

HAMMER
  A tool for hurting fingers. Hammers are generally made of a
  specially magnetised metal that is naturally attracted to skin.

HANDKERCHIEF
  A piece of cloth designed specifically to be filled with snot.
  Which must rather irritate it. I mean, I'm sure that you'd be
  pretty pissed off if you had only come into existence to be wiped
  on people's noses. I know I'd be annoyed if people left bogies on
  me. Which is why hankies are fighting back: They endeavour not to
  be in your pocket when you are suffering a sneezing attack.

HAREOKE
  Japanese tradition. The practice of singing a song very badly in
  front of lots of people, then killing yourself out of embarrassment.

HARVEY SMITH
  The gesture made by the more careless visiting American presidents
  to Australians. (Honest.)

HATE
  To dislike something immensely. If you would are interested in
  hate, and would like to take it up as a hobby, contact the Hate
  Everything League. They hold regular meetings at Hate Hall, where
  members read odes to Barry Manilow, sing songs about Volvo Drivers,
  rip Cobol source-code print-outs to shreds, and burn effigies of
  software company support line operators.

HISTORY
  Look, there's no point dwelling on the past, okay? What's done is
  done. It's much better left forgotten. No-one wants to know about
  adolescent foolishness these days, do they? Just leads to
  embarrassment in later life. After all, the damage wasn't all that
  bad, and the RSPCA said they wouldn't press charges. So just forget
  it. (And actually, I reckon the hippopotamus kinda liked it.)

HOLY
  Something containing a lot of holes, such as the Bible.

I'M
  going to get struck down for that one, aren't I? Or at the very
  least, lose both the remaining Christian subscribers.

HONESTY
  Honesty cannot be undervalued. And while I'm on the subject of
  honesty, have I told you about an exciting business opportunity
  that could make you thousands of dollars without hard work or
  expensive capital investment? Yes, bank robbery is an exciting new
  idea, and you could be one of the first to buy an exclusive
  franchise in your area. For just $30,000, we'll provide a fully
  detailed instruction manual on how to do a bank robbery. Ring today
  and we'll include two luxury pure wool dry-cleanable balaclavas,
  perfect for those anonymous jobs when you just don't want to be
  identified on the News.

HORSE
  I begin to seriously doubt the viability of a dictionary that
  defines "horse" as "a soft-hoofed ungulate." A horse is actually
  any four legged creature in a Western movie. Except a cow.
      The horse's major contribution to mankind has been shit. Such
  was the level of horse shit production late last century that
  measures were taken to centralise its disposal. For the last
  hundred years, all the horse shit in Australia has been taken to
  one place for burial: Dubbo, the shithole of Australia.

HUMAN
  The human being either evolved from the biologically very similar
  ape, or was created along with the rest of the world in a six-day
  creative spurt by an anonymous god.
      The human body is a wonderful thing. Well, most of them are.
  Humans have one mouth and a limited number of genitals, which is
  probably just as well.

Toxic Custard is all tired now, and
won't be seen until next week. But in
the meantime, you can enjoy Toxic
Custard back-issues, should your brain
be inclined to do so. Just email
