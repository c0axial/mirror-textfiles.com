                      TOXIC HISTORY OF THE WORLD
               Part 23 of stacks and stacks and stacks

1095 AD
  Pope Urban II summons Christian nations to the First Crusade. He
  sends out flyers:
                        Attention, Christians!
                For the first time, the opportunity to get
                your head knocked off in the name of
                Christianity.
                * Register by July 5th and get a 30%
                  discount on the normal registration fee!
                * Fighting in all the best venues in and
                  around the Middle East
                * Every fifth knight free! Yes, send five
                  knights for the cost of four!

1098
  Crusaders take Antioch. They make it sound so simple in these
  condensed histories, don't they?

1099
  Crusaders take Jerusalem. For at least the third time in the last
  thousand years, the Jerusalem tourist shops cash in. "No kidding
  guv', this is the actual crucifix that Jesus himself got nailed to.
  Honest. Look, you can still see the nails in it. Okay? Sold! Thank
  you sir, see you again soon! ... Ah, good afternoon sir. May I
  interest you in this; it's the actual crucifix that Jesus
  himself..."

1135
  England is plunged into civil war when Stephen, grandson of William
  the Conqueror, allows himself to be elected king although he had
  previously recognised Mathilda, Henry I's daughter, as heir to the
  throne. Hold on, hold on, hold on. "Elected king"?!? So when did
  they stop voting-in royalty? Perhaps this is something that needs
  to be examined further? I wonder what sort of campaigns they ran?
  "Vote Stephen - not just a monarch for today; a monarch for the
  future."

1149
  Second Crusade ends in failure. The Crusaders retreat, to revise
  their strategies. They decide that since most of them took part in
  the First Crusade, over fifty years before, that they should all
  retire and let some new blood do the fighting.

1153
  Stephen acknowledges Mathilda's son as his heir. There may be
  opportunities here for jokes about (i) heir/hair, wigs, toupees,
  etc, or (ii) Stephen dancing with Mathilda. Probably a waltz, ie
  "waltzing Mathilda". Please choose one of these, or make up a joke
  yourself, write it down on a piece of paper, fold into a small
  cigarette shape and stick up your nose.

JUNK

Why is it that desks seem to attract junk? They're natural junk
magnets. And why is it that there are never enough places for the
junk to be moved to during an emergency tidying session?

Why is it that staplers don't have a natural habitat - somewhere you
should be able to reasonably expect them to be. Instead, staplers
roam. They roam around the desk, around the room, around the
building... and around the world. The problem has got so bad that
many offices now have dedicated stationery detectives, who travel the
world, tracking down lost staplers, paper supplies, paperclips, etc.

Junk, of course, has a fascinating trait. It ceases being junk the
*moment* you decide to tidy up. What was a worthless piece of paper
with some scribbles, someone's sketch of a... ummm... well, I'm not
sure what it is... the slice of tree that was not worth its weight in
recycled paper pulp instantly becomes a document vital to the
survival of the human race the moment someone questions whether or
not it should go in the bin. How many times have you looked at a
piece of paper, and found yourself uttering to yourself the immortal
words:

           "Nah, better not throw that out. Might need it".

And so, having made the decision not to throw it out, you have two
choices.

(a) Leave it exactly where it is, in the hope that you will actually
need it sometime in the next fifteen minutes.

(b) File it away in a folder of some sort with other such vital
snippets of information, so it can be sorted, out of the way,
completely lost if you actually do need it again, and thrown out with
the whole folder the next time there's a clean-out.

THE DENTIST

Richmond isn't just where you change to and from loop trains. It's
also where I go to the dentist. We all know how essential it is to go
to the dentist regularly. But most of us don't unless we're forcibly
dragged there. And why? Because no matter how nice the dentist might
personally be... it doesn't matter if the dentist chats to you,
smiles as you arrive, or even decides the entire treatment is free,
it's still scary, and bloody painful.

The signs are there the moment you walk into the place. The posters
advising you how to look after your teeth. Reminding you to brush
three times a day. Reminding you to floss. Reminding you of how to
stay away from the dentist. They should just spell it out: "Look, the
better care you take of your teeth, the less often you'll have to
come back to this place, okay? Got it? Now scram. And take this free
toothbrush with you."

And as you wait, in the appropriately titled "Waiting Room", you see
the toughest of characters, entering the surgery, only to come out
half an hour later with blood on their jackets and a bandage holding
their lower jaw onto the rest of their skull. Okay, there were no
screams, but probably they've had it soundproofed. These guys are
*not* messing around when it comes to keeping your teeth clean.

It's finally your turn. You put down the magazine with the article
about Michael and Lisa-Marie's sex life. You try to look brave... and
go in.

There's the dentist, and the nurse. With the rubber gloves, all the
equipment, and the kind of cheerful expression that only medical
professionals who get paid *HOLY SHIT!* dollars an hour can have.

The chair itself is nicely re-upholstered, with plenty of padding to
make it comfortable. Of course, you just know that beneath all that
cushioning is something that belongs in a bad horror film torture
scene. Or perhaps that last bit in "Brazil". The arm clamps have been
taken off, but it's still basically the same chair. It probably dates
back to medieval times. A flash of lightning, and you're taken back
for a moment. "Tell me where the prince is, Sir Edward, or I fear
that you will be taken to the chair and have all your teeth removed!"

You sit down. A switch is pressed, and the chair begins to descend. A
bit like in an aeroplane, though generally in an aeroplane they just
bend over you to offer you alcohol and food; they don't stuff odd
pieces of metal down your throat.

The view from the chair is intimidating, to say the least. The bright
light in your eyes, the shadowy, masked figures leaning over you with
their sharp implements of dental destruction, reflecting the light.
And you, helpless, lying there, with your mouth gaping wide open, as
if surprised by your surroundings. I wonder how many people have
nightmares about being in this position at the dentist.

When it comes to dental care, most of us just have to put up with the
cleaning, and the fillings. With possibly an X-ray thrown in for good
measure. Spread over a few weeks, of course, to prolong the terror.

It's the cleaning that I hate. Yes, I know that when (and if) I
survive the ordeal, my teeth will be shinier than the sun at midday
in the heat of the desert. I know they'll be cleaner than they've
ever been (until I eat). I know that for the first time in six months
you'll be able to see the gap between each tooth (which, like the
gaps between my toes, is largely unchartered territory).

But it's still gruelling, isn't it. No matter how many advantages and
benefits there are to cleaning. It still ***grates*** as they scrape
away. And it goes on longer than an Energizer battery. Sometimes I
feel like I just want to hold my hand up and say "stop! Enough! You
know, I really don't mind plaque. Heck, it's just this side of being
a living being capable of independent thought, doesn't plaque have a
right to existence too? Nah, who cares if I lose a few teeth... I've
got too many anyway! If I cut down, the toothpaste will last so much
longer!"

The X-ray is usually a bit of a worry. The fact that they clear out
of the room while they do it... uhh... I dunno. Maybe it was my
imagination, but I could have sworn I had a kind of fluorescent tinge
after the last X-ray. And going home I'm still not sure what that dog
was barking at. And that old lady looked very scared.

So the X-rays come back, and presto, it's filling time. I don't mind
fillings too much. Just try and ignore the injection, and hope
they're putting it in the right place. And hope that they've
forgotten about seeing that scene in Mr Bean where he goes to the
dentist. As the numbness starts to set in, you can look forward to
making demented grins at the people on the way home for a laugh.

If the Novocaine does its work, you won't feel a thing during the
drilling. I must see if I can get a dentists' drill, I reckon it'd be
just the thing for making very small holes in things. They wedge your
mouth open, stuff in the actual filling (similar to what goes in a
duvet, I presume), and it's all done. Easy.

What is that stuff you rinse your mouth out in after treatment? Some
kind of colourful substance. Perhaps they need to switch it to
something like Coke, to encourage people to come again. "Only this
dentist give you a choice of Coke, Sprite or a chocolate milkshake to
rinse your mouth in afterwards! Diet varieties available!"

                      TOXIC HISTORY OF THE WORLD
              Part 24 Of More Than I Thought There'd Be

1164 AD
  Henry II tries a little antidisestablishmentarianism, and tries to
  bring the English clergy into the power of the royal courts. He has
  a little tiff with Thomas a Becket, his chancellor and Archbishop
  of Canterbury, who flees to France.

1170
  Becket returns, but the quarrel breaks out afresh, and he is
  murdered in Canterbury Cathedral. Henry claims he is deeply
  shocked, that it was probably killer rats that got him, and that he
  wasn't smirking at the funeral, honest, he was trying to fight back
  tears.

1174
  Saladin is proclaimed caliph; and launches a holy war of all
  Muslims against Christians. Why? Something to do, I suppose.

1187
  Saladin recaptures Jerusalem. The Jerusalem tourist vendors once
  again are delighted, having invested in "Welcome, invaders of
  Jerusalem" banners, which are strung across the city.

1189
  Spurred on by the brilliant success of the previous Crusades (yeah,
  right...), Philip Augustus of France and Richard I decide to start
  up a Third Crusade. It fails to retake Jerusalem, and instead the
  Third Crusade Steering Committee Quorum, decides that The Siege of
  Acre would be a good idea.

1191
  Crusaders capture Acre. What, one acre? That's not very much.

1192
  Richard concludes armistice with Saladin.
  Ummm.. by this they mean that the representatives of thousands of
  holy warriors, who truly believe that God is on their side... who
  would willingly destroy the unbelievers... these two great beliefs
  who have vowed that theirs is the one true faith... called a truce?
  "Sorry Saladin mate, just a little misunderstanding"? "All right
  Richie dude, why don't youse and us go on down the pub"? "Okay
  lads, no more fighting now, we've agreed to disagree"??!?

Well, once again, Christmas is coming up. And once again you need to
review your strategy for buying presents. After much research at the
North Pole University, Faculty of Christmas Studies, we have come up
with this authoritative list. Simply find the entry that most fits
the person you're trying to give to, and read across to find what you
should give. Please note that Toxic Custard will not be held liable
for any injury or death, insult or cutting-off from inheritance that
may occur as a result of taking this chart seriously.

C  = Card especially chosen for that person
Cg = Card (generic but nice) from bulk pack
Cc = Card (generic and extremely cheap from bulk pack in $2 Shop)
G  = Gift especially chosen for that person
Gg = Gift (generic) eg tea-towel, packet of jellybabies etc. Can be
       given instead of G, where you have no idea what will be liked
Lh = Letter of hate from "Santa Claus"
M  = Mailbomb. But don't put that on the Customs declaration
P  = Phone-call on Christmas day if you're not seeing them
Z  = Zilch. Zippo. Nothing. Not a thing
*  = Remember, friends or colleagues you give gifts and cards to must
       be on "card swapping" or "gift swapping" terms with you.

If you're taking careful note, you'd have noticed that relatives seem
to do quite well in this game. In fact, they virtually have to have
made accusations about sexual liaisons with barnyard animals to be
refused at least a card.

When buying gifts, remember to take into account the careful balances
of how much you want to spend, postage (where applicable), and the
old "is it about the same value as I got from them last year"
algorithms can be rather tricky. If you can't be bothered wrapping up
the present yourself, some shops will do it for you. Be careful
though: One shop where I asked about it turned out not to have
gift-wrapping, but GIT-wrapping. Very embarrassing.

                      TOXIC HISTORY OF THE WORLD
              Part 25 Quite A Large Number, Actually

1202 AD
  Fourth Crusade; collect the set. Constantinople captured, but
  released on bail pending a court appearance.

1206
  Mogul empire founded in India. Well, why not?

1215
  King John is forced at Runnymede to accept Magna Carta, which lays
  it down that no freeman may be imprisoned or punished except by the
  law of the land. John was actually planning instead to sign Magna
  Psychopath, which gave the King's guard total power to rob,
  pillage, plunder, and chop people into little bits whenever they
  felt like it.

1218-21
  The Fifth Crusade captures Damietta, in Egypt, but loses it again.
  Very careless. They should have tried the lost property office.

1228-29
  Sixth Crusade recovers Jerusalem by negotiation. So, there were
  some things they could do in the 13th century that can't be done
  now, eh? And blimey, these Crusade things certainly came at regular
  intervals. Actually, it's a little known fact that between the
  tenth and thirteenth centuries, there were more Crusades than
  number 251 buses.

1250
  Another Crusade is proposed, but in the 31 years since the previous
  one, no-one can remember what number they're up to. Despite
  suggestions to call it the Seventh Or Eighth Crusade, or even the
  Next Crusade, it's called off.

1264
  Henry III, whose misrule has caused the barons to revolt, is taken
  prisoner at Lewes by Simon de Montfort. Henry III is not too
  pleased about this, which is quite understandable in the
  circumstances.

1265
  De Montfort summons first Parliament in which towns are
  represented; but is defeated and killed at Evesham. But of a bummer
  that. Well, at least for de Montfort.

BAD SNIPPETS

Reknowned 60s band Traffic have reformed, releasing a new self-titled
album. "Traffic" includes such thought provoking hits as "Keep left
unless overtaking", "Large vehicles advised to seek alternative
routes", "The South-Eastern's A Bitch This Morning", "Don't Turn
Right At Camberwell Junction (Unless You're A Tram)", and a
cover-version of "Stop!"

I wonder if pictures have thoughts. I wonder if they worry about
corruption in the police. I wonder if they silently protest that
they've been framed.

TOXIC CUSTARD CHRISTMAS ETIQUETTE GUIDE - PART 2

Well, here we go in part 2 of our hastily put together Christmas
Etiquette Guide. Once again this information is provided by the
experts from North Pole University, Faculty of Christmas Studies.

Our experts have come up with the Guide To Convincing The Kids That
Santa Exists. It's a simple guide to answering all the probing
questions that kids usually ask when they think you've been telling
them a load of porkies.

Q. How come we never see Father Christmas/Santa Claus?
A. Santa is always secretive and very quiet because he doesn't want
to wake you when he's crawling down the chimney. He has signed an
exclusivity deal, and restricts his public appearances strictly to
shopping centres and staff barbecues.

Q. We haven't got a chimney at our house. How will Santa get in?
A. His sleigh is equipped with a very high-tech teleportation system,
with built-in Christmas Tree Recognition and Good Child Who Eats
His/Her Vegetables detection. It can teleport him into houses that
don't have chimneys.

Q. Doesn't Santa get very hot in that suit when he gets to Australia?
A. The suit is air-conditioned.

Q. How can Santa possibly deliver toys to everyone on the planet in
one night?
A. Well, by using turbo-charged reindeer and making good use of
timezones, he *just* manages it, but he's very tired by the time he
gets home to the North Pole. The elves always give him a nice massage
when he gets back.

Q. Won't our burglar alarm go off when a big fat man squeezes his way
down our chimney into our house?
A. Santa has a special burglar alarm neutraliser, to avoid getting
himself arrested and shot by the police.

Q. Wait a minute, this all seems far too unlikely to me. A big fat
man in a red furry costume, who flies around on a sleigh pulled by a
bunch of reindeer, delivering toys to everyone... I don't believe it!
A. Oh sod it, welcome to reality, kid.

                      TOXIC HISTORY OF THE WORLD
              Part 26 of Quite A Large Number, Actually

1273 AD
  Rudolf of Hapsburg, founder of the dynasty that is to reign in
  Austria until 1918, is elected Holy Roman Emperor. After that he
  sort of vanishes into obscurity, at least in this wildly estimated
  and very summarised history.

1280
  Kublai Khan emperor of China; encourages trade and teaches
  religious tolerance. Just another example of the barbarianism rife
  during the 13th century. Marco Polo visits, and is allowed to take
  back the recipe for all the pasta dishes.

1282
  Edward I completes conquest of Wales. The final battle involves
  three thousand brave English soldiers mercilessly defeating several
  hundred sheep. Edward celebrates with a pot roast.

1291
  Acre, last Christian stronghold in Syria, is lost. Gee, I wonder
  what perspective this particular history that I'm copying from is
  written? "Last Christian stronghold lost". Depends on how you look
  at it, doesn't it. I guess from the other side they'd be saying
  something like "Those wimpy Christians give up their last
  stronghold."

1295
  Edward I summons Model Parliament, but then decides to summon a
  real one instead when he realises the risk of the Model Parliament
  getting squashed under someone's foot.

1296
  Edward decides to attempt to annex Scotland. The Scots decide to
  laugh themselves silly at this prospect.

1297
  Sir William Wallace defeats Edward at Stirling. In fact, Edward's
  forces are pounded into the ground, an act later to be remembered
  during creation of the new English currency, Pounds Stirling.

1298
  Edward defeats Wallace at Falkirk. After two years, the Scots
  finally stop laughing.

1301
  Edward makes his son Prince of Wales, and charges him to roam
  throughout the kingdom, painting watercolours and criticising
  architecture.

1304
  Wallace captured and executed, but Robert Bruce raises another
  revolt against Edward. He demands the Scotland retain it's freedom,
  it's rolling blue hills, and that the English make their own damn
  alcohol.

1306
  Robert Bruce crowned king of Scotland. He proclaims that he is
  king, that the English are vanquished from Scotland, and that he's
  wearing nothing underneath his kilt, despite the bitterly cold
  weather.

THE DEFECTIVE HOUSEHOLD

I'm at war with my vacuum-cleaner
Because it really sucks
The head keeps coming off in mid-clean
And scattering all the muck

I'm fed up with my oven
The way it burns the load
It fries it to a crisp and then
It suddenly explodes

I've had it to here with the front door
Squeaking, giving us a fright
It sounds like a mad axeman will enter
And kill us all at dead of night

So I phoned up the repairman,
He came and he assessed
He prodded, poked, examined and stuff
And then said: "They're possessed"

So I said thanks, and called the Exorcist
She came round, rejecting the sciences
But when she saw what it was we had
She said "Sorry, don't do appliances"

I went to the library, asked for the occult
And I borrowed some books, determined to learn
What had to be done, ah yes get the stake
Fire ban or not, these things would burn

But burn they would not, the flames wouldn't catch
Think, be calm, don't panic, get a grip
The solution, Council hard rubbish collection
Friday morning, left on the nature strip

LEAVING

Yep, I've changed jobs. My last day at Telecom was on Friday. And of
course it was full of all the sort of stuff that happens at a job on
the last day. The last supper (well, okay, the last lunch) where
everyone turns up to stuff their faces. (Except the Melways-
disadvantaged, who somehow managed to misread perfectly clear
directions and head for the entirely *wrong* end of Bourke Street).

And let's not forget the big card. And the way I kept accidentally
stumbling upon people trying to secretively sign it. Guys, if you're
reading, don't worry -- after two years of watching other people
leaving, I know the office routine pretty well now. But none of the
comments in the card said "Good Riddance." Well, only one, and I
don't think he meant it. And I'm quite sure that he was joking about
dancing on my grave. Next week.

Nothing is going to make leaving after two years easy. Not the
excitement of a new job, not the anticipation of what kind of tie
I'll be given as a going away present. And certainly not the
laborious task of clearing out all my email onto disk. And as for the
amount of crap that had accumulated on my desk... But I did it. And I
showed I meant it. I showed I was leaving. And they all knew it.
Everyone knew I was really leaving when I made that final gesture of
departure. The one that means, more than anything, that you're
leaving, and not coming back: Packing the Far Side desk calendar.

And so, tomorrow (I'm writing this on Sunday), I trot off to my new
job. A new commute to master, new role to get into, and new people to
meet. New phone numbers to remember. New building security to try and
circumvent. New Coke machines to plunder. New LAN people to
frustrate.

But one thing irritates me. All this weekend, I haven't had a chance
to genuinely answer someone who asks about what I do for a living. To
say "well, I'm between jobs at the moment..."

The fly. Useful though it is, it can be very embarrassing when
forgotten. Just why is it that selective amnesia can so often cause
one to forget to do up one's fly? This is a question that has vexed
scientists ever since it was invented. There's meant to be a routine
that we all do as we walk out the door. You know the one. The mental
checklist: "Keys?... wallet?... handkerchief?... watch?..." and of
course the one that every few of weeks falls off the mental check-
list: "fly done up?"

So I've come up with an alternative strategy. If the fly beats the
Primary Zipper Status Check, a secondary check is carried out in a
quiet street on the way to the station. God forbid if anyone
regularly looks out of their window at about that time of morning.
Every day they'd see a reasonably neatly dressed young man on his way
to work, who appears to have an unhealthy obsession with the upper
section of his trousers...

But any of that is better than last week's effort, when I was beaten
by the Secondary Zipper Status Check, and got all the way into work,
and sat through a Christmas breakfast and a meeting before I noticed
the rogue zip at half-mast.

Things could be worse. About a week ago, I was walking through one of
the city's busiest streets, Elizabeth Street... and there, in a
parked car, was a man doing one of the most elaborate nose-pickings I
have ever laid eyes on. This wasn't just the casual "pick, yep,
nothing there, just checking there was nothing hanging out..." No.
This was a fully-fledged seek-out and destroy mission, obviously done
in the hope that absolutely anything in there would be scooped out.
The sort of probing that picks up individual snot molecules. For
anyone else contemplating it: Don't. Don't pick your nose in the car.
Why? Because the windows are SEE-THROUGH, that's why. (That's why
they're windows, in fact...)

                      TOXIC HISTORY OF THE WORLD
                           Part 27 of Heaps

1309 AD
  Papacy falls into French control. The residence of the Popes is
  moved to Avignon in an effort to escape the debt-collectors who are
  trying to collect 700 years of rent.

1314
  Edward II defeated at Bannockburn by Robert Bruce. Edward wisely
  decides that he didn't *really* want Bannockburn and the rest of
  Scotland anyway. It had nothing to do with the defeat of his army,
  of course. It just that, well, Scotland is a pretty dark and cold
  place, and perhaps better left to the Scots...

1328
  Robert Bruce recognised by England as king of Scotland. Not a bad
  response, fourteen years after being defeated by him.

1337
  Outbreak of 'Hundred Years' War' between England and France. It is
  caused by a conflict of commercial interests, and Edward III's
  claim to the French throne. Oh sure. The King of England decides
  "sod the French monarchy, I reckon I should be King of France!" No
  wonder he was known as Edward The Arrogant Bastard.

1340-7
  Various English defeats over the French at Sluys, Crecy and Calais.
  Edward crows to all about how great he is, and continues to do so
  until he sees the Black Death coming over the horizon, whereupon he
  cowers and hides somewhere for a little while.

1348-9
  Black Death, the bubonic plague, reaches England, killing nearly
  one half of the population, and causing acute shortage of labour
  and social unrest. Hmm. Bit of a bummer, really.

1356
  Edward, the Black Prince defeats the French at Poitiers. He says
  later he was stirred into battle by what they said about his pet
  terrapin.

1369
  French renew the war; they reconquer province after province. The
  English try to retreat, and wish they had a high-speed train that
  would carry them back across the Channel. Of course, the full name
  of the Channel is the English Channel, except in French-speaking
  countries where it's known as the French Chanel.

1372
  The English fleet is destroyed at Pearl Harbour. England loses all
  her French possessions except Bordeaux, Calais, a large box of
  croissants and half a dozen snails.

Have a Merry Christmas, a Happy New Year, and I hope no-one
gives you any beige socks, stripy tank-tops or small wooden
fertility ornaments. (Unless you like that kind of stuff, of
course.)
