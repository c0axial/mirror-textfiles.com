The end of the world is nigh.
So why bother doing a really
good title for
                               TOXIC  CUSTARD
                               WORKSHOP FILES
                             APOCALYPSE EDITION
                       Episode 6 - 5th September 1990
                         Written by Mr.Luxury-Yacht


A man.  An ordinary human being.  Ewen G.MacPerson.  He had become tired of
this world. He had become fed up with the  wars  of  the Earth, the endless
pollution  and  famine,  and  tired  of the way everyone talked when he was
trying to (especially those one or two up the back).
    A plan formed in his mind.  A  plan to get back at this world which had
made him so unhappy. A plan to destroy  the  world! How long would it take,
he thought, to annilhilate the planet? Five seconds? Ten? A  minute  at the
most, and Earth would be laid waste.
    Ewen went down to the local Brashs. There, he bought the second biggest
hi-fi  that anyone had ever seen. The new Sony CDXLOUD-40000, consisting of
a remote-control  CD  player  with 16 times oversampling, a 20 million watt
amplifier with surround-sound, and two  hundred  500  metre  high three-way
loudspeakers. And all for the cost of a small city.
    Perhaps the plan would not have been so lethal,  if  not for the final,
and most deadly element of this destructive weapon. And yet it  cost only a
fraction  of  cost of the nuclear warheads aimed by the trigger happy thugs
who wanted to  rule  the  world (Mr Tex Fuller, Flatback Missouri USA being
the most obvious one). It was,  perhaps,  a  billionth  of  the  US defence
budget of a year. It cost only $25 but the damage it would do to the planet
was  immeasurable.   It's  creator was a menace to the entire population of
the world. The thing  had a simple name. A name which caused fear and panic
throughout  the civilised world. It  was  called  "The  Young  Talent  Time
Album".
    Ewen had  bought it while completely drunk one midsummer morning. There
was an imported  American  version  as  well (which contained only half the
songs, all edited and shuffled out of  order), but Ewen had settled for the
all-Australian version, made in Korea.
    He  waited for the moment. Until the time  was  right  to  destroy  the
planet. He had arranged the speakers in 198 major population centres of the
world, and  Melbourne,  disguised  as  skyscrapers,  with  two  in New York
because he hated the NBC Today Show, which came from there.
    The  complication  came  in  the  operation  of the amplifier.  He  had
calculated that to operate it for the required time (at least ten seconds),
would cost him fifty million dollars in  electricity  bills. But of course,
the SEC would be destroyed as well.
    The time was nearly right.  Any moment now,  Ewen would insert the disc
into the CD player and press play. Then turn the amplifier up to maximum.

			 *          *         *

    HE HAD SENSED TROUBLE. IT WAS HIS JOB. FOR ONE THING, IDENTICAL
SKYSCRAPERS HAD BEEN APPEARING OVERNIGHT IN ALL THE MAJOR CITIES OF THE
WORLD, ALL WITH ADVERTISING FOR SONY ON THE TOP. BUT THE WIERD THING WAS,
THEY WERE ALL LINKED BY CABLES WHICH WERE MARKED 'MUSICWAY AUDIO'. HE
FOLLOWED THE CABLES AROUND THE WORLD, UNTIL FINALLY, AFTER WEEKS OF
SEARCHING HE FOUND A HOUSE. AN ORDINARY, CONVENTIONAL HOUSE WITH
BARBED-WIRE, MACHINE-GUN POSTS AND SEARCH LIGHTS AROUND THE PERIMETER. COME
TO THINK OF IT, IT LOOKED MORE LIKE A PRIMARY SCHOOL THAN A HOUSE.
    ANYWAY, HE WATCHED THE HOUSE,  UNTIL  FINALLY THE OCCUPANT MADE A MOVE.
WITH THE AID OF INFRA-RED CAMERA EQUIPMENT AND A HYPERSENSITIVE MICROPHONE,
HE  SAW  THE  FIGURE  OF A MAN  REACH  FOR  A  CD,  AND  SCREAM  'Die,  you
puss-suckers!'
    HE MADE HIS MOVE. HE BURST THROUGH THE DOOR, SPRINTED DOWN THE HALL TO
THE ROOM, AND ENTERED FASTER THAN PEOPLE RUNNING FOR COVER AT A KYLIE
MINOGUE CONCERT, AND PULLED OUT THE AMPLIFIER POWER PLUG.

***And the masses did hail the saviour of the world. And the saviour did
come among the crowd and did reveal himself. And it was MISTER POPSICLE.

IN OUR LAST THRILLING EPISODE, MR POPSICLE, SECRET AGENT, HAD JUST
SAVED THE WORLD FROM A YOUNG TALENT TIME ALBUM.

Mr  Popsicle,  the  ice-cold  secret  agent, who looked not completely unlike a
giant icecream, crossed the road and  entered  his  apartment. He went straight
into the kitchen and climbed into the fridge. But  as  he  did  so, part of his
left  elbow  melted  off,  and dripped all over the floor, short-circuiting the
fridge, and killing him.

LOOK, YOU CAN'T KEEP KILLING THE LEADING FIGURE IN THIS SAGA. IF YOU KEEP GOING
THROUGH HEROES AT THIS RATE,  THE END OF THE STORY WILL BE ABOUT TWENTY SECONDS
AWAY.

- I'll kill who I like matey; I'm writing this!

BUT THAT'S TWO LEADING CHARACTERS IN TWO EPISODES!

- All right. I take that back.

Just as Mr Popsicle was about to die, the arch-angel Gabriel appeared and saved
him  from  certain liquidity (sounds like  a  rescue  bid).  Mr  Popsicle  said
"Thanks", and went over to his computer terminal. He logged into VX24, read the
latest episode of  'The Toxic Custard Workshop Files' and laughed hysterically.
Then he reported to  headquarters; the offices of the Australian Royal Security
Establishment.
    "Secret agent Popsicle reporting for duty, sir!"
    "Good to see you Popsicle. We have another mission for you."
    "Thank you sir. It's nice  to  be  here, it really is. And I mean that most
sincerely, I really do."
    "Good. Here's the file on your latest mission. You'll  need  to  carry some
special equipment that's just been developed in the lab. Go and see Doc Wedge."
    "Yes sir."
    Popsicle took the lift down to floor -26, and met Doc Wedge in the lab.
    "Hiya doc, howya doin'?"
    "Fine zank you, Popsicle. And how are you?"
    "All right thanks doc."
    "Oh good. The weather is quite nice today, isn't it?"
    "Yes it is doc. It really is. And I mean that most sincerely, I really do."
    "Yes. Although I heard there could be showers tonight. Round at my place."
    "Shall we get on with the plot doc?"
    "Vell,  it's  funny  you  should  mention that, because I just spoke to the
author by phone, and he said  he's run out of story. He can't think of anything
for  you  to  do  that's  dramatic, action-packed,  dynamic  and  cliche-ridden
enough."
    "Oh dear. Well, should I tell the joke about my stick?"
    "No, no, I think someone is about to burst unexpectedly into the room."
    Suddenly, someone burst unexpectedly into the room.
    "Nobody move. My name is Inspector  Unnecessary-Violence.  I've been in the
force twenty-seven years. Twenty-seven f'kin years."
    "Good morning Inspector", replied Mr Popsicle.
    "Quiet you scum! Oh sorry. Hello sir."
    "Well Inspector, the reason we need your help  is that we've heard that the
Soviet Police And Z-force Organisation (SPAZO) is planning an operation here."
    "But", said Doctor Wedge. "Surely an old cliched spy  story like that won't
sell now that Glasnost has taken over."
    "Yes, but the author is too narrow minded and  rabidly  right-wing  to  see
that."
    "Oh."
    "Never  mind",  said  Popsicle,  "We'll  just  carry  on with our espionage
activities. Now. To raise money here in Australia, SPAZO have become engaged in
illegal  banana  smuggling. They've been hiding bananas in  innocent  tourists'
suitcases, disguised as  packets  of  cocaine. One poor customs offical found a
packet, and tried to smoke it.  As a result, he overdosed on banana, and turned
into a COT lecturer."
    "That's terrible", Unnecessary-Violence replied.
    "Yes. He had to go into Federal  politics  to  make a living. And as we all
know - POLITICS IS NOT LIKE LIVING."
    "That's awful. Are we  resorting  to  political  comment  this early in the
plot?"
    "Yes, I'm afraid so. Now, doctor, what amazing, innovative, and yet plainly
below-the-belt device have you got for us to use?"
    Doctor Wedge reached for a gizmo on the bench.
    "Here  you are - it is ze Banana-detector device. It vill find any build-up
of bananas  within  ten  kilometres. Read the figures from ze meter, radio them
back to base, and ve vill tell you where the bananas are."
    "Thanks doc. Let's go, Inspector."

  WILL POPSICLE AND THE INSPECTOR BE ABLE TO HALT THE
    ILLEGAL BANANA SMUGGLING INTO THE COUNTRY?
      HOW MANY MORE STUPID ACRONYMS WILL THE AUTHOR THINK UP?
        WILL THERE BE A PROPER CLIMAX AT THE END OF WEDNESDAY'S EPISODE?

PLEASE NOTE:
   In  the  interests  of our environment, the Toxic Custard Workshop Files are
entirely recycled, made from re-used jokes, found in an old garbage bin outside
the residence of the writers of "Hey Dad." Hence, laughter, which causes untold
damage to the ozone layer, will be prevented.

AND NOW, BACK TO THE STORY. MR POPSICLE, THE WORLD'S MOST ICE-CREAM-LIKE SECRET
AGENT, ASSISTED BY INSPECTOR  UNNECESSARY-VIOLENCE,  ARE  OUT  TO  STOP  BANANA
SMUGGLING  BY  THE SOVIET POLICE AND Z-FORCE ORGANISATION. WE JOIN POPSICLE AND
THE INSPECTOR IN  THE  ICE-MOBILE, MR POPSICLE'S SPECIALLY BUILT CAR, CUNNINGLY
DISGUISED AS AN ICE-CREAM TRUCK.  THEY  HAVE  DETECTED A STASH OF BANANAS, WITH
THEIR BANANA-DETECTOR DEVICE.
    While the Inspector drove the truck, Popsicle was on the radio to base.
    "Roger   barbecue   tea-kettle   one-o-five   Hawaii-five-o.  Received  and
understood. Roger and out."
    "Who's Roger?" asked base.
    "Shut up and keep up the jargon", replied Popsicle sharply.
    "Oh. Alpha Roger Sierra Elephant Sierra out!"
    "All right Inspector", said Popsicle, "north, to Modem Avenue. Those Godamn
Red-Bolshie-Commo-Ruskies  are  there.  They've  got  a  banana  packing store,
disguised as an electricity generator for a nearby stereo."
    As the van screamed into Modem Avenue, Popsicle  could  make  out  a  large
warehouse  at the far end, with a large sign proclaiming: 'Generator Building -
Absolutely Not  An  Illegal Banana Packing Store Run By The Godamn Red-Bolshie-
Commo-Ruskies.'
    "Better watch out", said Popsicle, "I think a stunt sequence is coming up."
    The van screeched to  a  halt  opposite  the  closed warehouse door. With a
movement of the foot that would put Mrs Thatcher  trampling  on  a  peasant  to
shame, the Inspector pressed down on the  accelerator.  The van screamed up the
driveway, and went crashing through the door, splinters flying.  The  Inspector
burst out of the cabin of the van, brandishing a gun, and screaming.
    "Police!  Nobody  move!  Reach for the sky! Get your hands up! One move and
you're dead meat! Drop  your  weapons  and surrender! You haven't got a chance!
Don't move dirtbag! Go ahead, make my  day!  Throw  your  guns on the floor and
keep  your hands where I can see them! Why am I  shouting  all  these  mindless
cliches?! If anybody makes a false move, he gets a hole in the head!" His voice
now wavering,  as he saw that everyone had their hands up, he continued slowly.
"This is your  last  f'kin  warning. I'm Inspector Unnecessary-Violence, and if
any of you f'kin scum move, I won't hesitate to open fire."
    "Thank you Inspector", said Popsicle, climbing  out of the upturned van. He
looked around the warehouse. Turning to one  of  the  Russians,  he asked, "You
call this an electricity generator?"
    Bursting  into  song,  the  Russian  replied.  "People  try to get us down,
talking 'bout my generator!"
    "WHO on Earth? Shut up! Now, who's your boss?"
    "I will tell you nothing", answered the Russian, in a heavy French accent.
    "Oh yeah? You'll tell me NOW, or I'll put you in a small room, underground,
where no-one can hear you, and subject you  constantly with the most terrifying
torture known to man. You won't last two days."
    "You don't mean??" shrieked the Russian.
    "Yes - Kylie Minogue records!!" said Popsicle, with two exclamation marks.
    "His name is... is..." The Russian looked around for a few seconds, waiting
for someone to shoot at him unexpectedly, just before  giving  away  the  vital
information.
    "He is known as Walrus-Face, but his real name is... is..."
    Suddenly,  a  shot  rang  out,  and the Russian came crashing to the floor,
faster than share-prices on Black Tuesday, Dark Monday, Charcoal Wednesday, and
whatever other stupid names were thought up for share-market crashes.
    Popsicle looked at the direction the  shot  had  come  from,  only to see a
shadowed figure running away, along a distant catwalk, high above the warehouse
floor.
    "Shit,  not  again,"  remarked  Popsicle, before his stunt-man proceeded to
scale the ladders hot in  pursuit,  in  a display of acrobatics comparable to a
nun falling off some monkey-bars. A shot rang  out, as the shadowy figure fired
at him, but because the hero can't die, Popsicle's  stunt-man  narrowly  dodged
it.  The man ran off into the darkness, and there was a scream of car tyres, as
he fled the scene in a Volvo.
    Popsicle radioed in the details of the car, and returned to the Inspector.
    "Did you get a good look at him?" asked the Inspector.
    "Only his clothing. He was wearing brown flared cords, a bright-red skivvy,
and platform shoes."
    "But that means..."
    "Yes!" said Popsicle. "He must be a university lecturer!"
  WILL POPSICLE AND INSPECTOR U-V BE ABLE TO FIND 'WALRUS FACE?'
    WILL THE PAIN AND MISERY OF BANANA-ADDICTION GO UN-STOPPED IN
      OUR COMMUNITY?
        YOU MIGHT EVEN FOUND OUT, IN THE NEXT THRILLING EPISODE OF
          'THE TOXIC CUSTARD WORKSHOP FILES', OUT ON 17TH SEPTEMBER.

Volume One, Number Nine - Seventeenth of September

Well, we hope that you were at peace with your inner self over the weekend, and
are ready once more to delve into the inner-meaning of the world of art.
    Among other features this week, we will be looking at-:
    - "Bag", the latest highly abstract work by contraversial new artist
Vincent Dan-Coff
    - A critical look at an acclaimed episodic work of electronic fiction
    - And we will be previewing a new display at the National Gallery

    Firstly, our feature artist Vincent Dan-Coff, and his new work "Bag". While
some philistines of the popular press may see this work simply as a plain paper
bag perched on top of a concrete block painted white, more discerning viewers
of the work would see it as a comment of society itself.
    The artistic relevance shown in the functional positivism counterpoints the
whole structure of the creationist existence of the piece. A special feature of
the piece is the surroundings - an almost unique and excellent example of the
Creationist Realism & Artistic Purposefulness school of art.
    The factors involved in the complex structure of the bag itself show the
inner infrastructure, moralabulations and thinkamullary artisticularity of the
artist's very inner soul. It might be said that for many artistic
displayariums, the medium for the dissemination of the thoughtfulltivity of the
artist is irrelevant. But for this piece, as most viewers will no doubt detect
with great simplification, the very structure of the blank cuboid platform
beneath could be seen as representing the world, or indeed, the universe as a
whole. It rejects the normal Zionist-Cubism of the Schizo-Hiatus-Inter-
Totallitarianism of much art in the civilistic displayational artistic region
of the financi-oriented world.

And now we move on to a much lighter note: the electronic farce-fiction of "The
Toxic Custard Workshop Files". This week sees the publication of the ninth
episode in this series. And here it is-:

AND NOW THE THRILLING NINTH EPISODE 'THE TOXIC CUSTARD WORKSHOP FILES'
Brilliant   secret   agent   Mr   Popsicle,   and   fascist  lunatic  Inspector
Unnecessary-Violence  are  on the track of a ruthless banana smuggler, known as
'Walrus-Face'. After an  initial  confrontation  with him and some of his gang,
Walrus-Face escaped in a Volvo. Popsicle radioed in the details of the car, and
rejoined   Unnecessary-Violence.  Having  concluded  that  Walrus-Face   is   a
university lecturer, because of the appalling  clothing he is wearing, Popsicle
and the Inspector returned to headquarters, where we join them.
    "Well, we know he's a lecturer", said Popsicle, "but where?"
    "Vell," replied Doc Wedge, the brilliant scientist  with  a  new accent who
was helping them on the case, "if he had only  been  wearing the red skivvy and
platform shoes, ve would not have known. But, since he was wearing brown flared
cords, ve must conclude that he is in ze field of computer technology."
    "That still means dozens of suspects in Melbourne alone", said Popsicle.
    "Yes. But where did you get with that license-plate number?"
    "Well,  there's  a  problem  there sir," answered the inspector. "There's a
strike at police administation, which  affects  the  police  computer.  All the
regular staff are on strike. So... the management have taken over!"
    "Oh no", said Popsicle.
    "So vot?", asked the Doctor.
    "Well," replied the inspector. "Because they are all management staff, they
haven't  done  any  actual  physical  work, but have just been  sitting  around
discussing ways of providing the needs  of  the  administation  wing. The first
week of the strike was setting up an agenda for  a  full  management meeting of
the  department.  In  the  second  week, they were arguing about where everyone
should sit in the conference room. By the third week, they had solved that, but
were stuck over the colour of  the paper to be used for the minutes, which took
another three days to solve. The height  of  the swivel chairs took the rest of
the week, then the actual meeting began."
    "So what was the result of the meeting?" asked Popsicle.
    "Not much. They set up two committees to report.  One to identify the needs
of  the  administration  section, and it's relationship with other departments,
and another to find a way of getting a decent coffee-machine in the board-room.
Apparently they don't know,  for  instance,  that  to find a car owner from the
license plate number, you just have to sit down at the police computer and type
the number in; not set up a joint  steering  committee into discussing Maslow's
theory of needs."
    "My goodness me! How did they get like this?" asked the Doctor.
    "They all did ADM130 'Introduction to Management' at Monash."
    "Oh."
    "We  have  to get the driver's details", said the Inspector,  "to  try  and
catch  those  Godamn-Red-Bolshie-Commo-Ruskie banana smugglers. So how  are  we
going to do it?"
    "Could we try and use the computer ourselves?" suggested Popsicle.
    "No way," replied the Inspector. "You  know  what  management are like. And
now  it's worse - they look after security as  well.  They  won't  let  you  in
without the required forms SR4, SR7463 and SR472A in triplicate."
    "Hmmm.. There could be a way," said Popsicle. "Why don't we..."

    WHAT IS THIS MARVELLOUS, INNOVATIVE AND IMAGINARY PLAN
      THAT MR POPSICLE HAS PLANNED. WILL THE PLAN HE HAS PLANNED
        WORK TO PLAN? OR WILL THE PLAN FAIL, REQUIRING HIM TO PLAN A
          WHOLE NEW PLAN? FIND OUT THE PLAN IN THE NEXT EPISODE, WHICH
            IS PLANNED FOR PUBLICATION ON 19TH SEPTEMBER.

            Premieres Wednesday 19th September, at the NetCinema

Popsicle  and Inspector Unnecessary-Violence were on the way to the site of the
police computer.  They  had  a  plan to break in to trace the license number of
that Goddamn Red Bolshie Commo Ruskie  banana-smuggler.  As they drove into the
street,  they passed a sign proclaiming 'WARNING -  THIS  AREA  PRONE  TO  SICK
MUSICAL JOKES. DRIVE CAREFULLY.'.
    The inspector  stopped the car outside the administration building and went
to the door  [See  footnote 1]. Popsicle got out, and according to plan, walked
round to the back of the building, looking for an open window.
    The front door opened, and  a  boring  face attached to a boring management
type person looked out.
    "Good  Morning,  Good  Morning",  sung the inspector, handing him a roll of
toilet paper. "Here's my application for access to the computer."
    "Thank you", said the man. "I'll get it processed, duplicated and filed."
    Popsicle had by this point got in through a window, and was tapping merrily
away at  the  terminal. He found the information on the car of that Goddamn Red
Bolshie Commo Ruskie banana-smuggler,  got  a printout, and walked to the front
door.  When he got there, all  the  management  run  security  men  were  still
puzzling of  the  toilet  roll  that  the  inspector  had  given  them. As they
feverishly worked, they burst into song; "We Can Work It Out!"
    Suddenly one of them saw Popsicle coming down the hall. "How  did  you  get
in?" he asked.
    Bursting into song, the inspector replied, "He Came In Through The Bathroom
Window", before they dashed back to the car. A message came on the radio.
    "HQ to Popsicle. We've had a message that the author is getting really sick
of  your  character, so hurry up and get the villain, then get out of the story
pronto. Out."
    With a screech  of smoke, and a puff of tyres, Popsicle sped the car to the
address on the printout.  There they found the mastermind behind the S.P.A.Z.O.
banana-smuggling. They confronted him, speaking quietly, calmly and coolly, and
with several large guns stuck in his face. He surrendered.
    "Are you the one known as Walrus-Face?", asked Popsicle.
    "I Am The Walrus", sang back the dagily dressed Russian.
    "And you're Russian, are you? When were you last Back In The USSR?"
    "Been away so long I hardly know the place!"
