Due to the current economic climate, it has become necessary for Toxic        A
Custard Megaproductions Ltd to perform an overview of its performance.
To remain profitable, all facets of TCWF operations will need to be           g
rationalised. We must emphasise that this will in no way affect the           r
humorous service provided to the general reading public. Careful              e
examination has revealed that the signature file plays a largely              a
useless role, and that the plug for back-issues could be revamped to          t
make it leaner, to not use up so many lines. In fact, a trial period of
a merged plug and signature will take place for the next two weeks. The       m
weekly TCWF heading could be economised, with a line saving of at least       a
40%, and the blank lines between items will need to be looked at very         n
carefully to see if they are of benefit.
                                                                              o

GULF NEWS                                                                     e
    Following the Allied plan to impose a new restriction on Iraqi
air-force operations, Iraqi aircraft are now limited to flying between        s
the 32nd and 36th parallels, leaving them only four degrees to fly in.        a
This is to stop them giving the Kurds and Shi-ites the third degree.          i
    An even newer draft plan, drafted and planned by Generals                 d
Eagleburger and Fries at the Pentagon, would further limit Iraqi air          ,
operations. The generals conceived this completely brilliant plan
whilst standing at the newly opened Pentagon urinal, the Pentagonal.          "
Under the plan, in addition to having to stay south of the 36th               L
parallel, and north of the 32nd parallel, the Iraqi scumsucking fly-die       i
bastards would also have to fly only between the 44th and 45th (east)         f
parallels on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, and between the 43rd and        e
44th (east) parallels on Tuesdays, Thursdays and weekends. Also, south
of the 33rd parallel would be out of bounds on all days with Rs in            i
them. Only pilots with beards may fly on Wednesdays and Fridays. And          s
all planes must be painted with big targets on each side, and have
"Shoot me!" stickers on the back.                                             a
    "This", says General Eagleburger, "will annoy the shit outta that
God'damned Saddam no end, which after all is the major objective. We          b
want to make him real angry, so he's off his guard on the toilet and          u
then our lavatorial explosives experts can... oh, err, I'm not meant to       n
talk about that."                                                             c
    General Fries would only add that he thought that whoever named the       h
capital of Kuwait as Kuwait City could have been more original.
                                                                              o

THE DENTURES OF POPSICLE: THE CASE OF THE SPOCKLED BOND  Part Three           t
                                                                              h
    Popsicle, having almost recovered in hospital from the last               i
episode, was back on the streets, which was good for the honest               n
citizens, and bad for all the nasty people out there.                         g
    Inspector Unnecessary-Violence was also out on the streets, which         s
was pretty bad for everyone. He was pretty angry, but then, he almost
always was. He was just an angry sort of person. He had been known to         t
strangle automatic teller machines when they had told him he couldn't         h
withdraw an amount such as $47.32. It's pretty hard to strangle an ATM,       a
but the Inspector had been *that* angry, that he'd managed it. But            t
today he was angrier. Not at quite his angriest, but nevertheless quite
angry. Angry enough, in fact, that you wouldn't want to so much as            l
consider thinking about looking in his direction. Not that that was a         e
problem for the average citizen walking along the street, who, though         a
they were as honest as Mother Teresa, would still avert their eyes            d
whenever a police car drove past. Anyway, the Inspector was quite
especially angry today because... umm... Oh well, he didn't need a            t
reason. He was just angry, that's all. That's about all I wanted to get       o
across in this paragraph, so we'll move right along with the plot, such
that there is.                                                                o
    Popsicle was determined to discover which dastardly bastard had           t
been behind his predicament in the previous episode. So he and the            h
Inspector went to see an old informer of his, who, he thought, would          e
coincidentally be able to provide all the vital information after only        r
a few threats of violence. Not only would this speed up everything, but
the author would be able to get to the good bit with the villain              t
without going through the rigmarole of finding clues and forensic stuff       h
and all that crap. After all, what makes a good detective story? Is it        i
the careful consideration of all the tiniest clues by some smart-arse         n
in a deerstalker? No, it's action. It's car chases and gun fights and         g
threatening informers, isn't it. Yes, it is.                                  s
    Popsicle's informant was none other than Joe Sleazebag, a down and        .
out former flared trousered backing singer with some non-entity 70's          "
singer who probably still rated quite highly on the "Middle-Aged
Crimplene Brigade Easy Listening Hottest Guy Survey" listings. Joe was        W
down and out, and consequently lived in a non-furnished basement              h
apartment unit that didn't have a roof, or to put it another way, a           a
hole. Joe was tough, in the way that a piece of putrid rotting                t
lamb-cutlet that's been sitting in the bottom of the barbecue since the
last pool party four months ago is tough. He was tough, smelly, and had       w
loads of insects crawling all over him.                                       o
    But that didn't stop Inspector Unnecessary-Violence grabbing Joe by       r
what was left of his collars and shaking him up and down so much that         d
his used condom collection fell out and scattered all over his old            s
newspaper. The Inspector spoke: "Okay scum!!! Listen, prick!! Just
listen!! Don't say a word back!! Just listen! I want you to be                o
absolutely quiet and still while my mate here has a word with you. I          f
don't want a sound!! Not one little tiny syllable until we're gone,
okay!?"                                                                       t
    "Sure", Joe said, rubbing his eyes as he woke up.                         r
    "Oh!!", added the Inspector. "That doesn't really apply to any            u
information you might think of as relevant to the case we're on at the        t
moment that you want to give us, okay fuckwit?!"                              h
    "Sure", Joe repeated, glancing down to see how far off the ground
his feet were.                                                                i
    "Hello, Joe", said Popsicle. "I'm wondering if you can help me."          n
Popsicle briefly explained the situation, what had happened, and the          d
Raymondian school of thinking on individualism, only embellishing             e
slightly his own role in the proceedings to make him sound more tough         e
and world-weary.                                                              d
    Joe thought for several seconds before giving them a name. Not the        .
name he had in his mind for Inspector Unnecessary-Violence, which
involved illegal sexual practices with small animals and scuba-gear.
But the name of the villain of the piece. A man so ruthless, so evil
and generally naughty, that his identity would have to wait until the
next episode to be revealed. Bummer, eh?

Toxic Contaminated Waste Fumes


TOXIC CONTAMINATED WASTE FUMES     NUMBER 112     7TH SEPTEMBER 1992
==============================     ==========     ==================

It's all very well those environmentally friendly products having             G
pictures of dolphins on the labels, isn't it, but what about organising       r
some sort of thing for the environmentally UNfriendly stuff? Like a           e
picture of a barbed-wire fishing net with grenades attached, and the          e
caption "Warning: downright deadly to peaceloving dolphins, orphans in        n
third world countries and small beavers living in South America. Our          p
company is dedicated to making as much money as possible. We pride            e
ourselves on our remarkable record of causing the extinction of               a
fifty-three species last month. This product is guaranteed to contain a       c
minimum of six toxic chemicals, four of which actively destroy the            e
ozone layer."

THE NATURAL LAW PARTY - MANIFESTO                                             s
Man, the Labor and Liberal parties have got it wrong, you know. So we
at the Natural Law Party would like to get this country moving again          v
with the following policies:                                                  o
  * Promote good vibes and cooperation between political rivals by            w
     giving them all some really good weed.                                   e
  * Impose taxes on bad karma and heaviness.                                  d
  * Encourage big business to knock down their horrible buildings in
     the cities and build really cool and beautiful parks and streams         t
     and giant statues of the Maharishi Gomesh Ramka.                         o
  * Tax incentives for beards (and grants for underarm hair for our
     feminine sisters in the community at large).                             s
  * Promotion of animal rights, because, like, animals are just               t
     people who just aren't aware that they're really people yet. And         o
     we don't eat people, do we. We will introduce positive counselling       p
     for all animals to help them realise that they are people too.
     Besides, right, animals are the only friends we've got.                  a
  * Complete reform of hospitals. We will replace surgeons and nurses         n
     with groove healers and healthy vibe merchants. Hospitals will be        y
     painted lots of colourful colours, and be renamed as "Refuges
     For The Untogether Healthwise".                                          m
  * A change to recreation and sport, encouraging opposing teams to           o
     stop hammering each other into the ground and start getting really       r
     mellow. To embrace the ball, the goal posts, the umpires, the            e
     spectators, and each other, and instead of playing matches every
     weekend afternoon, to hold a four hour seminar rally commune of          A
     love at the sports ground.                                               u
  * Support for groovy small businesses. Like if someone wants a grant        s
     so they can open a penis tie-dying boutique that loses $3000 a           t
     day, then we'll give them the bread.                                     r
  * Our Veterans policy is one of love. We know that Veterans and those       a
     heavy RSL dudes don't love us, but we love them. We love them all,       l
     and when they decide they want to come to the party and share the        i
     weed, we'll welcome them with open doors, man.                           a
  * The armed forces to be converted over three years into a band of          n
     travelling gypsy singers.

Mr Popsicle and Inspector Unnecessary-Violence had now got the name of        c
the villain they were after, who it just so turned out was an infamous
dealer of drugs, guns, "Puff The Magic Dragon" videos and other               C
outlawed articles. His name was Reginald Completebastardprick, and he         u
was known well to the agents of the Australian Royal Security                 s
Establishment as a cunning lying scumbag worm-like deposit of pus, and        t
just the type of person they would have recruited if they could've            a
caught him.                                                                   r
    Popsicle, of course, would bring him in. Or at least, he would try.       d
Because Popsicle was brave, ruthless, and well-known for bending the          s
rules slightly in that way that so many brave and ruthless detective-
type characters are these days. Popsicle vowed, and bet with his              f
colleagues, that he would be able to bring in Completebastardprick            r
before the end of the seventh episode of the story. That's how                o
confident he was. Mind you, Popsicle was always a pretty confident            m
bloke. He was so confident that if he thought he'd left the house
without locking the door, he wouldn't go back to check because he was         r
confident enough to believe that no burglar would even dare to break          e
into his house. He was so confident of this because his house had a           a
triple-layer of electrified barbed wire, ten vicious guard dogs who           c
been on a diet of green beans for two weeks and a security system that        h
when triggered blasted Barry Manilow's greatest hits around the               i
neighbourhood at 120 decibels.                                                n
    Inspector Unnecessary-Violence, on the other hand, was angry. But         g
we went into all that in the last episode, so we'll dispense with the
needless character building and get on with the story.                        F
    Having obtained the information that Reginald Completebastardprick        r
was behind the vicious and nasty and horrific crime of whatever it was        a
had happened in the first episodes, Popsicle and the Inspector got down       n
to the Files room pronto to see if they could get any further                 c
information on R.C.                                                           e
    The Files clerk, Phil E. Schuffler, was a pedantic little git, and        .
everyone knew it. He was the sort of person, had he been a librarian,
would have gone around personally to your house the day after your            S
library book was due. He was not a librarian, but this didn't make            o
things any easier for the members of A.R.S.E when they wanted                 ,
information. Phil's work made the Files room a model of efficiency and
tidiness, which prevented entirely any actual crime-fighting work from        F
being done within.                                                            r
    Nevertheless, Popsicle knew that this was where the plot was headed,      e
so he went down to the Files room to get the information. Phil was            n
sweeping the floor of the rather thin layer microscopic molecules of          c
dust that had deposited there since the last time he had swept the            h
floor, about five minutes before. He looked up with a disapproving face
at Popsicle as he walked in. Files were made to be filed, believed            r
Phil. If files had meant to be taken out of their filing cabinets and         e
looked at, then they wouldn't have bothered to invent filing cabinets         a
to keep the files in. They would have just shoved all the files all           d
over the place so they could be looked at more easily.                        e
    With Phil looking on, despairing about the treatment of his               r
precious files, and vowing that there would be a payback if any hairs,        s
fingerprints or dog-ears appeared on any of them, Popsicle and the            ,
Inspector pored over the veritable Pears Cyclopedia of information
before them. They found out that Reginald Completebastardprick's              w
favourite colour was red, he was known to wear "L.A. Looters" caps, and       a
that he had a nasty tendency towards self abuse, having been witnessed        t
several times shouting names at himself into a mirror.                        c
    Having gained this spurious information, and a shitload of more           h
important information, Popsicle and the Inspector left the A.R.S.E.
building, and headed out into the world, looking for Reginald                 o
Completebastardprick, and the next episode.                                   u

First, a quick precis.   Precis.                                              h
                                                                              ,
And now, on with the story. Mr Popsicle, secret agent from the
Australian Royal Security Establishment, and Inspector Unnecessary-           I
Violence from the police Deadly Extreme Anger Tactical Hit Squad, are         '
on the tail of notorious nasty bloke Reginald Completebastardprick, and       l
are also hoping to arrest the author, who has managed to string out a         l
meaningless story with no plot to five episodes (and counting).
    Having obtained all the information about Completebastardprick (or        b
'Prick, as he was known to his colleagues), Popsicle and the Inspector        u
began to cruise the streets looking for him. Normally they would have         y
cruised the streets in their super-cool speedmobile, which looked like
a fish, and drove like a fish, and spewed more pollution into the air         t
than a whale spews water up through that little hole in the top. But          h
the fact was that the speedmobile looked rather conspicuous for an            a
undercover operation, looking, as it did, like a giant moving fish on         t
wheels with genuine scales. And besides, it was broken down, so they          ,
got their zone 1 2 and 3 travelcards and jumped on a 246 bus, keeping
their eyes peeled.                                                            s
    Popsicle was the first to spot Completebastardprick's trademark "LA       u
Looters" cap (have we done that gag to death yet?), as well as the rest       r
of him, waiting on Richmond station for a Dandenong train, and he leapt       e
for the cord to get the bus to stop. As soon as the back door opened,         ,
the good guys tumbled out of bus and sprinted up the ramp to the
station, weaving through forty-thousand schoolkids on their way to the        f
Show. They got to the top just as the train pulled out, the guard in          i
the backmost doorway grinning smugly at them, enjoying their annoyance        n
immensely.                                                                    e
    A few minutes later they jumped onto the next train going the same
way, and as they pulled into Caulfield, spotted their quarry outside at       b
a tram stop. The Inspector, by now in a major rage (as opposed to his         y
more usual minor rage) foolishly let slip "Stopyoudickheadwe'rethegood-
guysandyou'reunderarrestandwe'regoingtothumpyoutooforwhatyoudidmother-        m
fuckersocomequietly" at a level of several hundred angry decibels.            e
    'Prick heard this, and jumped into the cab of the coming tram,            ,
waving a conveniently handy gun in the driver's face and ordering him
to go full speed down the street, leaving behind half a dozen enraged         c
passengers, four of whom decided on the spot to write to their MPs            o
about it, and they would have, too, if they'd known who their MPs were.       r
    Popsicle and the Inspector waved their ID's and travelcards in a          r
bus-driver's face and ordered him to "follow that tram!", which was           e
something Popsicle had always secretly hoped he'd be able to do one           c
day. Actually he'd preferred to have said "follow that cab", but you          t
had to take an opportunity when it presented itself to you. In fact, he       ,
could have said "follow that cab", but the bus driver would probably
have followed a nearby cab which was going in what could be considered        f
the completely wrong direction. Anyway, while the driver got on with          i
that, Popsicle and the Inspector stuck their heads out of the bus             n
windows and shouted obscenities at the fast vanishing tram, and at the        e
curious onlookers who didn't usually see events this exciting and             ,
dynamic happening, and mostly presumed they were just filming a
commercial for a new brand of potato chips.                                   r
    The tram screeched around the corner, under the railway bridge and        i
into Normanby Road, in the process cutting off three Volvos (Volvoes?)        g
and a short fat man in a Mercedes, but no-one cared. The bus was slowly       h
gaining, but the faster speed was being thwarted by a steady stream of        t
passengers pulling the cord to get off at various stops along the way.        ,
As the final old lady with an afternoon's worth of shopping from the
bargain basement at Chadstone got off, Popsicle knew in his bones that        a
they'd be able to catch Completebastardprick.                                 b
    The bus drew along side the speeding tram, and Popsicle climbed           s
through the bus skylight onto the roof, leaving the Inspector to take         o
out his frustrations on someone's kid who'd been left behind. Keeping         l
low to avoid being barbecued by the tram power wires, Popsicle steadied       u
himself before taking a cliched running leap off the bus and towards          t
the swaying back end of the tram. Just as he jumped, the tram surged          e
forward, leaving Popsicle plummeting through the air, heading fast            l
towards the ground. Which, on all accounts, is nice enough to land on         y
from a height of about three feet at slow speed, but which is not so          ,
great when landing on it from six feet up at a speed approaching that
of a crowd of hippies running for the nearest bucket after accidentally       n
biting into a double beef and beef burger with extra beef. He grabbed         o
at the nothingness, arms flailing, and managed to get a hand onto the
tram's power pole. The weight of him pulled it down from the wire, and        p
the tram, deprived of its wattage of life, began to slow as Popsicle          r
slammed into the back of the tram.                                            o
                                                                              b

THE ADVENTURES OF MR POPSICLE - THE SPECTACLED BRAND  Part Six

Mr Popsicle, truly incredible and lovable and delicious secret agent of       J
the Australian Royal Security Establishment is getting quite close to         u
catching that well-known character of dubious repute and winner of the        s
1992 Fuckhead Of The Year Award, Reginald Completebastardprick.               t

Popsicle scraped himself off the back of the tram, which he had               s
spectacularly (well, as spectacularly as you can do in a written story)       o
leapt onto at the end of the last episode. He steadied himself on the
ground, which he had finally reached, though he had originally been in        y
no hurry, and reached for his trusty nun. I mean gun. Inspector               o
Unnecessary-Violence jumped out of the following bus and joined               u
Popsicle, and they stalked slowly alongside the tram towards the cab,
where Completebastardprick had been last seen.                                k
    They changed their plans quite speedily when a volley of gunshots         n
rang out from the front of the tram. To be precise, from the villain's        o
gun, which was in the vicinity of the front of the tram, in the               w
villain's hand, to be precise. If armed and dangerous trams roamed the        ,
streets trying to shoot people, the Public Transport Corporation would
be in seriously even more economic strife than they are already.              T
    Anyway, Completebastardprick fired at Popsicle and the Inspector          o
several times, which was a fairly logical thing to do in the                  x
circumstances, and well defined as equitable under his contract of            i
employment in this story as a Criminal (Third Class) under the federal        c
labour laws. Popsicle and the Inspector, as was to be expected in the
circumstances, took cover and fired back, which was also their role as        C
listed in their contracts as Hero (1st Class) and Sidekick (1st Class).       u
    The authorised Sidekick then radioed back to the Australian Royal         s
Security Establishment Headquarters of Operations, Logistics and              t
Eavesdropping for some assistance in their current predicament. ARSE          a
superdooper cars, tanks, helicopters and more tanks appeared from             r
nowhere and completely surrounded the area, thus ensuring that this           d
scene would be too expensive ever to be made for television.
    Completebastardprick was still hiding in the cab, having been left        h
alone there by the tram driver, who had recently decided to leave his         a
post for sunnier, friendlier, and more peaceful climes, and managed           s
within two minutes to find a van operated by the world-famous Monsieur
Whippy where he could get a nice ice cream with choc-nut topping and a        b
Flake bar sticking out of it at a quite alarming angle.                       o
    Popsicle's voice rang out on the ARSE public-address system which         y
had been brought along for just such an occasion. "Okay Complete-             c
bastardprick, come quietly or we'll make it *very* noisy for you!"            o
    The reply came back, shouted from Completebastardprick, who was in        t
quite a reckless mood: "No way, fuckers! You won't fuckin' take me a-         t
fucking-live! So fuck off!"                                                   e
                                                                              d
   *OH DAMN, WE'RE OUT OF SPACE AND THE STORY STILL ISN'T FINISHED.
   LOOK, I PROMISE IT WILL END NEXT WEEK, OKAY? PROMISE. ABSOLUTELY           N
   PROMISE. WITH A CHERRY ON TOP, OR WHATEVER ELSE YOU WANT.*                 e

Oh there was a man who in this song                                           l
His name was called John Smith                                                e
'Twas a boring name but 'twas not wrong
For John was the name that he was named with                                  p
                                                                              r
John Smith he had a job you see                                               o
Though thousands others didn't                                                d
While John worked earning a bob or three                                      u
All those others they all couldn't                                            c
                                                                              t
So John was a soul, a happy old soul                                          s
His week was five days long                                                   .
And as he trotted off to work each morn
He'd sing this happy song:                                                    D
                                                                              o
"Oh nothin' could be finer                                                    n

And then one day a few months on                                              s
Old John he caught some flu                                                   k
He sneezed and was surprised to find

He went to the doc and sang at him                                            y
"Doc why is my snot blue?                                                     ,
It's really quite alarming as
My piss is bright blue too".                                                  i
                                                                              f

'Twas pine or maybe teak                                                      y
He picked up a clipboard and a pen                                            o
As he began to speak                                                          u

THE ADVENTURES OF POPSICLE - THE SPECKLED TRAM  Part Seven

At the rear-end of our last not-quite-as-thrilling-as-it-could-be and         O
not-quite-as-final-as-we-wished-it-would-be episode, Inspector                h
Unnecessary-Violence and Mr Popsicle of the infamously infamous
Australian Royal Security Establishment had cornered the nasty-wasty          d
Reginald Completebastardprick in the suburbs, in the street, in a tram,       e
in a state of utter terror at the thought of being caught and brought         a
to Justice. And if Justice had had any idea of the possibility of             r
meeting Reginald Completebastardprick, she'd have been pretty terrified       ,
about it too. Which just goes to show the dangers of blind dates.
    The seige between our heroes and the armed and dangerous nasty man        t
was going pretty seigely, and as we pick up the story and throw it out        h
the window, the latter has just shouted a bunch of obscenities at our         a
heroes, to the effect that not only would anyone from a decent                t
upbringing with a reasonably well-paying job, a house in the suburbs,
3.2 kids and a parrot be mortally offended by the language used and           P
hence carked (*this is the word the dictionary choked on, any                 o
suggestions as to the spelling are welcome) it on the spot.. not only         p
to that effect, but also to the other and more interesting effect that        s
Reginald Completebastardprick was not going to give in without a fight.       i
He had battled hard to get the position as star villain in this story,        c
and wouldn't be relinquishing the position easily. It had been                l
difficult enough getting into the finalists for the position, not to          e
mention finding out all their addresses and bumping them off one by one
so that he had to get the job.                                                p
    The Inspector and Popsicle considered Completebastardprick's rather       u
negative and rebellious and villain-like response, and held a quick           n
two-person conference, debated, considered again and decided                  c
unanimously to take him out. They prepared for several minutes, placing       h
marksmen at Queen's Knight 4, Queen's Pawn 2 and Kings Rook 1, and then       l
put the order out on the radios: "Take him out." All the radios were          i
naturally tuned to COP-FM, the all-new stereo sound sensation of the          n
airwaves for all law-enforcement personnel. Yes, COP-FM, with which 24        e
hours a day, you could be guaranteed to be able to turn on the radio
and hear a track by the Police.                                               i
    The ARSE marksmen (aka the Soggies) were all highly trained, having       s
got their experience in a large number of seiges and raids, most of
them in Redfern. David Gundy, the entire cast and crew of Toxic Custard       t
#94, JFK, JR, Ronald Reagan, you name it, they'd shot it. So when the         e
order came to take Completebastardprick out, they were ready. They had        r
prepared. They had practised several times on the neighbourhood kids.         r
They moved in, armed and dangerous, on the tram in which R.C was              i
hiding. And on the count of 4 (because they couldn't count any higher),       b
they stuck all their collection of bloody dangerous looking guns in his       l
face and shouted in formation: "Hello Reg! We're the Australian Royal         e
Security Establishment marksmen, and we'd really like to get to know          .
you better! Do you fancy a cup of coffee, or a meal, after the story is
finished?"                                                                    B
    And that's how they took him out.                                         u
                                                                              t

Street-theatre. Now I can stand a little theatre now and then.                r
Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, all that. But I just don't understand this
stupid street-theatre that seems to be stalking our streets these days.       m
More feared than all the muggers and pickpockets on the planet are the        i
dreaded women in formation on monocycles holding sparklers and haddock        n
riding along the footpath. Are you really trying to tell me that half a       d
dozen men in wetsuits and Reeboks with televisions on their heads             .
dancing to new age music means something? What message are they trying
to get across to the masses? *If* they're making a statement about the        H
suffering of the homeless youth in the inner cities, why the hell don't       e
they make a banner and shout about it in front of Parliament House. At        l
least they'd get their message across.                                        l
    And what really gets me is that these people are paid for using           o
public money. I probably paid for one of those television sets, but the       ,
bloke wouldn't even let me tune into A Country Practice when I asked
him. It might be okay, but paying for these twats isn't even optional.        I
I look at my horrendously complicated tax form, and do I see an
exemption from street-theatre tax for those who think they're all a           w
bunch of arty hippy gits? No.                                                 o
    What a waste of money. The other thing that really gets up my nose,       n
down my throat and into my bowels is these university types who manage        d
to spend millions upon millions of dollars on those computer network          e
things, and then use them to send stupid poems, moronic messages,             r
opinionated opinions and other wastes of space like undergraduate
humour, stuff which isn't even funny, all over the world. I saw an            w
excerpt from one of them the other week, the "Toxic Pudding Working           h
File", or something. Crap, complete crap. Not a single worthwhile word        a
can ever have come from the nonentity that wrote it. He'd be more             t
value to the world if he had his brain surgically removed and put in a
bucket. And they wouldn't need a very big bucket, either.                     t
                                                                              h
