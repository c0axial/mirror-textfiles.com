Of course, the Dane Quayle incident has brought into perspective a major
problem of our modern society: the problem of illegiblacy. The luck of
wrotten skulls in some so called "developed" countries is quiet
appealing. But did yoo know that 93% of Federal politicians are
illegible? No, nyther did eye, befour eye red thee damning report on
educational standards what woz written by someone or other. Illegiblacy
figures do in fact vary widely amongst the different professions. TCWF
has made up these exclusive figures, which we are bringing to you, as
part of our policy of truth no matter what even if we get beaten up in a
dark alley for saying it by some heavy gangster type who doesn't like the
truth when it insults the dignity and honour of his mother's catfish:

- Politicians 93%                - Computing students 74%
- Arts students 99.4%            - Authors 95%
- Arts lecturers 99.8%           - People reading this list 93.07%
- Household pets 100%            - People who write train timetables 96%
- Police 93%                     - Radio DJs 96%

Hi there dudes, you're tuned to Dipstick FM, playing the all-old boring
combination of the best rock of the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s along with all
the shit as well. And this is Mick Dickhead with you until 5pm tonight,
when the decent DJ gets a go at the mike. Until then, stay with us on
Dipstick FM for a musical load of old crap, and even more of my inane
comments between the songs. And now on Dipstick FM, here's our tenth
Bryan Adams track in the last five hours.. this is "Everything I Sing, I

TCWF SURVEY RESULTS
There were only 16 responses to the Toxic Custard survey in TCWF#99. The
conclusion that has been reached is that 93.07% of TCWF readers can't
read. Researchers at the Custard Research Annex Presentiment laboratory
expect that further survey results will arrive in the coming week, *or
else*. So further investigation of results has been postponed.

THE VERY BRIEF AND INCOMPLETE TOXIC GUIDE TO HOLIDAYS IN REVERSE ORDER

CHRISTMAS (25 December) - celebrates Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the
exact birthdate of whom is unknown. Many celebators dress up as big fat
men with beards during this time. Scholars believe this is an attempt
at frightening the kids into going to bed early.

CUSTARD DAY (13 August) - when people all over the world show their
complete indifference to the anniversary of the first Toxic Custard in
1990 by failing to celebrate in any way whatsoever.

EASTER (somewhere around March or April or sometime whenever the monks
decided it was going to be this year. Jeez, must be a pain for people
who make diaries) - celebrates the glory of Pilutder and Yrubdac, the 
Roman Gods of chocolate and long weekends with lots of football.

SHROVE TUESDAY (ditto, I think. Actually, who knows?) - the day when 
people stuff themselves with pancakes, and get well and truly shriven.

AUSTRALIA (26th January) - a day when the patriotic members of Australian
society celebrate all that is great about Australia, and the little that
is great about Australian history, by having a barbecue, getting drunk
and getting breath-tested and arrested on the way home.

NEW YEAR'S DAY (1st January) - time to recover from New Year's Eve.

Welcome back to Dipstick FM. This is Mick Dickhead with you, and let's
take some calls. And first on the line is Geoff from Wantirna... how are
you, Geoff?

- I'm good thanks Mick. How're you?

I'm as great as a shitty DJ can be, Geoff. Now, what are you calling for?

- Well gee Mick, I guess I dunno.

Fantastic. And now let's go on to our next caller, it's Wayne from
Footscray - what a dump! Whatssup, Wayne?

- Hi Mick. I'm just calling to say you're a complete fuckwit.

That's great Wayne! Love you too. And Wayne, don't hangup, because you're
a Dipstick FM **WINNER**!! As the fiftieth person to air those sentiments
on the radio in the last five weeks, we'll be pleased to send you a
complimentary Dipstick FM full-colour stereo-vision wart remover! Whoa,
hold on to your hats, listeners.. and be a Dipstick FM **WINNER**!! Next
on the line is mum. What's your beef?

- Mick, you're dinner's ready.

Okay mum, I'll be right there.

That's about all of this week's Toxic Custard.

hear Daniel Bowen say "That's about all of
this.." (etc). Those of you who are suicidal

Ace heavy metal band and generally destructive type people Megabogue
went on trial early last week. They'd been accused of putting
subliminal messages on their albums, thinly disguised in the backwards
speech between and during tracks (See TCWF 20) which has caused the
proliferation of suicidal tendencies in their fans.

The charges of Incitement To Murder With Blood Gushing All Over The
Place were made by Mrs Mabel Redneck, who claimed that her son, Ray,          D
had hacked himself to death with the family potato peeler. It was not,        e
she said, "a pretty sight. And the fries were awfully red that night."        a
But the family did find solace in the reduced supermarket costs since         r
the suicide. "We all regularly praise God for this miracle", she added.
                                                                              o
Justice Clancy Oldfart in the Supreme Court ruled that the jury hearing       h
the case would have to hear the entire album, both forwards and
backwards, as well as back-to-front and upside-down. A spokesman for          d
MoccaSIN records gladly supplied sample tapes and albums, and commented       e
that thank Christ the trial had brought some much needed publicity to         a
the band. Ace Megabogue guitarist Harry "headbanger" Wall was quoted as       r
saying "fuck off" to anyone who so much as breathed in his direction.         ,

After some three hours of listening to Megabogue music, the jury              i
retired to a tiny little iddy-biddy room to consider the evidence. When       t
nothing was heard by the evening, a check by a courtroom official found
that they had all decapitated themselves in the jury room with a              b
concealed meat-cleaver, and the judge declared a mis-trial, as was his        e
wont.                                                                         a
                                                                              t
Mrs Redneck and her family left the court speedily and without comment,       s
bound for a church memorial service to the slowing sales of the local
vicar the Reverend Skilbey's "Sing-a-hymn-for-Him" album.                     m
                                                                              e
Megabogue Inc. declared their complete innocence, appealed for calm
amongst their fans, and asked that the public be allowed to purchase          w
as many of their records as is humanly possible. Ace drummer Slasher          h
Rists said from his wheelchair that "the fuckin' law ain't gonna              y
fuckin' nail us to the fuckin' wall for this. Why should we fuckin'
get into fuckin' trouble for this fuckin' kid fuckin' toppin' himself,        y
when there's probably fuckin' thousands more we ain't fuckin' heard           o
about yet!"                                                                   u

The band rushed out their new single, "Sing Anything To Add Nonsense"         p
to take full advantage of the publicity, and, commented ace bass              e
guitarist Bonk Mee, "to make a helluva load of money." Ace rhythm             o
guitarist Vimmy "The Thorn" Halen added that "you should buy our bloody       p
records, or else."                                                            l
                                                                              e

Here, exclusive to Toxic Custard readers, are the lyrics to the new           l
Megabogue hit (they hope), "Sing Anything To Add Nonsense".                   i

Sing anything to add nonsense
Don't matter what the words are
Sing anything to add nonsense
Can you still see the scars?

'Cos Natas is everything
Take it from us
Natas will see yer right
When you bite the dust

So what do you wait for?
It's great to be dead
Pick up that axe Eugene
And chop off your head

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
That's all for this week. And if you think writing
another Megabogue song was a good way of copping-out
by writing more lines faster, you're completely
right. So what? Your reading loss, my time gin. I
mean gain.
    Provided I don't get "discovered" in the next
seven days, Toxic Custard will be back this time next
week. Back-issues are still available for absolutely
positively probably no cost whatsoever. For details,
send email to tcwf@gnu.ai.mit.edu

Hello and welcome to the one-hundred and third Toxic Custard. And this
Toxic Custard is an attempt to enter the Guinness Book of World Records       I
- we are going to try and bring you the *fastest* Toxic Custard ever
written. It began at 9:26pm Sunday the 5th of July, Australian time,          f
and a quick check with the experts tells us that it's already into its        i
twelfth line after only three and a half minutes. At this rate, it            n
should take just under an hour to get to the TCWF regulation length           d
maximum of 124 lines. Why 124 lines? Well, it's a secret. We'll be back
with more of this amazing record breaking attempt after this bit:             i

MRS IRENE BUSYBODY SPEAKS OUT ON...                                           r
Shopping. Oh the cruel twist of fate that sees us struggling to control       e
shopping trolleys around the supermarket on Saturday afternoon. Piled         a
high with red spot superdooper mega specials for one week only which no       l
other supermarket within a ten metre radius can match.                        l
    So every week we steer the trolley down the aisles, dodging the           y
stupid little twerps who've been given the "Junior Shopper" trolleys.
What an epitaph. It's a warning. They'd freak if they knew just how           o
much of their lives and how much of their money would be spent in             d
supermarkets when they got tall enough to push the demonic anarchistic        d
vicious bastard trolleys from hell the rest of us have to put up with.
    You also have to steer around the legions of little old men in            t
dirty patched jackets who are at the "1Kg bag of carrots only 79              h
cents!" display, busily moving back and forth from the scales, weighing       a
every bag to see which one has the most carrots. They probably aren't         t
even that crazy about carrots.
    Gradually the shopping list the size of a telephone book starts to        s
look more satisfactory, as items get marked off, until you realise that       o
there's no way you can find the can of Continental Cook'n'Eat Cream of
Potato-Leek Chunky Economy-size soup that you've always wanted. They          m
probably changed the colour of the label and you don't recognise it.          a
    Finally, just when you think the ordeal is over and you think you         n
can escape, comes the CHECK-OUT. Of course, you noticed earlier during        y
your shopping that the check-outs weren't very crowded. Now it's
naturally a completely different story. The crowds around the only            p
three open check-outs resemble those old films of people outside the          e
hotels where the Beatles stayed in 1964. And the pace of the poor             o
deluded poverty stricken teenagers who are so poor they have to work          p
here is slower than the pace of a snail on a slow-motion replay of the        l
final of the North Laverton Turnip Planter's League competition of            e
1985.
    It's not that I'm sexist of course, but I try and get a girl on the       w
check-out, since the boys on check-outs have invariably been kidnapped        a
from the stores department where they don't need brains, they just need       n
to recognise an empty shelf and what the hell is meant to go on it.           t
    I won't even talk about the dreaded "priiiiice check!"
    And of course the compulsory scratch, sniff, collect, spend and win       t
competition cards. Which compel all members of the human race to shop         h
there and collect little cards which they drop behind the fridge never        e
to be seen again. I often consider behind the fridge to be the last           s
frontier eluding the grasp of man. We've explored the moon, we're             e
getting up to the planets as soon as we've built a rocket big enough,
we've mastered the bits of the sea we're not dropping barrels of waste        s
into, and the north and south poles are a doddle, but does humanity as        i
a whole really know what's behind the fridge?                                 d
                                                                              e

Yo Tezza, this is Mick. Don't spray the box in Ralton Parade, okay? I         n
use it for phoning the TAB. I forget who won the game, mate. One team         d
or the other, it usually is. See that umpire though? What a dickhead.
Just 'cos one bloke punched the other bloke in the face. So sure he           s
ended up in hospital with a concussion and a bruised brain and injuries       o
to his eye, but hell, it's part of the game, innit. You could be right        m
about the beer, I don't remember. But I do remember that thing what you       e
borrowed off me. So could you get it back to me pronto, 'cos I need to        t
use it.                                                                       h

Duh hi Mick, this is Tezza again. I don't know how come I never get to        l
speak to you, but I remember what I borrowed off you what you wanted          s
back. Yeah. It was the manual to your answering machine. Don't worry          e
about the umpy mate, me and the lads from down the road saw him after
the match in the carpark and congratulated him. We managed to get rid         t

Hi Tezza. Yeah, I need that manual back. I can't turn off my answering        t
machine. And I don't know which button to press to answer the phone
when I pick it up. I can change the message, call back, but I can't           a
turn the bloody thing off or answer. Any ideas? Call me back.                 m

The latest news is that a Qantas jumbo-jet flying over the Pacific has        o
made radio contact with a US Navy ship and threatened to drop twenty          n
hours worth of toilet waste on them unless they met the Qantas pilot's
conditions, which were:                                                       a
    * that the ship immediately change course                                 b
    * that the ship's captain sing the Mickey Mouse club theme song ten       o
        times over international distress call frequencies                    u
    * that the ship's crew dance the polka naked from the waist down          t
        while sailing into Pearl Harbor (sic)                                 ?
and * the entire US Defense (sic) department and services staff, and
the President of the United States be placed on special rations of            W
pigs' snot for the next three weeks                                           e

No decision had been made about the demands at the last report, but           l
Presidential staff were said to have been chewing it over. No comment
was made about rumours that White House chef of staff Walton                  h
Eagleburger had been seen at the local store ordering pigs' snot.             o
Although a White House sauce said that Eagleburger was also Washington        w
DC district purchaser for Kentucky Fried Chicken, which would explain
his behaviour. He also said that President Bush drew the line at              s
broccoli, but that he was quite impartial to the smell of pigs' snot in       h
the morning.                                                                  o
