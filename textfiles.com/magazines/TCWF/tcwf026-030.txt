WELCOME TO DECEMBER! In this the most dangerous of months, when Christmas
is almost upon us, be careful when travelling. For instance, while pushing
your way through the crowds to the check-out during the Christmas sales,
please take care not to squash people flat.

_______________________________________________________________________________


Welcome to the prestigious opening of this new Toxic Custard Workshop File by
HRH the Duke of Kent. He will shortly arrive by double-decker elephant, and
present a banana to the Prime Minister.
    The Prime Minister will then make a toast... oh, sorry, make SOME toast,
and add to it some butter made from east-Peruvian goats' milk. The
Governor-General will then put on his ballet frock and dance to his favourite
Metallica record. The Duke will then stand on his head while shouting "PING",
while the crowd serenades the local eels with a rendition of "I Did It My Way".
    Three dozen journalists dressed in ceremonial robes will then do a
war-dance to the great god Murdoch, while a collection of ten million green
bottles is inspected by the Prime Minister, who will cry into most of them.
    The author will then be called on to do the traditional "dish drying"
ceremony, and will cease typing this mindless drivel into the keyboard.

           of anything else. Well, this joke seems to have been
           completely spoiled; we'll return to it later.)


TELECOM AUSTRALIA PRODUCT ANNOUNCEMENT
Have you ever wondered how certain people manage to ring-up at the
most inconvenient moments? That's because they have been working on
a test project for Telecom. The result, which is now publicly available
is WRONGTIMEPHONE!
    WRONGTIMEPHONE checks to see if the person you are about to ring
is in a position to answer the call, and if so, aborts. WRONGTIMEPHONE
is especially engineered to ring up people when they are
- asleep
- just sitting down to dinner
- on the toilet
- in the shower
- doing the dishes, wearing those rubber-gloves that take 15 minutes to
wrench off
- in the garden, not quite out of earshot of the phone
- having sex
- watching the climactic bit of the latest mini-series
- just going out
- waiting for a very important (other) phone call
- desperately searching for a video-tape to record the latest video-clip
of their favourite band on the television


MEDICAL COLUMN
Recent research into peoples fears has revealed a number of new
phobias:
 - Ticketphobia - the fear of losing your train-ticket when the
       ticket-inspectors get on
 - Humorphobia - fear of not being able to keep up with all the new
       articles in rec.humor
 - Phobiaphobia - the fear of being afraid of something
 - VAXphobia - fear of Vax VMS commands
 - Toxicphobia - fear of Toxic Custard Workshop Files (they can be vicious)
 - Duckphobia - fear of ducks
 - Hibiscusphobia - fear of malvaceous tropical plants
 - Porkphobia - fear of pork - very common in Israel

They are people with a message; a message that the world should listen to. Here

                              of goldfish? That's a bloody 'E'!"  G.Faux 7/5/90

    THEN IT FELL THROUGH THE ROOF OF THAT FAMILY'S HOME.

Oh, I'm sorry.

Okay, okay, so it's late. But it's not my fault.
The absolute honest truth is that I was stuck in a ten-day-long orgy
that started at Christmas. It had nothing to do with the fact that
our computers went down unexpectedly. The only warning of this given
was on the logon message, which said
   "This system will NOT be going down over the Christmas and New Year
    break."
It still does, come to think of it. So much for System Managers; I take
back what I said in TCWF25.

And now, on with the file.

NEVER let it be said that I submit to blackmail. On the other hand,
when DEMANDS are made by certain parties in Texas...

"JULIUS CAESAR", Act 1, Scene 2
-------------------------------

[Enter Caesar, Antony, stripped for the course, Calphurnia, Portia,
Decius, Cicero, Brutus, Cassius, Casca, a Soothsayer, and after them
Marullus and Flavius with the communal gherkin, and a crowd estimated
by police to be at least ten thousand following.]

CAESAR: Calphurnia!

CASCA: Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.

CAESAR: Calphurnia, where the bloody hell are you?

CALPHURNIA: Here, my lord.

CAESAR: Stand you directly in Antonius' way,
        When he doth run his course. Antonius!

ANTONY: Caesar, my lord?

CAESAR: What did that last line mean? Tell me, I can't remember.

ANTONY: I shall remember:
        When Caesar says `do this', it is performed.

CAESAR: Get on with it then, and leave no ceremony out.

[Music, `Anarchy in the UK', by the Six Apistols]

SOOTHSAYER: Caesar man!

CAESAR: Ha! who calls?

CASCA: Shut the fuck up, all of ya!

CAESAR: Who is it in the press that calls on me?
        I'll only talk to you if your not from a Murdoch paper.
        Speak, Caesar is turned to hear.

SOOTHSAYER: Beware the ides of March.

CAESAR: What man is that?

BRUTUS: A thoothayer bidth you beware the idth of March.

CAESAR: Have you got a lisp, Brutus? Set him before me, let me see his face.

CASSIUS: Fellow, come from the throng, look upon Caesar.

CAESAR: Yo man, what's happenin' bro? Run that by me again.

SOOTHSAYER: Beware the ides of March.

CAESAR: He's drunk, let us leave him: pass.
        Anyone got a dictionary there? Right. Look up ide!

CASSIUS: Icon... icosahedron, icterus,
         ictus, I'd, id, ah! Ide - see id. Hmmm okay.
         id, ide, ns. a fish of the same family as the carp, inhabiting
         fresh water in Northern Europe.

CAESAR: "Beware the fish of the same family as the carp of March"?!?

BRUTUS: Methinkth he wath ath pithed ath a newt.

CAESAR: Well, all the same... Calphurnia! Cancel the fish-fingers tonight;
        we'll call out for a pizza. C'mon; almost time to watch "I, Claudius"
        on the telly.

MEET THE K.G.B.
Following the spread of Glasnost throughout Europe, the KGB will open
its doors next week to the public for an open day. The new "caring"
KGB wants to show you how they are no longer trying to being the onset
of the demise of Western civilisation. Call into your local KGB
hideout today to find out more details. Or drop into an American
embassy or government office, go to a wall and shout into it that you
want more information into it (remember to say your address as well).
A coded leaflet written in invisible ink will be despatched to your
home by the next post.
  During the KGB Open Day, you can see:
  - the very latest in bugging equipment, now available for commercial use
  - this winter season's umbrellas, all specially imported from Czechoslovakia
  - new developments in high-velocity bullets
  - for the kiddies - try out the torture chamber on your little sister!

GALACTIC TELEPHONE COMMISSION - INTERPLANETARY DIAL DIRECT (IDD)
----------------------------------------------------------------
To Direct Dial:   a. Dial 0029, the Intergalactic Access Code, then
                  b. the planet code, then
                  c. the country code, then
                  d. the area code, then
                  e. the telephone number.
For example, to call the Wangazoon people of Mantanjax 5 in the city of
Froz, dial    0029 - 207 - 17 - 213 - and the local telephone number.
Note that unless you speak Wangazoonian, you may need to purchase an
additional translator module.


Meanwhile, far away in the Andes, the author discovered a piece of parchment
which was found to contain none other than the telephone number he had been
looking for. With a hop, skip and an air-fare, he had arrived at a telephone
box, only to be greeted by a ten-foot-high raw carrot with a handlebar
moustache.
    The carrot (which was later found to be made of extruded poly-vinyl
and glouro-wankizade) stood motionless, as he consoled it with a rather
large cricket bat (with a brick attached to one end). And burst into song
with the next bit:


SMILEY FASHION REPORT IN BRIEF
This Summer, short is IN!
So, get rid of your daggy old :-) 's, and start stocking
up on the new, dynamic :)


SPORT REPORT
    And now a look ahead to the game of January 15th, between the
Coca-Cola Desertshield Yankees, and the Sadam Giants. The arena for
this showdown will be the Kuwaiti Football Arena, and despite the low
spectator turn-out expected, the worlds' press will be there to
report on the game.
    There are threats that the game will be cancelled; rumours persist
that team coaches may organise a deal to split the prize trophy (The
Kuwait Cup) in two. But should the game go ahead, both sides are
confident of victory. We spoke to Yankees coach George Bush from his
club-house in Washington.
    "We want that trophy, an' we sure as hell are gonna kick those boys
butts all the way back to their changin' room... And there ain't no-one
gonna stop us!" he said. He denied that there would be a repeat performance
of their last major tournament, when the Yankees lost to the Ho Chi Minh
All-Stars. "It'll only take us ten minutes to prepare, and then we'll be
ready for them."
    The Giants coach was unavailable for comment, but a spokesman said
that "if the game goes ahead, we will step on their heads. That is OUR
trophy, and we also demand that the Arafat United Football Team be
re-awarded their the medal that was taken from them by Shamir Hotspurs."
