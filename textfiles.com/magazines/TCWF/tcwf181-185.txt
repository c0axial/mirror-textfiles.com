                    TOXIC CUSTARPEDIA - VOLUME 14

NEEDLE
  An object of evil. It was devised by the evil Count Pierre
  deNeedle, one of those French bastards who wore a top hat and was
  always tying maidens to railway tracks in deserted black-and-white
  valleys, and setting off nuclear bombs on peaceful Pacific islands.
  The needle was designed for two purposes:
    - To be found in unexpected places by sitting on it, catching
      your finger on it, or having some other part of your anatomy
      punctured by it, followed by a loud hailing from the vocal
      chords, often the phrase "shit!"
    - To infuriate any person trying to sew, by waiting until you
      are just about to get the thread through the little hole, then
      concentrating all its energies and moving two millimetres to
      the right.

NEIGHBOUR
  One of those people you occasionally smile at when walking down the
  street, but rarely develop such a bond with that they are concerned
  when your burglar alarm goes off when you're on holiday.

"NEIGHBOURS"
  Australia's revenge on Britain for constant royal tours.

NEWT
  One of those really small beasties that annoys little kids because
  they're too small to step on. I dunno though - if you were flying
  along and got caught in the downward air-draught of a descending
  foot, it'd do serious damage, wouldn't it?

NIGHT
  That time of day when it isn't. Night is generally recognised by an
  overall lack of light, and the sudden manifestation of strange
  noises which feed paranoia.

NLQ (NEAR LETTER-QUALITY)
  Euphemism in the field of computer printers. When the salesman says
  "yes sir or madam, this printer here offers Near-Letter-Quality
  printing" they actually mean "what, you're too stingy to shell out
  on a laser printer? Why not just write it all out by hand? Don't
  want to invest in the pencils? You scumbag."

NOBODY, MR
  Semi-mythical person whom I was always told would come to clean my
  room. But he never did.

NOSE
  Outlet located in the middle of the face. Used for smelling,
  breathing, and the output of extraneous waste. Beats me why snot
  couldn't have exited through the arse like most of the other waste
  coming out of the body. Perhaps it was more economically viable to
  have a secondary solids outlet. Actually it's just as well that
  people don't send their other waste through the nose. Then we'd
  need flushing handkerchiefs. And farts would be much more
  noticeable.

NOTICEBOARD
  A large board placed somewhere in the office, where administrative-
  type people place important notices that no-one ever reads. Also the
  location of very bad cartoons on the subject of office life, pinned
  up by the office wag. [See wanker.] 97% of office workers ignore
  these, and instead find their entertainment in the Gary Larson
  calendar that at least one person per office has on their desk[*].
  This desk will become a focal point for meeting throughout the
  year, where from will be heard guffaws aplenty[+], except from the
  person who actually sits at that desk, who will wish that everyone
  will piss off so they can do some work.
      [*] Yes, it's me this year.
      [+] Accompanied by cries of "oh isn't he great!" and "how is he
          so imaginative!"

NOVEMBER
  Oh come on, that was months ago, it's pointless dwelling on it now.
  The word November is actually Latin. Nov means nine, indicating the
  ninth month, which is due to the guy who made up all the months
  having a bit of a problem with adding up. Ember is something to do
  with open fireplaces, which are popular in some parts of the
  Northern Hemisphere, making the name of this month hemispherist, of
  course.

NULL MODEM
  Another one of those things which sits around on your desk for
  months, but mysteriously vanishes the day before you need it.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

CUSTARD BAND-AIDS - THE BEST BAND-AIDS

To prove that Custard band-aids are the best band-aids, we took three
healthy people, and inflicted identical serious cuts in their arms.
    [*Arghh!*]
       [*Arghh!*]
          [*Arghh!*]
We left one cut untreated. The second one, we treated with another
band-aid brand. And the third we treated with new improved Custard
band-aids. Then we left them locked in a room with no food or water
for three days.
    The first person died. [*Thump*] His family are suing us.
    The second person had to have their arm amputated at the
shoulder [*Nnnnnneeeeeoooooowwwwww* *Argh!*] and is suing us.
    The third person survived without any effects whatsoever,
although he's having difficulty in writing, but that should be okay
in a couple of days. With the profits from sales from this promotion,
we paid off the other two court cases.
    Custard band-aids. The best.

                    TOXIC CUSTARPEDIA - VOLUME 15

OBJECT
  Another of those words which is very good an being fairly anonymous
  in its description of anything, and not actually meaning very much.
  Generally most useful when you want to describe something, but are
  unaware what the fuck it is.
      About as useful as "The definite article", which is not only
  stupid enough to be a definition which includes the word it's
  trying to define, but also includes the word "article", which means
  the same thing as object, yet nobody knows what it is. Which is
  pretty vague for something which is supposed to be "definite".

OBJET
  The same as "Object", but for the French and/or pretentious.

OCEAN
  A large body of water between countries, which is probably the
  biggest peace-keeper in the world, preventing more countries from
  being permanently at each others' throats.
      Readers are advised when crossing oceans to always look both
  ways, and never walk on the water unless you are Christ. (Yeah
  look, I don't want to gloat or anything, but I did recently get a
  subscription request from a jc@heaven.rel)
      Once again, I apologise to any Christians reading this. (Of
  course, if I really cared, I wouldn't have written the last
  paragraph, would I.)

OCTOPUS
  Eight-legged sea creature that I just can't bring myself to eat.
  Even when I have the advantage over it that it's dead and I'm
  alive. And hungry. And sitting in a restaurant being offered food
  to eat. (See Order)

ODD
  Odd things that you don't want people find in your house include:
     - that dead insurance salesman that you lost your rag at and
        buried under the stairs
     - the New Kids On The Block records that someone bought you as a
        joke
     - the fungus that is growing all over one side of the shower
     - all those Readers Digest metal tokens that you decided to keep
        because "they looked nice" when you opened the envelope just
        after downing forty-three consecutive stubbies
     - the (now dead) cat buried in the sofa that's been missing for
        three months, and which gives the livingroom that special
        aroma

OPERA
  For centuries now, Opera has been the foremost method of
  humiliation available to the security forces. It began in the late
  1600s, when peasant rebels were made to dress up as ridiculously
  fat people and get up on wooden planks in front of hundreds of
  their peers and shout the same things over and over and over, to a
  musical accompaniment.
      By the time the French Revolution came rolling along, it was
  the aristocrats who were forced to the stage to sing, gesticulate
  wildly and loudly perform plays devised to spread Revolutionary
  propaganda.
      Nowadays, Opera has been driven underground, but is still
  carried out by the perverse, the deviant, and those with very big
  tits (both men and women), their audiences made up almost
  exclusively of establishment figures.

ORDER
  The process of telling the waiter what you would like to eat,
  preferably a choice from that on the menu. Following the ordering
  process, you will make a note of everything that they forget to
  bring you, and finally find the courage to kick up a stink when the
  meal's over and everyone's leaving. The procedure then is for the
  restaurant to fall over themselves trying to make it up for you, by
  offering a free X (insert your forgotten choice here) even though
  you're not hungry, you're leaving now, and you didn't order X
  anyway, you ordered Y.

ORIGINAL SOFTWARE
  Something of a rarity in this universe.

OXYGEN
  A thoroughly useful substance to the vast majority of us. Without
  oxygen, we would die, and then life wouldn't be worth living. Which
  is irrelevant because we would be dead. And yet what would life be
  without life itself? A void of nothingness to be pondered by
  theologians. And yet without life there would be no theologians to
  ponder it... so I guess it wouldn't be quite so bad.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

In between watching Countdown repeats and blowing my nose, I've been
getting out and about town a bit. I managed to catch "Much Ado About
Nothing" at the Rivoli Cinema - for discerning cinema goers, or so
they say. The same film was also showing in the city, but that was
obviously the edited, non-discerning version. You could tell the
audience was discerning because apart from us there was no-one below
45. Actually, perhaps that's what discerning means. "The theatre for
people over 45, but the Drug Offensive will still put in one of their
Speed Catches Up With You ads anyway in the hope that you crumblies
will stop taking Speed when you're at dinner parties."

                    TOXIC CUSTARPEDIA - VOLUME 16

PADLOCK
  Security device which anyone can cut through if they have the
  determination (and the cutters). Either operated by key, which is
  then lost, or by combination, which is cracked by people passing
  who have nothing better to do. About as secure as Pyramid / A
  Savings And Loan / BCCI (delete according to continent).

PARADIGM
  One of those words which is perfectly clear when you look it up in
  the dictionary, but which is awfully difficult to work into
  everyday conversation, not only because it sounds complex, but
  also because of extreme paranoia about mispronouncing it.

PARENTHESES
  What people say when they mean brackets, but are trying to sound
  smart.

PATRIOT
  One who blindly loves their country, no matter what terrible things
  it might be getting up to while they aren't looking. "Oh yeah, well
  I know they might have been experimenting on peasants in
  neighbouring countries, but Christ, isn't this a great country!!"

PAY
  Compensation for having to go to work and put up with all the
  cretins in your office.

PENECTOMY
  I'm pretty sure in thinking that when they first heard of the
  Lorena Bobbit trial, most men squirmed a fair bit. This is
  instinctive. I also discovered on Friday what happens if you happen
  to be playing in an office indoor soccer game and someone, later to
  be known as "ballcrusher", accidentally aims a soccer ball in your
  direction, which manages to hit what, we shall say, are the most
  delicate parts of a man's body.
      The human body does not mess about in this situation. Every
  nerve is screaming at the brain "Christ, that hit me in the balls!"
  The message goes express to Brain Central, which initiates
  emergency gasping procedures, and puts into action the disaster
  foetal position. And as the other men around you squirm in
  sympathy, the brain goes into recovery "act cool" mode, and begins
  to think of jokes involving high-pitched voices and doubts about
  the possibilities of offspring.

PISS
  The are so many and varied uses for the word piss that I have
  decided to compile a list, as follows:
    on the piss              drinking alcohol
    piss artist              one who messes around (esp when drunk)
    pissed                   intoxicated
    pissed (US)              annoyed
    pissed off               annoyed
    piss elegant             pretentiously elegant
    pissing away             wasting (esp money)
    pissing down             raining heavily
    piss-up                  party (esp involving alcohol)
    to piss                  to urinate
    to piss off              to go away
    to piss about            to mess around
    to piss-fart around      to mess around
  I've almost certainly missed something, but I think you get the
  general idea. Now, I want you all to write a sentence which gets
  all of those meanings into less than 25 words.

POETRY - "The Nastiness Of Your Flea-Ridden Scalp"
  I think that I shall never see,
  Anything as small as a flea,
  It hops and hops and bites and bites,
  And gets into your hair and shites,
  And no matter how you swat,
  You'll never get it; that's your lot,
  And though the flea is not shaped like a dome,
  That's about the end of this poem.

POLYCRATES (c536-522 BC)
  Lots of boxes. Invented container lorries.

POND
  Small body of water, which, with the right light, a few ducks, and
  overhanging trees, you can just about think looks nice and restful,
  before a bunch of screaming kids run past, throw a rock in the
  water, and spoil the whole atmosphere.

POST OFFICE
  A vast system of little vans, sorting rooms and people on bicycles.
  Together they ensure that if you need to get something sent from A
  to B in a hurry, three weeks after you've mailed it at A, it still
  hasn't turned up at B. It's either languishing in a big sack at C,
  or has by some complete mystery been detoured via D, which is
  generally on a different continent to both A and B.

PUBLIC ADDRESS
  Why is it that the most vitally important PA announcements - the
  ones you actually want to hear the contents of - are drowned out by
  the noise of the crowd?

PUNS
  The following puns have no homes to go to-:
    Chefs have a license to grill.
    Carpenters have a license to drill.
    Man's liver takes a turn for the wurst!
    Breakfast eater has fatal bran tumour!

                    TOXIC CUSTARPEDIA - VOLUME 17

Q
  The letter with the least number of amusing words in the alphabet.
  (So far). Generally found just before the letter U, entries for
  which will appear in several weeks.

QUANTUM SUFFICIT
  The type of phrase that makes you wonder if this language would be
  any better off if there was someone in charge who had power of veto
  over the introduction of new words.

QUEEN
  Not much of a career to get into if you can help it. Tends to
  involve flying all over the place being famous. But you don't get
  to make lots of movies. It must get a bit dull after a while
  actually. Everywhere the Queen goes all she gets to do is open
  things, do walkabouts, go to the races...
      But the really scarey thing about the Queen is that she has
  kids. This means that at sometime she and the Duke of Edinburgh...
  must have... you know... *done it*. Eugghghgghh. That's pretty
  frightening. And think of the possible embarrassment. What if a
  servant or a bodyguard walked in. "Oops, sorry your Maj.. hey, how
  did you two get into that position? Should I pick these robes up
  for you... oh, I should just go? Okay then.. yes, I'll just go.
  Just please try not to get any marks on the red carpet. Yes, I'm
  averting my eyes.. Oh. Beheaded? Thank you very much your Majesty."

QUEUE
  Something that supermarket supervisors obviously have no idea how
  to manage. It's tempting when you're waiting to grab a PA
  microphone and shout "Yes, shoppers, don't leave yet, 'cos we've
  got mega bargains now! All breakfast cereal, meat and dairy produce
  bought in the next fifteen minutes is 90% off! Stock up now!" Wait
  thirty seconds and all the queues will have disappeared.
      I sometimes get quite infuriated in supermarkets. Keep me off
  the roads - people are in enough trouble when they get in the way
  of my trolley. Some of them leave their shopping trolleys in the
  middle of the aisle. Next time that happens I'm gonna move it for
  them and then watch as they try to work out where they left it.
      I dream that one day they'll turn the whole supermarket into
  one big one-way system. "Hey, too bad if you don't want dog food
  because you haven't got a dog... too bad! You gotta go via the dog
  food anyway! What'dya mean you forgot the eggs... too late now!
  You'll just have to go around again! See you in hell, shopper! You
  there! Trying to climb over the frozen food section to get back to
  the shampoo! Get down here now! Reg - get the shotgun! ... <BANG>
  ... Your attention shoppers, due to an... incident in the frozen
  food section, all shoppers will be detoured via hygiene products.
  We apologise for any inconvenience. Do not attempt to enter the
  frozen food section. Thank you for shopping at Dangerousway."

QUIBBLE
  Recreational sport. Quibbling began as a pastime for bored
  consumers. Since then it has spread, and we can soon expect to see
  Olympic Quibbling.
      "Here come's Anderson, Quibbling for Australia... yes, he's
  asking about the discount price... oh, and the special bonus offer.
  That shop assistant's on the run now... and I think he's getting
  ready to deal his most devastating final blow... yes, he's noticed
  the scratch in the upper corner. But oh no! He's just mentioned how
  they used to make them in the old days! Anderson has just
  bullshitted! Sensational news! Anderson, out of the Quibbling Final
  on a bullshit. Tragedy for the young athlete..."

QWERTY
  Type of keyboard designed to slow the typist down and confuse
  people who are learning to type.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Sometimes I wonder what I'm really doing on this planet. Do you? Do
you get up in the morning and think... hell, will I really make a
difference to the world by living? Will the rest of the human race
even know that I exist? And then I look at the figures of history...
like Hitler. Did he wake up one morning and think "I have to do
something with my life... why don't I try genocide"? Was Hitler
planning for the future... perhaps to try and set up a family
business. "A. Hitler and Sons - Dictators and Genocidal Services to
the General Public".

RAFFLE
  A way to get you to spend $2 in the mistaken belief that you have a
  newt's chance in a grinder of winning a hamper/car/holiday. There's
  something just not quite right about the principle of making money
  for charities which involves giving away expensive prizes. There's
  probably a loop-hole in the raffle laws that allows the raffle
  organisers *not* to give away prizes if the proceeds are to
  charity.
      Most proceeds actually go to rebuilding churches, upgrading
  kindergartens, etc. The more dubious ones go to sending brass bands
  to Queensland, building athletics clubs, and of course the newly
  created Custard Development Fund. The Custard Development Fund is
  dedicated to sending the author of Toxic Custard on a Hawaiian
  holiday.

RAIN
  Another one of those things that is great to watch when you're not
  caught in it. Perhaps what we need to do is somehow make
  intelligent clouds that rain, but not actually *on* people.

READERS DIGEST
  Ever wondered how effective those mailing campaigns are? Toxic
  Custard has obtained this internal Readers Digest report.
  Summary of mailing campaign:
    43,000 sent competition letter
    15,000 stupid enough to send back entry form
    15,000 sent secondary draw letter with offer of Readers Digest
             sample and exclusive small brass token
    3,000  request Readers Digest sample
    3,000  sent Readers Digest sample with subscription offer
    9      subscribe

REAP
  Formerly used in descriptions of agriculture, "reap" is now almost
  exclusively found in bad retail advertising campaigns, eg "We've
  cut prices so you reap the benefits!" shouted by manic announcers
  over footage of crazed shoppers smashing in doors.

RECEIPT
  Proof of the purchase of goods. There are two distinct types of
  receipt:
    - the receipt that sits in your wallet for the best part of a
      year before you clean it out, and then pops up again regularly
      for the rest of your life, in desk drawers, stuck in books as
      bookmarks, or attached to the fridge with a magnet
    - the receipt that you think you put safely somewhere, but can't
      find when the goods that you bought falls apart/breaks down/
      causes you to want to return the goods, for whatever reason.
      (See Return)

REFERENCE
  The academic way of copying what someone else has written. The best
  references don't actually exist. Which means they can say precisely
  what you want them to say.

RENOVATION, IDEAL FOR
  See Demolition, Condemned, Wreck, Pile of bricks.

REPEATS
  *Sigh*. Last week I finished watching the Countdown repeats. What a
  nostalgia trip. Back to the late-70s. Bit of a nightmare, actually.
  The memories came flooding back. I think that now I am ready to
  atone for my sins. Yes, it's true. I once had brown cords. I'm not
  proud. It's just something I did in the foolish years of my youth.
  One of many things, actually. On the other hand, when it comes to
  embarrassing fads of the Seventies, I do have several points on my
  side. To my knowledge, I never wore flares. I didn't like Kiss. Or
  Abba. Sometimes I think I was pretty smart, considering I was just
  a kid.

REPRODUCE
  The sort of thing that Jeremy Beadle should be banned from. The
  Beadles actually have a history of practical jokes, right back to
  the days of Christ, when Jeremiah Beadle convinced Joseph that the
  only accomodation left in town was a stable.

RETURN
  An experience of sheer terror. Here's some advice for when you want
  to return goods to their place of purchase.
  - Find the receipt. Okay, so you only bought your product X
      yesterday, the shop you bought it from probably only sells an X
      once in a blue moon and the shopkeeper in question has known
      you personally for a period of decades. But severe paranoia
      about the shop's denial of any knowledge of product X means you
      must have the receipt with you when you stroll in the door to
      have any confidence or strength when you begin with the words
      "I bought this yesterday..." (See Receipt).
  - Find the bag that your product X came in, which naturally has the
      shop's logo plastered all over it. Failing this, you should try
      and find another bag, from a different time you went to that
      particular shop. No, it doesn't really make sense, just don't
      worry about it.
  - When you get to the shop, radiate confidence. For some reason,
      whenever I'm in this situation I get pangs of guilt going
      through my mind... "You don't really need to return it! It
      works okay if you hold it at a 30 degree angle! Don't be so
      petty! It only singed a bit of the carpet! Only the garden shed
      burnt down! It didn't fry the whole family! You've got a nerve,
      daring to declare the manufacturers to have failed in their
      goal of trying to bring you the perfect product X! They'll
      probably shed jobs over this! And you'll be personally
      responsible for the decline of dozens of families, and the
      eventual joint suicide of the workers at the ruined site of the
      bankrupt factory."
  - If you're going to even think about mentioning refunds, take
      along proof of identity, a shotgun, several lawyers, and all of
      the above.

RHETORICAL
  Well if you didn't want an answer, why did you bother asking a
  question? It's that kind of behaviour that leads to extreme
  irritation and eventual violence involving a jack-hammer, three
  bananas in various orifices and strangulation with a vacuum
  cleaner hose.

ROLLERBLADING
  By far the most fashionable way to injure yourself at the moment.
