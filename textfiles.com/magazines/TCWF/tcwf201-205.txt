    There's a new innovative design in alarm clocks on the market.
The Custardmatic 4000 alarm clock. Not only does it have numbers so
big and bright that it makes it difficult to get to sleep in the
first place, but it also has four modes of alarm, that successively
get louder and more vocal, to make sure you get out of bed.
    1. The normal beep we all know and love from our current
       conventional alarm clocks.
    2. A few minutes later, the louder beep.
    3. Next, the first of the voice circuits gets into gear, angrily
       demanding that you "Get up! Get up!"
    4. The ultimate in waking machines. A rubberised mallet on an arm
       extends itself from the clock and starts whacking you on the
       head, while the voice synthesiser shouts "Get up! Get up and
       get out and earn a living, you lazy git!"
The alarm clock is sensor linked to your bed, so it *knows* when
you've actually got up. The snooze button is not available on alarm
4, and an optional recording unit is available to allow you to record
your mother telling you to wake up.
    The Custardmatic 4000. Available now.

DANIEL'S GUIDE TO HOUSE HUNTING
    First you need to find a house you like. Then keep dreaming, 'cos
you'll never be able to afford it. Go to see the bank. Don't plead
for mercy. If you plea for mercy, they won't take pity on you,
they'll just completely rule you out of a loan. Because anyone who
looks pathetic is a bad risk. They'll only lend money to people who
don't need it. So take this tip. Go to the bank with a convincing
argument. Preferably at least a 12 gauge.
    Check out the house carefully. Hire someone to check all the
structural bits and make sure it's not going to implode or sink into
that river next to it, the one that makes it look so picturesque.
Make sure you get it in writing that the house is okay. Then, if it
isn't, you can sue, and with the payout, buy a better house.
    Next, you have to keep the price of your prospective house down.
The trick is the inspection days. You have to go to every possible
inspection. Not to actually look inside the house, but to walk up and
down outside with your mates, all dressed as skinheads, shouting
"fuckin' hell" a lot. That should scare off the bulk of the other
potential buyers. Then the next time, you turn up all in wheelchairs,
waving your arms uncontrollably, and screeching "house! House!" That
should get rid of the remaining buyers.
    And meanwhile, the real estate agent and the house owner will be
standing there amazed, saying to themselves "I never saw those people
around here before..." It also helps if you know people at the
newspaper who can "lose" the ad.
    Get all your friends to be there on auction day, too. The same
friends that have grafitied all over the front fence and wall the
night before the auction. Just to ensure there's no last minute
buyers.

Not only are shampoo manufacturers using more and more ridiculous
shaped bottles, but it's got so bad (ie stylish) that you can't
balance most of them upside-down when they start running out. Some of
the packages are so slick, dynamic that they look like prop buildings
from futuristic car ads. It's not just shampoo anymore, either - it's
a hair revitalisation experience.
    And that's why we introduced the Custard Care range of shampoos
and conditioners. They help to keep your hair bouncy... beautiful...
and lumpy. Available for normal, normal and normal hair types,
Custard Care shampoos and conditioners are available now wherever
crap products are sold.

The thing about being left-handed is that scissors hate you. Almost
all scissors, which look at first glance like placid, inanimate
objects, sense that they are being lifted by someone's left hand and
entirely cease to work. And when us lefties manage to find a pair of
scissors that DOES work, anyone else who picks them up has the nerve
to claim they don't work!
    Well now you can throw those scissors out the window (and hope
they land in the head of whoever designed them). Because New Custard
Scissors will cut through anything. Paper, iron rods, skin, bone,
plastic... they'll cut straight through anything you so much as bring
into the same room as your Custard Scissors.
    Custard Scissors have been available to torturers in all leading
fascist dictatorships for many years, but now they're available to
the public at a very reasonable price! How much would you expect to
pay for these glorious scissors that if dropped will cut their way
through your foot?
    Don't ask -- you also get a complete set of thumbscrews. This
genuine ex-KGB stock is just what you need for that annoying little
sister. And each thumbscrew comes in its original condition, many
with the thumbs still in them! An offer like this can't last, so call
now.

We've all been in the situation. That itch in the very centre of your
back, that you just can't quite reach? (At least, not without having
your arms surgically stretched). Well itch no more! We now introduce

    Just call 1800-SCRATCH and a special team of well-manicured
scratching experts will be despatched to your door, driving at
alarming speeds to reach you within a guaranteed time of 8
minutes(*). Hell, you can't even get an ambulance that fast these
days. Our expert scratchers will care for your every itch,
methodically scratching to your every direction (eg "up a bit! No,
down just a tad. Left a little bit. Oh yes, it's there.... oh
yeaaaaahhhhh.....")

(*) Offer available only in Metropolitan areas within 8 minutes of a
Custard Scratching Services depot. Customer pays traffic fines.

It makes you think. If doctors' writing is so bad that the chemist
has to check your name and address from the prescription... what are
the chances that the medicine you're given will be wrong? "Oh, you
needed Elzinphatom, not Elbonphateem. Sorry. Elbonphateem is for the
treatment of gangrenous piles, actually. Not bronchitis."

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

This is a plea to any of my relatives who may be reading. (Actually,
not many of my relatives do read this drivel, meaning that my
standing in the family as a "fine upstanding young man with a
promising career etc etc" has not yet been completely shattered. Give
it time.)
    Don't give me any more novels to read. The backlog is getting
embarrassing. They pile up in the bookshelf... Okay, I admit it, I'm
not a great reader. I've never been a great reader. In school, it may
have looked like I was reading "1984", but to tell the truth, I never
got past the first sentence. The one about clocks. "Animal Farm" --
no problem. Appealed to my love of small furry animals, probably. (I
still deny any accusations of cruelty to these particular creatures.
There is no substantial evidence.)
    It's not that I can't read. I've read for many years. It's just
that I have a belief in only reading things that can keep me
interested. If a book doesn't have one even mildly interesting
thing on each page, then chances are I won't be bothered. It's not
like music, which you can just turn on and listen to without too much
bother. You can leave it going in the background. Books are *effort*.
    Maybe I just don't have enough patience. I just can't be bothered
to read through 250 pages of narrative to discover that the butler
did it. Maybe I'm too much a part of the TV generation. Maybe the
whole plot has to be given to me on a 19 inch black-tinted plate with
stereo sound. And commercial breaks every five pages.

So, what did I do on my weekend? Well, here's a clue

    It's great to chainsaw a chihuahua
    And to inflict pain on a poodle
    To make cuts into a kelpie
    To draw things on your doodle

    I just love cutting my arms off
    And flushing them down the bog
    Then stomping round the garden
    In big boots, squashing frogs

    Head butting semi-trailers
    Run/walking in one shoe
    And pushing dog owners' noses
    Into their own dogs' poo

    These are all things I take part in
    But the silliest of all the things I do
    Of all the ways I spend the weekend
    Is writing this Custard stuff for you

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Have you walked into a darkened room just as the florescent light is
coming on? Looks like some sort of bad horror movie, as the light
flashes on and off.
    Actually, once I was lying in bed listening to a thunderstorm. As
the lightning flashed, I made out a big darkened silhouette in the
corner. Argrghh! Holy shit! Intruder alert! Get the cricket bat! Who
was it?! Oh yeah, the hatstand with the old hat on top and the
overcoat hanging off it...
    And once you've calmed down a bit, you're in that limbo
situation, not quite asleep, not quite awake. And your body decides
to trip over something imaginary. And for a split second, you think
you're falling over, and you wake up completely...
    Actually, I seem to have great problems getting to sleep. I
fidget. I toss and turn. And when I eventually fall asleep, I'm in
such a position that most of me aches the next morning. Why can't the
brain keep an eye on things while I'm tossing and turning, and
proclaim "No, don't go to sleep like that, your back will hurt like
buggery in the morning".
    Now that really is a strange expression. "It'll hurt like
buggery." I wonder if whoever made it up was speaking from personal
experience, or just playing guessing games. Perhaps he got up one
day, found himself aching... and thought "I'm going to make up a new
expression for pain. Now, what can 'it' hurt like? KFC? 'It hurts
like Kentucky Fried Chicken'? Nah, doesn't really work... Chopping
off a finger? 'It hurts like chopping off a finger'? Hmmm.. not bad,
but it doesn't quite capture the essence of this particular pain. How
about buggery? 'Hurts like buggery'? Could be, I'm not sure. But I'd
better find out... Better whip out the Yellow Pages... Quick find
index... Cars... Cats.... ah! Churches - Catholic! Here we go..."

THING         PART 8
====================

             (Ron is on the couch. Jeff is on the phone)

JEFF:   Yes, yes, I'll hold.

                             (Jeff waits)

JEFF:   Hello? Yes, I'm told I need to get a form 14 F. What? Yes,
        I'll hold.

RON:    Government departments...

JEFF:   Hello? Yes, I'm trying to get a form 14 F. What? But I just
        spoke to them, they transferred me to you.

                     (Jeff hangs up in disgust.)

RON:    Huh... bloody government department bureaucracy.

JEFF:   Who said anything about government, I was just trying to
        order a pizza. I knew it was a mistake to phone this one. (He
        holds up a leaflet.) Huh. Red Tape Pizza.

                      TOXIC HISTORY OF THE WORLD
                          Part 1 of A Bunch

1800-1700 BC
  The first use in Egypt of papyrus. Before long, Egyptians on their
  way to work would be reading the morning papyrus on the camel
  train. In 1748 BC the first Scroll Three girls were introduced by
  papyrus baron Rupmur Doch. Yes, that is a very very bad try at an
  ancient Egyptian name.

1400 BC
  Moses finally gets sick of Egypt and walks out, taking all his
  mates with him. He gets into an argument with some dam builders
  along the way and wins a monumental bet from them. He also
  ghost-writes the world's first ten point etiquette guide.

1300-1200 BC
  The Hittites, controlling Mesopotamia, discover the wonders of
  smelting iron, and open iron smelting shops up and down the
  country. In them, tough and/or sinewy men stand around very hot
  furnaces cracking dirty jokes, and pinning up Scroll Three girls.
  The Hittites, having armed their men to the teeth with big hammers,
  Singer sewing machines and complete spanner sets, then clash with
  Egypt. History says that neither wins, and both empires begin to
  crumble. *I* say one crumbled a tad more than the other. In fact,
  *I* say I've never heard of the Hittites. 'Nuff said?

1180 BC
  The famous Siege of Troy, where the Greeks came up with the idea of
  giving away free samples (of giant wooden horses) for product
  promotion and genocidal purposes. The horse is left outside the
  gates of Troy, loaded with Greek warriors, who manage to keep from
  giggling while the Trojans drag it back inside. The rest is
  history. Now, where does Pandora fit into all this?

THING         PART 9
====================

            (Someone knocks on the door. Jeff goes to look
                  out the window and see who it is.)

JEFF:    Oh Shit, it's the Salvos!

RON:     But we're not homeless. We live in what could loosely be
         described as a home. Ergo elk, we're not homeless.

JEFF:    I think you'll find they're not after us to give us tea and
         save our souls, more like scum some money off us.

RON:     Oh, now that's a different matter.

                     (Another knock on the door)

JEFF:    Quick Ron, get rid of them.

                        (Ron opens the door).

RON:     Yeah?

SALVO 1: Hello, we're collecting for the Red Shield Appeal.

RON:     Sorry, we don't have any spare red shields.

SALVO 2: No no, a donation. Money.

RON:     Money? Dollars? Cash?

SALVO 1: Yes.

JEFF:    Tell her there's none in the house.

RON:     There's none in the house. It's all hidden in a small metal
         box buried in the park, due east from here, landlubber.

SALVO 1: (backing away) Yes well, fine, sorry to trouble you.

RON:     Take thirty steps north from the roundabout, arr, and there
         ye be.

            (Jeff comes to the door and pushes Ron away.)

JEFF:    Please, don't worry about Ron. Ron, go sit down. Hello, Red
         Shield Appeal, is it? Collecting for the homeless?

SALVO 2: Yes.

JEFF:    Right, well, I don't know if you realised this, but we don't
         actually live here. We're wossname.. squatting. We're
         actually homeless. So... ummm.. could you give us some
         money?

SALVO 1: What?

JEFF:    Go on, just a few bucks for a pizza. Oh, and a bottle of
         Coke. It'd save our lives.

SALVO 1: It doesn't actually work like that. Besides, this
         doesn't look like a squat.

JEFF:    Doesn't it? Oh well, no, that's because we've taken very
         good care of it. We're squatters, but we're *proud*. And
         because other organisations have donated... the sofa, and
         the TV...

SALVO 2: And the drinks cabinet?

JEFF:    Erm... yeah, look... heh heh...

                 (Jeff shuts the door in their faces
                     and goes back to the sofa.)

RON:     So can we claim a tax deduction?

JEFF:    What, just because they came to the door? No, I think you'll
         find in the small print in the Tax Pack that it says you
         actually have to give them some money before it's
         deductible.

RON:     I don't know why they bother collecting for the homeless.
         How would they find them?

JEFF:    Give me strength, Lord.

RON:     Oh sorry, I didn't realise you were a Christian.

                (Ron goes back to watching the telly.)

JEFF:    I'm not a Christian, I was just requesting that a deity, any
         deity, enhance my powers of patience in order to aid my
         dealings with your STUPID MIND! ALL YOU EVER DO IS SIT THERE
         PICKING YOUR NOSE AND MAKING THE MOST STUPID OBSERVATIONS!

RON:     Haha ha! Those Biker Mice From Mars are great. Sorry, what
         did you say?

JEFF:    Don't worry about it. Just sit there. Go on! Sit there! Just
         sit there watching cartoons. Don't try and indulge in any
         type of intelligent conversation. Just sit there with the
         brain on neutral and take in the telly.

RON:     Okay. Oh, commercial break. Hey, have you seen my Berholt
         Brecht anywhere?

                   (Ron goes off to find his book)

JEFF:    And while you're at it Lord, please strike Ron down. Just a
         little bit? Please? Just a small lightning bolt? A small,
         localised, swarm of locusts? Bees? Some kind of killer mind
         eating disease?

"Toxic Custard in triplicate"


Dear readers,
    I would like to apologise for the abundance of Toxic Custards
    that have inundated you over the previous two weeks. However, I'm
    sure you'll be aware that the Internet Committee For Increased
    Bureaucracy now requires that mailing lists are always sent to
    readers in triplicate. The recommended method of reading is to
    print out your Toxic Custards three times onto transparent paper,
    and hold them together up to the light for reading. It's
    especially cool when two of the copies are either upside-down or
    back-to-front or both.
        (And yes, I am wrestling with the mailing software).

                      TOXIC HISTORY OF THE WORLD
                          Part 2 of A Stack

c1060-c970 BC
  David is king of Israel. During this time, the first negotiations
  take place with the PLO, but to no avail. The rest of the world
  eagerly waits for a resolution...

c970-c940 BC
  Solomon is king of Israel. Sheesh, why couldn't Israel make up its
  mind? Anyway, Solomon uses his enormous wealth to build the Temple
  at Jerusalem. Others argue that such a large infrastructure project
  should not be contemplated under such economic conditions. Solomon
  starts to get irritated when a petition is raised by local
  residents fearing noise from prayers and the destruction of a local
  beauty spot (where the sand is piled into particularly picturesque
  dunes).

800 BC
  The Phoenicians found Carthage. They shouldn't have lost it in the
  first place. Carthage had actually been left on the bus from
  Dandios to Chadzintium in 802 BC, and had been sitting in a lost
  property office for 18 months. The Phoenicians just happened to be
  going past the lost property office the day before everything got
  auctioned off, so as you can see, it was a pretty close run thing.

776 BC
  First Olympiad. Karlos Lewisophonos is stripped of his gold
  medallion when it is found he has been using performance enhancing
  herbs. Greek women protest at their non-admittance, mainly because
  they want to see the athletes, who are competing nude. Several
  well-endowed athletes injure themselves during the running events,
  inspiring the Pole Vault for the next Olympics.

753 BC
  Rome founded. It probably involves some Caesar or other digging the
  first sod, or opening a plaque, or some other kind of ceremony. "I
  hereby declare this Empire open. May Zeus bless her, and all who
  live in her." Something like that. Followed by an inaugural
  crucifixion.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

What's this? O.J. Simpson charged with murder?! No! So, let's take a
walk down to the betting shop to see who'll be the next famous person
to be arrested...
    1000 to 1 on Prince Charles being charged with littering
    500 to 1 on the Pope being caught stealing condoms from the
         Chemist
    100 to 1 on Roseanne Arnold murdering Tom and eating his corpse
    50 to 1 on John Major assaulting photographers outside Downing St
    10 to 1 on Ron Birchall, Jeremy Beadle's neighbour, going round
         to Jeremy's place to smash his face in
    4 to 1 on Keith Richards being arrested for drugs possession.
         (Normally it's all used before he can be caught)

Yes, it's true. Shoes harass me. I've been looking for a new pair of
runners for several months now. And while my old, increasingly
soleless shoes continue stepping their way to destruction, I find
myself unable to make a definitive decision about a new pair. "What's
the problem", I hear you ask. (Other questions you may be asking are
"What fucked up his mind?" and "What's the number of that therapy
clinic?")
    The problem is that of choice. Too much of it. I know it's meant
to be wonderful to live in a consumer society. I know it's great to
have the power of choice over which one of a million products I want
to throw my cash at. But how *do* you choose two shoes out of a
million pairs? Apart from ensuring that they are a matching pair, and
are a reasonable fit on my feet, what other criteria are there?
    Okay, I don't plan to wear anything too outrageous. And it has to
be within the bounds of what's sensible to spend on a pair of feet
protectors. I'm unlikely to be attracted by the kind of shoes that
would put the country's richest entrepreneurs into bankruptcy. (In
fact, it's known that several rising stars of the 1980s got caught
when it came to footwear.)
    There are shoes for everything. For jogging (ie slow running with
the aim of ultimately going nowhere, because you generally run to
"somewhere and back"), cross training (for example, angrily telling
those miserable kids in the junior footy team to get on with 50 laps
of the oval and 10 push-ups each before they get their dinner),
tennis, etc, etc, etc. I just want shoes to wear while doing stuff.
But they don't seem to have a category for that, so I have to try and
work out what the closest to "stuff" is.
    Anyway, you'll be happy to hear that I've solved the whole
problem. I'm determined now. Tomorrow, I'm going to the absolutely
biggest shoe shop in the city. I'm going to walk in there, my head
held high. I won't browse. I won't "just look". I will choose my
shoes at a speed estimated by witnesses as less than three seconds.
It will be fast. It will be decisive. And it will be random, because
I'll be going in with a blindfold over my head, and pointing to a
random pair of shoes.

                      TOXIC HISTORY OF THE WORLD
                    Part 3 of A Rather Large Pile

750-550 BC
  Greek city states emerge on Greek mainland and around the coasts of
  the Mediterranean and Black sea. It's probably about now that the
  name "Macedonia" first gets argued about.

691 BC
  Assyrians conquer Egypt. The Assyrian accountants spend endless
  summer evenings arguing about how the Egyptians ever could have
  raised the cash to build the pyramids, especially during the
  recession of 3000 BC. An attempted calculation of the depreciation
  on the Sphinx causes overloads on several abacuses (abacii?)

660 BC
  First Mikado in Japan meets rapturous applause and goes on to do a
  six month season at the Tokyo National Theatre.

659 BC
  First Pirates Of Penzance in Japan. We don't really need to take
  this joke any further, do we?

612 BC
  Chaldeans conquer Assyrians (just as they were getting their heads
  around tax rebates for infrastructure investments) and establish
  second Babylonian Empire. They are condemned for their execution
  and torture of civilians, and for giving inspiration for Boney M
  over 2000 years later.

597 BC
  Nebuchadnezzar, Chaldean emperor, captures Jerusalem in a campaign
  of rock throwing and car bombs, and carries off the Jews into
  captivity.

594 BC
  Solon lays the foundations of Athenian democracy. Unfortunately,
  stone voting tablets make counting a real pain in the arse.

560 BC
  Buddha born. It wasn't until later that he put on weight. It is not
  recorded whether or not he gained hair before losing it all again.
  Amongst his most amazing achievements is getting copyright over his
  own image, which means that if you look carefully you'll find a
  "Copyright (c) Buddha Holdings Inc, 520 BC" on the bottom of every
  Buddha. Well, okay, not the *bottom*... oh, you know what I mean.

551 BC
  Confucious born. His first great saying is "goo gaa gggoo blarp."

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox
jumps over the lazy dog again. Perhaps the lazy dog should get up
from where it's lying and go out and get a job. The taxpayers
shouldn't have to support a dog that is so lazy that all it does is
lie around being jumped over by quick brown foxes. In fact, it's
parasites like the lazy dog that make it very difficult for many
quick brown foxes to keep jumping.
    Many quick brown foxes spoken to by Toxic Custard were unhappy
about this. "Yeah, it's like we're subsidising them lazy dogs..."

THING        PART 10
====================

                 (The television starts to go fuzzy)

RON:    Hey, what's wrong with this telly?

JEFF:   Wrong? Nothing? Nothing should be wrong. It's brand new, we
        only bought it last week. Should be nothing wrong. Wrong?
        What do you mean wrong? What have you done to it? What
        buttons have you pressed? What foul deeds have you performed
        on its fine tuning? What desecration has been done to its
        antenna?! What sacrilege is this?!!?

RON:    Keep your toupee on, I'm sure it's nothing serious.

                   (Jeff tries switching channels.)

JEFF:   Nothing serious?! That was my fucking five hundred dollars!
        Look, none of the channels work!

RON:    Yeah yeah yeah. Hold on, I'll try a kick.

           (Ron gives the TV a kick on the left hand side,
          and is about to try another on the right when Jeff
          grabs his leg, pulls Ron's shoe off, throws it out
      the window, and starts hitting Ron's foot with a mallet.)

JEFF:   Don't kick my telly! Don't kick my telly!

RON:    All right, all right! Ow! All right, it's under warranty,
        we'll call a TV repairman.

JEFF:   Correction: YOU will call a repairman. I'll get back to
        reading the new phone book. Now, where were we? Ah yes,
        Government Services fast index...



         (Later. Jeff is still reading the phone book. Ron is
      asleep on the couch, probably dreaming about naked people,
      with a big grin on his face. There is a knock at the door.
           Ron wakes up with a start, and goes to open it.)

RON:    Yeah?

TV MAN: TV Repair.

RON:    Oh yeah, come on in.

JEFF:   Just a minute. Photo identification, please.

TV MAN: What?

JEFF:   Identification. We can't let just anyone in here, you know.
        Security. For all we know, you could be a lunatic
        psychopathic who'll plant a bomb in our telly which kills us
        all when we tune into A Current Affair.

TV MAN: So the fact that I said "TV Repair", when your mate here
        answered the door, and I could have only known that you
        wanted a TV repaired if you had rung me, is of no import?

JEFF:   Ah well, yes. That death-defying logic will do. Come in.

TV MAN: So, this is the telly, is it? Tsssstt.. I dunno. The ol'
        Mitsanyasonic '94, is it? Tricky to get the parts for this
        one...

JEFF:   May I remind you that this is under warranty, so you don't
        need to inflate the price or repair time by saying Tssst a
        lot and muttering about cowboy manufacturers?

TV MAN: Oh. Okay. Well, let's try...

               (He kicks the TV on the right hand side.
                  The picture comes back instantly.)

TV MAN: All right? Sign here please.

          (Jeff signs the clipboard, and the TV man leaves.
      Ron changes the TV back to the cartoons, and Jeff sighs.)
