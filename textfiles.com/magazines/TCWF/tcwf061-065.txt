(what a subtle plug!), in front of a crowd of people who will be              ?

-Well, that's what happens when we have seventy-six sets of photographs       r
under the name of Smith from their holidays on Great Keppel Island one        y
Summer two years ago. Things get lost. I do sympathise with you, they         .
must have been historic and memorable moments for you and your entire
family. Thank you so much for entrusting us with your memories. Which         W
we've lost. Still, look at the good side-- if you leave the shop in the       e
next ten seconds, we won't charge you for it. Oh! Just a moment.. found       l
them! Here they are! Take a look!                                             l

    -Hmm.. yes.. these are mine. Hey.. I remember that! The cat looks a
    little out of focus.. I never did know which dial was the.. oh            m
    dear.. that one's a bit blurred.. and the cat's head got cut off.         o
    Naughty old Michael with his hedge-clippers, dear dear dear. Look         s
    at that.. see? That's where the RSPCA man hit Michael. Serves him         t
    right. Not quite enough light in that one. Oh, there's a big black
    streak across the one of the policeman taking Michael away..              o

-Yes, that was a mechanical fault, we were having the processing
machine erm.. processed, at the time.                                         i

    -Ah. This one with the grubby fingerprints..                              ,

-Yes, the mechanic reached into where the photos were.. dirt also got         a
onto some other photos from a family called Smith, from their holidays        n
on Great Keppel two years ago..                                               y

    -Oh.. Anyway, in this one Michael had punched the policeman and run       a
    off down the street, with the police car and me and my camera in          y
    hot pursuit. Hmm.. looks like the vertical-hold needed adjusting.         .

-We'd better wrap this up and think of a punchline so you can piss off        Y
out of my shop and I can go and have some lunch.                              o

Well, can we really define "end"? The term "end" is so often                  u
misconstrued as the final apocalypse, when it may in fact be merely the       l
transfer of the life-force to better and greater things. When looking         d
at the cycle of life, it's important to realise these things.                 n

CANNIBALISM AT MONASH CLAYTON
The Cannibalism Party has launched its appeal for votes (please!!!) for       H
the forthcoming Monash Clayton student elections. Author's sister and         m
Housing and Transport Committee candidate Susannah Bowen said on a            m
campaign leaflet that "the only easy, cheap solution to the current           .
overcrowding on buses, in Halls of Residence and throughout Monash is         .
cannibalism." She would not deny that she doesn't actually want the
job, and would not comment when not asked if her party's ideas were           n
influenced by the circulation of the "American Psycho" book around the        u
campus. Ms Bowen's brother and incredible superhuman goodguy Daniel was       m
expected at the time of writing to stop writing this bit any moment           b
now, and to go on to write something funnier. We hope.                        e

The giant boulder came speeding down the corridor, crushing all in its        6
path as it bore down on him, faster and faster.                               3
    "Well, fuck me!" he exclaimed. "Granite, wouldn't you say, Doctor?"       .
    "It's hard to say from this distance", replied Doctor Wedge, who          .
for convenience sake had lost his accent. "Perhaps as it squashes us
flat, I could scoop a sample out of it for analysis?"                         T
    They stood for several seconds, watching it rolling down the              e
corridor towards them. You had to admit, they were being very cool            r
about it. But then, *Popsicle* was always cool about things. The Doctor       r
was too, usually because he didn't know what was going on.                    i
    *Popsicle* decided that this might be a good time to cease being          f
cool about things, and be quite alarmed about things, otherwise there         i
was a good chance that were the boulder to get much closer, they would        c
both be flat about things.                                                    .
    "Shhhiiiiiiiittt!" remarked *Popsicle* extremely uncoolly, as he
flung the Doctor out of the way of the boulder and dived for cover,           P
unfortunately in the direction of a rather inconveniently placed              o
dung-heap. "Well, that's another cheap suit ruined", said *Popsicle*,         p
crawling out of the mire just in time to see the boulder disappearing         s
off into the distance, and noting that it was bright red; a somewhat          i
odd colour for a giant granite boulder. Though he had to admit, he            c
thought to himself (and to whoever was reading), that the simple              l
occurence of the boulder rolling down the corridor like that was fairly       e
odd itself, especially as they were in fact somewhere in F block at
Monash University's Caulfield campus. He could only assume that it was        h
in fact a rather overdone piece of ceramics, which had rolled out of          a
the fine arts building.                                                       t
    *Popsicle* noted with superhuman suspicion that he appeared in the        h
current issue of the student newspaper (get your copy today, folks!),
then went to collect the Doctor, who, having landed on the floor in one       r
of the rooms, was examining the texture of the carpet, and singing to         e
himself an old carpet-laying shanty.                                          t
                                                                              u
        "Oh we come with our carpet, hoo-hoo-hooray!                          r
         And our hammer and nails, all ready to lay!                          n
         We'll lay all your carpet in less than a day!                        e
         But if we don't get paid, then we'll take it away!                   t
                                                                              h
    "*Popsicle*, I may be old and senile, and earning too much money          e
from the establishment, but even I can see that the hand you are              d
holding out to me is covered in dung", continued the Doctor (and he
was right). "You're filthy, why don't we go and have a shower?"               t
    "I will. You can keep examining the floor", replied *Popsicle*,           h
pushing Doc Wedge back to it for a closer look.                               i
    "Extraordinary.." said the Doctor when Popsicle got back. "This           s
carpet seems to be made of virgin wool."
    "Does that mean it's from a sheep that's never been shagged?"             i
    "We're moving towards shag pile jokes, shall we continue this             s
dialogue another time?"                                                       s
    "Yes, good idea."                                                         u
    So they did.                                                              e

                                                                              h
        - Look, I don't need this. I don't need the law coming round          a
        here and hassling me about concertos. I haven't heard anything.       t

- C'mon Lenny, we know there's been activity in this neighbourhood.           g
There's been three violin soloists in just the past week!                     r
                                                                              e
        - I don't know nothing about it.                                      a
                                                                              t
- You? Huh.. don't think I've forgotten about that little stretch you         ?
did for those armed symphonies a couple of years back. And we never
found the lute. I haven't forgotten. I'm sharper than you think.              N
                                                                              o
        - Look Sideburn, I haven't heard anything, honest. I've gone          ,
        quiet since clink.
                                                                              n
- Well, maybe, Lenny.. but remember this. If I get a whiff of so much         o
as a tune-up, I'll be down on you like a grand-piano. I'm the law here,       t
and I'm not having any orchestras on my ground. Clear?

He's really such a git.

Why do you think he does it? I don't know!                                    r

And now for some MTC News, and first of all, architecture.
                                                                              c
The new Lee Ning tower, which was deliberately built to tilt on an            a
angle of 3 degrees (or 37.4 Fahrenheit) has been brought by Pizza Hut         n
to be their new world headquarters. You can probably guess what they're
going to call it. The police department rejected the building earlier         t
in the month because it wasn't bent. Besides, they didn't get around to       e
looking at tenders; they were too busy watching the AFL Grand Final.          l

                                                                              ?
And here comes Hawthorn's half-back Tuck with the ball, a drop punt to
centre half-forward where Brereton's waiting, what a mark! No, sorry,         W
what a Dermott! He handpasses straight to Jarman, who was momentarily         e
blinded by light reflecting off two hundred Eagles supporters' yellow         l
caps in the grandstand nearby. Never mind, they'll be wishing they            l
never heard of football once the game's over and Hawthorn has won by          ,
the predicted 53 points.
    Jarman falls over in a daze as Lockyer for the Eagles grabs the           I
ball, only to be set upon by ten surrounding Hawthorn players, and the
umpire stops play for a bounce, due to the confusion over possession,         c
and to confuse any overseas viewers who don't understand the rules. The       a
ball is knocked out by the Eagles' Pyke, who is then knocked out by           n
Platten, who is still in a mean mood after pranging the car last week.        ,
    Condon grabs the ball for Hawthorn, and kicks to Brereton, another
mark for Brereton who if he touched his own balls as much as he's             a
touched this one during the game, would be completely blind already.          c
And I bet we get castrated by the broadcasting tribunal for that one.         t
Brereton lines up with goal.. he kicks McIntosh in the shin before            u
kicking the ball between the two big posts down at the end of the             a
ground there.. Another goal for Hawthorn, and the Hawthorn fans up a          l
notch in enthusiasm, and the Eagles fans go down a notch in depression.       l
    That makes the score 19 18 to 13 7, or for Australian viewers, who        y
probably can't handle the multiplication, and anyone who doesn't              .
understand the weird scoring system, Hawthorn lead the Eagles 132 to
86. And now we'll take a quick thirty second commercial break so we can       T
pay for this telecast and be back just a bit too late to miss the next        h
bounce of the ball.                                                           e

DIARY                                             MONDAY 30TH SEPTEMBER       n

Got up. Stretched quite a lot. Purred a bit. Went to back door to go          w
outside to relieve myself. It was raining, so I tried the front               e
instead. I asked Owner#1 to turn off the rain and make it a bit warmer        r
out there, but he didn't do anything. And he seemed angry that I didn't
want to go out after all. Who wants to go out for a crap when it's            i
freezing cold? The Owners manage to keep the weather inside house warm        s
enough, and turn on the suns on and off, so why won't they do it for          ,
me, when I want to go out?
    In the afternoon, when it had stopped raining, I decided to get           i
Owner#2 a peace offering. I found her a very nice fresh bird, but she         t
just made a noise and gestured at me to get rid of it. I tried to
insist, but then Owner#1 came and put it in the container thing in the        d
corner. I tried to get it back out again, but couldn't reach up to the        o
opening.                                                                      e
    I complained about dinner while Owner#2 was getting it ready for          s
me. I must have said "I don't want that bloody Whiskas muck again" a          n
hundred times, but did she listen? No! When will they get used to the         '
fact that I'm sick of Sardine And Salmon?                                     t
    After dinner I went out to watch the lights going past along the          .
black thing. Funny how those lights usually go past in pairs. I knew
there was a storm coming, so I tried to get back inside. The Owners           I
were watching their box, so I had to shout at the window for a while
before they let me in. They took their bloody time, I was soaking wet         t
by the time they opened the door for me. Still, I thanked them anyway,        h
by rubbing myself on their legs in appreciation.                              i
                                                                              n

You could tell, couldn't you? Don't answer that. It's basically a             c
consequence of assignments. The history of assignments goes back to the       t
17th century, when 16th century born French scholar and right bastard         u
Francois De'Crepit thought he'd piss his students off completely by           a
setting numerous numbers of theoretically useful but practically              l
useless exercises all due in a two week period about two thirds of the        l
way through what was to become known as the semester. He also developed       y
long sentences that had to be read at least twice before they made any        ,
sense like the previous one made any sense like the previous one.

We live on a most remarkable planet. It's really very nice. Seen any of       e
it lately? Anyway, we all know that birds fly south for the winter. So
what do birds down here in the southern hemisphere do? Maybe they fly         b
further south. No, then they'd end up in Antarctica (Americans read           r
"Andardigger"). So.. in winter, what do birds native to Antarctica do?        a
Yeah, the penguins. Perhaps they waddle south. They wouldn't get very         i
far. And they'd never come back; it's always winter at the poles.             n

Oh.. erm.. It should say on the bottom of my old shoes.. I'll just            e
twist my foot around to get a look at them. hmm.. can't quite make it         e
out, it seems to have rubbed off.. I'll take a guess at nine.                 k

No no, please! Look, they seem to almost fit. I mean, I can feel my big       a
toes being crushed to a pulp, and my heels are about to burst out the         n
back, and I'm not sure the circulation is getting all the way around,         y
