MRS IRENE BUSYBODY SPEAKS OUT ON...                                           H
Christmas. Christ knows where the idea of Christmas came from. Jesus?         o
What kind of peace-loving poof was he anyway? You know where Jesus
would have come in handy? Working at McDonald's. One wave of his hand..       h
and bingo! Two hundred Filet'o'Fishes, piping hot. "Enjoy your meal,          o
brother, and have a good life. Oh, I see that you are one of the meek.
Here, have one of our complimentary 'Inherit The Earth' special offer         h
coupons."                                                                     o
    But how on Earth did the anniversary of the birth of Christ turn
into the vomit-inducing commercial Christmas we know and hate today?          h
Well I'll tell you. It all happened centuries ago. A consortium of            o
mediaeval toy manufacturers decided to promote Christmas as a time of
goodwill, and convince the ignorant peasants that the only way to show        h
goodwill was to give the kids a Robin Hood Action-Peasant doll to play        o
with. With working accessories. Collect the whole Merry Men (tm) range.
    I really really really hate Christmas. Queueing up for years to buy       h
all the Christmas presents for the little brats of relatives I know,          a
when I know full well that they'll hate everything I hand over to them.
Well, almost everything. Let's face it, either they'll hate it and            h
never use it, or they'll love it and smash it to pieces within five           a
minutes of getting it.
    Last Christmas I gave a cricket bat to my nephew, Matthew. Twenty         h
minutes later we were in the ambulance on the way to hospital to get          e
fifteen stitches put in his sister Jenny's head. And the bat was
broken. Bloody Taiwanese rubbish. We got another bat, of course. And          h
Matthew does use it. For battering the other neighbourhood kids around.       e
So it's been useful for him. He's collected $200 from threatening this
year. So he'll be able to get some nice Christmas presents for his            h
family. The spirit of giving, what a wonderful thing.                         a

CHRISTMAS TO BE CANCELLED?
Santaprises Ltd has been dogged by financial problems this year, and          h
there are now some doubts that Christmas will go ahead at all. In             a
September it was announced that Santaprises had made a $16.5 million          h
pre-tax loss in a year. Santa said at the time that profitability would       a
increase later in the year.                                                   h
    In October a dispute with the Federated Elves Union slowed                a
preparations for the Christmas rush. The FEU wanted working hours and
pay to be improved, with particular emphasis on penalty rates for late        h
Christmas Eve work. A spokeself for the FEU claimed that most staff           o
worked constantly on Christmas Eve, without even a break, and that more
staff should be hired to handle present deliveries. The dispute was           h
settled peacefully, the elves accepting the offer of an extra tax-free        o
lollypop for every hour worked.
    Early last week, two men representing owners of some of the sleds         t
leased to Santaprises boarded a sled at the North Pole Santaprises            e
Despatch Centre and tried to repossess it-                                    e
                                                                              h
MAN 1: Okay scumbags. Stop loading those presents. This is our sled,          e
        and we want it back.                                                  e

        Property of something means you can give it away. Giving things       e
        away is great. That's my game, man. I'm a sort of reverse debt        s
        collector. Giving makes you feel good. It gives you a great high      t
        to give someone something. Okay, so it may cost me heaps, but         !
        every year... woo! What a trip! And anyway, bro', have you got a

THE ADVENTURES OF *POPSICLE*                                                  o
                                                                              ,
Mr *Popsicle*, secret agent for A.R.S.E, and Inspector Unnecessary-
Violence are nearing the end of an investigation into nutmeg smugglers.       t
*Popsicle* prised himself.. I mean prides himself on being one of the         h
most commonly appearing characters in TCWF. The author valiantly              a
managed to avoid embedding a plug for TCWF back-issues in the middle of       t
the story. In any case, you should know what's happening with the plot,
and if you don't, I suggest you take a look at the bac*ARGH*                  w
                                                                              a
*Popsicle* and the Inspector drove into the university and spent              s
half an hour looking for a parking space, before giving up and parking
in a disabled space, the Inspector reasoning that if anyone argued with       1
them, he'd disable them. They were looking out for one of the                 9
lecturers, named Rob, who had been named as the nutmeg supplier.              9
    It took them fifteen minutes and five violent threats to find Rob's       1
office, up on the sixth floor of `F' block. Whereas they could have           .
just strolled in and arrested him, it was agreed between them that they
should surround the place, because it was potentially more violent.           W
After consulting with headquarters, and the author (who agreed on the         h
grounds that it would make the end of the story more dramatic), they          e
set up their men from the A.R.S.E. Hostage Overview Liberation                r
Efforcement squad around the office.                                          e
    As soon as the Inspector had figured out how to turn the megaphone        '
on, his voice rang out down the corridor and around the corner to the         d
room, from where he and *Popsicle* had positioned themselves.
    "Mr Robert Redpork! This is the Australian Royal Security                 i
Establishment, Mr Redpork. You have five seconds to come out and              t
surrender with your hands up, your feet down, and your shoulders
somewhere in between. If you do not surrender within five seconds,            a
we're coming in for you. Five seconds, Mr Redpork.. and after that,           l
we'll waltz straight in there and take you, dead or alive."                   l
    It took the Inspector just under a minute to count to five. Then he
gave the order. "Start the music!" One of the squad turned on the tape        g
recorder, and armed men from all directions waltzed their way towards         o
the door. As they neared it, the door opened, and a man walked out,           ?
wearing a red skivvy(*), brown corduroy trousers, sandals, a haircut
banned by the Geneva Convention, and an identity tag stuck (with some         I
pleasure) to his left nipple, proclaiming "Robert Redpork, Computer
Technology Lecturer".                                                         h
    "What's all this noise?" he shouted above the din of the band.            o
"It's just one or two of you up the back, ruining it for all of us,           p
isn't it. Keep the noise down, please!"                                       e
    So, after searching his office, they arrested him for illegal
possession of nutmeg. Later additional haircut charges were added, and        y
*Popsicle* and the Inspector congratulated themselves on a truly              o
wonderful investigation by getting completely pissed and trying out           u
half-a-dozen of the confiscated nutmegs.
                                                                              d

Australia was victorious over India in the third test at the Melbourne        m
Cricket Ground which finished on Sunday. A major part of the Australian       e
victory has been attributed to the brand new Great Southern Stand,            t
which collapsed just after lunch when the crowd attempted an                  h
over-enthusiastic Mexican wave. The stand squashed most of the Indian         i
team, leaving only captain Mohammad Azharuddin left uninjured to field        n
by himself for the entire day. It could be said that that the remaining       g
day of play in the game should have been abandoned, but it was felt
(especially among the Australian team) that it would be a hell of a lot       m
of fun. They managed to score 20,209 runs during the day, cementing           o
their victory. Australia declared when their running shoes wore out.          r

HAPPY NEW YEAR!

- Hello. I'd like to exchange last year for a new year, please.

        - But.. what happened to the old one?                                 S
                                                                              o
- It's gone! It went at midnight last Tuesday night. We were all in the       ,
street counting down with the clock, pissed as newts, and when we
reached zero, it had gone! 1991 had completely vanished by the time           t
we'd finished the first verse of Auld Lang Syne and started throwing          h
bottles at the policemen. We were practising for Bush's visit on              e
Friday. Anyway.. I'm telling you! 1991 is gone! Kaput!
                                                                              n
        - I see. And in exchange for a vanished old year, last season's       e
        model, I might add, you expect us to hand over to you, without        w
        charge, a brand new top-of-the-range 1992 year with a free
        bonus day and special "Leap" feature?                                 y
                                                                              e
- Yes please.                                                                 a

        -- *sigh* Well, okay. Here you are. Please take care of it.
        Don't let it fly by, I want it back by next year!                     h

MRS IRENE BUSYBODY SPEAKS OUT ON...                                           d
America. I think America is a wonderful place. Disneyland, the Grand          o
Canyon, the Rocky Mountains, the Statue of Liberty. I think the US            e
Government should build the twin statue for the Statue of Liberty. It         s
could be a gigantic monument to all the values of America today. It
could be the huge statue of a white drug-running poverty-stricken anti-       f
choice mass-murdering rap-dancing Ku-Klux-Klan supporting Republican          l
voter who looks like a cross between Arnie and Sly Stallone, with big         y
Rambo muscles (with the scars and stuff), a hamburger, a horrific
accent and a big hat. Drinking loads of beer and watching the Superbowl       a
while he fires his gun into a restaurant.                                     l
    George Bush flew in last week, to meet the people, look around and        o
take in all that Australia has to offer. In 67 hours. And I bet half of       n
that was looking at the clouds through a plane window.                        g
    Why is it that Bush looks so... shrivelled? Not as shrivelled as          .
Ronald Reagan looked, I'll admit, but still shrivelled. He looks to me
like the type of weedy git everyone would gang up on in the school yard       I
if he hadn't brought his 200 security men along. I saw him on the             s
telly, driving down the freeway from the airport, somewhere in a convoy
of twenty big black cars. It must be to prevent terrorist attacks -           i
they won't know which car to aim for. I wonder if he found out about          t
the protestors in the city centre? A sort of New World Public Disorder.
I saw those thousand points of light, too. When all the press                 r
photographers' flashes went off at once as he made some inane comment         e
about Waltzing Matilda.                                                       a
    But he holds such power in those fingers of his. Apart from               l
insulting people through car windows, that is. It's his job to protect        l
the world.. to protect the world from the horror, the anguish and the         y
pain of Dan Quayle. I wonder if the CIA even try and protect Quayle?
Maybe they just try and make sure he doesn't impale himself on a pen          1
he's signing documents with. Or would they really bother? Would it be         9
such a loss? I wonder if Mrs Quayle is also of abnormally low                 9
intelligence? She'd have to be, you'd think, to marry him in the first        1
place. And if that's the case, how thick are their offspring going to
be?                                                                           a
                                                                              l

That was the first Toxic Custard for 1992. Hooray,                            e
happy new year etc etc. Now go and do something                               a
useful. Or, if you don't feel like it, you could                              d
grab a look at TCWF back-issues. For details of how                           y

It's just as well most houses have less toilets than people. Otherwise,
you can bet everyone would be on the toilet when the phone rings.

The best thing about hearing a Bryan Adams song on the radio                  A
is knowing there won't be another one for at least a couple of hours.         n
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -       o
                                                                              t
Ever wondered how paper is recycled? It's from old paper, of course.          h
But not straight away. Most old paper being recycled has been used, so        e
it has to be processed first. All the old paper is put into a bloody          r
big machine, and the ink that's on it is systematically scraped off by
a sort of a razor blade. When that's finished, the paper is clean and         d
ready to be used for something else, and not only that.. the ink is           a
churned up in a big pot and melted into liquid again, so it can be            y
re-used for filling up zillions of biros. What good is this, you might        ,
ask. Okay, so recycling paper saves trees all over the world which
provides more oxygen to breathe so the human race can wipe itself out         a
by something other than asphyxiation.                                         n
    But what about the ink? Ever stop and wonder where ink comes from?        o
In fact, ink is made from the dead corpses of the Inca tribes of Peru.        t
The Inca peoples were (and in some areas, still are) a proud race of          h
warriors, but they tend, like most of us, to slow down a bit when             e
they're dead. Still, while they're still alive, their diets consist of        r
a number of South American berries, so many that much of their
bloodstream, by the time they die, is navy blue.                              d
    This was discovered earlier this century by a little Hungarian            o
twerp, who decided to drain out the blood from dead Incas, boil it up         l
and use it as "ink" (a cruel and sadistic pun if ever there was one) in       l
his new invention, the biro. What a bastard. Tribes in other areas of         a
South America eat red berries and it is these areas that are harvested        r
for red ink. Expeditions into South America are still sponsored by Bic,       ,
Pentel and Parker, to retrieve tribal bodies and suck ink out of them.
    So.. recycle your paper today! Save trees and Inca corpses!               a
                                                                              n

Hi, I'd like to buy a pair of red pyjamas please, size Large. Yes,            h
they'll do fine. And I'd like a red skivvy (*), size Large. And what          e
have you got in the way of red pullovers? Yes, v-neck. Size? Oh,              r
probably about Large. Some red underpants? And have you got anything in
way of red trousers? Oh, surely you must have something? Well yes, I          w
*do* want red. I'm a red fetishist, you see. I love red. It's a great         e
colour, red. Okay, so politically it isn't so popular now, but look at        e
it spectrum-wise. Look at how red the red is. Its... reddishness. Isn't       k
it great? In fact, there's a red fetishists' convention next week.            ,
Called "Ready for Red '92 - Reddening our world." Unfortunately, my
wife has had enough of red, and doesn't want to come with me. She's           a
into blue.                                                                    n

(*) American readers read "turtleneck". Jesus, can't you people use           t
proper English?                                                               h

The author's sister, a linguistics student, would like to point out           r
that the above comment is a highly PRESCRIPTIVIST notion. Language
variation is as solid a fact as the Newbrook Austo-Asian                      C
phonetic/phonemic distribution theory. Standard North American usage          u
may find the lexical item "skivvy" difficult to process, but intra and        s
international semantic and lexical variation is the spice which makes         t
our lives joyful.                                                             a
                                                                              r
The author would like to point out to his sister that this is HIS             d
outlet for his private grudges against the world and not hers, or             .

UFOs. Well, it's a load of crap, isn't it. Here we are on the little          h
planet Earth wondering if there's any intelligent life in the universe.       e
And trying to send out messages to attract aliens. I wonder why? Don't        r
we have enough problems of our own without inviting little green men to
fly in and strut their stuff in public, disrupting people's busy lives?       M
Anyway.. they're *alien*, aren't they? Strange and unknown. How do we         o
know they haven't already landed? How do we know the aliens haven't           n
already arrived and infiltrated the human race? I sometimes wonder            d
about my husband Fred, actually. He's a very strange person in some           a
ways. I used to think he might be a visiting alien, but I decided he's        y
probably just dim. But then, he is the typical Australian man.                ,
    I've often wondered just what would happen if aliens landed in our
cities. They could land in Melbourne, by the Arts Centre, and nobody          a
would notice their flying saucer.. everyone would think it was a new          n
avant-garde sculpture. They could climb out with their green scaly            o
skin and their two hundred tentacles each and walk up the street              t
sucking up small children, and everyone would think it was a new form         h
of street theatre. Who actually organises those sculptures, and that          e
street threatre? I'll tell you the truth. The aliens are already here.        r
The Arts Centre spire is a landing beacon for them. Everyone you see
around the Arts Centre is strange. And you never see street artists           s
talking to people, do you? It's true. They're ALIENS. I always thought        i
mime was suspicious.                                                          d

TC's too short, I write alone
Maybe I'll try and do a poem
It's ten o'clock, I'm out of time
Trying to get this stuff to rhyme
But is it funny? No not really
In fact, it's really pretty silly.

Yuck.

  Debate has been running hot down a blind alleyway off Fitzroy Street        ,
and going round and round in political circles on the subject of rain
this week. Prime Minister and self-professed all-time good-guy Paul           t
Keating has expressed his concern about the plight of the wet in              h
today's society. "Shelter for the soggy should be a priority", he said.       e
He attacked an Opposition policy cutting back on umbrellas for the wet,       s
a programme introduced by the Government on a rather showery April day        e
last year. The Government also criticised the Opposition policy on
optometry, accusing it of being short-sighted.                                s
                                                                              i

Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Caulfield                 w
Racecourse for the Identical Horse Names Handicap Stakes. By chance,          a
the six horses picked for this race today have all managed to have the        y
same name - "Papillon". So, I can promise you this: it's going to be a        s
helluva confusing race today. A quick run-down of the odds as the
horses move into the starting enclosure.. Papillon is favourite at 2-1,       m
then Papillon 7-2, Papillon 5-1, Papillon and Papillon 10-1, and              e
finally the outsider, Papillon, at 100-1. Well, the horses are all            s
ready, and I'm assured that the Jockeys know which one is which... So         s
as the green light goes on and we get ready for the Identical Horse           a
Names Handicap Stakes, I've just got time to say that the author thinks       g
we've milked this joke dry and it's time for the next item.                   e

A couple of weeks ago I was clearing out the cupboard and I decided           r
that I just never was the right person to own a 70 in 1 electronic            e
project kit. It's something I got as a kid, but to my lasting
disappointment, I never discovered just how to electrocute my sister          d
with it. More to the point, the vast majority of the 70 projects were         e
never completed. There's only so many wires you can push into little          s
sockets before you get bored with the whole thing and go and decide to        i
climb a tree. Must be race memory or something. Not that I really was         g
the outdoor type. My life outdoors was for the most part just an              n
unavoidable part of being between different places that were indoors.         e
    Then I got... ROLLERSKATES! Of course, it took a few weeks to learn       d
how to skate on them properly, and many months after that for the scars
to heal, but it did seem, at first glance, the perfect way to get             t
around. You could roll down to the milkbar for some sweets, almost but        o
not quite roll under a truck crossing the road, roll back, dropping
most of what you'd bought on the ground, and eventually skid to a             o
cat-terrifying halt outside the front gate. Which, if it was jammed,          v
you just *could not* open with rollerskates on. You'd be pushing on it,       e
but moving nowhere. Eventually, of course, as will all things, you'd          r
grow out of them. Physically if not mentally. I see rollerblades are          c
"in" now. It just goes to show, there's nothing to compare with putting       o
your skates on and rolling uncontrollably down hills knocking over old        m
ladies.                                                                       e

Days. Now, I never had any kids (Fred's a bit of a let-down in that           s
department) but as I remember it, school days were far from the best          s
days of my life. More like the average to worse days, some of them.
Mind you, I can't complain.. school taught me that the best things in         d
life are expensive. And that's something I'll never be able to forget,        i
or afford.                                                                    v
    Anyway, there's only so many hours in a day. Around about twenty-         i
four, to be precise. I wonder who made up how we measure time. Probably       s
someone related to this bloke Ivor M Perial, who thought up feet and          i
inches and stuff. I bet he was pissed at the time. Why should there be        o
twenty-four hours in a day? Or why not? I suppose by now we're stuck          n
with it.                                                                      s
    Ever noticed how stupid Porsches look from the back? That's nothing
to do with the topic, just an observation. I sometimes wonder if              i
anybody would buy a Porsche if they had seen the back of it. At the           n
front, it's the super-cool, mega-stud, snobby-git, I'm-a-rich-bastard-
with-an-expensive-car image. Just like the Volvo I'm-a-complete-prat          s
image. Meanwhile at the back of the Porsche, phhht.                           o
    Of course, exhaust pipes are always on the back of cars. That's the       c
one feature of a car that you'll never see on a tv commercial,                i
actually. And it's quite fitting that the exhaust is at the back...           e
because car pollution is like a fart. Everyone knows it happens, even         t
if they don't like it, but they ignore it, pretend it isn't theirs, and       y
hope it will go away.                                                         .
