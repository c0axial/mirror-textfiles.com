COUNTRY NEWS:
    The RSPCA was called to an incident on a dairy-farm  near Bendigo over
    the weekend. Apparently due to last week's Victorian milk-strike, many
    cows on the farm have not been milked since early last week. When cows
    are not milked, the milk builds up inside them and they  expand, until
    the inevitable happens - they explode.
            This  is  apparently quite a site to behold, and TV news crews
    rushed north over  the  weekend  to  see  if  they  could  film  a cow
    exploding for their evening news services.

EDITORIAL
Hello. This is the author here. Now, you may think that you are reading this on
or about the 15th of October 1990, but I have a horrible secret to reveal. This
file  is  NOT LIVE! Yes, I'm afraid that the Toxic Custard Workshop  Files  are
TYPED several weeks  in  advance.  In fact, it is 9:36pm Aust EST on Friday the
28th of September! So, you're thinking, that's why he didn't rave about who won
the AFL Grand Final, or how  Saddam  Hussein tongue-kissed George Bush at their
summit meeting. Oh? They didn't have a meeting?  Oh,  I must have dreamed that.
Right. Well, now my conscience is relaxed (despite my imagination  being  round
the  twist),  on with the funny bits. Stuff it, I'm not in a funny mood tonight
(two  and a half weeks ago.) Why not recycle some old stuff (again). Naaah. Now
that would be really dishonest. But why stop now? Tell you what, how about some
new stuff on an old (mid '70s) theme?



AND NOW A SPECIAL APPEAL FOR DONATIONS.

It is a sad fact in today's world that a frightening number of male  university
lecturers  dress unfashionably. For example, we surveyed a random sample of 153
male lecturers.
    27% had long shirt collars
    5% wore flares
    32% said that they always wore brown
    46% admitted to wearing skivvies more than three days per week
    29% had beards but no moustaches

When asked when they last purchased clothing
    11% hadn't this year
    22% hadn't in the last two years
    35% hadn't in the last five years
    16% couldn't remember

But perhaps the most frightening statistic of all was the trouser department.
    87% were wearing corduroy trousers, 76% of which were brown

This  is  a  deplorable  situation, which can only be solved  by  donations  of
clothing,  money  and fashion magazines.  THESE  PEOPLE  NEED  YOUR  HELP  NOW!


                               And remember:
                      "Jumpers are clothing's way of
                       telling you to pull over...."

        THE PROCEEDS OF THE FOLLOWING COMMERCIAL SPACE HAVE BEEN DONATED
          TO THE "LECTURERS IN NEED OF A CLOTHING TRANSPLANT" APPEAL.

Wasn't really very  funny  at  all, was it? No. Fair enough. Maybe when I write
the next episode I'll think of  something  funnier.  THAT'S  RIGHT  FOLKS,  NEW
IMPROVED TOXIC CUSTARD 17 OUT ON 17TH OCTOBER.

           Hello, good  evening,  and  welcome  to the seventeenth of
           October.  And  it  looks  like  being   one  of  the  best
           seventeenths of October for some years.  Our  experts have
           been  checking  the  records, and if their indications are
           anything to go by,  this could be the greatest seventeenth
           of  October since that memorable  `October  Seventeen'  in
           1957. Even  the  great 17/10/63 will pale in comparison to
           today. The Guiness book  of records section of October the
           seventeenths lists ten classics, and from the looks of it,
           this will rank among the top three.

           So, to celebrate what must certainly be the finest October
           17th in at least a decade, the first joke of episode 17 of
           THE TOXIC CUSTARD WORKSHOP FILES  will be in STEREO (where
           available).

      Well, so much for  the  test  stereo  transmission, now back to the
      ummm..  jokes.  The following letter was written by  a  reader  who
      wishes to remain anonymous.

      "You know, people  often tell me how lucky I am, being God. But you
      know, being a deity  isn't all it's cracked up to be. For instance,
      the hours are terribly long,  and  if  you  make  one  wrong  move,
      millions  of  people whinge for months afterwards. Take that Salman
      Rushdie thing.

      Now,  three days  after  `The  Satanic  Verses'  came  out,  I  was
      intending to  blast  him  with a lightening bolt, just for a bit of
      fun, and to make the  Christians panic. But whammo, I missed (had a
      bit too much holy water that  night), and hit a chemical factory in
      Altona, Melbourne instead. Terrible mess. The Muslims were furious.
      Nobody in Melbourne minded though. Par for the course apparently.

      Anyway, the conditions are awful. Ever tried answering prayers from
      four million people at once? It got a bit easier when the answering
      machine was installed, but with population growth  being  so  high,
      soon  I'll  need  a  whole switchboard. And the pay is atrocious. I
      haven't had a wage rise  since  4000BC!  And  there's  no chance of
      promotion.  I've  reached  the  top  of  the  heap,  you might say.    
      Still, I s'pose it could be worse. At least  I've  got  my American
      Express Gold Card now. And everybody knows my name..."

He jests at scars that never felt a wound.

But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?

WHAT?

It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.

WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon

IT'S THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT!

Who is already sick and pale with grief

WILL YOU PISS OFF - WE'RE TRYING TO SLEEP

That thou, her maid, art far more fair than she

I'M WARNING YOU, IF YOU DON'T SHUT UP...

Be not her maid, since she is envious.

I'M GONNA COME DOWN THERE, AND SMASH YOUR BLOODY FACE IN

Her vestal livery is but sick and green

WILL YOU PUT A BLOODY SOCK IN IT?

And none but fools do wear it: cast it off

I'M GOING TO CAST YOU RIGHT OFF THIS BALCONY IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL

It is my lady, O it is my love

LOOK, ONE MORE STANZA OUT OF YOU AND I'LL CALL THE POLICE

O that she knew she were

HELLO, POLICE?

She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?

THERE'S THIS BLOKE OUTSIDE

Her eye discourses: I will answer it.

HE'S BABBLING ABOUT SOMETHING OR OTHER... SOME GIRL HE GOT INTO TROUBLE

I am too bold: 'tis not to me she speaks.

PROBABLY A STUDENT - YES... HIGH AS A KITE NO DOUBT, OR DRUNK LIKE THEY ALL ARE

Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,

WELL, HE'S GOING ON ABOUT STARS IN THE HEAVENS OR SOMETHING

Having some business, do entreat her eyes

THANK YOU OFFICER.

To twinkle in their spheres till they return.

RIGHT! THE POLICE ARE COMING. NOW WILL YOU SHUT UP?

What if her eyes were there, they in her head?

SHUT THE F*** UP!

The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars

OH GOOD. HERE THEY COME.

As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven

RIGHT, WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE PROBLEM

Would through the airy region stream so bright

WOULD YOU MIND KEEPING THE NOISE DOWN, SIR?

That birds would sing and think it were not night

WELL I'M AFRAID IT IS NIGHT SIR, SO COULD YOU BE A BIT QUIETER?

See how she leans her cheek upon her hand!

OR I SHALL HAVE TO ASK YOU TO ACCOMPANY ME TO THE STATION

O that I were a glove upon that hand,

RIGHT SONNY, THAT'S ABOUT ENOUGH OF THAT

That I might touch that cheek

YOU'RE UNDER ARREST FOR A BREACH OF THE PEACE

Let go of me arm, pig!

Heavy-metal band Megabogue are being sued for allegedly having subliminal
messages in their latest hit "Why Don't U Come And Suk On My Torpedo Of Love,
Baby?" from the forthcoming "Abbey Bogue" album. When played normally even the
lyrics are completely incomprehensible.
    But former Megabogue fan the Reverend Skilbey claims that when the record
is played backwards at a speed of 58rpm precisely, the following sinister
messages can be heard:
      "God sucks and the devil is a really cool dude."
      "Send all your money to PO Box 463, GPO Jamaica now!"
      "You're a real f***head - I reckon you should go and kill yourself
          right now!"
