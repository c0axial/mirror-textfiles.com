VX24 USERS' BULLETIN   Number 12 - 1/10/90
------------------------------------------
SUBJECT: New Vax Command
  DEC have written a new program to  make VMS error messages more readable. The
new code, called TRANSLATE, translates the error message into simple English to
aid with debugging and general use of DCL.
  To make use of this new facility, the following command is used:
           SET TRANSLATE /MODE=(type)
  Where "type"  is  the  type  of error message you would like. Valid types are
detailed below, with examples.
  As an example, suppose while copying a file, an error occurs-:
           %COPY-E-INPFNOTFND, Input file not found
  The TRANSLATE utility will change this  message to make it easier to read, in
the following ways.

VALID TYPES:          SAMPLE OUTPUT:
------------          --------------

   feminist           %COPY-E-INPFNOTFND, That chauvinist pig  VAX  reckons you
                      don't  even  know  the real filename. Try again, and show
                      this male pig computer  that  all  wimmin  can  tell this
                      computer what to do!

   hippy              %COPY-E-INPFNOTFND,  Oh  no!  Oh  heavy  heavy heavy. The
                      bad-vibes-ville uncool VAX can't find the  file!  Oh  no,
                      what are you going to do now?

   anarchist          %COPY-E-INPFNOTFND, Hey! The git VAX can't find the file!
                      Right  on!  Who  needs files for  copying  anyway?  Files
                      represent beauracracy and red tape!  Let's  take  all the
                      files and stuff them up the computer's collective arse!

   medieval           %COPY-E-INPFNOTFND,  The  lord  VAX cannot find thy file,
                      peasant. Thou shall provide  thy  full  path  name again,
                      lest thy head answers for it!

   evangelist         %COPY-E-INPFNOTFND, And yea! God's servant VAX was unable
                      to find your file. But if you believe in the power of God
                      evil Satan's forces SHALL put the file back. Donate $3000
                      to SYSTEM, get down on your knees, and try again.

   suicidal           %COPY-E-INPFNOTFND, Input file not found. That's it, that
                      command  was  your  life. Now go and kill  yourself.  But
                      remember to log out first.

   bogan              %COPY-E-INPFNOTFND,  F***ing  hell,  c***!   That  stupid
                      mother-f***er of a VAX says  it couldn't find the f***ing
                      file! Maybe it wasn't really called F***ER.TXT;2

   pirate             %COPY-E-INPFNOTFND, Required filename not  found. So what
                      the heck, I'll copy the whole directory!

   psychologist       %COPY-E-INPFNOTFND,  The  computer's  very inner soul has
                      rejected  the  concept of 'files' due to a bad experience
                      when  the  OS was a lower version number. All influenced,
                      of  course,  by   the   system  manager's  severe  sexual
                      problems.

   python-fan         %COPY-E-INPFNOTFND, The file  cannot  be  found! It's NOT
                      pining  -  it's  passed  on! This file is no more! It has
                      ceased to be! It's expired, and gone  to meet it's maker!
                      This is a late file! It's not there! This is an EX-FILE!

   management         %COPY-E-INPFNOTFND, The VAX has initiated a CPU committee
                      meeting  to  determine  whether or not this file  can  be
                      found. DCL will report the results in four weeks.

   jargon             %COPY-E-INPFNOTFND, The total number of  files  retrieved
                      that are equivalent to the parameter  specified  in  your
                      previous command is zero!

   system-manager     %COPY-E-INPFNOTFND,  Input file not found. Now get really
                      angry and  take  it  out  on the poor pathetic grovelling
                      little users.

   politician         %COPY-E-INPFFND,  Input  file found. There have  been  no
                      errors that I am aware of. None at all.

steps.

   THE  WORLD'S  LEAST  KNOWN  AND  LEAST  LOVED  HEAVY  METAL  BAND.

Weeze at  Megabogue  are  comin  up wiv a new all bum, called "Abbey Bogue". So
weeze all had a groop confa  rence,  an  Slasher  (the  intellectal of the ban)
decided  we  shud do sum more sons, and shud send along  some  fotoes  for  the
allbum cova.
        Followin is a brief intro and summmary of the memers of the ban-:
        SLASHER RISTS -  the  intellectual  of the ban (heese got an IQ of over
50) - and the drummer (that's puttin all his intelectt too good use.)
        BONK MEE - poet and lyriciss of the ban. Sum of his proze appars in dis
letter, witch only gose to demonsate  his  abilitee. He plays base (because its
only got 4 strings) and shouts allot.
        HARRY  "HEADBANGER"  WALL  -  Ace  leed guitarist with  Megabogue.  His
alltime guitar influences are: John Bonham,  Keith  Moon,  Charlie  Watts,  and
Ringo Starr. He allso rights sum of the lovely wistfulll, lilting melodys, such
as that haunting ballad "Why don't u come and suk on my torpedo of love, baby?"
        VIMMY  "THE THORN" HALEN - Skilful rithm guitariss of Megabogue, whoose
rithms have  been  likened  to  that of a Jak-hammor. Wunce wanted to be Anguss
Yung but didnt hab the necesery  skil,  and  besides,  heed burnt his old skool
uniform.

        Megabogue's  lilting  melodies  portray  their iconoclastic view on the
current state of society and  humanity's  place  within.  Their  meaningful and
surrealistic  lyrics  bypass the usual conventional restrictions of rhyming and
portraying obseletist ideals of melodic structure.
                                                      (RIP ORF-SEVERELY)
                                    (Our manager rote that, but we don't
                             like it, cos we dont understaand it, but we
                                           don't wont to effend anyone).

MEGABOGUE'S NEW ALBUM, "ABBEY BOGUE", IS ON THE "LABEL" LABEL.

NOW, HERE ARE  THE  WORDS  TO  THE MEGABOGUE HIT SONG, THE HAUNTING BALLAD "WHY
DON'T U COME AND SUK ON MY  TORPEDO  OF  LOVE,  BABY?"  BE  WARNED,  THIS  WILL
PROBABLY DISGUST YOU.

VERSE 1:
  Arggggh
  I am like a submarine
  'Cos I got a f***in' huge torpedo
  I am like a submarine
  'Cos I got a f***in' huge torpedo

CHORUS:
  Why don't you, why don't you, why don't you
  Come and suk, come and suk, come and suk
  On my torpedo ... torpedo ... torpedo
  Of love, baby?

VERSE 2:
  I am a submarine
  And you are an enemy ship
  'cos the f***in' torpedo's going right in ya
  And you're gonna explode

CHORUS

Well,  if we have any readers left after that completely and utterly disgusting
display of  text,  part  fourteen  will  be  out  on  Monday  8th  of  October.

APOLOGY:
We really must apologise for the publication of the lyrics  above,  but  if the
only way to encourage reader feedback is to disgust them,  then so  be it.   So
you'd better send complaints now, to tcwf@gnu.ai.mit.edu

Let us pray.

THIS WEEK'S READING IS FROM THE BOOK OF TOXIC, CHAPTER 14.

1 The holy users of the Lord Vax did loggeth on. And they did see the horror of
the  monstrosity that had appeared in their directories. Yea, it was fourteenth
part of the holy Toxic Custard Workshop Files. TOXIC 14:1

2 And the users did despair, for their directory quotas had filled up with this
crap. For  most of them were lowly first-years, and had but five hundred of the
blocks. TOXIC 14:2

3 And the  second  years  did laugh, for they did know, not that they wanted to
crow about it or anything, that they had seven thousand of the blocks available
to them. TOXIC 14:3

4 But they did despair, when  they  checked their budgets, and did findeth that
all the hooning around on News and with  Mail had diminished the holy figure of
logtime. TOXIC 14:4

5 Meanwhile, the author of the holy book of  Toxic did weep, for he had run out
of jokes, and had to resort to Biblical scripture once more. TOXIC 14:5

6 And yea! He did racketh his brains for new  and  funny  ideas.  But he didn't
come up with any, so he resorted to...    TOXIC 14:6

The party  made  their  way  slowly  down  the corridor. Leading was Raftor the
Brave,  followed closely by Roder the dwarf. Bringing  up  the  rear  were  the
wizard Pyhus and Felonius, the group's thief. They came to a door, which marked
the end of the corridor. Raftor tried the door; it was locked. Felonius got out
his tools  and went to work on the door, while Roder and Pyhus kept a look out.
Signalling that the  door was now unlocked, Felonius nodded. Raftor kicked down
the door and burst  into  the  room with sword at the ready, the others closely
following.
    From the light given off by the wizard's magic lantern, Raftor made out the
shapes of five goblins with daggers at the ready, attacking.
    Suddenly, a booming voice said "Roll for  initiative!"  and  two giant dice
came tumbling down squashing Felonius and two goblins. The party of adventurers
had gained initiative, and Raftor attacked first. A huge twenty-sided  die came
crashing  down in the corner flattening the remaining goblins. As the remainder
of the  party  gathered around the crumpled body of the fallen thief, two giant
hands descended, and grabbed  the  huge  dice. The booming voice spoke out once
more: "That's enough for this session. See you all on Wednesday."


AND NOW FOR THE NAZI-NEWS WEATHER FORECAST FOR MONDAY THE EIGHTH OF OCTOBER.
Seig  heil!  And  now,  here is your racially pure forecast for superior German
areas  of  occupation!  In  the   concentration-camps,   there  will  be  heavy
anti-semitism, with many executions in  the later part of the afternoon. On the
Eastern front, there will anti-Russian feeling amongst the troops, blowing over
to heavy bayonetting tomorrow. Around Dresden,  there  will  be  heavy falls of
schweinhund Allied bombs most of the day. And finally, here  in  inner  Berlin,
the  anger of the Fuhrer will rise, with a low tonight of frustrated murmurs up
to a high tomorrow of carpet digestion.


Raftor the Brave went on to change his name  to  Roger  the Sexist, and star in
ROCKET  ROGER,  available  now  for  only  four-hundred  million  dollars  from
rocketroger@gnu.ai.mit.edu. Hey, that makes it cheaper than a complete D&D set!

                   AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE:
                   We regret to announce that God  ran out of
                   money last Saturday, and that due to this,
                   all non-essential services will close-down
                   from   midnight  Thursday  Morning.  These
                   include  your  local sun; which means that
                   all life on  Earth  will  cease  to exist.
                   Although a resolution for extra funding is
                   being  worked  out, no guarantee that life
                   will continue can be made.

                       AMPUTATION FOR MEGABOGUE DRUMMER!
     Ace  Megabogue  drummer  Slasher  Rists was injured last night in a 95 car
pile up, which left him  in serious condition in hospital. Doctors this morning
were forced to amputate his legs and arms.
     A spokesman has said that Slasher  will  be  continuing with the band. "He
will bang the drums with his head, and other appendages", he said.
     Megabogue guitarist Bonk Mee commented on the situation. "Yeah,  we  don't
mind  him continuing to bang... if he uses his head, it only enhances our image
as a bunch of headbangers."
     Vimmy Halen,  the  artistic member of the group would not comment, and all
Harry Wall would say  to  waiting  reporters  was  "Why don't you all just f***
off", before assaulting three photographers and a TV news  crew  with a kitchen
knife and an armoured-car.


--M-E-G-A-B-O-G-U-E--------F-E-A-T-U-R-E---------------------------------------
HERE FOLLOWS AN EDITED TRANSCRIPT OF DIALOGUE AT A MEGABOGUE REHEARSAL SESSION.
MEGABOGUE, LIKE MOST HEAVY-METAL BANDS HAVE VERY LOW IQs, WEAR EXTREMELY STUPID
TROUSERS,  AND  SWEAR  A LOT. ANYONE WHO WANTS THE UNEXPURGATED VERSION FILL IN
THE *'S YOURSELF.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<The scene: a field with fairly large loudspeakers>
    BONK: What I want to know is, what the f*** are we doin' here?
    VIMMY: Yeah!
    SLASHER: Well, what the f***'s it look like, c***?
     [Bonk and Vimmy look around at the speakers and guitars slowly.]
    BONK: No f***in' idea.
    VIMMY: Dunno.
    HARRY: We're f***in' here to play a f***in' song, c***!
     [Bonk looks around him again.]
    BONK: You f***in' sure?
    SLASHER: Yeah, we f***in' are!
    BONK: Why?
    HARRY: 'Cos we're a f***in' rock band, aren't we!
    BONK: (incredulous) Are we?
    SLASHER: Oh shit, let's just f***in' play.
    BONK: Oh okay.
     [Bonk rushes over, grabs a guitar and starts violently playing (bogan
     style). But the amplifiers aren't on, and no sound comes out. He looks
     puzzled, but the rest of the band get their instruments and turn on
     the amps.]
    HARRY: Do we need to tune up? Nah - we did that last week. Right, yer
f***in' ready? 4 3 2 1
     [As soon as the first note is struck, both speakers explode. When the
     smoke clears, all four band members are left on the ground.]
    VIMMY: F***in' hell. Power chords, man.
    HARRY: Yeah. F***in' heavy metal mass destruction!
    BONK: How the f*** are we gonna play with no speakers?
    SLASHER: Dunno, but at least we don't need no more f***in' roadies.
