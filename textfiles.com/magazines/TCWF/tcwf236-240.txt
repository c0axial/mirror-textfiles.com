Yes hello, this is the personality shop, isn't it?

    WHY YES SIR IT IS. CAN I HELP YOU?

Oh yes please. Glad to make your acquaintance. There are a number of
things that I would wish to purchase from your establishment. I'll
just inspect the list that I so thoughtfully prepared prior to
arriving at this location. Let's see. Ah yes. I'd like an ounce of
pity, and a pang of guilt, please.

    I'M TERRIBLY SORRY SIR, WE'RE ALL OUT OF GUILT. CAN I OFFER YOU
    SOME FEAR INSTEAD?

No thank you, I'm afraid I'm up to here with fear. Would you have any
anger instead?

    NO, BUT WE PROBABLY HAVE SOME IGNORANCE.

...Umm, I don't know what that is.

    WON'T BE NEEDING THAT THEN. WHAT ABOUT SOME PREMONITION?

Ah yes, I could do with some of that. I don't know why I didn't
realise sooner. I'll tell you why I need it, too. I can't see where
the author is going with this.

    ME NEITHER. I GET THE FEELING IT CAME OUT OF A COUPLE OF
    ONE-LINERS ABOUT OUNCES AND PANGS, AND HE'S TRIED TO SPREAD SOME
    VERY BASIC JOKES OVER THE SPACE OF A FEW PARAGRAPHS

Exactly, and now he's run out of ideas, so he's getting the
characters to rebel out of the joke and discuss the merits of the
writing. Well it don't wash. I'm leaving.

    ME TOO. HE REALLY SHOULD STICK TO HIS USUAL INANE DRIVEL.

Have you ever considered the advantages that being clinically insane
can bring? People who are quite mad, and look it, never get asked in
the street for money. Nobody ever asks them to go and get a
newspaper. (Nah... he's MAD mate; he'd probably nut the newsagent and
eat the newspaper on the way back).

Yes, insanity is the KEY to avoiding your responsibilities.

    I SAID INANE, NOT INSANE. JUST DO THE HISTORY. THAT'LL KEEP YOU
    OUT OF TROUBLE.

                      TOXIC HISTORY OF THE WORLD
                    Part 32. When will it all end?

1526 AD
  Babar, Moslem warrior king, captures Delhi. He is helped by
  confusion amongst the defending army, who are mistakenly told that
  the barber had arrived to give everyone a quick trim.

1528
  Conquest of Peru. Ummm... by... someone. Not sure who. Does it
  really matter? Probably not, after all, it was a *terribly* long
  time ago.

1529
  The Ottoman Sultan, Suleiman the Magnificent, having taken
  Belgrade, the island of Rhodes and Budapest, attempts to storm
  Vienna but is beaten back.
      Suleiman the Magnificent, eh? I wonder who thought up that
  name? From all accounts, his enemies called him Suleiman the
  Smelly-Trousers. My money would be on Suleiman's own campaign
  directors.
      <Insert Cockney accents and cheap suits here>
      "Ullo Bob."
      "Ullo Phil. What are we gonna call Suleiman during this coming
  invasion of Vienna then?"
      "Well Bob, since he's already invaded Rhodes and Budapest, what
  say we go for Magnificent?"
      "Phil, I've said it before, I'll say it again - You are a
  genius my son."

1529-1542
  Henry VIII gets through more wives than you've had hot dinners.
  Including Jane Seymour. Wow. I didn't know she was *that* old.

1534-1536
  Jacques Cartier discovers Canada, and tries to sell the locals a
  rather nice line in wrist-watches.

1553
  Queen Mary persecutes English Protestants, and becomes known as
  Vodka And Tonic. Oops, I mean Bloody Mary.

1557-1580
  Sir Francis Drake sails around the world in the "Golden
  Hindquarters", a ship named after his favourite sailor. What can I
  say. You've got to loooove the Drake. One for the Seinfeld fans
  there.

1558-1568
  Elizabeth (the first one, not the one we have now) succeeds Mary
  and works out a compromise between the Catholics and Protestants.
  Then, to show she's not all sweetness and light, she imprisons Mary
  Queen of Scots by tricking her into thinking the Tower Of London is
  a tourist attraction.

1571
  Fleet of the Christian League, led by Spain, defeats the Turkish
  fleet at Lepanto and destroys Moslem sea power in the
  Mediterranean. Yes! The Christian League! Temporarily modifying the
  sixth commandment to read "Thou shalt not kill except for Moslems,
  whom thou shalt smite and sit upon and shove red hot pokers into".
  Well, something like that, anyway.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

You know what I think? I think that cameramen must be the saddest
group of people on the planet. Otherwise, how would they film
concerts or comedy without grooving to the music or laughing their
heads off, and subsequently wobbling the camera?

  *   *      * * *   ****   Written by Daniel Bowen
  *    ***    * *    *      With some help this week from Brian Smith

Archaeologists have recently found evidence of direct marketing in
the Neolithic period. Found on a cave wall were markings that have
been translated as:
           "Dear Mr Og. You may have already won five mammoth steaks"

An excerpt from "The Really Complete Beatles Recording Sessions"

16th February 1967. Studio 2, 8pm-4am.

"Ganja Fields Forever" (takes 1-3), "Lizards Are Crawling Up The
Wall" (takes 1-7), "Pus" (takes 6-9), "When I'm Sixty Four" (takes
1-2)

A week after the session when they couldn't get into Abbey Road
(imagine the poor bastard who had to tell them that the studio was
booked by Ralph Atherton and his Singing Weasels), the Beatles try
out some songs that were eventually left out of Sgt Pepper's Lonely
Hearts Club Band. These include John Lennon's possibly drug-
influenced songs "Ganja Fields Forever", "Lizards Are Crawling Up The
Wall" and "Pus".

Also recorded was an early version of "When I'm Sixty Four", in which
Paul McCartney tries to predict his future:

    When I get older, losing my hair
    Many years from now
    Will I still be touring with these three twerps
    Knocking back pills with a pint of turps

    If I'd released a bad cover song
    Would I end up poor
    Will I be chased by grandmother groupies
    When I'm sixty-four

    Fans'll be older too
    And if they say the word
    I could sing Hey Jude

    I could get married, find an Eastman
    How about Linda
    You can write a vegetarian cookbook
    Sunday morning go for a steak

    Touring Australia, jailed in Japan
    Who could ask for more
    Will you remember, will you buy tickets
    When I'm sixty-four

An excerpt from "The Complete Toxic Custard Writing Sessions"

12th May 1991. Bedroom, 8pm-10pm.

FFF joke (takes 1-17), Fart joke overdub, MacBeth (takes 1-9)

Another Sunday night session. Editing of TCWF 48 continued. A fart
joke was overdubbed to bring the underlying incontinence gag to the
fore. Several takes of the Macbeth spoof destined to appear in TCWF
50 were attempted. It is to be the last great Shakespeare spoof for
some time. The final released version was a combination of takes 5
and 7, with Inspector Unnecessary-Violence's lines overdubbed on the
15th of May, by an unknown session writer.

Watching the news brings into existence the idea for one of the most
controversial jokes in Toxic Custard's history. Though denied by
Bowen, the Fascist Fuckwit's Federation is later attacked on UseNet
as being racist. TCWF fans rally behind it, pointing to the blatantly
anti-racist message. It is said that Bowen is making a comparison
between the KKK and the FFF, although some of the original drafts of
this joke show that the KKK was not the inspiration.

A claim that by reading signature of TCWF 48 backwards you can read
"We'll fuck you like supermen" is later proven not to be true,
although an allegation about Satanic messages in TCWF 66 was
justified.

Did you ever go through that phase when you were a kid that you
thought your mother might be some kind of supernatural being? Because
she always seemed to know what you'd been up to...

Why do we go up to the shop, and buy a loaf of bread, which is in
plastic... and then get a plastic bag to put it inside to carry it
home? Are we at risk from supergerms that can penetrate a mere one
layer of plastic? Or is the grip on the bread bag so inadequate that
we'll drop it perilously down a drain on the way home? The public
have a right to know.

                     Part 33.  A very short Part.

1585
  Holland, losing to Spain at home, are relieved when an army of
  English hooligans, on a day-trip to check out seedy Amsterdam,
  decide spontaneously to have a quick game of "throw clogs at the
  Spaniards". The combined England/Holland team win 3-1. The Police
  later pick-up three of the English after examining paintings of the
  scene drawn by Michaelangelo while he's on holiday.

1587
  Queen Elizabeth decides to execute Mary Queen of Scots after Mary
  reminds her of that time that Elizabeth couldn't get a date for the
  Prom, and called her baldy.

1588
  Philip of Spain sends a Great Armada against England. When the news
  is incorrectly passed to English captain Francis Drake as being an
  invading "great armadillo", he decides to finish his game of
  tiddlywinks before fighting.

Aww shit, I can't be bothered with any more this week.

"Tropical Cyclone Custard"

*****  /   \\         // ||
  *   <     \\  //\  //  ||==|    Toxic Custard Workshop Files

Right. Hello. This bit is true. I was watching the news on Friday,
and the story about Tropical Cyclone Bobby hitting the Western
Australian coast came on. And as usual, they mentioned those "brave"
(read stupid) people who had decided not to evacuate, but to risk
staying with their homes. And possibly evacuating later. In boxes.

Normally, these people are the old idiots who have "lived all my life
here, and no tropical death blood volcano barbed-wire bastard cyclone
is going to frighten me!" They usually don't mention that in the last
50 years of living at that location, the worst thing nature has
thrown at them has been an irritable blow-fly, and that big spider in
the dunny in 1953.

This time, it wasn't them. It *sounded* like it was. But no - the
footage gave it away. Instead of Bill Fuckingmoron, 68 years old, it
was a picture of two men, pissed as newts, with bottles in their
hands, rolling around on a bench!

"Come on mate, you can't stay here"

    "Nah fuck off, fuckin' copper, we're fuckin' stayin' here with
    our beer. No fuckin' cyclone is gonna get us!"

    "Yeah, leave us alone or we'll thump ya."

"Oh yeah, what the hell. Have a nice time! Here's some aspirin for
tomorrow morning when you wake-up with a hangover and realise what
deep shit you're in. If not from the cyclone, from your parents when
they see you on the telly."

Fun run. Fun run. Fun run.

I've come to a conclusion about fun runs. The actual fun occurs
before, and after, but not usually during, the run. The run itself
generally involves counting the kilometres go by agonisingly slowly
while the hot sun beats down. Even more agonisingly slowly if the fun
run is actually a fun walk. The consolation is that there's less
actual strenuous effort.

It all begins with one of those harmless looking coupons you pick up
or see in the newspaper, send in, and safely forget about until the
sticker, map and sheet of instructions turns up in the mail. The
actual day arrives (why are these things always, but always, on
Sunday mornings?) and you try to be energetic enough to get there
early to get the free breakfast. (Which, if you miss, you'll be
swearing about for the next four hours, because you deliberately
elected *not* to have breakfast at home).

And so, you arrive at the designated venue, generally a park. Just
you, and fifteen thousand others, all queuing up for twenty minutes
just to get your yoghurt and piece of fruit. And just as you're about
to think "call this breakfast?" you spot the other stall, with the
free breakfast cereal. And no queue. As Homer would say, "D'oh!" If
all goes well, you'll manage to scoff that all down and grab all your
other freebies before the warm up begins.

There are many wondrous and magnificent sights in the world. The
pyramids of Egypt, the Eiffel Tower, Mrs Rashomon's Laundromat. While
these have the historical significance, there is an equal amount of
appeal in seeing fifteen thousand people doing early morning aerobics
in the park. It just looks so surreal.

(While we were waiting in the park on Sunday for the Rev walk, I
observed an interesting phenomenon. It is the sound made by thousands
of humans when they hear or see another human having something happen
to them that makes the thousands very glad they are not the one. If
you see what I mean. Close your eyes, and try to imagine hearing
this, as I did: <Car horn Honk honk> <screeeeeech> <bangsmash!>
<sound of 15,000 people going ooooooh...> That ooooooh is a sound of
sympathy for that one person's next insurance premium. Reminds me of
the time I was at a large computer site, and the lights dipped, and
all the computers reset. Cue the sound of 700 people going ooooooh,
each feeling sorry for the poor sod who pressed the wrong button that
did it. And being glad it wasn't them.)

And so, around 9:30, fifteen thousand people, all with stickers or
tags denoting that they are one of the fifteen thousand, try to begin
running/walking/rollerblading/cycling/wheelchairing the x kilometres
of the course. The chaotic start gives way to the closed-off roads,
the woefully few drink stops, and above all, the searing sun beating
down on thousands of people all trying to remember if they slipped
(on a t-shirt), slopped (on some sunscreen) and slapped (on a hat).
"Or did I just slip and slap? Did I slop? And if I slopped, did I
slop enough?"

It all gets rather tiring after the first hour or so. Every toilet
block you pass, there's dozens of people queuing. Every signpost with
spot prize numbers, there's hundreds of people milling around trying
to see if they won anything. But there's consolations. Like the look
of despair on the faces of the car drivers at every intersection you
pass, because they know they're going to be stuck there for at least
another twenty minutes before the police find a suitable gap in the
crowd to let them through. The police themselves look happy, because
they'd rather be directing 15,000 fun runners than 15,000 rioting
demonstrators (or our closest local equivalent here in Kennett
County, Grand Prix demonstrators).

So a couple of hours later, you cross the finish line, go get a
drink, listen to the band, listen for any prizes you might have won
(nope), and finally leave, wishing you'd just gone down the river
path, or jogged around the park that morning instead. But then, you
wouldn't have got a free cap.

                      TOXIC HISTORY OF THE WORLD
                               Part 34.

1606 AD
  William Janszoon is walking home one day, trips over a piece of
  lead piping in the ground, and discovers Australia. It turns out to
  be such a wide, sprawling brown land that he writes an article in
  his favourite Explorer's Journal entitled "The Wide, Sprawling
  Brown Land Down Under". Janszoon realises the tourist potential of
  the place, and hires a fellow Dutchman, Paul Hogensom, to try and
  advertise it. The campaign is scuttled when Hogensom leaves his
  wife and marries a bimbo he has met on his travels. When asked
  about this, he compares the two, saying "Nah, that's not a wife....
  Now *that's* a wife!"

1609
  Holland frees herself from Spain, and is soon to be a great power,
  leading the world in trade, art and science and founding an empire
  in East and West Indies. So, looking back almost four centuries
  later, one has to ask - What happened?

1618
  Outbreak of the Thirty Years' War, last attempt of the Catholics to
  stamp out the Reformation in Europe. Okay, it leaves me wondering.
  Did they call it the Thirty Years' War *during* the war? And if so,
  was it all planned in advance? "Okay, you guys, now we've only got
  until 1648 to fit this all in. Seventy great battles, nine
  overthrown kingdoms, ten national leaders executed..."

1620
  Pilgrim Fathers decide they're sick of hanging around Plymouth, and
  sail in the Mayflower to found the first colony in New England.
  Yep, I can see the passport now.
       Name: John Smith.
       Occupation: Pilgrim.

1642
  Abel Tasman discovers the island just south of the Australian
  mainland. He returns home afterwards to find pandemonium. Screaming
  fans, merchandising, in fact, total Tasmania.

It was another grey, cruel day in the city. I looked through the
sheet of rain as I waited on the corner, a copy of The Daily Grind
under my arm. I'd been on the case for a good five minutes now, but
still couldn't quite see over the wall. I got off it, and walked
around the perimeter, trying to find a way in. Actually, I was more
used to Imperial measurements, but walking around the periyard just
didn't sound quite right.

The laneway was deserted, the only sound the gush of the rain going
into the gutter. I could hear the water droplets shouting "all right!
A holiday in the drains!"

A gate rattled and opened, and a big black car came out, splattering
me with mud as it passed. Huh, joke's on you mister, this is a dead
end street at *both* ends.

I lit a cigarette in a vain hope to look cool, and ducked through the
gate, trying to look inconspicuous. I made a note to get rid of the
duck suit. Inside the wall, the factory looked foreboding and
industrious. Workmen moved two and fro between the doorways,
whispering conspiratorially. One of them approached me. He looked
stupid, but you can never tell. He might not be as stupid as he
looked.

"Who're you", he asked suspiciously. "Health inspector?"

"No", I replied. "They won't promote me past seargant". Damn, I was
meant to be undercover.

"Police?" he said, wide-eyed.

"Ummm no, no. I'm a... umm.. travelling duck costume salesman."

"Oh." So. He was as stupid as he looked.

"You wanna buy any travelling duck costumes? Only a duck. I mean
buck."

"Well yeah, okay. But don't tell the others".

After finishing the transaction and changing back into my normal
clothes, I made my way up some stairs towards the office. The door
was slightly ajar, the healthy aroma of thick cigar smoke wafting
through the gap. Lucky doors don't have lungs.

Also wafting through, in between the molecules of smoke, were a
few of words. Words from that baron of crime, Baron Von Git. I
guessed there'd be someone else in the room, because the Baron didn't
usually talk to himself. In any case, I didn't hang around to hear
any more than two, because I got a sinking feeling they were talking
about me.

"Kill him."

With all the style that only a high school student can muster, I slid
down the bannister. I drew my gun (just a quick sketch), and bolted
to the exit. The exit was bolted too. Damn. Nothing else for it but
to scale the fence. The fence's scale was 1:1, but it didn't look any
higher than it could have been. I started to climb, only pausing to
change direction when I reached the top. Lucky I did, because as I
leapt towards the ground, a shot rang out. It passed over my head,
and would have swung round to hit me, but it couldn't. I decided I no
longer regretted not being a basketball player.

I ran out of the laneway, to the safety of the bustling street. Just
another day for Jake Spam, Public Detective.

                                      Now, where did I put that case?

                               Part 35.

1648
  Someone realises it's time to stop, and so the Thirty Years War
  comes to an end. "I survived the Thirty Years War" tunics are a big
  seller for several weeks afterwards.

1648-1658
  Oliver Cromwell, the man known for banning soft-backed chairs, also
  bans every other fun thing he can think of. Including ice-cream,
  Nintendo, sex, making air bubbles with BluTack, jokes; you name it,
  he bans it.

1664
  War between Britain and Holland; the British capture New Amsterdam,
  and rename it New York. The Dutch laugh heartily, saying the new
  name will never catch on.

1665
  Great Plague of London.

1666
  Great Fire of London. Not such a great decade for London, really.
  The Arson squad are still investigating. Shame the Great Fire
  Brigade didn't respond. Or maybe they didn't have one at the time.

1670-85
  Charles II gets friendly with the Catholics, attacks Holland with
  France, runs out of cash, and eventually dies. Busy guy.

1681
  William Penn establishes the colony of Pennsylvania as refuge,
  where persecuted Quakers can shelter, some of them no doubt quaking
  in fear.

1683
  The Turks make a final effort to carry Islam into the heart of
  Europe, but are defeated at Vietnam. Oops, I mean Vienna. (Okay,
  who gave Ronald Reagan access to this file?)

1701
  Yet another Louis (the XIVth) declares France will take on all
  comers at the coming Euro Bun Fight. Britain, Holland and Austria
  form a "Grand Alliance" to stop him. But they back down when faced
  with an army of French container lorry drivers.

1707
  Following approval from the Monopolies Commission, England and
  Scotland announce a merger. They promise that there will be no
  redundancies, and that profitability of both countries will be
  enhanced.

1714
  George I becomes king. The fact that he can't speak English and has
  no interest in English affairs is not seen to be a problem by the
  English parliament, who take advantage of it by being able to chew
  bubblegum in the house.

1720
  A financial crisis, the "South Sea Bubble", produced by wild
  speculation, ruins thousands. Rumours that the crash was caused by
  a computer error prove untrue, and it is later blamed on some guy
  who has disappeared to Singapore.

This week's issue is a little late, due to a little bit of a moving
house situation, and a certain large telecommunications company being
unable to get our phone working over the weekend. And due to this
throwing my routine out completely so I forgot to be in possession of
vital files at the appropriate time for mailing. Oops.

Moving house is one of those things that no matter how many times we
do it, and how painful it is when it happens, it almost always ends
up happening again at some time. Obviously the memory of traipsing up
and down stairs with boxes fades with time.

The most surprising thing is what's in the heaviest boxes. Lead
weights? No. Medicine balls? No. Books. Books, which are made of
paper. The Olympic committee should seriously consider getting
weightlifters to lift people's boxes full of books at the next Games.

So anyway, first comes about a week of painstakingly packing every
single little thing into a box. (Which is generally accompanied by a
week of pleading with local shopkeepers, who you will most likely
never see ever again, to give you their spare boxes.) Of course,
there are various things that won't go into boxes. And things that
can only go into boxes after being wrapped up with copious amounts of
old newspaper. And various other things that are already in boxes,
but need to go into bigger boxes with other things in boxes to
prevent any of the smaller boxes getting lost along the way. And then
there's boxes that have remained unpacked since the last time you've
moved. Hopefully some of them will get lost along the way.

The morning of the move arrives, and two amiable blokes arrive with
their truck from the company whose ad caught the eye in the Yellow
Pages. Which, if it was one of the first listed, probably has a name
beginning with an abnormal number of "a"s. The guys arrive, and with
no further ado, start piling stuff into the truck.

When we last moved two years ago, we had bugger all. A couple of
computers and a can of Coke. Since then, this situation has changed.
So much that, when it all came down to it, not everything would fit
into the truck. It was a tight squeeze getting the furniture all in,
but eventually just about everything went in, and the truck drove off
to pastures new. (Well, okay, Caulfield).

The two amiable blokes arrive at the new place in the truck, and it
becomes apparent from the amount of swearing going on that they
haven't been told the destination is upstairs. C'est la vie(*). Just
thank Christ it's a larger place, to the extent that it didn't really
matter where all the boxes were left, it was "dump 'em anywhere"
time.

And so, a day, a few car boot shuttle trips, and lots of unpacking
later, everything is almost settled. And as I did a final skim
through the old place to ensure nothing had been forgotten, I found
what almost *had* been forgotten. Of all things, it was two
toothbrushes and a tube of toothpaste. That would have been a nice
surprise for the next tenant/s. I also found a lump of Blutack. What,
leave it for the landlady?! Never!

                      TOXIC HISTORY OF THE WORLD
                               Part 35.

1739 AD
  Sir Robert Walpole, first PM of GB, somehow manages to start a war
  with Spain that is called, wait for this, I'm not kidding: the "War
  of Jenkins' Ear". Ah yes, what terrible times indeed when two
  nations go to war over some bloke's ear.

1740-1748
  The War of the Austrian Succession. Which is basically as follows:
  Prussia attacks Austria; France invades Germany; Britain attacks
  France; France fights back at Austria and Britain. Etc, etc, etc.

1756-1763
  Just when you thought it was safe to turn CNN back on, the Seven
  Years' War breaks out.

1767
  Captain Wallis discovers Tahiti. He almost calls it Wallis island,
  but then decides that doesn't sound sun-drenched and relaxing
  enough.

1768-76
  Captain Cook sails around the world in the Endeavour, discovering
  and mapping lots of things along the way.

1773
  The Boston Tea Party brings to a head the long quarrel between
  George III and the American colonists. When the British governor
  selfishly hoards the last of the Twinings teabags for himself, the
  colonists call him nasty names, and prepare for war.

1775
  First shots exchanged between colonists and British troops at
  Lexington. George Washington is made American Commander-in-Chief.
  He is to be known later as "Stormin' Georgie".

1776
  On July 4th, 13 American colonies issue the Declaration of
  Independence. They also declare Ya Boo Sucks To The British, and We
  Are The Champions And We're Going To Be A Superpower And You're Not
  So There Nyah Nyah Nyah Nyah Nyah.

1788
  On January 26th, Australia is colonised, ignoring requests from the
  local Aborigines to "bugger off back to Pommyland".
      Meanwhile, the Founding Fathers draw up the American
  constition, the preamble of which goes something like:
        We the people of the United States, in order to form a more
        perfect fried chicken, establish French fries and protect
        domestic hamburgers, provide for the common Pizza Hut,
        promote general fast food and other delicious stuff for
        ourselves and our posterity do ordain and establish this
        Constitution for the United States of America.

1789
  The French Revolution breaks out like a rash of acne. A young man,
  Marcel Remington, makes his first entry into the world of blade
  sales after a discussion with his mate Joseph Guillotin.
  Remington's guillotine blades become so good that one French
  nobleman is just about to say he'll buy the company when the blade
  chops through his neck, leaving him with a slight speech
  impediment. On July 14th, the people of Paris storm the Bastille
  prison and have a warehouse party there.
