    Welcome to the Sand River Journal.  Our goal is to provide a proper 
  setting for some of the better poetry associated with the newsgroup 
  rec.arts.poems.  We aim at an objective standard, if such exists for 
  poetry, but also strive to include diverse voices, not excluding our 
  own work.  These poems have all been previously posted to r.a.p. and 
  appear by authors' explicit permission.  They constitute copyrighted 
  material, and we claim ownership only to any poems we have authored.  
    Sand River Journal is posted to r.a.p and related newsgroups and is 
  archived at etext.archive.umich.edu/pub/Poetry.  The PostScript version 
  features high-quality typesetting and is well worth printing to hardcopy 
  and sharing.  We hope you enjoy this unique selection of poems.

                My Love is a Changeling
                -----------------------

        My love is a changeling --
        All variance, progression, and transition.
        Now who would dare to have her stay
        In some dull, resolved and static way?
        Not you nor I nor any other.
        For she speaks to us as the blades of grass
        While erupting through their concrete slabs
        And she'll remain the same in staid
        Through all her days of transience.

                Not the worst thing
                -------------------

        It is not the worst thing about sexual obsession
                that it heals, in time;
        that the liquid muscularity of the 20s, which turns
        to the fixed and arduous craving of the 30s,
                dims like the memories
        that defined the scope of youthful romanticism:
        the time you threw the beer bottle through the window...
                the morning you woke on an unknown floor...
                        the night you lost the car.

        Nor is it the worst thing to learn
        that the height of inspiration will not be defined
        by those mornings you stared
                across her high hard bed at dawn,
                transfixed by the rise and the fall
        of the raft of blonde hair flowing
                across the watery silk of her gown:
                        voracious, as if you could devour her
                                completely by watching
                        and play the act
                over and over again,
        pull closed the circle
                and live within the loop
                        for all time.

        That the standard remains solid is reassuring;
        though revised from gold to silver
        it is not devalued,
        and it is not the worst thing that
                the currency of passion in the end
                is spent less on reminiscence and revision
        than in present speculation:
                not so much expended on what might have been,
                or on the worst that could have happened;
                        or as to why you lived on, with no more than
                        the dim hope of your heart to heal;
        or where what turn in the road might have led;
                but on how fat has she become,
                        and if we met again today, would she know me,
                                before I spoke?
                        And did she ever get that job up on the hill?
                And does she still make that fantastic
        ratatouille?

                Cave of Dreams
                ---------------

        If fish were wishes floating on a wave
        of songs from peri's throats that caught the breeze
        in toothy nets they cast into the cave
        of dreams, would anglers drop their lines in seas
        to snare their fondest hopes?  The flounders swim
        in open circles through the bottom weeds;
        they feed on hopes.  Enchanted flounders skim
        the sandy bottom; they ignore the foolish needs
        of human vanity.  I have no dream
        of wishes granted by a flounder's tail.
        I have no hope that peris' eyes will gleam
        with love for me.  It's just a fairytale
        to lull a child to sleep, a fancy or
        a dream, a veil that's fallen to the floor.

        she harbors a girl with crossed
        eyes and a pruned face
        like a shrub.
        an owl in her pocket,
        hardened by the discovery of darwin
        can't get rid of the dark,
        or the onyx eyes floating
        in its milk-bottle belly.
        wintry paws brush like straw
        on the bed, and she comes home
        only to tell me about breath
        and the hollowing out of eyes.
        i can see her bones through skin,
        the marrow strings the form.
        not a bee but a spider
        who never flit but waited, and not a tongue
        resurfacing to lick, but teeth
        solid and stuck in gum like screws.
        she is glued to herself, an overture
        of pure light.  beyond the sheets, she can
        see the little girl, all wrapped and muffed
        for cold sea days and unveiling of sun.
        she can see the rope she jumped to
        hide the scrubbed bile
        and then again, she can wonder about heaven
        like she did by the wood stove in the
        parlor of her buttered mother.
        no, the firing of little
        bugs all around like a light source
        doesn't give her more life just light
        to see the web between digit.
        i sit by her now making my bread
        and wiggling my newness.  its not nice
        but i'm young and so oiled and fancy
        in my walk.  i hook her with my tail.
        honeyed was the way she held me
        and now, i am the swing.

        From the spire to the ruins,
        history faced the seasons
        as the river below
        crept
        by
        quietly
        with no intentions of staying.

        At the hands of time,
        the horses' heavy breathing
        fought with the wagon wheels
        for the lead role.

        But now, from the ruins to the spire,
        one can only imagine.

        Behold the arching aftermath of passion
        rushing through me like a mountain wind.

           Feel her tremble, pushing to fruition,
           draining every terror from my mind.

        If anyone can gaze upon this water,
        leave it undisturbed.  She will be mine

           forever, and we'll both grow mad as hatters,
           drunk as children on the nuptial wine.

        rain turns the cement

                --------

        Walls of red logs, adze-squared,
        heavily chinked in mottled yellow clay,
        mantel arrayed in copper pots, pewter
        plates, spoons, a green and yellow speckled
        plant (what did you call it?), two navel oranges,
        a leaning chessboard, ancient, _ancien regime_,
        mahogany, fruitwood inlaid, with a copper
        dipper hanging casually there; below
        the mantel, good stonework, mortar-washed,
        a delicate linen lampshade, white, in white
        grape leaves and clusters; lathe-turned lamp
        stand (from your shop?), rich polished rock maple;
        beside it, a clock in brass and walnut, its fly
        specked face roman numeraled, always at eight o'clock,
        and the couch upholstered in scenes from Plutarch,
        fragile to the eye, yet sturdy as are all things
        here: when I see you, my friend, it is always
        in this room that I see you, sitting before the
        chess men, offering latakia and smoke, saying
        pawn-to-king-four, even though I know
        it has been open to the leaden sky now
        so many years, the heavy oak floor boards
        piled with fir-cones, rich in mosses,
        growing morels, and only the chimney standing
        among wet pine woods recalls the richness
        of your pipes, your Bach, your Ruy Lopez.

        Claim now the lanterned world,
        your sketchpad of possibility!
        the deans exhorted us that fall.
        So many applications read, prayers said.
        All year he'd run, stiffly, to class.

        Once I saw him in his wooden shed.
        For days he'd gaze at an open page
        till one night facts gave in to him:
        If still enough, he could detect
        the resting atoms of his perfect freedom.

        The earth had seemed a mystic's place,
        a windy vista of statements arrayed.
        Now his winter's course of blood
        tapped messages no protest would touch.
        In January dreams he saw faint outlines,

        high weathered slopes last named by God.
        Next morning he walked out to them all.
        A century's ticking has settled nothing.
        He took paper with him and wrote:
        The Lord's torchbearers won't find me here.

        Funny somehow -
        the tungsten orange lights
        off brown brick walls,
        the shining off melted snow,
        puddles
        on the pavement
        as winter begins its
        freeze, stops in thought,
        and starts again.

        Funny somehow -
        how far I really am
        from those I'm
        really close to
        classrooms in orange and brown
        tears on pavement,
        and winter coming on strong.

                -------------------

        The motorcade snakes its way
        through cold, near-empty streets.
        Winter has marked its territory
        with graffiti of gray snow.
        We pass buildings that seem to
        cower wasted and pathetic.
        I sink deeper into
        the front seat of the lead car -
        the one reserved for next of kin.
        My son-in-law drives, they sit in back:
        my mother, talking quietly to herself,
        pointing out every passing street sign,
        wondering aloud how much further.
        Sandy next to her thinking, perhaps, of
        her father's funeral, how the year began
        with her loss and ends with mine;
        how, this year, our marriage has been one of
        parenthetical existence, bracketed by loss.
        A beige-gray sky covers us with sallow air,
        dollops of black birds litter empty trees
        as our small procession enters
        the cemetery gates.  I watch
        the birds, expecting them to follow -
        emissaries of death making official
        my elevation from immortal youth
        to mortal eldest son.

        over here the sun goes down in saffron
        skies
        yes over the land
        this leaves the roses & the lilacs
        for the marine horizon

        the ocean
        in silver blues & greens
        folds & unfolds the water patiently
        & whenever its patience ceases
        it marks (with white) the creases
        as the water jumps out of its skin
        & pounces seethingly

        after the sunset
        in the cloudless afterglow
        on the cold slick wet sand
        flow
        the slow
        glazed
        lilac
        tongues
        watch the land dry up & forget its water
        (it's the sea's caresses)
        but the sea always presses its case

        the crashing is constant
        the crashing
        the constant
        wuthering
        give me breath & take away my speech

        this half-forever is a halfway-house
        to arizona's deserts
        beaches of perfect solitude
        there is no perfect solitude
        on this beach
        only half-solitudes
        cluttered with beggar birds

        today i found an old shell worn down
        to a smooth a piece of artwork
        crisscrossed with delicate grooves
        so perfectly worn flat round & slim
        unshell-like & tiny with a jewel's beauty
        worked by nobody

        Grand dad's not got
        Anything to do today
        'Cept sit around his checker set
        And wait on old Pop Lundry to come down
        Off Cooper's Ridge to play.

        I watched him rock
        Away this morning talking
        To his bird dog Bellaret.
        She don't leave the front porch much, now, either
        'Cept when they go out walking.

        And just as dusk
        Collects along the valley's rim
        All the boys and young men come
        To listen and be hypnotized by tales
        Of how the valley is and has always been.

             "Eighty-eight years old
             And the Keenus Bridge collapsed!
             One righteous groan at Mandy Wheeler's weight
             (Mammoth Mandy's four hundred pounds of fat)
             Then rubble sixteen feet below.
             Amanda too.

             You know
             Her screams were heard from Willisville
             To Fiddler's graveyard (fifteen miles apart).
             And it took two good mules
             A hard days work to pull
             Her from the mud."

        And he enchants them
        With the miners and the whores
        With the wild side of the mountain,
        The ridge wise boys, the foothill clowns
        And the troubadors.

             "The people haven't danced in Willisville
             Since Charlie Waters coughed himself
             Black lung until
             He died.
             And he was young!

             Younger than the ages of collected things....
             His nickel dates rented the parlor
             And his white gold watch
             Doesn't wear him any longer
             At the stem.
             Because we hocked it!
             We hocked it for the band
             (The Keenus Creek Quartet)
             And they played "Barbara Allen" as we planned
             And planted Charlie in the ground."

        So go now,
        Down from these older mountains
        And listen to the valley sage
             "He's a good ol' boy"
        Pulling at his pipe and telling lies - counting
        All the ways he didn't make it rich.

             "'47 was a bitch!
             I lost my cotton to the bug,
             My dog to endless age
             And my farm to Jimmy Lundry's poker game.
             Boy - pass me that ther' jug
             Yes sir - '47 was a year!"

        A sad thing,
        my pencil to this page.
        I don't know why the characters are formed,
        why I say clouds on the air
        thin and falling.
        I don't have any kind of license,
        waking only to roll over in the dawn,
        so dense and silent with its narrative,
        bleak bleeding through the off-white drapes.

        Sadder still,
        the mockingbirds on power lines
        singing car alarms
        and refuse trucks in reverse.
        They are wise but I am none the wiser.

        Last night I slept with no music,
        alone and fetal,
        so cold, I wished I could be
        a cake spatula between the mattress and box springs.
        The warm kept swimming away.

        There've been dreams where I felt so much
        I could only stand there weeping.
        This is all I've ever felt in a dream,
        except the tingle of those bullets in my back
        when I was killed
        trying to save a girl from terrorists in the cafeteria.

                ---------------

        It's his 80th birthday,
        and Jack Lalane raves on
        about the junk we put into
        our bodies.
        Boils, pimples, aging and death
        scream down like bad health bombs
        upon our foolish heads.
        As he lectures he pumps
        the barbell up and down
        like some ancient hypnotic
        device.  He has wrinkles older
        than I am, but his biceps
        agelessly expand.

        You wouldn't wake your dog up
        in the morning and give him coffee,
        a donut, and a cigarette,
        would you? he asks, and as he stands,
        sipping carrot juice in the Southern
        California dawn, a verdant light pours in
        through picture windows framed
        in shades of palm,
        and rollicking white puppies
        circle him like earthbound doves.

        But then the dog is back
        to wake me up again,
        his wet grey nose insistent,
        and I knock over last night's
        final glass of scotch, cursing
        and he shies away, then pokes
        once more with that sharp nose
        as if to say get up, let me out,
        make coffee, you lazy bastard,
        and how about
        a light?

        distant chimes of colors soft and mellow
        waterfalls of music and of hues
        spring concertos savoured in Grieg's hollow
        ballads selvedge with a tinge of blues

         a universe espousing my existence
         transported from these concrete walls of flesh
         through folded time and vision's persistence
         into ethereal dreams and cosmic space

                    (After Toulouse Lautrec)
                --------------------------------

        She wanted a shadow as much as a friend
        yet she yanked drunkenly the thing on her leash.
        Elegantly tired of the familiar faces,
        she had the talent to snag men by the eyes.
        Killable and toothless all soon surrendered;
        whatever powers they once had soon left them.
        Here was an extraordinary success,
        hands and knees and other parts approaching her
        from every corner in a prayer of peristalsis.
        In her was a map charting decades and distances
        broader than the thoroughfares of light
        she delighted in. What she wanted
        was a pavement to the stars of the crushed bones
        of her numberless supplicants, and her worry was
        that somehow all the things she dearly wanted,
        were they to prove as clear as the teardrops
        she'd extracted, one by one, she might get.

                                            silently beside me
        not touching but with the hint of their presence near me
        so that when I move aside they may pass through
        as is the way of small creatures
        they announce their beings with a vast silence.

        French toast air
        slides under my
        bedroom door where
        James has finally
        escaped, giant peach
        and all.  I hear my father,
        not a scream,
        something with more
        power and direction.
        "Has he said Monkeybumper?",
        James asks, his sketched
        features staring at
        a point beyond my head,
        just like I do in school.
        "I'm not sure, James,
        it sounded more like
        Motherfucker."
        James sighs as I turn
        the page, burying him
        between chapters six
        and seven, never
        allowing him to
        change the story
        again.

        ticket town to my
        high school one grade 10
        seat behind my own

        too big too bold to blend
        with anorexia peer pressure
        cooked trendy pastel girls
        her hair drooped long
        and greasy into smudged
        black bloodshot eyes

        she sold me her Beatles
        Abbey Road for 5 bucks
        needing money to buy
        temporary escape out of
        boredom but for absolutely
        free she taught me to smoke

        curb sitting student parking
        lots of leather grimy faces
        and smoke delicious and
        shrouding blue grey no
        pastels no halos
        just cool and hot

        Player's Light regulars
        held between first two

        Ann Marie got enough sold
        everything worth anything
        money to leave my boredom
        and move back to Montreal

        to seek an answer

        Go, it cries, one veil each gate
        and eyes are madness.
 
                The green of dye and gray-pall
        afternoons that loom forever mornings.
        The green of fall.
        A travelling mouth, no muscles,
        no lungs, all velvet teeth
        between rocks and slowly
        rising a green thief to trunks.
        Yes -- not the hanging southerners
        but sloth and anti-equinox
        a birth that kills and steals
        back to the vagina-hall
        and guards green cups as
        innocuous velvet dragons.
                Moss, I mark.

        You -- twining earth in bulbous birth
        (which gate?  Two?  Seven?)
        dead limbs to sculptural tapestry
        frills -- a Victorian sorceress
        twine turn Celtic knot.
                Now somehow you sprung
        from your sapsucker life.
        Death-feast on death to death-feast
        on hoary dryads -- hoary
        wrinkled thick skin, high crowned
        elephant-limbed, but alive.
                I can't wait, you say, and
        eat them to frill yourself.  See?
        Thread for a rug.  Death is Picasso.
        Life is paint, silver-canned, not
        swift as we, not miracle-cloud-thrall.
                Mushrooms, I mark.

        And I brush my arms and brush
        and brush -- cobwebs, can't remove
        or see.
                Something is glowing or fading
        there.  Windburn flecks dissolving
        lips' Cupid bow.  Glass savage-torch-lit--
        a wild Muse with serpentine tongue
        Melpomene
                I am not drunk -- oh it goes
        to mushrooms again and my
        pubic hair curls moss --

        Today I saw a hat
        lying on the pavement
        with a note attached
        that read

        _An invisible man_
        _stands before you,_
        _imagine my plight_
        _and be generous_
        It was raining
        and feeling sorry for him
        I added a coin
        to the pile in his hat

        while in a shop doorway
        across the street
        a man with no hat
        looked quickly away.

        lands you here
        sunday morning
        Maxwell Street

        Chicago's gauchos
        wear tall white hats
        the march wind
        doesn't dare steal

        in the hollows
        of their throats
        gold crosses press
        belief against skin
        as they stir pots
        and turn tortillas

        a vendor's cry
        translates - this market
        Chicago
        Mexico
        Taiwan

        the jade and flowers
        we left behind resurface
        on card tables - hubcaps
        imposter perfumes

        foreigners again
        the taste of strange juice
        runs down our chins
        wary eyes watch us buy
        a beggar's
        yellow pencils
        follow his gentle,
        wobbly gait.

        she swims
        face down
        on asphalt
        navigates refuse
        and legs
        her right arm
        propels
        left clutches
        shirts, plastic wrapped
        above her
        the Night Market.

        he spits
        a wad of betel
        two dictator's faces
        one cherry blossom
        land by her head
        she does not count
        the coins
        or watch him lift
        the shirt
        carry it away
        ignore the haggling
        foreigners
        fake Rolexes
        pale hair streaked
        red and green

        he walked the market
        a hungry moon followed

        stopping by a steaming cart
        he perched on a three legged stool
        ordered wide noodles
        floating in broth

        broke her orbit

        everyone fled
        but the man
        his face in his bowl
        and a woman
        her back to the sky.

        her limbs break like a clay jar
        where can a goddess
        fallen
        find soup?

        in the Market
        the floating
        eternal market

        her arms outstretched
        her back to the sky.
