    Welcome to the Sand River Journal.  Our goal is to provide a proper 
  setting for some of the better poetry associated with the newsgroup 
  rec.arts.poems.  We aim at an objective standard, if such exists for 
  poetry, but also strive to include diverse voices, not excluding our 
  own work.  These poems have all been previously posted to r.a.p. and 
  appear by authors' explicit permission.  They constitute copyrighted 
  material, and we claim ownership only to any poems we have authored.  
    Sand River Journal is posted to r.a.p and related newsgroups and to
  regional forums, and is archived at etext.archive.umich.edu/pub/Poetry.  
  The PostScript version features high-quality typesetting and is well 
  worth printing to hardcopy and sharing.  We hope you enjoy this unique 
  selection of poems.

	Two cream fledglings and
	yellow beaks click wet,
	knife and stone's ringing strokes
	in jagged nest.
	
	But jelly eyes and soft membrane
	push through fresh lids
	and blades fold,
	and beaks nestle in downy necks
	when I've been as honest as eggs.

		Bring to Me Spring
		------------------

	Arrives the Burpee catalog,
	Canterbury Bells peal Springtime's chimes.
	Wishful mass of floral flash -
	page upon page, 
	like the budding roses
	unfolding,
	each turn,
	each aspect of the unfurling petals
	a divergent portrait
	of splendor seeded...
   	 
	I plot my plot,
	paint my patch
	in pastels, with Pinks!
	Clumps of lowlying crops
	cover the border bricks
	I dug in, dirtied kneed
	and broken nailed
	eons ahead of this year's 
	new arrivals.
   	 
	Stakes impaled
	Impatiens sturdied,
	I plan my planting
	cycled with the moons and tides,
	germinating when the Lilacs bloom,
	bury the Mums by Mother's Day-
	my mother's dead, but the day survives
	like perennials, always room
	for another Hallmark sowing.
	
	Burpee's Best
	are always better 
	in pictoral propogation,
	anticipation - my best attempt
	to burrow the Four O' Clocks
	beside the Morning Glories
	o' course creates Circadian conflict -
	time and Cicadas wait for no woman,
	they grow when they feel like it,
	no matter what Sam Burpee says,
	and grasshoppers do eat Marigolds...

	Chalk-black shroud evades

	Spasmodic dancing
	In quick personal orbits
	
	Eternal brushstroke
	On a thick-dark molasses masterpiece
	Twinkling command performance
	In a spectator sky

		Of the Night
		------------

	My love rides the night,
	And the fortunate have not laid eyes upon her.
	
	Which of the rising mists is she?
	What paw print or black wing
	Off the corner of sight
	Tells of her passing?
	For she has become the great evil
	Stalking the land, the stuff of legends
	Future and past.
	
	Her skin has grown cold, and her eyes
	Blacker than her hair.
	Her love has turned dark, into lust
	For any blood of the human.
	
	She will come for me.
	My stake and mallet await,
	Ready to pierce the heart
	That once I cherished,
	And free her to sleep.
	
	When this is done, the world
	Will be left to contend with merely the evils
	Of average men.

		(Note on pronunciation: "hoooo" is an 
		unvoiced "who", like blowing wind, 3 seconds.)


	find me, brush me, pocket me, keep me.
			
	to the longing in the clouds
	i say,
	in the high, high heaven,
	please do away
	with your forever blue
	hugging you
			
	and drop them jeans
	in a sacred rain
	onto this forever plain
	that's wrapped in a forever hoooo.
			
	now i'm a pony
	buckling
	under you, dear load.
			
	dear load, please grant me thy grace and guidance
	and don't withhold your sweet open
	thighs
	either
	while you are in the granting
	garment-chucking
	mood.
	should you weigh so heavy on me
	in your absence, dear load?
			
	immortal kisses, kindnesses
	and an afterwife.
	this is the land of divorce, 
	there is virtue in widows.
	
	however, i want to hump with innocence.
	miss innocence,
	oh, to throw the good book at you
	and put a ski on our child...
	and a mac on our table...
	and to teach you how	
	to pour your charm into e-mail
	what's that
	and to show you off to other women
	show what?
	like a he'll-marry-me! ring.
			
	i wish to watch you brush
	our moments
	out of your swollen hair.
			
	heaven is, if heaven were,
	helping you with a stocking or two.
		
	there is no discipline i would not abandon
	to learn the texan twang from you
	that patient, exacting kindness:
	no, silly goose, you say it like this...
			
	in the cleavage of the dark, in the bluebells of the blossom
	...sweetness...  i don't want anything else...
	of a country house porch swing
	...moreover, i never wanted less...
	across the unfinished kitchen table
	...this is enough for me...
	in a plastic booth in a dairy queen
	...you make me so very dizzy...
	in the tall grass pearling up around us
	...i once was lost but now i'm found...
			
	miss innocence, i have a prayer to offer:
	let us take this moment, dear load, in pails
	like pig slop
	or manna from heaven
	my lady of the immaculate nails
	a red like a church-going ford pick-up truck
	and 14k jewelry
	and may i have me granted thy welcoming pussy.
			
	on my way to the bloodkissed
	santa fe, new mexico
	i stopped here,
	with friends
	but i could have settled
	instead on your shy open hand
	and drunk your scent
	at full strength.
			
	the texan sun raineth on your head for 20 years.  okay.
	monday to sunday, sunday to monday.  okay.
	from it you soaked some mysterious rays.
	and they produced true love, aimless and wanton.
	until it has.  yes?
	seeped into your lashes, dripped into your eyes.
	slipped into your speech, leached into your walk.  my walk?
	and now it wisps out of your pores.
	at the slightest shift of your perfect.  perfect?
	ass.
	and it is gleaming
	in that look.
	in those eyes.  my eyes?
	trapped under that hair.  what about my hair!
	focused in your face.
	and it says.
	hi...  boy...  you crazy on me yet?
	you've got 5 minutes to axe me out...
			
	i'd never say thaaaaaaaaaaaat!
		
	you are a walking country diction
	sweeping succulent idioms aside with your scentful breasts
	and so
	my heart gets yanked from san francisco
	on arrival, out of breath it says:
	girl... we have... not... yet met...
	but between you... and me...
	i would have you...
	framed... in this voracious sky...
	dry...
	framed... in your... sweetness...
	swarming... like bees...
	all hot... and bothered... warm and
			
	wet.

		----------
		The 1950's
		----------

	The doctor thinking he's
	got to learn about the world
	all over again from
		square one
		start

	Looking over words
	as he'd peer
	over a newly trimmed hedge
	seeing something just beyond 
		and to one side

	The doctor doesn't think he knows anything for sure
	only the hula hoops and twinkies,
	the blues and violets of his mind
		very late at night

	He doesn't know what he's putting down
	only that he's noticing,
	noting, noticing
	his stethoscope here
		and here

	Red and pink lipstick cases
	with a little mirror on one side,
	hats, stockings, garter belts
	 	and gloves

	There is sound
	there's the refrigerator
		and the water dripping

	He bought a shirt in 1950 the most remarkable
		feature of which
	is a snag or tear will reduce it
		to nothing.
	It's a shirt made of a single cell
	that, when it's reduced to nothing,
	a single cell remains.
		The original cell of that fabric.

	What he is seeking is a quilt
	made up of the original cells of all the fabrics.

	What the l950s does
	like a blow to the back or side of one's head
	it relocates your mind

	The doctor in Intensive Care 
	where he belongs
	if anyone else is here or still here
		that's fine.

		*	*	*

	What were the 1950s?  Teresa Brewer and the Korean War

	It was hard apples and the popularity of DDT
	Popularity was a word heard a lot of in 1950
	
	It was James Dean
	and Peter Lawford,
	TV's Karen and Chubby,
		the Mickey Mouse Club 
			taken seriously

	It was the time many people who came into their own
		in the 1960s
	first got laid
	or had wet dreams
	the last wet dream the doctor had was sometime in	        
		the 1950s
	
	Basketball games on Chicago's north side
	and the walk home at 5 o'clock
		carrying a switchblade knife,
		the two Rosenbergs frying in the electric chair
		McCarthy and his crony Roy Cohn
	the atomic bomb already five years old

	Plastic surgery
	and nose jobs
	fame
	in a new light

		*	*	*

	Nixon saying, "California politics is a can of worms"
	Captain Kangaroo, Howdy Doody
	Arthur Godfrey on television.
	the Outside
	the Inside
	Outside
	Inside
	Fresh hot toast with butter on it from the mother
		of a friend
	the doctor's own mother dead at 42
	the knowledge there were two different worlds
	giving
	taking
	Epistemology
	Involved elaborate schemes for not making up your
		mind anyway
	"Saturday night is the loneliest night in the week--"
	Taking No-Doz and staying up all night for exams
	
	Right-handed angel playing a trumpet
	and Moses coming down off the mountain
	not with the 10 Commandments
	but a set of scrolls
		and where the commandments
		would normally go
		double sets of chimes.
	
	Moses coming down with castanets
	Saul of Tarsus with a set of drums
	Christ fluting
	Buddha blissful at the keyboard
	
		*	*	*
	
	The jazz was good
	Death was softened, advancements made
	in the salesmanship of everything
	The doctor's own deepest impulses
	 	were not to nurse or nurture
	 	but to attack
	
	Hanging out at Sonny Berkowitz' Pool Hall,
	wearing blue suede shoes,
	Levis and navy blue shirt,
	he bought a zip gun,
	joined a street gang
	
	Once, doing reconnaissance,
	exploring the intricacies
	of the Chicago Drainage Canal,
	he entered a sewer
	and ambled deeply as he could 
	reflecting all the while
	on his chances of surviving
	the synchronizied flushing
	of three-and-a-half million toilets.
	
	
	For the first time in 2,000 years
	one went four years to a University
	without saying one true word
	going to work for Hallmark Greeting cards
	or the phone company
	one knew something was at hand because things
	became easy.
	Richard Wilbur's poems
	arrived at one's door
	in little four-line stanzas
	Tin-Pan alley
	people in college dormitories subscribing
		to the KENYON REVIEW
	and listening to Pat Boone
	
		Five foot two, eyes of blue,
		cotton candy hair
		strapless white lace dress
		zipped up over
		a snug corset
		seated on a sofa
		in a dormitory
		in Champaign, Illinois,
		touch me, touch me
		black patent leather belt open
		and matching black patent leather
			pocket book
		beside her,
		`petting' it was called, 
		one foot touching the floor at all times
		("that's right you two, 
			or I `ll have to ask you to leave"),
		ejaculating beneath her dress
		somewhere or other
		discreetly as possible
	
	Birds flutter and when they walk
	they flutter too.
	
	The doctor sees giant mushroom cloud
	father of the H-Bomb Edward Teller 
	Police Action Korea Harry Truman
	and Dwight David Eisenhower, 
	each with six legs and arms
	dancing to the music
	 	of Lord Shiva and Judy Garland
		doing it
			on a pink velvet loveseat.
	
	The doctor makes a mental note to turn
	his socks inside out to empty
	out the sand before putting
	them into the laundry bag.

		----------
		Boundaries
		----------

	The old man went with me when I walked the line, 
	checking boundaries. We drove round the mountain 
	to an unkempt farm on its western slope, parked,
	and ranged its pasture for a survey marker,
	dividing blatting sheep among the trampled
	sedges along a line of willow. The sign
	of success was a cap of brass, much chewed by
	bush hogs and sickle bar mowers: the section
	corner. We cut a pole from willow for our
	chain, and taking compass in hand, set out south
	along the invisible section line, straight
	up one knee of the dark mountain, floundering
	through viney maples, over old hemlock logs,
	around the huge stumps of shipped-out firs, with their
	deep-set eyes, which were the notches cut by men
	to set their spring boards in to stand on, drawing
	their singing misery whips through the bellies
	of the silent giants. We flagged the line as
	we went, hanging the orange strips from chittims,
	blackcherries, huckleberries, bigleaf maple.
	Across to the south side of the hill we shanked,
	breaking out into sun sometimes, waist deep in
	bracken ferns and trailing blackberries, pushing
	through young Douglas firs with their rich Christmas whiff,
	down to the alders with ancient yews lurking
	in their shade, and crawled through tall salmonberry
	at last into my new-made clearing by my
	new-built house, hanging a flag only fifteen 
	feet off the flag we'd hung before we drove out.
	The old man admired the results, and said to
	the old woman, standing by, "That boy is just
	the same in the woods as I am way out on
	the water; always knows right where he is." She
	nodded, and handed him a cup of coffee,
	with cream, no sugar, and not too hot or cold.

	The sky above this garden is ablaze
	With shimmer running almost to Orion;

	Here between a willow and the stream,
	Let's wait awhile to watch our planet dream.

		reflection in the fountain
		--------------------------

	i smell the smell of entire tribes,
	order and a grass as fine as hemp,
	in the division of water below
	my potted palms. bourbon-minced
	saliva creeps like cloth.
	lips curve an alleyway,
	a hardened rot of spilling for substance
	and down the coil;
	i fall into small thimble,
	tip myself into relic
	without a thought for foe
	or even the flinging out of love that
	will replace my lips for conversation.
	the waking mouth
	hangs just so, off to one side and
	then parted.  underneath tongue rises
	and falls and rises
	and falls.  sharp-tuned tunnel
	catches and i spin out into
	stain, rubbed and postured for
	future.  swells of water
	ripple form and swoop the snail
	in me - my criminal in apathy.
	i regard my shadow with malice
	and adorn its shape
	with giggles.  boots loop my feet,
	bulging ankles strapped in leather
	as to walk on glass
	without fluttering.  naughty speaks
	through the fountain, hickeys and
	tenor visions like stalks.  what do i
	see but hiding?

		The Death of My Son
		-------------------
	
	I sit in a smoke-filled room
	A half-empty bottle sits near me.
	Glowing cigarettes walk around
	In the mouths of black-suited guests.
	Mourners, they call themselves.
	I know him, he who lies within
	Though the bottle takes away his name.
	A boy.  He used to be my son
	Though he never once called me Dad.
	I used to see him once a year.
	I haven't seen him at all for three.
	His mother sits next to another man.
	The man is rigid and staring at me.
	He is angry that I have come.
	I drink again from the bottle.
	I find little solace in its contents.
	I sense that something is missing.
	I sense the wrong one is dead.

                ------
                Coffee
                ------

        Out his kitchen window, he watches
        a bus pull away from the corner.
        He holds his coffee cup,
        swirling it although there is
        no coffee in it,
        considers taking a bath.

        She always told him not too
        much coffee, just the one cup
        in the morning, and that he should
        remember to bathe every day,
        as these were just the kinds of things
        he would soon forget
        once she was gone.
 
        He places his cup among others
        in the sink.  The bathtub is clean
        and damp, still warm.
        He sits on the toilet
        watching as the tub fills.

        By custom, he draws too much
        water, so that some always runs
        out the overflow as he gets in,
        leaving behind as much water
        as will fit,
        making a sound he always
        liked hearing.
 
        He images a spider trapped
        in the overflow, washing
        down the pipes.
        As he slides into the water
        he thinks of her, so many years,

        and although she is not here
        to scrub his back he smiles.
        His toes surface and submerge:
        he watches them break
        through floating rafts
        of bubbles, then sink again,
        like a shipwrecked crew
        of drowning men.

        After his bath he watches the water
        circle down the drain,
        but without his glasses
        he cannot tell
        if the whirlpool drains
        with or counter to the clock,

        although he understands
        or thinks he remembers
        it always turns the same way,
        like a dog circling nose to tail
        on a carpet looking
        for that one best spot.

        The word "coriolis"
        surfaces slowly and submerges again,
        and eyes closed he watches it
        as from a moving vehicle,
        experiences it as he would a neon
        sign flashing past

        in the nighttime.
        He makes a note on his mental
        blackboard to watch closely
        next time which way the water
        circles as it drains.
        He smiles again,
        as he can have
        his coffee now
        that he has bathed.

                Elses laughter
                --------------

        In March,1993
        totally without warning
        I changed the way I eat apples
        and the way I laugh -
        I'd been borrowing someone
        elses laughter before then.

                The Lotus Flower
                ----------------

        If you cannot find the rose
        That tireless, blooms,
        Here within these arms,
        Find instead the timeless lotus flower
        Which once you offered and I refused
        In a white-hued winter,
        Drawn in brilliant colour,
        Under a cloudless sky.

        If you will not speak of these
        Silent whispers,
        There within the day,
        Speak instead to the snow white lilly
        Which grows within my only cavern
        In a heart filled with light
        Grey and lifeless in pallor,
        Under this cooling skin.

		Leave as you have Lived
		-----------------------

	You are costive in your imaginations,
	like Corundum in muddy thought
	sinking to the complaisant image
	of a prosaic, adequate Self -
	All for sake of comformity.
	And wiping out your
	individuality as you content
	yourself out of being.

	And you will leave as you have
	lived your life: Dead.

	The wind is a pillow.

	It feels like molten glass
	wrapped in cashmere.
	It's singing!
	I love it like this.

		City Square, Buenos Aires
		-------------------------
                    
	An outdoor room of bowed walls
	and low defining trees,
	the city square is railed off
	to enclose what no cloister could:
	
	a fountain made of broken columns
	and a squat equestrian general
	who spurred civic pride
	by surpressing laws, punishing foes,
	
	curtailing lives with a high necessity.
	This is Borges city,
	a place of traffic, where grey
	historical clouds define oppression
	
	in other terms, other pantomimes:
	the fidget of pigeons and old men
	pensioned since the last revolution
	or the last coarse drought.
	
	Yet the boulevards are wide enough
	for tanks, close enough for walks,
	the city square more barren
	than sunlight on catafalques.

		South Seas Rumba Party
		----------------------
    
	The Wind flew softly to my side
	Playfully lifting my hair from my eyes
	Kissing my cheek in passing
	On his way to a South Seas Rumba Party
	.Party on, dude, I said!
	
	The Rain flowed down my face
	Tickling my sides and legs
	Licking my ear in passing
	On her way to a South Seas Rumba Party
	.Party Hearty, sweets, said I!
	
	The Lightening sped across my sight
	Electrifying my every orifice
	Shooting sparks in passing
	On her way to a South Seas Rumba Party
	.'s Party, I slurred, dazed!
	
	But when Thunder came rumbling my way
	Growling up my spine to my head
	I roared at him in passing
	NOT on my way to a South Seas Rumba Party
	.Now your Party's mine! (and I swallowed him!)
	
	So if, by chance, you happen upon
	A South Seas Rumba Party in progress
	Just know in passing
	Thunder won't be there, oh no, not him
	.Party'd out, we'd say!

	take dilaudid in a spoon
	add water heat quickly till 
	a foul smelling smoke is produced
	and the liquid bubbles and seethes
	this burns off the impurities and
	the things that will kill you.
	add a bud of cotton wool
	insert the needle into the cotton and
	draw back the plunger
	notice that no matter how carefully
	you do this there is always
	a small bubble of air in the syringe
	this must be removed
	so depress the plunger until
	a droplet of solution glitters at
	the end of the needle.
	it is now safe.
	you may find it easier to wrap
	a belt around your upper arm
	watch for the large vein
	insert the needle
	if you do it right, then
	a tendril of blood should shoot
	into the solution.
	you may now slowly press the plunger.
	sit back. relax. sleep.

		Danny & Andre
		-------------

	Danny finds a throw
	away medicine cabinet
	burned out bulbs
	sliding mirror
	jagged, tarnished frame
	pried from wall.
	
	Danny props it atop
	concrete fencing
	next to Lady Luck
	Laundromat - he preens
	picking his face, nose
	wiping fingers
	on tan corduroys.
	
	Andre slides up
	in chrome wheel chair
	spray painted red
	with green glitter flecks.
	Chicago Bulls emblem
	brands the back rest
	in black magic
	marker and dyslexic hand.
	
	Danny turns round
	high fiver - high
	fiver.  +Ma boooy+.
	He dances everything -
	tribal incantations,
	polkas, jigs, Swan Lake.
	Andre's rag doll legs
	impact with callused
	palms.  He mouths
	every instrument
	with rhythmic echoes.
	
	Danny yo yo's
	Andre out and back
	out, back. Twirling round
	popping wheely's.
	Andre's vision flies
	up to sky, the world circles,
	Andre's arms raise hallelujah.
	
	On the outspin Danny catches
	his profile and stops,
	throwing Andre forward.
	He sneaks up to glass mumbling
	eyes unblinking.  Andre
	readjusts his legs.
	
	Danny tilts his head
	left then right,
	then behind and in again.
	pointing dirty fingers
	blackened nails, spitting
	the reflection.
	
	Danny pulls his hair.
	clumps of blonde
	oiled and gritty curls
	sprout from knotted fists.
	
	Andre pulls Danny's
	corduroy leg.  a dog
	begging attention.
	He pulls harder
	the second time.
	Danny flies round
	inhales a gust of wind,
	propels forward.
	the curls sprinkle
	Andre's high-low fade.
	
	Danny belly laughs, grooves,
	skipping, knee slapping,
	butt shaking, high fiving
	down Park Street.
	
	Andre pulls Danny's medicine
	cabinet into his lap.  Leans
	forward curled to view
	his upside down image.
	
	Danny beckons from
	the corner +yo brother get
	ya dumb ass ova here+
	Andre tosses Danny's
	medicine cabinet into
	the busy street. The glass
	breaks.  You and I swerve.

		  Standing Prematurely 
		Before Benedictio's Tomb
		------------------------
 
	I have never looked for Guy's name in
	The Funerary Times or Gestalt World,
	Preferring to chuckle on finding it
	In unexpected indices.
 
	Adroitest of scholars,
	Impeccably reticent,
	He understood the commonality of
	Socrates and oaken tables.
 
	It took two generations for me
	To comprehend that the internal link
	Between the elegant poet and my blunt father
	Was the purity of their honor.

		nightmare in bflat, op.31
		-------------------------

	parades of soft vienna clowns
	with lanterns of the hungarian princess
	swung before my eyes, laughing their hungry thirst for
	smatterings of shattered love letters
	which hung like ice crystals on a clear prairie winter morning
	
	living in the shadows of deaf giants
	who stole the show right out from under me
	leaving me naked for no-one to see
                        	but me
	
	i've played these same scales
	over and over and
	candles burn down over scores of songs i will never play
	
	in these nights of forlorn horror
	of stampeding ghosts
	and heckling monotonies
	there lies only wicked prostitutes of time by my side
	selling me short
	selling me....

		Ruffage For Ruffians
		--------------------

	Whore mold creeps soft like flu fingers,
	picking ear-wax, slave to sleep, while onward it comes,
	somnambulant -- hungry for the earlobe, the drum -- and blunders
	an awkward chicken-motion, clucking this noise:
	
	our charters, our hooks, our redundancy sunders
	the waffle-irons of suburbia, out there
	gleaming, twittering like nerves before the numb.
	Skulls satiate on raw beans and these words are the bean curd
	clusters of the middle-man, supply and demand.
	
	Throw thrift to the dogs, brackish clog of my love there
	sitting, there sleeping, there pissing on the cushion
	And you were house-broken, trained to beg for coffee grounds 
			in s. america
	before the whip rode miles of thigh,
	Forced you to cry.
	
	Door slam, I'm fucked. I'm outta here. I'm not writing poetry
     	for you,
	for approval, for me -- even amounts of discourteousness: I 
			frown on the
     	artform and the hyphen --
	but you've crawled this far, you've sucked my spoo and here 
			we meet at
	last: toothy plumage blooming in the sweaty hole-mind of hate.
	
	Whatever this means.
