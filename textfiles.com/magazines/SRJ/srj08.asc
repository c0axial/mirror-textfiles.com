	Later, in the chill of morning, you lie
	silent, still, as if sculpted from ivory.
	I look in your eyes and I am lost, lost --
	that is sufficient bribery, and enough 
	reward;  my soul would cost you nothing more.

	I will keep this memory, like a scar.
	Out the window, the trembling rays of the sun 
	gather strength to bully the fading stars.
	Over the river, the full moon dances;
	it dances, spins, and sinks behind the trees.

		Rilke Drunk, in a Cafe with Rodin, 1902
		---------------------------------------

	He sees: not the throbbing flicker of the room
	nor even the particular radiance of angels,
	but the sculptor's carved Mosaic face
	undulating before him, dissolving in candle flame,
	rippled like the black cat's muscles
	he watched that afternoon
	in the Jardin Des Plantes.
	He can see through the artifice of shaping
	to find the darkness at their hearts.

		sneak attack
		------------

	the night was
	nice, a movie and too much
	to eat
	we got home and
	it was late enough already
	and we went to bed

	only you couldn't get
	to sleep, there was this
	funny pain
	in your shoulder and it
	was nothing but it was
	something

	so we called the doctor
	early saturday morning
	and he was asleep so maybe
	tums would do, or an aspirin

	but it didn't so we called
	back and just to be on the
	safe side, let's go to the
	hospital and see, you know?

	and it was
	early saturday morning
	and we were tired but we were
	worried too so we went

	they took you inside and
	I filled out the papers

	and after the xray and the ekg
	they let me in and you were
	pale in the paper gown but
	smiling a little
	and the docs and nurses said
	it was something
	about your heart

	but they weren't sure what
	so they gave you steroids
	because thats what you do
	when it's something
	about your heart

	and about three
	minutes later everything
	went crazy
	and you were thrashing and
	yelling and the doctors were
	giving quick orders and the
	nurses were holding you and
	the monitor was beeping
	and there was no room to
	get close

	so I stood back
	and cried

	well, you made your point
	I love you, all right
	now cut this out and
	let's go home

	together

	I see now
	that your immobility is a knife aimed at my heart
	your nonchalance a roving gun
	your dispassionate stance a seeping poison.

	My love you are a band of assassins
	disguised as a man.

	And then one day you wake to find
	the world is white;
	the blemishes are bleached,
	the rough edges chipped away,
	leaving an alabaster harmony behind.

	Despite yourself your thoughts turn
	to cause and effect, to creation.
	Enough! It is time to leave.
	You open the door and flinch:
	it is cold outside.

	Carry me in a charm
	about your neck, a 
	strand of hair, a
	tooth, a spot of dust.

	Toss me in a
	cerebral ocean, to
	wallow a few 
	decades longer.

	Carve me in granite,
	pink and enduring,
	and plant me in
	a garden with
	daffodils and mud. 

	Catch me in dye 
	and silver specks,
	and keep me in
	a frame upon the
	window sill.

	Scan me into one 
	hundred thousand sintered 
	dots, and store me on
	magnetic film. 

	Do this in 
	remembrance of me.

	the only Carmen I have known

	the life
	 long eyes in shroud black hair

	we meet: to talk

	anew   in moonlit tress
	again I found this precious language

	Is the gift of light any less itself 
	for its coming from afar?
	Look around and span the sky at night
	who can say a star's no consequence:
	oh star, where did you come from,
	and star, only you, as star, can tell
	of original creation and why we are
	entrained within this universal amber night...
	And what came before, and what's outside?
	Only a star might know (if any know at all)
	and for that, and for its gift of light
	(no less a gift for its have come from far!)

	watching a soot covered squirrel
	climb a dead tree.
 
	You're acting paranoid
	about being downtown

	I keep making the same mistake
	over and over again,
	as if programmed

		Birth-Pains
		-----------
		(to D.J.E.)

	Don't you know that you are
	as a child to me?
	When I scold you with
	the sharpness of labor pains,
	my hard-edged caresses
	folding over your fears upon these sheets,
	canceling daylight with the
	thought of dark warmth--
	I am pleading inside:
	I am the first-time mother
	who tries too hard to flood your life,
	to draw you into my skin each night
	and flush you out anew each dawn.
	Soft, you are soft,
	floating away from me through time.
	I ought to be the Amazon queen who
	eats her young; then I could
	keep you inside me,
	rolling you 'round the back of my mouth
	slowly, like a thought.
	I burn red-hot to see you
	draw close to another,
	one who will not lose you in her darkness.
	But I know darkness created the light
	before you and I gave birth to one another,
	and darkness will again swallow us.
	Although your after-birth rots in my memory still,
	I will carry you in dreams--
	through wars and adolescence,
	and your marriage to another.
	I was born to bear this sorrow,
	and I will continue to pain every year;
	as long as it takes your place,
	as long as this mother of a dead son still loves inside.

	(When I thought I lived alone, in air)
	I saw, mostly reflections. I learned,
	I learned at length
	To slow that frequency of shimmering
	and speed it up again at will.

	Useful, that. Submerged now,
	I see Sirens high, and 
	M! M's still spinning
	Priceless threads, pale honey to
	Catch the glances, hair, smiles

	I too will use. Because
	On "low" at last, humming,
	I float upwards, lost to gravity,
	Limbs dancing in light before
	The Buddha.

	They are brown

	I don't know why

	I guess I just

	Your other things are also
	different shades of brown.
	Mine are pink,
	more or less.
 
	You are called "yellow".
	I have trouble
	grasping this.
	You even tell me so,
	"I ama yerrow."
	and poking your finger
	into my chest,
	"You are a gwei-lo."
	(white ghost)
	I lay my arm next to yours
	on the sun streaked pillow.
	Sure enough,
	I am a ghost.
 
	But for gender,
	I thought we were the same.
	We spend the afternoon
	celebrating the differences.

	Life is a house of cards. (I thought.) Blow,
	Holy wind,
	On Sappho's oaks --  so his loves
	Imbricated me, all leafy smiles and glances.

	Don't breathe! His
	Gravity inverting
	(Eddington)
	Made light of my insight.

	Refractions then. Beaming
	Through water, a filigree,
	Gold threads through me shivered,
	Weaving on the sandy bottom. 
	White holes in Vermeer, Bonnard's unpainted patches,
	Left "Spaces in your togetherness"...

	Dried grass and three leaves adorn the lawn.
	Ruined temples to Gods long lost
	are strategically placed throughout the town.
	Ammo sings in the streets.
 
	Exiles are still an improvement.
	The burnings at twelve o'clock low have stopped.
	Under the sand, the grass, the growth so green
	it dazzles you.
 
	And you are alone... you've traveled here before.
	You know the path, well-worn, the road
	that goes to nowhere that you know of...
	the dream so strong the guilt now dim.
 
	Perhaps you'll return, in terms of commitments.
	Windy days seem lost without the magic of your words.
	The sounds pile up upon the scrapheap,
	I still try to touch the sky...
 
	My failing in your twilight your best hour your demise...
	my memories clash and run the steps that I would take for you...
	the only things I want to say.
	My words to tell you what it's like out there...
 
	Awaken at dawn for the light to come.
	You've known for a thousand years just what will pass...
	Compromise the truth scratch at the wall...
	Only pray that you can dream of home.
