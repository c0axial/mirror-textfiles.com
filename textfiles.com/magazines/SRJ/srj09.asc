	You have seen lions yes?

	slowly
	and how they approach one another
	when it is time
	with open mouths and recognizant mumbles
	and she rolls over for him
	and he paws her slowly
	with such care as goes for gentleness among their kind
	and when he bites her neck
	it is not hostility
	but the irresistible generosity
	of her loose hide.

		Men Seeking Women

	By grace of candle light
	and Chopin's Nocturnes

	Blythe scans the
	men seeking women

	for possible stories,
	but only

	men seeking women
	over five foot seven,

	just in case.
	In under fifty words,

	men seeking women
	lay their lives and longing

	paper thin
	in stranger's hands.

	By grace of candle light
	and Chopin's Nocturne

	Blythe cuts out a few
	men seeking women

	who are all
	over five foot seven.

	Blythe says
	"listen to this one"

	A nocturne ends,
	peeling away from her laughter.

	The candle has dripped
	blood-red wax

	on a few
	men seeking women.

        	wait a moment

        night changed to day
        with the turning of an eye.
        opening a shutter
        new light finds us caged,
        solemn or silly.

        hearts on our sleeves,
        we stir fingers through hair
        palm fire across arched bodies.
        we make a new night
        behind shutters, sealed and caged.

        a sudden burst of laughter
        speaks another's silence.
        your face and shoulders
        smile and shake.
        spare the joke and we'll move on.

        so somebody weeps
        and another's tears ebb;
        liquid in a limited system.
        shed a tear, one crocodile drop,
        and rid me of these oceanic eyes.

        empty breath flows from another's body,
        dragging life from a dying man.
        suck fast gasps past puckered tongues
        as newborns test lungs.
        in a moment they shall change.

	yesterday glued to the day before it.
	we scream to separate the sheets
	and spin, thoughts wild,
	casting for a glimpse of any when.
	an orange sun urges us to turn another page.

	wait a moment

        Its outbawlings, crooked finger
                  of the seawall,

        its outpourings, its invitations.


        And how it hammered flat
                  our moonlight,

        its metals,

                  roadlike.

	it occurred to me, lately
	that in between your spontaneous
	corruption of my perfect world
	with your honest tugging eyes,
	you might have kissed me! 

	or turned me on my back and rubbed me
	with your big, beautiful hands,
	or held me
	in an embrace of sorrow
	that told me that love was allright.

	but I forgive you,
	honestly - there is nothing but honesty
	with you, oh that part that reaches
	right in between my ribs and tugs 
	and says, ``you know me...

	When they ask to see your gods
	your book of prayers
	show them lines
	drawn delicately with veins
	on the underside of a bird's wing
	tell them you believe 
	in giant sycamores mottled
	and stark against a winter sky
	and in nights so frozen
	stars crack open spilling
	streams of molten ice to earth
	and tell them how you drank
	the holy wine of honeysuckle
	on a warm spring day
	and of the softness 
	of your mother
	who never taught you
	death was life's reward
	but who believed in the earth
	and the sun
	and a million, million light years 
	of being

 	 Covet this, she drives along tooling
	her sheath--it fits well
 	 and erotically lyricizes my lobes,
	Laves what skin of mine is bare,

 	 Nude--and covet I do. She's

 	 is afraid of know-not-what;
	She pretends not-knowing, only

 	 Serious--goddam! Those fucking

 	 Hard, two lovers' sudden sparked
	Orgasms; hurtful, she Laughs.
	
 	 Other cars frown at us, coveting.
	She fucks them all well; they
 	 veer away, seeking shelter.
	I had an accident in my pants,
	
 	 Please downshift! I yelled but the
	Wind grabbed my words as her mouth
 	 opened to swallow me, and still she
	Laughed, 'til the Wind was gone.

	I told him while the water was washing over us
	never to stop experience
	like this water
	just to be there while it washes over him
	and I held him to me
	as close as myself
	let it make you clean I said
	and he was crying
	because it hurts as if the skin is peeled back
	it could only be that kind of crying
	and I took his face in my hands and made him look at me
	as I told him against the stream
	that the other way is death.

		grotowski and his lovely poland
		-------------------------------

			(Jerzy Grotowsky, Polish director, founder of The 
			Lab Theatre, pioneer of theatrical psychotherapy.)

	grotowski, roaring through "Akropolis,"
	hinted
	at the source of his angst:
	"Poland, you see, is the largest graveyard in the world."

	aushwitz is now a headstone,
	and citizens can view names and dates,
	realizing their soil sings with millions of
	earth-choked
	throats.

	no historical dialogue can erase the thunder of
	blitzkreig or luftwaffe.
	goebbel's tap-dancing can still be
	heard
	over the roar of smelting plants.

	so.
	do we stop the world in our fair poland?
	eh?
	do we cease daily life and build more tombstones?

	no.
	we go on doing what we always have done before,
	it served our grandfathers through all kinds of facisim.
	even the modern kind,
	that seeks to bring all filth to the light
	of politically correct truth.

	but what of dear grotowski?
	he is in california now,
	holding encountergrouptheatretherapy in the mountains.

	far away from the singing
	boneyard
	that is his poland.

		Scorch and Burn
		---------------

       				Work is done, then forgotten.  Therefore 
				it lasts forever.
                					- Lao Tsu

	Past five o'clock, the time for reconciliation settles upon him
	as hard wings brush past. Wings meant for another,
	still near enough to startle into reflection.
	
	The countryside drapes over his life.
	He has spent hours picking through the folds,
	searching for everything that sank away.
	
	Topsoil has winnowed past, leaving a hard clay,
	red under nails and gray underfoot,
	for him to tunnel to himself.
	
	Spent tobacco overflows ashtrays,
	too much effort trying to internalize the land
	until it lay ravaged in him.
	
	A cough was the first sign of pregnancy, but the smoke warns
	of twins and triplets, spiraling up in fading wingbeats,
	hinting of hidden fires.
	
	As quarter to six approaches,
	the exfoliated plain is too barren
	for anything but rebirth.
	
	Time turns up a new soil.
	New seed eager to rise, crops waiting to climb.
	To reap.

	I wear it like a death mask
	Stolen from an ancient king's barrow
	Pallid
	No color
	Jaw clenched in the mockery of a smile
	A frozen scream
	A hideous laugh

	I use it as a weapon
	An axe to cleave what was joined
	A spear to pierce the unwounded
	I am not whole, why should you be?
	It is deadly poison, sprinkled liberally
	Would you like a glass of wine?

	I cherish it as a companion
	Always there when I am in need
	To be called on at a moments notice
	Faithful
	Of whom else can that be said?

		Ano Nuevo at Mating Time  
		------------------------

	If only the selky's stolen cries,
	(broken on the water and strained upon the dunes),
	could fire the mind with an imaged flame remembered
	in caves of savage mankind.
	Then more completely would I find identity in the
	wauling song that sets to rhythm these gale-beat thrummings
	which chaff my ears.

	Thus exhumed, the light of fires long gone
	would mark with hi-light tabs this roiling view
	which unlocks its own visceral thrill.

	Indeed.

	How simple are the frothing calls which cater to nothing
	but that which stays wildest even when standing
	the cross-town queue.

	This ghosting companion who holds himself aloof and Free.
	Free to wither a parting glance at cool sensibilities
	mouthing their hysteric complaints.

	Nurture proves to be heartlessly efficient.

	Here in this farthest reach of sand/sea/sky;
	we dangle an exploring finger toward the pooled chaos
	and watch as a terribly real fight transpires down the beach.

		Someday

	Highland pipes, mountain mist, and ancient

	Will the great heroes walk the earth again,
	Will great Cormac again be king?
	Ask if the desert will be blessed with rain.

        	The only answer is someday.

	Irish harps, emerald moors and old tales
        	remembered;
	Shall we ever see the old glories made new,
	Will the Pirate Queen ride the waves again:
	Ask if a stormy sky will ever be blue.

        	The only answer is someday.

	Gaelic chants, ancient songs, dance once more
        	on the tongue;
	Will they dance and repeat in future history,
	Shall Taliesin and Merlin make magic once more?
	Ask if a villian is ever remorsful.

        	The answer is the same, someday.

		In the Shape of Snakes, Our Bodies
		----------------------------------

	And as we were anonymous on a summer's hill
	You would think that we laid seige on one another-
	Lying as we did, in some immortal embrace
	With long dark hair curled over your milk face
	
	You brushed your hair away to mouth a phrase
	And told me that the stars
	Were rushing from each other
	I felt three times your age!
	Just the simplest of statements, and the stars exploded...
	
	It seemed like we were on the skin of a bubble
	bursting into nothingness
	while, up above, the shapes of men had named the stars.
	But, down below, the fields. And in this,
	dusk and perfection;
	In the shape of snakes our bodies carved.

		---------------------
		Some Days To Remember
		---------------------

	As when the great Lady herself
	Fell victim to the placid sea
	In what was otherwise a night
	Of silent starlit serenity

	And floundering in the cold waters
	Where no fish would dare to stray
	Were the faceless souls and voices
	Of that ever tragic day

	And near the lifeboats, all around
	Side by side, but all alone
	Were hands that had no raft to hold
	They were on their own

	Some slapping, splashing, {\it screaming!}
	For a paddle or a board
	And the louder they cried out
	The more they were ignored

	And soon they slipped beneath the shine-
	Their last eternal dive
	While not a single hand would reach
	To keep these men alive.

		In the Midnight Chill of a Winter Solstice
		------------------------------------------

	I remember two eager faces in the match-light
	sublimed in the trouble and rage of high school
	dances just let out...pretty girls, perfume and cologne
	intermingling.  We had a confidence, you might say a way
	with manners.  We kept aloof and found our solitude 
	in Blake and in Yeats.  Breathing the crackling fragrance 
	of clove cigarettes, our bodies shivered in the cold air.
	The thin sandy smoke was like silver in a street-light.
	The dull illumination of the rock-ridden mountainside,
	The faint blue stars, the cherries of two cigarettes,
	and the gold glittering of the midnight traffic below
	blasted our thoughts like a symphony and spoke
	to our minds a religion --- an enchantment of the beautiful...
	The cluttered clouds against the bare, black night
	glimmered with the brightness of the moon.  We felt 
	the dizzy hope of spirit enkindling our dreams.
	And from night to night we felt a constant surfacing 
	and resurfacing of something larger than us, threatening
	to smash to bits the entire order of all 
	that held us still.  As if we were the only two
	in a long time that ever dared to think these things,
	in those days we walked well dressed and in vain
	triumph. We quested after magnanimity--believing
	all our troubles and our fears could be dissolved
	with an subtle gesture or a sign.  I remember occasionally 
	a tear after gulping down that rusty smoke,
	would soak a ring around a cigarette,
	turn it yellow-brown, and then sizzle
	and vanish.  Again and again against madness 
	we tried to shake from ourselves --- to erase --- the cold ---
	to banish the unfeeling and the sleeping from our lives.
	What love did we imagine could master such vizardness?
	We sought out emblems from ancient Ireland
	and longed for ghosts within the landscape to come,
	to rise up and to teach us their secrets, songs
	and wisdom.  Staring at the darkness surrounding so
	many lights, we heard thousand thousand questions
	asked in the midnight chill of a winter solstice.

	Today I will follow you to the water
	and every day
	sit among stones with paper
	working my only magick and seeing
	you change fishlike abandoning
	the vague gravity of earth
	to water you are
	my most precious fish of salt and

		fragile thoughts, like bone white china,
		carved on tablets of stone,
		scattered around like errant rose petals.
	More beautiful than angel's wings.
	More precious than the treasure of kings.

		--------------
		Thumb Enclosed
		--------------

		{\it A thumb enclosed in a fist denotes a suppressed will.}

	Concrete's bitter sting:
	hewn stone and pavement sprout from seeded clay.
	Steel mountains bloom and hundred-armed poles
	climb through the ground, caught in flurries of emerald moths.
	Their wings flutter as countless hands
	wring their neighbor nervously.

		{\it The weaker will always look away first.}

	Animals lurk in the shadows,
	a chorus imposing deathly silence on otherwise empty sound.
	Organic automatons following an instinctive program,
	pausing to rewind when gears cease whirring and clicking.
	Then restart.
	
		{\it We'll always turn from the eyes of a stranger.}
	
	Restraining itself, the car urges forth on spinning legs,
	yellow cat-eyes scanning the darkness.
	Pinholes in the sky's shroud let through tastes of glory.
	The headlights illuminate only those patches of space
	directly before them as tunnel vision weaves down the road.

		{\it And I'll refuse to match your gaze, preferring
		the ambiguity of our relationship.
		Looking past each other's shoulders, eyes halved apart
		and tongues filling in the graves of fresh-spent words.}
	
	An enclosed thumb smiles against a moist palm,
	its nervous grin reflecting lines
	carved into the hand's tender belly.
