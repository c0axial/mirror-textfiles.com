	They took the wrong parts of me, my love.
	Oh, the Canon knew what he wanted: a boring revenge,
	very quid pro quo and Biblical of your uncle,
	to take from me what had offended:
	not quite the mote in his eye, but it served.
	
	But he could not take my heart, my mind or memory:
	and those live still.  The blood flows into them
	because it has no other destination:
	and it is still your blood, flowing
	through me now in lux perpetua, in memoriam.

		The Aviary: Midnight
		--------------------

	A desire wakens me.  Sounds -
	something like rain dying out - rise
	from the aviary beneath the bedroom.
	I hear the birds' dulling chatter.
	The brazilian cardinals and purple finches,
	aroused, sing to calm themselves.  Impotent,
	I have know the immunities of darkness,
	its coolness like the rain that relieves
	a fevered world.  My lover remains sleeping.
	The birds are calling me back
	to their own listless flight of sleep.
	My back touches her back; my ankle
	rests upon her calf.  If I turn to her,
	it is because a second world calls me.

	it only rains like this in august when the perseids 
	are falling.  when another year is disappearing.  
	you were born in the month of lovers leaving. 
	the month when the sky takes its steroids 
	and pushes up and pulls up and chins up and in the end 
 	pummels you with all the force of all the tears 
 	he wouldn't cry for you.  this is august.  
 	it only rains like this in august.
 	
 	in september he is gone.  leaves 
 	swing down from the trees 
 	skitter down the pavement.  
 	the rain puddles down to them and 
 	smooths them to the sidewalk.

	Go away. She is weary.
	She cannot be disturbed.
	Simone has nearly perished from pleasure.
	She really meant no harm, yet
	she drove him toward a difficult bargain.
	Can't you see it broke him? He claims to be numb.
	Why must you flinch at the first hint of madness?

	Please pose your questions carefully,
	or he will disappear.

	and I feel guilty that it is my fault
	that she is like this
	perhaps it is because of me
	when she calls my name
	and I do not know what she wants
	but I do not have it
	as she takes in the form of giving
	as if the tasteless food placed on the table in cracked dishes
	moved by the frail hands
	were a display of her poverty rather than of a good heart
	and I think to myself that she must be an actress

		Despair 1991
		------------

	The soft wildflower scented air
	mingles with his tobacco and old urine.
	Panic, panic, panic beats my heart, a		
	poisoning the beauty of the day.	

	His tongue, an old gray slug
	licks away at my innocence.  Though he
	is old and feeble, and I am young and
	strong, I am paralyzed.

	Guilt, guilt, guilt surges through my being	
	stealing away that microscopic shred of	too flat-out
	self respect that I had tucked away.

	In a burst of despair, I pull free and	
	run, run, run up the hill, through the
	buttercups and poppies, begging the air
	and the sunshine to wash away the disgust
	that my stopped up, locked in tears cannot.


	I sit on a sun baked rock and dangle my
	toes in the liquid silver song of the creek.	
	Light dances across the surface, lulling me,
	hypnotizing me, mercifully taking me away
	from my horrifying new discovery.
	I know now that it will never matter how big
	grow, something in me will not let me
	protect myself.  My body belongs 
	to everyone Very effective ending.
	but me.

	searching for a path from birth

	old scents return at the center of the park,

	to caress limbs woodenly as she

		----------------------------
		Central Park, February 1861: 
	            An American Portrait
 		----------------------------
	1
		
	It is a fetid skating pond.
	Frederick Olmstead's imperial vision sits beneath tissue
	on his workroom vellum, his budget frozen
	like the brackish ice before the promise of impending war.
	Squatters and beggars will fuel the Republic's salvation.
	Uprooted like the peat of Ireland,
	they rut with their animals in cholera shanties
	that surge and sway like drunken ramparts
	on the heights behind the awful pond.
	
	In Brooklyn, Walt Whitman, a newspaperman possessed
	by the demons of poetry and contradiction,
	lures home boys and girls who excite the nighttime streets
	with their squeals of release.  His verses
	are the scandal of the age, condemned from the pulpits,
	recited by his cabal of admirers: married women
	locked in weekly estrus with their husbands' butlers
	amid the fallen fortress of whalebone hoops.
	
	2
	
	On an overcast February afternoon,
	too late and gray to catch the best of the light,
	the photographer comes to the pond from the wrought-iron fronts
	of lower Broadway to test a new lens.
	He has seen 100 frowning virgin brides this past six months,
	a genteel stew of copulants taught that they must never move;
	and too often has been called in an epidemic summer
	to an undertaker's parlor to photograph the sorrow
	of another infant's corpse.
	Now he will gladly breathe the cold,
	find it bracing after the smothering reek of a City
	he dreams as an endless abattoir where dead babies
	cry and dangle from velvet-covered meat hooks.
	
	3
	
	The pond is a sensorium undreamt of
	even in ancient Rome: a common sewer and shitheap
	where the smell of squatters permeates the light;
	and, amidst raucous giggling, the wild motion
	of windblown scarves, hats and bonnets
	desperately grabbed for in the air, slipping bodies,
	and the razor scrape of iron on the ice.
	
	But for him today, the stench is the fragrance of forgetfulness,
	inhaled to the heart from a frozen dumping-pond.
	Erecting his tripod, he sees a young man
	openly clutching the breast--ample even beneath her winter cloak--
	of his lady-love, who laughs and squeals aloud,
	"Can'cha woyt anither hour, boyo!"
	It is a place without the artifice of gentility or conquest,
	only the energies of desire, of passions that burn through the cold.
	
	And then there are the two boys:
	accidents beyond the accidental swirl of bodies
	and the pigfarmer shanties on the heights behind:
	emerging from the maze and motion, the pair stop still,
	watch him at work, voices shouting
	"Hey, mister! you here for us, mister? make our tintypes, mister!"
	
	These are not dead, nor sacrificial.
	Through his lens, for 10 motionless seconds,
	the boys become part of the light,
	frozen on the plate, for him an image of his City,
	immutably young, forever taken out of Time.
	
	When the photographer dies in 1894,
	the skating pond where he stood
	has long since vanished, filled in and landscaped
	as a path for English-saddle riders and broughams.
	Clearing out his studio and workshop,
	his wife and daughters find the image of the boys.
	They are still smiling: they have never stopped,
	and the wife and daughters smile back.
	They could not have known:
	one of the boys had died in 1881
	in a Bandit's Roost knife fight over a woman.
	The other lives to a great age, dies in 1932,
	having forgotten everything
	even as he forgot the photographer
	as soon as he turned and skated off.
	
	4
	
	The motion continues, something convulsive at the heart,
	beyond the power of the lens: a terrible orgasm
	and overturning of the earth,
	the immolation and self-consuming resurrection
	contained in the seismic motions of the City itself,
	at every moment crushing, sweeping outward
	toward its merciless, unfinishable destiny.
	
	It rises and it writhes.
	Self-proclaimed Confederate spies camp in Prince Street saloons,
	buy drinks for Union officers invalided home after Antietam,
	proclaim Darwin a prophet, and pray aloud in his name
	for the death of the ape in the White House.
	
	Flags of the Grand Army of the Republic fly from City Hall
	while immigrant Irish mobs, driven from their land
	by chattelage and starvation decreed by Victoria's ministers,
	riot against conscription to the Civil War,
	and burn the living body of a free Negro.
	
	Whitman flees to the Capital, wanders the hospitals, dazed, 
	hears the crackbrained gibbers and cackles of gangrenous amputees:
	bathes their bodies, dresses their wounds,
	writes down their final letters home,
	and returns after Appomattox to a minor sinecure
	extended by a grateful Federal government.
	When the Calamus poems reveal his amatory tendencies,
	he is summarily dismissed, only to fade, disappointingly,
	into Respectability, the special hell of Sages.
	
	Olmstead receives the budget to build his Tuileries.
	His workmen, recruited from the shanties, plow under their homes,
	drive 14-year-old girls to stand in crimson silk under the gaslight.
	A drunken laborer drowns in concrete and Carrara marble
	when the foundation of Bethesda fountain is laid,
	and rests where he used to keep his pigsty.
	
	5
		
	The Park built, the City grows northward to devour it.
	The squatters' shanties are replaced and replaced again:
	mansions and museums rise where squatters	
	bred the shoulders of the building City.
	The Plaza Hotel comes to rest on the New York palimpsest:
	legend says that the first guests of the great house in 1907
	flee in horror and dismay because they can hear
	the ghostly copulations of the displaced squatters.
	Far downtown, beneath towers rising to entomb the past,
	the common graves of nameless Negro slaves
	undermine the Stock Exchange.

		Girl at the Hotel Exile
		-----------------------

	These Sundays I watch Father practice on the tennis court; it is
	an indulgence of his I humor. I like it anyway: the red, Hawaiian
	clay,

	the yellow balls, the white shorts, and the brown skin are movie
	colors. I drink Cokes. Life, I tell my father, is full of hotels.

	Mother takes the defeat hard, and she stays indoors, still cursing
	the effete generals and the communist students.  Now that I

	want to be an American, now that I wear make-up even though
	I am but thirteen, I buy sexy novels.  I read my family's story

	in The National Enquirer.  What I could tell would sell
	big: how Mother dances through the kitchen naked

	and drunk; how Father has taken to situation-comedies;
	how they embraced me after we arrived, after I had broken
	
	open my doll's head, revealing the tiny diamonds I had smuggled
	from the palace, Mother crying, "My Jewel, my Jewel."
	
	The story I know is something else. That my parents no longer love
	is nothing. Me, I am only watching them in this warm, American
	
	paradise. We are wealthy. I am not so young.  I know a boy
	at the swimming pool: his skin is browner than mine.

	The massive head, swollen with seeds,

	Wings brush the papery fringe of yellow

	Small black eyes watch me carefully. 
	The sunflower lolls its head in the August heat
	and the spiral seems to rotate, grow heavier,

	I have grown heavy too, giving birth,

	I wrote you a poem.
	I walked up to the pub this afternoon
	Complaining about my emptiness,
	How I had nothing inside of me.

	When I remembered
	Watching `Eugene Onegin' from Glyndebourne
	And Lensky going to his fatal duel,
	And how I had then used Melvyl
	
	In far-off California
	To determine your presence, while
	Sitting in Bath at my computer.
	So I wrote you a poem.

	I only write love poems.
	This one has to be circumspect.
	Something between Rabbie Burns
	And `The Ball of Kirriemuir'.

	I wrote you a long letter.
	You have all my news.
	And all my books.
	Here is your poem:

	2	

	I looked your family name up in Melvyl,
	the University of California Library Catalogue,
	seven million volumes.

	and there was your grandfather's dissertation
	from Leyden, 1911,
	title in unreadable Dutch.

	your father's and your mother's books,
	your cousin's novels in Holland.

	And finally your own little set of publications.
	I have only one book in California.

	Now I know you are back in London.
	Working away as ever with the children round you.
		
	It is good for you to be home.
	You must visit.
	There are twenty years and a dozen books to discuss.

          	High Tide at Midnight
 		---------------------

 	The island pines stood silent on the night
 	The moonless summer tide surpassed its height.
 	We slipped the tippy dinghy from the dock
 	And rowed across the stars' reflected light
 	With quiet slurp of oar and clunk of lock
 	To see the glassy blackness gulp the rock.
 
 	How shrunken, unfamiliar, was the shore!
 	Submerged were ledges lichen-dry before;
 	On foreign floating room our boat could pass
 	Down newly-liquid inlets, to explore
 	The shallow drowning of the roots and grass
 	By fingerlets of inky moving mass.
 
 	The world was full, suspended at the flood,
 	Convex, dark-bellied, an unbidden bud
 	Of fathom-vast unflowered force profound;
 	All nature seemed to sense it in the blood
 	And, trepidatious, uttered not a sound.
 	The crystal sky seemed closer to the ground.
 
 	I'd never known a higher tidal rise,
 	Nor seen such fascination in your eyes,
 	As if the moon, your sympathetic mate,
 	Had flexed its gravity, to your surprise,
 	Let slip a glimpse that made you contemplate
 	The pull of interplanetary weight.
 
 	We sculled the cove, cliff-lifted from the clay
 	That sucked our tar-pit footprints yesterday;
 	Our flash-light -- mirrored, filtered, dimly downed --
 	Diminished inconclusively to grey,
 	Then, gloaming-deep, the mooring-buoy found,
 	To surface yearning but to bottom bound.
 		
 	Spin-drifting, whispering, wondering on the grand,
	We rocked -- oh, how I pressed your pretty hand! --
	Then pulled against the Proteanic tide
	For cozy cottage, on our circled land,
	As, vortex in the void to either side,
	Galactic phosphorescence whirled and died.

  	Even if he shed skin and bone
  	And blinded them all)
  	Order without noticing
  	That the young blonde man
  	Cutting the bread
  	Has the soul of genius;
  	The cool light of perception
  	Intensifies his grey-blue eyes.
  	No, they're just waiting for the food
  	Served from the fingers of a poet.
  	
  	He would have been best 
  	As a British pilot during the
  	Big War. At dawn,
  	After some dangerous mission
  	He'd be sitting at a rough wooden
  	Table, drinking coffee
  	While watching the sun begin
  	To ease over the horizon.
  	He'd hold his warm cup with
  	Strong poet's fingers,
  	Golden light catching 
  	On his unshaven face.
  	
  	After cleaning the grill,
  	When things are quiet
  	At the end of the shift,
  	He mixes syrup, and milk
  	Into his coffee.
  	He drinks that while
  	The light begins to slide
  	Over the land. You know, he says,
  	I hate coffee.
  	I just like to watch the dawn
  	With the heat between my fingers.

 	a black squirrel
 	slices through the leaves

	he carries
	a green spiny thing
	hurrying away from me

	I have nothing to eat
	but no one to hide it from
 
	grey cars slide by
	they sound like rain

		three tenors

	but when, you asked
	yet when will when be?
	you see. it is like this  - i
	listened to three tenors
	three magnificent  magnificent
	magnificent vibrations from living chords
	which should be for what

	why three warm apples
	in the sun - i like cold fruit
	fresh from a pile of ice shavings
	crisp cool juice slowly dripping
	down my face   my breast
	slowly  mixing with my hot-sun sweat

	2

	i cannot deal with neapolitan ice cream
	too much  too much flavor
	give me placido   lento  vanilla
	pavarotti   como chocolate'
	and carreras of fresh strawberries

	3

	often i dream i am a silversword
	on the slopes of kilauea - just me
	a solitary silhouette in a field of sharp stones
	i listen to the cymbals of comets
	crashing on jupiter  - i am
	a nebula  blue shifted   red shifted

	i walk on a balance beam
	i am high cheekbones 
	ojos negros  piel canela
	in my veins run the blood of tenors
	asian - iberian - european
	singing the arias
	of a nebula

		Eine Kleine Nachtmusik
		----------------------
	 
	The drunk, on Seventh Avenue South, sways,
 	eyes searching for the focus with damaged sensors,
 	looks at us, slurring "Tha's
 	a beautiful girl you got there...sir":
	"sir" my sure barometer of the life still to come
 	because the word slashes me open in lieu of a razor;
 	and leans forward, extends his hands
 	in supplication, lowers his head at her,
 	staring cuntward, and begins to loudly croon
 	"Embraaaaaace me, my sweet embraaaaaaaaceable you"
 	in a whiskey-and-testosterone basso cantante
 	to make Melvin Franklin sound like Marlene Dietrich,
 	transfixing with bloodshot lab rat-eyes
 	and the message: not of Dom Perignon in fluted glasses,
 	drained at Twilight Time in the Afterglow of Love
 	by dignifiedly spent lovers,
 	but of the beast made with two backs
 	in a garbage dump beneath a yellow moon,
 	of willfully drowning in the Sea of Love.

 		the threefold music
 		-------------------
 	1 

 	breath on me, cricket-whispers!
 	gesturing in summer's heavy air -  at dusk	
 	in slow crescendo... evidence of brisk wind's song
 	on water.  Weird whip-poor-wills repeating,
 	winding through the constant
 	bleat of small frogs.
 	A Symphony.
 
 	2 

 	The sweet laughter mingling with lilted, echoed
 	phrases: politics & philosophy in Portuguese.
 	the swirling sound of foreign voices - 
 	small benchmarks of recognition punctuate 
 	strong flows of words between three friends:
 	praise, disdain, solemn vows & contemplation.
 	A Melody.
 
 	3 

 	rough-strewn epithets in English
 	amidst a backdrop of crackling glass.  Bottles
 	on rocks: a thick 'poP' to end the conversation.
 	A few young mouths, loud radios.  Murmuring
 	beneath the exchange, the solid throb of engines.
 	A Cacophony.

     Quomodo sedet sola civitas!
     Quenched are the eyes that lightened every street,
     silenced her step, her salutation sweet --
     gone is the city's glory, our gold all dross.
     Now comes the winter of our bitter cross.
     To us bereaved remains but to repeat
     cold litanies, and slow with mournful feet
     measure the vast vague outlines of our loss.
 	
    	O child, did I not too taste bitter death?
     My flesh, which you and she shared and adored,
     lay once in earth -- ah, I am rich with pity!
     Yes, mourn your loss, grieve deep, but know God's breath
     breathes where it will, and all shall be restored --
     I swear it, by my death! -- in spring's fair city.

		Hyde Park, Chicago:  Winter 1991
 		--------------------------------
		
 	Lonely crinkle of glass on
 	the street
 	Slick of ice, winter licks
 	the pavement
 	Trickle of slush in the sewer.
 	
 	Buzz of city lamplight
 	Hum and growl of cars with
 	tired suspension and cracked,
 	dried skin.
 	
 	Metered hissing, thumping,
 	quiet roar of music, voices.
 	
 	Cold wind, chapped lips,
 	salty, watery nose.
 	
 	Key slides in, skipping over the
 	tumblers -- turn, push
 	Creaking stairs and solitary
 	handrails
 	
 	Open, slumping
 	swivel chair blues,
 	curling smoke and dry,
 	dry martinis
 	
 	Droop the eyelids drop
 	and wintry air sneaks its
 	way in cracks,
 	open lightbulbs
 	stare at cobwebs, corners
 	dusty-bugs and water drips
 	in sinks.
 
 	Divide, conquer the sheets
 	and crown the pillow --
 	the kingdom slumbers,
	the army sleeps.

	the rains have come 
	to stay this season
	streetlights swim upstream
	struggling in the current
	that gushes through
	the iron grates

	a bird shivers alone
	black against 
	the bruised sky
	but i have
	turned my face
	to the smothering sun
	finding warmth

	In my mind's eye, I see

	with dust and wind
	a hummingbird
	a whistling blur
	darts in to suck the nectar
	of sweet chaos, startling
	the timid soul within.

	we sat with saki and sushi
	swapping sex theories and fantasies
	then we toasted tired debauchery
	as i listened to my friends - and i 
	listened carefully because they were buying the saki
	and pouring it too
	but my main concern of the moment was
	getting my sufficient share of that seaweed paper 
                          and green horseradish
	- oh how i love the dainty trinket food - wrapped up so
	neatly and organized like the 
	clockwork and conformity of mitsubishi factory workers
	
	when the last little ceramic flask of saki 
                          was finished - plates cleared - 
	we agreed that sharon had very nice thighs
	and that i had a very attractive nose
	and that pat looked better without his mustache
	then we made a tentative agreement with our last cup of saki
	that sex between us three that evening might be a
	pleasant bonding experience
	we paid our meek polite and always happy waitress
	then left

		Transience

	You never knew
		or so I used to tell myself
	how little I really slept
	most nights I slept with you.

	And as the morning blues 
		so similarly the sky 
		where I am now 
			so many miles away

	I feel the same impatience 
	with lightening blue.
		Lying then, while the sun
			stole again

	another good evening,
		watching, all the more
		closely you
				sleep

	I'd stretch the minutes
	with concentration
			and feel the same
		as then, here now

	against the morning sky
	that ticks, to me
		insistently away
		night and dreams,

	if not sleep,
	to the inevitable
			harsh
			alarm.

 		White Autumn, Bare Autumn
		-------------------------

	Let us return, 
	and hope to discern
	the concern that you showed to me 
	when the branches were bare
	as we lay in the grass 
	and let the sky shadows pass
	over us and all that was there
 
	Let us revisit the falling of the ashes
	and the quiet turn of your lashes
	which you held closed over your eyes
	when the fire between us burned
	through the loneliness of the dark
	and the twisted passages of the heart 
	until one of us put flame to what we had learned
		 
	Let us reconsider the reason
	why that warm season 
	seemed much more deserved
	to the starving who dare
	to change the conventions of passion
	and consume the vagaries of fashion
	which now seems a little more fair
 
	Summer for us lay down and slept
	and through the silence of August the two of us crept
	onto the pale skin of Autumn, as it breathed and awoke
	and all over the land it extended its cloak
	Shrouding us in snow, and stealing our worth
	and the weight of our stillness finally driving us to earth
 
	White autumn, bare autumn
	The snows have moved us apart, now
	 
	And now it's winter
	and I understand nothing.

	The leaf, the star, the lighted moon and me,
	Connected by the strings we cannot see.

	A bird, a plume, the pen with which I write --
	Her feather puts my thoughts down for the night.

	A warm breath atomized by winter's frost
	In individuality is lost.

	When the Green man
			began to hum
	The mockingbirds complained and flew.
	But then he screamed,

		"You've hurt me and I am undone!"
	
	And they thanked him for a song they knew.
	He's quite certain now,
			he'll never understand.
	Spends his time meandering ...
	Green man pandering ...
	Rearranging rented cubicles
	And puzzling scraps of paper
			into different fitful views.
	
	"No, that's not the way it was ..."
	
		"How was it then ... more twisted?"
	
	"God knows! I don't ... nor do I know why
	Those mockers keep on squawking."
	
		"Stay! Stay! 
		On the ground little hummingbird,
			You're much too small to fly!"
