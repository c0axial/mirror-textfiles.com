Travel Advice

                a word of advice
                there will be times
                sunrise over the Ganges
                slap of wet slap washing slap
                rams wailing loincloth devotions
                powder into your mind cannon
                arms around a backpack
                there will be no-one to touch
                no-one to tell
                the film is not important
                you must be a poet
                of the moment

angels + angel, a poem for the misinterpreting reader

          today the ineffable angels press ever closer around me
          wavering, howling calls of wild electric fires
          away afar all around my cliff-dwelling.

          a different angel, an angel of unwavering kind
          summoned me, voice sullen with news, then wavered.
          
          did so when i said, will you still?  and the angel said
          in zen:  i love you.  talk about communication gaps...
                
          it's the cold that makes the howling angels bold.
          they move closer.

          my angel's hot remorse gives off a twin sodium line sign,
          a harvest of gold a touch like the other angels' torching:
                
          i think i might street?  should i avenue?  would i drive?
          could i place?  need i pee oh box?  give you up for dead

          end?
                
          don't fret so much angel, love.  look at things this way:
          an angel hasn't flickered until showered in smooth shudders,
          skinned in swarms of warmths.  you have serious angel merit
          badges to pick up, angel.  with a slick load-bearing groove.
                
          the other angels, the ones howling bone china-hard flicker
          now rising as flame over the fires of lights -- i merely
          glance at them, peripherally take them in.

          you, at you i look more closely.
          now, about that life of ours.  in sin.

Contracting

                "Well, try it again," he said, dismantling
                the second floor. He sighed, wiping sweat
                from his eyebrows, and reached
                into the tool crate for a handful of words.
                Laying two phrases crosswise, he hammered
                them to the first floor with a verb.
                And then cursed.
                Capricious nature had warped the words
                through rain and sun;
                they joined only oddly.

                No sigh this time, a real grunt
                as his tired back heaved until
                the phrases came 
                loose
                and the whole first floor with them,
                a pile of nouns, verbs, adjectives
                twined like licorice. He fell, himself,
                on his rump, face reddened in the setting sun.
                He kicked a dangling participle.
                It splintered.

                "Ah, hell," he said at the sight,
                "I'm too tired to rebuild it right."
                A little dejected,
                he rose and erected 
                a quick limerick for the night.

untitled

                Late at night I am afoot
                amongst the flowering plants
                because I seek to discover
                where butterflies sleep

Roots


                Refusing to be my father,
                I wandered San Francisco,
                looking for streets from family stories.
                Lost in fog, I found where my grandparents lived,
                where my grandfather cut stone,
                the post office he built,
                the pool hall where he won a billiards championship.

                I wasn't sure whether I was
                my grandfather or Henry Miller,
                drinking wine on Mission Street curbs,
                patronizing Tenderloin hookers,
                reading obscure literature in the public library.
                I sat on the cliffs at Land's End 
                watching waves crash over rocks--
                I was Richard Henry Dana.
                Or Melville.
                I would have been Rimbaud
                but, by the time you discover him, you're always too old.

                I was twenty-three
                when my parents visited.
                Mother wanted Chinatown, Fishermen's Wharf.
                I showed them North Beach
                where I was Kerouac.

                At the Palace of the Legion of Honor,
                Father--an Okie who laid bricks, didn't read--
                touched a sculpture,
                rounded the curve of a dancer's frozen pose.
                I saw his hands were like Rodin's
                and I knew who I was.

Moving Song

          Let me wrap this crystal ornament in velvet, many turns
          in swaddling softness for the journey,  as the setting sun adjourns
          this phase of light, this time of feeling, concentrated till it burns.
          It must be packed away in silence, cushioned well against concerns.
          On any journey, often little things go wrong.

          This is a delicate memento made of glass, reflecting glints
          of captured sun from more than one or two 
          who warmed me.  There are hints
          of frequent handling, careless holding, 
          fracture lines and finger prints,
          but never once has fear of being broken up been this intense,
          a sense of frailty in me, frighteningly strong.

          Will you believe me when I say that you are never far from me,
          and what I put away is not your image, or your memory?
          Yet I must separate myself from this harmonic sympathy
          before these piercing, sweet vibrations shatter all serenity...
          but I will promise not to stay away for long.

milkweed

            a thousand clamourous birds have come to feed 
            then rise as one amoeboid shade 
                    against the  pallid height
                            in black on white

                    west along the ridge beside the farms
            basswoods raise their naked arms 
                    into the cherry light 
                            to block their flight

            a reach of sterile pool holds back the sky
            perversely so would you and I
                    denying cold and bright
                            the coming night

            and fearful we draw back avoiding still 
                    the spines of ice that creep and chill
                                    beneath the darkening hover
                            then cross over

                    when, plucked and shaken by a fickle air
            the milkweed cockles launch 
                    their fair intrepid squadrons back
                    in white on black

They Teach Children

                I am afraid of being eaten
                she said
                whispering.

                I am afraid of ravens coming to pluck out my eyes
                beating blackly as night howls of mad wolves
                and crimson jackal laughter.

                I am afraid of lightning piercing;
                a flaming sword set ward across
                my secret Garden.

                I am afraid that it will swallow me whole
                and all that is me will be engulfed
                in screaming
                and I will be glad.

                She huddled small
                a child in woman's body
                and careful drabness could not hide
                a lush and terrible wanting.

                I am afraid.

Breakfast under Africa

                Africa is like
                washing up gloves to me

                it always has been
                shruggy why

                maybe that rubber
                smell in mornings when

                orange kaffirbooms
                are spiny and disney

                i call them my t-rex trees

                breakfast this morning
                in whos shoes and
                potato jeans was
                two oranges some coffee
                and a
                storm long

                a photographic sky
                as flashy as anger

                with beatrice the
                sexy cat
                white blowey
                on the wall

                There is foreigness
                in africa

                not slitty conrad
                deceit

                but the foreigness of
                long stretch driving past wheat
                and wimpys

                Solitary musing on the steps
                of a sky

                under africa

                never felt
                so good

                I dreamt all night
                of david.

Fall Magi
 
                There was a day when I came
                        to you with gifts: a wreath
                                of twisted vines, some
                                pieces of cinammon bark, a
                                very sticky pinecone, and a rusty
                                   nail.
 
                In return you gave only open
                        open eyes and the sweet
                        breath of the earth from
                           your breasts.
 
                And now, not even with the
                        tartest of lemons or
                                the palest of flowers
                                   could I repay you.

Reliquary

                Carry me in a charm
                about your neck, a
                strand of hair, a
                tooth, a spot of dust.

                Toss me in a
                cerebral ocean, to
                wallow a few
                decades longer.

                Carve me in granite,
                pink and enduring,
                and plant me in
                a garden with
                daffodils and mud.

                Catch me in dye
                and silver specks,
                and keep me in
                a frame upon the
                window sill.

                Scan me into one
                hundred thousand sintered
                dots, and store me on
                magnetic film.

                Do this in
                remembrance of me.

THE FATHER #3


                He's told me
                that the ex-wife
                lets him take their daughter
                out alone for walks
                in their city.
                I imagine him holding
                her pink soft small cheek
                to his: large, scarred, scratchy.
                Once, walking in my city,
                I looked upon a building
                and voyeured into a window:
                a young father dancing
                with his child in arms.
                I wonder if this father
                jigs in the street,
                a music to celebrate.
                _Enjoy the trice_,
                the musicians say,
                _enjoy the innocence._

No room


                Since words between us come to blows
                I will send silence instead
                wrapped in small packages which speak music
                and have no room for misunderstanding.

Im a poet and yore not

            o i feel like writing a funny poem
            but i really don't feel too funny
            and i sure as hell can't think of anything to say
            that's worth saying
            because not much is
            at least not by me

            i could talk about some deep
            issue
            some big emotional anti-abortion environmentalist
            gaggledeegee
            but i really don't think so
            i really don't give half a shit about
            that shit

            surprisingly enough,
            i thought all poets were faggety
            art-bamboozled
            gabbleblotchits on a lurgid
            bee

            see
            you can tell i'm a poet because i never capitalize
            jack shit
            and i'm allowed to say shit and shit
            because of my artistic freedom
            and i'm just too cool to ever end a damn sentence
            cuz i'm a poet and yore not

            wait a second
            check this deep shit out:

            the birds  fly over ]
                the sky and
                    the sky is blue and purple and pink and mauve

            damn that was deep
            alack for my deepness
            and the deepness of poets in general
            if you didn't understand it then
            you must suck pretty badly

            it's amazing how poets can get away with this foozled shit
            it sure makes it much easier to write meaningless bullshit
            it's really funny when scrubs try to say that you are
            talking about some deep shit or tried to do something deep

            people are too impressed with their intellects
            these days

            back in my day you wouldn't see a bunch of faggety-assed art freaks
            trying to analyze our poetry
            no sirree bob
            we talked about chopping wood and life on the old homestead
            and shit like that
            but mainly about chopping wood
            which is a real man's poem
            we also used to complete our sentences in my day
            and we used punctuation too.
            but nowadays
            everybodys too trickified for that crap
            cheese bubbles dominate the landscape


            dang
            hot damn
            sheet
            take it billy

_Triptych_

                Sense          Her              Near you
                Her            Heart beats      Quickly
                Trembling      For you          Hold her
                Love her       Like the stars   Forever
                Lost in the    Shine            In her eyes
                Caress         Her face         With great tenderness
                You share      Smiles           She holds you
                With Love      With Love        With Love.

already?

                no   no   it can't be
                here    already
                splashes of reds and golds
                dazzling against red-rich canyons
                burning a thousand shades of green

                my summer shoes are not ready
                to be put away
                not willing to jump into piles
                of ready-for-scuffing leaves
                not ready to tumble
                into sedona tones of mellow
                pink-reds of maples
                golds of sycamore and cottonwood

                i still have crowns
                of white daisies to weave
                and billowing dresses of cotton lace
                to dance in
                on full-moon summer nights


                air so warm  so
                assuringly   caressingly warm
                cools  like a lover's
                absent-minded kiss
                it can't be here already
                i am not ready to cry
                or say goodbye
                just not ready
                to break
                                away

En la Plaza Dam

                La generacion de los son~adores
                Con la guitarra y el verso
                Siguio buscando las sen~ales
                Que les abrieran el universo.

                Se marcharon caminando
                Con la mirada cansada
                Recogiendo los pedazos
                Que se les caian del alma.

                Muchos no regresaron
                De este viaje misterioso
                Se engancharon a una estrella
                En un dia de reposo.

                Mas, otros siguieron las campanas
                De mil iglesias agudas
                Bebiendo las palabras
                Como gotas de lluvia.

                Y el universo se abrio
                Crujiendo como pan caliente
                Dejando un rastro de pasas
                Y lagrimas de sal de la gente.

Overrated

                Don't bother me with sex, sweet muse;
                your titillation's overused.
                Romantic love is overrated
                treacle and won't leave me sated.

                The moon in June is nice enough,
                why spoil it with that spooning stuff?
                The stars above are sharp and bright,
                why paint them with this pensive blight?

                Infatuation, go away.
                I've better things to do today.
                Romantic love is overratee
                treacle and won't leave me sated.

                ...she knows the colors' names
                and the hues they sing through
                i close my eyes
                and listen to her

                i can't tell
                between
                a color and a neighbor

                to talk of blue
                is to ignore
                societies
                of reds and greens
                and my smooth greys

                black to white the greys
                last all day

                so i close my eyes
                and the girl who knows the words
                colors my world
                in pastels
                                       (she taught me that word, pastels
                                       (soft . afternoon . diffusion
