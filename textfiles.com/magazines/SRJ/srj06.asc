little clouds with arms and legs

		little clouds with arms and legs
		sometimes a single diaphanous souffle
		nimbi florid with the golden flesh of sun
		how to measure perfect blueness

		there is a land, there is a land

		hardly anything grows there
		but wildflowers shrubs and rocks
		these rocks have been growing old for ages
		petroglyphs are dimly flowering yon
		and dave loves kim across the coyote
		and mary loves sam across the anasazi warrior
		and the crushed aluminum can loves no one

		here they come, here they come

Troth

		Nothing that you loved
		could make me hate you.
		Nothing you believed   
		could shake my trust.
		Nothing that you are 
		could push me from you very far.
		I will not go unless you say I must.
		Even so, I'd linger on the outskirts
		around the long-lost realm of love and light,
		haunted, ever haunting your horizon,
		just visible to telescopic sight.

ash swamp road
		
		an oblique cut.  a stop sign.  a lilac or two.
		ash swamp road opens up and beckons you.
		
		in the green shade as the dark trees kiss
		over the road
		you hear whispered the stories
		of a time ago
		when the land was free of scars and
		the pinpricks of telephone poles
		when the people who lived here
		lived simply
		lived in harmony
	
		i have yet to listen to the ash swamp road.

blue with brass quartet

		it might be midnight winter solstice and it might
		be cold, a blue that burns on cheekbones
		and the stars flare bright and fiery
		and all the gin in me is warm. i am singing
		in the street, i am light, empty, and the wind
		slips through me.  i slide away, turn liquid,
		float into the darkness.  i am everywhere and my arms
		embrace all the invisible people
		that i love because i cannot see them.
		every clear warm drop of me is falling
		into the sky.
		
		or it might be the middle of an april afternoon and i
		am sober as a rock polished smooth by an overflowing stream
		people are everywhere thick on the ground
		it makes them less lovable and now the air
		is blue as the sound of trumpets once more triumphant
		as winter yields spring.  i want to lie down
		and drink in this day, or paint my bedroom
		ceiling in this resounding hue.  it pulls me up
		until i sing again.
		
		and it might be that across the bridge, bare bushes
		with green laquer creeping on the bark, are moving
		to the silent beat.  are singing too.

II. It seems that I prefer what you prefer

		It seems that I prefer what you prefer
		and love the things you love, as tenderly.
		So, since your heart has settled so on her
		and called her dear, so she must be to me.
		It never has been difficult before,
		but now I see my own unworthiness
		in failing to consider your joy more
		and my own greedy hopes and feelings less.
		So, though it put my friendship to the test,
		I shall hope for the best in your affairs,
		and dearly love your love at your request,
		and set her name among my evening prayers.
		But do not introduce us for a while,
		Till I require less fortitude to smile.


V. Grande-dame, will you please show me what you clutch
	
		Grande-dame, will you please show me what you clutch
		so firmly in your ice-arthritic hold?
		I lately feel as if I'd aged as much,
		my heartbeat slowing, surface growing cold.
		What desiccated flowers have you kept
		in secret books of dreams, with caution pressed
		between the pages, broken petals swept
		into the drawers and cupboards of your breast?
		I know you are not mindless, as they think.
		I could be your contemporary, wise
		because of my own pain.  Teach me to sink
		into that secret place behind the eyes.
		And all who look will see an awkward pair,
		but we will be consoled and never care.

Gift

		it is the rain
		of a hundred years
		pummeling my umbrella
		like a wet banner in the wind
		lashing  my psyche
		to bleeding ribbons
		cold. wet. empty.
		till i opened the mail
		full of fireflies
		from a summer night!

License to Kill
		    	 	

		Eat worms and die,
		I think to myself;
		as the red&white bobber
		slaps the surface 
		and the poor worm
		with a #4 hook
		shoved up his ass
		till it pokes out his face
		splashes down
		with a satisfying splunk.

		A dozen took 
		the proffered annelidans;
		At home I heat the oil
		in black cast iron, 
		after washing guts 
		from hands 
		that learned 
		this ichthycidal game
		quite young.

Goedel

		So rich was logic's formal soil
		that the sturdy arithmetic groves
		(old stoic atheistic Russell's harvest)
		produced such a preposterous fruit:
		noumenal seed of which, though it might
		be named, shall not be reaped or sewn.

BALANCE

		words are cubes of ice
		"that which is"
		a golden ball
		that hides in circles
		of careening seasons
		slowly snuffs
		the sputtering spark
		this self
		fanning it to flame
		incense of its consumption
		spiraling prayers into heaven
	
		it isn't *words*
		that reach God's ear
		only poets suffer
		the utter madness
		of trying 
		to balance one
		upon the other

two crows mean joy

		sitting on the grass
		a smooth, green slate
		that tickles my behind

		birds. i feel their anxious glances
		toward winter as they hunt and peck
		across the wide summer lawn

		near the trash can by the path
		perches the pair in question:
		preening plumange and postulating

		i watch the crows-- do they feel joy?
		looking for something i may have missed,
		they clumsily take to the air

		fly crows, fly
		fly to your joy
		i will try to fly

		to mine.

Dump Him Ditty

		My girlfriends think he's 
		sweet as cane,
		my Marky, Marky Maypo.
		We wonder why she
		humped him, dumped him,
		chucked him out the door.

		She stacks her lawyers
		for the fray,
		alack, alack a day.
		Oh, why'd she have to
		love him, leave him,
		silly, chilly bro.

Cheater
 
		we three 
		laughed like lovers
		devouring one another
		with wayward glances
		an island within
		a rose hue circle
		scented in rain

		I loved her for loving you
		my friend, but
		even then her eyes
		were constricting pits
		focused in the distance
		she peered outside seeking
		a beast riding drum beats
		through the heart of the jungle

		her plane ascended in gray
		bound for the black soil
		of Costa Rica
		gold band sliding 
		out of sight

		at night she played 
		the taught streched skins
		of indian men
		sweat swirled 
		into her navel
		drowning memories of you

Tiny fish
 
		Not something you can grasp
		I will stay with you a little while
		like the tiny fish near shore
		which flash silver
		and are gone.

Bluebells

		There are no bluebells where you are
		so I send you memory of them
		see
		they are growing right over there
		no...to the left of the door
		quietly hidden in shyness.

Dona Juliana

		Striding downtown in her red and gold knickers
                With black boots that clomp to the trucks and the traffic
                Dona Juliana sports no smile
                and her tousseled hair bounds to the four winds.
                
                But then a cloudy man crosses her reverie
                And a she pulls a smile from her back pocket. 
                
                She dusts off the memories and the dull spots,
                Garnishes with spots of scattered scrapbook innocence.
                And she keeps the child's voice
                And she pops open the wild wide eyes.
                A third-rate man? 
                A first-class gent? 
                It makes no difference.
                Dona Juliana sees only this:
                Little boys and their big toys
                Looking for a playmate.
         
                Once rough players only she used to find.
                Now she can see the Don Juan signs
                Of too much familar eagerness
                Like great dane puppies who don't know their own strength,
                And maul with great oral fixations.
                
                Through many playmates and many checkmates
                Advice is bound to come:
                `Look only for the cloudy weathered ones.
                They need a burst of the sun.'

clean

		i
		sink myself-
		mascara rag,
		beneath
		the eyelashes
		of the
		shower.

		swamp the salty
		dandruff
		of
		fish tails and
		hairclip scales
		from my head.

		wax fancy
		fragrances of
		surgeons and dreamy diners
		from my eyes.

		i floss the freishas
		from my teeth,
		scrape your face from
		my back -
		control my damaged
		ends with
		conditioner.

		no conditions.
		no control to damage.

Fundamentalist
 
                It is hard to think there is no hand behind it all,
                chess-piecing us through versatile maneuvers.
                Here I thought that I would never see your face 
                again in life,
                and here you are, just when your presence is a 
                necessary move.
                There must be someone to be grateful to,
                but in His structured absence,
                I will beam on you, you curly-headed
                queen's knight calling out, 
                Can that be you?
