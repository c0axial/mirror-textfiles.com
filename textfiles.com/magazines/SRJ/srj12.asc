  Welcome to the Sand River Journal.  Our goal is to provide a proper setting 
for some of the better poetry posted to the newsgroup rec.arts.poems.  We aim 
at an objective standard, if such exists for poetry, but also strive to include 
diverse voices, not excluding our own work.  We regret an error made in the
initial posting of the ascii version of this issue (labeled "Christmas 1994"). 
A poem by E.L. Van Hine was inadvertently excerpted as it had first appeared in 
rec.arts.poems, instead of being reproduced in its entirety.  The error does
not appear in any PostScript document; this corrected ascii version of Issue 12 
replaces the earlier version in our archives. 
  Sand River Journal is posted in ascii and PostScript formats to r.a.p and 
related groups, and is archived at etext.archive.umich.edu/pub/Poetry.  It 
is composed of poems previously appearing in our newsgroup.  The PostScript 
version features high-quality typesetting and is well worth printing to 
hardcopy and sharing.  Poems appear by authors' permission and constitute 
copyrighted material; we claim ownership only to any poems we have authored.  
Special thanks to Jenn Hemphill and Karen Tellefsen for helping to solicit 
poems for this issue.  Enjoy!

		----------------------
		A field guide to birds
		----------------------
 
	Below the wide window of the dining room
	is spread the slant roof of the well-house.
	The previous owners kept cracked corn there
	through twenty winters, and the birds
	came to rely on it. We thought they ought
	to live more wild, and so we did refrain
	awhile. The birds came to the empty roof
	and stood about, cranking their small heads
	to look with first one eye and then the other
	into the house; had their gods abandoned them?
	I stopped by the seed and feed, and picked up
	a ten pound bag. A handful on the roof
	brought instant jubilation. Each day
	first come the juncos in their black hoods,
	perched taut and wary in the lilac bush; then
	one by one they dart for a choice bit
	and retreat, cracking and dribbling hulls.
	They are followed by field sparrows in red
	caps, and rose-colored purple finches.
	Black-capped chickadees appear when these
	have gone, and heavy-bodied mourning doves
	crash and scatter them, and bob like gulls
	on a green beach. None can dislodge the doves
	but jays: scrub and Stellar's. I tell
	the children of the habits of jays, stealers
	of eggs, bullies. The middle child hates
	injustice, and claims he will shoot the jays,
	so I tell him a story: in Georgia, when I
	was young, I watched a cat catch a robin.
	The robin fluttered and cried, and the cat
	clamped down, muscles bulked. A mockingbird
	flew low and strafed, and the cat missed a hold.
	The robin crawled off, trailing breakage.
	The cat pounced again. The mockingbird
	perched nearby, screaming. A male cardinal,
	biggest I had ever seen, parrot-bright,
	flew in from nowhere and landed, wings outspread
	almost in the cat's face, and began,
	one wing down, the dance of bird mothers
	who hope to divert cats from nestlings.
	The cat dropped the robin and went
	for the cardinal, missing by a whisker.
	This was repeated many times, but the robin
	was dying, so the cardinal had in the end
	to give it up. But I have never forgotten
	that strange unequal battle, and a bird
	that would so risk life for another species.
	The boy seems unimpressed. I add: the cardinal
	is a jay. He gets it: life is not so simple
	as its known and quantified habits. Out there
	on the well-house roof, or in our own lives,
	or anywhere, bad we can expect, but good,
	if rare, comes also, and so we scatter 
	seed, and then sit by the window and wait.

     	The last hitchhiker before town,

     	*Galway, Ireland? Is that what you mean?*
     	As he leans through the cocked side-window
     	an inch-to-the-mile map spreads from his side
	
     	and a long, dirty fingernail pierces a bay.
     	Yes, I like the cut of you, hitchhiker, hijacker,
     	you may lay your backpack inside my hatchback,
     	let your sleeping-bag roll on the back-seat
     	as the exhaust-pipe opens its flyblown parachute.
		
     	One by one, the road-signs flicker by
     	and we sleepwalk under the skin of a car,
     	passing the lay-by, the drive-in eatery,
     	the scrapyard where lifting-cranes
     	scrunch up spent engines
     	and a bald-headed man pursues with vigoour
     	the hare-lipped, shirt-tailed assassin.

          	untitled memory
          	---------------

     	my earliest recollection:
     	watercolors dabbed haphazardly
     	about a paper napkin.
     	that day the blurred horizon
     	had no vanishing point - a sky of suns
     	that danced in a circle,
     	singing songs I could no longer remember.
     	in my bow tie and Sunday shoes,
     	I never cried when I was told.
     	the birds were silent then,
     	hovering above while I counted each one.
     	they had no names, yet they all knew me -
     	they watched while I played in the sand after dark.
     	they scattered when my name was called,
     	the floodlight's reflection still shimmering
     	in the pool on the other side of the fence.
     	inside, the halls were narrow,
     	casting shadows at impossible angles.
     	I stared at my fingers
     	while water washed the sand away,
     	a clockwise swirl against the blue porcelain.
     	then, the long march.
     	fighting sleep, the contours of night
     	assembled behind the billowing curtains,
     	laying the toy soldiers to rest.

     	it was like rain.  though the writer from cosmo says
     	falling in love is like falling in a puddle
     	last night it was like falling rain.
	
	like this:  it is a sunday in july and i am under an awning.
     	i am dry but the yellow sky--
     	the yellow yellow sky--
     	it deceives me and i leave my awning to find dew
     	on my skin in my hair on my eyes.
     	it fills the yellow sky and i am wet.
     	this is rain.

     	and that is how it came.

     	I bade my love lie down amidst
     	the purple amaranth
     	and keep her troubled soul at rest
     	from heartless circumstance.
	
    	How gently did I wipe the drops
     	of dew that were her tears
     	and round her, I enwrapped my arms
     	to comfort all her fears.

     	My heart thus died a trembling death
     	resolving not to kiss her,
     	I pressed my lips into her hair and
     	voiced a sorrowed whisper.

     	My love, my love, weep not for us.
     	Be not o'erly vexed.
     	While in this life we cannot love
     	We surely will the next.

          	The Space Age
          	-------------

     	Bony sidewalk was our daybreak gangplank,
     	humming launch pad, historic surly speedway.
     	Brother's chalk was a hacking cough
     	of hieroglyphs and racing stripes.
     	When crayola failed us, we'd just roll over,
     	surprising the numb-still grass.
     	
     	It was the space age:
     	We kept an eye
     	on the powder sky
     	for satellites and sudden flashes.
     	The tiniest metal jets drew rigid lines,
     	floating from the west--we turned
     	
    	them into messages from
     	the rounded silver future.
     	We didn't read mythology.
     	We had our own versions of magnificence:
     	TV test patterns, invisible Russians,
     	the suburban planners' sleepless grid
     
     	and the prayers of every
     	white-coated Sunday morn.
     	Our busy boy-silences pounded the sidewalk
     	more superbly than any book could promise ...
     	Then one time
     	the blanketed vet across the way

     	dragged by in the morning orange,
     	a melting detonator in his head,
     	doing the mental math it took

          	Counting Past a Few
          	-------------------

     	People puppets dangle on pretence
     	Hollow, wooden, mute, mastered by the hands
     	Who irrigate this paper world with word
     	And sketched pools of politic:
     	Boiled essence of a way to be, a line:
     	Countless dots drawn in a necklace
     	Of strung desires.
	
     	      The audience sit staring through the voiceless shells
     	      To the people within, unaware of their skeleton slavery.

     	A cloth of unmade rooms makes the stage
     	A waiting cloak ready for embrace.
     	These puppet players are the days
     	Of a strangling season, ripe with the lines
     	Of breathing anathema.

     	      Caressed by the coat of darkness on their eyes, weaving
     	      A dose of dialogue to tame their ears to sleep, bleeding.

     	"In all your pavement days you will meet me
     	At obscure distance seen through your paranoid eye,
     	Felt by your muffled hand. My saying herd and
     	Flock of looks come to shave your fields bare,
     	Teasing leaves from hanging hope and roots from water.
     	You are rough to my feel, feeling with your hands,
     	Dry to my taste, sucking with your mouth, against
     	My every grain you are the driving plough. I am
     	The way to live, the life to lead, the death to die,
     	The body of fashion, patron saint of people.
     	I am the one who weighs your weightless dreams."

     	"Drink my poison, feel my fist,
     	The days are never more wasted than when they live with me.
     	Your words wither in my barren land,
     	Darkness is never more dull than in my shadow.
     	All your knowing, all your thoughts
     	Turn on the spit of my scorn, writhe
     	In my ignorant heat. Here is hate. There is no
     	Learning love. I am a vacuum of reason in my glee.
     	I am the one who burns your righteous book."

     	"You are like the grazed surface of a lake to me,
     	Crazed and buffeted by your senses wind, whipped
     	Into waves of interest and fascination.
     	My mind is once a noose around the noise, a burial stone
     	Whose eyes forever watch the dead,
     	And once the rapids of a song, a blur of foam
     	Whose eyes are wasted on the world. I am a knife
     	Which trims the living skin from dead.
     	I am the all who don't see and overlook."

     	When all animals were deer, all strong drink cider,
     	sky was cloud and blue was yellow,
     	prestige was illusion and buxom obedient,
     	grammar was glamour and it was foolish to be nice.
     	
     	Smiles forced older smirks to specialise,
     	all franchised meaning traced back
     	through flattened vowels and metathesis
     	to an unrecorded Swiss account.
     
     	Old deaths quelled and sweltered away,
     	surviving in heraldry and saws until they're dashed to boot,
     	dead metaphors overtaken by the waiting wolf's teeth
     	which became a rake, a frame for candles then a hearse.
     	
     	Our heyday's lightyears from hay or day,
     	and either's got nothing to do with neither either,
     	and there never was any sorrow in sorry and only listless
     	opposites remind us of how things really were.

     	"Watch your ways...the Devil's afoot today,"

     	before she sought respite in church and ladies,
     	leaving me behind with idle thoughts and empty rooms,

     	the dead slow their breathing, heavy with respect for the old ways.
		
     	Flags, paper ribbons, crinkled bunting;
     	festival trappings flap in the breezes of a late afternoon.
     	Children march to the tune of the Fourth of July.
     	To a father, the bells are quaint, out-of-time.
     	He takes pictures of his little towheaded girl.
     	She marches the grass into the bald ground,
     	slaps a stone marked "Goody, wyfe"
     	with her mini-red white and blue flag.
     	The severe sound frightens the blackbirds,
     	her high voice chanting "The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere"
     	and beating time with her flag on the ridge of the headstone.
		
     	Quiet maple leaves swing low in the humid air.
     	Father steps over the grave marker,
     	standing, as if no one else is there,
     	no one bound in little worn out pieces to the ashy, scrubgrassed earth,
     	takes the flag from his daughter and picks her up lightly
     	like leaves.

     	The blackbirds fly low and drop lightly to the ground,
     	careful of the headstones,
     	pecking for seeds in the yellow grass.

     	yet they are not the same birds

     	the notes must be written in the trees

     	each year leaves paint the trees with the same brilliant colors
     	yet they are not the same leaves

     	since they die, is there nothing to remember?

     	each year my bones wither further
     	they promise to support me only until they find my grave

     	i will sing with the birds in the trees.


     	                II

     	one year the birds returned to sing new songs!
    	look! is there not one unfamiliar feather among them?

     	the notes moor unstaid in the breeze

     	each year leaves canvass the trees with new hues
     	see! how far they can travel before coming to rest!

     	before leaving, they want something to remember

     	each year my heart expands to contain itself
     	a young heart never dies, and i believe this

     	i am singing with the birds in the trees.


     	                III

     	next year the birds should return
     	unless there are no more songs to sing...

     	to sing freely is the bird's only reason for returning

     	next year new leaves will decorate new trees
     	because even the forest cannot last forever

     	old leaves give birth to new trees
     	next year my soul may be a leaf
     	and all of the forests could become my soul

     	i still sing with the birds in the trees.

     	says "better"   the writing
     	on the wall says "nirvana = clit"

     	if i could scrape the bedding
     	from my ear,
     	the flecks of tired from my teeth,
     	i might have strength for dying.
     	but i am older now, harder
     	to combine with sleep.
     	another welding into ice.
     	oh, if i could open up my belly,
     	let the frail out and keep just one
     	illusion around my neck.

          	-------
          	Magpies
          	-------
     
     	From the birch, the crack of magpies
     	heralds the solstice of junkie dusk.
	
     	Each morning the world is more like tar,
     	but your cold, bloody robes thin my eyes.

     	St. Peter, lecherous old angel,
     	waggles his staff at us

     	and I pluck the down from my husband's head
     	as he rocks beneath the roof.

     	If I loved you, your teeth
     	would tumble from your lips--

     	I'd collect each dark root
     	in my grandmother's porcelain cup.

     	If you loved me, licks from the sun
     	would steal your wife, your prior life.

     	I already see the fraying ships
     	stalk near, disappear, reappear

     	and the torches flash
     	from the reef to my bed

     	and the magpies pick the flesh
     	from collarless mongrels.

          	marble love
          	-----------
		
     	i fish a cat's eye
     	out of the leather
     	squeeze warm the glass
     	until stiff finger's jerk open
     	dropping the marble to my toes
     	wriggling between over and between
     	kick a little to calves
     	rolling fast now
     	to knees pinch and catch
     	for just a second
     	before letting go
     	to softer white thighs
     	slowing marble progress
     	lost in curls
     	bumping a drawn in breath
     	pushing hips
     	roll over quivering thick thigh
     	slack rubber band skin
     	rolls pink and silver
     	crepe heavy restless hips
     	catching belly button
     	before climbing ribs
     	rebounding on absorbing motion
    	breast to the other and back
    	following fat edge
     	striking collarbone bounce
     	to neck arching back
     	and a quick climb
     	to chin tongue catching
     	glass taste just in time
     	as the marble teases my lips
     	and the taste of me
     	of me clinking teeth
     	as it slides finally
     	inside warm
     	taste of me

          	--------------
          	No longer then
          	--------------

     	The city is an open grave.
     	All the streets howl with a call for the dead.
     	The bare earth lies like a blank page on which
     	No cross or dot is ever drawn.
     	Never a word, never a vowel will cross its lips
     	And leak into the past.
     	A stagnant pool of progress;
     	Only the sewers run with the words of water pouring.

     	They raised a desert from the destroyed earth.
     	Suffocating in space, out
     	Into the countryside vigilante suburbs sprawl
     	Breathless, spitting at the sky and horizon.

     	Turn any stone and you will find a spider,
     	Squeeze any stone and it will bleed.
     	Torn apart mechanism and
     	Machinery, foreword and the following,
     	Scattered ashes adrift in sand like
     	A song in the radio spectrum
     	Or a pale letter in the proof-reader's task.
     
     	The clouds too thick a filter for the light,
     	Too strong a censor for the sun, lamps ring in your eyes;
     	Telephones with news of the street and a clear message:
     	You are never alone, even in a dark corner
     	Such as yourself.
     	You are always alone, even your thoughts
     	Are a heard heresy.

     	Everyone speaks the language of traffic,
     	Then in two tongues
     	A beggar and a poet whine.
     	Nobody will read. Nobody will notice.
     	In this cemetery
     	The corpses rot before they die.
