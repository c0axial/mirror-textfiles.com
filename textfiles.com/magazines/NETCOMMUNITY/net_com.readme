NETWORKS AND COMMUNITY

Date:      December 5, 1993
Compiler:  Sam Sternberg  samsam@vm1.yorku.ca

This weekly report attempts to follow the changing nature of
community based and oriented activities on the internet.
Readers will get a summary of much of the week's activity on
subjects like Free-Nets and other community nets; access
technology, and legislation effecting public access to
information and network services. Issues like electronic
democracy, censorship and business activity on the net, will be
touched upon when they impact community related issues.

You will also learn about new community nets, and new gophers,
listservs and e-journals which cover this material.

No group and certainly no individual can really monitor even a
fraction of the action on any aspect of the Internet. So your
contributions are welcome.

Please forward announcements to me if "you" are the originating
source.

Please do not forward material from other lists etc. - UNLESS
these sources do not normally focus on issues effecting community
computing and access issues.

To start this news report, I am including a list of major
resources on these topics. This list is not comprehensive. It is
a good guide to historical repositories of information, ongoing
debate and discussion, and useful tools for those attempting to
open or run a community computing facility.

To simplify the job of finding these resources I will point you
to a collection of resources rather than a source whenever that's
possible. I am grateful for the previous work in gathering a
listserv resource list by Art "Rambo" McGee. I have made liberal
use of his list.
