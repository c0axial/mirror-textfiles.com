Global Community
################################################################

        Slowly making headway through the huge pile of handouts
from the "Ties That Bind" Conference in Cupertino!  As I read
through the well presented, thought provoking, informative
brochures, two things are happening to me.  First, I am brought
back to the most energetic gathering of diverse folks that I
personally have attended (sheltered life, huh!) and second, I am
motivated by the energy of the participants (both at the conference
& online) to become more active in what I see as the most
important tool for effecting and affecting community available.

        We are preaching to the already converted here on the net.
We need to bring in the melting pot to these discussions.  Each
question that we ask begets more questions.  We must start to
organize these thoughts and take action.  Only then will we have an
effective tool to use to change the world.  If you think about it,
we have at our potential disposal, in our homes and businesses, the
text capabilities to reach as many folks as CNN does with
television. One that, if used properly and distributed widely,
truly globalize our local communities.

        *WE* must take the initiative to link our diverse systems
together, and righteously fight any loss of bandwidth taken from
us by commercial providers, the government and others that would
choke off this resource before it reaches its potential.  We must
make access to the Internet by all a priority, equal in importance
to free speech!  If we cede the ownership of the Internet to
private enterprise, they will control it, just as was done with
that OTHER medium, television.  We let others dictate content that
appeals to the lowest common denominator.

        We must bring our communities online, all of them.  We must
form state and national organizations to assist in funding and
information gathering.  If we fight to maintain ownership of this
medium, we will finally have the power to *REALLY* effect change.

        To accomplish this, we must share our knowledge of and
excitement with the rest of our communities.  Offer to teach a
class at your house or community center on how to use this tool.
Preach the gospel, follow it up with your actions, and show others
that the "INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY" can be just as simple to use as
the "INTERSTATE HIGHWAY".

SAN DIEGO TAKES THE INITIATIVE IN TELECOM
        San Diego wants a broadband fiber network and it isn't waiting for
state and federal governments or "convergence" to make it happen. The city
is soliciting bids from telephone and cable companies, the local electrical
utility, universities and even the U.S. Navy. "We want to conjure up ways
in which we can use this technology in a way that makes sense in a business
context," says a city management assistant. (Multichannel News 5/9/94)

LAWYERS CAPITALIZE ON INTERNET FLAMING
        Canter & Siegel, a husband-and-wife law firm that found itself
scorched by flame mail last month for advertising on the Internet, has
decided to launch a new service, Cybersell, to help other businesses do the
same thing. Cybersell will charge $500 for access to 6,000 news groups.
"People like Canter & Siegel are taking grotesque advantage of liberating
technology that supports the free and open exchange of ideas," says the
president of the Internet Company.  Retorts Siegel, "Our fate has been that
we're making a lot of money. If a bunch of hysterics want to scream and
yell and make fools of themselves, then I don't feel they warrant respect."

THE SENSE OF A WOMAN
        Women love the geometric video game Tetris, and game-makers are
dying to find out why. While 99% of the buyers for most other games are
male, 40% of Tetris buyers are female. One theory is the appeal of the
game's goal, which is to bring order to chaos, resulting in neat little
rows of geometric shapes. Women crave order, hypothesizes a sociologist
hired by Nintendo to unravel the riddle, and by beating the clock on the
game, a woman experiences a rush of endorphins -- "feel good" chemicals
produced by the body under stress. (Wall Street Journal 5/10/94 B1)

COMPUTER TV SHOWS
        Ziff-Davis Publishing plans a series of four 30-minute television
programs about computers, to be aired in conjunction with 30-minute
high-tech shopping shows. The Personal Computing Show and Tech TV's
Computer Outlet will be produced by the Technology Information Network, a
joint venture of Ziff-Davis and Missing Link Communications. (Wall Street
Journal 5/10/94 B9)


WOMEN FAVOR E-MAIL OVER E-MALL
        A survey conducted by an online publication reveals that more than
66% of the women surveyed log on to an electronic service at least once a
day and the same number spends at least $20 a month on online fees. Top on
their list is interacting with editors, writers and other readers, with
Internet access ranking second. Only 6% considered shopping, banking or
travel services a priority. (Tampa Tribune 5/9/94 B&F3)

INFO HIGHWAYS FOR THE FUTURE, POLICY FOR NOW
        "Ten years from now you're still going to be looking at Dan Rather
and his successors," predicts Andrew Schwartzman of the Media Access
Project, who insists that policy makers should concentrate on traditional
reforms (e.g., the Fairness Doctrine and rules barring phone companies from
controlling information content on its wires), rather than be distracted by
future hype that will allow the information highway to be controlled by
three or four companies. (Common Cause Magazine Spring 94 p.17)

BATTLE WAGED OVER NSFNET CONTRACT
        The National Science Foundation will spend $50 million on an
upgraded NSFNet backbone, and has selected MCI for the vBNS (very
high-speed backbone network services) portion of the project. Sprint is
raising objections, and the lawyers are preparing to do battle. Sprint
claims that NSFNet management had a too-cozy relationship with MCI during
the evaluation process, and that a National Science Board member also has a
possible conflict of interest with MCI. (Telecommunications 5/94 p.15)

POSSIBLE SHARED JURISDICTION OVER TELECOMMUNICATION
        The Canadian federal government may delegate some of its power over
communications to the provinces following protests by Quebec over a recent
Supreme Court ruling that confirmed exclusive federal jurisdiction in this
area. (Toronto Star 5/12/94 A15)

 ISDN COMING INTO ITS OWN
        After many years of false starts, Integrated Services Digital
Network is developing into a viable choice for communications users.  There
were more than 125,000 ISDN lines in service at the end of 1993, and the
number's expected to grow to 1 million by the end of 1997. "Pricing is
breeding ISDN," says the president of a telecommunications firm.
(Telecommunications 5/94 p.18)

 FULL-MOTION VIDEO CHIPS
        Texas-based Linden Technology has a new take on running full-motion
video over your PC. It's combined the memory and logic circuits on one
chip, enabling PCs to be built with the graphics capability of a fancy
workstation at one-third the cost, according to the company's president.
"The big chipmakers think we're crazy, but we see a $30 chip that can push
1,000 MIPS (millions of instructions per second)." (Business Week 5/16/94
p.91)

 MASCULINE/FEMININE
        Men typically imagine computer devices that can help them "conquer
the universe," says Jan Hawkins, director of the Center for Children &
Technology, whereas women want machines that meet people's needs, "the
perfect mother." The center's associate director, Cornelia Bruner, says if
everyone approached technology the way women do, "we wouldn't be pushing
envelopes... Most women, even those who are technologically sophisticated,
think of machines as a means to an end." (Newsweek 5/16/94 p.48)

BELL ATLANTIC TELLS CONGRESS:  IGNORE THE LONG DISTANCE MYTHS, LET ALL
TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS COMPETE

Washington, D.C. , May, 12 -- Bell Atlantic President James G. Cullen
today called on the United States Senate to look beyond the myths
perpetuated by the long distance telephone industry and craft
telecommunications reform legislation that "allows consumers to reap the
full benefits of competition."

Cullen, testifying on behalf of the seven Regional Bell Operating
Companies, pledged to the Senate Commerce Committee his willingness to
work out a compromise on S. 1822, The Communications Act of 1994.  Cullen
asserted that simultaneously opening long distance markets as local
markets are opened to additional competition will lower telephone rates
and could create as many as 3.6 million new jobs over the next 10 years.

"To do anything less than opening both markets at the same time will
virtually preordain the winners and losers in this competitive
industry," Cullen said.  "To do anything less will limit choices for
consumers."

Cullen added that if the local telephone companies like Bell Atlantic were
able to provide long distance service, consumers would have as many as
seven new choices for these long distance services.  "The long distance
cartel remains closed," he said, "closed as the companies spread myths and
misinformation to keep competitors out of their markets."

Cullen suggested that telecommunications providers begin to talk seriously
about how they can work together in the best interest of the consumer.  He
urged policy makers to focus on the realities of the marketplace and
create a compromise which opens all markets to competition.

           An electronic mail address list
              for people who experience
       moods swings, fright, voices, and visions

                     sylviac@netcom.com

I have created an Internet electronic mail address list for
people who experience moods swings, fright, voices, and
visions ("people who").  The list is used to further low
cost exchange of information to serve cohesion and
mutuality, and support increased power for "people who."

Almost all current activity and advocacy of "people who" is
supported by local and national mental health systems and
associations, and by grants. Some "people who" believe that
this kind of funding dulls the philosophic edge of the grass
roots user movement and uses up too much administrative
energy.  Current newsletters and mailings are distributed
by post and the copying, collating, and mail costs have
become prohibitive.  This leads to restricted information
distribution just when the global trends are for wider
information exchange, even information overload.  Electronic
mail (e-mail) is created once and sent to one or many with a
few computer commands.  There is no postage, no envelopes,
no address labels, no folding.  The receiver can read the
mail on the computer screen or print out a paper version.
E-mail saves money, saves time, and gets distributed faster.

A low (or no) cost Internet system will enable any user who
can access a computer network system for a few minutes to be
informed and to contribute.  Dial-up Internet access is
readily available with a free local telephone call.
Internet can connect different brands of hardware and
different operating systems, and can interconnect with
Compuserve, America On Line, and other commercial systems.

There is an intention to involve users of mental health
services in their services and to have users directing their
own care.  Access to the computer tools of mental health
systems is part of this involvement.  Almost all local
mental health systems and mental health associations
now have computers.  Connecting to the Internet and sharing
equipment usage for the few minutes that e-mail requires is
a way for local services to act on the theme of inclusion.
Internet would cost nothing beyond the already existing
fixed costs.  A service of local mental health centers is
electronic access to information and to each other.  If this
low level of cooperation is not achievable, other sources of
Internet access might be local junior colleges,
universities, libraries (via Freenet), independent living
centers and disability rights groups, human service
organizations, computer clubs, technology manufacturers,
local businesses, friends, neighbors.  Internet access is
easily achievable.  Even unsophisticated, low end,
grandfather generation technology will work - a modem, some
memory, and maybe a printer are all that are needed.

For those who would like to learn to use computers, e-mail
is a good entry level project.  There is a difference
between using electronic mail and using computer bulletin
boards.  E-mail requires less knowledge of computer
workings and less computer time.  Specific training could be
available from local rehabilitation services, mental health
departments, schools, computer clubs.

For those who do not use radio and television because the
technology is invasive, because it sends targeted messages,
because it speaks directly to them, computers are
interactive and once learned, at the control of the
operator.  This medium may be acceptable.

The e-mail address list gathered will be kept private for
use by other "people who" but is not confidential.

To subscribe, send an email message to majordomo@netcom.com

                          A CALL TO COMMUNITY

          A Paper presented at the "Ties That Bind" Conference

                       by Kevin Thomas Sullivan


        Are community networks going to become the "information
utilities" of our age?  Maybe, though they will have to overcome
great hurdles to achieve that status.  I see community networkers
not as aspiring utility operators, but as visionaries who can
provide leadership in helping us to rediscover intimate community,
which I believe to be a healthy condition.  I see then, community
networks transending the utility paradigm, leaving it to other
organizations to provide "utility level" service to the community.

        What is intimate community and why is it important?
Intimate community is about the process of building close, deep
and lasting relationships with other men and women.  This is
something that we don't do very well in our fast paced, high
achieving culture.  In fact, the way we use things like computers,
televisions, cars, even phones, isolates us from one another.
Should we just chuck technology and go back to an old nostalgic
way of being?  I believe not.  Forces often act in two balancing
directions even though we can see only one side at any given
time.  Technology is certainly a power and we certainly have seen
one of its sides in a big way.  Perhaps technology can be used to
help facilitate the building of intimate community.

        How can community networks help in this process?  I believe
that intimate community is best facilitated through personal
contact with other individuals who have a shared passion for
something, be it baseball, stamp collecting or even community
building.  I want to see how community networks can be used to
help facilitate the process of bringing people together in ways
that enrich our relationships.

        This way of thinking results in a subtle shift in point-of
-view.  Community networks become community communications tools
instead of information providers.

          Access to personal information becomes more important than
          access to impersonal information.

          Access to personal information of those within our
          geographic community becomes more important than access to
          personal information of those outside our geographic
          community.

          The concept of Personal Information Empowerment (PIE)
          becomes important.  That you control what, when, where
          and with whom you share your personal information.

          Providing simple, low cost access to local, personal
          information becomes more important than providing complex
          and expensive access to global impersonal information.
          (This will be the job of the commercial information
          providers.)

          Finding ways to maximize access to local personal
          information while minimizing the amount of time and
          effort that people spend on the system, becomes important.

        How do we put these ideas into practice?  We have already
begun.  We need to continue to accept the premise that we do not
have the answers, that we are unlikely to think of the answers in
the abstract, that the answers will come only through thought
combined with simple trial and error. We need to stay open and
flexible, encouraging multiple approaches, and avoiding approaches
that will require us think and act alike.  We need to make our
platforms less stable, more flexible and smaller, so that many
different people in different communities can begin to experiment
with their own models.  Taking more risks, but each risk smaller
and more manageable, and above all, listening to the results of our
experiments, honestly evaluating them and making changes.

        As the community networking movement shifts to this
ground, we will find that many of our current obstacles will begin
to disappear.  We will begin to appear less threatening to the
commercial information providers because we will be taking a
different, though hopefully complimentary, path.  The vital energy
that we spend on our current technical and political struggles
will become less, because the scale of our projects, and their
information requirements, will remain small.  We will be able to
focus our energies on the creative part of this process, generating
a series of experiments that begin to enrich our everyday life.

        This is not an easy road.  We will need support.  We need
to continue making the community building community stronger, so
that these experiments can be shared and supported in gentle and
accepting ways.  We must pay attention to the community that we
are creating today, and nourish its growth to sustain us in our
efforts.

        I am convinced that out of these experiments will come a
powerful community building force that will have the potential to
transform community in our age.

 Dear Net Citizen:

 How do you put a price on free and open dialogue on the Net?

 How much are you willing to spend to preserve the concept of roboust
 and open debate that have become a part of the Internet's culture?
 $100? $50?  $20?

 What if the cost of helping to preserve an open and robust Net was
 no more than $1.29?  That's right, less than the cost of a fast
 food hamburger.  Freedom on the Internet for only $1.29... cheap
 at twice the price.

 A joke?  Hardly.  The free and open speech, indeed the First Amendment
 rights of the Internet -- rights we've all enjoyed for decades -- are now
 being challenged in court.

 CyberWire Dispatch, the well-respected online newswire written and
 developed for the Internet community by journalist Brock Meeks, is
 the subject of a libel suit.  CyberWire Dispatch has been at the
 forefront of bringing the Net community timely and insightful
 articles.

 This suit was highlighted in a _Wall St. Journal_ article (April
 22, page B1).  The subject of a Dispatch investigation is suing
 Meeks for simply doing what journalists in the traditional print
 medium have done since the founding of newspapers:  Print the
 facts and let the public decide the outcome.

 Brock and the Cyperwire Dispatch are examples of the "bottom up"
 journalism that charachterizes the Net, where anyone with a modem can
 compete with the traditional press.  Of course, most of us don't come
 to the Net with a lawyer in tow, or the resources to defend a legal
 action taken against us in courts located hundreds of miles from our
 homes.

 This libel action is one of the earliest cases of libel involving
 alleged defamatory statements published over a computer network.
 It raises the extremely important legal and policy issues.  It's impact
 may well determine how and to what extent anyone feels free to express
 strong opinions on the Net, wihtout being put at risk of legal action.


 It is crucial that Brock have a strong defense and that the principles
 that  come out of this case provide the maximum protection to the
 exercise of free and open speech as possible.

 CyberWire Dispatch is unique because it's distributed solely in
 electronic form.  A service for the Net community at large.  And
 all CyberWire Dispatch articles are free.  Meeks neither charges
 anyone for receiving them;  he gets paid nothing to write them.

 For all these efforts, he's being sued.  And being sued by a
 company with a large financial backing.  Meeks, on the other hand,
 has no such resources.  His attorney, Bruce Sanford of Baker &
 Hostetler is arguably the finest First Amendment lawyer in the
 U.S.

 And although he has agreed to represent Meeks at a reduced rate,
 the cost of defending against this unmerited suit will not be
 cheap.

 We have formed this committee to lend our support in helping him
 raise money for his legal defense.  And all we're asking you to
 send is $1.29.  That's it.  Why that price?  The math is easy: $1
 in an envelope with a 29 cent stamp applied.

 Who can't afford $1.29 to help save the great freedoms we all
 enjoy here today?

 Can you send more?  Of course.  Any contributions will be
 welcomed and accepted.  Tax deductible donations also are
 possible by following the instructions below.

 All money sent for Meeks' legal defense fund will be go to that
 purpose.  All the administrative services for administering the
 fund are being donated;  100% of your money goes to defer the
 legal costs of this case.

 You are encouraged to repost this message.  But please, we urge
 you to keep proper Net protocol in mind when reposting or cross
 posting this message.

 Thanks for your time.  On behalf of Brock and for future
 generations of electronic journalists, we appreciate your
 contributions and support.
