INTERNET POLITICS
-----------------

The Clinton administration is proposing a new section for the
TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT:
"VII. Regulation of Two-Way, Broadband Transmission Services
(Title VII)

The Administration proposes adding a new Title VII to
the Communications Act to apply, on an elective basis, to
providers of two-way, broadband, digital transmission
services, offered on a switched basis to end users.  The
Administration would emphasize these services because, well
into the 21st century, they will connect and empower the
American public by providing them with a variety of voice,
data, video services, and other information that will enhance
our nation's economic competitiveness and the quality of life
of our citizens.

A new Title VII would provide a unified, symmetric
treatment of providers of two-way broadband services, in
contrast to the present disparate treatment of common
carriers and cable operators under Titles II and VI of the
Act.  It also would provide important incentives to promote
private sector development of this part of the NII and spur
availability of advanced services on a widespread basis.  The
Administration recognizes that communications services are
developing in a rapidly changing technical and marketplace
environment.  A new Title VII would create a regulatory
regime that should stand the test of time by providing the
FCC with the flexibility to adapt its regulatory approach in
light of changes in market and technological conditions."

The new section would streamline regulations for companies
that chose to be regulated under it. At the same time it
would reguire them to meet specific guarantees for public access,
open system features, privacy, and even the provision of public
"data" phone booths.

Chris Casey <chris_casey@kennedy.senate.gov> of the office of Sen. Edward
Kennedy says "Some progress is being made here on the Hill. The Senate now
has an anonymous ftp server running.  It's sparsly populated, only Kennedy
and Stevens have posted anything so far, but I imagine the rest will
find their way shortly. At least it's a start. The fact that the Senate
has an anonymous ftp server is not a secret, but I don't think it's widely
known either."
You can access the server by FTPing to ftp.senate.gov, logging in as
"anonymous" (without the quotes) and giving your email address as password.

This service is provided by the Office of the U.S. Senate Sergeant at Arms
and the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration.
It contains general information files about the United States
Senate in the directory "general".  Directories are also provided for
specific Senators' offices, in alphabetical order by two-letter state
abbreviations, and for Senate committees and other Senate offices.

The "releases" subdirectories contain press releases and related materials,
and "general" subdirectories contain information of long-term interest such
as office contacts.

The current issue of Alawon - the library oriented congressional watch
newsletter points out that illegal regulations have been promulgated in what
are essentially power struggles over potential control of government
information. REVENUE GENERATION is at the heart of this perversion of U.S.
law.

" NTIS REGULATIONS PLACE RESTRICTIONS ON GOVERNMENT INFORMATION

The National Technical Information Service published final regulations in
the January 3 _Federal Register_, pp. 6-12, that place restrictions on the
use of NTIS databases in depository libraries.  The final rule on the
transfer of scientific, technical and engineering information to NTIS
contains a new set of provisions under which NTIS promises to distribute
two NTIS databases to depository libraries "on the condition that they
agree to ensure that online access to the NTIS listing...is restricted to
the Library and its staff and that the full text provided online...are
available only to the community served by that Library."  These provisions,
for which no opportunity for public comment was provided, appear to
contradict the law governing the Depository Library Program and the Office
of Management and Budget's Circular A-130 by restricting the use and reu
of government information.

While NTIS may improve public access to some scientific and technical
information, by law agencies are required to make virtually every kind of
published government information available to GPO's Depository Library
Program (44 U.S.C. 1902 and 1903).  Publications are to be made available
by depositories "for the free use of the general public" (44 U.S.C. 1911).
There is no provision in the American Technology Preeminence Act (which
NTIS cites as the statutory authority for their regulations) which
establishes a depository distribution requirement for NTIS, permits NTIS to
assume depository distribution responsibilities assigned to GPO and federal
agencies, or exempts agencies from compliance with the requirements of
chapter 19 of Title 44 with respect to scientific, technical and
engineering information.

In the comments section preceding the final rule (p. 9), NTIS was frank
about the reason for the restrictions it imposed on depository use of its
databases:  "The new regulations will also obligate DL's to protect the
information provided to them (Section 1180.11(d)(6)).  This is important
because the improper disclosure of this valuable information could
seriously erode NTIS's ability to operate on a self-sustaining basis.  For
example, improper dissemination of the list of products could significantly
reduce the rental value of NTIS's bibliographic database as an income-
producing asset."  No such restrictions on government information are
permitted in the law governing depository libraries.  Additionally, OMB
Circular A-130 directs agencies to "avoid establishing restrictions or
regulations, including the charging of fees or royalties, on the reuse,
resale, or redissemination of Federal information dissemination products by
the public" (58FR36072).

When ALA past president Marilyn Miller commented on NTIS' proposed
regulations announced in the May 11, 1993 _Federal Register_, pp. 27681-4,
she made several comments on the proposed rules.  Although ALA supported
NTIS in its efforts to provide government information to libraries and the
general public, Miller expressed concern about agency noncompliance with
the GPO depository requirements.  She was also concerned about the
exceedingly broad definition of "scientific, technical and engineering
."  The definition in the final regulations remains extremely
road and includes:  "Information that bears on business and industry
generally, such as economic information, market information and related
information, if the agency determines such information would be of value to
consumers of the information" described in another paragraph as "basic and
applied research that results from the efforts of scientists and engineers
in any medium...."

Several comments expressed by Miller and other library associations were
acted on and included in the January 3 final rule.  The regulations state
regulations do not exempt an agency from following compliance
requirements to distribute publications through the Depository Library
Program.  Miller also called for "co-operation not competition," procedures
for facilitating cooperation between NTIS, federal agencies, and
depositories.

The regulations are effective February 1.  For further information,

DISCUSSION
----------

In general the amount of discussion on all internet listservs covering
community networks was low. A major flame war broke out over a
proposal to use 1 billion dollars in pentagon funds to create an institute
to beef up the content of the Internet in areas of interest to the U.S.
Intelligence community. The proposed "foundation"; would act as a front
"cutout" for the "community". Funding resource development without revealing
which elements of the intelligence community were interested.

Freenet-admin listserv:

An alternative view on the structure of Civic nets was posted.

" One of the things that will make Free-Nets more economical to run and
maintain is when we can turn off our last dial-up telephone/modem line
and have a single network connection
without cutting any of our patrons off from our service.  It won't happen
tomorrow, but it will happen.  That will relieve us of this function and
allow us to devote full time to the purpose of the Free-Net."
Andrew L. Hollander, <Andrew.L.Hollander.1@nd.edu> continues;
" my view is that Free-Nets are information service providers to
the local and networked community.  Their niche is to provide,
electronically, that information that is unique to the locallity that the
Free-Net covers.  That has been, and will always be, first and foremost,
the reason for being.  In effect, we will be one shelf of books in the
Internet library.  Internet access, e-mail, and network news are extremely
nice features of Free-Nets, for the moment.  However, with increased local
access directly to these other services, they will become redundant, out
moded and not cost effective for a Free-Net to provide.

I see this as a natural evolution of Free-Nets, and something to look
forward to while we struggle with how to provide the ancillary functions
that we should and/or need to carry until other easier entry points to the
Information Superhighway are available to individuals in our communities.
It may take 5, 10, or 15 years, but we should have our eyes open to the
future of our service."

Also discussed on the admin list was a call for a document archive to be
created which would hold developmental information for those wanting to
create new civic nets.

Freenet-tech listserv:

Discussion of the use of WEB and hypertext continued and was extended into
the area of using offline mail readers. Also discussed were techniques for
handling multiple languages.

Communet listserv:

Most of the posting had a random character. Of some general interest were
further information on the CoNet movement in Minnesota. This is an attempt
to base civic nets on the use of "parti" conferencing software. They also
seek close relationships with public broadcasters.

There were several posts with heartfelt calls for a defence against the
administration's decision to embrace the commercial world as the developer
of NII. Unfortunately, they did not include any suggestions for concrete
actions that could be undertaken.

Two recent newspaper articles opposing the administration's goal of Universal
Access were summerized and list readers were asked to write and give the
views this community to the papers.  The opposition was based on the desire
not to see another "mandated" service come into existance.

The most enjoyable communet post was the following example of how net
access can benefit non profit groups.
"San Diego Local nonprofit agencies have a unique way of communicating with
themselves, they send E-Mail.  An Electronic Bulletin Board System
located at Catholic Charities provides electronic mail capabilities
for local agencies to send electronic mail.  The 386 system uses
SCO Xenix Operating System and has numerous phone numbers for access
from differing areas.  Nonprofit agencies in the central and north
counties have benefited from its use over the years but the system
had not generated as much attention or popularity until June of
1993 when the Internet Mail (UUCP) connection was established.
Connection of Electronic Mail from this computer system to other
networks, such as Prodigy, CompuServe, HandsNet, Connect, Universities
and numerous other computer networks has spurred increasing system
use.  So much so that an additional 425MB hard drive had to be added
to meet increased use."
The system includes:
        Meeting Schedules, Agendas, and Events
        Bed Availability, Homeless & At Risk Directory
        Service Provider's ( Discontinued / New / Changed / Temporary )
        Funding, Grants, Endowments, Resources, Donation (Need/Avail.)
        Job Availability Information
        Volunteer Needs and Ideas
        Computer & EBB System Related Information
        Individual User Directories
        Health Care, Prenatal Care, & Medical Related
        Seniors, Children, and Disabled
        Food/Hunger & Poverty Issues
        F.E.M.A.
        S.D. Community Back To Work Transportation Fund

Also included are services such as bed availability information,
inter-agency electronic mail, client referral coordination and
file transfer capabilities. The main menu allows the users to send
electronic mail or post information in topic sections related to
their organizations.

The funding arrangements are straight forward. Agencies have supported
the Electronic Bulletin Board by way of subscription fees for several
years now but the project was initially started with donations and grants.
The system does offer incredible capabilities for its users and it is a very
valuable step to the Information Superhighway.  David Almada
of Catholic Charities Says "I am very surprised by the
response.  I have been receiving E-Mail from nonprofits in Moscow
and Argentina asking for information about our system.  I had no
idea the computers connected that far!   It is relatively simple
to connect users to the system, all they need is a modem,
Catholic Charities provides communications software.

NEW SERVICES
------------

HYPERTEXT NETWORK MENU STRUCTURES:
Peter Scott - the developer of the wonderful HYTELNET SERVICES wrote that
"I have been thinking about creating a hypertext utility for listing main
menu structures, based upon my HYTELNET utility, which which you may be
familiar. It would be useful for handing out to interested people,
particularly those without any access to the network. It could also be
easily customized for particular groups who might be willing to assist in
funding i.e. index sub-menus for specific topics like business or
education resources. Also, useful documents could be linked i.e. business
plans, FREE-NET dial-in numbers.

If you want to see an example of how this may work telnet to
access.usask.ca login with: hytelnet and go to the FREE-NET menu under
SITES2.

IMPROVED SYSTEM FOR LOCATING A SPECIFIC GOPHER:
"We are among the few gophers that allow searches for gophers by partial Title
or partial Internet address.  For instance, if you want to search for all
gophers with Pennsylvania in their titles you can enter a search parameter
of "Pennsylvania".  If, however, you wanted to find all gophers provided by
the University of Pennsylvania and you knew their Internet domain contained
"upenn" you could enter "upenn" as the search paramter.  You can even use
both techniques, using one type of search to refine the second search.

We have found that using search to access gophers is much faster than a
sequential search thru the full country/state list of gophers.  And you
can quickly find if a particular site provides any other gopher servers."

THE OSTRY REPORT ON GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IN NETWORK DEVELOPMENT
This report - originally commissioned by the Mulroney regime, was being
ignored by the Liberal government till Mr. Ostry leaked it to the press.
The resulting publicity lead to its "adoption". Just how much of it gets
adopted will be seen this tuesday as the first format liberal statement of
its policies regard the NII will be laid out at the ITAC convention in
Toronto. The importance of this issue to the Prime Minister can be seen in
the fact that tonight [monday] he delivered a speech in Toronto to a
business group about his jobs program. Tomorrow a third ranking civil
servant will be in Toronto to deliver his position to to the assembled
audience at ITAC. [ and these folks have paid up to $1,ooo.oo each to attend]

The report itself is intelligent, quirky, and slanted to towards educational
needs. Which is to expected given its authors profound involvement in the
development of educational T.V.

Press accounts have missed the thrust of the report and failed to comment on
its most appealing but quirky elements.

According to Ostry, all previous government efforts at developing a national
net policy have been "mired... in indecision". He goes on to say that in his
numerous contacts with federal officials he found " a deep-seated suspicion
or fear that powerful hostile constituencies outside of OTTAWA .......[
everyone else in canda with any political clout is then listed] .... "stand
ready to obstruct or embarrass a federal initiative" ....

[ I can't resist commenting that during the Mulroney years I saw the same
behaviour. It lead to manipulative policy efforts and extreme secrecy; but
I assumed it came from a distain for the public and a desire to
hide a massive amount of financial corruption. ed ]

On the other hand in visiting these other players he found they all wanted
federal leadership.

Ostry believes that a real effort has to be made to use the nets to defend
Canadian culture. That the Canarie project is not sufficient and that
Cabinet level leadership is needed. "Today may be our last chance" he quotes
for a prior report. The key issue for him is clearly the need for supporting
"serious Canadian programming in a system dominated by the U.S...."
