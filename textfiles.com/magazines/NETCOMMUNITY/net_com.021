Don't Forget Your Taxes!!!

FROM THE TOP!!!

        Well, after many, many hours of editing, reading hundreds of
bulletins, posts, mailing lists, etc., I have finally put this
newsletter to bed!  I can see how Sam Sternberg would need to take
a break!

        As you can see, the format of the article is different
than in the past.  I spend five plus hours an evening reading posts
and chasing the gopher around the Internet searching for new
nuggets to fill up my hard disk so that I can pass them on to you!
It's fun trying to find something that Gleason Sackman's
"Net-Happenings" postings haven't mentioned!

        I am completely open to your criticism as to the contents,
format and direction of this newsletter.  Feel free to e-mail all
flames, (I'm a retired firefighter!) flowers or whatever.  We will
all grow this thing together.

        I hope and plan to continue the Newsletter as a weekly
feature every Friday.  Again, I would request that individuals and
groups that operate Community networks e-mail me at
cvington@netcom.com with information about your systems.  I hope
to profile a system every issue.  Your system need not be connected
to the Internet to have it profiled.  Please include a statement of
purpose, operator's name, how you started, your goals and other
pertinent information.

        See you next Friday!

NEWS of the WIRED & WEIRD **** Received from various sources
################################################################


From:     Steve Cisler <sac@APPLE.COM> Subject:  Shaping the info
highway (S.J. Mercury article)

The April 4 San Jose Mercury News has an article called "Shaping the
info highway" by David Bank. It discusses the administrations  efforts
to open up access to the networks through schools, libraries, hospitals,
and the provision of community information and services by convincing
industry to take part.

Bank quotes Gore staffer, Greg Simon,
"There are public interests that the marketplace will never take into
account, but it helps private companies for people to become computer
literate, for people to have access to community servicess. It helps
hospitals' productivity, but it also helps make health care less
expensive."

There is a mention of the problems of companies focusing on wealthy
urban markets and ignoring the rural ones. Then he mentions the NTIA
(Dept. of Commerce) grants for $26 million. The author incorrectly
says they have received more than 3,500 applications, whereas they
have received that many iquiries about the grants, not actual
applications. (Though there is an office pool on how many they will
get by the May deadline.)

Richard Civille is quoted saying the local community efforts will have
more influence shaping future policy than inner beltway activities.

Mitch Kapor talks about Cyberspace...

There is some criticism of the plan for a pool of funds to pay for
universal service, and there is obviously no definition of what the
new digital univsersal service will be. Simon says two-way video and
a high speed modem connection to the Net are "too much".

<I think a high speed modem connection, 28.8 kpbs with SLIP/PPP
should be the minimum short term goal of any site--Steve Cisler>

David Teece of U. of California Berkeley School of Business says that
government pushing univ. service too early will cut out revenues needed
to build the infrastructure.

An investment report from Deloitte and Touche warn than 'network owners'
counting on advertising and transcaction revenues could resist efforts to
provide public and government information instead of using the bandwidth
for commerce.

It ends with Simon saying, "...we want to make sure that people can
enjoythe national information infrastructure who don't have a lot of money...
It's not just for people who want to make money, but for people who want
to learn things or express themselves."

The San Jose Mercury's email address is sjmercury@aol.com. Perhaps your
replies will reach Mr. Bank. You already have Gore's address.

TEACH YOUR DAUGHTERS WELL
    The second annual Take Our Daughters to Work Day will have a high-tech
spin this year as companies provide opportunities for girls to experience
weightlessness and try out robotics at the Johnson Space Center,
participate in "hands-on scientific experiments" at Ortho-McNeil
Pharmaceutical, and solve brainteasers via a computer bulletin board
linking 100 Coopers & Lybrand offices across the U.S. (Wall Street Journal
4/8/94 B1)

NETWORK FREE FOR ALL
    The Clinton Administration has assured representatives of non-profit
groups, policy makers, and academics that the national data highway would
be more like the Internet than like the infotainment model suggested by
some of the proposed cable-television alliances. (Chronicle of Higher
Education 4/6/94 A28)

TCI UNVEILS DIGITAL TV CENTER
    Tele-Communications Inc. opened a new facility aimed toward expanding
the channel capacity of TCI and other cable vendors. The $100 million
National Digital Television Center will offer digitized programming to
cable systems, particularly targeting small operators in rural areas, but
won't have any customers until 1995, when a new generation of digital
set-top boxes becomes available from manufacturers. Digital technology will
enable TCI to transmit as many as 10 compressed channels on the space of
one analog channel. (Wall Street Journal 4/8/94 B6)

SOFTWARE PATENT CONTROVERSY
    A California software company has won a patent which it claims covers
any software which integrates an ad (such as the Energizer Bunny) into that
software; their contention is that they invented the idea of placing
advertising symbols in software. The patent could affect such familiar
software as the flying windows screen savers built into Microsoft Windows.
(New York Times 4/8/94 C4)

SECURITY ALERT
        The Computer Emergency Response Team Command Center is alerting
anyone who's obtained a copy of software called file-transfer protocol
daemon from Washington University's software archive to check the number of
the version. Any number lower than version 2.3 contains a "Trojan horse"
virus that could allow a cracker to gain control over the system on which
it is running. CERT notes that version 2.3 is available at ftp.uu.net in
the directory described as /networking/ftp/wuarchive-ftpd, and recommends
that any lower-numbered versions be replaced or disabled immediately.
(Chronicle of Higher Education 4/13/94 A19)

SOFTWARE PATENT REFORMS PROMISED
        The commissioner of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has
pledged to make "the software patent system workable -- so that it takes
you to the bank and not the courthouse." Reforms include publicizing patent
applications, hiring seven software specialists as examiners (there
currently are no examiners who are software specialists), revamping the
examiner bonus program so that it does not encourage superficial review,
and acquiring more data on each patent application before a decision is
made. (Wall Street Journal 4/11/94 B6)

MOSAIC EQUIPMENT UNDER STRAIN
        Managers at Mosaic's home site report that the equipment supporting
the program is under tremendous strain due to a feature that automatically
opens up a "home page" when the software is started. In recent months,
users have pulled up that home page more than 1.3 million times a week. If
users reconfigured their software to start in a different place, the
problem would be alleviated. (Chronicle of Higher Education 4/13/94 A19)

TECHNOLOGY POLICIES CLASH AT FEDERAL LEVEL
        The Clinton Administration seems to be favoring commercial
technology companies over traditional national security interests, while at
the same time rebuffing commercial interests when consumer interests are at
stake.  VP Al Gore expects industry to ensure universal access to new
technology, while at the same time supporting the FCC's decision to cut
cable TV rates by an average of 17% -- a move that some analysts claim will
impede the convergence of cable and phone and slow construction of the
National Information Infrastructure. (New York Times 4/11/94 C1)

HOW DO YOU FEEL?
        A new patent for "intelligent surface technology" would embed
sensors, microchips and air pillows to improve the fit and shock absorption
of shoes, chairs, and beds, and use information gleaned about your body to
adjust the product to the most comfortable position. (New York Times

City Connection:
Past, Present and Future

3/11/94

THE PAST

Ever since I purchased a modem for my Macintosh SE, I was modeming all
around the valley for shareware files.  One of the regular stopping points
was a system in Cupertino called "MacDaze," operated by Bob Murrow (now
living in Santa Barbara, CA.)  MacDaze was a Second Sight BBS (bulletin
board system) that operates on a Macintosh and has a text-based interface
(a very common or universal interface).

In the summer of 1991, MacDaze switched bbs packages and started operating
on FirstClass, a graphical user interface (GUI) e-mail and conferencing
system by SoftArc, Inc.  That was probably the very first FirstClass
system in the San Francisco Bay Area.  It was closely followed by another
FirstClass system in Los Altos and soon a few more sprouted up in the Santa
Clara Valley.

Aside from the GUI, FirstClass was capable of supporting multiple phone
lines which allowed concurrent on-line sessions.  That also meant live
chatting between callers.  It was a hot piece of software.

But for those other Macintosh-based BBS systems still running on text-
based systems, their user activity dropped almost out of sight.  Most of the
Macintosh callers experiencing the GUI BBS evolution would not go back
to calling the older style bbses.  But, DOS-based computer users didn't
see what the fuss was about until 1993, at which time, SoftArc developed a
Windows-client.

During one of the numerous chat sessions on MacDaze, Bob Murrow asked me
if he could get the television schedule from my department (I worked in
the City of Cupertino's Muncipal Channel which televises council and
planning meetings along with PBS progamming and internally produced shows.)
That started the idea process for gathering information from local city
halls and providing them on-line for everyone to access.

While working for the city, I noticed that citizens had to travel to city
hall to get information, information that was originally created on a
computer.  But what really told me that this could work, was a comment from
a resident watching one of the live, televised meetings.  She came to
the meeting to speak on an issue that she was watching on television in her
home.  Basically, the point of televising the meetings is to get the
information out to the public so that they become aware of what is
happening in their community.

I spoke to several department staffmembers and their response to the idea
was very positive.  With that little bit of research, I decided to bring
up a system which with a focus not like the other systems.  It would not
have the "techie" forums related to computers or have a large section of
shareware files.  It was going to provide an information service.

City Connection went on-line May 12, 1992.  It had no shareware files but
did have a conference devoted to the City of Cupertino.  There were
several sub-conferences providing information about the city and city hall.
And, one conference was called "Cupertino Q&A."

"Cupertino Q&A" generated several questions, which I had to answer
because the city did not want to participate at that time.  (One and
one-half years later, I co-developed another system for the community of
Cupertino, CityNet, which now gets support from Cupertino City Hall.)

City Connection stayed on-line at my home progressing slowly, actually,
not progressing in the area originally focused.  It soon became like
another BBS with a section that wasn't active, "City of Cupertino."  I
started accepting uploads of shareware and also put my shareware archives
online for users to download (most callers look for these shareware files
which are used on the 'honor-system' of payment, if you use it, pay for it.)

After one year of "just maintaining" the little bit of content on City
Connection, I was able to spend some time to concentrate on gathering more
information from any source I could.  I added Internet mail and newsgroups
during the summer of 1993 and charged a membership for users to have
Internet e-mail capabilities and access to world-wide conferences.  This
would offset the software fee and monthly Internet bills.  (If I had
marketed this feature better, I would have made a penny or two instead of
losing money every month!)

But, I kept going with this service because I felt that it was useful,
even if no one read the information that came from the White House, press
releases and speeches that were delivered automatically to my system.

The marketing was missing but the basic concept was right-on!  The
Clinton-Gore administration wanted to free up information to make it more
accessible, and California State Legislators Bates, Bowen, Hayden and
Speier created legislative bills to allow greater access to computerized
records and information for the public to retrieve.

In the Santa Clara valley, City Connection, CityNet, LiveWire and San
Jose Mercury Newspaper's Mercury Center were operating with localized
information.

City Connection, CityNet and LiveWire really concentrate on the local
communities.  We each have organizations representing the community,
and our user demographics are from the community.

THE PRESENT

Currently, City Connection has (4) 14.4k baud modems, Internet mail and
Usenet newsgroups (limited to 66), Onenet Member Network conferences
(limited to 102), and provide a gateway to private systems, keeping the
load to a minimum on their systems.

Current cities that are participating in a first-phase implementation
with council agendas are Saratoga, Cupertino and Milpitas.

The following is a list of participating organizations.

The Tropical Rainforest Coalition of the South Bay (TRC) is an all-
volunteer, nonprofit organization founded in 1991 during World Rainforest
Week. Based in San Jose, it is an affiliate of the Rainforest Action Network,
an international conservation organization.  TRC currently has over100
volunteers and supporters.

------------------
The Heritage Council of Santa Clara County is a non-profit organization
of local historical societies, history museums, archives, and heritage/
landmarks commissions.  Its' mission is to promote an awareness of and an
appreciation for the rich physical and cultural heritage of Santa Clara
County.  As a resource agency, it provides opportunities to its members and
the general public for education, funding, communication, and networking.

As a secondary goal, the Council advocates preservation of the county's
heritage by initiating or supporting community-wide projects, developing
government level understanding of heritage issues, strengthens the
relationship of tourism and historical sites/museums, and increases
community participation in local history activities.

------------------
The San Jose Downtown Association (SJDA) was formed back in 1986 when
there wasn't much downtown except for torn-up streets and vacant
storefronts. Tired of seeing their neighbors go out of business, two
business owners decided it was time for the remaining merchants to join
forces and bring downtown back to life.  The result of their call to arms
was the Downtown Association, a nonprofit organization made up of local
business and property owners who share a commitment to making downtown
San Jose a vibrant, 24-hour city center.

------------------
Independence High School is the 12th largest high school in the United
States.  Independence High School opened in 1976 and has approximately
4,000 students.  IHS boasts a professional 550 seat theater, an Olympic
swimming and diving complex, a planetarium, a gym seating 5,000, as well
as excellent industrial education shops, well equipped computer labs,
and large performing and visual arts complexes.  The 65 buildings on the
102 acre campus provides a relaxed and open learning atmosphere.

------------------
Access Los Altos is a public access channel designed for the production
and viewing of community television programs.  Local residents and
community groups can produce programs about a variety of topics, in a
variety of ways.

Our facilities, which include a full production studio, remote van,
portable field production equipment and editing, have been made possible
by an agreement with the City of Los Altos, Foothill College and United
Cable Television.

------------------
KMVT, Ch. 6, Mountain View Community Television is a non-profit, public
access cable television station serving the community of Mountain View.
KMVT offers several training workshops in beginning and advanced video
production - from basic studio production to advance remote and editing
techniques - which are open to the public at a nominal cost.

------------------
GLAADNet brings you information on the gay community through the Gay
and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation/San Francisco Bay Area chapter
(GLAAD/SFBA).

------------------
The Small Business Development Center (SBDC) is on-line with a Question
and Answer conference as well as on-line resources.

------------------
KTEH, Ch. 54 conference is now available.  Channel 54 is the South Bay's
PBS (public broadcasting system) funded by grants, donations and member-
ships from viewers like you.

------------------
KNTV, Ch. 11, The San Jose NewsChannel, is now available to hear what you
have to say.  An ABC-affiliate, KNTV represents the South Bay to Monterey/
Carmel and beyond.

My current volunteer project is providing a gateway to the Santa Clara
Sheriff's "Sheriff's On-Line Information Service" (SOLIS) and San Jose
Police Department's "CrimeBytes" on-line system.  To get their conferences
replicated on my system, a direct path wasn't possible due to some
requirements I could not fulfill.  I, then, found a local, privately operated
network of computer systems, SouthBay Org.  This network consisted of Unix-
based, DOS-based computer systems.  They were the common platform to which
the Sheriff's and the Police Department's, and my system could exchange
mail on.  We are by-passing the global "Internet" and maintaining its
pathways through local systems in the community.

By creating this relationship and by maintaining this network, any system
that is using any gatewaying protocol that is on any of our different
systems can exchange information.  We, collectively, support QWK packets,
Unix-to-Unix Copy Protocol (UUCP), FirstClass Protocol (FCP)

I continue to seek other organizations, looking for information that the
general public would find useful.

THE FUTURE

The next major phase of development is to have City Connection become a
node on the Internet which will provide access via Internet.  Conversely,
outbound traffic will be in the form of a gopher-like tool to venture
into gopher spaces from within FirstClass.

Public kiosks will be setup to access City Conections information.  It
will be preset with a special account for those users just browing.  Other
members of City Connection could still access the system from the public
kiosks with their own ID and Passcodes.

City Connection's goal is to provide a one-stop service providing
information about local communities and its organizations.  The information
will come from city halls (local governments), schools, businesses (profit
and non-profits) and residents.

City Connection strives to be innovative through information alliances
and connectivity, developing a network of community-oriented systems to
create a cyberspace of information that relates to the local community
and allows access through many system platforms and protocols.

CUSeeMe: GSH kids make history!, by Yvonne Marie Andres, Global
    Schoolhouse project
***************************************************************************

    On Friday, February 25, 8th grader David Young was interacting via
CU-SeeMe with Greg German, a researcher from Ohio.  David asked me if Greg
could send us Maven...a program that would allow us to send audio across the
Internet. Within 2 minutes Greg sent a binhexed version of Maven to me.  It
took another two minutes to install and launch Maven, and make an audio
connection with Greg!

    We were viewing each other via CU-SeeMe and talking to each other via
Maven - all over the Internet...and we were really excited!!

   We immediately called Laura C. at CNIDR to tell her of our discovery.  We
sent Maven to Laura via Fetch and within 2 minutes she had installed it and
launched and established a voice connection with Oceanside and Ohio.  Then
Laura told Jane who told George who told Don who told Priscilla...and within
another 10 minutes we were all looking at one another via CU-SeeMe and
talking to one another via Maven...ON THE INTERNET...it was beyond cool!

    Finally, Greg called Charley Kline, the author of Maven, and told him
what we were doing...and Charley also became excited...because there had
never been more than a 3-way conversation before...so Charley joined the
group via CU-SeeMe...and the students thanked him personally!

    Then Greg played music for Oceanside and Oceanside showed a video,
complete with sound to everyone else...our imaginations were running wild!
In less than 30 minutes Ohio, California, North Carolina, Illinois and
Virginia shared and implemented their discovery - and the impetus was an
8th grade GSH student!

    It makes one wonder what other great and historic events CAN and WILL
occur when students and their teachers are enroled in the Global
Schoolhouse!

    I just had to share this experience with all of you!

4.  About CUSeeMe (From: README file, Cornell Video "CU-SeeMe0.42", 9-7-93)
***************************************************************************

    Cornell University's Information Technology organization (CIT) has
developed a Macintosh videoconferencing program called CU-SeeMe.  It displays
4-bit grayscale windows at either 320x240 or half that diameter, 160x120, and
does not (yet) include audio.  CU-SeeMe in version 0.42 provides a one-one
connection or, by use of a "reflector," a one-many, several-to-several, or
several-to-many conference. Each participant can decide whether to be a
sender, a receiver, or both. Receiving requires only a Mac with a screen
capable of displaying 16 grays and a connection to the Internet.  Sending
requires the same plus a SuperMac VideoSpigot board, a camera, Quicktime and
SpigotVDIG extensions added to the system folder. Although much improved over
earlier versions, this is still BETA software-- use at your own risk. And
please treat the Internet kindly-- keep bw limits set down under 100kbps
unless you know where you're putting network load.

    The software is freely available via anonymous ftp from gated.cornell.edu
in the directory /pub/video as CU-SeeMe0.40.bin This file is
README.CU-SeeMe.txt. There is also a choice of VDIG files needed for use
with the SuperMac VideoSpigot frame grabber board. The executable and VDIG
files are stored in a MacBinary II format. It is most convenient to use
Fetch2.1 to retrieve the files as it will automatically unpack them.

    CUSeeMe has been tested in two GLOSAS Global Lecture Hall (TM) events and
is scheduled to be used again in July.  Additional files on CUSeeMe will be
made available as soon as GLOSAS files become accessible by Gopher.

of Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, or many others, with
nothing but a PC and a few hours of spare time each day
as Alice is a short book, and 10 pages a day would give
you two days off during your week.

If you want to do a Shakespeare play they are about the
same size as Alice in Wonderland.  Take a month to do a
longer favorite that can then be enjoyed free of charge
by everyone.

Subject:      setting up a gopher server


My agency wishes to install a UNIX (IBM AIX) server at it's
headquarter's office and is exploring options/costs. The
server would be used as part of the Government Information
Locator Service (GILS).

GILS is being developed to implement recent federal mandates
to make government information more accessible, including
electronic dissemination. GILS would point interested parties
to federal (and non federal) data/information. GILS data
standards (Z.39.50) will emphasize "interoperability" and
accessibility.

We want to get on-line ASAP so a fancy, state-of-the-art
system is out - for now. For the first year or two, we're not
expecting heavy traffic or large data storage needs. However,
we would like some upgrade "margin" , adding options as we
learn and the number of our field (and private?) servers
increase.

The headquarter's server would be oriented toward uniquely
Washington info (e.g. laws, regs, budget, directives, and
public affairs) but would point to other agency (and
private?) servers around the country.

Should we use a gopher-based system initially, and add a WWW
component later? I've also heard of "consolidated" gopher/WWW
servers but the WWW option may be too much too soon.

Ideas regarding internet hookup costs, hardware, software,
cost information, and REFERENCES would be be appreciated.
References should be not be too technical (i.e. primers)
since I'm still a cyber-rookie.

   Right now this class is under construction, and is not scheduled for
   official opening until 1994 May 15. If you are completely unfamiliar
   with the internet, you are more than welcome to use the services of
   the class, but be warned that you are likely to be extremely confused
   and frustrated since the class is under construction. If this happens,
   e-mail _gna-inet-consultants@mit.edu_ explaining exactly where you are
   confused so that we can improve this class. Also you may consider
   trying this class again in a few weeks.

  SCHEDULE

   The class is officially scheduled to begin on 1994 May 15. A rough
   draft of the class notes is available right now, and consultants are
   also available to answer any of your questions. You are encouraged to
   use these services even though the class has not official started.

  PROCEDURE

   To attend the course, you should fetch the GNA Personnel Form and send
   it filled to (gna-personnel@uu-gna.mit.edu). The form can also be
   obtained via anonymous FTP from ftp.desy.de in directory pub/uu-gna as
   file personnel.txt.

   Note: you should also forward a copy of the filled form to the course
   coordinator, (joe@mit.edu).

   Since many of you are unfamiliar with the internet, feel free to take
   the class as an "unregistered" student until such time that you feel
   comfortable enough with internet and know enough to send in the proper
   forms.

  FEES

   If you are taking the class, you are requested to make a donation to
   the Globewide Network Academy. This donation may or may not be
   monetary and can consist of time or energy help the university.

About the mailing lists

   The mailing lists for the course are:

  gna-inet-consultants@mit.edu
          This is the e-mail read by consultants for this class. Requests
          for help as well as questions and comments should go to this
          list.

  gna-inet-talk@mit.edu
          This is the e-mail list containing everyone registered for the
          class. This is meant for discussion and announcements
          concerning the class.

What is the World Wide Web?

   The World Wide Web [WWW] is a distributed HyperText system (a network
   of documents connected by links which can be activated
   electronically). The Introduction to the Internet class notes are
   located on WWW.

  HOW DO I GET TO THE CLASS NOTES?

   Documents on WWW each have an address which is known as a universal
   resource locator (or URL) which uniquely identifies the document. To
   read a document on WWW, you will need a special program called a WWW
   client. There are several different WWW clients on the internet
   including (mosaic, lynx, and tkWWW).

   In order to view the class notes, ask your local system manager about
   the commands needed to use WWW and to the address


http://uu-gna.mit.edu:8001/uu-gna/text/internet/welcome.html

   Please note that WWW is something different from telnet and anonymous
   ftp, and that you cannot use telnet and anonymous ftp to process a WWW
   address directly. To view a WWW address on your local machine, you
   will need a WWW client. If you do not have a WWW client, then you can
   access WWW using the instructions in the next section.

  IF THAT FAILS.......

   If you do not have a WWW client on your local machine, try typing the
   following command:


telnet info.cern.ch

   This command connects you to a machine that is running a WWW client,
   and will enable you to use most WWW features.

   Once you are connected to the Web, enter the following command


go http://uu-gna.mit.edu:8001/uu-gna/text/internet/welcome.html

   The "go" command displays the document specified by the address. This
   is the set of course notes.

  WHAT CAN I DO UNTIL THE COURSE BEGINS?

   Until the course officially begins, you can do the following
    * Complain about the course notes!!!!! The most valuable thing that
      you can do is to look at the course notes and complain about what
      makes sense and what doesn't. If you read the notes and are
      confused, this probably means that the notes need to be revised.
    * Send e-mail to (gna-inet-consultants@mit.edu) if you want to
      voluneteer to do something!!!

What is the "Virtual Campus?

   The GNA Virtual Campus is a networked ensemble of "MOOs" and "MUDs".
   MUD stands for "Multi-User Dimension". A MOO is a MUD with
   object-oriented programming capabilities). Both are interactive in
   real-time for a multiple number of users.

   During scheduled hours, online consultants will be ready to answer
   your questions on a given section of the class notes, correct your
   exercise solutions and give you (hopefully) valuable hints.

  HOW DO I GET TO THE MOO

   To connect to Diversity University MOO, the place chosen for our
   class, type


      telnet erau.db.erau.edu 8888

   Once logged in, type the following commands to be admitted as a "guest
   character" and go to our virtual classroom:


      connect guest
      @go #2896

   Consultants are currently available and are eager to answer your
   questions. A schedule is posted in the class notes. I myself will be
   available to answer questions on


    Wednesdays 1800-1900 GMT

  IF THAT FAILS.......

   If this fails, you may not have telnet. First try asking your local
   system administrator about TELNET access and the character of your
   Internet connection.

  WHAT CAN I DO UNTIL THE COURSE BEGINS?

   Consultants are now available on the MOO to answer any and all
   questions you may have on the internet.

I'm still lost.......

   If all else fails, please e-mail the class consultants
   (gna-inet-consultants@mit.edu) with your problem.

Technology's impact on culture is no longer a matter of chance but an issue
of choice. Culture is a result of the technologies we choose to implement.
We are at a point where the available technologies now present infinite
possibilities. The question is no longer What can we do? but What do we
want?

Technology is forging in a new alliance between business and culture.
Today's entrepreneur is frequently a combination of technology specialist,
cultural analyst and artist. This new generation of business people
identifies and capitalizes on business opportunities that arise where
culture and technology converge.

CULTURE TECHNOLOGIES CONVERGENCE CONFERENCE OF ONTARIO AND THE FOUR MOTORS
OF EUROPE brings together some of the best and brightest innovators from
business, the arts, museums, design, and creators and developers of new
technologies from Europe and Ontario. Delegates from related but separate
areas of expertise will join to bring new perspective to issues of current
importance in culture and technology from their own unique vantage points.
Internationally renowned in their fields, many of the speakers are owners or
directors of businesses that involve the successful merging of culture and
technology - people who have taken the critical leap to turn what they have
imagined into a business reality.

CONFERENCE PACKAGE:  $300 CDN    Students $175 (+ GST)
Including: sessions noted PLUS: opening reception at the Design Exchange,
May 25;  dinner and performances using new technologies at the Art Gallery
of Ontario, May 26;  free 3-day admission to the MULTIMEDIA '94 Trade show,
