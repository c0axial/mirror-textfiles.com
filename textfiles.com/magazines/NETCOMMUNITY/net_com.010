=====================================================
LEGISLATION and RELATED ACTIVITIES

The pace of legislative activity outside the Federal arena is
picking up dramaticly. This week posting to various lists showed
that at least 3 states, Minessota, Vermont, and Washington had
groups working on legislation philosophicly in line with the
Clinton agenda. In addition municipal legislation is being worked
on in Seattle and a neighbourhood oriented effort is underway in
Harlem.

------------------------
Efforts to move the agenda on the regulatory front include Bell
Atlantic's submission to the Department of Justice for a
regulatory waiver. It included evidence that foreign telco-
companies operating in the states are free to act in ways that
U.S. companies can't.

"It is ironic, while Bell Atlantic must wait
for a waiver to be approved, foreign telephone companies are
already beginning to provide long distance telephone and
satellite delivery services on U.S. soil."  British Telecom now
owns an interest in MCI, which provides long distance and is
preparing to enter the local  telephone business in the U.S.
Similarly, Bell Canada plans to provide local telephone service
through its ownership interest in the cable
systems of Jones Intercable.

Cable TV companies, like TCI and Liberty, have never
operated under the restrictions imposed on the Bell companies by
the MFJ. As a result, a number of the cable TV properties owned
by TCI and Liberty cross existing LATA boundaries, and the
companies utilize satellite ransmission to deliver programming.
The waiver Bell Atlantic is seeking would resolve decree issues
relating to the merger." {between bell and TCI- ed}

James Love <love@essential.org> reports that the

TAXPAYER ASSETS PROJECT  is working on the issue of
PUBLIC AND PRIVATE NETWORKS, AND THE STATUS OF
PUBLIC RECORDS, OPEN MEETINGS, AND FOIA

Government officials are trying to avoid making records of their
actions and communications public, by using commercial services
or storing their records at internet sites outside the U.S.
TAP is trying to get legislation passed to prevent this abuse of
the public's right to know.

In an indirectly related matter the World Wildlife Fund is
seeking regulatory assistance from the Whitehouse in "  directing
all agencies of the federal government to establish processes for
accepting on-line comments to public notices. Please express
support by sending your comments to president@whitehouse.gov --
Bill Clinton's e-mail address.

The issue here is one of refusing to permit citizen access to
governmental proceedings by the most expedient means available.


----------------------
One of those active in framing the Washington state legislation
is all a proponent of a populist alternative to civic nets.
The idea is creating a telecommunication cooperative. This is a
legal business form in the U.S. The item makes it clear that the
pricing is very attractive and the concept needs very little
legislative support to go further. I found the material
informative and was struck by the possibility of uniting the
cooperative idea with the idea of civic networking. Many people
involved in the Civic movement resent those who want to use such
organization merely as "onramps to the Internet"; This offers an
interesting alternative approach.

=================================================================

=======
-1- Why a cooperative?
=======
  Cheap, easy, and fast Internet service is something  a  lot  of
people look forward to. Why isn't it available now? One answer is
that big companies haven't found a way to make a lot of money  at
it.

  That doesn't mean it can't be done tho. If you want  a  product
or  service that isn't available where you are, one way to get it
is to form a cooperative to provide it! A cooperative is a  group
of  people  each  contributing a little bit of their time, money,
and organizational skills to the group for their mutual benefit.
Cooperatives have a long and successful history in  the  United
States;  there are electric, telephone, and water cooperatives in
many communities around the country. Why not an Internet coopera-
tive?
=======
-2- Other Internet Cooperatives
=======
In fact, most of the Internet is already owned and operated  by
cooperatives; NorthWestNet, BARRnet, CERFnet, and other 'regional
networks' are cooperatives that  serve  organizations  (colleges,
corporations)  instead of individuals. The NSFnet, the 'backbone'
of the Internet,  is  a  cooperative  that  serves  the  regional
cooperatives.
          .....................................

=======
-4- How much will it cost?
=======
Leasing data lines and  paying  commercial  Internet  providers
costs money, but by sharing it we can reduce the cost to where we
can each afford it individually.
It's a lot easier nowadays to get  a  connection  without  many
restrictions  on  it-- one that we can distribute to other people
freely. SprintLink sells service like this, and it is possible to
get  resellable service from other vendors or organizations. This
fairly recent development makes it a great deal easier to share a
connection.
A high speed (T1) Internet feed from a commercial provider  can
cost  almost  $3,000  per  month-- but if 60 people share it, the
cost per person is only $50; if 120 people share it,  it  is  $25
per  month. And that is for near-Ethernet bandwidth to the Inter-
net! Until recently the University of Washington, all 50,000 stu-
dents and staff, used just one (1) T1 Internet feed...! Of course
there are the costs in-city to  connect  us  together,  but  each
group  can pay the cost of a lower-cost leased line to connect to
the Coop's Internet feed, and pay some of  the  costs  associated
with obtaining the feed.

-------------------------
Regarding the effort in SEATTLE:
"In 1990, Washington State passed a comprehensive Growth
Management Act which required municipalities to prepare
detailed plans for sustainable development.
In April, after three years of consultation with all segments
of the community, the City of Seattle published its 531-page
Draft Comprhensive Plan (DCP). This contains detailed analyses
and proposals around issues of land use, transportation,
housing, utilities, economic development, neighborhood
planning, and citizen participation.

As part of our ongoing work with various City agencies and
other groups on community network development, Horse Horse
Lion Lion presented a report to the Planning Department on how
community networks could further the goals of the DCP.

browsing to all comers for free. i will be offering value-added
services (which will not not restrict access) in the future. this
would be something like fax-back, and weekly sheets on action for
legislation of interest to you. for those who have the time, but
not the dineros, please gopher on over! for those who over being
over-charged for legislative info and want value-

Despite an effort by one regular participant, postings to the
Communet listserv did not respond to last weeks White House
request for ideas related to the new empowerment zones
initiative.

DISCUSSIONS

Communet  <listserv@uvmvm.bitnet>

A few messages strongly critical of the administrations approach
were posted. These focused on the administrations interest in
seeing the net build primarily with corporate funds. One poster
said that the initiative ignores the cooperative spirit that
characterized the development of the Internet. Another noted that
prior efforts to regulate the telecommunications industry have
all been deemed failures.

The most interesting posting on the theme of business involvement
was a speech which reviewed the history of business efforts to
produce financially viable network systems. To date dozens of
efforts involving hundreds of millions of dollars have largely
failed. There are a few exceptions, such as America Online, now
emerging.

-------------------------
NPTN admin listserv

Most of the postings discussed issues related to community
support. A secondary thread dealt with the use of World Wide Web.
The TREND section includes information on WWW and civic nets.

Tom Grunder - the founder of the Civic network movement posted a
message designed to redirect some of the focus of the freenet
movement back to its original goals. A few respondants felt that
focus as Grundner expressed it was too narrow.

"we occupy a unique niche, one that is not (as yet) occupied by
ANYone else because what we're advocating is perceived as either
not profitable enough, not sexy enough, completely crazy, or all
three.  THAT fact is our shelter, and I believe the key to our
survival and eventually our prosperity.  Our view is both valid
and unique and, more importantly, one that MUST be returned
to once the current sugar-high wears off.

   The following is what I believe a Free-Net is about.
It is not to say that what others are doing is wrong--it's
just not what WE do.  If you depart from it, I think
you are doing so at your peril.
........

   What constitues a Free-Net?  How do you distinguish it from,
let's say, a simple BBS that a hobbiest might run?  In many ways
that is what this entire book is about, but I think there are
some distinguishing characteristics that we can summarize.

1) *First and foremost, a Free-Net system is driven by the
information and communications needs of the community.*  As you
will see below, the key ingredient in the operation of any Free-
Net are the "sysops" (System Operators)--the community volunteers
who, by operating the various SIGs (Special Interest Groups) give
your system its unique character.  But more importantly, it is
these community information providers that cause your system to
literally wrap itself around the information needs of your
community.  In short, a Free-Net is not something that YOU do for
the community; it is something the community does for itself.

2) *A community computer has its governance and organizational
roots in the community.*  No Free-Net was ever created by one
person.  No Free-Net was ever operated by one person.  No one
person "owns" any given Free-Net.  And it is definitely NOT
something you do in your basement as a hobby.  It is a
professionally operated system that is designed to serve the
broadest possible spectrum of people in your community.  As a
result, the organizing committees you form and the governing
boards you create, must reflect the diversity of that
population-- schools, government, the business community, senior
citizens, handicapped, and so on.

3) *A Free-Net is free--sort'a.*  Free-Net community computers
were originally designed to be completely free to the user in the
same sense that a public library, for example, is free to its
patrons.  This, however, is not the same thing as saying that
they cost nothing to operate; and the on-going challenge of
raising the monies to support these systems is one of the
critical issues facing community networking today.
........
Most Free-Nets are indeed "free to the user."
Some Free-Nets are... well... let's call them "Cheap-Nets."
ALL systems, however, are dedicated to bringing the benefits of
the Information Age, to as many people as possible, at the lowest
cost possible.

4) *A community computer is a multi-user system.*  That is, it is
a computer that can be accessed by more than one person at a
time. This can range from a four or five line system in a very
rural area, to 150-200 line system at a large urban site.  The
mission of a community computer is to serve the information and
communications needs of a large and diverse population.  You will
need a multi-line system to even begin to do that.

5) *A community computer has connectivity to the world outside
of itself.*  Just as your city does not live in a vacuum, neither
does your community computer system.  As a result, all of the
Free-Nets associated with our organization, the National Public
Telecomputing Network, are connected in some way to the Internet.
In some cases this connection is via a direct, high-speed, 1.4 mb
per second T-1 connection; and in other cases it might be via a
2400 baud "uucp" link that fetches electronic mail twice a day--
but the connection is there.  This is an important
characteristic.

6) *A community computer is NOT just an on-ramp to the Internet.*
What I am about to write is considered heresy in some quarters
(nothing new in that), but... I think the Internet is, by itself,
a trap.  I know that everyone is excited about the prospects of
Information Superhighways, and newer, faster, more powerful
networks.
   BUT...
I do not believe America's progress into the Information Age
will be measured by the number of people we can make *dependent*
upon the Internet.  I believe that, if we enter this age with
equity at all, it will be because of LOCAL people, building LOCAL
systems, to meet LOCAL needs.  That's YOU, building Free-Nets, in
cities and towns all over the country.  THAT is how we will enter
this new age with equity!

EVENTS

UPCOMING PUBLIC INTEREST MEETING

a group of some 100 public interest groups is organizing a
"Public Interest Summit on the National Data Superhighway"  for
February 22 in Washington, probably at the Smithsonian.  For more
information on the Public Interest Data Summit, contact the
Center for Media Education, Jeff Chester, 202-628-2620, or email:
cme@access.digex.net

[ Attendance at events like this is vital if we are to fight for
control of part of the net from interests like those holding the
next conference listed. ed ]

---------------------------
A conference from the Internet Society on the other kind of
community networking......This is the corporate version and
vision. Notice that the planners are listed alphabeticly by
Corporation. Business first - people second. Oh Well....

FIRST INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON COMMUNITY NETWORKING
INTEGRATED MULTIMEDIA SERVICES TO THE HOME
July 13-14, 1994
Westin Hotel, San Francisco Bay, California, USA
Sponsored by the IEEE Communications Society
In collaboration with ACM SIGCOMM, the Internet Society, and
Smart Valley

Community networking concerns the network infrastructures that
will bring integrated multimedia services to home users.
.......community networking services will not necessarily be work
oriented and will range from entertainment to shopping to
information services.  At present, community networking
technology is driven by the requirements of video-on-demand, most
notably high bandwidth (compared to narrowband), bandwidth
asymmetry, and the delay-jitter constraints imposed by today's
limited-storage TV set-top devices.  As various other
services develop, community networking will evolve to include
integrated multimedia communication and user-to-user
applications.  Community networking must also provide access to
resources located outside the community, in an increasingly
global repository of information of every conceivable type.
Since very little has been published to date on the topic of
community networking, this workshop will give researchers and
professionals the chance to share their views and advance the
state of the art in this field.

RELEVANT AREAS: Contributions are encouraged in the four areas
listed below with relevant topics:

1. APPLICATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS: types of applications; coding;
set-top operating systems; QoS networking requirements
(symmetric/asymmetric bandwidth, delay, and losses); security
and privacy; service models; user interface and navigation
facilities.

2. LOCAL DISTRIBUTION TECHNOLOGY: topology; fiber /cable /UTP
/wireless; modulation, bandwidth allocation; MAC (reverse
channel); role of ATM; dependencies on equipment/network in the
home (e.g., TV set-top).

TRENDS

More and more Civic Networks are exploring gopher and World Wide
Web. The first WWW based freenet has just been announced. The
following material will be useful to those interested in further
investigating the use of WWW for their system.

-------------------------------
Introduction: What is World Wide Web
Rather than merely a menu of items and ascii text or images (as
with gopher), hypertext allows fully formatted text.
WWW clients can also directly access the following servers:
* WAIS * Network News * Gopher * Telnet * Anonymous FTP
* TechInfo * X.500 * WHOIS

----------------------------------
The Huron Valley Free-Net will be going on-line on May 1, 1994.
For software, the HVFN is taking a progressive step in using the
World Wide Web protocol as the core of its Managed Access Shell.
The HVFN will not only provide complete and friendly vt100
service, but will also allow access via free GUI clients such as
Mosaic.  e-mail mythical@mpcc.org

The group has started a discussion listserv on Web for civic
nets. Conntact the above site for more information.

----------------------------------------
If you'd like to try the World Wide Web, some of the browsers are
available in the following directory: "World Wide Web Clients"
from the gopher   --->        www0.cern.ch

* Terminal based browsers
* PC Running Windows
* Macintosh
* X-Windows
* NeXTStep

-------------------------------------
An upcomming conference relating to Web matters is being planned:

the NCSA Software Development Group (SDG) is planning an
information technologies software user conference with a focus on
Mosaic to be held sometime in late May or early June, 1994.

Now is your chance to help determine the topics for that
conference. SDG is considering including Collage and HDF as well
as Mosaic topics. Please take a look at the topics listed below
and tell us which ones would be of interest. Also list any other
topics that you think would be of use to a number of people. We
are interested in hearing all of your suggestions.
Direct all responses to: citconf94@ncsa.uiuc.edu .

Topics under consideration:
* Future outlooks:
        1. Where we stand now - current status.
        2. What is the future of Mosaic?
        3. What is the future of the network?
        4. What is the future of cyberspace?
5. What should be encouraged in WWW development?
        6. Who are the communities we should be hearing more
from?
        7. What is the future of HDF and
integration?
        8. What is the future of CIT at NCSA?

* Interesting applications. Mosaic and WWW use:
        1. in libraries
2. in education
        3. in medicine
        4. in business

The level of interest has been spectacular.  Web use grew over
3,000 percent in 93. The percent of Internet based information
now stored on WWW sites has gone from 5% to 50% in one year. All
told an estimated 130 Terabytes of data is on web servers.

=========================================
THE CANADIAN DOMAIN - A BACKGROUND REPORT
=========================================

Canada's various levels of government is just beginning to take a
serious interest in the opportunities and challenges presented by
the Internet.

The per capita growth of the Internet has been slower in Canada
that in the U.S.

As of January 21, 1994 Canada had a Total of 792 registered
domains,  with the most impressive numbers coming from the
University section;  where almost all libraries are now internet
connected and have accessible catalogues.

The past year saw one other section with remarkable growth. The
freenet movement has really taken hold. Freenets will soon
stretch across Canada from coast to coast. Every major city has a
community network in the planning stages. Gareth Shearman -
maintainer of the official Canadian Freenet list -  reports the
following activity.
