        I'm b-a-a-a-c-k!!! (Gee, I hope Jack Nicholson doesn't sue me for
stealing his line.)  It's been a busy 3 weeks.  My niece is doing well,
my ribs are feeling better, and I have started a new job.  Now I can get
back to writing this newsletter.  I apologize for the delays and beg your
forgiveness!

        I am starting to make the changes in the newsletter that I
promised earlier in the year.  Within the next month I will be providing
more of the content myself versus the cut and paste of Edupage, etc.  If
their are any aspiring writers out there (you know who you are!) send me
articles for inclusion.

        Until next week...

Subject: Social Contract Project and Networking
To: civic-values@civic.net
Reply-To: civic-values@civic.net

It occurs to me that an aspect of the Social Contract Project that I
mentioned in passing in my post to Pat relates to various conversations here
and on Communet relating to the possibilities of this medium.

Though we began developing the project in Philadelphia three years ago, it
was always our intent to try to gain interest in using this technique around
the country. Through my involvement in the National Community Development
Association, representing local community development coordinators, there
are various cities that might be interested. Beyond this, people from
Baltimore and Albuqerque have exchanged correspondence with us on the
program.

It was in response to trying to figure out how we could provide
support to such people and groups that I decided to check out the
possibilities of the Internet. Here was a way, I imagined, that people
working in local areas on a particular program could support one another
without having to get on planes every month.

People here have speculated how community networking might be used to
advance real work beyond the kind of exchanges that we already have. Well,
here's one activist who came to this media with that in mind.

So the offer is open to Civic-Values list members--and anyone else you think
should know about it. If you think that developing social contracts in your
community along the lines that I describe in my posts on Queen Village,
etc., would make a positive contribution to building community in your area,
we are prepared to build a national network through this medium of groups
and people involved in the process.

Who knows? Perhaps this should be one of the ongoing themes within this
list itself, among the many projects ought to be of interest to us here.

----------------------------Original message----------------------------
I have issued an update of my paper on using Windows software for accessing
internet resources. This release contains new material on basic internet
functions and services, as well as updated information on shareware clients.
An abstract of the paper is included at the end of this note.

The complete document in ASCII format is about 52,000 bytes. It is available
by anonymous ftp from:

WINDOWS AND TCP/IP FOR INTERNET ACCESS
-------- ABSTRACT

Internet, the global network of computer networks, is arousing enormous
popular interest. In part, this interest is being driven by the
availability of free or inexpensive shareware software for Microsoft
Windows. It is now technically simple for a personal computer to become a
host on the internet. The casual user can find, retrieve, and view
information gathered from around the world without having to learn
complicated computer commands. In this paper, I describe the principal
functions and services available via the internet. Then I outline the
technical background and terminology needed by the beginner who wants to
make his PC a host on the internet. Finally, I describe several Windows
software packages and programs that facilitate using internet services.
All the software is freely available over the internet.

        Management of nonprofit organizations, fundraising,
grant resources, building business/nonprofit partnerships,
volunteer recruitment techniques, critical evaluation of
nonprofit organizations, donor concerns, client issues (e.g.
privacy), the role of nonprofits in the online world and how to
use online resources to strengthen nonprofit agencies and promote
wise giving practices.

        The group will soon be bidirectionally gatewayed to the
mailing list usnonprofit-l@rain.org.

P.S. While the topic of fundraising is mentioned in the charter,
it would probably be better to discuss the issue of fundraising on
this newsgroup, rather than using it as a medium for solicitation.

             INTERNATIONAL MEETING ON COMMUNITY COMMUNICATION

Is there a VIRTUAL COMMUNITY?

What is it and where is it?

How do you become part of it?

What role does that VIRTUAL COMMUNITY play and will play in shaping the
changes that are being called for?

Can South American countries be a part of this GLOBAL COMMUNITY?

Is there any priority being given to upgrading the obsolete
telecommunications infrastructure in countries like Venezuela so they can
be a part of such a COMMUNITY?

Who is opposed to that change and why?

Do the members of that VIRTUAL COMMUNITY have anything to say about the
crisis in COMMUNITIES in general, and in Venezuelan communities in
particular?

Why haven't Latin American governments decided to use ISDN?

What role do social communicators play in the IDENTIFICATION AND SOLUTION
of the problems with old community forms that are the background of the
NEW VIRTUAL COMMUNITY?

Can the new technologies dissolve the old North/South disparities or will
they accentuate ideological differences?

Does it make sense to continue the old nationalistic discourse in the new
world-wide circumstances and with the interchange of digital information?

Are liberty of expression, voluntary search for identity with similar
groups, and free use of social communication for the exchange of
information and private opinion, compatible with the monopolies and lobbies
of organized journalists and/or media impresarios?

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
             INTERNATIONAL MEETING ON COMMUNITY COMMUNICATION
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Pampero Ecological Foundations, the Venezuela Neighbor's School, among
others, invite all the VIRTUAL COMMUNITY to participate in the first
INTERNATIONAL MEETING ON COMMUNITY COMMUNICATION by responding to any of
the topics listed above, or any others that you propose by E-mail.
***************************************************************************
To participate all you have to do is send an E-mail message to
plopez@conicit.ve
***************************************************************************

Please be BRIEF, DIRECT AND SIMPLE.:-)

Present your *private electronic opinion*.  In Venezuela we also want to
know points of view from the VIRTUAL COMMUNITY on the problems that beset
all communities.  We want to hear the murmur of the computers whenever
they may be connected to minds that are functioning.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The messages that are received will be shared with an audience of 400
participants made up of journalists, neighbors, artists and social
communicators from Venezuela and other parts of the planet.  They are part
of the documented record OF THE COMMUNICATION EXPERIENCE IN CYBERSPACE that
is being realized in the context of the meeting.  We think that
considerable discussion will be stimulated.

The event will take place at the Romulo Gallegos Center for Latin American
Studies in the city of Caracas, Venezuela, on July 11 and 12, 1994.  It is
proposed that wide-opened discussions will be stimulated that include
citizens, pioneers, the new visionary communicators that are part of the
VIRTUAL COMMUNITY.

GET CONNECTED, by just mentioning those two words.  Messages are received
24 hours a day at

     plopez@conicit.ve
