1. WHAT BUSINESS NEEDS FROM THE FREENET COMMUNITY
==================================================

There are a variety of professional groups, university programs,
government programs and private external sources that provide
service or information that is important to business.
Freenets have an opportunity to benefit themselves and the
community by providing an opportunity for these organizations to
join in developing an online "non commercial" set of assistance
services to the small business community.

Small business is now creating over 80% of all new jobs. That means
that anything we can do to assist the development and survival of
small business in our communities is of benefit to everyone.

The Freenet movement is now debating the role of business in the
freenet sphere. Without taking a position personally. I would like
to point out one method for the movement to serve the needs of the
businesses in their communities and improve the possibilities of
fundraising - without compromising the traditional principals of
this effort.


          What Civic Nets offer the Business Community
          --------------------------------------------

Before freenets came into existence assistance programs for
business operated in isolation. Only the library might have an
outdated guide to local assistance resources. Our movement creates
the opportunity for a more efficient form of access and use of
these dispersed resources. We are all aware of our potential to
improve the delivery of government services, non profit services
and even recreation information. The same is just as true for
business.

Freenets can provide information about these resources. Our systems
can also provide direct technical assistance. If business
assistance is readily accessible at your site; its much easier to
gain support from the Business community and local government.

Because membership in a Freenet is free; we have unique advantages
over any other potential supplier of business information. Most
businesses will choose to use commercial access providers for their
net services. With competition in your community, the business will
be located on several systems. No matter how good the services on
any one system are they wont have the "reach" of freenet based
services. So freenets will be the necessary glue that ties together
the whole business community. This is the basis for gaining
business support and participation in our movement. All the other
services we offer just makes our system that much more likely to
be used by businesses. We have a attractive mix that creates an
appeal no one else can match.

The primary resources which we can assist locally, are usually
local chambers of commerce, university business assistance
programs, industry trade associations and the many varieties of
Small Business Development Center programs.

          What Small Businesses Want - and need
          -------------------------------------

Companies - especially new small businesses - are interested
PRIMARILY in learning more about funding sources. More than half
the calls received by groups offering assistance to small business
ask for information on where to find money. While there are sources
for local, state, provincial and federal funding; your local
business people often do not know how to find and use the programs.

For more established businesses, another major need is information
on how firms can benefit from government and university research
and technology.

While money and technology is what business people want; they
usually need a great deal of help with:

business plans
regulatory and licensing information
tax issues
employment rules and regulations
computerized accounting systems
other financial controls
other information automation systems
improved customer service
marketing strategies
domestic sales strategies
international sales
developing new products
improving existing products
manufacturing production changes
health and safety issues.

The specific nature of the needs of a business tend to vary with
its stage of development. Generally  - Start-Up -  Expansion
and -    Turnaround or Crisis Management - stages present unique
problems.  Women and Minority groups may also benefit from programs
that help them with the special problems involved in their
participation in Business.


2.        ON - LINE SMALL BUSINESS CENTERS
===========================================

A new activity on the Internet is the provision of online business
services. Such services can offer many forms of aid. There are 4
primary forms of assistance.

Information pamphlets
Interactive access to referral assistance
Interactive self help forums on-line
Interactive access to direct assistance

The simplest activity to start with is providing pamphlets about
existing programs and organizations along with some general how to
information.
The innovative services that are perfect for civic nets are the on-
line interactive services. These can provide technical assistance
in preparing the business plan, and they help with regulatory and
licensing problems. They may also provide technical assistance in
business management areas, new product development, procurement,
energy management and advise or assistance in gaining access to
capital from private sources.

New business managers often need a full range of services. The
owner of an existing business can often benefit from access from
a peer based conference dealing with his or her firms problem.


          DISPENSING PAMPHLETS ABOUT OTHER ORGANIZATION
               AND HOW TO INFORMATION
          ---------------------------------------------

Freenets are an ideal resource for dispensing passive information.
We offer uniquely easy access and retrieval. We never run out of
copies of a brochure and its always the most current one available.
Groups will want to print their own material to hand out on site;
but they can benefit by being able to grab copies of other
services' brochures from the free-net's "rack" and provide them on
demand to their walk in clients.
     A good "rack" can include information about:

BUSINESS SERVICE CENTRES
HOW TO INFORMATION
INFORMATION FOR EMPLOYERS
LOAN PROGRAM AND GRANT SOURCES
EMPLOYEE AND WORKSITE SAFETY INFORMATION
SECURITY INFORMATION
SOLE PROPRIETORSHIP & CORPORATE REGISTRATION
TAXES AND LICENSES
PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS
INDUSTRY & TRADE GROUPS
LOCAL BUSINESS DIRECTORIES
COLLEGE & PRIVATE BUSINESS TRAINING PROGRAMS
     Vocational
     Entrepreneurship
     Technical
     Managerial
PUBLIC LIBRARIES AS BUSINESS INFORMATION SOURCES
FOREIGN CONSULS & TRADE OFFICES
FOREIGN LANGUAGE TRAINING PROGRAMS
REGIONAL & INTERNATIONAL TRADE PROGRAMS
SERVICES AND FACILITIES FOR VISITING BUSINESS PEOPLE



          ON-LINE REFERRAL PROGRAMS
          -------------------------

The least demanding of the Interactive services is operating an on-
line referral service. These can be staffed by local business
librarians or by staff from a local assistance center or by
volunteer retired businesspeople. These may involve using an
existing database of services or your folks may have to design and
maintain a new one.


      DIRECT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS
      --------------------------

          LOCAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS AS A RESOURCE

Problem oriented direct assistance activities can be "staffed" by
employees of existing programs. The ease of on-line interaction
makes free-net based consulting especially useful for dealing with
activities like:

   Loan Packaging
        Projections
        Business Plans
        Cash Flow Analysis

   Financing Programs
        Governmental
        Private Lenders
        Venture Capital

   Export Marketing
        Financing
        One-on-one Counselling
        Planning and Research

   Market Research Assistance
        Census information
        Local business lists
        Yellow pages information

   Planning for Employee Training
        On-the-Job Training
        Classroom Training
        Custom Designed Training Programs

     LOCAL BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS AS A RESOURCE

Local professional Associations may also be willing to staff
moderated listservs or on-line assistance programs that deal with
their members areas of expertise. Typical programs include:

1 - ONE STOP OR SHORT TERM SERVICES

General Business Assistance Centers
Small Business Assistance Centres

2 - PROJECT ORIENTED LONG TERM ASSISTANCE

Service Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE)
University Based Small Business Institutes

3 - ASSISTANCE FOR TARGETED POPULATIONS

Minority Business Assistance Programs
Women Entrepreneurs Networks
Business Incubator Programs

4 - ASSISTANCE IN SINGLE PROBLEM AREAS

Bar Association Programs
Accountants Society Programs



          SELF HELP ORIENTED PROGRAMS
          ---------------------------

A series of unmoderated conferences can also be started. These
should reflect your local communities needs. They can be general
interest or focused. One especially attractive conference can cover
business software and technology. Another could focus on local
regulatory issues.


3. SEEKING THE ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT OF BUSINESS GROUPS
=============================================================

Generally organizations like Accountant's Associations, Advertising
Associations, Insurance Groups, and Law Societies can usually be
brought on line. You may also have some success with Computer
professionals, and services oriented to specific business sectors
like Retail Trade, Real Estate, Manufacturing, or Farming.

Existing service programs may see you as a rival, but careful
cultivation will generally bring them aboard soon.

A business outreach committee composed of members who are business
people will do the most effective work in involving these groups.


4. SEEKING FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY
=======================================================

The search for financial support involves teaching local groups
like chambers of commerce and private businesses about the ways a
freenet can increase the community's income and employment levels.
Your hit squad can talk about:

       Helping existing businesses expand.
       Attracting new business and investment.
       Encouraging start-up activity.
       Fostering small business growth and entrepreneurial skills.
       Pursuing legislative and administrative reforms
       Benefiting the business community through superior services.
       Increasing employment levels
       Diversifying work opportunities
       Providing statistical and analytical data to support
           economic development efforts.

    WHY BUSINESSES GIVE SUPPORT?

When going after the support of individual businesses; it helps to
understand what motivates their charitable contributions. Some of
that motivation is simple self interest. Creating an on-line small
business center appeals to that self interest.

When planning a corporate funding campaign, there is one basic
fact that must be recognized.

           THEY DON'T HAVE TO GIVE

Companies have no legal obligation to support community or non
profit activities. Every contribution represents money that would
otherwise have gone to pay taxes, to pay shareholders, or to
reinvestment in future growth.  Charitable support is generally
seen as an "investment".

           WHAT'S IN IT FOR THEM?

Corporate gifts are rarely altruistic. Companies are looking for
a primary benefit to their community of customers, employees, and
shareholders, and only secondarily to the society at large.

Given this very business-like attitude its easy to understand
that the following are the main reasons companies give. I list
them here in the order they are most often mentioned by companies,
not in the order that matters most to freenets seeking support.

     THE BOTTOM LINE ON SUPPORT

A: SUPPORTING SERVICES THAT BENEFIT EMPLOYEES AND THEIR FAMILIES.

Freenets serve employees and families by improving their access
to community services [like the availability of womens' shelters]
or emergency child care services, community information of all
types, and to direct personal help in the form of moderated
information services. Our services also benefit many of the
organizations that employees and their families may turn to.

With a business service in our freenet structure we also help build
and maintain the economic basis of the community. We will actually
help create more customers for all the businesses in our
communities. That helps improve job security for everyone.

B: SUPPORTING SERVICES THAT EDUCATE EMPLOYEES & RAISE THEIR SKILL
     LEVELS.

While this is usually the motivation for supporting higher
education; Freenets can point out two related benefits.
First, that we are teaching our members a set of computer related
skills that are of growing importance to business. Freenet
members are learning RESEARCH SKILLS, ONLINE COMMUNICATION
SKILLS, AND IMPROVING THEIR KNOWLEDGE Of A WIDE VARIETY OF
INFORMATION RESOURCES, SOME OF WHICH ARE VERY USEFUL TO BUSINESS.

Second, freenets are SIMPLIFYING ACCESS to information that can
be of direct benefit to business. We are after all simplifying
ACCESS TO LIBRARY CATALOGUES FULL OF BUSINESS INFORMATION. Along
with a host of government data of interest to businesses.
The on-line access you create will directly strength all businesses
in the community. It will help them improve their operations and
lower the failure rate among new businesses.

C: PROVIDING PUBLIC RECOGNITION AND PRESTIGE TO THE COMPANY

Most gifts to cultural institutions and the arts are
justified this way.

Freenets have a special advantage here. Any business support can
be acknowledged on line and in the case of support for phone
lines, over and over again. Contributing to the success of a
major community service does contribute to the good will of the
general community towards specific businesses. And freenet are
very much cultural institutions - of a very new kind.

D: IMPROVING THE MARKET FOR A COMPANY'S PRODUCTS

This is the main motivation for corporate support for
special events and sporting activities. Its no accident the beer
and cigarette companies love to sponsor outdoor summer events.

In the early stages of fundraising - this may be the single most
important reason that can presented to organizations which can
offer interactive services or pamphlets in asking for their
support. The case for the value to them must be made in a very
professional way. The fundraisers first task is to understand
just what your free-net has to offer your business community in
the way of a marketing opportunity.

Reaching the freenet membership is far more effective -COST
EFFECTIVE - than a $50,000 .oo newspaper add. And it works year
in and year out.

Once the first company donates to you; you can tell the next
company you are going to about the brilliant marketing decision
company #1 just made.

F: SUPPORTING GROUPS IN WHICH EMPLOYEES ARE INVOLVED

The vast majority of businesses do not have either staffing
or a formal process to control contributions. Instead they let
the interests of their employees govern most of their
contributions.

We are all in the business of recruiting volunteers. Efforts to
recruit volunteers from the business community will rarely be
wasted. Some Larger companies actually match employee
contributions with a similar gift. The most straightforward way
of getting business volunteers, is to make presentations to
business related associations. Of particular value are
presentation before the many associations of computer
professionals. It is occasionally possible to be adopted as a
project by one or more of these associations and computer clubs.

A poll of your supporters will usually lead directly to several
such groups with whom they are affiliated.

In the case of the on-line business center it may pay to have the
major local business association "adopt" the center as its project.

G: RESPONDING TO PEER PRESSURE

Many companies don't know who is "real" or worthwhile. Its
reassuring to the management to be told that the big guys have
checked you out and decided to support you.

Once a local corporate leader has contributed, its much easier to
get others to give. If the company officers will make even casual
calls to their peers on your behalf, your prospects are all the
better.

H: CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP - MAINTAINING GOOD COMMUNITY RELATIONS

This is the least effective direct appeal but it figures in
most decisions. So don't forget that you really are creating or
running a major new community service.  Its important to let them
know that even by supporting only the business services they are
strengthening the entire free-net and benefit all of your
community.

Since most freenets are not only available from home and office
computers, but also from assorted public sites; its invaluable to
know how many patrons your affiliated libraries and agencies are
seeing each year. This number should be prominently displayed in
your materials and mentioned at fundraising meetings. It creates
"goodwill" for companies when they are seen as directly
benefiting the community by supporting the freenet movement.
Free-nets provide an excellent opportunity to be seen doing good.

Of course these same numbers are also worth mentioning to
companies that service first time buyers when looking for their
support. Training firms, computer insurers, small system sellers,
etc., should all be approached to cover phone line costs. And
they should all be reminded of the number of potential new
customers who can see them mentioned when connecting to your
free-net.

A NOTE ON CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AND IRRESPONSIBILITY

Lest this seem to be offering a white wash of the many
problems created or contributed to by bad business practices; I
have no interest in seeing free-net sell their soul to business.
I expect part of every dollar raised to go toward providing
better public access to data about polluters, fraudulent schemes,
self interested legislative efforts, etc. I just don't believe
business is all bad or all good. As a community information
resource we have a responsibility to display all the faces of
business.

     The flip side of all of this is something know in the
corporate world as CAUSE RELATED MARKETING. This now represents
about 15% of most larger companies contributions budget. Business
publications have bluntly described its purposes as "enhancing
corporate image, thwarting criticism, pacifying customers and
easing market entry."  Every freenet's directors while have to
deal with the ethical dilemmas involved. My personal view is that
we have an obligation to ask for this money and see that it is
used to create a fully informed public. But, we have to avoid
being abused by the worst of these offers. An example of abuse by
a cause related marketing scheme is this gem.  In 1987, just
prior to thanksgiving, American Express spent $50,000.00 on an ad
offering to donate 10 cents to New York MEALS ON WHEELS for every
meal ordered with their card over the holiday. New Yorkers would
have had to order half a million meals just to match the ad
budget.


            WHAT TYPES OF SUPPORT ARE AVAILABLE?

A: CASH

B: SERVICES - LEGAL - ACCOUNTING - MARKETING

Most major firms donate some services. Law firms are often
required to do so.

C: EQUIPMENT - GIFTS & LOANS

If you can't get equipment donated - try getting it loaned.
If local resources are poor try getting a preferential
price.

Freenets by their nature are not on the cutting edge of
computer technology. Your success rate will be highest if you
know the product lines and consistently ask for last years
models. That help remove dead inventory and convert it real
advertising and goodwill development.

D: ADVERTISING

Ask companies to work you into their print adds and handout
materials.

E: CONTACTS WITH OTHER COMPANIES

As mentioned previously no one has better connections in the
business community than an active business person.

F: FURNITURE

Most medium and large firms have a storage area for
currently unused stuff. Ask around - why spend money on
furnishings.

G: SPACE

Investigate the possibility of space with the companies
having the largest involvement in your freenet. They can be
approached with space requests for meetings and special events,
even for offices.

H: STAFF & VOLUNTEERS

Many larger companies support their employees voluntarism
and may be able to help you do internal recruiting. Phone
companies, banks, major retailers, and major industries are good
places to ask about this. A few companies have even assigned
staff to work with non profits on a part time basis.

I: MATCHING EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS

J: COMPANY MEMBERSHIPS IN "FRIENDS OF FREE-NET"


             SPECIAL ASPECTS OF FUNDING FREE-NETS

DON'T CREATE A SEPARATE CAMPAIGN FOR SUPPORTING BUSINESS SERVICES

Don't just raise money or assistance for the on-line business
center. Always get the business community to see that they are
supporting it and the other much needed community services that the
freenet provides.

SHARING THE EXCITEMENT
Freenets are an exciting concept. Most health care and
international aid organizations appeal to people's pity. We are
in the wonderful position of appealing to people's optimism. Make
sure that those representing you are visibly enthusiastic.
Enthusiasm is infectious. Choose well spoken and well informed
representatives. Make sure that they understand business
conventions and dress.

DIRECTLY SUPPORTING THE NEEDS OF THE BUSINESS

Every freenet will have a somewhat different policy on
business relations and commercial activities on the net. The more
you can demonstrate that your free-net meets the needs of the
business community, the easier it is to fundraise. I have written
a paper describing what I believe are the major advantages
businesses may get from the existence of freenets in their area.

Its written for business people who are not telecommunications
literate. If you would like a copy; contact me at:
     samsam@vm1.yorku.ca
     Sam Sternberg

Fell free to modify it in keeping with your policies and use it
as piece for distribution. Businesses, that understand the direct
benefits they will get from operating freenets, will have a much
higher propensity to support your efforts.

EVERY COMPANY HAS COMPUTER ENTHUSIASTS WORKING FOR THEM

Free-Nets are in an enviable position when it comes to
corporate funding. Every company of any size has a few computer
enthusiasts on staff. This means you should be able to find
support in every company you seek assistance from. While this is
easier said than done. It can be done. do it.

SENIOR COMPUTER PEOPLE ALWAYS KNOW THE TOP MANAGEMENT

And, the SECRET of successful fundraising is PERSONAL
CONTACT. Need we say more.


                          ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES
A: DO YOUR RESEARCH
     Most cities have extensive business directories.
     Most have companies ranked by size and activity.
     Public companies have annual reports that may be
          informative.
     Check your supporters for contacts in companies of interest.
     Interview your supporters in the company before making your
          formal approach. The more you know the better.
     Don't try to contact everyone. Target your efforts based on
          an analysis of your ability to reach the company you
          need to reach. Always assess each company on the
          number and degree of impact the motivating factors
          listed above will have on them. Think before you act.

B: MAKE CONTACT AT THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL
     In private companies contribution decisions are made at the
top. Your initial contact may be the computer department or the
advertising staff. Those people, once interested, can assist you
in reaching the decision maker(s).
     Consider recruiting an advisory board of company executives
to help you in your campaign. Also look at getting sponsored or
adopted by computer or communications related professional
associations.

C: KEEP GOOD RECORDS
     Make a record for each company you research and contact.
     list your contacts, dates, requests, and results.
     Save it so that the next group of volunteers can look back
to see what's been done. You may be asked to come back next year.
if you don't have records, you can't follow up.

D: BE PERSISTENT BUT NOT OBNOXIOUS
     An initial "no" can be the start of a very long and happy
relationship. Be prepared to ask again next year. As you grow you
will look better and better. You will also be able to show
increasing support from peer companies.

     NEVER DO THE FOLLOWING

          DON'T ACCUSE THE COMPANY OF SELFISH MOTIVES
     Our motive are selfish too. We are all benefiting,or hoping
to, in various ways from the Free-net. If you run into offers
that are too self serving - JUST SAY NO - you don't have to
explain. I personally hope all of us will avoid participating in
the kind of "promotion" mentioned earlier.

          DON'T ASK THEM TO SAVE THE PROJECT
     Always accentuate the positive. No responsible staff person
wants to hear that you're in DESPERATE for there support or worse
yet in financial trouble. That will just convince
her/him that they may be wasting resources on a program that is
about to die.

          DON'T THREATEN THE STAFF OR FIRM
     Never tell staff that your prepared to go over their heads
if they don't co-operate. Or threaten the company with negative
publicity. That kind of reaction is just infantile.

When fundraising, you will be asked if company "x" has
contributed. Be absolutely honest. If you asked but didn't get
anything say so. And mention that you hope to improve your level
of volunteers from the company and ask again next year. Never
disparage a potential donor. The person your talking to may just
know and like people in the firm under discussion.


E: BE REASONABLE
     Accept refusal graciously.
     If your analysis of a company's motivation to support you
show that you aren't a primary candidate for them; start small
and build their involvement. Perhaps starting by making a request
for an IN-KIND gift. Or assistance in recruiting employee
volunteers.

F: BE PREPARED
     Have a financial statement or business plan
     Have proof of your not for profit status
     Provide a list of Board of Directors and their background
     List all your current donors and supporting Institutions
     Produce an annual report or progress reports.

G: ACKNOWLEDGE EVERY CONTACT IN WRITING.
     Its important to thank every company you made a request to,
especially when they REFUSE YOUR REQUEST. Nothing does more to
improve your chances on a second request than someone remembering
the Free-Net as that very professional group which said thanks
for taking the time and we understand the demands on you funds
didn't permit a gift this time around.

H: FUNDRAISING WILL BE A PERMANENT ACTIVITY OF THE FREE-NET
     Do it right. Right from the start. Corporate funding can be
especially rewarding because companies often make gifts year
after year. No other source, except your members, can be so
reliable.
