        Sorry for the lateness of the newsletter this week, I've been back
and forth to San Francisco to see my niece through open heart surgery.
This peppy little three year old pulled through with no problems and
should be coming home this Friday or Saturday.  Amazing how quickly they
kick you out of the hospital these days!

        As the newsletter is late, and I'm a bit preoccupied with her,
I'm going to spare you all my weekly diatribe!  This week only!!!

COMMUNITY VIABILITY FUND -                      Contributed by Ed Schwartz

Community Viability Fund: Direct Grants to Nonprofits


      HUD has proposed the CommunityViability Fund (CVF), an
initiative of great importance to nonprofits and lower-income
communities since it provides, for the first time in many years,
a large federal program that would directly fund local
community-based organizations. CVF is loosely based on the
successful John Heinz Neighborhood Development Program which
currently receives only $5 million in funding.

      The proposal has changed dramatically since it was first
introduced by HUD. Center for Community Change (CCC), through its
work with the Coalition for Low-lncome Community Development
(CL-II~D), worked closely with HUD to improve their original
language to ensure that the program was targeted to lower income
communities.

      In addition, the definition of nonprofits was changed to
ensure that community-based groups would be given a preference in
receiving funds. In addition to working to improve HUD's
proposed legislation, a group of 23 national nonprofits
(including CCC) signed-on to a letter requesting that the House
Banking Committee include CVF in its Reauthorization Bill. The
House Subcommittee, through an amendment offered by Nydia
Velazquez (D-NY), included much of the revised language
authorising CVF. However, HUD's proposed 5100 million to fund
this initiative was reduced by the House to an authorization
level of no more than $40 million.

      The Senate is currently drafting its bill and CCC will
continue to work through the ad hoc CVF Coalition to ensure that
the legislative language they include is targeted to low income
communities and private, community-based nonprofits. The Senate
Banking Committee is expected to mark-up their bill on June 21.
Community groups should contact their Representatives on the
House and Senate Banking Committees and ask them to support this
legislation.

                  A Summary  of the Revised CVF Language

      The legislation would fund community-based organizations
and capacity-building organizations to carry out neighborhood
development activities, provide training, and build community
capacity to carry out the housing, economic development, youth
development, family support, community service programs (and
other eligible activities) needed to promote the viability of
low- and moderate-income communities.

      Eligible applicants for CVF funcls are defined as either a
community-based org,anization or a capacity-building
organization. A community-based organization is defined as: "a
private, nonprofit located in a low- or moderate-income
neighborhood or area; primarily responsible to the residents of
the neighborhood or area in which the organization operates, as
evidenced by the composition of its governing board; an
organization that conducts activities that help revitalize low-
and moderate-income neighborhoods or areas in a manner that
benefits persons of low and moderate income."

      A capacity-building organization is defined as "a private,
nonprofit (could be city-wide, regional, state-wide, or even
national) which has experience and demonstrated expertise
developing the capacity of nonprofit community-based
organizations." If no private nonprofit group is available to
provide such assistance, HUD may select other entities with
skills and experience to work with community-based groups.

      Seventy-five per cent of the funds would be awarded through
a HUD-administered national competition, while the remaining 25
percent would be awarded at HUD's discretion. For more
information contact Andrew Mott at Center for Community Change
(202/342-0567).

What are IGC Networks?

The Institute for Global Communications (IGC) provides computer
networking tools for international communications and information
exchange.

The IGC Networks -- PeaceNet, EcoNet, ConflictNet and LaborNet --
comprise the world's only computer communications system
dedicated solely to environmental preservation, peace, and human
rights.  New technologies are helping these worldwide communities
cooperate more effectively and efficiently.

IGC, located in San Francisco, California, is a division of the Tides
Foundation, a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization.

By subscribing to any one of the IGC Networks, you have full access to
the resources of any of the other IGC Networks.  To help you decide
which of the IGC Networks might best reflect your interests and needs,
here is a brief description of each:

EcoNet serves individuals and organizations working for environmental
preservation and sustainability. Important issues covered include:
global warming, energy policy, rainforest preservation, legislative
activities, water quality, toxics and environmental education.

PeaceNet serves peace and social justice advocates around the world in
such areas as human rights, disarmament, and international relations.  A
number of alternative news services provide a range of information about
these and other topics from around the world.

ConflictNet serves groups and individuals working for social justice and
conflict resolution.  ConflictNet's resources include guidelines for
choosing a neutral third party, sample case development in conflict
resolution, estensive biblographies, legislative updates, educational
materials and newsletters from around the world.

LaborNet serves groups, unions and labor advocates interested in
information sharing and collaboration with the intent of enhancing
the human rights and economic justice of workers. Issues
covered include workplace and community health and safety issues,
trade issues and international union solidarity and collaboration.


How People are Using the IGC Networks

Electronic Mail

Send and receive private messages -- including Fax and Telex -- to and
from more than 18,000 international peace, environmental and conflict
resolution users on our affiliated networks or to millions of users on
other networks.  Electronic mail is quick, inexpensive, reliable and
easy to use.

Conferences

IGC's conferencing services offer easy-to-use tools in group
communication and event coordination.  Geographically dispersed people
can communicate inexpensively on any subject.  Whether you are
administering an organization or distributing an urgent action alert,
IGC conferences are an indispensable tool.  Private conferences can be
set up to facilitate internal group decision-making, task-sharing
processes, or sensitive communications.  Public conferences are great
for information sharing, newsletter distribution, legislative alerts and
news services.

Information Resources

IGC's several hundred public conferences also include events calendars,
newsletters, legislative alerts, funding sources, press releases, action
updates, breaking stories, calls for support, as well as ongoing
discussions on issues of global importance.  IGC is also an access point
for the USENET system of interuniversity bulletin boards.  IGC's
capabilities allow you to search lists of speakers, U.S. Congress and
world leaders, media, grant-making foundations or bibliographies.


International Programs & The Association for Progressive Communications

IGC regards international cooperation and partnership as essential in
addressing peace and environmental problems.  IGC maintains a major
program to develop low-cost access to computer networking from outside
the United States, especially from non-industrialized and Southern
hemisphere countries.  The result of this program has been the
Association of Progressive Communications (APC) which now includes low-
cost computer networks in eight countries.  IGC has played a major role
in starting the Alternex (Brazil), Nicarao (Nicaragua) and GlasNet
(Russia) non-profit computer networks, as well as in providing technical
support to all of the partner networks.

Current projects include developing computer networks for peace,
environmental and international development organizations in Bolivia,
Costa Rica, Ecuador, Uruguay and Kenya.  The focus of the work is to
empower local, indigenous organizations by transferring expertise and
capacity in computer networking.  Operation and management of a local
APC node becomes the full responsibility of the local organization.  All
APC partners are independent organizations, and retain full control over
their network.

IGC collaborates with the United Nations Development Programme in work
in Latin America.  The International Programme is supported entirely by
grants from major Foundations and individual donors. Contributors
include:  The Ford Foundation, General Service Foundation and the John
D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.

 Subject: ANNOUNCEMENT: SCHOLASTIC LAUNCHES NEW INTERNET SERVICES

ANNOUNCEMENT SCHOLASTIC LAUNCHES INTERNET SERVER AND NEW K-12 SERVICES

The most trusted name in learning offers new resources to the Internet
community

New York, NY--June 12, 1994-- Scholastic Network today announced the launch
of Scholastic Internet Services,  Created to offer K-12 teachers and students
an easy-to-use, high-value destination on the coming 'Information
Superhighway, the Scholastic Internet Services are accessible to all Internet
users and include a K-12 net site running Gopher, WAIS and WWW..

The new Scholastic Internet services announced today are:  Scholastic
Internet Libraries, four electronic curriculum libraries with a myriad of
resources and over 5,000 full-text articles offered for site licenses; the
Scholastic Internet Center, a free Internet site offering information, lesson
plans, and electronic newsletters; and the Ultimate Education Store, a
searchable, on-line catalog of educational books, magazines, software,
curriculum kits, and more. "These Internet Services are an effective first
step in bringing Scholastic's information resources onto the Internet," said
Susan Mernit, Director of Network Development. "All the Scholastic Divisions
contributed to this effort.".

"As more schools connect to the Internet, Scholastic Internet Services
provide a simpler method for teachers and students to get access to libraries
of information on science, language arts, and technology," said Richard
Robinson, President, Chairman, and CEO of Scholastic. " When we launched
Scholastic Network with America Online last fall, our goal was to help K-12
teachers and their students work interactively with a variety of information.
With the introduction of our Internet services, all educators with Internet
access gain the ability to connect to Scholastic materials."

"From a national perspective, the emergence of electronic information
delivery presents new opportunities for all sectors of society," said Linda
Roberts, Secretary's Advisor on Technology, U.S. Department of Education.
"The Internet offers educators access to information that was previously
difficult to reach. With a growing number of teachers on the Internet, this
use of technology clearly allows teachers to better serve the needs of
students."

Using technology developed by Wide Area Information Services (WAIS),
Scholastic's technology partner in this effort,  parents and teachers can
easily search and retrieve what they are looking for in the Scholastic
libraries as well as the aisles of books, magazines, newsletters and other
educational products in the store, without leaving their home, school or
office. Consumers and educators can order information and materials directly
from the company using credit cards and purchase orders online.

The WAIS technology allows Scholastic Internet Services users to browse and
search without typing long commands.  For example, a student is able to ask
for information about "volcanoes" and immediately see a list of all the data
available relating to volcanoes.  This technology makes the Internet more
accessible to computer-users who often find the Internet difficult to
navigate.

One of the new services, the Scholastic Internet Libraries, is available to
state education networks, regional telephone companies, and regional internet
providers for site license for their account-holders. These content-rich
libraries offer curriculum resources in four areas--middle school science,
reading and language arts, integrating technology into the classroom, and
teaching with seasonal activities. Subscribers to the Scholastic Network on
America Online have full access to these Internet resources without
additional charge.

Education-related networks, gophers, MOSAIC sites, etc. are encouraged to
connect to the Scholastic Internet Center For more information on the
services, including the URL and Gopher addresses to link to, send email to
sninternet@aol.com. A special effort is being made to provide appropriate and
relevant resources and pages for students as well--stay turned!)

Scholastic Network is the first full-service online network designed
exclusively for teachers and students.  Scholastic Inc. (NMS:SCHL) ,
headquartered in New York, is among the leading publishers and distributors
of children's books, classroom and professional magazines, and other
educational materials. The Company also publishes educational computer
software and produces children and family-oriented video and television
programming. Scholastic operates in the United States, Canada, Australia, the
United Kingdom, and New Zealand.
