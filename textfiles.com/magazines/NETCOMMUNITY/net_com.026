  THE ONLINE "TIES THAT BIND" COMMUNITY NETWORKING CONFERENCE on COMMUNET


On May 23,1994, Patrick Finn <patfinn@UNM.EDU> asked,


         The question of "who WE are" is still an important one.  I would
like to suggest that WE find out who WE are before we go too far down the
path. A starting point might be people who are building communtiy
networks or thinking about building networks, that would include
independent projects and freenets and whatever else is out there  We all
need the same info and will be dealing with the same issues as we move
toward meeting our goals.

The question is "What is the common ground?"

I don't think WE need to be afraid of an experiment, let's try something
and see what emerges. Nothing ventured..

In the days since the conference, these & other folks have tried to answer
that question:

(all responses excerpted from Communet posts to "re: Ties etc")

********
Joan C. Durrance, Assoc. Prof, University of Michigan, School of Info.  &
Library Studies.

"The flavor of the conference began to unfold at the airport.  I shared a
limo to the hotel with a freenet organizer from Texas (who I found out
later was one of the  CPB award winners),  a Colorado  sysop  of a
marketing bulletin board,  the manager of a BBS for science teachers in
the state of New Mexico who seeks to develop a multicultural approach,
and an advocate of citizen democracy from a non-profit in Washington,
DC.   We bonded on the 15 minute trip to Cupertino.   Five people with
diverse backgrounds and experience who looked forward to sharing and
learning about community network ties over the next several days. "
********

From: Ken Loss-Cutler <kenlc@TENET.EDU>

" INTENSE!

The other highpoint, for me, was the ad hoc breakout session that evolved
in the cafe Friday afternoon.  Nancy Willard, from Eugene Oregon,
facilitated a discussion that lasted over two hours.  Steve C. had to
virtually beg us to adjourn for the final session in another room <grin>
(he finally resorted to wheeling in an iced-down keg/carrot-on-a-stick).
It worked.  But not before the group of 32 people (by my count) had
discussed essential elements of a plan for action for the community
networking movement.  We'll have to wait for Nancy's posting of the notes
she took on our discussions, but I felt like we made strong progress in
defining and, in some cases, taking on essential goals.  More important,
I believe we bonded in a way that we would not have without that session.
(Thanks, Nancy) "
********

"The work of creating equality lies in our hands, we already "have", let's
give it to those who don't.  Even down the road there will always be those
who don't have this tool.  So the job is to create the interface that will
reach those people.  We must use our imagination and creativity to build
the ties that bind, the link, to those who will never use a mouse, a
keyboard or a touch screen. "

Patrick J. Finn

********

From: "Kari Peterson (kapeterson@ucdavis.edu)

"awesomely complicated (this is a global phenomenon, it involves a
coalition of interests, sectors and needs that is larger than life and
too hard to bring under a single umbrella.)"
********

 "Community is what we are building in each
of our own ways, but isn't community really a collection of individual
relationships?  Community encompasses more than that.  It encompasses an
overall atmosphere as well, but what is the basis of community?  I think
the basis for community is strong personal relationships between members of
the community.  I can't think of anything else that could be the key
component of what we call "community."

SV-PAL -- grantbow@svpal.org             Silicon Valley Public Access Link
********

 "A community is a group of people united by the common
objects of their love." That incorporates three critical elements:
shared values, unity, and intimacy...

Ed Schwartz, Institute for the Study of Civic Values, Edcivic@delphic.com
********
********


Who are "we"?
What is the common ground?

        "WE" are librarians, teachers, doctors, programmers, students,
scientists, consultants, lawyers, firefighters, police officers, nurses;
actually, we represent just about every profession known.  "WE" are
idealistic, pragmatic, energetic folks with a strong sense of "global
community".   "WE" are probably the last remnants of a society that
"really" believes "all are created equal".  At the risk of sounding
melodramatic, maybe we are!  "WE" worry about connectivity for the
"have nots".  "WE" are the folks that are accused of being "Socialists"
when we post to the Comm-Priv list!

        The "Ties That Bind" conference was possibly the "Woodstock"
of the Community Computing movement.  We must re-harness the momentum
that was so prevalent at Cupertino.  We need to link our systems together
both by wire and organizationally.  There are many established groups
already in existence.  Could they be informally linked together (with
other interested parties) to form an International Community Computing
Alliance?  Or do we want to form a separate coalition of systems to
co-ordinate legislative action while the "window" is open as Mario Marino
so aptly stated?

        My feeling is that a *NEW* organization should be set up to take
advantage of the loose unification that was shared by the participants of
the Conference.  As we have seen "post" conference, many of those that
could not attend share our enthusiasm but feel a loss at having missed
such a "watershed" event.

        To become a viable, cohesive organization, we would have to
*focus* on as Patrick Finn put it, a "Common Ground".  We need to distill
this discussion down to three or four issues to accomplish a our goals.
After having audited this discussion since the conference, I have noticed
that the topics of cost, universal access to both the tools and the
Internet, political-social-economic effect on society, and on-going
lobbying are most often discussed.  Of course there are others, but
these offer a platform from which to start.

        In any case, something should be started soon.  This is an
election year.  We should be approaching Congress with a unified,
energetic, logical, attainable vision.  If we do not do it, a void will
be created allowing commercial interests to determine community for us.

        Think about this, discuss the heck out of it, but let's get
moving on something!  It's too important to let pass by.

DOES INFO HIGHWAY SHUN THE POOR?
        A study backed by groups including the Consumer Federation of
America and the NAACP charges that the advanced communications now being
planned and built are shunning poorer neighborhoods and minority
populations, in what amounts to "electronic redlining" -- designating
neighborhoods as bad for business. One industry spokesman, US West's Jerry
Brown, counters: "To say that we're going to stay out of areas permanently
is dishonest and ridiculous. But we had to start building our network
someplace. And it is being built in areas where there are customers we
believe will use and buy the service. This is a business." (New York Times
5/24/94 C5)


AMERICANS LIKE TECHNOLOGY
        Almost one of every three households has a personal computer, and
65% of computer users say they would miss their machine "a lot" if they no
longer had it. The study, which was done by Times Mirror Center for the
People & the Press, also found that people with computers spend less time
watching TV entertainment. (Atlanta Journal-Constitution 5/24/94 A1)

CAMPUSES WRESTLE WITH COMPUTER CRIME AND PUNISHMENT
        Campuses are increasingly dealing with computer-originated crime
and mischief -- everything from bomb and death threats, to racist and
sexual harassment, to forged messages such as one at Dartmouth that caused
students to believe an important exam was canceled. While some students
have called for a detailed list of computer commandments, campus officials
are wary of limiting their disciplinary discretion. "If you make a long
list of dos and don'ts, you are cajoling students into thinking, `How can I
squeeze through that?' You should be making them think, `Should I be doing
that?'" says a computer science professor at Kansas State. (Chronicle of
Higher Education 5/25/94 A19)

CYBERNOUGHTS ARE IN MINORITY
        Reporting on intense criticism on the net about a May 16th Newsweek
article that had "sweeping generalizations" about the differences between
the way men and women think and feel about computers, New York Magazine
columnist Jon Katz decides that "the larger truth is harassers, pedophiles,
and macho men constitute a fraction of the millions of ordinary people who
use the more than 33,000 computer bulletin boards for work, news, research,
shopping, business, marketing, and personal communications..." (New York
Magazine 5/30/94 p.16)

MFS OFFERS TRANSATLANTIC SERVICE
        MFS Communications will offer trans-Atlantic advanced
telecommunications services via its private fiber optic network and
asynchronous transfer mode switching equipment. The company is targeting
multinational banks and investment firms in the U.S. and the U.K. that need
high-speed voice, video and data communications capability. (Wall Street
Journal 5/25/94 B3)

INFO SUPERHIGHWAY WILL SPARK COMPETITION
        American Banker's Management Strategies (May 23) predicts a surge
in competition among banks, mutual funds companies, insurance companies and
other financial services firms, once the information superhighway becomes a
reality and customers can track investment activities on their TV (or PC)
screens. (Investor's Business Daily 5/25/94 A4)

BOOKS ARE FOREVER, SAYS AUTHOR
        Fiction Pulitzer Prize winner E. Annie Prouix says that the
information highway is "for bulletin boards on esoteric subjects, reference
works, lists and news -- timely, utilitarian information, efficiently
pulled through the wires. Nobody is going to sit down and read a novel on a
twitchy little screen.  Ever." (New York Times 5/26/94 A13)

Attached is the highlights of the press release we just issued. I think
that people on the NEWNIR mailing list will be particularly interested in
this service, given its bredth. Please feel free to tell others about it!

Internet Computer Index Centralizes Information about Computers

-- Free service gives easy access to widely-dispersed Internet resources --

Santa Cruz, California -- May 16, 1994 -- For the first time, Internet
users can find anything available on the Internet about computers in one
central location. The Internet Computer Index (ICI), created by Proper
Publishing, tells users them everything that is known on the Internet about
PCs, Macintoshes, and Unix systems. Additional information is also
available on ICI that isn't available anywhere else on the Internet.
Further, ICI is supported by commercial sponsors who add up-to-date
information about their products to the ICI service.

ICI uses the popular World Wide Web and Gopher systems to distribute its
information. Using attractive, informative menus and hypertext, ICI gives
up-to-date connections and pointers to the other freely-available
information on the Internet.  Anyone on the Internet, anywhere in the
world, can access ICI 24 hours a day at no charge.

Description of ICI

The Internet Computer Index (ICI) is an easy-to-use, free service that
leads Internet users to all of the information available on the Internet
relating to PCs, Macintoshes, and Unix computers. ICI is the Internet's
only one-stop, resource-locating service, helping users locate any
information related to computers that is available on the Internet more
easily and efficiently that ever before possible. ICI users can find out
answers to their hardware and software questions, solve networking
problems, research buying decisions, and keep up-to-date with their
systems. Using Gopher or World Wide Web client software, any user on the
Internet, anywhere in the world, can get the most up-to-date information
including pointers to all Usenet news groups, mailing lists, Gopher and
World Wide Web servers, anonymous FTP sites, and other Internet-specific
resources.

In order to make searching easy, ICI is organized as hierarchical menus of
information. For each type of computer system (PC, Macintosh, or Unix),
there is a menu that lists the type of Internet resources that describe
that system. Most people will be only interested in one of the three main
areas, but other can easily traverse between the three through cross-links.

Users can search through Internet resources including:
*       Usenet news groups
*       mailing lists
*       Gopher servers
*       World Wide Web servers
*       anonymous FTP sites
*       frequently asked question files (FAQs)
*       online publications
*       commonly-downloaded files

In addition, ICI freely provides information that is not available anywhere
else on the Internet. For example, the Macintosh and PC sections allow
users to search through indexes of reviews from popular magazines since
January 1993. Further, ICI also lets users search through the messages from
relevant Usenet news groups for topics of interest. In the future, Proper
Publishing will add more original content to ICI as a service to the
Internet community.

Accessing ICI

To reach ICI using a Gopher program, enter "ici.proper.com" as the host name.

To reach ICI using a World Wide Web program such as Mosaic, enter
"http://ici.proper.com" as the Universal Resource Locator (URL).

         World Conference of Jewish Communal Service
         Conseil Mondial des Services Communautaires Juifs
         Conferencia Mondial del Servicio Comunitario Judio
         ==================================================
         Jerusalem, Israel, July 4-7 1994

         Shalom,

         The World Conference of Jewish Communal Service will take
         place from Monday to Thursday, 4-7 July 1994, in the Ramada
         Renaissance Hotel in Jerusalem following the tradition of
         convening it in Israel every four years (W.C.J.C.S.).

         This conference gathers from all parts of the world
         professionals in the areas of education and community:
         educators from the Diaspora and non-formal education
         specialists, family counsellors, community workers, social
         workers, consultants in the area of public health, geriatric
         workers and more.

         The participation of representatives from the Jewish
         communities from East Europe and South America will be
         emphasized this year in addition to the usual presence
         of involved representatives and leadership of Communities
         from North America, Europe and Israel.

         During the Conference four days several activities like
         conferences, workshops and visits witll take place.

         The present period of changes in the Jewish community in
         particular and in the world gives a particular importance to
         the meeting of professionals from Israel and the world, for
         mutual listening and fertilization not only concerning the
         professional areas but as a mean of strenghtening relations
         within the Jewish Diaspora.

         Your participation at the Conference will contribute to the
         advancement of the Jewish professional community.

         Global Jewish Networking in the
         World Conference of the Jewish Communal Service
         ==============================================

         A session dedicated to the Global Jewish Information Network
         has been included in the program of the  Congress.

         Current projects being carried in the framework of the
         network and relevant to community work will be presented.

         We expect to be able to furnish all interested participants
         with direct experiences of the potential of networking for
         community integration and professional development. Pointers
         will be given to all Jewish information available and to
         professional forums relevant to the participants needs.
         Information and materials necessary for getting a connection
         back when returning home will be distributed.

         Prof. Armand Lauffer, head of the Projec STAR at the
         University of Michigan School of Social Work has already
         volunteered his help and his students assistance for
         participants willing to get connected to the network after the
         conference.

         The program for Global Jewish Networking at the Conference is
         being established by a committee leaded by Prof. Daniel
         Elazar, chairman of the Steering Committee of the Global
         Jewish Information Network Project.

         You are invited to participate and to call the attention of
         participants coming from your community to this session.
         We expect the Conference and the networking session to become
         a landmark in the evolution of Global Jewish Networking.
