FROM THE TOP!!!
################################################################

Another week gone by and done with!  Taxes are done and the good 'ol USA
has gotten its annual paycheck, courtesy of the fine folks of America.
I want to thank the many people that wrote to me after my first attempt
went out last week.  Your support and constructive criticism are both
helpful to me in forging the path that I will follow with this news-
letter.

It was suggested by Putnam Barber that there be more discussion
of the "philosophical, political, and practical issues that
arise" building communities on line.  Excellent point and one that
will be explored through this thread over many weeks. I DO enjoy
your comments and again encourage all to e-mail both + & - comments!

As this is a new direction for both myself and this column, it might
seem a little disjointed at first as I gain my wings.  Hey, it might
still seem disjointed after a few months!

I plan on profiling local nets as often as I receive bio's from you
folks out there.  I also will put out a list of interesting WWW sites
every once in a while.  Also, I believe that the Internet has the
opportunity, if that's the right word, of becoming the future of commerce
for cottage industries.  Already we see smaller businesses like bookstores
feeling out the Net for acceptance.  Some of us feel that the AUP's must
remain in place, do or die.  Others take the polar opposite and generate
about as many mentions in mailing lists and television shows, as did their
original "green" posts!

It is up to us as a "world community" to make these decisions through both
written and local in-person discussion.  Judging from posts to the various
mailing lists to which I subscribe, I feel that we are up to it.  It is
a major period of growth for the net and we are experiencing growing pains.

Well, enough of my verbosity, on with the show!!!

CONNECTICUT TESTS COMMUNICATIONS FUTURE New legislation in
Connecticut will open all types of telephone service to competition
beginning July 1, making the state a laboratory for innovation in
communications. Any enterprise could apply to offer residential or
commercial lines or wireless links. SNET (Southern New England
Telecommunications) will lose its monopoly on phone service but has plans
to completely rewire the state over the next decade with $4.5 billion of
fiber optic cable to allow comprehensive voice, video, and data services.

        Beepers not only communicate, they also control. Harvard economist
J.B.Schor says, "Now you may have to make yourself available on a 24-hour
basis to gain or keep employment, to be successful or get promoted.  It's
not acceptable to say: 'I won't wear a beeper because my time is my own.'"

SMALL CHANGE ON THE NET
        Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University are developing NetBill, a
computerized system for tracking and billing users for small transactions,
such as a ten-cent charge per document. The developers hope NetBill will
evolve into a universal accounting system on the Internet. (Chronicle of
Higher Education 4/20/93 A31)

NTIA WILL FUND INFORMATION HIGHWAY
        The head of the National Telecommunications and Information
Administration says its budget will go primarily toward jump-starting the
creation of an information highway. $100 million of a $134 budget request
will go to grant programs to "help state and local governments, schools,
libraries, and health care and public safety providers to undertake the
planning needed to ensure effective development of the telecommunications
infrastructure." (BNA Daily Report for Executives 4/15/94 A32)

ADS (AND FLAMES) ON THE NET
        After sending an unsolicited ad for his legal services to more than
9,000 Internet Usenet groups, a Phoenix lawyer got 30,000 replies,
including thousands of "flames" [outraged messages] from persons who
objected to his use of the Internet for unsolicited direct mail. Internet
Direct, the lawyer's service provider, rescinded the lawyer's account. The
lawyer's threatening a $250,000 lawsuit against Internet Direct and is
planning to write a book about advertising on the Internet. (New York Times
4/19/94 C1)

E-MAIL EAVESDROPPING
        One in five companies admits that it eavesdrops on its employees by
searching computer files, voice mail or e-mail, but a spate of lawsuits is
beginning to curb the habit. If a company plans on monitoring employees, it
should tell them in advance to avoid legal trouble later. (Investor's
Business Daily 4/19/94 A4)

E-MAIL BOTTLENECKS
        Overstuffed mailboxes and oversized files are two of the biggest
offenders in slowing e-mail to a snail-mail pace, according to Ferris
Networks, a San Francisco-based e-mail research firm. Although the problem
will be somewhat alleviated when ATM technology is fully implemented, the
proliferation of more and bigger files will continue. Ferris's president
anticipates an average post-compression message to be 100 kilobytes in size
by 1998, up from 10K currently, with volume rising to 60 messages a day, up
from 20-40 now. (Investor's Business Daily 4/18/94 A4)

NETWORK BENEFITS, NETWORK RISKS
        Increasingly sophisticated networks will eventually have the whole
country plugged into a single grid. Communications professor A.M.Noll at
the University of Southern California warns that with the benefits of such
a grid will come "a risk that some software glitch could transmit an
erroneous signal or traffic indication that would collapse the entire
network, bringing telecommunications to a total halt in this country."

             MANLEY ANNOUNCES ADVISORY COUNCIL MEMBERS
          AND ISSUES INFORMATION HIGHWAY DISCUSSION PAPER

          *(edited for space)*

OTTAWA, April 19, 1994 # "Together, as Canadians, we must decide how we
want to develop and use the information highway for the economic,
cultural and social advantage of all Canadians," said Industry Minister
John Manley. He made the comment today as he announced the membership
of the national information highway advisory council and issued a
discussion paper # The Canadian Information Highway: Building Canada's
Information and Communications Infrastructure.

"This document is intended to foster that dialogue between Canadians;
so is the advisory council," said the Minister. He added that these
discussions are essential to the implementation of a Canadian strategy
for the information highway.

On March 16, Minister Manley named McGill University Principal and
Vice-Chancellor David Johnston as Chair of the council. # It is
anticipated that the council might form five or six working groups to
address the specific issues. "Canadians can expect to have the
opportunity to work with council members on these matters," said the
Minister.

Subject: Ten Ways To Kill a Citizen's Movement

I found this in the old files at the Student Action Office at Reed, and
thought it worth passing along to various activists.
----------

Ten Ways To Kill A Citizen Movement
By Byron Kennard

        As a veteran community organizer, I know  alot about how to start
citizen movements, but only recently did it occur to me that I probably
know just as much about how to bump them off. All I have to do is count
my battle-scars and recall how I got most of them. If my experience is
any guide, far more people are driven out of citizen movements by their
own dear brothers and sistens in the cause than by all the shennanigans
of the enemy put together.

Friendly Fire on the Social Change Front

Here's how it works. Suppose you want to kill a citizen movement and you
come to me for expert advice. I would suggest first that you join it and
then procede to follow these ten basic, simple rules, any one of which
will drain the vitality out of a movement faster than you can say Ronald
Reagan.

1. Forget your origins
Citizen movements for social change nearly always originate in humble,
obscure, or disreputable circumstances. Think of the Wobbblies, the early
labor organizers, who were jailed, deported, or even massacred for their
opposition to industrial abuses. Think of Rosa Parks refusing to take a
seat in the back of the bus. Thgink of the bra-burners who endured
derision and scorn to help launch the feminist movement, or of the
housewives who chained themselves to trees rather than allow the trees to
be bulldozed. Later on, when the movement is off the ground and running,
these origins become embarrassing to the carreerists who have latched
onto it in search of gold and glory. At this point it becomes necessary
to rewrite history in order to drop the identity of the movement's
founders down the memory hole.
It is said that revolutions eat their fathers. Citizen movements do
something rather worse: they forget their mothers. The revolutionary who
gets beheaded is at least memorialized by history, but you can plow
through most history books without finding a clue to the identity of the
small bands of volunteer activists- usually women, in my experience- who
initiate needed social change.

2. Put experts in the driver's seat
Volunteers and generalists may have been good enough to organize the
movement, but they aren't good enough to run it. So when the money starts
to come in, it's time to kick the volunteers and generalists out and to
hire "qualified" persons, preferably someone with a Ph.D in physics,
economics, or an Ivy League law degree. (Please note: It is extremely
important that such persons be untainted by any direct experience in
community organizing. If you have a plethora of applicants, it may be
necessary to employ this test. Put each of the applicants into a paper
sack. Only those who cannot organize their way out of it will be eligible
for employment.)

3. Get serious about your work
I mean, real serious. Work too hard. Put in extremely long hours. Practice
looking grim and depressed. If possible, grow morbid. When you have
mastered all this, persist in calling your colleagues' attention to the
fact of your martyrdom. Broadly hint that if they were as serious as you,
they would emulate your example. If this doesn't make them feel
sufficiently bad, you might want to go a step further and physically maim
yourself. For example, you might shoot yourself in the foot. Screaming in
pain, you then demand that your colleagues drop whatever they are doing
and rush to aid and comfort you as you suffer from this needless and
self-inflicted wound.

4. Motivate others by applying guilt
If a group is working to save endangered species, attack it for its
insensitivity to the poor. If they are working to help the poor, attack
them for their insensitivity to endangered species. Whatever you do,
stick them in a no-win situation. Once they perceive that their work is
futile, they will, of course, redouble their efforts.

5. Adopt impossibly high and rigid standards of personal conduct, not
only for yourself, but for others, too.
Human frailty has no place in a citizen movement. Whenever it rears its
ugly head, you must be prepared to smash it to smithereens. Even slight
deviations from your standards must not escape punishment. If, for
example, you catch a nutrition activist eating a hot-dog in a fast-food
resaurant, condemn him on the spot for the Judas he is (neglecting, of
course, to mention that you popped in to buy a pack of cigarettes).

6.Talk a lot about the need to cooperate and to share, but for heaven's
sake, don't actually do it.
What you should actually do is attempt to dominate all proceedings
through the force of your intellect and personality. However, should you
encounter other persons who are foolish enough really to cooperate and
share, by all means, take them for everything they're worth.

7. Get yourself into a dither and stay there
Become over-excited. Remember, the end of the world is coming and we
haven't got much time. Thus, to demonstrate dedication, everybody should
run about like a chicken with its head cut off. If some people in the
movement are striving to work calmly and deliberately, making them
agitated and anxious should become your priority task.

8. Whatever you do, never share any credit.
Look, it's perfectly clear that the whole thing was your idea in the
first place. And nobody, living or dead, contributed anything to you. So
why should you share the credit? If, through some miscarriage of justice,
other people in the movement begin receiving credit, try to grab it from
them. Or try spreading the word that they don't really deserve it. If
these techniques don't work, fly into a sick rage and kick nearby objects
or people. (Please note: Regrettably, there's no guarantee that these
techniques will actually divert recognition away from others and toward
yourself. However, such techniques are almost certain to detract from
what pride an joy the recognition might give those receiving it. This is
a small pleasure to be sure, but by this time you will have learned not
to sneeze at small things.

9. Remember that intensity of commitment is best measured by the amount of
incivility you display.
Here again, little things mean a lot. For example, you should never be on
time to meetings. But when you do arrive, be sure to get interrupted by
telephone calls at least once every five minutes. The rest of the time
should be consumed by your talking as loudly as possible in accusatory
tones. The thrust of your comments should never vary. Again and again you
must make clear that both the truth and the democratic process will be
endangered unless you get your way. Throw a wild card into each agenda
and insist that old questions which have previously been resolved be
re-opened. Having made these comments, leave the meeting early without
helping to clean up the coffee cups or put the room in order. Now these
are fine points, I know, but if you are going to kill off a social
movement, you might as well do it in style.

10. Lastly, you must avoid doing any real work for the movement, while
creating the widespread impression that you are giving your all.
Scrupulous fulfillment of these ten rules will demand all your time and
energy, so none will be left to fulfill any duties to the movement. But
don't let this stop you from assuming as much responsibility as you can
get. Insist on being part of everything. If possible, try to be put in
charge. Then take care not to deliver on any of your commitments. Should
others have the gall to point out the discrepency between your
responsibility and your performance, observe inhushed and sorrowful tones
how painful and demoralizing this is to you, especially after all you've
done. Then nail them to the wall by asking the key question: Don't they
realize that we've all got to stick together?

have you used dedicated workstations, remote access server, etc.?
What software have you used - has anyone used Netware Connect for
example?   How have you handled Mandarin maintenance (since the
system must be shut down for some routines).  Is there any other
advice you could give us?  I am also going to talk to the vendor
about this, but I don't think that anything compares with actual

easier to just sign off and resubscribe but if there's another way,
I'd appreciate knowing about it.
