LOCAL resource creation & GLOBAL resource sharing.
The 9th report of 1994 is the 15th weekly survey.
-------------------------------------------------

coverage in this special issue included an extensive 4part list of
resources for those interested in community networking.

part 1: GENERAL CIVIC NETWORKING AND RELATED ISSUES
DISCUSSION AND ONGOING ASSISTANCE RESOURCES
part 2: DISCUSSION AND WORK LISTS FOR INDIVIDUAL CIVIC NETWORKS
or REGIONAL AND NATIONAL PUBLIC NETWORK EFFORTS
part 3: TOOLS FOR DEVELOPING COMMUNITY FACILITIES
part 4: CURRENT INFORMATION SOURCES
part 5: ORGANIZATIONS ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY NETWORKING
AND RELATED ISSUES

The regular issue will appear tomorrow. It has been delayed by my
deleting of all my files last friday. Some days it just doesn't pay...

---------------------------------

NETWORKS & COMMUNITY
version:   2.0
frequency: occasional
Date:      February 22, 1994
Compiler:  Sam Sternberg  samsam@vm1.yorku.ca
keywords:  community, freenet, free-net, privacy, funding,
legislation access, technology
audience:  network developers, community activists, free-net
organizers, fundraisers, social policy analysts.

I am including a list of major sources of information about
community access systems such as free-nets and issues which effect
them. It is a good guide to historical repositories of information,
ongoing debate and discussion, and useful tools for those
attempting to open or run a community computing facility.
To simplify the job of finding these resources I will point you
to a collection of resources rather than a source whenever that's
possible. I am grateful for the previous work in gathering a
resource lists by Sherri Steele and Stanton McCandlish
<mech@eff.org> at EFF and by Art "Rambo" McGee. I have made very
extensive use of their lists in compiling this one.

INSTITUTE FOR GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS (IGC)
The Institute for Global Communications (IGC) provides computer
networking tools for international communications and information
exchange. The IGC Networks -- PeaceNet, EcoNet, ConflictNet and
LaborNet -- comprise the world's only computer communications
system dedicated solely to environmental preservation, peace,
and human rights.  New technologies are helping these worldwide
communities cooperate more effectively and efficiently. IGC
maintains a major program to develop low-cost access
to computer networking from outside the United States, especially
in non-industrialized areas.  This program is the Association of
Progressive Communications (APC) which now includes low-cost
computer networks in several countries.

EFF-Austin was formed to protect constitutional guarantees of free
speech and freedom from unreasonable search and seizure for
users of computer networks. Experience has taught us that theseT

freedoms must be fought for if they are to survive in the online
world.  EFF-Austin was created as an experimental local chapter of
the national EFF but became independent in 1993 while retaining
contacts with the parent organization. We're heavily involved
in public speaking, education, and advocacy of constitutional
rights in cyberspace. "We're Austin's forum for discussion of all
