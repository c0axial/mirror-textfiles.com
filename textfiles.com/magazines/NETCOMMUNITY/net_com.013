LEGISLATION
===========

The CLIPPER CHIP CONTROVERSY
The Clinton Adminstration - bowing to pressure from the
Intelligence Community - has decided to go ahead with the clipper
chip proposal.

Those interested in opposing this plan can participate in the
following activities.  And hopefully, all of you are interested.
---------------------

CLIPPER PETITION
On January 24, many of the nation's leading experts in cryptography
and computer security wrote President Clinton and asked him to
withdraw the Clipper proposal.

The public response to the letter has been extremely favourable,
including coverage in the New York Times and numerous computer and
security trade magazines.

Many people have expressed interest in adding their names to the
letter.  In  response to these requests, CPSR is organizing an
Internet petition drive to oppose the Clipper proposal.  We will
deliver the signed petition to the White House, complete with the
names of all the people who oppose Clipper.

To sign on to the letter, send a message to:
Clipper.petition@cpsr.org
with the message "I oppose Clipper" (no quotes)

You will receive a return message confirming your vote.

Please distribute this announcement so that others may also express
their opposition to the Clipper proposal.
In only 48 hours, over 2,400 people have signed  on to tell the
President what they think of the Clipper proposal.

If you need more information on clipper ftp/wais/gopher to cpsr.org
/cpsr/privacy/crypto/clipper for a large selection of docs on the
proposal.
------------------------------------------
EFF [ the electronic frontier foundation ] offers something *you*
can do to support freedom and privacy. *Please take a
moment to send e-mail to U.S. Rep. Maria Cantwell
(cantwell@eff.org) to show your support of H.R. 3627, her bill to
liberalize export controls on encryption software.*

"I urge you to write to Rep. Cantwell today at cantwell@eff.org.
In the Subject header of your message, type "I support HR 3627."
In the body of your message, express your reasons for supporting
the bill. EFF will deliver printouts of all letters to Rep.
Cantwell. With a strong showing of support from the Net community,
Rep. Cantwell can tell her colleagues on Capitol Hill that
encryption is not only an industry concern, but also a grassroots
issue. *Again: remember to put "I support HR 3627" in your
Subject header.*

This is the first step in a larger campaign to counter the efforts
of those who would restrict our ability to speak freely and with
privacy.

The lack of widespread commercial encryption products means that
it will be very easy for the federal government to set its own
standard--the Clipper Chip standard. As you may know, the
government's Clipper Chip initiative is designed to set an
encryption standard where the government holds the keys to our
private conversations. Together with the Digital Telephony bill,
which is aimed at making our telephone and computer  networks
"wiretap-friendly," the Clipper Chip marks a dramatic new effort
on the part of the government to prevent us from being able to
engage in truly private conversations.

P.S. If you want additional information about the Cantwell bill,
send e-mail to cantwell-info@eff.org. To join EFF, write
membership@eff.org. For introductory info about EFF, send any
message to info@eff.org.

IN ADDITION - ONE CONGRESSIONAL OFFICE IS INTERESTED IN DIRECTLY
HEARING FROM THE PUBLIC.

" Leahy's office said he *wants* to hear from the
 public on the matter of holding hearings.  Any and all comments
 on the viability of the program, any concerns the public has,
 should be sent to Leahy immediately, a staffer said.  Leahy can
 be reached at:  Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC 20510;
Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the Technology and Law
Subcommittee said he would likely hold hearings "on the serious
issues raised" by Administration's announcement that it would
urge private sector to voluntarily adopt its Clipper Chip
technology.  "Basically, what this means is that the United
States Government will hold the two keys to unlock any private
communication coded with this program," Leahy said.  Citizens and
potential foreign customers aren't likely to see Clipper "as the
solution to privacy and security concerns," he said."

 his phone number is 202-224-3406.

The recently posted summary from the Electronic Public Information
Newsletter contained several items of interest to the free-net
movement. We need unrestricted access to government information and
the depository library program is a major force for providing that
access.  .......................

PUBLIC PRINTER ATTACKS NTIS FINAL RULE ON STEI: In a letter last
week (1/27) to the head of the National Technical Information
Services (NTIS), Public Printer Michael DiMario attacked NTIS's
final rule on agency transfer of scientific, technical, and
engineering information (STEI) to NTIS, while at the same time
inviting the agency to enter into an agreement with Government
Printing Office (GPO) to assure STEI is distributed to the nation's
depository libraries. DiMario told NTIS Director Don Johnson that
NTIS, in the final rule [Federal Register 1, Jan. 3, 1994, pp.
6-12], included new provisions related to the Depository Library
Program (DLP) without consulting GPO, which by statute is
responsible for the program. "We are dismayed that these new
provisions have been introduced as a final rule without
consultation or coordination with GPO," DiMario wrote. "....

SENATE PANEL TO HOLD HEARINGS ON GPO: The Senate Rules and
Administration Committee will hold hearings on Feb. 3 and 10 on the
Government Printing Office as referred to in H.R. 3400, the
National Performance Review, and Joint Committee on the
Organization of the Congress. A representative of the Office of
Budget and Management and Public Printer Michael DiMario are
scheduled to testify on Feb. 3. It is believed that Sally Katzen,
Director of the OMB Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs,
and possibly Deputy OMB Director Alice Rivlin will testify for OMB.
Other interested parties are being invited to testify on Feb. 10.

Operational Network Product / Services
January 27, 1994

It is the intention of CANARIE Inc. to release a Request for
Proposal (RFP) on February 1, 1994 relating to the following areas
of interest. It is expected that the RFP will close on Tuesday
February 22, 1994.  This is a notice pre-announcing the RFP only.

The CANARIE Inc. Operational Network Product / Services (ONPS)
Committee has identified as a funding priorities the development
of capabilities to facilitate the Access, Presentation, and
Exchange of Information on the operational network as follows:
Information Provider Capability - For the following information
categories, CANARIE Inc. will provide funding in support of
developing and implementing an information provider capability.

Note that CANARIE Inc. will not necessarily fund projects relating
to all of these categories and that CANARIE Inc.  will consider

Fax: (613) 722-1997
----------------------------------

CANARIE : In recent posting to com-priv, Canarie has been assaulted
for policies that it probably will be forced to change under the
new rules to be developed in Canada. Internally, Canarie member
NSTN (the provincial network in Nova Scotia) has opened offices in"
Ottawa, and is actively attracting members away from ONET, and"
competing with Hookup, UUNET Canada and the other providers
operating in that most lucrative of all Canadian markets. This is
in violation of the existing informal operating agreements against
cross competition.

In a recent posting - Vinton Cerf - the father of the Internet
wrote:

As noted above the electronic boundaries between commercial and non
commercial nets have almost disappeared in the U.S. It will happen
in Canada too.

DISCUSSIONS
===========
I have added the COM-PRIV listserv to my monitored group. With this
addition, I may have a weekly winner for my new FLAME WAR contest.
Participants in the best flame war of the year will be personally
rewarded with a CERTIFICATE from Networks & Community. A very high
standard has already been set by last year's award winners - the
inter listserv battle between cypherpunks and cypherwonks.


NPTN LISTSERV announced 7 new committees had joined. A complaint
was made about a commercial company seeking a grant along with a
public television station for the available community network
funding from PBS. [ if PBS can't tell the difference between a
private company and a community based effort - we are all in
trouble ]

Little else of vital interest appeared on the listservs.

NEW SERVICES

TRENDS
======

Serious concern over network related social issues is growing in
the US. In its 'Agenda for Action' document, the Administration has
set forth a positive vision of what the NII can be," said Dr.
Roberts.  "To achieve that vision, however, the government must
play a major role in the design, development, and regulation of the
network."

CPSR [ computer professionals for social responsibility ]
has recommended that the Administration adopt the following
policies:

o   Promote widespread economic benefits by evaluating the NII's
    economic success using measures that reflect its impact on the
    society as a whole, not merely the profits of NII investors and
    service providers.

o   Evaluate the social impact of the NII by conducting periodic
    reviews as the NII is implemented and used to guarantee that
    it continues to serve the public interest.

o   Guarantee equitable and universal access through an appropriate
    mix of legislation, regulation, taxation, and direct subsidies.

o   Promote the development of a vital civic sector by ensuring
    resources, training, and support for public spaces within the
    NII where citizens can pursue noncommercial activities.

o   Promote a diverse and competitive marketplace in terms of the
    content carried over the NII.

o   provide access to government services and information over the
    NII.

o   Encourage democratic participation by ensuring full public
    disclosure, and actively promoting democratic decision-making
    and public participation in all stages of the development
    process.

o   Actively facilitate the seamless connection of America's NII
    with the information infrastructures of other nations by
    working to resolve such issues as security, censorship,
  tariffs, and privacy.

o   Guarantee the functional integrity of the NII by establishing
    critical technical requirements including ease of use,
    widespread availability, full functionality, high reliability,
    adequate privacy protection, and evolutionary expansion.

The recommendations follow from a yearlong review of the NII
conducted by CPSR.  The process included collecting more than 1,200
suggestions for NII policy from network users across the country,
drafting a report, holding special chapter meetings on the NII in
Berkeley, Boston, Seattle, and Washington, D.C., and having a
multiple-draft review process by the membership.
CPSR is planning a conference next April in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, on the future of the NII, The Directions and
Implications of Advanced Computing.  The conference will
investigate at a more specific level how to achieve the principles
in the CPSR report.

CPSR's NII paper is available electronically by sending email to
listserv@cpsr.org.  In the message write the command
GET CPSR NII_POLICY or you can also FTP/WAIS/Gopher
cpsr.org:/cpsr/nii_policy.

BACKGROUND ON THE CLIPPER CHIP PROPOSAL AND ITS BENEFITS
--------------------------------------------------------
[ This is a serious matter, but I couldn't resist throwing some
irony into the subject- ed ]

This proposal is best understood in the context of the history of
the western intelligence community.

The ability to secretly intercept the communications of others has
been vital to covert action since the earliest days of
international telecommunications. When the first transatlantic
cable was laid between Britain and the U.S. in 1927; its operations
where monitored by secret agreement between both countries.
Britain would capture and analyze all calls coming from the U.S.
and the Americans would do the same with british traffic. Relevant
material would be sent back to each other. This allowed both
countries to honestly proclaim they were not spying on their own
citizens, while benefiting from the fact that someone else was.

By the end of the second world war; a war that the allies won
primarily because of strategic advantage gained from superior
telecommunication interception; the english speaking powers agreed
to create a multinational agency to capture all the information in
the world. Every newspaper, radio broadcast, t.v. transmission, and
international telegraph or phone call was to be captured and
recorded and stored for possible future analysis.

That agreement is still in place. The publications of the FBIS [
Foreign Broadcast Information Service ] are an example of the
publicly disclosed results of the joint monitoring program.

Today, Canada intercepts private communication in the U.S. and vice
versa. This is not illegal. Each country's laws forbid it from
invading the privacy of its own citizens. These same laws
intentionally provide no such protection for the communications of
other nations.

The Internet began as a service of the U.S. military. It is
impossible to believe that national security considerations were
not incorporated into its design. To this day the highest level
technical meetings on Internet design in the U.S. can only be
attended by individuals with security clearances.

The Internet is above all an international network. Messages travel
around the globe in fractions of a second. From an intelligence
perspective this amounts to providing an unwanted window on the
U.S. to the rest of the world. A disloyal government employee could
encode a document - and send it over the internet to anyone in the
world. An illegally distributed document, once securely encoded may
be captured, but unless it is crackable, the government would be
hard put to determine the nature of the damage done to its security
interests, because it could not determine what document it had in
its possession. The recent decision of the Department of Defence
to end Internet access for most of its employees is grounded in
these considerations.

Similar considerations arise for companies that depend on technical
secrets for their market advantage, or that wish to be certain that
their strategies can not be discovered by competitors.

Ordinary citizens also value privacy.

Of course - the internet isn't the only problem technology. Digital
cellular phones will soon be voice activated and may weigh less
than an ounce. The same disloyal government employee will then be
able to capture and encode a document. Then, with the aid of a
cellular modem, broadcast it to any point on the globe.
-------------------

A good situation for a national intelligence service is one in
which your own communications are untapable, while everyone else's
are easily accessed. The ideal situation exists when everyone
believes that their own systems are secure - when they are in fact
not secure.

The clipper chip proposal - if universally adopted -  would appear
to provide the U.S. government with a nearly ideal solution to a
crisis that has arisen in connection to the Internet.

The crisis arises from the fact that cheap secure encryption
software and now hardware has become globally available for the
first time; from Albania to Zaire everyone who owns a computer can
guarantee their own privacy. In essence - the cat is already out
of the bag and a desperate effort is underway to stuff it back in.

Accepting that a genuine problem exists. Is the Clipper chip
proposal a reasonable solution. If it is not a reasonable solution,
are their other - better approaches. Or, will one have to accept
the fact that the nature of the struggle for advantage through
technical espionage has changed.
-------------------------------

WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS AND WHO ARE THE LIKELY
BENEFICIARIES

The Clipper Chip proposal is an excellent solution if you are a
foreign company or nation interested in obtaining competitive
economic advantage over the United States. I expect that foreign
governments will begin lobbying immediately for adoption of the
proposal in the U.S. Here is why.

It will not prevent them from using effective encryption outside
of the U.S.

The United states represents only about 18% of the global market
place but it currently dominates in several hardware and software
categories.

These include supercomputers, network software and hardware,
desktop software, cpu chips, most categories of business software
for all classes of machines.

With adoption of these proposals - each of these categories will
become easier to gain market share in outside of the U.S.
Intel and Microsoft and Novell along with IBM, Thinking Machines
and Wais should all see significant declines in their market share.

Network Service providers like AT&T or Sprint should be easy to
defeat as they try to sell services in external markets.

If similar legislation is also passed in the area of cellular
communications, we can expect to see a dramatic decline in the
market share for Motorola products as well.

In the future as research on encryption techniques comes to a
standstill in the U.S. Foreign firms will be able to develop
optimized encryption standards that will meet the demands for the
emerging Multimedia market. Multimedia vendors seeking product
protection need efficient encryption standards to allow protection
of property rights. Encryption standards that slow down
transmission or minimize the effectiveness of compression
techniques will help guarantee the success of foreign firms.

SHOULD FOREIGN FIRMS REALLY SPEND MONEY ON LOBBYING.

Yes, despite the past history of success by the intelligence
community in crippling U.S. competitiveness in overseas markets in
areas like desktop computing and database software, and despite
that community's success in making U.S. companies the final
entrants in the Vietnames market and the China market; you can not
count on the continuing willingness of the American people to
accept these impediments.

In addition U.S. passage of this legislation may actual improve the
competitive advantage of a well prepared nation or corporate group.
U.S. history is replete with examples of trusted individuals who
have used intelligence information for private gain or sold it for
other reasons.

When men like former the multimillionaire Director of the CIA,
William Casey, had to be stopped from using intelligence
information for personal gain by Congress; there are probably few
serious limits the corruptablity of intelligence community staff.
And the clipper chip proposal is based upon trusting the keys to
chip's security system in the hands of low paid bureaucrats. Men
who may include among their ranks individuals like the Walker
Family who sold satellite intelligence secrets to the Russians for
peanuts.

The real danger here is that the U.S. might actually begin work on
improved encryption standards for incorporation in U.S. made
products. Such activity would create market advantage for American
companies.

ISN'T IT A DANGER TO OTHER COUNTRIES AND COMPANIES IF ENCRYPTION
THAT IS NOT BREAKABLE IS IN WIDE USE?

Not really. The Soviet Union and Israel managed to coexist with the
United States even though the U.S. was incapable of breaking their
codes. Both countries were themselves unable to break US coded
communications. Both countries successfully employed spies and
informants to obtain material and information that was otherwise
protected from decipherment. Both countries shared intelligence
information obtained from the U.S.  So this raises the possibility
that foreign firms or nations could unite in obtaining economic
advantage over the US.

Because plans must be turned into action - existing national
technical means are sufficient to guarantee the physical security
of the U.S.

AREN'T THERE OTHER REAL BENEFITS TO THE US FROM THE ADOPTION OF
SUCH SYSTEMS?

Well, if the U.S. government adopted the clipper chip standard for
all its internal communication. It would be able to gain some
control of untrustworthy employees who wished to use technical
means in subverting the US. People like Jonathan Pollard who simply
physically removed documents from their safe storage sites, would
of course be unaffected. Similarly the Walker family was exposed
only because of a family feud.

WHAT ABOUT ORGANIZED CRIME ETC.

The US government's inability to prevent the ongoing success of
organized crime despite the availability of wire taps and
informants is a testimony to the intelligence of these criminal
organizations. Implementation of the clipper chip proposals will
not result in any change in their successful strategies for

==============================================

ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS: this issue arrives a day late so that I
could include late breaking information on the Cipper chip issue.

A recent post to communet correctly noted that the editing of this
newsletter is poor. I would welcome any OFFER TO EDIT this
publication. I already spend 10 - 15 hours a week on it and just
can't spend any more.
