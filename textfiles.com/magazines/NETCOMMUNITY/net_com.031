Notes
###########################################################################

        Again it seems that I must apologize for the randomness of when I
get this newsletter published.  I have  been the busiest that I have ever
been within the last 5 weeks due to starting a new job performing
technical support for the US's leading internet provider.

        I have found that many of the callers to tech support are not only
new internauts but also new visitors to the world of computing.  There are
folks out there that get SO excited when you teach them even a little bit
about what can be done, seen, or obtained from the vast network of
computers loosely known as the Internet.

        A woman called the other day wanting to learn how to ftp a file
from a server in Tennessee.  All she had was the URL that she found in an
Internet book somewhere.  I took her step by step through the process and
you would have thought that she had won the lottery she was so excited
when she downloaded the document to her own computer.  She thought that
it was like magic!

        A few weeks ago a man called, said that he had  purchased a
computer, and had received a "subscription" to the Internet as a result of
this purchase.  He stated that he took this $5k system home, turned it
on, and all that was on the screen was a "C" prompt and didn't know where
to go from there.  Heck, for $5000, the machine should have TOLD him what
to do!  We got him into windows, set up his terminal program, and had him
surfing the net in no time.

        The point that I'm trying to make here is that we get hundreds of
calls like this monthly.  These are the new Internet users.  These folks
make newbies of ten years ago look like computer science majors!  Some of
these new users are going to end up posting to a mailing list or Usenet
news group that you participate in.  Be patient with them so that they
may learn by example.  By accepting that we all make mistakes when we're
learning and treating these newcomers kindly, I believe that the
Internet will surpass all of our expectations.  If we flame them, we lose
something from them and also in ourselves.

Subject: New Human Rights WWW

 I've got a new World Wide Web page up that focuses on human rights.  It's
less than half done, but I think it's ready to be used by more than a few
beta-testers who've so kindly checked it out and warned me about the big
bugs so far. (Waving at Dan).

The url to the home page for the site is:

   ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/ariel/www/human.rights/human.rights.html

It includes an introduction to the human rights concept (about 1/4
complete), a functioning Human Rights newswire, a soon-to-be-functioning
Alerts page, a bunch of UN documents in HTML format with hypertext
bookmarks to allow references to them, a couple of summary pages which
cover the most interesting points and refer to the documents, a
subjects index page (to be written), etc.

If you see typos or obvious errors you think I won't have seen, please
send me email and let me know about them.

I am also looking for a couple of things from different people:

  * If you represent a human rights organization and want to be mentioned
    on the organizations page, please contact me.  While I will not
    post information on a purely political group of any type, regional
    or small-scale groups are welcome.

  * If you are part of an Amnesty International group or other group
    with an adopted prisoner of conscience whose case you would like
    to have featured on the Biographies Page, please contact me.

  * If you know of some good Human Rights resources on Internet which
    are not mentioned on the "Other Internet HR Resources" page, please
    send me email with the url.

  * If you are a source of news articles or press releases on human
    rights issues, please contact me.

  * If you would like to help with writing up part of the site which
    you notice is not finished yet, please check the Site Admin page
    (accessible from the bottom of each page) for more information.
    I would especially like to get some written thoughts for the
    "Human Rights Issues" page from people with a variety of backgrounds
    and opinions.

  * If you have an idea about a resource which you don't see and think
    would be useful to people, please contact me.  I'll respond even
    more quickly if you are willing to help implement it. :>

I did this site because I saw a need for it.  (Translation: I kept looking
for one and asking myself why "someone" hadn't done it.) ;>  While I am
a member of Amnesty International (and have unofficially told quite a few
Amnesty people about this site), it is not an Amnesty International site
but a private effort.  Other human rights groups will be featured, and are
welcome to participate fully.  I want to make this site as useful as
possible to as wide a group as possible.

And, of course, I'm responsible for all errors.  Thank you for your time
and help.

 Subject: 38% of Top 2,000 Companies Have Internet Presence

In a May 1994 study, InterNet Info found that 46% of the largest
publicly traded companies had some form of Internet presence.
Internet presence was defined as having either a domain, network or
host computer registered with InterNIC.  The study included 490
publicly traded companies with sales in excess of $1.5 billion.

We recently expanded the study and found that 38% of all publicly
traded companies with sales in excess of $400 million have some
form of Internet presence.  This study included 2,064 companies.

        Netcom Online Communications recently released thier proprietary
(works through accessing an account with Netcom) Windows(tm) program for
accessing the Internet.  NetCruiser(tm) uses CSLIP OR COMPRESSED SERIAL
LINE INTERNET PROTOCOL to connect your PC to the Internet.  Your system is
assigned an IP address dynamically by Netcom's host computers each time
you connect.  Once connected, your system can communicate directly with any
other host computer on the Internet.  NetCruiser will be continously
enhanced to take advantage of new protocols and resources available on the
Net.  NetCruiser will update itself while you're online as these
enhancements are added.

Subject: Announcement: "COMt: the Telnet Modem"


        This message is to announce the release of COMt version 1.0.
"COMt: the Telnet Modem" is a WinSock 1.1-compliant communications
driver which allows you to assign unused COM ports to act as "Telnet
Modems".  Each Telnet Modem acts as a Hayes-compatible modem, so
it provides the behavior expected by most comm programs.  All you
need to do is tell your favorite Windows terminal program to connect
to one of these telnet ports, then give the IP address for a phone
number.  When you "dial", you will be connected to the host via a
TELNET connection.

        Features include:

        - Complete Hayes(tm)-compatible modem emulation
        - Connect using IP addresses or hostnames
        - Connect to TELNET or another port number you specify
        - Selectable TELNET binary mode on or off.
        - Selectable TELNET terminal-type option supported
        - Selectable TELNET baud-rate option supported.
        - Selectable TELNET echo-mode option supported.
        - Requests for serial ports are passed on to your original
          comm driver for completely transparent operation.

        The program is shareware, with a registration fee of US
$15.95, payable by VISA/Mastercard, check, or in the SWREG forum
of CompuServe.  You can obtain a copy of COMt from the following
places:

        - On CompuServe in the IBMCOM forum as "comt.zip"
        - Via anonymous-ftp to ftp.std.com, as the file:
          /customers/software/rfdmail/comt.zip

ANNOUNCEMENT:  NetMinder for Windows 1.2

Info Match Communications Inc., Canada's leading manufacturer of Internet
consumer software is pleased to announce the release of version 1.2 of the
NetMinder Internet Address Database for MS Windows. NetMinder is the only
Internet address program for Windows that works with your terminal
program to make the Internet easy. Previous versions of NetMinder are
used by organizations such as Atomic Energy Canada Limited and the
Nova Scotia Technology Network.

To view screen shots and obtain more information use Mosaic to see the
NetMinder title page at:

http://infomatch.com:70/0h/docs/softworld/netminder

or email for information to netmind@infomatch.com

NetMinder is a Microsoft Windows program that allows the easy use,
storage and manipulation of hard to remember Internet or other network
addresses. NetMinder lets you enter these addresses into its database either
by manually entering them, or by using the Windows cut and paste functions
to "cut" them from your Windows compatible terminal screen and "pasting"
them right into the NetMinder entry screen.

One way to think of what NetMinder does is to view it as an electronic address
book. You could use it to record E-Mail addresses and then use it's
search capabilities to find a specific name. Or perhaps for example, you
might want to list everyone who has the domain .edu in their address.
NetMinder stores more than just E-Mail addresses, it is specifically
configured for Telnet, FTP, WAIS or any other conceivable network category.

While the "Address Book" analogy for NetMinder is in some respects true,
NetMinder is far from being just another address book program. NetMinder
is a powerful database program that can create an unlimited number of
different databases, each containing many thousands of entries. NetMinder
not only has the capability to record network information for each entry,
but external information such as postal addresses and memos as well.
NetMinder stores its information in a standardized DBASE IV file format. This
makes it easy to take the information you have stored in NetMinder and use
it in another program (such as Microsoft Access or Borland Paradox). Using
this capability you could for example use Access to print postal mailing
labels for the entries in your NetMinder database.

NetMinder is completely compatible with your Windows network and other
software such as Chameleon. Multiple instances of  NetMinder can be run,
and databases can be exchanged amongst them or with any other users of
NetMinder.
