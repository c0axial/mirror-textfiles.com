*PART 1*

Greetings!

        Recently, in print media columns written by well known writers,
the topic of the Internet has been discussed, specifically the issue
of "flaming".  Most of us have had contact with the phenomena, whether
directed at us as an individual or as lurker's in a news group or mailing
list.  Quite a few of these attacks are vicious.  Once in a while though,
the flame takes the form of a flashlight beacon, guiding the *offender*
of the net toward a better life in the Internet Community.

        An article sent this past week to the  owner of the Internet
Company received a very warm reception from the recipient and many others.
The article had to do with an individual sending a commercial message
regarding memory training via e-mail.  Rob was not too happy with it and
forwarded it to the list along with his pointed reply.  The whole thing
escalated as usual, with invoices flying back and forth!  The original
sender was from a commercial online service and, (giving him the benefit
of the doubt) stated that an Internet book had said to place symbols in
the header to signify a commercial message.

        Rather than light this fellow up any further, the gentleman whose
article I have included, used that "flashlight" concept to guide the
offender (hopefully) toward the right path.  This article impressed me as
an excellent example of "community" behaviour.

To: (Dave Crocker),
    (MR RICHARD B RUBIN JR)
     From: rothman@clark.net (David H. Rothman)
     Subject: Re: A copy of my response to Mr. Raisch
     Cc: com-priv@psi.com

      In case Richard Rubin is still curious about Rob Raisch's record as a
businessman, he might visit a 'Net-literate friend and gopher into The
Electronic Newsstand--one of the services that Rob helped create. There
Richard will find hundreds and hundreds, in fact probably *thousands*, of
magazine articles that anyone can dial up for free. Many are from famous
magazines such as the New Republic and the Atlantic.  Rob isn't publishing
material online as a charity; instead he's paving the way for the time when
ad- and subscription-supported publications will be on the 'Net in a big
way. But in acting as he has, Rob has provided a valuable service to the
rest of us. No one forced me to spend time today reading the articles in
Rob's section of the 'Net; I did it because I wanted--in fact, because I saw
useful material relating to my work. If I'd seen ads there, I would have
been more receptive to the advertisers because they were supporting a useful
service. Unsolicited hard-sell in my mailbox will have the opposite effect.

As I've written Richard, he would do well to start a mailing list on a topic
related to his services as Mr. Memory or whatever he calls himself. That
way, like Rob Raisch, he would be simultaneously helping himself and the
'Net. Mr. Memory's customers could swap memory tips and, meanwhile, snap up
whatever publications and tape Richard pushed. Richard could even promote
his 'Net list in his paper mailings and ads in paper magazines, saying he
would employ high-tech to stay in touch with customers. He could use the
'Net, as well, to offer individual advice, charging by the hour. At some
point he might even start a newsgroup that focused on memory tips and
potentially reached thousands of people. *That's* how entrepreneurs like
Richard can simultaneously do well and good. If, on the other hand, ads are
all over the Internet, helter-skelter, without targeting, or if people are
distracted by ad-stuffed mailboxes, the 'Net will be suffer as an
advertising medium for small and big business alike.

You don't have to be a millonaire to start a mailing list, Richard;
cash-strapped activist groups do it all the time. Are you ready to play by
the rules?

David Rothman
rothman@clark.net

P.S. Yes, this will come across as an ad for Rob Raisch, but I haven't
received a penny from him. It's just one example of the goodwill awaiting
business people who use the 'Net responsibly.

***

        Rothman explained to the man, firmly, that this "community" has a
way of doing things and provided us all with an example of how we should
react to "educating" the millions of new Internet explorers.

        If we as Community Networkers act as flashlight beacons as we go
about evangelizing the uses of electronic messaging and communication, we
will become the international information infrastructure, continuing the
growth and expansion of the Internet on a human level, while the
politicians attempt to transform into something else.  If we can do that,
the "clueless" will become the "Net Good Citizens" of the future.

************************************************************************

NEW USES FOR HIGH-TECH TRAINING
        The Clinton administration plans to use expensive computer
simulators developed for the Pentagon to train tomorrow's workers in
subjects ranging from physics to manufacturing. (Business Week 6/6/94 p.44)

SNAIL MAIL AN ENDANGERED SPECIES?
        Canada's postal corporation is making preparations to join the
info-highway.  Its chair predicts that stamped mail likely will become
extinct as electronic information replaces regular mail, delivering
services by TV, telephone and computer. (Toronto Globe & Mail 6/03/94  B3)

HIGH-TECH ADVERTISING
        Advertising agencies are pouring large amounts of cash into
information technology, for such things as in-house ad creation and
computer-based media planning. (Investor's Business Daily 6/3/94 A3)

POLITICAL DISSENT ON GOPHER
        The Digital Freedom Net has a number of documents written by
Chinese political dissidents, and can be found at gopher.iia.org. (New York
Times 6/5/94 Sec.4 p.18).

E-MAIL AT THE WHITE HOUSE
        Both the Bush and Clinton administrations have tried to restrict
public access to White House e-mail, but later this year the National
Security Agency will publish "White House E-Mail," a book-length collection
of e-mail messages.  The book includes Iran-Contra affair communications to
and from Oliver North, who used e-mail because he thought it could be
easily deleted. One message from him reads: "Oh lord. I lost the slip and
broke one of the high heels. Forgive please. Will return the wig on
Monday."  (So who needs the Clipper Chip?) (New York Magazine, 6/6/94 p.20)


PIONEERS PREFERENCE WINNERS PROTESTED
        The winners of four licenses to offer wireless personal
communications services under the FCC's Pioneers Preference program are
under attack from rivals. Among other complaints is the fact that FCC
officials did not visit the companies' test sites to verify trial results,
although such visits are not mandated. The uproar is causing the FCC to
consider scrapping the program, which bestows free licenses in exchange for
developing cutting-edge technology. (Wall Street Journal 6/6/94 B2)

MCI COLLECTS ON 1-800-COLLECT
        After MCI decided not to mention its name in connection with its
service, researchers found 50% of those using MCI's 1-800-COLLECT number
assumed it was run by AT&T. When AT&T attempted to retaliate with its own
1-800-OPERATOR number, it found that many callers dialed 1-800-OPERATER
instead, which is an MCI-toll-free number. (Business Week 6/13/94 p.78)

GETTING ORGANIZED
        The next generation of pocket organizers by Voice Powered
Technology will include an expense-account system that understands verbal
memos like, "Taxi, $9; lunch with Joe, $38.50," and will organize them by
category. (Wall Street Journal 6/6/94 B1)

LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD
        Information technology has changed the way businesses compete, and
equal access to market data and business opportunities gives small
companies a leg up in capitalizing on rapidly changing market conditions.
In addition, cheap computer-aided design and manufacturing software allows
small companies to crank out multiple prototypes without having to invest
in large product development labs. (Business Week/The Information
Revolution 1994, p.108)

VIRTUAL TOURING
        Apple Computer unveiled new technology based on virtual reality
that enables users to take realistic "tours" of buildings and places.
QuickTime VR fits on a compact disk and requires a companion program called
QuickTime 2.0, which will be available this summer. (Wall Street Journal
6/8/94 B6)

CYBERCOP
        A former New Jersey police officer now spends his time cruising for
suspects in cyberspace and has been involved in dozens of criminal
investigations, including a sting operation that nabbed a pedophile who
lured young rape victims via a bulletin board service.  (Tampa Tribune
6/8/94 BayLife 5)

POPULATION BOOM IN CYBERSPACE
        By the end of this year, nearly four million U.S. households will
have signed on with one of the Big Three online services -- American
Online, CompuServe or Prodigy. (Investor's Business Daily 6/9/94 A4)

E-MAIL PRIVACY
        A survey of 301 companies by Macworld Magazine showed that 78.4% of
the firms do not spy on employee e-mail or search their electronic files.
Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) has drafted legislation requiring that companies
tell their workers that their e-mail might be monitored. (Tampa Tribune
6/8/94 BayLife 5)

ONLINE IN ITALY
        Olivetti will establish a joint online service company, Italia
On-line, similar to America Online and will use an interface based on
Microsoft Windows. (Investor's Business Daily 6/8/94 A9)

Community Networking- An Overview   by Nancy Willard, ESD
##########################################################################

From: Nancy Willard ESD <WILLARD@EDLANE.LANE.EDU>

Subject:      Description of community networks

I was asked to provide a brief description of community networks and thought
that my description might be helpful for others so it is being posted here.

Community Networks Overview

Community networks utilize advanced computer and telecommunications
technologies, the "information highway", for local public interest
information sharing and communication.  Community networks will provide
all people with the ability to independently access a wide range of
information, gain a greater understanding of the issues facing society,
communicate more fully with other people and with the institutions that
serve them, and participate more fully in the democratic process.

Community networks are not just "on-ramps to the information highway";
they are the local "commons".   They provide an electronic location for
community access to the vast amount of public interest information
available within the community through various agencies, organizations,
and individuals, as well as the opportunity to discuss community affairs
online.  Community networks are also not just a service that is provided
"for" a community, they are a service created "by" a community

Community networks hold the promise of improving the quality of life for
all Americans.  Community networks will help to insure that we do not
become a society of information "haves" and "have-nots".  Those who are
in danger of becoming the information "have-nots" include those who are
poor, uneducated, live in rural communities or depressed urban areas, or
are fearful of technology and change.  Community networks will provide
access to those without computers through public access terminals and
also provide training and support to their users.

Community networking is a grassroots movement fueled by visionary people
in communities throughout the U.S. and the world.  Many of these local
programs are being developed through partnerships of libraries, education
institutions, public broadcasting, cable access television, local
governments, social service and health organizations, and community
members.  Most of these programs are seeking to establish both local
information and communication services and public access to the Internet,
however, it is recognized that the most important role community networks
will play in the future is in providing local information and opportunity for
local dialogue, not the technical means of access.

Community networks are established as non-profit, 501(c)(3) corporations
and seek funding through a variety of sources, including user
contributions, fees, corporate sponsorships, government, foundation
grants and in-kind support from community collaborators.

Subject: WIT - W3 Interactive Talk

As brainstormed at WWW'94, I've now written a set of CGI scripts that make
it possible to have interactive discussions in the Web.  It's called WIT,
W3 Interactive Talk.  The pre-alpha version of the prototype (got it? :-))
is running on info.cern.ch:

        http://info.cern.ch/wit

Read more about it in the WIT; and USE THE WIT to discuss it, don't
flood my mailbox with feature requests. :-)

Bare in mind that this was put together in a big hurry in a few days
so forgive me if it doesn't do yet all the things that it could do.

Have fun WIT'ting around!

National Capital FreeNet,Ottawa, hosted the first international conference
on community networking, Carleton University, August 17 to 19, 1993.  That
conference brought people interested in community networking face-to-face
for the first time. This second conference builds on the previous
experience, but more closely focuses on the purposes, potentials, and needs
for developing community networks within Canada.

The 1993 conference participants recommended the establishment of a
national organization; to  support the growth of electronic community
networks in Canada, and to share the experience of bringing communities
on-line.  They wanted the new organization to be true to the spirit of the
Internet as a sociological experiment, and to mirror the grassroots spirit
of the freenets it supports.  Following from their recommendations,
articles of incorporation for an association of community network
associations, called "Telecommunities Canada," are proceeding to
registration.

Organizing freenets as a means of community development has become a social
movement in Canada.  The members of that movement are characterized by high
levels of energy and commitment to civic responsibility.  If you want to
find out what Canadians who have the choice actually do on the Information
Highway, come to this conference and join in the discussions:


                WHO SHOULD ATTEND?...ARE YOU:

   * Active or interested in organizing freenets?
   * Operating  a freenet or other electronic community network?
   * Interested in the social, economic, physical, and philosophical
               impacts of community networking?
   * Already a computer network user or planning to be?
   * Involved in community, government or public interest groups
              that want access to computer mediated communications and
              networks?
   * A content provider or service agent?
   * A private industry executive or professional from the
              Information Sector with an interest in broadening the base
              of information technology use?
