From the Editor
by Scott Hollifield


    Well, well, well, time for this stuff again already?
    Yep, past time in fact - BTN is late this month, partially due to a
certain cycle of cosmic events beyond my portent or control, but also
partially because I simply put off writing my editor's column until I
just couldn't stand it anymore.  That's right, whoever it is out there
with the voodoo doll, you can stop now.  Why is it so difficult for me
to just sit down and crank this kind of thing out?  I'm a champion
procrastinator, true, as anyone who knows me even remotely will confirm
(including the lady at the breakfast place every morning who stands
tapping her foot while I fret over which precise combination of pocket
change to give up).  And yet, there's something else, something that's
been sitting at the back of my brain, scratching and making little
obnoxious comments, like Robin Williams as a cartoon bee.
    I think that this comes from certain vague guilt pangs I've been
having concerning the end result of my efforts.  Very slight, very
vague, very marginal, but there nonetheless.  I'm not talking about the
task of filling Mark Maisel's shoes -- I got over THAT one the minute I
volunteered for this job.  And people have been kind; I was particularly
pleased to see a lengthy positive review a few months back from Damion
Furi, a relatively new local user of some opinionated note.  (Of course,
we're all now onto the real truth, that this was just buttering on
Damion's part to smooth the path to becoming a regular BTN writer, but
the joke's on him -- it's ridiculously easy to be a regular BTN writer,
and I wish more people knew it -- but I'm glad he bothered anyway.)
    Still, take a steady gander at our tables of contents from the last
few issues and you'll see a marked similarity.  Not that I mind having
guys like Damion Furi and Lurch Henson contribute regularly (in the
sense that I wouldn't mind having ANYone contribute *regularly*), but
I'd hate for BTN to devolve into five guys with five monthly articles
entitled "My Opinions About Certain Things", "#1" through "5".
    And I know that more than once now, I've tried to make things seem a
little more exciting by hinting of things to come, which haven't quite
arrived yet (such as last month's hint of "a few [new] ideas" which were
supposed to be in this issue).  Truthfully, I DO have new ideas for BTN.
It's just that I haven't yet found the time or energy to implement them.
Rest assured, they are coming.  Let's talk a little about what's in
store for the BTN of the near future.
    Beginning next month, I'm going to drop my personal responsibilities
concerning the much-loved "Known BBS Numbers List", and hand them over
to a comrade.  James Minton, current sysop of Outer Limits BBS and one
of the longest-running, currently-serving sysops in Birmingham, has
volunteered to take up this awesome duty (and unless you've ever called
eighty bulletin boards in one evening, you don't know the meaning of the
words "awesome duty").  I know that other people have volunteered for
this task before, even back when I first became editor of BTN, and I do
appreciate the thoughts of all who did.  I'm not intentionally slighting
anyone -- it's just that James happened to ask at precisely the right
time, i.e. the time when I was actually beginning to seriously give the
List to someone else.  I hope he realizes what he's getting into with
it.
    Also, something special is coming up soon: the fifth anniversary of
BTN.  That's right, it's been five years since that very special first
issue of BTN, back in May 1988.  We've been places, friends; we pre-date
the election of George Bush, both Batman movies, and most of the Farm-
Aids.  So you can imagine that we must have a special issue to mark this
special occasion, and that we must have a special number of special
articles from our special friends.  There are indeed plans in the works
to make the May 1993 issue of BTN extra-special, but if you've got any
ideas, drop me a line.
    Not only that, but I've gotten semi-solid article commitments from
several people whose names are NOT Lurch Henson, Damion Furi, or Judy
Ranelli.  We love the members of our family, of course, but we'd like
our family to grow!  Isn't that a lovely metaphor?  Ah, springtime
draweth nigh.
    Well, I've beaten out my last column by 20 lines or so, and that's
good enough for me.  Let me remind you that if you're interested in
submitting something for BTN, it's VERY easy -- just upload it as a
private file to either the Crunchy Frog or the Matrix, and tell the
sysop it's for me.  Until next month, be kind to your fellow oxygen-
breathers, and please use your turn signal when changing lanes.

Letters to the Editor

From: David Moss

    I've been meaning to take the time to write to BTN and comment about
some of the conferences around town. My favorite, this last couple of
months, has to be EZNet.
    In EZNet, you can find any topic of conversation you might want,
anything from recipes to politics.  The first of these, I won't touch
with a ten foot pole. <grin>  It is the second issue that I do wish to
comment on.  Primarily, "Gays In The Military".
    It seems to me, that with all the REAL issues facing this country,
that the press could find a more urgent one to "sensationalize".  But,
since this topic appears to be the "hot potato", I'll take a shot at it
too.
    There will come a time in this country, when "the draft" will have
to be reinstated.  With this in mind, how can we afford to have a
system, by which, if a young man did not want to go, all he has to do is
say, "Uh, gee Sarge, I'd like to, but I'm gay".  I have a feeling that
that line will be the longest at the recruitment center.
    For those who doubt a draft, remember this:  man will always be at
war with man.  So it is inevitable that a war will flare up somewhere,
a war that will require the young men and women of this nation to be
called upon to defend it.
    I have heard all the hysteria about why homosexuals should not be
allowed in the military, but I have not heard any REASONS, only
excuses.  There is no reason why a homosexual cannot serve a
distinguished career in the military, if allowed to do so.  If we as a
nation attempt to take away fundamental rights, and I'm talking about
"....and bear arms", then why not take away some more, like "taxes"?
    Considering the state of this nation, I feel there are a few more
urgent issues that affect all of us.  This issue will have very little
effect on any of us.  I am waaaaay past the age of serving, so it does
not affect me, but I still find myself voicing opinions on it.
    Whichever side of the issue you take, then by all means, write your
congressman and let him know.  While you are writing him, ask what he
plans to do about, unemployment, taxes, welfare, prison systems, social
security, health coverage, drugs, children with guns, adults with guns,
crime, stock brokers that bilk millions from us and walk away clean,
Somalia, Cuba, Haiti, Bosnia, Iraq, and TV stations that mislead the
public about BBS's.  (I had to do that)
    There are many many more issues that face us (all of us) that, to
me, should be acted on and publicized more so than this issue.  This
issue has made front page headlines across the nation.  I ask you, is
this a ploy to take our minds off the real state of this nation?
    I can be e-mailed at WEEKENDS, or any EZNet conference, and I should
get it eventually.
    Congratulations to BTN for it's upcoming fifth anniversary.

[Editor's Note:  The following article was scheduled to be included in
last month's issue of BTN, but was accidentally left out.]



Well, here is the U.S.R. announcement, in, I think, it's entirety,
courtesy of the Internet:

Following the anouncment is a discuession with US Robotics, Dale Walsh,
one of the committee members of the CCITT study group developing the
CCITT V.Fast Standard.


           U.S. ROBOTICS ANNOUNCES THE LAST MODEM YOU'LL EVER BUY
        Provides Migration Path to Forthcoming CCITT 28.8 Kbps Standard
        ---------------------------------------------------------------

     SKOKIE, Ill. -- June 8, 1992 -- U.S. Robotics today announced an upgrade
program for the CCITT-proposed standard of 28.8 Kbps, previously referred to
as V.FAST.  The Courier V.32bis, Courier HST Dual Standard and Shared Access
Modem Sharing Kits are the products currently included in the program. Field
upgrades will be available for $299 as soon as the CCITT 28.8 Kbps draft
recommendation is completed. Official approval of the standard is not
expected until January, 1994.
     "The CCITT-proposed 28.8 Kbps standard won't be a reality for most
manufacturers until 1994," said Jonathan Zakin, U.S. Robotics executive vice
president, sales and marketing.  "By offering modems ready for 28.8 Kbps now,
we're providing insurance against technical obsolescence.  Customers can
purchase a Courier high-speed modem or Shared Access Modem Sharing Kit now
and take advantage of the most updated technology available. When the 28.8
Kbps standard becomes available later, they'll already have a cost-effective
upgrade option and won't have to re-invest in new equipment."
     "Key to the 28.8 Kbps program is the fact that the upgrade to the
Courier high-speed modems and Shared Access Modem Sharing Kits can be
completed by the end user at their worksite, which reduces their `down' time
and eliminates excess costs like shipping and handling," continued Zakin.
"You may hear about other 28.8 Kbps modems that are available now, but until
the standard is defined, no one knows what hardware will be needed to comply.
Our unique modem architecture makes future `field' upgrades a realistic and
simple procedure."
     Because of U. S. Robotics' advanced modular modem architecture, the
company's Courier V.32bis, Courier HST Dual Standard, and Shared Access modems
are readily upgradable to 28.8Kbps. The modems are made up of a motherboard and
a smaller daughterboard, which holds the modems' microprocessors and firmware.
The current, high-speed daughterboard can easily be replaced with a new board
containing the 28.8 Kbps CCITT standard.  U.S. Robotics is the only modem
manufacturer to implement this kind of flexible design.
     "In the CClTT, the previously called `V.FAST' standard has gained
universal support at the 28.8Kbps speed," said Dale Walsh, U.S. Robotics vice
president, advanced development and participant in the CCITT committee on the
28.8 Kbps standard, "This is how our modular architecture works. The data
pump (which executes the modulation and demodulation of the data), and the
key controller functions (which perform the data compression, error control
and the AT command set) are on one board, making upgrades simple. We can
easily make the data pump faster and upgrade the controller functions to keep
up with the new speed. It's all in just one small plug-in card."
     Because compatibility with CCITT standards is crucial, U.S. Robotics'
availability and implementation of the 28.8Kbps standard will depend on the
CClTT's progress.  At this time, the standard is expected to define a connect
speed of 28.8 Kbps, two times faster than V.32bis, the fastest CCITT
standard now available.
     U.S. Robotics is one of the first vendors to announce a program for
28.8Kbps compatibility.  The company has a history of industry "firsts,"
including the first CCITT V.32bis modem from a major manufacturer, the first
self-managing modem management system and the first portable CCITT V.32
modem.
     U.S. Robotics will upgrade any Modem Sharing Kit to 28.8Kbps. Current
Courier models, which have the smaller footprint and a higher, 57.6 Kbps DCE
to DTE (modem-to-computer) interface speed, are also upgradable. The
company's upgrade program does not include WorldPort and Sportster modems.
     U. S. Robotics Courier modems offer a wide range of features, including
fax, remote configuration, and synchronous capabilities. The Shared Access
Modem Sharing Kits, which began shipping in March, 1992, allow for the
pooling of modems on a LAN so that a LAN user can access them for dial-in or
dial-out communications.
     The following products will be upgradable to 28.8 Kbps:

  Courier V.32 bis, internal and external          (57,600 bps versions only)
  Courier HST Dual Standard, internal and external (57,600 bps versions only)
  Courier V.32 bis FAX, internal and external
  Courier HST Dual Standard FAX, internal and external
  Shared Access Modem Sharing Kit Single Port and Dual Port

                    BBSing In The Real World

                               by

                           Damion Furi



:DISILLUSIONED


     I have a confession to make.  I am a prejudiced snob.  And a
very disillusioned one, at that.

     Before those of you scenting blood attempt to charge for the
kill, let me explain something.  I am not your ordinary prejudiced
snob.  I care not a whit whether you are rich or poor, white or
black, heterosexual or homosexual, male or female, physically
handicapped or healthy, nor do I care about any other such label
that normally attracts the prejudiced as sharks to blood.

     I am an intellectual snob, and I have a marked prejudice
against the willfully ignorant and the arrogantly stupid.

     Yes, ladies and gentleman, Damion is going to rant.  I am
going to go on such a binge of ranting as you have rarely
experienced.  Allow me only a moment to pull my soapbox out from
under my desk...Ah, much better.  (I've always maintained that one
simply cannot rant properly without a good old-fashioned wooden
soapbox.)


     Now, where was I?  Oh, yes; the willfully ignorant and the
arrogantly stupid.

     I failed to recognize it until just very recently, but I
realized that I suffered a severe disillusionment from the state of
our BBSs.  I did not - quite - expect an electronic ivory tower.

     But neither did I expect a digital reflection of the
stupidities of the real world.

     For the most part, as I have said before, BBS users and sysops
tend to be a breed apart, as helpful and generous as any you could
wish to meet.  And yet, they still carry over into our private
worlds the attitudes of the outside world: the pettiness, the
viciousness, and the unconscious lousiness of their small-minded
prejudice and hate.

     It must be a lonely feeling, really, to be a two-cent Hitler
from the warmth and comfort of their apartments and homes in the
United States of America ("Land of the Free, Home of the Brave").

     It must be a lonely feeling to be absolutely and unswervingly
convinced that something must be "wrong" with "faggots," and that
"niggers" are "so obviously" subordinate to "us masters," and that
"bitches" are just "absolutely and unquestionably" good for nothing
but "cleaning house" and doing certain other things that our
Beloved Editor would be forced to censor if I were so crude and
tasteless as to actually state the case in black and white in what
is intended to be a "family" magazine (whatever that means).

     Am I really being so naive to expect better from a group that
consistantly shells out thousands of dollars of hard-earned money
to participate in a technological bonanza?  Am I being so naive to
expect intelligent, rational thought from a group that has spent
millions of man-hours learning the various mysteries of a thing as
opaque as the computer?

     So it would seem.  I was naive, and now I am disillusioned.
I have seen the nature of the beast, so to speak, and so walk on
hurt, confused, and dazed.  Please believe me when I say that
little is so painful as having your illusions ripped from your mind
and violently shredded in front of your eyes.

     I wonder how many share my views, and how many will continue
to espouse the putridness of their souls?

     How many of you will continue to seek justification for your
narrow-minded hate?  How many of you will continue to harrass
others politically, socially, or physically weaker than yourselves?
How many of you will continue to voice of your despite of others
that are, in the final analysis, as human as yourselves?

     And, regardless of whom you hate, they are indeed human.  They
bleed, they laugh, they cry, they fail, they succeed, they work,
they play, they are members of families much like your own...  They
have human failings, human virtues, human goals, and human dreams.

     These whom you hate are as deserving of the chances you've had
as you are now deserving of future chances - to do anything!


     Anything at all...

        I was laying in bed this afternoon, reading through the Sunday
paper, when I found something that really ticked me off.  I wondered why
the comic strip that was usually on the last page was now on the second,
and I certainly found out why.....  Here's what I found when I turned to
the last page of the funny papers.....

                          "WE ARE OUTRAGED!

           And we're not going to put up with it any longer!

         We're a group of mothers, fathers, grandparents and other
    citizens who are outraged at how today's movies, TV-programs, music-
    videos and records are hurting our children, our families and our
    country.  For example:
         We're DISMAYED that today 1.1 million girls between the ages of
    15 and 19 get pregnant each year.
         We're SHOCKED when we learn that two thirds of all births to 15
    and 19 year old girls are out of wedlock.
         We're FRIGHTENED at the way violence and crime are spreading
    everywhere and threatening our children, our families and our homes.

       We say it's time to put the blame where we think it belongs:

        SHAME on the music industry for letting singers who are the
    idols of our children put out RECORDS and MUSIC-VIDEOS which
    blatantly encourage sex and 'say' to our children that sex is proper
    at any age...that everyone is 'doing it'...and abstinence is old
    fashioned.
        SHAME on Hollywood for an endless stream of films filled with
    PROFANITY, NUDITY, SEX, VIOLENCE and KILLINGS.  For example, the
    giant hit "Basic Instinct" features murders during orgasms, setting
    a new standard of perversion even for today's movies.
        SHAME on NBC-TV for allowing "Saturday Night Live", which is a
    favorite with young people, to put on skits about masturbation,
    morticians having sex with dead people etc., etc., ad nauseam.
        SHAME on TV programmers whose desire for ratings and profits
    results in the average child of 16 having seen more than 200,000
    ACTS OF VIOLENCE AND 33,000 MURDERS.  Is it any wonder violence is
    epidemic?
        SHAME on the film industry which long ago stopped reflecting the
    values of most families and has now abolished the "X" rating,
    replacing it with "NC-17" so sex-filled, erotic, bloody films will
    no longer be barred from community movie houses.
        SHAME ON TV Soap Opera producers whose standards of decency have
    sunk so low that one of them tells his writers, "Hot, make it hot",
    and another admits they are trying to see "just how far they can
    'push it' on daytime"...when they KNOW that during the afternoon
    hours more than two thirds of all TV viewers are children!
        Yes, we are OUTRAGED at all this...and a great deal more.  We
    say the tragic price our children, families and country are paying
    demands something be done to end what's going on.  Alone we can't
    stop it.  But together we think we can.
        The REAL CAUSE of the sex, violence, filth and profanity is with
    the writers, directors, producers, singers, actors, etc.  But THEY
    can be controlled.  All it takes is for the Boards of Directors of
    their companies to order them to stop!  Remember when movies were
    wholesome family entertainment?  That's when people at the top SET
    STANDARDS AND ENFORCED them.  We're going to insist that happen
    again."


        Well, I agree with them in one place.....but ONLY in one place.
I DO think it's well past time to place the blame for all the problems
in the USA today....but it damn well isn't with the entertainment
industry.  It rests firmly, and solely, with the PARENTS!  Yes, you
HEARD ME!  It's ALL YOUR FAULT!  Wake up and smell the garbage you're
shoveling, people!  Have you got ANY idea where your kid was last night?
Are you SURE?  I'll bet you're WRONG!  And the reason is that the VAST
majority of the parents would rather find some other reason, ANY other
reason, for why their kids are turning out so badly than to admit the
simple truth, that THEY SCREWED UP.  Get off it, parents!  Accept the
fact that you made a BIG mistake, and FIX IT!  Don't look for scapegoats
in Hollywood, you are the ones that are supposed to be in charge of the
developement of your children.  YOU handle their education.  YOU design
their world view.  And YOU are the ones that are FULLY RESPONSIBLE for
the beings you are turning loose on the world when they turn 18 (and
yes, in the state of Alabama you are LEGALLY obligated to provide for
them UNTIL 18.  If you throw them out before then, because you can't
handle the RESPONSIBILITY, they can take YOU to court over it, and WIN.
A girl in Lower Alabama did just that, and now she charges her parents
rent in the house she won from them in the settlement).  But, let's look
at this tirade that was a FULL PAGE AD on the last page of the Sunday
Comics section of the Birmingham News.

        First off, I'm REALLY ticked off because of where they put it.
I can just see it now....you've got a little girl that's just learning
how to read, and is enjoying using the funny papers to do so.  Into the
kitchen wanders your little girl with the funnies, and sits down next to
you at the breakfast table.....

LITTLE GIRL:  "Mommie, what's an ORGASM?  And why do you kill somebody
               when they have one?"
MOMMIE: "WHAT!  Where did you hear THAT?!?!?"

        I'll tell you, Mommie....she read that out of her funny papers,
right there on the last page, in the ad full of big words she was having
lots of fun sounding out to herself a few minutes ago, where it was
talking about a movie named "Basic Instinct".  A movie which this little
girl would known nothing about, because mommy probably didn't take her
when she and daddy went to see it, before coming home and going to bed
early and making all those nice, warm, loving sounds in the bedroom all
night long.....  But now, thanks to an ad which is trying to PROTECT
this little girl, she wants to know from her loving mommie what an
orgasm is, and why it's so bad that you have to kill someone that has
one.  Well, I don't know about YOU, Mommie, but I've NEVER had one that
was that bad.......now look what you have to straighten out.  Little
early for that "talk" you planned to put off until she was 18, isn't it?

        Secondly, it REALLY upsets me when someone else wants to tell me
what I can and can not watch, see, or WRITE.  Yes, WRITE.  You see, I'm
also one of those TERRIBLE PEOPLE that are destroying this country by
writing "erotica".  So what?  I DON'T go stand outside of a schoolyard
and grab little boys and girls and make them read it.  I DON'T take
mine, or anyone else's, to ANYONE of ANY age and force them to read or
view it.  I don't know of ANYONE that has been tied down, their fingers
broken and the battery taken out of their remote control (because
everyone knows there is no other way to change the channel than by
remote control) so they HAVE to watch these TERRIBLE things that are
broadcast on TV every day.  And I DEFINATELY don't know of anyone that
has been forced to watch a Soap Opera......  Not too many years ago a
preacher did something I'm never going to forgive him for.  Some
preacher here in this great state decided that he didn't like a satelite
TV channel named American XXX-tasy.  So what did he do?  Not watch it?
No, that would have been the intelligent thing to do.  Instead, he
decided that he'd have to get rid of it.  He decided, for you, that he
didn't want ANYONE to watch it.  Maybe he just felt that if it were
still being broadcast to this state, he'd be too tempted to go over to
his friend's house and watch it, I don't know.  All I know is that this
man decided that *I* could no longer watch that particular satelite TV
channel, and he managed to get it blocked from reception to all of the
state of Alabama.  How, I do not know.  The mechanics of it is something
that I puzzle over even today.  I would REALLY like to know how it's
done, but no matter, it's done, and now I CAN'T watch it any more.  He
made HIS choice, he doesn't watch it anymore.  But he ALSO made the
choice for every other person in this state.  NO ONE in this state can
now watch it, except for those few along the borders that can barely
pick it up where it's being sent to the states around us.  These people
are trying to do the same thing, but to EVERYONE, not just the state of
Alabama, and NOT JUST ONE CHANNEL, but ALL CHANNELS, as well as ALL
MOVIES, VIDEO TAPES, RADIO STATIONS, BOOKS, NEWSPAPERS, MAGAZINES, in
fact, ANYTHING that can be determined to be ANYTHING that THEY don't
like.....which basically can be interpreted to be almost anything that
*I* DO like.....

        Think about it for a minute, people.  They are calling for an
end to all of the things that make life interesting these days.  They
want all the movies that come out of Hollywood to be carbon copies of
the movie "It's a Wonderful Life".  You know the one....Jimmy Stewart
gets to find out what life would be like without him in it....the one
that plays OVER and OVER again every Christmas.  How many of you get
sick of it when you hear it starting up?  I thought so.....  What these
people want is for all the people that are making so much money off of
these movies to stop making them.  THINK a minute.  So much money.
Hmmmmmm, well, where does the money come from?  Someone must like these
movies.....  Someone must like these movies ALOT.  It's these few that
DON'T like them, or don't like US liking them.  The mere fact that so
much money is made from all these "destructive" things is because they
are POPULAR.  They are what people WANT.  Don't think that just because
SO MANY like it that it can't be taken away, though.  People liked that
satelite TV channel too, but a handful of people got rid of it.  The ad
that ran Sunday states that they have 738,983 petitions to put a stop to
this entertainment, and it was far less than that that got rid of a TV
channel.

        One of the last things in the ad is this....

        "Spare us the censorship lecture - you in the entertainment
        industry.  And this is not an appeal for prudery.  All we want
        is to get the movie, TV and record industries to act
        responsibly.  Our children, our families and our country are
        being hurt too much for us to remain silent."

        The movie, TV, and record industries ARE acting responsibly, it
is YOU, the parents, that are not.  Like I said above, quit trying to
find a scapegoat and get to work RAISING your kids.  It's YOUR job, YOUR
responsibility, and YOUR children.  In the end, you're going to be the
only one you can blame if you screw it up, so grow up, and then help
your children to do so.  In fact, you might even want to go so far as to
TRY and learn a little from you children.  Chances are, they're a Hell
of alot more adult than most of you.....  Don't complain when they start
lieing to you and blaming other children for their mistakes....after
all, it's what you're teaching them to do right now.......

                       Sysop >< Software >< User
                             by David Moss


    Recently, I made a flippant statement regarding the success of
software being dependant on the user.  The exact quote later.  So, after
a ton of messages, all of which is overwhelmingly against that
statement, I wish for equal time for a rebuttal.  Now for the (infamous
and profound) statement that got me into all of this:

    "The success of the software is determined by the user, not the
sysop."

    At first glance, it seems innocent enough, but, after a few messages
to me on this subject, I started to do some thinking on it.  You see,
the statement was made in response to the controversy over the new Robo
BBS software.  It seemed an appropriate concept (at that time) that if
the users took a liking to it that it would probably succeed.  Before we
go to far, keep in mind that I am referring to "software", and not a
particular bulletin board.

    When a person sets out to start a bulletin board (after his or her
analyst has prescribed proper medication), one of the first decisions
he or she will be faced with is the selection of "software".  Now there
are other considerations (divorce lawyers, telephone lines, modems,
computers, where you will leech your files from, and so forth), but for
now, lets stay with the "software".

    Let's say you've got a catalog in front of you that lists every
available BBS "software" on today's market.  The first column your eyes
may be attracted to is the price column.  And that's okay, because
everyone does not have an unlimited budget.  What the average person may
do here is set a limit, and attempt to get the most for his or her
dollar.  (NOT ME, I put mine on VISA and worried about paying for it
later; I hid the bill, and told hun it was the "test drive version", but
then you already knew I'm not average.)

    Now that you are faced with capabilities, what exactly will this
"software" do?  What do you need it to do?  Do you need it with door
capabilities?  What about file transfer protocols?  Does it support all
of the standard ones in use today?  Does it come with a mail door (for
dummies like me who can't type)?  Is it multi-node?  (You may want this
type; you can always hide the phone bill, and another modem is real easy
to hide.)  Does it support a front end mail tosser?  What about editing
options?  How many users will the database support?  Has it got graphic
capabilities?  Are graphics optional or mandatory?  Does it come with a
screen saver?  What about maximum file areas?  (THIS IS IMPORTANT for
when you REALLY begin sucking files from other boards.)  Okay, I think
you've got the picture.  You must agree that there are a plethora of
questions for considerations on the "software" alone.

    You see, things like modems are easy to make a decision on. (Do
like I did: have a "pair" of 16.8 "dualies" Fed-Exed in from U.S.
Robotics -- Visa of course -- and tell hun they're "smoke detectors".
After all, you will need two modems.  You can't have the board down due
to a lame modem.  MAKE SURE that you are the one who gets the bill on
this little stunt!  One slip here, and you may need that attorney I
mentioned earlier.)

    Ok, for some final conclusions, we finally come to setup.  Is this
software easy to set up?  Or do you have to sit with the manual in your
lap?  Are you constantly on the phone to the author in Poland?  Since
you will be the very first person to USE this "software", it should be
easy to set-up, structure the security profiles, conference definitions,
door assembly, and leave a small "footprint".

    Now you should be ready for the first few callers.  Here is where I
originally thought the success was determined.  And, there is some merit
to the "Statement".  Right here is where your USER takes over (although
not entirely, so don't write me on this one point).  If the USER logs on
and has little or no trouble negotiating the "software", then can you
say it will be a success?  Not hardly!  You see, when I "shot from the
hip" with that statement I was thinking of the USER as the person who
calls the board and logs on.  And I was right to a certain degree. I
only forgot one thing!  And that is that the very "first" person that
logs onto that board will be the sysop.  If this "software" does not
work for the very first user (which will be the sysop), then that user
will determine the success of that particular "software".

    In closing, when I made that fateful statement, I was confusing user
with sysop.  In reality, they are both users; that particular "software"
must function properly for both: the sysop, who will probably spend more
time logging on than anyone else, and the user, who calls on occasion.
Whichever side of the fence you're on, you must agree with that.

    "The User Determines The Success of The Software". ( period )

    How was that for weaseling my way out of a fix?

    One final word: This is such an expensive hobby.  If you decide to
take the plunge, take the time to do a little research.  Ask some
friends for advice, ask manufacturers for pamphlets or even "test drive
versions".  Don't just plug a phone wire in and call yourself a BBS.
You will find that it takes a lot of money and time to do this stuff,
all with very little thanks from anyone.  But, to me, it's the greatest
hobby in the world!  And if I ever get in a tight, I can always sell a
couple of used "smoke detectors".

                             See ya in a conference somewhere, I hope!

Local Music In March
by Judy Ranelli


Mon. 1
    Celebrity Toast and Jam at The Nick
    What is the world IS this?  I have no idea.  One sometimes has to
take chances.  If it's awful, you can always leave.

Tue. 2
    ITCHY WIGS at The Nick
    Mark Kimbrell is one of those people who manages to keep revolving
players in a band and still kick butt.

Thur. 4
    SPUNKADILLY at Flamingos
    They are from Huntsville and are one of the weirdest acts I've seen
lately.  If you're in the SCA and its ilk you probably would like them.
Jury's still out on my vote.

Fri. 5
    SUGAR LA-LAS/PINKY THE STABBER at Louie Louie
    Wouldn't you know that two of my favorite bands are finally playing
together!  I don't have to work, so I'm going to have fun.

Mon. 8
    GOD'S FAVORITE BAND/BUMPING UGLIES at The Nick
    The Uglies are completely chaotic and anything with the name God's
Favorite Band gets my attention, even if just for a brief visit.  Not
for Journey fans.

Tues. 9
    TOPPER PRICE at Oteys
    He has a penchant for pissing off club owners and plays music too.
What more could you want?

Thurs. 11
    SUGAR LA-LAS at The Underground (in Montevallo)
    I point this out because I was unaware that this place existed, and
I like the La Las, so it would be something I'd attend if I wanted an
excuse for a short road trip.  I might even get some free beer out of
the La Las.

Fri. 12
    ELLEN JAMES SOCIETY at the Rock'n Horse
    Didn't know this band still existed.  Have no idea what they sound
like, but they are from Atlanta (oooooooh).  Will write home soon.

Sat. 13
    PINKY THE STABBER at The Nick
    Okay, I already mentioned them earlier this month but if you missed
that you should see this.

Wed. 17
    REMY ZERO at The Nick
    Their fabled contract, according to sources, is on Capitol.  It
appears they intend to perform live these days, so come check them out.

Thur. 18
    MAMBO COMBO at Oteys
    This strange mutation of the Ho-Ho Men rises again to surprise me.
I enjoyed them years ago: if it's the same members I'll enjoy them now.

Fri. 19
    HO-HO MEN at The Nick
    Ah, I see the light!  Apparently Ho-Ho Men reunions are going to
consistently occur on my worknights.  I'm jealous of you who shall
attend.

Sat 20
    WEBB WILDER at Louie Louie
    He has been here many times and his shows are consistently fun.

Thurs. 25
    BISCUITS at The Underground (in Montevallo)
    Led by Will Kimbrough, of Will and the Bushmen.  He is a very nice
person, one heck of a guy, and I just may go down there and see his
band.  I expect they will be great.

Sat. 27
    DASH RIP ROCK/BARKING TRIBE at The Nick
    Do you like Dash Rip Rock?  I don't, actually, but lots of people
do.  I'm just too cool to like anything that popular, you know what I
mean?  So I'll slink inside and lurk in a corner to watch the Barking
Tribe.  Then I'll leave and everyone else can dance and drink and have
fun.

Mon. 29
    GRISTLE TWINS at The Nick
    There is NO band that I have heard more talk about lately then the
Gristle Twins.  Everyone who talks about them insists that they are
great.  If I were you, and you happened to be 21 or 22, and a "120
Minutes" addict, and you were bored and free this Monday, I would go
check it out.  After all, if you hate it, you can always blame me.

The Nick is trying an experiment called "Saturday Night Six Pack" this
March 20, which is rumored to be six little known local bands in a row.
The logistics of this concept stagger me.  First, they will have to fit
six bands worth of equipment in the club.  Then they will have to do six
sound checks (poor soundman!) and each band will have to play a very
short set.  Finally, the bands will have to split the pay six ways.
Will this work?  I can't see how it would work *smoothly*.  Will I
attend?  If I can, out of curiosity.  Personally, I think that it's
high time some lesser known bands got the opportunity to play weekends
in Birmingham.  Bands are in a Catch-22: they are expected to draw a
crowd on a weeknight, when everyone has to work the next day, in order
to earn a weekend night.  The end result is a couple of popular bands
remain popular and the rest spin their heels on weeknights.  Then, when
the popularity of a weekend band fades, there is nothing to replace
them.  I hope this changes.

Louie Louie is making a sincere effort to book alternative bands.  They
offered Alice Donut last month and Suzanne Vega sometime soon (although
I couldn't find out when.)

BTN ProFile

    If you've perused the message bases (most notably the Baud Brothers
and RoadKill Ralph's conferences) on Alter Ego, you may have run across
a curious phenomenon who just burst on the scene.  Not being one to deny
your right to the latest breaking news, I have managed to catch this
newcomer in our midst and grab him long enough to ask him a few
questions.  I know you're just dying for the answers, so without further
delay, here's a:

                       ProFile on Billy Bob Crawdad

Age:  I'm in my prime, son!  Oh, you want an actual number?  In that
      case, let's just say 40+.

Birthplace:  Nashville, TN

Occupation:  Homeless vagabond and one-time goat and pig farmer.

My hobbies include:  Trying to get my twin brother, Bob Crawford, to
                     invite me over for Chili.  I want to see if his
                     recipe approximates that of our dear old mother.
                     I doubt I will be able to make this comparison
                     since he continues to deny my existence.

Years telecomputing:  Less than 1.  Three days, actually.

My oddest habit is:  Herding all the goats into the barn, locking the
                     doors, turning the lights down low and...  No,
                     wait.  That's my brother's oddest habit.

My greatest unfulfilled ambition is:  To be accepted and loved by my
                                      dear brother, Bobbles!

The single accomplishment of
which I am most proud is:  Finding the kind folks at Alter Ego who were
                           nice enough to give me a forum in which to
                           entreat my brother to open up his heart to
                           me.  That, and graduating the third grade.

My favorite performers are:  The Everly Brothers, The Bee Gees and the
                             Smothers Brothers

The last good movie I saw was:  "Brother Rat" with Ronald Reagan, an
                                actor's actor.

The last good book I read was:  "The Brothers Karamazov"

If they were making a movie of my life,
I'd like to see my part played by:  Why, Bobbles, of course.  There's
                                    such an uncanny resemblance.

My pet peeves are:  Being thought of as the figment of my brother's
                    imagination.

When nobody's looking, I like to:  Herd all the goats into the barn,
                                   lock all the doors and...oh.  I
                                   told you about that already.
