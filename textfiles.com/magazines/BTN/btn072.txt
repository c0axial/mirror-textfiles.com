    ################################################################


    Well, we're running late this month, so all I have are a few
content-related matters.

    First off, please welcome Tim Cook to these pages.  As of this
month, he bravely/foolishly takes over the duties behind the desk
of the Known BBS Numbers list.  We sincerely hope that Tim knows what
he's getting into.

    Next, note the Halloween party announcement!  A grand old BTN
tradition returns: people getting together and making fools of
themselves, usually in the flash of a camera lens.  Trust me, we
invented it before anyone else did.

    Judy Ranelli returns after a well-deserved vacation, with her
superior recommendations for local music.  If you're the type to see
bands in clubs, (1) read her column and (2) obey her advice.  If you're
not the type, turn of the television set, put on some shoes, then follow
(1) and (2).

    David Moss' SEC schedule was inadvertently left out of last month's
issue.  I know, the season is nearly half over now, but I thought I'd
include it anyway.  It's a short issue.

    That's it!  See you at the party.  I'll be the one dodging the
camera.

If you need further directions, please call (205)-823-3956.  If you
reach the answering service, do leave a message.  Your call will be
returned, provided you leave a valid phone number in the message.

We will probably have some snack foods on hand and soft drinks. If you
have a preference as to food, then be sure to bring it. If you are of
legal age, you will be expected to bring your own alcoholic beverage,
should you desire them. If you are not, then don't bring any as you will
be asked to leave.  Do not bring any illegal substances or items or you
will also be asked to leave. The Vestavia Police are not known to be as
forgiving as have been the Birmingham Police.

Due to complications from the last party, I must ask that you remain on
my property, preferably near or in the house.  If you wander, are overly
loud, or litter, especially while on the street or on other property, my
neighbors have been advised to call the Vestavia Police since I cannot
possibly police you.  It is unfortunate that I must give such advice,
but past experience and complaints demands it.

A primitive map follows.

The easiest route is to get on Columbiana Road via either US HWY 31 or I-65N
exit to Vestavia/Hoover.  Proceed up Columbiana to Tyler Road.  Take Tyler
Road to Twin Branch Drive.  Take the left fork to Twin Branch Terrace.  Our
House is the next to last on the right side of the street.  The "X"'s mark
the location.  The asterisks refer to traffic lights.  The first is at the

    ################################################################
    SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

    ################################################################


I. ARTICLE LENGTH

    Right now, there's no strict enforcement of a length restriction,
but if your submission is somewhat short, I may request that you make it
longer.  Anyone can sit down and type out a screen's worth of stuff.  I
have yet to encounter an article that was too *long*, so don't worry
about that.


II. SUBJECT MATTER

    Again, there's no hard-and-fast rules about subject matter.  I'm
interested in seeing material on a wide variety of topics.  That
includes BBSs, politics, music, books, or better yet, something that
doesn't neatly fall into any one category.  Next to that, my favorite
articles are the ones that have something to do with BBSing, since that
is supposedly what we're sort of about.  Technical reviews are also
good.  I tend to kind of frown on fiction, but I'm willing to take a
look at anything you've got.  If it's interesting enough, your chances
are good.
    Politics is fine, but try not to rant--and make whatever you have to
say original.  I can go out and find ten Rush Limbaughs if I want.
    Also refrain from "This Is What Happened To Me Today" slice-of-life
articles unless it's leading somewhere good.
    Reviews should be both informative and opinionated.  Don't be too
objective, but still tell us about what you're reviewing.


III. FILE FORMAT

    Plain and simple ASCII is preferred, but we can convert WordPerfect
files if need be.
    Do not use ANSI characters or special graphics.


IV. STYLE GUIDELINES

1.  Use a right margin of 72 columns.
2.  Indent paragraphs at the fifth column.
3.  Put two spaces after each sentence.
4.  Skip a line after each paragraph.
5.  Refrain from using BBS-specific devices like "<grin>" and ":-)".
6.  Be sure to give your article a title.
7.  Try to use correct grammar, spelling and capitalization!  My staff
    proofread as best as we can, but a well-typed article makes our job
    easier.
8.  The dash is correctly typed as two hyphens, like "--".  Use it to
    set apart phrases and clauses--as with this sentence.
9.  To emphasize a word, place a pair of asterisks around it, like
    *this*.  This takes the place of italics (except for titles; see
    12).
10. If you have to emphasize a group of words, use capitals, AS IN THIS
    EXAMPLE.  I generally don't like the way that looks, so use it
    sparingly, if at all.
11. If you're unsure whether to spell out a number or not, leave it in
    numeral form.
12. Titles of books, films, plays, albums and works of art are
    surrounded by underlines, like: U2's _The Joshua Tree_.  This takes
    the place of italics in this regard; I call it "title-cizing".
    On the other hand, television shows, songs, poems, article titles
    and short stories are surrounded by quotation marks.


V. HOW DO I SUBMIT AN ARTICLE?

    The easiest way is to upload it as a private file on one of two
systems: The Matrix and the Crunchy Frog.  (Their phone numbers are
listed at the end of this feature.)  To upload a file privately, begin
your file description with a slash ("/").  Then leave me (SCOTT
HOLLIFIELD) a private message telling me what the file name is, so that
I can have the sysop make it available for me.
    Another way is to leave me the article as a private message, or a
series of private messages.
    If you become a regular contributor to BTN, you can get access to
the private BTNWA conference, which is for BTN writers.  There we
discuss articles, policy, ideas, etc.  The BTNWA conference also
contains a private file directory which I can access more easily than a
private file outside BTNWA.
    Finally, as an alternative, if you live outside of the local
Birmingham area and you don't wish to call long distance, you can submit
an article via Internet e-mail.  My address is scotth@the-matrix.com.

    That's it!

    Get to work!

    LETTERS TO
    THE EDITOR                                      From BTN Readers
    ################################################################

[Editor's note: This letter, from our own publisher, was intended to
appear in last month's issues, but somehow slipped through the cracks.
Sorry!]

From: Mark Maisel
BBS: Crunchy Frog


    Scott, I read issue 70 with great interest to see what you would
say in regards to the delay in getting it out.  I feel compelled to
respond to some articles that caught my eye.  I thought the entire issue
was very good, though I will admit to having skipped Dean's review; my
interest in cinema being what it is.

re: Editorial

"    Oh, one final note.  It has come to my attention that a certain
publisher whose initials are the same as Marilyn Monroe may have placed
BTN's name in a national, Internet-distributed catalog, where it sits"

You really ought to ask about these things before you plant the seeds of
innuendo.  My participation on Internet consists of lots of e-mail, a
few lists to which I subscribe, and a couple of bizarre news groups.  I
am excited to hear about requests for BTN over the network.  I wish you
had said something to me.  I do not think it would be too difficult to
set up a site for BTN.

re: Gary Hasty

"    Ya know...I used to read BTN and the Frog's main board, and giggle
(like a little party girwl) over the BBS-geek wars y'all seem to always
have in Birmingham."

They are cute.  Cute like boils that are ripe.  It is a pity that folks
delight in pettiness.  I have mixed feelings at hearing of other places
similarly afflicted.

re: OPPRESSION

"no longer think for ourselves.  Society has given us its standards and
told us to conform to them or else.  But I say forget conformity; it is"

Society is a reflection of the individuals who share common traits
and/or circumstances in a population.  Part of that reflection is
standards for our behavior.  For good or bad, all societies reflect
standards.

There are any number of means you might employ to your benefit in
regards to your stance toward the society in which you currently reside.
Whining isn't one of them.

Maisel

[Editor's reply: Regarding the new interest in BTN over the Internet,
I was under the mistaken impression that Mark had submitted BTN's name
to a national Internet-distributed electronic publication list.  I
believe I misremembered something that was said to me at some point;
however the error happened, I regret publishing it before verifying its
accuracy.  The list in question is edited by John Labovitz and is
posted at regular intervals on nine different Usenet newsgroups,
including alt.zines and alt.internet.services.  John's email address
is johnl@netcom.netcom.com.  The list is also available via anonymous
FTP as well as WorldWide Web.

The description for BTN looks like this:
 "It is a nebulous zine that covers things from computer reviews to
  industry articles to general fiction to whatever the editor feels
  like putting in. It also contains the monthly BBS listing for the
  Birmingham metro area. BTN has been published for over 5 years."

More or less accurate, I suppose.  I'd appreciate it if whoever gave
our name to the list would let me know, just to satisfy my curiosity.

    WHAT DO ALL THESE
    LETTERS MEAN?                                        Mark Maisel
    ################################################################



"From: GEOFF TAYLOR
 To: ALL
 Subject: 486 chips..

 I have one of those universal questions floating in my head... What's
 the difference between 486DX, 486SLC, and 486DLC chips?  Also, what
 about chips made by Cyrix and AMD?  Are they really comparable to
 Intel?"


    I saw this one a while back and grabbed it and waited for an
opportunity to expound.  Here goes!

    I make no guarantees as to the completeness nor absolute accuracy of
this article.  It is solely based on what I have read, heard, and seen
at trade shows, company literature, and at parties after the shows.

    Intel designed and produces the 486DX microprocessor.  It is a true
32 bit processor, that is, it is capable of sending and receiving 32 bit
instructions and hunks of data.  What this means for you, provided you
aren't strapped by an antiquated peripheral bus, less than optimal
support hardware, and an old 8 bit operating system, is that you can
process data real fast.  Even with the aforementioned handicaps, you can
still work a useful pace.  The 486DX has a number of useful features
including 8 kilobytes of cache for pre-fetching data and instructions so
as to speed up processing, a floating point processor, and compatibility
with previous microprocessors of X86 vintage.  That last may not be
considered an advantage to some but it is for most desktop computer
users.

    For completeness, I will describe the 486SX, also designed and
produced by Intel.  This microprocessor was introduced to fill a niche
market, low end machines for the cost conscious consumer with little to
spend.  The primary difference, as I understand it, between the SX and
DX series is that the SX lacks the floating point processor.  This means
that software requiring or preferring such a processor will either not
run or run much more slowly.

    The SLC and DLC series were not designed by Intel, at least not
exclusively.  I understand that the SLC was designed in part by IBM.
Its original and still most frequently used purpose is for notebook and
laptop computers.  The reason for this is that it consumes less power
than the SX or DX chips designed by Intel.  The SLC resembles the SX in
many ways save that it, as I recall, has a smaller cache for pre-
fetching instructions.  The DLC was designed by IBM or Cyrix. Memory
fails me.  It is a low power chip that is similar to the SX.  It is used
in desktop machines at the low end as are the SLC and SX.  These
processors will not, as I understand it, operate with a true 32 bit
operating system such as OS/2 or Windows NT.  I don't think you'd want
to try either, even if you could, as the speed would be impractical...as
in lack of...

    The chips that Cyrix sells are, for all practical purposes,
compatible enough with Intel's 486 series to run MS-DOS and MS-Windows,
and applications for both.  In the case of AMD, the chips I've seen and
used, 486SX and 486DX models, are completely compatible with those made
by Intel.  They also run faster and at lower temperature.  As machines
using these microprocessors are generally less expensive than comparable
machines using Intel microprocessors, I consider them a better buy.  It
is for these reasons that Intel has taken AMD to court repeatedly in an
effort to stop them from making their microprocessors.  Each time, they
have been thwarted.  Many years ago, Intel and AMD signed a licensing
agreement and that agreement gives AMD access to much of Intel's
technology.  That they have exploited it so well is what angers Intel.
It also forces Intel to lower their prices much more quickly than they'd
like.  I hope this helps.

    REVIEW: Compaq Aero 4/25
    (plus a personal history
    of personal computers)                             Dean Costello
    ################################################################


    I have been involved with computers since about 1978, when I saw my
first real computer.  I had always been an afficionando of a Radio
Shack : vaguely cool electronic stuff, digital watches, calculators; the
kinds of things that lead to wet dreams for the pre-adolescent coming of
age in the late '70s/early '80s.  One fine day, I noted that the local
Radio Shack had a new display in its front window, with a big sign
saying "Home Computer!"  What was this marvel?  I pressed an oily nose
to the display window, and noted The Computer : A TRS-80 microcomputer
with a whopping 4k of ram.  Entranced with the concept of "computer", I
strode into the Shack with the most aplomb that I could gather in my
twelve-year old personality, and asked to try using The Computer.  And I
tried using the computer, and found out that it used Basic to do, well,
anything.  I started paging through the manual that was next to the
computer and found little to help me with the computer, except for a
simple program that went something like:

10 PRINT "HI!"
20 GOTO 10

    The pages of "HI!" that I got from my programming effort were, to
say the least, a tad underwhelming.  You see, I was weened on such
computer-heavy things as _Colossus: The Forbin Project_, "Star Trek",
and _2001: A Space Odyssey_.  Hell, I remember in 1974 when _2001_ was
re-released, my father came and took my brother and I out of fourth and
second grade (respectively) to go down to the Cumberland Mall and see
it.  Computers were supposed to be these big lumbering beasts, lots of
lights, switches, and buttons, maybe a tape drive or two cranking away
in the background; steel as far as the eye can see.  This is a computer,
and the TRS-80 wasn't exactly what I was expecting.

    In my senior year of high school, I took a computer science-like
class that was being offered by the local high school.  We worked on
TRS-80s with...<drum roll>...floppy drives.  It was a very good time for
technology.  The only thing that I really got from this class is that
there is some kind of 'language' that controls the computer, from which
you can run stuff or do stuff like run the interactive Basic
application.  This was called a disk operating system, or in this
particular case, TRS-DOS [phonetic spelling].

    Those were heady times, when the big microcomputer competition was
between the mighty TRS-80 (black and white screen attached to keyboard,
crappy applications, but with a more Science-like sensation) and the
Apple II (better graphics, but you had to dick around with something
called a shape table).  For more than $1500, neither of these options
really appealed to me, so I choose to wait.

    I soon had something better, though.  My father got caught up in the
"Every Home Needs a Computer" craze, as well as a finely orchestrated
advertising campaign helmed by Bill Cosby, and he bought a TI-99.  For
Christmas 1982, I got the Peripheral Expansion Box.  Goddammit, this
looked like a computer.  Burnished metal finish, a deep, throaty hum,
large slot-like things.  This thing said "TECHNOLOGY" in no uncertain
terms.  This device contained the floppy drive, a mighty 32K memory
expansion card, disk controller card, communications card (sounding
familiar to you IBM jox yet?).  Wonderful little computer, but
unfortunately, the keyboard was about 1/4 smaller than average, and
typing on it became a bitch.  It was at about this time that programming
and fun became on oxymoron for me.

    We fast-forward to college.  The school I attended had just bought a
brand-new mainframe, an upgrade from the PDP-11 that had served so well
for so many years, more or less.  It was a DEC VAX 11/780 (the first or
second year they were released, I believe).  This was my "home computer"
for several years.  Now this looked like a computer.  Many large metal
boxes containing Computer Equipment: tape drives, large banks of
blinking lights that I don't think really did anything.  The computer
was placed in an glass-encased computer center that was smack in the
middle of my campus.  On cold winter Central Pennsylvania evenings, it
was neat to see the technological glow of the Vax eminating from the
across the campus.  Now this was a computer.

    There were several IBM microcomputers floating around the campus,
but they were judged to be little more than toys, to be used very
infrequently, and only when absolutely necessary.  I tried my hand on
the great beige beast with the very manly red power switch, using a
small word processor called Volkswriter, which struck me as silly and
user-hostile.  And as a result, I didn't really fool around with IBMs
at the time.

    Sometime around my junior year, the college decided that micro-
computers were Good Things, and since they were satisfied with the
Mighty Vax, they figured that the people at DEC would make a pretty good
microcomputer.  It was called the DEC Rainbow, and the school bought
about fifty of them.  Another of the beige brand of computer, it was
unique in that it had a blue monochrome monitor, and twin floppy drives
that were reversed in respect to each other.  Two weeks after the
purchase was completed, and we accepted delivery, DEC called a news
conference that stated that they would no longer support the Rainbow.
There was a lot of wailing/gnashing of teeth in the Mathematics
department that evening (yes, the days when the computer geeks were in
the Math department, and not vice versa). This was my first experience
with a company killing a product, and it made me wary.

    I graduated from college in 1987 with a molecular biology-kind of
degree.  My grandmother gave me $1000, and I knew I was going to buy a
computer.  My brother bought an Atari 520ST, and I liked what I saw. So,
a year after my brother bought his, I bought the upper-end model: The
1040ST, packing an entire meg of memory, an internal 720K floppy drive,
a mouse (Mouse?  What's a mouse?), a combined CPU/keyboard console
encased in a tasteful beige plastic container, and nice software right
out of the box.  What a nice computer, and it kept me satisfied until
about 1993 or so.

    People at the office were mocking me for continuing to use my Atari.
"Hey, I saw a good game of "Asteroids" for your computer a couple of
days ago", one of my colleagues would say [like there's no "Asteroids
knock-offs for the PC]; "How can you type so fast on a membrane
keyboard?" another would ask [that's the Atari 400]; "Where does the
game cartridge fit?" said a third [Confusing my computer with a 2600
game machine].  Basically, they were mocking my machine, for no good
reason.

    "It does everything I want it to do," I would whine back to them,
knowing deep in my heart-of-hearts that technology had left the ST
behind.  I had to get a new computer, but what kind?

    PC: I had lead so many attacks against the PC-slaves that it would
hypocritical to use one of those bastards at this stage of the game.
There sure was a lot of software for them, though, and at reasonable
prices.  But what about those expansion slots?  Or system interrupts?
Or the interleave questions?  The above scared me, especially since I
could only think of one person (Chris Mohney) who has owned a PC
without it crash-and-burning on him.

    Mac: Very smug owners.  Reading Mac magazines was like reading "Spy"
magazine and not living in New York City : A lot of in-jokes, and a
feeling of "eventually, you will choose the right machine, the
Macintosh". Basically, a creepy sensation.  The software was god-awful
expensive, and it was a bitch to find it.  The mouse is nice, though.  A
damned sight better than Windows.

    So what did I do?  I kept the Atari for about two years longer than
necessary.  Eventually, I did pick up a PC.  It was a Compaq Aero 4/25.
What necessitated it is unclear even now.  Look, whenever I decided to
buy what is generally considered to be a big-ticket item (more than
about $200, in my terms), I usually dilly-dally about it for about a
month, then decide I don't want it after all.  One day I called Mark
Maisel and said, "This is it.  Find me a portable.  Make it cheap.  Get
back to me."  He recommended the Compaq.

    The company I work for has a plan through which you can get a
no-interest loan for a computer and peripherals.  I had debated for
several years in buying about $3500 worth of computer paraphenalia since
if you go over $3000, the cost is spread out over 2 years.  I
discovered, though, that once I started on the road to More Things (ie.
more and more peripherals, faster microprocessor, more memory than the
NSA requires), it will never end.  I ended up with Mac systems that were
running in the $5000 range.  Hell, for a stretch there, I was debating
getting a Silicon Graphics Indy work station (base price $5000).  This
was just getting silly.  One of the Artificial Intelligence people at
the office, after I told him I was getting a computer, said, "Look,
Dean, I have been hearing this for three years now.  Show me the owners
manual, and we'll talk.  Until then, don't say a fucking word."

    So I didn't.  I did wander down to a place called Microcenter near
my apartment.  Nice enough place; kind of the like the K-mart of the
computer crowd : Pretty good prices, pretty good selection of stuff.  I
ambled into the portable department, and saw one of the Aeros that Mark
recommended.  Sat down at it.  Keyboard felt nice.  Matte-black plastic
container that matches my stereo equipment.  Trackball a tad silly, no
buttons on it to make it do anything.  "They're on the side," said a
tired salesperson.  I didn't know she was talking to me, so I kept
fiddling around, trying to imitate a button-push action, and she got up
closer and repeated herself.  Realizing that she was indeed talking to
me, I found the buttons, and immediately realized that it was an
ergonomic disaster.  Alas, I thought, for $1000, what do you expect?
Perfection?  On the whole, I like the way it worked.  The screen was
nice and clear, bright enough to read under the unrelenting fluorescent
bulbs of your typical showroom.  This would do.

    You see, I wasn't looking for the end-all, be-all of computers.  I
was looking for something to serve me right now.  I cannot personally
justify having a portable computer that has a 486 microprocessor, or a
gigabyte drive, or 30-odd megs of memory.  I just need a computer that
can do word processing so I can write, a nice communications package,
and maybe a game or two.  As a result, the Aero was just about perfect
for my purposes.

    So, I got up the gumption to buy the bloody thing.  They gave me a
quote of $999 for the computer, and $149 or so for the external floppy
drive (I have been amazed at how little I really need a floppy disk).  I
took the quote back to the office and got the loan paperwork in motion.
The money in hand, I called the nice people at MicroCenter and asked
whether or not they had any computers.  For two weeks they played coy
with me.  Two weeks!  I finally called them once again and begged for
something, anything; I was no longer proud.  They told me that there was
a computer that was brought back to the store.  Hold that bitch for me,
I'll be there at about 6 p.m.

    Well, to make a very long story just long, I got the computer at
home, and played with it.  Wasn't too bad, except it defaulted to
Windows.  I fixed that problem, and noted that the 81 meg harddrive only
had about 20 megs free.  Hmmm, things will have to die.  I have, in the
meantime, ravaged an awful lot of the "productivity software" that came
with the computer.  Lotus Organizer died early on.  Microsoft
Entertainment Pack 4 died as well.  Microsoft's shell for Windows has
gone to meet its electronic maker.  It was brutal, but room had to be
made for the hometown software.

    So, now I have Qedit and Telix, Norton Utilities and Word Perfect
(long story, so be quiet), Doom and Boloball.  Good software.  Useful
software.

    Complaints: Though the customer service is pretty good, it took me
over 50 minutes to get through to a human.  I spent over two hours on
the phone determining that a video text accelerator I found doesn't
want to play with the video drivers onboard the Compaq.  I also am not
getting the battery life that the advertisement claims I am getting (I
have the setting at pretty much maximum power saving, but I am getting
little more than 2 hours out of it).

    Praise: It has a very nice keyboard.  Not quite as good as some of
them, but it feels similar to my Atari, and I have clocked myself at the
low 80s cps.  There is a clever function called "Hibernate".  Basically,
it shuts the power to the computer down, and at the same times saves the
place you are so that when you turn the power back on the computer
doesn't have to reboot.  It comes with MS-DOS 6.2 (which I upgraded to
6.22), and it appears to be pretty bulletproof (I have heard Bad Things
about the disk doubler thing).

    Bottom line: Go forth and buy it.  It is a useful beast for being on
the road.  It is pretty inexpensive, and the screen is pretty sharp.

    This month I have decided to actually deliver a column on time.  M.
Hollifield can take credit for ahem, reminding me a few times to Get
Finished.  A lot happened during my "break".  I had the honor of being
one of three lonely acts to NOT get rained out at the Southside
Festival, and The Ticks got a song played on the Bear's local show (on
(Sunday evenings).  I didn't attend Bearstock '94 but understand it was
a popular event, with lots of bikers showing up.  I am very glad for the
existence of the Bear--give me Cygnus X-1 over Phil Collins any day--and
the alternative offerings are most welcome.  Eight years ago, I knew a
bunch of folks who tried to do something about the lack of alternative
radio here, a lack I myself whined about countless times.  Well, they
never did anything, and out of the blue comes the Bear.  While their
format has occasional comedic overtones, like playing "Children of the
Sun" or mid-eighties soft metal, I enjoy hearing songs that aren't on
mainstream playlists for a change.

Wed. 10/5
    COLD GIN at Louie Louie
    There are two Kiss cover bands, and this is one of them.  I don't
know if they wear makeup or are becostumed, but I'm sure if you go,
you'll hear Kiss songs you forgot back in '82.  Of course, that might
have been on purpose.

Thu. 10/6
    Battle of the Bands at the Rockinghorse
    Ever been to one of these?  They can be awful or awfully funny or
good.  If I could afford the $1.50 fountain drinks, like I was served
there recently, I'd go.

Fri. 10/7
    AUTUMN LORDS at The Nick
    Gosh, I can't believe it, but their stage names are sticking.  They
answer to them and everything.  They are all nice fellas and fit the
metal-ish genre.  If you enjoy the company of people who try to look and
live like "rock stars", here's your band.

Sat. 10/8
    SHALLOW/THE TICKS at Zydeco
    Yee Haw!

Sun. 10/9
    Country Night at the Oasis
    ?????

Wed. 10/12
    ##### SHOW OF THE MONTH #####
    THE DICKEYS at The Nick
    GO to this show and you'll have a recharge on your cool-o-meter to
last until December.  I am quite stunned that they are touring and are
gonna play our humble town.

Fri. 10/14
    SHAME IDOLS at The Nick
    Haven't seen them in awhile, but I know they're grrreat.  Also, at
Zydeco it's Col. Bruce Hampton with a new band.  He's a nutty guy.  At
Louie it's the Back Doors, which I think is a Doors coverband.  What is
this with these Tribute Bands?

Sat. 10/15
     Avoid Phish at Oak Mountain Amphitheatre, because your coolness
might never recover; go see anything else, maybe Labrea Stompers at
the Nick or drink homebrew at the Mill and see Roger Moore and Those
Wildcats, not these, THOSE I said.

Thu. 10/20
    ZEN COWBOYS/ALLIGATOR GUN at The Nick
    Zen Cowboys were named one of the best bands in the U.S. by
_Musician_ magazine in a contest.  Thus they decided to reform (they had
changed members and formed a different band) and I think they have a
showcase soon.  Also on the 20th is Henri's Notion at the 22nd St. Jazz
Cafe--Irish music and poetry too.

Fri. 10/21
    STRUTTER at Louie Louie
    I haven't washed out the blood that the Gene Simmons guy spit on my
backpack yet, not out of any sort of homage, but because I'm lazy.
Funny, loud, club-sized Kiss,  with pyro, elevator shoes, proper
grimaces and puckers, even a drum solo and an acoustic "Beth".

Sat. 10/22
    THE PRIMITONS at Zydeco
    Another reunion by the progenitors of the Sugar La La's, and, in my
opinion, a better band.  Hope Don Tinsley is playing bass.

Sun. 10/23
    MICHAEL HEDGES at the Five Points South Music Hall
    Grab yer granola.  I found him to be rather rude when I gave him a
ride from the airport for Center Stage Productions back in 1990, but
he's nevertheless a great, fantastic guitarist.  Ecologically profound,
too.

Thu. 10/27
    SEATTLE at Louie Louie
    I include this because they are a SEATTLE "scene" Tribute Band.
Surely no comment is necessary.

Fri. 10/28
    Don't go out.  Instead, do as I'm planning, and serve fondue while
watching Easy Rider.  Also, this could be a great inspiration for
costumes.  Stock up on candy for impish visitors, make buckets of stage
blood with Karo Syrup and red food coloring, get brain-shaped Jello molds
at Toyss 'R' Us, and make jello shooters.  Prepare for winter, replace
batteries in your smoke alarms.  Whatever.

Sat. 10/29
    SHALLOW/THE TICKS/PHANTOM 5 at The Nick
    Hopefully, you're at some halloween parties.  Plural, yes.  Also
Shallow and us Ticks and Phantom 5 will be at the Nick, lotsa costumes
for sure there.  Don't forget to track down Katherine Tucker Windham this
October!  I've still got to think of a costume... shall I be Bride of
Sulu yet again?

Mon. 10/31
    Zydeco Halloween Party
    Hey, here's one on a Monday!  Dress up some more.  Bye!

    SHOTGUN
    (Song lyrics)                                        Damion Furi
    ################################################################


I've stared down a shotgun,
I managed to survive,
But the man that came to kill,
Didn't make it out alive,

When the cops came,
They said it was murder, self-defense,
I said the man forced my hand,
A cure for his offense,
They took the body away,
Victim of a brawl,
Left me to my conscience,
And the blood on the walls,

It's eight years later,
And I'm feeling no better,
Had nothin' better to do,
So I wrote the dead man's mother a letter,

I said, I'm sorry about your son,
There was really nothin' you could've done,
He was mad and had a gun,
And he gave me no place to run,

His head shattered like a melon,
Fallen to the street,
Blood dripped off the ceiling,
To a standard beat,

And the stains on the walls,
Have never quite gone away,
Your son was a bastard,
He's better off dead,
Though I know you'd be much happier,
If it had been me instead,

    Shotgun,
    Kiss it, make it better,
    Shotgun,
    Kiss it, make it deader,
    Shotgun...shotgun...shotgun...

I've still got the gun,
I've still got the shell,
That sent your crazy fucking son,
Straight to bloody hell,

I signed it most sincerely,
Posted it in haste,

    Shotgun,
    Kiss it, make it better,
    Shotgun,
    Kiss it, make it deader,
    Shotgun...shotgun...shotgun...

    Shotgun,
    Kiss it, make it better,
    Shotgun,
    Kiss it, make it deader,
    Shotgun...shotgun...shotgun...

*RIP* = BBS Software is RIP Graphics capable. You must be using a RIP
compatible term software to view them. RIPTerm or QmodemPro v1.50 are
the only two I know of that support it at this time. RIPTerm is shareware
and can be downloaded from most BBS's. QmodemPro is a commercial product.

The two-letter abbreviations you see on the line below the names of
many of the bbs' in the list signify that they are members of one or
more networks that exchange or echo mail to each other in some organized
fashion.
