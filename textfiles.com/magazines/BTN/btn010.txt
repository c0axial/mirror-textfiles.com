Guest Editorial
By Randy Hilliard

   When Mark offered (requested) that I write the editorial for this
 issue I agreed before finding out that I really had to do something
like write an editorial (I should have known better; I've dealt with
this scoundrel before.) I always thought that editors were these
highly paid, under worked leaches with a severe god complex who sat
around having flunkies (and writers) do everything for them while
they took the credit.
  After I learned of my duties Mark told me "Be very careful on your
delivery."  O.K.  How about this:

  Hyuk! Hyuk! Hyuk!  Well hullo kids....

  Nah, I can do better than that:

  Hello boys and girls.  Welcome to Mr. Rogers neighborhood!  Can you
say "Neato?"  I didn't think so. I wouldn't have said it either.

  Hmmm...  Maybe I can't do better.

  This issue of BTN has followed the standards that the staff of the
BTN have tried so hard to maintain in our previous issues.  In short
it is well written (nah, we ain't prejudiced in our favor),
interesting (we hope), varied (you find a relationship between
burgers & BBS's), late (as always), and best of all; CHEAP!
  In this issue Mark has started his sojourn into our local Bulletin
Boards by visiting The Bus BBS, Chris Mohney has provided an
interesting profile on a local legend (Rocky Rawlins), Chez Stephan
has brought his 'Kitchen' article back with advice on burgers, Barry
Bowden has given us the February calender of local events, and Mark
appears again with his local BBS numbers list.  I had a very
informative 30 meg article I was going to add to it but I figured
that I'd let this editorial take its place instead (could you imagine
30 megs of this drivel?).
  Evidently Mark caught some flack from one of the articles in the
last issue of BTN.  As you read this issue (or any of the others)
please remember that as fledgling writers we are prone to use very
tongue-in-cheek humor; It is not our intent to maliciously offend
anyone.  Please take and read these articles in the spirit in which
they were written.  Even the articles written by Michele Cahoon and
Bubba Flavel were in jest albeit we found later that some had taken
them seriously.  With this in mind enjoy this issue!  If you have
questions or comments about this or any other issue then leave a
message to the author of the article or to Mark Maisel by way of
EZNET.

              EZNET - local PC Board network mail
              Writers' Conference for BTN - the newsletter you are
              now reading

Computers Supported:  IBM & Assorted Clones

Files Available:  variety of shareware and public domain offerings
                  transfers are disabled from 6 pm until midnight

Doors Available:  Card Guppies, Bay Street Bulls, PKX Door, ProDoor

Special Information:  Host and co-author of EZNET

Q. Why did you start your BBS?
A. Curiosity.

Q. What has been your greatest reward from running your BBS?
A. The learning experience dealing with PCs, telecommunications, and
communications in general.

Q. What are your greatest regrets and annoyance associated with running a
   BBS?
A. Maintaining file libraries is the biggest annoyance in running a BBS.
   Another bad one is users who call me with questions on my voice line.

Q. What are your future plans for the BBS?
A. I plan to get EZNET upgraded to handle all versions of PC Board message
   bases and get PC Board 14.0/D running right after that.

Q. What is the funniest thing that has happened on your BBS?
A. I had a new user call in while I was watching.  They followed my
   procedure for online validation and I decided to upgrade them while
   they were online. They got either scared or confused when the BBS,
   appeared to them, to be running automatically without their input and
   they hung up.

Q. What is your favorite hobby/pastime outside of your BBS and computers
   in general?
A. CB radio and playing with my VW rate pretty highly.

Q. What do you think your system offers that might cause someone to
   prefer your board over others?
A. It used to be easy access.  I can't really think of any particulars
   but board traffic has increased steadily anyway.

Q. Why?
A. At one time, the registered users numbered less than 250.  Therefore,
   it was easy to log onto my system at almost any time.  Within the
   last three months, the number of users has doubled.  With only one
   system at home and me tying it up working on EZNET has also made it
   more difficult to get on.  My method of running the board, shutting
   down transfers during peak hours, has caused some ruffled feathers
   but for the most part, it gives users who use the message bases a
   chance to reach an outlet and an EZNET node.  It also increases
   overall activity on the system by doing this.

PRO FILE  by Chris Mohney

The Pro File is a short, half-serious biographical sketch given to
various computer telecommunications personalities around Birmingham.
Victims are selected randomly from a group of names put into the
Notorious Hat.  Anyone who thinks himself brave or witty enough may
petition for admittance to the Hat by leaving E-Mail to me (Chris
Mohney, most boards around town) to that effect.  Anyone who wishes to
suggest more questions or sneakily nominate someone without their
knowledge may take the same route ....

From The Kitchen
by Chez Stephan

Hey Guys and Gals:

Miss me? I know you did.

Anyway, this warm weather we have been having has caused me to pull the
old grill out and do a little outdoor culinary experimenting. As I was
doing this I thought to myself, " Gee, I bet the boys and girls would
sure enjoy this."

So here are some burger recipes for you.

Oh yeah, if you don't want to pull the grill out these will work on the
stove.


Burger number one sign in please:

 Beer Burgers:
              1 1/2 lbs. Ground Chuck
              1 tsp. Salt
              2 tbs. Minced Onion
              3 tbs. Steak Sauce (I prefer Lea & Pearins)
              1/3 cup catsup
              1 tbs. Prepared Mustard
              1/2 tsp. Accent
              1 tbs. Sugar
              1 can of your favorite beer (1/2 can is for the recipe the
                                           other half is for you)

Combine first 3 ingredients and shape into patties. Heat remaining
ingredients in a saucepan until mixture thickens. Grill patties 4 to 6
minutes over a hot fire. Serve on grilled English muffins and top with
beer sauce.


Burger number two sign in please:

 Onion Burgers:
               2 lbs. Ground Chuck
               1 envelope dry onion soup mix
               2 tbs. Water
               3 tbs. Worchestershire Sauce
               1 egg
               8 slices of smoked Cheddar cheese (optional)

Combine all ingredients except cheese. Shape into 1/2 inch thick
patties. Grill over medium-hot fire. Top with cheese slices about 4
minutes before done. Serve on onion rolls.


Burger number three sign in please:

 Sweet and Tangy Burgers:
                         2 lbs. Ground Chuck
                         1/4 cup catsup
                         3 tbs. Molasses
                         2 tbs. Worchestershire Sauce
                         1/2 onion, coarsely chopped
                         1 clove garlic, minced
                         1/4 tsp. Ground Ginger
                         1 tsp. Salt
                         1/2 tsp. Black Pepper
                         1/4 tsp. Cayenne Pepper
                         1/4 tsp. Ground Nutmeg

Combine all ingredients except ground chuck in a blender. Blend well.
Add to ground chuck mixing well. Shape into 8 patties about 1/2 inch
thick. Grill patties over medium fire for 4 to 7 minutes on each side.


I think if you will try these that you will enjoy so have at it and
don't eat to much. You can serve fries or chips or potato salad with any
of these along with some baked beans and PLENTY of cold beer.
