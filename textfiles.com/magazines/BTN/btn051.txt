Publisher's Corner

(After being relieved from the burdensome duties of editing BTN, Mark
had so much time on his hands, he didn't bother writing a Publisher's
Corner.  Well, the guy WAS moving to a new house all month.  Bug him
for a new article, and while you're at it, ask him when the next BTN
party is.  He LOVES that.  - Scott H.)

FROM THE  EDITOR
        ^new
by Scott Hollifield



    My friends, today begins a bold but uncertain new dawn in our shared
history.  Arm in arm, we stand on a teetering precipice, staring
unflinchingly at the future with steel in our eyes and fire in our
hearts.  To those who said we would never make it, I say, "We are here."
For those who say we'll never go further, I say, "Give us a chance."  A
chance, friends.  That's all we ask.  Give us a chance... and I'll show
you miracles.

    Wait a minute.

    What the hell am I talking about?  I'm not running for political
office.  I'm already there!  I've got the power!  And there's not a darn
thing any of you can do about it!

    For those of you whose ears have not yet received the thundering
cry, my name is Scott Hollifield, and yes, I am the new editor of BTN.

    I've been associated with BTN since its inception.  Let me give you
a little bit of background.

    In the early part of 1988, I conducted what was known then as "The
First Annual Breezin' Birmingham BBS Awards Survey".  (Don't ask me to
explain what "Breezin'" means; old users of Channel 8250 will know.)
The survey, which was little more than a (very) glorified opinion poll
about local BBS's, got a lot of attention, and the results of it were
published in the very first issue of BTN, back in April of '88.

    I went on to conduct a second and third annual survey, whose results
were also published in BTN.  Unfortunately, I lost interest and never
made it to a fourth.

    A year ago, I took over the BTN "ProFile" column from Chris Mohney,
who had carried it for three years and was now moving to Tuscaloosa.
Under my disciplined grasp, it managed to last another three months.

    In April of this year, I started a series of columns in BTN called
"Stop On A DYM", a chat-based interview segment with users of Willie's
Dial-Your-Match which was intended to run five months.  It never made it
past the first installment.

    So based on my record, I'm going to skip trying to sell myself as a
committed editor.  The word "commitment" is, in fact, in my dictionary,
but I haven't seen my dictionary since I used it to write term papers in
high school.  I could try to persuade everyone that I am dedicated, that
I truly BELIEVE in making BTN the best thing since microwave ovens, that
I hope to take it another fifty issues and beyond, blah blah blah, but
that would be misleading.

    I can't promise anything.  I can't guarantee that BTN will continue
the same high standards of integrity and professionalism set by Mark
Maisel <ahem>.  All I can say is, keep reading.

    Anyone remember when I conducted the first BBS survey back in 1988?
Remember how everyone just talked and talked about it, for months? Even
though it really wasn't a great big life-shattering deal, it unleashed a
fireball of intrigue and controversy?  My ultimate aim is to make BTN
like that, only monthly.

    I'll need help.  I already have some of it (and thanks to them).
A lot of the writers who wrote for Mark have pledged to keep on writing,
and a couple who've never written before have even said they'd start.
(One of these, who makes his BTN debut this month, is someone I'm glad to
be welcoming back to the local BBS scene: Bernie D. Starchaser, who was
around Way Back When It All Began, and whose name was even mentioned in
the first issue of BTN.  It's true, Bernie!  Go download it and read it!)

    However, you might have noticed that this issue of BTN is pretty
skinny.  If anyone wants to submit an article, which would be greatly
appreciated, please upload it to either Crunchy Frog or The Matrix, as a
PRIVATE upload, and leave me mail telling me what the filename is.
Being a BTN writer is cool.  Being a BTN writer is hip.  You want to be
a BTN writer.

    I will be working in a few subtle, more conventional changes into
BTN, along with the more large-scale clandestine ones I have in the
works.  <Heh heh.>  For instance, the Known BBS Numbers list has been
slightly reorganized, and, as is evident, it's getting messier and
messier.  In the coming months, we may decide to clean it up a bit -
suggestions are welcome.

    That should do it for this month - I would talk some more, but I'm
on a deadline.  Next month: A bigger issue!  (Hopefully.)  Plus - the
official BTN endorsement for President of the United States!  Be here!

-Life On The Lines-

by Bernie D. Starchaser



     I am continually impressed with the advances made in the BBS Scene
since I was a regular, oh so long ago.  It's simply amazing to see
systems boasting 14,000 bps and more, especially when I can remember
2400 bps seeming like virtually instantaneous transmission.  Even more
incredible is The Matrix's gigabytes of storage when I can remember
running my own BBS (such as it was) on two floppies.  Times, they are
a-changin'.

     Now in the old days, back when the now-legendary Fox Trap 80 was
up, BBS systems were simpler.  And yet, they had a certain elegance.
Back then, you didn't have all this high-speed, large-scale technology
so you had to make do with what you DID have.  And as I remember, the
Trap had a very impressive setup for it's day.  There were numerous
message bases, even back before networks.  One in particular which I
miss was the Warboard.

     This was an area simply devoted to what today is known as
"flaming".  Users would enter bald statements to start something, such
as "Motley Crue sucks!"  Then all the "Crue" fans would jump in,
maligning viciously the person posting the offending statement.  Then
others would join in in support of the first.  Later, as this
progressed, still others would pop up wondering what all the fuss was
about, or taking the position that BOTH sides were idiots, or whatever.
We had all sorts.  The "rodents", the regulars, those who took sides
with these and the "devil's advocates" who attacked either side out of
sheer bloody-mindedness.  Ah, those were the days!

     Another element missing from the modern "scene" is the "Continuing
Story" board.  This was a message area where the most outrageous tales
would spring up.  One person would start the story by writing a one
paragraph opening, ending midsentence at a critical point.  The next
caller would pick up where the last left off, ending his or her message
in a similar fashion.  Needless to say, anyone reading the entire thread
would be amazed that apparently intelligent people could come up with
such stark idiocy.  Idiocy it may have been, but it was still funny!

     The Breezin' conference, I'm happy to say, still exists, albeit on
a different board.  Breezin' was a place that those of us bored with the
Warboards sort of drifted to.  The adversarial quality of the
conversation there remained, but on a higher intellectual plane.  And
yet, it was different from such conferences as "argument" on the Frog,
in that the conversation was always sort of light.  Political and
religious discussions just never came up.  Maybe we weren't mature
enough to care about these things, or more likely we were simply more
interested in music.  I dunno...

     Well, as some old hands will remember, I always used to end
messages on Breezin' with a musical or poetic quote.  I think that was a
good tradition, and I shall continue it with any other BTN offerings
that Mr. Hollifield is able to read without gagging.

IT"S GREAT TO BE BACK!

-------------------------------

"It's not as if this barricade,
 Blocks the only road;
 It's not as if you're all alone,
 In wanting to explode;

 Someone set a bad example,
 Made surrender seem alright;
 The act of a noble warrior,
 Who lost the will to fight;

 And now you're trembling on a rocky ledge,
 Staring down into a heartless sea,
 Done with life on a razor's edge,
 Nothing's what you thought it would be;

 All of us get lost in the darkness,
 Dreamers learn to steer by the stars;
 All of us do time in the gutter,
 Dreamers turn to look at the cars;
 (turn around and turn around and turn around)
 Turn around and walk the razor's edge,
 Don't turn your back and slam the door on me

 No hero in your tragedy,
 No daring in your escape,
 No salutes to your surrender,
 Nothing noble in your fate;

 Christ, what have you done???"

                               Traditions

                                   or


                   Why do People do Such Stupid Things?


                                   by

                              Lurch Henson


    Tradition.  What is it?  WHY is it?  What's a Tradition?  A
Tradition is something done long enough or often enough to become either
habit, or required (which soon becomes habit anyway).  That's not the
dictionary definition, that's my definition, I can't afford a
dictionary, so you get to suffer with mine....  Anyway, a Tradition is
something you do, sometimes without really knowing why.  Something that
has "always been done that way", even if it's really stupid.  Most
colleges that have Frats on them will be a great place to learn about
Tradition......IF you like being paddled in your underwear and covered
in oil before being sent out into the woods blindfolded (just an
example, mind you, no one would EVER REALLY do that, right?).  Schools
aren't the only place, either.  You can find Traditions almost anywhere
you look, even if you don't realize that's what you're playing with.

    For instance, my partner and I have quite a few Traditions, some
of which we've kept up, others of which have fallen by the wayside.
Back when I was still working in Lower Alabama and would drive down
there every two weeks to go to work, the first thing I would do would be
to drop in on him and wake him up (he worked nights, slept during the
day). Once he got dressed we'd head out to Taco Bell....make a run for
the border.  Standard order was a 10 pack of tacos apiece.  The girls
working the counter would see us coming through the door, and when we
got to the register, they would already have our seperate orders
totalled up, all we had to do was hand them the cash, then pick up the
food.  How did it start?  He asked me if I felt like going to the new
Taco Bell they'd FINALLY built in the town I kept my P.O. Box in, and I
said yes.  After that, we just naturally headed there, again and again,
until it became habit.  Tradition.  Something we KNEW was going to
happen.  My first meal in Lower Alabama would ALWAYS be a 10 pack of
tacos at Taco Bell, Friday evenings, somewhere between 5 and 8pm
(depending on when I drug my butt out of Birmingham and hit the road),
once every two weeks.  If we didn't show up, the girls asked where we
were the next time one of us came in.  This kept up until I stopped
working in LA, and my trips became very infrequent.  And I miss the
border runs....  It was the time I caught up on everything my ex-wife
was doing in town, stabbing me in the back....the time I caught up on
how our little side business was running....the time we discussed
anything and everything bothering either one of us....and even the time
that I reconciled with a man that had been one of the greatest friends a
guy could have.  A friend of mine that I'd had bad words with, and
missed.  We met at my partner's place one afternoon when I hit town, he
came on the run with us, and at the end of it it was as if the
intervening years had never occured, things were CLOSE to back to normal
between the three of us (The Warriors Three ride again.....).

    Doesn't sound like a Tradition to you?  Tough.  Not everyone has to
like every Tradition, you know.....  Not every one of those guys in
their underwear in the woods are having a good time either, believe it
or not.  But enough of them DO, or enough of them don't dislike it
enough to stop it, so it goes on.  Tradition.

    Ok, don't like my border runs?  Here's another one for you....how
about the BTN parties?  Tradition.  Plain and simple.  Somewhere down
the line Mark had a bout of temporary (maybe?) insanity, and opened his
house up to the general BTN readership.  Then he did it again.  And
again.  And even a few more times.....  When I first started talking to
people online, they asked me if I were going to the BTN party.  Sure,
why not, meet all these people I've been talking to.  Sounds great.  So
I did.  In the past two years I've missed ONE of them, and that was for
personal reasons, not because I couldn't make it (I still showed up at
that one, but not until about 2:30am).  I even drove 200 miles up here
on a weekend I worked in LA, attended the party, then drove 200 miles
back down there to go to work the next day, before returning the day
after that to B'ham for good again (that's when I could afford gas
money).  But then, I'm a little crazier than most.  Most of the people
that do a long haul to get here are only coming from Georgia, or coming
back from Huntsville or Tuscalusa after a trip away from town.  The
point being, after Mark had had a few of these things, they got to be
expected....looked forward to....missed when they didn't happen.  He
started a Tradition, whether he wanted to or not, whether he realized it
or not.

    Since then, there have been other groups on the BBSs that have tried
to start a few Traditions of their own.....which is the main reason for
this article (Ah-HA!  He finally got to IT!).....  I myself have missed
each one of these fledgling Traditions when they've tried to get off the
ground, though I am told that at least one of them went off fairly well.
It seems there was a (non-BTN) roast given somewhere near Christmas, I'm
sure many of you heard about it, some may have gone to it...I would
have, but I was out of town at the time.  At the roast, I'm told that
there was an award presented....something called a POTY award....  When
the weather turned warmer, the same people put together a picnic,
invited alot of the people on the boards out to have fun, and proceeded
to enjoy themselves (for the most part anyway.  I hear some of the
people that left smelling like spoiled cream weren't too happy later in
the day... <<Smile>> ).  The guys that put all of this together have
seperated due to personal differences, but I think it's a step in the
right direction, the establishment of more Traditions here in our BBS
community.  More Traditions that encourage the use of the systems. More
Traditions that draw more Users onto the boards, and show the rest of
the world that not all computer Users are "geeks", that many of us
appear much like normal (I hate that word), everyday people...

    Since then, there has been a second picnic, and a "get-together" at
a coffee shop, each held, one by one, the other by the other, by the
same guys that did the first picnic and roast.  They're doing their
part, trying to provide an enjoyable atmosphere for the rest of us to
play in, how about we do our part and play, eh?  Call around to a few
more BBSs than you planned to this morning....read a few more messages
than you normally would, see what's happening on the systems around
you....you might be surprised at just how far out of the computer these
Traditions can come............and you might just find yourself getting
into some lively discussion....and having a little fun.  See you all
online......

BBS ProFile
by The Bishop

-----------

   As I feel that the spotlighting of certain users and/or sysops
provides a way for the online community to get to know that person
better, I have brought the BTN ProFile back to life.  Originally done by
Chris Mohney, the ProFile ended its first run in December 1991.  The
questions are still the same, but if enough feedback requesting new
ones is received, then the ProFile will be slightly edited(read
"mauled").  However, for the time being, we will start out with someone
I feel is long overdue...    TB
-----------


GODDESS #1/SYSOP PRO FILE: Maggie Harden


Age:  This is one of those trick questions, Right???  To be perfectly
      honest, I generally vacillate between adolescence and old age.
      It depends on the particular phase of the moon, I think.

Birthplace:  In a galaxy far far away ... already been done, huh?
      Alright, I wuz bawn in a cotton patch, thurd chil of poah share-
      croppers ... yeech, makes me sound like Scarlett O'Hara on a
      bad day.  This one's better:  The lightening etched intricate
      patterns across the midnight sky.  Two spectacular bolts seized
      each other, entwining around themselves as they raced for the
      ground.  Created out of the blinding brilliance  of the strike,
      a new Goddess stood fearlessly alone ...
      Ok, Ok, <sigh....>, Birmingham.

Occupation:  I'm not real sure, but I get paid for it!  Has something
      to do with machine shops, reading calipers and silkscreening.

My hobbies include:  Computer bulletin boards (who would'a thought
         it?),  photography, art, swimming, and <snicker> ... a few
         more.

Years telecomputing:  Somewhere between 7 and 8 years.

Sysop & Zoo Keeper, past/present/future of:  The Alter Ego BBS

My oddest habit is:  Hanging around with Saints.

My greatest unfulfilled ambition is:  To take a photograph that is
      Pulitzer Prize material.

The single accomplishment of which I am most proud is:  A nearly perfect
      emulation of my cat Nermal.

My favorite performers are:   Lou Gossett, Glen Close, Mary Chapin
      Carpenter, Jethro Tull and The Moody Blues.

The last good movie I saw was:  Hook

The last good book I read was:  I honestly haven't read a really GOOD
      book lately, but my all time favorite is ILLUSIONS, THE
      ADVENTURES OF A RELUCTANT MESSIAH by Richard Bach.

If they were making a movie of my life, I'd like to see my part played by:
      Whoopie Goldberg.

My pet peeves are:  People younger than me who complain about getting
      old!!!

When nobody's looking, I like to:  Play my air guitar.  I'm really quite
      proficient at it!

BBS Spotlight
    by Eric Hunt


1) Name of the BBS:
        THE ALTER EGO

2) Name of the sysop:
        MAGGIE HARDEN, SYS-GODDESS#1

3) BBS software used:
        PCBoard 14.5

4) How long have you been sysoping:
        I have been Chief Zoo Keeper of the Alter Ego for over two and
        a half years.

5) Are you a subscription only / completely free / hybrid of the two
BBS?
        Totally and absolutely 100% fee free -- and it comes in
        seven yummy flavors!

6) How many incoming phone lines and approximate disk space? Do you
support high speed modems? If so, what type(s)?
        I have one -- count 'em -- ONE incoming phone line.
        My harddisk has just enough space to hold one cup of coffee.
        Yes, I support high speed modems in all endeavors.  I feel they
        should have the same rights as .... oh .... not quite what you
        meant, huh?  I am currently using a Courier HST that supports up
        to 9600 baud.

7) Is your BBS primarily a files BBS, primarily a message based BBS,
or a combination of the two?
        I scoff at files and thumb my nose at them!!!  Files, indeed!
        The Alter Ego is primarily message based BBS geared towards
        blatant insanity.

8) If you've sysop'd more than just this BBS, briefly list previous
endeavours and their lifespans.
        Before starting the Ego, I spent over four years as co-sysop
        of The Connection.  This makes a grand total of about six and
        a half years I have worked in some sort of sysoping capacity.
        Now, some may wonder if this has possibly caused some sort of
        irreversible brain damage.  Nonsense!!!  Hello??? ... this IS
        Pizza Hut Delivery, isn't it???  Hello???

9) What made you decide to take the masochistic plunge and become a
sysop:
        The power!!!  The prestige!!!  The fame!!!  The fortune!!!
        Well, actually there was this time -- way back when I was a
        child -- I tied my cat up in a tree (yes, there WERE trees and
        cats way back then!). I have felt the need for self-flogging
        since that time.
        Then there WAS that time I fed poison pizza to Dean
        Costello .... nah, no guilt on that one!

10) What is the general 'thrust' or area of specialty for your BBS:
        <snicker>  It is HOME for many of the "less than normal".
        The Alter Ego is a strange mixture that runs from serious to hyper-
        silly.  Most of the conferences on the Ego are local, though we do
        carry a few echoed conferences.  Any board is only as strong as the
        users that support it. Consequently, I let my more frequent users
        have considerable input in the direction the board takes.

11) (optional) What is your regular job/career to support this
leeching hobby of sysoping?
        Since pulling off train robberies has gotten to be such a difficult
        business (ever tried to catch an AmTrak on horseback?), I have had
        to resort to real work (sad, but true). I work at a research
        center.

12) What are your plans for the coming year?
        I don't even know what my plans for the coming week are --
        now you want me to plan a year in advance???

13) Where would you like your BBS to go over the next 5 years?
        Frankly, a sailboat cruise to Martinique would be nice.
        Other than that, it will go exactly as it has in the past --
        it will endeavor to make it's users happy and amuse me in the
        process.

14) What do you feel the highlights of your BBS are?
        Most definately my users!!!  Maybe I am biased, but I think I have
        the greatest group of users in the BBS community.

15) What is your personal vision of the 'ideal user?'
        He should stand about 6 foot tall, have blue eyes, look good in
        tight jeans......you just HAD to ask, didn't you?
        Seriously, the "ideal user" is one who feels free to participate
        in the board.  He/she should feel comfortable not only leaving
        messages, but in offering comments, suggestions and even criticism
        when he/she feels it is needed.

16) What is the thing you've enjoyed most about providing your BBS?
        Again, my users.  I have met some of the greatest people I have
        ever known since the Ego started.  I enjoy the interaction we
        have with each other.  It feels like "family" -- sometimes
        deranged family, but family just the same.

18) What is the funniest story you can tell about your BBS and/or
your users?
        Probably all of the polling and politicing by the candidates
        of last years Pervert of the Year (POTY) Contest.

Here's a space to write a paragraph or two to cover any
points/details/questions I missed, yet you feel should be addressed.
        Being a sysop and running a board has got to be fun.  When it
        ceases to be enjoyable and starts to be "work", then it is time to
        sit back and let it roll on it's own merit for a while.  If it is
        a good board and has a good group of users, it will survive while
        you take a breather and regroup.

        I have been fortunate, in that I have two great co-sysops.  The
        only thing left to cover is a great big thanks to both of
        them -- to Saint George for helping me keep this monster on
        line and to Bob Crawford for helping me keep the message
        bases alive.  Thanks guys!!!  I couldn't have done it without
        you!!!
