    THE EDITOR                                      Scott Hollifield
    ################################################################


    You know, I've never gone in for that "summer equals birth, winter
equals death" stuff.

    It makes for some pretty poetry, but it's not really accurate unless
you're a plant.  Our own calendar may end with the onset of winter, but
it begins with it too.  If things die at the approach of night and
winter, then why are winter nights my favorite?  I'm certainly no fan of
death... quite the contrary.  Seeing things in winter is like putting on
a new pair of glasses.  It's feeling cold when our senses are the
sharpest.  And the biggest birthday celebration of the largest religion
in America takes place in December, a holiday which I am always pleased
to celebrate for my own reasons.

    It's with that mood in mind that I am also pleased to present a
slightly reborn BTN.

    You've probably already noticed the cosmetic changes, but there are
other changes beneath the surface which are busy at work, like Santa's
elves.

    We're expanding our staff to provide a wider base of interest.
We've re-thought out a lot of things that make BTN tick, and in the
months ahead, you can be sure that we'll be tinkering with them a bit.
Plus, we're reinforcing our commitment to make sure there's a BTN in
every stocking; in compiling our Known BBS Numbers, we're making the
list and checking it twice, so to speak.

    In short, better service, more substance.

    By example, this month you'll see a brand-new set of submission
guidelines in case you're interested in writing for BTN but don't know
how.  It's easy, it's free, it's sexy.

    We're also finally kicking off our First Annual BTN Art Contest,
whispered about for months now, and I hope we see some responses to
that.

    That's it!  This is short because we're impatient to get things
moving.  Happy non-death-time, and I hope to see you at the party!

    SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

    ################################################################


I. ARTICLE LENGTH

    Right now, there's no strict enforcement of a length restriction,
but if your submission is somewhat short, I may request that you make it
longer.  Anyone can sit down and type out a screen's worth of stuff.  I
have yet to encounter an article that was too *long*, so don't worry
about that.


II. SUBJECT MATTER

    Again, there's no hard-and-fast rules about subject matter.  I'm
interested in seeing material on a wide variety of topics.  That
includes BBSs, politics, music, books, or better yet, something that
doesn't neatly fall into any one category.  Next to that, my favorite
articles are the ones that have something to do with BBSing, since that
is supposedly what we're sort of about.  Technical reviews are also
good.  I tend to kind of frown on fiction, but I'm willing to take a
look at anything you've got.  If it's interesting enough, your chances
are good.
    Politics is fine, but try not to rant--and make whatever you have to
say original.  I can go out and find ten Rush Limbaughs if I want.
    Also refrain from "This Is What Happened To Me Today" slice-of-life
articles unless it's leading somewhere good.
    Reviews should be both informative and opinionated.  Don't be too
objective, but still tell us about what you're reviewing.


III. FILE FORMAT

    Plain and simple ASCII is preferred, but we can convert WordPerfect
files if need be.


IV. STYLE GUIDELINES

1.  Use a right margin of 72 columns.
2.  Indent paragraphs at the fifth column.
3.  Put two spaces after each sentence.
4.  Skip a line after each paragraph.
5.  Refrain from using BBS-specific devices like "<grin>" and ":-)".
6.  Be sure to give your article a title.
7.  Try to use correct grammar, spelling and capitalization!  My staff
    proofread as best as we can, but a well-typed article makes our job
    easier.
8.  The dash is correctly typed as two hyphens, like "--".  Use it to
    set apart phrases and clauses--as with this sentence.
9.  To emphasize a word, place a pair of asterisks around it, like
    *this*.  This takes the place of italics (except for titles; see
    12).
10. If you have to emphasize a group of words, use capitals, AS IN THIS
    EXAMPLE.  I generally don't like the way that looks, so use it
    sparingly, if at all.
11. If you're unsure whether to spell out a number or not, leave it in
    numeral form.
12. Titles of books, films, plays, albums and works of art are
    surrounded by underlines, like: U2's _The Joshua Tree_.  This takes
    the place of italics in this regard; I call it "title-cizing".
    On the other hand, television shows, songs, poems, article titles
    and short stories are surrounded by quotation marks.


V. HOW DO I SUBMIT AN ARTICLE?

    The easiest way is to upload it as a private file on one of two
systems: The Matrix and the Crunchy Frog.  (Their phone numbers are
listed at the end of this feature.)  To upload a file privately, begin
your file description with a slash ("/").  Then leave me (SCOTT
HOLLIFIELD) a private message telling me what the file name is, so that
I can have the sysop make it available for me.
    Another way is to leave me the article as a private message, or a
series of private messages.
    If you become a regular contributor to BTN, you can get access to
the private BTNWA conference, which is for BTN writers.  There we
discuss articles, policy, ideas, etc.  The BTNWA conference also
contains a private file directory which I can access more easily than a
private file outside BTNWA.

    That's it!

    Get to work!

    LETTERS TO
    THE EDITOR                                      From BTN Readers
    ################################################################



From: DAVID LARUSSA
BBS:  The Matrix

Dear BTN,
    I am slowly becoming a regular reader of your newsletter.  I would
like to say how much I have enjoyed it, and admire the dedication of the
guys behind it.  This newsletter is an important part of the BBS
community, or should I say BBS culture.  It gives this virtual world
some badly needed solidity.
    Here are some suggestions for articles:
    I like the interviews with people. How about interviewing the sysops
of some boards.  I know you guys have probably heard each other's
stories, but I would like to hear them too.
    Please!  No more political commentary.  It's boring and in no way
could it be labeled as telecommunication news.  The world needs no more
Rush Limbaugh clones.
    How about some articles on hardware and software?  The possibilities
here are endless.
    Experiences people have had are also enjoyable to read.
    What is it like being young, old, female, or handicapped?  I am sure
these people have a unique perspective to share.  I would like to hear
it.

                      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

FROM: Rocky Rawlins
BBS:  The Matrix

[NOTE: Rocky is the sysop of The Matrix.  This letter was written in
response to issue #62's "The Last Hegemony (Part 2)" by Christopher
Mohney.]

    Chris, while I know your article was tongue-in-cheek, I felt I
should reply to it to over this particular issue.  This issue is one
that I had always felt rather strongly about.

    First, let me clear up one point that many people already know but a
good number of new folks may not.  The MATRIX (like most BBS's) has run
at a net operating loss every year since its inception.  Last year our
corporate tax return showed a $7000 net operating loss.  Despite the
well-known myth that all sysops make lots of money by running a BBS, the
average salary for Birmingham sysops is about -$.50/hour.  Our recent
rather controversial rate increase was done in an attempt to provide
funding for the many new and expensive services that people want.

    Now to my primary concern.  The entire issue of censorship,
community standards, adult contents of messages and files is or should
be of concern to every single individual who operates or uses a BBS,
online system, or any other type of electronic communications.

    The principles of privacy and freedom of speech are firmly rooted
in the constitution of the United States, and have been upheld from the
lowest courts all the way up to the Supreme Court of the United States.
These protections are extended to telephone conversations, postal mail,
and just about every form of communications.  The Electronic Communi-
cations Act of 1992 seems to extend these same protections to *all*
electronic communications.  *However*, many states feel free to
interpret the definition of "electronic communications" in different
ways.  Even the federal government seems to have problems deciding
exactly what they are.

    The incident with Steve Jackson Games where the Secret Service
seized the BBS and computer network at a games publisher is a good case
in point.  The BBS was seized because of alleged criminal activity by
one of its users.  A warrant was issued to seize it to capture the
evidence, and the Secret Service in a dawn raid did exactly that,
seizing the entire computer network at the company including all of
their publishing projects.  What ultimately came out in court during
Steve Jackson's lawsuit against the Secret Service was that the Secret
Service did *not* have warrants to seize the electronic communications
of the hundreds of *outher* users on the system, which they not only
seized by physically removing the system, but spent weeks looking
through for possible criminal activity in violation of search and
seizure laws.  They were also prohibited by federal law from seizing
"works in progress" from a publisher.  That is one of the oldest
principles of law in the United States.  But because the Secret Service
decided not to view electronic media as "real" works, they simply
ignored one of the oldest principles of United States law protecting
freedom of the press.  When these facts were brought out in court
during the trial, the judge lost his temper and actually yelled at the
Secret Service defense attorneys in outrage at their actions.  And these
are some of the people tasked with enforcing federal law.  (By the way,
the Secret Service lost the case and paid damages not only to Steve
Jackson Games but to the individuals whose messages were seized.)

    In the state of Alabama, we have the *only* attorney general in the
United States who has attempted to (and succeeded) in banning satellite
broadcasts of which he did not approve.  This is unprecedented in the
history of this country to my knowledge, and to me, it says that this
man puts his personal political ambitions and prejudices ahead of
technological advancement in this state.  Whatever you may think of the
Playboy Channel, when you abrogate *your* right to make choices to
someone like Jimmy Evans, you have willingly given up your right to
free speech.

    The issue of freedom of speech in the electronic world is still a
new one and many people as well as many of the courts have not made up
their mind about the issues involved.  Does an electronic message enjoy
the same legal status as a postal letter?  Is it *still* a protected
communication if it is public?  Is it still protected *after* you have
read it and it is sitting here on your drive?  If you embed a file in
your message, is the file protected like the words you type?  If you
send an illegal message who is responsible for it?  You, us, anyone who
reads it, every system it passes through?  If you send a message that is
legal in *our* state but is illegal in Georgia, who broke the law?  You,
us, the systems it passed through, the system holding the message at
destination?

    These are just a few of the issues that have yet to be resolved
with some definitive ruling.

    If someone decides that *we* are responsible for the content of
messages that pass through our system, then that means that we
personally would have to read and approve every message you leave.  Do
you really want us reading and passing judgement on your personal and
business messages like Prodigy does?  Who in their right mind would use
electronic communications for business or really personal communications
knowing that someone else was censoring their messages?  Would you use
the telephone if you knew that an operator was always monitoring your
conversations or the mail if you knew every letter would be opened and
read before delivery?

    The local TV stations make a big deal out of dirty pictures and
sexual matters but the issue doesn't change.  When was the last time the
phone company was attacked because people use it for obscene phone
calls?  In an obscene phone call, an individual is misusing a technology
but does that lead to a condemnation of the technology and telephone
operators?  Does obscene material sent through the mail result in an
attack on postal employees and the postal system?  Of course not.  The
idea is ludicrous.  Yet similar misuse of BBS technology leads to an open
global condemnation of BBS and the people who operate them.

    We have been trying for a year to get some kind of definitive
ruling from the Alabama attorney general or the district attorney on
some of these issues and have met a complete stone wall.

    The ironic thing (and what bothers me about your article) is that
it is not *our* problem.  It is *your* problem, Chris, yours and
everyone else who uses a BBS.

    *You'll* be the loser Chris.  *You* will no longer be able to
communicate privately electronically.  *You* will have your articles
subject to seizure and prior restraint because electronic publishing is
not "real" publishing.  *You're* the one who will suddenly be limited to
using Compuserve with its sky-high prices and department of lawyers to
defend themselves from people like Jimmy Evans.  And if Jimmy Evans
should act against them and win in court as he did against a satellite
company, then Compuserve would simply cut off service to Alabama.  No
skin off their nose.

    Chris, I don't think you realize or fully understand the issues at
stake here.  Georgia, in response to similar TV stories there, passed
state laws that make it a felony to discuss, distribute, or even mention
the issue of sexual matters on *any* type off electronic communications.
Any message that you send to a BBS in Georgia that refers to sexual
matters is now a felony.  If you respond on The MATRIX to a message from
someone in Georgia asking where they can find Adult discussion
conferences Chris, *you* have committed a Felony under Georgia state law
and could conceiveably be arrested and prosecuted if you entered the
state of Georgia, or even extradited from Alabama to Georgia to face
trial there.  Farfetched you say?  The laws provide the mechanisms; and
remember who the Attorney General of Alabama is?

    I'm not particularly worried about the existance of The MATRIX in
the long run.  If the courts (or Jimmy Evans) decides that *we* are
responsible for the content of *every* message that appears on or passes
through The MATRIX, then we'll simply close the system down (as would
most BBS operators), refund any outstanding subscriptions, and I'll
spend all my sudden free time and spare cash building a wood shop in the
basement, and I'll do my private communications by legally protected
telephone or postal mail.

    Frankly Chris I've become rather discouraged over the response in
the BBS user community to this issue.  Of over four thousand users on
The MATRIX, and who knows how many more users on other BBS's, about one
hundred showed up to protest at Channel 13.  Is the community really
that unconcerned with the issue?  Is it just that people don't give a
damn and are willing to let someone like Jimmy Evans and Channel 13 make
their decisions for them?  Sometimes it appears so.

    Once upon a time I worked for causes.  I picketed, I protested, I
*fought* for what I believed in.  Maybe that's old fashioned and is out
of style.  Maybe this generation doesn't believe in "principles"
anymore.  I'm getting older now, and have a family that takes up much of
my time.  I have a wife that I want to spend time with, kids that I want
know better before they move away.  There are a lot of books I have
always wanted to read that I *intend* to read before I die, a lot of
things I haven't had time for that I intend to do.

    I can raise issues, but I can't lead battles for them anymore.  I'm
too old, worn out, and tired to be a knight in shining armor.  These
days, wounds hurt more and take longer to heal.  Worse is that no one
seems to care whether the battle is fought at all, much less who wins
it.  That is the saddest thing of all.

    Articles like yours that jokingly or seriously make these issues
out to be somthing that I and other BBS operators are concerned with at
the expense of users make me wonder whether to even bother.  If *you're*
not concerned about the issue, why should I be?  It's not *my* fight,
Chris.  It's *yours*.  If you don't care to fight it, I'm certainly not
going to force you.  We've seriously considered here whether to just
delete any controversial material, since no one seems to much care about
the issue, and I can't see being a sacrificial lamb over an issue that
is of no importance to anyone.

    FIRST ANNUAL
    BTN ART
    CONTEST                                     Rules by Mark Maisel
    ################################################################


    It is with great pleasure that I announce the First Annual BTN Art
Contest.  It purpose is twofold.  First, it provides an outlet for the
visually creative.  Second, it provides a good advertisement for BTN.

    We have come to realize that not everyone is familiar with BTN and
that some publicity may be due.  To that end, an art contest in two
formats will be held.  The common theme of the entries is to be BTN, its
promotion, etc.  Art in standard ANSI and the new RIP graphics format
will be accepted.

    Winners in the ANSI format and RIP format will be selected by a
panel of judges.  The winning ads will be displayed in the news or other
prominent place on cooperating bbs' about town.

    Rules (such as they are)

1. The contest is open to anyone who can use an ANSI or RIP editor to
   create original graphic art.

2. Obscene or offensive graphics and text will be disallowed.

3. The discretion of the judges shall be final.

4. The winning submissions will become the property of BTN.

5. The contest will run from December 1, 1993 through January 14, 1994.
   This is to allow both sufficient time for submissions and for BTN to
   publish the winning submissions in the February 1994 issue.

6. For ANSI submissions, all viewable characters in the IBM character
   set are allowed as is use of color.  Submissions must be in 80 x 25
   character text mode and not exceed 24 lines in length.  This is to
   insure that the submissions may be viewed in a single screen.

7.  For RIP submissions, color graphics compatible with the RIP format
    are accepted provided that they do not exceed a single screen when
    displayed.

8.  All artwork must be original and created by the person submitting
    it.  Cooperative efforts are allowed but all parties involved must
    be named.

    I wish you all the best of luck!  Be creative and get those
submissions rolling in soon.  Have us drowning in them!


[Ed.: Please send your submissions as a private upload, mentioning the
contest in the file description, to The Matrix or Crunchy Frog; or
send it as a private message to MARK MAISEL on either of those boards.]

    BTN, Take... Three?                                Dean Costello
    ################################################################


    Every so often I think about why I write.  I mean, sometimes I get
feelings in my soul that say if I don't write, I will simply explode on
the spot, or at least throw a blood clot and lose control over such
bodily functions as drool containment.

    But why do I write?  Excitement, probably.  You know: the magic, the
joy, the machismo, the chicks, the leather, but mostly the excitement.
I will be wandering through yet another airline terminal somewhere, and
I will notice Something Neat, begin to smile, and proceed to mentally
lash together a good article.  Sometimes it will be the surly
individuals at the metal detectors.  (I have wondered if the continuous
exposure to x-rays rots the medulla oblongata, since every one of those
little devils, be it Tri-City Airport in Tennessee, or Pensacola
Airport, or New Haven Airport, has the precise same expression; a mix of
frustration with one's lot in life, disdain for those that pass through
their portals, and the maniacal joy of being able to pick any one person
out of the crowd for pointless harassment; these emotions are all
controlled by the medulla oblongata, you know.)  Sometimes it will be
that the rubber bands on the handrests of the escalators move a little
bit more slowly than the stairs.  Sometimes it will be amazement on how
much food in airport costs.

    The thing is, whenever I come up with one of these observations, I
am forced to tell someone.  The problem occurs when I don't have anyone
or anything handy to tell it to, and the Somethings Neat start to back
up.  As a result, when I haven't spoken to an individual in a while, I
usually conduct a 15-minute monologue to get up-to-date.

    Events like this happened tonight.  I was watching "60 Minutes", and
they were interviewing Dave Berry.  I'm personally not a big fan, since
the magic of humor like "The Ten Father Commandments" is somewhat lost
on me.  ("1. I am not a sitcom Dad.  I am not stupid, and I always
remember to turn the gas stove off when the pilot light goes out.  2. If
my offspring is male, I will live vicariously through you.  3. If my
offspring is female, I will live vicariously through you.  4. If you
are pretty good at Little League when you are ten, I will buy you a car
when you are sixteen (see Commandments 2 and 3)", etc.)
    Anyway, a couple of things that were said got me to thinking about
why I write, and I have narrowed it down to two things:

     1.  The excitement, chicks, leather, etc. as described above.
     2.  Icky things.

    Icky things run the gamut from thinking about how the country is
spinning to the right so hard I've had a sore neck from political
whiplash, to thinking about my dead grandfather and how my brother has
turned in to a schmoe over the last couple of years.

    I somewhat disregarded the second reason for writing for many years,
since it struck me as a silly and simplistic reason for writing.  (Mark
Maisel once told me that the best writing I do is when I am disturbed or
upset.  Unfortunately, that kind of writing is very emotionally taxing,
as well as sometimes, umm, "erratic" in quality.)  But as I view the
reasons for writing tonight, and the last bunch of articles I've
written, he may have a point.

    The thing is is that my life has been pretty much "normal" as of
late.  When I say normal, I mean uneventful for the most part; no major
emotional traumas to speak of, a couple of reconciliations, one or two
separations; more or less maintaining an even strain.  But over the last
couple of months, things seem to have gone downhill in a big, big hurry,
relatively speaking, thus generating a faint need to write, but the
impetus to write in this particular forum has been lacking.

    To be frank, I didn't really want to be associated with BTN.  For
whatever reason, when Scott Hollifield took over BTN about a year or so
ago, the perceived quality of the publication has gone to hell in a
fairly large handbasket.  The people that were writing for BTN during
this time were by-and-large poor writers (I was debating using the word
"hack" to describe many writers, but the word "hacks" implies a basic
competence), with only the faintest grasp of the basic concepts of
grammar and/or lacking the fundamental ability to get information across
to people.  I feel that I write better than most people.  I now write
(technically) for a living.  I simply didn't want to be tarred with the
brand "BTN" while it consisted of a "staff" of crappy writers, an
editorial group which gives new definition to hands-off management, but
with a more-or-less widespread distribution.

    Scott is in the process of instituting long-delayed changes which I
think will be for the better.  We shall see how it turns out. However,
just prioritizing BTN higher than a mail packet from interminable "Star
Trek" conferences which key on Important Questions of Our Time, such as
why Data uses contractions when he's not supposed to, will probably go a
long way to making BTN a better periodical.

    Or so I thought.  In conversation with Scott in the not so distant
past, he implied that the changes I have been hoping for may be a bit
far-reaching at this time.  He apparently is keying on such things as
aesthetics as opposed to content at the moment.  There are plans to even
improve content over time, by generating a writer's guide, attracting a
"new breed" of writer, as well as soliciting new topics, and more
emphasis on the actual editing process, including getting a proofreader
to look over each issue before it hits the streets and making a
concerted effort to improve the quality of writing that is commonly
available.  [Ed.: Just for that, I'm not going to make that sentence any
more readable.]

    Well, hope does spring eternal, and maybe, with a little luck, and
perhaps some leadership for a change, we may see writers that are capable
of using such advanced concepts as the indirect object.  We shall see
how Scott makes out with his changes.  So, for the meantime, it looks
like I am writing here again.

Res ipsa loquitor.

    THE LAST HEGEMONY:
    AN INFORMATION AGE COSMOLOGY
    Part 3: The Ant Farm                          Christopher Mohney
    ################################################################



                      The author has disappeared;
                    God and man died a common death.

                           - Michel Foucault



    Probably the most influential force of the last five to ten years
of the Information Age (and that influence shows no signs of
diminishing) is that collection of data exchange networks known as the
Internet.  For the purposes of this article, I designate the Internet as
that collection of systems which are essentially free, including but not
limited to academic and government networks and excluding info-
conglomerates like Compuserve and Prodigy.  It is somewhat difficult to
nail the Internet down, as (quite rightly) it is more often thought of
as a road than a destination.

    Still, what's the big deal?  What's so different about Internet that
makes it any different than a big-dog version of the nets and systems
discussed earlier in this essay?  The answer: not much.  Internet is
much more interesting in its effects on still other, ancillary
Information Age phenomena than as a force in itself.  Certainly it
carries great meaning, as it has the best chance of eventually evolving
into a worldwide "centralized" information network.  Its lack of clear
boundaries, its polymorphous nature and absorptive tendencies are its
strengths.  The appearance of some kind of Internet would seem
inevitable, given the geometrically increasing demand for telelectronic
access.

    However, there is a difference.  Previously, the systems and system
operators discussed were concerned with information as currency.
Someone clearly benefiting from access could be found at any particular
point where information was stored.  But the Internet is not a
repository; it is a network linking repositories together.  Who is the
system operator of Internet?  Most everyone is, of course.  The
governance of Internet is the work of a vast bureaucracy so diaphanous
and convoluted that any kind of centralized power structure is
unthinkable.  Each node or collection of nodes is almost a kingdom in
itself, with complete sovereignty and freedom to secede.  They are free
to refuse passage to and in most cases alter any information that passes
through their domain.  This feudal structure is repeated in an atomic
fashion; a holistic analysis of the Internet will show the feudal model
repeating on almost every level until the sheer, overwhelming, global
number of voices belonging to competing sovereign nodes dissolves into
one colossal blast of binary static.  Viewed in this light, the Internet
is a mindless bureaucracy that exists only to perpetuate itself.

    Of course, could it be any other way?  Once again, humanity is
confronted with technological advances that have far outstripped our
ability to erect new ethnological constructs to contain them.  In a
sense, the Internet is becoming the ideal Machiavellian state, endlessly
perpetuating itself mindlessly; yet, a headless State never has to fear
being decapitated, and as its mass is for all purposes indestructible by
virtue of its sheer size, the headless telelectronic State becomes
functionally immortal.

    This leads to a questioning of the Internet similar to the question
posed in Part 1.  One could write dozens of volumes of what the Internet
*is*, but the question we are asking here is what does the Internet
*mean*?  What effect has it had, besides the obvious and well-belabored
benefits of increased access and near-limitless information storage and
retrieval?

    Much like the effect of the BBS on the atomic level, the Internet
means that we have to re-examine certain premises that are basic to how
we function as a society.  Technology is forcing us to admit, tardily,
that concepts we take for granted as static can be little more than
artificial templates that are poorly suited for much further use.  Many
people who might fit the models presented in Part 2 are only too happy
to make use of the Internet, since they may see it as a tool valuable to
whatever ends they pursue.  But make no mistake-- nowhere is the idea
of the "user" more ironic than on the Internet.  Unbeknownst to most of
the telelectronic feudal lords who "use" it, the Internet by its very
self-perpetuating nature is actually "using" them, and if the Internet
continues its logical evolution it can do no less than completely
annihilate the feudal niches that have become so comfortable for so
many.  What keeps a feudal system going is the enforceable idea of
property, and this is no different in the feudal telelectronic
community.  As long as information can be gauged and quantified as
property, telelectronic feudalism can survive.  It would be foolish to
ignore, however, that the laxity of the regulation of information as
property is almost directly proportional to the growth and perpetuation
of information networks; this should be readily apparent, as the two
factors are related so intimately now that it is difficult to determine
which is actually causing the other.  Regardless, as long as one
increases, so will the other.  The reasonable end of this double growth
is complete freedom of information coupled with an omnipresent Internet,
either of which leads to the dissolution of the feudal model and the
dislocation of those at home within it.

    Society is very nervous about this.  Property is the physical
manifestation of capital, which is the basis of our global capitalist
system.  Should information become, in an almost Marxist move,
universally distributed (a possibility much more likely than universal
capital) all those who have benefited from the former arrangement will
have their socio-economic rug pulled out from under them.  As the idea
of property evaporates, so does the idea of the owner, even the idea of
the author.  Consider the complex social construct of the "owner" and
the seemingly endless trouble we have when we try to import this idea
into the Information Age, imprinting ownership or authorship on an
abstraction that by its very nature battles against such an imprinting.

    The significance of these possibilities cannot be overstated.
Pandering to economics and philosophies that do not work, retreating
into safe havens for fear of the sure trouble that change brings will
only cause that change to be all the more painful.  Even in the most
technologically advanced and well-educated countries on the planet, the
main run of the population has only a fearful and shamanistic
relationship to the technology that is shaping their lives and will
determine the futures of their children.  If we expect to reap any
ultimate benefit from this sociological free-play we must be ready to
adapt and adapt quickly, or else suffer the consequences of our stubborn
backward glances.

    "DEAR JAN"
    A Glimpse at
    The Matrix's "Chat Goddess"                          Jeff Vaughn
    ################################################################


    In June 1993, a new face appeared on The Matrix by the name of
Jan Murphree.  Jan's husband Chris brought home some computers from
his job on occasion, and Jan decided to start tinkering with them.  The
computers were the begining of a BBS addict's usual rolling thunder, and
the modem set things into full-blown locomotion.  Jan had no earthly
idea that it would become somewhat of a homebound career in less than
four months time.

    On the 15th of June, Jan logged in under her husband's account and
went "where she had never been before".  It wasn't the final frontier,
but it definately qualified as undiscovered country.  On the first few
logons, Jan discovered "chat", and probably had no idea this would be
her ticket to being a "SysGoddess" (or demi-SysGoddess in the terms of
those divine ones).  In less than a week, she was completely hooked
(indeed, this is an understatment).  Jan was calling, chatting, and
writing e-mail like a typical BBS addict.  Jan wasn't an online games
devotee like many addicts usually are, but she practically lived in The
Matrix's chat lines.

    Around the middle of August, Jan finally broke down and bought a
"ginormous" (my word, not a misspelling) hunk of time on The Matrix.
Jan broke the old check book and bought 250 hours (yes, before the rates
increased), probably another all-time record in The Matrix's history
book.  Chatting was in her blood now, and there just wasn't enough time
in her husband's account to feed the chat addiction.  I'm sure Chris was
definately relieved to hear about that.  Thanks to Jan's charisma and
plain all-around fun attitude (no need for any butt-kissing, we're buds
already), she made a ton of friends in a very short time, Rocky Rawlins
and Tom Egan being among the large group.  The group is still steadily
growing.

    It seems that Jan made a lasting impression on our two local
SysGods because Tom suggested that she become a sysop a few months
later.  "Dear Jan's" chat line (channel 7) was implemented on October
1 of this year.  Being a person who frequently chats with Jan, I can
say it was a definately a hit.  Sometimes I had to wait in line to get a
word in edgewise. I finally decided to sit on another channel and talk
with my usual group of individuals while swapping private messages with
Jan until the crowd died down.  It was a long wait, sometimes it was 2
a.m. before Jan dropped in.

    On October 15th of this year, Jan became a full-fledged sysop.  She
was decreed the "Chat Sysop", but a sysop nonetheless, and in record
time for any sysop on The Matrix.  Jan also got a few extras on the job.
Her initial job was to oversee the chat lines and invoke her divine
wisdom when and wherever required.  (She's gonna get me for that.)
Along the way, Jan picked up a few more responsibilities.  She became
Matrix's official "welcome wagon", and the voice validator for the new
users.  There was something in there about a woman being better for the
job and I decided not to question it since she was doing such an
incredible job.  Jan's batting average on the Matrix definately spoke
for itself as far as qualifications went.

    Two days later, Jan struck again.  Even though her work load was
enourmous with all the back-logged call verification, a lightbulb
popped on in her head, and she came up with another idea, the BBS
Addicts conference (#17).  Even with the small group the conference
started out with, the messages began flowing in.  Some ideas for the
conference are still up in the air, and Jan's always looking for new
addicts.  The general idea behind the conference was for a group of
people who loved the modem to get together and just chew the fat (or
whatever BBS addicts chew on).

    As we all know, curiosity sometimes gets the better of us, so Jan
decided to work up an annual event for all the BBS addicts where they
can all get together and meet.  Right now, it's being held every six
months, but I have the feeling that this might become an even more
frequent event than even Jan knows.  Only time will tell.  The first one
is being held at Ryan's on the 14th of November, but depending on when
this issue of BTN gets out, the expression might be "was held on the
14th of November".  Jan and I generally work these things out and it
will be rotated to different areas (just to be fair) for the BBS
addicts who are "way out".

    I was sitting there minding my own business, smoking a cigarette
after dinner, watching CNN Headline News.  The world, CNN assures me,
is falling apart on schedule, President Clinton leading the way.

    The kids were outside playing, and Virginia and I were discussing
Bob Dole and the possibility that Congress will pass an amendment to
require the President to get congressional approval before making any
military moves.  We agreed with each other that any such amendment would
de-ball whatever power remains to the Executive office.

   And, as usual, the kids were popping in, making noise, getting
chewed out for it and hastily leaving again.  The news was of no
interest to them.

   At one point, however, Brenda came in complaining about grass in her
hair.  Virginia asked her what she had been doing.

   "Playing 'Drive-By,'" Brenda replied, with 11-year-old glee.

   Virginia and I just glanced at each other, and I could see Virginia
repress a shudder.

   "What is that?" Virginia asked carefully, her voice carefully devoid
of any particular emphasis.

   "Well, you know what a drive-by is, Mom," Brenda said, grinning.
"Somebody in a car drives by and shoots somebody.  We were, um, doing
cartwheels and, um, rolling in the grass and practicing our, um, death
scenes."

   Poor kid.

    LIFE ON THE LINES
                                                   Bernie Starchaser
    ################################################################


    Greetings to all!  Yes, I have decided to revive Life On The Lines,
a look at BBSing today from the point of view of an old hand who
remembers what it was like when 300 BPS was not just a good idea, it was
the *law*!

    As I have thought about what I might discuss in this revival, a
nagging little item has been bouncing around my head, so I decided to
just go with it.  Here goes...


BBS ETIQUETTE, OR THE LACK THEREOF

    All right, I think it's safe to assume that most people who have
sense enough to buy a computer, install a modem, get their COMM software
configured, find a BBS number, get logged on and read and post messages
would have to be fairly intelligent.  That established, why oh why do I
keep seeing a complete lack of social graces in the conferences?  I'm
not talking about the little wisecracks you see with an emoticon by
them, those are obviously tongue-in-cheek.  I'm talking about people
simply spouting off at the keyboard with no consideration for the rights
or feelings of whomever may read their drivel.  THIS HAS GOT TO STOP!

    Look folks, I'll be the first to admit that the guilty parties do
not by any means represent a majority, or even a small minority, of BBS
users as a whole.  Indeed, they probably aren't more than the bottom one
percent of the bottom one percent, but they still stick out like a sore
thumb and do nothing *whatsoever* to enhance the image of BBS's or
BBS'ers in the eyes of the common people.  People *do* tend to remember
the worst parts of an experience longer than any other aspect.  What
sort of image are we sending out?

    The sort of thing I'm talking about usually takes the form of some
individual who is convinced of their own intellectual/moral/political
superiority, who belittles and degrades those who do not agree with him
or her unmercifully, without bothering to back up their own positions
with logic or reason.  Ladies and gentlemen, intelligent people do not
need to resort to name-calling to make their points, just in case you
hadn't heard.  Also, it may not have occurred to you that your own
positions would carry a *lot* more weight if you backed them up with
logic, rather than simply demeaning those who don't see it your way.

    I don't believe you'd talk that way in a face-to-face meeting.  As
I said, most of us are obviously intelligent beings.  We recognize and
observe certain rules of social behavior when we gather.  So what's a
BBS besides the biggest gathering place in town?  Why can't those same
rules apply to the boards?

    I know I'm carrying on a bit, but I'm really incensed about this,
and maybe a little disappointed.  And I want to reiterate that I am not
broadcasting this to the general BBS populace.  The guilty parties know
who they are, as do most of us.  I'm not going to name names or
conferences.  I merely want to put out a general call to all: please
exercise the same sort of decorum on a BBS as you would when you were a
guest in home.  And for those who cannot find it in themselves to do
this simple thing, all the rest of us should just ignore these boorish
malcontents and enjoy ourselves in spite of them.

    I've said enough.

    CAFE SPOTLIGHT:

    ################################################################


                           G.G.'s In The Park
                           3625 8th Ave. So.
                          254-3506 -- 254-9052
                        Seafood, Steak & Lobster
                        Your Host: Frank Brocato


    G.G.'s has got to be one of my all time favorite places to eat.
You can count on the food being very good, and the service is the same.

    For a period of time, G.G.'s was owned and operated by someone other
than the original owners.  Now back in the hands of the original owners,
the food, portions, and service are back to where they used to be.

    One of the first things you'll see when entering GG's is a tank of
live Maine lobsters.  It is these lobsters that GG's has become famous
for.  While other restaurants attempt to reduce overhead by offering
Florida lobsters, GG's continues a long tradition of offering the
freshest live Maine lobster.  Make no mistake, there is a difference.
The Maine lobster, having spent its life in the cold waters off New
England, has a much better taste than Florida lobsters do.  There is a
vast difference in price too.  The menu at GG's has "Market" in the
price column for the lobster, so be sure and ask the price before you
order.

    The appetizers on the menu are the best selection you'll find
anywhere, from escargot to fried apple wedges with cinnamon and ice
cream.  Although not on the appetizers menu, I selected a cup of seafood
gumbo ($2.95).  The gumbo is good, but not as good as what I've had in
the past.

    For the main course I chose fried, large gulf shrimp ($12.95).
These are undoubtedly the best shrimp I have tried anywhere.  They
are jumbo select shrimp, which means simply that they are so large
that they have to be split down the middle and then battered and fried.
The shrimp dinner can also be ordered broiled.

    All seafood dinners come served with French onion soup, farm fresh
combination salad, baked potato, and fresh homemade yeast rolls.  These
rolls rank as the best anywhere.  And the French onion soup?  I guess
you have to be a fan of onion soup, which I'm not, so I won't offer an
opinion on it.  I will say that since it does come with the meal, I did
sample it.

    For beverages, GG's offers all the soft drinks you'd find elsewhere.
You can also order your favorite cocktail from your waiter/waitress.
GG's has one of the finest wine lists available in this city.  This is
no joke.  I have seen wine lists from several restaurants in this city,
and none compare to GG's.  From $5.95 for a half carafe, to $160.00 a
bottle, you'll not find a finer wine list anywhere.

    If you arrive at a crowded time, you may wish to relax in the bar.
You can order your favorite beverage, or merely watch the current
sporting event on television while waiting for a table. It may be a
good idea to call for reservations if you plan to dine on a weekend
where there is a game at Legion Field.  GG's usually fills up rather
quickly after a game.

    Don't forget your dessert (if you still have room).  Known for their
homemade Black Bottom Pie, made with real whipped cream, GG's serves a
mouth watering list of desserts.  The pies are all $2.95 a slice.  So
take some time to indulge yourself in a very good piece of pie.

    With all of the items on the menu, GG's may be considered a little
pricy.  GG's may not be for the every-night diner.  But it is certainly
a restaurant for that special occasion.  If you need a restaurant for an
important business meeting, a very special date, or one that will simply
offer you a wide array of good food, then GG's will fit the occasion.

Wednesday December 1
    X at The Nick
    Well, they cancelled.  I just wanted to include that fact.  And,
since I suspect it would have been an embarassing show, I'm kinda
relieved.  After Nirvana/Breeders tonight, I'm sure I would have just
rolled over there and blown alot of money, because I have great love and
respect for older X material, but there's no way I'd get much more for
my money than to touch Exene's hem and wish Billy Zoom were around.
John Doe's no slacker either, neither D.J. Bonebrake, but I think
Exene's solo work is better than X's current slush.

Friday December 3
    24TH CENTURY QUAKERS at The Nick
    Reminds me of the old days trying to sound different and complex,
yet somehow supple and yielding.  Not exactly with these guys; they are
rough, and sometimes beautiful, and the longer they stick around, the
better they'll gel.  Auditory ride in the industrial clothes dryers at
the diaper service.

Sunday December 5
    DADDIES at Smokey Joe Cafe
    My oldest brother's band playing Paul Revere and the Raiders, the
Animals, etc... and a bit of blatant nepotism from me but, hell, if you
like this kind of music you should know it's available.  Besides,
everything else playing on this night is flaccid and familiar.

Tuesday December 7
    Battle of the Bands at Zydeco
    Well, Mr Bubble made it, cool, but so did the Autumn Lords, yawn,
but you get seven bands for your entertainment dollar, and you can watch
their friends and relatives vote.

Wednesday December 8
    GARGOYLES/WHITE COLLAR CONSERVATIVES at The Nick
    Gargolyes are weird Boykin family reunion tunes and WCC are
hardcorish young future leaders with a kickass drummer on a little
Gretch kit, if I remember correctly.

Thursday December 9
    Battle of the Bands at Louie Louie
    What is this?  The Ticks battle not, we're too cool for that, but
I'm not too cool to avoid seeing what's up, especially since I don't
know what bands are in the competition.  Imagine feeling like "The Best
Band in Birmingham" award meant something.

Friday December 10
    CACTUS PIE/SHAME IDOLS/MOTHER'S DAY OUT at The Nick
    Shake those pounds away and smell the atmosphere of a Shame Idols
show with two gambles (don't know how they sound) to sweeten the pot.

Saturday December 11
    Lots of stuff:
    TOPPER PRICE weaving his way through legendary
lusty ad executives with a shot of whiskey and a harmonica down at the
22nd St Jazz Cafe, doubtlessly damaging the foundations of the tiny club
with the sound and the smoke...
    Then over to The Nick for another three
band thing (becoming the norm? I hope not) of unknown music (never heard
SEA OF RAINS/VIOLENT SKY/MARILYN'S NEIGHBORS)...
    Or drunk driving to Tuscaloosa for frat nightmare DASH RIP ROCK, or
go to the movies and fall asleep instead.

Sunday December 12
    JAMES HALL BAND at The Nick
    Not my exact cup of tea but if you want to see other leather jackets
like yours and mine and get a loud heavy show, go on down there, man.

Monday December 13
    Toys for Tots Benefit at Louie Louie
    THE TICKS may put their names in the hat, from which players are
drawn randomly to play ad lib covers for charity.  I'm working till
midnight, but we are trying to see if I can come down afterward and play
"Rock and Roll Sewer" or some such song or two.  I think one should
bring a toy donation to enter, but there may be a cover as well.

Wednesday December 15
    SPACE CAMP at Oasis
    I still think this is one of the cooler bands to hear because the
songs are so good.  Oasis is a nice cubby hole to hear them in; they
have an outside deck area if it's not too cold, and the players can hear
your requests without your bellowing them.

Friday December 17
    FIVE EIGHT/AUTUMN LORDS at The Nick
    Five Eight is fun to dance to especially if you're grumpy, which I
always am, and I think you should know that the Autumn Lords, with Chris
the Lush King (my friend), have made the embarassing error of taking
stage names.  I don't know all of them, but the bassist actually calls
himself Bobby Dilautid and poor Chris, well, that's something like "DJ
StarShaker" to you bub.

Saturday December 18
    PAUL WESTERBURG in Atlanta (don't know club name)
    He's my man, if he can't do it, no one can!  Probably a great show,
though I may remain in town for a friend's party, and no, you can't come
but you can go see SHALLOW at the Nick; they're darnright nice, and even
if I liked their earlier incarnation, Volume, better, I can get a nice
head buzz from that guitar blitz static.

Buy Christmas gifts for the next few days, then:

Wednesday December 22
    SHAME IDOLS/CACTUS PIE at The Nick
    What's left of my hearing, I try to donate to good shows, so I'll
give a little slice of high end to this night.

Friday December 24
    BIG DIXIE at The Nick
    I heckled them, so they call me some unpleasant names, but they're
just fine and dandy nonetheless.  Even if they cover "Sugar Shack", they
also cover "Sukiyaki".

Saturday December 25
    I'll be at the Nick playing and having a Christmas party thing
going.  Other options include recovering from salmonella in your
Grandma's cooking or watching those Macy's Thanksgiving Parade tapes.
Merry Christmas, by the way.

Sunday December 26
    PRIMITONS at The Nick
    Ah, those were the days!  I fully recommend tryng to catch these
songs, some of which I miss, from the pre-drag-show Mots-Roden-is-a-
songwriter era. I just hope they practice and this isn't a throw-
together, because the songs are so good they deserve it.


    That's it; you're just going to have to make these decisions for
yourself for the rest of December.  I'm taking a Christmas vacation from
this responsibility.

    A few comments, though.  Seeing reunions of old bands become more
frequent, or in the case of the Ho-Ho Men, become permanent, is not a
good thing.  Why?  Becuase after just noticing that even the deadhead
$1.07 Band is doing a reunion, I think it's time these guys did new
things.  Newer, better, different.  Primitons once is a Christmas
present.  Back to 1988 is a standstill.  I'm waiting, and watching for
the eventual outcome of this trend.  One things for damn sure: ain't
gonna be no VBS comeback tour!

    Shonen Knife is performing on the 3rd in New Orleans with Nirvana,
and I almost opted to go, but I just might have gotten stuck there a
whole weekend with no way to attend the BTN party, and that would have
made Mark too happy.  I am getting a shirt out of it, if my friends
decide to be a bit more reliable.

    Louie Louie is under new management.  I heard murmurs that it's
connected to the Ivory Tusk, and hopefully it will continue to book live
entertainment.  The Rocking Horse got busted for male strippers without
a licence... And I'm putting a new Seymour Duncan in the SG.

    Happy Holidays!

    NOTES FROM
    THE TRENCHES:
    What the Hell is Going On?                         Dean Costello
    ################################################################


    I came home from work this evening, which is not all that unusual.
I am vaguely tired and vaguely hungry and vaguely bored, trying to
determine what to do for the rest of the night (the lack of real
emotions has been vaguely disturbing me over the last couple of months,
but that's not for this forum).  Choices are probably the same as the
last couple of years : read a magazine or journal while dinner is
cooking, maybe play a computer game or two while watching "Roseanne",
watch some more television until approximately 9 or 9:30, undress, hang
up pants and tie from work, take a shower while listening to a comedy
tape (tonight looks like Bill Cosby), read a bit, then go to sleep at or
around 11:00.  The joy of adult life.

    Tonight commemorates my ninth straight spaghetti dinner.  Tonight
also commemorates that fact that I have crossed the $33,000 mark (gross)
for the year.  Note the dichotomy between those two statements.  I know
I have.

    Let us examine this ugly circumstance, shall we?  On a bi-weekly
basis, I net approximately $880 (more or less).  Six percent of my pre-
tax wage goes immediately into a 401K plan.  Something like $30/
paycheck is used to pay for my dental plan.  $20/paycheck is automat-
ically deposited into a savings account I have with the credit union
(there is about $400 in the account, paying about four percent).  The
end result is about $850 per paycheck.

    Let us assume that I am going to gross about $40,000 this year when
all is said and done.  (I think that will be pretty close.)  That means
that after taxes, et al (as discussed above) are removed, I will net
about $25,000.

    "Ahhh," you say, "that's a lot of money.  What the hell do you spend
it all on?"  Good question.  Let's take a look.



     Item                           Cost/year

1-Apartment                           9600
2-Student Loans                       4800
3-Credit Card                         2400
4-Telephone                           2400
5-Car Stuff                           1800
6-Car Insurance                        800
7-Cable                                600
8-Electric                             500
                                     -----
  Total                              22900

Comments:

1-Yes, my apartment is a bit pricey.  This is the cost of living in
  the Nation's Capital.

2-I have to pay at least $400/month for my student loans.  God
  bless Reagan for cutting student grants.  People ask me why I
  cannot contribute to the economy by buying a big thing like a car.
  I wonder why...

3-For my foolishness of working for an oil refinery, I was given a
  Mastercard with a $16,000 credit limit.  For my sins, I was
  accepted to graduate school.  For my silliness, I burned through a
  lot of credit.  I am paying about $200/month to retire that debt.

4-My phone bill is not outrageous, about $200/month.  It depends on
  whether I am on the road or at home.  When I am on the road, I
  have to use the phone card, when I'm at home, I dial direct.

5-I think I am being conservative on the car stuff.  I am assuming about
  $60/month for gasoline, the occasional tune-up and oil change, as well
  as one or two major repairs/year (say, $250 or more).

6-What can I say?  When I had a Ford Probe as a rental car, I got busted
  for speeding three times in two weeks.  Alas...

7-Cable is about $50/month.  This includes the basic service of 122
  channels, as well as two channels of Cinemax (the double Cinemax doesn't
  cost any more than a single Cinemax).

8-I simply don't use much electricity.  During the summer months, I burn
  a lot of fossil fuels since I like the apartment at about 65 degrees at
  night ($75).  During the winter, I don't fool with heat at all, so its
  pretty cheap ($20).

    Okay, that leaves approximately $2000 to spend how I will.  What to
buy, what to buy.  Well, just to be cool, maybe I'll eat. Let's assume
that I spend a total of $50/week total for food (lunch and dinner).
That implies a total of $2500-ish for food.  Now, since I only have
$2000, that can't be right, and it isn't.  I am out in the field for
approximately three to five months of the year.  That means that my food
cost can be cut approximately in half, which means that my true food
cost is about $1250. Lovely.  That leaves me a total of $750.

    $750.  Hmmm.  With $750 I go on two vacations per year, I have to
buy presents and such for relatives, go to movies, drink, get magazine
subscriptions, have fun, travel around here for no good reason, buy
software, buy hardware--hell, buy anything.

    Tricky business, this.

    From what I can tell, the circumstance that I describe is not all
that uncommon.  A lot of people of my age bracket describe very
similar circumstances.  There are about five people at the office who
are approximately in my same demographic.  One friend is paying
off a two bedroom condo mortgage of $109,000.  Another person
built a house with her husband, who works as a land-raper turning
mountainsides into golf course/condo complexes (to be fair, this
is an economic outlyer).  A third person is splitting a townhouse
with three other people that, surprisingly enough, do the exact
same thing that he does.  I live in an apartment by myself.
Somewhere between 50 and 75% of us are living from one paycheck to
the next.  Two of the five of us have to return to parents every
so often, on bent knee, to make ends meet.

    I was talking with supply-side economist Cecilia Masson whom I asked
about this strange circumstance of the poverty-striken upper-middle
class.  "Well, there are probably a couple of reasons.  The one that
best comes to mind is that during the early '80s, Ronald Reagan cut
college grants to students.  The students were then forced or cajoled
to take student loans which were not conceived as being a real debt to
the student at the time.  Now, look at the interest rates on the 'great
deals' that were being handed out to the students."  (My student loan
rates are five, nine and twelve percent.)  "You can get a car loan with
a lower interest rate these days."  Between that, and a soft employment
picture, the circumstance seems somewhat biased against the Best and the
Brightest.

    I'm sure that there are other reasons for my plight.  If I didn't
live in D.C., I imagine that the cost of living would be somewhat lower.
I assume that I could always get a better job, maybe in a different
region, which I am trying to do right now.  I don't think that my
spending is outrageous, but I could reasonably cut back my telephone to
$100/month, which would free up about a thousand or so, which would in
turn be plowed directly into reducing my personal student debt.  I
think, though, that the basic problem is that I came out of school into
a very bad economic situation, and now I am paying the price.  Its not
as if I live an extravagant lifestyle.  If I did, I can live with this
high-income poverty.  But like I said, I have a nice apartment; not
wonderful, just nice.  I have fairly good stereo equipment, but I bought
that two years ago.  I don't "party", I don't drink, I don't buy silly
things.  I would go almost so far as to say that it is a spartan
existence here.  When I go on vacation I don't get carried away; I buy
some items for friends of mine to make up for a debt from grad school.
But it isn't as if I have an apartment full of dopey shit that I bought
because I thought it was "cute".

    So, right now I am sitting here typing this screed out on a seven-
year-old computer, watching cable on a 19" television, slowly digesting
yet another spaghetti dinner.  Hell, it ain't even real spaghetti.  It
is a bag-o-spag ($2.50/5-pound bag), using a sauce with 1/3 stick of
butter and 1/3 can of sauce), knowing full well that I am not being paid
until next Friday and things aren't going to be getting much better in
the near future since I have already spent my next paycheck paying off
these student loans, and I can't help but think that something is
fundamentally wrong.

     drivers do mind-bogglingly stupid things (well, that *is* odd,
     isn't it?)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
My greatest unfulfilled ambition is:

     4. teaching my parakeet to pick good stocks/horses/dogs/football
     teams/etc.

The last good movie I saw was:
     Oddly enough, _Aladdin_!  Yes, add Robin Williams to the above list.
     Also, of course, _Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country_, which
     means I guess you'd better add David Warner to the list above, too.
     Getting a little out of hand, isn't it?  Well, you *did* ask!!
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The last good book I read was:
     The last really good book I read was _Prime Directive_, which, not
     surprisingly, was a Star Trek novel.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
If they were making a movie of my life, I'd like to see my part
played by:
     Christopher Lambert, Christopher Walken, or Robin Williams
------------------------------------------------------------------------
My pet peeves are:
     People who mispel words and PEOPLE WHO TYPE IN ALL CAPS!
------------------------------------------------------------------------
When nobody's looking, I like to:
     Throw things at them and yell "Reflex Check!" at the last moment.

*RIP* = BBS Software is RIP Graphics capable. You must be using a RIP
compatible term software to view them. RIPTerm or QmodemPro v1.50 are
the only two I know of that support it at this time. RIPTerm is shareware
and can be downloaded from most BBS's. QmodemPro is a commercial product.
