From the Editor
by Scott Hollifield

    To begin with this month, I have a public confession to make.  It's
something which I was hoping to hide from everyone, but recent events
have come to light which make it impossible for me to continue to remain
silent on this matter.
    I have a severe health problem which has only been recently
diagnosed.  The medical term for it is ranidaecrunchinumeronesia.  It's
a very rare, very particular disease - put simply, it is a neurological
disorder which shuts down the pathways of the brain that allow people
who are editors of BTN to remember and accurately record the correct
phone numbers belonging to a BBS called the Crunchy Frog.
    Very serious.  My family has not been informed, and I hope to keep
them out of it, for obvious reasons, but I thought my friends should
know.  It's something which has chronically impaired my ability to
function for the last two months, and the final blow came in last
month's issue of BTN, where, thinking that I had conquered my problem,
I proudly announced that the "correct" numbers for Crunchy Frog had been
listed, finally.  Sadly, such was not the case.
    However, there is hope on the horizon.  With the support of friends
and staff colleagues, great care has been taken to ensure that the
Crunchy Frog's number has been accurately represented as of this issue.
The disease is in remission, and although I know that it will be a long
journey back to normality, I am confident that we can all get through
this.  Thank you all for everything.

    Now then, I feel I really should repeat something I said last issue,
and that is that BTN needs articles, desperately, surely, madly.
There's plenty to write about these days; I have a few ideas myself
which, conveniently, are going to wait until next month.  And everyone
should also be aware that BTN's fifth anniversary is coming up in May.
Why?  Because it's important, damn it.

    This month, we are carrying a special feature which you may have
already seen if you're a regular on The Matrix.  Rocky Rawlins has
recently formed the American BBS Association, a very good idea whose
time has come, and something which BTN plans to support in anyway
possible.  In this issue, you'll find the purpose and background of the
ABBSA, plus an application for any sysops who might want to join.
Explicit instructions are given in the article for doing so.
    Also, regulars Lurch Henson and Damion Furi (how did I get stuck
with these guys?) have a few things to say to you, and Judy Ranelli, our
emissary from the local music scene, is quite prepared to tell you which
bands you should go watch.  And lest I forget, the new version of PKZip
which has everyone in a dither lately is reviewed herein, by our
esteemed publisher.  That plus the usual odds and ends (er, pending
publication at press time) make up this issue of BTN.  See you next
time.

Letters to the Editor

From: Mark Shafer

Dear Editor,
    I have a problem.  I am engaged to a wonderful lady and am planning
to finalize the wedding date with her.  I come from a family of 4
brothers and herein lies the problem.  My older brother Jeff is in
prison for the rape of a 14 year old and will not be released for
another 12 years.  My next older brother Bob is gay and living with two
other homosexuals.  My younger brother is on the run from the police.
It seems they want him for bank robbery and killing a bank guard.  And
my youngest brother is a computer programmer working for IBM...  My
problem is: Should I tell my fiance about my brother the computer
programmer?

[Ed.:  Yes.  If IBM keeps going the way it is, you may have to take care
of him for a while.]


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

                      THE AMERICAN BBS ASSOCIATION

                             Rocky Rawlins


I:  PURPOSE

The American BBS Association (ABBSA) exists to provide an umbrella advocacy
organization for BBS operators. ABBSA is organized roughly on the model used
by the Better Business Bureau.

The ABBSA National Office is in Birmingham, Alabama based at The MATRIX
BBS. The ABBSA National Support Conference is available for echo from The
MATRIX at no cost other than normal Long Distance charges. The MATRIX BBS
is accessible at 300-2400 baud at (205) 323-2016 and at 9600+ baud at
(205) 323-6016. The MATRIX BBS is a subscription BBS however ABBSA Sysops
will be given Visiting Sysop status (90 minutes a day and full access) at
no charge.

The National ABBSA Office can also be reached on the Internet as
abbsa.nat@the-matrix.com and the Alabama Chapter as abbsa.al@the-matrix.com.
The National and Alabama ABBSA voice number is (205) 251-9347.

The ABBSA is organized on a State Basis. i.e. we are currently forming the
Alabama Chapter of the ABBSA here in Alabama. The National Office of the
ABBSA functions ONLY as an Advisory and Coordinating center for State
Chapters and State Chapters retain complete independence. If you are
interested in forming a State Chapter, please contact us through one of
the above channels. There are no fees or costs required for formation of
a State Chapter.

The goals of the ABBSA are simple in conception though perhaps more difficult
to carry out.

              American BBS Association Policy and Goals

1. Educate the public about the purposes, potential, and benefits of
   Electronic Communications.
2. Monitor the media for inaccurate and misleading information
   regarding BBS activity and take steps to correct such misinformation.
3. Regularly inform the media of significant events in the local BBS
   community.
4. Serve as a source of information for individuals or organizations
   seeking information about BBS.
5. Inform ABBSA member BBS of significant legislation or other actions
   which affect the BBS community.


Membership in ABBSA requires only that a BBS Sysop agree to "support the
Ethical Standards" of the ABBSA. No "enforcement" mechanism exists other
than the right of the Chairman of a State Chapter to revoke the membership
of a state BBS after consultation with other members. ABBSA Member Sysops
may elect a new Chairman of a State Chapter at any time on a majority
vote.

NO DUES OR FEES ARE REQUIRED FOR MEMBERSHIP IN ABBSA.

Every member of ABBSA may post on their BBS that they are a member of
the ABBSA and all members are strongly encouraged to post the ABBSA
Ethical Standards on their BBS as a bulletin or in some other accessible
manner.



II:  BACKGROUND


The American BBS Association was formed as a result of media activity in
the Birmingham, Alabama area. A local station aired sensationalist stories
about children accessing "dirty pictures" on local BBS. Local Sysops made
numerous attempts to contact the management of the station to discuss the
misperceptions being reinforced by such reporting. The reaction of the
local station was to completely ignore the members of the local BBS
community.

This was particularly disturbing in light of the contributions of the BBS
community to the state and city. Local BBS provided free Email to the
Gulf states during the war for family members and friends to communicate
with personnel assigned there. Local Sysops provided extensive forums for
local and national candidates and campaigns to communicate with the public.
Many local BBS provide a variety of free services in support of the local
schools, charity organizations, Police Departments. The BBS community
provides Internet and other International communications capability that
is not available through any other channel in the state for individuals.

Despite the more than a decade of service and support of the local
community and business, local media completely ignores the benefits and
contribution of the local BBS community in preference for stories that
promulgate old stereotypes and sensational implications. With the growing
visibility of BBS but a deep ignorance of what a BBS is, this trend is
certain to grow unless we take positive action.

While the efforts of individual Sysops can easily be ignored by a media
organization, imagine the effects of phone calls and letters from hundreds
of Sysops and Users across the State in conjunction with Press Releases and
Press Conferences from the State ABBSA Chapter.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation is doing a wonderful job on the National
level to address many of the legislative, legal, and social issues that
affect the Electronic Community. But they have neither the resouces nor the
emphasis to address problems on the local level. The ABBSA is oriented to
fill that vacuumn and to address the isssues that affect all of us on
a local level.

Past efforts to form a National level organization of BBS or Sysops have
foundered on the rocks of "control" and "authority". Being Sysops ourselves
we have the natural loathing for anyone telling us how to run our boards or
to try to impose a set of rules on us. BBSing is a good example of "anarchy
in action". But the vast majority of Sysops share common goals and standards.
The intention of the ABBSA is to "codify" those common standards and goals in
a written form with which we can all agree but which do not in any way
interfere with our personal control of our individual BBS.

We believe the Ethical Standards of the ABBSA are ones with which all Sysops
can readily agree and support since they simply echo existing standards.

The growth of the ABBSA provides every member BBS with a platform from which
to communicate with the media, legislators, and the public. With a set of
Public Ethical Standards and a formal organization, we can much more
effectively combat the hysteria, stereotypes, and sensationalist image that
is emerging more and more in the public eye. The continued growth of the
local, national and world BBS community is dependent on an accurate public
understanding of the potential and benefits of electronic communications.

We encourage all Sysops to support the ABBSA by becoming a member and
publically posting your support of the goals and Ethical Standards of the
ABBSA.

Review & Comparison of PKZIP 2.04e versus PKZIP 1.10
by Mark Maisel

     With the long awaited release of the newest version of PKZIP for
MS-DOS machines, I thought it would be a good idea to compare the new
with the old as part of my evaluation.  You'll first find a quick
reference table below followed by summaries of each file type and how
well the versions of PKZIP handled them.  There were several bugs
reported within days of the release of PKZIP 2.04c.  The version I used
for this review, 2.04e, is the release containing fixes for the problems
first found in the new release.  In my use of both 2.04c and 2.04e, I
had no problems but there were enough users with problems to warrant a
fix.   DO NOT USE 2.04c, especially if you are running a machine with
EMS, XMS, or any other memory above 640K.

     The following results were obtained from the use of the following
machine:  486DX-33mhz computer with 256K static cache, 20 megabytes of
memory (RAM), and 670 megabyte SCSI hard drive (15ms).  On different
machines, your results will vary, but should be consistent with the
degree or percentage of change found with each sample.

PKZIP 2.04e    0 seconds                2701

     Speed improvement is negligible on this system.  Compression
improvement is roughly 4%.  The actual space required to store the file
created by both versions of PKZIP exceeded the space, in bytes, used by
the uncompressed files. As most hard drives use a 512 byte or larger
sector size, the ZIP'ed file does use less room.  I would not, however,
recommend ZIP'ing your batch files if you use them regularly, except for
purposes of backup.

     Speed improvement is roughly 16%. Both versions did a pretty good
job of compressing the file.  The new version did a better job by
roughly 10%.  For purposes of saving space, PKZIP seems appropriate if
you aren't going to be using this file often, or if you have the luxury
of being able to decompress a program into a RAMDISK for execution.

     Speed improvement is roughly 54%. Both versions did a pretty good
job of compressing the file.  The new version did a better job by
roughly 25%.  This is especially impressive since it took less than half
the time of the old version.

8%.

     Speed improvement is non-existent since none occurred.  I attribute
the slower time to PKZIP attempting to optimize its compression for
graphics data.  This is speculation.  Compression improvement is roughly
7%.  For data such as this, a good implementation of JPEG graphics
compression would be far more suitable.

the new version is roughly 18% better.

                     >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

     All in all, I am very pleased with the latest release of PKZIP.  I
wish it had come out sooner as it had been advertised for well over a
year prior to its arrival.  I also found it curious that so many
problems cropped up when it was released given the exhaustive incubation
period it has had.  I experienced no problems, but others did with
2.04c.  Be sure to use 2.04e if you decide to try or use the new PKZIP.

     So far as I know, PKWARE has not released compatible versions for
any other platforms.  Be considerate of Amiga, OS/2, Atari, and others
who use either PKWARE or other incarnations of a ZIP compression scheme.
Perhaps if enough of you folks out there who are one of the above
platforms let PKWARE know you want a new version, you'll get one.  Good
luck!

                    BBSing In The Real World

                               by

                           Damion Furi



     I still haven't called CompuServe, GEnie, or any other LD BBS,
in the seven or eight months that I've had my modem.  Why not?
Well, I understand that most BTN readers have been using modems
longer than I've been interested in computers, but our local area
BBSs are still so FULL of wonderful things that I've just never
gotten around to calling long distance services.
     I think there are a lot of users that take our local area BBSs
for granted.  I KNOW I've caught myself thinking of The Matrix as
a kind of extended personal hard drive - instead of telling Rocky,
for example, "Hey, thanks!  I appreciate all your hard work, of
which I have been an occasional beneficiary!"
     For example, I D/Led IntelliComm from Owlabama Mensa News and
BBSEE from The Matrix.  I am currently in the process of setting up
IntelliComm for automated mail and file runs.  Intellicomm will be
tied to my private BBS to run as an event at weird o'clock in the
morning while I'm asleep.  A separate event (if I can rig it) will
run BBSEE, an offline file manager that can pull NEWFILES.DAT from
.QWK packets and append the listing to the existing catalog for a
specified board (I think; I'm still reading the docs).
     When I wake up in the morning, my mail will be waiting for me,
and my file catalogs will be updated (I hope).  I will have a
complete list of all the files I have on- and offline, as well as
a constantly updated file listing for the boards I use most often.
Theoretically, I could find the files I want while offline, set up
IntelliComm to leech `em while I'm innocently asleep, and have
Christmas every day.  If I could find a program to keep tabs on my
UL/DL ratios, catalog which files I've sent where and when, and
warn me before a sysop decides I'm a Grade A Leech, I think I would
be set for life.  Well, I would be happy for awhile, anyway.
     To me, all this is ultra cool!  And I owe it all to our local
boards!  Sure, CompuServe probably has all this stuff, and more.
But I got this locally, and I don't have to worry about any
expenses except registration fees; as opposed to LD charges (or
subscription fees) AND registration fees.
     Another reason I haven't called LD is due to the plethora of
netted BBSs in and around Birmingham.  I can call Owlabama Mensa
News and talk to somebody in Australia or the U.K.  (Or, I could
call The Matrix and probably talk to Martians...!  If Rocky adds
another net to that board, I think it will either collapse or
implode.)  I am very heavily involved in several ALAnet subs, and
I barely have time to keep up with that.  If I called CompuServe,
I think I would probably become One with my PC.
     A third reason I haven't called LD is lack of money.  But I
think that's beside the point...

     One of these days I will have enough "discretionary income" to
subscribe to all of the boards I would like to support...Owlabama
Mensa News, The Matrix, Nirvana, Teaser's, The Drawing Room,
DiskTop Publishing, NightBreed, and half a dozen more.  So far, the
only board to which I've subscribed is Baudville.
     I suppose that it's just as well that I'm broke; with a list
like mine, I would just be a broke subscriber.

                                  by

                              Lurch Henson



   Well, well, well.....I missed a month.....  No one noticed, did they?
I got swamped with work, and illness, but what happened to the rest of
you?  Poor little Scott having to go to archives to fill out the
issue....  Well, with any luck that won't happen again.  (Yeah, right.)

   One morning at work, not long after "Young and Elder" came on the
radio, I heard them making some comment about a judge ruling that the
Conferate flag couldn't be flown on state buildings anymore....  Jeez,
don't courts have ANYTHING better to do?  I don't know, something like
getting rid of the backlog of cases about silly little things like rape,
murder, arson, armed robbery, etc., etc., etc.?  No, of course not.  How
silly of me to think so.  I should know better by now, shouldn't I?
I myself think this is a bunch of "hooey" anyway....the reasons they
give for getting rid of the thing are all fine and good.....over 100
years ago.  I myself know of very few people that fly, or display, the
Rebel (no longer Confederate, just plain REBEL) flag that believe that
"black people" should be put in chains and sold on an auction block.
I've flown the flag myself, back when I was married, and living in Lower
Alabama.  Stuck a flagpole up in the front yard and hoisted that thing
high and proud.  I did this in protest, as at the time I was REBELling
against something that was important to myself and my wife.  To me, and
most of the people I know that display this flag, it signifies a Rebel
cause, not an opinion that someone should be a second, or lower, class
citizen because of the color of their skin.  Honestly and truthfully,
skin color makes such a small amount of difference to me that, unless
someone goes out of their way to show it, I frequently do not remember
if a person is "black" or "white".  And no, that ISN'T because my memory
is bad (though may well be, I can't remember), but because it DOESN'T
MAKE ANY DAMNED DIFFERENCE.  Now, if a guy comes up to me, talking
"jive" and making a point of proving to me that he's upset because his
great-great-great-grandfather used to be a slave, then sure, I'll notice
that his skin is darker than mine (but, as anyone that's met me will
tell you, so is almost EVERYONE else's).  Otherwise, who cares?
Certainly not me.  If I find a woman attractive, I don't look closely to
see if she has any African-American blood, and then snub her if she
does, if I find her attractive I tell her so, "black" or "white".

   The day I was hired at the job that's taking up all my time, another
guy was in there getting hired as well, and his ride had to leave before
he was finished with the paperwork, so I gave him a ride home.  When I
dropped him off, he tried to pay me for the lift, and I refused him.  He
thanked me again, and said it was real nice to see someone willing to
help out, especially with the "race thing".  That pissed me off.  I
almost snapped at him, but stopped myself and told him "No problem".  It
wasn't his fault, entirely, that he saw me as "white" and him as
"black", but every time someone points out the difference I can't help
but start to boil....  There IS no damned difference.  No, wait, I AM
SLIGHTLY wrong.....but the difference is ENTIRELY cultural.  Until such
time as people are TAUGHT the truth, that there is really no difference
between humans with different colored skin, we will continue to have
"racial (stupid word, everyone's still human, right?) problems".

   I myself advocate research into a virus that will cause people's skin
to change color, randomly selected by some minor, non-important,
variable in the human body, with shadings so widely varied that no two
people have the exact same coloring.....  Now, I don't mean make
"blacks" "white", or vice versa, I mean colors like blue, pink, purple,
green, yellow, red....you get the idea.  Make sure no one is the same
color as anyone else, and MAYBE people will begin to act with a little
common sense......  (But trust me, I'm NOT holding my breath.....)

Local Music In February
by Judy Ranelli


Mon. 1
    KENT DUCHAINE at The Nick
    He used to play with Johnny Shines, a legendary blues guitarist and
car uphoslterer, but since Mr. Shines passed away, Mr. Duchaine
continues to play classic blues and slide on a very cool dobro.

Thur. 4
    TONY LOMBARDO QUARTET at Dugan's
    SPACE CAMP at Otey's
    Happy birthday to miscreants all over the world; go to Dugan's at
some point and drink a coffee cocktail to The Infamous Tony Lombardo
quartet.  Or go to Otey's and get your eardrums redecorated with Space
Camp.  Don Tinsley has become my new Favorite Birmingham Guitarist.

Fri. 5
    TOPPER PRICE AND THE UPSETTERS/THE DIGGERS at The Nick
    The Diggers are a lovely band from Atlanta that I highly recommend
for very vague reasons which I won't go into here.  Huh?  Oh, and Topper
Price & The Upsetters are especially good when Topper has had a few.
They do stuff like "Route 66" and grungy blues with great harmonica,
courtesy of Topper.  I understand they even did "Poke Salad Annie" on
request, but I shudder to think of that.

Sat. 6
    Go bowling.

Mon. 8
    Writer's Night at Otey's
    The Flamingo's Writers Night moved to Otey's.  Now here goes my
professional career, but I don't like Writers Night, at least this one.
Why?  Two reasons: they don't allow people to talk during the
performances - hardly a friendly barroom atmosphere setting - and they
take a collection after the patrons have already payed cover, never a
successful tactic to use on skinflint musicians like me.  Oh, they also
have strict rules about who gets to play and who doesn't; it's not a
democratic procedure, either.  That's three reasons, isn't it?

Mon. 8
    JONATHAN RICHMAN at Zydeco
    See, you'd rather be here anyway!  Jonathan Richman is a very
funny, very witty popsongster... I've seen him before, you know...
heh... it will be a jovial evening, to be sure.

Tue. 9
    ARC ANGELS at Louie Louie
    I don't know what they sound like, but they have lots of famous
players in one band: Charlie Sexton, and a couple of guys that played
with Stevie Ray Vaughn.  Probably worth seeing.

Wed. 10
    REMY ZERO at The Nick
    In 1989, I heard about Remy Zero as a band that, without live
performances, had managed to snag a major label contract.  "I'll believe
it when I see it," I stated.  Here they are, finally.  I still hold out
belief in the album release until I see it in the CD bin, but otherwise,
I intend to check this band out.  Come see what Birmingham's up to.

Thurs. 11
    ALEX OGBURN at Burly Earl
    Alex is an excellent drummer who is playing guitar in a little local
circuit.  I haven't heard him do this so I am curious as to what it will
be like.  He's talented, that's for sure.

Sat. 13
    THE VILLAGE PEOPLE at Louie Louie
    I own a concert book from their tour in the late '70s signed by the
Indian.  How amusing to find this embarrassing item suddenly regarded as
cool again.  I think this show will be lots of fun even if they do lip
sync.

Mon. 15
    PUNKINHEAD/A MET Z at The Nick
    Don't know about Punkinhead, but A Met Z are still one of the neater
bands in Birmingham; I own and enjoy their tape.

Wed. 17
    Live Mariachi Band at Sol' Azteca
    I saw one of these in a restaurant in San Antonio.  Pretty neat.  I
like those bass guitars.

Wed. 25
    BARKING TRIBE at The Nick
    They sound quite good with the horns and keyboards.  It's brilliant
because it's the last thing anyone would have predicted they would do
after they lost their guitarist and druumer.

Thurs. 25
    MARCIA BALL at Louie Louie
    A New Orleans pianist, she looms tall over the audience and her
gigantic hands scoop up keys and sling 'em back while one foot works the
pedals and the other, her legs being crossed, kicks an invisible target
in the air.  Her backup band sweats and her audience sweats and we all
have fun.

Thurs. 25
    PINKY THE STABBER at The Nick
    Bassist Chris Hendrix and I have talked for many years about forming
a group that would, once, play 2112 live.  I think I'll add a slow,
solemn "Band on the Run" to the list.  And you already know I like Pinky
very very very much.

Fri. 26
    DAN BAIRD at The Nick
    You know, that gap in his teeth didn't hinder his success in the
video circuit.  Amazing.  I bet this will be a good show, the Satellites
always were.
    [Ed.: Dan Baird used to be the guy in the Georgia Satellites.  Hey,
I didn't know.]

    One last note: Did you catch the Shawn Ryan article on Center Stage
Productions in the News? Well, I was a Center Stage member for six
years.  The reasons for its demise are complex, but one thing Shawn
missed was that the chairperson was privy to unbelievable perks, which
are now given to the UAB personnel that took power out of the
chairperson's pocket.  Well and good; the students pay for it all
anyway.  But the situation was driven by the fact stated above and
having interviewed only former chairpersons, Ryan missed getting that
fact stated.  Actually, I could probably write a sordid book about why
Center Stage has faded from its glory, but no one is really interested.
Let sleeping dogs lie, the cliche' says.  zzzzzzz.

        ----
        Local musician Judy Ranelli, in case you missed the hint in the
        article, celebrates a birthday on February 4.

BBS Spotlight
by Eric Hunt

        This month:  SPERRY BBS


1) Name of the BBS:

   SPERRY

2) Name of the sysop:

   Jack Efird

3) BBS software used:

   PCBoard 14.5a

4) How long have you been sysoping?

   Started playing with bbs in 1982.  Had a full time on-line
   bbs in 1984.

5) Are you a subscription only / completely free / hybrid of the
    two BBS?

   There is NEVER a charge for the use of this bbs.

6) How many incoming phone lines and approximate disk space? Do
    you support high speed modems? If so, what type(s)?

   At present, there is one incomming line, supporting up to
   14400 (v32bis/v42bis).  The modem is a Practical Peripherals
   PM1440FXSA.  Disk space (always a problem) is 285 megs.

7) Is your BBS primarily a files BBS, primarily a message based
    BBS, or a combination of the two?

   Files seem to be the winner here.  There just has never been
   a large message base.  I didn't plan it that way, it just is.

8) If you've sysop'd more than just this BBS, briefly list previous
    endeavours and their lifespans.

   This is the only one!

9) What made you decide to take the masochistic plunge and become a
    sysop?

   Crazy I guess.  No, honestly, I enjoy running the bbs, even
   though it gets pretty hectic at times.  It is rewarding to be
   able to provide a service for free.

10) What is the general 'thrust' or area of specialty for your BBS:

    Doesn't seem to have one does it?  I am presently in the
    process of thinking out how I might change the bbs (for the
    better, I hope).

11) (optional) What is your regular job/career to support this
    leeching hobby of sysoping?

    I am a lead engineer with Unisys Corp.  I have over 25 years
    with the combination of my time with Sperry, and the new
    Unisys (formed by the merger of Sperry & Burroughs).

12) What are your plans for the coming year?

    Immediate plans are to add a CD rom drive, in the hopes that
    it will free up some of the badly needed hard drive space.
    Only time will tell if another node can be justified.

13) Where would you like your BBS to go over the next 5 years?

    Of course I would like to see it grow.  My time, job, and
    available finances will determine what happens.

14) What do you feel the highlights of your BBS are?

    General interest files, and game doors.

15) What is your personal vision of the 'ideal user?'

    One who is aware of others who would enjoy the same interests
    as him/herself.  One who is aware that they are a "guest" in
    my home, and conducts themselves accordingly.

16) What is the thing you've enjoyed most about providing your BBS?

    The interesting people I meet, the vast file libraries that have
    been generated, and the knowledge that I have gained from it.

17) What is the thing you've enjoyed least about providing your BBS?

    The DAILY upkeep that MUST be done, and the constant battle
    for hard disk space.
