Editorial

     It has been a looooong summer to be sure.  I have never traveled so
much in such a short time.  It had its good moments but I believe if I
had it to do again, I would give it a miss.  The travel is the reason
that this issue is coming to you somewhat late.  I think that this issue
is worth the wait, and why shouldn't I?

     For those of you who have not seen them,  the BTN GIFs are out.
They are available on The Matrix and Channel 8250 here in Birmingham.  I
attempted to place them on the Front Porch over in Georgia, which is our
Metronet regional hub, and was confronted with an insufficient disk
space, at long distance, aaaarrrrgggghhh.  I also intend to send them to
the D.C. Information Exchange, the Metronet international hub.  We're
gonna be famous, or is that infamous?  Many thanks to Jeff Freeman and
his friend at Dalton College with all the great equipment that I
covet.  I will be attempting to generate more of these beauties but
don't rush me, these have only taken 2.5 years.

     This summer has seen the revival of off-line mail reading, and with
a vengeance.  This being the case, it is only appropriate that we have a
review of the door that makes all this possible from one of the worst
bbs junkies in Birmingham. I hope that a review of the mail reader
programs for the MS-DOS and Amiga folks will follow in an upcoming
issue.  It is all dependent upon my cornering the reviewers in question
long enough to type out the review instead of running back for more
messages.  Only two months late, we have a first timer's view of the
last BTN party.  I hope that it will inspire those of you who have never
made the adventure to do so soon. Those of you who have been before,
don't scare away the new folks.  You were new too... once.  Stephen
Davis is back again with more of his tutorial on BASIC programming.  If
you have been scared to try, I am sure that Stephen's advice will be
quite helpful in getting you to take those first experimental steps that
will soon have you running that computer like an old-timer.  Henry
Barfoot is back with another review.  This time out he has been looking
at a word processor that is multilingual.  Check it out if you have ever
needed to correspond in languages other than English.  I do realize that
for some of you, English is a foreign language, but that is another
matter.  Eric Hunt is still playing games with math that most of us
slept through and getting some entertaining results.  The second part of
his review of a fractal generator deserves your attention if you
appreciate math and/or pretty images.  Both are attended to by him this
go round.  What is it like to be the wife Lord Sysop Randy?  We get to
find out as Chris Hilliard is this month's victim in the ProFile.
Actually, she does not elaborate too much as is wise.  He might have to
cut her access if she were to say too much.  Just kidding Randy, that
level -1 access is just a joke, right???  Uh oh.

There is one more thing I would like to bring to your attention before I
end this business.  I have finally gotten some music reviews, YAY!!!
Tyros, who was going to write a companion to Steven's party article,
shot a long requested review of some music to me and it will serve as
our first dip into a music column.  I expect you all to be appalled,
offended, agreeable, and everything in between.  The result of this is
to be articles from you regarding the music you listen to, like,
dislike, think should be deified, or burned.  Please don't hesitate.
Let those little fingers twitch no more.  Let them go to that keyboard
right now and spit out that review you have always wanted to write.

Enjoy the issue and be sure to post your comments PUBLICLY on EzNet or
The Matrix so that we can find you, heh heh.

Late BTN Party Review
(or: So That's What You Look Like)
by Steven Wheeler


     This review was to have appeared in the issue of BTN immediately
following the party.  However, since it took so long for everything to
return to normal, mainly my sanity or lack of, it will hopefully make
the 28th issue.  My apologies to the editor.

     Anticipation ran rampant at our home as the date for the party drew
near.  Ever since reading all the messages concerning the previous
party, my wife and I had been waiting for the next one. Then it appeared
like a bolt from the blue.  A message: Party at Maisel's.  Be still my
beating heart.  At long last we would meet some of the people we had
been swapping messages with for so long.

     Would we measure up to these people?  I know I'm off the beaten
track but some of these people sound plain damned strange.  Could it be
that at last I had stumbled across a group that I could spout
absurdities with and not seem too unusual?

     We loaded up and followed the map Mark had so painstakingly
composed.  The neighborhood seemed normal enough, perhaps too normal.
Were we lost?  No way!  Suddenly it loomed before us.  A sign from
above.  Actually it was attached to a post or something, I can't
remember now.  "Party Here", it read.  Was this an omen?  It sure was.

     We were met first by a diminutive person that I swear must be in
actuality a 40 year old midget.  She introduced herself as Sarah. "No
way", I thought, "you can't be Sarah."  Then we were greeted by a
barefoot man that I instantly knew must be Mark.  We had already been
told that he never wears shoes, so it was dead give-away.  Of course, we
didn't realize that Lee and Maggie would be standing there waiting.  I
finally paid up on my bet as to who would recognize the other first.
And there I was looking for a bald-headed female Sumo wrestler.
Naughty, naughty.

     But before I completely forget why I started this perhaps I should
get to the meat of the subject, the PARTY.

     A fine time was had by one and all.  Judging from the squeals, some
had more fun than others.  Someone was in the hall teaching a new dance,
the Bathroom Hop, I believe.  It consisted of crossing your legs and
hopping about on one foot until someone opened the door. Then make a mad
dash before you lost your place.  Which brings up the matter of Dean's
GIF which should be in distribution soon.  I was privy to a sneak
preview and rate it half a star.

     We were joined later by visitors from the East.  Jeff, Martin and
Kevin (8, count'em, 8) came from Georgia for the event.  Who drove home,
guys?

     There was a rumor that someone was imbibing in ice-water from an
unusual receptacle, but I don't have first-hand knowledge of this event.
That would be worse than a refrigerated rubber glove.

     Of course, the highlight for me was to see Crunchy Frog from the
other side.  It seemed as if several people migrated to the back room
before the evening was over.

     The best part was finally meeting many of the people that I had
only met through their messages.  Now if I could only remember.  But
that will probably come later.  Next time I won't have to go through the
initial shock and can focus on putting names with faces.

     But to conclude this ranting, I guess after meeting everyone I can
now understand how some messages are left without the local homicide
rate increasing.  These modem junkies are really a tight-knit group.
Maybe it's for the best.  Who else would take us?

     Looking forward to the next party, but not the next article.

P.S.  I finally dug all the bamboo slivers from under my nails and got
this typed, Mark.  And no, Qedit wasn't hard to configure and set-up.
Now if I can only find time to read the docs and figure out exactly what
the hell I'm doing.

                        Review By: Ricky Morgan

   Ever log on to your favorite board only to be greeted with this
intimidating sight?

Scan Message Base Since 'Last Read' (Enter)=yes?

(Ctrl-K) or (Ctrl-X) Aborts, (Ctrl-S) Suspends.

Scanning Main (0) .............................
  Msgs For You: 10
 Msgs From You: 0
  # Msgs Found: 178314

   Perhaps I exaggerated a bit, but at times logging on to a new board
or even accessing a busy conference can be a chore in itself when there
is a lot of message traffic.

   So what is a person to do if they want to 'stay abreast' of the
current goings on in and around the local boards?

   As PCBoard exists you have three options.

   1.) Wade through the messages one at a time, attempting to read the
       messages and reply to the ones you find worthy.

   2.) Run with your capture log open, capturing all the messages for
       reading after you log off.

   3.) Or use ZIPMail to zip all the new messages, download them and
       read them at your leisure.

   All three of these methods have their draw backs.  Method 1 relies on
you having enough spare time (not to mention system time) to read all
the messages while on-line.  Method 2 is okay but again you waste
valuable on-line time reading all the messages into the buffer then you
must log off, read the messages, frame replies, log back on and reply,
either directly or via ASCII uploads.  Tedious to say the least.  Method
3 is the best as far as getting the messages to you.  It's a short
procedure to ZIPMail, download it and then log off.  You're still faced
with the dire task of, once unzipped, reading through the vast
quantities of messages, framing replies and then back to ASCII uploads
or responding on-line.

   "Gosh," you may ask yourself, "how can I ever compete for the 'Dean
Costello Lifetime Message Award'?"  Well friends and neighbors, gather
'round.  There IS a better way!"

   It's called MarkMail and I'm going to attempt to tell you a little
about its features.  Features that, should you desire, will help you
leave the likes of Dean Costello covered in dust, far behind you, in the
message bases.

   All you need to know about MarkMail is this.  It collects new
messages for you, zips them up into a file for downloading.  You will
need an off-line reader, such as EZReader to manipulate the message file
once you receive it.  I'll discuss that later.  Mainly, MarkMail is the
system that lets you send and recieve mail for off-line reading.

   This type of automated mail system is great for getting your messages
to you and from you, ZIPMail does that also.  So what is so special
about that.  You still have to read the darn things and then reply to
them and MarkMail won't help there.  Enter EZReader, an off-line mail
reader that will make your mouth water.  But I'm getting ahead of
myself.

MarkMail:

   This is the primary data gathering portion of the system.  It is
accessed, generally, via a DOOR on the host BBS.  Once entering the
MarkMail DOOR you will need to configure it to meet your individual
needs.  Let's look at the configuration setup.  After the DOOR loads you
will be greeted with the opening screen and then the Main prompt.

(68 min. left) MarkMail Command?

Enter C at the prompt to pull up the configuration menu, which will look
something like this:

                   Configuration Menu

1.  Select Transfer Protocol.            Currently: Zmodem (DSZ Forsberg)
2.  Toggle Receiving Bulletins.          Currently: On
3.  Toggle Receiving Your Own Messages.  Currently: On
4.  Include Mail to ALL in [Y]our Scan   Currently: On
5.  Toggle New Files Scan.               Currently: On
6.  Toggle QMail Deluxe Reader Menu.     Currently: On
7.  Set Maximum Size of MESSAGES.DAT.    Currently: Unlimited
8.  Set Conferences, Message Pointers.
9.  Set All Pointers to the High Message.


Enter your Selection or [Enter] to Return:

   You won't have to answer each option, the defaults will be all
you need.  The important ones that you must customize are number 1.
Transfer Protocol AND number 8. Set Conferences, Message pointers.
Setting these two to match your needs will, generally, be enough to get
you started receiving mail.

   Let's look at the choices one at a time.  Beginning with the first.
Your protocol.  The available choices are as follows:

     1.  Zmodem (DSZ Forsberg)
     2.  1K-Xmodem-G (Full Flow)  <--- requires an MNP modem on each end
     3.  Ymodem Batch
     4.  1K-Xmodem (Old Ymodem)
     5.  Xmodem-CRC

   Make sure at this point that your terminal protocol matches what you
choose; otherwise it won't work.

   Options 2 through 6 are simple on - off type setups.

2.  Toggle Receiving Bulletins.          Currently: On

   This allows you to receive updated bulletins in with the mail packet.
You may enable or disable it as you see fit.

3.  Toggle Receiving Your Own Messages.  Currently: On

   This will allow you to receive copies of messages you leave on the
system in the packet you download.  It's sort of redundant if you ask me
but it's there and it does come in handy at times.

 4.  Include Mail to ALL in [Y]our Scan

   This allows you to include messages addressed to ALL in with Your
messages.  This is for conferences that you select to only scan for your
mail.

 5.  Toggle New Files Scan.               Currently: On

   This is supposed to do a search for new files that have been uploaded
since your last log-on.  It may or may not be enabled depending on the
SysOp.

6.  Toggle QMail Deluxe Reader Menu.     Currently: On

   This option is only valid if you are using the Qmail Deluxe reader;
another off-line style reader.

   Now we start getting into the heart of this operation.

7.  Set Maximum Size of MESSAGES.DAT.    Currently: Unlimited

   This tells MarkMail how big the packet should be.  In other words, if
you were new on the system you wouldn't want to have to zip up,
and then attempt to download 100,000 messages.  Note: this "Unlimited"
is still limited by how the SysOp has his system configured.  On Channel
8250 the size of the messages per conference, per packet, is limited
by the baud rate of your modem.

Baud rate:     Max Messages per Conference:      Max. Messages per Pack:
----------     ----------------------------      -----------------------
  1200                   200                             400
  2400                   200                             800
  9600                   200                            1000
 19200                   200                            1000
 38400                   200                            1000

8.  Set Conferences, Message Pointers.

   This option allows you to set the message pointers for each
conference that you want to scan.  Picking this option will get you a
conference listing.

                   Channel 8250 Conference Listing

                    * = All Mail    # = Your Mail     Sort: Numerical

         0 *Main Board        10 *TELIX             20 *NETCHAT
         1 *EZNET             11 *AMIGA
         2  BREEZIN           12 *CURRENT
         3  IBM               13 *ATARI-ST
         4 #PROGRAMM          14  FEDUP
         5 *AGNOSTIC          15  MEDICAL
         6 *SPORTS            16 #HARDWARE
         7 *STUDENTS          17 *C-ASM
         8  REVIEWS           18  DATABASE
         9 *SCI-TECH          19 *FIREARMS

Enter Your Choice or [L]ist, [S]ort?

   Choose the number of the Conference you wish to receive mail from.
You will then be asked if you wish to receive A)ll, Y)ours or N)one.
Remember the Y)our can include messages addressed to ALL as well as
Yours via option number 4.

   If you make a conference selection you will be asked if you wish to
reset the conference pointer.  The system will list, Last message read
and High message for your approval; you may accept the current
selection or enter a new pointer number.  If you make a mistake,
simply select the conference again and then answer the question again.

   Finally you have the option of,

9.  Set All Pointers to the High Message.

   This scans through ALL the selected conferences and resets the
pointers to the high message value.  Convenient if you are new on the
system and wish to start fresh.

   Once the configuration is complete, you can return to the main prompt
by hitting <Enter>.  To recieve a mail packet just enter 'D' for
Download.  The system will scan the message bases and collect the data.

   If you answer with 'Y' the system will ZIP the messages up and begin
the download sequence.  You will, in turn, initiate your download
sequence from your terminal program.  Viola!  You now have a Mail
packet.  Later, once you've read and replied as you saw fit, you will
want to upload your replies to the system.  Again, after opening the
Mail DOOR, enter 'U' at the Main prompt.  The system will wait for you
to begin your upload sequence and the upload begins.  After completion
you will see the system post your messages.  All messages will be
seperated and posted in the proper conference with the security you
selected for each, intact.

   Q or Quit returns you to the Main Board.  And that boys and girls is
how simple it is to enter the world of off-line mail reading.

   "Wait a minute," you may say.  "Now that I've got the mail packet,
what the Hell do I do with it?"

   A very good question.  In it's zipped format there is not much you
can do with it.  That is where a good off-line reader such as EZReader
comes in.  And I'll tell you all about it . . . next month.

   At this publication, only two boards in the Birmingham area support
MarkMail.  They are Channel 8250 and  Alter-Ego.  Bulletin number 5 on
Channel 8250 can give you even more information on MarkMail.

   If you frequent other boards and see the need for a mail DOOR,
contact the SysOp and let them know.

BASIC Programming
Part 2
by Stephen Davis

Part 1 of 2

     Have you ever wanted someone to talk to but no one wanted to
listen? The computer will.  In this lesson if you ever get tired of
BASIC programming because you have trouble with something, run this
program.  By the way, in this program there are some variables that we
learned last week to use.  Type this in.

10 CLS
20 PRINT"Hi.  I am your computer therapist!!"
30 PRINT"What is your name?"
40 INPUT N$
50 PRINT"What is on your mind, ";n$;"?"
60 INPUT n$
70 PRINT"Very Interesting. . . Tell me more."
80 goto 60

     Now type RUN.

     Go ahead and tell the computer what is on your mind.  When you are
finished, hit the BREAK key to end the program.  Using this program,
lets learn something.  It is annoying to have to hit the BREAK key to
end the program.  There should be a better way.  Take a look at the
following line.

IF N$="Thats all" THEN END

     What do you think this line will do?  Well let's find out.  Line 10
clears the computer screen.  If you are using  an Apple, then you need
to use HOME.  Line 20 is just an easy PRINT statement that we learned
last month.  If you need to review, you may.  Line 30 Is also an easy
PRINT statement.  Line 40 is an variable.  Last month we learned about
variables and how they work.  Let me go over it again.  The INPUT tells
the computer to remember someting.  The N$ tells the computer what to
remember.  You do not have to use N.  You can use any letter. Line 50 is
also an easy PRINT statement until you get to the end of the line.
First there is the question, "What is on your mind?".  We should already
know how to do that.  Then (") show up.  They tell the computer that
that is the end of the line. The next thing is the (;).  They tell the
computer that something else needs to be printted out on the same line.
The N$ gets the information that you stored in memory and displays it.
The other (;) tells the computer that is all you need from memory and
the (") tell the computer that you are about to print something else
out.  That is followed by another (") to end the line.  The next line is
the same as line 40.  Line 70 is another PRINT statement and line 80 is
the GOTO statement that tells the computer to goto whatever line you
want, in this case line 60. The last line is a big problem.  As you can
see the program will keep going over and over.  If we look at the line,
it says GOTO line 60.  Line 60 is INPUT N$ which is the line before is
your name.  Line 70 asks the question "Very Interesting. . . Tell me
more?".  What if you told the computer all you had to say?  That is were
the If N$="That's all" Then END comes end.  First let me tell you where
we put it in the program. Since we are going back to line 60 you do not
want to put it anywhere in front of line 60.  And you also do not want
to put it after line 80 because it would not ever make it to that line
because line 80 says GOTO line 60. You really do not want to put it
between line 60 and 70 because it wouldn't ask the question in line 70.
So the only place it would make since it line 75.  But there is no line
75.  Right!  You have to make one.  So put line 75 and type:

75 IF N$="That's All" THEN END

     I do need to tell you how it works.  But first I must tell you why
line 80 says GOTO 60 and not 70.  The reason for that is because if it
went to line 70 the program would not stop and it would keep printing
out line 70. Now let me tell you about line 75.  First the IF N$ just
tells that If N$ equaled "That's All", then the program would end.

Part 2 of 2

"< " and ">"

     The greater than and less than signs are really very easy to use
once you learn.  Let's get right to learning this.  In the program above
we said If N$="That's All" Then end.  The greater than and less than
signs are used in the same way.  Look at this program:

10 CLS     (HOME for Apple)
20 PRINT"Let's play a math game."
30 PRINT"You type in a number I will tell you if it is less or greater
         than 50."
40 PRINT"Type in a number"
50 INPUT N
60 IF N > 50 THEN PRINT"That is more than 50"
70 IF N < 50 THEN PRINT"That is less than 50"
80 END

     First let me tell you why there is just N and not N$.  Because when
you are using numbers you just use plain letters.  If you are using
letters or words you use a letter and then $.  Let's get to the program.
The first 5 lines you should know.  Line 60 is just like the other
program.  Line 60 tells if N (or the number that line 50 remembered from
line 40)Is greater than print it is more.  For line 70, it is just the
opposite.  If it is less than 50 then print that is is less.  And line
80 ends the program

     That will be all for this issue.  I think this is a little harder
than the last time and I do not want to teach you hard stuff all at
once.  See you next issue.

Music Reviews
by Tyros

Alphaville              ***             The Singles Collection
        A "best of" collection from one of England's original '80s
        synth pop bands.  Hint - there's only four real songs here.
        It's more of a maxi-maxi-single, with remixes and extended
        versions rounding out the B-side.  Pretty good stuff among its
        own breed.


Asia                    ***             Asia
Asia                    ** 1/2          Alpha
Asia                    **              Astra
        Very pompous-sounding synthesizer rock.  Like you'd expect, the
        earlier stuff sounds better than the latter.  The good stuff is
        catchy, the bad stuff just sort of sits there. I used to love
        these guys because I thought Asia typified the quality of music
        that came out in the early 1980s.  Now I don't like it so much
        because I realize that Asia typified the quality of music that
        came out in the early 1980s.


B-52's                  ****            Wild Planet
        Warning!  You probably won't enjoy this one unless you play it
        really loud.  It's an excellent collection of dance tunes that
        still manage to sound somewhat eclectic - not to say zany and
        just all-around fun.  It's from 1980, so be prepared to look
        around a bit for it.


Bangles                 *** 1/2         Bangles
Bangles                 ****            All Over The Place
Bangles                 *** 1/2         Different Light
Bangles                 ***             Everything
        No kidding!  This stuff is actually good!  And I'll tell you
        why the Bangles have such a silly press image - it's because of
        that ditsy Susanna Hoffs.  Not only did she embarass the band,
        and was probably the cause of the break-up, but she also writes
        some of the group's lamest material, i.e. the stuff that you
        hear on the radio. Ignore the "Eternal Flame"s, and listen hard
        to the rest - well-written punchy California pop-rock that was
        meant for better things than "Walk Like An Egyptian".


Benatar, Pat            ** 1/2          Tropico
Benatar, Pat            ***             Seven The Hard Way
        More misses than hits here.  When she tries to be catchy and
        engaging, it works, but the forays into "serious rock and
        roll" end up sounding silly and/or dull.  Joan Jett she ain't.


Blondie                 *** 1/2         The Best of Blondie
        Okay, so some early-80's music is okay.  Blondie, the band,
        shines best when it's being guitar-heavy and lyric-strange, as
        in the earlier songs.  This being a best-of collection, you get
        most of the good stuff.


Blow Monkeys            **              Animal Magic
        I remember seeing these guys in MTV.  Their lead singer is
        about the most unattractive human being I've ever seen, and he
        manages to preen and make jazz-faces along with the worst of
        them.  The horns and cocktail-arrangements notwithstanding,
        this is just another one of Those British Groups, circa 1984 or
        so.  This happens to be a best-of compilation, for what it's
        worth.


BoDeans, The            *** 1/2         Outside Looking In
        I don't care where these guys grew up or went to school, it
        still sounds bluesy to me, at least in places.  About 35%
        gritty bar rock, courtesy of Sammy BoDean's gravely vocals, the
        rest is standard college rootsy-sounding fare.  That 35% makes
        it worth it, though, and the rest isn't so bad.


Boston                  ****            Boston
Boston                  *** 1/2        Don't Look Back
Boston                  ****            Third Stage
        Boston's studio-polished redefinition of guitar rock doesn't
        age as well as it ought to, but it's still the penultimate of
        anything in its class.  Third Stage, despite what the critics
        said, was as good as anything Boston ever did - the added 1980s
        sheen makes it sparkle in ways earlier albums never did or
        could.


Bourgeous Tagg          **              Yoyo
        Pretty much a Squeeze clone with some Beatles sprinkled in for
        good measure, courtesy of producer Todd Rundgren.  There are a
        couple of nice tracks, but the rest is emminently forgettable.


Bowie, David            ***             Never Let Me Down
        Held up to overly high expectations, this album - Bowie's last
        solo effort - didn't please critics at all.  Nonetheless, it's
        got some good stuff, and while dieheard Bowie fans may curl
        their lips, the rest of you should pick it up if you see it in
        the bargain bin.


Brickell, Edie & New Bohemians          Shooting Rubberbands at the Stars
                        ****
        This one has gotten some undeservedly bad press for being so
        gosh-darn trendy, and is exactly the sort of music that Dean
        Costello loves to hate.  What it really is is a collection of
        finely written, finely produced guitar-pop tunes with hints of
        Rickie Lee Jones.  Nary a miss in the bunch.


Bush, Kate              *** 1/2         The Whole Story
Bush, Kate              ***             The Sensual World
        Music that is sorta good, but you can't really put your finger
        on why.  A lot of the later stuff is ethereal and whispery,
        but on The Whole Story, a lot more eclecticity (is that a
        word?) shines, stuff that you can play and have mom walk in and
        ask who the hell it is.


Camper Van Beethoven    ****            Our Beloved Revolutionary Sweetheart
Camper Van Beethoven    ***             Key Lime Pie
        Quirky catchy pop around which revolves nearly anything
        American and progressive.  The former's title (and song
        "Tania") is a cute tribute to Patty Hearst; the latter, a
        little mopier, features an engaging cover of Status Quo's
        "Pictures of Matchstick Men."


Cervenka, Exene         ***             Old Wives' Tales
        After listening to this one, it's a wonder that Exene didn't
        turn into that month's Alternative Female Icon - this album is
        full of folksy, introspective tunes that speak a far cry from
        her days with the LA post-punk band X.  Not bad for what it is.


Church, The             ***             Starfish
        U2 with their chins in the gutter, Simple Minds with a
        different pop sensibility.  Some of the songs are neat until
        the fourth or fifth listen; I still like the minor radio-hit
        "Under The Milky Way".


Chicago                 **              Chicago IX
Chicago                 **              If You Leave Me Now
Chicago                 * 1/2           Chicago 16
        Ten years ago, I thought they were gods.  Not only have I
        wised up, but I've also successfully passed through that stage
        where you disown the new stuff but still try to claim that they
        were "progressive pop" in the early 70s.  "25 or 6 to 4"
        doesn't sound nearly as good as it did in junior high, and
        everyone had long hair until 1975.


Cockburn, Bruce         ***             Stealing Fire
        It took me forever to realize this guy was a Jackson Browne
        clone. Nonetheless, it's worth picking up for a couple of
        bucks if you still remember "If I Had A Rocket Launcher".
        Sparse Canadian AOR from the trendier side of the tracks.


Costello, Elvis         *** 1/2         The Best of Elvis Costello
                                        and the Attractions
        My first introduction to the King.  On the whole, what I
        expected, pretty much; sophisticated sofa pop tunes from a guy
        who coulda used a different voice a long time ago, but it
        doesn't matter now.


Crowded House           ****            Crowded House
Crowded House           ****            Temple of Low Men
        <Sigh>... It seems I use the term "pop" too much, and in too
        pleasant an inflection.  No matter - despite all the
        intelligent, well-written, exquisitely produced, non-
        commercial, non-comformist er, "pop" music out there, this is
        the cream of the crop.  Neil Finn used to be in Splint Enz -
        now he's writing some of the best music of the last ten years.
        Catchy sustenance from a barely tortured soul.


Cult, The               *** 1/2         Electric
        This is the pre-MTV Cult.  It's likely to sound all the same
        to you if you haven't kept up, but Electric presents some
        choice meaty slices of hard rock that you won't be ashamed to
        listen to.


Cure, The               *** 1/2         Staring at the Sea: The Singles
        A decade's worth of selections from England's most
        depressed-but-not-really outfit.  This is the sort of stuff
        taken from albums that all made it big in the UK, but went
        nowhere here except the floorboard behind the back seat of the
        rusty Impala owned by that strange skateboarding kid friend of
        your brother's.  The catchy stuff is fine; the mopey stuff is,
        well, okay if you go in for that kind of thing.


Danny Wilson            *** 1/2         Meet Danny Wilson
        Give me another month or so and I'll have this one pegged with
        four stars.  Danny Wilson is not a person, it's a band, and one
        quite adept at lifting the more jazzy inflections of Katy Lied
        era Steely Dan.  Leader Gary Clark always seems to sound a
        little happier than Donald Fagan, though, and the music shows
        it.


David + David          ****             Boomtown
        Heartfelt but intense tales from the wrong side of the street
        in southern California.  The first David, David Baerwald, has
        just released a solo album that may be even better.  One the
        most underrated albums of the '80s.


Depeche Mode           ***              Music for the Masses
Depeche Mode           ** 1/2           Violator
        Another one in the category of "it's great if you like that
        kind of thing." Most radio listeners are more apt to remember
        Alan Wilder's melancholy vocals over Martin Gore's
        mire-goop-synth songwriting, but there IS something here, I
        know there is.  I'll be damned if I know WHAT, though.


Dream Academy           *** 1/2         Dream Academy
Dream Academy           ***             Remembrance Days
        Beware of British bands with the word "Dream" in their names
        and the sound of crashing waves superimposed in the music.  A
        minor chapter in Great Reagan/Thatcher Era Music, of course,
        but still potent guitar pop with leanings toward what I
        consider the British equivalent of "folk" but still haven't
        come up with a name for. The former LP is produced by Dave
        Gilmour; the latter by Lindsay Buckingham.


Echo & The Bunnymen     ***             Porcupine
        There is ONE song on here, one song that I like a lot - it's
        called "The Cutter", and it's a wild brash arnarchic pop song
        that you can dance to while cleaning house.  The rest is
        regrettably pale imitations of "The Cutter".  Frankly, if you
        really WANT an Echo & The Bunnymen album (and I know you do), I
        recommend either the experimental Ocean Rain or the compilation
        Songs To Learn and Sing. I just picked the wrong one.

INTEXT12.ZIP  . .  .   .   .   .178,254   05-01-90

Name: INTEXT Multilingual Word Processor

Purpose: Multilingual Word Processing

System requirements: Although not much was said about requirements
INTEXT can be run on a single floppy (360K) system, dual floppies or
hard drive.  INTEXT supports CGA or Hercules displays. A variety
of printers are supported.

  Features:
  Editing; Printing; File Utilities(copy, merge, delete, rename)
  Many W/P functions such as: search/replace string, find string,
  global string replace, justify, etc..
  Editing in English, and at least one other language at the same
  time.
  Enhanced printing codes (underline/bold).

   SOME of the languages supported are:
    Arabic   Russian       Spanish
    Greek    Turkish       Polish
    Hebrew   Urdu          European (British, French, Italian...)
    Farsi    Yugoslavian
    Gaelic   German

Intext uses many of the ASCII characters in the editor.  Of course
for some languages like Arabic it has to create a whole new set of
fonts for the screen and printer.  You can toggle between English and
another language to edit a single document and have both languages in
the same document.  The other languages (English is always a base
lang.) are loaded as modules and you can only have one module loaded
at a time.  When you load a new language module some of its files
will overwrite  the previous module's files.
*Text files created with INTEXT may only be viewed while you are
 using INTEXT or if you print them while inside the INTEXT editor.

Also, there is information available through INTEXT about many other
"third-party" software applications.
I.e.: MS-DOS in Arabic, Chinese, etc.

Fractint: Part 2
a review by Eric Hunt

     This month, I delved deeper into the features of Fractint and found
several interesting things. First, there are LOTS more fractal types to
choose from other than the Mandelbrot and Julia sets. One of the most
interesting fractal types is the Barnsley IFS "fern." This is a fractal
that is quite different from the rest: it looks just like a fern, a very
beautiful rendition of one, also. Another fractal type available that is
more widely heard of is the Newton's domain of attraction, which
visualizes the Newton method for solving equations higher than the
second power. One of the most interesting fractal types is the Plasma
cloud. Quoted from the manual (I couldn't do any better): "'Plasma
Clouds' are generated by a recursive algorithm that randomly picks
colors of the corner of a rectangle, and then continues recursively
quartering previous rectangles. Random colors are averaged with those of
the outer rectangles in such a way that small neighborhoods do not show
much change, resulting in th e effect of clouds." The image itself is
rather uninteresting until it is color cycled! The color cycling will
totally mesmerize you! It also makes wonderful 3-D transformations, but
more on that later. There are many more fractal types available, but I
have not had the time, nor inclination to generate them, for the
Mandelbrot and Julia sets are enough to keep me busy for a while.

     Another exciting feature of Fractint is the ability to take plain
2-D fractal images and turn them into exciting 3-D plots. When I
selected the 3-D transformation option by pressing '3,' it asked me for
a startup filename. I used the filename for one of the plasma clouds.
Many MANY questions are asked, and all of them control a certain aspect
of the 3-D transformation. Questions range from the X, Y, and Z rotation
in space of the fractal, to mapping it on a globe, to how high the
"water" should be. the responses are better off being left with the
default values. A note on the sphere option: don't select it unless you
plan to take a good long trip and are leaving the computer on. When the
plasma cloud transformation was complete, I was overwhelmed again! It
looked like an alien landscape done in 256 glorious shades of Red,
Green, and Blue. The colors can be changed back in the Fractint program
to suit your taste.

     Fractint also supports generating fractals in a 16bit TARGA format.
It will also take the TARGA file and make a very good 3-D transformation
from it. Watch out, though, using the TARGA option, you need AT LEAST
1/2 a meg of disk space for the file that will be generated.

     This part of the review was short - many of the advanced functions
I have not fully explored, due to the fact that they can take DAYS to
finish - DAYS I couldn't be modeming around - my favorite hobby, besides
watching fractals "grow."

     For more reading on Fractals, and the parent subject to Fractals,
Chaos theory, here are a few books available:

CHAOS: MAKING A NEW SCIENCE by James Gleick. ISBN 0-14-009250-1. 		Paperback $11.95

THE FRACTAL GEOMETRY OF NATURE by Benoit Mandelbrot
	Bristol: Adam Hilger 1984

THE BEAUTY OF FRACTALS by Heinz-Otto Peitgen and Peter H. Richter
	Berlin: Springer - Verlag 1986

NONLINEAR DYNAMICS AND CHAOS by H. Bruce Stewart and J. M. Thompson
	Chichester: Weiley 1986

And finally, the August 1990 issue of SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN has a good
article on Fractals. It might still be on the newsstand, but I doubt it.

EzNet Multiple Echo List

     EzNet now supports multiple conference echoing but there are a few
things you should be aware of regarding private mail.

  A. You have one 'address' for private mail.  If you are registered for
     private mail on Channel 8250 and someone sends you a private
     message in the MS-DOS conference from Crunchy Frog it will wind
     up in the Hardware conference on Channel 8250 as it should.

     However, if you were registered for private mail on Magnolia and
     someone sends you a private message in a conference that Magnolia
     does not support (echo) then the message will wind up in the
     twilight zone.

  B. If you go by a handle on one BBS and your real name on another even
     if the private message goes where it is supposed to, you will not
     be able to read it because it is addressed to someone else as far
     as PC Board is concerned.  PC Board has no way of knowing that Red
     Foxx and John Doe are the same person. No tickee, no washee.

     Advice on sending private mail: If you don't know if the person you
are sending private mail to is registered for private mail then keep a
copy of the message in case you have to find an alternate route. EzNet
Central will delete your private, undelivered message and inform you
that the user you attempted to reach is not registered for private mail
on any EzNet Node.

     This is a list of the current echoes that I am aware of.  More are
in the making and will be posted in future issues.  If you are a sysop
and are running an echo not listed for your board, please make us aware
of it so we may correct it next issue.
