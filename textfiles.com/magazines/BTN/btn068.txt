    ################################################################



    To paraphrase Homer Simpson:

    Can't talk, editing.

    Oh, well, all right.  I'll say a few things, particularly since,
for a change, there *are* a couple of things to say.

    First of all, for the benefit of our Buddhist monk reader from
Tibet, who noticed, *correct!* -- There was no BTN for April.  What was
the cause of this?  A cruel April Fool's joke played upon the whole of
Western civilization?  Nay, 'twas merely the end result of a number of
different factors, foremost among being that yours truly was in bed with
a nasty stomach bug.  (Having just read Stephen King's _The Stand_, I'm
contacting my congressman before it's too late.  <gasp!>)  Hopefully,
no one was too unduly distressed by our missing a mere month.

    Also, I'd like to say a word in memory of Channel 8250, which
suffered catastrophic BBS failure and passed away this month.  For some
time, Channel 8250 was the home of the Breezin' conference, which it
inherited from Birmingham RCP/M some years back.  If you've read every
single word ever published in BTN, you've no doubt heard some of us wax
nostalgiac about Breezin', which I consider the first true cozy little
BBS hangout.  8250 was first put up by Ed O'Neill, and passed on after a
couple of years to Randy Hilliard.  Kudos for Randy Hilliard for being
one of the most stick-to-itive sysops in town.

    Okay, that's it.  I've put this off for far too long as it is.  Next
month, then!

    ################################################################
    SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

    ################################################################


I. ARTICLE LENGTH

    Right now, there's no strict enforcement of a length restriction,
but if your submission is somewhat short, I may request that you make it
longer.  Anyone can sit down and type out a screen's worth of stuff.  I
have yet to encounter an article that was too *long*, so don't worry
about that.


II. SUBJECT MATTER

    Again, there's no hard-and-fast rules about subject matter.  I'm
interested in seeing material on a wide variety of topics.  That
includes BBSs, politics, music, books, or better yet, something that
doesn't neatly fall into any one category.  Next to that, my favorite
articles are the ones that have something to do with BBSing, since that
is supposedly what we're sort of about.  Technical reviews are also
good.  I tend to kind of frown on fiction, but I'm willing to take a
look at anything you've got.  If it's interesting enough, your chances
are good.
    Politics is fine, but try not to rant--and make whatever you have to
say original.  I can go out and find ten Rush Limbaughs if I want.
    Also refrain from "This Is What Happened To Me Today" slice-of-life
articles unless it's leading somewhere good.
    Reviews should be both informative and opinionated.  Don't be too
objective, but still tell us about what you're reviewing.


III. FILE FORMAT

    Plain and simple ASCII is preferred, but we can convert WordPerfect
files if need be.


IV. STYLE GUIDELINES

1.  Use a right margin of 72 columns.
2.  Indent paragraphs at the fifth column.
3.  Put two spaces after each sentence.
4.  Skip a line after each paragraph.
5.  Refrain from using BBS-specific devices like "<grin>" and ":-)".
6.  Be sure to give your article a title.
7.  Try to use correct grammar, spelling and capitalization!  My staff
    proofread as best as we can, but a well-typed article makes our job
    easier.
8.  The dash is correctly typed as two hyphens, like "--".  Use it to
    set apart phrases and clauses--as with this sentence.
9.  To emphasize a word, place a pair of asterisks around it, like
    *this*.  This takes the place of italics (except for titles; see
    12).
10. If you have to emphasize a group of words, use capitals, AS IN THIS
    EXAMPLE.  I generally don't like the way that looks, so use it
    sparingly, if at all.
11. If you're unsure whether to spell out a number or not, leave it in
    numeral form.
12. Titles of books, films, plays, albums and works of art are
    surrounded by underlines, like: U2's _The Joshua Tree_.  This takes
    the place of italics in this regard; I call it "title-cizing".
    On the other hand, television shows, songs, poems, article titles
    and short stories are surrounded by quotation marks.


V. HOW DO I SUBMIT AN ARTICLE?

    The easiest way is to upload it as a private file on one of two
systems: The Matrix and the Crunchy Frog.  (Their phone numbers are
listed at the end of this feature.)  To upload a file privately, begin
your file description with a slash ("/").  Then leave me (SCOTT
HOLLIFIELD) a private message telling me what the file name is, so that
I can have the sysop make it available for me.
    Another way is to leave me the article as a private message, or a
series of private messages.
    If you become a regular contributor to BTN, you can get access to
the private BTNWA conference, which is for BTN writers.  There we
discuss articles, policy, ideas, etc.  The BTNWA conference also
contains a private file directory which I can access more easily than a
private file outside BTNWA.

    That's it!

    Get to work!

    CAN AMERICA FIND
    HAPPINESS USING

    OR,

    AHH, NOW THIS IS WHAT I WAS THINKING OF...


    I didn't mean to write a follow-up series when I started this.  My
only concern was correcting the "conventional wisdom" that the
Information Superhighway and the Internet are synonymous.  (The idea
from the last article is that the Information Superhighway (IS) is
merely a means by which businesses will be deregulated to allow them all
equal access to information sources and routes of transmission.)
However, a couple of days ago, I came across a small document called
HR-1757, whose purpose is, "to provide for a coordinated Federal program
to accelerate development and dissemination of applications of
high-performance computing and high-speed networking, and for other
purposes."  I don't know about you, but I know that when I read it, I
went, "hmmm...".

    The document that I was reading is called The National Information
Infrastructure Act (NIIA).  Are you getting excited?  You should.
Apparently, many others have.  As it happens, during the course of 1993
the U.S. Congress came to a series of conclusions:

      (1) high-performance computing and high-speed networks (HPC/HSN)
    have proven to be powerful tools for improving national security,
    industrial competitiveness, research capabilities, and ability to
    make a wide range of information available for many applications;

      (2) Federal programs, such as the High-Performance Computing
    Program and National Research and Education Network established in
    1991, are vital to United States leadership in HPC/HSN;

      (3) HPC/HSN have the potential to expand ones access to
    information in many fields, including education, libraries,
    government information dissemination, and health care;

      (4) HPC/HSN have the potential to expand opportunities for
    participation for Americans who have disabilities and to improve
    equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and
    economic self-sufficiency for Americans with disabilities;

      (5) the Federal Government should ensure that the applications
    achieved through research and development efforts such as the
    High-Performance Computing Program directly benefit all Americans;

      (6) the Federal Government should stimulate the development
    of computing and networking applications and support wider access to
    network resources so that the benefits of applications so developed
    can reach the intended users throughout the Nation, including users
    with disabilities; and

      (7) a coordinated, interagency undertaking is needed
    to identify and promote applications of computing and networking
    advances developed by the High-Performance Computing Program which
    will provide large economic and social benefits to the Nation,
    including new tools for teaching, the creation of digital libraries
    of electronic information, the development of standards and
    protocols to make the stores of government information readily
    accessible by electronic means, and computer systems to improve the
    delivery of health care.

    And thusly the National Information Infrastructure (NII) is born.
But, if we are going to continue, I guess I had better define a term or
two.  The information infrastructure is more than just the physical
facilities used to transmit, store, process, and display voice, data,
and images.  It encompasses things like cameras, scanners, keyboards,
telephones, fax machines, computers, switches, compact disks, video and
audio tape, cable, wire, satellites, optical fiber transmission lines,
microwave nets, televisions, monitors, printers,...well, you get the
idea.

    The NII will integrate and interconnect these physical components in
a technologically neutral manner so that no one industry will be favored
over any other.  Most importantly, the NII requires building
foundations for living in the Information Age and for making these
technological advances useful to the public, business, libraries, and
other nongovernmental entities.  That is why, beyond the physical
components of the infrastructure, the value of the NII to users and the
nation will depend in large part on the quality of its other elements

1.  Data.  Information may be in the form of video programming,
    scientific or business databases, images, sound recordings,
    library archives, and other media.  Vast quantities of that
    information exist today in government agencies and even more
    information is produced every day in laboratories, studios,
    publishing houses, and elsewhere.

2.  Software.  Applications and software that allow users to
    access, manipulate, organize, and digest the proliferating
    mass of information that the NII's facilities will put at
    their fingertips.

3.  Standards.  The network standards and transmission codes that
    facilitate interconnection and interoperation between networks,
    and ensure the privacy of persons and the security of the
    information carried, as well as the security and reliability
    of the networks.

4.  Users.  People, largely in the private sector, who create the
    information, develop applications and services, construct the
    facilities, and train others to tap its potential.  Many of
    these people will be vendors, operators, and service providers
    working for private industry.

    There is no way around it.  Information is one of the nation's most
critical economic resources, for service industries as well as
manufacturing, for economic as well as national security.  Now that
there are truly global markets and global competition, the technologies
to create, manipulate, use information are of great importance to us.

    The president, therefore, now has a mandate to spread information to
the Teeming Masses.  The idea is to get together a group, called the
Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering, and Technology,
whose job is to make the above possible.  As a result, a plan of action
is required as part of the NIIA to describe how to achieve the goals as
outlined by Congress.  The plan has many different components, ranging
from who is to be trained to who has responsibility for what to security
concerns. I am going to just address a couple here.

    The plan shall include programs administered by the National Science
Foundation (NSF) to foster the development of network services in local
communities which will connect institutions of education at all levels,
libraries, museums, and State and local governments to each other; and
provide funds for the purchase of network services to entities described
in paragraph (1), or organizations representing such entities, to
connect to the Internet.  Such programs shall include funding for the
acquisition of required hardware and software and for the establishment
of broadband connections to the Internet.

    The plan shall also include programs administered by NSF and other
appropriate agencies to train teachers, students, librarians, and
government personel in the use of computer networks and the Internet, as
well as provide training materials needed by librarians to instruct the
public in the use of computer networks and the Internet.

    So, we finally get to the Internet.  But note that the Internet is
not the only thing that is scheduled to be used.  Various kinds of
networks are scheduled to be employed in the NII.  It appears, though,
that the Internet will be a nice place to start.

    The plan shall specify research programs needed to create means to
ensure the security and privacy of transmissions over the Internet and
the integrity of digital information accessed via the Internet and to
facilitate the management and protection of copyrighted information
which is accessed via the Internet.  I wonder, though, how the security
and privacy issues are going to be addressed, given the proposed use of
the Clipper chip.  The trustworthiness and security of communications
channels and networks are essential to the success of the NII.  Users
must be assured that information transmitted over the infrastructure
will go when and where it is intended to go.  Electronic information
systems can create new vulnerabilities.  For example, electronic files
can be broken into and copied from remote locations, and cellular phone
conversations can be monitored easily.  Through the use of information
systems, gathering, sending, and receiving a wide variety of personal
information is now simple, quick, and relatively inexpensive.

    The use of information technologies to access, modify, revise,
repackage, and resell information can benefit individuals, but
unauthorized use can encroach on their privacy.  While news reports
often emphasize the role of modern information technology in invading
privacy, technology advances and enhanced management oversight also
offer the opportunity for privacy protection.  This protection is
especially important to businesses that increasingly transmit-sensitive
proprietary data through electronic means.  The confidentiality of this
information can spell the difference between business success or
failure.  This can very easily become an ugly little problem in the
future.

    In addition, it is essential that the Federal government work with
the communications industry to reduce the vulnerability of the nation's
information infrastructure.  The NII must be designed and managed in a
way that minimizes the impact of accident or sabotage.  The system must
also continue to function in the event of attack or catastrophic natural
disaster.  We don't want any more ugly little "Internet Worms", now do
we?

    The plan shall specify research programs needed to develop and
demonstrate human/computer interfaces that will simplify access to and
use of the Internet by nonspecialists in computer and networking
technologies and by individuals with disabilities.  As I tried to tell
you last time, the Internet in its present form isn't really designed
with you, the average user, in mind.  But as you can see, a facelift is
apparently in the making.  I am curious whether it will be an
infrastructure change (basic alterations in the Internet) or if better
communications software will be developed.

    Lets look at libraries for a minute.  There is a subsection of the
plan that deals with the concept of the digital library.  Research is
being conducted into how to make a virtual library a real thing and not
just a clever idea.  The first item that is talked about is advanced
data storage.  The digital library concept is looking at storing
hundreds of terabytes (trillion) of information, and it just isn't
practical to have a couple thousand 2-gigabyte harddrives.  Other
concepts that are being examined include the development of high-speed,
high-accuracy scanning processes, development of database software that
very quickly (think of the amount of data that is necessary to go
through) searches, filters, and summarizes not just text, but images,
data, and sound.

    The most exciting area that I see is the Federal Information Locator
(FIL).  The idea runs like this:  You need a bit of information; say you
are looking for the number of abortions that took place in 1977 as a
result of incest.  The FIL will provide not just a citation of where the
data can be found, but will also give guidance on how to obtain that
information.  This is the solution of a pet peeve of mine.  I am an
environmental scientist, and have a lot of dealings with EPA.  There are
scads of information that are generated by EPA on a yearly basis (we are
talking thousands of documents, people).  And remember, I (as a
taxpayer) have already paid for the information.  However, most of the
documents go directly to the National Technical Information Service
(NTIS) in Springfield, VA, where I have to pay $10-$90 for the
information.  So, I am forced to pay for that data twice.  I like to
think that the FIL will eliminate the payment requirement.

    Anyway, as you can well imagine, there is more to it than what I
extracted above.  There's still research projects in the making,
applications to health care (surgical virtual reality is an intriguing
sidebar), use in education (imagine taking an astronomy class with Carl
Sagan as your instructor), and means of adapting hunks of this to
private industry.

    One more thing I would like to touch on is the concept of "Universal
Service".  The Communications Act of 1934 stated, in very general terms,
a national goal of "Universal Service" for telephones: widespread
availability of a basic communications service at affordable rates.  A
major objective in developing the NII will be to extend the Universal
Service concept to the information needs of the American people in the
21st Century.  As a matter of fundamental fairness, I cannot see how we
can accept a division of the society, among information "haves" and
"have-nots."  The Administration has committed to developing a modern
concept of Universal Service, one that would emphasize giving all who
desire it easy, affordable access to advanced communications and
information services, regardless of income, disability, or location.
Whether or not this will happen strikes me as somewhat doubtful.

    Its a brave new world out there these days.  As a BBS user, you can
consider yourselves as a part of a new wave of technology application,
but don't think that this is the end-all, be-all of communications.
There's more a'comin'.  It's no time to be a Luddite.

    GOVERNMENT

    ################################################################


     While politics is often an intriguing game of tradeoffs between the
desires of government and the desires of its citizens, the desires of
government have begun to take preclusive precedence over the desires of
the citizens.

     I think it's a safe bet to assume that everyone is concerned about
the potential for our rights to erode under the heavy tread of
government.  The U.S. Constitution was written with that possibility in
mind, the American Revolution fought to curtail the British Empire's
abuses on American soil. "Don't tread on me!" our forefathers yelled in
defiance, as they embedded the red, white, and blue U.S. battle flag in
bloody home soil.

     And yet, it would seem as if Benjamin Franklin's worst fears are
being realized more than 200 years later.  We have a republic, but it's
slipping through our fingers...and it's easy to see our rights
diminishing as government reaches out for more and tighter control of
every facet of our lives.

     While examples of this abound, I'll point to what I consider to be
the three most distressing symptoms: gun control, the Clipper/Skipjack
chip, and PGP.

     The gun control issue has been hammered to death, in the news and
in online arguments.  I don't think there's too much more I can add to
it, but I would ask that you seriously consider this issue.  Though it's
a cliche, there is truth in the saying, "If guns are outlawed, only
outlaws will have guns." Believe me, people; it's very easy to obtain
illegal items.  All it takes is money.

     Personally, I don't care much for firearms.  I'm a fairly
aggressive person with a quick temper, aggravated by arrogance and a
cold disdain for anyone that happens to strike me as stupid.  I'm
sufficiently intelligent to realize that my temperment does not mix well
with an ability to immedi- ately inflict death at a distance.

     But it is my responsibility to handle my shortcomings.  It is not
your responsibility or the responsibility of the government to limit me
accord- ing to a hypothetical situation placed at an unspecified point
in the future.  Instead, compare the relative danger involved in two
hypothetical situations: one situation in which I may murder one
individual up to a maximum of several hundred with an assault weapon, or
another situation in which mammoth government brings an unarmed and
helpless populace of millions to its knees.  Truly, you must "fear the
government that fears your guns." Another cliche, another truth.

     The diabolical intent behind the Clipper/Skipjack chip is more
easily discerned.  Your privacy isn't killing anyone, nor does it have
any innate capacity to do so.  Yet, the government is considering
embedding a special computer chip in all communications devices that
will encrypt outgoing and decrypt incoming messages, insuring the
greatest amount of privacy ever granted to any population of any age.

     The cost?  The Skipjack chip (renamed from "Clipper" to prevent
confusion with the Computer Associates XBase language development
platform of the same name) will have at least one back door by which
means the government may access the content of your communications.
Theoretically, the keys to this back door will be handed over only in
the process of legal proceedings with all due legal authority.

     Considering past abuses by such stars as NSA, FBI, CIA, BATF, among
others, all the way down to your local police department, it should be
unnecessary for me to point out the weaknesses in this theory.  After
the Watergate scandal, trusting the government not to rifle your
belongings is sheer foolishness.

     If you accept the arguments behind the Skipjack chip, it is only a
short stretch to imagine cameras and microphones in the bedroom.  Our
national security may well depend upon the methods you employ to bring
your loved one to orgasm.

     In the same vein, but on another front, the government is currently
taking a severe stance on private citizens possessing military grade
cryptosystems that are not easily -- if at all -- accessible to the
government.

     Phillip Zimmerman is a programmer that took the European-developed
RSA encryption formula (published in 1977) and developed a freeware
program called Pretty Good Privacy in the late 80's.  He uploaded this
program to a U.S.-based Internet FTP site in the wee hours of the
morning.  Not more than 12 minutes later, this program was all over the
world.

     Pretty Good Privacy (known as PGP) offers military grade
encryption to the peanut gallery at no cost.  And not just the
executable file, but the whole kit and kaboodle of full C and ASM source
code, complete with MAKE files for several standard compilers on several
platforms -- in several languages.

     Zimmerman is currently under investigation by the U.S. State
Depart- ment for possible violations of certain munitions export
control laws. This despite the fact that RSA was originally developed
outside the U.S. and the fact that Zimmerman himself did not actually
export anything.

     If indicted, Zimmerman faces the possibility of heavy fines and a
long jail sentence.

     A recent query addressed to Zimmerman via Internet yielded the
following response:

Hello.  Thanks for your email.  I hope you don't mind getting a form
letter reply.  I get so much mail these days.

Let me give you some rubber-stamp answers to some frequently asked
questions about PGP--

1)  The currently released version of PGP is 2.3a.  If you want a list
    of Internet sites and BBS systems that have it, send a note to
    Hugh Miller at hmiller@lucpul.it.luc.edu.  If you have an older
    version of PGP, you really should get updated.  There is a version
    for MSDOS (but not Windows), various Unixes, Macintosh, Amiga,
    Atari ST, VAX/VMS, and IBM mainframes.  The source code is also
    available from public sources.  There are Internet FTP sites and
    many BBS systems that carry PGP.  For other PGP news, see the
    Internet Usenet newsgroups alt.security.pgp, talk.politics.crypto,
    and sci.crypt.  These newsgroups are also a good place to find out
    where to get PGP.  In many cases, there are ways to access these
    newsgroups via email channels.  If you don't know how to get access
    to these newsgroups, ask your local Unix or Internet expert for
    help.  Don't ask me to send you a copy of PGP-- I can't do that, for
    legal reasons.

2)  Often people ask me for a copy of my PGP public key, because
    they aren't sure if the one they have is really my key.  Well, it
    almost certainly is.  I've checked my public key countless times
    with people who call me up, and it's always correct.  My key is so
    widespread that if someone tampered with it, I would surely have
    heard about it by now and would issue announcements to Internet
    newsgroups and electronic Bulletin Board Systems.  My key in
    included in the PGP distribution package, in the file "keys.asc".

3)  Often people ask me to sign their key with mine.  I can't do
    that either, because I don't know those people and it would be
    inappropriate for me to sign a key whose owner I didn't positively
    identify.  This topic is fully explained in the PGP manual.

4)  My new email address is prz@acm.org.  My old email addresses at
    NCAR may not be any good soon, so please use the new one.  And if
    you must encrypt any mail to me, please use my newer key that bears
    the new email address <prz@acm.org> in the user ID field, and not
    the older key that bears the old email address
    <prz@sage.cgd.ucar.edu> in the user ID.

5)  A fully licensed commercial version of PGP is available from
    ViaCrypt, for any users in the USA or Canada.  It's a really nice
    product, and has made absolutely no compromises in PGP's security.
    If you have been reluctant to use PGP because of legal questions,
    ViaCrypt PGP is just what you need.  ViaCrypt has obtained all
    patent licenses needed to sell PGP.  ViaCrypt can be reached in
    Phoenix, Arizona, at phone 1-602-944-0773, email
    <70304.41@compuserve.com>.

6)  I have heard that RSA Data Security, Inc, plans to release
    sometime in the future a new version of RSAREF, their freeware
    subroutine package that performs RSA calculations.  The new RSAREF
    is reportedly designed so that more applications may use it,
    including PGP.  The old RSAREF package is not currently designed to
    allow PGP to use it.  If the new RSAREF is able to be used by PGP,
    that would open the door for PGP to have a freeware version that
    would be licensed to use the RSA algorithm, because RSAREF comes
    with an RSA license that may be used by any application for
    noncommercial purposes.  This would mean that PGP would exist in two
    forms, both of which would be licensed to use the RSA algorithm--
    the freeware version using RSAREF, and the ViaCrypt PGP for
    commercial uses.  We'll have to wait and see how events unfold with
    respect to RSAREF, to see if all this really happens.

7)  For those of you who want to donate money to my legal defense
    fund, please make checks payable to my lead defense attorney: Philip
    L. Dubois, Attorney Trust Account.  Mail them to to Philip Dubois,
    2305 Broadway, Boulder, Colorado, 80304 USA.  Since I am now the
    target of a US Customs criminal investigation that has progressed to
    the level to a Federal grand jury, I need contributions for my legal
    defense.  The subject matter of the investigation relates to PGP and
    the export control laws on cryptographic software.  If you care
    politically about these matters, that would be a good way to show
    it. Thanks.

8)  U.S. House Representative Maria Cantwell has introduced
    legislation (H.R.3627) that would lift all export controls on
    cryptographic software in the US.  This is important because U.S.
    export controls in this area have been used to suppress the
    availability of lawful domestic encryption technology.  Thus,
    Cantwell's bill is important not only to American software export
    competiveness, but more importantly, to our civil liberties.  If you
    live in the USA, please ask your House Representatives to co-sponsor
    H.R. 3627, and get your two U.S. Senators to back it in the Senate
    as well.  The phone number for the U.S. Congress is 202-224-3121.

9)  I am available on a consulting basis to help you develop
    cryptographic products.  That is how I make my living.  If you need
    help in this area, feel free to call me at 303 541-0140, from
    10am-7pm Mountain Time.

I hope that helps.

Subject: PGP defense fund

    As you may already know, on September 14 LEMCOM Systems (ViaCrypt)
in Phoenix, Arizona was served with a subpoena issued by the US District
Court of Northern California to testify before a grand jury and produce
documents related to "ViaCrypt, PGP, Philip Zimmermann, and anyone or
any entity acting on behalf of Philip Zimmermann for the time period
June 1, 1991 to the present."

    Phil Zimmermann has been explicitly told that he is the primary
target of the investigation being mounted from the San Jose office of
U.S. Customs.  It is not known if there are other targets.  Whether or
not an indictment is returned in this case, the legal bills will be
astronomical.

    If this case comes to trial, it will be one of the most important
cases in recent times dealing with cryptography, effective
communications privacy, and the free flow of information and ideas in
cyberspace in the post-Cold War political order. The stakes are high,
both for those of us who support the idea of effective personal
communications privacy and for Phil, who risks jail for his selfless and
successful effort to bring to birth "cryptography for the masses,"
a.k.a. PGP.  Export controls are being used as a means to curtail
domestic access to effective cryptographic tools: Customs is taking the
position that posting cryptographic code to the Internet is equivalent
to exporting it.  Phil has assumed the burden and risk of being the
first to develop truly effective tools with which we all might secure
our communications against prying eyes, in a political environment
increasingly hostile to such an idea -- an environment in which Clipper
chips and Digital Telephony bills are our own government's answer to our
concerns.  Now is the time for us all to step forward and help shoulder
that burden with him.

    Phil is assembling a legal defense team to prepare for the
possibility of a trial, and he needs your help.  This will be an
expensive affair, and the meter is already ticking. I call on all of us,
both here in the U.S. and abroad, to help defend Phil and perhaps
establish a groundbreaking legal precedent.  A legal trust fund has been
established with Phil's attorney in Boulder.  Donations will be accepted
in any reliable form, check, money order, or wire transfer, and in any
currency.  Here are the details:

    To send a check or money order by mail, make it payable, NOT to Phil
Zimmermann, but to Phil's attorney, Philip Dubois.  Mail the check or
money order to the following address:

    Philip Dubois
    2305 Broadway
    Boulder, CO USA  80304
    (Phone #: 303-444-3885)

    To send a wire transfer, your bank will need the following
information:

    Bank: VectraBank
    Routing #: 107004365
    Account #: 0113830
    Account Name: "Philip L. Dubois, Attorney Trust Account"

    Any funds remaining after the end of legal action will be returned
to named donors in proportion to the size of their donations.

    You may give anonymously or not, but PLEASE - give generously.  If
you admire PGP, what it was intended to do and the ideals which animated
its creation, express your support with a contribution to this fund.

Hi David.

    It is not illegal to have PGP available, although the freeware
version of PGP is unlicensed, and therefore may be a violation of a
patent held by RSA Data Securities.  PGP contains an encryption
algorithm (RSA) that is patented.  PGP's author did not get a license to
use the algorithm from the patent holder.  A new freeware version of
RSA, called RSAREF, has recently been released, and future versions of
PGP will call RSAREF and won't be in violation.  In addition, a
commercial version of PGP has recently been released by Viacrypt, which
is ok because Viacrypt holds a RSA license. The short answer is, if you
put the freeware version of PGP on your BBS, you are risking a patent
suit being brought against you by RSA Data Security.

    If you do decide to take that risk, I strongly advise you to put
some sort of restriction on folks from outside of the US from
downloading it. It is most certainly illegal to export PGP.

    Shari

The following appeared in the April 27, 1994 Globe and Mail:

NUMBER CODE CRACKED EONS EARLY

NEW YORK -- The world's ultimate secret code -- a 129 digit combination
that mathematicians had expected would take 40 quadrillion years to
break -- has been cracked in 17.  But it took 600 people on five
continents using 1,600 computers working for eight months to do it.  Dr.
Arjen Lenstar of Bellcore, the Bell Communications Research division,
co-ordinated the attack on the encryption called RSA 129 -- a problem
considered so difficult that some mathematicians joked that discovering
how to walk on water would be easier.

The cracking of code, devised in 1977 by three mathematicians and
computer scientists -- Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman --
has serious implications for business and computer systems that use
numerical codes to protect secrets in electronic databases.  Once the
searchers had discovered the two secret numbers that, when multiplied
together, produced RSA 129, they were able to find a secret message
encrypted: "The magic words are squeamish ossifrage." An ossifrage is a
bird of prey that crushes the bones of its victims.  Mr. Rivest said the
words were chosen at random when the puzzle was devised in 1977.

THE BUGS/THE SHAME IDOLS at The Nick
    Bugs is happy pop stuff thanks to a little guy named Walon.  Shame
Idols is Tim Boykin's personal original band thing in which he
superhumanly manages to play along with his other bands... tons of
them.  They are very good but I wish he'd get more pissed off.

Fri. May 6
    First thing is, avoid the DeadHead show at the Five Points South
Music Hall, which means avoid anything in the area because you won't
get a parking space within a three block radius, and you will be
harassed by hippies, horribly begging for a spare ticket.  Now then,
Topper Price and the Upsetters are squeezing their big sound into the
tiny Back Alley courtyard, or Soul Cow is getting weird at the Nick.

Sat. May 7
FOLLOW FOR NOW at Louie Louie
HILLBILLY FRANKENSTEIN at The Nick
    These guys reappear.  I haven't seen them in a couple of years but
should be good.  Hillbilly Frankenstein at the Nick and I'm getting
over it; unspeakables at Zydeco and the Mill, don't even ask.

Tues. May 10
BABLENAUT at The Nick
    Were 24th Century Quakers, they include my good friend Randall
Sherbet from VBS.  The most exciting new band in Birmingham.

Thurs. May 12
JIMMY DALE GILMORE at the Five Points South Music Hall
    Jeezus, cool man thing; if I wasn't working, I'd be torn between
this and the Rev. Horton Heat at Louie Louie.  It's rockabillyish
season in Birmingham.  I'd probably decide by cheaper cover charge.

Fri. May 13
    Go play Q-Zar instead.  What with the bad luck and all, you're sure
to get negative points and possibly ejected for running over a
six-year-old.  I can attest to the fun of this activity, it's sucked
several dollars out of my pocket already, and Our Sainted Editor has
informed me he's ready to get the yearly membership discount.  I'm
probably next.

Sat. May 14
    Another weak music night by my tastes, so I'll suggest the Six Pack
mystery bands at the Nick.

SPACE CAMP at Flamingos
    I haven't seen them in a while but Don Tinsley never disappoints.
One of this town's best songwriters.

Wed. May 18
QUEEN LATIFAH at Louie Louie
    I don't recall ever seeing a rap artist in a club, so this is very
unique, worth at least a glance in the window if not the cover charge.
Louie Louie is running some delicious drink specials during the week to
lure patrons--fifty-cent mixed drinks, etc.  I don't know if there are
any specials for a show of this type but in a town that commonly sells
$2.50 beers, specials are good to remember.

Thurs. May 19
LUMP/SON OF SLAM at The Nick
    I tell ya, if I didn't have to play a private party... I'd go see
Son of Slam, because of their wonderful poster.  It features a little
boy peeing in a trailer park, among other things...

Fri. May 20
THE GARGOYLES/THE TICKS at The Nick
    I took off a day of work to play it, so I'll take a few lines to
mention it.  The Gargoyles are the Family Boykin with drummer.

Tues. May 24
BLACK MARKET FLOWERS/DANDELIONS at The Nick
    I like Dandelions anyway and besides this show has a nice floral
theme.  Surely these two acts are compatible!  (I say this because the
Ticks have so often been stuck with bands that sound like the netherhell
--um, I mean completely different from us.  Most often those name
changin', black-fingernail-polish-wearin', leather-crotch-thrustin',
lyric-a-yelpin' Autumn Lords.)

Sat. May 28
SHALLOW/BABLENAUT at The Nick
    Two fine examples of the new original music coming out of the ashes
of a Grateful Dead cover band holocaust that leveled the city for
several years.  Finally, finally, people are coming to see local bands,
damned good ones.

Wed. June 1
EDDIE MONEY at Louie Louie
    Having said that, I find that the Louie Louie establishment is
presenting... this.  I am surprised to find Eddie Money playing a 300-
or-so-seat venue.  Hey, my friend Marjorie likes the song "Shakin'", so
maybe you do too.  Have fun.

Sat. June 4
STRUTTER at The Nick(?)
    Meanwhile, your holier-than-thou writer admits she'll go see
Strutter do the Kiss thing with blood and fire breathing and shell out
ten bucks or so to do it.  No one is safe.

    Southside currently has a armed sniper firing on Valley Avenue.
This after a very pleasant month, Brother Bryan's statue with lipstick,
and the fountain "Storyteller" goat wearing a big white bra.

    The parking on the fountain, what with Five Points Music Hall, is
unforgivable.  I spent thirteen minutes tring to park to get my call-in
order calzone from Cosmo's.  No way am I parking in a deck for a dollar
to pick up my food.  The culprit isn't the Music Hall, it's that
damnable Birmingham green median work (and the median itself) taking up
parking spaces!  Thanks to the mayor and council for this
inconvenience.  *We* wouldn't want out-of-town visitors to find parking
and easy access to the entertainment district.  Remember Morris Avenue,
people.

    A house in my area was bought by some Japanese sponsors and
dedicated as a museum to a poet who lived there.  Can't remember his
name, I'm no journalist, but I read part of his poem, said to be revered
in Japan as expressing the true fleeting nature of youth, and it was the
tritist, Hallmark card sort of blather.  Must gain something in the
translation, and I wonder what other literature profits in this way.

    Until next time...

    Starting a computer related business these days is nothing new or
particularly spectacular.  Seems everyone who is even remotely
interested in computers is at least thinking about doing it.  When the
idea for I.C. Chip was first formulated (over three years ago), the
technology was priced in the region of clouds and my knowledge was
sparse at best.  As we researched and developed our company we were
constantly seeking program packages that would not only allow us to
achieve a viable, marketable line of products and services, we were also
on a vigilant watch for anything that would also help us to work faster,
increase productivity and, most importantly, make our work more
enjoyable.

    Although we're well on our way to doing business today, that search
is an ongoing one.  The following reviews of three shareware packages
are but a small hint at the treasures we've uncovered during our quest
for product quality, ease of use and time savings during production.
If you're into computer graphics, I highly recommend these packages.
While there is no such thing as a "graphics do-it-all" package, (at I.C.
Chip we use no less than 6 programs to create any finished product),
these programs in concert with a little patience, some creative thinking
and, more than anything else, time, will allow you to increase your
exploration of the emerging world of computer graphics, the imaging
technology of tomorrow.

Improces ver 4.2 - Improc42.zip

    This is the package that started it all for me, in an earlier
version of course.  The author, John Wagner, has managed to create a
powerful graphics manipulating program that is as easy to use as you'd
like it to be or as in depth as you may need it to be.  While it lacks
some ability to manipulate odd shaped areas of an image, this program
more than makes up for that loss in it's ability to create images from
scratch, work in a pixel by pixel environment for fine detail work, use
such "photographic darkroom tools" as burning and dodging, add lettering
using a wide variety of fonts and create airbrush-like effects for
backgrounds and shading of picture elements.

    This latest version has seen several unusual additions not found in
other graphics packages.  As I alluded to in my opening, no graphics
package I've yet to explore offers everything I'd like to use, so it's
often necessary to jump from one program to another until I can get to
where I want to be.  Improces is but one of these programs.

    3-D Effects
       Want to take that GIF of a friend and lay it down, as though it
       were a sheet of paper on a tabletop?  How about turning that
       party image into a 3-d map, in several different ways?  You can
       do it with but a few clicks of the mouse!

    Special Effects
       Here you'll discover the ability to create a wide variety of
       special effects on an image...

               Relief   - create a 3-d engraved effect
               Reverse  - make a color or B&W negative
               Solarize - creat false color images, much like
                          posterizing

               Melt     - This one take time to see but it does create
                          the illision of the image melting down the
                          screen

               Bentley  - This one creates a 3-d type map of an image
               Oil      - This one really shines!  It is this effect
                          that is mostly responsible for the creation of
                          I.C. Chip.  On slow computers it does take
                          time, but the effect is very nice!
               Frost    - Makes an image appear as though it is being
                          viewed thru frosted glass
               Jiggler  - Here is one that has little use other than
                          while you're viewing an image.  Select a part
                          of the image and set it into motion.  On
                          certain images, it can be quite entertaining.

    Under the Filter Menu you'll find choices that will allow you to
affect such things as color and B&W sharpening, averaging of the pixels
by brightness levels, Grey and Color custom definable filters, contrast
controls and replication methods.  The replication selection is great
for creating windows wallpaper from images, although you'll have to use
another program to convert the final GIF or PCX into a BMP format.

   In the Tools menu you'll see the following...

               Paint - Far too much to go into in detail here, but using
                       this selcetion you'll be able to create
                       airbrushed effects, pixel editing, burning and
                       dodging, creating circles, squares,
                       rectangles and elipses (filled and unfilled), and
                       some font selections.  You'll use this menu a
                       more than most!

              Scale  - Very useful for resizing or cropping an image.

              Zoom   - Excellant for a quick view of image detail.

              Twirls - This menu allows such controls as mirror effects,
                       flipping, rotating and spinning.

              Plasma - I've used this one to create effects ranging from
                       realistic cloud filled skys to pseudo marble in a
                       wide variety of colors and textures.

              Siner  - I'm not all that into the Math aspects of this
                       stuff folks, but this one create Sine waves in a
                       user definable range of colors.  I've used this
                       one to create some really wild backgrounds.

    Within the Color Menu lie the controls that will affect your images
colors.  Here you can change colors on a global scale, rearrange the
order of the palette and sort the colors of the palette.  If you
"RE-ALIGN" the color palette, you'll discover exactly how many colors
are used in that image and how many are left available that you can
define.  For instance, if an image only uses 200 of a possible 256
available colors, those last 56 colors may be changed to whatever other
colors you might want to use for your lettering ect.  VERY useful for
creating informative and eye-catching GIFs!

    Under the Clip Menu are choices for Cutting a specified area of an
image.  Once you've done this, you can shoose to Save that clip for
later use, view the clip or any other that you've previously saved, or
paste that clip into another image or into another area of the same
image.  There are several very interesting choices for the pastng
process as well, including an averageing option that allows the clip to
be brought into the existing image as a ghost image.

    Improces supports most video cards available on the market today in
resolutions ranging from 320x200 to 1024x768.  Under the Files Menu,
you'll choose to Open images files in PCX, GIF or TGA formats.  You can
open a GIF, edit the image and save it to a PCX or TGA.  It is also
possible to open a 320x200 image as a 640x480, giving a much better
image, although a much smaller one as well, but hey, you got to give to
get huh?  There are two other options worth mentioning here.  The first
is the Virtual Mode.  If you have a very large image, you can open it
under this mode and scroll around the image as you edit.  The other is
Improces's ability to allow you to work on as many as 5 different pages
at one time.  This is extremely useful if you're cutting and pasting
from one image to the next.

   Improces was written in BC++ ver 3.1, loads images very quickly and
handles a wide variety of needs that the digital editing computerphile
will desire.  Designed to operate under DOS, it will run under Windows,
with a little thought to the PIF setup, quite nicely.  Just be certain
to load your mouse driver from DOS before entering Windows.  Improces
will run ONLY with a mouse.  I've found Logitech's mouse driver to work
very well.

   John Wagner is the conference host of the Graphics Conference on
U'ni-Net.  Feel free to drop in and chat with him.  I know, from
personal experience, that John welcomes questions and suggestions from
his users, and you may discover that conference to be a great place to
get answers to many of your other graphics related porblems.  [Editor's
Note:  At press time, U'ni-Net was unavailable for access in Birmingham
due to the demise of Channel 8250.]

    Nope, it won't do it all, but then, if you know of a Graphics
program that will, please PLEASE get in touch with me!

Thumbs Up - Thumbs.zip

    Now here is yet another program that managed to get my immediate
attention!

    If you've managed to collect a large number of image files, this
program is an absolute must, *if* you operate under Windows.  Thumbs Up
recognizes a *very* wide number of image formats *including* Windows
font files.  This program will create "thumbnails" of your images,
fontfiles and clipart, each in their own directorys.  On the left of
your screen you'll find a very hand DIR TREE, from here you can click
on any one that contains images.  How do you know if there are inages
in there? Any DIR that contains files that Thumbs Up recognizes is
shown in green. Also, any DIR that is expandable has a "+" sign in its
file symbol, denoting that there are subdirectories to be found.

    Depending on your graphics card, the thumbnails can be very
detailed, although smaller, images from which you can make your
selections.  From within Thumbs Up you can..

        Attain information about any selected file, it's size, format
        etc.

        Delete files from your dirve

        Convert ANY recognizable file to a bitmap in the Windows
        Clipboard, to be used in other Windows applications.

        View an image full screen, or, if too large, in a scrollable
        window.

        Print an image using the Selected Windows printer and driver.
        You may also opt to have the image resized to fill the page
        limit of your printer.

        View Windows TTF font examples.  I find this VERY useful when
        working in graphics applications and want a particular "feel"
        for a font.  Rather than sit there in the program trying and
        re-trying different fonts (I've got a LOT of the damn things!),
        I minimize my graphics app, maximize Thumbs Up, go to the
        Windows System DIR and visually make my choice.  This option
        alone has saved me a lot of time in my work.

    The list of recognizable file types is extremely long.  If you have
a file type that this one won't recognize, you probably need to update
your graphics programs!

    Thumbs Up also does slide shows as well!

    I've found this program indispensable in my work and I believe any
one with extensive graphics needs will appreciate it's ease of use,
splendid layout, and ability to aide in image selctions.  Although some
may find the $50.00 registration fee a bit high, if you're into graphics
in a big way, this program is well worth the asking fee.

File Buddy - FB310.ZIP

    This is one I just recently downloaded and found to be a very nice
piece of work.  While it allows you to view an extreme variety of files,
including text, DBF, and graphics, I found that it especially suited my
needs for viewing graphics files from DOS.  Since I'm a Norton Commander
user, when in DOS, I wanted a graphics file viewer that I could call up
from the Norton File Extension Editor.  File Buddy turned out to be just
the ticket.

    File Buddy is EXTREMELY configurable.  Using it's own INI
(initialization) file, File Buddy allow you to set parameters that will
decide how the images are viewed or printed.  Yep, you can even
configure a printer to use from within File Buddy to print graphics or
text files.  You may also configure a text editor for editing purposes,
although it will have ot be an editor of your own as File Buddy doesn't
come with one.  FB reads and saves files in the DBF format, and allows
word searches and screen captures to be performed on all text files.

    FB can also be configured to read and write files using several
different archive formats.  ARC, ARJ, ZIP (new and old), and PAK are but
a few of the formats usuable.  Zipping files is done by selecting the
files to be zipped from a directory using the space bar and then
entering a few keystrokes.  Archive methods that allow the creation of
self-executing files are also supported as well as the creation of
password protected archive files.

    On the graphics front, FB allows certain image enhancements as well.
These include sharpening, softening, dithering choices, cropping,
contrast - brightness control, image scrolling for large images,
creation of slide shows, converts images to greyscale, allows removal of
"noise", creates Kodilith (high contrast) images, allows outline tracing
of images, posterization, zooming, and file conversions to EPS, BINARY,
GIF, PCX, TGA, TIF, BMP or JPEG.  For image viewing or enhancement a
VGA or SVGA compatible card is required and 2 megs of ram is
reccommended to avoid the dreaded "out of memory" message.  If you have
a video card that supports the 32k, 64k or 16m modes, you'll find FB to
be capable of handling these images as well.

    Images may be printed to HP LASERJETS, HP DESKJETS or 24 pin EPSONs
and compatibles.  I found the printer setup a bit out of the way as you
have to go to your printer's manual to get the codes needed and insert
them manually into the FB INI file.

    Fb is equally at home using the keyboard or a mouse.  There are PIF
and ICO files provided to use FB in the Windows environment.

    All in all FB is one fine piece of programing stuffed into a $20.00
package!

    Well, thats it for this time around folks.  I've been promising the
editors of BTN to do this review for sometime and I've finally managed
to collect my thoughts enough to get this together.  If you have
questions you feel I might be able to help with, I can be reached thru
The Crunchy Frog, The Matrix and The Alter Ego, under the account of Bob
Crawford.  If you know of a graphics program you'd like to see reviewed,
drop me a note and I'll see what I can do.  If you know of a graphics
package that you think is just wonderful, *please* drop me a note!
Outside of breathing, discovering great graphics apps is what I live
for!  Till next time...

    BILL'S MUSIC
    STUFF                                                Bill Jepson
    ################################################################

    Well, here it is! The long awaited arrival of me, Bill Jepson to do
the current reviews on the music scene, here in Birmingham, and as far
across the globe as I can bring you.  But let's start with just the last
couple of months with the U.S. releases.

    First, we need to go over the issue of Kurt Cobain's death.  I will
agree, being a somewhat avid fan of Nirvana, that the music world has
suffered a tragic loss with his death.  Nirvana opened up doors into the
music world for other good bands such as Pearl Jam, Helmet, Stone Temple
Pilots, and the like.

    But we need not dwell on this issue for too long.  I have spoken to
a few individuals who were totally grief stricken by this tragedy.  I
say to them, GO ON WITH YOUR LIVES!  And whatever you do, don't try to
reach nirvana (the state of mind, not the group) by killing yourself.
Try getting your own band together, and have some fun.  But by all
means, let's not follow the "Not famous till you're dead" fantasy.  Jimi
Hendrix, Jim Morrison, and Kurt Cobain, now joining the crowd, all had
the wrong idea.  You don't have to do drugs, and die to be famous.
[Although it helps. - Ed.]

    But now on with the reviews. I have been told there is someone else
mainly concentrating on the scene around here as far as shows go, so I'm
going to stick to the national and international stuff.

*=* Hole, _Live Through This_
    For those of you who don't know already through the tremendous hype
with Kurt's death, Hole is his widow Courtney Love's band.  Their new
album, _Live Through This_ is titled properly.  I have been trying to
listen to the album for about a week now, and have yet to get through
the third song.  A smidgen of advice, SAVE YOUR CASH!  You work entirely
too hard for this kind of letdown!

*=* Counting Crows, _August and Everything After_
    Recently, Spin magazine asked us the question: Are chart sensations
Counting Crows
    (1) A thinking man's Black Crowes?
    (2) A poor man's R.E.M.?
    (3) A deaf man's Van Morrison?

Well?  What do you think?  Personally, I'll go along with the R.E.M.
statement. Counting Crows has definately got something going here.  But
I hate to say that they won't outlive the fame they have generated.
Already there are rumors about the group disbanding due to a drug habit
posessed by the drummer.  Personally, I hate to see them go.

*=* Vanilla Ice, _Mind Blowin'_
    Let me first start by saying "Huh?"  Where has this guy been?  And
what is he up to know?  Apparently spending alot of time in Tattoo
parlors and in body piercing salons.  The first cut from the new album
entitled _Mind Blowin'_ is called "Roll `em Up".  By both of these
titles you can get the main gist of the album.  But I will say this: the
man needs to make up his mind.  Going from fifteen minutes of stardom,
and being called the "Elvis of Rap" to being the newest gangsta, I am
confused.  Please *no one* enlighten me on this one.

*=* Nine Inch Nails, _The Downward Spiral_
    All I have to say is great great great great, and *awesome*.  Being
a somewhat avid NIN fan, I suggest buying as many copies of this album
as possible.  It is said to be a collectors item, because it's to be the
last that Trent Reznor will do by himself.  He is soon going to hire a
full time band.  BUY THIS ONE!  Hey, even Rolling Stone (famous for
trashing a lot of good bands) gave this one four stars.

*=* Motley Crue, _Motley Crue_
    YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEUCCCCCCCCHHHHHHHHHH!
    I wasn't much of a fan when Vince Neil was hosting this "Motley
Crue" as they are suitably named, but now that John Corabi has taken
over, they have just gone straight to (I'm probobly going to get caned
for this) Singapore.

*=* Primal Scream, _Give Out But Don't Give Up_
    Much worth the $17.95 you'll pay at Musicland or Camelot.  After not
hearing anything from this group for awhile, it was well worth the wait.

*=* King Missile, _King Missile_
    I can say I have liked one of their songs in the past. You might
remember it.  'Twas called "Detatchable Penis", coming out directly
after John Slater got his cut off, making him wish he had met the nurse
at the hospital in a different manner.  Other than that song, don't
waste your time, or money.

*=* _Reality Bites_ soundtrack (various artists)
    Ohhhhhhhhhhh yes!  What I have been waiting for, a line to use on
all of my future dates: "You, me, five bucs and conversation.  It's all
we need."  Sorry, that was more of a movie review than for the album.
But the album definately has it's good, great, and even better points.
With such songs as "Spin The Bottle" by the Juliana Hatfield 3 and even
"My Sharona" by The Knack it is definately an album not to be missed.

    Well kids, that's all for me right now.  Let me know what you
thought of my first crack at the writing thang.  Leave me some mail on
the Matrix.  I really want to know what you thought. Anyway, have fun
with the rest of the issue, that is if Scott didn't stick me all the way
at the end.  [Ed.: Har har har.]  And as always, Peas, Glub, and
Flappyness!

*RIP* = BBS Software is RIP Graphics capable. You must be using a RIP
compatible term software to view them. RIPTerm or QmodemPro v1.50 are
the only two I know of that support it at this time. RIPTerm is shareware
and can be downloaded from most BBS's. QmodemPro is a commercial product.

The two-letter abbreviations you see on the line below the names of
many of the bbs' in the list signify that they are members of one or
more networks that exchange or echo mail to each other in some organized
fashion.
