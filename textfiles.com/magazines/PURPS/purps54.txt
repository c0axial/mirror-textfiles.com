Yes believe your eyes! Purps is on time. Don't ask how it happened. Just
accept the fact that it did and enjoy. This issue should have a few amusing
things. I suppose this might the be the Christians run amuck issue since
there seem to be several submissions about that. Also News of the Weird
Returns. Time to sacrifice a hecatomb to Otis for that. It's important
after all.

Anyway, a couple of notes before we get started. First off issues 1 though
50 of purps are not in a single compressed file on quartz. There may be
other sources to get single back issues. If you can't find any, remember
that HailOtis@socpsy.sci.fau.edu always has them by the fistful.

Second, the listserver appears to be working. Last time around Purps was
mailed out over the course of about 10 minutes instead of an entire week.
Also an emergency  messages for recruits for the Preach-O-Rama was
broadcast with it. I suppose we can assume it works. None of the old
addresses have been destroyed however, so feel free to use those. (In fact
this time around we ended up getting a subscriber on the ancient
acc.fau.edu address which was a supposed to have been off the book two or
three years ago. Amazing ain't it?)

On with the show I want to mail this...

[As usual, Otis has once again blessed us with none other than infamous News
of the Weird Woman. No doubt many of our new subscribers have never heard
of this shadowy and mysterious figure.  Her contributions over the years
helped shape Purps into what it is today. Sadly she cannot be on line that
much so it's a rare gift when she is able to submit something to us.  No
doubt Arch Bis Chad has set up the appropriate shrines for her and
hopefully has fulfilled his duties in insuring that her memory has not
died. In fact at the time of her rare visits he no doubt leads the loyal
masses of Kenyon on a celebrator march around the gates of hell where they
hurl old phone books and off color novelty gifts into the gate gaping
maw. I was give a couple pages of this stuff, and I'm going to dole it out
slowly.]

From the Chicago Reader, 3/13/92:

Police lieutenant Patrick Gildea of Huntington Beach, CA, reported in
November that officers conducting an undercover drug-purchase sting
continued to make arrests of eager would-be customers even after the sting
was over and large orange "police" signs were placed in the area.  Said
Gildea, "We actually had people coming up and getting in line [to buy
cocaine] when we had people [under arrest and handcuffed lying] on the
ground."

In September, after a stormy child custody hearing between mother, father,
and surrogate mother in Santa Ana, CA, 51-year-old Cynthia Moschetta walked
over to her estranged husband, who was meeting with photographers and
reporters, ripped off his toupee, and fled.

   Linda Branagan is an expert on daemons.  She has a T-shirt that sports
the daemon in tennis shoes that appears on the cover of the 4.3BSD manuals
and _The Design and Implementation of the 4.3BSD UNIX Operating System_ by
S. Leffler, M. McKusick, M. Karels, J. Quarterman, Addison-Wesley
Publishing Company, Reading, MA 1989.

   She tells the following story about wearing the 4.3BSD daemon T-shirt:

   Last week I walked into a local "home style cookin' restaurant/watering
hole" in Texas to pick up a take-out order.  I spoke briefly to the
waitress behind the counter, who told me my order would be done in a few
minutes.
   So, while I was busy gazing at the farm implements hanging on the walls,
I was approached by two ``natives.''  These guys might just be the original
Texas rednecks.

   ``Pardon us, ma'am.  Mind if we ask you a question?''
   Well, people keep telling me that Texans are real friendly, so I nodded.
   ``Are you a Satanist?''
   Well, at least they didn't ask me if I liked to party.
   ``Uh, no, I can't say that I am.''
   ``Gee, ma'am.  Are you sure about that?'' they asked.
   I put on my biggest, brightest Dallas Cowboys cheerleader smile and
said, ``No, I'm positive.  The closest I've ever come to Satanism is
watching Geraldo.''
   ``Hmmm.  Interesting.  See, we was just wondering why it is you have the
lord of darkness on your chest there.''
   I was this close to slapping one of them and causing a scene -- then I
stopped and noticed the shirt I happened to be wearing that day.  Sure
enough, it had a picture of a small, devilish-looking creature that has for
some time now been associated with a certain operating system.  In this
particular representation, the creature was wearing sneakers.
   They continued: ``See, ma'am, we don't exactly appreciate it when people
show off pictures of the devil.  Especially when he's lookin' so
friendly.''
   These idiots sounded terrifyingly serious.
   Me: ``Oh, well, see, this isn't really the devil, it's just, well, it's
sort of a mascot.
   Native: ``And what kind of football team has the devil as a mascot?''
   Me: ``Oh, it's not a team.  It's an operating -- uh, a kind of
computer.''
   I figured that an ATM machine was about as much technology as these guys
could handle, and I knew that if I so much as uttered the word ``UNIX'' I
would only make things worse.
   Native: ``Where does this satanical computer come from?''
   Me: ``California.  And there's nothing satanical about it really.''
   Somewhere along the line here, the waitress noticed my predicament --
but these guys probably outweighed her by 600 pounds, so all she did was
look at me sympathetically and run off into the kitchen.
   Native: ``Ma'am, I think you're lying.  And we'd appreciate it if you'd
leave the premises now.''
   Fortunately, the waitress returned that very instant with my order, and
they agreed that it would be okay for me to actually pay for my food before
I left.  While I was at the cash register, they amused themselves by
talking to each other.
   Native #1: ``Do you think the police know about these devil computers?''
   Native #2: ``If they come from California, then the FBI oughta know
about 'em.''
   They escorted me to the door.  I tried one last time: ``You're really
blowing this all out of proportion.  A lot of people use this `kind of
computers.'  Universities, researchers, businesses.  They're actually very
useful.''
   Big, big, BIG mistake.  I should have guessed at what came next.
   Native: ``Does the government use these devil computers?''
   Me: ``Yes.''
   Another BIG boo-boo.
   Native: ``And does the government pay for 'em?  With our tax dollars?''
   I decided that it was time to jump ship.
   Me: ``No.  Nope.  Not at all.  Your tax dollars never entered the
picture at all.  I promise.  No sir, not a penny.  Our good Christian
congressmen would never let something like that happen.  Nope.  Never.
Bye.''

          Police battle devotees to bury a dead guru

Thakur Balak Brahmachari, 73, reputed to have 50 to 70 million followers in
India's West Bengal state, was pronounced dead from heart failure on 5 May.
His disciples and aides, convinced that he was in samadhi and would return
to them, put his body on ice slabs in an air-conditioned room of his ashram
by the Ganges in Sukhchar, about 24 miles north of Calcutta.

Thousands of pilgrims, haggard farmers, widows in white saris chanting
mantras and poor families kept vigil in the scorching summer heat outside
the ashram, waiting for a miracle. Their numbers were swelled by
curiosity-seekers and sceptics from the Indian Rationalists Association.
Kiosks selling food, drink, portraits of Brahmachari, cassettes of his
speeches and products from the ashram's ayurvedic laboratories were open
day and night for the roaring trade. Every day at 1:30 pm, Chitta Sikdar,
general secretary of Santan Dal, the guru's 29-year-old Hindu sect,
together with a few acolytes, bathed their master's body and laid out a
clean set of clothes for him. Resurrection was confidently expected on 25
May, but the day came and went. Aides collected water from the melting ice
slabs under Brahmachari and distributed it as prasad (holy food) to
devotees. The practice ended at the beginning of June, when a newspaper
condemned it as a health risk. The body according to one visitor was
looking "like a fish in a deep freeze". The skin had turned black and was
beginning to flake.

Sikdar said that in 1960, Brahmachari spent 21 days in samadhi, with no
detectable heartbeat or pulse and without food or water. The feat,
celebrated in the media, established the guru's reputation and he began to
attract a huge following. Sikdar said he was prepared to keep the body
uncremated for as long as six months.

Brahmachari was known as the `Marxist Godman' because he preached `vedic
communism' or spiritual equality, which found resonance in West Bengal,
ruled by the communist-led Left-Front government for the past 15 years. The
law requires bodies to be disposed of within 24 hours - but the state
government refrained from storming the ashram, wary of alienating the
substantial Santal Dal voting block.

Hygiene finally prevailed over politics and religion on 30 June with
`Operation Holy Rite'. More than 1,200 Calcutta police armed with clubs
stormed the ashram after overcoming 4,000 devotees armed with tridents and
throwing acid-filled light bulbs and fistfuls of chilli powder. Sixty
police were injured and 950 disciples arrested. The fly-blown swami was
seized after 56 days on ice, and rushed off to an electric crematorium.

Regarding weird books: I too, like to collect strange books with attractive
covers or just bizarre concepts. A couple of my personal favorites:

1. Life stories of dying penitents.   A 19th cent collection of
    essays from various people who, on their deathbeds, tell  you
    why you shouldn't do whatever *they* did.
2. Odd people.    Another rather racist 19th cent. book detailing
    the manners and customs of primitive savage cultures around
    the world. Chapters include: The dirt-eaters of the Fee-Jee
    Islands and the Mud-bedaubers.
3. The history and romance of elastic webbing.   A moving account
    of the lives and exploits of the men (and they were manly men)
    who made the elastic webbing industry what it is today. The
    last sentence is "Lest we forget, lest we forget!" I kid you not.

An adventure story even more intriguing because of its chapter titles:
14. A Liquid Breakfast
33. A Cunning Sheik
34. A Queer Encounter
39. An Obstinate Dromedary (I hate when that happens)
66. Sailor Bill's Experiment

Sorry, I couldn't resist. One of these days I'll post something serious.

CAR CHASE, CRASH REVEAL 20 NAKED PENTECOSTALS

Vinton, LA (AP) -- The devil made them do it.  That's what some of the 20
naked Pentecostals packed cheek-to cheek in a car told police after the
vehicle was chased into a tree.

Officers watched in disbelief as the group piled out of the 1990 Pontiac
Grand Am after the wreck and began religious chants.

The passengers, relatives from Floydada, Texas, said they were en route to
a religious retreat somewhere in Florida, Police Chief Dennis Drouillard
said.

He said some passengers said they were stripped because their clothes were
possessed by the devil.

"Didn't have a stitch of clothes on.  I mean, no socks, no underwear, no
nothin'," he said.  "They didn't say much. They mainly got out and chanted
religious sayings."

The police stopped the car Thursday after getting a report that the car
contained naked people.  The driver got out wearing only a towel, but then
jumped back in, sped off, and crashed into a tree, police said.

The car was totaled, but the injuries were all minor, Drouillard said.

"I guess when you're packed in that tight, there's not much room to move
around," he said.  A police officer gave the passengers clothes at the
scene.

Drouillard said the group ranged in age from 1 to 65 and included three
pregnant women and give children, who were stuffed into the trunk.

Driver Sammy Rodriguez and his brother, Danny, said they were Pentecostal
preachers, Drouillard said.

Floydada Police Chief James Hale said he had been looking for the Rodriguez
family since Tuesday, when relatives reported them missing.  "They made
statements likeB the devil was after them and Floydada was going to be
destroyed if they stayed here," Hale said.  Floydada is a small Texas
Panhandle town about 550 miles from Vinton.

The family left Floydada in five or six cars, abandoning them and
belongings along the way.

Sammy Rodriguez, 29, was held pending an investigation into reckless
endangerment of the children.  He was booked on suspicion of reckless
driving, flight from an officer, and other offenses.

The 19 others were released and spent the night in a shelter.

installed two 12-volt batteries in the trunk of my car.  The dynamotor also
went in the trunk, with a remote control switch.  The amplifier sat on the
rear seat, covered with a blanket.
 
Some "preliminary investigation" at the target drive-in indicated that a
70-volt line transformer was mounted in the base of each speaker pedestal,
and one transformer fed two speakers.  We decided to back-feed into the
system at 70 volts.
 
 ...Along with two carloads of "supporters," we parked in the last row.
Under cover of darkness, I removed the cover plate at the base of our
speaker pedestal, and attached two 22-AWG magnet wires to the 70-volt feed.
There was enough clearance on the cover plate to allow the magnet wires to
pass when the plate was put back.  Also, the magnet wires allowed for a
rapid - and hopefully inconspicuous - breakaway.
 
 ...The movie was a low-budget horror film about witches in England... ripe
for a "commentary."  With all connections made, I turned on the dynamotor.
After the tubes warmed up, I cautiously advanced the master gain control.
Voila!  Feedback, even though our own speaker was turned off.  It worked so
well that we had to close all windows in the car.
 
We engaged in a running "commentary" (use your imagination here). The
people at the drive-in went wild, blowing their car horns in delight.  The
management went nuts!  After about five minutes, two people ran out of the
projection booth with flashlights and started checking cars.  Needless to
say, it was time to pull the plug.  The fellow who came over to my car
looked at us with great suspicion, since we and the two adjacent "support"
cars were all laughing hysterically.  However, no one said anything to us -
I think the drive-in management was still in a state of shock that someone
could do such a thing..."

Elvis the King Might Be a God in the Making, Author Says
 
from Reuter
 
Memphis, Tennessee - Chances are even those who think of Elvis Presley as a
god don't rank the late entertainer on a par with the Supreme Being.
 
But the day may come when followers go down on their knees to worship
"Elvis the King," a messenger who was sent by God, was betrayed by trusted
friends and lives eternally in the hearts of all men and women.
 
At least that's the argument put forward in a new book by a former
religious affairs correspondent for the BBC, who sees in the Elvis cult the
seeds of devotion that could - over time - grow into a full-fledged
religion.
 
"The worship, adoration and the perpetuation of the memory of Elvis today
closely resembles a religious cult," says Ted Harrison, author of the book
_Elvis People - The Cult of the King_ (HarperCollins, US$10), which has
just been published in the United States.
 
"Indeed, what is now the Elvis cult could be nothing less than a religion
in embryo."
 
Officials at Graceland, Presley's celebrated mansion, expect ten thousand
to fifteen thousand Elvis fans to converge on Memphis to mark the
anniversary of his 1977 death on Monday. In the past they have held a
candlelight vigil, visited Presley's grave and scrawled messages to the
dead singer - often couched in religious terms - on the walls of the
estate.
 
"Elvis fans say, echoing the words of many Christians, it is possible not
only to love Elvis, but to be loved by Elvis and have a personal
relationship with him," the book notes.

This week:  A review of the greatest OTISian Band of all time: Van Gogh
Complex, Reprinted, Pretty Much Without Permission, Form the Pages of the
Boston Phoenix

   V.G.C.'s Greatest Hits Vol. 8
      Van Gogh Complex

I have been hearing some discontented mumbleings that this column only
reviews "obscure" bands. Since the vast majority of the originators of this
loose talk couldn't recognize a truely obscure band if one ate them, allow
me to ease their confusion.

The Radio-active Wombats and a Guy Named Sid are an obscure group. So,too,
Leo and the Lovettes and the Squished Fish. Bazooka Joe and His Seven
Friends with Acute Halitosis is not only obscure, but difficult to listen
to if you sit too close. We have not reviewed an obscure group yet.
However, today is different. Today we're going to intro(duce tou to one of
the most obscure groups we've ever tripped over - Van Gogh Complex.

V.G.C. is obscure for a reason. They don't advertise, nor do they have any
regularly scheduled coneert appear ances. They are a neo-classical/Punk
rock group who simply show up at local parties, announce that they are "the
band" and start playing. (This often has an unsettling effect on their
audiences, particularly when they arrive at their favorite haunts - coat
and tie wine tasting parties and small weddings- in this fashion).
Obviously, this is not a run of the mill band. They have, to date, seen fit
only to cut one album, V.G.C.'s Greatest Hits Vol. 8. This is the only
album you can expect to see from them until July when V.G.C.'s Christmas
Melodies will debut.

The album is as weird as the band. The song titles say it all: The Address
of God, My Dog Has Fleas, Jane Fonda Sings "My Way" While Gargeling Ajax in
a Hot Bath, and Dogs, Whips, and Chains. Please don't ask me to describe
this last one in detail. Suffice it to say that a middle aged woman is
heard at the end yelling: "Who are you people!?! Get out of my kitchen, and
take those filthy animals with you!!" Which is nothing actually, compared
to the rest of the tracks. Another song seems to have been recorded in a
bus terminal, and all through Address...one hears, faintly in the
background, periodic bursts of running water, and at one point a man saying
"Excuse me, but I really must get in there".

Which is not to say the music is bad- just generally... well... tasteless.
But V.G.C. can do things with a guitar that other people can only do with
spaghetti and a fork, and the horn solos are fantastic. In spite of the
background noise, Address... is one of the best jam sessions I've heard in
a long time. But the crucial question remains- do you really want to spend
eight bucks on an album from a bunch of guys who get their inspiration
(according to the album jacket) from "Inhaling large quantities of helium,
and watching traffic pass". I wouldn't. But then, I don't listen to
"obscure" bands.

Fort Collins police are not amused by a prank that was supposed to be a fun
way to get youngsters to attend a church youth group meeting. Authorities
stopped 50 cars in their search Sunday for a red van after two children --
ages 5 and 6 -- reported that two men with bandannas over their faces
dragged a screaming girl, 12, into thier vehicle and drove away.  The Rev.
Gary Mcluskey said the kidnappings were organized to get youngsters to the

She also reported a "yellowish-brrwn" substance smeared over the front and

addition, several other boxes on the same road had similar satanic symbols

Sheriff's deputies and a mail inspector arrived at the scene and determined
the satanic grafitti was the remains of a bologna sandwich(es) and that thh

Going to hell: Baptists keep count (from the Ithaca Journal, 9/18/93, p. 1):

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) - God only knows who gets to heaven, but the Southern
Baptists estimate 46.1 percent of people in Alabama risk going to hell.

Since the figure from church research on potentially doomed souls was made
public, it is Baptists who are feeling the fire, however.

The Southern Baptist Convention's county-by-county breakdown of who's bound
for heaven and who isn't - unless they are born again and accept Jesus
Christ as their savior - hit The Birmingham News on Sept. 5.  It's been the
buzz in some Alabama pews ever since.

Under the headline: "Baptists count the lost," the front page story
included a detailed map and box listing the 1.86 million "unsaved" by
county in precise percentages.

The Baptists said the numbers were only a guide on where to establish new
churches and find more followers.

But some of the faithful, Baptists as well as others, are incensed.

"It is the pinnacle of presumptuousness to construct a formula for
quantifying the unsaved," Jack Denver of Homewood, a self-described
"practicing Christian" wrote in a letter that was among about a dozen the
newspaper published from irate readers.

The Southern Baptists have done such demographic research for years, said
Martin King, a spokesman for the denomination's Atlanta-based Home Mission
Board, which compiled the study and has national figures he would not
disclose.

Subject: Micah speaks on words...

So today in Music theory, Micah Rubenstein started talking of word origins.
It became a good tangent, since most of the class were tired of reviewing
figured bass.  (grr...)


Preposterousness:
pre = before, post = after, ness = the state of being.
Preposterousness = the state of being before and after.


Trivia:
tri = three, via = road or way.
In anceint Greece, it was not uncommon for three roads to converge in a town. 
At this intersection, there was a fountain, where women (they weren't PC in
anceint greece!) would do the wash.  At these fountains, or trivias, the women
would gossip about town news and such.  HA!

Sabotage:
Sabo means shoe in French (or so Micah says).  Sometime in French history, a
shoe factory decided to go on strike.  So all the workers took all the shoes,
and threw them into the machines.  The machines broke.  In other words, the
machines were "sabotaged."  

"You'll have the devil to pay":
As it turns out, the devil is the central beam in a boat.  It is where the two
halves join.  Since this junction can often leak water, people tar them.  The
common term for this is "to paye."  In other words, the phrase, "you'll have
hell to pay," really means "you'll have a wooden junction to paint with tar."

  My ball of string has recently passed the 15-foot radius mark and is
growing steadily. Of course, once your ball of string gets as large as mine
has, increasing the diameter by even an inch requires vast amounts of
string. I pride myself on the integrity of materials that my ball is
composed of (a recent core sample taken from Kibo's ball of string, on the
other hand, revealed that the center is PURE SAWDUST!). I use only the
highest quality twine and wind it tightly. Many people see no harm in using
yarn, and, yes, it _is_ thicker, but what you gain in quick increases of
diameter, you lose in strength. More and more, we hear that young people
today lack the patience that is required to make a truly GREAT ball of
string. They "want it all, and they want it now".

  The other day, I passed a group of young children working on their balls
of string. I asked one how old he was. He held up eleven fingers. he was
only eleven, and yet his ball of string was NEARLY FIVE FEET IN DIAMETER!
When I was his age, my ball was only THREE feet in diameter. I looked
closely at his ball of string. Sure, enough, it was composed chiefly of
thick yarn. Great for size, but quick to unravel. I asked him if he thought
his ball of string would see him through his old age. He shrugged his
shoulders. "I just want a big ball." he said. How will he feel when he is
sixty, and his ball of string has fallen apart due to shoddy workmanship?

  The lesson here is simple: We all want big balls, but big balls take
time.

Another gnuisance on the fringe

Brian (Godzilla) Salmi has started a political party to cash in on voter
disgust with politics - the Gnu Democratic Rhino Reform party.  There are
only two things worth knowing about the party: the "G" in "Gnu" is
pronounced, and it's out to replace the Rhinoceros Party as the voice of
political spoofery in Canada. The Gnus will field 14 candidates in the
Vancouver area in the coming election.  In the one after that, Mr. Salmi
hopes to have organized "from Gnufoundland to the Gnukon."

The Gnus formed last month after splitting from the Rhinos over a dispute
involving a stripper and a professional dominatrix, he says.

Mr. Salmi will be easy to spot at all-candidate forums.  He dresses in a
green Godzilla suit.  He intended the outfit as an anti-nuclear warning,
but his costume is so tattered and stupid-looking that most people mistake
it for Kermit the Frog.

Well, this week's Time magazine contains a definitive account of the recent
attack on Barney, an indicator of the growing "Barney backlash" taking
place in the US. The attack took place at a reopening of a K-mart in
Galveston, TX (not at a mall in San Antonio, as one rumor had it). The guy
in the Barney suit was "assaulted and punched" by four boys, aged 10-14
(some rumors had the kids as elementary school age or in their late teens),
and according to a police officer, "the 13-year-old tried to take off his
head." Apparently, the article said, kids were frantically calling the
Galveston police station to find out if Barney was hurt. The assailants
were fined $200 each and have until the age of 17 to pay up.

Meanwhile, we should keep our ears open for parodies of "The Barney Theme
Song (I Love You)." In my last posting, I quoted one my daughter had picked
up from a classmate in first grade:
I hate you
You hate me
Let's all go and kill Barney
With a shotgun blast we'll put him on the floor
No more purple dinosaur
 
Hey, if it keeps up, maybe Barney will start turning to booze and
tranquilizers. Wouldn't that make a great show:

"I tell ya, Baby Bop, this is a rotten business. They chew you up and spit
you out. I give and I give and I give, and what do I get? Kids trying to
pull my head off. Well, who needs 'em. As far as I'm concerned, they can
watch test patterns all day."

O.K., o.k., enough of your absement; frankly it's embarassing.  All these
people thowing themselves on the floor, cowering in dark corners when I
pass, groveling in my presence... OTIS, but it's enough to make me wish I'd
listened to mother and become a dental assistant.

Ah, now that would be the life, poking my fist into strange people's
mouths, asking vital questions on medical insurance of people too novicaned
to speak propperly, handing out the "free" lolipops to good little boys and
girls.

But we don't always get to choose, do we...  OTIS says "Be my Pope  or
they'll be scraping your gooey remains off yonder ground with a spatula",
and I say "Hey, HAIL OTIS!  Just call me "Pope"".

Well, Marcus, if we here at the House had a Chutzpah Award for Really Great
Excuses, you'd be strongly favored to win right now, but let me make this
clear to you and everyone who fails to show up for thse Preach o Ramas:
You're hurting no one but yourselves.

While you all were sitting at home watching Z grade movies on Turner
Television last Sunday, those who made it to the last Preach o Rama WERE
HAVING THE TIME OF THEIR LIVES!  Why we had:

Live snake handling!

Levitations!

Faith Healing!

OTISian Sing a Longs!

A Genuine Old Style Family Bar-B-Que!

Absolutely NO Yak Tossings!

OTISian Rant-a-Thons!

Nude Jello Wrestling!

Spontaneous Conversions and Blessings!

Strange OTISian Rituals!

and all sorts of other good clean, wholesome, family type activities.  Why
we even discovered the SECRET LOCATION OF A LOST OTISIAN RELIC (a magic
plunger; ask Mal; he has it), heard interesting testimony of the power of
OTIS from some guy in Poland, discovered that being Papaal pays less even
than being a freelance writer, and saw DEMONSTRABLE proof of the Evil
Zackinthians' attempts to medlle with the 'lectronic fringes as a way of
stoping us from communicating with each other!  And we all bore witness as
the Pope was kidnapped by aliens!

Let me tell ya folks it was a humdinger of a day...

You want us to give YOU a terminal for home?

No, no, no.  Rather you should go out and STEAL one this VERY INSTANT just
so you can keep up with the fantastic things afoot.

Still, we have had several complaints about the timing of these buggers,
and I would like it known that I am open to suggestions vis a vis the
scheduling of the next one.  After all, we have followers in Poland and
Australia, Hong Kong and and Illinois, and I am sympathetic to the plight
of those forced to "log on" at 3:00am.

So, maybe next time I'll stay up late.

"The human tongue is the fastest growing organ in the body and as such,
care must be taken to prevent excessive growth. Normally, friction from
eating, chewing, biting of the tongue, omononapiea and displays of
affection will keep the tongue length in stasis. However, in patients
receiving intravenous or gastric feeding, these modes are not available and
excessive tongue growth may occur. It is not uncommon to find growths of up
to 11 meters in unattended patients. When such feeding methods are
indicated, the tongue should be filed or sanded on a bi-weekly basis."

"In retrospect, lighting the match was my big mistake. But I was only
trying to retrieve the gerbil," Vito Bustone told bemused doctors in the
Severe Burns Unit of Salt Lake City Hospital.

Bustone and his homosexual partner Kiki Rodriguez, had been admitted for
emergency treatment after a felching session had gone seriously wrong. "I
pushed a cardboard tube up his rectum and slipped Faggot, our gerbil, in,"
he explained. "As usual Kiki shouted out 'Armageddon', my cue that he'd had
enough. I tried to retrieve Faggot but he wouldn't come out again, so I
peered into the tube and struck a match, thinking the light might attract
him."

At a hushed press conference, a hospital spokesman described what happened
next. "The match ignited a pocket of intetsinal gas and a flame shot up the
tube, igniting Mr Bustone's moustache and severely burning his face. It
also set fire to the gerbil's fur and whiskers, which, in turn, ignited a
larger  pocket of gas further up the intestine, propelling the rodent out
like a  cannonball."

Bustone suffered second degree burns and a broken nose from the impact of
the gerbil, while Rodriguez suffered first and second degree burns to his
anus and lower intestinal tract."

   In the mid-17th century there was a stir in New Haven, Connecticut.
   A sow had given birth to a "monstrous" piglet.  In the eyes of the
   colonists, this was no accident.  Specifically, it had to be a sign
   of a revolting crime: carnal intercourse with a pig.  The finger of
   suspicion pointed to Thomas Hogg (sic).  He was ordered by
   magistrates to scratch the mother pig.  When she reacted with a
   "show of lust," the unfortunate Hogg's guilt was confirmed.

Otodotos -- Mostly Taiwan I should think.

            commode"? [Editors note: Strangely enough we do have an
            O'Keefe over the Commode.. ah the Pope does it again.]
     mal -- Oh probably about 70% of anything dug up in egypt I
            would imagine.
Otodotos -- Working with Ancient Magicks is always dangerous!
    Pope -- Yeah....  or "That would look great next to the
            water heater in the basement of the British museum"
     mal -- Hmm why do you think I use the other plunger most
            of the time. I could see it now. Just one plunge
            and most of the sewage system of Highland Beach
            gets blown sky high.
     mal -- Or maybe suck down some little old lady doing her
            business.
     mal -- That's' all I need is a wet old person showing up in
            my toilet.
    Pope -- I don't think the plunger was ever meant to be USED,
            just adored from a safe distance
     mal -- Hmm maybe I should get a case for it.
    Pope -- An ANGRY old wet person
     mal -- Or maybe one of those 1/2 bathtub shrines. I could
            put it out on the lawn and my land lord could get
            constantly fined until it was removed.
     mal -- Hmm they'd also have their pants down or skirts up
            or what ever which would be worse than just being
            an angry old person who's wet.
     mal -- Actually if Christ appeared around here hanging on
            a cross they'd fine him. Or at least make him paint
            himself pink.
     mal -- So how does on display the toilet plunger anyway?
            Rightside up or upside down?
    Pope -- Actually, maybe practical uses for religious
            paraphenallia could be one of the ways we
            distinguish ourselves from other religions.  I'll
            bet that other Pope has never sound a practical use
            for all the various relics...  "Reduse, reuse,
            recycle" could have d
     mal -- Should I use gold foil and guild the business end?
    Pope -- eep spiritual meaning
    Pope -- Gold foil sounds good., as long as the scotch tape
            is clearly visible
    Pope -- Eike!  We've lost Otodotos.  Might loose me soon,
            too (modem's in conniptions)
     mal -- good idea oh Pope. I can't really see the Catholic
            Pope digging weeds with an arrow that pierced St
            what's -his-butt's side.
     mal -- Yikes... Well I've been having a bit of modem
            trouble as well. :-) As usual it's a plot to stop
            us.
    Pope -- Exactly!  Or binding heretics with the same chains
            used for St. Peter
     mal -- Or better yet using those chains for your snow
            tires.
    Pope -- Modems:  Of course.  Clearly the work of the evil
            Zakinthians
     mal -- They'd got a big microwave beam set up somewhere
            and are frying the phone lines.
    Pope -- Well, he'll be back.  what bugs me is: WHERE IS
            EVERYONE ELSE?
     mal -- The sumerians were smarter than us. THey used fires
            on hill tops. That sort of communication is hard to
            corrupt.
    Pope -- Zakinthians: Hmmm, maybe I need more tin foil on my
            head...
     mal -- Or wrap the foil around the modem and nearby
            telephone poles.
    Pope -- Fires on hill tops:  yes, either that or just plain
            shouting...  or maybe semaphore
     mal -- Maybe we should switch to semaphore. I can't
            imagine irc being so complicated people have
            trouble using it.
     mal -- Hmm well I've got the listserver now. We could
            blast out another message.
    Pope -- Neither can I, but you forget the first Truth of the
            Inner Doctrine: XXXXX XXX XXXXXX [censored].
     mal -- Oh dear.. that's the first truth of doing psychology
            experiments.
    Pope -- Perhaps we should try the listserver.  If nothing
            else we can completely piss people off
     mal -- Okay.. I'll just send a message saying  something
            like Preach-o-rama now. Where are you?
