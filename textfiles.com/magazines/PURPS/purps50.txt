Deadlines! Deadlines! Always deadlines to meet. The eternal hammer of Brow
always threatening to fall. That's what it's like being Editor some times.
Still it's great fun.

Welcome to Issue Number Fifty. The golden anniversary issue as it were.
Yes, Purps is Fifty Issues old and still going strong. We've got more
subscribers than ever (and strangely enough the most subscribers appear when
an issue of purps is delayed by a week or two. I suppose this is OTIS's
gentle reminder to me that the herd of OTIS needs an issue.) and we're
available in more places than ever (see below for availability of Purps via
gopher.)

Fifty issues was easy. We can easily make 100. Yes it's optimism all the
way amazingly enough. We even now have access to a not one, but two unix
machines which might mean the Purps distribution  list can finally get off
it's silly slow trickle distribution and back to it's wide bore shotgun
mailing like it used to have. We'll see though. At least we have the
hardware. Other odd plans for the future include perhaps and FTP server and
maybe even a OTISIAN mud or something like that. Lord knows.

Surprisingly enough this issue of Purps contains REAL honest to Heethor
facts about OTIS! Say it ain't so oh over worked editor, but it's true.
Recently the esteemed Doc Simpson send me a whole bunch of material, some
of which you can see below.  We now had a real FAQ file just like all those
other electronic distribution thingies. We can now officially bitch at
people and tell them to go read the damn FAQ and stop bother us just like a
real electronic discussion list. (Not that we really would.)

Also included is an updated version of the Glossary, this again is thanks
to Doc Simpson who spend hours pouring over the Otisian archives in an
effort to bring forth this document of some magnitude.

Also we have yet more historic tales from the archives of Doc Simpson.

Okay one more paragraph were we mention him. Doc Simpson has expressed an
interest is setting up some sort of European Otisian something or other. If
you're in Europe you may want to drop him a line and see what exactly he is
up to.

Other than that, we've got a few other bits and pieces. I wanted to heavily
slant this issue toward educating the clamoring masses of OTIS so that's
what I did.

For those of you who send me submissions, keep them coming. I need them. I
have enough sitting right here to whack out yet another issue of Purps.
Life seems to be taking a turn for the better so maybe they will come out
more frequently.

Anyway on with the show, and remember that the Pope needs material for the
OTISIAN directory. Contact him if you'd like to make a submission in any
way shape or form.

            Fragment #44, The Origin of the Parasols of Lemuria
####===================================================================####
     ...And when mighty Spode, God of Confusion, approached gentle Nepha,
Goddess of Chocolate Eggs, with the Purple Thunderbolt uncovered by any
garment but standing erect of Its own power, sweet Nepha was greatly
troubled, for It was 4 cubits in width and 44 cubits in length.  In
terrible fear She smote It with Her spear and many-splendored Spode was
sorely vexed.  And as He hopped about and bellowed as the majestic bull
does in summertime when it bottom is lashed by thorns, some of the Seed of
Spode was scattered upon the earth.

     And behold, a child was born from the earth and Heethor, the Paisley
Goddess, in her form of Heethymthombang, Lady of Unexplained Plot Twists,
took this child and placed him in a chest.  And
She-Who-Never-Straightly-Doth-Anything-Do took the chest unto Lemur the
Wise of Lemuria and spake thusly, "This coffer, receiveth you.  Not at all
(nowise) may you inside it be looking (although pressing, temptation may
be) but good care of it should be taken."  And snowy-haired Lemur took the
chest and placed hearty repast beside it every day but never dared to look
inside it.

     However, sagacious Lemur's four foolish sisters, Lalune, Lamoure,
Lamachine, and Lecar, were very curious and peeked under the lid.  The
annals of mortal men do not concur what it was they saw, for verily, no
mortal man has seen that sight and remained fit to describe it.  Some say
that it was four great chartreuse snakes set there by Heethor to guard the
child.  Some say that it was no infant at all but a fish with a very
pungent smell. Others assert that the chest contained nothing but bones.
Still others say that the child was fat, pink, healthy and normal except
that in place of human private parts he had a great writhing snake.
Whatever the contents of the chest, when the four matrons beheld it they
were struck stark mad and hacked their own baby boys to small pieces with
meat cleavers babbling that the helpless babes were horrid monsters.  For
their infanticide long-lived Lemur had his stupid sisters eaten alive by
slithy toves.

     And when the wheel of the seasons had turned four times the child from
the chest appeared fully clothed before wise Lemur and told him that
Heethor, the Paisley Goddess, in her form of Heethorandhafter,
She-Who-Talks-To-People-In-Boxes, had named him Erectos in honor of his
singular conception and had charged shrewd Lemur to adopt young Erectos as
his own son.  Loyal Lemur faithfully bowed anew to the will of the Great
Goddess.

     Erectos grew to be not only tall, handsome, strong, and swift but he
also proved to be rather clever.  He invented many things: the feather
duster, shoe polish, toenail clippers, and the prophylactic.  Some
speculate that the prophylactic was not really for birth control but to
disguise the deformation of Erectos' genitalia but this was in truth just a
nasty rumor started by some young blades who had difficulty satisfying the
young women after they had slept with robust Erectos.  The pious people of
Lemuria were so impressed by virile Erectos' abilities that they elected
him to be their king.

     Shortly thereafter deep-chested Brow, God of Mindless Violence,
appeared unto the perplexed people of Lemuria and spake unto them that if
they made sacrifices only unto Him and had no other Gods but He, then He
would make them victorious in every battle and masters of the whole earth.

     But at the same time gentle Lotus, God of Peace, and Heethor, the
Paisley Goddess in her form of Hythorlinbeestee, Lady of Peace, Sisterly
Love, and Granola, appeared unto the people together and spake that if the
people did not believe belligerent Brow but behaved like proper peasant
people, performing pleasing sacrifices serving several dignified deities,
They would reward them with plentiful paisley parasols.

     And the pious people were discombobulated by the awesome offers of the
Gods and asked their king, clever Erectos, to judge the matter.  Faithful
Erectos, remembering the kindness shown him by his divine benefactrix in
the matter of his birth and infancy, chose the plentiful paisley parasols
of curvaceous Heethor without pause.  Brawny Brow was bitter but bowed to
the judgement with good grace because of pressure from the other Gods.

     However, shortly thereafter deep-chested Brow induced war- like
Welhung, King of Ethiopia and Brow's son by the nymph Abyssia, to wage war
on Lemuria over a matter of boundaries.  The peaceful people of Lemuria
were oversoon overwhelmed by the bellicose battalions of the Brat of Brow.

     Wise Erectos, seeing his people beaten, made a pilgrimage to the
Oracle of Nepha on Mount Dubedubedu to ask the sweet Goddess what must be
done to save his loyal subjects.  The priestess of Our Lady of Chocolate
replied that noble Erectos must sever his famous genitalia, for
unencumbered by its great bulk and weight he should be invincible in
battle.  Brave Erectos made the self- sacrifice and plunged alone into the
army of unwary Welhung with the wound still gushing hot blood.  He slew 16
men with each great swing of his sword.  With each thrust of his oaken
spear he skewered 16 more.  256 men were boiled alive in the river of his
scalding blood.  256 more died of shear fright at the look of righteous
anger on his countenance.  At last none of mighty Welhung's army stood but
undaunted Welhung himself like a single ear of corn left unmowed in great
field by a mighty reaper at harvest when he pauses for a draught of sweet
cold spring water from the mountains.

     Then tall Erectos and stout Welhung rushed to embrace each other like
lovers and met with a clap like thunder.  They remained locked in unabated
combat for four days and four nights but as the dawn of the fifth day
prepared to leave the bed of night, emasculated Erectos slew wanton
Welhung, King of Ethiopia, and mounted his severed head on the top of his
battle standard to proclaim the glory of his victory.

     At that moment deep-chested Brow, God of Mindless Violence, appeared
before the council of the Gods and demanded the right to execute his son's
murderer.  As Heethor, the Paisley Goddess, was asleep at the time, no-one
objected.  Deep-chested Brow then squashed unlucky Erectos like a bug.

                                The Glossary
####===================================================================####
[Some of this originally appeared in an earlier edition of Purps. Doc
Simpsons has updated this greatly. No doubt you will be seeing this again
once more is added to it. If you read this carefully you should learn all
manner of important things about OTIS.]
A
AIRAMEKO - (see "Ancient Illuminated Rosicrucian Anti-Masonic
     Elder Knights of Otis")
Akshak - Ancient Sumerian center of Otis-worship.
Aliens - A general group of non-human, non-terrestrial entities
     who have played both major and minor roles in the history of
     Otis. Throughout the ages, various government agencies have
     attempted to intercept them before they contacted one Pope
     or another. (Refer to the Roswell incident for more detail.)
Allie, Saint - Patron of Roads, Streets, Lanes, and Boulevards.
Ameks - One of the evil demiurges (see also "Veesa").
Ancient Illuminated Rosicrucian Anti-Masonic Elder Knights of
     OTIS - One of the most dangerous and frightening of all of
     the Secret Societies who are really running the world today.
     The Elder Knights now have agents in virtually every major
     government on Earth, and have recently become the real power
     behind the Gnomes of Zurich.
"And a large Orange Drink" - A phrase used in a similar way to
     the Judeo-Christian "Amen."
AntiChrist - A being of immense power who will one day rise up
     and attempt to take over the Earth for its unearthly
     pleasures. The only thing that stands in its way is Elvis.
Apendix - A human organ created by Otis in Sumerian times to help
     with income tax forms.  The income tax confusion, spurred on
     by Spode, has unfortunately outgrown the rather small size
     of this organ.
Arani - Divine Concubine of Otis.
Atlantis - Original home of Otisianism. (see "Eporopo")
 
B
Bar Trek - Ancient Otisian drinking game.
Base sixteen - The most natural and normal system of number
     notation used by good Otisians worldwide for cheques, census
     forms, tax forms, et c.
Base ten - An evil system of number notation invented and
     propagated by Zakynthians.
Batrakhomuomakhia - the Histories of Early Atlantis.
Bauching - (see "Smashmas")
Bill - An important and symbolic character in the "Banquet of the
     Gods."
Bissextile Day - February 29 when all good Otisians worship and

Blue, Saint - Patron of Alleys.
B_b - the Name That Should Not Be Uttered.
Bonanza - A T.V. program space aliens use to learn English with.
     (see also "aliens")
Borogove - A thin, shabby-looking bird with its feathers sticking
     out all round, something like a live mop.  Once common in
     Atlantis, they are now extinct due to Zakynthian
     over hunting.
B-Otis-2 - The Evil Anti-Otis, a snappy dresser.  Some believe
     that the "2" stands for "the second letter in the alphabet"
     thus "The Name that Must Not Be Uttered."  (see "B_b") 
     Others prefer to derive the name from the phrase "Be Otis
     too" referring to the heretical Zakynthian belief that mere
     mortals can attain the mystic powers of the God(dess) of
     Life through black magic.  The Anti-Plaidists hold that B-
     Otis-2 and Reiod are identical.  (see "Reiod")
Bowling - According to the Ancient Sumerian balag lamentations
     (see Rhienhart) Otis was a fantastic bowler.  The sport was
     traditionally invented by Spode.
Brew Mare's Night - An ancient Otisian holiday in honor of
     Rhotos, celebrated from sundown to sunup on the night of
     October 31st when ferverant Otisians, having ritually
     starved themselves for four days, ran howling and gibbering,
     dressed in fantastic and obscene costumes through the
     streets until they came upon the first female horse which
     they tore apart with their bare hands, boiled in a soup, and
     ate.  Now celebrated with old cars.
Brillig - Four o'clock in the afternoon, a propitious time to
     invoke Otis.

     Therein-When-They-Found-It. The bucket is also Fez shaped.
     Refer to the "Brown Bucket Papers" for more detail. (see
     also "fez")

Clem - A maverick Otisian Missionary. Also an intelligence agent.
Confused - Something the typical Otisian usually is. (see also
     "Spode," "Spode, The Game")
Creiza - Goddess off Eddittinngg.
Croom - Lesser breaches of proper doctrine.  However, at least
     one Otisian Matriarch has declared "It is better to commit
     the daring crimes of froom than to participate in the pale
     and unoriginal misdemeanors of croom."  From the Atlantean
     "Keroodi-feroomi."
Ctesipho - God of Twinkies.
 
D
Decimal - (see "Base ten")
Dentists' office reading - A coveted market for publications in
     which Purps has attained a niche.  (see also "Purps")

     form of Otis) near the coast of Naxos (see also)  Real name:
     James Clark Wildman.
Dogma - It cannot be a whole without its Catma. That which is
     shrouded in secrecy by the Otisian Elders. That which is
     whispered across the desert sands by the Knights of Otis.
     That which requires the sending of money to discover.
Dolphins - All secretly want to have sex with humans.

     Nepha, Creiza, Mhari-Llyn, Brow, Reaf, and Papsucker.  Some
     sects recognize different rosters, however.

F
Fawna - The Otisian Bimbo.

Four Bodies of Otis - (see "Caturkaya")
Four Gates of Dream - Iron, Earthenware, Horn, and Ivory.
Fourism - The Otisian doctrine that four is the single most
     important number in the universe.  A radical variant of this
     doctrine is that four and powers of four are the only
     numbers in the universe.  In all cases where there appear to
     be, say, five apples, in reality either one apple is an
     illusion sent by the Zakynthians or there are 16 apples, 11
     of which happen to be invisible (due to a Zakynthian mind-
     control device).  Whether there can be one (four to the zero
     power) of anything is a hotly debated subject.
Froom - Forbidden practices and extremely unorthodox doctrines.
     Please note that all froom is optional.  From the Atlantean
     "Feroomi." (see also "Croom," "Genki")

Frued - God of Sexual Abstinance and Anal Retention.
 
G
Gates, Daryl F. - Renowned for his liberal drug enforcement

Genki - The state of Pure Bliss and Utter Lack of Froom.
Gentle Persuasion - A book by OTISian Preacher Tim Howland.
Geoffe, Pope - (see "Jeffe, Pope")

     seriously damaging their vehicles or persons.
Grbl - God of Suffering.
Great Purple Brotherhood - The great army of true and loyal
     Otisians, in or out of physical bodies.  More primitive
     creeds have attempted to imitate this title but lacking the
     scientific sophistication of Otisianism they have mistaken
     the mostly ultra-violet color referred to in the title for
     white and thus began the long and sad association of white
     with "good" and black with "bad." 
Green shoes - An important part of the Papal Regalia.
Groundhog Love Hodgepodge Extravaganza - A radio show of Otis
     that preached dogma to the masses and saved many
     individuals.
 
H
Hallucinogenetics - Something which needs inventing.
Hathormuta - Incarnation of Heethor as Protectrix of Yaks.  Not
     that Yaks need any special protection from Otisians as all

Haystack Monument - Site of Pope Jeoffe 1 of the Infinite
     Spellings and Preacher Tim of the House of Blue Light's
     first vision.
Heethor - The Paisley Goddess, "She Who Never Straightly Doth

     good Otisians on the Wyntr Solstice).
Heethorandhafter - Incarnation of Heethor as She Who Talks To
     People In Boxes.  (see also "Heethor")
Heethormas - A common Otisian name for the Wyntr Solstice.  The
     full 16 Days of Heethormas are rarely celebrated anymore but
     the lesser Four Days are still observed.
Heethor's Hernia - An Otisian oath.
Heethymthombang - Incarnation of Heethor as Our Lady of
     Unexpected Plot Twists.  (see also "Heethor")
Henry - God of Gerbils.
Hexidecimal - (see "Base sixteen")
High Altitude Tibetan Bovine - (see "Yak")
Himie Azif - Chief Architect of the Temple of Otis at Akshak.
Ho-ho - An ancient Otisian greeting for times of crisis and

What is gopher you ask. Gopher is the program that contacts servers all
over the internet and allows you to collect/read and find all manner of

 Actually, this infamous movie was filmed! According to the article in Spy,
(May 1992, "Jerry Goes to Death Camp!") the film was called "The Day the
Clown Cried" and was filmed around 1972. It exists in a rough cut! The
story was about an unhappy German clown sent to a concentration camp to
become sort of a genocidal Pied Piper, entertaining Jewish children as he
leads them to the gas chambers. The screenplay was written by Charles
Denton and Joan O'Brien and the film was directed by the nutty professor
himself. The movie starred Lewis, Harriet Andersson, and Sven Lindberg.
 
 Harry Shearer is one of the few who have supposedly seen this picture and
comments "This movie is so drastically wrong, its pathos and comedy are so
badly misplaced, that you could not, in your fantasy of what it might be
like, improve on what it really is. 'Oh my God!'-- that's all you can say.

Fact File for Otis/Otisian/InterGalactic House of Fruitcakes
Version 1.0       by "Doc" Simpson


Q: Who is Otis?
A: Otis is the Ancient Sumerian God/dess of Life.  Otis is also
sometimes said to be Atlantian or Extraterrestrial.  There is
considerable confusion about the biological sex of Otis.  S/He is
alternately male, female, hermaphroditic, and asexual.  Otis is
rarely depicted as an anthropomorphic figure, more commonly S/He
is represented by the Otis Symbol.


Q: What is the Otis Symbol?
A: Four arrows pointing outwards at right angles.  Three are
joined together at the center but the top arrow is drawn cut off
from the lower three.  Some say that this represents the myth in
which Otis's head is cut off and never recovered.  Others say it
looks pretty.


Q: What does this have to do with Otis Elevators?
A: Elevators represent the 44-fold path to Genkiiness.


Q: What does this have to do with Otis, Massachusetts?
A: Otis, Massachusetts is the site of the Haystack Monument where
the Great Haystack Monument Vision was revealed to Pope Jeffe and
Preacher Tim.


Q: What does this have to do with Otis in the movie Animal House?
A: That's Otis.  He loves us.


Q: What does this have to do with Otis, the drunk, on the Andy
Griffiths show?
A: Otis, the drunk, represents the soul intoxicated by pure
joyful union with Otis.


Q: What is Otisianism?
A: The humourous religion that worships Otis.  This religion is
notable for its general lack of ideology, its colorful mythology
and rituals, and its rapidly evolving dogma.
     In addition to Otis, many other deities are worshiped.  The
most important are Lotus, Rotos, and Spode.  Recently, Brow and
Heethor have also risen to promenance.  Other gods include Arani,
Creiza, Frude, Reaf, Papsucker, Nepha, Mharillyn, Reiod, and
Sannio among many others.  In addition to Gods, many demi-gods,
heroes, and saints are prayed to for intercession with the Gods.
Special rituals are performed to avoid the influence of
Otisianism's many demons and devils, especially B-Otis-2, the
Sinister Ladies of Mystery, the Four Bad Horsies of the
Apocalypse, and the twin demiurges, Veesa and Ameks.


Q: What is the InterGalactic House of Fruitcakes?
A: The IGHF is the only fully-registered Otis-worshipping
organization on this pathetic little planet.  It is currently
headed by Pope Jephe I.  The address is: IGHF, 955 Massachusetts
Ave, Suite 209, Cambridge, MA 02139-9183, USA.


Q: Who is Pope Jephe I?
A: Pope Jeffe (who spells his name many different ways) received,
along with Preacher Tim, the Haystack Monument Vision that
revitalized the dying Otisian religion and built it up from
decaying rubble to the mighty edifice that it is now.  His early
life is shrouded in mystery but it is said that his coming was
foretold by the alien intelligence X-Suh and that he manifested
many miraculous signs as a child.


Q: Why is Pope Geofe a pope?  Is Otisianism a form of
Catholicism?
A: Pope Jeffie is the 13th modern Pope of Otisianism.  The first
modern Pope was the great Victorian scientist and philosopher
Adolph Jordan.  Although Jordan was a member of many religious
groups including the Theosophists, the Anthroposophists, the
Swedenborgians, the Rosicrucians, the Golden Dawn, the OTO, and
the Anglicans, he was never a member of the Roman Catholic
Church.  He got the idea of calling the high priest of the newly
resurrected Otisian church "pope" from the fact that the last
Otisian high priest of antiquity, Publius Encolpius Ebriosus, was
a "pontifex" in the Roman "college" system.  Jordan identified
this with the title "pontifex maximus" given to the Bishop of
Rome.


Q: Is this the same as the Cult of Otis?
A: No.  The Cult of Otis worships a serial killer on death row in
Texas.  There is a slight possibility that the Cult of Otis might
be related to the Black Brothers of Rotos, a monastic order that
worships the Black Armchair of Death.  However, most Otisians
don't see very much funny in serial killers.


Q: Who is Lotus?
A: The God of Peace, Possessor of Dung, and an all-around sweet
guy.  His main holy day is August 2nd, Loaf Day, when good
Otisians loaf off all day.  Doing any form of unpleasant work is
considered an unpardonable sin.


Q: Who is Rotos?
A: The God of Death, King of the Underworld, Keeper of the Rubber
Chicken.  His main holy day is October 31st, Brew Mare's Day,
when starved Otisians dress in wild costumes and make a ritual
meal out of any female horse in their path.


Q: Who is Spode?
A: The God of Confusion.  His main holiday is May 1st, Bell Ring
Day, when some Otisians sneak up behind people and ring loud
bells while others have sex with nameless strangers.  One of
Spode's most powerful incarnations, Edward Spodick of Hong Kong,
may be reached on BITNet at LBSPODIC@USTHK.BITNET


Q: Who is Heethor?
A: The Paisley Goddess, She Who Doth Never Nothing Straightly Do.
She has appeared in billions of different incarnations over the
years and her High Priest, Mal 3, is the editor of Purps.  Her
main holy day is Heethormas, December 21st.  She appears in her
avatar of Heethor Claus to deliver toys to small children.


Q: Who is Brow?
A: The God of Mindless Violence.  His main festival is celebrated
on June 21st, Smashmas.  Devout Otisians break large delicate
object into small fragments and dance naked around the burning
remains.


Q: Are there any rules in Otisianism?
A: Yes, four.
     1. Never play cards with a man named "Doc."
     2. Never eat at a place called "Mom's."
     3. Never sleep with a woman whose troubles are worse than
          your own.
     4. Everything forbidden is optional.


Q: What is the meaning of the fez?
A: It is a very ancient Otisian symbol.  The fez is always worn
by the Pope and many other devout Otisians.  Giant stone fezzes
still stand in the Gobi desert as a testament to the great
Otisian civilization that flourished there before the Eye of
Rotos was turned upon it.


Q: What is the meaning of the yak?
A: The original Otisian Yak was the Wild Sumerian Yak, now
extinct thanks to Operation Desert Storm.  However, Otisians now
use Tibetan Yaks for their rituals.


Q: Why do Otisians toss yaks?
A: Otisians do not now, nor have they ever, tossed yaks.  That is
a very nasty unpleasant rumour started by their enemies, the
Zakynthians, to ruin their reputations.  All reports of Otisian
yak tossing should be ignored as cheap fabrications.


Q: Who are the Zakynthians?
A: Evil people who sacrifice babies, torture animals, destroy
rainforests, cause unemployment and inflation, undermine family
values, and eat dinner with their salad fork.  They have been the
mortal enemies of the righteous saintly Otisian religion for
11,000 years.  The insidious mind-control devices that the
Zakynthians have installed outside of all major cities may be
counteracted with lots of tin foil.


Q: Honestly now, is there any historical truth in this stuff?
A: Of course, everything in Otisianism is true.  However,
relatively little is documented in non-partisan sources.  A quick
survey of easily verified second-party references is included for
the sceptical.  Otis is mentioned in passing in cuneiform tablets
from Akshak but is given a much more lengthy treatment in Greek
mythology (spelled Otos).  Arani (spelled Arinna) was known to
the Hittites and is attested to in the theophoric name "Aranare"
in Minoan Crete.  Both Heethor (Hathor) and Nepha (Nephthys) are
well-known in Egyptian mythology.  Spode appears in Egyptian
astrology (Spd) and in Hellenistic drinking rituals (Spodos
Kulikon).  Rotos's name survives in the place-names Rhodos
(Rhodes) and Rotomagus (Rouen) which were important cult-centers.
Lotus (Padma) is still commonly worshiped in Hinduism.


Q: What makes Otisianism better than, or even different from,
Erisianism, the Church of the Subgenius, the Reformed Hassidic
Druids, the Church of Beaver Cleaver, or any of the many other
humourous religions around today?
A: Otisianism officially recognizes the Erisians as a sister
faith of great wisdom with whom the old Greek temples of Otos had
many ties in antiquity.  However, now that the hippies are all
fat suburban bureaucrats or New Age gurus and LSD has become a
"dangerous narcotic" the wind is all out of their sails.  None of
those who have laid claim to the name recently has shown one
sixteenth of the brilliance of the original Principia Discordia.
     The SubGenii are over the hill but not dead yet.  "Bob" is
held in orthodox Otisianism to be "the name that may not be
spoken."  Any high school-educated McDonald's check-out clerk can
see the humour in a saviour named "Bob."  For this reason (and
their adverts on MTv) the Church of the SubGenius will always
attract the bulk of the herd.  As far as those who worship Otis
are concerned, they are welcome to them.
     Otisianism is a gourmet taste, like snails or chocolate-
covered ants, that even the hard-core gastronomic adventurer may
pass up.  Otisian doctrine is obscure, complex, and rapidly
changing.  Hours of research may be required to discover that
obscene pun in Swahili or tasteless reference to Hurrian funeral
practice.  One contributor's inside joke about Joseph Conrad may
be seized upon by a second contributor to be the basis of her
rewrite of a Bavarian fairy tale in a science-fiction setting.
This creates endless layers of silliness that not even the most
astute Otisian observer, certainly not the participants
themselves, could ever hope to completely untangle.  Many items
of Otisian dogma are also propagated for a limited time only,
such as the Otisian Weekly Mailings.


Q: Are there any Otisian periodicals?
A: There are four important ones at this writing.
     The "Otisian Directory" (and its occasional companion, the
"Otisian Yellow Pages") is put together by Pope Jefi himself.
This magazine is usually a mixture of Otisian dogma and art with
reviews of other zines and music.  Often the reviews are shot
through with long digressions on Otisian theology, politics, or
autobiography by the Pope.  The digressions are frequently more
interesting than the works being reviewed.  The Otisian Directory
is about four bucks per issue from the InterGalactic House of
Fruitcakes, above.
     The "Otisian Weekly Mailings" are solid dogma in collage
form, usually one page each, almost never once a week.  Again,
the Pope writes this himself so its frequency is dependent upon
cash flow and work load at his day job.  In theory, every Otisian
should fervently worship, for that one week only, the item or
concept expounded in the Weekly Mailing.  Send "some cash" and
see how long he'll keep you on the list.  Highly recommended.
     "By the Balls of Brow" is edited by Rev. John, Otisianism's
US presidential candidate.  It is a compilation of the very best
Otisian texts along with original art.  "By the Balls of Brow"
seems to come out once a year and costs four bucks.  It is
available from Pagan Publishing, 1409 Wilson Ave, Columbia, MO
65201 who also print a fantastic Call of Cthulhu magazine.
Highly Recommended.
     "The Purple Thunderbolt of Spode" is affectionately known as
"Purps" to most Otisians.  Purps is an electronic magazine
available on InterNet, BitNet, and associated computer networks.
It is edited by the infamous Mal 3.  Great gobs of Otisian
mythology are first brought to light there and it constitutes
that fastest moving theological forum in Otisianism.  If you have
access to such a computer net, Purps is a MUST!  It is available,
completely free of charge, by writing to
HailOtis@SocPsy.Sci.FAU.Edu  It is available in snail-mail form
(send SASE) from SBI-Submarine Pens, 4521 S. Ocean Blvd, Highland
Beach, FL 33487.
     At least two magazines that ran early Otisian material, the
"Owl Creek Journal" and "Gateway," are now defunct but many more
are in the planning stage, including one in Polish from Doc
Simpson.  Keep your ears pricked for new developments.


Q: Is there an Otisian book?
A: The "Peganagyo" (author unknown), the "Batrakhomuomakhia" by
Pigres of Karia, the "Verae Historia" by Lucian, and the
"Necronomicon" by Abdul Alhazred are all rather old Otisian works
that may be found in almost any university library worth its
salt.  The complete works of Adolph Jordan are somewhat harder to
find.  A new book designed to appeal to a modern age is, at this
writing, in the works.  Please be waiting for what is sure to be
its world-shaking publication some time in autumn 1993.

 First heard this on the news this week. This came through on the UPI wire
and I thought readers would find it amusing.


 HEADLINE: Phone sex reaches out to Girl Scout callers

    Some callers who want to use an 800 number to reach the Girl Scout's
local office instead get to hear a seductive telephone sex service message.

     The Girl Scouts' 800 number, which it used since 1984, was dropped
last year. But the listing remains in telephone books distributed last
month by Ameritech Publishing.

     An unidentified sex line snapped up the number, which spells out
800-BAD-GIRL.

     A voice greets callers with a "Hi lover. Call us love right now ...
for the wildest sex party ever."

     Callers are then told to call another 800 number and instructed to
leave their phone numbers for a return collect call.

     "We're not pleased at all," said Jane Crites, executive director of
the Applesee Ridge Girl Scout Council. "The message you get is surely not
reflective of the Girl Scout program."

     AT&T told Girl Scout officials said they would try to persuade the
sex-line operator to agree to place a block on the line on the number in
northwest Ohio.

     Callers from northwestern Ohio now get a recording stating that the
number was out of service in the 419 area code.

     Ana Gabriel, an AT&T spokeswoman who would not reveal the identity of
the sex-line operator, said the company could not force the telephone sex
line to make the change. She said AT&T has a policy of waiting six months
before re-assigning telephone numbers.
