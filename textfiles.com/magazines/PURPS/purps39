Well here we are again with another issue of Purps. I wanted to throw more
Messenger of the Gods into this but deadlines came and went and I figured it
would be best if I just send this out.

Summer is here, and hopefully that means they'll be a lot more time for me
to devote to Purps. Hopefully I can finally get organized after the great
Lulu exodus and what not.

This issue will hopefully contain many exciting OTISian things for you to
ponder over, including a glossary by the infamous Doc Simpson. (I have more
material from him which will be appearing at a later date.)

One of the problems I've been experiencing lately once again, is lack of
submissions. OTIS needs your submissions! Submit! Submit! Submit! I would
like to note however, that some folks have been sending us submissions and
no doubt OTIS will bless them for it. It's just that those aren't enough.
We need to hear from more people. Surely there are tons of nifty OTIS related
things to submit!

Of course I could put in a dire warning that an entire issue might have to
be written by me. We all know what that means *shudder*.

Anyway, on with the show.

Since you brought it up . . .

   "When Kellogg Co. introduced Frosted Rice in 1977, it received letters
from consumers who had discovered it was possible to pick the stuff up with
a strong magnet.

    According to a company spokesman, 'We had problems evenly distributing
the product's sugar coating,' wherein most of the iron was concentrated.
Rather than attempt to even out the iron content, Kellogg simply reduced it
from 25 percent of the FDA recommended daily allowance to 10 percent.  In a
statement to _The Wall Street Journal_, Kellogg promised that the new,
improved -- and demagnetized -- version could not be lifted with magnets
'unless they are very, very strong.'"

Subject: "bob" campeau
From: suddenly@leland.Stanford.EDU (David Smith)
Date: Fri, 24 Apr 92 23:32:22 GMT

Here is an excerpt from John Rothchild's book " Going for Broke: How Robert
Campeua bankrupted the retail industry..."  The quotations around "Bob" are
the author's.

"...Almost everyone I did interview, from the top bankers and deal-makers
down to the people who had no more than a passing acquaintance with
Campeau, referred to the man as "Bob."  It was never "Mr. Campeau" or even
"Robert Campeau," just "Bob." Journalists who are accustomed to using the
last names only called Campeau "Bob."  Ex-business partners, whether they
liked him or not, did the same.  This was so prevalent that I began calling
him "Bob" in my questions, in spite of the fact that we'd never met. "What
did Bob say," I'd ask a source," when Citicorp discovered he didn't have any
equity?"  Or," How often did Bob get his sheep injections in Germany?"

That so many individuals with whom Campeau was linked casually and/or
professionally would call him "Bob" must mean something. From what I can
gather, it wasn't the familiar "Bob" that is customarily applied to friends
and neighbors, because Campeau remained aloof, an enigma even to his
closest associates. It was more a bemused "Bob" offered in amazement at his
endearing and baffling antics, not the least of which was taking over two
major corporations with virtually no money down..."

No, I am not making this up.

Was so thrilled to find message that my subscription to PURPS had been
accepted.  I mean, who knows how many committees and security checks my
application had to go through!  Anyway, as I was leaving the computer lab,
my head bowed in grateful thanks, the elevator doors opened and what did I
see?  OTIS!  Written right there on the floor of the elevator!  I know
you're thinking that OTIS is the elevator company name, but I had been in
that elevator millions of other times, and never noticed that OTIS was
written on the floor.  It was a cosmic experience, like...like..a
THUNDERBOLT had hit me!  I'll never forget it.

   Could you give me some background on OTIS and Spode?  Not that every-
thing I've read so far doesn't make perfect sense or anything, just for my
own personal use I'd like to hear the history.  Thanks much.

                                        Deb

[The fastest and easiest way to get background on OTIS and Spode is to read the
back issues of Purps. (Available from HailOtis@socpsy.sci.fau.edu or from
quartz.rutgers.edu in the /pub/journals/purps directory.) Of course there are
also tons of printed material as well. Most of this has not made it's way
onto the network. The worship of OTIS only recently moved onto the
Internet. Before that, it was going strongly through the mail, by word of
mouth, and the traveling OTIS Medicine show.

Of course the best way to get more "stuff" about OTIS is to send money to
the IGHF (address at top). That is the address you also need to use if you
want to get initiated into the deeper mysteries of OTISianism. They'll teach
you how to Summon Brow For Tea among other things.

Of course, if you know the signs and signals, you can contact The Most
Ancient Order Of The Knights Of OTIS.

Finally, there is a set of Doc Simpson's lectures on The Ancient History of
OTIS. These however are not readily available due to the good Doctor
constantly being busy. The best place to get a hold of those would be to
write to the IGHF as well.

As for things not making sense to you, well, that takes time. OTIS is a
very complex and ancient religion. Traditions passed down over thousands of
years can sometimes cause the original concepts to become a bit garbled.

Take for example a Samaritan Priest and bring him to our time. Then say to
him "E.T. phone home." This phrase would make absolutely no sense to him.
Now reverse the time element. For example an Ancient Knight of OTIS comes
up to you and says "XXXXXXXXXX XXXXXX XXXXXXX XX XXXXXXX" (NOTE: Mystical
Phrase censored because you have not sent the IGHF enough money to even be
given a hint that this phrase exists.) As you see, confusion results.

To become unconfused, you must delve deeply into the "stuff" of OTIS, and
even then the truth may escape you because OTIS is giving you one of her
"tests of faith." ]

Pat Bucannons last speech was incredible. He stated all the reasons why he
thought America was in decline and it was all because of a decline in moral
values throughout the land. Art, Movies, the Press, MTV, public TV, the
radio all came under attack for one reason or another. He thinks that
America should get all of these under very strict control for greater moral
integrity. Well all right Pat my boy, I think you should enforce strict OTIS
morality.

 1) "Hail OTIS!" must be stated or written on every piece of mass public media
    every 30 minutes, or every 4 square yards.
 2) Every American must eat at least one chili dog each week or be lathered
    in mustard in public.
 3) All politicians are heretofore required to begin each sentence with an
    apology.
 4) Any gratuitous display of sensibility should be met with swift
    beatings with wet noodles(Pat will enjoy that one).

[Actually, the OTISians do have a political party. You need to see issues
about 20 -30 for all the dope on it. Alas, as of late, the driving force
behind this political movement, mainly Humpy the Stumpy Bear, has been lost
in vortex of some sort due to some irresponsible experimentation on the
part of one of our South Florida OTISians. Hopefully this situation will be
fixed very soon.]

Network Wind Profiler Severely Damaged

A wind profiler in OAR's Wind Profiler Demonstration Network (WPDN) was
severely damaged by several shot-gun blasts late last week.  On March 28,
just before sunrise, two men and one woman were pheasant hunting in
southern Nebraska [and] came across the McCook wind profiler and mistook it
for an alien spacecraft.  Frightened, they fired a number of shots damaging
the profiler antenna and the electronics shed.  Furthermore, a Forecast
Systems Lab (FSL) technician who was in the shed conducting routine system
checks was taken hostage by the hunters.  After being held captive for
nearly two hours, the technician's partner arrived and explained to the
hunters what the profiler really was.  The hunters then fled and so far,
they have not been apprehended by law enforcement officials.  Profiler
damage is estimated at $150,000.

     - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = -

A profiler (developed in the building where I work) is a phase-array radar
which "looks" nearly straight up.  The basic model can determine wind
direction and speed from the ground to about 50 mb (around 20km, at a
guess); a recently developed enhancement can also determine air temperature
up to the tropopause. They are used in a manner similar to weather
balloons, but provided hourly summaries instead of 12-hour reports.  (They
operate continuously, but the data is rather noisy).

I've never seen an actual profiler on the ground, but the models and
artist's conceptions show a flat rectangular grid.  Coworkers describe it
as a "construction junkyard", or "flat pipes" held about 4 ft above the
ground.

Of course, those of us in the mountains have a very low opinion of
plains-dwellers.  Several meteorologists on a "storm chase" last year
reported on Kansan walking up to them (on the side of the road) and asking
"Is that a tornado?"  What he thought the large funnel cloud a few miles
away was, if not a tornado, nobody has every figured out...

Hey everyone!  Did you know that Microsoft is advocating the killing of
Jews in New York City?  I sure didn't!  But it's true!  I read it in the
paper!

Get ready for a whopper.  Once again the news media proves that it doesn't
know the first thing about computers.  The entire story, retransmitted
without permission, is below, as it appeared in today's New York Post.

For those who don't know, the Post is a tabloid paper, where the entire
front page is one huge headline.  So, screaming out at millions of New
Yorkers this morning was the headline, "PROGRAM OF HATE".  Above the
headline is a photo of one of those old PC green-screen displays, with
"NYC" = <skull> <Star of David> <thumbs-up sign> superimposed on the
screen.  Above that is a subheadline, "Millions of computers carry secret
message that urges death to Jews in New York City..."

So, without further ado, here's the story:

ANTI-JEWISH CODE LURKS IN POPULAR SOFTWARE, by Don Broderick

 One of the world's best-selling computer programs contains a secret
anti-Semitic message apparently urging death to Jews in New York City.
 A computer consultant discovered the diabolic message while installing
Microsoft's new Windows 3.1 software for a client yesterday.
 The consultant was testing a mailing-address use of the program when he
noticed the letters "NYC" had been replaced by a hateful message - a skull
and crossbones, the Star of David and an approving thumbs-up symbol.
 Microsoft strongly denies any hidden message.  Others disagree.
 "There's no way it could be a random coincidence," said Brian Young, a
friend of the consultant, who does not wish to be named.
 "It's pretty scary.  I was pretty shocked by the whole thing."
 Computer owners who use Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word or any other Microsoft
program containing a print font named "Wingdings" can duplicate the
anti-Semitic message by typing the letters "NYC" on their screen.
 Microsoft said "Wingdings" was designed by Bigelow and Holmes, an outside
vendor, and denied that Microsoft intentionally designed the secret message.
 Prof. Charles Bigelow confirmed that his company provided the symbols, but
insisted that Microsoft made the final "mapping" decisions assigning his
symbols to specific keys on the keyboard.
 But a senior Microsoft spokesman said the charge that the fonts contain a
hidden message is "outrageous."
 "It's like saying that if you randomly type out characters on a keyboard to
spell 'Satan', you can do that, but it's incredible to say that there's
anti-Semitism in Microsoft or one of its vendors," said Charles Hemingway.
 But Young, who discussed the matter with other computer consultants, isn't
so sure it's just a coincidence.
 The "Wingdings" font contains no letters - just 255 symbols.
 Young calculated the odds of three letters of the alphabet being combined
with 255 symbols, and said he found that the odds of obtaining the message 
were less than one in a trillion.
 "It's mind-blowing," said Young.  "Somebody's responsible for this.  This
is very offensive."
 "I found it hard to believe some of the stories about the resurgence of
Nazi sympathizers - but this puts things back into perspective."
 Microsoft, based in Seattle, is the world's biggest software publisher,
with 100 million customers around the world and sales of more than $2.3
billion in 1991.
 When Windows 3.0 was introduced in 1990, customers were snapping it up at
the rate of 30,000 a week.

-- end of article

Above the story is a line of some of the various symbols in the "Wingdings"
font, with the caption:  "LOADED: When a specific font is used in
Microsoft's Windows, these symbols, which correspond to the alphabet,
appear.  Type the letters NYC, you get the death sign, the Star of David
and the thumbs-up."

So what do you all think?  Should we load up the buses and make a pilgrimage
to Redmond to firebomb Bill Gates's mansion, or what?

Subject: How Do I Luv Ewe ?  Let Me Count The Ways
Date: 14 May 92 09:58:54 GMT

A week or so ago, a friend of mine told me that he had received in the post
an invitation to purchase an inflatable sheep as a sex aid.  "No bleating
to alert your neighbours" he'd said it claimed.

I thought "Yeah, yeah, yeah", another wind-up (my friend's wife usually
gets the brunt of his gems, one of which caused a minor security alert on
the local American military base - I promise I'm not making any of this
up).

Then today I read a reported judgement from the Advertising Standards
Authority, in which it was claimed a couple had replied to an advertisement
for rechargeable batteries and had subsequently been offered the inflatable
sheep (called 'Luv Ewe').

The advert contained a drawing and the statement "She has been developed
after years of research into how to bring the joy of sheep into your love
life without the obvious problems of a real sheep.  No bleating to alert
neighbours. No risk of ruining your prize lawn.".

Puns already tossed in my direction include instructions not to ram
anything too hard into it, ewe might look a bit sheepish afterwards, if you
had half a dozen of them you'd be well on the way to having a damned good
flock, is that what a woolly jumper really is, very handy to have if you're
on the lam, sounds like a bleating good baa-gain, I hear it's shear heaven,
and it's just what your wellies were designed for.

Has anyone else come across such exotica, or is the UK spearheading the
move towards the greater involvement of animals in our daily lives ?

I'd buy one, only I just can't stand the thought of having to run round the
front every so often to kiss it.

 Man Strips, Quacks After Committee Denies His Orals

 CHAPEL HILL -- An upset graduate student was arrested after he stripped
off his clothes and quacked like a duck when his orals application was
denied. "It was a first for us," Department spokesperson Fred Brooks said.
The unidentified almost 30-year-old man was seated naked in a professor's
office in the graphics department when police arrived Thursday.  Officials
said he replied with duck quacks when questioned by police.
 
 After his arrest, police said he caused $1,000 damage to a police vehicle
by butting his head into a window frame and kicking a door.
 
 Magistrate Gabe Quintanilla ordered the man held for psychiatric
evaluation. Committee officials would not disclose why the man's orals were
rejected.
