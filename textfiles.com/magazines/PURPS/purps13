INTRODUCTION
(Everything Forbidden is Optional)

       While I realize it's not fashionable these days, I have
always had an abiding faith in superstition.  I have never been
able to step on a crack without cringing or make a hopeful
comment without rapping the nearest piece of plywood.  I believe
in rice at wedings, and I doge the corsage there when ever
possible.  Ladders, spilled salt, balck cats, all give me the
jitters.  I will not speak ill of the dead.

       And here we are on issue 13.  Well, so far the magic is
working.  Two friends decided it would be funny to drop a tour
group into my hands ("Tell them a little bit about the vax")
while I was CAing yesterday, on Friday I was forced to pledge
myself to 10-20pgs of my comps done in a single week, and
apparently several of my friends here have given up associating
with me altogether.

       Sigh.

       I knew I should have skipped straight to 14.

       Judging from this issue, things will only get worse.  The
administration may very well take offence at the "S**T" list,
edited as it is, liberals will probably object to the
satanization of Santa Claus, conservatives will surely grill me
on the "Top Ten" list for Bush's State of the Union Address, and,
now that I've advertised it, Scott will probably tell me that the
surprise this year is that they aren't REALLY giving me a b-day
party at all haha, and I'll be mugged by the 7,000 people who've
already paid their two bucks.

             My excuse for all this offensive material?

             It was all so FUNNY....

PURPS.STUFF

GOOD OTIS IT GROWS!  Since we last talked, over 60 files have
been added to the archives.  Many of these deal with the current
war, and they won't be around long, as soon as I fill my quota
(only 500 blocks to go) I will start deleting the oldest files
there.  They represent, in my humble opinion, very good coverage
of the war, they are completely un-censored, and contain lots of
information (like body counts, and the recent assassinations in
Turkey) which have appeared no where else in the media.  Read
them.  War time is a lousy time to be apathetic Kenyon students.

OTISIAN NEWS

WHAT WILL THE COLLEGE DO when the channel Six (four?) news team
and the Columbus branch of the Hell's Angels show up at my
birthday party THIS FRIDAY?  Hard to say... but you can FIND OUT
FOR YOURSELF, by showing up at lower Dempsey at 10:00pm- 2:00am. 
Beacuse we are not a fraternity, have something like 17 musicians
playing (including Pimentos for Gus and, we hope, a certain
faculty member), there will be a two dollar cover charge
(musicians like to be PAID, don't ya know?).  However, for that
you get a heck of a lot of entertainment (including FREE BEER!
HAIL OTIS!) and the chance to meet and dance with some of the
strangest people on the face of the planet. (HAIL OTIS!)  Folks,
this is looking like the best party this campus has seen in a
LONG while; you would do well to attend, everyone in the WORLD is
invited, feel free to bring friends and bodyguards.

        Concern has often been expressed on this page about the

        This particularly applies to the academic world, where people
have a tendency to lose sight of the obvious.

Concerning Die Hard II, it has also been noted that if someone wanted to
make a movie about an airport seizure that traps dozens of planes in the
air, they could have picked a better setting.  Washington-National (I think
it was supposed to be National rather than Dulles, but it's been a while)
has TWO other international airports within about a half-hour's flight time.

The name of this handmaid was "Offred".  Other handmaids were named
"Ofglen" and "Ofwarren", and possibly others.  This is somewhat important
to the film, since it demonstrates the degree of subjection of the
handmaids.
They no longer had names of their own - just "of" attached to the name of
their current commander.  If "Offred" had later been assigned to Glen,
her name would become "Ofglen".  Fun, huh?

OTISIAN RANTS

(in which everything worth knowing about absolutely everything will be
revealed!)

[THIS WEEK: The Pope's B-day Speech, Do the Illuminati control Santa Claus,
is Elvis Dead, More!]

POPE'S B-DAY SPEECH

   There are two things about that other Pope that have always bothered me;
that bubble car and that damned window.  The fact that he can go shooting
around in that little white modified golf cart under a bullet proof bubble
and a full police escort while I'm stuck in a dopey little 78 citation with
a "Caution Wide Load" sticker on the front bumper and a dollar 98 K-Mart
imitation police siren on the hood is bad enough, but then he gets the
window.

   Here's a quick note for all you power mongers, if you want to be an
insistant success do the following: find a cheap, fourth floor apartment
somewhere with a window over-looking a small courtyard and start giving well
advertized but difficult to hear speeches about the state of the world.  It
helps if you keep the speeches short and put a few of your best friends in
the audience to cheer really loudly at odd intervals, drowing out your
words.  When your speeches are over hold impromptu press confrences with the
78 media organizations you anounced the speech to in a very small room
elsewhere in the apartment.  After the press has sat there squished for 25
minutes, send an official representative to appologize profusely that the
pope has had some urgent bit of business come up and cannot attend today.

   Blamo.  Instant success.

   It's not that I'm jealous or anything, but there is something about giving
speeches from a window or ledge that seems to give people instant
credibility, and instant association with the larger than life.  (Hell, look
what it did for Mussolini).  U.S. presidents seem to prefer the casual
approach, televised chats by the fireside with the dog and a kid, but I
think the verdict of history (Curchill, Hitler, Napolean, Lennin, Stalin) is
clear: if you want your message to stick, wizz 'em with a window or a ledge.

   Every year, while making this speech and promoting the good wholesome
values of the OTISian faith, I think of that other Pope, and every year I
make a point of asking for something real tall to stand on and make
proclamations from, but, with the exception of a single soapbox from
Preacher Tim, no one ever responds.  So once again I have climbed up onto
the oficial Papal CHAIR to give you my views on the past year.

   Well, forget it.  This year I'm holding out for a ledge.
   
                                                               PJ

Subject: A little light humour....do you realize that Santa Claus is an
 Illuminati plot?
Date: Tue, 25 Dec 90 19:13:24 EST

Yes, Santa Claus is actually an illuminati plot to make all Xians worship
Satan.  Just look at the evidence before you...

    1.  Santa/Satan name anagram
    2.  Dresses in Red and black
    3.  Friend of cloven-hoofed beasts
    4.  Lots of little "elf" helpers.
    5.  Lives in a cave in an isolated place
    6.  Knows who's been naughty and nice
    7.  Seduces people with large amounts of materialistic gifts/favors
    8.  Flies through the air on the night BEFORE Christmas.  This is VERY
        similar to evil spirits flying through the air the night BEFORE
        All Saints Day (Halloween)
    9.  Uses "magic" to enter your house.
    10.  Is immortal.
    11. One of them is known as "Saint Nick", the other "Old Nick"

Subject: Is Elvis Really Dead? (Happy Birthday anyways!)

NASA'S GALILEO PROBE FINDS NO EVIDENCE FOR ELVIS ON EARTH

The Galileo science team today announced that the spacecraft's
instruments failed to find any new traces of Elvis  Presley during its
flyby of Earth last December 8th.

"It's a tough background subtraction problem," explained Dr. Edward B.
Rock of Caltech.  "We know the planet contains several thousand Elvis
imitators.  You have to distinguish the real thing from many objects
of similar apperance."

The method used involved interdisciplinary comparison from several of
Galileo's sensors.  "For example, an Elvis imitator would have a very
similar appearance to Elvis in the SSI [Solid State Imaging] and NIMS
[Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer] data," said Dr. Graham Finale.
"But no imitator has Elvis's magnetism."  Researchers combined data
from Galileo's sensitive magnetometer, mounted on a 36-foot (11 meter)
boom, with optical, infrared, and ultraviolet measurements.  They are
capable of identifying a single genuine Elvis among all the other
features of Earth's landscape.  This is a very sensitive technique-- a
feat equivalent to standing in St. Joseph, Missouri, and
distinguishing a jellybean in a bowl of amphetamines in Memphis.

Galileo investigators were cautious about ruling out the possible
existence of Elvis.  "We can only set an upper limit," said Dr. Rock.
"And we're guessing to some extent at the profile we're looking for.
If Elvis has lost weight, for instance, he'd have a different infrared
signature."  According to the science team, there are 0.21 plus or
minus 0.17 Elvises on Earth, a number described as "consistent with
zero."

Though speculation has been published in some journals that evidence
for Elvis might exist on other planets and moons in our solar system,
most scientists agree that Earth is the most likely place to find him.
"If, as the new results suggest, there's no Elvis on Earth," said Dr.
Torrance California, "this lends weight to the supposition that he
really is dead."

----- End Forwarded Message -----

Which reminds me.....

In some article summarizing the significance of 1990, I did see
a quote from a psychic to the effect that "It was more likely
that Elvis was alive this year than it has been for the past
several years."  Perhaps the .21 Elvises found by the Galileo probe
is only a harbinger of greater numbers of Elvises to come. *GASP* *shock*
NOOOOOOOOOOO.......!!!!!!!!!
