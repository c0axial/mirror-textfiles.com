INTRODUCTION
(Is OTIS an Astronaut?)

     Is OTIS an astronaut?  Is "Bob" really a Fuller brush
salesman?  Did Jesus do his own dry cleaning?  How do those
people who claim that the CIA has taken over their mind know this
has happened?  If there's "always" room for Jello, where does it
go after your stomach is full?  Did I REALLY see a seat on the
subway which said "this seat reserved for the elderly", next to a
seat which said "this seat reserved for a handicapped person",
next to two separate seats which both said "this seat reserved
for a person suffering from schizophrenia", or was I just
hallucinating?  Is it true that a Professor here recently asked
for a paper written on "all" sides of a piece of paper?  Why are
hot water faucets always on the left?  Do Yaks feel pain?  Why
did certain people on this campus get more condoms than others
during the recent anti-aids promotion and on what facts was this
decision based (and, not that I'm complaining, but 12!)?

     We Popes have to ask ourselves questions like this every
day.  Mostly the answers never come.  This issue, however, OTIS
has apparently decided to bless me (perhaps even forgiving the
minor, really, damage I recently did to his/her car) by giving me
the answer to another question which has been bothering me
recently: why is it that people on the Purps mailing list so
steadfastly refuse to write for this magazine?  Apparently the
question is moot, for this issue they have.

     We have at least six (possibly seven, pardon me while I fan
the small fire I lit under Dave Zecchin) submissions from our
member list this time around, and, frankly, that makes me PROUD.

     For one thing, I don't need to do any work (HAIL
OTIS!!!!!!!).  For another, it's nice to hear from you all.  And
finally, if the quality's low this time, YOU are to blame.

     With that strongly in mind,  THANKS!

     Now, enjoy.
                                                               PJ

South China Morning Post - 4 February 1991

 _High Risk Holiday with a Touch of Madness_

        Ukranian authorities are offering Soviet and foreign tourists a new
hot ticket - a tour of the radioactive contamination zone around the
Chernobyl reactor that blew up in 1986.
        All trips begin and end with Geiger counter tests to check the
visitors' exposure to radiation.
        If treatment at a radiological medical center is needed, it will be
provided "at no extra charge", the newspaper _Komsomolskaya Pravda_
reported.
        The itinerary planned by a Soviet tour company, Kievturist, will
include the "dead city" of Chernobyl, a radioactive waste dump at Kopachi
and the concrete "sarcophagus" built around the blown-up reactor.

[lots of background stuff left out]

        There is a national programme to resettle the workers who live in
radiated areas, improve their medical care and constantly provide them
with "clean food".
        Each family is given a stipend of about 30 rubles a month (about
[US$50]) so that they can afford the "clean food".
        The cash payment has become known as "coffin money".
        And according to _Komsomolskaya Pravda_, Ukrainians often say that
in
Slavutich, "life is good, but short".

The boy was held at the Ventura county jail.

temperatures of 100 degrees Fahrenheit.
        Not many people know that the little multi-coloured chocolate

by Mars Inc. as strategic candy for military use during World War II.

Subj:   The bi-line of the brown bucket aproacheth

In the name of his most royal high-ness, the grand vizier of the cult of the
brown bucket, I his meek scribe endite this 'lectric letter to thee oh great
birthday otis pope one of shortness with large, large soul:
We must commend our brother/sister faith in his/her continual growth, might
I say explosion on this here mountain.  I must now comment on several things
that have appeared in this most glorious 13th edition of the ptbos.
First of all 13 is a very lucky number for those of us in the truest faith 
of the brown bucket for it represents all that is most perfect in its quite 
roundness: Judas, Fridays, a backer's dozen, usual number of hours of an
acid triptic and so on . . . you could think of many more WE are sure. 
Next: the great wisdom of the brown bucket has revealed that Saint Claus is
not, We at once repeat, NOT a Satanist.  The uneducated boor who suggested
such a thing is definitely on our list of heretics, and no that is not an
honor no matter what that jesu freak scott thinks/believes.  We are deeply
offended, and I think many self respecting practitioners will be also, by
the implication that magic is in the province of Satan, who is usually
considered as Evil, bad and so on.

Magic, if you take the time you dolt to study it, is not a product of Satan,
but the Christian Church, in its great insecurity, defined it arbitrarily as
such in order to maintain power, control etc. over the various sects
evolving at this time in history, ie Late Antiquity.  If you have any
questions our most royal high-ness would be glad to educate you.
The shit list brought many belly laughs to his most royal vizier, and
presently the Grand Council is Considering including portions of it in the
most holy of holies the Book of the Brown Bucket.  WE have advised the Pope
Jephie that he is free to share the outer secrets of the most holy creed,
for yes, we have  proof that the Pope was present at the epiphany shrine in
the large city of Landon on the auspicious day.  All those looking for the
truest faith, and the surest way of avoiding those troublesome mailing lists
and credit cards shall stay tuned for further revelations.  Well
Happy Birthday oh great Pope and we hope the Party leaves a smile on your
most holy visage and a bad taste in your mouth
  This has been a message from his most holy sacredness
                                the Grand Vizier of the Cult of the         

                                    BROWN BUCKET

From:   VAX001::HAMRICK       9-FEB-1991 20:10:42.22
Subj:   His most holiness' proclamation of the truth.

To the Most Holy Papal Body,
   We, seeing in our unique fashion, have hoped that our present
has received your highness upon his birthday.  We do hope that the browness
does indeed meet with your approval.  We also thank you for allowing the 
commander of your secret police to "rant" and present you with the gift.
We have received reports from our numerous informants that the
representative brown bucket was indeed 'abused' as was It's intention.  Even
now the energy of the bucket is undermining the faith of those who were
drawn to its sacred power.  We must continue to discuss the implications of
your eminence's fortunate presence at the time of the Sighting.  It is of
interest that the bucket at the party was said to have contained "only
leaves" as ranted by the Screaming Prophet otherwise known as the Minister
of Slack.  We do know that there were no ritual leaves placed in the bucket,
so we wonder if the heretic had a brief vision our his mind was forcing to
speak the truth of the browness?  We must discuss this with your
graciousness.  I am troubled by the reports I am receiving that the bulk of
the "rants" were styled after the christian heresy and its ranting.  
We must discuss this further.   And for now, let me wish you another year
of Otisian chaos and frivolity.  I would like to become more familiar with
the Otisian calendar of holy days and such.
                                 We must remember to think Brown
                                 
                                 scribe to his most righteousness T. G. V.

Subj:   OTISian rant

                       My Voyage Into The Netherworld
                                 or,
                  how I learned to stop worrying and SPODE

Foggy synapses and repeated self-inflicted blows to the head have left
my memory of the following somewhat hazy and chaotic, but that's not
necessarily a bad thing.

From what I can piece together, I was taking a walk on campus, heading
for the local arcade to exorcise the rising hostility curve I had been
on all morning. Earlier I had come a little too close to throwing a punch
at a sorority girl in the computer lab I work at, and finally ended kicking
a wall panel and knocking out power to a bank of lights. Something told
me to fix this, quick, before anything important happened.

Passing an alley, I stopped, feeling a strange pressure on my mind. I
turned to look and not ten feet away I saw a tattered, filthy man
crawling out of a dumpster. My first reaction was to take a step back,
and then reach into my pocket for some change or something. But the
raggedy man had different intentions that what I surmised.

"Hail OTIS," he cackled, his beard stubble rippling like shag carpet
with every syllable. My hand came partway out of my pocket, spilling
nickels and pennies onto the cement.

The man's eyes gleamed and in a flash he had scrambled over and
scooped up the change. "Hail OTIS, benefactor of scum," he cried
gleefully, "there's a cuppa java for me after all."

By this time I had assimilated what had been going on, and realized
that I had put my best foot forward into something brown and smelly.
Privately, I was amazed that this weirdness had entered my life so
soon after first reading PURPS. The SubG's had taken several weeks
longer to kick in.

The man straightened up, a gleeful grin coming from his pocked and
pitted lips. "Gotta job for ya, Rev, quick & simple. Or so SPODE
says."

"A job? For SPODE? Right, sure, Malaclypse still owes me for the
Shanghai operation, and now this?"

A sly look came into his eyes. "Expense account," he said in a voice
that promised ritzy hotels and free blintzes, "SPODE's given the
go-ahead to offer you an expense account. One mission only, though."

Expense account. The concept rattled around inside my brain. SPODE
was going to pay for this one? I knew I had to be careful. I'd already
lost twenty-three cents in pocket change, and where there's SPODE
there's ire.

What the hell. "Alright, I'll try it. What's the job? Selling GRIT?"

"Nope, nothin' that tough. You just gotta do a little delivery."

"Where to?"

He glanced around to make sure no one was close by, though his oozing
body odor had already taken that precaution.

"Hell," he said, with a quickness that suggested snappy metaphors.

---------------------------------

Some time went by. Things were blurry. I don't know what happened.

---------------------------------

When I came to, I was standing there with the raggedy man on the street.
My fugue had lasted perhaps half a second. I decided it was a bad omen.

"Hell? Doesn't exist. "Bob" foreclosed on the property years ago."

"I know that," the man snapped, "but it's back in business now, and
we need to know why."

"Hell exists again? But that means..."

He nodded, and our eyes rolled heavenwards.

"I seen three flocks o' cherubim since breakfast. God has phased back into
existence and he's taking up his old haunts."

"Christ!" I exclaimed, and then wished I hadn't. "We gotta get rid of him
again, this won't do."

"That's where you come in. Hell is where this all started. Get down there
and check it out."

This one I had to think over. Even with an expense account, I wasn't sure it
was worth it.

Finally, I decided.

"Fuck off," I said, and he did.

THE END

But two days later he came back with SPODE itself. Amazingly, I was still
standing on the same sidewalk, a block away from the arcade. I was very
tired.

"Changed your mind?" asked the conehead of confusion.

"Yes." I croaked, in the beginning stages of dehydration.

"Cool deal. Now get busy--or we'll all be up on blasphemy charges in a
week."

TEN REASONS TO GIVE THE INTERGALACTIC HOUSE OF FRUITCAKES MONEY.

1)Surprise may send Jeffe into deep coma, thus fending off eventual collapse
of western civilization.

2)A fine way of getting back at heretical cults run by people you're ticked
at.

3)Jeffe has worked out this scam so you can deduct the money as a charitable
donation.

4)If you need it later, you can always say it was a loan.

5)You will automatically be entered in the IGHF Super Sweepstakes, with
piles of delightful prizes, including the Grand First Prize, a week's
vacation in scenic Williamstown, MA!! (Second Prize is two week's vacation).

6)What if Jeffe's friend Tim was serious about your kneecaps?

7)You'll never wonder whether they're squandering your money or not.

8)The FBI probably won't care.

9)Frankly, their shameless begging is disgusting.  Maybe now they'll shut up
and go away.

10)Oh, yeah, like you're REALLY going to be doing anything with those
pennies anyway.

As otis may have mentioned to you, I have been rather ill this past week,
and I was extremely fortunate to have my boredom staved off by some
concerned friends (a new experience, to be sure), some Tom Sharpe, some P.D.
James, and some curious letters from home.  As I know you have little
interest in my decadent homelife (yes, the baseball DID get the message
across) I'll spare you that.  However, there was also an article my mother
had clipped from the local daily, the Lawrence Eagle Tribune.  It consisted
largely of an interview, reprinted from some unknown source, with the
eminent ecolofigist, Dr. Julius Radbanger, and concerned his plan to deal
with the oil spill in the Gulf.

INTERVIEWER:
   So, Dr. Radbanger, your work in the study of the American aardvark
problem is well known, by why do you wish to deploy them to Persian Gulf.

DR. RADBANGER:
   Well, Dude, it's like this.  Aardvarks can and will suck up anything,
and they totally thrive in desert conditions.

INTERVIEWER:
   Dr. Radbanger, surely you are aware that aardvarks will only suck up
ants and other small insects through their remarkable, I  believe in fact
you once described them at a world wildlife conference as "bitchin!", noses.
Even setting aside the extreme toxicity and indigestibility of unprocessed
heavy crude oil, surely bacteria would be more efficient, given their higher
rates of reproduction?

DR. RADBANGER:
   Oh, man, you don't know anything about aardvarks.  Reproduction is
exactly where my idea really begins to look cool.  See,  aardvarks begin to
mate about a week before birth,

INTERVIEWER:
   They mate in the womb?????

DR. RADBANGER:
   Well, it's mostly practice.  Actual reproduction usually doesn't begin
until about four or five minutes after birth

INTERVIEWER:
   Four or five minutes?

DR. RADBANGER:
   Uh, huh, and then it continues more or less continually until 3 weeks
after it's dead.

INTERVIEWER:
   They mate after death?  How can they possibly mate three weeks after
they have died??

DR. RADBANGER:
   Force of habit, dude.  Aardvarks a driven by habits: sexual habits,
eating habits, drug habits, you should see what nun's habits do to them,
man, wow! (laughs)

INTERVIEWER:
   I see. Is this preposterous theory why you're famous?

DR. RADBANGER:
   Yeah, pretty much.  It's true, though.  I got videos, they're real
popular at parties.  See the dead aardvarks just do
(damn bbc technology!)                 go on doing whatever they
habitually did when they were alive; you know, going to the Pirates Cove,
sleeping through lectures, getting smashed at parties and having lots of
sex.  I guess the only reason they stop is that after about 3 weeks of this,
they just collapse and stop moving out of sheer boredom. Nothings as much
fun when you're dead, you dig?

INTERVIEWER:
   I still don't see how any of this helps with the oil.

DR. RADBANGER:
   Well, ok.  Since the aardvarks are bumpin away so much, they need a lot
of energy, and high calorie crude oil should be just the thing.  Their
numbers will skyrocket, and they'll suck up oil like crazy, and before you
know it, the desert will be clear of oil.  Don't say it! I know what you
wanna know: how do we control the aardvarks afterwards?  Well, Dude, with
the US army out there, you've got the best aardvark population control
systems in the world right there, you know?

INTERVIEWER:
   Actually, I just wanted to point out that your preposterous little idea
has the additional problem of the oil being out to sea, and not in the
desert.

DR. RADBANGER:
   Oh.  Perhaps we
              could teach them to surf.... [sounds of violent

Safety Tips for the Post-Nuclear Existence
1.  Never use an elevator in a building that has been hit by a nuclear bomb;
use the stairs.
2.  When you're flying through the air, remember to roll when you hit the
ground.
3.  If you're on fire, avoid gasoline and other flammable materials.
4.  Don't attempt communication with dead people; it will only lead to 
psychological problems.
5.  Food will be scarce; you will have to scavenge.  Learn to recognize
foods that will be available after the bomb:  mashed potatoes, shredded
wheat, tossed salad, ground beef, etc.
6.  Put your hand over your mouth when you sneeze; internal organs will be 
scarce in the post-nuclear age.
7.  Try to be neat; fall only in designated piles.
8.  Drive carefully in "Heavy Fallout" areas; people could be staggering 
illegally.
9.  Nutritionally, hundred dollar bills are equal to ones, but more sanitary
due to limited circulation.
10.  Accumulate mannequins now; spare parts will be in short supply on
D-Day.

  If you are tired of the regular topics in this
section, how about this one:

  WHO MURDERED BRUCE LEE?

1. Was it Bruce's Wing Chun teacher Yip Man,
   who had told Bruce not to teach it to "outsiders"?

2. Was it Bruce's (movie) director Lo Wei, with whom
   Bruce had arguments on the set of "Big Boss"?

3. Was it Bob Wall, with whom Bruce had arguments
   on the set of "Enter the Dragon"?

4. Was it the CIA, who did not want a third world
   hero to dominate the popular media at that time?

5. Was it David Carradine, who might have thought
   that Bruce was a hinderance in his own 
   "kung-fu" career? Think of where David Carradine
   would have been if there was no Bruce to begin with.

6. Was it Run Run Shaw, the HK producer  whom 
   Bruce rejected in favor of Golden Harvest productions?
