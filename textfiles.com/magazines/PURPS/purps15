INTRODUCTION
("The first secret of good religion management is getting other
people to do the creative work for you.  The second is lying
through your teeth." T. Howland)

     In recent issues this puiblication seems to be drifting
further and further away from being a publication somewhat
dedicated to the promotion of the OTISian faith.  Slowly, neeto
stuff like thw weird news section, which has little, at best, to
do with the Ancienty Sumerian God/dess o' life OTIS him/herself
(HAIL OTIS!), has been taking up more and more room, squeezing
OTIS, Rotus, Lotus, and, to a lessor degree, Spode (our four
great dieties) into the background.

     Well, brothers and sisters, no more.  This morning I woke up
to find my socks glued mysteriously to the ceeling, a foul stench
permenating my rose garden, my floor painted day glow green, all
of my clothes replaced with identical versions cut entirely from
paisley fabric, the mysterious words "YO! Get Back on Track!",
scrawled in glowing brown letters across my forehead, and a
player piano in the corner-- burned to ashes.

     Well, faithful followers, as you know, I don't own a piano. 
So, after checking carefully and discretely with friends to
determine that I wasn't all _THAT_ drunk last night, I determined
that OTIS was trying to tell me something.  So, this issue is
dedicated soley and with complete sincerity to OTIS, and the
OTISian faith.

Microwaved Hot Dog Lives to Wag Her Tail

TORONTO (Reuters) Kizi, the miniature schnauzer dog, is
recovering from being microwaved after an intruder popped her in
the oven.
   Kizi escaped with a limp and a burnt ear after the metal
buckle on her dog collar shorted the oven, her owner said.
   ``We think he set the timer for nine minutes.  She had a metal
buckle on her collar and that shorted the oven.  That saved her
life,'' said Kizi's owner, 13-year-old Chad Leis, from Kitchener
in Ontario, Canada.
  A 14-year-old boy has been charged with cruelty.

[Coincidence?  I think not!]

In one of his pleas for money, evangelist Oral Roberts urged his
followers to scribble the name of Jesus on the soles of their
shoes. "As you put your foot down, know by your faith you're
bruising the devil's head," his letter said. The
letter featured white space for contributors to outline their
shoes. Within a week of Roberts' letter being mailed, fellow
evangelist Billy Graham was  admitted to a Rochester, NY hospital
with a foot infection.

[Which Creator would that be, then?]

The Guardian [Manchester and London] - 12 February 1991

You may like this extract from a forthcoming book called, in a
self-explanatory sort of way, The Meaning Of Life.  The compilers
have asked a number of well-known persons to explain in their own
words what it is.  The meaning of life, I mean.  And why are we
here?  This is one of the responses: "We are not here to avoid
decisions but to make hard choices between good and evil by using
an ethical system not invented by man but by our Creator - a
framework of truth and moral guidance through which we can find
deliverance from despair ..." and so on.  That's the
view of that noted moral guide, Colonel Oliver North.
Stay tuned - next week we will discuss the meaning of the word
"hypocrisy."  -Spode

Messenger of the Gods

I was over at a friends house watching t.v. when a storm came
tumbling down out of the sky, meaning I'd be staying a bit longer
than I planned. Lacking nothing better to do and much to my
annoyance, they turned on the t.v. for recent war developments.
The endless drone of the newsman filled the air saying about the
same thing he'd said the day before, grumbling about war censors.
Suddenly, it was commercial time. I perked up a bit to see
exactly who had the guts to finance our blood bath entertainment
channel. It was only a local car dealer. Those commercials are
the worst, often looking like someone used a video tape camera
that only took pictures in pastels.

Then another commercial came on for a bowling alley. A commercial
for a bowling alley? Since when do when get those? I hadn't seen
one in years. This was getting weird. Then I noticed the
commercial was in black and white, and, well, they weren't
advertising anything. It looked a bit grainy too, like a old bad
movie. Some faint memory ticked the back of my brain. I'd seen
this "commercial" some time in the past. Then a man walked into
the scene smoking a pipe.

"Oh Crap!" I yelled leaping out of my chair.

"What?" asked on of my friends confused.

The man on the screen picked up a piece of poster board. A grin
crossed his face as he held it up to the camera. It said "X-Day
coming soon to theater near you."

"What the hell kind of commercial is that?" asked another friend.

"Hey wait! Wasn't that guy in a book you showed us once?" asked
another.

"Look at all the makeup. Makes him look like he's got a plastic
face--" said still another the voice trailing off. The picture on
the t.v. jumped violently, exploding into a cascade of stars,
comets and little golden apples.

I glanced at my friends for a second. They were all frozen like
bad special effects out of "Bewitched".

"Don't you dare turn this thing off!" scolded a golden haired
woman who now appeared on the screen, her eyes flashing like
distant thunderstorms. She knew me too well. "I've been looking
for someone to do a job for me and guess what? You're it! You've
been rather lax lately and I think you could use some penance. If
you don't do this job right you'll soon learn why they call me
the Mistress of Mayhem!"

"Um.. Now see here.." I began, trailing off cringing under a
divine gaze that washed over me like the entire contents of a
2000 gallon punch bowl.

"Look!" she said wagging her finger at me, sparking showering
across the carpet. "You've been a good for nothing slug for all
too long. It's time you did something in my name once again. Do
you know what a pain in the ass it is to intercept satellite
broadcasts now with this encryption crap? And to top that off
that yahoo up and intercepted my broadcast while I was breaking
in! So shut up and listen! I don't have long. I left the meter
running as it were."

"Ok," I mumbled trying to look humble. I knew none of my friends
were seeing any of this. She was so furious some of her sparks
had burned holes in the carpet. How was I going to explain that
one away?

"Here take this," she said, her hand reached out of the screen. I
stepped forward and took the envelop. It was bright, sensuous,
lustful, red. As I grabbed it I accidentally touched her hand and
the world exploded. An ocean of divine force washed over my
system. My head filled with white light.
*****

I came to moment later on the floor, carpet full of burn marks.
My friends clustered around me. The air smelled of ozone, temple
incense and a strange unidentifiable pipe tobacco smell. Or was
it just the burnt carpet?

"You okay?" asked one friend, crouching over me looking worried.

"What happened?" ask another offering me a glass of water. I
struggled to sit up.

"How'd the carpet get burned?" asked the guy who owned the
apartment, sounding worried.

"Where's the envelop?" I asked suddenly remember what had just
happened.

"You mean this one," said another.  He was over by the dinning
room table with a butter knife. He was going to open the letter.
Something about it was attracting him. There as madness in his
eyes.

"Don't do that!" I shouted catapulting to my feet and blundering
across the room to snatch the red envelop from his trembling
hands.

"Hey give that back!" he said menacing me with the butter knife.

"Look it's mine. You can't have it. It's dangerous," I stuffed
the envelop into a pocket. I could smell the perfume coming off
of it. It made me dizzy.

My friends bombarded me with more questions but I brushed them
of. I rushed out the door into the storm cursing to myself,
wondering what I had gotten myself into. I'd blacked out back
there and now I didn't know what I was supposed to do with that
damn red reeking envelope. I could guess I suppose. It was pretty
obvious.

Soaking wet, I climbed into to car and started the engine. I
flipped the radio on, but thought better of it. I shook the water
out of my hair and pulled out the envelop trying not to get it
wet. My car was filled with that divine smell. I quickly rolled
down the window knowing I'd be overpowered quickly if I didn't.
She's really gone over board on this one.

As I suspected, the words "OTIS" appeared on the envelop in
golden letters. Little hearts and apples  danced around the name.
Oh boy was I in for it.

I stuffed the letter in my pocket and drove home. The ran blasted
through the windows soaking everything. I didn't care. I needed
at clear head. I had to think. How as I going to pull this one
off without getting killed or worse?

The radio flipped on by itself. Out of the corner of my eye a
silver shape glided across the heavens. I tried to look at it but
it was gone, disappearing behind huge thunderhead that poured
down lightening and rain.

A hokey ad blared out of my speakers with supernatural clarity as
if they salesman was sitting next to me on the seat reading his
copy instead of doing it into a microphone somewhere else.

"When it absolutely positively has to be there yesterday.." said
the voice pausing a moment to suck on a pipe..."try Dobb's speedy
delivery"

Oh no! Not again. I recognized that voice. I tried to turn off
the radio but the knob was stuck like someone had superglued it
there. Blue sparks shot of the speakers. The commercial was over
replaced by a radio talk show.

"And you see this picture. See this is the dark side of the moon.
That's the side we can't see from earth ya know. The moon doesn't
spin like the earth. Space aliens saw to that 1,000's of years
ago. They had help from the Aztecs doing it though. They aren't
all powerful..."

I drove through storm with one hand. The other fished up a tire
iron I kept under the seat for emergencies. I was going to bash
the radio in. It seemed like the only way to shut it off. I
brought my arm back to bash it to bits as another voice asked,
"Yes but what does this have to do with X-day"

I tossed the iron onto the floor. It was useless. Something told
me I'd have to destroy my entire car to shut off the voices. Home
wasn't that far away.

"Well you see, when X-day comes rolling down the Xists are going
to be using the moon as a kind of parking  lot. You know how at 
Disney World you park in this vast lot and then get shuttled in.
Well that's how X-day well be. The Atlantians thousands of years
ago dug tunnels all under South America where they stored the
shuttle craft for X-day. After the Atlantians, the Aztecs and
Mayans maintained the craft. All those Codexes the Spaniards
burned were really saucer maintenance manuals. Luckily there were
a few copies written on golden plates the Spaniards didn't find,
so the survives of the purge were able to maintain them to this
day. In fact I have a sample of one here. Now keep in mind it's
not the real thing. This one is made out of cardboard and
aluminum foil, but it gives you a good idea what it looks like."

"How come these here manuals are written in english?" asked the
other voice.

"Oh well those Xists were smart. They knew that in the final days
the Subgenius would rise up in Dallas and they figured it would
be easier if they made the manuals for them. If you'll look
closely you'll see many of the words are from the Texas dialect."

Thank goodness I was home. I parked me car and raced to my door,
fumbling with the key as the rain poured down off me. There was a
note tacked to my door. The hand writing was the same as on the
red envelope.

"Oh my devoted worshipper, please see to it my epistle is
delivered by Valentines day...or else." Gold on red again.

Valentines day! Why that was only a couple days away. This was
getting serious!! The phone was ringing off the hook when I
opened my door. I figured it was my friends checking up on me. My
bizarre departure probably unsettled them. I picked it up. "Hey
there! Can I interest you in some aluminum siding!" said the
salesman voice form the radio at the other end.

"Sure," I said for some reason. I liked the voice. I trusted the
guy.

"Well could I set up an appointment with you? Bring buy some
samples and a free gift?"

I thought for a moment. When could I see the guy? I really needed
some aluminum siding on this concrete and steel bunker like
apartment I lived in. Wait! I was a renter what the hell did I
need siding for.

"Buzz off!" I yelled realizing I'd been conned slamming down the
phone. 

It rang again. I yanked the cord out of the wall. I was having
none of that.
I had to sit down and think this out. I looked around the room. A
calendar stared at me from across the wall. I didn't have much
longer. How would I find Otis. And how the hell was I supposed to
deliver this envelope without getting stomped by Arani. Or Brow.
Or anyone for that matter. And why was all this stuff happening
to me? I guess they wanted the envelop as badly as she wanted me
to deliver it. But why?

Idle speculation would do me no good. I opened the blinds on the
window looking out on to the ocean so I could see the storm and
kicked in the stereo, turning up Throbbing Gristle until it
almost drowned out the booming thunder. I rummaged around
collecting all my Otisian information the Pope had sent and sat
down with my pendulums and crayons hoping I could find a clue.

An hours passed. I threw White Light White Heat on the stereo.
Then it died as the power went out. I tried to see what I was
doing with the help of the lightning flashes but it just didn't
work. Luckily the batteries in my night vision goggles were still
good.

Who is the prune charcters and why it is *THEY* got the original and I

out in the first place? Hmmm????

You do realize this no does *NOT* imply that slack is infinite. It

Is this pig a truffle pig? This could make a big different. Also the 
wearing of jeans during the time of the experiment could also 
influence the out come. Take bulls for example who are annoyed by the 
color red.  Also note the mud. Would you eat cheese covered with mud. 
Maybe if you'd sat Binky down to the family dinner table things might 
have gone better.

Clearly Superman has more taste than the average american. He's

Do they spin counter clock wise in the northern hemisphere and clock

with anything anyways

Actually I believer this is a man named Thacker who runs Thacker

No questions asked.

I should ask some of my friends who work inthe old folks home. Still 
wasn't there a recent article on this sort of thing.. Something about 
these young women showing up to an old folks home just when their 
social secruity checks came in and offering services. As I recall the 
town was shocked.

Another possibly re dentist are the kind of people who get ignored at 
parties who everyone talks over. When the dentist fills you mouth full 
of arcane contraptions and straps on into a chair, he can have your 
undivided attention and know that he won't be interrupted. That is 
always why they talk about such stupid things.

>> Who invented the TV set anyway?
>Bertrand Russell, after having seen one individual TV, went
>about proving in a complicated way that that one TV necessarily
>comprised a TV set whose element was the TV itself.

I always thought it was madison avenue. Then again a careful reading of 
the Book of the Subgenius should tell you that YHVH-1 is probably 
responsible seeing as "Bob"'s first vision (or one of the first) came 
over a t.v. set he was experimenting on. Or posibly inventing. This 
really never was made clear.

>> What does it mean for something to have meaning?
>Philosophically speaking, `X' is meaningful if and only if it
>has orange stripes.

A profound statement. Try getting on the Ophra Whinfry show with that 
one.

>> Where is Jimmy Page today?
>It doesn't matter.  Today isn't really today.  See below.

Actually the asker of this question could easily have answering it 
themselves. Since they are asking where Jimmy Page is, clearly this 
J.P. must be somewhere else than where the asker is. However, a clever 
person might have JP right there with them and just be asking this 
question to confuse people.

>> Why are some people content?
>Because there are almost enough puppy dogs, nice houses, white
>picket fences, small cute children, and well-kept lawns to go
>around.

And I  suppose the ones who aren't are the ones who think there are way 
too many puppy dos, nice houses, white picket fiences, small cute 
children, and well-kept lawn to go around.

>> Why aren't there thousands of terrorist groups rampaging
>  through the streets?
>There are.  The terrorists are just really, really small.

Actually most people killed in traffic accident are terrorists on 
their way to terrorize. The media just tends to hush this up.

>> Is there such a thing as a moose herd?
>Yes, seven of them.  The rest are really herds of cattle in disguise.

I believe the cattle were part of an american stealth technology plan. 
Cattle disguised as herds of moose could infultrate into soviet air 
space and do various missions including the delivery of leathal 
payload undetected. 

>> What's so good about knowledge?
>I don't know.

Knowlege is the glue that holds the cells in your brains together.

>> Why is Hemingway so famous?
>Ernest Hemingway's entire literary career was in fact due to the
>unflagging efforts of a Mr. Donovan Sanders, of Pittsburg PA.
>That's all I'm allowed to say.  Ask the man yourself.

I think a post script should be added to this uestion..."and why 
aren't I famous as well?"

>> Why do women want men who hate them?
>Men who hate women are cuter.

This could also be some sort of sour grapes kinda deal. 

>> Why do rich people always get their way?
>Because that's the way our ancestors decided it should be.  Myself,
>I suggest that we scrap a money-based society and proceed to develop
>a sort of economics of emotions.  That way, happy people would
>always get their way.  Neurotic people would always get both of
>their ways.

Rich people always get their way becuase in childhood they had enough 
money to learn how to throw tantrums correctly.

>> What's so fantastic about MC Hammer?
>It's sort of an advertising thing -- really it's just his name people
>like.  His career, and the disastrously brief careers of MC Saw, MC
>Screwdriver, the Pliers, and the funk group Duct Tape Rhythm Section,
>were all orchestrated by the Seattle law firm of Strongman and Foop.
>Looks like they finally did something right.

Once again a post script is necessary.. "and what can I do to become 
like him?"

>> Who created God?
>OTIS.

Actually it was B. Otis. He needed to give Otis some competition. This 
is well documented in the the Doc Savage series. In the movie in the 
opening credits this fact is spelled out in code.

Also keep in mind that many christians aren't all that bright. It's 
easier to spell God than it is Otis.

>> Why is the number 3112 so ugly?
>It's the result of inbreeding -- 3112 is the son of 3558 and 3698.
>Don't let this happen to you.

3+1+1+2=7 the number of God. Does that answer your question?

>> What is the ugliest number anyway?
>1.

This is why Weishaupt appears on the front of a $1 bill

>> Why do people think that they are better than anyone else?
>Well, there's got to be some inborn mentality, hasn't there?  And
>what would it be like if we all thought we were worse than anyone
>else?  What would it be like if we all thought that we should
>grow up to be like Don Knotts?  Count your blessings.

Growing up Don Knotts might not be all that bad. After all he got to 
talk to Otis the Drunk on the Andy Griffith Show.

>> Why is there life after sex?
>For more sex, and eating, and smoking cigarettes.

Actaully we were given life after sex so we'd have plenty of time to 
contribute money to the IGHF at their POB

>> Who invented the buddy system anyway?
>Someone who was very lonely.

I always thought it was the boy scouts myself. All those merit badges 
they were make them top heavy. If one tips over and can't get back up 
the other one can go find help.

>> What day is it really?
>I've been pondering that question for a good long time.  A close
>watch of the subtle signs present in every day has led me to the
>conclusion that every "day", even those that appear to us to be
>distinctly different from the others, is in fact Tuesday.  It's
>Tuesday today, really.  So was yesterday.  Tomorrow will be
>Tuesday, as will the day after that.  Next Wednesday will be
>Tuesday.  Take a good look at some days, and see if you don't
>agree.  (Jimmy Page, by the way, once took a solemn vow to miss
>every Tuesday for the rest of his life.  We can probably conclude
>from this that he is in fact missing Tuesday, every day, and that
>the Jimmy Page we think we see occasionally is just a figment of
>our imaginations.  It is possible, though, that he has actually
>fulfilled his vow to miss every Tuesday for the rest of his life,
>and is at this point simply dead.)

Tuesdays are also the easier to make and the cheapest so the Time 
Dwarves leave them alone and steal the other days.

>> What ever happened to \
>Gosh, I don't know.  Looks like it's gone to me.

That's what happens when you forget to send money to Otis. Messy isn't 
it?

>> Do trees think?
>Yes.

But what do they think about?

>Brought to you by the Reverend Rob, Screaming Prophet of OTIS
>Triumphant and Kenyon's very own Minister O' Slack.  Peace.

Well, I have four slide rules, including one that I'm rather fond of. Take
the surface of a slide rule several few feet long, and wrap it round into a
spiral on a rod about one inch diameter. The other edge of the slide rule
becomes a smaller rod which fits inside it, and the cursor becomes an
encasing ring. The result is something looking like a small telescope, with
polished chrome ends, a black casing and the two highly accurate spiral
calculating surfaces which slide out. Accuracy is about an order of
magnitude over a conventional slide rule.

The thing is called the Otis King Calculator. These things were phenominally
                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
expensive back in the Slide Rule Era (1060's). I got mine about six years
ago for something less than two dollars. This was only the basic mul/div
model, unfortunately (we bought the last two in the shop, perhaps in the
country) - I'd have loved the trig model.

To this day, I still don't have an electronic calculator - I believe the
things rot the brain. I do most of my calculations on paper (including
hex conversions and so on). And I still remember how to do long division.
The Otis King tends to get paraded out in response to somebody asking for
a calculator.

On Friday, this bit of xeroxlore showed up in the teacher workroom of
the elementary school where I work.  It really got a big reaction from
the teachers especially coming as it has on the heels of a series of
seemingly arbitrary decrees from administration.  Several teachers
believed it (and were fuming mad) for the first few paragraphs.

RE:  RESTROOM USE POLICY

   In the past, employees were permitted to make trips to the
restrooms under informal guidelines.  EFFECTIVE AUGUST 27, 1990, a
Restroom Trip Policy will be established to provide a more consistent
method of accounting for each employee's restroom time and ensuring
equal treatment of all employees.

   Under the policy a "Restroom Trip Bank" will be established for
each employee.  The first day of each month, employees will be given
twenty (20) Restroom Trip Credits.  These credits may be accumulated.

   Within two weeks, the entrance doors to all restrooms are being
equipped with personnel identification stations and computer-linked
voice print recognition devices.  Before the end of August, each
employee must provide two copies of voice prints (one normal and one
under stress) to the Middle School Office.  The voice print
recognition stations will be operational but not restrictive for the
month of September.  Employees should acquaint themselves with the
stations during that period.

   If the employee's Restroom Trip Bank balance reaches zero, the
doors to the restroom will not unlock for that employee's voice until
the first of the next month.  In addition, all restroom stalls are
being equipped with timed paper roll retractors.  If the stall is
occupied for more than three minutes, an alarm will sound.  Thirty
seconds after the alarm sounds, the roll of paper will retract into
the wall, the toilet will flush, and the stall door will open.  If the
stall remains occupied, your picture will be taken.

   The picture will then be posted on the bulletin board.  Anyone's
picture showing up three times will immediately be terminated.  If you
have any questions about this policy, please see me.  I have received
advanced instructions.

[And NOW, for what we will loosely term your enjoyment, as we rummage for a
better word, in the tradition of all great conspiracy literatue, from the
Gemstone Files to the Protocols of Zion, we proudly bring you:
            <<<<<<<<<<<The Brown Bucket Papers>>>>>>>>>>

Complete and unbowlderzied, sheding a little light on the OTISian faith's
sister cult, the often notorious cult of the Brown Bucket...]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
[The Brown Bucket papers are long and fairly confusing.  Basically, they
consist of a long and fairly esoteric converstaion among several of the
greatest threats to the American way of lifde in this generation.
Originally, as the Papers suggest, I was privy to a good deal of this
discussion.  Unfortunately, all of my messages in response were deleted. 
Also missing is the input from Scott Proctor Simpson, Brother two Saints of
the OTISian Faith (Tiff, of the bloody shears and Simpson of Grammer), and
founder of the now imfamous, St. Noden's Seminary, an early rivial to the
OTISian faith (recently closed down for alleged child sacrifices).  His
notes somehow got lost in translation.  I smell B. Otis, too...

  The key players are (in order, I think of appearence):

  The grand Vizer of the Church of the Brown Bucket [Messages labled
HAMMRICK], co- founder of the faith along with myself about which you are
about to learn more.

  Malclypse 3, aka Mal or Mal3 [Messages labled BARKER], an small
independent businessman (SBI industries, one of the world's largest
contractors of Submarine Pens and surveilence equipment), Mal has been a
confirmed OTISian for a few years now which has in no way affected his
unwavering devotion to his first love, Eris, the Greek goddess of chaos.

  B. OTIS, Too, aka "Reid" [Messages Labled CARLBERG], Co-Owner of the now
defunct Sid 'n Sons (SNS) publishing house.  The house was firebombed by the
FPO (Fascist Pigs Against OTIS), presumaeably as revenge for something said
about their mothers, in late 1987.  It never recovered from the associated
financial losses.  Reid now spends most of his time dodging the authorities.
Ocassionally acts as a mouth piece for the anti-Otis... Is he here?  You
decide...

  St. Tiff of the Blood Shears [Messages Labled SIMPSONST], one of the most
recent Saints of the OTISian Faith, Tiff is the patron Saint of Casteration. 
She currently spends her time infiltrating the net, subverting it for the
greater glory of Otis.  She is a dedicated follower of whatever religion is
currently paying her the most, and you don't want to know her hobbies. 
Trust me.

  What the Brown Bucket Papers prove, ultiamtely, is four fold

  1.  These things aren't anywhere near as interseting transcribed as they
were when they were happening.
  2.  The Net has a SCARY capacity to create large amounts of dogma in
almost no time at all.
  3.  The Legendary Cult of the Brown Bucket is, in fact, real, and not just
an odd hoax dreamed up by the peopel who gave me a large brown Rock for my
birthday.
  4.  These people are far stranger than even I immagined and for saftey's
sake I think I'd better follow Weishaupt's advice and have them all put
away.

  I will place all my parenthetical comments in [brackets] and sign them PJ
The messages are in rough chronological order.

  It all started with the one below...., a response to the allegation that
Scott Simpson's sister had, in fact, casterated him...]

The insight has reached us concerning the castration of one Simpson, Scott
to our knowledge, the present Scott Simpson is actually a reincarnated 
founder of the Skoptsi sect, and is refusing to acknowledge his birthright
It has also come to us, via holy messangers, that it was originally 
called the Scott Sip sect, and we can easily see how this name got
translated as Skoptsi in this lifetime.

As for your questions concerning the Browness, here is only a bit of the 
awesome brown truth, as can be revealed to your slow, but exceedingly
pliable, minds . . . ahem, from the great BOOK: 'AND SO IT CAME TO PASS AS
THE TWO HOLY ONES WERE SEEKING KNOWLEDGE IN THE GREAT BERG OF LONDAN DURING
THE GLORIOUS REIGN OF HER MOST ROYAL PAININTHEASSNESS MARGY THE THATCHER,
THE HOLY ONES, TRAVELING WITH A GROUP OF NONTHINKERS, CAME UPON THE PHYSICAL
INCARNATION OF TRUTH -- THE BROWN BUCKET -- AND THEY FELL DOWN IN ADORATION
OF THIS GREAT FIND, FOR THEY WERE IN AWE AND A BIT NACKERED.  FORTHENCE THE
BUCKET DID REFRESH THEM AND RESTORE THEIR STRENGTH, VITALITY AND MOST MANLY
VIRILITY. WHEN THEY LOOKED UPON THE GREAT BROWNESS THEY WERE REQUIRED TO
AVERT THEIR EYES UNTIL THEY COULD COPE WITH THE BROWN LIGHT IT WAS EMITTING
. . .

his royal highbrowness has indicated to me his scribe that this is more then
enough information to be released to the pliable minds of the populace, 
neverthelss be prepared to think upon these most holy things and be
ready to embrace the true faith of browness, the fastest growing
religion this side of the Rockys.
                                   In humble and discreet Browness
                                         for his most holy G.V.

Hmm by all means send the B.B. story along. Sounds like fun. Damn I"m 
getting a ton of mail from you. Must have been busy all weekend. Well 
I"m waiting to print out 500 letters to hunt for subjects so this is 
sort of fun to have the stuff around to kill time.

Hmm gota note from the Rev too.

I checked my monetary status and things look good. I think I can 
afford a next sooner or later. Also once agian we may be getting on 
here becuase the New NOvell stuff we are suposed to get (a $12,000) 
value is supposed to spead Unix and Tcp/IP.. Hmm maybe I can get that 
mail server and ftp site and archive step up after all. Have it 
changed UUCP wise so I can get mail on my machine at home. This could 
be a riot.

Hmm just yell when you want another installment of my story. Or if you 
need more for Purps. I have almost another 5 pages done.

talking  about "Cities of Red Night" by Burroughs. Which were supposed 
to have taken place in the Gobi...

Well see there was this ancient civilation that destroyed itself in 
the Gobi. Bunch of cities. Burroughs writes about in it the book. I 
think it was Gyson who told him about it originally.

Does Carcosa and Lake Hali have something to do with the Gobi as well?

As I recall in one of our paper letters we discussed how Otis was indeed
going to be or already was a household word.

I mean look at the Otis Elevator company? It's everywhere. Go to the 
atlanta hilton and there it is. Thousands of people go there for 
conventions every year and they see the words "OTIS" staring at them 
from the steel name plates in the floor and stuff. (Hmm remind me to 
tell you some day about how the High School Science Teachers got 
banned from a bar there in Atlanta.)

Or take Otis the Drunk from the Andy Griffith show. That loveable  
inebriated fellow managed to work his way into everyones hearts almost 
as much as dear old Aunt B. (IN fact he got himself into another 
religion... the Church of the Epeleptic Screaming Jesus who's god head 
consists of Elvis, Foghorn Leghorn and Otis the drunk.)

Hmm sounds like a good idea to me. I'm sure Saint Tif and several 
others can tell you the bang up job I've been doing  converting the

who's a pretty cool characters if I do say so myself.

Yes who is this woman. You do realize I had to pass the did bit of 
information onto to certain higher sources. They were not amused.  NOt 
amused one bit. I'd stay away from bowling alleys and radios for a 
while if I were you.

SO what was Otis drinking? ANd which side of the Tigres was this one 
anyways?

Earlobes? how many ears does she have? And did she park here beast 
outside (refer to Revelations) Earlobes! Caressing! Hmm sounds like 
some sort of mystical code. Pictures use such signs on the baseball 
diamond. Was he making a pitch?

can use lizards are powerful allies. I forget the exact process. It's

Subj:  Meditations on the brown bucket

What is the brown bucket? Is it meerly a bucket? A container? an 
object? what is it made out of? 

Recalling other readings the bucket could be similar to the Holy 
Grail. Do people go on a quest for it? Must you have pure heart to 
find it? Are there Knights of the Bucket who guard the Bucket in the 
bucket castle?

Cups.. Tarot.. is the bucket a cup? A fertility sign?

The caldron of Bran(or is it another Celtic god. A bit rusty here). 
Used to bring back to life dead heroes, and feed people. Brew up 
potions of intelligence. 

Did achillies mother dip her son in the brown bucket? Could the brown 
bucket be symbolic of the river Styx?

Why is color so important to. As we see from Carlberg's quoting of the 
color scale... Maybe we have to worship the brown bucket because us 
meer mortals cannot deal with a bucket of any purer form.

What about a pail? 

Hmm jack and jill when up the hill to fetch a pail of water.
Hmm  O and P when up the hill to fetch a pail of ????

Sometimes truth is found in strange places.

There's also that song about a 'hole in the bucket'  where this man 
keeps making excuses why not to fix the bucket. Sounds like slack if 
you ask me. Are there ties to the frop heads and the brown bucketeers?

Again I ask, why is a bucket shaped like a fez?

There's also a song called 'the old oak bucket'. Burroughs talks of a 
club or gathering where people stand around signing htis song then 
drink from the water in it which was spiked with an amazon plant that 
caused you're teeth to fall out.

Buckets can be made out of slats... slats... slack.. hmmm....

Enough already.

i don't know... i've always wondered what it would be like to undermine
simpson's power on the net.  as for OTISian, you might be slightly amused
to find out that there ARE people out on the net that think that OTISian is
a real old religion that is resurfacing... people unsatisfied with their
established christian views looking for a neato pagan religion have been
converted by me... so far i've only converted 30 people, but its a start.
in the spirit of OTIS i have been telling people things left and right
(all sworn by the word of spode of course)... it's quite amusing...  i write
back and forth to them, and each of those 30 have converted 3 of their
friends calling to mind that oh-so-overplayed guthrie song... just one and
they think you're crazy and they don't give you any account, 2 and they
think you're lesbi-gay, but three, and you've started a movement!
lately though, that has not been foremost on my mind... what i've really
been interested in is all the ways i could do away with my parents... i
was thinking that i could drug them, or give my mom weight gaining stuff,
and have her gain massive amounts of weight, and then she would sit on my
father... nononono, that wasn't it... well anyways, have you ever talked
to my mother? she just whines on and on... my brother and i just put down
the phone until the noise stops... did you know that 'a current affair'
isnt' done by actors and actresses? these are REAL people that are on this
show... i know, my best friend is going to be interviewed for it and they
want me to be interviewed too... would it be the OTISian thing to do? i
could always rant and rave about how OTIS wanted her to do it...
that reminds me... i ran into someone the other day who knew something about
the ways of the subgenii... the only problem was that he thought slack was
smack and wrote me off as a druggie... i don't think you should write
druggies off, sometimes they have real things to say... besides, i think its
kinda neat to believe that you can fly, life can get so boring sometimes

Who is Mal?  *evil echoing villianous laugh*  

That's a very good questions. We're not sure ourselves, but he seems 
to have an inside line a few things people aren't supposed to have. 
These damned satellite photos of embarrassing things keep coming 
across our desk. 

These phone bills that say "20,000 Legues Under the Sea" as the return 
address are along an egnima.

And all this bible stuff what if it comes true.

Is the beast a great seven headed yak with seven horns and  seven 
crows? Why do the crowns look like burger king crowns?

Rest assured marrage prosals to Otis may be a VERY BAD THING. We'll le 
someone else tell you about that, or pay attention to your dreams. 
Like we said before. Don't go neat the radio unless you have the 
courage to.

Yak fur.. fashion statement? A possible good idea. Now we have a way 
of recycling yaks after we've used them up yak tossing. (Then again 
yak tossing could be a pun. Ponders TO YAK and TOSSING.)

By the way, even the smallest crazy christian(tm) crap operation rakes 
in as much as the IGHF... Let's see some budgetary figures for the

didnt they?  Like I said a lot of scientists are involved in the 
Occult society that wants to keep it's secretrs from the masses.

Point two... have you ever tried to get a close look at a rainbow? Hmm 
i'ts always miles away. How can you see much detail at taht distance. 
The borwn spectrum is just hard to see. If you could get close to 
them...and hense find the pot of gold at the end, you'd know the 
truth.

There's a movie with Fred Estaire as this lepricon (I think or is it 
some other thin type old actor) where they find the pot of gold at th 
end of course their rainbow was just a fake mock up. The story has it 
they were were going to use a real rainbow with brown in it to 
illuminate the masses, but THEY stepped in.

[Important side note: Our sources would have it that the cold fusion 
was supressed by none other than the Detriot Illuminati that wretched 
gang of thugs who refuse to die and use cheap knock offs of real 
technology.]

Of course THEY suppressed it.

Unless they catch up with you. You go talking about the 'true brown' 
and you'll wake up with a wavy dagger and a note on the pillow next to

Okay so say the brown bucket exists. What do we get from being part of  
this brown bucket business? And how much does it cost? I mean the 
Otisians have all those heavy dues and have to have Brow over for 
dinner once a year.

I mean the 'ultimate in browness' just well.. sounds too much like 'oh 
you'll end up in heaven'. Us heathen types want it right now if not 
sooner.  Can we win the lottery with browness? Can we destroy our 
enemies?  (It's amazing what a prank phone call to Brow can 
accomplish).

And most of all who is the Pythia. She sounds like hot stuff, if old 
Otis would fall for her. Then again he is pretty ancient.. Never know 
might be slipping a bit.. though gaining more wisdom (got to cover 
myself there.)

What type of leaves were in the brown bucket? And why only two? Are 
there more now?

What about the Rock too?

We still have not resolved the Fez issue.

p.s. keep in mind we have a secruity leak to the Frop-heads.

Oh and Otis isn't "in the know" aye? How come I don't have a cold 
fusion toaster hmmm? Why must I constantly pour endless amounts of 
florocarbons into my good for nothing auto? Hmm?? My thinks maybe the 
reason Otis has a fusion powered sleigh is because P. gave it to him 
as a bribe of some sort. Looking back thru the literature one sees no 
mention of this sleigh business before this apperance of the ear lobe 
caressing P.

I suggest you don't let the mighty Brow hear you address him in this

Hey wait! I though confusion was a good thing. It is in *HER* book and 
she's definitely not worth messing with. Even a cold fusion power 
sleight can't say you from *HER*.

Secret whereabouts? Hmm whats with the press releases then? HMmm? Do 
you know what kind of signature a sleight gives off. Easily detectable 
from orbit, not to mention P herself showing up on the orgon 
detectors.

If one may be so bold. How does one contact her? I mean how do you get 
lottery numbers out of her? Does one rub ones ears? Or does one simply 
summon up Otis and she'll follow?

Does she do dreams? I had a dream the other night that I was at this 
huge party and someone tried to frame me and my friends for stealing 
this wallet full of money. I knew the only way to keep from being 
framed was to go defeat all these midgets who were going to attack the 
party. I guess the idea was people would be so happy with us killing 
off the midgets they'd forgive us for the money even though we didn't 
do it.

So we went across the street and  into this house and down into the 
basement where all the midgets where who immediately began to attack 
us with  spears and meat cleavers.  All we had were belaying pins.

It was a  horrible bloody battle but we eventually one after smashing 
the midgets to bits or chopping them up with some axes we found.

Does Pythia know what this means?

One would hope so. The dogma has barely begun to manifest itself. 
Besides it will make a great issue of Purps

Brown cash? I've heard cold hard cash, but not cold brown cash. Hmmm.
Is cash a symbol of brown because of it's browness? Did these supposed 
Great Brown Ones give cash to mankind in order that they would have a 
constant reminder of browness?

Or was it an addictive Icon put out by the Gnomes of Zurich to  
controll us. An addiction that can buy us other addictions and more 
controls over us

Isn't cash supposed to be a BAD THING? How does this reflect on this 
B.B. business?

We all know the IGHF is always asking for cash because they want to 
rid us of this monkey on our back. Otis revealed to them how to 
properly dispose of this evil.

As I recall wasn't the emeral city emeral colored because everyone 
wore emeral colored glasses? 

This looking around the world and seeing brown vaguely reminds me of 
the Principia where *SHE* speaks of looking around an seeing all the 
chaos *SHE* has given us. We haven't been cribbing dogma have we?
