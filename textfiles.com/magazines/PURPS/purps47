[Yes he's back and better than ever. More Ponders to Follow]

From: Pope Jephe <jstevens@world.std.com>
Subject: Papal Ponderings #6

Papal Ponderings #6: Pope Jepheee I of the IGHF, 955 Mass. Ave,Suite 209,
Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.

This week, a key secret of the universe revealed, plus: how to get out those
annoying coffee stains.

Sometime in July of 1989 I saw a lynx.  It was a fair sized lynx (i.e.
about twice the size of your average tabby), with tan coloring and the
obligatory black tipped ears, and it watched me for several seconds, before
becoming disinterested.  Nothing is all that surprising in any of this,
except for the location of the lynx.  It was sitting passively on the porch
of the Williams College Faculty House, on the corner of Park and Main
streets in Williamstown, MA.

Now, as you all know, there really aren't supposed to be any lynx in
Massachusetts, and the nearest zoo to Williamstown that might contain one
is, to my knowledge, near Boston, 240 miles to the east.  So unlike the
occasional moose that has been known to roam up and down the streets of
Williamstown in the wee hours of the morning, the lynx, rather out of place, caught a great deal of attention, everything from a team of experts to
a photo on the front page of the Williamstown Advocate (thus achieving in
three hours what took the Intergalactic House of Fruitcakes three years).

A few nights ago I hotfooted it down to the Smithsonian Museum of Natural
History to arrive (late) at a lecture on cryptozoology being given by the
illustrious Benard Heuvelmans. Technically, Heuvelmans isn't interested in
my lynx. Cryptozoology is a science devoted (mostly) to the study  of
mythological, legendary, or supposedly extinct creatures, and my lynx was
none of these.  However, cryptozoology has been known to occasionally poke
its curious nose into out of place animals as well (pumas in Florida and
New England being prime examples), and Heuvelmans was more than happy to
give me an explanation for the appearance of a lynx in north-western
Massachusetts; many animal species are more wide-spread than we think they
are.

Actually the answer is a little more complex than that.  It has to do with
the very nature of the universe.  I promised a secret of the universe in
the title of this piece, and here it is: the universe has a nasty tendency
to bend to human whims.  This can be proven with a simple experiment.  Pick
a number, any number. Try, as best you can, to pick a number which has no
special meaning for you.  Keep it simple or write it down so you can
remember it. Decide, in your mind, that this is a special number for you.
Saying this out loud is usually effective.  Now, over the next week, keep
your eyes open for any occurrences of your number.  The Pope will make a
small wager with you: if the number you chose is between one and 999, you
will see it many, many times (not surprising) and probably in a fairly
significant context for most of them (slightly more surprising).  If it's
higher than 999, you may not see it quite as much, or quite as
significantly (that can be changed: expand the duration of the experiment
to a month and watch the results).  The Pope's promise to you is this: if
you don't see the number at all, he promises not to send you even one of
the countless $10,000 gold bricks he has embezzled from the House treasury
over the past few years.  If that sounds too good to be true, read the
preceding sentence again, more carefully this time.

After the week is up, you will be so tired of seeing your number that you
will want to call the Pope up and bitch at him personally (adding something
in about his recent habit of referring to himself in the third person
singular, no doubt).  Fortunately, you don't have my phone number.  Not only
will you have seen the number you chose, you will have seen it in
extraordinary circumstances.  You may find that all the numbers in your
address total it when added, or see an article in a magazine written by
someone who shares your name starting on a page equal to it.  It may appear
on road signs or in news reports, or over and over again in a book you're
reading.  Whatever the case, you will be plagued by it.

So what, exactly, is going on?  The skeptics among you will say nothing
unusual; the number has always been around, but now you are conscious of it.
While that argument may explain away the number of occurrences of your
number, it does little for placement. It's easy enough to explain away
numerous occurrences, but why, pray tell, did you choose a number that is
the total of the digits of your zip code?  Why did you receive a number of
pieces of mail equal the number you chose during the week you chose it? Why
has a local graffiti artist chosen to spread it all over the walls of your
street, without explanation?  (Trust me, things similar to this will
happen.)  The answer is simple; the universe has responded to your urges.
The universe does this all the time.

I saw my lynx because in the great scheme of things, the cosmos sees no
particular reason why a lynx shouldn't be sitting on a brick wall hundreds
of miles from it appropriate habitat as anywhere else.  The universe has
very little respect for its own laws of physics and none at all for laws of
common sense.

---ooops... the rest of this got clipped.  I'll send it shortly--

1992 Doublespeak Awards
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From the November 20th issue of the Champaign-Urbana "News- Gazette."
(summation of article)

Doublespeak Awards Find Fertile Ground in Politics


(Champaign-Urbana, November 20, 1992) -- Doublespeak has just about driven
William Lutz to the brink of -- "mental activity at the margins."

That euphemism was just one gem discovered by the Rutgers University
English professor for the 1992 Doublespeak Awards, announced today in
Urbana by the National Council of Teachers of English.

The annual awards -- intended to call attention to language that is
"grossly deceptive, evasive and euphemistic" -- were bestowed during the
council's convention in Louisville, Kentucky.

Among the nominees:

*** Instead of being laid off, workers are "involuntarily terminated" as
companies "reposition," "reshape," "realign" and "reduce duplication"
through a "release of resources," "permanent downsizing" or "payroll
adjustment."

*** Along with other newfound freedoms, the people of Moscow can now visit
"intimacy salons" -- sex shops, as they are known in other countries.

*** U.S. soldiers should pay close attention to the Army's warning that
exposure to nerve gas may cause "immediate permanent incapacitation" --
that is, death.

*** Students who stand still are now in a state of "spatial anchoring."

*** Removing books from the library isn't censorship, just a case of
"weeding" books.

*** Colleges don't drop failing students, they "expedite their progress
toward alternate life pursuits."

*** Electric fans are now "high-velocity, multipurpose air circulators."

*** Radio and television commercials are now referred to as "value
minutes."

*** A U.S. Department of Energy nuclear fuel dump is a "monitored
retrievable storage site."

*** The Environmental Protection Agency now refers to acid rain as "wet
deposition."

*** Politicians in Canada engage in "reality augmentation" but would never
say that they'd lied.


And the winners are:

3rd place -- All the politicians who put the phrase "family values" at the
center of the 1992 political campaign. An ambiguous and vague phrase, it
"exploited intense feelings aroused by the idea of the family to celebrate
their [i.e. politicos] own idea of what constitutes the best domestic
arrangement."

2nd place -- The Republican and Democratic parties for "claiming they are
for reforming the way political campaigns are financed, even while they
continue to seek and accept large contributions from special-interest
groups, corporations, and wealthy individuals."

1st place -- President Bush for various novel uses of language, including
calling for "less proliferation of all different kinds of weapons" as the
Department of Defense reversed a 25-year policy and began supporting arms
trade shows around the world.

Finally, the 1992 George Orwell Award for Distinguished Contribution to
Honesty and Clarity in Public Language went to Donald Barlett and James
Steele, authors of "America: What Went Wrong." The authors received the
award for cutting through "the political and economic doublespeak used to
justify the economic policy of the 1980s" to reveal "who is and isn't
paying the price in the '90s."

Subject: Evil villages dispelled!!
 
_South China Morning Post_ - 22 November 1992
 
_Devils expelled as villages clean up their act"
 
        A government agency has succeeded in wiping Ng Kwai Shan off the
Hongkong map, but nearby villagers don't mind at all.
        It's name, which translates to "Five Devils Hill" in Cantonese,
is to be changed to make it less aggravating to fung shui adherents.
But that's nothing compared to some village names in Hongkong, which
make even the most-travelled postman blush.
        The hill, known simply as Black Hill in English, has fallen foul
of a clean-up campaign by the Geographical Place Names Board, which is
determined to revamp the map, wiping away names that either bring bad
luck or have definite category III ratings [equivalent to R and X ratings
in the USA -ed.].
        Ng Kwai Shan, near Junk Bay, has had its middle Chinese
character changed to bring about better fung shui.  From "Five Devils
Hill" it now sounds like "Five Wealthy Hill".
        And while native English speakers may never know what all the
fuss is about, when read aloud, other place names are certainly not
lost on Cantonese ears.  Take for example Fan Kwai Chau and Ham Lun
Kok - or, if you prefer, "Foreign Devil's Sex Organ" and "Oral Sex
Corner".
        Not surprisingly, the bureaucrats have renamed Fan Kwai Chau
as Pyramid Rock, while Ham Lun Kok will now be known as Yau Lung
Kok, or "Swimming Dragon Cape".
        The announcement of these new names suggests the Government
has either lost its sense of humour or is campaigning against
spiritual contamination.
        The Place Names Board's task is daunting.  The Chinese
University so disliked the KCR stop being called Ma Liu Shui,
or "horse's urine", it decided to change it to Tai Hok (University)
some years ago.
        Scanning through a Hongkong map, it is not uncommon to
find places with names such as Fong Pin Sho ("toilet place"),
Ngau Shi Wu ("cow dung lake"), and Kau Shi Wai ("dog excrement
farm").  And these are just the clean ones.

[This one's original; it's a parody]
 
[Note for non-US readers: Joe Bob Briggs is the nom de plume of a Texas
newspaper columnist who only reviews drive-in movies.  His columns are
known for stereotypical "redneck" style, and he rates movies on a sliding
scale of breasts, blood, and rolling extremities.  He's also a big fan of
kung fu (or, as he calls it "chopsocky".......]
 
 
        _Demon Seed_ Ain't Got Nothing on These Boys
 
 
I've never trusted computers; my bank makes too many mistakes with theirs.
Anyway, I found myself in Lexington, Kentucky awhile back (those dadburned
fools turned the Kentucky Theatre into an indoor pile of bullstuff; it used
to be the only indoor place worth a trip), so I dropped in on a guy who'd
sent me a couple of letters recently.
 
Well, my knowledge of computers comes from _Demon Seed_, so I was expectin'
eerie red lights and strange things sticking out from cabinets with lots of
beeps and whistles.  I wasn't disappointed with the Engineering Computing
Center; they had blinkin' lights and beeps to spare.  They *said* that
nobody'd been impregnated by their computers, but the darn things just sat
there and gave off a self-satisfied hum.  The guys there started telling me
about "walking disk drives" and "zombie processes", and I said to myself
"Joe Bob, these guys are working in a digital Drive-In."
 
These computers have it down pat.  You get to use commands like "kill" and
"chill", and they actually DO SOMETHING!  My pal typed in "kill 29382", and
somebody across the room screamed in pain!  This was all right by me, and
getting better all the time.  He typed in "chill" and everything started
slowing down, just like old Dr. Freeze in _Batman_ (the original, not the
Micheal Keaton bullstuff).  They chant in weird languages (one thing
sounded like "foo-bang-bar-percent-baz-at-uunet", and it did some voodoo
thing), and they have all these books that nobody but them can read.
They've got their heart in the right place, too; every command gives you a
dollar sign back, and that's the 'Merican way!
 
I started to think that some of these guys were Commies, though, 'cause
they were writing in chickenscratch that HAD to be a Secret Red Code.  I'm
talkin' stuff like "int (*(*(*x)[4])())[4];", and I was sure that the Reds
were gonna send an Eye-Cee-Bee-Em over soon as spit.  Well, they told me
that they were really telling the computers what to do, just like they did
in _Logan's Run_. That put my mind at ease, let me tell you.  Then one of
'em started saying "there is another system", and I thought I was smack dab
in the middle of _Colossus: The Forbin Project_; turned out it was their
idea of a joke.
 
Then they started talking about 'retiring' a computer; I was about to ask
what kinda pension a chunk of metal got.  They took some big thing called a
'degausser' and started waving it over everything.  Well, they told me that
it could erase any tapes or magnetic stuff, and I decided that I'm gonna
get one and head over to the Commie Video people and wipe 'em out.
 
Well, anyway, I was mucho impressed with the boys at UK, and I've got some
ideas for new movies; I'm gonna call To be with these.
 
Four quarts blood (the students tryin' to use these things).  One half
breast (they printed it out on the line printer thingy).  Three zombies,
one of which *refuses to die*.  Gratuitous JCL.  Gratuitous 3B2.  Punch
card fu.  Diskette
 
fu.  Degausser fu.  Drive-In Academy Award nomination for the user who said
 
"the computer ate my program, and it won't give it back!".
 
Three stars.  Joe Bob says check it out.

Subject: bedroom golf - the rules

From:   ALBANY::RB4572       "It's in those eyes... it's gonna happen anyway."
 
  RULES FOR BEDROOM GOLF
 
1.  Each player shall furnish his own equipment for play, normally one club
    and two balls.
2.  Play on a course must be approved by the owner of the hole.
3.  Unlike outdoor golf, the object is to get the club in the hole and keep
    the balls out of the hole.
4.  For most effective play, the club should have a firm shaft.  Course owners
    are permitted to check shaft stiffness before play begins.
5.  Course owners reserve the right to restrict club length to avoid damage
    to the hole.
6.  The object of the game is to take as many strokes as necessary until the
    course owner is satisfied that the play is complete.  Failure to do so may
    result in being denied permission to play the course again.
7.  It is considered bad form to begin playing the hole immediately upon
    arrival at the course.  The experienced player will normally take time to
    admire the entire course, with special attention to well formed bunkers.
8.  Players are cautioned not to mention other courses they have played or
    are currently playing to the owner of the course being played.  Upset
    course owners have been known to damage players equipment for this reason.
9.  Players are encouraged to bring proper rain gear for their own protection.
10. Players should assure themselves that their match has been scheduled,
    particularly when a new course is being played for the first time.
    Previous players have been known to become irritated if they discover
    someone else playing on what they consider to be a private course.
11. Players should not assume a course is in shape for play at all times.
    Some players may be embarrassed if they find the course to be
    temporarily under repair.  Players are advised to be extremely tactful in
    this situation.  More advanced players will find alternative means of play
    when this is the case.
12. The course owner is responsible for the manicuring and pruning any bush
    around the hole to allow for improved viewing of, alignment with, and
    approach to the hole.
13. Players are advised to obtain the course owners permission before
    attempting to play the back nine.
14. Slow play is encouraged.  However, players should be prepared to proceed
    at a quicker pace, at least temporarily, at the course owners request.
15. It is considered outstanding performance, time permitting, to play the
    same hole several times in one match.
16. The course owner will be the solo judge of who is the best player.

We received a new book in the library today called _Loony Laws... That You
Never Knew You Were Breaking_ by Robert Wayne Pelton.  The following are a
few of my favorites:
 
It is illegal for women in Saco, Missouri to wear hats that "might frighten
timid persons, children, or animals."
 
In Oxford, Ohio it is illegal for a woman to take off her clothes in front
of man's picture.
 
In North Carolina, it is illegal to use an elephant to plow a cotton field.
 
In Omaha, Nebraska it is against the law for a barber to shave a man's
chest.
 
In St. Louis, Missouri no woman may be rescued by a fireman if she is
wearing a nightgown.  She must be fully clothed.
 
In Brewton, Alabama it is illegal to fish from a motorboat while it is
being driven down a highway or street.
 
(My personal favorite:)
In Houston, Texas all prospective dogcatchers must report to a
psychoanalyst and be psychoanalyzed.  Only then will they be seriously
considered for the job.("Tell me, Mr. Johnson-- when did you first notice
this desire to pick up animals?)
 
On an international note:
 
Men can be executed by firing squad in Mogadishu, Somalia if they get
caught vocally opposing the law that gives equal rights to women.
 
In Kenya, any foreigner caught streaking "will be immediately arrested,
escort directly to the airport in the nude, and put aboard the first
available aircraft to his country of origin."  However, local citizens can
streak all they want.
 
Persons caught jaywalking in Swat, a tiny Himalayan state, are forced to
run along the road until they fall over from total exhaustion.
 
And finally:
 
A driving regulation in Tokyo, Japan is translated for English-speaking
drivers as: "When a passenger of the foot hooves into sight, tootie the horn
trumpet.  If he still obstacles your passage, tootie him with vigor and and
express by word of mouth warning, 'Hi Hi.'"

P.S.  Did I mention that it's illegal in Miami for men to wear strapless
      gowns?

   Secret Service vetoes a target
   ------------------------------

      Orlando, Fla. -- A right-wing Young Republican group, bowing to
pressure from the US Secret Service, yesterday backed off plans to use
enlarged photos of President-elect Bill Clinton as targets for a weekend
turkey shoot.
   
      "They came down hard on us, saying we threatened the President,
things like that," said David Abrami, vice president of the Central Florida
Young Republican Club.  "So we canceled it."
   
      When Abrami heard the Secret Service was investigating, he was
worried.  Yesterday morning, he spoke with the Secret Service, then decided
to cancel the event.
   
      "We just figured he's head of the Democratic Party right now, and
we're Republicans," said Abrami.  "We thought it would be a nice parody.
We didn't mean any ill will by it."

From:	MX%"tkeeling@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu" 24-NOV-1992 14:07:37.97

  THIS IS TAKEN FROM A VERY FUNNY ARTICLE IN A NEWSPAPER:

  The First 100 Days Of The Clinton Presidency.

  Day 1: Taking a page from Jimmy Carter, Clinton passes on the limo ride.
He jogs down Pennsylvania Avenue.  His speech is an impressive appeal for
national unity, but unfortunately he loses his voice halfway through and
delivers the remainder of the text with hand signals.  It takes the
audience four hours to get "infrastructure." Half the country leaves the
event thinking the Vice-President is named "Sounds Like Spore."

  Day 2: Executive Order 001 repeals the 1980's to great national
rejoicing.  The construction industry immediately rebounds as huge teams of
workers begin to disassemble all the skyscrapers and strip malls built in
the last 10 years.  Michael Milken dissolves before his jailers' eyes.
Ronald Reagan's hair instantly turns white.

  Day 3: Inflation is in double digits, and, oddly enough, several hundred
Americans are being held hostage by Iran.  President Clinton explains that
he was overly broad in his zeal to undo the last 10 years, and announces he
is repealing only those portions of the 80's in which some people did
better than other people.  Construction crews begin to reassemble the
skyscrapers - but only certain floors.

  Day 4: The Clinton Legislative Agenda arrives in Congress.  Aerial
photography captures the stirring sight of the 150-truck convoy as it pulls
up to the steps of the capitol.

  Day 5: President Clinton, worried about the constitutionality of sending
troops to Bosnia without congressional approval, persuades the Reagan-Bush
era Supreme Court appointees to go to Sarajevo and investigate the matter.
He personally drives them to the airport and puts them on the plane, and
suffer minor scratches trying to fit the seat belt on a struggling Justice
Souter.

  Day 6: A grim President Clinton announces he will submit his nominations
to fill the five new Supreme Court Vacancies after his 100 days have
passed.  In the meantime, Mario Cuomo will sit on the court, pending
medical examinations confirming he has the egos of five men.

  Day 7: Based on a quick skim of the bill of loading, Congress passes the
legislation contained in the first 37 tractor-trailers.

  Day 8: Taking a page from Amy Carter, Chelsea Clinton builds a tree
house.  Actually she just files the environment impact statement. This
forces the new administration's first crisis.  Vice President Gore
privately protests that the planned construction does not take into account
the needs and desires of the tree.  Homeless advocates assail the house as
a cruel boast of plenty in the shadow of need. Chelsea changes plans and
builds a cardboard box on a heating grate behind the West Wing.

  Days 11-98: Congress passes everything, but in its haste to conclude its
efforts, members mix up the bills.  The result: a tax on all college-loan
recipients who make more then $200,000 and are currently working for a
foreign corporation that is rebuilding the infrastructure.  Estimated
revenue: $3.79.  The news media has a field day with the one person who
actually fits the criteria; a bewildered kid from Omaha.

  Day 99: Clinton goes on TV to talk about his accomplishments.  "The
nation is moving forward," he says hoarsely.  He uses geological charts and
diagrams of plate tectonics to prove that the U.S. will physically move
farther in his administration than during the entire Reagan-Bush era.  The
stock market soars on rumors that the U.S. will move a half-centimeter to
the East in the next quarter.  "It's not only morning in America," Clinton
exults.  "It's morning a fraction of a second earlier than it was under the
Republicans."

  Day 100: And he saw that it was good.  And he rested.

"Antarctic Life Proves Hard Even for Those Who Love Their Work"

... How boring is life in the Antarctic?  People in one group wintering at
the South Pole in the 1960s watched the film "Cat Ballou" 87 times. People
in another, after tiring of the westerns, Disney features and pornographic
films on hand, spliced the movies together into their own production and
adopted a vocabulary based on their creation that was so strange that
relief crews arriving in the spring could barely understand them. ...

   Here is a listing of totally whacked-out events that have occurred in the
 past year across the country.  There are some *very* weird people out there.  So, here is some of them:

 Los Angeles:  A Beverly Hills thief went on a two-day robbery spree,
traveling from store to store by chaffered limousine.  The driver of the
white stretch limo told police that his passenger had been acting
strangely, directing the car to fast-food outlets, a hobby store, a grocery
store and a coin store.  Police found at least $26,000 in coins and
jewelry in the limo.

 Tacoma, Wash. :  The ex-husband of a new age "channeler" charged that his
former wife coerced him into accepting an inadequate divorce settlement by
threatening to cut off his access to the 35,000 year old Atlantis warrior
named "ramtha" for whom she claims to speak with.

 Kansas City, Mo.: Police, where cattle rustling is still a hanging
offense, have been puzzling over a string of what appear to be drive-by cow
shootings. "It is really not that easy to investigate", said Clay County
Detective. "The remaining cows make poor witnesses."

 Los Angeles:  A judge ruled that a man could not will his frozen sperm to
his girlfriend.

 Wellington, New Zealand:  A man was charged with intentionally blowing up
three parakeets with firecrackers during a burglary.

 Torrington, Conn.:  Two men who were denied drinks at a tavern because

      I have travelled through this very airport.

                      WORLD'S NO.1 AIRPORT-FOR CORPSES!

     The city of Fort Lauderdale, FL., ships a staggering 4,000 dead bodies
out of its international airport every year.  Airline experts say no other
airport anywhere in the world even comes close to having such a tremendous
traffic in corpses.

Don't you wish you lived in Austin!?!?  Check this out:

Snagged from the austin.general newsgroup:

John Kelso, "Bubba columnist" for the Austin paper reports
(American-Statesman, Saturday, 1/9/93):

 When Ku Klux Klan members rally at the Capitol a week from today, they may
see something they will never forget - a mass mooning.

 This mind-boggling and completely unusual proposition is the brainchild of
Austin musician Steve Fromholz.  If you want to moon the Klan, just show up
and join in with Fromholz.  You don't even need a ticket.  No place but
Austin.

 "I can see the bumper stickers now - I mooned the Klan, Austin '93," says
Fromholz, who to date has only a half dozen or so friends lined up for the
extravaganza.  But he expects many volunteers will make plans to attend,
once the word gets out.

 "I'm certain there are a lot of people in Austin who would leap at the
opportunity to moon the Klan," Fromholz says.  "There are some in the
community who would worry about losing their place in the community, or
losing their job  But there are some of us who don't have to worry about
that."

 Fromholz likes this idea because he sees it as a peaceful way to show the
Klan that it isn't appreciated around these parts.  It would be nice to
completely ignore the Klan, but you know that won't happen.

 Sooooo, instead of getting all worked up and cussing and blowing your top,
drop your britches, pull them up, then walk off, Fromholz suggests.

 "It's a way to say, `We don't need you, go someplace else to get mooned,'"
Fromholz said.  "It's a very simple way of saying, 'I hold the Klan in
total disrespect.'  Just moon them and walk away and go back to work.  Just
laugh at them. Don't shout at them and shoot them the finger."

 Fromholz is so serious about this that he called Travis County Sheriff
Terry Keel to ask if a group mooning is legal.  Imagine calling the
Sheriff's office and asking that question.  I'll be you would get
transferred a bunch, huh?

 "I had a nice conversation with Steve about that," Keel said.  He says a
group mooning is legal as long as the participants don't get too explicit,
you might say.  He says the law regarding this activity does not address
"the subject of cheeks."

 Keel also said that though he couldn't give the group mooning his
"official blessing or clearance," he thought it was a good concept. "Steve
has the right approach," he said.  "People counterdemonstrate, which is the
wrong way to handle it."

 Anyway, it must have been an interesting conversation.

 "It's hilarious and he was all excited when he talked to me about it,"
Keel recalled.  "What was the word he used?  It was as if a vision came to
him."

 "It came to me in a flash of light," said Fromholz, who even has his
outfit picked out for the affair - a pair of jeans over red long johns.

 "You got to believe," he said.  "It's like keeping Tinkerbell alive. But I
can picturalize it, and if I can picturalize it, it will usually happen."

 So what should you do if you want to involve your civic group in this mass
mooning of the Klan?  Simple come around and go for it.  Junior Leaguers,
Lions, SOSers, developers - come one, come all.  Fromholz sees this as a
community thing, although I think there are some of y'all who should stay
in the house.  I won't name any names, though.  I don't need the
aggravation.

 OK.  So I'll name one.  Radio guy Bob Cole.

 "It has great possibilities if the Optimises would come out, and the VFW
and the American Legion, and perhaps the Legislature," Fromholz said. "They
showed their (fannies) all t he way through this last session."

 Fromholz advises anyone taking part to keep their distance from the Klan
members, though.

 "Mooning a rally is a lot different than mooning a parade," he explained.
"The thing is you've got to be careful with a rally. They're not marching
by, so they might kick you in the moon, and they're notorious
moon-kickers."

 No matter what you think about this, it sure is unique.

 "I don't think anyone's ever mooned the Klan before, at least not en
masse," Fromholz said.  "But it's an idea whose time has come.  And I think
Martin Luther King would approve.  This is nonviolent protest at its best."

 Maybe so.  But I wonder how they'll handle it on CNN?
