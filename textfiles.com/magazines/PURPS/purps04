INTRODUCTION
(Too Soon!  Too Soon!)

  Excuse me while I catch my breath.

  That's better.  No, you are not hallucinating.  The last one
of these things was just yesterday.  Things are coming in at a
truly alarming rate right now, and this will be the only free
time I have to put this all together (Hail Creiza) for quite some
time now (Hail OTIS!!!!).  Don't, please, expect another issue
for a couple of weeks.  You haven't the space.  I haven't the
time.

  The mailing list is either shrinking or coalescing now. 
Although we are spread out all over the net (thanks, Mal.  By the
way there's only ONE thing here from you this issue {:-)), the
actual dis.list is holding steady at 32.  Oddly, our support
from the faculty seems a tad more constant than that of the
students.  (And no, I'm not saying any more on that one, thanks
{:-)).

  I am currently constructing a Purps archive division of all
the stuff which gets submitted that's too large to fit here, the
WP back files, and many other things.  As members of Purps you
all have read access privileges to these files.  You can't
rewrite them or delete them, but you can copy them over to your
account, read them there, and print them out.  The files, oddly
enough, are at [Stevensj].  Hopefully, I will be able to come up
with a file of brief abstracts [Stevensj] purps.essential, which
will tell you how to get at these things.  Topics right now
include OTISian stuff, UFOs, Conspiracy Theory, and OTHER.  More
will be added.  The number of files is limited by my 1,000 blocks
as of yet...  If you're not on the Kenyon Vax, send me a message,
and I'll send you an abstract.  The simplest solution, of course,
would be to dump these things into a subdirectory, but
apparently, I lack the system privilege to create one.

  In what will I hope be the last mistake of its kind, I
deleted, Margaretten, your friend's not so noble edition to
Webster's when deleting for space.  Please send it again, and
I'll see what I can do with it.

>> The "War On Drugs"
(an ABBREVIATED copy of H.R. Bill 4079, another attempt to
"cleanse" this nation of its drug problem.  This is a long one,
and you might want to skim it.  Section 151 (a) where the fourth
amendment is revoked is interesting, although since this bill
declares a five year state of national emergency, ANY
constitutional right could "legally" come under the ax. "Ppe"

   In article <125@ctbilbo.UUCP> pete@ctbilbo.UUCP (Pete Ritter) writes:
  >A few nights ago on the radio, I caught the tail end of a discussion of

  >purpose of the bill is to make it easier to prosecute dealers and users of
  illegal drugs.

  I just received a copy of H.R.4079 in the mail.  As soon as I read the 
  original posting, I phoned up the Bill Status Office, in Washington, 
  ((202)225-1772) and requested a copy.  For those interested in obtaining
  a copy, I was referred to the House Document Room, (202)225-3456.  They 
  sent a copy, free of charge (it took 3 days). 
  
  H.R.4079 is truly an incredible assault on our Constitutional rights.  The
  Bill is 96 pages long, however, I have listed several interesting excerpts 
  below.  The excerpted text is straight out of the Bill, except where noted
  in brackets.

       To provide swift and certain punishment for criminals in order to
            deter violent crime and rid America of illegal drug use.
  
           House of Representatives, February 22, 1990, Mr. Gingrich. 
  [Gingrich is the main sponsor, however, there is a list of other 
   Representatives who, presumably, want their name on the Bill, also. -tf].
  
  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE
  
      This Act may be cited as the "National Drug and Crime Emergency Act".
  .
  .
  SECTION 3. 
     (b) Declaration of National Drug and Crime Emergency -
         (1) Guided by the principles that energized and sustained the 
          mobilization for World War II, and in order to remove violent
          criminals from the streets and meet the extraordinary threat
          that is posed to the Nation by the use and trafficking of 
          illegal drugs, the Congress declares the existence of a
          National Drug and Crime Emergency beginning on the date of 
          enactment of this Act and ending on the date that is 5 years
          after the date of enactment of this Act.
  
         (2) During the National Drug and Crime Emergency declared in
          paragraph (1), it shall be the policy of the United States
          that ---
            (A) every person who is convicted in a Federal court of a
             crime of violence against a person or a drug trafficking
             felony (other than simple possession) shall be sentenced
             to and shall serve a full term of no less than 5 years'
             imprisonment without release;
               (B) prisoners may be housed in tents, and other temporary
             facilities may be utilized, consistent with security
             requirements; and
               (C) the Federal courts may limit or place a "cap" on the
             inmate population level of a Federal or State prison
             or jail only when an inmate proves that crowding has 
             resulted in cruel and unusual punishment of the 
             plaintiff inmate and no other remedy exists.

              a Federal court shall not hold prison or jail crowding
              unconstitutional under the eighth amendment except to the
              extent that an individual plaintiff inmate proves that the 
              crowding causes the infliction of cruel and unusual
              punishment of that inmate.
  
          [ several long winded paragraphs then go on to say that if this

            be excluded in a proceeding in a court of the United States on
            the ground that it was obtained in violation of a statute, an
            administrative rule or regulation, or a rule of procedure unless

   Hi,did you see my note or did your weird eye just got in the room without
even noticing?  Well just to tell you that the grass is still  purple,
although some think it's pink(in fact only when it rains), and the mountains
blue.
I've been telling this all day.  This is a colourfull day and grassy not to be

Subject: a real urban legend - them slugs like Bud
Stat

This is one of those semi-arcane stories you hear about, but never believe.
I think this guy actually did this study.  The paper is floating around
Thinking Machines, if anyone cares.  Don't ask me for a copy, though.

Here is the abstract:

      ATTRACTIVENESS OF BEER AND FERMENTATION PRODUCTS TO
             DEROCERAS SPECIES GARDEN SLUGS
                      
                 Whitney S Cransaw
             Department of Entomology
             Colorado State University
              Fort Collins, COlorado 80523

  ABSTRACT:  A series of field trials were conducted to determine the
  attractiveness of various malt beverages and fermentation products to
  Deroceras species garden slugs.  Among 12 tested American beers, a 3-fold
  range in attractiveness was measured, based on trap captures.  Alcohol was
  not involved in attractiveness to slugs as highest captures were effected
  with Kingsbury Malt Beverage, a non-alcoholic malt beverage.  Furthermore,
  alcoholic fortification of 48-hr flattened beers had variable, and
  occasionally negative, effects on slug captures.  Sugar water/yeast
  combinations showed substantial attractiveness to slugs with mixtures
  involving larger yeast > baking yeast > ale yeast, water check.  The
  addition of surface active compounds did not increase slug capture in sugar
  water/yeast baited traps.  A brewery waste product (malted grain fiber)
  also showed attractiveness to garden slugs, with increased attractiveness
  following amendment with sucrose and active yeasts.


Some notes:

The surface active compounds the abstract talks about (also known as
"surfactants") were Ivory Dishwashing detergent and also a wetting agent,
Aqua-gro.  As far as I know, no slug tests have been performed with the
surfactant used in Gillette foamy, nonoxynol-9.

Gallo Pink Chablis was tested and was not attractive to slugs, but
unfermented grape juice was.

Among the beers tested are Rainer, Strohs, Schaefer, Bud, Bud Light, Pabst
Blue Ribbon, Coors, Coors Light, Miller, Michelob, Kingsbury Malt Beverage.
The testing methodology was impeachable: each test trial tested 4 beers in
randomized locations in a 4 block slug trap, scattered in numerous
locations throughout a "heavily vegetated yard".  One of the beers was
always Bud, and results are expressed in ratio form relative to the Bud
standard.


P.S.  If for some reason you need to reach the author, here is how to reach
