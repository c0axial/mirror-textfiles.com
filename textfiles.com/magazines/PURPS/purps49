As usual, we're late.  As usual, I'm not satisfied with the job I did here,
but it will have to do. As usual, we've been having a ton of new members
join up and who no doubt could use enlightenment.

I don't really mean to sound negative, honest. My car is just dead again.
It's becoming a regular pox on my life. Oh well. I have a sink full of
dishes wash too. Still, I suppose, we all have our greased yaks to ride
hither and yon.

Hopefully, this issue will amuse and inspire you. Hopefully, I can get my
act together finally and get purps out a bit more regularly.. etc and so
on..

Anyway, one job that needs to be done is getting Purps some sort of OTIS
fact file. The masses are demanding a document of this sort be written. The
Church Elders due to  being involved in projects of their own, like Books
and digs to pre-iron age lake side villages in Poland haven't been able to
attend to this.

If there is a kind soul out there who'd like to try their hand at writing
an OTIS fact file I'm sure the Pope, I, and Doc Simpson could point you in
the right direction.  So if OTIS inspires any of you give HailOtis a yell
and we'll get the ball rolling.

One final note, the semester is coming to an end and what not in a bit. If
you are going away for the summer and your account is being shut down
could you please give HailOtis a yell so we don't end up with a mailbox
full of bounce notices. And remember next semester HailOtis will still be
here. It will be starting into it's 4th year by the fall.

[One final note which may or may not mean much. The wheels of progress are
finally turning and we may end up with a unix box here which hopefully will
mean some interesting improvements to Purps and OTIS in general. Probably
nothing will come of this until the summer, but watch for announcements.]

Declaration of Resentment
The Antisocialist Party


I.      There are Nazis in this world: politicians all, fundamentalcase
religions, racists and heritage brokers of all descent, separatists without
individuality.  We resent having to deal with these insipid, dangerous
jerks. We resent having to resort to getting shot, infected with deadly
diseases, and having our lives and lifestyles preempted and cramped by your
obscene celebration of ignorance and mediocrity.

II.     "Racial purity" is a contradiction in terms.  Race is fraction -
and infraction. Circumstance is thicker than blood.  Service to racial
causes causes racial servitude.

III.    All history is revisionist.  Be here NOW or go away altogether.
Latter-day Lindburg Babies will have their petty AntiSemetic bluffs called;
we don't care who your parents were!  Emancipate yourself. Perspective is a
dangerous gift - why else do you think they want to steal it? Afrocentrism?
Egocentrism. Claims to be "descendants of Kings & Queens" sounds more like
Dukes (dupes)...

IV.     "Culture" is impossible to "steal" - there is no culture worth
having that is not community property. "Societies" don't innovate;
individuals do. Societies are lifeless 'bodies' guilty of theft of
intellectual properties and suppression and censorship.  Class without
style is nothing to be proud of.

V.      Sexuality isn't sexism; antisexuality is. Eroticism doesn't
"objectify"; the play's the thing.

VI.     JIHAD: the only definition, the only "holy war" is resistance
against those who believe in "holy war".  Groups of more than 7 or so are
inherently corrupt.

BANGKOK -- A gang of transvestites has been robbing tourists after enticing
them to suck their tranquilizer-laced nipples, police said Tuesday.
 
Police arrested four Bangkok transvestites and a woman Sunday after
complaints were received from a Syrian and a Hong Kong man.
 
The Syrian said he was robbed of a Rolex watch and more than $4,000 in
cash, police said.
 
The transvestites' breasts were smeared with tranquilizers to put the
unwitting victims to sleep, a police spokesman said.
 
Drugging drinks is a favorite tactic for gangs preying on tourists.
 
"But many of our customers did not drink, so we would get them to suck our
drug-laced nipples," transvestite Somboom Wannasut was quoted by the Nation
newspaper as saying.
 
A standby tactic used by the gang was to feed the customers laced
chocolates, police said.

Having read the article posted here about tranquilized nipples being used
to rob visitors to Bangkok, I thought I would post a similarly offbeam,
almost gleeful voodoo tale from the Star, a Ugandan daily newspaper, dated
27 August 1992.  I don't live in Uganda (and if I did I almost certainly
couldn't post to usenet news - but hey I live in Europe and I still can't
do so directly); this was faxed to a friend of mine.
 
PROLONGED ERECTION VICTIM HAS DIED
Erizefani Mugoya, the unfortunate man who has been going through untold
agony following an abnormally prolonged erection of his penis for the last
two weeks, has finally passed away after being hospitalised at Kamuli
hospital during the course of his ordeal.

Sources from Kamuli told the Star yesterday that Mugoya, who was last heard
of to be semi-conscious and suspended on drip, by courtesy of his stubbornly
stiff painful organ, died after an episode of two weeks' misery.
Mugoya's death struck at a crucial moment when his relatives were also
reportedly engaged in serious negotiation with one John Mutyabule, the
husband of the wife with whom the deceased fornicated before his genital
became unbearably stiff.

Mutyabule of Bukholi in Iganga had previously demanded a ransom fee before
he could uncast the charm he had put on Mugoya.  (stuff deleted)  Doctors
are said to have gone ahead and operated on their rare patient.  Sadly Mugoya
never recovered from the surgery, confirming Mutyabule's threat not to involve
Western medicine in this traditional debacle (sic?).

Mugoya, a lively middle-aged man from Buwenge, 17 miles from Jinja ventured
to Bukholi from where he eloped with Mutyabule's wife...After fraternising on
that fateful night, Mugoya was alarmed when his penis challengingly remained
erect in spite of the man's exhaustion.

As matters grew worse, Mugoya was rushed to hospital after his lover had
failed to alleviate the problem with soothing warm water.  He was admitted
at Kamuli where doctors prescribed injection after injection in an attempt
to calm the dangerous-looking organ but to no avail.

(stuff deleted)

The ransom was too much for his relatives...By the time of his operation
Mugoya had lost consciousness and he never recovered from the surgery

WEIRDNUZ.260 (News of the Weird, January 29, 1993)
by Chuck Shepherd

Lead Story

* In December, Archie Johnston, 18, became the youngest person ever to head
a Ku Klux Klan group when he took over as imperial wizard of the
Independent Knights of the KKK in Orlando, Fla.  He says his dad "is
totally against it" but that his mom "trusts" him to do a good job. [St.
Petersburg Times, 12-15-92]

The Continuing Crisis

* In November, a St. Louis judge accepted a guilty plea from rock star Axl
Rose to settle assault and property damage charges, permitting Rose an
unusual privilege for a convicted criminal:  He would not be totally
forbidden from associating with ex-felons.  That provision was important to
Rose because two of the members of his Guns N' Roses band are ex-felons.
[St. Louis Post-Dispatch, 11-10-92]

* In July, three trained dolphins escaped from their performing pen at an
exclusive resort in Key Largo, Fla., and swam away.  They were found
several days later in a lagoon by a golf course on Key Biscayne, Fla.,
where, on their own, they showed up at 10 a.m., 2 p.m., and 4 p.m. (the
same times as the Key Largo shows), and performed tricks, apparently hoping
to be fed. [Baltimore Sun, 7-29-92]

* Police in Portland, Maine, told the Associated Press in December that
they have been unable to catch the person who has defaced about 2,000 cars
in the city over the last ten years by spraying them with acid.  A city
crime analyst, noting that most vandals escalate their attacks rather than
stick with the same method, wondered, "How could anyone do this for a
decade and not get bored?" [New York Times-AP, 12-6-92]

* The Akron (Ohio) Beacon Journal reported in November that Michele Straka
was released from a local alcohol treatment center, thus becoming what is
believed to be the nation's youngest such graduate.  Michele, 11, told a
reporter, "I was into some pretty heavy stuff."  [Athens Messenger-AP, 11-
30-92]

* In October, Switzerland apologized to Liechtenstein for its army's
invasion of the country a few days earlier.  Swiss army recruits on
maneuvers asked a resident near the town of Triesenberg if they could set
up an observation post in her garage, but later discovered that Triesenberg
is just outside Swiss territory.  The woman alerted local police, who asked
the soldiers to move on. [Los Angeles Times-Reuters, 10-18-92]

* Recently, parents of a Colorado teenager announced they would sue the
local school system for failing to alert them that their son's creative
writing papers revealed his emotional problems.  In one example cited by
the Denver Post, the boy wrote a story about a man's vicious torture of a
woman, concluding that now the man "was in control" and "had the power."
However, the teacher merely marked the paper "C-minus," commenting, "No
focus! . . . (You're missing the point of this.)" Shortly after he
submitted the paper, the boy sexually assaulted two stepbrothers. [Denver
Post, Nov92]

* Mr. M. K. O. Abiola, chief of Nigeria's Yoruba tribe, answering a divorce
lawsuit in a New York City courtroom in June, denied a woman's claim that
she was one of his 26 wives.  He contended that he had only four wives but
said she was one of his 18 concubines. The woman is represented by palimony
lawyer Marvin Mitchelson. [Chicago Tribune, Jun92]

* In Omaha, Lela Schaecher gave birth to a girl on November 20, the same
day on which her twin sister, Lisa, also gave birth to a girl.  Lisa has
the same last name as Lela because both women married men named Schaecher,
who are first cousins. [St. Louis Post-Dispatch-AP, 11-27-92]

* Joseph W. Charles, 82, retired in October from his "job" as the Waving
Man in Berkeley, Calif.  He stationed himself in his front yard daily
during morning rush hour for the last 30 years and waved to motorists.
[Akron Beacon Journal-AP, 10-8-92]

* The Legal Aid Society of Santa Clara County, Calif., charged in October
that the man who has portrayed Koo-Koo the Klown ["Kiddies' Favorite
Entertainer"] at birthday parties in the area for nearly 30 years routinely
violates state law at the apartment complex he owns by not renting to
tenants with children. [San Jose Mercury News, Oct92]

* Pacific News Service reported in June that female temperance patrols in 
India's northeast state of Manipur have been successful in curtailing 
males' drinking problems, which, they say, lead to wife-beating and 
unemployment.  The patrols destroy local stills and then capture men who 
were drinking, tie them naked to a donkey, and parade them through the 
local villages, where they are encouraged to promise never to drink again.  
The patrol now has 30,000 female members. [Pacific News Service-Washington 
Post, 6-12-92]

The Weirdo-American Community

* University of California at Berkeley "environmental psychologist" Clare 
Cooper Marcus recently started a counseling service for people having 
difficult relationships with their houses.  For $100, she will spend an 
hour conducting role-playing sessions between the client and his or her 
house.  Dr. Marcus says that having the client voice anxieties to the 
house, and having the house respond, usually begins relieving the client's 
stress within the first hour. [Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Dec92]

Least Competent People

* In December near Mineral Wells, Tex., three men who were attempting to 
steal copper wire off live electrical lines for resale were electrocuted.  
Copper wiring is a valuable scrap metal in Texas but is usually stolen from 
electric cables that are not being used. [Fort Worth Star-Telegram, 1-1-93]

Inexplicable

* At least 18 people were arrested around Manila in the Philippines on 
December 27 for deflating automobile tires for religious reasons.  
Followers of "The Reserved Manpower Of The Good Wisdom For All Nations" 
religion said it was "God's order" to let out air. Said one, "Air is from 
God.  This is the solution to the crisis in our country." [Huntsville 
Times-AP, 12-28-92]

Subject: More Household Chemicals to Beware Of...

Posting by dragon@eleazar.dartmouth.edu (Sam Conway) in sci.chem:

I am growing weary of seeing chemicals with warning labels that imply that
I shall die a horrible death simply by looking at the contents. A warning
label should inform me of any *REAL* hazards, and of the precautions I
should take when handling the reagent, and should not serve only to cover
the manufacturer's derriere should some lawyer-happy numbskull decide to
bathe in the product.

A case in point from Fisher Scientific:

CAUTION:  May be harmful if inhaled.  May cause irritation. Inhalation may
produce irritation, coughing and acute pneumoconiosis from overwhelming
exposure to dust.  May cause a rapidly-developing pulmonary insufficiency,
labored breathing, tachypnea and cyanosis followed by cor pulmonale and a
short survival time.  More frequently, after 10-25 years exposure, labored
breathing, dry cough, chest pain, decreased vital capacity and diminished
chest expansion may occur and progress to marked fatigue, extreme labored
breathing and cyanosis, anorexia, cough with stringy mucous, pleuratic pain
and incapacity to work.  Death may result from cardiac failure or
destruction of lung tissue with resulting anoxia.  Has caused tumorigenic
effects in laboratory animals.  Skin contact may cause irritation and
dermatitis.  Eye contact may cause redness, irritation, and conjunctivitis.

TARGET ORGANS AFFECTED:  Eyes, skin, and mucous membranes.  Provide local
exhaust ventilation and/or general dilution ventilation to meet published
limits.

FIRST AID -- INHALATION.  Remove from exposure area to fresh air
immediately.  If breathing has stopped, perform artificial respiration.
Keep person warm and at rest.  Get medical attention immediately.  SKIN:
Remove contaminated clothing and shoes immediately.  Wash affected area
with soap or mild detergent and large amounts of water (approximately 15-20
minutes).  Get medical attention.  EYES:  Wash eyes immediately with large
amounts of water, occasionally lifting upper and lower lids (approximately
15-20 minutes).  Get medical attention.

 Yes indeed, all of this fits right on the bottle.  And just what is
 this hazardous product?

                         Public Health in Pakistan
     
     
     Returning from Afghanistan I entered Pakistan via the border town  of
Wanna.  This  is a town in what  is  known  as  "Tribal Territory".  The
tribal  areas  are  areas  where  the  Pakistan authorities have no
jurisdiction and affairs are run by the local Pathans.   Most  of  the
Afghan  border  area in the  North  West Frontier is tribal territory.

     I had a rather bad case of dysentery, and the locals manning an  ad
hoc  road  block who kept  leaning  over  me  with  their Kalishnikovs
seemed to think it would be a good idea if I saw  a doctor.  The Pathans
once they have decided you are not an  enemy will do anything to protect
you. I was assigned a bodyguard  from the group standing around and a
turbaned gentleman complete  with automatic rifle and bandoleer slid in
beside me and popped a  wad of tobacco in his cheek.

     They knew that in the town there was an ICRC  (International Committee
of  the  Red Cross) hospital that  took  care  of  war damaged  Afghans  so
we drove there. The  Afghan  guard  at  the hospital explained that it was
a surgical unit only and suggested we  go  to the "Civil Hospital" in town.
No one  seemed  to  know where  this hospital was. We drove around and
eventually found  a driveway  that said "Diarrhea Treatment Unit". We drove
in.  The place was in darkness, but we pulled up outside a door that  said
"Emergency Treatment Unit". There was an armed guard sitting next to his
Lee Enfield. He opened the door and turned on the lights.

     I  was shown a bed to lie on while the guard went  to  fetch the
doctor. The bed had recently been vomited on. It had only  a mattress  on
it. The room was lit with a single tired forty  Watt fluorescent  light.
The tube was black with flies.  The  concrete floor was covered with
discarded drug cartons, to keep the  flies down,  three  frogs  were
hopping between  the  cartons  gobbling flies.

     Before  the doctor arrived, various people, some armed  with
Kalishnikovs,  came  in  and looked at  me.  The  doctor  finally arrived
and  I  was  moved  to another  room  and  laid  on  the examination table.
This room had its own frogs hopping around  on the floor. The doctor asked
what the problem was and did all  the temperature  and blood pressure
things. His  immediate  diagnosis was malaria. When I questioned him about
this he said that eighty percent of admissions were malaria.

     The  doctor wrote a prescription and someone was  dispatched to  the
local pharmacy. There was some concern that  I  had  not eaten  for  three
days and I was asked what I wanted  to  eat.  I compromised  and  agreed
to eat plain boiled rice.  One  of  the nurses  went home to cook the rice.
All the nurses were men.

     The staff whiled away the time by taking turns on the prayer mat  in
the corner of the examination room. The  runner  returned from  the
pharmacy and the doctor set up  a  disposable  glucose drip.  After  some
rummaging through a drawer  of  old  fashioned syringes  a disposable IV
needle was located. The  doctor  opened the  hanger  loop with his teeth
and I was set up.  A  disposable syringe  and  needle  was also found after
much  chatter  and  an antibiotic  and analgesic were injected into the
drip bag. I  was left alone with the drip.

     After  a while the nurse arrived with the rice and a  spoon. The  rice
was not fully cooked, the last thing I felt like  doing was  eating. The
only thing I could possibly eat was rice. I  ate some of the rice. The
Pathans have the same ideas of  hospitality as  the  Bedouins. This means
if they offer  you  something,  you accept it.

     As  I was sitting unsteadily on the edge of the bed  chewing the  rice
people started drifting in and out again to  view  the "foreigner". They
don't get many tourists in places like Wanna. A few  of  the curious
onlookers had AK-47s casually  slung  across their shoulders. One of the
visitors was an earnest looking young man  who came up to me and asked if I
was a Christian. I was  the most  Christian  person I had met for a few
weeks  and  certainly wasn't  a  Moslem, so I said yes. He excitedly told
me he  was  a Christian.

     The  young man was a Punjabi, and said he was one of  twenty eight
families  of Christians in the Wanna area. He told  me  he worked in the
hospital and taught the doctors English. He said he was very excited to
meet another Christian, he had the fervor  of a  young  fundamentalist.
Apparently the word was all  over  town that  there was an American in the
hospital. It seems that  small town Pakistan was like a small town anywhere
else in the world. A stranger in town was a big event.

     I  ate all I could of the rice and was told I  should  spend the
night  in the hospital. I asked to use the  toilet  and  was shown a "hole
in the floor" flush toilet. There was no light  and of course no toilet
paper. I had my own toilet paper, I left  the door open for light.

     I  was  escorted to the ward where the doctor wanted  me  to spend
the night. The ward was a relic of the British Empire.  It was  a long room
with a row of beds against each long  wall.  The beds were the old iron
hospital beds. On each bed was a mattress. There  was  no  bedding. There
was no  mosquito  netting  on  the windows or doors. There were three
overhead fans for ventilation.

     The ward was partly filled. The occupants were men and boys. The far
end of the ward was screened off. Behind the screen was a young  boy  and
his mother. The mother was wearing a  burqa.  The floor of the ward was
also littered with discarded drug packages. Under  my bed was a discarded
disposable syringe and needle.  For mosquito  control,  there were three
bats  flying  backwards  and forwards.  During the night one of the bats
failed to  dodge  the fan  blades and expired against the blades with a
loud  clatter. Bat bits were scattered across the room.

     Just  before  dawn the call to the faithful was  made  by  a nearby
muezzin.  This started activity in the ward.  Those  that could  started
their  morning  devotions.  One  of  the  praying faithful was the mother
at the far end of the ward. As dawn  rose various  visitors  started
wandering into the ward. Most  of  the visitors were armed with
Kalishnikov's - the male jewelry of  the Pathans.  One  of the young boys
got up and found  the  discarded disposable  syringe under my bed. He
grabbed it and went back  to his  side  of  the  ward where he  and
another  boy  entertained themselves playing with their new toy.

     My driver and guide arrived to pick me up and drive me  back to
Peshawar.  As I walked through the hospital grounds I  saw  a sign above a
door, it said: "Intensive Care Unit". Regretfully, I didn't peep in.

                               END

WEIRDNUZ.261 (News of the Weird, February 5, 1993)
by Chuck Shepherd

Lead Story

* Former U. S. diplomat Felix Bloch, the man suspected of espionage while
working at the U. S. Embassy in Vienna in 1989, was arrested in January and
charged with stealing $100 worth of groceries from a Harris Teeter grocery
store in Chapel Hill, N. C.  After the State Department dismissed him,
Bloch embarked on a second career as a cashier and bagger at the store. Two
store employees said they saw Bloch cart unpaid-for groceries to his
Mercedes-Benz. [Durham Herald, 1-12- 93]

Government in Action

* In a recent Canadian government book offering tips to newly-arriving
immigrants, authors thought it necessary to give specific advice against
being late to school or work and against public displays of affection,
breast- feeding, urination, and defecation. [Edmonton Sun-CP, 11-22-92]

* When Long Island, N. Y., school superintendent Edward J. Murphy retired
on September 30, he earned severance pay of over $100,000 at a time of
severe financial troubles for New York schools.  However, that was only the
beginning.  Under the contract he had negotiated with the local school
board in 1985, Murphy was entitled to 90 days' paid vacation a year (the
normal is 15 to 20), plus paid sick leave--with the option of accumulating
it and cashing it in at a rate of $1,000 a day.  His total severance
package came to more than $900,000. [New York Times, 12-9-92]

* Pre-Christmas-week paychecks were delayed for 2,600 Postal Service
employees in the Hampton Roads, Va., area.  The checks had been mailed from
the Minneapolis check disbursing facility but were delayed "somewhere in
Virginia," according to postal officials.  Because of the delay, employees
were unable to deposit the checks before the Christmas holiday. [Newport
News Daily Press, 1-1-93]

* U. S. Department of Agriculture meat inspector Roger W. "Pockets"
Halvorson, 56, was indicted in Minneapolis in January for stealing meat
several times from a company he was inspecting.  According to prosecutors,
Halvorson, whose unique personal uniform has extra- large inside pockets,
was accused of loading up on prime rib during inspections, intending to
resell it. [New Haven Register-AP, 1-8-93]

Compelling Explanations

* Eric F. Murillo, charged with shooting his fourth wife to death in
Fayetteville, N. C., in July, said it was an accident.  Murillo received
probation for the accidental shooting death of his first wife 21 years ago.
Wife number two supposedly committed suicide. Wife number three divorced
Murillo after he put a loaded .357 Magnum in her mouth and threatened to
kill her.  Murillo acknowledged that the circumstances "look terrible" but
said he was just unlucky. [Philadelphia Inquirer-Boston Globe, 8-22-92]

* Vancouver, British Columbia, judge Jerome Paradis found David Alexander
Snow guilty of sexual assault in September but not guilty of the attempted
murder of his victim, a 53-year-old woman who had survived the Auschwitz
concentration camp as a child.  Wrote Paradis, "I cannot conclude that the
placing of the wire around the neck of the victim and/or the placing of the
plastic over her head are sufficient to establish a specific intent to
kill." [North Bay Nugget-CP, 9-15-92]

* In November, the Vermont Supreme Court ordered to trial the
handicap-discrimination lawsuit by employee Mary Hodgdon against the Mount
Mansfield resort.  The resort, which was trying to improve its image in
1987 to four-star status, fired Hodgdon because she refused to wear her
false teeth, which she said were painful. Wrote the resort management,
"Employees [are] expected to have teeth and wear them daily to work."
[Rutland Daily Herald-AP, Nov92]

* Michele Rardin, 36, ticketed for driving 80 mph in Hebron, Ind., in July,
told patrolman Randy Komisarcik that when the oil-warning light came on on
her dashboard, she felt she had to race home "before the car blew up."
[Chicago Tribune, Jul92]

* Delano Brugguier, 23, denied he was attempting to break into Sid's
Liquors in Sioux Falls, S. D., in June when he was discovered stuck in the
store's chimney. Rather, he said, he had passed out on the roof and, being
a fitful sleeper, had merely rolled into the chimney. [Sioux City Journal,
Jun92]

* Richard Usher, Jr., was arrested in Decatur, Ga., in June for bigamy when
his wife (Evelyn Deloris) found out, via an insurance payoff, that another
Mrs. Richard Usher, Jr., (Evelyn Nelms, whom he had married in 1985) had
just passed away.  Wrote Detective C. E. Bolson in his report, "The only
explanation [Usher] could offer was that he did not remember marrying
[Evelyn Nelms]." [Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Jul92]

The Weirdo-American Community

* Wesley Nunley, 73, recently declared that the $10,000 concrete slab he
built on his property near Dallas was open for business as "U-F-O Landing
Base 1."  He said it has been a dream of his "for decades" to have aliens
land on his property--even though the landing pad is located in a quarry
and is surrounded by mud much of the year.  Nunley's best friend told the
Dallas Morning News that Nunley was "a little off." [Austin American-
Statesman-AP, 12-20-92]

Least Competent Person

* Former Quik Trip convenience store employee Mark Douglas, 32, was
arrested for robbing the store in December in Overland Park, Kan., after
police interviewed him and his girlfriend, whom he had failed to brief as
to what to say.  The robber had worn a cap, and when police asked Douglas
whether he had such a cap, he said no, but the girlfriend said, "Yes, you
do. It's in the closet." [Overland Park Sun, 12-30-92]

Inexplicable

* Part-time security guard Bob Huggins, 86, was notified in November that
his share of The Gaston Gazette's pension plan is nearly $1 million.
Huggins began working at production jobs in 1926 and became a guard in
1974.  He had never earned more than $8,000 in a year, and the company had
no pension plan at all until 1989.  Huggins's award is so large because the
1989 plan was poorly designed and because Huggins outlived all others in
his employee category. [Charleston Post & Courier-AP, 11-20-92]

        JERUSALEM (UPI) -- God by fax?
        It was probably inevitable that someone would try to exploit
Jerusalem's prime location and offer to dispatch messages to the
Almighty with state-of-the-art technology.
        That's what Israel's telephone company did Wednesday.
        For the price of a call, Bezek workers will take faxed prayers,
blessings and heartfelt wishes and tuck them inside the many cracks of
the Western Wall, revered by Jews as the holiest place on Earth.

        The towering stone wall in Jerusalem's Old City, a remnant of the
Great Temple destroyed by the Romans in A.D. 70, is already crammed with
thousands of pieces of paper scrawled with visitors' deepest sentiments.
Many Jews believe God reads the messages and makes them come true.
        ``If you want to put a note in the 'Kotel' (Western Wall) but can't
go there yourself, we'll do it for you,'' said Danny Ezer, a Bezek
spokesman.
        He said the AT&T and MCI telephone networks in the United States have
expressed interest in promoting the service abroad.
                               ------
        The fax number, including the international and city codes for Israel
and Jerusalem, is 972-2-612222.

Subject: Who killed Donald Duck?

"WHO KILLED DONALD DUCK?" Since 17 January Belgrade media have been
extensively reporting on the Walt Disney corporation's decision to ban
publication of its comic strips in Serbia-Montenegro and the likely
sociological and psychological impact on the country's children.  Politika,
which has run the Donald Duck series since 1932, showed an astonished
Donald in chains with Mickey Mouse crying, "Sanctions Banish Mickey and
Donald." Independent radio B92 commented, "the psychological impact of this
ban is greater than any of the other UN-imposed sanctions." The latest
cover of the independent weekly Vreme is headlined "Who Killed Donald
Duck?" and depicts a dazed Donald being shot in the back of the head from a
cannon on a model frigate.  Milan Andrejevich, RFE/RL, Inc.

Super OTISnistic Existential Determinism

(1) Being that OTIS has conveyed his words to us in the Old Peppermint &
the New Spearmint. OTIS has stated his ways that all hear may understand way,
with clarity much. (1+2i) OTIS has already chosen those whom OTIS will bless 
with strangeness and those who should receive grinding of teeth and wailing. 
This blessing has nothing to do with their actions, but if they bless OTIS
and the worshipers of OTIS with CASH, OTIS will be favorable. (2x+3y^2) Being
that there exists the elite CHOSEN of OTIS, these blessed shall be presented
with ETERNAL Tupperware parties and The Everlasting Fruit Salad shall rain
upon their days. ( <n|-ih d/dt|m> ) OTIS having chosen those who shall receive
the effluent of OTIS, those who look upon them must hold their noses. These
cursed shall never know the secret joys of Fruit Salad and live their 
meager lives in IGNORANCE. (~A - AxB) The ones who have donated their 
lives and time to OTIS were predestined to, but the ones who donate their
pocket books are THE ONES THAT OTIS HAS CHOSEN WITH NO REGARD TO THEIR
ACTIONS. If YOU IMMEDIATELY BEGIN DONATING HUGE SUMS OF CASH AND OTIS
SHINES UPON YOU, THE TWO ARE NOT RELATED--IT WAS PREDESTINED. THOSE WHO
DON'T DONATE, DISPLAY OTIS'S CHOICE FOR THEIR ULTIMATE FATE FOR ALL TO LOOK
UPON THEM AND LAUGH.

There was a great story on CNN International over the weekend.  In case any
of you didn't hear about it, this guy (aged 20) asked a girl (also age 20) 
to dance in a club in Florida, I think.  Well, one thing lead to another,
and soon they were having sex.  Problem was, they were having sex right on
the dance floor.  They seemed totally oblivious to the hundreds of people
around them.  The police finally had to pull them apart!

The funny thing was that neither of them was drunk or stoned (according to
CNN), and the guy didn't even know her name.

Now, although I'm not condoning their behavior, I envy them their passion.
They were two consenting adults with an overpowering physical attraction.
I've never felt passion like that, and I doubt that 99.99% of the human race
has, either.  No, this is not something to build a future on, but it'd
certainly be great if they do have other things in common.  I hope the guy
did get her name...

It's reasonably well known that the national anthem of the USA, "The Star

English drinking song.  My question: can anyone supply me with the original
words or a reference to where I might find them?  My quartet may

If you can find it, the _Oak, Ash and Thorn Songbook_ has a couple of
verses.  I only remember one [below].  Recall that the song originated as
the theme song of the Anacreontic Society, dedicated to booze and
boozy-song:

       To Anacreon in heav'n where he sat in full glee,
       A few sons of harmony sent a petition
       That he their inspirer and patron might be,
       When this answer arrived from that jolly old Grecian:

       "Voice, fiddle, and flute, no longer be mute;
       I'll lend ye my name, and inspire ye to boot.
       And long may the sons of Anacreon entwine.......[ long hold :-) ]
       The myrtle of Venus and Bachchus's wine."

So I get this offer in the mail - 
        "Switch to Sprint and get $35 credit on your next phone bill"
 
I figure, "Why not?  $35 is good money for a phone call."
So I call Sprint and make the switch.
 
Two weeks later I get an offer from AT&T -
 
        "We want you back - switch and get $25 credit"
Thinking, "Sure, why not", I put the offer aside, but forget to follow up.
 
A week later a $75 check arrives from AT&T -
 
        "Endorse and cash this check, and we switch you back" Can't
argue with that. So I cash it and we're back with AT&T.
 
Another two weeks pass and I get a call from Sprint -
 
        Sprint Lady: "We want you back at Sprint"
        Me: "What incentive are you offering"
        Sprint Lady: "Better service and prices than AT&T"
        Me: "But AT&T just paid me $75"
        Sprint Lady: "I can't give you any money, but listen,
        
        SWITCH BACK TO SPRINT NOW AND THEN AT&T WILL SEND YOU
        ANOTHER $75 - THEN GO BACK TO AT&T!   WE'RE HAPPY TO
        HAVE AT&T SPEND THEIR MONEY ON YOU."
 
Really, that's what she said.  I gave her full points for creative
marketing and agreed to go back to Sprint.
 
Sure enough, yesterday a check arrives from AT&T - but only for $25.
Then that night I get a "please switch back" call from AT&T.
 
        Me: "I got your $25 check today - what's the best you can offer me?"
        AT&T Guy: "The screen says I can offer $75"
        Me: "Make it a hundred and you've got a deal"
        AT$T Guy: "I can't go over $75, but I'll tell you what -
 
        GO AHEAD AND CASH THE $25 CHECK ANYWAY AND I'LL ALSO
        SEND YOU $75 IN CREDIT CERTIFICATES"
 
Really, that's what he said.  So, you guessed it, we're back with
AT&T.
 
So I'm thinking, this is a great business.  Why not install a few
dozen phone lines and earn a living just swapping long distance
carriers?  On average I could probably net $50 per line per month.
 
But why stop there?  How about starting a company that handles long
distance company switching for the public?  I could sign people up
giving me discretion of which LD company to use, and take 20% of the
incentive fee, passing 80% back to the consumer.  Of course, then some
enterprising soul will start a competing company and offer my
switchers an incentive to switch to his switching company ...

                      Calling All Australian Otisians
===========================================================================
[I can't find the follow up letter to this, so I use this one. Basically
it's against official OTISian policy to give out mailing addresses.
And it's against the editors personal policy as well.

Anyway, if there are any Australian Otisian who'd care to get in contact
with this fellow feel free to. His address is listed below and I'm sure
he'll be over joyed. Also, no doubt, Otis will shower blessings on you. He is
new to the fold and could use some instruction and training. ]

HAIL!

Greetings To You, Pope, Reverends and patron saints, and even Elbo, who has
been really quiet since his creation, and all at the IGHF.

Thank you firstly for clearing up that thing with the cult of AH-tis.
People like that aren't funny.  Not the ones I know anyway.

Secondly, thank you for inviting me to all the parties at Kenyon or
wherever, but while I fully plan to make the pilgrimage one day, sadly I
cannot make it just yet.  Instead, could you mail me the PURPS distribution
list, so that I may find some more, um, geographically convienient
followers.

                                All my Love,
                                                Spike

     .....{{  -----  __o         Sky clear up.  Sunlight is
     ....{   -----  _\<,         Brilliant.  Let's ride far away.
     ...{{  ----- (*)' (*)       (remember sunscreen and HAIL OTIS)
   Everything that is, is light.      Every man and every woman is a star.
