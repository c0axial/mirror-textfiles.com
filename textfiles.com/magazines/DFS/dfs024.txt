                            Some Poems 2

Jerk
----
Out on Mulberry Pond I lurk
Searching for the Jerk.
I stand among the murk
Looking for the Jerk.
Wandering through the nettles,
I come across the Jerk.
I fall upon the Jerk.
The Jerk is no more.
Out on Mulberry Pond I lurk...

Sacred Book
-----------
I grab the sacred book
From his hands.
I give an evil look.
Still he stands.
The world bows to me.
I drop my pants and take a pee.

The Lights
----------
Turn off the lights.
Please start the fights.
Evil surrounds
The town
Burns
To the ground.
I leave the town
With a frown
On the ground.
The fights sucked.
Nobody died.

I Fight
-------
At night
I fight
With life
A light.
Wandering the streets
Eating my beets.
I gaze into a window
I see the broken glass.

Ode To A Butterfly
------------------
Oh wonderous bug, up in the air.
Please don't fly into my hair.
You're really gross and ugly too,
But I've heard you're good in butterfly stew.
When in the air, you flutter so,
And spittle on my big tow.
I swing and swat but still I miss,
Ouch! I think I broke my wrist.
Be damned you stupid ugly bug!
I wonder 'bout a butterfly rug...
Alas, this poem is finally done,
But, hunting butterflys is such fun!

Psycho Religious Zealots
------------------------
In Waco lived a guy who thought that he was God.
The ATF didn't think so, they wouldn't give him a nod.
Most people didn't care, 'til four of us were killed.
So then we got the bad guys, I guess that's what God willed.
At first they were a group, that no one cared about.
But once they got real violent, they then became a cult.
And then there was a battle, where eight of them then died.
No one really cared too much, I guess not many cried.
So after many weeks of waiting, the FBI got mad.
They decided to do something really good, no, something really bad.
They got a big huge tank, and drove it through the wall.
And then in poured the tear gas, to make the enemy fall.
But then without a warn, a big huge fire broke out.
I guess the Branch Davidians, were ending their big pout.
The fire burnt the compound right down to the ground.
And 'bout David Koresh, his body might be found,
Not that anyone really cares,
He's gone with all his guns and wares.
And now that it's all over, the people still must hope,
That this won't happen once again, this time to the Pope.

Blood and Guts
--------------
Blood and guts are dripping down.
Down down down upon the ground.
Drip drip drip drip drip drip drip.
Down down down down down down down.

Satan 1
-------
I like Satan, yes I do!
It's what we study in Sunday School.
Burn and pillage, rape and murder,
Anything to push our cause much further.
Let's sacrifice an animal.
How about my neighbor's cat?
It's getting rather fat.
Then we can eat it.

Stupid 1
--------
Damn this poem is stupid.
Geez it really sucks.
"No it doesn't" says my mind,
"Let's go shoot some ducks."

Fire 1
------
Fire fire in the sky.
Fire fire in my eye.
Fire fire in the pit.
Fire fire I've been hit.
Fire fire now I bleed.
Fire fire all I need.
Fire fire death shall come.
Fire fire but where from?
Fire fire they all die.
Fire fire time to fly.
Fire fire pain arrives.
Fire fire I close my eyes.
And die.

I Shall Kill
------------
I shall kill, oh yes I will.
That's correct, I'll kill kill kill.
Murder sounds good to me.
I'll push my victim from a tree.

I Eat French Fries
------------------
I eat french fries when I sleep.
I worship the god-like sheep.
If my god named Otto dies,
I'll go eat some more french fries!
The heathen god I bow down to,
Is worthy of a great big show.
Getting high is really fun,
Then I like to take a run.
I will eat spleen of lamb,
And garnish it with leg of Spam.

Lying In The Courtyard
----------------------
Lying in the courtyard there
I watch the snow fall down
Covering the filth
Of all the world
I look up
Happy
Dead.

You Suck
--------
It must suck to be you.
I really hate you.
I hope you fall through
The ice and die, you
Idiot.

Separated
---------
As I stand here wathing the clouds go by
In the sky
I see a drop of rain fall down
To the ground.
I feel the wind in the air
Through my hair.
I wish you were here
Though you're near.
But the deep, dark, cold ground
Separates us.
