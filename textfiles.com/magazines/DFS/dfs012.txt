                       The Light Bulb Bomb

Has a neighbor ever pissed you off, told your parents about something you
did to them or catch you doing something and report it to your parents???
Well here is a real simple way to fuck them over with brilliant light and
a little heat.  In case you haven't noticed this is all leading up to making  
a cool light bulb bomb, which although little, can cause great damage.


Now on to the goodies...  Ok, get yourself a light bulb (Wattage does not
matter), a syringe, and some gasoline.  Not many materials to make a nifty
little gadget like this.  First you fill the syringe with the gasoline, and 
carefuly pick up the light bulb.  Now you poke the syringe through the little
hole in the bottom of the light bulb (Don't push to hard or you will be making
a phone call to 911 for slit wrists) and empty the syringe, which should be
full of gasoline, in the light bulb.  Now you have a light bulb full of
gasoline.

Now for the fun part!!!  You find yourself a real asshole for a neighbor and
plot his nice surpise.  You have a number of choices now:  If you (Or your
parents) are house-sitting for the assholes, well then grab the keys and 
place one of these puppies in every one of their light sockets (This will 
ensure that you get them 1 time or another).  A word to the wise, and whoever
may be reading this; Make sure the light switch is off while you're screwing
the light bulb in the socket, because if you don't the neighbors might find 
you dead on their kitchen floor with little tiny glass pieces in your burnt
neck.  When they come home make sure you wait to give them their keys, you
don't want to be too close too the explosion.  If you wanna find out what 
happens, try it for yourself.  You could also just put these in their porch
lights or something, but inside the house produces a greater effect and lots 
more damage.  Well enough rambling on, if ya got balls do it...  If not, 
well.....

Hammer <Not the TOOL!!!  :)>
