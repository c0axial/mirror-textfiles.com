[Editor's Note: Ok, here's something interesting.  This guy logged on as George
 Steinbrenner and put this in his newuser feedback.  My comments are at the
 end.  -AD]

Obviously, I lied on my info-form.  So what.  I don't want access to you
stinkin borad.  I don't give a fuck if you are so high and mighty, I"LL KILL
YOU.  Maybe.  Yet, this give us a time to vent our anger and calm ourselves,
as I continue to lothe you.  I will give you what you what, new DFSs' for your
stupid little magaz.  I dare you to prove your worth by actually publishing
ti... Of course, you could be to weak to do that...

here is my submission:
Greets from the uploader of DFS #15.  I decided to call myself Wanko, as
I had no idea you would talk to each other... out of curiousity does this
look familiar?  It should... as you were one of the people involved.  This
isn't complete, but it shows what a high and mighty &*(@#!*$& you are..
LOOK at it and tell me that you aren't arrogant... If you have any guts,
post this as the next DFS........

For now, I'll call myself: terra incognita

Henceforth is the chat:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure.  All you have to do is log on as DFS and upload it there.  The password
is JINGLE JINGLE

Oh, why JINGLE JINGLE, like a phone ringing?

No... read DFS #5.

Oh yeah! The demented ice cream man!

yes.  By Dementia Praecox

Yup.  That was pretty cool also.  Do you right any other stuff, or is DFS all
you wrote?

I wrote one or two little text files a while back.. I forget about what.. but
right now, anything undergroundish I put in DFS.

Like, if I wrote an anarchy type story about , um, restaurants, it might go
in?

Sure.  I haven't rejected anything yet.  Unless it's like some sort of
pervert story, I'll publish it.

Cool, u/l under DFS jingle jingle.  Ok.  Um, you aren't going to validate me,

are you?

Nope.  My ratio of local users is too high as it is.

How many do you have now?

Users?  All together maybe 25... probably 10 from this area code.

neat.  Well, i guess it was kinda stupid to try to fool you, when i couldn't
even remember the zip code for ny... oh well.

oh well.  It's better this way.  Now, you just look dumb right now, but had
you actually been validated, I would have had to have been mad at you for a
few days.

so? anyway, maybe i can change names and stuff and try again.  I might even
fool you, you never know!

I doubt it.  I've started a thing where you have to have VERY good
references, even if you are long distance.  Or be in a group that people have
heard of so I can validate your existance.

Oh, still.  What would you have done if you found out who i was after

validation.

I'm not at will to say.

uh huh... were you on-line all the time, or did you walk in part way?

right when you started the infoform.

Oh, so you didn't notice that I couldn't spell chloroform.  Thats just as wel

well.  Then I probably would have been disconnected right away.

probably.. oh, and one other thing, if you try to look like you're from
another ac, ahhhh.... don't call at 4:30 in the afternoon.

Yeah, i know, but I was bored.  Those were pretty nifty legal warnings you
posted.  Wow! I mean, technicly speaking, are you doing anything illegal bu
distributing the text files?

Nope.  Nothing at all illegal about this BBS.  No WaReZ, no k0dez, no XXX
gifs, nothing.  Just informative text.

Oh, but you have elite and console areas...

Just message areas.  Those aren't illegal... 1st Amendmant

Hehe, yeah, I guess you're right.  Still, I'm not sure why you dont let 414's
on then!  Oh, I have to go now.  Bye!

later

[More Editor's Notes: Wow.. I feel so.. so.. so arrogant!  I have not locked
out all locals.  In fact, at least half the users on Paradise Lost are local.
The people I lock out are the people who don't know anything about the topics
discussed on PL.  If I let every person on who wanted to be on, the board would
be busy all the time and the quality users who want to get on would have
problems.  This is also a view of a few months ago.  Maybe I was a little
arrogant <aren't we all?  This guy seems pretty stuck-up if he won't even come
into the open and say who he is.  And if he thinks I care if he insults DFS,
he's wrong> but I've changed.  I don't even have a NUP any more and I've let a
few more locals on.  I don't see anything bad about what I said in that chat.
To tell the truth, he seemed like a total moron.  Well, maybe he'll die or
something.  I really don't care.  But, hey, he challeneged me to publish this
and it doesn't bother me at all, so here it is.  -AD]
