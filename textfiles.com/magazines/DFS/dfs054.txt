      There was rain.. it seemed almost too much rain.  It flowed
 through the streets in small rivers and collected in puddles along
 the sidewalks.  It smacked against the sides of buildings.  It
 filled up all the weathered-in cracks along the ground, and took
 with it all the grime, all the muck and filth, that the city had
 collected during the day.  It beat steadily against his already
 completely drenched and soaked-through clothes, dripping under his
 collar and sliding down his back, none of which he felt.  It fell
 continually on her cold, lifeless face, mixing with his tears as he
 knelt over her shattered body, as he stared into her unfocused
 eyes, silently begging her to return to him.
      "Please.. please come back.. don't leave me..", he brushed
 aside her drooping hair and sobbed into her neck, "I love you.. ".
 She didn't move.  The rain continued its drumming.  Around them,
 the city was silent, waiting out the storm, as nature seemed to
 weep for her newly lost child.
      It had been so quick.. Jesus Christ.  What the hell had gone
 so terribly wrong?  What had she (or he?) possibly done to have
 deserved this?  He searched back through his already departing
 memory of the incident to try to remember what had even happened..

        that movie really could've been better but oh well you
        just can't pick these things just by the commercials that
        doesn't really matter anyways my god she's so beautiful

        don't like that car over there the color just doesn't
        look right i really like the color grey maybe i'll paint
        my house looks like it might rain soon shit i wonder if

        please where's the police...

      The day dawned bleak.  At first, he thought it was all some
 foul, accursed nightmare teasing his mind with the worst
 possibilities of his life.  Then he opened his eyes.  She was still
 gone.  He called out to her, pathetically hoping she was there, but
 empty silence and the dying echoes of his shouts were the only
 sounds that greeted him.  He collapsed into a weeping pile of
 wretchedness upon the bed.
      It had been almost a week, and he could still not sleep
 through the night.  He had eaten next to nothing and even that he
 could hardly keep down.  He couldn't go to work.  He couldn't go
 out with friends.  He couldn't do anything.
      Every single day he called the police, hoping that the
 situation had changed, hoping that they'd at least found something.
 Everyday, "Sergeant James Hicks" told him the same thing.
      "Sorry sir, we've got nothing new to report to you today,
 we'll call you if there's any new developments," the pig always
 said.  He had already spent hours talking to the prick, filling out
 reports.. and he despised him.  He seemed to be the incarnation of
 everything he found atrocious in people: gigantic, stupid,
 incompetent, a hopeless individual.
      Were they even ATTEMPTING to look for the killer?  That
 worthless bastard was out there somewhere, still alive, still free,
 while she was gone, an innocent victim in the world of the guilty.
 The police it seemed, did nothing, ever.  How many black berretas,
 with a 9 & 0 in the plates could there POSSIBLY BE for Christ's
 sake?!  He was obviously being screwed by the police.. there was to
 be no legal vengeance whatsoever for her death.  She was
 yesterday's news, and the police department had bigger and better
 things to do than to take care of a single vehicular homicide in
 this seething gutter of despair that somehow passed for a city.
      He sat alone in the apartment until once more darkness lit the
 city with its sweet, anonymous embrace.  Although he seemed to be
 staring at the wall, he didn't see it.  He saw only her, her dark,
 alluring eyes, her smiling face.. her broken body cradled in his
 arms.  Finally, he decided it was time for another try.  One more
 trip to the police station, one more attempt at justice.  He would
 go tonight, and he would go every night, until she was avenged, and
 her troubled soul could at last be laid to total peace.  It was all
 he had left now, his only reason to continue dragging himself
 through this melancholy cycle of pain called life.
      The streets were deserted as he walked the few blocks down to
 the police station, his heels dragging across the sidewalks
 wearily.  He arrived just in time to see someone walking to the
 parking lot.  Even through the haze of darkness, he could recognize
 Jim Hicks' fat, unkempt bulk shuffling through the parking lot
 towards his car.  He was about to call out to him, see if anything
 had happened, but found that he couldn't.  His ragged breath caught
 in his throat, and he slumped to the ground, still encased in the
 protective shadows of the night.
      "Oh god.. no..", he sobbed quietly to himself as the sergeant
 sped away in his sleek, black berreta, license plate NJC-590.

             _______________________________________


      Jim left work at the same time he did every night, slipping
 into his more relaxed "home" mood to escape the tensions of the
 day.  He certainly was not getting any younger, and his heart had
 been troubling him lately, especially with the shakeups he'd had
 recently.  He pulled open the door and slid his ponderous bulk
 behind the wheel of his new car, his pride and joy.  As he closed
 the door, a great sigh escaped him, and he relaxed entirely.  He
 only felt the first few dull pangs of agony after the metal bar
 smacked him over the head before dropping off into the depths of
 his subconscious.

              ______________________________________


      He was screaming again.  That was good.  It meant he was still
 alive, still in agony, and still paying.  No one could hear him
 here, anyways.  They were deep in the heart of a deserted warehouse
 near his parents' old home.  They had been here for hours now, and
 they had been busy.  Well, he had been busy.  Hicks, or what was
 left of him anyways, had been mostly screaming.
      "You're going to die, you miserable son of a bitch", he'd told
 Hicks when they'd started, "and it's going to be slow, so get
 ready".  Then he had become vengeance personified.
      At this point, Hicks was only barely recognizable as human.
 He was strapped naked to a chair, and rivers of blood seeped from
 almost every pore.  His right arm was stapled to a wooden desk, and
 the hand was completely crushed.  Bone fragments protruded all over
 from where the sledgehammer had gone to work.
      Long, deep gashes from a razor blade covered his entire torso.
 Rusted fishing hooks and nails peeked out from any open flaps of
 skin.  His entire body was covered with seared wounds, because
 everytime Hicks would pass out from pain, a red-hot poker would be
 plucked from the fire and pressed against his flesh.  He'd wake up
 screaming and start thrashing all around, and the work would begin
 again.
      Finally, hours later, there was really nothing left to do but
 leave him to die.  He sat in front of him, toying with a gun,
 waving it around enticingly.  Finally he spoke.
      "Should I kill you now, fuckface?", he asked him.  Hicks
 managed to groan out his approval around the stump of his tongue,
 which had been cut out earlier with a dull pocketknife.
      "Don't worry, you'll die soon enough.  Don't even think,
 though, not for a second, that you'll escape this by dying.  I
 haven't even started on you yet, you bastard.  When we meet again
 in Hell, I'll be laughing as I flay you to pieces by the hour.. For
 now, though, I'm just giving you something back that you gave to
 her..  How does it feel to know that you're about to die?  To know
 there's nothing you can do about it?" he stared at the quivering
 form for a bit.  Hicks said nothing.
      "Answer me!".  In response, Hicks moaned softly.
      Two shots rang out loudly through the warehouse, echoing back
 into the dank, foul recesses.  The contents of the false judicial
 champion's skull emptied onto the back wall, and fragments of bone
 littered the floor.  The haggard breathing stopped, and the form
 slumped over.  It was done.
      He sank down on the floor, shaking quietly.  Two tears slowly
 tracked their way down through his face, landing softly on the
 floor.
      "I love you", he said quietly in the darkness, before placing
 the gun into his own mouth.  Seconds later another shot rang out in
 the stillness.
      In the end, the papers called him a monster.  In the end, the
 police called him a demonic sadist bent on imagined vengeance.  In
 the end, he was shunned by society as a killer of its children, an
 eater of its innocence.  But in the end however, he was merely a
 lover.
