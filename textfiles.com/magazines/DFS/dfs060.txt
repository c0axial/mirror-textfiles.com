                             DFS Index #2

Yeah, so DFS is finally publishing again.  I'm sure everyone was afraid this
would happen again.  But I don't really fucking care.  If you really care
about why I didn't publish, it's because I was wasting my time in a place
called college.  That and the fact that no one ever submits.  So fuck all you
bitches!  So here's some more shit to look at.  Hey, maybe I'll even publish
again this summer?!?!  Wow, that would be so fucking k-RAD!$#@*&()))))@#&*()

Oh, and an appology.  Way long ago, when DFS #53 was released, the author's
name was misspelled Vald.  It should be Vlad.  Sorry d00d!#@@#%#

If for some reason you want to get in touch with me, I can be reached at
adenied@execpc.com.  *AND* DFS has a home page!#@*&  Oh glory!  It's URL is
http://www.execpc.com/~adenied.  You'll probably be able to find all sorts of
wacky cool shit there or something.  If I ever actually get around to setting
up links and shit.  And since it's my mag, I get to plug my big ass fucking
BBS all over the place!#@%@#^  It's a BIG FILE ARCHIVE for all you LEECHES!
The number's at the end of the file.  Over 10,000 files!&#@^@#&  Big fucking
wh00p.
