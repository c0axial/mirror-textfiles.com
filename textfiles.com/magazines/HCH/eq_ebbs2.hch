======[EQUiNOX]==================[THE MAKING OF AN ELITE BBS]====

Part 2 - Software

     I'm not about to tell you where to get the money for all
this, theres too many different situations people are in to find
a solution for all of them... so on with the software.
     Chances are you want something that looks good, but you need
to decide what you want to do, and what you want the software of
your board to say... examples...

Vision/2     - I don't like it, but you may get into it.  Its              
               specially tailored for an elite BBS, but is buggy. You
               may have some problems if you decide to choose this.

Wildcat!     - Understood as a shareware BBS, no problem, looks   
               fugly though.

PcBoard      - I'd like to see you get a program with more power, 
               a definite choice in my book, but a lot of $$

WWIV        - Forget it, or maybe not... never know, if you can   
              program, then change the whole source.

Renegade    - I personally don't like it... there are a lot of    
              bugs, but it is free, and has all the essentials.

Oblivion/2 - This flat out labels you as an elite BBS, although
             there are some bugs, it is widely respected.  And          
             the power is very impressive.

QUiVER     - Its still in its development stages, but I like it.
             wait on it a little bit though.

Vision-X  - A very nice piece of software, it resembles OBV/2 in  
            certain ways, but its routines are very slow, it      
            will be an annoyance.

     There's all the major BBS programs.  Remember, you need to
decide on your own personal needs before you make a final
decision.  PcBoard is made primarily for boards with more than 1
node, but that's not etched in stone, WildCat!  will give you a
safe cover (as in not a lot of people suspect a WC! elite board),
OBV/2 is extremely configurable, and all current bugs can be
worked around.  Vision-X will also label you as an elite BBS, its
not quite as powerful as OBV/2, but has very nice file and
message capabilities. Vision/2 is ok, I've seen a good board or 2
running it, I personally would get annoyed with all the bugs,
again, the choice is yours.  I wouldn't suggest WWIV, Renegade,
or QUiVER just yet, Renegade and WWIV are pretty much out, but
since QUiVER is making a rather fast and promising start, I would
peek in on it here and there if I were you.
     But which to choose?  Heres a little something that should
help you...             Sale:  WORSE:[12345678910]BEST
