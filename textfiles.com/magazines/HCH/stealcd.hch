1. Pick out the CD that you want.

2. Tell the cashier that you have a gift certificate. They make you go 
   downstairs to pay for it.

3. Find an appropriate spot to put it in your coat.

4. With CD inside your coat, ask a sales rep to show you to the bathroom.

5. Go inside a stall and sit down. The wiz price tag on a CD is the alarm part.

6. Peel all the celophane off. Flush it. Make sure nobody sees or hears you. 

7. Put it back in your coat and leave.

I can not be responsible for my writings. If you get arrested, not my fault. 
And also, if you work at a store and see this file, this is a precautiontion 
for you to keep better watch on people who come in the store...
