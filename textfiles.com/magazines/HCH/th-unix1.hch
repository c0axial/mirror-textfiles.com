UNiX Systems are phun to hack, then again, just hacking is awesome too, but
all in all, you must remember the true goal, and reason why the word hacker
came about, we did not get our names from just destroying things, because
that goes against almost anything that we stand for, the main idea of a hacker
is to just get in, and look around.

Hacking UNiX systems can be quite challenging.  The best thing for a hacker to
do when they have found a UNiX system, is to try out the default passwords, ie
things like: uucp, root, bin, test, default, system, setup, test, login 
(remember though, almost every account put in on an UNiX system is in LOWERCASE
ONLY).  The passwords for those accounts should be the same.  If you would like
some more, please look around, and ask about them, or call up Damage inc. (run
by Special Ed [iCE]) @ 6o9.767.37oi  ..and leave me some mail, and I'll get 'em
to you.

Once you have gotten into the system, you will find it to be very easy to get
around in (also depending on your account).  It's kinda like a dos type
environment, and most of the commands, you should be familiar with.  That 
concludes this text.
