		       THE IDIOTS GUIDE TO ALLIANCING
		       ------------------------------



	First,  you MUST have a SAFE and RELIABLE way to dial in to the bridge.
This can be accomplished by dialing either 0-700-456-100X, 200X, or 800-633-54
54.  Once you dial into the bridge, you will be greeted with two tones and the
stupid bitch saying "Welcome to AT&T Alliance Teleconference center...",  you 
will then be prompted to enter the # of ports you want for your conference. This
may be a value between 1-15.  

	After you (the idiot) have completed these SIMPLE fuctions, you will
hear a prompt "Dial 1+ACN..." hopefully, you will know how to use the bridge,
if not here is a list of some commands:



  ALLIANCE COMMANDS FOR THE IDIOT:
  --------------------------------
   # - Basic moving operations (Ex: Add Confree to Confrence, Enter yourself
				to the conference, Enter Dialing Room, etc.)
  6# - Transfer Control of the Bridge (Only Works When They Want It To!)

  9# - Enter a Silent Attendant Line (For you to have some peace, or put the
				      conference on hold)
   0 - Get a conference operator (Only use in extreme situations, when you call
				  they take control over, THEY ARE DUMB!, some
				  times they forget to give it back)

   NOTE:
   ----
	Although using an Alliance is safer than dialing a 950.  You should
   (AS ALWAYS) be cautios about personal information being said on these 
   bridges.  Operators CAN and SOMETIMES DO monitor SUSPICIOUS conferences.


   AS FOR SUSPICIOUS:
   _________________

	I can only say, use common sense.  (Ie: Don't make 1,000 calls to over
   seas numbers and expect them to overlook it as a NORMAL conference.  Extra
   ordinary things like that throw big FLAGS up in the operators brains, that
   is unless you are running a Twi-Lite conference.
