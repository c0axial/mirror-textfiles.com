The reader is at his/her own risk and must realize they can get into trouble
by doing the things contained in this file. So don't blame us if you get 
caught.


Ok, now the good part. There are a few steps to take in robbing a house.

First, obviously, pinpoint a house which contains wealthy people.  They must be
younger because old people are always home.  Basically you are looking for 
yuppies.  This process takes a year or so of planning.  When it snows, offer
to do their driveway, and they will ask you if you want to come in.  Say yes.
Then check everything you can around the house, and find a way to get in where
there are no alarms, or an easy access window.  I know they may have alarms 
because they are rich, but there is always a way.  Now, just get to know them.
Call them by their first names, and offer to do odd jobs for them like raking
leaves.  After a while, you will know more about them.  You will have to spy
and figure out when they get home from work, and write that down.  Make sure
the times are consitant.  

Now begin the plan.  You must spy in their windows and try to make an accurate
map of the house, but don't get caught spying or you have no chance of robbing
the house.  Now get ready.  Wait until the middle of the week, like Wednesday,
because later in the week, the yuppies may have some kind of plans and come 
home early.  When they are both gone, and their kids are at day care or 
whatever, go through the easy access are, or use a lock pick on the back door.
There are tons of lock picking texts, so i won't bother writing one.  To make
the stealing fast, bring a duffle bag, and only take small valuable things, 
and possibly one VCR.  Next, go to the dining room, look for the silver 
drawer.  Open it, if you see nothing, make sure there isn't a dust cover, which
most people have if the silver is expensive.  Take it.  Go into the basement
or the main room where the parents sleep.  You need to follow your map here.
Look at any book shelf you see for hidden treasure.  Here is a hint.

a book with something hidden in it has covers which stick out from the spine,
this is the easiest way to make a fast sweep of the book shelves.  Now go 
finish up looking for the expensive stuff.

Now refer to your plan, if they do not get home, and you see noone around in 
the neighborhood, look around some more, but make sure to get out atleast 1
or 2 hours before you expect the people home.  Oh yeah, and if they have a 
computer, make sure to have a disk handy and give them a nasty little virus
to go along with the things you stole.  Now run home, and make sure you can
find an alliby if you get caught.  For example, say "mom, its only (whatever 
time you began the robbing), can i go out to (some friends house)", your mom 
will remember the time you said, so if you get caught you have an alliby.  
The best thing to do, though, is not get caught...:)

Have fun, and make sure you don't get in trouble, and don't blame me if you 
do
