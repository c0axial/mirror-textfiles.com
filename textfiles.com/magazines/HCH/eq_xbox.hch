The Death of boxes...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Well, as I look around for newer and better phreaking plans,
I noticed the decline in boxes, its time for all of you who still
cling onto the concept to face reality... The old boxes are dead. 
Phone companies have made serious crack downs on these once
dominent devices, to my knowledge, New Jersey Bell, New York
Telephone, Bell Atlantic, and Bellcore have all found ways to
deal with BLACK, BLUE, BLOTTO, and SILVER boxes.  So what you
think... there's plenty more, right?  I wouldn't bet on it...  of
course new black technologies are coming out with more
sophisticated boxes every day, keep a look out for those... but
as for the P-80 system text files that so many hold as sacred...
leave them be, unless you want to spend the next half of your
life in a jail cell.
      But not to worry, all hope is not lost.  There are still
many more efficient ways of raising hell in this little place we
call earth.  PBX's, Carding Methods, and Blackmail methods are
still worth while.
      There are of course (as there always will be) boxes that
those "all knowing" phone companies can't get you for, if you act
quickly enough...  Gold boxes can be traced... count them out...
but what about a beige box.. hhmm... sounds interesting huh? 
Well how can you possibly be caught if you know how to run,
right?  And with the beige box, comes blackmail... which then
comes into some definite money.      OK you fabulous soon to
be... or present phreakers of America, and if you run into any
new methods, give HCH WHQ a call at (609)443-5789 and email the
sysop with all the info.
