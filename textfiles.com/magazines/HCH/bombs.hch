THESE ARE A FEW WAYS TO MAKE SOME HOMEMADE BOMBS IS YOU ALREADY DIDN'T KNOW

1. The pressure bomb. An easy one to make. First you take a tin can of any
size, preferable, a strong can. (PAINT CAN) Take a sealed glass bottle with 
vinegar in it and put it in the bottom of the can. (Make sure if fills almost 
half of the can) Now lay put a layer of tissue paper on top. Get some sharp 
rocks, and put them on top of the tissue paper. Now Pour about a quarter of
the can full of baking soda on top of the tissue paper and rocks. Now seal the 
top of the can with a small welding torch, or a soldering iron. Make sure the 
can is sealed. Now, get a rope and tie it around the can. Get on some
concrete and pound the can against it with the rope by throwing it. Get away,
and if done right in several minutes your gonna hear one hell of a bang. It's
easy, and destructive.

2. A pipe bomb. If you really want to do some damage, this is the way to go! 
First you get a thin walled pipe(Metal). Find someone who's over 18 to get
you some BLUE DOT GUNPOWDER from a navy surplus store, or a sportsman's store 
that carries guns. Open the top of the pipe, and solder the bottom shut.
Pack the gunpower into the pipe. (NOT TOO HARD) Get a piece of wick, 
or make one.(USE THIS END OF A CIGARETTE FOR LONG TIME) Now seal the top and 
wax the end of the wick somehow. Now put it under something or in a ditch, but
if it's on concrete you'll create one monsterous pothole. NOTE: Get as far
away as possible, and do not get within 1000 feet of anybody or animals, 
the bomb creates shrapnle. Just to show you the power, under a wood stove, 
the bomb put the stove 5 feet in the air. Have fun and bomb safely!
