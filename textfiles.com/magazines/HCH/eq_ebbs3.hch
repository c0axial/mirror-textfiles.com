=====[EQUiNOX]====================[THE MAKING OF AN ELITE BBS]===
Part 3 The hardware...

     Might as well get the main point across YOU WILL NOT HAVE AN
ELITE BBS UNLESS YOU HAVE AT LEAST A 14.4.  There, now, you have
the computer case, but what to fill it with?  First off, if you
want a locally recognized board, you would have to be between at
least 500megs and 1 gig and 1-2 nodes.  But if you want to be
nationally recognized, with LD callers pouring in... anywhere
between 1-5 gigs with at least 5 phone lines will do it, if you
put up a board with more than 5 gigs, shit... let me have the
number.  
     A cd-rom is always a good thing to have, it will take care
of your HPAVCT or porno crowd, or both if you decide on 2 cdroms. 
Then theres the tape backup drive.  I can honestly stress this as
a near essential when it comes to preserving hard drive space, if
you want to keep the games and utilities that are more than 0-30
day, then that's where you could shove them, and since there will
soon be a group of HPAVC'ers that will want to have access to
your board, chances are you'll need the backup.
     The pure secret to the absolute best mega bbs, I mean
something out of this world would have to be if you went into
phreaking and made the phone accessable from everywhere for free. 
That I could tip my hat to, but am not about to go into depth on
it, if you have the balls to try it, be my guest.
     Its not much, but it does make the board.  Once you get that
out of the way, your 30 percent done.
