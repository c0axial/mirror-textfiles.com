Hey people of 609, and all others should be also be aware of this.
i am going to keep my name anonymos because of the seriousness of this
information, to let ya know about me and to help on the sitution a
little bit, I run a bord here in 609, and i recently was looking throuh
some of the private mail, and i noticed a paticular msg to anoter user
(Mlusk) it had to do with the FCC hiting most o the 609 boards, i edited out
the msg, and put it in down ther below.
It seems the contents of the msg had to do with taking down, and getting
information on sertain BBS'S.  Here take a look-

-----------------------------------------------------

    Mlusk, this is what we now have and what we need you to get for us,
    get screen captures of the boards and try to talk to the sysop's
    and get them to talk about Commercial Software.  You know what I
    mean.  You were briefed on getting the captures and the conversations
    between you and the sysop's.  Also try to aquire the numbers and other
    information needed where it is missing.  And work from the top and
    start your way down, the ones at the top are priority.  Also, some
    might have New User Passwords (NUP), if they do you will probably
    be able to find it.  If not, call me and I'll see what I can do.

     Mlusk,.
    Now, call away...  These are the most important "Elite" Boards we
    want.  Work on it, and get as much information about the boards as
    possible, and work on all 14 as long as possible, see if they except
    donations, and get screen captures of that.  If you have any problems
    let me know, and if any boards act "funny" about the questions you ask,
    stop, and just try to get regular access, the main rule is to except
    anything and everything except giving your cover up.  And remember,
    if they ask you if you work for the "government or state", you can't
    lie, so try to avoid that question and do not give your cover,  and
    first try to use a fake (dummy) handle before you use your known one.
    You were told why before.  Ok, I'll keep in touch, but do your best
    and don't worry about long distance calls.  You are getting paid and
    all you have to do is highlight the long dis. calls on your phone bill
    and give it to me, and you will be paid for them also.

                 Bye Mlusk,    T-7

There that was the leter, some wierd stuff in there huh.  oh, this
letter was writen by a guy called 'SlideShow', i checked out the
information, phone number, etc.  and his numebr was just a fax
number.  All his informatioon was bogus, so i guess he was probably
checking out my board as he told Mlusk to do. I have seen this Mlusk
guy around befor, and his stuff was for real, i called him, and when
i did, i just told him I was voice validating him from my BBS, he stated
to me he did apply and he did say the password he gave me etc. But
then he told me he was alllready on, and insisted why i called to re-check
him, i told him i had to go, cuase i thouht he was geting real curios. The
next day the other guy 'SlideShow' came on and probably noticed all wares
were gone, and then deleted all msgs to Mlusk, then wrote a last one,.
         Here.....-

-----------------------------------------------------

    Mlusk, this is no longer a place to exchange msgs, I believe the
    system operator has read one, or more of our messages.  We can
    no longer talk on here.
    He has removed his wares, but I believe I got enough information
    already, but we will see.  If he reads this information, it doesn't
    matter, he can't do anything more.

                           T-7

----------------------------------------------------
       |^^^^
| I read that and I took down my board, i dunno what is going to happen
now, but i'm not movin to Canada, hehehehe.  And one thing puzzles me
is the T-7, the other guy put it at the end of every msg he wrote, only
to Mlusk.. But if anything does happen,
I am going to Mlusk's god damn house and kicking his ass.  Fight the Feds,
and burn the pigs, we should kill em all..   Anarchy Rules 94-95 and on
forever.   If you run a board, you should remove Mlusk, and check your
users carefully, and as a duty we should spread this file, and burn
all the Narcs CPU's to there fucking foreheads, and shove thier modems
up there wide dick-fucked assholes....

I put this in the mag because i wanted to warn everyone, i do not have elite
on my board, but they are on my back anyway, i have a private board though,
if you or your board are in this file, please change your NUP.  I am not
because i do not have anyhting copywright or anything on my board, but those
of you who do, please be warned
