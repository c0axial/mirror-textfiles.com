        The first step is to buy a caller ID. I have seen the prices range 
        from $40 to $80, the one for 40 has only the callers phone number.
        The one for 80 display's the name of the person who the phone is 
        registered to. The next step is get it activated, just call your 
        service rep from your phone company.  The SPA has a lock out on
        caller ID setup, the 80 dollar caller id hangs up on those people
        who call with a lock out, so most SPA members will be locked out. 
        This is not full proof, some boards have had SPA on their board
        and gotten busted even though they used caller id. The only other
        step to take is to lock out the area code where the SPA is, which
        is 202, or Washington DC.  I don't think there are too many users
        in Washington, so just lock out the whole area code by scrolling
        back on the caller id, and when you find the user who called from
        202, don't let them on. This is the closest you can get to having
        a fed free bbs, but it is not %100, but it helps if you are already
        taking a chance by having elite warez.

        Cost of this - $40 to $80

        Cost saved - thousands of dollars in fines, and jail terms
