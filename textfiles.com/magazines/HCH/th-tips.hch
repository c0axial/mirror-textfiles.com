Tips for War Dialing -- Written by The Temperate Hijacker
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

	Here are a few tips that beginning hackers should follow when
learning how to use a war dialer, and just some basic hacking do's and don'ts.


Tip 1 - Grab the best war dialer out there, I personally feel that ToneLoc
	v.98·10 (or later) is the best for what you are going to be doing.
	Make sure when you grab it, that you set it up properly to suit your 
	modem, because if not, your results aren't going to be very good.

Tip 2 - Start out with something small, with ToneLoc, you can choose what
	ever prefix, and suffix you want to scan.  When you are scanning, try
	not to scan more than 100 numbers at a time, doing all of this should
	take no more than 30-40 minutes.

Tip 3 - This is especially good if you are running a BBS that will allow you
	to have external events, and let you run them at any time you would
	like.  Set it up so that early in the morning (preferably) from anywhere
	between 9-10am, during the busiest hours, (so it looks like you're just
	calling in to exchange data), or really late at night.

Tip 4 - Try to scatter your calls, don't scan like 500 in one session, because
	if it does call somewhere twice, or a few times, you can get busted
	for annoying the public. 

Tip 5 - Make sure you are not mislead by the different sounding tones, there
	are three primarily that you can listen in on: 1 the regular "BBS" tone,
	the fax tone (kinda sounds like a bird =]), and the last one, the
	beutiful sound of a PBX.

Tip 6 - Remember almost all systems are usually running either a 1200 or a 2400
	with some type of compression, this is almost a sure sign of a place
	to check out.

Well, that's all for now, good luck, and happy scanning! <GRiN>

and remember, it is NOT illegal to scan numbers, just annoying...
