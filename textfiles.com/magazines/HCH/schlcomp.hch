Here are a few ways to fuck up the computers at school, just to get a laugh out
of how long it takes the ass hole "experts" at your school to figure out the
problem.

First Way:
Materials:
Strike anywhere matches
Sparklers (like the 4th of july ones)
double-sides tape
a disk

First, this is the very hard part, cut the tips off the matches so they don't
go off.  Then cover the double sided tape on one side lightly.  Now, crunch
up the sparklers and therest of the matches, and coat the rest of the tape
with it, make sure the sparklers are on top of the match part of it, because
it will take the heat of the matches to ignite the sparklers.  Now, open up
any disk, but do it carefully.  Make sure you do not ruin the disk or anything.
Now, use the other side of the tape and stick it to the disk on the lower side,
which would befacing the ground if you placed it straight up.  Now, wait until
the end of school, abnd pop in the disk, and RUN! The disk drive will spin, and
start the fire, which will ruin the computer.

Second way:
The next thing you can do is look at the back of the computer, and see what 
type of network is hooked up, if only one cable going to the next computer is
present, use a utility knife to cut a small slit in the wire, and get some
tin foil from lunch and stick it in.  This will allow for minimal wire
transfers, but the computer will still work.  It will take those high paid
technicians a long time to figure out this one.

Third way:
Get some juice, or some glue, and put it between the keys on every keyboard in
the class.  It will make the computers stick, but make sure you put it BETWEEN
the keys so it is not noticable.  Most of the time, the school will waste 
money getting new keyboards, and you won't have computer class for a while.

Fourth way:
every network has a printer shariong cable.  The best thing to do to it is not
disconnect it, because then the problem will be noticed, but what you should
do it slit it just to cut about half the connection.  The printing jobs will
get all fucked up, and most likely, they will think it is a problem with the
printer and never find the slit youmade.

Fifth way:
The easiest out of all of these ways is to find out where the data disks for 
the classes are held.  Most teachers say "don't touch the inside of the disk"
but it doesn't do much if you do.  Get some oil, and coat your hand with it. 
I know most of you have the urge to jerk off with it, but take it and touch
all the data disks, or just the ones of those people you don't like.

I hope you have fun doing these things, but if you get caught doing them,
you are responsible for your own actions, and i am not to blame for what you 
take it upon yourself to do.
