Things you can do with fireworks/explosives:

a. Thunderbombs:

        Ahh yes, these small but loud bombs you would normally think are
only for throwing on the sidewalk or something.  Well, here's a few things
you can do with thunderbombs that are quite a bit more fun and destructive.

1) I Call this the brick shitter.

What you need:

2 People to initiate prank
1 asshole with a house and a doorbell
1 pack of thunderbombs or black cats

The general idea is to scare the shit out of someone (thus make them shit
a brick).  Get a pack of thunderbombs, doesent matter how many bombs are
in your pack, just as long as it hasen't got wet or anything.  And walk up
to your enemy's house, and check for a place you can run where you will not 
be seen (try doing this at night, its a hell of a lot easier).  Walk up to
their front doorstep and get your lighter lit, as the other person rings 
the doorbell.  As soon as the doorbell is rung, light the bombs, and drop
the next to the door.  Now run like hell out of visible sight.  If you can,
sit back and watch the person who opened the door get the shock of their life.

Most people after being bombed will go out in their car and drive around for a
while looking for the attacker.  I would suggest laying low for a while until
they are done pointlessly roaming around the neighborhood.  If you are up for
it, bomb them again!  maybe even three times if you are feeling lucky!

b. Dynamite (1/4 Sticks)

        1/4 sticks can do a lot of damage, or they can do nothing.. you also
have to be very careful with them, and make sure you dont hold on too long.

2) I call this warzone.

What you need:

1   roll of duct tape
2-4 .25 sticks of Dynamite
2-5 people who have a common hate
1   soon to be fucked up house

The general idea of this prank is to do it and be gone, as far away as 
possible after it is done, since this is concidered a felony.  What you 
need to do is tape 1/4 sticks to various breakable spots on your enemy's 
house.  Have one person with each dynamite, with their watches sycronized.  
Have one extra person watching out for owners of house/cops/etc.. at a 
specific time, have all the attackers light the bombs.. This, to the 
owners or the house, will sound like a warzone in about 8 seconds.  Make 
sure you get FAR away.  It usually only takes the cops a few minutes to 
get there after they are called.  Go home and have a beer!

Well kiddies, thats all for this week, but keep a look out for this series 
and others from your friends at HCH!
