==[EQUiNOX]==================[THE MAKING OF AN ELITE BBS]========
Part 5 Wrap up...

     Its been fun, but now that you've done what I have advised,
there are just a few touch ups that need to be completed.
     First, get a professional ansi artist to help you out. 
Expect to pay a healthy sum for your entire board to be done
though.
     Secondly, join a few nets, the more attractive the posting,
the better, TOXiC NET, CCi NET, PRiMAL, and the all mighty
Infonet, and Fidonet are the best to be with.
     Try as hard as possible to become an outpost for as many
groups as you can.  The more the merrier.  And the more you get,
the easier it will be to apply for another.  
     Don't advertise too much.  Maybe twice on 2 good boards, and
thats it.  Don't worry, "they will come" hehe.
     When you first begin, you'll need to do a lot of the work. 
Get as many files on your own as possible to give others
incentive to upload.
     Its over and done with.  Sit back, and wait for users to
roll in, you'll have a lot of fun and I wish you the best of
luck.
