The Budgeted Anarchist - EQUiNOX

Good evening to all you Pyro's, and Anarchists out there.  There
has been many a time when I have been stuck outside with nothing
to do, and only 10 bucks to my name.  But believe me, after
thinking for about 5 minutes, I found more than enough to do with
my money.  Here are a few things I found you can do...






The Budget Pyro tip #1...

     Buy a bottle of motor oil, and splash it under the hood of a
car.  Make sure the car is off, and in the shade, and you won't
get hurt.  Then take a spark plug and cut it a bit so you get to
the part that actually creates a spark, and place it nicely on a
big oil puddle.





The Budget Anarchist tip #2...

     Buy a bottle of bleach.  empty 1 cup of it into a ziploc
bag.  Now go around the ground and pick up a nice sized clump of
dog shit, and put it in the bag.  SEAL IT QUICK!  Now shake the
bag and chuck it at your local house and run.  You do not
understand how toxic, this is.  It also smells like good mother
almighty.





The Budget Pyro tip #3...

     Many apartment complexes have garbage disposal bins.  And if
were stupid enough not to even listen to it, you may not have
noticed this, but theres a fire at the end of that thar' tunnel! 
And its usually just a straight chute down, where the average law
respecting citizen would nicely drop his non-flammable trash down
the chute.  Well as for the anti-social law hating monger that
you are (and me too) you can just grab some aerosol cans
(hairspray, cooking oil) or anything that says "Contents in
[Bottle/Can] are under pressure, do not puncture or place near
flame."  Chuck them down there, and run like hell!  Get out of
the fucking building!  You man cause a gas line to go, and that
is something you really don't want to wait around for, comprende? 
Ok... good luck.





The Budget Anarchist tip #4...

     Nothin' spells lovin' like a potato in the oven!  Yup, and
eggs too, just take a whole bunch of eggs and potatoes (and if
your really screwed, drench them in motor oil) and shove'm in a
microwave oven.  They both will explode, and the motor oil will
ignite.  This is a great way to give your home-economics teacher
a gift of affection.
