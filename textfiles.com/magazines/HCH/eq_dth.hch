===(EQUiNOX)====================---[Death to bbs'ing assholes]---




     We've all seen them, how couldn't we, they're everywhere,
little maggots who go into the bbs world and expect to find
acceptance.
     I never could stand some of those guys, and if you have one
in your area (which you must) and if you feel there is no hope,
fear not, you can make them retire from their reign of
irritation, but considering there are those who are more stubborn
that others, you may need to be a bit smarter than they are.
     First off, ask around.  Chances are this guy has about a
billion other aliases, the more you know, the better off you are. 
Try to get local sysops to get together to make sure he doesn't
have access to anything, and a call waiting lockout through
software interaction should always do the trick.  That should get
rid of about 80% of them.
     And if not, get him scared, I mean freaked out.  Start
posting anonymous oneliners, rumors, posts, anything you can do
that will let him know he's a dead man without him knowing who's
the murderer }:}.  Don't be skimpy with this either.  Think up
the worst, most excruciating experience, and just describe it in
a sentence, and spread your thoughts of happiness around.
     What?  The little asshole is still there?  Not to fear, when
all else fails, hurt the bastard.  Get to know a group of
"modemers" (for lack of a better term) and gang him.  But what
you need to make sure of is that you dress totally             
unrecognizable, and use either gloves, or use a brittle or
splintered form of wood.  I know what your thinking... ooh yea,
this is so stupid, I'll just go and beat the shit out of him in
street clothes.  Sorry man, but expect cops to arrive at your
house asking questions, the less they know, the better off  you
are.  Although it may seem a bit harsh, this guy may, or could
already have, developed into a hacker, or a phreaker, and will
make your life a living hell, best to take care of it now.
     When you prepare to mob him, as I said before, make sure
your faces are covered.  Attack quickly, and try not to make your
presence known (but don't get too carried away, bbs ninjas? 
There's a funny sight) and when you hit him, try to break his
fingers, they will not kill him, but cause immense pain.   Then,
to make your point of business known, a little whisper like "Its
kind of hard to call BBS's when you don't have any fingers, stay
out of out way).  From that point on, sit back and enjoy the
fireworks, aaaaah life it good.
