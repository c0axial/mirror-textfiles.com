\Your Body and How to use it to Kill someone/

God didn't make people with hands just to use to write or jerk off...He must
have had another reason in mind...What could that reason be...Well I would
guess that it is to kill people with them...

Your hands are the most natural weapon on earth...Did you know that a persons
hands can be classified as deadly weapons in some situations...Well if you 
didn't, now you know they can...

There are two ways that I know of to utilize your hands to kill or injure.
1) The heel of your hand
2) The Knife Edged Position of your Hand (Karate Chop)

1) The Knife Edged Position of your Hand

  a) A persons throat is very vunerable. When the hand is in the Knife Edged 
     position a strong strike to the throat should damage the person wind pipe
     and in some cases cause death.

2) The heel of your hand

   a) A strike to the nose can cause death instantly or just screw someone up
      pretty bad. When using the heel of the hand all you must do is thrust your
      hand upwards in a diagnol position making sure that the heel of your hand 
      strikes the nose. By doing this the nose should become broken and in some 
      cases the thrusting of the nose upwards will cause instant death.

I guess I will add a little extra for you.
Some people get the idea that you can break someones knee by just kicking them there.
Well it isn't that easy. When attempting to break the knee you must use a downward 
motion. Using the side of your foot lift your leg and then in a downward diagnol 
motion strike hard down on the knee. This should cause the persons knee to break
and then in turn cause them to fall to the ground.
