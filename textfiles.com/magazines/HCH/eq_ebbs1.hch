========[EQUiNOX]===========[THE MAKING OF AN ELITE BBS]========= 
Part 1 - Intro...

     So, you've decided to start an elite bbs, if you want to
make more gain than deposit, you'll need to start off right or
don't start off at all, pull a couple of wrong strings and all
you'll have is a computer that's on 24 hours a day for
decoration.
     Before we begin, have you considered the consequences of
starting an elite bbs?  Theres the Feds, the SPA, little assholes
who will turn you in, the FCC, Wayne Bell, so on and so forth...
you'll have to put up with people BEGGING you to get on, and
having to decide between a 17 year old courier with 20 megs of    
0-7 day wares to offer, or a 10 year old that's lying through his
teeth.  Then theres the hardware expansion you'll need to make,
software upgrades, and the like.  Not to mention the process of
getting financial income from users you may have.
     This group of text files should be able to help.  Read on,
and follow the instructions carefully, and you should turn out
ok.  But I make no promises, I've seen boards go up and become
successful by pure luck, and others by using some of the
following techniques, which one are you gonna trust?  (I would
lean towards the text files)
