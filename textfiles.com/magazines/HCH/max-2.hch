*Getting Your Money Back From a Pay Phone When You Are Done Making Your Call*

        Don't you hate it when you make a phone call, and then realize
        that you used your last quarter when you really needed it for
        something else. Well look no further, here is a solution that
        may work.                          

        It is very simple to do. This will usually work in two
        situations. The first situation is when you put money in the
        machine and it wont let you make your call. And the second
        situation is when you use up your last quarter and you want it
        back.

        All you do is dial a 950- number. For example dial 950-8732.
        This should get you your quarter back.
        


*Hotwiring Cars*
        
        Now I have never personally hotwired a car but I did know someone
        that has. He explained to me how he did and it seemed simple enough.

        1) Break into the Car. Do it however you want. Just be carefule of
           ALARMS.

        2) Cut open, rip open, open in any way but expose the part of the dash 
           near the ignition. Now depending on the car look for matching colored 
           wires. They are usually red but depending on the car it can varay.

        3) No strip the wires or whatever needs to be done. And then cross them
           or for you under achievers tie the metal (stripped) ends together and
           VROOMMM!
