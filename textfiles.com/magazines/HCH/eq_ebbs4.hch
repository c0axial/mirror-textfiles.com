===[EQUiNOX]==================[THE MAKINGS OF AN ELITE BBS]=====
Part 4 - The Users...

     If you've made it this far, I congratulate you, you have the
software, you have the hardware, but now about the users.  Its a
shame to say it, but as far as I'm concerned, affiliations make
the man.  If its ACiD, let'm in.  If its iCE, GOTHiC, EMPiRE,
VIP, or another popular group, let'm in.  Don't ask them what
they want, its what they will give you in return that matters. 
Sure, you have your share of wares, but if a VIP member courier
logs on with 20 megs to contribute, validate him you moron, and
if you want to play dirty, lower his UL/DL ratio a bit }:}.
     As for those who have records for being assholes, and
leeching until they have no more blood left in their veins, don't
even look at the user form.
     When an infoform prompts for "Users who will vouch for you,"
its not there for decoration, ask around, see if their worth it,
and if you can't handle it all, put in New User Voting, then that
will take care of itself.
     Once that is all over, the job of eyeing users comes into
play.  But again, you can't do all this yourself, that's why god
made the co-sysop.  Have maybe... 2, and tell them to look
around.  You'll be surprised how easy your life will be.
     Finally, LD users are like gold, (but there are of course LD
assholes) so I would let as many on as possible.
     That's really all there is to know as far as that is
concerned.  On to the next file...
