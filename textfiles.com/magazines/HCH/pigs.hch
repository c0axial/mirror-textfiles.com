       This is yet another text file that will tell you how to create
       several types of very devistating bombs.  These devices should
       NOT be constructed in your home, and should only be made outside.
       While constuctind these bombs, you should use as much protection
       as possible.  Have fun reading this text file, and if you plan 
       on constructing any of these......please be careful!
              
       -=Pig CO2 Bomb=-

       This bomb is very easy to construct.  You will need an empty CO2
       cartridge, a hacksaw, some wax, and a fuse. 

       1. Cut the very top of the CO2 off using the hacksaw.  Be sure
          to cut the part off that looks like a nipple.
       
       2. Next you must drill a small hole anywhere in the cylander. 
       (preferably the side)

       3. Insert any type of fuse into the hole.  Make sure that the wick 
          fits tightly into the metal.  If the wick is loosly set in the 
          metal, the bomb will not work properly.

       4. Now, fill the cylander to the top with gun powder. (BLACK
          POWDER) BE VERY CAREFULL!!

       5. OK...you are now ready for the final step. Get a candle or
          some type of wax.  Melt the wax, and let it cool for a couple
          of minutes.  When the wax is soft, pack it into the open end
          of the cartridge.  The wax should make a tight seal over the
          gunpowder.

       6.  When the wax is dried and hard, you bomb is ready to be lit!
           When yuo light the fuse, RUN LIKE ALL HELL!
           When the bomb explodes, it will be very load, and shrapnel from
           the metal cartridge will fly! So look out.

       Many other types if "PIG" bombs are easy to make.  Instead of using
       CO2 cartridges for the casing, you are able to use large peices of
       PVC piping.  The PVC piping should be waxed on both ends, end then
       wrapped tightly with stron tape.  Make sure the whole bomb is 
       tightly sealed.  I have seen this one blow a BBQ grill clean to 
       hell.  Another type of casing is a Propane tank! Yes... a propane
       tank!!  Wait until the tank is totally empty before drilling a hole
       in the side of the container.  Pack it with black powder, insert a
       LONG wick, seal the area around the LONG wick, and you are ready to 
       go.  This one is no joke.  It is capable of blowing down a 2 story 
       house.  

                             -=The First Power=-

        PS.......A giant SUBERBAN PROPANE tank will also do nicely!
                 If you decide to make this one, I will probably hear about
                 it on the 6:00 news!
