...I've been feeling old lately. I've reached that point in my life where all
these people I know are getting married. It is crazy. For the most part these
are natural steps...but it makes me feel old. I'm passing the age where people
are supposed to be getting married. Weird. I've still no plans for that kind
of life myself, and I keep thinking it is going to bother me at some point,
but if anything I feel relieved that I don't have any sort of plan for
settling down and getting on with life. I hope I can just keep going without
making any concrete decisions like that. I want to keep giving destiny the
finger every chance I get. gotta keep moving.
