Number 5 is in the houuuuuse!

Who's the bass-thumpinist, party rockinist, boots knockinist number around?
It's number Five up in the muthafuckin house!

Who's the number that won't cop out when there's danger all about?  Five?
Damn right.

While number Five may not be number one, it's still really fucking good.  It's
one of my favourites.  I can't think of a better number in the world.  What
other number can you double to create ten?  And speaking of ten, how many
times does ten factor into fifty?  In case you don't have the super-magnifico
mathematical skillz that I have, I'll tell you now that the answer is Five.

Number Five, always quick to step into a math problem at a moment's notice.
Sure it's only half of ten, but would you really want it to be all of ten?  In
my opinion, that would cause Five to lose all of its charm.  Ten is just so...
tenish, it's not really like Five at all.  I mean, the first difference is
that five is a prime number.  that means it's always primed and ready to kick
some science.  Ten is just so one-plus-zero-ish and let's face it, that zero
is deadweight.

Then there's Five.  Pure, simple, there's no secret about Five's intentions.
Five has nothing to hide.  Look at it, for crying out loud!  It looks like
it's smiling at you!

5

And even if it doesn't look like it's smiling, it would if it could!  So step
the fuck off, because Five is on the scene and there ain't no fuckin with
Five.
