Wow, I am bored and I thought I would write a GwD text file, 
since GREENY is my best friend(I am so privelged.)But I doubt 
any of y'all will see this since Seth and Lobo prolly think 
that this is stupid because I am writing yet another Quotes 
file...Besides, Quotes are all I can think of at the moment.

 me; only I can mediate between them. Without me mankind will sink 
 into the mire and vanity of *knowing*. Through me, you and they will
 find the only way out of chaos: *Understand by living*.

 nothing while I'm gone, but when I ask for sincerity, tell me where else 
 can I turn? Cause you're the one that I depend upon"
