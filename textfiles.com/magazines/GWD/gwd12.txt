FROM OUT OF NOWHERE
Tossed into my mind, stirring the calm
You splash me with beauty and pull me down
Cuz you come from out of nowhere (oh-whoa-oh)
My glance turns to a stare
Obsession rules me-I'm yours from the start
I know you see me-our eyes interlock
Cuz you come from out of nowhere (oh-whoa-oh)
My glance turns to a stare
One minute here and one minute there
Don't know if I'll laugh or cry
One minute here and one minute there
And then you wave goodbye...
Sitting to the bottom, everyday for two
All energy funnels, all becomes you
Cuz you come from out of nowhere (oh-whoa-oh)
My glance turns to a stare
One minute here and one minute there
Don't know if I'll laugh or cry
One minute here and one minute there
And it hurts inside
One minute here and one minute there
And then you wave goodbye
(goodbye)

EPIC
Can you feel it, see it, hear it today?
If you can't then it doesn't matter anyway
You will never understand it cuz it happens to fast
And it feels so good, it's like walking on glass
It's so cool, it's so hip, it's alright
It's so groovy, it's outta sight
You can touch it, smell it, taste it so sweet
But it makes no difference cuz it knocks you off your feet
You want it all but you can't have it
(yeah,yeah,yeah)
It's cryin', bleedin', a'lying on the floor
So you lay down on it and you do it some more
You've got to share it, so you dare it
Then you bear it and you tear it
You want it all but you can't have it
(yeah,yeah,yeah)
It's in your face but you can't grab it
(yeah,yeah,yeah)
It's alive, afraid, a lie, a sin
It's magic, it's tragic, it's a loss, it's a win
It's dark, it's moist, it's a bitter pain
It's sad it happened and it's a shame
You want it all but you can't have it
(yeah,yeah,yeah)
It's in your face but you can't grab it
(yeah,yeah,yeah)
What is it!?!
It's it
What is it?
It's it
What is it?
It's it
What is it?
It's it
(long musical interlude)
What--is--it?!?
It's it
What is it?
It's it
What is it?
It's it
You want it all but you can't have it
(yeah,yeah,yeah)
It's in your face but you can't grab it
(yeah,yeah,yeah)
It's it
What is it?
It's it
What is it?
It's it
What is it?
It's it
(yeah,yeah,yeah)
What is it?
It's it
(above two lines repeat 15 more times)

FALLING TO PIECES
Back and forth, I sway with the wind
Resolution slips away again
Right through my fingers, back into my heart
Where it's out of reach and it's in the dark
Sometimes I think I'm blind
Or I may be just paralyzed
Because the plot thickens everyday
And the pieces of my puzzle keep crumblin' away
But I know, there's a picture beneath
Indecision clouds my vision
No one listens
Because I'm somewhere in between
O' my love and my agony
You see, I'm somewhere in between
My life is falling to pieces
Somebody put me together
Layin' face down on the ground
My fingers in my ears to block the sound
My eyes shut'n tight to avoid the sight
Anticipating the end, losing the will to fight
Droplets of "yes" and "no"
In an ocean of "maybe"
From the bottom, it looks like a steep incline
From the top, another downhill slope o' mine
But I know, the equilibrium's there
Indecision clouds my vision
No one listens
Because I'm somewhere in between
O' my love and my agony
You see I'm somewhere in between
My life is falling to pieces
Somebody put me together
Back and forth I sway with the wind
Resolution slips away again
Right through my fingers, back into my heart
Where it's out of reach and it's in the dark
Sometimes I think I'm blind
Or I may be just paralyzed
Because the plot thickens everyday
And the pieces of my puzzle keep crumblin' away
But I know there's a picture beneath
Indecision clouds my vision
No one listens
Because I'm somewhere in between
O' my love my agony
You see I'm somewhere in between
My life is falling to pieces
Somebody put me together
In between
{(O' my love and my agony
You see I'm somewhere in between
My life is falling to pieces
Somebody put me together) repeated 3 times}

SURPRISE! YOU'RE DEAD!
Surprise! You're dead!
Ha ha ha! Open your eyes
See the world as it used to be when you used to be in it
When you were alive and when you were in love
And when I took it from you!
It's not over yet
You don't remember?
I won't let you forget
The hatred I bestowed
Upon your neck with a fatal blow
From my teeth and my tongue
I've drank and swallowed, but it's just begun
Now you are mine
I'll keep killing you until the end of time
Surprise! You're dead!
Guess what?
It never ends
The pain, the torment and torture, profanity
Nausea, suffering, perversion, calamity
You can't get away
It's not over yet
You don't remember?
I won't let you forget
The hatred I bestowed
Upon your neck with a fatal blow
From my teeth and my tongue
I've drank and swallowed, but it's just begun
Now you are mine
I'll keep killing you until the end of time
Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Surprise! You're dead!
Ah ha ha ha ha! Open your eyes
Surprise! You're dead!
Guess what?
It never ends
never ever ends!

ZOMBIE EATERS
You're everything
That's why I cling to you
When I emerge
My thoughts converge to you
To you
The world is so small
Compared to you
And everybody's wrong
Compared to you
To you
I begin to see through your eyes
All the former mysteries are no surprise
So now you listen
Cuz I'm omniscient
Hey look at me lady
Why I'm just a little baby
You're lucky to have me
I'm cute and sweet as candy
As charming as a fable
I'm innocent and disabled
So hug me and kiss me
Then wipe my butt and piss me
I hope you never leave
Cuz who would hear me scream?
Nobody understands
Except the toys in my hands
So now you listen
Cuz I'm omniscient
Hey look at me lady
I'm just a little baby
If I smile, then you smile
Then I'll get mad for awhile
I melt in your mouth
And in your hands whenever I can
But I really do nothing
Except kickin' and fussin'
I like to make a mess
I laugh at your distress
I sit all day in my crib
Absorbing all you give
I'm helpless
I'm flawless
I'm a machine
Give me!
I need my toys
WOW!
Keep me hot
Keep me strong
Keep me ever-everlong
Keep me hot
Keep me strong
Keep me ever-everlong
Keep me hot
Keep me strong
Keep me ever-everlong
Keep me hot
Keep me strong
Keep me ever-everlong
Keep me hot
Keep me strong
Keep me ever-everlong
So now you listen
Cuz I'm omniscient

EDGE OF THE WORLD
(snapping fingers)
Do do do do
Do do do do'n do do
Come here, my love
I'll tell you a secret
Come closer, now
I want you to believe it
I'll tell you all the things
You want to hear
Don't worry baby
There's nothing to fear
Hey, little girl
Would you like some candy?
Look into my eyes
I've seen it all
Hand in hand
Together we fall
We'll sing and dance
And we'll find romance
And we'll stroll to the edge of the world
Come sit right down
Lay your head on my shoulder
It's not the point
That I'm forty years older
You can trust me
I'm no criminal
But I'd kill my mother to be with you be with you be with you be with you
Sing and dance
And we'll find romance
And we'll stroll to the edge of the world
Give me a smile
Let me see those pearlies
I'll do an'thing
For the little girlies
(muffled kissing sound)
(Nah nah nah nah is repeated, and the song fades away)

THE REAL THING
I know the feeling
It is the real thing
The essence of the truth
The perfect moment
That golden moment
I know you feel it too
I know the feeling
It is the real thing
You can't refuse the embrace
No!
It's like the pattern below the skin
You gotta reach out and pull it all in
And you feel like you're too close
But you swallow another dose
The pinnacle of happiness
Filling up your soul
You don't think you can take any more
You never wanna let go
To touch the roots of experience
The most basic ingredients
To see the unseen glitter of life
And feel the dirt, grief, anger and strife
Cherish the certainty of now
It kills you a bit at a time
Cradle the inspiration
It will leave you writhing on the floor
This is so unreal, what I feel
This nourishment, life is bent
Into a shape I can hold
A twist of fate, all my own
Just grit your teeth and make no sound
Take a step away and look around
Just clench your fist and shut your eyes
Look deep inside, hypnotize
The whisper is but a shout
That's what it's all about
Yes, the ecstasy, you can pray
You will never let it slip away
Like the sacred song that someone sings through you
Through you
Like the flesh so warm that the thorn sticks into
Into
Like the dream you know one day will come to life
Life
Try to hold on just a little longer, longer
Stronger, stronger
It's the jewel of victory
The chasm of misery
And once you have bitten the core
You will always know the flavor
The split second of divinity
You drink up the sky
All of heaven is in your arms
You know the reason why
It's right there, all by itself
And what you are, there is nothing else
You're growing a life within a life
The lips of wonder kiss you inside
And when it's over the feeling remains
It all comes down to this
The smoke clears, I see what it is
That made me feel this way
I know the feeling
It is the real thing
The essence of the truth
The perfect moment
That golden moment
I know you feel it too
I know the feeling
It is the real thing
You can't refuse the embrace
This is so unreal, what I feel
Flood, sell your soul, feel the blood
Pump through your veins, can't explain
The element that's everything
Just clench your fist and close your eyes
Look deep inside, hypnotize
Yes the ecstasy, you can pray
You will never let it slip away
Yes the ecstasy, you can pray
You will never let it slip away
You will never let it slip away
You will never let it slip away
Like the echoes of your childhood laughter, ever after
Like the first time love urged you to take its guidance, in silence
Like your heartbeat when you realize you're dying, but you're trying
Like the way you cry for a happy ending
Ending, ending
(above line repeated a few times)
I know the feeling
It is the real thing
(above line repeated a few times, then fades)

UNDERWATER LOVE
Looking down into the water
It's hard to make out your face
If our love is drowning, then why
Do I feel so out of place?
Bubbling up to the surface
Are you getting a breath of fresh air?
Forever longing to make you mine
But I can't escape your stare
Liquid seeps into your lungs
But your eyes look so serene
It's wonderful how the surface ripples
But you're perfect and I cannot breathe
Forever longing to make you mine
But I can't escape your stare
Hold me closer, keep me near
My underwater love
Hold me closer, keep me near
I'll never get enough
Touch me from below
I'll never let you go
Touch me from below
I'll never let you go
Touch me from below
I'll never let you go
But I can't escape
Hold me closer, keep me near
My underwater love
Hold me closer, keep me near
I'll never get enough
Hold me closer, keep me near
My underwater love
Hold me closer, keep me near
I'll never get enough
Touch me from below
I'll never let you go
(above two lines are repeated, and gradually fade)

THE MORNING AFTER
Awakened by the sunlight
Victimized by last night
Memories flashin' through my head
Was I just born or am I dead?
Yesterday's forgotten, the morning after
I can taste you, I can hear your laughter
Fading in the distance
Recollections drifting
Bloodstains on my tattered clothes
Each minute the fear grows
If I could just lay down to rest
I'm tired of searching for myself
If I am dead, why can I feel such love?
If I am dead, why am I dreaming?
If I am dead, where do I go from here?
If I am dead, why does this pain feel so good?
Is this my blood dried upon my face?
Or is it the love of someone else?
It tastes so sweet, just like you used to
So rescue me my love, splice us together
I remember loving you so much
But where are you, and where's your fatal touch?
When I closed my eyes, was it my siesta?
Did I encounter a darkness stronger than sleep?
If I am dead, why can I feel such love?
If I am dead, why am I dreaming?
If I am dead, where do I go from here?
If I am dead, why does this pain feel so good?
I am thirsty for my sleep
There are no answers anyway

     There you have it.  The first part of the GwD Songbook.  How'd you like 
it?  If enough of you like it, there's more where that came from.  If enough 
of you don't like it there probably won't be any more lyrics files.  I chose 
Faith No More because they are an official band, and because they kick ass.  
The Real Thing is available on Slash Records, and I strongly suggest that you 
all get it.
