                       "When Not Working" by Kp Neato Dee

That's the deal man, when you're working a standard 9-5 job everyday, you gotta
get up early and dressed up probably, and then drive a ways home during rush
hour which takes a while so after yer finally home and gotten some food you're
too tired to do much else but sit around and watch tv 'till you fall asleep,
just to get up and do the same thing again the next day.

I had a 9-5 daily job one summer and it was amazing how tired I'd be everday
after work and not wanna do much of anything interesting.

Steady schedules are like that, kinda...it's probably better if you could work
at various times during the week?  

But man... if that's all you're doing, that's like subsistence-living and the
thought's freaking me out which is why it's a good idea to rob banks or 
something instead.

I mean, if your life is just 9-5 work and food and tv, which it could easily
be, then damn... that's pretty depressing.  

Maybe it's not, maybe it's dumb and naive to hope for anything more
interesting or something, I dunno.

I just read this rad 'zine called "Scam Punks" that I borrowed from Franken
Gibe.  It's like this big fat journal of this guy who's like 20 or so and lives
in Florida on his own with no job or real source of income.  He lives totally
hand-to-mouth, squats in abandoned buildings, hitchhikes when he needs to go 
someplace far away or hops a train, and otherwise just uses a bike when he's 
going short distances.  He hangs out with all these other homeless people in 
the city and plays in a band and seems like a happy guy.

Maybe there's a lot to that, hmm.
