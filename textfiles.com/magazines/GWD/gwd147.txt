this is gross, so feel free to skip it.  or comment about how it made you
vomit.  or whatever.

so i just got back from the bathroom.  when i got there, the two urinals were
occupied. "no big deal," i figured as i sauntered into one of the stalls.  i
was about to lift the seat, like a nice fellow, when i noticed that said seat
was bespeckled with a multitude of hairs. ass-hairs.  sure, it's not uncommon
to see an ass-hair or a stray pube on the toilet seat in a public bathroom;
that's what they make those seat covers for.  but it is rare to see a
multitude of ass-hairs on the same toilet seat.  whoever used the stall last
(hopefully just one person deposited these, since otherwise people would have
been sitting on each-other's ass-hairs, which would be quite disgusting)
apparently has a shedding problem.  disgusting as it was, i wish i'd had my
digital camera just so i could show all of you fine people what i'm talking
about.

anyway, i proceeded to lift the seat using my foot (just the bottom of it,
actually), as i was taught in elementary school, and take my leak.  i then
came back to my office, shaking my head, pondering the ass-hairs.
