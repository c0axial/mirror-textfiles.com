Abstract

This process details how one can mount a Microchip PIC Programmer in a custom
case. By performing this elaborate "mod", you too can have a super special DIY
box for your el-cheapo PIC programmer. No more loose wires or bare circuit
board sliding all over while you work on your high-tek project! Show your
prowess by building one for yourself!

Parts List

The following items will be required for those who wish to follow along at
home:

    * One P16PRO40 PIC programmer from DonTronics.
    * One box of Rice-a-Roni and an appetite
    * One SPDT panel mount toggle switch
    * 4 PCB standoffs + 8 screws
    * Soldering iron and solder
    * Exacto knife
    * Power drill
    * Clear packing tape
    * Adhesive backed rubber feet
    * Apathy and a generally bad attitude sure help!

Procedures

   1. Purchase the very cheap KIT96 programmer kit from Dontronics.
      Assemble/solder it yourself or get a parent to help. Stare at the
      completed circuit and wonder whether or not you will need those stupid
      parts mentioned in the addendum. Wonder why the genius designers put the
      power supply and parallel port connectors on opposite sides of the
      board.
   2. Use the kit for a few years. Regret the purchase. Get pissed because you
      should have bought a better programmer -- one that has better support
      for hardware in recent versions of MS operating systems. Take extra time
      to enjoy the tedium that is connecting and disconnecting the power
      supply every time you wish to burn code. Marvel at how easily the bare
      board slides around your work surface!
   3. Decide to mount the damn programmer in a box.
   4. Go to Wacky Willy's in search of a suitable container. Get pissed
      because they have nothing suitable. Assume that you can find one at...
   5. Radio Shack. Not. Get more pissed because their boxes are horribly
      misshapen and insanely overpriced. Scoff at the ridiculous displays of
      plastic consumer electronics crap. Go home depressed.
   6. Tear apart house looking for suitable container. Find nothing. Decide to
      eat some Rice-a-Roni to restore your strength. Any flavor may suffice,
      but the author highly recommends "Rice Pilaf". Yum. It should look
      something like this:

      <http://www.noisybox.net/electronics/ricepic/retailbox.gif>

      Cook the rice as directed on the packaging. Eat. Wash down with 8 or 12
      beers.
   7. Realize later that you were supposed to keep the Rice-a-Roni box. Fish
      it out of the trash.
   8. Use the exacto knife to cut the box apart. Your goal here is to make the
      cardboard rice box about the same size as the PIC programmer. Cut one of
      the sides off so that the top is open. Apply generous amounts of clear
      packing tape as required for support and that "high-gloss" look.
   9. Decide that you need a power switch. Try to find an empty area on the
      board where you could mount a switch. Get frustrated because there's
      not very much room. Decide to drill in the corner near the DB25
      connector. Come dangerously close to severing an important trace. Mount
      the switch.
  10. Cut one of the traces coming off the power connector in half. Solder a
      wire to each side. Solder the other ends of the wires to your newly
      mounted switch. Voila! Power switch. Complicated.
  11. Use the exacto knife and cut out holes in the cardboard for the DB25 and
      power connectors. The holes should be in the correct positions and cut
      to the "right" size. Just eyeball it.
  12. Mount the PCB standoffs to the underside of the PIC programmer board
      PCB. What's that? THE BOARD ONLY HAS 3 HOLES DRILLED? Yup. Again, poor
      design. I suppose you get what you paid for. You need 4 holes for
      stability...so drill the 4th hole yourself in the far corner. Again,
      it's best to come dangerously close to ruining those important, poorly
      placed traces. Depending on the size of screws being used, you may need
      to tap out the holes to make them bigger (I did).
  13. Unscrew the metal shield from the outside of the DB25 connector and
      place the board inside the box. Use the exacto knife to poke around and
      find the PCB standoffs on from the underside of the cardboard container.
      Once you find them, poke the exacto knife through and twist it around to
      make a little hole. Use the remaining 4 screws to secure the PCB to the
      bottom of the rice box. If your screws are long enough, it's probably a
      very good idea here to use some washers (I know from hindsight). After
      mounting, screw the metal shield back onto the DB25 connector from the
      outside.
  14. If you were smart, you have some rubber feet that are taller than the
      screws you used in the previous step. If you're like me, however, you'll
      soon discover that the screws are taller than the feet...making the feet
      useless. If you find yourself in this situation, you can either a) get
      shorter screws, b) get taller feet, or c) cuss loudly and decide that
      you "don't need those goddamn fucking feet anyway!" (my personal
      choice). If desired, push the rubber feet onto the bottom.
  15. That's it! Plug it in. Try it out. Enjoy!

Results

Your finished Rice-a-Roni PIC programmer should look something like this:

Frequently Asked Questions

    * Q: Are you affiliated with Rice-a-Roni or The Quaker Oats company?
      A: No. There is no direct connection.
    * Q: Are you an employee of Dontronics?
      A: Ha! No.
    * Q: Do you live in San Francisco?
      A: Nope. Wrong again!
    * Q: This is really stupid...why in the world would I want to do this?
      A: Good question! You probably don't want to do this...
    * Q: Ok, smart guy, then why did you do it?
      A: Because I'm cheap and can't really justify buying a new programmer.
    * Q: So I was trying to follow the steps you described here and [cut my
         hand with an exacto knife | shocked myself | broke my P16PRO40], what
         should I do?
      A: Seek immediate medical attention and stop trying to attempt
         everything you read about on the 'net.
    * Q: Is this a joke?
      A: Yes...well, um, no. I actually built this, but I certainly don't
         honestly promote it. Maybe I'm the joke...
