Dear Lobo,
     We believe that the acknowledgement of ourselves as citizens of the earth
is a concept in direct conflict with the 20th century western "philosophy" of
egotistical self-importance, which to a large degree precludes compassion for
others.  We think this same premise inhibits our ability to look beyond the
familiar boundaries of reality to which we cling so desperately.  By even
acknowledging the reported accounts of  human-alien interaction as possible, it
must be considered how closely these events mirror man's own treatment of other
members of the world's community, as well as the planet itself.  We believe that
the alien phenomena is yet another wake up call to our own humanity.

     "The inescapable profundity of the alien presence has become a source of
social pathology in our time.  As a culture, we have not yet learned how to tell
the truth about something so huge, so strange, and so unexpected.  Individuals
who make an honest effort to deal with it often discover that their personal
stability is at risk.  Consequently, the alien presence requires us all to grow,
to become stronger and clearer, and to help one another to find our way in a
genuinely new world."
     -Michael Lindemann  (futurist, author, and UFO investigator)

     We ask you to consider posting the following announcement (with or without
the preceding paragraphs) in your zine, GwD.  Although this information may not
seem to apply directly to the subject matter of your zine, we believe that it
does, as the alien phenomena personifies the moral, ethical and spiritual
struggles of the 20th century which impact us all.  Please allow us to supply
your readers with free stickers and info.  If you would like to see the
stickers and info please e-mail me your snail mail address and I would be happy

image.)

Thanks for your consideration, K2.

                                --------------

You know, I was taking photographs of my 2 year old neighbor's genitalia with
my polaroid the other day, and I dropped my crack pipe on my insider trader's 
stock report.  It burst into flames, and as I pulled my penis out of my 
sister's buttocks, I noticed that the BATF was kicking in my front door.  I 
picked up my AR-15 which my militia neighbor had converted into a fully
automatic weapon, and opened fire on the bastards, killing the spotted owls 
and bald eagles I had caged in front of my front door.  I ran out the back 
door and jumped in my 72 impala I had cut the exhaust pipes off of, and while 
running red lights on the way out of town, I fished my bottle of jack and my 
saturday night special out from under the front seat and got loaded.  
Tearing down the sidewalk, I was hitting baby carriages and giving spontaneous
abortions to slow moving minorities as I worshiped my little plastic Satan
figurine on the dashboard.  I lit my cigar with my tenth I.R.S. notice of 
impending action, and decided that it was about time I headed back to D.C., as
the vote on that abortion bill was coming up, and if I missed it, I couldn't 
go whoring in the Philippines this summer with my constituents.

God Bless America!
