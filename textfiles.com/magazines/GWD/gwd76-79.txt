                        Yustas Kotz-Gottlieb  gives  us
                        this insightful review of a new
                        painting  by  the  artist  Paul
                        Jaisini.  Jaisini's work evokes
                        a great many emotions,  and Mr.
                        Kotz-Gottlieb explores them all
                        in this interesting review.   A
                        must  read for  any  fan of the
                        arts.

                        Yancey  Slide  recently spent a
                        semester  in  St.   Petersburg,
                        Russia.  Here is his story from
                        his own  point of view  (such a
                        novel concept).  An interesting
                        look  at  life  in  the  former
                        communist  country that  is now
                        struggling  to  find  its  true
                        calling  (somewhat  like  GwD).
                        Of course, passages relating to
                        GwD Covert Ops  in this country
                        that is now "our friend."   You
                        will read this,  and  you  will
                        like it, or  Lenin's  styrofoam
                        corpse will  kill  you.  Part 3
                        is on its way, soon...

                        Erotica?  Sort of.   This piece
                        shows us  that  although  Grene
                        enjoys  nudity,  sex, and porn,
                        she only  likes  it when  these
                        are  voluntary.   That's right,
                        Grene hates  rapists.  Here's a
                        look (sort of) at what she does
                        to them.  An interesting piece
                        with a  Celtic  twist.   That's
                        right,  GwD  has  now jumped on
                        the "everything Celtic is cool"
                        bandwagon.

-> HEADLINES <-

GwD ROCKS BALLS.

It's true.  We do indeed rock major nads, moreso than any other pseudo-
religious/quasi-political textfile group.  Listen up, you played out playa.  If
you want this, you gotta give me some more.

These files are being released on 05-25-00.  This date, of course, rocks more
balls than GwD (though only slightly).  Why?  Well, it's 5-25, the perfect day,
(perfect because it's got three 5s in it:  5-(5*5).  WIGGEDY WIGGEDY WORD WORD
WORD.  And the year is 00, the perfect year, because (unlike other years such
as "99") it doesn't corrupt the perfectness of 5-25.  That's why, you little
sluts, that's why.

-> OTHER NEWS <-

GwDwarez are now (or soon will be) available on the GwDweb site at
www.GREENY.org.  We're serious this time.  Really.  We've said it before, and
we'll probably say it again, but ONE DAY, they will make it onto the website.

If you don't remember GwDwarez, then you're quite lucky, as they suck major ass.
They're fine examples of shitty programming (for the most part; the ones by Bill
Hooper are kind of cool).  This is why the GwDwarez project was put on hiatus in
1997.  The only reason they are going to be re-released now is for our groupies,
the little girls in the cute school uniforms who just *HAVE TO* collect
everything the GwD name has ever graced.  Yup, that's right.  We're hunting them
down and making them available again just for YOU, cuz you my bestest most
bitch.

Also, I'd like to point out that YOU are a CHACH.

-> SUBMISSION INFORMATION <-

If you have ANYTHING to submit to GwD (artwork, text, outlandish claims, etc.),
DO NOT HESITATE to send it our way.  "submit@GREENY.org" is there for you, baby.
Work must be 100% original and it must be understood that once submitted,
articles/artwork/photographs become the property of GwD, Inc. (unless they have
been previously published elsewhere) and we can use them however we see fit,
even if it's merely to make fun of them (and you).

-> LETTERS TO THE EDITOR <-

[All spelling/grammar errors are those of the author(s) and are not errors on
the part of GwD, cuz, well, we're perfect.  Yeah.]
