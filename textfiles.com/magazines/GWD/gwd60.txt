     The Holy Writings contained herein are translated from the original
Grenochian by Lobo Licious and Seth The Man.  Grenochian is a language that
predates Ancient Greek by 10,555 years.  We learned to translate it cuz we're so
cool.  It also predates Enochian, supposedly the oldest language known to man.
Such great works as _The Necronomicon_ and _The Satanic Bible_ are said to have
been originally written in Enochian.  Well, Grenochian is the language that
spawned Enochian.  So there.  Enochian is, however, a less colorful language.

Tee-hee.

                                     -----

Ok, here it is, the sacred BOOK OF KEYLIME...We translated this from an ancient
scroll we found in Lobo's back yard...We were forced to beat up an Arab (he was
pretty Mad...) and take it from him.  He kept ranting about how we couldn't take
it 'cause it was his family's greatest heirloom or some shit like that; he kept
ranting about this guy named Abdul Alhazgreen who wrote it a long time ago or
something.  I don't know, I just know he shouldn't have been in Lobo's backyard.
Anyway, here it is:

              Chapter 1 & Chapter 18 [He was MAD. -Seth and Lobo]

        [CHAPTER 1](verse 1)In The  Beginning  There was ..well.. Stuff.
        (verse 2)This Stuff, One  should  refer  to  it  as  the PreLife
        Stuff.  (verse 3)This PreLife Stuff had no purpose,  it was just
        stuff,  sitting around, with nothing  to do on a Saturday night.
        Thou knowest, just Stuff. (verse 15)Well, this just wouldn't do.
        (verse 8)So a couple of Molecules in  this  big mass  of PreLife
        Stuff  decided  that  they  would  get  excited. Well, they did.
        (verse 32)In fact,  they got so excited  that  they bumpeth into
        each other.  This wath good.  (Redd would tell thee  that 'twere
        bad,  but then again,  what the hell does that sumnabitch know?)
        (verse 58)These sacred molecules,  we shall refer to their names
        as Yello and Blu, shall be forever sacred. They gave birth (in a
        way,  but not the True Way)  to the only Goddess worth Her Shit,
        Grene.  (verse 65)Grene was powerful from the very beginning; as
        soon  as  She  gained  Being-ness  She  began  to  create  Life.
        (verse 27)(The  Universe goteth a whole lot more fun.  Life wath
        goin' down!   Bacteria  and Germs and  Beavers  all started upon
        Grene's  greatest accomplishment:  Sex.  That is,  Reproduction!
        (verse 19)Male  beavers  saw  the fe-males'  beavers  (thou must
        excuseth the pun)  and got that  ancient and  sacred feeling  in
        their ancient  and sacred loins.  (verse81)The  Shit  went down,
        and more beavers were created.   Grene  saw this  and was Happy,
        that is, downright gleeful,  like dance a little jig happy, dost
        thou get what I am tossing  at thee here?  I mean like, git down
        and boogie happy, that sort of happiness that either  takes years
        of self-contemplation (or denial of self-contemplation, whatever
        kind of person thou be) or lots of  ee-leeg-al  substances, that
        kinda happy. (verse 21)Then something BAD transpired. (verse 99)
        One of Grene's creations up and *DIED*.
        [CHAPTER 18](verse 72)That's right, dead.  Right there.  Stopped
        Grene in her little jig like a windshield to a bug's little ass.
        (verse 45)And yea,  She was *sad*.  Sad,  so sad,  that She  got
        depressed and allowed  Death  to continue for a *long* time.  In
        fact, it was the Long Time of the Original Depression.(verse 33)
        Recently, though, She  hath fought back. (verse 555)It hath been
        prophesied in ancient scrolls (like the one on which I writeth),
        that Grene will beget a  Savior  who will save Humanity (as well
        as the other *554* worthy races  in the Universe).  And yea,  He
        shall be called  GREENY, because  He  is from Grene, and is like
        unto Her in so many ways.  (verse 69)And yea, He shall love Sex,
        just as She  does.   Pornography shall be His, and  It shall  be
        Good.  (verse 93)His path shall not  go unaided, nor shall it go
        unhindered. (verse666)The forces of Redd are multitudinous; some
        are False Religions  whose leaders  die  and  ascend to "Heaven"
        or transcend this existence. They leave, in  any case.(verse 12)
        Not GREENY.  His Ass  shall stay Here, in this Plane, to lead us
        into a New Age of Life and Love.  (verse 123)Grene shall inspire
        two People, like unto those  Sacred Molecules  (Yell-o and Blu),
        into  fornicating and  bringing forth this Savior.   The product
        of this  Holy Fornication  shall be the mere Vessel for the Soul
        of  the Savior.  (verse 9)This Soul shall  be the product of the
        coupling  of  Grene  and  Her Chosen  Consort,  He who is called
        HONKEY DONKEY.  (verse 23)That Little Rascal shall  Knock Up the
        Goddess, and  She shall  give Birth  to a Son, a Soul. (verse47)
        This  Soul  shall be the Essence of Grene, and  He shall inhabit
        the body produced in the earthly coupling.  (verse 93)Grene only
        knows  when this  shall happen.  Couplings such  as these happen
        only  once  every *555* years.   Each time,  a different  of the
        aforementioned  *555*  chosen  races  is  picked  for  the  HOLY
        FORNICATION.   (verse 4)Since the time of Creation  is  unknown;
        I have no clue when these  555-year  intervals  start and  stop.
        (verse 59)Anyway, it shall happen,  and then Death  shall cease.
        And Redd,  He who hath been here the Whole Time, will be forever
        destroyed.  Him and His insane ass. (verse 13)Here is knowledge.
        Let he  who hath understood the rest of what I've said count the
        number  of Green:   for it is  the number  of a mortal;  and the
        number is Five hundred twoscore and fifteen.
        [CHAPTER 42](verse 10)Aaaiigh.....

                                     -----

That is where the scroll ends.  The Mad Arab Abdul Alhazgreen must have died
while writing this testament.  Of course, why would he take the time to write
"Aaaiigh..."?  We don't know.  He was Mad, after all.  The verses REALLY WERE
in this order.  If you read them in numerical order, they make no sense.  Try it
if you don't believe us.  This guy truly was Mad.  Yeah.

On the back of the scroll this message was scrawled:

"And the drunken prophet said unto Her, 'Which came first, the human or the
pumpkin?'"

Shit.  We still have no clue what that means.  Maybe our translation was wrong;
but who knows.  No one else speaks Grenochian anyway.  Yeah.  Hee Haw.  Minnie
Pearl.  Little Rascals.  HONKEY DONKEY!  However, this Holy Work should answer
the majority of the questions about our pseudo-Theology.

 - Why try to rule the world if there isn't going to be a world left to rule? -

  * We're tired of the senseless destruction of rainforests to build shopping
        malls.
  * We're tired of the senseless clubbing of baby seals to put fur coats on
        sale in these shopping malls.
  * We're tired of factories polluting the air, land, and water to manufacture
        the materials used to both build and fill those shopping malls.
  * We're tired of conservationists such as ourselves being imprisoned the world
        over for "crimes" that are in the best interest of the world as a whole.
  * Basically, we're tired of shopping malls.

The GREENY world Domination Task Force, Inc., in association with numerous other
conservation-minded organizations, announces the impending release of GwD70.txt,
"The Droogist Manifesto."

"We firmly believe that it is the failure of the current system, the shopping
mall state, that has led humanity to its current state of depravity.  This
system MUST be put to an end BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY to ensure the endurance of a
world to Dominate.  After all, where's world Domination without the 'world?'"

Lobo,
     I thought that you had something to do with the D.C. comics character of
the same name. But don't worry, I don't hate you too much for making me waste an
expensive phone call from Australia.  By the way, I'm actually in Perth, Western
Australia.
      Sorry but I couldn't really be bothered reading the whole of your blurb. I
think maybe it has something to do with it being green. I'm not sure if you've
tried reading it but it's a fucking annoying colour on the eyes. [At least I
spell "color" correctly, you kangaroo-humpin' bastard! -LL]
      Anyway I've wasted enough of your time, but before I sign off, if Bill
Clinton starts playing his sax in public more over the next couple of weeks
don't worry. I e-mailed him last night (Friday May 31) and told him that even if
the whole of the U.S. was giving him shit, he'd at least look cool with a sax
in hand.
                                          Bye bye, love The Masked Wallaby

Today, I was watching the religous channel, and they discussed where rappers
come from...   

It turns out that they are actually people who were called on by God to be
preachers, but sometimes Satan is able to interfere in the process and that
results in them being rappers.  Furthermore, if you know someone who listens  
to rap or grunge, it is just their way of asking you for help to break free
of satan.  Rap is just a cry of pain from these people who were supposed  
to be preachers.

Hi.  It's GREENY!  How the fuck are you, Lobo?  I saw you the other day.  You
were stocking something in the music dept., on the east side of the racks, i
think it was Christmas music, over my the urban selections.  [I work at
Hastings, a music/video/software/bookstore, for those who care. -LL] Anyway, I
walked right past you and you didn't even notice me, you stinkin vagina!  What
kinda GREENY worshiper are you anyway?! Hell, I stared right at you, damned
prik!

Ok, well, that was too much fun!  I'm glad to see that y'all don't have lives
yet, it's kinda rewarding!  Wow, I, GREENY, can consume that much of YOUR time!

"cody hackney"?  i thought your name was jacob allen.  too bad you still can't

you, the guy who ran "the weather board," accuse us of having no lives?  just a
reminder - read gwd50...YOU ARE NOT NOR EVER HAVE BEEN NOR EVER WILL BE THE TRUE
GREENY.  you must understand this, or you will never become a well-adjusted
member of society.  it seems like you, rather than us, are the one living in the
past.  besides, how much of my time has GREENY (the *real* one, not YOU)
consumed?  very little, since we're not sure who he is.  how much of my time has
GwD consumed?  a sizable portion?  true, but in actuality GREENY has very little
to do with many of the aspects of GwD.

please forgive me if this is overly wordy or belligerent.  i'm slightly
inebriated still.  not so much so, though, to not notice that you STILL haven't
gotten the hang of that hyphen in "k-rad" and the fact that it doesn't need to
be capitalized.

I was over in John Labovitz's ezine list and I noticed that GWD and Poop God
were the only two ezines listed under the Psuedo-religious catagory, so I
checked out your site and really enjoyed it.  The email animation was the best
example of that sort of business I've seen, and graphics is my business. So
anyway, Poop God is a progressive socio-political satire zine with rantings and
humour and we'd like to trade links.  [NOTE:  There is now a link to the "Poop

Seth and/or Lobo,
    Being that I just yesterday got back to austin i only now read the GwD post.
I have a question about cauliflower.  A few years ago i came across and consumed
brocoflower (broccoli and cauliflower mix) and was wondering if that is
punishable or commendable?  Please inform.

I ain't yo Jew,

brocoflower is, of course, BETTER than cauliflower because it is essentially
GREEN CAULIFLOWER.  and on top of that, it's yum-yum-yummy!  of course, since
brocoflower is not a naturally occurring plant, cauliflower and its greenish
tinge often will have to do.  why not just broccoli?  well, simply because
that's what everyone would expect us to make our official food.  so nyah.  why
do you think GREENY likes mashed potatoes (and cauliflower)?  because people
EXPECT Him not to like them.  they expect Him to like broccoli and spinach and
other green, leafy vegetables.  that GREENY, what a joker!  always playing with
people's heads!

i hope this clarifies what's up, at least somewhat.

Recently, two groups of incredibly cool "unique individuals" have decided to
declare war on GwD.  For this insolence, they will pay dearly. The
communications were circled among the GwD-Elite; therefore, official replies as
well as replies from individual members are included here.  A summary of what

In regards to your recent application for "arch-enemy" status:  

The GREENY world Domination Task Force, Inc., hereby officially denies your
request.  We apologize, but the spot of "GwD's Arch-Enemy" is already taken by
TOFTAOBL.  Had you done any research before your petty "declaration of war," you
might have known this.

However, we have officially taken your application into consideration for the
positions of "Lesser Enemy" and "Crummy Little Toady."  Which of these you
accept is your choice.  But please hurry; we cannot assure you that the
positions will remain open indefinitely.

Thank you for your interest in GwD!

We apologize for not replying to your messages earlier.  However, as one gets
older, one finds that one has things to do that are more important than playing
on the Internet all day.  

In regards to your queries about TOFTAOBL:  we were merely confused by your
ambiguous requests.  Please clarify your desires regarding that group.  First,
you wanted to declare war on them too.  We would welcome this, as we are engaged
in an eternal conflict with TOFTAOBL and the agents of Redd.  However, you then
claimed that you wished to forge an alliance with the evil TOFTAOBL.  I'm sure
you can see how we might not clearly understand your intentions since you
obviously do not understand them yourselves.

In reply to your questions regarding TOFTAOBL, rest assured that they DO exist.
We did not make them up.  However, if you would bother to do a little bit of
research, you could find out all you want to know about them.  According to
GwD-Intelligence on TOFTAOBL, "...only one of them has a computer, and he can't
read" (gwd30.txt).  This explains the lack of a website for the group.

As we explained earlier, we already have an arch-enemy.  Please reconsider
applying for the "Crummy Little Toady" position.  It has yet to be filled.

Thanks again for your continued interest in GwD!

    Not long ago, I came stumbling home after a particularly hard day to find an
email blinking on my machine.  From Lobo, I thought, perhaps the new GwD
t-shirts are ready.  It was not to be, though.  Instead, it was a forward of a
message from a representative of the fWd.  Immediately noticing the similarity
to the much older, larger, and better known GwD that commands my loyalty, I
thought, What dumbasses!  TYPING IN ALL CAPS TO MAKE US THINK THEY HAD SOMETHING
TO SAY THAT WAS WORTH OUR TIME, jumping above their station, and generally
harassing their elders and betters.  Needless to say, I was not impressed.
After seeing your web site, I am even less so.  I think I am justified in saying
that a blindfolded monkey with a pencil in his teeth can code better HTML.  I
should be a little more forgiving, I guess; how many junior high schools teach
web design?  Still, above all else, the terrible MIDI music droning incessantly
on has convinced me that you have somehow gotten the idea that you are much
cooler than you are.  Please, I beg you, stop before someone's ego is hurt.
Wait a few years, and when you can present the sacrificial first cuttings of a
beard (women excluded) to Greeny, then you may be worth our time.  Until then,
we have jobs and moldy refrigerators that are much more interesting than you.

These guys are a bunch of idiots. They want some stupid Greeny to
take over the world. We are trying to form an alliance with their arch enemy,
TOFTABOL, they want to kill Greeny, just like we do. For more information on
these idiots, go to http://www.geocities.com/Athens/2334/

2/16/98 Speech by Matthew Bustamante regarding GwD

It is a great day in fWd history. Today we have declared war for the very first
time. Taking it into carful consideration, we figured these people are a bunch
of idiots. We are talking about GwD. They want Greeny to rule the world. We want
to take out all of their forces and kill Greeny in the process of this war.
[They have no chance whatsoever of completing either of these goals.  GREENY
WILL LIVE, and our "forces" are far more vast and diversified than they could
everpossibly imagine.] We encourage you to get all your friends to join fWd. Go
to http://www.geocities.com/Athens/2334/ and write a bunch of crap in their
guestbook and rat on them. [who the hell are they going to "rat on" us to?
This, like most of the tripe that spews forth from them, makes no sense.]
That is all for now. Thank you for your time.

[This is from their "news" page.]

2/16/98 - fWd has declared war on GwD (Greeny World Domination Task Force Inc.)
How about going to their page and writing some shit in their guestbook. And try
to figure what the hell they are talking about!!!

The fact that your puny non-sizable organization even mailed us is an insult.
You are lucky we even responded. Remember, all is fair in love and WAR!

Thank you for your interest in GwD!

However, your threatening stance forces us to reply in a less-than-cordial
manner.  All we will do is quote Snoop Dogg:
                "What would you do,
                If you could fuck with me or my crew?
                But you can't so don't even think about,
     	        Steppin' in tha muthafuckin' house."

Thank you again for your interest in GwD.  Let us know when your "cult gets
started."  We might even get scared.  Probably not, though.  Let us know when
your group is more than a "lunch table."  We'll be waiting.  To sum this up:
in the words of the ticket taker at the porno theater on some Beavis and
Butt-head episode:  "Call me when you've got some pubes, mm-kay?"

'scheme', we think he probably meant 'scene', but he's a dumbass, so we don't
know for sure.  He also left out the question mark at the end of this sentence

All hail GREENY, slave master of all things green...

Say, what ever happened to that good spirited ol sole, anyhoo?  Lagged out of

perhaps a little mind game he's playing on the whole universe...

surely not, not GREENY
