In 1996 GwD plans to reinstitute its monthly gathering policy.  Here are *very*
tentative plans for gatherings and dates if they're known.  Other dates will be
set closer to the actual time.

January - Beginning of spring semester party thing.
February 14 - Valentine's Day.  Redd's Holiday.  Get together and boycott it.
March - Spring Break.  Week long party.  Heh.  Miniature golf one night, really.
April - Venture out to the S00PER-D00PER store(s), K-Mart and/or Wal-Mart.
May - End of school.  Celebration of graduation and penetration.  Yeah.
June - Go out for pizza.  A classic GwD get-together.
July - Hellraiser marathon.  The ORIGINAL GwD GATHERING.  A must for all droogs.
August - End of summer party-thing.  Yay.
September - Star Wars marathon.  Another classic.
October 31 - Halloween.  Trick-or-treat-ing?  Talk to Lobo.
November - Thanksgiving.  Get together and thank Grene for k-neat stuff.
December - Xmas Fest! (Also go to HoHoCon, if you can, if there is one.)

(All dates and "themes" subject to change without notice, though we'll probably
let you know cuz you're so damn special.)

These dates are really tentative, except the first one.  (It's not tentative for
obvious reasons.)  Question marks signify that we don't know exactly which files
will be out when.  Yeah.

                11-4-95                         ???????? (GwD Election Special)
                12-31-96 or 1-1-97              gwd&1997.txt, ???????

Another note about releases:  there will be no releases if there aren't
submissions.  That isn't to say that GwD will die (it won't).  It's just that
I never again want to release files like 24-29 that I'm not especially proud of
that were written just to have files.  Please submit, even if it's crap.  I most
likely won't publish it if it's crap, but submit it anyway.  No song lyrics
(that was a dumbass idea of mine) or stupid transcriptions of comedy acts (thank
Grene I never was desperate enough to publish THAT submission).  Poetry is
accepted, but only if it's really good.  Yeah.  Ain't I a bitch?  Thanks in
advance for any submissions.

"Here is knowledge.  Let he who hath understood the rest of what I've said count
 the number of Green:  for it is the number of a mortal; and the number is Five
                  hundred twoscore and fifteen." - KeyLime 18:13.
