Have you never heard of Mongo Jones?

Mongo Jones was born in late 1997.  His actual birthdate is unknown, as is his
actual place of residence.  He is somewhat of a distributed entity.  Though
only five years old, he is already 4'11" and encroaching on a deuce and a half
(250 pounds for you stupid fucks).  You may say to yourself, "How could this
be?  A child of only 5 years weighing so much.  Who were the parents?  What
the fuck is going on?  Child abuse!"

To see who the parents are, perhaps you should look in the mirror while
comparing your once-willowy figure to an old High School yearbook.  The
"Freshman 15" inadequately describes the horrors of post-high school obesity.

Yes, my friends, Mongo Jones is YOU.  And me.  And all the others who have
packed on the pounds since the glory days.  While individually, we may call
our fattishness by special names like "Lionel" (Lobo Licious's gut), "Nigel"
(Ciacco the Hog's girth) or "Gaylord" (j3ph's belly), collectively, they are
known as the infamous Mongo Jones.  We have found through careful study that,
despite the fact that most of us have graduated from college, Mongo continues
to grow at an exponential rate.  By the time we reach 30, Mongo Jones will be
unstoppable.  Or we'll all be morbidly obese.  Perhaps our high school reunion
will be held at the Fat Farm.

Contributors to Mongo Jones (approximate weight gain - may vary day to day)

Look around at your friends from High School, and observe the protruding guts.

While you may not have contributed to Mongo Jones, you have most likely
contributed to one of the following entities:  Girthy Sam, Tubby Smith, Fatty
Lumpkin, Bulbous Bill, or Hey-Hey-Fat Sarah.

The fattishness must be stopped.  Or not.

We'd write more, but Mongo Jones needs to eat.
