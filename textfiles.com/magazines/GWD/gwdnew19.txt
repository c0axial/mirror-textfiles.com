gwd121.txt - "Mein Jewlatto" by Ciacco the Hog and Bob the Master of the World
             This is one of the most racist textfiles ever.  But damn, is it
             ever funny.

gwd122.txt - "Geekified Hovel" by Seth The Man
             Jesus Christ, Seth is a geek.  Computers galore, unnecessary
             surveillance, and hidden porn.

gwd123.txt - "Me and Mongo Jones" by Ciacco the Hog, Lobo Licious, and Bob the
             Master of the World
             Fattishness at its best.  Mongo Jones is indeed a force to be
             reckoned with.

gwd124.txt - "Sex without Strings:  A Call for Legalized Prostitution"
             by Dr. Dr. Otis
             Dr. Dr. Otis is at it again!  The alcoholic professor returns
             with his newest political treatise.  Legalize prostitution, yo.
AND...

gwd125.txt - "As You Go" by Trish
             We're all about the sentimentality...STM's sister lends us this
             tear-jerking poem in which she refers to her brother's blackness
             and our very own urge for Domination.

OUR HASHISHIM WARRIOR, THE LIZARD KING, HAS RETURNED TO US!  HOLY FUCK!!

After years of wandering on a Hashishim quest, TLK has returned.  What did he
find?  Mostly, hashish.  We welcome him back into the dr00gist fold.  Yee-haw!

CONVINCING PROOF FOUND OF SETH THE MAN'S FORMER FEMININITY!

Remember when Seth The Man was known as Seth Sometimes?  Well, even if you
don't, he was once known by that ridiculous moniker.  It, of course, referred
to the fact that he was sometimes a man and sometimes not.  New evidence
recently came to light that proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that he was
once a little girl.  Yes, while going through some of his 'old junk,' Seth
found a girls' soccer trophy.  Thus, he was once a little girl.

Coincidentally, he was also once a large black man.  Therefore, he seems to be
some odd sort of shapeshifter.  Scary scary!

-> OTHER NEWS <-

Ciacco the Hog finally wrote something for GwD.  It's about time we put that
art-boy to work.

Our status as the unOFFICIAL STAR WARS E-ZINE has allowed us to uncover the
true nature of one of our members and his gut.  That's right, Lobo "Booty"
Licious is actually a Dark Lord of the Sith.  Darth Licious's gut, Lionel, is
his young Padawan Learner.  Darths Licious and Lionel rock serious Sith-nads.

Otis recently completed two doctoral degrees.  Yes, he now holds a Ph.D in
engineering as well as one in philosophy.  He has accepted a faculty position
at a prestigious institution in New England.  From now on, he will be
addressed as Dr. Dr. Otis.  He plans to also attend medical school while he
teaches, so one day he will be Dr. Dr. Otis, M.D.
