                        This  here  is  the  Old School

                        Hell,  beatch.  That's right...
                        every  one  of  these files was
                        written back in da day. Most of
                        dem wuz written around '92-'95.
                        Ol' school files from GwD...all
                        for you,  you punk mutha-fucka.
                        Fine, #68 wuz writ in  the 9-8,
                        foo',  but dat shit  still be a
                        year  old.  And  we  don't know
                        when  #73  was  writ,  but it's
                        about  da  1970s,  so it's  ol'
                        skool enough. 'Course ** #69 **
                        really ain't that  old neither,
                        but it's  hard-effin'-core,  so
                        step your punk-ass to the curb.

                        Why  Old  School  shiznit?  Why

                        Otis tells his tale of  drunken
                        debauchery  at  a  "gentleman's
                        club."   Priest  fills  in  the
                        details that are sketchy due to
                        Otis' intoxication.  A shocking
                        look at the affects of alcohol,
                        exotic dancing,  and optometry.
                        Read it now, or suffer the fate
                        of Otis.  Okay, fine,  he's not
                        dead or anything.   But read it
                        anyway, PIGGIE.

                        name,  this file was an obvious
                        choice for #69.  daphne, a real
                        life sex slave,  tells the true

                        are easily offended.   Also, if
                        you have a heart condition, you
                        probably should not read it. Be

                        was  originally a g-file on his

                        lease it,  so here it is.   cDc

-> HEADLINES <-

This issue of GwDNews marks a momentous occasion:  our primary publication has
reached issue #75.  We are Gods among men.

-> OTHER NEWS <-

A zip file of all the crap we've ever released has been added to the GwD
Publications WebSite, to make it easier for you to download our drivel all at
once and then enjoy it on your own time in the privacy of your own home.  Be
sure to keep the tissues handy, you dirty hooker.

GwD was added to the "magazines" directory on "textfiles.com".  Go to:

http://www.textfiles.com/

and check our stuff out, if you think you're too good for the GwD Publications
site (which you're not, btw).  Or check it out anyway.  It's a pretty cool site.

GwDwarez are now (or soon will be) available on the GwDweb site at
www.GREENY.org.  If you don't remember GwDwarez, then you're quite lucky, as
they suck major ass.  They're fine examples of shitty programming.  This is why
the GwDwarez project was put on hiatus in 1997.  The only reason they are going
to be re-released now is for our groupies, the little girls in the cute school
uniforms who just *HAVE TO* collect everything the GwD name has ever graced.
Yup, that's right.  We're hunting them down and making them available again just
for YOU, cuz you my bestest most bitch.

The group as a whole is pretty inactive right now, due to covert ops in which
many dr00gs and dr00gettes are currently involved.  The ops, of course, count as
"news," but they're classified.  For now.

-> SUBMISSION INFORMATION <-

If you have ANYTHING to submit to GwD (artwork, text, outlandish claims, etc.),
DO NOT HESITATE to send it our way.  "submit@GREENY.org" is there for you, baby.
Work must be 100% original and it must be understood that once submitted,
articles/artwork/photographs become the property of GwD, Inc. (unless they have
been previously published elsewhere) and we can use them however we see fit,
even if it's merely to make fun of them (and you).

-> LETTERS TO THE EDITOR <-

[All spelling/grammar errors are those of the author(s) and are not errors on
the part of GwD, cuz, well, we're perfect.  Yeah.]
