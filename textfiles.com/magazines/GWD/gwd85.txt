 -+- "Why I Hate Poetry" -+-

I get nervous hearing bad poetry, I was literally squirming in my chair [when
watching a poetry reading] and yelling at the TV, "He said 'harlequin'!  That
pretentious little shit said 'harlequin'!  Put away your damn thesaurus!"

I was watching it over at Franken Gibe's and he said, "I want a new peer group."

What a rad comment.

That's the problem with poetry, and stuff that people decide to group as "high
culture" in general, is that it gets lotsa extra things stuck on it.  Like 
people try to dress up a simple concept like, "I dug this chick but then she
split, so now I'm sad," with a buncha cliche'd images about beaches and sunsets
and big words that you only use for the SAT.  'Cause they think that's the way
it's supposed to be done.

Or insisting on making things connected to this retro '60s thing, or worse, a
beatnik '50s thing like 10 or 20 years before you were even born.  And then
people are always getting some romanticized notion about "the good old days" 
and this retro business is just the same old shit.  

There's some thing really messed up about being barely 20 and wishing
desperately you'd been born earlier 'cause some movie or magazines say it was
like denial or something.  It's 2000, rip off the past, drop bombs in the
future, say what you mean, check yerself before you wreck yerself, blah blah 
blah now let's get out there and win one for the gipper.
