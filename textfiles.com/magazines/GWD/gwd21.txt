                                    "What"
                                  by fastjack

        The sun rose warmly in the East, but still he felt cold, knowing
that the house was empty and the life that had filled it was gone.
        Voices of the past roared through his mind.  Images and feelings and
thousands of other sensory impressions shoved and fought for dominance inside
of his mind.  Each tried to be the first to leap out and make itself a coherent
thought, but none could gain dominance; therefore everything remained a jumble.
Too numb to think of the past or the future he lay there and let the silent 
tears track down his face trailing, soaking into the pillow.
        After a while he forced his thoughts into order.  He thought of their
last night together, and the last talk they had.  Now he could feel the hurt
and betrayal in his heart.  It was a small bitter seed.  He wrapped a mental
hand around it and savored its feel.  The seed blossomed into a black rose
of anger, and suddenly he hated everone and everything.  He wanted to strike
out, to rage against the world and destroy, to hurt her for hurting him.
        Then it was gone.  Nothing was there but apathy.  It filled him.
Nothing mattered, nothing ever did, nothing ever would or should or could
without her.
        Clouds came.  Rain came.  The house stayed silent and empty as he lay
there.  She was never there he thought.  No one was ever there, and no one
had ever been there.  Everything was gone.  Blackness reigned.
