Not much going on this time, G.  Just some files for your reading pleasure.
These files are being released on 01-03-01, which is cool cuz it adds to five.

Heh.

Some of these files are by Grandmaster Ratte' and Franken Gibe of the cDc.
This, of course, is because we are better than you and we rub elbows with the
elite of the elite.

So, print the files out and read them in the can.

                        calling  (somewhat  like  GwD).

                        all  dirty  for  laughing.   Of
                        course,  you  *ARE*  dirty,  so
                        that feeling is nothing new.

                          What's going on in Grenedom?
                         ***** ***** ***** ***** *****

-> HEADLINES <-

GwD is the coolest entity on the planet.

And *YOU* are a chach-a-rific *SLUT*.

The only real news this time is that we're releasing 20 files.  What more
do you
sons of bitches want?

PUSSY SESSION.

-> OTHER NEWS <-

Umm, also, the website now works.  And GwDwarez was added, as was the page
about
our "Family of Companies."  Of course, "now works" is a relative term.  The
site
may not actually work for the first few hours (maybe even a whole day) after
this news file is sent out in e-mail.

That's about it, sluts.  If you would get off your asses and do something,
this
section wouldn't be so sparse.  Kids these days, fah!

-> SUBMISSION INFORMATION <-

If you have ANYTHING to submit to GwD (artwork, text, outlandish claims,
etc.),
DO NOT HESITATE to send it our way.  "submit@GREENY.org" is there for you,
baby.
Work must be 100% original and it must be understood that once submitted,
articles/artwork/photographs become the property of GwD, Inc. (unless they
have
been previously published elsewhere) and we can use them however we see fit,
even if it's merely to make fun of them (and you).

-> LETTERS TO THE EDITOR <-

[All spelling/grammar errors are those of the author(s) and are not errors on
the part of GwD, cuz, well, we're perfect.  Yeah.]

How can I donate sperm samples so as to help an infertile couple bring into 
fruition the gift and miracle of life? Where might I look to find places in 
my area (about ten miles east of Philadelphia) to participate?

Hi, we are third try.  I guess you could call us pop-punk.  Anyways, we are
writing you because we heard that you like bands like us, and we wanted you to
visit our website: http://www.thirdtry.com.  On thirdtry.com you can find FREE
MP3s of our music, so you can see for yourself how great we really are.  Thank
you for your time.

Sincerely Yours,
third try

PS: Also, while you are there, check out how you can help us win the Ernie
Ball
battle of the bands and win a cool purple glitter guitar!

[Purple is not cool.]
