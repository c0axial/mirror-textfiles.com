MAN.  YOU NEED A BACON DOUBLE-CHEESEBURGER, DAMNIT.

THOSE ARE COOL, AND THEY'RE 99 CENTS.  THE OTHER DAY THEY HAD CHANGED OVER 
FROM SELLING DOUBLE CHEESEBS TO BACON DOUBLE CHEESEBS FOR THE SAME PRICE BUT I 
DIDN'T KNOW IT YET.
SO I WAS ORDERING MY USUAL DOUBLE CHEESEB. AT THE DRIVE-THROUGH AND THE LADY 
SAID "THAT'LL BE $2-SOMETHING"

AND I WENT

"HUH?  AREN'T THOSE LIKE A DOLLAR?"

"NO.  NOT ANY MORE."

THEN I TRIED TO COMMUNICATE THAT I WANTED WHATEVER SORT OF BURGER THING THEY 
HAD THAT COST ABOUT A DOLLAR.  BIG MAC, DOUBLE SOMETHING, WHATEVER... IF IT'S 
WITHIN 10 CENTS OF A DOLLAR, THAT'S WHAT I WANT.  GOSH DURNIT.
THE DRIVE-THROUGH WINDOW PEOPLE DON'T SEEM TO LIKE TO BE ASKED INEQUALITIES.

WHY AM I WRITING THIS?
UNFORTUNATELY, I KNOW WHY... AND IT'S SCARY.
BYE.
