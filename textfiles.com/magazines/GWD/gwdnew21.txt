       New issues of _GwD:  The American Dream with a Twist -- of Lime_
                 http://www.GREENY.org/archives/cat_text.html
             Brought to you by the fine folks at GwD Publications!

* gwd136.txt - "Duck, Duck, Goose = End of All Things" by Aardv@rk
               Childrens' games and the Apocalypse.  Nice light bedtime
               reading.

* gwd137.txt - "Thoughts on Nothing" by Dr. Dr. Otis
               Dr. Dr. Otis has nothing to say.  Honest.

* gwd138.txt - "Bloodsport and Bildungsroman - Minors' First Ammendment Right
               of Access to Violent Gaming" by Yancey Slide
               If you'd like to know what this issue is about, you should read
               the title, numbnuts.

* gwd139.txt - "blargle" by Patriotic Polly
               New dr00g Patriotic Polly gives us "blargle," an in-depth look
               at the psychological ramifications of peer pressure and "going
               with the flow."  A must-read for students of human nature.
               Actually, for students of anything at all.

* gwd140.txt - "A Story about You, the Reader" by Aardv@rk
               Aardv@rk's written a story about *YOU*.  It might tell you
               something about yourself that you didn't know before.

(so, like, all authors are solely responsible for the content of their issues)

AND...               Zounds, Zounds, Really Cool Sounds!
                 New issues of _GwauDio_!  Wow your friends!
                 http://www.GREENY.org/archives/cat_mp3.html
      Continuing the GwD Publications/DOMINATION records collaboration!

* gwd016.mp3 - "No Takebacks" by Arbor Day
               A swell bunch (they're a seven piece band) of kids who used to
               be known as "Hugsabunch Freeloader" lent us "No Takebacks," a
               song from their soon-to-be-released debut, _The Lite E.P._  YOU
               WILL LISTEN TO THIS SONG AND YOU WILL LIKE IT.  (Check out
               their site at http://www.hugsabunch.com/.)

* gwd017.mp3 - "Affirmation" by Nosmo King
               Nosmo King (site coming soon...very soon) is still going
               strong.  Affirmation is a fine addition to their repertoire.
               DOWNLOAD IT NOW, YE SHAN'T BE DISAPPOINTED.

* gwd018.mp3 - "Eye Octal" by Infiltration Lab
               The (sort of) title track from Infiltration Lab's debut album
               _ioctl()_, the "virtually unlistenable debut album by
               Infiltration Lab."  The album (available in its entirety at
               http://www.noisybox.net/art/albums/ioctl/) was designed to
               demonstrate "how low-cost albums can be created using modern
               technology."  (Look for remixes of this and/or other
               Infiltration Lab "songs" soon from GwD.  Maybe.)
                                    
* gwd019.mp3 - "Around You" by Nosmo King
               Lounge Music for the Mentally Challenged.  

               And that's a compliment.  "Around You" is a happy love song.
               "Love is the most wondrous place I'll ever know."  Indeed!

* gwd020.mp3 - "Stop Laughing" by Arbor Day
               Stop laughing.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  Can't you see
               I'm in pain?  

               Actually, Arbor Day lent us this happy ditty
               (again taken from their forthcoming _The Lite E.P._) to help
               further the cause of _GwauDio_.  

               What cause is that?
               Nevermind.

-> HEADLINES <-

There's a fine new version of GwDweb, the mighty GwD website
(http://www.greeny.org/).  The new version of the site was designed using
Movable Type (http://www.movabletype.org/).  The blog-format of the site
allows the reader to comment on all of your favorite GwD t-files from the past
ten years, as well as all of our fine (and not-so-fine) GwDwarez and mp3s.
The photos on the site now have thumbnails (rather than vague descriptions --
yes, we've moved into the early 1990s).  You can comment on your favorite
photos as well.  These fine innovations of the site's photo album are thanks
to a fine piece of software called Gallery (http://gallery.sourceforge.net/).

There's also GwaDBlog, your source for "all the news that's fit to shit."
Come, read our musings on, well, whatever pisses us off.  Or whatever we find
amusing.  Or various and sundry other things.  Yes, we have a blog.  We are
tools.  "Tools of what?" you may ask.  Just tools.

Both GwDweb and GwaDBlog are also available on LiveJournal 
(http://www.livejournal.com/); the usernames are "GwD" and "GwaDBlog," 
respectively.  Add them to your friends list.

Definitely don't forget to stop by the GwD store for all of your
GREENY-endorsed merchandise.  Lunch boxes, beer steins, coffee mugs, mouse
pads.  And the clothes!  Shirts of various styles, boxer shorts, even thongs.
Now you have no excuse not to LOOK LIKE A dr00g EVERY DAY OF THE YEAR.  The
store can be found at http://www.cafeshops.com/gwdtaskforce/.

Thanks to the folx over at The Current Text Scene (http://www.textscene.com/),
GwD also has a discussion board that can be found at:
http://addendum.proboards22.com/index.cgi?board=GWD.  Drop by, leave some
feedback.

That's what it's all about, feedback from our readers.  The site redesign is
all about making it easier for you to share your thoughts, your concerns, your
hopes, your fears, your dreams with your friends at GwD.  So we can laugh at
them.  And you.

   -*- "GREENY.org is, perhaps, the single most important website ever." -*-

-> OTHER NEWS <-

Not much news about the group, other than the fact that WE CONTINUE TO ROCK
SERIOUS BALLS.  SERIOUSLY, I HAVE TROUBLE DESCRIBING TO YOU EXACTLY HOW MUCH
WE ROCK, BECAUSE WE ROCK SO FUCKING HARD.  GOOD LORD, DO WE EVER ROCK.

However, individual dr00gs have news, so here you go:

Shifty/Frank Ferra/whatever-his-name-is had a baby.  Well, he didn't actually
have the baby himself.  His girlfriend *had* the baby, but he was definitely
involved.  Their daughter's name is Kaian Eva.  She is healthy and happy, as
it should be.  Congrats to the Shifty/Ferra/whatever family from your friends
at GwaD.

Bill Hooper is married, sort of.  A less-than-legal dr00gan wedding was
performed by Yancey Slide in June of this year, followed by another wedding in
India.  The Hoopers plan to marry again sometime in 2004.

Lobo Licious and Seth The Man are now engaged.  Not to each other, despite
what you may have heard about their alleged decade-spanning affair.  Both
couples are very happy and plan to wed in separate ceremonies.

Stay tuned to GwDweb (http://www.GREENY.org/) for more GwD-ish news.

      -*- "There's nothing left on that plate but fat and gristle." -*-

-> SUBMISSION INFORMATION <-

If you have ANYTHING to submit to GwD (artwork, text, outlandish claims,
etc.), DO NOT HESITATE to send it our way.  "submit@GREENY.org" is there for
you, baby.  Work must be 100% original and it must be understood that once
submitted, articles/artwork/photographs become the property of GwD, Inc.
(unless they have been previously published elsewhere) and we can use them
however we see fit, even if it's merely to make fun of them (and you).

     -*- "It made me feel invincible, and I like to feel invincible." -*-

-> LETTER(S) TO THE EDITOR <-

Got a comment/question/complaint/rant?  Send 'em our way.  editor@GREENY.org
is always waiting for your e-mails.  However, we're really damn tired of
getting spam.  Cut the shit, else we'll sic Honkey Donkey on your lame ass.

[All spelling/grammar errors are those of the author(s) and are not errors on
the part of GwD, cuz, well, we're perfect.  Yeah.]

I just wanted to let you know about a text scene message board.  Feel free
to come and visit if you're interested.  This might be a good way for the
zinesters to keep in touch.

Peace!

p.s. my article about The Current Text Scene should be in Broken Pencil
within the next week or so.  That means that about 3000 new people should be
coming to textscene.com.  So, if you can, try to release something within
the month of October... and remember to keep in touch with me about all of
your new releases!

[That's right kids, be sure to check out The Current Text Scene over at
http://www.textscene.com/.  Also, check out the October 2003 issue of
_Broken Pencil_ (a Canadian zine that reviews zines) for BMC's article about
t-file history and the current text scene.]
