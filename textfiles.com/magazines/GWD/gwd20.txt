                                  Presents:
        Issue #1 of The Greeny world Domination Task Force Newletter!

                     "News! What's wiht' dat GREEN d00d?!?"
                        
                     (By STM, Lobo, & several others who aren't cool
                     enough to be named by me.  Although you might 
                     be able to name them.  I think I'll name 
                     them, but without any vowels!  They are: Zn, 
                     Trjn-Mn, and that smelly guy I met in
                     the bathroom, what was he doing in my bathroom
                     anyway?)

 The following are two totally unrelated quotes:

        "It's not the size that matters, it's how you use it.  I was talking
         about a ware, dammit!"
                     - Seth The Man

        "Seth is silly."
                     - Lobo

        uhhhh, yeah....this here file is written by some people who                                                      
don't have any idea what we are talking about, not that it really matters
anyway.  GwD sucks like seth.  which is actually quite enjoyable.

        In the begining, there was Chaos.  Then there was GREENY.  and he
soon started taking over the ENTIRE WORLD!  He started with The Underground,
he had a k-kool password: SMARTONE.   He posted ads in all caps everywhere
which gave his password, which everybody should NOT have known.  The people 
on Chaos were having a big discussion about how GREENY should be President.
Lobo suggested that he should become Emporor of the WORLD.  That's how GwD 
was founded.  Since Lobo was on Seth The Man's board, Chaos, Seth decided
that he wanted a slice of the power.  And thus the first two type of guys
came to be.  

THAT WAS A REVIEW FOR ALL YOU LOSERS OUT THERE.

"we all suck, and we know you don't give a shit anyways."
                                                - Zen

        We have meetings every month, and YOU AREN'T INVITED!  IN July, at 
our first meeting, we watched the Hellraiser trilogy. WE had great fun, and  
that was probably one of our best meetings. In August we had great fun in a 
pseudo-picnic, that ended up with a bunch of strange people (us) ravaging
STM's neighbors. Lobo missed that one. In September we ate at an annoying 
pizza place in town, looking for GREENY, but he wasn't there, so we found 
Transderm-Nitro, and made him a type-of-guy just because he ordered beer and
wouldn't share it with S00per Sperm. That was also the night of the first GwD
3/y+3 meetin' and all around cat-stalkin-wowie-neat guys meeting. It was fun.
I would elaborate but I can't because they wouldn't exactly be considered 
"good things" for a buncha teens and a 20-some-odd-year-old to be doing. In
Ocotober, we were supposed to meet at Seth's for a Halloween gathering.  Only 
Lobo showed up, however, because Seth had told everyone else that he was 
grounded but failed to relay the message to Lobo.  In November, we watched 
Transformers: The Movie, but we just couldn't find G.I. Joe: The Movie or The 
Smurfs and the Magic Flute.  We were sad.  (Note from Lobo:  Cops get mad if 
you stand out in the middle of the street and tell them to halt.)  We blew the
December meeting off because we like to act like we have lives, dammit!  In 
January, we watched Fletch and Robin Hood: Men In Tights at DB's abode.  We
also re-acquired Fastjack as a member (why we lost him is along story 
involving lots of sex, lies, and violence, 3000 gallons of petroleum jelly, 
and a horse named Ed.)  We didn't have a meeting in February, basically not
because we have a life or anything, we won't use that excuse again, but 
because STM listen'd to his "Billy Joel's Greatest Hits" and his PRiMUS tapes
way too many times. It wasn't very healthy for STM because we all know 
depressing music and violent music just don't mix in a healthy way...As for 
March, hopefully STM or Lobo or some other no-lifer out there will make one
soon...perhaps when Zen get's back..


        Zippy becoming a member actually gave us two Command Centers.  The 
Starchy White Boy BBS (which Fastjack is now the SysOp of) and Brazen's Hell 
(which is run by a good friend of Zippy's, and Zippy better tell him that he's
running a Command Center, else Lobo will thwack Zippy if/when he sees him this
summer).  Thanks a lot, Zippy.  He is moving to Fort Worth (hey, it's out of
THIS hell hole), and plans to put up a BBS there which will be a Command
Center.  TransDerm-Nitro also moved to Oklahoma, where he'd better put up a
new incarnation of GridPoint, or else he will be thwacked.

        Well gee, we also excommunicated a droog. His name was Little Man
Tate, well not really, but I almost made you think that's what his name was
didn't I? Anyway, he was always annoying, but we decided he might be worth 
our time, so we made him a dr00g anyway. Unfortunately he fell to B0b
(The anti-GREENY) and kept being annoying so we excommunicated him. Oh yeah,
his real name was Big Man Joe.  More on B0b later.


        Well, that's most of what happened. Maybe we'll add some more to this
file, but I don't know, some dr00gs are here so I'm going to stop typing and
go scare the frogs.

Thank you.

Afterword:
        Well I guess we didn't end up adding to much to this file, seeing as
it is over a month since we started this file...oh well, better late than 
never 'eh? err, don't answer that..
