gwd106.txt - "Capsicum annuum" by Priest
             It's all about the botany, baby.

gwd107.txt - "Texas" by fastjack
             fastjack gives GwD a helluva rant, proving that Texas is the best
             state, hands down.  Why?  Because Texas wants to kill you.  Has
             your state ever tried to kill you?  I think not.

gwd108.txt - "Getting Old" by Seth The Man
             STM is getting old.  Good Lord, he's an old bastard.

gwd109.txt - "Defining Quality" by Lobo Licious
             Just what in the hell is quality?  Lobo Licious rambles on and
             on, trying to explain.  Some interesting points tempered with dry
             humor.  Or not.

gwd110.txt - "Number 5" by The BMC
             The BMC, editor-in-chief of _The Neo-Comintern_
             (http://members.home.net/comintern/) and webmaster of "The
             Current Text Scene" (http://scene.textfiles.com/), lends us a
             discussion of just why the number Five is so damn important.  A
             must read for all true dr00gs and dr00gettes.

gwd111.txt - "CHEESEBURGER" by Kp Neato Dee
             MAN.  YOU NEED A BACON DOUBLE-CHEESEBURGER, DAMNIT.

gwd112.txt - "Experiments in Hedonism" by Jaffo
             Jaffo goes to the strip club.  What does he find there?  Bad
             lighting.  A crappy DJ.  Nekkid chicks.  And a SMOKE MACHINE!

gwd113.txt - "the game" by j3ph
             j3ph (of Scumdog Entertainment - http://scumdog.GREENY.org/)
             joins the dr00gish-ranks with a tale of a baseball game.  Think
             of this as sports-column with-a-twist of your (least) favorite
             e-zine.  What's the twist?  Read it and find out.  But bear in
             mind, j3ph's scary sideburns don't mean that he's a
             less-than-nice guy.  Uhh, yeah.

gwd114.txt - "'Doorman:'  A Modern _Crime and Punishment_ or Dostoevsky as a
             Punk" by Lobo Licious
             Licious compares Dostoevsky's opus with "Doorman," a song by
             self-described acid-punk band Brutal Juice.  It would seem that
             art does indeed imitate art.  Or something like that.

AND...

gwd115.txt - "git'n out" by Seth The Man
             Occasionally, Seth The Man's webcam shows an empty apartment.
             Where does Mr. The Man go?  Find out in this file.

                         ***** ***** ***** ***** *****
                          What's going on in Grenedom?

-> HEADLINES <-

GwD is cooler than you.  Really.

We had a GwD luncheon at Double Dave's Pizzaworks on 9-4-01.  That's right,
Labor Day.  Despite the lack of formal GwD meetings for several years, it was
exactly like meetings of old.  Some things never change, my friends.

Sorry, no _GwauDio_ releases this time.  Don't worry, though; there'll be new
issues in the near future.  We'll keep you posted.  Until then, visit
http://www.GREENY.org/pubz/gwaudio/gwaudio.html for all of your GwD-related
audio needs.

-> OTHER NEWS <-

The GwD Art Gallery is now back online (finally).  Check it:
http://www.GREENY.org/gwadhq/media/pics/art/art.html.  Word, G.

Since most of you people seem to hit the GwD Photo Album more than any other
part of the website, there will be 25 new pictures added as soon as Lobo
Licious gets around to it.  We're also looking into a thumbnail-ish format to
facilitate your dr00gan photo-browsing.

Speaking of hits (sort of), there's now a list of "Interesting Hits" that 
www.GREENY.org has received.  It includes governmental hits, military hits, 
and large corporations.  Check it out at:
http://www.GREENY.org/gwadhq/hits.html.

-> SUBMISSION INFORMATION <-

If you have ANYTHING to submit to GwD (artwork, text, outlandish claims,
etc.), DO NOT HESITATE to send it our way.  "submit@GREENY.org" is there for
you, baby.  Work must be 100% original and it must be understood that once
submitted, articles/artwork/photographs become the property of GwD, Inc.
(unless they have been previously published elsewhere) and we can use them
however we see fit, even if it's merely to make fun of them (and you).

-> LETTERS TO THE EDITOR <-

Got a comment/question/complaint/rant?  Send 'em our way.  editor@GREENY.org
is always waiting for your e-mails.

[All spelling/grammar errors are those of the author(s) and are not errors on
the part of GwD, cuz, well, we're perfect.  Yeah.]
