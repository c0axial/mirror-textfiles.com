%%%% Here is an interesting and quite witty post on The Snake's Den by Zen: %%%%

you know if you swallow chewing gum, it stays in your tummy for 7 years?

if you swallow watermelon seeds, then a watermelon grows in your tummy?

storks bring babies to parents, they don't do that sickening act known as sex.

smoking IS good for you... and so is driving drunk... and crack...

the neatest way to die is by drowning.... i know it is, i have done it.

pepsi is NOT the choice of a new generation.

beer will not make you happy... won't make people like you... it's all false!

mcdonalds doesn't make burgers out of cows, it's your long lost little
sibling that you are eating.

technology is bad.... change is bad... but changing technology is good

are you down with the weasel?

are you down with the cow?

are you going down on someone/something right now?

are you getting up right now?

are you getting down?

are you going up and down?

should you really be reading all of this?

should i really be typing all of this?

should you try drugs?

should i shoot myself?

should i shoot you?

should i use bounce in my laundry?

should i drink the water from the tap?

what kind of detergent is best?

the more expensive something is, the better the quality.

the longer you think about doing something, chances are you will end up not
doing it.

can you surf?

as your doctor, i advise you to start drinking heavily.

is there really a god?

how do i know that i am not dreaming right now?

how am i to know that you are not dreaming all of this?

is this a dream or is this reality?

how do you tell the difference between good and bad?

do you really think that you are smart?

who is to say who is smart and who is not?

some people can be smart, and still have the common sense of a wooden nickel.

some people can have TONS of common sense and be as dense as a rock.

einstein was a genius, but he was also certifiably insane.

hitler was a genius.... people just misunderstood him.




and that, my little mindless followers, is all i have to say at the moment.

i will get in touch with you again later.
