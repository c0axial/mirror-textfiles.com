* gwd126.txt - "Holly Near v. Melissa Etheridge" by Yancey Slide
               So, like, can same-sex couples that legally marry in one state
               get a legal divorce in a state that doesn't recognize same-sex
               marriages?  Hmmm...

* gwd127.txt - "Post-Lubbock Influenza" by Seth The Man
               STM got sick in Lubbock.  Alas.

* gwd128.txt - "Rice-a-Roni PIC Programmer" by breed_x
               Ever wondered what to do with the box after you've eaten your
               Rice-a-Roni?  breed_x offers a suggestion.

* gwd129.txt - "Chach Talk:  Inverview with Stein" by Elliot Deuce
               What makes Stein tick?  Who the hell is Stein?

* gwd130.txt - "GwD is..." by www.googlism.com
               A wonderful look at all of the many things that GwD is.
   
* gwd131.txt - "Lubbock Trip" by Seth The Man
               STM went to Lubbock.  Doesn't that sound fun?  Lubbock is fun,
               chach.

* gwd132.txt - "Star Wars Part 77" by Havoc
               Havoc tells an interesting story.  The point of the story seems
               to be the death of Havoc's former boss at the lightsaber of
               Samuel L. Jackson.

* gwd133.txt - "The Dregs of My Poetry" by Yancey Slide
               Yance took a poetry class.  Here are the results.

* gwd134.txt - "Remembering Porkins" by Ciacco the Hog
               Ciacco "interviewed" William Hootkins, the actor who portrayed
               Jek Porkins, the slightly-larger of the X-Wing pilots.

* gwd135.txt - "Bribs Plays Billiards" by The BMC
               Billiards, billiards, billiards.

* gwd011.mp3 - "Floppin' Around" by Nosmo King
               Nosmo King, an awesome jazzy combo that includes GwD faves
               Sir Flea (on bass) and Frank Ferra (on guitar and backing
               vocals), offers up this lovely song about not wearing underwear
               (if you're a guy) or a bra (if you're a lady).  You know what
               it's like to be floppin' around; admit it.  Okay, fine, that may
               not really be what the song is about.  But it's still excellent.
               Seriously.

* gwd012.mp3 - "I'd Just Like to Say that I'm Glad to Be Here" by Lobo Licious
               Lobo comments on life. (He's quoting SCUMDOG Entertainment's
               j3ph; this is taken from the stuN reeB video _Girls Think
               Sexy:  The History of stuN reeB_).  Another classic GwD
               soundbite; this was originally relased in 1997 as "glad.wav."
               It's being re-released because you asked so nicely.
             
* gwd013.mp3 - "Accident Prone" by Nosmo King
               This time, Nosmo King sings a little ditty about being unlucky.
               As in clumsy.  As in accident prone.  This song is amazing.
               Listen to it RIGHT NOW.
                                    
* gwd014.mp3 - "Mmmmm" by Priest
               MMMMMMM.  Mmmmm.  MMMMmmmm.  Yes.

* gwd015.mp3 - "Cut Back" by Nosmo King
               Man, Nosmo King just won't quit!  "Cut Back" offers you a
               heaping helping of their hospitality.  Or something like that.
               As with all other Nosmo King tracks, this song ROCKS SERIOUS
               BALLS.  Well, as much as a jazz song can rock, that is.  You
               will add this song to your WinAMP playlist.  YOU WILL.

AND...

-> HEADLINES <-

GwD IS TEN YEARS OLD.  YOUR TEXTFILE GROUP/E-ZINE IS NOT.  SO NYAH NYAH NYAH.

A LOT OF THE "CURRENT TEXT SCENE" (http://www.textscene.com/) IS "AT WAR."  AS
FAR AS WE'RE CONCERNED, THEY'RE ALL LAME ANYWAY.  NYAH NYAH NYAH.

Contrary to what you may have heard, at this point it seems that GwaDFEST03,
the GwD 10th Anniversary Gala Event, will be *INVITE ONLY*.  It was supposed
to be open to the public, but Seth dropped the ball and didn't reserve a big
enough convention center.  Licious's response to STM's lack of planning was
"Shit, Seth, I ask you to do one thing in TEN YEARS, and you can't even do it
right."

If anything changes, we'll let you know.

               -*- "Go hang a salami, I'm a lasagna hog." -*-

-> OTHER NEWS <-

Uhh, there isn't really any other news.  There's just some new text files to
read and some new mp3's to hear and some new (and old) warez for you to play
with.  It'll no doubt be nice to have something to play with other than
yourself.

Scumdog Steev (Lobo Licious) and Sir Flea do a radio show on KTXT-FM 88.1
(http://www.ktxt.net/) on Monday nights from 11pm-1am (Central Time).  Check
it out, if you're in Lubbock.  Or, hey, you can listen on-line.  That'd be
swell.  Yeah.

etc.), DO NOT HESITATE to send it our way.  "submit@GREENY.org" is there for
