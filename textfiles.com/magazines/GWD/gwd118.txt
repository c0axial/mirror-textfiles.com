Ok all you green bleeders, just hang on a sec.

Seth is saying he feels older.  Licious is talking about quality.  Jaffo went
to a nudie bar and good ol fastjack (whom I thought dead for a time) shows his
pride and loyalty.

So what the hell?

Yeah, its an age thing, for the most part.  It's a category more specifically.
From early teens you want to hit 18 so bad it hurts.  Then there's the magical
21 and you turn into a booze-hound for a time.  Then you hit 25, and your
insurance drops in price (see, they think you're getting wiser with age).

Then you creep up on 30 - the end of life as you know it.

But its not.  I call it "the great revelation".

This is where you take your life into account, and you see where it is, where
you are heading, and where you ultimately want to be while still clinging onto
the youthful activities of yesterday only now it starts to hurt a little more.
30 is your wake up call - you take a step back, and you see how your character
has developed through interaction with trials and tribulations (and of course
you have to use the word 'smarmy' at least 4 times a week).

So what the hell?

I took 2 weeks off of work to get away for a while (and apply elsewhere -
anywhere - dear god give me another job).  And I went to a friend's house and
we proceed to get 'tore-down.'  Well, this little FUCK-WIT pulls up on a brand
new Harley-Davidson Nightrain; it seems daddy has purchased his college boy a
gift.

And I hated him from the jump.

Now, there are not many people on this rock called earth that love the symbol
and shield more than I; in fact, I'd say I'm in the top 10.  So, shitbird
starts bitching about the bike after I compliment it.
"Well, it just runs out of gas unexpectedly."

Ok NIMROD!!!!  Theres a reserve tank on the bike for just such an event!!!!!!
Did you read the owners manual???  No.  So I proceed to show him the lever to
switch from reserve to primary.

"Oh well, that's cool.  This one just seems too loud though."

Start of eye twitch.

"Its got custom Screamin' Eagle pipes man.  What did you expect?"

"Well it just doesn't run right."

"Gimme the damn key!"

(I was joking...I'd kick the piss out of someone for that little statement.)

So he hands it over and must have noticed my eyes widen:  "You know how to
ride right?"

Brian just laughed at him.

In that brief instant I knew what it was - there was an itch in my spirit that
wanted me to throttle this little fuck.  But I got a little gray on the muzzle
now, so I just look at the opportunity to ride a Nightrain.

I took it around and up and down the block for a while.  It had a carb kit on
it too, I noticed that pretty quickly.

So I come back and say, "There's absolutely nothing wrong with this ride."
During the ride, the short sleeve crawled up the arm to show the Harley
tattoo.

"Well, of course you'd say that," (nodding to the mark on my arm) and then it
hit.

"Listen you half-a-fag, if you're so ungrateful as to look at this gift as
anything less than a godsend..."

At this point Brian just shoves a beer into my chest and says, "Ok, ok, here,
relax."

So I get off my soap-box and just sit there in disgust.

Earn it.  That's all I'm saying.
