Oh my GawD!   *****  The Funniest Comedy of the Year!  *****   More from GwaD!

             The GREENY world Domination Task Force, Incorporated
           Brings YOU 5 Brand New Text Files AND 5 NEW NEW NEW MP3s
          for the aftermath of GwD's Eighth Birthday (June 11, 2001)!
      (Issues 101-105 of GwD:  The American Dream with a Twist - of Lime
      and Issue 1-5 of Greeny's wildly amazing universal Digital opiate)

-> HEADLINES <-

GwD Publications/DOMINATION records announce the long-awaited release of their
joint venture...they have come together to bring you a "'zine" guaranteed to
make you cringe.
         
    Publication of our new 'zine, _GwauDio_ (_Greeny's wildly amazing
universal Digital opiate_) has begun.  As you might guess from the title, it's
an audio-zine.  It's the first audio-zine, as far as we know.  cDc releases
sequentially numbered mp3s, true, but they only started this in 2000.  The
idea for _GwauDio_ was first introduced by Seth The Man in 1998, and the first
release has been in the works since 1999 (yeah, that's a long time to wait for
this crap to be released).  Also, _GwauDio_ is even more unique in that it
features (almost) exclusively speech, rather than music.  We rock, I tell you,
we rock.  It is, after all, a universal Digital opiate -- that's right, a
Digital opiate for the masses.  Listen and learn, my little dr00gies.

gwd101.txt - "MY T.I. 'LITTLE MAESTRO'" by Kp Neato Dee
             A heartfelt tale about abusive relationships and musical toys for
             children.

gwd102.txt - "The CIA Hit List" by Lawrence Wilmot
             Reprinted from _The SPOTLIGHT_ newsweekly back in 1993, Mr.
             Wilmot gives detailed information about who exactly the CIA has
             killed.  This file takes "PUBLIC ENEMY #1:  CIA" (gwd57.txt) one
             step further.  Read it and be forever changed.

gwd103.txt - "The 'Genesis' of Feminism" by Priest
             Priest presents the truth about where exactly feminist thought
             originated.  Interesting, inciteful.  Read it for a surprise.
             Uhh, yeah.

gwd104.txt - "CHiPs" by Franken Gibe
             How dare you insult CHiPs?  BLASPHEMER!

gwd105.txt - "Risk and Uncertainty in Bernstein's _Against the Gods_" by Otis
             Otis is at it again, this time using Peter L. Bernstein's
             _Against the Gods_ to define risk and uncertainty.  For an
             alcoholic, this fellow [Otis] sure is pretty smart.  Or something
             like that.

AND...               Zounds, Zounds, Really Cool Sounds!
                        Inaugural release of GwauDio!

gwd001.mp3 - "Wank Pong Song" by Bob the Master of the World
             Bob the Master of the World sings a song to Seth The Man.  It's
             funny because it's true.  Uhh, yeah.

gwd002.mp3 - "ChaosLAN" by Stephen Hawking
             There's an e-mail listserv for ChaosLAN, the GwD-sponsored LAN
             party-group thing.  Little did we know until recently that
             Stephen Hawking was secretly lurking on the list.  This is what
             he had to say to (and about) us.

gwd003.mp3 - "G-Money" by Various Artists
             [One of the original GwD-mp3s (along with Bob tMotW's "Wank Pong
             Song"), this was slated to be released in 1999.  This, of course,
             explains its claim to a 1999 copyright date, even though it was
             not released until 2001.]  Featured artists:  Seth The Man,
             Bruno, Trailer Park Queen, DJ Saltine (The Notorious R.O.B.),
             Some Eye Doctor's Receptionist, and Some Zany Old Man.

gwd004.mp3 - "You the Man!" by Seth The Man, featuring Lobo Licious
             Lobo Licious pleasures yet another woman, and Seth The Man
             congratulates him.  [Originally released as "loboman.wav" in
             November 1997, this is being re-released because YOU demanded it.
             Blame yourself, chach.]

gwd005.mp3 - "Drunk" by fastjack and Priest
             fastjack and Priest are drunk.  Just listen to all of the fun
             they're having.  Don't you wish you were drunk, too?
