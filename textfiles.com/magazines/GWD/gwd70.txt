 - Why try to rule the world if there isn't going to be a world left to rule? -

We firmly believe that it is the failure of the current system, the Shopping
Mall State, that has led humanity to its current state of depravity.  This
system MUST be put to an end BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY to ensure the endurance of a
world to Dominate.  After all, where's world Domination without the 'world?'"

* The Second "Law" of Thermodynamics states, "elements in a system tend to seek
  their most probable distribution; in a system entropy always increases."
  According to noted physicist Groove Champion, "This ain't right.  This REALLY
  ain't right."

  The law basically states that entropy - or disorder - or chaos (but not
  C.H.A.O.S.) - increases in every system, all the time.  This has always been
  believed to be universally true.  The only known exception to this rule is
  Grene and Her all-powerful splendor who defied this "law" by creating a non-
  entropic system.  Life, the greatest creation of Grene, defies the Second Law
  of Thermodynamics by rising out of the primordial ooze into an ever-
  increasing complexity.  The politics of Grene's dr00gs, Her avatars on this
  Earth, therefore follow the same anti-entropic pattern.  [Besides, entropy is
  so passe.  It's outdated...in this techno-chic society, there's no place for
  such an archaic concept.]

* A government by followers of Grene is no government, by definition.  For a
  traditional government is designed to order society.  Fuck that noise.

  Political Droogism is the belief in inherent freedom and no given rights.  No
  man, government, or theologian has the power to give rights to individuals.
  Only Grene can give rights.  She created us, so the rights are inherent.  The
  governments are not.  Thus it was, thus is shall be.

* In truth, each individual holds every rank of church and state.  We are all
  the Pope.  We are all the President.  We are all the Top Worshipper Type of
  Guy.  And yes, we are all the Modern-Day Messiah.  Yet, we are also all
  postmen.  We are all garbage collectors.  We are all serfs.  We are all tax
  collectors.  And yes, we are all Dan Quayle.

* The Droogist is responsible only to himself.  In opposition to the common
  anarchist system, the Droogist system is like life:  self-organizing and
  evolving.  It's ordered because it's not.

* But how is the Droogist System implemented given the state of world politics?
  In the words of Steven Tyler from that old lame Aerosmith arcade game, "It's a
  revolution, baby!"

  "But what sort of revolution?"  And well you might ask.  "I thought Grene was
  all about love and porno and drugs and alcohol against violence."  She is.
  If you would shut up for two seconds, maybe we could explain.  The best kind
  of revolution is non-violent, with not so much as a single shot fired.  The
  best revolution, my little dr00gies and dr00gettes, is through individuality,
  following the teachings of Grene, and sending many many many cash donations
  to GwD.  That isn't to say that violent revolution is out of the question...
  it's just frowned upon.

  For Grene is non-violent, but that does not mean that she never gets pissed
  off.  Things in the world today are not right.  They are too ordered; too
  concerned with bringing order from the chaos rather than allowing that order
  to produce itself naturally through Her.  Grene will punish those who go
  against Her will.  She will bring her mighty H0ly Katana (tm) down, cutting a
  swath across the necks of her enemies.

* "Around the globe, generations of polluters will be punished for their sins,
  unshielded by the O-zone layer they have successfully depleted, left to bake
  in the searing rays of light." - Intro to Busta Rhymes's _Extinction Level
  Event_.

  For Grene has noticed that our world is under siege.  The siege, my friends,
  is coming from the Mightiest of the Mighty...from the Gap, from J.C. Penney,
  from Sears Roebuck & Co....and yes, from Abercrombie and Fitch [The store from
  that damn LFO song...if I hear that song one more time, I swear to Grene I'll
  cry like a little girl...get your "I Hate Gurls That Wear Abercrombie and
  Fitch" t-shirt today...available exclusively from GwD, Inc.  $15 to the P.O.
  Box.  ORDER NOW.]  The siege must be broken.  And it must be broken soon, or
  all will be lost.  The cataclysm is drawing nigh.  Armageddon is just around
  the corner.

* We are living in desperate times.  The Shopping Mall State has gone astray
  from its original goal of promotion of ease of shopping by consolidating
  stores in one location.  In fact, this original goal *is* the core of the evil
  of the Shopping Mall:  by forcing order on the shopping habits of the poor,
  down-trodden masses, the Malls obey the Second Law by increasing the Universal
  Chaos.  The abominations that they have become serve no purpose other than to
  maim and kill Grene's First Creation:  the Earth, the world on which we live,
  die, and procreate.  As we said before, what good is world Domination if there
  ain't a world?  Huh?  WHAT FUCKING GOOD?  Humanity has suffered beneath the
  boot-heels of the Shopping Mall State and its good-for-nothing aristocracy for
  too long.

* We're tired of the senseless destruction of rainforests to build shopping
  malls.  Everyday, millions of acres of rainforests are destroyed so that you
  can shop in Waldenbooks and eat pretzels.  Don't even get us started on
  pretzel shops.

* We're tired of the senseless clubbing of baby seals to put fur coats on sale
  in these Shopping Malls.  Fine, so seals aren't used for fur coats.  The seals
  are clubbed, and you *ARE* wearing the furs.  You get the point.  Millions
  upon millions of animals are killed (not to mention all of the sheep that are
  SHAVED) each year so YOU can buy clothes.  SHAME AND DISGRACE BE UPON YOUR
  FAMILY FOR GENERATIONS.

* We're tired of factories polluting the air, land, and water to manufacture the
  materials used to both build and fill these Shopping Malls.  This one is
  obvious.  Pollution = bad.

* We're tired of conservationists and other "extremists" being imprisoned the
  world over for "crimes" that are in the best interest of the world as a whole,
  "crimes" against the Shopping Mall State.  As such, the GREENY world
  Domination Task Force, Inc. hereby demands that the following Hostages and
  Political Prisoners of the Shopping Mall War be released:

        Mumia Abu-Jamal
        Talib Becktemba
        Connor Grady
        William Jones "Wolverine" Ignace
        Theodore Kaczynski
        Adolfo Matos
        John Eddie McNicholl
        Kevin Mitnick
        Leonard Peltier
        Ahmad Qatamesh
        Chen Yanbin

  Updates to this list will be made when we damn well feel like it.  If they are
  not released in a timely fashion, there will be hell to pay.  Green Hell.  Not
  the Misfits song, either.  Yeah.

* Basically, we're tired of Shopping Malls.  They're big.  They're ugly.  They
  smell funny.  And they're filled with people.  You might actually have to
  interact with someone.  Who wants that?

                        ---> BOYCOTT SHOPPING MALLS! <---

"Why?" - THEY are the ROOT of all that is EVIL!  THEY are the TOOLS of REDD, the
         DESTROYER!

"How?" - JOIN THE GROWING RANKS OF THE ECOTERRORISTS!  New members are joining
         in the GwD/Ecoterrorism coalition everyday.  We already have the
         support of leading social and environmental groups (the specifics of
         which we cannot disclose because they're afraid of their association
         with us going public.  Soon, they'll be afraid NOT TO have the public
         know of their association with us.)  We will follow the teachings of
         Grene.  We will wreak havoc on the Shopping Mall State in which we
         live.  We will kill the ones that eat us and eat the ones we kill.  We
         will make you pay for your insolence.  We will pay you to be insolent.
         <churchill>
            We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France,
            we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing
            confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our
            Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we
            shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and
            in the streets, we shall fight in the hills;
            WE SHALL NEVER SURRENDER!

"What can I do?" - You can DO YOUR PART to END the SHOPPING MALL MENACE!  SAVE
                   the WHALES or EAT the WHALES!  SAVE the BABY SEALS _BY_
                   CLUBBING THEM!  SAVE the RAINFORESTS through ARSON!  DO your
                   PART to PROTECT the ENVIRONMENT!  RECYCLE!  Contribute to
                   LANDFILLS!  BURN DOWN the HOMES of SMOKERS!  PISS on the
                   STEPS or in the ELEVATOR of your LEAST FAVORITE dept. store,
                   or BETTER YET the CAPITOL BUILDING IN WASHINGTON, D.C.!
                   SPILL your COKE in a BOOKSTORE!  TEAR OPEN the PLASTIC-WRAP
                   on all the NUDIE MAGAZINES!  SERVE FOOD without WASHING YOUR
                   HANDS FIRST!  DESTROY the FACTORIES!  Build NEW ones!  THROW
                   a MONKEY-WRENCH into the COGS of the MILITARY INDUSTRIAL
                   COMPLEX!  STOCKPILE NUCLEAR WEAPONS!  PUT a BULLET in the
                   HEADS of the POLLUTERS!  SKULL-FUCK THOSE WHO OPPOSE!  DO NOT
                   allow the SHAVING of the SHEEP; instead OFFER YOURSELF AS THE
                   SACRIFICIAL LAMB!  (It's about time we walk around in
                   clothing made from HUMAN HAIR, isn't it?)
