  Oh my GawD!          **** Wait - There's More! ****          More from GwaD!
                   The GREENY world Domination Task Force
   Brings YOU 2 Brand Spanking New Text Files for the fall semester of 1994!
GwD has not been very active this summer, but that's okay.  What we have done is
 written some of our best text files yet (the authors think so, anyway) namely:

        gwd31.txt - Cow Stompin!                          (by Seth Sometimes)
AND....
        gwd32.txt - BBSes                                 (by Sir Flea).

   Download them from any GwD Command Center, or anywhere else that has them!

                     **** Get Them Before They Get YOU! ****
