-[ Introduction ]-

 There is an age when trick or treating loses its appeal, and people look
 for other methods of entertainment on Halloween. One of the oldest pastimes
 on Halloween is the generic water ballooning. This method is entertaining 
 for a while, though it loses its appeal if you are in a small car, disal-
 lowing you to utilize your whole body to throw the water balloon, or it
 explodes before it leaves the car. With the currently available equipment,
 Water Gunning is a practical alternative.

-[ Equipment ]-

 The main tool used in water gunning is the water gun. There are a myriad
 of water guns on the market today. I, however, have found the Super Soaker
 series by some toy company to be the most effective. These guns can run from 
 about $5.00 to over 20 dollars. You should choose a type by your current 
 financial situation. For serious gunnings, I suggest the Super Soker 200. 
 This gun has a huge water resevoir, and because you are in a car, the weight 
 is no matter. I have achieved great results from a 50, though there have been 
 times the range was insufficient. The 20 is an excellent gun for its price 
 and size. This gun is good if you are in a cramped environment, and lack the 
 room necessary for a good aim with a 50 to 200. The car that you use is 
 essencial to your success. For group activities, a car such as a suburban is 
 best, though I prefer the small type.

-[ Preparation ]-
 
 When you are water gunning, there are a few essentials. First, you must have 
 a designated driver (preferably sober). Do not attempt to drive and shoot by 
 yourself! You will either miss your target completely, or end up hitting 
 someone with your car. Always keep a few towels in the car, as water guns 
 usually leak a bit, and sometimes the wind blows water back into the car. 
 Extra water is not useually required, unless you plan to go on an all 
 nighter.

-[ Step One: Finding A Target ]-

 First you must find a set target before you begin shooting. Random shots are 
 useually less efficient and result in misses and wasted water. The targets I 
 suggest are jr. high and high school students. Useually, people that have 
 reached this age can take being shot as a joke, which is all that it really 
 is. Next, make sure there aren't any parents around. Most parents or adults 
 have the common sense to take down your liscense plate number, and that is 
 the last thing that you would want to happen. If you do find a good target, 
 always ensure an escape route. The stupidest thing to do is to execute an 
 excellent drive by and get stuck in traffic. Oh yeah, I almost forgot, check 
 for police. You wouldn't expect it, but police do patrol some neighborhoods 
 during Halloween.

-[ Step Two: The Approach ]-

 A good approach will allow you to get your target by suprise. After you have
 set a target in front of you, kill your lights and accellerate a bit. If you 
 have passed the target, circle around the block, and execute a from the rear 
 approach (kill lights, accellerate). The front end approach is a bit more 
 difficult. When approaching from the front, make sure your guns are hidden. 
 Next slow down, but don't stop, or slow excessively till the last moment! I 
 feel the rear approach is best, because the facial expressions of the targets 
 are much more amusing. During the approach, those that are using super 
 soakers should pump the guns.

-[ Step Three: Tracking ]-

 To get a good shot, you should track your target. To track effectively, a
 rear approach must be made. When you are approx. 50 ft from the target, stick 
 your nozzle out the window, and point it at the target as you approach. This 
 action will ensure that you have a clear shot, and that your aim is correct. 
 Again, tracking should only be used in a rear approach! If you do a front end 
 approach, you will be forced to pull and shoot.

-[ Step Four: The Shot ]-

 This is what you have been working for. At this point, you must have executed 
 all of the above that apply to you successfully. When you are close enough 
 for a clean shot, the driver should either stop, or slow to engine idling 
 speed. My best shots have been from about 5 to ten feet. Keep the nozzle 
 aimed directly at the target, and apply a gentle but firm pressure. Allow 
 only about 2 to 5 seconds for a shot, then accellerate out.

-[ Step Five: Accellerating Out ]-

 This step is self explanatory. Apply a firm pressure to the accellerator, and 
 take the planned escape route, or take the first turn possible. Make sure you 
 watch out for little kids that might jump in front of you, the last thing you 
 want to do is get a big dent on your hood. Don't turn back on your lights 
 till you are around the corner.

-[ Extra ]-

 The most imporant part to a drive by party is a good driver. Choose a driver
 with good judgement, and common sense. ALLWAYS look out for police!

-[ Games ]-

 You can make up any game you want when you do drive bys; here is one 
 suggestion:
       Extra Bonus                         Target
              
 Moving ( Roller Blade/Skate, Bike,          O    }---- 100 pts.
   Skateboards, etc..)                     --|--  \
       = 40 pts.                             |     |--- 30 pts.
 Costumes                                   / \   /
    Vampires = 15 pts.                    _|   |_ }---- 10 pts.
    Princesses = 15 pts.
    Cowboys = 10 pts.
    Cheerleaders = 20 pts.
