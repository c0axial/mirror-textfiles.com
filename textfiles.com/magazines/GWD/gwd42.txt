GwD, Incorporated is dedicated to the exposing of false prophets.  We have found
one such "prophet" in Bob Larson of Bob Larson:  Live and formerly of Talk-Back
with Bob Larson.  A supposed Christian radio evangelist, Bob Larson is actually
only motivated by financial gain.  These 14 articles by Kenneth L. Smith prove 
this.  From this point on, GwD is anti-Bob Larson.

Subject: Bob Larson - Christian or Charlatan ?


For those of you who may have read the post concerning Josh McDowell, the
information about Josh was gathered during the course of an investigation being
conducted on Christian writer and radio commentator Bob Larson.

Bob Larson's Talk-Back is heard daily on over 170 stations in North America. The
Denver-based ministry that Larson heads is supposed to be the "cutting-edge" in
Christian broadcasting (or that's what Larson would like you to believe ). But
the real Bob Larson, and the real motives of his work with the ministry is
becoming more apparent as critics are now taking a probing look into the radio
show, the ministry, and Bob Larson himself.

The following article, _The Two Faces of Bob_, first appeared in the Christian
Press Report, an electronic newsletter out of California. (It's permitted for
public distribution in addition to the copyright, I have complete permission
from the author of the article to post this.)

I don't know how many people on the net know of Larson, but I feel that this
information needs to be brought forth.

If you have any comments or questions, please send your responses to
21922sm@msu.edu.

Other posts will be forthcoming.

Thanks very much for taking time to read this.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> The Two Faces of Bob <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

          In an interview with the Evangelical Press, Bob Larson
        boasted that "Nobody is accusing me of doing any thing
        illegal, immoral, or unethical."[1]  So, just call me
        nobody.  Larson is a pathological liar -- or at the very
        least, is in the habit of taking indecent liberties with
        the truth.  This common thread seems to run through every
        aspect of Bob's life.  His fetish for falsehoods even is
        evidenced by exaggerations of his childhood achievements:
        for instance, he asserted in his 1974 book, Hell on Earth,
        that he was a child star:

            "Bob Larson achieved fame at the age of thirteen when
          his first hit song was published.  He had his own rock
          and roll band at fifteen, and performed on radio and
          television over the next years until his career took him
          to Convention Hall in Atlantic City."[2]

          As often is the case with Bob Larson, reality never
        quite matches up with his press releases.  Sharla Turman
        Logan, the keyboard player for "The Rebels" (Bob's former
        band) stated that she knew Bob at thirteen, but "never
        heard of any hit song."[3]  And although they did in fact
        play to a capacity audience at Convention Hall in Atlantic
        City, there was a little more to the story than meets the
        eye. It seems that they played one song -- at a Lions'
        Club convention.[4] The drummer's father was an officer in
        the organization; HE booked the gig.

                The song: A parody of "Charlie Brown."[5]

          Larson's penchant for prevarication can also be seen in
        his aborted medical career. On January 5, 1993, Bob
        publicly claimed that when he entered the ministry, he was
        "only a few credits away" from receiving a degree in
        chemistry, and then, going on to medical school.[6] Yet,
        Bob graduated from high school in 1962, attended McCook
        Junior College for one year, transferred to the University
        of Nebraska, and left there in September of 1964.[7]

        Unless he truly was a phenomenal student (and there is no
        evidence of that), he would not even have been close to
        graduating after two years.  Maybe not a "lie," but
        certainly a gross exaggeration.

          Bob Larson would have you believe that he was
        independently wealthy before he entered his ministry, and
        that he was really doing it for his love of the kids.  In
        a 1992 interview with Michael Roberts of Westword
        magazine, he explained his wealth this way:

            "A caller came on the air the other day,' he says,
          and made the comment, Is it true that you were a
          self-made millionaire before you began the ministry?' I
          said no, but I was very close to it, and I had traveled
          lecturing professionally for a number of years, before I
          ever got involved in the ministry, and was making very,
          very large sums of money at the time'."[8]

          And on a Denver radio broadcast, he attributed some of
        his wealth to his 'success' in the music world:" I have
        been involved in gainful employment for 30 years; I was
        making a pile of money as a teenager, playing in rock and
        roll."[9]  But once again, Larson's proud words shatter on
        those unforgiving rocks of reality.  During his 1991
        divorce, he and his ex-wife gave the following testimony:

          "Q: [by Mr. Plaut, Bob Larson's attorney] Mr. Larson,
          would you tell us as far as lifestyle goes how you and
          Mrs. Larson have lived, starting again at the beginning
          of the marriage and bringing us up to date.

           A: Well, the lifestyle was pretty austere in the
          beginning.  We had no possessions at the time of the
          marriage.  I had a car that I was making payments on and
          a few hundred dollars in the bank.  And it was pretty
          much that way for quite a while, until I got involved in
          selling books and speaking.  And then, as Mr.  Guthery
          pointed out earlier, there was really no serious
          escalation in our lifestyle until the last few years,
          when the cumulative success of building the organization
          allowed the organization to compensate me much better
          than they had."[10]

                             _________________________

          "Q: ([To Mrs. Larson] By Mr. Frazin [her attorney] What
          exactly did you do -- what were your duties when you
          first got started with the ministry?

           A: [Kathy Larson] As Bob described, when we first got
          the ministry, we had a car with payments and a little
          trailer we pulled behind the car.  And eventually then
          we bought a trailer house we pulled behind the car ...
          It was a very humble beginning...."[11]

          First, even if Bob made a pile of money playing rock and
        roll, it was all gone when he married Kathy during 1968.
        Second, if he was nearly a millionaire when he opened the
        ministry, and barely a millionaire now, he cannot possibly
        account for his statement that "there was really no
        serious escalation in [their] lifestyle until the last few
        years."  Therefore, either he lied in court ... or on the
        air.  When the dust settles, this much is obvious: Bob did
        not make his fortune in real estate, rock and roll, or
        anywhere else.  He made it from the ministry -- he has not
        held a real job since he dropped out of college.[12] What
        a tangled web we weave ... when we practice to deceive!


        In the Evangelical Press interview, Larson claimed:
        "World didn't talk to radio station owners' ... We have
        not had a single radio station cancel us or be less than
        100 percent supportive'."[13]  But in a fundraising letter
        dated January 27, 1992, he told his contributors that
        "Satan did everything possible to destroy me last year ...
        four of our top ten stations forced me off the air."[14]

        Another station, KSLR in San Antonio, reportedly was sued
        by the Ministry after it pulled Talk-Back[15], even though
        Larson claimed in a news conference that he "would never
        sue a brother."[16] If World's people had talked to
        Larson's former affiliates, they would have caught him in
        yet another lie.  On his March 17, 1993 broadcast, Bob
        Larson publicly charged that the Mormon church had spawned
        a sinister scheme to destroy his ministry, and that he was
        forced from the air in Calgary as a result of their
        effort.[17] However, when I spoke with that station's
        operations manager, and played her a taped excerpt of
        Bob's on-air claims, her response was one of astonishment.
        "It wasn't like that at all,"[18] she said adamantly.

          It wasn't like that at all.  That theme reverberates
        throughout any discussion concerning the antics of Bob
        Larson ... but nowhere is it more pronounced as in his
        financial information.  For years, Bob has been claiming
        that he is fighting to stay on your station, cleverly
        painting the misleading impression that the Ministry is
        on the knife-edge of financial disaster.  But
        if its' audited financial statement is any indication,
        the Ministry is in the very flower of fiscal health:

          During 1991, Bob Larson Ministries had a surplus of
        more than $246,000[20] ... and in 1990, that surplus was
        over $500,000![21]  We should all be in such desperate
        financial straits.

          Larson's difficulties with the truth spill over into his
        personal financial situation as well.  On the air, Bob has
        stated that he draws a $69,000 [22] yearly salary from the
        Ministry ... which not only seems reasonable, but
        downright modest.  But as might be expected, documents
        filed with the Jefferson County (Colo.) District Court in
        connection with his divorce [23] -- signed under penalty
        of perjury -- tell a different tale.  The following is an
        estimate of Larson's compensation package for 1990, based
        upon that information, documents filed with the Internal
        Revenue service, and interviews with former BLM employees:

        explained in the endnote section.

        ______________________________________________________

          From this information, it appears self-evident that the
        _real_ mission of Bob Larson Ministries is to minister to
        the extravagant financial needs of Bob Larson!  The kids
        are just an alibi.

          But the uncontested crown jewel in the labyrinth of Bob
        Larson's lies is the claim that HE wrote his best-selling
        novel, Dead Air.  On his Jan. 29, 1993 broadcast -- which
        he called "the most candid, direct program I've ever
        done"[24] -- he said that:

            "Lori did help me some with the writing of this book,
          primarily in just adding a little color ... and contrary
          to what the article states, the book was nearly completed
          -- she had nothing to do with the plot, the characters
          ... anything in the book whatsoever."[25]

          If Bob was telling the truth, then Lori Boespflug's role
        in the writing of Dead Air was minuscule at best.  Thus,
        it seems strange that Bob's attorney, William T.  Abbott,
        would offer him this advice:

            "With the passing of each day, I become more and more
          concerned about your potential liability to Lori in
          connection with Dead Air and its sequels.  The time
          table is immediate.  You will soon know if Dead Air is
          to be a publishing success and, quite possibly, if
          theatrical rights are to be optioned.  Assuming success,
          and knowing the role Lori has played, it would amaze me
          if she is not sufficiently astute to use the opportunity
          to both secure her financial future and to launch her
          own literary career."[26]

          The logic here is inescapable: If as Bob insists, he
        wrote Dead Air, then there wasn't any need for advice.  As
        such, that letter never should have been written in the
        first place -- and it couldn't possibly be stolen, as he
        has asserted.  On the other hand, if he did not write the
        best-selling novel that bears his name, then he has
        knowingly and deliberately deceived his nationwide
        audience.  Either way, I submit to you that Bob's
        credibility is absolutely shot.

        For even when Bob 'bares his soul', he lies through his teeth.

        NOTES TO THE ESTIMATE OF LARSON'S 1990 MINISTRY INCOME:

        B Documents filed with the Internal Revenue Service show
          Larson's total compensation from Bob Larson Ministries
          to be $222,237 -- almost $5,000 HIGHER than the figure
          reported in the affidavit.  Note also that a $175,000
          bonus, ostensibly paid as compensation for the
          forbearance of salary by Larson in previous years, has
          not been included in this calculation; according to
          courtroom testimony, it was paid in 1989.

        C According to sources within BLM -- corroborated in part
          by courtroom testimony -- IBN's primary function is to
          distribute Larson's "Talk-Back" radio broadcasts; any
          business it conducts with other ministries is, for the
          most part, purely incidental.

        D According to BLM sources, Larson does not reimburse BLM
          or IBN for air time spent promoting his books.  The
          "retail" value of this 'incidental' benefit is a

          staggering ($10 per 1/2-minute spot x 2 spots/day on
          each station x 170 stations = $3,400/day -- or over
          $800,000/year!  Still, there IS something to be said for
          volume discounts.  The figure used is a quick
          approximation, based on a rough estimate that 1/60th of
          the "Talk-Back" air time is dedicated to "book
          promotion," and his program is substantially subsidized
          (55-60% of the total cost of air time, based on
          estimates from radio station managers) by locally-based
          commercial advertising.

        E This figure was based primarily upon the testimony of
          Lori Boespflug, who claimed to have spent over 1,000
          hours during 1990 on the writing of Dead Air, and has
          time sheets to prove it.  Larson has since publicly
          admitted that his research staffers produce so- called
          "briefing books," which he uses as the research for his
          many books.  He has not, however, confirmed staffers'
          allegations that they do most of the writing and
          editing.  The $20,000 figure is therefore conservative,
          but not unreasonably so.  Incidentally, Boespflug told
          me that she was "about 90% finished" with Abaddon when
          she was fired by Bob Larson; it will be interesting to
          compare her draft copy with the final published product.

        F This figure was based upon testimony from several
          sources -- including an agreement between Larson and
          Dead Air publisher Thomas Nelson.  Evidently, at the
          close of 1990, Larson and his lawyers drew up an
          agreement which enabled the Ministry to benefit from the
          sale of books as "premiums," but prior to that, it is
          believed that Larson garnered most of the benefit from
          book sales.

        G According to courtroom testimony, the total income
          reported on the Larson's 1990 federal income tax return
          was $403,310, of which $39,300 was directly attributable
          to tax able dividends and interest.  If Larson's pre-tax
          income from Ministry activity in this estimate was
          reported as expected, he should have received roughly
          $70,000 in bona fide royalties, after expenses -- which
          is in line with reasonable expectations.

       Re: "Bob on the Block"

       Dear Mr. Neff:


         I respectfully submit the following statement for publication in
       your magazine -- with the proviso that it be printed in its entirety,
       and afforded exposure similar to that of the aforementioned article.
       Moreover, it is not to be edited without my express written approval.
       Considering that CT "quoted" me without ever bothering to conduct an
       interview, I am certain that you will understand when I say that I am
       not overly impressed with the competence of your editorial staff.

         As you have indicated that Mr. Morgan left you "with the impression
       that he had interviewed [me]," I will, for the moment, assume that he
       was acting on his own, and that you are indeed committed to reporting
       the facts (and saving CT's reputation).  Hence, you should be willing
       to do whatever it takes to redeem yourselves, and I fully expect that
       you will afford me total and complete cooperation.  But you ought not
       forget that I will be making this information widely available within
       the evangelical community; the eyes of Christendom are upon you.

         Please be apprised that I will also send copies of this letter and
       the supporting documentation to the _Washington Post_, _New York
       Times_, _Los Angeles Times_, _Dallas Morning News_, and _60 Minutes_
       ... not to mention _Cornerstone_ and _World magazines_.

       _____________________________________________________________________

                                 CT on the Block?

        CHRISTIANITY TODAY.  Founded by Billy Graham.  Nurtured by the likes
       of Harold Lindsell and Carl Henry.  For decades, the name was
       synonymous with journalistic integrity.

                        My, but how the mighty have fallen!

         When I brought the Bob Larson story to _CT_ in July of 1992, the
       evidence indicated three points of serious concern: Larson did not
       write "his" best-selling novel, _Dead Air_; he was getting an
       exorbitant compensation package from the Ministry, and he was grossly
       misrepresenting the Ministry's financial needs.  Still, despite the
       fact that two Christian journalists checked my findings
       independently, Tim Morgan's article, "Bob on the Block," scarcely
       even alluded to them.  Further more, Morgan steadfastly refused to
       interview anyone with information which would be construed as harmful
       to Larson.  To say that Morgan performed a 'whitewash job' on Larson
       would be a colossal understatement.  But did he do so of his own
       volition ... or was he _specifically_ ordered to write a pro-Larson
       piece?  That is the question which _CT_ must now answer.

         Without question, the most glaring miscue in the CT article was its
       blithe dismissal of Lori Boespflug's claim to the authorship of
       "Larson's" best-selling novel, _Dead Air_.  As _World_[1] and
       _Cornerstone_[2] magazines both duly noted, it was buttressed by
       a wealth of documentary evidence, including a letter from Larson's
       own attorney.  What's more, Larson authenticated that letter himself
       ...  by claiming it was "stolen."[3] After all, if he HAD written
       _Dead Air_, that letter never should have been written in the first
       place, and thus, could not possibly have been stolen.  Hence, by
       definition, Larson has to be lying about something, and any cub
       reporter with the intelligence of a common garden implement should
       have been able to recognize it.  As such, it seems utterly
       inconceivable that a respected senior reporter like Morgan could have
       overlooked it.  And even if, perchance, Morgan was unable to
       recognize that fact on his own, it was spelled out for him in graphic
       detail in my pamphlet, _The Two Faces of Bob_.[4]

         Although I would have preferred not to mention it, there is a
       salacious aspect to this story which, in light of Larson's allegations
       of sexual improprieties on Boespflug's part, must come to light.
       While it is true that she was fired for living with a man, as the
       following excerpts from an "employment contract" signed by both her
       and Larson suggests, there was more to her dismissal than met the
       eye:


           MEMO TO:          BOB LARSON
           FROM:             LORI BOESPFLUG
           RE:               EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT
           5/29/91
           ---------------------------------------------------------------
           It is my understanding at this date, that to remain employed
           with Bob Larson Ministries that the following conditions be in
           effect:

           1. My cellular car phone be returned to the organization, and
           I no longer retain sole usage.  I also understand that any
           phone calls made to 469-**** are to be reimbursed by me as
           personal calls, misusing organizational property.

           5. All gifts and items of any merit or value [including, among
           other things, a diamond frog broach valued at $2,800 [5] that
           you have extended to me for any reason have been returned to you
           as of this date.

           6. I will cease any outside friendship and/or contact with the
           man that installed my carpeting [whose number, incidentally, is
           listed in Paragraph 1 of said Agreement], due to the
           confidentiality and secure nature of my job should my position
           be re-instated [sic]."[6]

         That document, in confluence with others which _CT_ has had in its'
       possession for roughly nine months, exposes a multitude of Larson's
       sins.  First, it is clear from Boespflug's stellar personnel
       reviews[7] and prodigious salary increases that Larson was
       ecstatic with her job performance.  Second, the 'business reason'
       given in the contract for the need for her to break off the
       relationship is facially ludicrous.  There is thus only one
       plausible explanation for those peculiar provisions: Larson was
       hopelessly infatuated with her ... and insanely jealous, to boot.

         According to Boespflug, Larson continued to insinuate himself into
       her life ... writing passionate love sonnets, and calling her at all
       hours to make certain that she wasn't seeing anyone else.  He tailed
       her to various and sundry locations, and even tracked her down at her
       daughter's dance recital.  There, he fired her -- in full public view
       -- on a Saturday night.  He called her a slut, a whore, and otherwise
       totally humiliated her.[8]

         Even though I originally brought the story to _CT_, I was not
       treated with any more courtesy.  In fact, when I heard that CT was to
       interview Larson, I called managing editor David Neff, asking to be
       inter viewed.[9]  Shortly thereafter, I sent a letter to Neff,
       insisting to have such an opportunity.[10] Still, my polite
       requests and veiled threats fell on deaf ears -- as did those of
       Christian talk-show host John Stewart,[11] who is known for,
       among other accomplishments, his role in the expose of Jim Bakker.
       It is difficult to imagine how any objective reporter could even
       begin to be so obtuse.

         The defamatory assault that Morgan perpetrated on my character was
       more subtle than that on Ms. Boespflug, but it was effective.  You
       will note that unlike other individuals mentioned in the article, CT
       neglected to list my credentials: I am a certified public accountant,
       with some eight years' experience and a master's degree in taxation,
       and thus am well qualified to render an opinion as to Larson's financial
       situation.  But by calling me a "Denver-area resident [who has]
       made it his avocation to distribute material critical of Larson,"[12]
       Morgan makes it appear as though I am an ignorant stevedore with some
       kind of mindless vendetta against him.

         To correct _CT_'s litany of blatant misrepresentations would
       require more space than their editorial staff has the courage to
       grant.  But suffice it to say that while Larson did not receive a
       salary from his ministry during the early 1980's, the evidence
       suggests strongly that he was quite well-compensated for his time.
       For instance, he bought the building the Ministry currently occupies
       from one David Kramer on October 2, 1985 for $1,415,000,[13] and,
       on December 31, 1986, he sold it to the Ministry for $1,800,000.[14]
       In less than 15 months, Larson earned a tidy profit of $385,000 ...
       quite astounding, given the fact that the Denver real estate market
       was in a general downturn[15] during that period.  This is
       "public information": something that any competent investigative
       journalist should have been able to find, had he been put on notice
       of its possible existence.  And I put _CT_ on notice myself.  By the
       same token, the evidence is painfully clear that Bob's "one-time,
       Publications -- rewarding Larson's dishonesty with a contract for the
       sequel to _Dead Air_.  It is about Christian radio station owners,
       like KLTT's Jack Mortenson, who censored the anti-Larson editorial
       written by _Denver Christian News_ editor Joann Bruso.[19] And
       now, it is about respected Christian voices like _CT_ and the
       _Evangelical Press_ -- which evidently have become willing
       complicitors in a scheme to sweep Larson's malfeasance under the
       proverbial rug.  They have exchanged the truth for a lie ... and a
       couple of dollars' change.

       _____________________________________________________________________

         I do expect that you will take further measures appropriate to
       rectify this unfortunate situation -- including, but not limited to,
       the immediate and unconditional dismissal of Morgan, a profuse and
       public apology to both Ms. Boespflug and myself, and the prompt
       publication of a feature article concerning the Larson affair.
       Please be further advised that, should this dispute fail to be
       resolved to my satisfaction, I fully intend to vigorously pursue
       any and all legal remedies at my disposal.
