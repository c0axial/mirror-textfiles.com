                              "The Anti-GREENY!"
                          by Lobo and Seth Sometimes

    (Shit!  It's another tenth file about GREENY!  Who wants to hear about him,
anyway?  Okay, it's not really about him this time!  Hah!)

    First, we must explain that Grene is the source of all power on earth.  She
represents positive emotions and all that is good.  People tend to mistake
Grene's power with what you get when you mix yellow and blue.
Grene is the force that has possessed GREENY to take over the world, and
inspired us to help him.  Grene's powers are weak on the individual mind, but
strong on the collective mind.  This is why we want GREENY to be Emperor more
than he does.  Redd, however, is the destroyer.  He represents all that is evil
and negative.  Grene and Redd have been locked in conflict for millenia.
Grene is the sole purpose we banded together in GwD.  We did not know this until
recently, when Seth the Man and Lobo had visions.  Lobo's vision was of a world
where Grene reigned supreme.  She told him of her plans to make GREENY Emperor
and that that is why he was inspired to suggest GwD to the bbs community.
Seth's vision was different.  His was all about a lust for power.  She told him
that he needed other boards to have power over.  She also advised him to change
his handle to Seth Sometimes (which is from a Cure song that Seth happened to
hear.  Lobo thought that this part of the vision was only a dream or a delusion,
but Seth insisted that Grene had told him to change his handle.)  We would have
notified you sooner, but we did not have these visions until last night, at
12:52:47 am precisely, one year after GwD was founded.  Oh well, now we can go
on to what the file is about.
    Sources have just informed us of the existence of a group whose two purposes
are to make B0b Limekiller Czar of the world and to take our beloved GREENY down
in the process.  We only assume that they will take GwD down with him.  This
evil society calls itself 'The Organization For The Advancement Of B0b
Limekiller' or 'TOFTAOBL'.  What a stupid acronym.  They can't even pick an easy
acronym to say, like GwD.  Well, anyway, they are the forces of Redd, and will
stop at nothing to achieve their goal of making B0b the Czar of the *entire*
world!  They must be stopped!
    For, it has been foreseen for generations that just when The Great Green Guy
and all of the forces of Grene are about to assume control of the world, there
will be a great battle between Grene and Redd.  Yes, it is true.  B0b is none
other than....The Anti-GREENY! (dun dun dun!)  The forces of Redd will march
over the face of the earth, if B0b's evil machinations are not counteracted!
And who else will counteract them but us?  GwD *must* triumph or Grene will lose
in her eternal battle with Redd.

                       ***** The Story of B0b *****
    His mother was the whore.  His father was a man named Karl Willie Johannsen.
Karl was the arch-rival of James "Blewie" Allen, the father of GREENY.  In fact,
Karl had been GREENY's mother's boyfriend before she went out with James.  Well,
anyway, Karl was down on his luck, so he went and got himself the whore.  She
gave him the best night of his life, but she had evil on her mind.  Redd was her
master, and she was using his help on that very night to spawn the only one who
could ever defeat the forces of Grene.  She didn't use protection that night,
and was filled with the spirit of Redd until she became impregnated.  Nine
months later, R0bert Vincent Johannsen was born.  The whore dropped R0bert on
Karl's doorstep.  R0bert, or B0b, as he soon came to be called, was a sad baby.
He shit his pants a lot and pissed in peoples' faces.  He was often spanked by
his dad.  His dad received unwholesome pleasure from this part of B0b's
childhood.  His dad repeatedly threatened to step on him, which is why B0b will
forever have a fear of penny-loafers, which coincidentally, is one of the most
powerful symbols of all that is green and good.  B0b attended Frenship schools
in Lubbock, Texas, where he met GREENY.  Everyone, especially GREENY, taunted
him with the fact that his mother was the whore.  They often filled his locker
with penny-loafers from Pay-Less shoe store, the same brand as his father wore.
How they knew this, no one knew.  But, *we* know that GREENY must have told them
because of his superior intellect and close relations with Grene.  When GREENY
got a computer, B0b got a lineman's headset.  When GREENY put up a board, and it
was just starting to receive callers, it would go down.  We have no proof, but
we believe that B0b's fledgling phreaker skills were what terminated so many
innocent bbses run by GREENY.  Also, local graphiti often contained phrases
having to do with 'B0b Limekiller'.  We all know that 'Limekiller' is a title
meaning 'the destroyer of all that is green and good' bestowed upon only the
most sinister of people by the twisted and evil Redd.  This 'Limekiller' is now
known by GwD spies to be none other than B0b Johannsen, GREENY's evil
counterpart.  B0b Limekiller founded TOFTAOBL, just as GwD was forming for
GREENY.  This is because GREENY does not really want to rule, but B0b is working
to make himself ruler.  GwD must be prepared for the battle that inevitable.  We
can expect no help from GREENY, because he has read gwd10.txt which outlines how
the world will be run when he becomes Emperor, and he does not like the checks
we will put on his power.  Of course, the *final* battle WILL be between GREENY
and B0b, and Grene herself will force GREENY to fight when the time comes, but
until then, we must do our best without him.  Grene will be with us, though.
She loves us.

    We have no fear of B0b or TOFTAOBL reading this file and learning what we
know of them because only one of them has a computer, and he cannot read.  We
will inform you of further developments in the war against TOFTAOBL and its evil
leader, B0b, as soon as anything happens.
