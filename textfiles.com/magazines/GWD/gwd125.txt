As you go into new
places, people, and times
Remember yourself -
a boy who insisted wearing ties in school photos,
who grew into a stubborn black
with long stringy hair
in his face.
And then emerged
a little more wary
but can still play and laugh
with the best of children.

As you go
Remember your friends -
because you were selective
yet open,
choosing those as strange as yourself
with their own beats in their heads
all searching for greener worlds
to dominate.

As you go
Remember your family
who always have your back.
Even when you feel heavy
and can't imagine letting anyone else
carry the weight,
know that you are buoyant
among those who love
your presence in their lives.

As you go
Remember to look back
at those waving good-bye...

[This poem was written by Seth The Man's sister, Trish, and was given to him
as a present when he graduated from college.  We here at GwD are all about the
sentimentality.]
