...yeah yeah, you self-pitying rascals. LISTEN, watchin' "CHiPs" isn't a waste 
of time, it's a golldarn PRIVILEGE. Shit. Watching CHiPs is an INVESTMENT, 
yielding high-dollar psycho-emotional dividends.

Hmm.  I guess no one's arguing that CHiPs isn't an Important Show. But it was
almost implied by the tone of the last couple of files.  So, obviously, I felt
obliged to set the record straight.  Heh.  I guess i'm just over-reacting.
Heh heh.  I mean, no one would SERIOUSLY question the supremacy of CHiPs.
Heh.  What a fool I've been.  I'm sure Officer John Baker would've called me
on this, kinda like the way he called Leif Garret on bein' selfish that time,
even though Leif sorta had a RIGHT to be freakin' out, since that Major Healy
guy who was his manager was just pushing him too darn hard...I mean, it was
always GO GO GO.  And, geez, i mean even Leif has to relax once in a while,
and drive around in his sports coupe and just sorta unwind, it's not a CRIME,
darnit, but Maj. Healy didn't undertand, but Officer Baker ("John") helped him 
understand, and in the end, the Benefit Show was a grand success, thanks to
the rascally "Paunch."
