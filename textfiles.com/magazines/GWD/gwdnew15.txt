                        There's only  _one_ textfile in
                        this release.    Why?   Because
                        it's the biggest, most godawful
                        t-file experience ever!   Well,
                        not quite  *the*  biggest.  The
                        largest  single-issue   release
                        of an e-zine   (to  the best of
                        our knowledge)  is  ANADA  #50,
                        which is 1.5MB.   It's a  bunch
                        of  song  lyrics, though.   The
                        second longest  (again,  to the
                        best of our knowledge)  is  HOE
                        #1110.   At around 600KB,  it's
                        the longest e-zine issue that's
                        *REAL TEXT*  (not song lyrics).
                        GwD #100 is 491KB...it may  not
                        be the biggest, but it's  defi-
                        nitely the most godawful P.O.S.
                        of a  t-file  ever.   You don't
                        believe me?  Read it and see.

-> HEADLINES <-

We've reached issue #100.  Rejoice, have a drink.  Quit your job, have a drink.
Get kicked out by your wife, have a drink.  Go to AA, have a drink.

If your thirst for the word of Grene is not quenched with this monstrosity of a
single-issue release, rest assured that GwD will be releasing many more files by
some of your favorite dr00gs in the near future...the VERY near future.  Stay
tuned, chaches.

-> OTHER NEWS <-

GwD's long association with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will soon
come to an end.  We've lost our seat on the Board of Regents and thus, our
effective control of the campus computer network.  As such, we're soon to lose
our Publications storehouse, gwd.mit.edu. That site will remain active for a few
more days/weeks, but after that time you will have to visit the main site
(www.GREENY.org) in order to read the text for which you yearn.  Fah, like any
of you give a shit.  As long as "The Beat of a Different Drummer" is available
somewhere, there shouldn't be any uprisings.  "Shouldn't" being the operative
word.

-> SUBMISSION INFORMATION <-

If you have ANYTHING to submit to GwD (artwork, text, outlandish claims, etc.),
DO NOT HESITATE to send it our way.  "submit@GREENY.org" is there for you, baby.
Work must be 100% original and it must be understood that once submitted,
articles/artwork/photographs become the property of GwD, Inc. (unless they have
been previously published elsewhere) and we can use them however we see fit,
even if it's merely to make fun of them (and you).

-> LETTERS TO THE EDITOR <-

Got a comment/question/complaint/rant?  Send 'em our way.  editor@GREENY.org is
always waiting for your e-mails.

[All spelling/grammar errors are those of the author(s) and are not errors on
the part of GwD, cuz, well, we're perfect.  Yeah.]
