                            Frequently Posed Queries
 
                              Q=Query -+- A=Answer

Q:  What is this whole GwD thing, anyway?
A:  GwD is a paramilitary fanatical political activist group dedicated to 
    making GREENY, son of the goddess Grene, Emperor of the world. 
   
Q:  So are you political or religious?
A:  We're pseudo-political AND quasi-religious.  After all, politics and
    religion are the same thing.  Pray to the President and vote for God.

Q:  What do you do?
A:  We publish an e-zine and we raise hell.  We used to write stupid programs,
    but we quit.  Basically, we plan for world Domination and we have fun doing
    it.

Q:  Who's Grene? I've never heard of her.
A:  Grene is the Goddess of all that is green and good.  Read _The Book of 
    KeyLime_.

Q:  Are you better than me?
A:  Yes, unless you're in GwD.

Q:  Who's in GwD now?
A:  There is no longer a comprehensive list of members because there are so
    many.  Anyway, the dr00gs (as members are called) don't matter much anyway,
    Unless they have their GwD membership cards, which only a few do.  The real
    power lies with the Propagandists (those who write for us):
                      Yancey Slide (formerly Spanky McDougal, Sir!)
                      Sir Flea  
                      Zippy  
                      Aracnia 
                      Zen 
                      Trojan-Man 
                      fastjack  
                      Bill Hooper 
                      Lasher  
                      Mogel                                 
                      Izzy (the only Propagandist who earned the title for 
                            something other than writing - he is our resident
                            graphics man)
                      K2
                      Carson
    and the GwD High Council, comprised of the Type of Guys
                      Top Worshipper Type of Guy- Lobo
                      Top Dog Type of Guy- Seth The Man
                      Top Organizer Type of Guy- Ratt Fink
                      Worshipper Type of Guy- Diamondback
                      Dog Type of Guy- TransDerm-Nitro
                      Organizer Type of Guy- The Lizard King
    who (with the exception of Ratt Fink and TransDerm) are all Propagandists
    as well.  fastjack is the leader of GwD military forces and GenAerik is
    head of all Special Forces.

Q:  Do members get special priveleges?
A:  Yes, after we assume control, all members will comprise the GwD Council 
    which will handle the day-to-day ruling of the world.  Also, there's a
    health plan.  If you write for us, you are eligible for our dental plan.

Q:  Your handles don't mean anything to me.  Who are you *really*?
A:  Really?  We're just a bunch of high school and/or college geeks who have
    no respective lives so we've come together and we share a collective one.
    The High Council rotates possession of it.  Lobo gets it on Mondays, STM 
    gets it Tuesdays, and so on.  Sunday, it is thrown to whatever Propagandist
    has written most recently.

Q:  Why should I join, other than the special priveleges?
A:  Men:  Chicks dig guys in GwD.  Ladies:  You will learn all about Grene's
    sex-magic that will drive any man insane with lust for you.  Everybody:
    the time for world Domination is now...reserve your seat on the Revolution
    Roller-Coaster NOW!

Q:  How do I join?
A:  Either e-mail Lobo or send mail to our P.O. Box (listed at the end of this
    file) containing one American dollar for your neato-keen membership card.
    You should probably give your name, as well.

Q:  How do I e-mail Lobo?
A:  Lobo can be reached at an47751@anon.pent.fi.

Q:  Why should I care what Lobo's e-mail address is?
A:  He's the editor.  Submit to him.  Submit articles for the 'zine, that is.

Q:  How do I get copies of GwD - the 'zine, of course, not the group itself?
A:  They're available on several BBSes (called Command Centers) and on a few
    ftp sites.  You can write to the P.O. Box and get the issues on disk for
    a small fee.  While you're at it, why not send an SASE and get our mail
    order catalog.  It's chock full of k00l stuff like audio tapes, video 
    tapes, tee-shirts, membership cards, and even stickers.

Q:  Why should I listen to you about anything?
A:  Because we are the self-proclaimed authorities on everything.  You will
    submit to our will, or we will crush your skull beneath the heels of our
    mighty boots like we do with the other infidels.  

Q:  What does "Fight The Power" mean?
A:  The "Power" is whatever's in charge.  The slogan is left over from our
    blatant anti-governmental days.  Basically, it just sounds cool.  It's 
    sort of a bastardization of "Question Authority", which sounds kinda cool
    too.  Hmmm....

Q:  Who the hell do you think you are, anyway?
A:  We're GwD.  Stoopid.
