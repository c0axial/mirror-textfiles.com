                                 "Jack Schitt"

When someone says, "You don't know Jack Schitt"....

Now you'll know the rest of the story!

Jack Schitt is the only son of Aw Schitt and Oh Schitt.  Aw Schitt, the
fertilizer magnate, married Oh Schitt, the owner of Kneedeep Schitt Inn.  Jack
Schitt married Noe Schitt and they produced six children.  Holy Schitt, their
first, passed on shortly after birth.  Next came twin sons, Deep Schitt and Dip
Schitt; then, two daughters, Fulla Schitt and Giva Schitt; and finally another
son, Bull Schitt.  Deep Schitt married Lotta Schitt, and they have a son,
Chicken Schitt.  Fulla Schitt and Giva Schitt married the Happens brothers.  The
Schitt-Happens are:  Dawg Schitt, Byrd Schitt and Horace Schitt.

Bull Schitt just married a spicy number, Peesa Schitt, and they are awaiting the
arrival of Baby Schitt.

*NOW* you know Jack Schitt.

I got this from the same person who gave me "The Yuletide Caper".  Like that
great Christmas file, I have no idea who wrote this, but if I ever find out, YOU
will be the first to know. -Lobo
