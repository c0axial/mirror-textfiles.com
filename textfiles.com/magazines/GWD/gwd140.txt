Once upon a time, there was this guy (or gal, though masculine pronouns will 
be used throughout this text) who sat on his ass all day, playing on his 
computer.  He didn't think of it as playing, but that's what it was.  He read,
mostly.  He read news and he read "blogs."

He also read things called "textfiles" that he found on the web.  Y'see,
there're a lot of groups that publish these things; some call them "e-zines."
Most of them have silly titles that may or may not be abbreviated by sillier
acronyms (e.g. "The Neo-Comintern," "doomed to obscurity (aka dto),"
"Angstmonster," and "GREENY world Domination (aka GwD)").

He read these textfiles.  He followed the musings of 
teens/20-/30-/40-/etc.-somethings about various topics.  Lots of rants, lots 
of whining, lots of crap.  He learned to be an 31337 hax0r; he learned to 
make bombs and to be anti-social.  He read song lyrics; he read crappy poetry.

He read stories by idiots with stupid names like "Aardv@rk."  He didn't do 
much of anything else.

Man, that guy was a tool.

Seriously.
