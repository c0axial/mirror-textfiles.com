                       ***** DRUG LAWS ARE A CRIME! *****

  "Better get down to it. Soldiers are gunning us down."  Neil Young - "Ohio"

 - DRUG PRISONERS HALL of Shame -
*   Will Foster-Father of two, 1st time offender, medical marijuana patient
    suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, convicted of cultivation.  Sentenced to
    93 Years.
*   Douglas Lamar Gray-Disabled Vietnam veteran, one child, sold $900 of
    marijuana to an undercover agent.  Sentenced to Life without Parole.
*   Nicole Richardson-Convicted of conspiracy to distribute LSD because she had
    knowledge of her boyfriend's dealing but had never sold herself.  Sentenced
    to Ten Years without Parole.

 - DRUG FACTS AND STATISTICS -
*   1.7 million Americans are incarcerated in prisons or jails.  1,350,000 are
    drug related prisoners.  Nearly 80% of all prisoners in America are drug law
    related prisoners.
*   "Illegal drugs" kill approximately 5,000 people a year.  The majority are
    heroin addicts killed by unknown or bad quality doses.
*   Drug deaths do not make the top ten list of causes of death in America.
    Check these killers out:
    1.   Alcohol and tobacco-500,000 a year
    2.   Automobiles-45,000 a year
    3.   Workplace accidents-60,000 a year
    4.   Prescription Drugs-100,000 a year
    5.   Marijuana-0 a year

 - Jury Nullification for Drug Prosecutions -
*   The American justice system provides for a defense against unjust and
    immoral laws with the concept of Nullification.  Any jury may decide that a
    law is unjust, set the law aside in the case before them, and free the
    defendant.
*   Drugs laws assault personal rights, thwart the constitution, promote
    violence, bankrupt the justice system, and hand the police dictatorial
    powers.  Jury nullification provides the average citizen the means to fight
    this injustice.  Promote and use jury nullification for drug laws.

 - THE DRUG PROJECT ACTion List -
The Drug Project recommends the following actions to end repressive drug laws:
*   Promote jury nullification - Juries have the right to set aside any law as
    unjust and free the accused person.  Maintain a continual presence at your
    courthouse, handing out flyers explaining jury nullification.
*   Disseminate factual information about illegal drugs - Number of drug deaths
    compared to other causes of death.
*   Pressure legislators to take a stand on the injustice of drug prisoners.
*   Create a presence in the community with the distribution of bumper stickers,
    fund raisers, flyers, and handouts declaring of the injustice of the drug
    war.
*   Support the election of people committed to ending drug laws.
*   Adopt drug prisoners in your communities as "prisoners of conscience".
    Lobby and write letters on their behalf, demanding their release.
*   Confront judges, police officers, and prosecutors by phone, letter, and in
    person, demanding that they stop enforcing drug laws.
