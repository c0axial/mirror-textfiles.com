     Dearest John,
          
               I went to the door today, and the postman delivered a 
          partridge in a pear tree.  What a delightfully thoughful gift!  
          I couldn't have been more surprised.
                                
                             With deepest love and affection,

                             Abigail

     Dearest John,

               Today the postman brought your very sweet gift.  Just
          imagine, two turtle doves!  I'm just delighted at your very
          thoughtful gift.  They are just adorable.

                             All my love,

     Dear John,

               Oh!  Aren't you the extravagant one.  Now I really must
          protest.  I don't deserve such generosity, three french 
          hens!  They are just darling, but I must insist, you've been
          too kind.

                             Love,

                             Abigail

     Dear John,

               Today the postman delivered four calling birds.  Now
          really, they are beautiful, but don't you think enough is
          enough?  You're being too romantic.

                             Affectionately,

                             Abigail

     Dearest John,

               What a surprise!  Today the postman delivered five golden
          rings--one for every finger!  You're just impossible, but I 
          love it.  Frankly, all those squawking birds were getting on   
          my nerves.

                             All my love,

                             Abigail

     Dear John,

               When I opened my door, there were actually six geese a
          laying on my front steps.  So you're back to the birds, huh?
          Those geese are huge!  Where will I ever keep them?  The 
          neighbirs are complaining and I can't sleep through the 
          racket.

               Please stop.

                             Cordially,

                             Abigail

     John,

               What's with you and those fucking birds??  7 swans a
          swimming!  What kind of crappy joke is this?  There's bird
          shit all over the house and they never stop with the 
          racket.  I can't sleep at night and I'm a nervous wreck; 
          it's not funny.  SO stop with those fucking birds.

                             Sincerely yours,

                             Abigail

     OK Buster,

               I think I prefer the birds.  What the hell am I 
          going to do with 8 maids a milking?  It's not enough
          with all these birds and 8 maids a milking, but they
          had to bring those ridiculous cows!!  There is shit
          all over the lawn, and I can't move in my own house.
          Just lay off me, smartass.

                             Abigail

     Hey Shithead,

               What are you?  Some kind of sadist?  Now there's
          9 pipers piping--and Hells Bells, do they play!!
          They have never stopped chasing those maids since they
          got here yesterday morning.  The cows are getting upset
          and they are stepping all over the screeching birds.
          What am I going to do?  The neighbors have started a
          petition to evict me.

                             You'll get yours,

                             Abigail

     Your Rotten Sonofabitch,

               Now there's 10 ladies dancing.  I don't know why
          I even call those sluts ladies.  They've been balling
          those pipers all night long.  Now the cows can't sleep
          and they've got diarrhea.  My living room is a river of
          shit.  The Commissioner of Buildings has subpoened me
          to give cause why the building shouldn't be condemned.

               I'm siccing the police on you.

                             One who means it,

                             Abigail

     Listen Asshole,

               What's with the 11 lords a leaping on those maids
          and ladies?  Some of those broads will never walk again.
          Those pipers have run through the maids, and have been
          committing sodomy with the cows!  All 23 of the birds
          are dead.  They were trampled to death in the orgy.  I
          hope you're satisfied, you rotten vicious swine.

                             Your sworn enemy,

                             Abigail
