                   "Issue #2 of the GwD Task Force Newsletter"
                           by Seth Sometimes and Lobo

        The world has always been run, no matter how subtly, by religions.
Religions have always been sneaky that way. Our early tribes were supposedly run
by the chiefs, but the medicine men were the ones who controlled the chief. Oh
how sneaky. During medieval times, Kings ran the land, but the Pope controlled
the kings. For this reason, among some, there is a great resentment for the
sneaky religious leaders. A day has come however, that will change the
sneakiness!
        Two k-r@d d00ds have stumbled upon the answer to this problem of all
civilization. These d00ds (of whom, I am one) found a personage of such
guileless descension, he could only have come from our goddess of Truth and
Straightforwardness, Grene. (Also his name is GREENY, this clued us in a little
bit too.)
        GwD was founded June 10th 1993, at 12:52:47 A.M. by Seth The Man/Seth
Sometimes and Lobo. All the details of our great religion/task force/emperor-
making were chronicled on our trip to Colorado, so the exact workings out of the
religion spanned 3 states.
        GwD stands for: GREENY world Domination. The first being the man who we
will make into Emperor of the entire world (notice, not Emperor's advisor, or
the Pope, or even the Medicine man...see, straightforward domination). The
second being, well, the world. It's not capitalized, because it's not as
important as GREENY, or GREENY's Domination. The last being GREENY's Domination,
which as I said before is capitalized, because it's GREENY's Domination, if it
was any other domination, it would be lower-case, but seeing as it is GREENY's
domination, it is capitalized.
        GREENY was born naked, just like us all. Saying this, you may think he
is no better than anyone else. You are wrong, for GREENY has been blessed by
Grene. Grene, as I fleetingly mentioned before, is the Goddess of Truth and
Straightforwardness, but She is much more. Grene is the Goddess of Goodness,
Nudity, Plants and All Things Living, Computers, spring time and all other happy
things. Grene has nurtured mankind because She sees the good we can accomplish
in the universe by populating it. So being such a good and happy Goddess, She
chose GREENY to be Her icon upon Earth.
        However, Grene is not the only supreme being in the great green
universe. Redd is the Lord of Lies and Sneakiness. All religions are founded
upon the worship of Redd. You see, Redd is a crafty fellow. He integrated
Himself into mankind's consciousness. Therefore, Redd is the God of Religions,
Telephone Systems, Rocks and all things Inanimate, Clothing, Winter and all sad
things. Redd is evil. He has undermined all of Grene's glorious efforts to save
humanity from itself. He has set Himself up as the God in every church and thus
plans to destroy mankind by pitting us against ourselves.
        Our Lord and Master GREENY will allow us to spend lots of money on a
space program so we can populate the universe. This is Grene's Master Plan for
the human race. She has told Seth and Lobo to make GREENY Emperor, using force
if necessary because GREENY is a reluctant dictator.  Lobo and Seth founded the
GwD Task Force for this purpose because we know that GREENY is strong with the
spirit of Grene, and it would be nearly impossible to subjugate him alone;
that's why we founded the GwD Task Force.
        Just as Grene has Her agent upon the Earth, so does Redd. B0b
Limekiller, the bane of every good droog's existence (a droog is a GwD Task
Force member), is Redd's avatar on Earth. B0b knows that once He has defeated
GREENY he shall be killed, but B0b works for the God of Sadness, so he really
doesn't like his existence anyway. B0b doesn't need his own task force, but he
has one anyway because envy is a part of Redd. His task force is called TOFTAOBL.
We won't go into what that stands for, as you don't need to know. His task force
is composed of morons and generally not intelligent people, because no one with
any intelligence whatsoever would work for the god of depression.
        This whole religion was stumbled upon by Lubbock BBSers. For the short
life of this religion, it has gained many followers. Eventually, we will
succeed, hopefully in this incarnation of GREENY's life. So, if anyone ever
corners you yelling "Porno!" and beating their chest, know that you are not in
danger; you are just being vigorously saluted by a droog.

An earlier incarnation of this file was written by Seth and Lobo for the Lubbock
High School newspaper as a feature story.  Or something like that.

  There're too many droogs who keep changing their handles and I'm too lazy to
             keep up with it all.  No droog list this time.  Sorry.
                  There is a Type of Guy List, though.  Blah.
