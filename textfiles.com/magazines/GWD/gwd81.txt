that'd be kinda cool, to be a deaf mute or something.

Even better, to be retarded and deaf and mute.  But not actually BE those 
things, see, you could just pretend and then you could like sit around 
slobbering on yourself, watching PBS, and people would say, "Oh him?  Don't 
mind him, he's just retarded and deaf and mute."

And people would say "Oh!"  and still try and talk to you, but really slowly 
and offer you losta cookies and insist on tying your shoes for you.
Hey, you wanna tie my shoes, that's ok by me.  Go for it, man.

and then if you could do something, like type or play an instrument, people 
would be amazed and call you an "idiot savant" and you could be on TV and 
stuff with your amazing abilities.

just an example of how things are relative and stuff.  wow.
