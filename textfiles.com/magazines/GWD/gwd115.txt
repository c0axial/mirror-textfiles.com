    Breed_x n' I went to go see a show tonight.  Ended up leaving before the
band started, as they seemed to be some crappy rock band.  We wandered around
a bit on the block or so of the Depot.  Settled on Frank N' Steins, where we
had bad beer and a bad band.  Just your typical local band, playing typical
covers.  At one point I was joking around and threatened to throw Breed's ash
tray if they played a Creed song, and then three songs later they played one.
I'm such a wuss.  They deserved to have an ash tray thrown at them.  The
guitarist really wanted us to stick around, so we did on the condition that
they play no more Creed.  I decided that Creed is actually a plot by the devil
to make christianity look bad.  Anyway.  Music sucked, beer sucked, but there
were tons of hot chicks for which I had no chance with and that Breed had no
real interest in, being happy in his engagement.  Here's some nice quotes that
I overheard between band sets:

"I'm not just any minor, I'm a cute minor"

"I'm old, I'm 22"

    Ok, so my seeing the silliness of that last quote might seem kind of
hypocritical with my last file about feeling old, but I think I understood the
irony of the statement on a level that this guy that I overheard does not.
Anyway.  It was a fun night despite the generic nature of our entertainment.
I'm dj'n tomorrow, and should be free of the playlist, so I'm going to attempt
to do an obscure show.  Play some b-side stuff and just stuff that generally
isn't played.  It will probably suck.
