Ever wondered what porn stars mean by the sounds they make?  Here are some
sexual 'terms' you might find handy:

Approved GwD Terms/Sounds for Fucking
-------------------------------------

"SKLUH" - This is a term for vaginal intercourse.  It can be used as a
substitute for moaning/grunting by the male, e.g. "Skluh...skluh...skluh"
(said with each thrust).

"GLUH" - This term denotes oral sex, specifically fellatio.  For example, when
the girl is choking down that horsecock, she should make a noise that sounds
like "gluh-gluh-gluuuhhhh."

"GLAAAAHHHHHHHHH" - This, my favorite term, is used for male-on-female anal
sex.  This term does not apply to male-male anal sex.  Sorry, faggots.
Lesbians, provided they use strap-ons, may use this term at their own risk.
Proper usage is when the girl is taken by surprise.  A little bit of the old
unexpected backdoor delivery, if you will.  Instead of "Whoops, it slipped,"
one should exclaim "GLLLAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!" at the top of his lungs.

-----

The following terms ARE NOT APPROVED for usage by the powers that be in GwD.

***** USE AT YOUR OWN RISK *****

Deuterocanonical Sex Terms
--------------------------

"SKLAAAAHHHHHHH" - This term is similar to "GLAAAAHHHHHHHHH," only instead of
replacing "Whoops, it slipped," it replaces "Whoops, it slipped from your ass
into your mouth."

"BLAAAAHHHHH" - This is the noise you should make when you plant the
proverbial "money shot" (or "chach shot," as the case may be - see Oscar the
Pornographer's treatise on this matter in gwd86.txt) on your partner's face.

"GLIT" - This should be used after "GLAAAAHHHHH," in much the same method as
one would use "SKLUH," only "GLIT" is said with each thrust of one's member
into the anal cavity.
