Duck, Duck, Goose.

You all remember that game, don't you?  Everyone sits in a circle, then 
someone gets called "Goose."

After that, well, all hell breaks loose...

First, the "Goose" and the other kid run around, trying to tag each other.  
But that's just the beginning.  

What comes next?  Well, first there's the earthquakes.  Then the Volcanoes.
The seas boil.  The Moon crashes into the Earth.  People run around, skin on
fire.  Mass hysteria.

All because of a game.  A damn kids' game.

Maybe I'm thinking of something else.  

Wasn't "Goose" the name of Anthony Edwards's character in _Top Gun_?

Aww, fuck it.
