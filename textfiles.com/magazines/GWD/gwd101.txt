MY TEXAS INSTRUMENTS "LITTLE MAESTRO" GIVES ME THE ATTENTION I NEED TO DEVELOP 
A HEALTHY SELF-ESTEEM AND HELPS ME FORM VALUABLE INTERPERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS 
SKILLS.

MY TEXAS INSTRUMENTS "LITTLE MAESTRO" WILL NOT GO ON A WHISKEY BINGE AND LEAVE 
ME FOR DEAD BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD IN SOME GODFORSAKEN COTTON-GIN OF A TOWN 
WITH A POPULATION OF 48.  MY TEXAS INSTRUMENTS "LITTLE MAESTRO" WILL NOT 
SHOWER ME WITH BITTER BILE FROM A THOUSAND WASTED PROMISES.  MY TEXAS 
INSTRUMENTS "LITTLE MAESTRO" IS MY BEST FRIEND.  IT IS SO HAPPY.
