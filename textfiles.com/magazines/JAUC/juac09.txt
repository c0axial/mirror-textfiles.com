                         REVIEW OF SLIPKNOT 1.0

 By Scott Davis, Editor (dfox@fc.net)

 SLIPKNOT 1.00 By Peter Brooks.
 Tested version 1.00 on a Dell 466/XPS
 16 meg of RAM, Windows for Workgroups
 #9 GXE 64 Pro video card (2 Meg Vram)
 Boca 28.8 Vfast external modem

 On December 23, 1994, I contacted Felix Kramer (felix@panix.com) to let
 him know that I would be happy to run his article/promotion for the
 software called 'SlipKnot'.  At that time, he asked me to ftp the
 software and test it out, and follow up with a review of the software
 in this issue of the magazine.  So, here it is...

 The software was designed by Peter Brooks.  SlipKnot is a graphical
 World-Wide-Web browser for PC users running Windows 3.1+ or a higher level
 of Windows.  It is designed for modem  users with ordinary dial-up UNIX
 shell accounts.  It does NOT require SLIP or PPP or TCP/IP services in any
 form (no TIA or remosock, etc.  if you are familiar with these products).

 The system requirements are Windows 3.1, Windows for Workgroups or
 higher, running in 386 Enhanced Mode (SlipKnot cannot be used on 286
 processors).  Not yet tested with Windows NT. You must have at least
 4 MB of memory, recommended 8MB.  We have noticed memory deficiency
 errors at 4 MB.  Also, at least 2 MB of available hard disk space is
 required.  SlipKnot itself takes approx. 1.5 MB.  When working, SlipKnot's
 job will be to download documents for you from the Internet, and these
 may require plenty of hard disk space.  Mouse or other pointing device
 required (cannot control SlipKnot via only the keyboard).

 Your UNIX system must have either the program "lynx" (version 2.2 or
 later) or the program "www" available.  If in doubt, log in to your
 host, and try to execute either of these programs.  You will then know
 immediately whether they are available.  To find the version of lynx on
 your UNIX host, execute the UNIX command: "lynx -version".

 Your UNIX host must have a program to send files to you via either the
 Xmodem or Ymodem protocol.  The actual name of the programs that perform
 these file transfers changes from system to system, but try the commands
 "sx" (for XModem) or "sb" (for YModem).  If these fail, ask your system
 administrator or some other knowledgeable person.  Likewise, you will
 need to know the name of the UNIX program that will receive files from
 your PC using Xmodem or Ymodem.  Your UNIX system must be able to display
 individual file sizes using the "ls -l filename" command.  If "ls" has
 been renamed or works differently from normal, SlipKnot will fail.

 SlipKnot was created because, at that time, there was no other alternative
 to accessing the World Wide Web graphically if you did not have SLIP or
 PPP or TCP/IP access.  Having analyzed Mosaic and some of its competitors,
 I concluded that all of these browsers were designed for people with very
 rapid communications channels into the Internet, not modem users.  Even if
 you have SLIP access, most of these browsers do not allow you to save
 entire documents (with the included pictures),  forcing you to retrieve the
 documents again whenever you wish to take a full look at them.  It takes a
 while to retrieve any document by modem with any browser, and you shouldn't
 have to do this more than once.

 Now the good stuff:

 First of all, Slipknot is a fantastic idea.  To be able to use the World
 Wide Web and only requiring the end user to maintain a normal account
 on his/her provider is great.  This allows the user to have Web access
 without paying those occasionally high rates for a SLIP or PPP connection.

 I ftp'd the Slipknot software and installed it.  I was very happy that
 it installed without any problems.

 Configuring the software was fairly painless.  The biggest part was
 taking the time to edit the login script for my service provider...
 and that step is not even necessary since Slipknot allows you to
 conduct manual logins of you so choose.

 I was finally ready to dial out. Everything was working like a champ until
 about 10 minutes into my session when my entire system locked up.  I had
 to do a complete shutdown and start over.  No big deal, I thought.
 I attempted again, as the 10 minutes that I did use it was a great
 experience.  I had never seen an application that could do WWW over a
 normal user account.  It connected perfectly and was working fine for
 another few minutes...then it locked up again.  I began to worry.
 I noticed that both times it locked up I was accessing the Federal Bureau
 Of Investigation home page (FBI).  Maybe Slipknot was not compatible with
 sites who promote the Clipper chip...Hahahaha. Not the case, unfortunately.

 During the course of the day, it locked up at random.  I tested my
 computer hardware to see what the issue might be.  There was no hardware
 problem.  My computer has never locked up on my under any circumstances
 before.

 I am not going to give this software a bad review because it locked up
 on my system.  I polled some users on the Internet regarding their
 experiences with the software and here's what some of them said;

 SLIPKNOT version 1.0 really works without a SLIP/PPP acct. In my case it
 installed quite easily, with minimum tweaking (certainly less than to
 install TIA). It opened the WWW to me. Next versions, should have FORMS
 support. That is a must and is urgently needed, because many WWW pages
 contain forms. Other than that, SLIPKNOT is highly recommended for a
 low-budget approach to WWW.   [one@netcom.com]

 =========================================================================

 I find it to be a an incredibly clever idea, and it works quite well
 with direct dial. Some problems with images and sound via telnet/rlogin,
 but not a big problem.  The idea of being able to web-surf without SLIP
 is very attractive, especially for the dial-up user as so many of us are.
 With the "load images" turned off, it is much faster, and you can
 selectively load them. but since it uses Lynx as its engine, why not use
 Lynx for imageless surfing.

 Speed: I compared it to my SLIP account with NCSA Mosaic and Netscape.
 It loads images, etc. a bit slower than Mosaic and a lot slower than
 Netscape.

 Installation and Set up: simple, esp as compared to the fun you can have
 installing say Netscape and all the winsockets stuff, and IP/DNS
 configuring.

 Look and Feel: I'd like a larger document window, but the pulldown menus,
 etc. will make surfing easier for the newbies.

 Overall - a nice, inexpensive alternative to SLIP/PPP, especially for
 those fairly new to the net and like that point and click feel.

 NB: another alternative for an "on the cheap" approach to the Web is The
 Internet Adaptor -- I have it installed in my dial-up unix account, and it
 is slick: it emulates SLIP, and works very well. I'm getting rid of my
 SLIP account because I have TIA. If you have ever set up a SLIP, it is
 pretty easy to install and set-up. If not, you'll spend some time. Cheap
 too.   - Jill Ellsworth <ellswort@tenet.edu>

 =========================================================================

 Very nice and easy to use developmental software.  Web works well and the
 terminal mode is functional and adequate for most users.  everything
 available from your Internet provider can be accessed, just as with a
 full blown commercial package like ProCom, etc.  Some limitations on
 bells and whistles apply.

 Inability to support ftp and gopher from within the html page is a
 bother, but as development continues I hope Peter Brooks will be able to
 add that capability.

 Direct link to obtain upgrades and the automated upgrade installation
 built into Slipknot is a neat touch.

 I am currently using Version 1.00 and have sent in my registration fee
 because I want to encourage continued development.

 I really appreciated the opportunity to evaluate the fully functional
 application.  - Steve Seteroff (seteroff@kendaco.telebyte.com)

 =========================================================================

 You're a brave man to ask for opinions on the Internet!

 I got SlipKnot right after it was released.  It is a wonder.  Last night I
 got the latest version "g".  I am so pleased.  Peter Brooks and Felix
 Kramer (?) have a winner on their hands.  I had tried to install netscape,
 tia, and winsockets about two weeks before I saw the announcement, and
 failed.  The only problems I had in the installation of SlipKnot were ones
 anticipated in the help screens.  (RTFM, dummy!) Peter Brooks was on the
 newsnet answering questions almost 24 hours a day.

 1. Easy to install.
 2. Cheap.
 3. Easy to use.
 4. Fun!

 And all this praise from a DOS command line freak.  I told PBrooks in an
 email that I hate Windoze and had been threatening my son to take it off
 my computer (he uses my printer and MSWord).  I complained to PBrooks that
 now Brendan knew I wouldn't follow through on the threat.  I have an
 indispensable program that needs Windoze.

 Now some cautionary notes.  ...  Sorry I don't have any reservations.
 BTW, I am not Peter's mother, nor do I have any affiliation with anyone
 associated with MicroMind (a moronic name...like, encephalitis, dude!).
 If you have any particular questions, I would be glad to respond.  My
 guess, judging by the activity in WWW newsgroup, is that you'll have more
 response than you can handle.

 Good luck with the story.  Happy holidays.  (BTW I tipped off the LATimes
 computer technology reporter and he just responded that he'd heard about
 it.  Here mosaic applications are bringing the Web to millions and it's
 news, but a shell account enabler is ignored.  Go figure.)  Go SLIP not!

 Mike Howard (mikeh@netcom.com)

 =========================================================================

 I think Peter has a good product. It is still in Beta Version.  For
 example I can not Down Load large files (over 19,456 Bytes).  I am sure
 Peter will find a fix but for now SK is for the experienced user.

 John Hammond (jhammond@unicomp.net)

 =========================================================================

 I found it easy to install; unfortunately it crashes every time I try to
 get something off the web and I must do a hard reboot - thus Dr.Watson
 can save nothing, nor can slipknot's built-in debugger.  I haven't yet
 contacted the authors.

 Bennett Price (bjprice@itsa.ucsf.edu)

 =========================================================================

 I have used SlipKnot for about six weeks and have come to rely on it for
 an easy alternative to mistyped Unix commands. Since I work in a high
 school that does not yet have Internet access, I foresee SlipKnot as a way
 to hook the uninitiated into the 'Net. Teachers and administrators who are
 not already convinced about the utility of the Internet would probably be
 turned off by a Unix command line. Although downloading graphics through
 SlipKnot is slow even at 14.4, for the inexperienced user, this wait time
 is surely preferable to using a straight text-based Web browser.

 While I approve of Version 1.0e as far as it goes, I can certainly suggest
 a number of needed improvements:

 1. gopher support
 2. telnet support
 3. forms support
 4. better resource management (I run SlipKnot on a Pentium with 16 Mb of
    RAM and yet often run low on GDI resources)
 5. improved error handling when the 'Net is busy or a page cannot be found
 6. automatic redial in the terminal mode (Maybe this can be done with a
    script, but I could not see how.)
 7. Z-modem or Y-modem batch transfer support in terminal mode.

 Don't get me wrong. I like SlipKnot. Everything can be improved. I am sure
 at Micromind. they are already at work (at least mentally) on these
 suggestions.

 Jeff Ratliff (tratliff@whale.st.usm.edu)

 =========================================================================

 I have found Slipknot to be a very worthwhile product.  Its ease of
 set-up is a definite plus.  I downloaded Slipknot and had it installed
 and running in a very short time.  The installation instructions
 addressed the few problems I had getting it running and then I was off --
 surfing the Web.  My main dislikes of the software are the small window
 size and the ability to open only five documents at the same time.  I
 understand that these two complaints are being addressed by the next
 version.  If you don't have direct access (i.e. you connect through a
 dial-up shell) and don't have a SLIP or PPP connection, Slipknot is
 definitely worth it.

 Kenyon Jon Michael (mkenyon@jove.acs.unt.edu)

 =========================================================================

 I've been using Slipknot for a while now, and I'm very glad it's
 around. I think it's seriously necessary, because there are a huge
 number of people who get their net.access through shell accounts, and
 this allows you to get a fuller Web experience than with Lynx.

 However, the program has it's problems, and there is a lot of
 advancement that can be made in the future revisions. For example, forms
 are not supported, so your Web use only goes one way; you can't reply
 to things, write mail, make suggestions, etc., or for that matter, be
 verified for logins like on HotWired. That's a huge pain.

 Another problem is the inability to use gopher servers, something
 that's still widely implemented and integrated with the Web. And, of
 course, Slipknot is also a bit buggy; any errors, and the program quits
 rather than moving on, it displays certain dialog boxes more than once in
 a row, etc.

 IOW, it's a good idea and good start for a much-needed program, but it
 still needs work. However, with some more tweaking and advancement, it
 will be a very solid program.

 Bill Pena (billpena@genesis.nred.ma.us)

 =========================================================================

 I got (and paid) for Slipknot, and am currently running v1.0 with the
 "g" patch. My host is a "pay" unix system that I call in to
 get my mail on my "term" account. I am using the program on a
 486 cryix 40mhz system.

 The program is not perfect. It still has some bugs to work out, and
 lots of features to be developed (forms, gopher, etc do not work at
 this time).  But!!! even with though the program is still in its early
 stages of development, I find it VERY useful, and it DOES allow me
 to view http documents with the graphics.

 I get good 14400/v42bis connections via the automatic log-in script (that
 must be user customized) and acceptable download speed of the http. With
 the program running under Windows 3.1, it does take a moment to analyze
 the downloaded text to "find" the embedded graphics, then download the
 graphics, plot the series of files, then display the document.

 With the program currently costing $30, the difference in the cost of my
 term account and a slip/ppp account is a lot more than the cost of
 Slipknot.

 I use the internet for e-mail and netnews more than a place to surf just
 to look at images. As such, my primary access to the net is via term with
 a text editor for mail/news replies.  When I want to check out some
 http/url, I just hang up and call back via Slipknot. I don't use it all
 the time, so when I need it, it is there for me.

 Being shareware, it is perfect for the user to "play" with to determine
 if he/she wants to continue to use it, prior to paying for the program...
 and even with its limitations, it is still a deal at $30. and with the
 authors still working on it, it is sure to get better and better.

 Tom Stangler (stangle@infi.net)

 =========================================================================

 It works as advertised.  Last I checked, it doesn't do forms or telnet
 connection links It has trouble handling some inline images.

 Just like TIA, your provider can tell if you are using SlipKnot, and if
 they wanted to, could ban it's use as going beyond the services provided
 with your class of account.  RCI doesn't have any restrictions on TIA or
 SlipKnot...

 Kevin Kadow (kadokev@rci.ripco.com)

 =========================================================================

 (Slipknot review continued...)

 As you see, we have a wide range of comments here.  I believe that most
 people realize that it still a very young project and has not yet
 attained it's full potential.  If you will note, there was one other
 person who replied to my request for comments who is having the same
 problem I am having with system lock ups.  I mailed the author of the
 program and they are getting right on the issue.

 The bottom line is that Slipknot is a great idea and a nice software
 package.  And with end users submitting comments, complaints, and other
 information directly to the author or the press, the issues will be
 worked out.  I suggest that you keep an eye on Slipknot.  It's really
 going somewhere!

 New things?  Yep.  There's now a Usenet newsgroup for you to discuss the
 All-Powerfulness of cDc.  It's "alt.fan.cult-dead-cow" and if your
 newsfeed isn't getting it, mail news@yersite and say, "GET WITH THE
 PROGRAM, PAL!  HUP HUP!"

 Tell me about the time you were in the 7th grade and had to do a #2 really
 bad and those blind special ed. kids were in the bathroom swinging their
 canes around and saying bad words.  You were SCARED, weren't you.  HA!

 The world is filled with WIMPS.  You go to a large public restroom, into a
 stall.  All the other people in the stalls, you can see their feet.  They
 make no noise.  They sit and wait and clutch their tiny little genitals in
 FEAR.  But I am NOT LIKE THEM.  I MAKE MY DISGUSTING NOISES AS I PLEASE.
 I clean up, I exit my stall, I wash my hands and I LEAVE.  I AM DONE.
 I AM RELIEVED. They remain, cowering, wishing they had the GUTS to CRAP
 but they do not and their bowels TREMBLE with gasses.  They are but
 INSECTS because they cannot CRAP FREELY.  LEARN FROM MY ACTIONS and you
 too can be POWERFUL.

 Lady Carolin is now running the Official cDc Internet Dumpster: ftp or
 gopher to cascade.net for all the cDc stuff, all the time.  Cascade.net
 gets 'em first and fast.  The secondary site is ftp.eff.org as usual.

 The other day I finally got The Beatles' _Abbey Road_ album and this
 "I Want You (She's So Heavy)" song is amazing.  So I'm thinking, why
 should I be concerned with this week's indie-certified alterna-wonder-
 weenie when I DON'T EVEN HAVE A GOOD COPY OF BARRY MANILLOW'S "MANDY"?
 MY 8-TRACK SUFFERS FROM EXTREME WOW AND FLUTTER.

 HOW CAN I EVEN _THINK_ ABOUT JAWBREAKER WHEN MY JACKSON 5 COLLECTION IS

                 MY LETTER TO WIRED  RE: WWW PAGE

 [Editor's note:  I mailed this to Wired...and they said that they would
 print it in the February 1995 issue.  We'll see]

 By Scott Davis (dfox@fc.net)

 Dear Wired,

 I have taken it upon myself to do an informal poll regarding your
 new WWW page on the Internet.  I recall that not so long ago, the
 Wired WWW page was a great thing.  It was easy to use and contained
 a wealth of information.  Now, it appears that one must have some
 type of psudo-government security clearance to get into this WWW page.
 It is my guess that the purpose for having to enter one's name,
 e-mail address, special-secret-multi-digit-code, and other requested
 information is for the purpose of demographics.  No matter the reason
 behind all of this...IS IT WORTH IT?  Please allow me to explain the
 frustrations of some of the net-community.

 In announcing my informal poll, I stated my opinion on the new WWW
 page.  It was not favorable to Wired.  I asked others to mail me their
 opinions also. I will edit some of these for brevity only.  I assure
 you that I did not receive a single good comment about the new page.

 And from what I understand, it seems like that there was some debate
 regarding the creation and operation of the HotWired page.  One
 net-denizen replied to me, "Three weeks ago Jane Metcalfe came to
 UCDavis to talk about Hotwired and to give the first public demo of
 it. She told us that they had debated for quite some time about how
 to set it up--wanting a balance between looking 'friendly' and 'not
 allowing anonymous logins'. Sounds like the balance has tipped a bit
 further than she wanted, given commentary on the net."

 Another frustrated user says, "I gave up after 2 go arounds with the
 login problems. To bad as I liked to read the old hotwired. Oh well, at
 least the magazine is still easy to open!"

 Other comments from disgruntled users include "I am getting nowhere with
 this new interface. Requiring usernames,  passwords, verification codes,
 etc, ad nauseum has not yet induced me to like this new Web page." and
 "Everytime I try to send my Hotwired Account Verification, it goes into
 an endless loop, with the Mosaic icon spinning endlessly.  If this is a
 problem with using the Windows Mosaic 2.0a7 browser, I suggest that Wired
 get rid of the verification, because I'm not getting rid of Mosaic."

 More graphic comments include "Looks like HotWired has become the living,
 throbbing, thrashing (whatever other adverbs they like) pulse of a
 self-important, jargon-speaking, head-up-someplace-where-it-is-very-dark
 entity." and "...not to mention one that has security measures like NORAD!
 People go to www.wired.com for one thing: BACK ISSUES OF WIRED. End of
 story."  And the be-all-end-all comment that fits this WWW page perfectly
 came from an avid reader. He says "I'd have to say this new setup has
 become TIRED before it was ever WIRED..."

 In running a large operation such as Wired, you are going to get
 complaints about "something" all the time.  And as the best publications
 of it's kind, I am sure that you address the issues as much as possible
 ...just as you have this one.  And many of the complaints you receive
 probably carry "less priority" than others.  However I certainly hope
 this does not fall into that category of "less priority".  I could
 understand if maybe 50 or 100 people complained.  But over the past
 several months, I have seen numerous people complain about the
 procedures required to gain access to your WWW page.

 When I first sent my rough draft of this article into Wired, I received
 a polite response from Andrew Anker of Wired Magazine.  He was very
 informative and perhaps his response seemed 'typical' to me because I
 failed to provide him with much of the necessary information that I had
 collected in order to do this article.  I certainly do appreciate his
 response to our concerns. Mr. Anker replied, "...over 20,000 people have
 logged into the HotWired since we launched last Thursday, so it's very
 possible that the people you polled didn't read the text of the intro
 pages into HotWired that explain that certain browsers don't work with
 HotWired."

 Giving Wired the benefit of the doubt and assuming that some browsers may
 not work or could be outdated (which I now know to be true), my next step
 was to get the latest copy of one of the more popular browsers and try
 again. And once again, I ran into more problems.  I was not about to
 attempt to troubleshoot more problems with this WWW page.  I had obtained
 the proper hardware and software to accomplish the task.  It was no longer
 my problem. It's Wired's problem.

 After this last-ditch attempt to prove ourselves wrong in theory and
 technique, one of my close friends stated, "Why the hell are they trying
 to make it so hard to get at? Are they experimenting with someone's
 cockamamie scheme for the Web equivalent of pay-TV?"

 It appears that many people are getting TIRED of this WWW page.
 Many end users do not see the purpose of having to enter all this
 information, and in the end, it causes nothing more than a headache
 when it does not work.  I certainly do not want people to think that
 I am some 'Privacy Hound' who disagrees with the concept of entering
 my personal information on some WWW page.  My name, number and address
 are of public record to anyone who wishes to dial 512-555-1212.
 The fact is that I have spoken to several people who cannot seem
 to get the interface to work.  And I seriously doubt that each of them
 have an ill-configured Moasic.

 Of all the people and companies on the net with Web pages, I would
 venture to assume that Wired, of all people would promote accessibility
 and ease before subjecting it's users to a verification procedure that many
 feel is lacking, to say the least.  I might go so far as to suggest that
 Wired might want to resort back to the good 'ole days and have a WWW page
 that is easily accessible and easy to use.  Including the page where you
 are requesting that the user input information can still remain on the
 WWW site, but make it optional, and don't make it the home page.  You
 can ask people to fill out the requested information.  I am sure that
 many, if not most would comply.  And by switching back, you are opening
 doors for people who may not want to update their software, or just want
 access for a short time obtain specific information.

 As far as updating browsing software, my theory is "if it's not broken,
 don't fix it", and just because somebody can't get on Wired's page, does
 not mean that their software is broken and should be updated.

 I must be honest and admit that I did FINALLY gain access to HotWired.
 Nut not until I had tried every "compatible" version of Mosaic and
 finally was forced to upgrade to NetScape for the sole purpose of
 getting on HotWired.  Was all that necessary?

 Please fix this problem by making Wired easier to access.  We end users
 have to jump through enough obstacles as it is, and there is no point
 in having to do this to get our favorite magazine on our screen.
