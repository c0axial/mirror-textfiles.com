we know you are) then you probably don't need/care to see anything in
the INFO file.
 
    2) NutWorks is now available on TCSSERVE at TCSVM using the SENDME
command.  Yup, we're spreading like the plague.

    And it came to pass that the ART majors were required by their
college to partake of the computer class, so that they would acquire
an education of well-roundedness.
    And the Dean saw that it was good.
    Struggled they, to fathom the computer.  Much documentation did
they read.
    Came they to the final exam.  "Define the following:" was the only
instruction.
    Did they their best.  Here be their answers:
 
 
CPU:      "This  is  the  central  processing  unit  usually
---       pictured above  the memory on the  diagram located
          almost 30 times in my notes."
 
BIT:      "Binary Digit.  Represents either or something but
---       nothing in between."
          "Most machines have 8 bits."
 
B Disk:   "The B disk  is were (sic) all  of our assignments
------    are."
          "This disk  on someone  else's virtual  machine of
          which we can only read the material from."
 
SCRIPT:   "A device which by adding  control words,  you can
------    make an assignment neater."
          "SCRIPT  is  a  format.    You  string  everything
          together to  make nice neat  margins so  you leave
          .fo on."
 
OP SYS:   "An operating system  is a giant program  which is
------    always running  in the  computer and  it runs  the
          computer."
 
VM:       "The virtual machine is physically 'real',  but in
--        terms  of  the  large really  'real'  computer  my
          'machine' is only the  virtual terminal upon which
          I work."
 
HEX:      "Hexadecimal  notation  is  a  spurious  character
---       appearing often in the form of  a period in a line
          of input in your file."
 
BASIC:    "To calculate the total employee  you must add one
-----     to each employee."
 
COMMANDS: "We have to type asterusis in our console file."
--------  "COPY (a variable in a  PLC program) is a location
          where the translated alphabits are stored."
          "The  command Print  fn ft  sends the  file to  my
          virtuous reader."
          "The command L  * SCRIPT (Date means  the names of
          file  on A  disk go  to screen,   using SCRIPT  to
          format on a certain day."
RESUME:   "I  have extreme  competence in  dealing with  the
------    public."
 
GENERAL:  "The computer can help elliviate spelling errors."

    This is the little subscription leaflet that you never see in normal
magazines because it always falls out onto the floor, and lands in the
dog dish.  Notice how ours stays *in* the magazine!  Just another fine
example of the superior quality of NutWorks magazine!
 
    Of the following, which box would you be more likely to check:
 
+--+ YES!  I would LOVE to receive issues of NutWorks magazine at NO
|  | charge!  This IS an amazing deal that I'd have to be positively
+--+ CRAZY to turn down!  I will be anxiously awaiting the arrival of
     each new issue, so please RUSH NutWorks to me as soon as possible!
 
+--+ NO!  I am a complete moron, and a poop-head.  I'm not interested
|  | in your stupid magazine, and if I see it, I'll purge it.  Don't
+--+ ever send me anything.  I hate you.  Bleah!  Pthooey.
 
    If you checked the "YES" box, why don't you send a mail file to the
editorial staff and let us know?  If you checked the "NO" box, you are
a mindless jerk and deserve to be nailed to a tree by your eyelids.

                       Question of the month:
                       =====================
 
           "So, if this Khadaffy guy is such a hot shot,
                    why is he only a Colonel?"
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
                               GENESIS
                               =======
 
        In  the beginning,   IBM  created  the hardware  and  the
     software. And the software was without form, and zeroes were
     upon the face  of the disks.  And the sysgen  moved upon the
     face of the drum.  And IBM said,  "Let there be system," and
     it was "genned".  And IBM saw the system,  and it was buggy.
     And IBM  divided the  light from the  dark,  and  called the
     light OS, and the dark HASP. And the cold start and the warm
     start were the first crash.
 
        And IBM said,  "Let there be a supervisor in the midst of
     core,  and let it divide the  regions from the regions." And
     IBM called the supervisor MVT.  And the cold start,  and the
     warm start were the second crash.
 
        And  IBM  said,  "Let  the  programs  in the  machine  be
     gathered into one  area," and it was so.  And  it called the
     area LINKLIB, and the rest EXTRALIB, and IBM saw that it was
     good.  And IBM said,  "Let  the supervisor bring forth (CLG)
     initiators,  and  the initiators running programs,   and the
     programs yielding output, each to it's own dataset," and IBM
     saw that it was good. And the cold start, and the warm start
     were the third crash.
 
        And IBM  said,  "Let  there be lights  on the  console to
     divide  the wait's  from loops,   and  let them  be for  the
     operators and for the programmers.   And IBM made five great
     lights:  the system light to rule the CPU, the wait light to
     command the operators -- He made the PSW also.  And the cold
     start, and the warm start were the fourth crash.
 
        And IBM said,   "Let the disk bring  forth abundantly the
     utilities that hath bugs,  and  appendages may fly above the
     system  in supervisor  state."  And  IBM created  the  great
     compilers,  and  every subroutine that  runneth and  IBM saw
     that it was good. And the cold start and the warm start were
     the fifth crash.
 
        And  IBM said,   "Let the  core bring  forth the  linkage
     editor  after  it's  kind,   for  object  modules  and  load
     modules," and it was so. And IBM said, "Let us make users in
     our own  image and let them  have dominion over  the readers
     and over the printers and over the disks and over all of the
     system,  and over every bug in HASP that lurketh beneath the
     nucleus." And IBM created the user in His own image, and IBM
     blessed them,  and said,  "Be  fruitful and multiply and add
     and subtract and divide, and fill the queues." And IBM said,
     "Behold,  I have given you every procedure bearing JCL which
     is on the face of the PROCLIB. And IBM saw that it was good.
     And the cold start and the warm start were the sixth crash.
 
        Thus the hardware and the software were finished, and all
     the troubles with them. And on the seventh day IBM unbundled
     the work that it had made,   and rested from producing.  And
     IBM sanctified the  unbundling and blessed it  -- because on
     it, IBM rested and created a larger profit.

                             Shaggy Dogs
                             ===========
 
   (The "answers" to these shaggy dog stories are at the bottom of this
article.)
                             -----------

    Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle, was innocently leaping from tree to
tree one fine day, when a band of crazed cannibals ambushed and killed
him.  They devoured him almost immediately, except for the lining of
his stomach which they stretched over a hollow log to make a bongo drum,
and gave it to the son of the chief cannibal.  The boy was delighted
with his new drum and played it constantly for weeks.  Until one day,
he came crying to his father the chief.  "Daddy," he whimpered, "my
bongo drum rotted away."
    "Son," replied the chief, "you can't play 'Tarzan's Tripe Forever.'"
 
                             -----------

    And then there was the story of the guy who played the harp for the
local orchestra.  After a particularly boring day at orchestra practice,
he and some friends decided to stop in at Sam's Disco for a quick dance
and perhaps a drink or two.  Not wanting to leave his valuable harp in
the car where it could easily get stolen, he brought it into Sam's with
him.
    Well, the "quick drink" soon turned into several rounds, and our
harp player soon began to stagger and yell and cause such a commotion
that Sam had to throw him out of the disco and send him home.
    He awoke the next morning, his head pounding, and slowly began to
dress for orchestra practice.  As he was about to leave, he discovered
that his harp, his pride and joy, was missing.  "Oh no!" he gasped.
And with a deep sigh, he began to sing, "I left my harrrrrrp...
in Sam's damn discooooooo..."
 
                             -----------
III.
    Long time ago, there lived great Indian warrior named Shortcake.
Shortcake in love with Squaw who lived on other side of great river.
Many moons, him sit on bank of great river, watching Squaw who sit on
other side.  Many times, him decide to swim across great river, but him
coward.  Him build boat and paddle.  But boat sink, and him die.
    Squaw jump in water and drag out body of Shortcake.  And then,
'Squaw bury Shortcake.'

    Roy Rodgers was so delighted with his new pair of cowboy boots
that he walked into town to show them off.  But on the way into
town, a cougar jumped out from behind a bush and attacked him.  Roy
tried his best to escape from the cougar, but his new boots weren't
broken in yet and their stiffness made it hard for him to run.  Regret-
fully, he pulled them off and ran away without them.  The cougar was
overjoyed at this, and it tore the discarded boots to shreds.
    Roy, now very angry at the loss of his prize boots, went home, took
out his shotgun, and went looking for that cougar.
    When he returned, the dead cougar slung over his shoulder, his wife
met him at the door.  When she saw the cougar, she said, "Pardon me
Roy, is that the cat who chewed your new shoes?"
 
                             -----------

    When the first team of explorers landed on Planet X, they found that
the inhabitants were nothing more than little balls of fur with arms and
legs.  The explorers called the creatures "Furries" and soon found that
the Furries were very adept at manufacturing things.  Whenever the
explorers needed anything, they just had to go look, and most assuredly
there was a Furry somewhere who produced it.  But the Furries all looked
alike, so, to make it easy for the explorers, each of the Furries wore
his particular product on the top of his head.  The Furry who sold
radios had a radio on top; the one who made dishes had a dish on top;
and so forth.
    One day, one of the explorers, a diabetic, ran frantically into
the explorers' headquarters.  "My needle broke!" he cried, "How will
I ever be able to take my insulin!?"
    The others, unconcerned, sang to him:
 
       "If you need those drugs in a hurry,
        It's okay, no sweat, don't worry,
        Just go see that cute little 'Furry with the Syringe on top...'

                 And now, a news flash from the world
                        of Heavy Metal Rock.
                 ====================================
 
    Dateline Hollywood:  In a brief news conference today at Ripgore
Recording Studios, it was announced that yet another benefit concert
will be held in April to aid the starving masses in Etheopia.  This
time, the contributing groups will all be Heavy Metal bands.  But what
will make this concert different is, instead of performing one after
the other, the participating bands will all play on the same stage
simultaneously.  Furthermore, all the bands will each be performing
different songs, again, simultaneously.  The reason for this unprece-
dented schedule was not given, but one of the participating artists
said that it would be a "stimulating experience."
    The concert, dubbed "Twisted-Helical-Iron-Scorpion-Rat's-AC/DC-
Maiden-Sister's-Leopard-Kiss--Aid", was tentatively scheduled to be
held in Omaha, Nebraska, but due to the local zoning laws forbidding
any noise exceeding 250,000 decibels, the location was changed to The
Sea of Copernicus, the Moon.  The concert will NOT be broadcast via
satellite, as it will easily be heard at every point in the known
universe.

Secret Service benefit supper...............Presidential Aid
American Medical Association luncheon.......First Aid
