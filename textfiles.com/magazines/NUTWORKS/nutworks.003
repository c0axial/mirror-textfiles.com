          ==  "To Whose Moral Majority Do YOU Belong ??"  ==
 
         Fundamentalists are aggravating computer evolution.
 
   Mankind, as a race, is forever adopting new attitudes, new "ways of
doing things."  If a function is performed  in the same manner for any
reasonable amount of  time,  the means through which it  has been per-
performed will surely  be altered in some   way as to make  the entire
situation seem  different and new.    This is exemplified  by entities
such  as  constantly  changing  styles  of  dresswear,   the  physical
appearance of automobiles,   and the frequent passage  of "fads."  For
the most part,   though,  there are a  finite number of ways  in which
things can  feasibly be changed.   That  is,  once something  has been
altered  a  certain  number  of  times,   there  are  simply  no  more
possibilities left for change.   As a result, patterns of change begin
to form cycles.   We do function X in manner A; soon, A becomes boring
so we advance to manner B; realizing that B is equally mundane, we see
manner  A   as  being  the   best  way   after  all  and   once  again
advance(/revert(?))  to doing function X the  way we did before.   The
cycle continues, in time, ad absurdum.
   Ever  since  binary_1  was  added with  binary_1  to  result  quite
properly  in  binary_2  by  the roomfull  of  machinery  named  ENIAC,
computers have  by far been the  most consistent creatures  of change.
Moreover,  the attitudes  held by those responsible  for directing and
managing the use of computer facilities have done the same.  And these
attitudes are the very type which eternally change in unending cycles.
   One fine day,   someone wearing Coke-bottle eye-glasses  and a long
white lab  coat--in the pocket of  which he kept several  thousand ink
pens-- said,  "Holy catfish!" and went on  to explain at length how he
had figured that  if THIS computer were rigged up  with THAT computer,
the two  could be "linked" so  that folks using either  computer could
interact with one another.  And so began the glorious days of computer
communication...  The days  when operations managers boasted  of their
ability to  send and  receive files to  and from  half way  across the
country...   The days  when System  Programmers  worked diligently  on
producing  CHAT machines...   And  on the  eighth  day,  Man  invented
computer network links, and man saw the network that it was good...
   The   fact   that   the  "Computer   System   Alpha-Numeric   Logon
Identification  Code" is  much  more  realisticly called  an  "account
number" stems from  the inevitable change that began to  take place in
proportion with the  availability of computer services  to the public.
Those  people whose  minds  are  geared to  do  so  started to  ponder
questions  of   payment.    Operations  Managers,    Computing  Center
Directors, they are all good people.  For the most part, they are very
intelligent and  truly concerned about the  needs of their  system and
those who make use  of it.   And they all have  superiors to whom they
must answer and from whom they obtain funding.
   The fascination with  communication via computer networks  has long
since dwindled in the minds of those who pay for it.   The trend among
them lately  is to  closely monitor,  if  not restrict  computer usage
which they feel  to be nonproductive or unnecessary.    In many cases,
this includes  any and  all participation  in electronic  conferencing
(chatting), making use of system printers for anything other than true
blue output (in  the programming sense of  the word),  and the  use of
file sending/receiving capabilities  for anything other than  mail and
batch processing.  This magazine, of course, is in violation of that.
   These people  have legitimate  complaints.   Someone  out there  is
paying for  vast amounts of  CPU time,   and that someone  should have
every right to be sure that his money is not being wasted.  It is also
completely  up  to that  someone  to  decide  just what  qualifies  as
"waste".
   Perhaps the problems with restrictions would be alleviated if users
paid  for their own machines.   Students and employees could be issued
machines for  classwork and  work-work respectively.    These machines
could be monitored  and restricted from any  unnecessary usage.   Each
person could have the option of  purchasing ANOTHER machine to be used
for anything  else.   Users who  wanted to  do things other  than that
which was deemed "necessary" would be free  to do so on their very own
accounts.  Many centers offer a limited number of logon id's to anyone
who requests one,   for a modest price.    Many people on the  Net are
already paying to be there.
   It's  difficult to  speculate whether  these restrictive  attitudes
will fall into the cycle of recurrence.   In a few years,  as computer
time becomes less expensive, perhaps the restrictive grip will loosen.
Or perhaps things will worsen until the  web of the network is severed
completely at the cutting hands of those who no longer support it.

          COMPUTER COMMUNICATION: DEVELOPMENT OR DISEASE?
 
            BY MARVIN RAAB    xxxxx@xxxxxx    FEB 20 1985
   Having majored in  communication arts with computer  and journalism
background (not to  mention being a ''ferret''),  I'd  like to discuss
the latest craze to sweep not only the United States,  but a number of
other countries as well.  This craze, although it has yet to be linked
to cancer,  affects it's victims with  symptoms such as lack of sleep,
greater telephone usage,   greater typing speed and  accuracy,  and an
emotional attachment to a person or  group of persons which the victim
has never met.
   You guessed it: BITNET/EARNET CHATTING.  Victims of this relatively
new affliction are known as BITNAUTS. No one knows the exact number of
BITNAUTS since many of them do not wish to declare themselves as such,
but estimates  range from  500-1500.  The  typical BITNAUT  is a  male
college student between the ages of 17 and 25.  His grades are average
and he is extremely computer  literate.  These statistics were derived
solely from observation and they do not describe EVERY bitnaut.  There
are Bitnauts of every age,   sex,  race,  educational background,  and
career goals.
   Let's  examine   the  facets  to   Chatting.   For   this  article,
''chatting'' refers  to one-on-one discussions  as well  as electronic
conferencing.
   The Basics:  Almost everyone at most of the 200 nodes has access to
BITNET.   Most nodes have over 500 users of which 200 are logged on at
any one time.   Doing some quick math,  we find that 40,000 people are
logged on at any one time.  Of course,  time zones come into play here
add,  while CUNYVM may have 250 people logged on at 8pm EST,  WEIZMANN
may have  only 10  at that hour.   In any  case,  there  are literally
thousands of people logged on at any  one time;  each one of them able
to communicate with any other; relatively free of charge.
   After the  original novelty  of talking to  someone who  is sitting
many  miles   away  diminishes,   semi-serious   conversation  occurs.
Schoolwork  and leisure  activities  are the  common  topics.  If  the
Bitnauts continue at  this rate for more  than a few days,   they will
usually become  closer friends and  discuss items which  close friends
usually discuss (personal problems, serious political beliefs, etc.)
   Electronic conferencing  is slightly  different.  The  Bitnauts are
familiar to eachother.  An individual's unique nickname along with his
chatting  technique  contribute  to  bonds  between  chatters.   These
chatters will usually extend their newly found friendship to the level
of one-on-one in the following weeks.
   Electronic conferencing also serves the  need for ''company''.  How
many chatters actually think they hear  the voices of the others while
reading the screen?   The more lines of conversation,   the louder the
little voice in your head reads.  In addition, no one can see you.  If
you are  the ugliest  person in your  city,  no  one will  know.  This
provides an excellent opportunity to the otherwise shy individual. For
the obnoxious individual,  electronic conferencing  is also ideal.  He
can talk (type)  while others are also typing and no one needs to wait
till someone else finishes his sentence.
   The extroverted individual  is also given the chance  of a lifetime
since he has a captive audience. Females are able to openly flirt with
strangers  where  they  are  normally  prohibited  from  doing  so  in
contemporary society.   Males are provided  access to girls like never
before.
   One would never go up to a stranger  in the street and ask what the
weather is like in  a particular city.  If he did,   he would be given
ridiculous  stares and  be  greatly  embarrassed.  BITNET,   with  its
characteristic of almost total anonymity, allows us to cross the bound-
ary of embarrassment. (When was the last time you were  embarrassed on
BITNET?)
   The CPQ  NAMES command greatly  resembles a  conventional telephone
directory. The major difference between that book and the command lies
in the  intrinsic recognition of ID's  or BITNET addresses.  An  id of
CS11124@ANYWHERE announces to  the BITNAUT that the user  is a student
taking computer science,  probably the first class in the field.  This
is quite different from seeing J. Doe  15-15 Cherry Street.
   Another analogy to  telephone calls is the  instinctive response to
an unknown caller, "Sorry, wrong number" and the receiver hangs up the
phone.   Using BITNET however,  receiving a message from an unknown ID
will yield opposite results.  The fear of a "crank call" is eliminated
and a  conversation often  results unless  of course  the receiver  is
preoccupied).
   A  major  flaw in  BITNET  relationships  is  the obvious  lack  of
physical contact.  Eye contact is very essential to the development of
friendships.    BITNAUTS  have  succeeded in  remedying  this  to  the
greatest possible extent.   The smile (  :-)  ),  the kiss (**kiss**),
the simulated laughter  (tee hee,  hee hee)  and many  others serve to
paint an accurate  picture of nonverbal communication in  the minds of
the receivers.  However,  the lack of close proxemics never leaves the
conscious thoughts.
   In any system of human interaction,  soap opera situations develop,
and BITNET is not immune.  There are countless situations of this type
occuring between BITNAUTS at any time and they have become the threads
to  the fabric  of  the BITNET  society.  As  the  number of  BITNAUTS
increases,  so will the number of characters in these soaps as well as
the number of these soaps.
   Another  observation  relates  to   actual  meetings  of  Bitnauts.
Sometimes it clicks and sometimes it  doesn't.  There is absolutely no
possible way  to predict  which relationship  will retain  and further
develop it's on-line roots, and which will wither away.
   BITNAUTS from North America are unlikely to meet their counterparts
in other countries, although a few travellers will have this pleasure.
However, one must consider the plight of BITNAUTS from the west coast.
The majority of nodes are within 1000  miles of the Atlantic Ocean and
almost all are  within 2-8 hours driving time  from neighboring nodes.
This has resulted in many meetings,  not to mention the convention(s).
How do the BITNAUTS from the State of California feel about this?
   The results (positive as well as negative)  of BITNET relations has
yet to  be seen.  There are  undoubtedly dangers involved  (imagine an
emotionally unstable  BITNAUT)  but  to restrict  users at  nodes from
BITNET use is not the answer.  BITNET has become an important addition
to the  lives of college students  of this world,  just  as television
entered the lives  of society almost 50  years ago.  And just  as that
medium has had it's share of  problems and positive products,  so will
computer networks.   What better  way to start  than with  the college
students of the world?
                        =====================
 
                             ** A Joke **
 
   (Try not to fall out of your chair over this one... go on, try.)
   There was,  in  Italy,  a certain vampire,  looking for  a place to
live.  He finally settled upon a bridge between two cities, since the
heavy foot  traffic would make  it very easy  for him to  find victims
when he was hungry.
   Several weeks passed....the vampire was taking young women from the
bridge,  drinking their blood,  and throwing them over the side of the
bridge.   Strangely, though, there had been no outcry over the missing
girls or any kind  of search for them.   The vampire  began to wonder,
what happened to the bodies after he threw them over the bridge?
   So,  the next time  he took a woman from the  bridge and tossed her
over the  side,  he looked  over to see  what happened to  her.   Very
shortly, a large troll came out from under the bridge,  slung the girl
over his shoulder, and walked away, singing "Drained Wops Keep Falling
on my Head".....

   their FIRST names secret?? (Mr. X, I mean you!!)
 Why do people from halfway across the continent
   include their phone numbers on their Bitnet mail??
 Am I supposed to call them???
 Does Bitnet mail cost 22 cents now?
 Speaking of cents, why doesn't my keyboard have a
   cents sign???
 When a link is disconnected, why does your own node
   always blame it on the other guy??
 Why is there a LOGMSG if all it ever says is:
   TYPE NEWS FOR SYSTEM INFORMATION   ???
 Is software tangible or intangible??
 Why does VMBACKUP take longer than recreating all
   your files from scratch??
 Why doesn't the virtually impossible machine at CUNYVM
   save a copy of the file I was editing when it crashed???
   (WYLBUR does!!!)
 Does anyone use CP?  Does anyone care??
 If CUNYVM does accounting twice daily, why does my
   account balance remain the same for a week???
 Why the hell am I asking you all this???

Hypotheses:
1. Fields are a maximum of 6 characters long.
   rejected; 'CHICKEN' extends into column 7.
2. Whoever programmed the system can't spell properly.
   rejected; Burger King management would damn well make sure that the
names of their products were spelled correctly.  Also, other anomalies
exist, i.e., the blanks in the words "ONLY" and "RETURN," and the left
margin is ragged.
3.  Burger  King cash registers can  only print certain  characters in
certain  columns,  forcing  the  odd spelling  and  odd format.   This
hypothesis seems to  have the most merit.  The  original receipt shows
that  the  printing  mechanism  prints  characters  from  fully-formed
images,  not  in a dot-matrix form.   Thus we can visualize  the print
mechanism as consisting of a rotating wheel for each column.  Since to
fit all 36 alphamers on each wheel  would probably give them too great
a diameter to be practical,  only a selected subset of the letters are
put on each wheel,  and the spelling and positioning of the item names
has to be adjusted to fit this scheme.
   It would  appear that Burger  King even  chooses the names  for new
products  with the  design  of their  cash  registers  in mind.    For
example,  their fish sandwich is called the "Whaler",  which is easily
printed using the W, H,  E,  and R from 'WHOPER',  the A from 'EAT IN'
and the 'L'  from 'ONL Y'.  However,   it could just have  easily been
called 'FISH' by taking the F in 'FRIES',  the I in 'DIET',  and the S
and H from 'CASH', so it appears that even this hypothesis is a little
weak.
   Any  other hypotheses  and  further research  by  readers would  be
welcomed.

Subject:   The reason why WHOPPER is spelled WHOPER.
To:        Brent C.J. Britton <BRENT@MAINE>
From:      Barry D. Gates <xxxxxxx@MAINE>
Date:      Fri, 1 Mar 1985 04:53 EST
 
   It has come to my attention that  a great furor has been aroused in
the field of  computer academia over the spelling of  the word WHOPPER
on receipts from Burger King.   First of all, it should be pointed out
that I do not, as a normal matter of habit,  frequent such substandard
eateries as this when a choice does  exist,  but at one occasion I did
happen to stop into one of fast food establishments with several of my
academic colleagues during this past summer  and we happened to notice
these strange encryptic printouts.
   After  staring at  these  strange writings  for  a  few minutes  we
noticed the similarity  between our cash receipts and  xediting a file
that had  been sent  from a  Vax (small  mainframe computer,   usually
dedicated to tasks such  as graphics which deserve to be  done on such
machines) using the SEND/FILE/BINARY command.  The Vax, as most of you
should  know,  communicates  with  an extended  version  of the  ASCII
character set,  whereas the IBM uses  the EBCDIC character set.   This
translation  from one  set to  another  allows some  characters to  be
translated the into gibberish,  others into different characters,  and
still others to remain unchanged.
   It is from this observation that I was able to determine the reason
for  the  strange  and  somewhat  cryptic  spellings  on  Burger  King
receipts.  As you all know,  the EBCDIC character set is the successor
to an older character set called BCD.  This BCD character set was used
by IBM in its computers back in  the late 1950s/early 1960s in the IBM
1400-series computers.   From a back  issue of the Scientific American
(December 1962 to  be exact),  I discovered  a company by the  name of
Inter-Code Business Machine Company who had  built an extension to the
BCD character set for use in their computer,  the SS-20.   The company
was declared bankrupt after selling less  than 12 computers,  and they
were left with over 12,000 more of these machines in stock.   The name
of their character set was called BCDCB.    One of the best aspects of
their computer was that it was all capable of being housed in a box no
larger than a terminal.
   At the same time that ICBM was going bankrupt, Burger King had just
come into the fast food market and was in need of tax shelters.   In a
deal  to help  pay  ICBM's creditors,   they  agreed  to purchase  the
remaining stock  of SS-20s  from ICBM for  the cost  of $20  (a dollar
could buy a lot more back in the old days).   As time went on,  Burger
King never  really did  anything with their  $20 investment,   and the
SS-20s remained stockpiled in one of Burger King's wharehouses.
       ----- Then came the age of Computerized Cash Registers! -----
   Burger King  was in bad economic  straights back in 1973  when they
were  losing  massive  numbers  of   customers  to  an  Irish-American
hamburger chain (which shall also remain nameless).   They also wished
to get some new electronic cash registers for their counters.   An old
janitor at Burger King happened to stumble  on the old SS-20s one day,
and one of  the head programmers at  Burger King came up  with a great
idea.   Why not take an old SS-20,   put an aluminum box around it and
put a keypad  on top and use the  device as a cash  register (you will
remember that ICBM was ahead of its time in making computers small).
   The idea worked;  it worked fabulously in fact.   However,  several
years later they decided to add a  receipt printer to the whole combo.
Here is where  our trouble is.   As  I had mentioned before,   BCD and
BCDCB were not quite the same.   Burger King, however, did not realize
this until after they had bought  the 12,000 BCD receipt printers they
thought they needed.   They also did not realize this fact until after
they had mounted all 12,000 printers onto their cash registers.
   The SS-20s  had a  rather odd  character-out routine,   which would
switch to graphics mode whenever to  identical characters were sent in
succession.   The letter 'R' also  could cause problems,  because that
was  how you  returned from  graphics mode  back into  text mode  (the
process  of converting  back  to text  mode is  rather  slow on  these
machines however,  and usually takes about as much time as it takes to
send another 5 characters).
   So,  as you can see the word  WHOPPER is actually what the SS-20 is
printing,  but  the second  'P' would  put the  SS-20s normal  display
device (the GLCM)  into graphics mode.    Since a receipt printer does
not have a  graphics mode,  it just  ignores the strange code  it gets
entirely.   The second problem I just  mentioned also explains why the
string 'FRENCH  FRIES' appears  as 'FFRIES' on  a Burger  King receipt
tape.
   I have, over this past break,  worked out the translation code from
BCDCB into either BCD,  EBCDIC or  ASCII.   If anyone should happen to
want this program,  I will be glad  to send the source code along.   I
also have  developed the  code to  make a  Visual 550  act as  a GLCM.
Together,  these are the start of a really excellent graphics package.
If you wish to know how to make your Vs550 act as a GLCM,  please give
me a call  and I will drive  to your installation and  personally give
your Visual it's 'test flight'.
   Oh,  well.  I have to run now.   I hope this clears up any problems
that might have developed.
Later, Barry...

                Meanwhile,  Back at the Ranch  --  Part I
 
As the Lone Ranger  rode down the gully he felt  a shiver of impending
doom run down his spine to the very roots of his ingrown toenails.  As
he turned the corner on a narrow bend in the horse track, he yelled in
fear as  great black  swarms of  bats smoking  Rum and  Tapioka Cigars
descended in a rush.
                            **************
   Meanwhile,  back at the ranch,  Goldilocks roused sleepily from bed
and shuffled downstairs, pulling on a thin robe as she went.   Much to
her surprise she  discovered a band of rowdy,  foul  orcs making short
work of  what remained in the  larder.  She screamed daintily  and ran
toward the living room, the loose folds of her robe flapping about her
rather well-developed  physique,  pursued by  12 Orcs who  had decided
they had  found something  better to  eat than  powdered cake  mix and
instant coffee.
                            **************
   Meanwhile, in an old slum tenement house deep in the thriving urban
center of New York, Illinois,  Marvin Teeble decided he had had enough
of crime  and rape and  began waging his  private war by  shorting the
blind newspaper man 15 cents.
                            **************
   Meanwhile,   back in  the gully,   TLR was  slowly recovering  from
various venomous bites and several cigar-burns, shook his muddled head
and rose shakily  to his feet.   It  had been a rough  fight,  but the
Goodie-Goodies always win.  It was then he noticed Butch Cavendish and
twenty top marksmen, all aiming assorted deadly weaponry in his general
direction.    "Looks like  it's going  to be  one of  those days,"  he
thought wearily.
                            **************
   Meanwhile,  back at the ranch,   three large and ill-disposed bears
walked in on the scene in the living room.   Yelling with rage,  fury,
and  lust,    they  waded  into  the   midst  of  the   orcs  slashing
indiscriminately  at  vital  areas.   The  ensuing  confusion  allowed
Goldilocks, tired but satisfied,  to make good her escape out the back
door unnoticed,   covered with  blood and  various parts  of orcs  who
wouldn't be needing them anymore anyway.

                          Hackers Take Note!
 
Below is  an IBM product  announcement that I  have cooked up  that is
becoming quite popular within IBM.
TITLE     VIRTUAL MACHINE / EXTENDED MIGRATION AID SYSTEM (VM/XMAS)
ABSTRACT       The IBM Extended Migration Aid System (VM/XMAS), along
      with the newly announced System Advanced Network Tailoring
      Architecture (SANTA), is the new base for all Extended Architecture
      developments and is to become the only supported VM system.
OVERVIEW    VM/XMAS, on a triadic processor, allows a production MVS/XA
      to be run, while keeping idle 70% of the total processor.  System
      analysis screens will display 100% busy so that you can claim
      that you need a larger CPU.  This is accomplished via the new
      370 instruction, Start Increased Execution (SIE) which will cause
      all instructions to take approximately 60% longer (individual
      benchmarks may vary according to the tailored load of your system).
      VM/XMAS HILIGHTS
      o   Automatic PSAR submission via RSF.  PSAR submission will
          occur whenever the system recognizes that is has supplied
          an INCORROUT reply to a user.
      o   Support for full-duplex ASCII terminals.  Users must learn
          to type in reverse ASCII in order to use this new function.
          3270 will currently still be supported but may be removed
          at any given time in the future.
      o   Randomization after failure mode.  Dumps are considered
          too boring, so this added function allows the system
          maintainer to determine how much randomization occurs
          between the time VM/XMAS fails and between the time it
          produces a dump.  IBM Internal Use documentation suggests
          that a randomization factor higher than 10% maybe hazardous
          to the system programmers health.
      o   Hierarchical dump file system.  Work is currently under
          way for a dump file retrieval facility.  System planners
          are suggested to allocate a bank of 3380's for the
          hierarchical dump file system.
      o   Ability to upgrade to a Cray XMP.  Program testing is
          under way to see whether this will indeed work as stated.
      o   Variable resource accounting.  This means that it is
          variable whether VM/XMAS will do resource accounting.

                          IMPURE MATHEMATICS
 
   Wherein it  is related how that  paragon of womanly  virtue,  young
Polly Nomial  (our heroine),   is accosted  by the  notorious villian,
Curly Pi, and factored (oh, Horror!).
   Once Upon a time (1/t),  pretty Polly Nomial was strolling across a
field  of vectors  when  she  came to  the  boundary  of a  singular
matrix..   Now Polly  was convergent  and her  mother had  made it  an
absolute condition  that she  never enter  such an  array without  her
brackets on.    Polly,  however,  who  had changed her  variables that
morning  and was  feeling particularly  badly  behaved,  ignored  this
condition on the basis that is was  insufficient,  and make her way in
among the complex elements.   Rows and  columns closed in on here from
all sides.   Tangents approached her  surface.   She became tensor and
tensor.   Quite suddenly, two branches of a hyperbola touched her at a
single point.   She oscillated violently, lost all sense of directrix,
and went completely divergent.   As she  reached a turning point,  she
tripped  over a  square  root that  was protruding  from  the erf  and
plunged headlong  down a steep gradient.    When she rounded  off once
more, she found herself inverted, apparently aline, in a non-euclidian
space.
   She was being watched,  however.   That smooth operator,  Curly Pi,
was  lurking innerproduct.    As  his  eyes devoured  her  curvilinear
coordinates, a singular expression crossed his face,  He wondered, was
she still  convergent?   He decided  to integrate improperly  at once,
Hearing a common  fraction behind her,  Polly rotated and  saw Curly Pi
approaching with his power series extrapolated.. She could see at once
by his degenerate  conic and dissipative terms  that he was bent  on no
good,
   'Arcsinh', she gasped.
   'Ho, Ho,' he said.  'What a symmetric little asymptote you have.  I
can see your angels have a lit of secs.'
   'Oh sir,' she  protested.   'Keep away from me.   I  haven't got my
brackets on.'
   'Calm yourself,  my dear.'  said  our suave operator.   'Your fears
are purely imaginary.'
   'I...I' she thought.  'Perhaps he's not normal but homologous.'
   'What order are you?' the brute demanded.
    'Seventeen.' replied Polly.
    Curly leared, 'I suppose you've never been operated on.'
   'Of course  not,' Polly replied  quite properly.    'I'm absolutely
convergent.'
   'Come, come,' said Curly.   'Let's go to a decimal place I know and
I'll take you to the limit.'
   'Never!' gasped Polly.
   'Abscissa.' he swore, using the vilest oath he know.   His patience
was gone.   Cohsing her over the coefficient  with a log until she was
powerless,   Curly removed  her discontinuities.    He  stared at  her
significant places, and began smoothing out her points of inflection.
   Poor Polly.   The  algorithmic method was now her  only hope.   She
felt his hand tending to her asymptotic limit,   Her convergence would
soon be gone forever!
   There was no mercy,  for Curly was a heavysided operator.   Curly's
radius squared  itself.   Polly's  loci quivered.    He integrated  by
parts,  he integrated by partial fractions.   After he cofactored,  he
performed Runge-Kutta on  here.   The complex beast even  went all the
way around  and did a contour  integration.   Curly went  on operation
until he  had satisfied her  hypothesis.   Then  he  exponentiated and
became completely orthogonal.
   When Polly got home that night,  her mother noticed that she was no
longer  piecewise continuous,    and  had  been truncated  in  several
places,  But is was too late to differentiate now.   As the months went
by, Polly's denominator increased monotonically,   Finally she went to
L'hospital and generated a small  but pathological function which left
surds all over the place and drove Polly to deviation.
   The moral of our sad story is this:
           'If you want to keep your expressions convergent,
             never allow them a single degree of freedom.'
