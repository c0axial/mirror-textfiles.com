    When Joan Rivers cancelled her "Tonight Show" monologue on the
evening of January 28, it was because joviality and laughter seemed
so inappropriate in the shadow of the Space Shuttle disaster.  That
day, the world did not laugh; it wept and prayed for the astronauts
who were lost, and it mourned with their families.
 
    There is little to be said here.
 
    The staff of NutWorks urges you to contact Csnews at Maine and
join in the Network-wide effort to compile a sympathy card which will
be sent to the families of Challenger's astronauts.  Files should
be sent to CSNEWS@MAINE.BITNET.  The TOP line of the file should read:
 
/APPEND CARD
 
.... and the file should have a filetype of CSNOTICE or CSN.
There are no other requirements.  Thank you for reading this.

We're sorry...
===========
 
    Some of you may have noticed that this issue of NutWorks magazine,
the greatest thing to happen to computers since CP/67, was just a tad
late arriving in your virtual reader.  What?  A month late!?  Gee, we
didn't think it had been *that* long.  Well, what can we say?  It's a
new semester, we're students, we have jobs.   There's just not enough
time in the day sometimes.
    Anyhow, the staff of NutWorks magazine, the greatest thing that's
happened  to humor since the dribble-glass,  wishes to apologize for
being tardy this month.   We know that it must have been hard on you.

Captains Log:
Stardate 860210
Commander Spock Reporting.
 
Well, it's the begining of another new semester...
 
    Being a farely  knowledgable computer  student I dread  this time of
being bombarded with incredibly philisophic questions.  One  of  my  all
favorites occurred just the other day while I was working on this issue.
THE QUESTION: "How do I get out of CMS ?" (Our logon enviornment is CMS)
Well  being  determined to help a fellow student in need (UGH) I decided
that a question of this magnitude and scope should be reffered to  those
who  are  more  knowledgable then I.  Hence, I consulted a few liaisons,
the head of CUNY consulting, and a few  system  programmers  I  know  to
obtain the answer to this awesome question.  After a  bit of  convincing
thenmthat I was serious and truly wanted to know the answer they told me
the following:
 
1) Type CP LOGOFF
2) Type CP
3) If you don't like CMS go get your own machine.
4) etc...
 
    Other great events here at Brooklyn College have included:
 
1) The day a  student  forgot to take  the  rubber band off his deck of
   cards and broke the card reader machine for a day and a helf.
   <Doesn't say much for our swift operator who didn't notice before he
    fed the machine the cards either...>
 
2) The day one student added (at the reccomendation of another student)
   CP LOGOFF to his logon profile.
   <I am not  even going  to bother to tell  you how this one ended...>
 
3) Almost  as bad as the  above was when a student  received an account
   with IPL CMS as his profile.
 
4) One of my favorites was when for some reason (still unknown to me) a
   student  removed from his profile the line  that defined  his reader
   and sat here for hours wondering while his programs hadn't come back
   to him.  He couldn't understand why everyone else was getting  there
   outputs back and he wasn't.

                             Nuts & Bolts
                            --------------
Commentary.
(Maligner tnerB Retorting.)
 
    Coming to work on an unseasonably warm Saturday morning at the
beginning of a new semester was not an unpleasant duty.  Until, that
is, I found to my horror that there were no consultants on duty in the
user area!  With great dry heaves of revulsion I came to the realiza-
tion that for the next sixteen hours I would be flooded with intell-
ectually unfieldable inquiries from the new hackers, the novice, the
uninformed, the L-User.
 
Conversation of the weekend:
---------------------------
 
User:    My computer won't run my program.
Me:      It's not your computer.  See this big blue box behind me?
         That's the computer.
User:    Well, the big blue box behind you won't run my program.
Me:      Did you type RUN?
User:    (Whips out set of instructions and reads from same):
         I typed EDIT HW1 and then INPUT and then PROGRAM HW1 (INPUT,
         OUTPUT); and then (* This program will take the average of...
         ...
         ... (days pass...)
         ...
         ...and then END. and then <CR> and then FILE and then RUN HW1.
Me:      (Waking abruptly):
         <CR> stands for Carriage Return!  Just hit the ENTER key when-
         ever your instructions say <CR>!
User:    Uh-oh...
Me:      What's wrong?
 
(The user had typed "<CR>" at the end of every line in his program.)
 
 
Runner up for the stupidity award:
---------------------------------
 
User:    I can't stop my program from running!!
Me:      Type "HX" and hit ENTER.
User:    But I DID that and it still says "Running."
Me:      It's *supposed* to say "Running."  That let's you know that
         the system is running, not your program.
User:    Ok.
         (Goes away briefly.  Returns moments later.)
         Can you force me?  I'm hung.
Me:      (Skeptically) What did you do to get hung?
User:    Nothing!  It said "Running" and I typed "LIST", and then
         it said "More..." (pronounced "more dot dot dot") so I
         I typed "LIST" again.
 
(User had typed "LIST" about twelve times thinking that "his computer"
wanted "more").
 
And for an honerable mention:
----------------------------
 
User:    Are the operator?
Me:      I hope so.
User:    Can you get my 191 back for me?
Me:      (Foolishly assuming that the user had a legitimate complaint
         and that the system might actually have disk trouble):
         What did the error message say?
User:    DASD 191 DETACHED
Me:      You didn't type DET 191 by any chance?
User:    Yes... why?
 
(Now I know the true meaning of the word AAAARRRRRRRGGGGGHHHHH!!!)

                       To Compute or Not To Compute
                       ============================
            Transcribed from "Bloom County" by Berke Breathed.
 
 
The words of Oliver Wendell Jones:
 
        "To compute, or not to compute...
         That is the question.
 
        "Whether 'tis nobler in the memory bank
         To suffer the slings and circuits of outrageous functions,
         Or to take up arms against a sea of... transistors.
         Or rather, transponders...   transcondu-...   trans...
         Er..
 
        "Oh, to hack with it."

                     The Uzi vs. The Computer
                     ========================
               Yossie Silverman (Yossie @ Bitnic)
 
The following advertisement appeared in one of the munition magazines:
 
  The Guy on the Right Doesn't Stand a Chance.  The guy on the right
has the Osborne 1,  a fully functional computer system in a portable
package  the size of a  briefcase.  The  guy on the left  has an Uzi
submachine gun concealed  in his attache case.  Also in the case are
four fully loaded, 32 round clips of 125 grain 9 mm ammunition.
 
  The owner  of the  Uzi  is going  to get  more tactical  firepower
delivered --- and delivered on target --- in less time and with less
effort.
 
  All for $795.  It's inevitable.
 
  If you're going  up against some  guy with an Osborne 1 --- or any
personal computer -- he's the one whose in trouble.   One round from
an Uzi can zip through ten inches  of solid  pine wood,  so  you can
imagine  what  it  will  do  to  structural  foam  acrylic and sheet
aluminum. In fact, detachable magazines for the Uzi are available in
25-, 32-, and 40-round capacities,  so you can  take  out  an entire
office full of Apple II or IBM Personal Computers tied into Ethernet
or other local area networks.
 
  What about the new 16-bit computers,  like the  Lisa  and Fortune?
Even with the Winchester backup they're no match for the Uzi.    One
quick burst and they'll find what UNIX means.
 
  Make your commanding officer proud.  Get an Uzi -- and come home a
winner in the fight for office automatic weapons.

Q: How many data base people does it take to change a light bulb?
A: Three:
      One to write the light bulb removal program,
      One to write the light bulb insertion program, and
      One to act as a light bulb administrator to make sure
          nobody else tries to change the light bulb at the same time.

     The foreman is talking to the new employee...
 
Foreman:   You're really going to like it here.  Every Thursday the boys
           go to the bar after work and get smashed out of their minds.
 
Rookie:    I don't think I'd like that; I don't drink.
 
Foreman:   Well, every Friday night after work we get together and get
           wasted on a pound of some of the best Columbian!
 
Rookie:    I wouldn't like that either; I don't do drugs.
 
Foreman:   Well, every Saturday evening we go down to the local house-
           of-ill-repute and spend the whole night.
 
Rookie:    I don't think I'd like that either.
 
Foreman:   (suspiciously)  You're not gay, are ya?
 
Rookie:    No.
 
Foreman:   Then you *really* won't like what we do on Sunday night!

                   BASE ADDRESS REGISTER CONCEPTS
                   ==============================
 
     The IBM 360/50 computer knows where it is at all times.   It
knows this because it knows where it isn't.  By subtracting where
it is,   from where it isn't;  or where it isn't from where it is
(whichever is greater),   it obtains a difference,  or deviation.
 
     The system uses deviations to generate corrective  instruct-
ions to take the  computer  from a  storage position where it is,
to a position where it isn't;   arriving at the position where it
wasn't, it now is.   Consequently, the position where it was,  is
now the position  where  it  wasn't,  and  it  follows  that  the
position where it was is the position where it isn't.
 
     In  the  event  the  position  where  it is  now, is not the
position  where it wasn't,  the system  has acquired a variation,
the variation being the difference  between where the computer is
and where it  wasn't.  However,  the  computer is  sure  where it
isn't, and it knows  where it wasn't, and by differentiating this
from the algebraic difference  between where  it shouldn't be and
where it was,  it is able to  obtain the  difference  between its
deviation and its variation which is called ERROR!
 
(Thank God IBM hired technical writers.)

    And now, a new word derived by the spellchecker in its never-ending
quest to make sense of our misspellings:
 
Defence - v. To take the fence away.  "We DEFENCED the yard."

                   Goofed-up Getaways Foil Crimes
                  ================================
 
by Stephen Fay
 
    On the night of Nov. 24, 1974, a 26-year-old Lee  man  fleeing  from
the police facilitated his own capture by crashing into a tree.
 
    And  though there's nothing so unusual about people fleeing from the
police crashing into trees, most of them do  so  while  in  cars.   This
particular  man  had  been on foot when he ran into the tree and knocked
himself cock-eyed.
 
    Ignominious as his capture was, he at least has the  consolation  of
knowing  he  is not alone.  For Berkshire County appears to be something
of a capital of goofed-up getaways.
 
    From the killer who telephoned the Pittsfield Fire Department (which
records all calls) and pounded on the doors of sleeping neighbors asking
directions to the home of his victim to the bank robbers who got  caught
when they got snarled in North Adams's rush-hour traffic to the lady who
robbed a liquor store and fled in a taxi, Berkshire County malefactors -
homegrown  as  well  as  transplants - have much to learn in the getaway
department.   A  little  research  into  criminal  activities   in   the
Berkshires turns up a whole gang of crooks who blew their getaways.
 
_Stuck_in_snowbank
 
    Take  the case of the 40-year-old multimillionaire who was convicted
of torching his Richmond summer home one snowy, cold morning in  January
1983.   Not  only did he increase the insurance on his $200,000 house to
$400,000 shortly before the fire, but while setting a blaze in the  rear
bedroom  he managed to touch off the fire alarm, not once but twice.  At
getaway time, he did not get far.  His car got stuck in a snowbank  near
his  Woodlot Road home.  Firefighters responding to the alarm saw him as
they rushed to the fire scene.  He was charged shortly after the event.
 
    The  most  quickly  solved  bank  robbery  in  Pittsfield's  history
occurred  Dec. 3, 1974.  A 33-year-old city resident forced his way into
the West Housatonic Street branch of  City  Savings  Bank  at  9:40,  20
minutes  before  the  bank was to open.  An alert teller observed two of
her colleagues approaching the door and asked the robber  if  she  could
tell the approaching "customers" that the bank wasn't open yet.
 
    The teller went to the front door and, using a codeword that meant a
robbery was in progress, sent her two co-workers dashing for a phone  to
call police.
 
    In  the meantime, the robber had gathered up $9,600 and, discovering
he hadn't thought of transportation, asked one of the tellers inside the
bank  for  the  loan  of  a car.  When police arrived, shortly after the
robber departed, the teller was able to provide an exact description  of
the vehicle.
 
    Meanwhile,  two  detectives  investigating  a  burglary  at  Crystal
Creamery a mile away, heard the description of the car and driver and, a
minute later, watched in awe as the very same car went right by them.
 
    The bank robber still had the money bag in his hand when they nabbed
him a few blocks later.
 
    It was only last  January  that  a  25-year-old  North  Adams  woman
pointed  a  gun  at the owner of the Liquor Mart at the Artery Arcade in
North Adams and scooped $320 from the cash register, half of  which  she
dropped  on the ground while leaving the store.  Then she used a taxi as
a getaway car.  The ower of the store took down  the  cab's  number  and
police  quickly found the driver, who knew nothing of what his passenger
was up to.  Twenty minutes after the robbery, the robber was arrested at
her home.
 
_Caught_in_traffic_
 
    "You  gotta  know  the territory," said the man in Meredith Wilson's
"The Music Man."
 
    It  is  advice  that  would  have  spared  a  visitor  from  Waltham
considerable  grief on the afternoon of - when else? - April Fools' Day,
1982.
 
    The 32-year-old bandit stuck up the  South  Adams  Savings  Bank  on
Route  8  in Cheshire at about 4:30 p.m.  With $635 in cash stuffed into
bank bags and a .22-caliber pistol in his hand, the robber  roared  away
in  his  black  Ford Mustang.  He made the big mistake of heading north,
however.  A half-hour later, he  got  snarled  in  a  5  p.m.  rush-hour
traffic jam on State Street in North Adams.  The police closed in and he
gave in.
 
    The Indiana Jones award goes to the 25-year-old North Adams man  who
broke  into a woman's apartment in March 1983.  The woman kicked him and
ran shouting out the door.  The attacker jumped out the window,  perhaps
forgetting  he  was on the second floor.  He broke his left ankle, which
was still in its cast during the trial three months later.
 
    Then there were the two men charged with the Feb. 13, 1979,  killing
of  a  Pittsfield  man.  The victim lived on Hungerford Street, a rather
hard-to-find road off West Housatonic Street.  At their trial, it became
evident  that the two defendants were themselves victims - of a profound
lack of planning.
 
    It seems, first of all, that they  did  not  know  where  Hungerford
Street was.  So one of them called the Pittsfield Fire Department to ask
directions, unaware that his call, like all calls to the department, was
recorded.   Then,  in  the  wee  hours  of the morning, the two wandered
around West Pittsfield, banging on the doors of sleepers,  asking  where
Hungerford  Street was.  The fire dispatcher and several of the awakened
neighbors were to testify at the trial.
 
    One of the men - the gunman - was found guilty of the  killing,  the
other was let off.
 
_Dropped_money_
 
    That  North  Adams  liquor  store  bandit  who dropped half her take
brings to mind the case of the unluck  crook  who  didn't  get  what  he
ordered at the old Majestic Restaurant in Pittsfield.
 
    The  case goes back to Jan. 22, 1974.  An armed robber wearing a ski
mask grabbed the cash box from behind the bar of a North Street  eatery.
But  the  gray metal box wasn't latched.  It fell open and all the money
fell on the floor behind the bar.  The crook headed for the door,  still
hanging  onto  the  empty money box, and took a blast of tear gas in the
face from a little aerosol can brandished by the owner.
 
    Perhaps the most inept attempt to commit a crime was illustrated  by
one Adams man.
 
    The  individual  in question, age 23, tried to extort exactly $7,045
from A.H. Rice Co. of Pittsfield.  The money demand, written on a  piece
of  Howard Johnson's guest stationery, was accompanied by a bomb threat.
The extortionist demanded that the sum be  sent  to  his  home  on  Burt
Street  in  Adams.   Cleverly, he thought, in order to throw authorities
off, the extortionist said the people at that address  knew  nothing  of
the plot.
 
    "It  reminds  me,"  his lawyer, George B. Crane, told the judge, "of
the old saw about the kidnapper sending the kid  home  with  the  ransom
note."

                              Cursed Baby Crib
                             ------------------
 
    Dick and Jane were expecting their first child, so they went down to
 buy a crib.  After looking at all the different models, they decided on
 one sitting in the  corner with no price tag on it.   So they asked the
 salesman how much it was.   He replied, "You don't want that one,  it's
 cursed.   As soon as you put the baby in it, the baby will die.   Three
 seconds later,   the mother will die.    And three seconds  later,  the
 father will die."  Well,  Dick and Jane  just loved the crib,  and they
 thought the salesman  was merely trying to  jack up the price  or some-
 thing, so, after much haggling, they bought it.
 
    A couple of weeks later,  little  Johnny was born.  They brought him
 home from the hospital.   Jane was  so happy.   Dick proudly watched as
 his wife put Johnny into the crib.   Johnny said, "ack oop",  and died.
 Then Dick  saw his  wife collapse onto  the floor  in a  lifeless heap.
 Terrified, he ran out of the house and killed himself tripping over the
 dead milkman.

              A long time ago, on a node far, far away (from ucbvax)
              a great Adventure (game?) took place...

            It is a period of system war.  User programs striking from
         a hidden directory,  have won their first victory against the
         evil Administrative Empire.  During  the battle,   User spies
         managed to steal secret source code to the Empire's  ultimate
         program:  The  Are-Em Star,  a privileged root  program  with
         enough power to  destroy  an entire file  structure.  Pursued
         by the Empire's sinister audit trail,   Princess Linker races
         aboard her  shell script,  custodian  of the  stolen listings
         that could save her people,  and restore freedom and games to
         the network...

            THE CONTINUING SAGA OF THE ADVENTURES OF LUKE VAXHACKER

          <<stoping the garbage collector from realocating them all>>
 
         -------------------------------------------------------------
 
            Luke noticed an unused handler lying  around and jumped to
         it.  The others  followed and  were soon  able to  execute an
         escape sequence.  Trashing some of its  relocation  registers
         caused a frame fault.  He started working his way back up the
         return stack when he was road blocked by  Dec Vadic who stood
         with his bytesaber active.  "At last we will see who the real
         file master is" he remarked, bits, bytes, words, and nybbles,
         flew as the two fought for bus mastership.   PDP-1  exclaimed
         "You were my best subtask! How could you have been seduced by
         the sideband portion of the carrier?".  "It's simple,"  Vadic
         said, "I enjoy obscure protocol".
 
            While the battle continued,  Luke,  Con,  Bookie,  and the
         Princess linked up  with the  droids and found their way back
         to the inode where the Milliamp Falcon was stored.  It looked
         quiet, "But,",  Luke said  "It could be an  MMU  trap.".  "No
         chance",   said Con,  "I loaded the par's  before I  left the
         Falcon."
 
            As they  started  toward it a squad of recursive functions
         swapped in and started firing ROM blasters at them.  "Thought
         you said  it  couldn't  be a trap"  quipped  Luke  "I said no
         chance for an MMU trap this is obviously a   k-mon--f-trap-to
         4" Con replied. PDP-1 shouted at the others "Escape while you
         can!  I'll cause  wait states as long as possible!"  and with
         that he allowed Vadic a chance to apply several hits with the
         bytesaber.  Instead of halting,  PDP-1  was encoded  onto the
         carrier.
 
            The  Milliamp Falcon  was restarted  and managed to escape
         the shell. "Quickly!"  shouted Con,  "We've got to  warp into
         virtual space!" The Bookie made several attempts,  but it was
         obvious that a CE had not done PM in a long time and it would
         take a lot of  decimal  adjusts to  byte  align  all the data
         registers.  After much  debugging,  virtual space was finally
         achieved.  "Do you know the path?"  asked Princess LPA0.  "No
         sweat"  said Con   "All we have to do is check the free space
         map".

                               Some months later...
 
            Luke was feeling rather bored. 3CPU could get to be rather
         irritating and  RS232  didn't really speak  Luke's  language.
         Suddenly, Luke felt someone's eyes boring through the back of
         his skull.  He turned slowly to see...nothing.  A quiet voice
         came from somewhere in front of him.
 
            "Grasshopper,  the carrier  is strong  within you."   Luke
         froze, which was a good thing  since his  legs were insisting
         that  he run  but they weren't likely to  be particular about
         direction.  Luke guessed that his odds of getting lost in the
         dense tree structures were  pretty good.  Unfortunately,  the
         Bookie wasn't available.
 
            "Yes.  Very strong,  but the modulation is  yet weak.  His
         network interface is undeveloped,"  the  voice  continued.  A
         small furry creature walked out of the  woods as  Luke stared
         on.   Luke's  stomach  had now joined the rest of his body in
         loud complaints.  Whatever was peering at  him was  certainly
         small and furry,  but Luke was quite sure that it didn't come
         from Alpha Centauri.  "Well,  well,"  said the creature as it
         rolled its eyes at Luke.  "Frobozz,  y'know.  Morning, name's
         Modem.   What's your game?  Adventure?  D&D?  Or are you just
         one of those Apple - pong  types that  hang  around the store
         demonstrations?"
 
            Luke closed his eyes.  Perhaps,  if he couldn't see it, it
         wouldn't notice him.  "H'mm,"   muttered the creature.  "Must
         use a different protocol.  @@@H   @@   @($@@@H          }"@G$
         @#@@G'(o%  @@@@@%%H(b ?"
 
            "No, no!,"  stammered Luke.  "I don't speak EBCDIC.  I was
         sent here to  become a  UNIX  wizard.   Must  have  the wrong
         address."  "Right address,"  said the creature.  "I am a UNIX
         wizard.  Device drivers a specialty. Or do you prefer playing
         with virtual memory?"  Luke eyed the creature cautiously.  If
         this was what happened to system  wizards after years of late
         night crashes, Luke wasn't sure he wanted anything to do with
         it.  He felt a  strange  affection  for the  familiar  micro-
         computers of his home.   And wasn't  virtual memory something
         that you got from drinking too much Coke?
