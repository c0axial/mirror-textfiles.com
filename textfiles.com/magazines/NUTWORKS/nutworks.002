              Insanity, Fatigue, Divine Inspiration, and the
                    Forced Removal of One's Own Hair
            --------------------------------------------------
 
    On the whole, things are going nicely.  This is the second issue
  of NutWorks, the magazine that has been hailed as the greatest
  thing since the invention of rope, and it too is doing quite well.
  The subscription list numbers 58 at present and, thanks to the many
  wonders of modern technology, it can safely be said that the sun
  never sets on the readers of NutWorks.  Yes, friends, we're now an
  institution,  which is quite suitable considering that an institution
  is precisely where many of us should indeed be placed.
    It's a small wonder that NutWorks has been selected by leading
  social scientists as "the one entity that will likely represent
  the most significant output of mankind during his Earthly
  History".
    There are times, however, when the whole thing becomes just a
  tad tedious.  Between constantly updating the mailing list, writing
  English papers, transforming the unending monotonous drollery of my
  COS220 professor into a working Pascal program, occasionally going
  to class, and working twelve hours a week, all the while bumming food
  off of my friends and trying to have sex with this girl I know, I am
  quickly going out of my mind, and for some reason I find myself
  watching shows like "Three's Company" a lot.
    Well, such is life.  But I'm sure you'll understand why this issue
  is made up almost entirely of other people's work.
    Thanks (and big ones) to Jim (xxxxxx@xxxxx), Reed (xxxxxx@xxxxx),
  Roman (xxxxxx@xxxxx), Marissa (xxxxxxxx@xxxxxx), Gary
  (xxxxxxxx@xxxxx), and Todd (xxxxxxx@xxxxx).

The following article is written in honor of all Operators and
Consultants who have to deal with unusual questions from, to say the
least, unusual people, each day they go to work!
  I have received Lots of help and lots of people deserve credit.
The most important person for this first column is Larry Ruch
(xxxxxx xx xxxxxxx).  He sent me a file containing this type of
"humor" and I want to share it with you.
 
 
Transcribed from the Operators Logbook:
(or, Sad But True Stories!)
 
QUESTION OF THE MORNING : Is there a computer in here??
You got it, another 100 student! What will they teach
them next!
 
WHO'S TO BLAME?   QUESTION:  "My job was deleted by
"HASP", Where is HASP?   Apparently she wanted to ask
HASP why he deleted her job.
 
U KNOW WHO U ARE!  QUESTION: a program for CS105 printed
"UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU" where my output should have printed; Should
I just run it again??    ANSWER : Sure if you want!
 
QUESTION OF THE NIGHT:  What does JOB TIME EXCEEDED mean?
 
RUNNER UP: What's a SUBROUTINE?  (hell it is only the 11th
week of classes. Why should anyone know what a subroutine is?)
 
DUMBEST QUESTION OF THE NIGHT:  My job hasn't come out yet. It
has been a long time. Could you find it? (on the surface this
isn't very humorous or dumb but the astute oparator (that's me)
checked on her job ("SAMPLE" -- catchy name, huh?). And it wasn't
found in the system.  Turning around I found that the mysteriously
missing output had been sitting on the printer for "a long time".
She was in 105. Maybe she will be a great future buisness leader!
I am worried about our economy now....
 
USER'S FAVORITE COMMAND:  Come fix the printer!  It's not printing
my job. The person before me got his, but mines not coming out.
I wish I had a dime for everytime I heard something like that...
If I did I would probably be rich and not have to work here for a
LONG LONG time!
 
WHAT ARE THEY FOR THEN:  Get ready for this one --- Someone tried to
run a rubberband through the card reader -- obviously skipping for
Job card, but an engineer had to come out and operate.  Don't they
teach students to take the rubber band off first?
 
ONE FOR THE ROAD:  It was 11:45 and closing time at 12 and a
bright CS105 student came up and asked why his program wasn't
working?  the error was "FORMAT ERROR ON CONTROL CARD: INVALID
CHARACTERS IN FIELD". He was just trying to do like his TA said
He documented each of his data cards, on each card after the data
was written :
DATA CARD 1
DATA CARD 2

Author's Comments:
  Well that ends my first column.  It's rather short, but
it will get longer.  I also want to thank people from UCF1VM for
thier input.  Suggestions from anyone and everyone will be welcome.
It is nice to know that users accross the country do dumb things too.

            -----------------------------------------
 
There once was a brother and a sister, fraternal twins, who were
approaching their high school graduation.  It was getting near prom
night and neither of them had a date for it.  So one day, the girl
approaches her brother and says "Hey, you got a date for the prom yet?"
 
He says "No, why?  You got someone lined up for me?"
 
"You might say that.  Why don't you take me to the prom?"
 
"Take you?  You kidding?  You're my sister!"
 
"Well, are you taking somebody else out?"
 
"You know I don't have a date, Sis."
 
"And neither do I.  But we both want to go to the prom, don't we?"
 
Her brother nods.  She continues, "So we should go with each other."
 
The brother can't see anything wrong with her reasoning, so he tells his
sister that if neither of them has a date by Wednesday evening,
he will take her to the prom.
 
Wednesday evening rolls around.  Neither of the siblings has a date,
so the the brother tells his sister that he'll take her to the prom
on Friday.
 
At the prom, both of them have a good time.  The brother is glad
that his sister talked him into taking her.  Then, while he's
standing at the punch bowl, his sister comes up to him again.
 
"Hey, brother, let's dance."
 
He looks around to make sure that nobody heard her.  "Look, Sis,
this is the Senior Prom, okay?  I'm not going to dance with my own
sister at the prom, okay?"
 
"Don't be so shy.  Look, Jimmy Elder is dancing with his cousin. So why
can't you dance with your sister?"
 
"Oh . . . all right."
 
So they dance, a slow number.  The rest of the prom passes by and after
a while it's over and time to go.  Both of them have had a good time.
 
In the car, with the brother at the wheel, the sister looks over at
him and says, "Let's not go straight home."
 
He gives her a curious look and says, "What are we going to do instead?"
 
"Oh, I don't know. Just drive around."
 
He agrees, and after they have driven around a while, out in the country,
she looks over at him again and says "Want to find some place to park?"
 
"Hell," he says, "are you crazy?  You're my sister, I'm not going
parking with you!"
 
"Who said anything about 'going parking'?  Let's just pull over somewhere
and talk for a while, okay?  It's been a busy year for both of us-- how
long has it been since we've had a chance to talk to each other?"
 
So she finally talks her brother into pulling the car over on a
secluded back road, and after a few minutes of idle talk, she looks
over at him again.
 
"Hey . . . " she says.
 
"What?"
 
"Why don't you kiss me?"
 
"You've been suggesting a lot of weird things lately, you know that?  I'm
not going to kiss you, you're my sister!"  And he reached for the
ignition switch to start the car.
 
She reached out and took his hand.  "I know I'm your sister.  You've
mentioned that a lot lately. And you're my brother.  And don't we love
each other?  Why shouldn't we kiss if we feel like it?"  She kissed
him on the  cheek and he
kissed her back.  After a few minutes of kissing, she whispered in his
ear, "Come on.  Let's do it."
 
"Do what," said her brother, but he had a good idea of what his
sister had in mind.
 
"You know what," his sister replied.
 
"I can't do that with you, you're my  . . . " His voice trailed off.
 
While he was on top of her, his sister murmured, "You know, you're a lot
lighter than Dad."
 
"I know," said her brother.  "Mom told me."

dear editor:
     i have just finished reading ISSU#1, Vol 1 (what's the
difference?) of the newest, nuttiest, virtual magazine 2 hit the
readers, NUTWORKS, & i readily admit 2 issuing a few guffaws & chortles
(yes, karl, i stole it) tho i must confess that the "documentation
sex quiz"  did raise my eyebrows 2 the point where they nearly flew
off my face.   i think the title NUTWORKS is grate but, guys, change the
spelling--it pains me 2 type KS where an X will adequately impart
 the necessary fonix 2 achieve the proper sound...& here is
my written permisssion allowing u 2 usurp my shorthand...speaking of my
shorthand, can i lodge a few complaints here???  c'mon, all u
copyrite in-fringers--gimme a brake!!  u all agree 2 pay the royalties
i demand but have i yet seen a virtual red cent in my rdr??? u guilty
CHATters no who i mean!!
     & while i m speaking of CHAT, all u nukers or bombers (or
whatever the appropriate lingo mite b 2 describe u) gimme a brake!!!
i travel@300 baud!
those things piss me off & lotsa u out there can attest 2 that (heheh).
have some consideration folx!  almost as bad as those r CHATters who
start yawn-ing & snoring on the channel!!!  that's insulting & u can
more easily relieve your bordom by typing CHAT /change et al.
now that CHAT has resumed it's regular (as opposed 2 irregular)
schedule, u mite want 2 try some other chatting facilities.
billy@bmacadm, run by cuny, is open 24 hours a day (when & if cuny
is running).  FORUM (also sponsored by cuny types & written by quite a
talented cuny type who wood probably nolog my id if i revealed his)
is now available.  4um (typical of me) is faster than any other
system i have been on but is unreleased & still in test stages
(at this writing) & u should b wary of hidden commands within
the exec such as ERASE * * (only kidding, steve).  but not 2 worry
anway--there is always vmbackup....unless, of course, u r at a
certain node best left unmentioned....
     anyway, editor, keep up the good work.  u will shirley hear from me
again but not if u insist on calling me shirley!!!  looking 4ward
2 the next exciting issu, regards,
              marissa something
               many ids @ cunyvm
 
Note: The preceding letter was placed here because it is hilarious.
      It should be pointed out, however, that NutWorks is spelled
      the way it is--including the capital 'W'--for reasons that
      are much to complex and euphoric to right now relate.

| The following quotes taken from the Toronto News on
| July 26, 1977, are actual statements from insurance

| details in as few words as possible. Such instances
| of faulty writing serve to confirm that incompetency
| can be highly entertaining.
|
| ----------------------------------------------------
|
|
|  1. Coming home I drove into the wrong house and
|       collided with a tree I don't have.
|
|  2. The other car collided with mine without giving
|       warning of its intent.
|
|  3. I collided with a stationary truck coming the
|       other way.
|
|  4. In my attempt to kill a fly, I drove into a
|       telephone pole.
|
|  5. I had been shopping for plants all day and was
|       on my way home.  As I reached an intersection,
|       a hedge sprang up, obscuring my vision and I
|       did not see the other car.
|
|  6. I had been driving for forty years when I fell
|       asleep at the wheel and had an accident.
|
|  7. I was on my way to the doctor with rear end
|       trouble when my universal joint gave way
|       causing me to have an accident.
|
|  8. My car was legally parked as it backed into the
|       other vehicle.
|
|  9. As I approached the intersection a sign suddenly
|       appeared in a place where no sign had ever
|       appeared before, I was unable to stop in time
|       to avoid the accident.
|
| 10. I told the police I was not injured, but upon
|       removing my hair, I found that I had a
|       fractured skull.
|
| 11. I was sure the old fellow would never make it
|       to the other side of the road when I struck
|       him.
|
| 12. I saw a slow-moving, sad-faced old gentleman as
|       he bounced off the hood of my car.
|
| 13. The indirect cause of the accident was a little
|       guy in a small car with a big mouth.
|
| 14. I was thrown from my car as it left the road,
|       and was later found in a ditch by some stray
|       cows.
|
| 15. A pedestrian hit me and went under my car.
|
| 16. I thought my window was down, but I found out it
|       was up when I put my head through it.
|
| 17. To avoid hitting the bumper of the car in front,
|       I struck the pedestrian.
|
| 18. The guy was all over the road. I had to swerve a
|       number of times before I hit him.
      (Number 18 gets my vote -- BB)
|
| 19. The pedestrian had no idea which way to run, so
|       I ran over him.
|
| 20. An invisible car came out of nowhere, struck my
|       car and vanished.
|
| 21. A truck backed through my windshield into my
|       wife's face.
|
| 22. I pulled away from the side of the road, glanced

                          ====================
 
 
 
The following is a copy of some correspondance which took place between
one of our editors and a Mr. Lewis Carroll:
 
Dear Mr. Carroll,
The publisher has  referred to me your latest  work,  a poem
called "Jabberwocky," for editing.  "Jabberwocky" seems rife
with  misspellings and  typos;  I  assumed  that these  were
unintentional and the fault of your typist.
Fortunately,  we have recently purchased PROFS (Professional
Office  Systems),   a  new  IBM   package  that  includes  a
sophisticated  proofreader  and   spelling  checker.    This
program is  able to  guess quite accurately  as to  what the
misspelled word may actually be.  PROFS also offers synonyms
and  alternatives for  words,  and  it  can note  redundant,
awkward or wordy phrases.
I have  run "Jabberwocky"  through this  program.   Granted,
your obvious intent is to produce a work of fantasy, so I've
taken some  of your  proper nouns  to be  creations of  your
imagination.
Certain words,  however,  weren't clear.   For example,  the
first line of your original text read:   "Twas brillig,  and
the slithy toves."   The only words recognized  by the PROFS
proofreader were "and the."
When I hit  a key marked "aid,"  I get a list  of what PROFS
construes to be possible spellings of a flagged word.   With
"slithy,"  PROFS came  up with  slithery,  slimy,   slither,
slimly, silty,  slinky,  and slight.   Your typist must have
inadvertently dropped the  "er" from "slithery" and  come up
with the nonsense "slithy."  Of course,  I fixed the word to
say "slithery."
And so  it goes.   I continued  to make repairs as  I deemed
fit.   But Mr.  Carroll, the mistakes were not always clear.
For example, in the first verse your text read:   "All mimsy
were  the borogoves."   The computer  thought  that you  had
meant to say:   "All misty were the bongoes," but bongoes is
a far shot from borogoves.  What did you mean by borogoves?
In  the  second  verse,   you warn  to  "shun  the  frumious
Bandersnatch!"   "Frumious" is  obviously  a misspelling  of
"furious";   however,  I  have no  idea  as to  just what  a
Bandersnatch  might   be.    Our   computer  has   suggested
"Ballerinas," but I suspect that you had something better in
mind.
Mr.  Carroll, I've edited many fantasies, so I must warn you
that I am familiar with all forms of sword,  be they elfish,
dwarfish or otherwise.   I have already heard of the "vorpal
sword"  you mentioned  in verse  three.   It  seems to  have
 
gained  popularity among  role-playing game  enthusiasts,(1)
but I'm  not sure its  reference is appropriate  here.   The
computer certainly doesn't have "vorpal"  in its memory,  so
I'm not sure that the public would appreciate your using the
word.    I have  let the  computer  substitute "verbal"  for
"vorpal," and I believe that you  will find the result has a
nice ring to it.
Some of  the other  gems that  your secretary  came up  with
include an "uffish" thought,  "whiffling" when you certainly
meant "waffling," and  some sort of wood.   She  called it a
"tulgey wood."  Again  the computer came through:    Did you
mean "turkey wood?"   Admittedly,  the computer had  quite a
time with  "turkey wood";  it  insisted that it  should have
been "turkey would."  But that would have been nonsense.   A
good editor shouldn't be afraid to override a computer.
When I first saw the word "chortled" I was sure that you had
made  it  up!(2)   The  computer didn't  flag  it  as  being
misspelled,   but it  couldn't  offer  any synonyms  for  it
either.   On looking it up, I was amused to discover that it
was meant to be a cross between a chuckle and a snort.   How
clever of you to find it!
Well, enough criticism.   I'm sure your poem is salvageable.
It's a pity, though,  that even "cleaned up" this poem would
be far too difficult for children to read.   One function of
the PROFS proofreader is to check the comprehension level of
a word.  I'm afraid that some of the words you use are level
16,  i.e.,  a person would have  to be a graduate student or
better to  understand the word.    That's too  bad,  because
there's quite a market for children's verse.
Anyway,  I've  underlined the  unrecognizable words  in your
original and I'm  returning it to you.    I've also enclosed
the result of my collaboration with the computer;  I believe
that you  will find  the corrected  version to  be pleasing,
understandable and in keeping with your reputation.   Let me
know what you think.   I hope  you understand that there are
few publishers out  there who care to take the  time to work
with promising authors.
Yours truly,
xxxxx xxxxxx

(1) To "Dungeons and Dragons" players,  a "vorpal sword" has
the power to sever limbs when the player rolls 18 or higher.
The word is a Carroll creation.
(2) "Chortle," a word coined by Carroll,  has worked its way
into standard dictionaries.

JABBERWHACKY
'Twas broiling, and the slithery toes
Did gore and gimlet in the wave:
All misty were the bongoes,
And the mole rats outraged.
"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
The furious Ballerinas!"
He took his verbal sword in hand:
Long time the meantime foe he sought --
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
And stood awhile in thought
And, as in iffiest thought he stood,
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Came waffling through the turkey wood,
And burbled as it came!
One, two!  One, two!  And through and through
The verbal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head
He went galloping back.
"And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
Come to my arms, my beaming boy!
O fabulous day!  Callooh!  Callay!"
He chortled in his joy.
'Twas broiling, and the slithery toes
Did gore and gimlet in the wave:

               ZEN AND THE ART OF SOFTWARE DOCUMENTATION
 
 
     (Translated from the P'-u-t'ung hua dialect by W.C.Carlson)
 
 
     Editor's Note:  The following are excerpts from the only known
treatise on Zen Software Documentation.  Called "H'ring-chu-tsu", which
literally translates to "Ink of Several Insignificant Matters", this
treatise was written in 12th Century Japan by the scholarly monk
E'm-ie-T'.  That it discusses Software documentation -- predating the
advent of software by 850 years -- is but another of the mysteries of
those who walk the true path.
     This article should be read twice.
 
On Preparing to Write of Software
 
     To prepare for the writing of Software, the writer must first
become one with it, sometimes two.  Software is untasteable, opalescent,
transparent; the user sees not the software, so the writer must see
through it.  Spend long, quiet mornings in meditation.  Do not sharpen
the mind, but rather blunt it by doing Zen crosswords.
(Ed. note:  Zen crosswords are done by consulting only the "Down" clues;
and always in the mind, never on paper.)
 
 
     The mind should be rooted but flexible, as a long stemmed flower
faces the Sun yet bends with the Wind.  Think not of compound adjectives
because they tend to wire the mind in two directions.  Rather, consider
the snowflake, which radiates in beauty in any and all directions.
Partake of strong drink.
 
 
     Do not study the Software; let it study you.  Allow the Software
admission to your mind, but keep in the cheap seats.  Let it flow around
you at its own pace.  Do not disturb or dismay it, but keep it from your
private parts because it tends to coalesce there.
 
 
     When the Software is with you, you will know it.  It will lead your
mind where it should be, and prepare you for the narcolepsy that is cert
ain to follow.  You will know when the Software is with you, and so will
others.  You will smile with an inner smile.  Typewriters will frighten
you.  You will fall down a lot.
 
 
     The first exercise in writing Software documentation is the Haiku.
Haiku are 17 syllable poem forms in which many ideas of a single concept
are reduced  -- nay, distilled -- into a short, impressionistic poem.
For example, the Haiku for preparing to write of Software goes:
 
 
                   Emptiness on paper;
                        Fleeting thought.
                   Red Sox play at Fenway's
                        Green Park.
 
 
By concentrating on the Softwares form and function in a concise,
subliminal, truly meaningless Haiku verse, you have transcended the
Software, and you can then write the true manual.
 
 
The following Haiku is from a Zen manual on Data Transmission:
 
 
                   How swiftly whirls the disk;
                   Data leaps to the floating head
                   And is known.
 
 
And this is on Hardware Maintenance:
 
 
                   The smell of hot P.C. card,
                     Blank screen, no bell,
                   New parts will be needed.
 
 
And another Haiku, this one on Debugging:
 
 
                   All the lights are frozen;
                   The cursor blinks blandly.
                   Soon, I shall see the dump.
 
 
Let the Haikku thoughts free your mind from your fingers.  Your fingers
will write what must be written.  Soon you will be in Doc. Prep.
 
 
 
On the Review Cycle
 
 
     This is the murkiest path.  Storms gather and disperse around you
many directions, none of which are in English.  The path becomes unclear
as many an idea compete for attention.  Some of them are fatal.
 
 
     But the writer of Zen Software documentation fears not the
turbulence of review cycles.  Let it storm around you and be dry, warm,
and safe in the knowledge that you have written the pure manual.
Anyway, you know the printer.  You shall in the end have it your way.

                  REAL PROGRAMMERS DON'T EAT QUICHE
                  ---------------------------------
 
RP DON'T EAT QUICHE.  IN FACT, RP DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO SPELL QUICHE.
THEY EAT TWINKIES AND SZECHWAN FOOD.
 
REAL PROGRAMMERS (RP) DON'T WRITE SPECS -- USERS SHOULD CONSIDER
THEMSELVES LUCKY TO GET ANY PROGRAMS AT ALL AND TAKE WHAT THEY GET.
 
RP DON'T COMMENT THEIR CODE.  IF IT IS HARD TO WRITE, IT SHOULD BE HARD
TO UNDERSTAND.
 
RP DON'T WRITE APPLICATIONS PROGRAMS; THEY PROGRAM RIGHT DOWN TO THE
BARE METAL.  APPLICATIONS PROGRAMMING IS FOR DWEEBS WHO CAN'T DO
SYSTEMS PROGRAMMING.
 
RP DON'T WRITE IN COBOL.  COBOL IS FOR WIMPY APPLICATIONS PROGRAMMERS.
 
RP' PROGRAMS NEVER WORK RIGHT THE FIRST TIME.  BUT IF YOU THROW THEM ON
THE MACHINE THEY CAN BE PATCHED INTO WORKING IN "ONLY A FEW" 30-HOUR
DEBUGGING SESSIONS.
 
RP DON'T WRITE IN FORTRAN.  FORTRAN IS FOR PIPE-STRESS FREAKS AND
CRYSTALLOGRAPHY WEENIES.
 
RP NEVER WORK 9-5.  IF ANY RP ARE EVEN AROUND AT 9AM, THEY WERE UP
ALL NIGHT.
 
RP NEVER WRITE IN BASIC.  ACTUALLY, NO PROGRAMMERS EVER WRITE IN BASIC
AFTER THE AGE OF 12.
 
RP DON'T WRITE IN PL/1.  PL/1 IS FOR PROGRAMMERS THAT CAN'T DECIDE
BETWEEN COBOL AND FORTRAN.
 
RP DON'T PLAY TENNIS, OR ANY OTHER SPORT THAT REQUIRES YOU TO CHANGE
CLOTHES.  MOUNTAIN CLIMBING IS OK, AND RP WEAR THEIR CLIMBING BOOTS
TO WORK IN CASE A MOUNTAIN SUDDENLY SPRINGS UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
MACHINE ROOM.
 
RP DON'T WRITE IN PASCAL, OR BLISS, OR ADA, OR ANY OF THOSE PINKO
COMPUTER SCIENCE LANGUAGES.  STRONGB TYPING IS FOR PEOPLE WITH WEAK
MINDS.
 
RP DON'T DOCUMENT.  DOCUMENTATION IS FOR SIMPS WHO CAN'T READ THE
LISTINGS OR THE OBJECT DECK.

  Snugglebuns,
    Please believe me when I say that I didn't mean anything
  by it when I ate your cat.  Honestly, I meant well. Love, Mingo.
 
  Jerry,
    Happy Val's Day and good luck with your operation.  Can't wait to
  start calling you Geraldine!! Kisses, LuvyDuvy.
 
  To the Gentleman I met at the ACM Party:
    I don't know if you recall having a rather interesting I/O
  (mostly "I", hee hee) session with me the other night, but I must
  tell you that your interface control was the longest and most
  exhilarating I've been lucky enough to peruse in a long time.
  I hope you enjoyed "DEBUG."  Call me sometime, Shnookums.
 
  Sandy,
    I love the gorilla suit.  But next time, remember to bring
  the clothespins ok?  Later, Spiff.
