    Well the response to the first issue of nutworks for this  sememster
has incredible.  Some of you  (Yes Knappy, I mean you for one)  sent  me
enough stuff to sort through to keep me busy for quite a while.   Thanks
for all the great stuff everyone out there sent us.  I ran into a slight
problem with several of the articles that were sent to me though.  Alth-
ough they were on the whole great articles, some were  incredibly  long.
I didnt want to clogg up people's readers or the network with an incred-
ibly large issue, so i decided to try something  revolutionary  to  this
magazine that we all know and love, I decided that I would have to  make
some of the articles into several parters (An example is in the Op  Code
article)  I want to stress that I am not complaining about  people send-
ing long articles, on the contrary,  I am  explaining  to you why I  did
that I did.  Besides, we want to make sure that you will read next issue
 
                                   :-)
 
P.S. Knappy Sorry, but it wouldn't  be fair to make an entire issue just
     out of the stuff you sent  me.  It will be  spread out over several
     issues.  Thanks for your support.

                     I think that I shall never see
                     a subroutine that works for me
                     a macro or a zero test
                     that isn't just a rodent's nest
                     a string that doesn't always stray
                     and mix up bit's in wild array
                     a process with re-entrant flair
                     that isn't just a looping snair
                     routines whose timings are not slain
                     when interrupts begin to rain
                     maybe god can make a tree
                     but bugs are made by guys like me!

                            Proofs
                          ==========
 
The following is a list of some common proof techniques that
are often extremely useful.
 
1  Proof by example:
 
      The author gives only the case n = 2 and suggests that
      it contains most of the ideas of the general proof.
 
2  Proof by intimidation:
      'Trivial.'
 
3  Proof by vigorous handwaving:
 
      Works well in a classroom or seminar setting.
 
4  Proof by cumbersome notation:
 
      Best done with access to at least four alphabets
      and special symbols.
 
5  Proof by exhaustion:
 
      An issue or two of a journal devoted to your proof is
      useful.
 
6  Proof by omission:
 
      'The reader may easily supply the details.'
      'The other 253 cases are analogous.'
      '...'
 
7  Proof by obfuscation:
 
      A long plotless sequence of true and/or meaningless
      syntactically related statements.
 
8  Proof by wishful citation:
 
      The author cites the negation, converse, or generalization
      of a theorem from literature to support his claims.
 
9  Proof by funding:
 
      How could three different government agencies be wrong?
 
10 Proof by eminent authority:
 
      'I saw Karp in the elevator and he said it was probably
      NP-complete.'
 
11 Proof by personal communication:
 
      'Eight-dimensional colored cycle stripping is NP-complete
      [Karp, personal communication].'
 
12 Proof by reduction to the wrong problem:
 
      ' To see that infinite-dimensional colored cycle stripping
      is decidable, we reduce it to the halting problem.'
 
13 Proof by reference to inaccessible literature:
 
      The author cites a simple corollary of a theorem to be
      found in a privately circulated memoir of the Slovenian
      Philological Society, 1883.
 
14 Proof by importance:
 
      A large body of useful consequences all follow from the
      proposition in question.
 
15 Proof by accumulated evidence:
 
      Long and diligent search has not revealed a counterexample.
 
16 Proof by cosmology:
 
      The negation of the proposition is unimaginable or meaningless.
      Popular for proofs of the existence of God.
 
17 Proof by mutual reference:
 
      In reference A, Theorem 5 is said to follow from Theorem 3 in
      reference B,  which is shown from Corollary 6.2 in reference C,
      which is an easy consequence of Theorem 5 in reference A.
 
18 Proof by metaproof:
 
      A method is given to construct the desired proof. The
      correctness of the method is proved by any of these techniques.
 
19 Proof by picture:
 
      A more convincing form of proof by example. Combines well
      with proof by omission.
 
20 Proof by vehement assertion:
 
      It is useful to have some kind of authority in relation to
      the audience.
 
21 Proof by ghost reference:
 
      Nothing even remotely resembling the cited theorem appears
      in the reference given.
 
22 Proof by forward reference:
 
      Reference is usually to a forthcoming paper of the author,
      which is often not as forthcoming as at first.
 
23 Proof by semantic shift:
 
      Some standard but inconvenient definitions are changed for
      the statement of the result.
 
24 Proof by appeal to intuition:
 
      Cloud-shaped drawings frequently help here.

                             The Virus
                             =========
                        by: J. Keith Lehman
                  WT123275 @ WVNVAXA (Fozzy Bear)
 
 
    SEP-16-2007
 
       BRAM (Bacterial Random Access Memory) was the greatest innov-
    ation in the computer industry since the introduction of thought
    recognition systems back in 1997.  Before BRAM, most home compu-
    ters had more than  64  gigabytes  of memory.  Now the amount of
    memory is governed by the need.  If you need more memory, simply
    "uncage" some of your multiplying bacteria.  In a matter of sec-
    onds the  bacteria  will  divide  into  astronomical amounts  of
    memory using normal cell division.  Information is stored in the
    DNA molecules of the bacteria which you produce.
 
       By the year 2002, nearly every computer system relied on BRAM
    for the  huge  amount of  storage  required to translate thought
    processes into a form computers could read.  All governments had
    BRAM  based defense  systems and  now the  BRAM  technology  had
    finally arrived on the home market.  For only $32,000  (the cost
    of an average laser printer)  you could buy a  BRAM  module  for
    your home system. They sold every one they could make.
 
       The tragedy occured when a disgruntled employee of the Genen-
    comp division of  Eastern-IBM  started to research ways to alter
    the genetic structures of the  BRAM  bacteria  through a type of
    virus.  His apparent aim was to hold Eastern-IBM's data hostage.
    He was  given everything  that he demanded in the hope that  IBM
    scientists could discover the strain before he could release it.
    After extensive searches it  was determined that the virus was a
    hoax.   IBM had the man arrested and he was sentenced to 2 years
    in a minimum security prison.  IBM continued to produce the BRAM
    module, and for a while everything went smoothly.
 
       Until...   It turned  out that the  employee  had  hidden the
    infamous  strain in the form of  actual electrical  instructions
    embedded within a variable-bit microprocessor used in IBM's most
    popular  mini-computer.  The  program was  set to  execute auto-
    matically after four months.   Upon execution,  the instructions
    reprogrammed an innocent  BRAM  bacteria into a cancerous virus.
    The entire  IBM  computer  system was  destroyed.  Consumers and
    businesses lost faith in IBM  and the company filed for  Chapter
    11 within a week.
 
      The instructions to reprogram the bacteria were simultaneously
    transmitted to every computer on every  network connected in any
    way to IBM--which turned out to be quite a lot. The IBM research
    network  was connected  to popular  world wide  networks used by
    colleges,  businesses,  home computer owners and defense depart-
    ment computers as well. The result--TOTAL ANNIHILATION of nearly
    every computer big and small.
 
       Businesses suddenly had no records, no way to take new orders
    or any way to confirm existing orders.   Thousands of businesses
    crumbled.  The  world  economy was  thrust into  chaos  as banks
    closed and called in their loans. Several smaller countries were
    hit by  revolutions. The  news  media  compared  it to a nuclear
    blast hitting the economy of every country in the world.
 
       Needless to say, BRAM was declared to be a threat to national
    security  and federal  authorities  had the  authority to arrest
    anyone  caught  experimenting with it.  The disgruntled employee
    was exiled out of the  U.S.  (the  first time  anyone  had  been
    exiled since 1990).  The  IRS  suspended  all audits for 2 years
    because  they could not  expect people to to complete  their tax
    forms correctly  without the aid of computers. Everyone  dragged
    out their  old silicon  based  computers  and tried to cope with
    losing  all the information formerly in the BRAM systems.
 
       Two years later the virus died out  due to a lack of new BRAM
    to feed on. Some BRAM systems were revived with a new antibiotic
    organism  that roamed  throughout the  memory  serching  for any
    trace of a virus. Fortunately,  no other virus has been found...
    yet...!

        THE CONTINUING SAGA OF THE ADVENTURES OF LUKE VAXHACKER
 
        As we enter the scene,  an  Imperial Multiplexer is trying
     to kill a consulate ship.   Many of their signals have gotten
     through,   and  RS232  decides  it's time to  fork  off a new
     process before this  old ship is destroyed.   His  companion,
     3CPU, is following him only  because he appears to know where
     he's going..
 
        "I'm going to regret this!" cried  3CPU,  as  he  followed
     RS232 into the buffer.  RS232 closed the pipes,  made the SYS
     call,  and their  process  detached  itself  from the burning
     shell of the ship.  The commander of the Imperial Multiplexer
     was quite  pleased  with  the attack.  "Another  process just
     forked, sir. Instructions?"  asked the lieutenant. "Hold your
     fire.   That  last  power  failure  must  have  caused a trap
     throughout zero. It's not using any cpu time,  so don't waste
     a signal on it."   "We  can't  seem to  find  the  data  file
     anywhere,  Lord Vadic."  "What about that forked process?  It
     could have been holding the channel open,   and just pausing.
     If any links exist, I want them removed or made inaccessable.
     Ncheck the  entire file system  'til it's found,  and nice it
     -20 if you have to."
 
                Meanwhile, in our wandering process...
 
        "Are you sure you can  Ptrace this thing without causing a
     core  dump?" queried  3CPU  to  RS232.    This  thing's  been
     striped,  and I'm in no mood to try and debug it."   The lone
     process finishes execution,   only to find our friends dumped
     on a lonely file system,  with the setuid inode stored safely
     in RS232.  Not knowing what else to do,  they wandered around
     until the jawas grabbed them.
 
        Enter our hero,   Luke Vaxhacker,   who is out to get some
     replacement parts for his uncle. The jawas wanted to sell him
     3CPU,  but 3CPU didn't know how to talk directly to an  11/40
     with RSTS,  so Luke would still needed some sort of interface
     for 3CPU to connect to.  "How about this little RS232 unit ?"
     asked 3CPU.   "I've  delt with him many times before,  and he
     does an  excellent job at  keeping his bits straight."   Luke
     was pressed for time, so he took 3CPU's advice, and the three
     left before they could get swapped out.
 
        However, RS232 is not the type to stay put once you remove
     the retaining screws.   He promptly scurried off into the the
     deserted disk space.  "Great!" cried Luke, "Now I've got this
     little tin box  with the only  link to that file off floating
     in the free disk space.   Well,  3CPU,  we better go find him
     before he gets allocated by someone else."
 
        The two set off,  and finaly traced  RS232  to the home of
     PDP-1 Kenobi,  who was  busily trying to run an Icheck on the
     little RS unit.  "Is this thing yours?   His indirect address
     are all goofed up, and the size is gargatious.   Leave things
     like  this  on  the  loose,  and  you'll  wind  up  with dups
     everywhere.  However,  I  think  I've got  him  fixed up.  It
     seems that he's has a link to a data file on the Are-Em Star.
     This could help the rebel cause."  "I don't care about that,"
     said Luke. "I'm just trying to optimize my uncles scheduler."
     "Oh,  forget about that.   Dec Vadic,  who is responsible for
     your fathers death,   has probably already destroyed his farm
     in search of this little RS232.   It's  time for you to leave
     this place, join the rebel cause, and become a UNIX wizard! I
     know a guy by the name of  Con Solo,   who'll  fly  us to the
     rebel base at a price."
 
     -------------------------------------------------------------
 
        After sifting through the over-written remaining blocks of
     Luke's home directory, Luke and PDP-1 sped away from /u/lars,
     across the surface of the  Winchester  riding  Luke's  flying
     read / write head.  PDP-1  had  Luke  stop at the edge of the
     cylinder overlooking  /usr/spool/uucp. "Unix - to - Unix Copy
     Program;"  said PDP-1.   "You will never find a more wretched
     hive  of bugs  and  flamers.  We must be cautious."   As  our
     heroes'  process entered  /usr/spool/news,  it  was met  by a
     newsgroup of Imperial protection bits.
 
        "State your UID."  commanded their parent process.  "We're
     running under  /usr/guest.  This is our  first  time  on this
     system,"  said Luke.  "Can I see some  temporary  privileges,
     please?" "Uh..."
 
        "This is not the process you are looking for,"   piped  in
     PDP-1,  using an obscure bug to momentarily set his effective
     UID to root.  "We can go about our business."
 
        "This isn't the process we want.  You are free to go about
     your business.  Move along!"  PDP-1  and  Luke made their way
     through a long and tortuous nodelist (cwruecmp!decvax!ucbvax!
     harpo!ihnss!ihnsc!ihnss!ihps3!stolaf!borman)   to a dangerous
     netnode frequented by hackers,  and seldom polled by Imperial
     Multiplexers.  As Luke stepped up to the bus,  PDP-1  went in
     search of a likely file descriptor.  Luke had never seen such
     a collection of weird and exotic device drivers.   Long ones,
     short ones, ones with stacks,  EBCDIC converters,  and direct
     binary interfaces all were drinking data at the bus.
 
        "#@{ *&^%^$$#@ ":><?><"         transmitted a particularly
     unstructured piece of code.   "He doesn't like you,"  decoded
     his coroutine. "Sorry," replied Luke, beginning to backup his
     partitions.  "I  don't like  you  either.   I am  queued  for
     deletion on  12  systems."  "I'll be  careful."   "You'll  be
     reallocated!"   concatenated  the  coroutine.   "This  little
     routine  isn't  worth  the  overhead,"  said  PDP-1  Kenobie,
     overlaying into Luke's address space.  "@$%&(&^%&$$@$#@$AV^$g
     fdfRW$#@!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"  encoded the first coroutine as it
     attempted to overload PDP-1's  input over voltage protection.
     With a unary stroke of his  bytesaber,   Kenobie unlinked the
     offensive code.  "I think I've found an I/O device that might
     suit us."   "The name's  Con Solo.  I hear you're looking for
     some relocation."  "Yes indeed,  if it's a fast channel.   We
     must get  off this device."    "Fast channel?   The  Milliamp
     Falcon  has made the  ARPA gate  in  less than  twelve nodes!
     Why,  I've even outrun cancelled messages.   It's fast enough
     for you, old version."
 
        Our heroes,  Luke Vaxhacker  and  PDP-1 Kenobie made their
     way  to  the  temporary  file  structure.  When  he  saw  the
     hardware,  Luke exclaimed, "What a piece of junk! That's just
     a paper tape reader!"
