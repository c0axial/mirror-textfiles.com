³   Always one to satisfy, be it women, bea..er um nevermind. Here is some
    mail from squinky. he said put it in a pud so I did.

RE: fr0?

[Stuff edited out to protect the innocent, namely me.]
 
My hair went through a comsic metaphysically change today. I went swimming in 
the ocean, and then, it started to look like one of the guys from KIss's hair.
 
Put that in your pud, and Publish it.
PHUN!@!
    
þ Pure Energy in Pud? Huh?

    Little known to most before Pure Energy was in [NuKE] he had long since
    aspired to be one of the few and proud most legendary members of the
    Pizza Underground. But alas we figured he was to much of a punk middle
    aged freak to be allowed to hang around with us so we of course turned
    him down. He got really upset us and well threatened some rather mean 
    things but anyways that is better left to the past. After he showed up
    at NO COURiER's[2] funeral we went out and had some coffee. We talked 
    for a while and after I refused to 'go back to his place' we decided he 
    could now join the ranks of pud. So here is THE first submission he made 
    way back when on the faithfull day we turned him down...

    So maybe now you can see why exactly we didn't see it was time to let
    him in but we have since changed our minds and decided that it would
    be great to have him off in the group with us. Yep more than great it
    would be swell even.

þ Mail From John McAfee      

(9/12): Well.
Name: John McAffee #1 @2506

Dear mister King, must we go through all of this again? I am really thinking
of informing the police of your latest tirades as they are getting very rude
and well socially unnaceptable.	Why do you insist on burying small animals
in my front yard? I will admit it first it was kinda cute seeing small animal
parts sticking up out of the ground first thing in the morning but after a 
while it grows tiresome. At least you could bury them all of the way. My wife
has said now on at least ten different occasions when I was beating her that
she no longer loves you. Therfore I have asked her to return the life size
statue of you. Although my daughter like the "pubic" section of the statue
and played with it daily I think the statue was a little on the rude side.
Surely you don't always walk around with such an erection?! Also my daughter
may like being refered to as your 'little bondage suck girl', I find this a
little more than offensive. Furthermore the ridicule of my av products is 
quite boring now. Can you not come up with anything new? Must you use the 
same old problems that are in every version? I find that shows a rather large
lack of imagination on your part. Well I must go now, my little boy wants his
nightly spanking now and oh do I enj...er hopefully will not talk to you at a
later date. Sincerely,
John McAffee

þ STeaLiNG BReaD! 

    By: The BLT. [Brave Little Toaster]
    
    Many times have I the greatest thief in the world been asked how does
    one go about atealin' some bread. Well with a little careful planning
    it is quite easy. And if done right with a minimal loss of life as
    well. The trick to stealin' bread is to not over do it. Although a
    few grenades may seem like the proper tool[5] a mere machine gun will 
    usually more than surfice. And just think about it if you stole have
    stolen a toaster like I told you how in my previous submissions not
    only will you be k-c00l rich but you'll be full to. What more could
    one possibly want!? Ok so you want to get some bread. I prefer the
    sunbeam places. Why? Because they seem to have very little in the ways 
    of security, usually just a little girl out front selling girl scout
    cookies. Easy kill. Once inside there will be a bunch of old ladies
    gun the hags down. They have lived long enough anyways. Look for the
    women who is behing the counter SHE will be tough. I got maced once
    and had to beat the shit of the woman before I killed her don't let it   
    happen to you. Once you have killed everyone grab some bred and head
    for the door. Now comes the tough part, outside the little girl will,
    if you forgot to kill her, be screaming and stuff. Now you can kill
    her or do like fReD does and just scoop her up and take her along for
    the ride. Whichever way is fine by me. So now you have some bread and
    what with the loss of only 5 to 12 lives, not bad, no, not bad at all.

Entitled:  The wonderous voyage of the WaReZ du0d.
Explained: This is a concept piece by none other than G-bunny. It shows
           how the oppressive foot of mankind[large bottom part] is even
           ruled by the forces of nature as displayed by the mighty hunter
           [top-right] killing the water-buffalo[middle]. As G-Bunny put
           it, 'man is never free of death, and death of man.'

þ Ways to be Swass.

    So being k-cOol isn't good enough for you any more? Ya wanns be all kinds
    of swass now? Well too fucking bad. If we let everyone in on our little
    secrets of swassdom the world would be a much sadder place. A place as
    sad as that great ol' MTV. DAMN we wouldn't want that now would we? No
    we wouldn't. That would be bad. Very, very bad.

þ Anger, frustration, humility.

    If I get up off of my lazy ass and go all the way to the local payphone
    [Remember were to LaMe to phreak like REAL du0udz!] and dial up some
    loser's number they had better not just let the FUCKING phone ring, This
    has happened to me recently by a few people. But one in particular, 'Oh
    the phone probably rang 300 times..." Damn he must really suck.

þ Support Sites.

    Ok not support sites but places I know you can at least pick up a few
    meager issues of pud. There are more and if you have some puds up for
    dl email me or someone else and we will try to add you to this list.
