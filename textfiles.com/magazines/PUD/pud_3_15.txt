ş Mail.

    Screw it. I am so sick of the obvious lack of respect show for us in
    the mail we get that I am refusing to include any of it. Ok ok you
    caught me I have yet to get any mail lately that anywhere resembles
    having a pud subject about it. I have been to busy defending my faith
    in DV/X and virus writers and such on fidonet. But I swear I will get 
    back to offending some VNET people soon.[3]

ş Uchchch.

    Have you ever been offensive in public just to offend those around you?
    Well neither have I. Nor have I ever just sat and cracked on stupid-ass
    morons who were sitting right next to me. You know! the kind, you sit 
    there calmly cracking on everthing about them and they fail to ever even
    get the slightest glimpse of what is really going on. Damn it that sucks.
    What fun is there in cracking on some fucking gimp when he doesn't even
    know what the hell is going on? None. So sometimes you have to sit and 
    explain it to them, like, 'hey you fucking gimp I hate you'[2]. To which 
    they usually giggle as thier insecurities take over...damn life sucks... 

ş A PuD TRIP to AT&T.

    The voyage had begun. What voyage? The most epic of trips that I and
    D. Saint had ever been on... I will recount the adventure as best I
    can remember...sometimes me memory gets clouded though...
    
    A saturday night. I'm still at home, so I call up Dig [Digital Saint]
    we decided it was more than high time to visit our local BellSouth and
    AT&T facilities again. So I go to get ready. Lott-da Squinky calls. Of
    course 'paying' for his call as he always does, I call up dig and me
    and Squinky talk about talking girl for a while. Dig somehow sits most
    patiently through this. After about 30 minutes Squinky has to go and I 
    get in the 'bumpin' pumkin and head to dig's place. I pick him up it's
    still of course kinda early so we go and waste time for a while. Yhea!
    Gosh it was exciting. It wasn't really bad until Dig decided that he had
    to figure out how to steal talk packets right then...but finally it gets
    late enough for us to make our rounds. We head to our favorite place
    first for a quick stop by to say hello to the trucks. They were happy to
    see us. Then we head on to the infamous AT&T building. It's in the bad
    part of huntsvegas to begin with but if we had only know... So we cruise
    by twice and we figure it is k0c0ol to park in this used car lot that's
    about 100 yards away. My car seems to fit right in.	We slowly crossed
    the gravel road eyeing our prey. A rather large B0B-wIrEd fence. Easy
    prey for us. Scanning we found a trash-can that would more than suit us
    for making the trip over so much easier. Swish! Over the fence we went 
    heading straight towards this van. It was ours. The spoils of victory
    where savoring in my mouth. When it saw us. We didn't see it. Dig with
    a flash from his pocket pulls out a set of lock picks[true!] and begins
    working on the van. When I hear the pitter patter of little feet. Too
    bad for us they really weren't that little. The eyes of the beast became
    suddenly apparent as it rounded the corner heading straight at us. As
    Dig put it, 'ShIT tHaT's tHe BigGuSt D0g I EvEr DiD sEe!'. The chase was
    on. Running quickly to the fence we encountered the dogs nice little
    friend. Quick change of direction and they were both on our tails. That's
    when the security light came on...Lights everywhere. Barking. Loud, very
    loud sounds and then the unthinkable Dig pulled out his protection. A 
    small gun, he opened fire on the dog blowing it's head to little small
    pieces while he muttered something about how it was miller time. Joining 
    in the fray I pulled out some telephone chord on began to whip the shit 
    out of the other smaller dog. They howled in pain. A guard came. And he
    came fast screaming, pulling some weapon, dig shot him, dead. He laughed.
    I now realized that it wasn't dig with me but some horrible unthinkable
    beast, Suicidal. I ran from his super-assembly self knowing full well how
    great a programmer he was when there was electricity at his house. I lept
    with a leap that only a non-ethnic white could and clambered over the top
    of the fence. Scrambling up from my fall I made it me car and was off...
    Not knowing what had happened to the vile beast that had masquaraded as
    the mighty and proud D. Saint. Of course there was a cover-up...no one
    except me and now you know this tale...

ş Vulgar.

    PUD has been refered to as vulgar lately and sick. True pud has changed
    a little over the day, you have to remember the first issue was released
    in febuary. So not too old by any means we have however seemed to live
    through many things which kill other TFiLE groups. Stuff like the death
    of NO C0URiER. FrED's many arrests and well a general dis-intrest in pud
    from time to time. What makes pud so different? Well I will tell you. We
    are a bunch of stupid-lame moronic inside-joke punks. Were lame as shit
    and we don't really care...course I don't really care about anything...

ş INC? Or is it TDT?

    INC may no longer be our focal cracking wArEz group. It is come to our
    attention that the little sissy members of TDT can suck a good dick. And
    well Hymie says there is nothing better in the morning than a good dick
    sucking so maybe we will let the members of TDT try to be in pud.

ş Hi-BiT H0-DowN!

    People who use a lot of high bit character in thier aliases are c00l.
    No really they are. It's k_c0ol Even. No wait it's K-FuCKing SwiSs EliT3
    c0ol you fucking mooley. And would I lie?

ş The BLT what happened?!?!?!

    Last seen at the local super great spiffy truck stop buying a clear
    pepsi, he has now offically been declared missing. After opening the
    clear pepsi and drinking it. The BLT discover something inside of his
    glass bottle, 37 hyperdermic syringes! With blood flowing from his
    mouth and obvious pain in his eyes he managed to make it to the pay
    phone to call the local hospital when an unmarked pepsi van, tag said
    'PePS1-007' stopped and two goofy looking freaks hopped out and picked
    up the blt and dragged him into the van. He hasn't been seen since...

ş THE DTR.

    The PUD Desk Top Reference HAS BEEN released. Your just not elite if
    you don't have a copy yet. So fuck off you pathetic fucking social
    reject.

ş Corruption.

    Squinky has corrupted us. Therefore we have decided to rename the
    TFiLE in his honor to Phrack. We think it is a wholesome family type
    name that is condusive to our particular writing styles. Thank you
    Squinky and may your mom always taste so sweet.[7]

ş Billy Idol is k-SwISs Elit3 c0ol!

    TV Fucking Sucks. No ifs ands ors about it. It just FUCKING SUCKS. There
    isn't enough redeeming shit on it to even get close to makeing up for
    how fucking vile it is. IT FUCKING SUCKS. No, no, this is a very strong
    emotion I have simply because TV FUCKING sucks. I hate NBC, ABC, CBC,
    and every other FUCKING network. You see Tv sucks. It sucks bad. I hate
    every thing about it. In fact I would go so far as to say it FUCKING
    SUCKS. So do you understand what I am saying? TV FUCKING SUCKS. I thought
    you did you fucking gimp now go watch some...   

ş Places to call.
    
    These are OFFICIAL PUD DIST sites. What does that mean? Um well nothing
    in fact it doesn't even mean they have any puds online. We just feel
    that these places embody the overall charm that is the Pizza Underground.

ş Qoute Sources.

    NOTE: Qoutes in the family-oriented publication are in no particular
    order. Note also that we here at OOGA Inc. Will sue the fuck out of
    your lamer ass if you steal anything from our publications. Why? Why
    will we? Because it's a lot safer than carding and we get to slander
    you in front of family members and the people in the court room.
    
    [1]: Squinky expressing his luv for a SouthCentral Bell operator
         via NO COURiER's three way.
    [2]: Of course this is only an example. Other such phases to use are
         'hey gimp when is your dad givin' you a ride home' or the almost
         immortal, 'jesus what a fucking gimp you are.' If none of the
         above work just sit and stare at the loser for a while or better
         yet just point at them and laugh, laugh hard.
    [3]: I actually logged on to a board that has a ton of VNET subs the
         other day but there was so much shit there I had to get off before
         I got sick. I saw at least 20 messages in 5 minutes that made me
         want to just kill someone. Such is the power of VNET.
    [4]: Note that we here at PUD don't believe in spouse abuse unless the
         fucking whore bitch deserves to get the shit beat out of her.
    [5]: Ten seconds afer loggin on to this board NO COURiER knew it was
         to be a PUD site. By the way they have no puds online. They don't
         even know what the fuck[6] PUD is. But either does anyone else.
    [6]: So have I been using the word 'fuck' just a little to much lately?
         Yep I think I have to.         
    [7]: Ok so she actually tastes kind of tart but she gets really upset 
         when you mention that.
    [8]: A simple statement that cause a hell of a lot more reaction than
         I thought it would on WWiVNet. So um it's true and I'm not any
         stupid label that begins with the phrase, 'cyber'. I admitted it,
         so why can't you?
