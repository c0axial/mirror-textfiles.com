ş Back? Again?

	Damn it. Just when you thought it was safe to read K_RaD TFiLES look
	who is back! Those two real swell guys and thier companions. PuD is
	back and stronger than ever! All PuDs are now distrubted in two, yes
	that is 1+1, formats. Two? The first is the standard .TXT file, just
	done for the hell of it, and the second is an archive. Well what the
	hell is in the archive? Well a hypertext version of the issue, the
	usual text version and maybe some other utilities, files or just 
	whatever in the hell we feel like adding.
	
ş Mail!

    Of course I recieve a few pieces of mail a day, but most of it, ok
    all of it is non-PuD related. But hey some of my general mail, 
    surely must apply to the overall atmosphere of PUD. And what do you 
    know here is a message from a really bright, insightfull, WWiVnet
    particpant.

    RE: Multi-Mail

    For those of you who didn't, look at the back page of the Comics in 
    ş [CUT FOR BREVITY] ş
    Try to refrain from using letter bombs. It's a Federal offense. Happy 
    extremist bashing to all!!!
     <with goofy grin>
         ---Hymie
            =)

    I included this merely because of the last phrase. I had no idea letter
    bombs were illegal. I guess I will have to buy that plain ticket sooner
	than I though. Ooops. 

    There was some more mail, but I lost it. To fucking bad. Wah.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

	I have consulted with my attorney on the matter and it appears that 
the unpermitted inclusion of my mail in your recent publication violates a 
breech of trust, specifically, in federal code 1978 478.23, section c, 
pararaph 173 clearly states: "No publication deriving their name from an 
Italian cuisie may willingly and knowingly include in said publication any 
corespondance from any readers of aforementioned publication without their 
express written consent." 

	Because you did not have my express written consent to include this 
letter in your publication, you are in clear violation of said federal code.
My lawyers have advised me that I would be more likely to win a class action 
suit. In light of this, I have found a person who wishes to join me in a 
class action suit. The Jamaican Bobsledder, commonly known as Satan's Mutt, 
has agreed to join me, citing mental and physical duress. Apparently, your
publication published both his address and phone number without his consent,
thus violating said code and the 1979 Federal Privacy Information Act. Also,
he claims to have suffered mental duress because of several claims of fact 
that you made. If your organization had published:


	"IN MY OPINION, Satan's Mutt is a LaMeR from hell who doesn't know
	 his ass from his girlfriends mouth; a LaMeR who is the epitomy of
	 lameness; a LaMeR who thinks that VBBS is the smoothest thing this
	 side of LamdaMOO; a LaMeR who, IN MY OPINION would love for you
	 to call him at 

	       (205)880-9566

	 and, who IN MY OPINION would *love* to have thirty anchovie pizzas
	 delivered to his address, which, IN MY OPINION is:

		Steve Brady
		2503 Glen Echo Circle
		Huntsville, AL  35803-1539

	 And, also, IN MY OPINION, his biggest "comeback" to anything I have
	 ever posted about him is: 'You suck big donkey dicks.'  "


that would have been perfectly acceptable under current federal and state 
laws, but, as it is, you did not, and therefore, it is not.

	We have contacted your legal department, and we are more than willing 
to settle out of court. However, the offer of sexual favors from Talking 
Girl is NOT acceptable. We have learned from some guy named Paul that she 
CAN NOT put her legs behind her head, she is merely taking lessons 
(although she apparently comes close.) We regret that the offer of sexual 
favors is unacceptable. However, Satan's Mutt is more than willing to 
settle with four (4) hours of use of one of one of NO COURiER's llami.

	I regret that the matter has had to proceed this far. I am certain 
that relationships between your organization, myself, and Satan's Mutt will 
improve greatly in the future. The subpoena was unfortunate, I must admit, 
and I apologize for having your swass computer system impounded as evidence.

	You will find attached a list of claims and amounts we are suing for.

Punitive Damages:       $13.26
Compensatory Damages:   (1) Enough money for me and dig to get to and 
			    complete the pleasure domes in Total Carnage,
			    which, incidentally is so swass it is beyond
			    mere mortal comprehension,

			(2) Satan's Mutt free use of one (1) of 
			    NO COURiER's llami for four (4) hours,

			(3) Your word that you shall never, ever again
			    publish Satan's Mutt real name, number, or

ş Hypertext? Why?

    Why? Do we want to push hypertext on you great pudidians so hard?! One
    simple reason Hypertext is better. MUCH, much better. Imagine having
    all info on the inside jokes, extra fun and just more enjoyment! No
    no not by reading something else but instead by reading a hypertext
    version of PUD. Well what the hell do I need to enjoy this incredible
    enhancement of the already perfect PuD? You need a hypertext reader.
    Like HYPE. It can be found on most large PD boards under the name
    HYPE*.ZIP or ARJ or HAP or LHA or Ha or ZOO or... Just get one. It 
    will open a whole new world in k_rAd TfIlEs t0 yA d00d! Simply look
    for pud_3_*.arj for the hypertext version of this issue. It is worth
    it.

ş Selfishness.
    
    This was a post on Project-X, a damn fine place, that sparked a small
    series of messages. That has now degraded into a discussion of optimism
    versus pessimism. If free-thought, open-minds and a pretty good user
    base makes you all kind of happy then call of Project-X. Email me or
    NO COURiER there. 
	    
    Why you should be selfish sometimes.

        WHAT?!?! Yes everyone should be selfish sometime. Why? 
    Why you ask? Because living your life only for other people is 
    not living. Being nice is one thing, but when your whole life 
    is merely helping others when you really need to help yourself 
    is just completely alien to me. Doing for yourself makes 
    you a better person to the one that matters the most, 
    yourself. If you can't like or love yourself then how can you 
    expect any one else to? Trust yourself. Have faith in 
    yourself, be yourself. Notice the word YOUR. As in you. 
    Yourself. Y O U. Be selfish somtime it will really help you.

ş Where you are.

    Is where you are at. Intresting concept really, isn't it. What is even
    more interesting is that some of you are still reading this trash. Crap
    like this section should not be read so stop now before it is too late.
    No really stop now. Stop now. Now gomer. See Jane. Off the stars and the
    sky is the blue of the earth amd the grecain forumla number moon light
    divine, why the fuck are you still reading, tis better to hog the tree
    than to err is mundain but unlike domestication you should quit reading
    if the sky wasn't pale then it would be underlined with authority, damn
    you are really sad for reading this, lolli-pops haze cross the blaze.
	
ş To kill a LaMeR.

    [A Short-Story by G-Bunny.]
	
	Of course the day was nice. All days are nice in stories. The sun shone,
    the clouds were far and few between and the warmth of the earth warmed
    my entire body. Quickly preening myself I saw across the field a chance
    at a little breakfast before I started the day. Hopping over, in a rather
    jovial mood I might add, I saw the strangest looking creature. Not paying
    it any attention I went about my business and began to eat, then it got
    me. Out of no where this cheap-looking fabric net flew through time and
    space and landed about me. I was trapped. I didn't panic. This ugly two
    legged beast approached me, scooped me up and threw me in a bag. I almost
    knew I was in trouble. Finishing the bite of food in my mouth, I decided
    this was surely what gravy meant when he refered to lamers.
    Plop. My big-ass hit the bars of the cage the beast dropped me in. Nice
    cage rather large, I could only touch all four-sides if I really tried.
    Smile. That's what the ugly-thing did as it look at me. Damn would I love
    to eat it's nose. It laughed. Poked me with a stick. Laughed. Smiled. I
    decided I would have to kill it. 
    It fed me. Cared for me, I played along. It thought I valued it and it's 
    miserable existance. I laughed inside. It thought I loved it, boy was it
    ever wrong. It smiled, I thumped my ass. It petted me, I plotted. Dark
    and desolate were the nights that I thought of chewing it's ears, it's
    nose and oh those delicate eyes...oh that would be so sweet. I planned
    and I planned.
    It let me out. It let me frollic. Tonight it died. I played, it enjoyed
    it. It tried to put me back in the cage, I protested, made cute eyes, 
    damn was this ugly beast ignorant. It let me stay out. I laughed if, if
    only it could have heard my hideous laughter. It died tonight. Tonight.
    Life, Death all were in my control, the poor two legged beast.
    Snort. The creature made odd sounds as it lay there appearing to be a
    sleep. I hopped up by it. It didn't move. I barely thumped it, nothing.
    Now was my revenge. I targeted the neck, that juicy morsel of life, oh
    how sweet it looked. I sighted, jumped bit, and it screamed. Screams of
    ultimate terror and agony. It threw me, hard. I absorbed the impact.
    Sweet juice flowed from it's neck. It frollicked around, dancing the
    dance of death. Screaming, hitting walls. Laughter. It heard me. It 
    turned saw me and my laughter, suddenly figuring it out, too late. It
    collapsed onto the floor, with a strange look in it's eye, one of sorrow
    and remorse.
    I ate well that night.
