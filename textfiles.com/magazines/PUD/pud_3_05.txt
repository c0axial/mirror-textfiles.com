ş Mail, Oh Mail, Oh MY!

    This issue is nothing more than a clearing house for stuff that
    really needs to be distrubted[Or whatever]. I have decided that 
    even though I have nothing to post off in this issue I should
    finish it just for the sake of all of this mail and stuff.
    
ş Mail from Brett Salyer.

    Ooops, guess I shouldn't have started with his real name. Damn there
    goes all the wonderment now... Here is a little example of being a 
    nice congienial user.

     Hey, I am the SysOp of The File Dimension, I have to WORDS for you
  FUCK YOU! You are so cool.. Oh "He is a Lamer"!! (Oh Gosh don't scare me),
  your worse than Mr. Brownstone. I have alot of private users on my BBS
  and they enjoy calling it, your just pissed probably becuase you cant get 
  on it. So if you want to act like a DAMN 2 Year Old go ahead..

                 The Gate Keeper

	 [Reply]
     Oh FUCK YOU!

     Wow that is really original. SO did you or your mommy come up with
     that one? I could care less about your fucking board, obvious by
     my non-attempts to even look at the number cross-eyed. I am just
     SO FUCKING sick of hearing about a PRIVATE bbs. Maybe you need to
     learn some english. Private. That means SHUT the fuck up about it.
     I bet they enjoy calling your little fag-hodge-podge, let me guess
     VBBS board? Was I right? Are you just upset because silentnet died
     so hard? Or it just the fact that you suck... I bet you even have
     an EliTe WaReZ section don't you? God you suck. Yes I mean all of
     this personally. The gate keeper? So your the one I give that 2bucks
     to before I fuck your mom? Oh BTW all flaming intended. Your welcome.

         Afterthought...
         As shown by the message above, I can be quit, well, er um, 
         less than congenial at times. If I have ever been this way
         to you let me take this fine oppotunity to say, well, I 
         MEANT EVERY DAMN word of it. Your welcome, no really...

ş Mail from some mysterious WWIV user.

     This message came from the 'Ghost in the Machine' echo where I have
     been arguing for viri writers and the inability of a virus to do
     some physical damage to your machine.

  Regarding:Not good? Viri? Huh?
  Status   :No Reply Requested

  I really wish you'd shut up.
 
  You're just about as lame as a Cramp. Stop flaming other users in public,
  and act your age.

	 Well now! I have been called a lot of things but NEVER and I mean never
	 has one called me 'lame as a Cramp'. Flaming users in public? Me? Oh
	 come come everyone knows how congenial I am. You just ask people for 
	 some proof about hardware damaging viri and they tend to get all kinds
	 of upset.
       
ş Hymie? Mail, why of course!

	 This isn't all of the mail from Hymie, just a sampling hell if I
	 included more of his mail we would have to call it the PUD-HYMIE
	 newsletter and well damn it that would be nice. Notice how there
	 is a no mail from Digital Saint. I am proud of that. We didn't
	 want mail from that damn LaMeR anyway.

Dear sirs:

     I must respectfully decline your offer of 5/8/93. Although it would be
exceedingly nice to say that my daughter is a star of the silver screen, I 
must state in no uncertain terms that I do not care for the subject matter. 
Somehow, I doubt that the title "Bethy Becomes a Big Girl" is indicative of 
a movie I would like for my six year-old to star in. Although it flatters me 
to hear that she would share the spotlight with such illustrious names as 
Satan's Mutt, Necro, and The Kitten Slayer, I must decline.

                         With Goofy Grin---

Hymie #86 @2506
Dear Sirs:

     I would like to take this moment to thank you for picking my daughter
up from kindergarten after school yesterday. It was quite nice of you. 
However, you forgot to take her home. Although her mother and I appreciate 
the free time, we would greatly appreciate the immediate return of our 
daughter.

                   With Respectfully Goofy Grin---
                              ---Hymie
                                   =)


Hymie #86 @2506
Dear Sirs:
     
     We would like to inform you that we are pleased that you have decided 
to return our daughter. However, the terms put forth by you are not 
acceptable. Rather than have our daughter returned one piece at a time, we 
would very much like to have her returned all in one piece, all at one time. 
We hope this is not an inconvenience to you and your parties.

                     With Sincerely Goofy Grin---
                              ---Hymie
                                   =)

Hymie #86 @2506
Dear Sirs:

     We have discovered that our daughter is *not* the only heir to the
Williamson estate. In fact, she is not due to inherit anything. Due to this
recent turn of events, we have decided to forsake all claims to our daughter.
In short, you can have her and do anthing you want to do to her. She enjoys
bed-time reading material. As her new guardians, I highly recommend that you
read to her O' Henry's "The Ransom of Big Red Chief"

ş Lost Mail!

    If you happened to send in mail and don't see it here[HINT HINT
    CROSS]. That means I lost it. Please get in touch with me so I can
    post your mail here and degr...I mean compliment you in the right
    place, the only place that really cares about you, PUD. We're like 
    your family, except we don't feed you, clothe you, give you money,
    or care about you. Other than exactly the same.

ş Windoze, oh said Bill when I hit him in the nose.[2]

   	 I hate Bill Gates. I hate everything about him. But most of all?
   	 What do I hate about him most of all? Basic. That's right that fine
   	 programming language that continues to be pushed on the young and
   	 computer ignorant as some sort of a miracle. What is it good for?
   	 Not teaching. Surely not programming, I mean all you have to do is
   	 look at some of it's fine WaReZ. Look at VBBS. I rest my case.
   	 
ş Random Acts of Cruelty.

     Yep you hear about them all the time but you wonder who does them.
     Who could do all those mean and just low things? Well I will tell
     you it is PUD. We claim all responsability for EVERYTHING. I'm so
     sorry I didn't put that bolt back right on the shuttle, I'm sorry
     that bomb went off, I'm sorry for the VBBS board that is about to
     go down. I'm just sorry.

ş Who am I?
    
     Do people call you by your handle in public? They do me. I am not
     sure if it is a curse or not, but the words ,'Hey Baph.' Now make
     me turn me head. Thank god no one calls me Phreakazoid or any of
     my other really stupid-asinine names, and GOD FORBID anyone use
     my real name, which just happens, conversely to be, FRED. No 
     releations to fReD tHe HiTmAn of course.   

ş Mooga, Divinity in the Sea.

      Mooga, the waves shine upon your back.
      The sky gleams with blue.
      I hope one day you understand that,
      even though I am not a whale I love you.

      Oh mooga, mooga how fine you are,
      I kick you, spit on you
      despise who you are
      but even I love the waters of blue.
      
      The sea was calm as the man stepped out onto the deck.
      The skies rumbled with hatred at the ship.
      Everyone was running around, the weather was heck.
      But across the sea a whale had flown to hunt the man named Bip.
      
      Oh mooga, mooga how divine you are,
      I sacrifice my child to you
      Tell the tales of my hatred for the bar
      of steel that keeps from those waters of blue.
      
      The sky crashed and rumbled as the ship traveled.
      The man Bip had come to the end of his time.
      But so had I, all trapped in my cell, becoming unraveled.
      The ship borne into a thousand pieces as the mime cried.
      
ş DVX.

   DesQView-X. Everything windoze should have been but isn't. If you 
   enjoy the thoughts of running a real GUI that still has power and
   speed then run it. Damn it DVX is all kind of swass. Run your
   dos programs in virtual screens, run X-Windows stuff, just lie in
   the beauty and simplicity of it's modern utilities. 

ş Preachers of Truth.

    Have you seen the 700club lately? You should. It is full of nice
     wholesome factual information. Yep nothing is better than a little
      700 club to get you laughing in the morning...oh I'm going to hell.
       Well damn it. I guess since I am already going, I may as well make
        it worthwhile. Anyone have Roland DeQuickBasic FrEaKs Address?
 
ş Places to Pick up Some PUD's.

    You may or may not find PUD's at the following locations. There are
    others I have been informed of and to tell you the truth I have no
    idea what the general readership is, I think it is more than 6.[3]
    
    Boards, notice no numbers get them your lazy self:
    Project-X, Caustic Contagion, Cybernetic Violence, Midian, Battle
    of Everymore and some other ones I can't remember right now and am
    way to damn lazy to look up. Give PUD to all your friends. It's a
    bad habit that everyone needs to pick up,

ş Ergo.

    I begat the sea ergo I am the one that rules all ergo I am the
    ruler of you ergo you serve me ergo the sky is mine ergo so are
    all of your dreams ergo I am not the orcan man ergo but I still
    can ergo finish men delight in the depths of seas ergo they like
    to fish ergo I have been accused of using the word ergo to much
    ergo I stop.	

ş More?

    Will there EVER be more PUD's? Well seeing how I just quit my
    job. Damn I feel so sad. BLahehaehehaee, well anywayz dU0dz I
    got some free time now. I think I will spend it lambasting
    poor innocent ignorant VBBS sysops. Hey and if all goes well
    I will be kicked off of SilentNet by this weekend! YES! Of
    course many of you don't understand how difficult this is. I
    the master of common language, second only to Be..er..um N0
    C0URiER in congeniality will be the worst thing SilentNet has
    ever seen, next to the average pathetic moron of a poster.
    Hmm let me show you a cut from a common post...
    
      ...Oh yhea well I can qote more then you!.....
      Stupid Alias
      Even Stupidier Catch Phrase.
	
    That type of message is usually proceeded by, oh 20 or 30 qouted
    line of pure gibberish. Yep nets are going to save the world! Be
    cool and start your own pathetic local net today!

ş Sources for Qoutes:

    [1] Bloom County. Portney the hedgehog when his true species is
        revealed.
    [2] Not a real qoute. I just made it up, no really I did.
    [3] No really more than 6 people read each issue, hey it may even
        be up into the double digits. I guess that means you are all
        kind of elite if you read [PuD] d0uDz!
    [5] Project-X. No longer being the top poster there, you get reset
        at a thousand, the board's name was changed back to Project-X
        after a brief two stint as 'Baphomet's got a lot of posts' and
        unfortunatly Digital Saint had his alias changed back to Digital
        Saint. I thought Pierce the Pokable Pototoe was good.
    [9] Notice how I skipped a bunch of numbers. That's called being
        creative. Yep I am so original it isn't funny. Ok, ok so I'm a
        sad lazy fuck who is to LaMe to change the qoute numbers, yhea
        well my dog can flip.[7]
    [7] Hey shut-up. It makes sense if you are in the right frame of
        mind. Fucked.   
    [13] No believe it or not, Hymie is an actual real person. Sure he
         mistakes gender a lot, steals parts of movie theaters and well
         just has a lot of fun at Krystals but other than that he is a
         real morbid waste of human flesh.
