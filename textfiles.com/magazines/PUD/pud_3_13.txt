   Splat. Splat. Splat. Splat. Splat. Splat. Splat. Damn what a cool word.
   Splat is just so damn great I thought I would say it just a few times.
   No really I figured if I thought it was great you sure as hell would be
   be forced to also. Why? Because like I have been informing you all along
   I am the one higher power you should all worship. And how do we worship
   the mighty Baph? By sending monetary donations. Money. Gods like money.
   It's makes us happy and it will sure as hell get you the afterlife of
   your choice. So send some in today. Reserve your place in your own view
   of heaven for only 19.95.[2]

Special Hello to Erik BLoodaxe, because the Gutzalpus press is publishing

þ INC:=PuD?

    I would like to take this time to announce the greatest of happenings in
    the whole modem world. After many weeks of pure begging and ass-kissing
    we[c00l du0dz at pUd] have decided to let INC in our group. At first we
    were extremely wary of allowing such a pathetic group of people anywhere
    near our fine wholesome publication but after all that ass kissing I for
    one felt it was only right. Sure they're a bunch of cry-baby sissy punk
    old-ass game releasing freaky warez du0dz but in that respect they excel.
    And Hymie thinks that some of the members give the best blow-jobs in the
    whole world. So with thier way-cool attitudes and wonderous skills in
    life we felt they would fit right in. So we decided to let all of them
    in the group, even though crowe thinks that most of them couldn't tie
    thier shoes if it wasn't for mommy and I whole-heartedly agree. 

þ The <STAMP>.

    I wish to form a formal apology to Squinky. I am so ashamed...how do I
    say this. Squinky I am sorry that you have been branded as a PUD member.
    I know your life must be trash now. I wish there was something I could
    do to make up for this horrid turn in your life, but alas I too have
    been branded as a Pud member and well the horror of it is at times even
    too much for me to handle. So be strong and proud and never let them 
    get you down. [For those who don't know, which is all of you, Squinky's
    usernote on a k-C0ol BBS was "Pud Member". I say I am sorry again to him
    for this horrible stamp on his life.]

þ Ooops!

    You know I just now found this, a little out of date and such but I had
    meant to include it in a pud so here it is anywayz du0dz. For those who
    cry you've seen this before I got his message in early may...

Re: Hello.

this is a simple warning about MickeySoft's antivirus product
which is included in DOS 6.0 .  If you are using it, you might was 
well be wearing a bull's eye and screaming "I'm a sucker.. come and screw
me over".  That's right, MickeySoft is the root of all evils.. From
them came WINDOWS.. I shiver in sheer panic.. and then.. OS/2.. I'm still
rolling on the floor laughing.  And now, they can't write their own 
antivirus program.  Oh well.  At least it was funny in the 1/2 hour it
took to find this little tasty slice. 

Anyway, enough of my blathering. 

call INTERRUPT 13h, with AX=FA02, BX=0000, DX=5945 (all hex)
FA is the function code.
02 tells it to return and change the warning options (ie, what to 
 allow/not allow)
BL is the new options.  a 1 is set, a 0 is off.  SO,  0 means
   all of them are OFF.
DX is a constant to make sure you are a legitamite caller. YEAH. RIGHT!
   It MUST be 5945h.  
It will return the old set of options in CL, so if you want to be really
slick, you can set them back after you've had your fun.  
 
To test this out, use DEBUG. It is a strange thing to look at your options
and see them different then they were just a minute ago. 
 
Whatever use you put this to, give me some credit, somewhere.. somehow.
And I would appreciate if this got distributed...  let everyone know the
follies of MickeySoft.
 
                        -- Fenris Wolf

I must give credit to Ford Prefect, who told me where to look..  I explored
beyond what he told me though, and found the beauties of it.

    Now we all know how I LOVE THE SHIT out of moneysoft. SO any time you
    have any thing you would like to see posted about them, send it to me.
    I will include it. Bill gates ]I[ is the anti-christ. Always has been,
    always will be.[3]

þ Why I am not elite.

    It has recently come to my attention that I am not elite. After a call
    to squinky in which I learned the values of lying on the corner in
    public and using a payphone I found out how k-c0ol I wasn't. Umm well
    screw it I was going to list a whole bunch of things that make me not
    k-c0ol eLitE but I believe they are all more than obvious anyways.[4]
    
þ Desperate Times.

    Short Story by: G-Bunny.
    
    Sun. Brightness. The warmth. It was going to be another great day I
    thought as the sun shone on my back warming me throughout. The air was
    fresh the food tasty. And oh how that sun shone. Around me the world
    was at peace. Living in harmony. Perfection in nature. I hopped slowly
    to and fro looking for something fun to do. Alas it all seemed so 
    boring on such a fine day. What was a g-bunny to do? Ahh the warmth of
    the sun. Slowly preening a bug off of my leg I hopped off towards a
    large pool of water. Ahh how relaxing it must feel to be in that cool
    crystal water. The sun's heat penetrated my entire body. Life. Sweet.
    Wonderfull. Divine. I reached the water and slowly bowed my head. Peck.
    After Peck I drank water to my heart's content. Ahh how sweet it tasted.
    The gentle sun, the wonderfull life ahh...suddenly the pain came again.
    As it had every day. Stabbing. Running through my body. Liquid death.
    Flowing in every inch of my body. Draining my life. Killing me soul. It
    came and it came fast. I became weak, to weak to stand. I fell. The
    sleep overcame me how could I resist it was so divine to sleep. 

    "Test Subject 3c," the man in the white overcoat began, "seems to be
    reacting to the drug nicely." He finished writing in data as he watched
    the rabbit in it's small cage. Sometimes he wondered if what he did was
    right, hell rabbit's don't think he said and at that decided to go home
    and sleep.

    [1]: Yes. _Heart of the Sunrise_.
    [2]: And if you act now get your free John the baptist wet spot cleaner
         of souls for only 2 dollars! That's right! No more slimly little
         wet spots to worry about again!
    [3]: Duedz Moneysoft is k-c0ol! Who else can spend years on an operating
         system[windoze nt] and have it come out sorrier than the present
         day version.
    [4]: Qoutes are well.
    [5]: ...or PUD for that matter...
    [6]: When and if you call in ask him about how rewarding common household
         appiances and furniture can be sexually. He knows.
    [7]: Pure Energy after NO COURiER'S funeral when he wanted me 'to go
         back over to his place'. I felt so sorry that I had to refuse him.
         One day I hope I am able to take the place in his heart that other
         such illustrious members of [NuKE] have. But I doubt he can really
         satisfy me sexually.
