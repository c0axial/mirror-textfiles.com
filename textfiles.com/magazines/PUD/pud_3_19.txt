-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    NEWZ! Pure Energy is kicked out o' PuD! Why, oh why was he finally 
    thrown from our shimmering masses you ask? Well because Zer0 said
    so. That's right Zer0 the H3r0 the sysop, and the new leader of
    PuD, of our WHQ BBS kicked his 'PuNK azz' out. Why? Why you ask?
    Because according to Zer0 'Pre Energy' isn't a k@wl enough handEL
    to use. 0ther sw33ping changes are that Zer0 called fo S0mE NeW
    typ0graphy Styles...and I am so afraid of his masculinity that I
    had no choice but to comply...
    
ş eSQUUEZ ME.

    So I was marveling at the ability to get hate mail on internet the
    other day when it suddenly struck me, hey this guy sitting next to
    me sucks. But then I realized that there was no one next to me, it
    was a mirror. So does this mean, I Baph, greatest being to ever
    walk on this rancid shitty-ass planet suck? Of course not. So it is
    obvious that my reflection sucks. So what does that mean? Well it
    simply means that this is whole bunch of utter nonsense that you 
    for some unknown reason continue to read. What? Did you not read
    the title I said it had LESS value than the average PuD issue, which
    by the way is pretty pathetic to begin with, so less than pathetic
    would be pretty damn bad...and it is...so enjoy the rest of this
    issue if you can read it all.
    
ş Why you should go to bed early.

    Ya know when you log onto boards after being up a really long time
    you can easily make the mistake of saying what is ever on your
    mind and well here is a shining example of one such case...

    ManDe Is DivIne!
    
    [Not sure if this is a fact or rumor but based on personal experience I
     would most likely qualify this as a rumor. Ya know the word colour is
     pretty-swell. What's even more swell is you are wasting your time
     reading this. Why? Because you don't know any better. In fact you might
     as well stop since there is nothing of any value anywhere in here. Not
     one single thing. Ok 1! I have found another mandy. She's dumb as hell
     and NC thinks she has vd but she has the kind of ass that if you were
     to wake up with your face in it in the morning you wouldn't mind. No
     sexism intended it's just that nice. If her middle initial is an M, I
     think I may be in love. AMF it is meant to be...So I think that this is
     by far the best auto-post ever and it gives all of you a chance to get
     an inner vision into my most tormentious soul. I think I made that word
     up. It seemed good at the time, but then again even life's most stupid
     plans seem very good at the time. I remeber a time when I went to call
     this girl and sing Lionell Richie's _Hello_, ya know the one that goes:
     Hello I just called to say I love you...Wellll I mis-dialed and ended up
     dialing my neighbors number and singing to thier daughter, who was quite
     attractive by the way. Nevertheless it was something that took me long
     to live down. Well seing how I have given you such a vision into my 
     inner self I think I shall go now, just remember, love is great. But hey 
     so is ice cream on a hot day, and it's a hell of a lot cheaper and 
     doesn't leave nasty emotional scars... Sea ya, Baph...]

ş <burp>

	Uhhh excuse me.
	
ş Uhhh stuff about PuD.

    SO ya know PuD is dead. Yhea, yuh I know you are whining, again? Well    
    yes it is. You see PuD dies for a good twenty days of every month. In
    fact it's a damn miracle that we still write any issues at all. What 
    with NC counting change now and me becoming the head editor for Phrack.
    Sometimes the work load just gets to be a little to extreme...it's those
    time that I do it the deed. The most evil one know to man...
    
ş [THE DEED!]

    Killing cats! Cats fucking suck! There is nothing better than a dead
    cat to look at first thing in the morning. And I should know because
    my cat is very dead. Cats as a specious SUCK. What are they good for?
    You skin them and stuff and barely get enough hide to make socks out
    of. Thier teeth admittitly are good for scrubbing but what other worth
    do they have? NONE. You kick the hell out of them and what do they do?
    They just go lay down somewhere else. You set them on fire and all 
    they do is run around for a minute or two and die. Boring. Now if you
    cut off thier tails and tape it to thier forehead you can have some
    real fun as the cat in agony still tries to play with it's tail. Fun,
    fun, FUN for the whole entire family.

    Imagine if you will a place of ultimate pain and sorrow. What would it
    look like? Just like MTV? Well you are completely right. MTV has to be
	the most self-rightious group on the face of this planet. So what do you
    do about it? Nothing. Why? Because the alternatives are far worse. The
    alternatives? YES! Have you ever forced yourself to watch any CMT or
    VH1 for exteneded periods of time. If you have you wouldn't be reading
    this. You'd be dead. MTV fucking sucks, but hey so does life.

ş PuD_3_18 n stuff.

    So ya know I have been working on this PuD also for like a month. So ya
    know writing shit like this crap isn't that easy. You see being such
    incredible artistic moguls like mE anD nC isn't an easy task. Especially
    when neither one of us wants to work on this trash anymore. Why? Because
    it's stupid. It's moronic and damn it I don't see enough rejects around
    any more to crack on. I don't call VBBS's. I don't hang on FIDONET all I
    do is nothing...ok something...so I have now turned into the biggest
    loser on the face of this planet, YES bigger than NO COURiER, I am now

    Here are some lyrics to a really cool song, just sing it at LARGE public

    That little chicken is my playmate.

    There a little cat by the barn yard gate.
    That little cat is my playmate.
    That little cat goes Meow, meow, meow.
    [Repeat First]
    
    3rd: And all further.
    There a little *animal* by the barn yard gate.
    That little *animal* is my playmate.
    That little *animal* goes, *animal sound*, *as*, *as*.
    [Repeat all previous back to number 1.]

    you are mentioned more than once.

PuD Exclusive: The Bust of Baphomet the Mighty Kitten Slayer(as I remember it)

So, Baphomet gives me a phone call saying "D0UD!@ I AM AT PAYFONE!@ it IS 
1:00am
, It iS a Dark Outside! There is a tree on the left, and a building behind me!
I am in the m00d, let's call Molly!@#"

<For those of you not K-ElYte enough to know, Molly is a machoistic IRC model
for fat people's clothes, she also has a big ol' crush on Baphomet>

I replied, "Ok! What is her number?"

And he said "3144348902, ask for Tom(iT's her c0de name, D0uD1@@@@)".

So, I called it, paying for it like I usually do.

Then the phone RanG, and Molly answered. "Hello@!#?@!?#!@? Iz Tom TherE?"

"Yeha, this is M0lly, d0ud!@#!@!@#!@"

So, the conversation went on for a little while, with the occasional red box
beep, and I decided to go to the bathroom. As this happened, I am not to sure
as to what actually took place, but when I came back, Baph and Molly were goin
at it pretty Heavy.

"Oh!@!!@# BAby1@#!@ Let me here your RED Box!@!@#!@"
"Oh!@!@#!@#!@ Interface with my warez PorT1@!@#!@"

Then, all of a sudden, Baph screams, "D0ud!@#!@#@! I GOT BUSTEDq2WE!@#!@#@!@#"
Then I say, "D0ud1@#!@#!@ HAng Up!P@#!@!@@!#!@#!@#!@@!"

<This is where my memory gets kinda fuzzy, but I'll try to make it as accurate
as possible>

This is how I was told as it went:
Baph hung up, and decided the best way to get out of this was to the offensive.
So, when the first cop got out, he promptly recieved a red box to the forehead.

This was not to effective. The cop got angry, and decided to fist Baphomet, for
elicit toll fraud devices.

Baphomet agreed to the deep cavity search, as it is one of his favorite past
times. The cop also seemed to enjoy seaching his innermost facits.

The other cop sat around and watched.  He was probably enjoying the red box,
because he seemed to be pressing the buttons a whole lot.

When the search was over, the cop was not very pleased. Baphomet had nothing
stuck in his anal cavity, and his asshole was already pretty loose, so the cop
had nothing to break, and was not happy about not getting to live out his male
adolescent fantasies.

Baphomet promptly undid the cops pants, and dropped to his knees. He began to
suck, like he's never sucked before. The cop was almost immediately on the 
brink of orgasm. Before long, the cop was jerking hard, and his cum spewed 
into Baph's mouth, like a Jew blowing his nose on the sidewalk.

Next, Baphomet decided he was being raped, and pulled the cops gun away from 
him and shot him dead. The other cop was to pre-occupied with the red box to 
notice Baphomet boarding the incoming cow. Baphomet sterred the cow right over the cop
and ran his sorry punk ass over. The Red Box was not damaged, because baph
grabbed it up in the chaos.

Soon, Baph was in the mood again, and found a wayward teen hanging out on the
street. He ran him over with the cow, and began to ravish his hoff-imprinted
body.

Then he went home.


The End.
