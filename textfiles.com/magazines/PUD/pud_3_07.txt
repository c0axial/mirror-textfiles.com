ş Mail?

    I don't feel like including any in this issue. It would be fun and
    well rather exciting, but alas I am just to lazy to import it into
    the editor here. And besides PUD is getting a really nice dispersed
    feel to it. That just isn't right. I wrote this issue ERGO it should
    be centered entirely around me. Yep me and none of you. Well ok 
    maybe a little other stuff.

    Ok, ok, I will do it. Some really K_RaD MAiL to be included, but only
    because of the constant prodding and demandind of our loyal reader
    base. Thanks go out to all 8.356 of you.[3]
    
ş OK THE ONLY MAIL IN THIS ISSUE SO ENJOY IT, DAMN YOU.

 Dear Sir:
     
    You are (by admission) my biological father. It has been brought to 
 me attention by a certain unidentified source that you have not paid child 
 support for the last nineteen years. My legal department has calculated 
 that the amount past due, with standard finance charges applied, compounded 
 quarterly comes to a grand total of:

                    $74,381.26

     Please pay the remainder promptly.

                         With Goofy Grin---
                              ---Hymie
                                   =)

   
    Ok so what is the lesson to be learned from this? No mattwe how young you
    are, I was less than 2 at the time, it IS ALWAYS good that you practice
    safe sex. Look what it's gonna cost me...

ş HATE MAIL! HATE CALLS! DO NONE OF THOSE.

    But special thanks must go ouy to Crowe of The Stone Temple of Enoch
    or whatever for this most valued info.

    O..and his home phone is NOT 399-8934.
    Who am I kidding yes it is.

    Thanks again, just in case you are wondering? The guy's first name is
    Roland and he thinks qbasic is swell!

ş Liberation.

    To liberate one besides yourself in pure selfishness. Who says someone
    else isn't free? Who says your freedom is right for everyone else? Who
    says you know anything. You don't. Your the master of your own fate.
    If people paid more attention to themselves and not everyone else they
    might find they like themselves more.

ş B0ARDz!

    I have been making the threat of putting up a board for a very long
    and well pathetic time. So what haven't I? I always get this question
    when I am cracking on some VBBS sysop after he asks me how I did 
    something any idiot could figure out on his board. Well I haven't for
    a number of reasons. One is I am way to damn stingy. I want my little
    ol' computer to myself, so I need a modem that I can put a 16550uart
    on. Why? So I can live in DesQView/X like I normally do. Another? I 
    sincerely doubt I would find enough worthwhile users to make all the
    time and effert expended by me worth it. Sure I would meet maybe one 
    or two really great people, but the rest of them would be nothing more
    than pathetic shit-scum on the edge of humanity. Third. I am never
    satisfied with what I have done. If and when I ever put up aboard it
    will be SuperBBS and no matter how incredible I get it set-up it still
    isn't good enough for me. Nothing seems to satisfy me, just another
    fault of mine. Anyways I think I have rambled on for too long now so
    I think I will shut up.
    
ş VBBS. Another ggggGGGGGGrrrreeat thing about it.

    Let's see VBBS has this amazing built in macro programming language
    right? So how come all you ever see from it is stupid idiotic matrix
    log-off screens? Yep life is good if it makes it harder for you to
    log-off. Make you answer thirty two billion questions. I drop carrier.
    But wait no I almost forgot THEY ALWAYS put a damn version number. Like
    I really care if it is the SUPERLOGOFF version 5334.123412431. I really 
    don't. At least they haven't started slapping swell copyright after 
    them.

ş Llami.

    Where have the llami jokes gone? Everywhere but here. The strange cult
    following of Llama jokes seems to be dead. Why? Who knows, maybe they
    just ran aground but I think the real reason is because Digital Saint
    dis-liked them. For those who don't know him, don't bother. No use in
    meeting a real cybersapien. He is one. And no matter who tells him any
    different he doesn't really care. He's almost free... I shall be there
    one day. But hopefully not as crazy as he is. Damn he can talk trash
    when you are in a really bad mood.

ş Death, the final exit?

    Nope. Not me I am not going to die. It hurts people when you tell them
    this. They don't seem to believe me, nor do they believe in my powers.
    Well to be honest, I am not going to die. It's a simple fact. Maybe if
    you believe it to, you will be able to accomplish such a faith in your
    own being. Death, not a problem.
    
ş I begin to see...

    When does one begin to see? I mean see what and who they really are? I
    would like to know this. I think I have seen myself and while it was
    not a pretty site I am more than willing to accept it. You are who you
    are. You can change yourself, but only you can. Sitting complacent with
    your current vision of yourself is death. It's a waste. It's disgusting.
    Becoming one with yourself isn't some mystical thing. It isn't even 
    corny. It's seeing who you are and who you can be. Me I'm not telling.

ş Sorry.

    I am in a real preachy mood lately. It's, um, nobody's Fault but
    mine.[5]

ş Sources for Qoutes:

    [1]: Nobody in particular, just directed towards most of humanity.
    [2]: Big as in containing more than 2 lines.
    [3]: According to a certain local VBBS sysop who came in his pants
         after being mentioned in a pud that is a high figure. The funny
         thing is, HE MUST have read an issue to realize he was in them.
    [4]: Damn Mr. Brownstone. issssssss so swass. As opposed to Mr 
         Brownstone and Mr. Brownstone[Notice the periods du0dz1]...
    [5]: Yep an actual 'Led Zepplin' qoute. <-Damn an inside joke for some
         one who doesn't even read pud. I am all kind of swass.
    [6]: That's an internet address. No, no, no you can't email me from
         a VBBS board with that.         
    [7]: Yep, that's still the name. Sadly.
    [8]: Well as real as any of can ever hope to be. Ok so he is a little
         bit less than real. Ok so I am babbling. Ok so you suck. Ok, so 
         ok. Ok. Ok? ok.
    [9]: Said on the phone by a swell guy when he saw a person sitting
         figuring square roots, just to do it. It was really fun seeing
         us all laughing at the failures of our race. Damn it was funny.
