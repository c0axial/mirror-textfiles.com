  Yep. This is it. The last issue of PuD v3 - The end of an era.  <Yhea, right>
Well, this will be all for a little while.  I can't speak for
Baphomet, nor would I want to, but I don't intend to go any
further with PuD until some expected changes are in place.
  Well, since this will be all for a little while, the least we
can do is offend as many as possible, right?  Okey Dokey.
  Now, wouldn't it be great to come back with a whole bunch of neat stuff,
like maybe an InterNet mailing list, an authorized support BBS, and possibly
a few members who actually want to be in PuD?  It would be surprising - but
are we capable of such greatness?
  Well,  As far as membership goes, we only know of four or five or six
or however many morons that we can call PuDidian.  Hmm...  how is this?
  WaReZ d00D and SuBLaMeR were responsible for the first true PuD.  Of
course, nobody has ever seen this issue - t'was never released.  An
awful lot of PGA, 4D-Boxing <playable DEMO only>, and area calling made
PuD.  Hmm...  what kept it going was a lot of felonies, some Devo, and a
never-ending bloodthirsty lust for MORE LEMMiNGZ.
  The next generation of PuDidians is still around.  That's us - Baphomet
and me, the extremely intelligent literary genius NO COURiER.
  What came next? Baphomet met Dig and after much stalking by Baph, Dig had
to admit that he was sort of a friend and stuff.  Of course, Dig isn't
really a PuDidian - Being a PuDidian means holding some concrete opinions.
It's hard to have a lot of fucking morons respect and admire you when you
are not a wishy-washy person.  I guess that this ability to get along with
even the flat-out most critically stupid BBS users is what helps Dig's board
stay as Hvegas' best.  Still, it's not RoB0BoARD.
  Somewhere in this timeframe, our pal Steve comes in to the picture, as well
as the divine MaND3.  <We couldn't forget ya', Steve! dU0D!>
  At about this time, fReD got Rusty and EDDDDDDie's <proper VNet Spelling>
busted for copyright infringement/software piracy.  ELiTE!1`!
  Anyway, shortly after this, we found god.  God is also known as Hymie.
I don't know Hymie either, he is a friend of Baph's <like Dig> and I would
not know who Hymie was if he punched me in the face.  Never seen him.  About
this time, the PPP-HHH-un was still going strong on VNet.  Damn, is VNet cool.
VNet is sort of like Homemade Gravy without the lumps.  Through many heated
flames, we met up with Crowe <aka Cross> and actually started to get along.
It's pretty easy to understand how this happened - It takes a fight to find out
who you're friends are.
  After Crowe came harassment from some dirty little geek in Rhode Island.
Once again, Squinky is Baph's friend, not mine.  I think Baph wants to go to
Rhode Island and live in his basement.  Around this time, I died.  Oops.
  We don't have permanent dramatic shadows that make our plain faces pretty.
Touch just one button on this Dual-Deck, Hi-Fi VCR to make flawless VHS copies
of any tape (Even if copy-protected)- and record/playback 2 tapes in sequence,
automatically!
  By now, we had some dU0Dz on our side, and we were doing alright even with
fReD in jail.  He's still in jail, y'know.
  By the way, approximately 97.5% of what you just read is complete bullshit
and has no factual stature whatsoever.  Thank you.

PuD quote on this major, serious issue:
--------------------
   `Sexual harassment is a big issue in every woman's life.
     I've looked in to all of the options, and that's why
                I chose the Today Sponge.'
--------------------

  I'll take a moment to trash the fuck out of some piece of shit journalism
that I stumbled across in USA Today.  <Of course, it's easy to stumble across
shitty journalism in USA Today, but I found this display of stupidity amusing
and interesting.  Maybe you will also.>
  The following is only excerpts from an article, "Low-Tech Problem Hits PC
Networks" by Wayne T. Price of the USA Today staff.  Remember, this is
USA Today, so the article was also accompanied by a 96,000 color 1/4 page
illustration.  Artist's interpretation?  Hmm...
  Friday, August 6, 1993 -
---
 'Cheris Kramarae believed CyberSpace would be the ultimate bias-free
workplace, where sexism, racism and age discrimination did not exist.'

 'So much for sexual harassment not playing in CyberSpace, the electronic
freeway that connects millions of computer users worldwide.'
   ----
  Ahh... it's so clear now.  THAT'S what CyberSpace is... it's the big
electronic freeway!  WHAT FREEWAY?  Let's make it simple enough so even
your average bagel-eating, mindless, middle-aged USA Today reader could
understand.  The only form in which CyberSpace exists is in the imagination.
there is no electronic freeway connecting us all; there aren't millions of
users worldwide who plug in to this.  <Note: 'Plug In:' A reference to MTV'S
brand-spanking new bullshit CyberImage.  Always on the cutting edge.>
  Getting right down to it, there is no way that you can generalize a
material communications system as CyberSpace.  For example, how can you
generalize private boards as CyberSpace when in reality a vast majority of
these boards are not affiliated with others in any shape or fashion?  I know
this first hand, USA Today.  I am not filling blank space in a newspaper with
what Billy Idol taught me.
   And by the way Cheris, you dumb bitch, how can you expect millions of users
to be a happy-go-lucky Apple Dumpling Gang?
  Ok.  So, now that we have that cleared up, shall we go on?
------
 `Sexual harassment by computer was predictable, industry experts say, because
of the huge number of people working and communicating via personal computers.
In the USA, there are 30,000 to 40,000 computer bulletin boards - databases
where people can leave messages to each other.  About 10% of those are on-line
services you buy, like Prodigy.'
  ----
  This passage in a way reinforces my previous statement about the fact that
for the most part NO, there is not enough association between boards to consider
it in any way a network.  Approx. 90% of BBS's are rinky-dink pieces of shit
like the damned QBBS you call every fucking day in and day out.
  Also, how many people do you know use BBS's as a part of their working life?
  ----
 `Most reported incidents of sexual harassment via computer have been at the
USA's universities, where there is easy access to InterNet, the massive,
loosely organized computer network that carries messages for an estimated 15
million users daily'
 `Because there is no commission or government body overseeing transmissions
over InterNet, any kind of regulation of content must be done by individual
institutions that use the system.  Some universities, like Cornell University
stopped offering the erotica news group on their main InterNet network.  "It's
not censorship because you can get it somewhere else," M. Stuart Lynn,
Cornell's vice president for information technologies, says.'
 ---
  I don't want to see a commission or government body fuck with InterNet, and
in a sublime way I think this is the idea Wayne Price c/o USA Today is trying
to plant in our heads. I would be mildly disgruntled and not very amused.
Wouldn't you?  Wouldn't that be the last truly free asset we have?  Sometimes
freedom is butting the hell out, Uncle Sam, and if the InterNet doesn't fuck up,
it's because you stayed out of it's way like you should of.
  If it is at all possible to get it somewhere else, it is not censorship.  Yep.
Really, though.  Honest.
  ---
 `What is happening is that computers are becoming part of real life.
    The terrible things that happen in real life are happening over
                 networks as well as the good things'
                                                - Esther Dyson
                                                  <Release 1.0>
  ---
  Right.  This is not Neuromancer, nor is it fucking Bladerunner.  This is
real life.  Since when do the elements of real life in a slightly different
environment merit more attention than the shit Average Joe has to deal with?
  CyberSpace is better defined as a daydream thought up by a bunch of RPG
playing, CUD reading social rejects.  It gains popularity and is an important
issue in your life because USA Today says so.  Thanks go to Billy Idol and VR
bullshit.  Sure.
  But hey, you can't say that USA Today is by any means inaccurate or
misleading.  Four-page 256 color weather maps CAN'T be wrong.

  Anyway, the other night I was lying in my bed wide awake.  There was something
I wanted, but I just couldn't put my finger on it.  I just couldn't figure it
out.  After much tossing and turning, I finally realized what it was that I
needed so badly.  I needed some head.
  I leapt out of bed and immediately called up PEPSi MaN.  He ran all the way to
my house, sporting a brand new pair of Buster Browns he stole from work, and
proceeded to call his friends over to my house.  Within an hour, all three of us
were making passionate TRaDeZ and PePSi MaN sucked my dick for a copy of Novell
Dos 7.  Damn, what great head TDT gives.  Much better than INC or THG.

  Right now, somebody is leeching warez for the first time.

           Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas BUSTED!
  Yep.  Whoooooops.  Fear And Loathing, a somewhat large 0-DaY K_RaD WaReZ
board in Alabama, was busted for having Novell Dos 7 and the new QEMM up for
download.  Yes - It's true.  With a little help from an insider, Quarterdeck
and those nutty Novell guys busted the hell out of the little faggots.
Criminal proceedings are expected.  Can you spell lawsuit?
  How did this happen??  Only PuD knows... and this is why you will soon learn.

  Hello, My name is Squinky.
      I have a problem.
    I'm 12 years old and I can't reach a doorknob.

               ELiTE!!1!

  How elite are you?  Well, we here at PuD are very, very, very elite.
If you have any doubts about your personal eliteness, you should stop
reading now and call back your local Celerity BBS.  With practice, you
will be elite and will be deemed a social reject by anybody with a
damned thought in their skulls.
  Remember, being elite is elite, so don't let the simple fact that you
are a loser with absolutely no life whatsoever hinder you.

----------------
    PuD StoRy?

  All of the PuD stuff EVER will be compiled and thrown up on a BBS somewhere
soon.  With this, you can be assured that you have everything in the whole
world that pertains to PuD. The demand for this is overwhelming - You would
be surprised how many people love to have such ELiTE info on their computers
and stuff.  Being as K_RaD as we are, we'll make it as big and wasteful as
possible so it's more KKKKK uploaded by you!  Yes!

  Well, that's the end of PuD3....   we shall return with more neat-o
naughtiness!  Or, maybe we won't.  Who cares?
  PuD is undergoing reconstruction! For a while there will be no PuD shit
to be L3@CHeD oR UPLoADeD!  Oh well.  So you won't be able to get Obv/2
after all.  But hey, you're elite and we've never heard of it.  Or, maybe,
just maybe, we had a fucking copy of the trash while your ass was still
masturbating on VX/Net in Fort Worth.  Nah.... no way!  What the hell?

  Want to be cool?

 Since we are up to no good here in LiMA, right now is thr perfect time
to join!  Ya wanna' know how?

 Simply catch up with Baphomet or I, and say the secret password phrase:
"dU0D!!! KaN i B iN PuD!!?!1?!/"
  That's all it takes.  Really.  Leave your voice number, and we'll call you
and stuff, and maybe even harass you.  Hey, you'll feel important!

  Wanna know how to become a PuD DiST SiTE?!
Everybody knows that to be cool, your T/FiLE group has to have dist sites.
Also, for your BBS to be cool, you have to be a dist site for something.
  All you have to do to be a dist site for PuD is say so!  Advertise that
you are a dist site.  You don't even have to carry PuD!  If you want,
you can even TELL us that you're a dist site!  Wow!  See your BBS activity
skyrocket!  boast of your PuDidity now!
