BALDNESS & RELIGION

by:
B. Hathrume Duk


Apparently in biblical times, removing one's hair or having one's hair
forcibly removed served a number of purposes. For example, as a means of
expressing remorse during mourning:

	"Both the great and the small shall die in this land: they shall not
	be buried, neither shall men lament for them, nor cut themselves,
	nor make themselves bald for them."

					JER 16:6
 

Some sources also list it as a potential form of punishment:

	"Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve
	a great service against Tyrus: every head was made bald, and every
	shoulder was peeled: yet had he no wages, nor his army, for Tyrus,
	for the service that he had served against it."

					EZE 29:18


Overall, the official church view seemed to be accepting of baldness:

	"And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he is bald;
	yet is he clean."
	
					LEV 13:40


In fact, the bible goes so far as to warn potential teasers of the bald:

	"And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by
	the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and
	mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up,
	thou bald head."

					KI2 2:23

	"And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name
	of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and
	tare forty and two children of them."

					KI2 2:24


The Mormon church seems to be the first church with its
own church-guaranteed anti-balding protection system. Apparently,
the citizens of Utah are scarcely a balding bunch:
 
        Alma 11:44
	Now, this restoration shall come to all, both old and young,
	both bond and free, both male and female, both the wicked and the
	righteous; and even there shall not so much as a hair of their
	heads be lost; but every thing shall be restored to its perfect
	frame, as it is now...

	Englishmen  tried to jolt their  hair follicles into action
	by brushing  cold Indian tea  and then fresh lemon on their
	scalp. Less gentrified folk tried to fertilize their scalps

Everyone wants to understand art. Why not try to understand the song of a
bird? Why does one love the night, flowers, everything around one, without
trying to understand them? But in the case of a painting people have to
understand....People who try to explain pictures are usually barking up the
wrong tree.

Question:
What are the desirable qualifications for any young man
who wishes to become a politician?

Sir Winston Churchill's Answer:
It is the ability to foretell what is going to happen tomorrow,
next week, next month, and next year. And to have the ability
afterwards to explain why it didn't happen.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The "green revolution" to feed hungry mouths in the
developing world has a promising new star, scientists said Monday: the hairy
potato.
   Unlike most potatoes that are highly susceptible to pests, said scientist
K.V. Raman, the hirsute spud fights them off.
   The shaggy tuber is developed from a wild potato with thin hairs. These
hairs on the plant's stalks and leaves secrete a sticky substance that traps
and kills small insects as they feed or reproduce.
   The plant combats a larger common pest, the Colorado beetle, in a different
way. The insect eats the leaves and gets a serious case of constipation from
the sticky secretion. The bug's stomach bloats, crushing its ovaries and
curtailing its reproduction.
   While the tufted tater will reduce such environmental and financial costs,
it still tastes like a normal potato, said Prof. Robert Plaisted of Cornell
University, which has been developing hybrids under contract to the potato
center for 15 years. The new spud species also has the same nutrition value as
currently cultivated potatoes, and similar yields and growing characteristics,
he said.

Recently I saw a film of Gandhi when he came to England in 1930. He
disembarked in Southampton and on the gangway he was already overwhelmed by
journalists asking questions. One of them asked, "Mr Gandhi, what do you
think of modern civilization?" And Mr Gandhi said, "That would be a good
idea."

...and, speaking of NUDE HEADS...
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	 Andrew Martinez is a sort of student of nakedness.  In his
	 senior year of high school - during afternoons spent 
	 smoking pot and "questioning the universe" - he began
	 wondering about why people wear clothes.  He decided it
	 was "stupid," and began to research the legal definition
	 of lewd, and the laws and history of nudity.

The Nude Guy From Berkeley even made the TV news here at the Netherlands.
In my opinion it is surprising, that such a news item reaches Dutch TV.
The case reminds me of an event of one or two years ago, which only
reached a small local newspaper. The story is about as follows:
 
Rotterdam, Three male students were arrested last weekend. Somebody phoned
the police because the students were naked and walking over a car.
The students denied having walked over the car. They were put in cell (naked),
allowing all (male and female) police officers to have a look
at them. After a short period they were released; they had to walk back home.
In the nude.

			Henk-Jan van Tuyl


"Did you hear about the naked guy at Berkeley? I suppose it's OK if he
wants to go to class nude, but can you imagine having to be the person who has
to sit in the same seat in the next class? Especially if the seat's still
warm? But I suppose they were justified in suspending him, I heard 3 or 4
fellow students were using him to cheat on an anatomy test."

			Jay Lenno


It is true, people here at Santa Cruz enjoying getting naked.  A couple times
a year there are 'nude parties' in "the Meadow above Elf Land".  Cowell
students are also know for their nude lawn sliding during times of rain.  Some
of these 'lawn people' do decide to venture off and run around campus, but
this is not too common.  I think most of the time they have been smokin a
little Bill Clinton if ya know what I mean.  My roommate enjoys lawn sliding
and says the only real problem is the sprinkler heads.

	Martinez, who grew up in Cupertino, CA, took his first nude
	walk a couple of years ago, strolling down Saratoga-Sunnyvale
	Road.  Last year, he went to class bare-chested.  This fall,
	layer by layer, he worked his way down to nakedness and then
	had about two dozen others join him at a "Nude-In" he
	organized Sept. 29 in Sproul Plaza at the University of
	California at Berkeley.  The idea was to demonstrate how
	useless and repressive clothing is.

In Kenya, any foreigner caught streaking "will be immediately arrested, escort
directly to the airport in the nude, and put aboard the first available aircraft
to his country of origin."  However, local citizens can streak all they want.
