	"When the 'oppressors' become too strict, we have what is
	 known as a police state, wherein all dissent is forbidden,   
	 as is chuckling, showing up in a bow tie, or referring to     
	 the mayor as 'Fats.'  Civil liberties are greatly curtailed
	 in a police state, and freedom of speech is unheard of,
	 although one is allowed to mime to a record.  Opinions
	 critical of the government are not tolerated, particularly
	 about their dancing.  Freedom of the press is also
	 curtailed and the ruling party 'manages' the news,
	 permitting the citizens to hear only acceptable political
	 ideas and ball scores that will not cause unrest."

"ELEVEN

Thirty spokes share the wheel's hub;
It is the center hole that makes it useful.
Shape clay into a vessel;
It is the space within that makes it useful.
Cut doors and windows for a room;
It is the holes which make it useful.
Therefore profit comes from what is there;
Usefulness from what is not there.



SIXTEEN

Empty yourself of everything.
Let the mind rest at peace.
The ten thousand things rise and fall while the Self watches their return.
They grow and flourish and then return to the source.
Returning to the source is stillness, which is the way of nature.
The way of nature is unchanging.
Knowing constancy is insight.
Not knowing constancy leads to disaster.
Knowing constancy, the mind is open.
With an open mind, you will be openhearted.
Being openhearted, you will act royally.
Being royal, you will attain the divine.
Being divine, you will be at one with the Tao.
Being at one with the Tao is eternal.
And though the body dies, the Tao will never pass away."

"Astronomer Harlow Shapley estimates that there are some (10 to the twentieth
power) stars within the range of our telescopes.  When Shapley associates a
planetary system with only one in a thousand stars, we may assume that it is
a very cautious estimate...Without quoting fantastic figures or taking
unknown galaxies into account,
we may surmise that there are 18,000 planets comparatively close to the
earth with conditions essential to life similar to those of our own planet.
Yet we can go even further and speculate that if only 1 percent of these      
18,000 planets were actually inhabited, there would still be 180 left...
...But what can have induced the pre-Inca peoples to build the fantastic 
lines, the landing strips, at Nazca?  What madness could have driven them
to create the 820-foot-high stone signs on the red cliffs south of Lima?
These tasks would have taken decades without modern machines and
appliances.  Their whole activity would have been senseless if the end
product of their efforts had not been meant as signs to beings
approaching them from great hights.  The stimulating question still has
to be answered:  Why did they do all this if they had no idea that
flying beings actually existed?"

any of the pet food she gave him.  So Havens started feeding Pogo pot she
found growing near her house in Ottawa, Ontario.  Everything was fine---until
she was arrested on possession charges.  The Canadian police didn't believe
her tale.  But Judge Bernard Ryan did.  He concluded that the pot was

	" 'So tractable, so peaceable, are these people,'  Columbus
	wrote to the King and Queen of Spain,  'that I swear to
	your Majesties there is not in the world a better nation.
	They love their neighbors as themselves, and their
	discourse is ever sweet and gentle, and accompanied with
	a smile; and though it is true that they are naked, yet
	their manners are decorous and praiseworthy.'

	All this, of course, was taken as a sign of weakness, if
	not heathenism, and Columbus being a righteous European
	was convinced the people should be  'made to work, sow and
	do all that is necessary and to adopt our ways.'  Over the
	next four centuries (1492-1890) several million Europeans
	and their descendants undertook to enforce their ways upon	
	the people of the New World...

	...The Raritans resisted arrest,...The Dutch soldiers ran
	their bayonets through men, women, and children, hacked their
	bodies to pieces, and then leveled the villages with fire...

	...The Five Nations of the Iroquois, mightiest and most advanced      
	of all the eastern tribes, strove in vain for peace.  After
	years of bloodshed to save their political independence, they
	finally went down to defeat.  Some escaped to Canada, some fled
	westward, some lived out their lives in reservation confinement."

ONE OF THE most baffling things about America is that despite its essentially
vile profile, so much beauty continues to exist here.  Perhaps it's as so
many thinkers have said, that it is because of the vileness, or call it
adversity, that such beauty does exist.  (As balance?)"

"RAGE
=====

You are the dark song
of the morning;
serious and slow,
you shave, you dress,
you descend the stairs
in your public clothes
and drive away, you become
the wise and powerful one
who makes all the days
possible in the world.
But you were also the red song
in the night,
stumbling through the house
to the child's bed,
to the damp rose of her body,
leaving your bitter taste.
And forever those nights snarl
the delicate machinery of the days.
When the child's mother smiles
you see on her cheekbones
a truth you will never confess;
and you see how the child grows-
timidly, crouching in corners.
Sometimes in the wide night
you hear the most mournful cry,
a ravished and terrible moment.
In your dreams she's a tree
that will never come to leaf-
in your dreams she's a watch
you dropped on the dark stones
till no one could gather the fragments-
in your dreams you have sullied and murdered,
and dreams do not lie."

"We find, in talking to nongay people about homosexuality, that there is
an enormous interest in what actually goes on in bed.  We could
summarize the whole subject by saying that gay men do all the things	
men everywhere either do or would like to do, and women offer each other
all the things that women everywhere like or would like to have done
to them.  In most cases, lovers take turns being the active or passive
partner, but of course no hard and fast rules exist about who does what
to whom-it's a matter of individual preference.  There is no way we can
describe everybody's love life because infinite possibilities for
variety exist, all of them doubtless practiced with vigor and
enthusiasm by any number of people.

But we can try, for the sake of parents who want to know, to be a
little more specific..."
