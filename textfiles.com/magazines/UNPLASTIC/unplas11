***{ From the UW CS bulletin board }***
 
I am absolutely not making this incident up; 
in fact, I have it all on videotape. 

The tape is from a local TV news show in Oregon, which sent 
a reporter out to cover the removal of a 45-foot, eight-ton dead whale 
that washed up on the beach. The responsibility for getting 
rid of the carcass was placed upon the Oregon State Highway Division,
apparently on the theory that highways and whales are 
very similar in the sense of being large objects.
 
So anyway, the highway engineers hit upon the plan -- 
remember, I am not making this up -- 
of blowing up the whale with dynamite. 
The thinking here was that the whale would be blown into small pieces, 
which would be eaten by sea gulls, and that would be that. 
A textbook whale removal. 
 
So they moved the spectators back up the beach, put a half-ton 
of dynamite next to the whale and set it off. I am probably 
not guilty of understatement when I say that what follows 
(on the videotape) is the most wonderful event in the history 
of the universe. First you see the whale carcass disappear in a 
huge blast of smoke and flame. 
Then you hear the happy spectators shouting "Yay" and "Whee." 
Then, suddenly, the crowd's tone changes. You hear a new sound like "splud." 
You hear a woman's voice shouting "Here come pieces of... MY GOD...." 
Something smears the camera lens.
 
Later, the reporter explains: "The humor of the entire situation 
suddenly gave way to a run for survival as huge chunks of 
whale blubber fell everywhere." One piece caved in the roof of 
a car parked more than a quarter of a mile away. Remaining on 
the beach were several rotting whale sectors the size of condominium units. 
 
There was no sign of the sea gulls.

Subject: Aboriginal "Kidney-Fat" Guards?
Date:  9 Oct 93 23:47:56 GMT
 
Yesterday, National Public Radio (here in the USA) aired an interview with
an Australian Aboriginal who's in the States promoting outback tourism.
Besides playing his digeridoo (sp.?) and beating time with a couple of
boomerangs, he told us about the three kinds of guards his particular group
of people have to keep themselves on their own territory and out of
trouble.  The third, and most fearsome, of these guards are the
"kidney-fat" guards, whose job it is, when someone just won't behave, to
punish him as follows: hypnotize him into a deep sleep ("hypnotize" was the
word used by the Australian); slice open his back and cut away the
kidney-fat; sew him back up with human hair.

Aborigine Denied Bail to Face Tribal Spearing
 
Perth, Australia (Reuter) - An Australian Aborigine, 
accused of murdering his common-law wife, was denied bail on
Friday so he could be speared for his crime under tribal law.
 
Neville Gable, 36, had asked district court judge Mary
Anne Yeates to release him on bail so that his wife's
relatives could carry out "pay back" tribal justice by
spearing him below the belt.
 
His lawyer Derek Hunter of Perth's aboriginal legal
service said that if Gable did not face his wife's angry
family, then his brother might be speared instead. Gable has
been charged with the stabbing murder of his wife on June 12.

Yes, we plot no less than the destruction of the West.  Just the other
day a friend and I came up with the most pernicious academic scheme to

I will push it backwards over him.

Parents in Grand Saline, Texas, removed a picture of Santa Claus from a

	John Trubee & The Ugly Janitors of America album:
	"Naked Teenage Girls In Outer Space."
 
**Music is the only thing that matters.
 
**We do not care about being popular.
Only idiots yearn for the approval of others. Only idiots become popular.
 
**We do not care about material things
Only idiots waste their lives haggling over money. Only idiots
accumulate vast wealth.
 
**Everything human is alien to us.
 
**Worrying about what the neighbors will think is the most
despicable kind of cowardice.
 
**We do not heed social dictates.
Only weaklings need rules to give themselves an illusion of 
security and a false sense of personal worth.
 
**Complacency and unreflective optimism are a kind of intellectual
and spiritual death, characteristic of the grinning imbecile. 
 
**In a world of lies, the man who utters the truth is bound to appear insane.

Plastic Surgeon Shot by Defender of "Aryan Beauty"
 
Chicago (Reuter) - a white supremacist motivated by his  
hatred for anyone "feeding off aryan beauty" has confessed to 
the execution-style killings of a Chicago-area plastic surgeon
and a San francisco hairdresser, officials said on Tuesday.
 
Jonathan Haynes, 34, will undergo psychological testing to
determine his fitness for trial in the killing of Dr. Martin  
Sullivan, whom witnesses say he gunned down on Friday.
 
In a suburban Chicago court on Monday, the dark-haired
Haynes, who refused a lawyer's services, said: "I condemn fake
Aryan cosmetics. I condemn bleached blond hair, tinted blue
eyes and fake facial features brought by plastic surgery."

This Guy is Just Too Cute!
 
One night when I was in high school, everybody was going to a card
game, and I didn't have any money.  These guys were all rich, and I
told them I needed some money.  So this guy Billy turned to me and, as
a joke, said, 'I'll give you a hundred bucks in you let the front
wheel of this Volkswagen roll over your head.'  I thought about it,
said, OK, lay down, and they undid the brake.  Then I got the $100,
went to the game and won $2,000.  My friends laughed and said, 'You've
gotta have meat loaf for brains to do that!'

    bought for the highly reasonable price of $1.8 million.  The picture
    consists of a square of white paint surrounded by some red paint.
    Yet, before the proletarian masses vomit their ignorance and
    philistinism at we art lovers, it might be worth instructing the
    unwashed in what this picture is really about.  Its original title
    was 'Enormous Fucking Con Trick Played on the Stupid Bourgeois

    a much greater and larger work aimed at revolutionizing perception
    and understanding.  I suppose this will go above the heads of
    ordinary people - how tiresome they are."

Bush War Record Questioned 
 
New York (Reuter) - Harper's magazine said on Monday that
a World War Two document indicated that former U.S. President
George Bush may have committed a war crime when he was a
bomber pilot and that the U.S. media declined to report the
document's existence during the 1992 presidential campaign.  
 
The document is a previously classified "aircraft action
report" on a bombing run in the South Pacific in which a  
Japanese trawler ferrying military supplies to a
Japanese-controlled island was sunk by U.S. Navy planes, 
including a bomber piloted by Bush. It says bombers involved 
in the attack strafed lifeboats, breaking international law.

"There are *some* classic nerds, complete with plastic pocket pen

them at computer conferences, seminars, expos and users' group 
meetings.  (Any business in which a major player is named Rod Canion -- 
founder and former CEO of computer manufacturer Compaq -- can't be 
bad!)  And a woman who sparkles when she's discussing megabytes and 
hard drives can have her pick of the pack."

. . . "Junkies" is an unsuitable term for intravenously challenged persons,
who should be referred to as "the epidermally accessible" so as not
to degrade their lifestyle.  In addition, I do not like the word "dope"
for the pharmaceutically liberated substances in question because it both
devalues the laboatory technicians who create it and insults the

Addictive drugs of this sort should be called "non-prescription chemicals

Anyhow, I have some clearer details of the Bake Sale (I actually
heard it start).
 
Dan (Dave is close) called into the Rush Limbaugh program to commment
about something he read on a photostat of Mr. Limbaugh's newsletter.
Limbaugh cut him short and said something to the tune of "Wait, you
can't do that, that is violating my copyright.  Why don't you *buy*
a copy?"  To that, Dan replied "Because my wife won't let me spend the
$29.95."  Limbaugh, just ready to grant him a "scholarship" of $29.95
so he could receive the newsletter free of charge, thought of the
recent events of grade school children holding bake sales to collect
10s of dollars to send into Mr. Clinton to reduce the national debt, and
flippantly said "Well Dan, why don't you hold a bake sale and earn
the money."  And that was that.
 
Well...  A later caller called in and explained that he was in charge of
some billboards in the Fort Collins area and he would put up a billboard
free of charge for Dan.  Then another caller called in and said that he
was a trucker and he would not only drive down any promotional material
from New York (where Limbaugh's show is) to Fort Collins, but he would
also move Dan to anyplace in the U.S. if his wife divorced him.
 
To move the story along, the thing gained momentum and eventually they
had between 35,000 and 70,000 people show up in Fort Collins.  Dan made
$40,000 by selling cookies, which he used to pay school loans with, and
everyone there had a good time.
 
I had a friend who went, he said it was the best time he has ever had,
and the people were so nice (no vandalism or excess littering).  There
were a couple of flower pots broken, but that was done by a police horse
kicking them in by accident. He brought back some of Dan's cookies.

    is the story of the history and development of this much neglected
    branch of surgery from its earliest times to the present day,
    including brief biographic sketches of those who were its
    pioneers.  The author of this gem of medical history was Charles
    Elton Blanchard, M.D., and the book was originally published in
    1938 by Medical Success Press and reprinted by AMS Press in 1978.
 
    I'd also like to take this occasion to quote from the first

In a downtown high-rise, on the 52nd floor lived two young men
(Many say they were a gay couple) in a large two bedroom appartment.
The view was fabulous, overlooking Mount Royal and the St-Lawrence
river. They had separate bedrooms, but shared one thing: The aquarium
in the living room. It was a huge one, on a wheeled table. to
facilitate cleanng, and had nearly 90 different tropical fish. Jerry,
24 had a bright idea, he wanted new fish, and bought 30 pirhanas and
put them in the aquarium. However, his room-mate, John was very upset
when he saw that the pirhanas ate ALL of his fish instead of the fish
food. All that was left in the tank were hungry pirhanas. In a fit of
rage John took the aquarium to the roof top pool on the 72nd floor,
while no one was there, and emptied the contents in the pool, and
went back home.
 
The next morning an elderly couple who used the pool for their
morning swim, was reduced to a mess of blood and BLEACHED BONES. The
police finally traced the pirhanas to Jerry, arrested him on two
counts second degree murder.

was awaiting the September start-up of the Science-Fiction Channel.  When
Sci-Fi replaced the 'fish channel,' complaints were so numerous that the

runs 14 hours per day, sharing time with the Bravo Channel."

Gameboy is Ready to Zap Hotel Room Bibles: Indep 3 Sept 1993
 
In the hotel room of the future, writes James Cusick, spiritual comfort,
traditionally found in the Gideon's [sic] bible, 
will have a rival. - Nintendo.
 
The UK hotels of the Jarvis Group, among them the Piccadilly in
Manchester and the Mount Royal in Edinburgh, have just concluded trials
of hand-held Nintendo Gameboy machines in all their rooms. The demand,
especially from executive businessmen, has astonished the hotel group.
 
"In a year we will be delivering services to 20 million people away from home," said Russell Braun, Nintendo's manager of engineering
 
The association of Christian business and laymen (who founded Gideons
International in 1899) is not worried. The association distributes
1 million bibles every 10 days, at an annual cost of $53m. Worldwide
there are 600 million Gideon's [sic]. "We are still battling with other
competitors like the Koran," said Brian Hickford, manager of Gideons
in the UK.
 
The Church Of England, said "The Bible survived television being put in
hotel rooms, it will survive this. The word of God is for everybody.
Ninendo isn't. Anyway, the Bible is far more interactive than any video
game."

I came across the following example of the advertiser's craft on a label
pasted to the inside of an instrument at the local antique instrument
shop. The instrument claims to be a banjo, although it looks more like
the unfortunate result of a collision between a mountain dulcimer and a
typewriter. The instrument is all wood, finished in black paint and has
"Japan Music" written in gilt on the outside. My best guess is that it
was made sometime between 1920 and 1960. It has seven strings, six of
which are identical and cover a >total< of about an inch of width. There
are a number of typewriter-style keys with labels like "5#" which, when
struck, hit all seven strings simultaneously and produce a sound very much
like dropping a bowling ball in a piano, only much quieter. The instrument
has thus far defied all attempts to tune or play it. The greatest
entertainment has come from reading the label inside the soundhole. I
reproduce it here with every spelling error and comma in place. The
address at the bottom is legitimate, in case you decide you want to order
your own.

said a pep rally stunt last week that burned four students won't
ever be repeated.
 
The four suffered severe burns on their buttocks from sitting

"We pulled a brain-deader, and we will make sure we don't do
it again," Kromminga said.
 
The girls were chosen by their classmates for a stunt last week
to see who could sit on the ice the longest.  Dry ice, or solid
carbon dioxide, can be as cold as 112 degrees below zero.
 
The four were treated at Silverton Hospital.
 
Dr. Frank Lord said some of the girls may need skin grafts.
"The truth is, I've never seen any frostbite on this part of the
anatomy," he said.

2. THE MOST REALISTIC MOVIE IN HISTORY
    In 1914, a Hollywood motion-picture company signed a contract with
Mexican revolutionary leader Pancho Villa in which he agreed to fight his
revolution according to the studio's scenario in return for $25,000.  The
Hollywood crew went down to Mexico and joined Villa's guerilla force. The
director told Pancho Villa where and how to fight his battles.  The
cameraman, since he could only shoot in daylight, made Pancho Villa start
his fighting every day at 9:00 AM and stop at 4:00 PM--sometimes forcing
Villa to cease his real warring until the camera could be moved to a new
angle.  When the completed film was brought back to Hollywood, it was found
to be too unbelievable to be released--and most of it had to be reshot on
the studio lot.

Police in Japan are trying to curb an unsavory trade. In early
September, three business men stocked around 90 vending machines 
in outer Tokyo with used underwear "guaranteed to have been worn 
by a Japanese schoolgirl."
 
So far about $211,000 worth of used panties have been sold.
The businessmen put the machines, which also dispensed
obscene magazines and videotapes, near primary schools and
other meeting points for young girls. Each garment sells for about $29.
 
After searching the rule books, the police have finally charged
the three entrepreneurs with violating the Antique Dealings Law, which
stipulates that dealers need a license.  Used panties as antiques?  The
police say that some of the underwear was bought from second hand dealers.
The trio may also be charged with swindling, if it can be shown that the
panties on sale had not really been worn by female students.

around in bed reading novels and eating Nescafe out of a
jar with the spoon.  But it's because of the Mac.

Ugly Suits:

Globe and Mail:
 
Another gnuisance on the fringe
 
Brian (Godzilla) Salmi has started a political party to cash in
on voter disgust with politics - the Gnu Democratic Rhino Reform
party.  There are only two things worth knowing about the party:
the "G" in "Gnu" is pronounced, and it's out to replace the
Rhinoceros Party as the voice of political spoofery in Canada.
 
The Gnus formed last month after splitting from the Rhinos over
a dispute involving a stripper and a professional dominatrix, he
says.
 
Mr. Salmi will be easy to spot at all-candidate forums.  He dresses
in a green Godzilla suit.  He intended the outfit as an anti-nuclear
warning, but his costume is so tattered and stupid-looking that most
people mistake it for Kermit the Frog.

Beautiful Plans for World Marketin . . . er, Peace:
 
"We now sell virtually the same toys all over the world.  So it stands
to reason, if all these kids are playing with the same toys, how could
they ever possibly fight with each other?  There's a common thread
about how they grow up and what they play with.  I thinks that's
terrific.  It makes for one world."
 
	- Charles Lazarus, founder and C.E.O., Toys "R" Us

Couple Beheaded For Incest   
 
    New Delhi (Reuter) - An entire village watched in silence
as the uncle of a young man and his bride chopped off their
heads with an axe for defying social norms, newspapers
reported on wednesday. Satish, 21, had eloped with Sarita, 20,  
from the village of Khandrawali, the newspapers said. After
their marriage, the couple settled in Delhi. But Satish was
Sarita's uncle. Village elders considered the marriage
incestuous and an insult to a sacred relationship.
Khandrawali's 250 families, all outcastes, never forgave the
runaways, and they were beheaded after being lured back to the  
village by a tale that Satish's father was in trouble.

And They say English is UGLY . . . 
 
Gonzo is no dweeb, says New English Dictionary.
 
London (Reuter) - Grunge, dweeb, scuzz and gonzo have 
officially entered English language.  The latest edition of the  
shorter Oxford English Dictionary, to be published next month,  
also includes chattering classes and cereologist.
 
Grunge is "a style of rock music characterised by a   
raucous guitar sound and a lazy delivery". A dweeb is a   
"person who is boringly conventional, puny or studious". A
scuzz is an "unpleasant person". Gonzo, coined by american
journalist hunter s. thompson, is a "crazy person".
 
Chattering classes are articulate professionals who talk
about society and culture. Cereologists study crop circles.

Duck Pond Saves Skydiver 
 
Napier, New Zealand (Reuter) - A 22-year-old novice
skydiver escaped with only a cut over the eye after his main
and reserve parachutes failed and he plunged 1,100 metres
(3,600 feet) into a marshy duck pond.
 
Klint Freemantle, recounting the freak accident on 
Saturday on New Zealand's north island, said his main
parachute did not open and his emergency chute tangled up.
then he saw he might hit the pond, a metre (40 inches) deep.
 
"I splashed down before I thought I would," he said. "the
first thing I did was stand up and say 'Yes!' then I reeled
the chute in."
