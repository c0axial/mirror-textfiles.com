	Hello...pssssttt
	Is this thing on? Are we recording?
	Can I get some more of that pate?
	Folks, for humanity's sake I have
	scanned-in eight photographs for delivery through e-mail.
	Ten more rolls of film have yet to be developed, so be
	warned of a possible addendum to this set at a later date.
	
	Thanks, Gertrude...[mumbles something about manifest destiny ]
 
	I will describe to you in detail these first eight photographs
	and contemplate our debauchery.  Expect an outrageously explicit version
	soon to be released by Random Spouse Publishers.  It will

"Yes, we plot no less than the destruction of the West.  Just the other
day a friend and I came up with the most pernicious academic scheme to

I will push it backwards over him."

...but we beat them to it
 
 
 
	First, I must apologize for the scan quality.  I had to scan
	at a local under-equipped service bureau that reeked of
	chicken pot pies and had a faulty heater which whined.
 
 
 
F.O.P. #1:  Funky Sanduski Parking Lot
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
	After the mad dash from NY to OH, it was getting to be sun-up.
	We parked the big green buggy and got a hotel to crash in till noon.
	When we woke, we sped directly to Cedar Point Amusement Park
	and had a little mushroom pizza for breakfast.  The park went on forever.
	Deb discovered and named the "The Disposable Masses".  Those were
	the MTV Pepsi Nike kids who all seemed to look exactly the same.
	Deb noticed the absence of The Art Tragedy Crowd which she is all too
	familiar with in NYC -- ( those poor sad cats in all black who are also
	black on the inside because life isn't fair. )
 
	We rode every coaster (twice we rode the one we named
	Disco-Coaster) and then it began to rain so we hit the
	IMAX 7-story theater and rode out the last hours of daylight
	watching a Spielburg-esque ditty called Flying.  We deemed it
	an appropriate film.
 
	In the parking lot, I changed my clothes and checked under the hood
	(of the car).  Little did I know that we were being watched by Ed & Edna
	who were parked in a car near us. They asked us over for a fat joint and
	Ed kept dropping ash on his sunburned pot belly.  
 
	Edna asked, "Wannabeer?"
 
	"We jist been gowin' into the park n' ridin' then comin' out here n'
	burnin' up a fatty n' drinkina beer.." said Ed, "..say, you needa beer?"
 
	They kept trying to push beers on us.  We told them we had to drive
	to Chicago before we fell asleep so no thanks.  Then we drove
	to Chicago before we fell asleep.

F.O.P. #2:  Hip Chicks Hangin' On The Corner
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
	The days in Chicago were filled with sun.  Laying around in it,
	telling stories, was our biggest priority.  Met a guy in the park who
	was trying to learn English so he asked us to explain to him a phrase
	from a high-brow Jungian philosophy text he was reading.  When he
	heard I was going to San Francisco he told me I should get into
	the cappuccino business because it was booming.
 
	The nights were full of booze, obnoxious music and natural oils
	from The Body Shop.
 
	I said to my pal Kristina, "Hey, why don't you quit your job and
	drive with me like two bats out of Hades toward the western lands?"
 
	She said, "OK."

"Rock music is the most brutal, ugly, vicious form of expression...sly, lewd -

>From the Boston Herald, 5/6/93:
 
        Portland, OR - A would be William Tell trying to shoot a fuel
can off his friend's head missed his mark, and shot him through the
head.  Neurosurgeons say it's a miracle the victim survived with no
brain damage.
 
During a drinking bout of a group called Mountain Men Anonymous in
Grants Pass, Michael Kennedy fired the arrow as Anthony Roberts, 25,
stood by a tree with the can on his head. It went into Robert's right
eye and 8 to 10 inches into his brain, but missed all the major
arteries.
 
Paramedics saved Robert's life by restraining him when he tried to pull
the arrow out himself in the helicopter on the way to the hospital.
 
Surgeons removed it by drilling a larger hole around the tip at the
skull's back and pulling it through.

F.O.P. #3:  Video Arcade Photo Booth Squish
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
	We stopped at a one-hour photo place and, while we waited, went next
	door to play pinball.  They had one of those nifty photo booths.  We
	squished into it and acted like a cackle of dunces.
 
	We had to leave because all the men in the arcade (and believe me,
	there are a great deal of interesting men in Chicago arcades in the
	late afternoon on a Sunday) wanted to get close to my pals.   
	Kris tilted.  I matched and Deb got some multi-balls.

   E. Frenkel, a Soviet "psychic healer and mentalist," felt he had
   gathered the "psychic-biological power" to stop a speeding train, 
   so he stepped
  in
   front of one to prove it.
 
   "First I stopped a bicycle, cars, and a streetcar," wrote Frenkel.
"Now I'm going to stop a train.  Only in extraordinary conditions of a direct
threat to my organism will all my reserves be called into action."
 
   Frenkel jumped in front of a train near the city of Astrakhan "with his
arms raised, his head lowered, and his body tensed."
 
   The train ran over and killed him.

  Rescuers tried but failed to save the life of 39-year-old Kenneth
Thorne, who suffered a heart attack at his home in Quincy, MA.  
Thorne weighed between 700 and 750 pounds.
 
   The _Patriot_Ledger_ of Quincy reported that paramedics "found Thorne
wedged inside a small bathroom, unconscious and not breathing."  When
Thorne wouldn't fit in the ambulance, police called Tino's Gulf for a
flatbed-style tow truck.  Thorne rode to the hospital strapped to the bed
of the tow truck, but arrived too late.
 
   "He was a very large man," said Tino Vitali, owner of Tino's Gulf.

The bombing of the World Trade Center destroyed a 54-by-8-foot mural by
Cynthia Mailman that was on the wall of the building's commuter train
station.  The loss wasn't the artist's first.  In 1978, she was delivering
a large portrait of God as a naked woman when it flew off the roof of her
van on an expressway and was run over by a car.  In 1980, an outdoor mural
she had painted three years earlier was bricked over.  In 1981, she was
storing all her work in an empty house in her neighborhood.  The building
caught fire, and all but one piece of art was destroyed.  "I used to think
that everything else dies and art alone exists forever," Mailman said,
"but it isn't true."

F.O.P.  #5:  Moon Over Chicago
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
	A picture to remember our crazy youth by.  I set the camera on this
	big metal thing in an ally.
 
	DEB:  "Do you think you should put the camera on that big metal thing?"
 
	ME:   "Why?"
 
	KRIS: "Because it says, 'DANGER: 10,000 volts."
 
	ME:  "Aw Hell.  That's just there to scare you.
		Don't believe everything you read."
 
	I set the timer and it popped.  We weren't really ready for the picture
	and the flash caught us with our pants down, but we couldn't
	take another photo because a tremendous flash of  power  ripped out
	of the big metal thing and knocked us unconscious.

8 Things To Avoid While Going Cross Country
 
 
#8--	going on skis
 
#7-- regardless of how much you think you are going to like
	it, you will wish, at least two-thirds of the way
	through the trip that you brought more than that
	one tape of ukelele music.
 
#6--    attempting to pick-up road kill from all 48 contiguous
	states.
 
#5-- re-enacting Evil Kanevals rocket sled stunt over the
	grand canyon (but with your 82 olds station wagon)
 
#4--Thinking the car is in forward when it is really
	in reverse while you are pulling out of a biker bar.
 
#3-- Falling for that damn Gasoline from water and 
	pills scam.
 
#2--	Forgetting your bottled human Adrenalin Gland
 
#1--	Two words:      Fog Machine

F.O.P. #6:  Tattoos
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
	We put Deb on an airplane back to NYC because she had to work...
	which by that point was a very foreign concept to me.
 
	Kris said, "Let's get tattoos and hit the road."
 
	It began to downpour as we headed to the Chicago Public Library.
	We were researching designs for the body modification ceremony.
 
	Kris said I should be the one to go first. I sat in the chair, 
	signed the
	form, gave him my design and he began to grind black ink into
	my skin with a vibrating needle.  Strangely erotic and overly bloody.
 
	I now have a modified Torrii on my arm.  It's a symbol pilfered from
	the Shinto.  It is a spiritual portal derived from two Japanese symbols
	meaning bird and perch.  Sailors think it's good luck if they can sail
	their boat through the harbor Torriis.  The vertical pillars represent
	the sky and the horizontal, the earth.  Now I got a bunch of pesky
	demons flying in and out of my arm!
 
	I told Kris she would have no problem with the pain if she had ever
	survived a dentist.  What I didn't know is that the place she got
	hers is one of the most tender on the body.  (lower back above the
	buttock)  She bit into a towel and almost fainted.
 
	Now she has a tiny blue dolphin jumping on her back.  The artist did
	a good job with a few shades of blue.  When she wears her bikini, it
	looks like the dolphin is diving out of her bottoms. 
 	Freedom. Intelligence.
	The scan came out horrible so you can't see her's at all really.

In a _Toronto_Star_ column, Peter V. MacDonald shared these examples of
questions asked by lawyers during courtroom proceedings:
 
   "And how old a woman are you, sir?"
 
   "Now isn't it true that when a person dies in his sleep, in most cases
he just passes quietly away and doesn't know anything about it until the next
morning?"
 
   "Was it you or your brother that was killed in the war?"
 
   "And the youngest son, the 20-year-old, how old is he?"
 
   "Were you alone or by yourself?"
 
   "Were you present in the courtroom this morning when you were sworn in?"
 
     "How many times have you committed suicide?"

F.O.P. #7:  Visiting Jesus, Buddha, Krishna & Bozo On The Rocky Mountains
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
	This trip rebooted my mind.  On top of the mountain, we got real
	close to the super funky disco deity!  That goddess of truth, light
	and inexpensive parking!  That lord of coolness.  We were at a point
	where we couldn't remember what day it was and didn't really care.
	The thin air, hot sun and cool snow cured our ills. We lived the second.
 
	We also met the Trustafarians.  Young men & women, all-white, with
	dreadlocks, nose rings and a trust fund.  America at it's best!

  From the March '93 "Yankee" magazine:
 
  A prisoner at Boston's Deer Island House of Corrections
  wrapped himself in a white sheet and climbed onto the
  prison roof, refusing to come down until someone named
  all six children on "The Brady Bunch."
 
  Five hours later, guards were still scratching their heads.
 
  Disgusted, the prisoner descended and requested a transfer
  "to anywhere."

	Another view from the top of the mountain.  Again the scans are bad,

Subject: Fractured English, banjo dept.
 
 From: Rich Stillman x6135 <RSTILLMAN@HBS.HBS.HARVARD.EDU>
 
I came across the following example of the advertiser's craft on a label
pasted to the inside of an instrument at the local antique instrument
shop. The instrument claims to be a banjo, although it looks more like
the unfortunate result of a collision between a mountain dulcimer and a
typewriter. The instrument is all wood, finished in black paint and has
"Japan Music" written in gilt on the outside. My best guess is that it
was made sometime between 1920 and 1960. It has seven strings, six of
which are identical and cover a >total< of about an inch of width. There
are a number of typewriter-style keys with labels like "5#" which, when
struck, hit all seven strings simultaneously and produce a sound very much
like dropping a bowling ball in a piano, only much quieter. The instrument
has thus far defied all attempts to tune or play it. The greatest
entertainment has come from reading the label inside the soundhole. I
reproduce it here with every spelling error and comma in place. The
address at the bottom is legitimate, in case you decide you want to order
your own.
 
                Special Quality Banjo

        can be enjoyed upon this Banjo.

* The New Yorker magazine reported in April that artist Nancy Rubins's
work, appearing at the Kasmin gallery on Grand Street, consisted of a room
"nearly filled" with "old mattresses dotted with mounds of partially
mashed Entenmann's cakes and suspended a few inches off the floor."  No
other information about the exhibit was given. [The New Yorker, Apr93]
