	Editorial
	^^^^^^^^^


	Well, The Unplastic News is back for the fifth time and I have
	a tiny story for YOU, the viewer.

	On election morning I awoke and stumbled into the crispy
	morning toward the local fire department to cast my ballot.
	The 6:07am fog smelled like pumkin.

	As I crossed the street, I overheard a conversation between a
	young couple.  "She's not a nun,"  the man said, "she's from
	Phoenix."

	I went in and voted anyway.

	Later at home, as I was cleaning a shelf, I upset a paper which
	fell to the floor.  I read it.  The paper held a quote from the
	AP wire and read,

	"! KICKER !

	Nun Wins $1 Million in California Lottery

	(Sacramento, California)--In California, a nun who has lived for
	54 years under a vow of poverty has become a (M) millionaire in
	the state lottery's Big Spin Game.

	Sister Josephine Contris, assigned to a convent in Redwood City,
	is pledging to use the money to support a financially strapped
	retirement home in Santa Maria.

	With members of her order in the television studio audience
	cheering her on, Sister Josephine turned down a sure 40-thousand
	dollars to take a chance for the one (M) million-dollar prize."

	
	Just as I finished reading, my friend Toeless Peetie Schamata
	arrived with an atlas.  He said, "Yo, Thal.  You gotta help me
	plan my road trip.  I'm driving from Phoenix to Sacramento in
	July with my brother Two-Digit Willie and his friend from the
	band Anal Flapjack, the one with the ear infection."

	He stopped speaking and stared at me.
	I cracked awake suddenly.
	I was doused with epiphany and sparked with satori.
	I again smelled the pumpkins.
	I awoke because I remembered that just three days before, Toeless
	Peetie Schamata had arrived at my Holloween party dressed as a nun.

	It was then that I realized, suddenly and with hope, that I would
	have no more election media to take my mind off quacky synchronicities
	and things would be getting back to normal.  Only this time, deeper.

(Associated Press)
 
OROVILLE - A recent burglary victim attending a neighborhood watch meeting
spotted her television, Christmas stockings and other lost items in the home
of the neighbor hosting the meeting, police said.
 
"The clincher was that the woman putting on the neighborhood watch program
was wearing the victim's dress," Oroville police Detective Art Hatley said.
 
The victim, Nancy Miler, sat calmly through the discussion by neighbors and
two Oroville police officers, Hatley said.
 
"She kept her head about it.  Then, when the meeting was over, she waited
outside for the officers and told them what she had seen," he said.
 
Detectives obtained search warrants for the home and for a locker the
residents rented at a storage business.
 
When they served the warrants Wednesday, they found about $9,000 worth of
stolen property belonging to Miller and other burglary victims in both
places, police said.  They also found an ounce of methamphetamines.
 
Denise and Jeffrey Lagrimas were arrested on charges of possession of
stolen property and methamphetamines for sale.  They were booked into Butte
County Jail and released on $10,000 bail each.
 
Miller lost the television set, dress and other items when her storage
locker, at the same business where the Lagrimases had a locker, was
burglarized in mid-November.

	"Money is life.  Not in the sense that without money you
	starve.  Not in the sense that capital gives one class power
	over the entire lives of another class.  But in the sense that
	money is the token of, and the key to, every human capacity.
	The power to spend money is the power to live. According to
	the legends of publicity, those who lack the power to spend
	money become literally faceless.  Those who have the power
	become lovable."

Jane and I got mixed up with a television show -- or as we call it back
east here: TV -- a clever contraction derived from the words Terrible
Vaudeville. However, it is our latest medium -- we call it a medium because
nothing's well done. It was discovered, I suppose you've heard, by a man
named Fulton Berle, and it has already revolutionized social grace by
cutting down parlour conversation to two sentences: "What's on television?"
and "Good night".

We are now, there can be no doubt, in the final historical seconds of that
crisis - a crisis which involves the end of history, our departure from
the planet, the triumph over death, and the release of the individual from
matter. We are, in fact, closing distance with the most profound event a
planetary ecology can encounter - the freeing of life from the dark
chrysalis of matter.
 
In other words, we humans may be released into a realm of pure self-
engineering. This was Blake's perception. This is where we came from. This
is where we are going. And it is only to be approached through cognitive
activity.

        Terence McKenna

	"The feminist agenda," Pat Robertson observed in a recent letter
	to his supporters, "is not about equal rights for women. It is
	about a socialist, anti-family political movement that
	encourages women to leave their husbands, kill their
	children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism and become
	lesbians."


================================================================================


        On the national scene, the long, twisted road to democratic practice
is winding down. For the first time in my life it seems like someone who I want
to win is going to finally win. The Reagan-Bush-Quayle  monstrosity, a beast
which ruled the land throughout my teenage years and in to my early twenties,
has slimed for the last time, or at least until the next election.

        Political Poetry
from Roger Simons colum in the Baltimore Sun
October 28, 1992
 
Bill Clinton's excuses run hollow.
With logic that's quite hard to follow.
When asked about beer,
He said with a leer,
"I tasted, but I didn't swallow."
 
A tycoon made us swoon in the spring
Not a pol! Just clear answers he'd bring.
Though once in absentia,
He's back with dementia!
Thinks we're calling for him to be king!
 
There's been trouble ever since he began.
Iran-contra... S&Ls ... and there's Dan!
But the biggest non-winner
Was when George left his dinner
On the prime minister of Japan

Ronald McClanahan, 41, was arrested in September when he tried to rob a
Columbia, Mo., gun shop with a knife.  He tried to open the electronic
cash register by randomly pushing buttons, but then became frustrated and
tried to carry it away until the cord got caught, yanking him to the floor.
When an employee approached with a shotgun, McClanahan first lay perfectly
still, then bolted up, yelling, "Go ahead and shoot me," then tried to lug
the cash register out again.  Then he dropped it so he could flee, but when
the drawer broke open, he stopped to grab some money.  As he ran for the
exit, gun-wielding employees blocked him.  When police arrived, they had
to use force to loosen his grip on the money.
