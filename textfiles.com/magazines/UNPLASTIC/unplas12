First of all, I don't think anyone could claim to be media literate if he or 
she didn't understand that one of the principle functions of commercial media 
is not so much the provision of information or entertainment, but the 
segmentation and packaging of audiences for delivery and sale to advertisers...
It's the audience which is the real product of the media, and not the programs.

JUST IN CASE YOU HADN'T HEARD -- THE '60S ARE OVER

It finally happened -- Bob Dylan has allowed The Times They Are
A-Changin' to be used in an advertisement on television. The ad
went on the air this month, but it is not the first -- only the
most amazing -- example of the commercial use of a rebellious
classic.

-- Song: The Times They Are A-Changin', Bob Dylan 
-- Product: Coopers & Lybrand, accountants

For an undisclosed sum, Dylan permitted the Big Six firm to use
folkie Richie Havens' rendition of his protest anthem. The company
cannot use Dylan's name, even when discussing the spot.

	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The times, they have a-changed.
	Timothy Leary, the '60s LSD guru, was detained Tuesday at the
Austin airport for smoking -- a cigarette.
	Leary, 73, said he wanted to draw attention to people being
``demonized'' by the politically correct.
	``We were told by an official that smoke in the airport would
get us a citation. So we did look for a policeman to check this
out,'' he said.
	Leary was detained at the airport for about an hour. The offense
carries a maximum $500 fine. A court hearing was scheduled for May 18.

WILLIAMSBURG, Va. (AP) -- Gumby was taken from Scott and Suzanne Dye's 
front porch on Memorial Day, and the theft caught the media's
fancy for about a week, especially after a ransom note was
delivered to a radio station.
	A group calling itself the ``JEHU Revolutionary Front'' sent a
ransom demand, along with a snapshot of Gumby bound and
blindfolded, demanding that Gov. George Allen donate $5 to a
Richmond homeless shelter. The governor declined to meet the ransom
demand.
	Scott Dye said that the 7-foot stuffed toy was returned
Wednesday night. ``Now, we're having a party,'' he said.
	Crystal Manuel, 16, said she saw Gumby sitting outside a tent at
a campground over the Memorial Day weekend and asked the boys in
the tent if she could have it. ``I love Gumby,'' she said.
	But when she saw a television report Wednesday evening of
Gumby's abduction, she knew she had to return the stuffed toy.
	``I wanted Gumby to come home, but I never thought it would
happen,'' Mrs. Dye said as Gumby was put back on the front porch.
	Allen spokeswoman Melissa Herring said that although the ransom
demand may have been made in jest, the governor refused to pay
``for several reasons, the first being that a crime was committed
when the Gumby doll was stolen, and if he paid the $5 it could
cause a copycat incident to occur. And we certainly don't want that
to happen.''
	Officials at the homeless shelter said they knew nothing about
the ransom note.

The nature documentaries are as absurdly action-packed as the soap operas, 
where a life's worth of divorce, adultery, and sudden death are crammed 
into a weeks worth of watching - trying to understand "nature" from watching 
Wild Kingdom is as tough as trying to understand "life" from watching Dynasty.

     * In December, Rory Thompson, 57, was granted a patent for a device that
        permits viewers to see an ordinary color TV, or computer screen, in
        three dimensions.  Thompson developed the device in Risdon Prison
        Hospital in Hobart, Australia, where he has lived for ten years.  He
        was declared insane following a 1984 conviction for killing his wife
        and flushing parts of her body down a toilet.

EUREKA, Ill. - In a grade school classroom a decade ago, 11-year-old
Martha Tennis carved a bust of Ronald Reagan in a bar of Ivory soap
and sent it to the president.

Now 21, married and working in a nursing home, Martha Schumacher
is amazed the her carving is enshrined with presidential jelly
beans, yo-yos and a mini-samurai helmet in a new Reagan museum
at his alma mater, Eureka College.

"Oh gross," she said, when told her sculpture was on display
along with here 1984 fourth grade picture and a note apologizing
that she didn't have enough soap to carve Nancy Reagan.

That's something that [English philosopher] David Hume pointed out a couple
of centuries ago. In his work on political theory, he describes the paradox
that, in any society, the population submits to the rulers, even though
force is always in the hands of the governed.

Ultimately the governors, the rulers, can only rule if they control opinion
- no matter how many guns they have. This is true of the most despotic
societies and the most free, he wrote. If the general population won't 
accept things, the rulers are finished.

	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- ``Star Trek'' creator Gene
Roddenberry got his final wish -- his ashes flew on a space shuttle
sometime after his death in 1991.
	NASA confirmed Thursday what his widow, Majel Barrett
Roddenberry, divulged at a local Space Congress banquet Tuesday
night -- that Roddenberry's ashes flew on a shuttle and were
returned several days later to Earth aboard the spaceship.
	``It is true,'' NASA spokesman Brian Welch said Thursday
morning. ``It was approved as a personal effect'' of an astronaut,
he said.
	Mrs. Roddenberry, an actress who appeared in the original and
subsequent ``Star Trek'' series, said her husband ``would have
given anything to have been able, just once, to go into that great
galaxy he dreamed about, where so few men have gone before.''
	Roddenberry died of a heart attack in October 1991 at age 70.

After 2 1/2 years of looking, the Visible Human Project at the National
Library of Medicine (NLM) in Bethesda, Md., settled recently on the
cadavers of a 38-year-old man and a 59-year-old woman to represent the
online human body.  Using digitized photography, computerized tomography,
and magnetic resonance imaging in 1 mm sections of the cadavers, the
project will build a 42-gigabyte, three-dimensional image database of
the two for distribution over the Internet.  Project planners hope to
combine the imaging data with other types of information -- journal
articles, for example -- using interlinked information structures.
According to project officer Michael J. Ackerman at NLM, investigators
had some difficulty finding the "average" man and woman between the ages
of 20 and 60 that they needed: two individuals who were healthy but had
died suddenly without physical trauma. It seems that far more men than
women die in this way, usually from drug overdoses, he says. The pair,
who will, in a sense, represent the first human beings in cyberspace,
are called "Adam" and "Eve" by project workers.

The _Toronto Globe and Mail_ reported in October on the religious
importance of Pepsi-Cola in the town of San Juan Chamula, in southern
Mexico. Practicing a blend of Christianity and worship of Mayan gods,
many parishioners believe their leaders' doctrine that because Pepsi
has more bubbles than Coca-Cola, it is closer to the sun and therefore
more powerful. Bottles of Pepsi appear among holy artifacts inside local
churches, and some leaders believe the cola has healing powers. (Coca-
Cola officials say the dominance is due purely to Pepsi's payment of
kickbacks to the leaders.)

Since we must restrict our conversation to what we have in common, our 
global-village campfires are not as productive as the old tribal ones. We 
can find subjects of interest to all only by *erasing* content, paring away
 information - the things that interest me may not interest, or even be 
comprehensible, to you. A couple of years ago, for instance, Britain was 
rife with rumors that McDonald's was sending money to the Irish Republican 
Army. It turned out that CNN had reported that the hamburger giant had set 
up individual retirement accounts for its employees. This was a mix-up 
between two of the nations on earth that have the most in common, including 
a language - the only solution is to simplify.

Workers at The Science Place in Fair Park were perplexed by several
inquiries in the days before Tuesday's solar eclipse.  Some callers
found the timing inconvenient and wanted to know why the museum hadn't
scheduled the event for a weekend so more people could attend.  Others
wondered if there was a rain date for eclipse-watching activities.
Texas' next major solar eclipse should be more accomodating - May 20,
2012, comes on a Sunday.

Famed scientist Carl Sagan apparently didn't cotton to Apple Computer Inc.'s 
having borrowed his name for a new computer.

After receiving a complaint from Sagan, Apple changed the internal code name of 
an upcoming model from "Carl Sagan" to "Butt-Head Astronomer," the San Francisco
Chronical reports.

The scientist asked the company to stop using his name after an article about 
the new model appeared in MacWeek magazine, the newspaper said.

The Butt-Head Astronomer - referred to as BHA for short- is one of three Apple 
models that will use the PowerPC microprocessor, which was developed by an 
alliance of Apple, Motorola Inc, and IBM Corp.

Fired Worker Spices Up Woody Woodpecker Film

CHARLESTON, W.Va. - A disgruntled employee added part of an
R-rated movie about a prostitute to the end of at least 500
copies of a Woody Woodpecker video, forcing 20,000 copies
to be recalled.

UAV Corp. of Fort Mill, S.C., took back copies of the 30-minute
tape, "Woody Woodpecker and Friends No. 3015," last month after
complaints, company President Jerry Pettus said Friday.

The fired video production worker added a two-minute scene
from the 1991 movie "Whore," staring Theresa Russell as a
woman who turns to prostitution after a bad marriage.

During the last period of our friendship [Damian] had said that we 
had been given a god to worship who represented only one arbitrarily 
separated half of the world (it was the official, sanctioned, luminous
world), but that we ought to be able to worship the whole world; this
meant that we would either have to have a god who was also a devil or
institute a cult of the devil or institute a cult of the devil alongside 
the cult of god.

Today [1988] fifty corporations own most of the output of daily newspapers 
and most of the sales and audience in magazines, broadcasting, books, and 
movies.  The fifty men and women who head these corporations would fit in
a large room.  They constitute a new Private Ministry of Information and culture.

Americans, like most people, get images of the world from their newspapers, 
magazines, radio, television, books, and movies.  The mass media become the 
authority at any given moment for what is true and what is false, what is 
reality and what is fantasy, what is important and what is trivial.  There 
is no greater force in shaping the public mind; even brute force triumphs 
only by creating an accepting attitude toward the brutes.

Despite the fact that more accidents happen in the home than elsewhere,
increasing efficiency of communication and of controlling human
behavior can, instead of liberating us into the air like birds, fix us
to the ground like toadstools. All information will come in by
super-realistic television and other electronic devices as yet in
the planning stage or barely imagined. In one way this will enable the
individual to extend himself anywhere without moving his body - even
to distant regions of space. But this will be a new kind of individual -an
individual with a colossal external nervous system reaching out and
out into infinity. And this electronic nervous system will be so
interconnected that all individuals plugged in will tend to share the
same thoughts, the same feelings, and the same experiences. There may
be specialized types, just as there are specialized cells and organs
in our bodies. For the tendency will be for all individuals to coalesce
into a single bioelectronic body.

In regard to propaganda the early advocates of universal literacy and a free 
press envisaged only two possibilities: the propaganda might be true, or it 
might be false.  They did not foresee what in fact has happened, above all in 
our Western capitalist democracies -- the development of a vast mass 
communications industry, concerned in the main neither with the true nor 
the false, but with the unreal, the more or less totally irrelevant.  In 
a word, they failed to take into account man's almost infinite appetite 
for distractions.

In their propaganda today's dictators rely for the most part on repetition, 
suppression and rationalization -- the repetition of catchwords which they wish 
to be accepted as true, the suppression of facts which they wish to be ignored, 
the arousal and rationalization of passions which may be used in the interests 
of the Party or the State.  As the art and science of manipulation come to be 
better understood, the dictators of the future will doubtless learn to combine 
these techniques with the non-stop distractions which, in the West, are now 
threatening to drown in a sea of irrelevance the rational propaganda essential 
to the maintenance of individual liberty and the survival of democratic 
institutions.

Apparently two Chinese nationals working for a software company in Denver

Those who have grown up in this packaged world accept such external controls

	AVOID ACCIDENTS:  Keep joy out of the reach of children. If Joy 
gets in your eyes, rinse thououghly with water. If swallowed, drink a 
glass of water to dilute.

	This is a true fact. Go look for yourself!  =|8<)=

Some people may think that leaders of the free press would perhaps accomplish 
more if their claims of constitutional right were less expansive.  I do not 
agree with this.  I say it is their duty to fight like tigers right down the

in the past, and it is the way they will be preserved in the future.

 ELECTRONIC EAVESDROPPING
A measure soon to be introduced on Capitol Hill would require that all
network providers, including the Internet and commercial on-line services,
build in the capability to record any person's e-mail and deliver it to
federal law-enforcement authorities. Government agents will need only to
show a person merits investigation, rather than obtain a court order as is
the case for telephone eavesdropping. (Business Week 3/14/94 p.55)

CYBERFLOP HORROR

Bologna, Italy

A record 35,000 people were attracted to this year's Bologna Erotica Festival.
Excitement was at a fever pitch following news that it would be the pioneering
showcase for the eroticism of the future -- cybersex. This is simulated sex,
using computer screens and electronic probes. Unfortunately, on the night, the
cybersex suits kept blowing up. One of the lady demonstrators, Milly, told the
audience not only that she felt nothing pleasant, but also that she feared the
machine could harm her. To stop the resulting exodus of the audience from the
room, Milly, in despair, tore off her cybersuit and adopted a good old-
fashioned tactic: she bared her breasts.

The Norwegian inventor of the electronic sex machine, Stahl Stenslie, said the
technology was still at an experimental stage -- and Milly had "moved around
too much." He claimed that his device would enable any two people in the world
to make love from a distance, provided they each had a Macintosh computer,
a modem and access to a telephone line. The cybersex machine was not a porn
accessory, but was intended to alleviate "profound social problems": for
instance, "to aid the disabled and those in prison."

In a toy department:    
"Five santa clauses, no waiting."

On a Maine shop:   
"Our motto is to give our customers the lowest possible
prices and workmanship."

On military bases:      
"Restricted to unauthorized personnel."

On a display of "You're my one and only" valentine cards:  
"Now available in multi-packs."

In a funeral parlor:    
"Ask about our layaway plan"

On an Indiana shopping mall marquee: 
Archery tournament.  Ears pierced.

In the window of a general store:
"Why go elsewhere and be cheated when you
can come right here?"

In a Maine restaurant:  
"Open 7 days a week and weekends"

In a Pennsylvania cemetery:  
"Persons are prohibited from picking flowers

In front of a New Hampshire car wash:  
"If you can't read this, it's time to

FOR THOSE WHO don't know how to view these, you put them approx.
a foot from your eyes, defocus on the X's until they split into
2 pairs, then keep going until the two in the middle meet, forming
what looks like 3 X's.  In that focus mode, look at the text.  You
should see various 3-D images pop up.  It works on-screen or
