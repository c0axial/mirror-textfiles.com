        "According to computer scientist Dr. Jacques Vallee,
	information is now doubling every 18 months.
        Nearly four billion years of evolution to get to the
        first tool.  Almost four _million_ years to arrive
        at the information density of Rome in 1 AD.  Only
        one-and-a-half thousand years for information to
        double and for the West to arrive at Leonardo, the
        high point of the Renaissance and the dawning of
        Protestantism.  Two-and-a-half _centuries for the next
        doubling, the rise of Industrialism, the birth of
        democracy - ... - only six years for the doubling of
        information between 1967 and 1973..."

        "Old folkes forced to eat dog food to live is

SPY quoted the monthly journal: 
_Medical Aspects of Human Sexuality_

	"A psychiatrist in Manhattan wrote in about a patient who
	was in the Army and wondered whether his sexual practices
	made him "different" from other people:  'I like girls, and I
	certainly enjoy sex with them, but...I like having sex with
	guys, too...[And] from what I understand, the other guys in my
	unit never had sex with anybody in their family.  I used
	to have sex with my mother, my father, and sisters and
	brothers...And I used to have sex with some of the [farm]
	animals.'
 
	When the psychiatrist asked whether the soldier could
	afford to get private professional help when he went back 
	to civilian life, the patient said, 'Doctor, that's a very
	personal question.' Ba-dump?"

IRAQ - CIVILIAN DEATHS
AN IMPORTANT NEW
 
According to the Italian monthly magazine "PANORAMA DIFESA" (May
1992) specialized in military news, Mrs Elisabeth Osborne, an
American state administration employee, has been dismissed 
because she has revealed unauthorized information about IRAQ
civilian deaths during the Gulf war. Mrs Elisabeth Osborne 
is an employee of the White House(U.S.A.).It seems that 39,612 
women and 32,195 children have been killed in that period.  
The total figure of civilian Deaths is 158,000.

a High Times interview with Terence McKenna.
Terence "has devoted most of his life exploring [the 
question,]...  Did hallucinogens play a crucial role
in human evolution?"
 
	HIGH   TIMES
	You're recognized by many as one of the great
	explorers of the 20th century.  You've trekked
	through the Amazonian jungles and soared through
	the uncharted regions of the brain, but perhaps your
	ultimate voyages lie in the future, when humanity
	has mastered space technology and time travel.
	What possibilities for travel in these two areas do you 
	foresee, and how do you think these new technologies
	will affect the future evolution of the human species?
 
 
	TERENCE MCKENNA
	I suppose most people believe space travel is right around
	the corner.  I certainly hope so.  I think we should all
	learn Russian in anticipation of it, because apparently the US
	government is incapable of sustaining a space program.
	The time travel question is more interesting.  Possibly
	the world is experiencing a compression of technological
	novelty that is going to lead to developments that are very
	much like what we would imagine time travel to be.
	We may be closing in on the ability to transmit information
	forward into the future, and to create an informational
	domain of communication between various points in time.
	How this will be done is difficult to imagine, but things like
	fractal mathematics, superconductiity, and
	nanotechnology offer new and novel approaches to the
	realization of these old dreams.  We shouldn't assume time 
	travel is impossible simply because it hasn't been done.
	There's plenty of latitude in the laws of quantum physics
	to allow for moving information through time in various
	ways.  Apparently you can move information through time,
	as long as you don't move it through time faster than light.

The black budget began its sharp ascent in the 1980s.  
As the Pentagon's budget doubled, the secret budget 
quadrupled to an estimated $36 billion a year.  It financed 
wonder weapons for World War III, billion-dollar nuclear 
bombers, and space-based brains to win six-month 
nuclear wars.  And now in the 1990s, though the prospect 
of nuclear Armageddon between the United States and 
the Soviet Union has evaporated, the secret projects 
grind on.  Billions are still being spent covertly to 
build nuclear bombers that can fly at eight times 
the speed of sound, underground nuclear-war 
command posts for the president and his peers, 
nuclear-powered engines for Star Wars rockets, 
and a hundred more highly classified military projects.

"Police in Papua, New Guinea, solved the mystery
of an arm found underneath a truck in Mt. Hagen
when a man contacted police 150 miles away in
Lae to report his missing.  The man, who had been
drinking, recalled driving towards Lae with his
right arm hanging out of the window when a truck
passed in the opposite direction.  Some time later,
he felt some pain and noticed his arm wasn't there.
Police searched for the missing limb but found
nothing until a truck driver noticed the arm beneath
his truck and reported it."
