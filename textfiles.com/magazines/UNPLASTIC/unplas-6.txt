Berkeley, CA: A University of California student who regularly comes to
school naked will have to dress for class under a new campus rule.
 
Andrew Martinez has been arrested for nudity three times, but courts
dismissed the charges because his behavior did not qualify as "lewd and
lascivious" under California law.
 
Martinez says he bares all to protest society's insistence that people wear
clothes.
 
Chancellor Chang-Lin Tien issued an edict on Wednesday banning public
nudity, sexually offensive conduct and indecent exposure at the university.
 
The new rule does not cary the force of law, but it will allow police to ask
people caught naked to leave campus, said Lt. Bill Foley of the campus
police. If they refuse to leave, they can be arrested for trespassing.
 
"The mission of the university is to teach," said spokesman Bob Sanders.
"Anything that is disruptive to that can't be tolerated."

The principle which regulates the existing social relations between the two
sexes--the legal subordination of one sex to the other--is wrong in itself, and
now one of the chief hindrances to human improvement; and it ought to be
replaced by a principle of perfect equality, admitting no power or privilege on
the one side, nor disability on the other.

The Queen is most anxious to enlist every one who can speak or write to
join in checking this mad, wicked folly of "Woman's Rights", with all its
attendant horrors, on which her poor feeble sex is bent, forgetting every
sense of womanly feeling and propriety. Lady-- ought to get a good
whipping. It is a subject which makes the Queen so furious that she cannot
contain herself. God created men and women different--then let them remain
each in their own position.

Kids Talk About LOVE
 by David Heller
(Reprinted without permission from "Cosmopolitan")

What Exactly Is Marriage??

        "When somebody's been dating for a while, the boy might
         propose to the girl. He says to her, 'I'll take you for
         a whole life, or at least until we have kids and get
         divorced, but you got to do one particular thing for me.'
         Then she says yes, but she's wondering what the thing is
         and whether it's naughty or not. She can't wait to find
         out."
                                                -Anita, 9

Concerning the Proper Age to Get Married.
 
        "Eighty-four! Because at that age, you don't have to
         work anymore, and you can spend all your time loving
         each other in your bedroom."
                                                -Carolyn, 8
 
        "Once I'm done with kindergarten, I'm going to find
         me a wife!"
                                                -Bert, 5

What Do Most People Do on a Date??
 
        "On the first date, they just tell each other lies, and
         that usually gets them interested enough to go for a
         second date."
                                                -Martin, 10
 
        "Many daters just eat pork chops and french fries and
         talk about love."
                                                -Craig, 9

When Is It Okay to Kiss Someone??
 
        "You should never kiss a girl unless you have enough
         bucks to buy her a big ring and her own VCR, 'cause
         she'll want to have videos of the wedding."
                                                -Allan, 10
 
        "Never kiss in front of other people. It's a big
         embarrassing thing if anybody sees you....If nobody
         sees you, I might be willing to try it with a handsome
         boy, but just for a few hours."
                                                -Kally, 9

The Great Debate: Is It Better to Be Single or Married??

        "It gives me a headache to think about that stuff. I'm
         just a kid. I don't need that kind of trouble."
                                                -Will, 7

	In August in Eugene, Ore., Rick Geoffroy opened Lollipops,
	a juice bar for people 18 and older, which will feature
	topless female dancers.  Geoffroy said Lollipops is aimed for
	men 18 to 20, who cannot attend topless bars that serve 
	liquor.  (Nor can under-21 dancers hustle alcoholic drinks
	from customers, but they can hustle juice drinks.)  Geoffroy
	told the Eugene Register-Guard that he believes the
	community "needs more activities for young people."

doing any good.  If it isn't, don't let them linger there.

                          ADVICE GIVEN TO BRIDES IN 1894
 
                INSTRUCTION AND ADVICE FOR THE YOUNG BRIDE
 
 On the Conduct and Procedure of the Intimate and Personal relationships of
the Marriage State for the Greater Spiritual Sanctity of this Blessed Sacrament
and the Glory of God by Ruth Smythers, beloved wife of the Reverend L.D.
Smythers of the Arcadian Methodist Church of the Eastern Regional Conference.
Published in the year of our Lord 1894, Spiritual Guidance Press, New York City.
 
        On the...wedding night... the bride must pay the piper, so to speak,
by facing for the first time the terrible experience of sex.
        One cardinal rule of marriage should never be forgotten:  GIVE LITTLE,
GIVE SELDOM, AND ABOVE ALL, GIVE GRUDGINGLY.  Otherwise... a
proper marriage could become an orgy of sexual lust.
        Sex is at best revolting and at worst rather painful... Feigned
illness, sleepiness, and headaches are among the wife's best friends in this
matter.  Arguments, nagging, scolding, and bickering also prove very
effective... A good wife should expect to have reduced sexual contacts to once
a week by the end of the first year of marriage.
        The wise bride will pay equal attention to limiting the kind and
degree of sexual contacts.  Most men are by nature rather perverted, and if
given half a chance, would engage in quite a variety of the most revolting
practices.  These practices include among others performing the normal act in
abnormal positions:  mouthing the female body:  and offering their own vile
bodies to be mouthed in turn.
        A wise bride will make it her goal never to allow her husband to see
her unclothed body, and never allow him to display his unclothed body to her.
Sex when it cannot be prevented, should be practiced only in total darkness.
        Once a bride has donned her gown and turned off all the lights, she
should lie quietly upon the bed and await her groom.  When he comes groping
into the room, she should make no sound to guide him in her direction, lest he
take this as a sign of encouragement.  She should let him grope in the dark.
There is always the hope that he will stumble and incur some slight injury
which she can use as an excuse to deny him sexual access.
        The wise wife relentlessly pursues her goal first to limit, later to
annihilate completely, her husband's desire for sexual expression.

 Bill Clinton and the Democratic Party forthrightly staked out their
 opposition.  The party's 1992 platform declared: "We oppose the Bush
 administration's efforts to bankrupt the public school system-the
 bedrock of democracy-through private school vouchers."  Critics dismiss
 the Democrats' position as special-interest politics, since the
 teachers' unions are a major constituency.  But in fact the Democrats
 are defending the long-term interests of most American families.
 Despite conservative propaganda to the contrary, 89 percent of the
 country's 48 million elementary and secondary students are in
 public schools.  And the overwhelming majority want to stay there.

        if enjoyed in moderation, they can be good-tasting and
        might even inhibit cavities."

"Martin Luther King Junior High School," notes the Post-Dispatch in a story
published in the early spring of 1989, "was evacuated Friday afternoon after
sewage flowed into the kitchen...The kitchen was closed and students were
sent home."  On Monday, the paper continues, "East St. Louis Senior High
School was awash in sewage for the second time this year."  The school had
to be shut because of "fumes and backed-up toilets."  Sewage flowed into
the basement, through the floor, then up into the kitchen and the student's
bathrooms.  The backup, we read, "occurred in the food preparation areas."

	The children regale me with a chilling story as we stand
beside the [polluted] marsh. Smokey says his sister was raped and
murdered and then dumped behind the school.  Other children add more
details: Smokey's sister was 11 years old. She was beaten with a brick
until she died.  The murder was commited by a man who knew her mother.

The narative begins when, without warning, Smokey says, "My sister
has got killed."

"She was my best friend," Serena says.

"They had beat her in the head and raped her," Smokey says.

"She was hollering out loud," says Little Sister.

I ask them when it happened.  Smokey says, "Last year."  Serena corrects
him and she says, "Last week."

"It scared me because I had to cry," says Little Sister.

"The police arrested one man but they didn't catch the other," Smokey says.

Serena says, "He was some kin to her."

But Smokey objects, "He weren't no kin to me.  He was my momma's friend."

"Her face was busted," Little Sister says.

Serena describes the sequence of events: "They told her go behind the school.
They'll give her a quarter if she do.  Then they knock her down and told her
not to tell what they had did."

I ask, "Why did they kill her?"

"They was scared that she would tell," Serena says.

"One is in jail," says Smokey.  "They can't find the other."

"Instead of raping little bitty children, they should find themselves a wife,"
says Little Sister.

"I hope," Serena says, "her spirit will come back and get that man."

"And KILL that man," says Little Sister.

"Give her another chance to live," Serena says.

"My teacher came to the funeral," says Smokey.

"When a little child dies, my momma say a star go straight to Heaven,"
says Serena.

"My grandma was murdered," Mickey says out of the blue.  "Somebody
shot two bullets in her head."

I ask him, "Is she really dead?"

"She dead all right," says Mickey.  "She was layin' there, just dead."

"I love my friends," Serena says.  "I don't care if they no kin to me.  I
care for them.  I hope his mother have another baby.  Name her for my friend
that's dead."

"I have a cat with three legs," Smokey says.

"Snakes hate rabbits," Mickey says, again for no apparent reason.

"Cats hate fishes," Little Sister says.

	"It's a lot of hate," says Smokey.
