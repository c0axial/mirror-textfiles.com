Good Morning Viewers!

As I write this,  1993 is off to a bang with bombs over Bagdad (again).

It is this  Deja Voodoo  that makes me think back to days gone by.  You

know,  I always seem to get nostalgic  and/or  nauseous at this time of

the year ... when I think back  to  where we have been and where we are

going  and  it  all  seems  to  congeal  into one geletinous mass.  And

speaking of geletinous masses, please enjoy this new issue of Unplastic

News.   We  originally  attempted to collect our usual quotes and amass

a type of retrospective of the past year.   We had hoped to put it into

some kind of perspective, but as it turns out we are more confused than

we were to begin with.   We promptly decided to pass our confusion onto

you, the viewer.   So,  here it is.   Issue #8.   Quotes, snippetts and

chunks of 1992 and beyond.   And somewhere in this,  somewhere deep, is

the pumping of a digital heart.   The pounding of a growing force which

has yet to be understood. Or maybe that is just the sound of the bombs,

because as I write this, 1993 is off to a bang with bombs over...

THE YEAR 1993 will produce extraordinary events such as
the discovery of a cure for AIDS
and a miraculous appearance by Jesus Christ...
 
In a recent conversation with a friend, Pope John Paul II admitted
to a divine meeting with the Virgin Mary.  It was during that sensational
encounter that the Pontiff learned of the impending appearance of Christ.
John Paul told his friend that the miracle will occur on August 1 and
will be witnessed by millions.

Best Long Term Prediction (Sort Of)

>From an article on Sen. Ted Kennedy's Presidential aspirations,
by Lloyd Shearer in PARADE's "Intelligence Report" column, 1978:

	Political prophets are making a long term prediction
	that Kennedy's running mate in 1984 will be Bill Clinton,
	a tall, handsom, 31-year-old former Rhodes scolar and
	Yalie who is currently Arkansas' attorney general, most
	probably its next governor and one of the most potentially
	charismatic politicians in the country.

MCDONALD'S STATUE GOES UP IN FLAMES
San Jose Mercury News - Wednesday June 19, 1991
 
PHOENIX - The kidnapping of a life-size Ronald
McDonald statue came to an unhappy end, with the
clown left burning in the desert.
 
The 300-pound statue, stolen Sunday from a
McDonald's in Mesa, was found in flames by a
sheriff's helicopter crew that night.
 
In a phone call claiming responsibility, a man
said the robbery was an attempt to get McDonald's
to offer better food for vegetarians.

"[The McDonald's Corp. shows] children in commercials that
hamburgers grow in hamburger patches and love to be eaten.
 
They don't tell children that hamburgers are ground up cows
that have their throats
slit
by a machete
or their brains bashed in by sledge hammers.
 
The original actor to play Ronald McDonald,
Jeff Juliano,
has evidently discovered the truth - he is now a vegetarian."

URANUS CONJUNCT NEPTUNE
 
Ponder on This...
A Message to the Bay Area House Family
 
A Rave New World
 
On Tuesday, February 2 at 12:12 a. m. PST, the planets Uranus and Neptune
will form what is known in astrology and astronomy as a conjunction. A
conjunction is when two or more heavenly bodies occupy the same visual
area of the sky.
 
When this happens the energies of both planets are intensified and work in
unison.   The Outer Planets, astrologically speaking, have a deeper,
longer lasting effects. Aspects (significant angles formed between two
heavenly bodies) involving the outer planets, bring about profound change
and events.
 The last conjunction of outer planets involved Uranus and Pluto and
occurred on June 30, 1966. It was the catalyst for the "Summer of Love" in
1967 and Woodstock in 1968.   Many of you know that what we are doing here
is special. It is not just about having a good time but something much
deeper, we are actually learning how to communicate and be with each other
in a very special way.

In October, biologists at China's Northwest University in Xian reported finding
a 77-pound slimeball floating on a river in Shaanxi province.  According to the
scientists, the slimeball, a pure white fungus, gained 22 pounds in the first
three days the scientists observed it, and has the ability to move across the
ground on its own.

Another Modern Diety (Coca-Cola) is experiencing change:

        Here is the fact of the week, maybe even the fact of the
	month.  According to probably reliable sources, the Coca-Cola people
	are experiencing severe marketing anxiety in China.

        The words "Coca-Cola" translate into Chinese as either
	(depending on the inflection) "wax-fattened mare" or "bite the wax
	tadpole".

        Bite the wax tadpole.
        There is a sort of rough justice, is there not?

The trouble with this fact, as lovely as it is, is that it's
hard to get a whole column out of it. I'd like to teach the world to
bite a wax tadpole.  Coke -- it's the real wax-fattened mare. Not bad,
but broad satiric vistas do not open up.

You think YOU have marketing difficulties?  Consider the case of Frank Purdue,
as reported  in the  New Haven Register  yesterday.     In an attempt to reach
the Hispanic market,  the  now-famous slogan   "It takes a tough man to make a
tender chicken"  was mistakenly  translated for  publication  as   "It takes a
sexually stimulated man to make a chicken affectionate".

"The term wyrd is the original form of today's weird, which means
strange or unexplainable.  Wyrd had essentially the same meaning
more than a thousand years ago in shamanic Europe, but in sacred
rather than mundane realms.  Wyrd was the unexplainable force -
the great mystery underlying all of existence - that was the       
cornerstone of Anglo-Saxon shamanic practices."

A 38 year-old man, unidentified in news reports, was hopitalized in Princeton,
W. Va., in October with gunshot wounds.  He had been drinking beer and reported
accidentally shooting himself three times -- as he attempted to clean each of
his three guns.  He said the first shot didn't hurt, the second "stung a
little," and the third "really hurt," prompting him to call an ambulance.

"Those like Stephan Hoeller who seek the hand of the Goddess in history
will invariably,  I suspect,  be disapointed.   That's just not how She
does things.

Where was She when they were burning us?  Why didn't She stop them? She
didn't intervene then because She was in the fire too, burning with us.
They  tried to kill  Her  by killing us, but you can't kill the Goddess
and you can't kill her people.   No, seek Her instead in the Cycle: She
moves, after all, from within.

"Antarctic Life Proves Hard Even for Those Who Love Their Work"
 
... How boring is life in the Antarctic?  People in one group wintering
at the South Pole in the 1960s watched the film "Cat Ballou" 87 times.
People in another, after tiring of the westerns, Disney features and
pornographic films on hand, spliced the movies together into their own
production and adopted a vocabulary based on their creation that was so
strange that relief crews arriving in the spring could barely understand
them.

Most Unusual Hotel: Hotel La Parra is located off the coast of Spain and
boasts a truly unique view, since the entire hotel is 49 feet underwater.
Getting there is half the fun, as there are no boats serving the hotel.
Guests must swim there, with their gear sealed in waterproof bags. La Parra
can accommodate up to twelve guests at a time and is said to be quite

We are unlikely to get much respite from the onslaught of personal,
national, and world upheaval that have characterized the early 1990s.
Take a deep breath, relax and get centered.  In all likelihood, even
bigger changes lie ahead.  The revolution has really just begun.  Almost
any careful reading of the news compels a singular conclusion - the
years leading to the Millennium are likely to be even more turbulent
and momentous than the years behind.  As the outer world continues to
shift wildly, the extraordinary personal transformations that people
are experiencing will also intensify, for both the good and the bad.

	Bizarre End-Of-The-Century Rituals Emerging
	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OWATONNA, Minn (AP) {found in a neswpaper from Buffalo, NY}
 
Roy Colette and his brother-in-law have been exchanging the same
pair of pants as a Christmas present for 11 years - and each time
the package gets harder to open.  This year the pants came wrapped
in a car mashed into a 3-foot cube.
 
The trousers are in the glove compartment of a 1974 Gremlin. Now
Collette's plotting his revenge--if he can get them out.
 
It all started when Collette received a pair of moleskin trousers
from his brother-in-law, Larry Kunkel of Bensenville, Ill. Kunkel's
mother had given her son the britches when he was a college student.
He wore them a few times, but they froze stiff in cold weather
and he didn't like them.  So he gave them to Collette.
 
Collette, who called the moleskins "miserable", wore them three
times, then wrapped them up and gave them back to Kunkel for
Christmas the next year.
 
The friendly exchange continued routinely until Collette twisted
the pants tightly, stuffed them into a 3-foot-long, 1-inch wide
tube and gave them back to Kunkel.
 
The next Christmas, Kunkel compressed the pants into a 7-inch
square, wrapped them with wire and gave the "bale" to Collette.
 
Not to be outdone, the next year Collette put the pants into a
2-foot-square crate filled with stones, nailed it shut, banded it
with steel and gave the trusty trousers back to Kunkel.
 
The brothers agreed to end the caper if the trousers were damaged.
But they were as careful as they were clever.
 
Kunkel had the pants mounted inside an insulated window that had a
20-year guarantee and shipped them off to Collette.
 
Collette broke the glass, recovered the trousers, stuffed them into
a 5-inch coffee can and soldered it shut.  The can was put in a
5-gallon container filled with concrete and reinforcing rods and
given to Kunkel the following Christmas.
 
Two years ago, Kunkel installed the pants in a 225-pound homemade
steel ashtray made from 8-inch steel casings and etched Collette's
name on the side.  Collette had trouble retrieving the treasured
trousers, but succeeded without burning them with a cutting torch.
 
Last Christmas, Collette found a 600-pound safe and hauled it to
Viracon Inc. in Owatonna, where the shipping department decorated
it with red and green stripes, put the pants inside and welded the
safe shut. The safe was then shipped to Kunkel, who is the plant
manager for Viracon's outlet in Bensenville.
 
Last week, the pants were trucked to Owatonna, 55 miles south of
Minneapolis, in a drab green, 3-foot cube that once was a car with
95,000 miles on it. A note attached to the 2,000-pound scrunched car
advised Collette that the pants were inside the glove compartment.
 
"This will take some planning," Collette said.  "I will definitely
get them out. I'm confident."  But he's waiting until January to
think about how to recover the bothersome britches.
 
"Wait until next year," he warned.  "I'm on the offensive again."

Subject: Santa Manual
 
Subject: First Chirch of Santaism
Organization: Founder, First Chirch of Santaism
 
[From the "Santa Manual" distributed by Western Temporary Services,
providers of 3000 Santas to department stores and malls nationwide.]
 
Santa Do's:
 
    - Santa should watch parents for signals.  Santa should never promise
    anything.
 
    - Santa should always speak of himself as "Santa" or "Santa Claus";
    Santa should never say "I".
 
    - Santa should use the "Santa lift" to pick up children (Santa extends
    leg; the child stands between Santa's knees and sits on the extended
    leg; Santa pulls leg back to sitting position).  This avoids quick
    movements and saves Santa's back.
 
    - Santa should use the term "folks" when referring to family, because
    of all the non-traditional families that exist.
 
 
Santa Don'ts:
 
    - Santa should omit the loud, booming "Ho ho ho's", because they often
    frighten small children.
 
    - Santa should avoid short, jerky, nervous movements.
 
    - Santa should never show his mood.  Santa must forget things that
    upset him, because children will pick up on his mood.
 
    - Santa should never be out of character when he is in costume.
 
    - Santa should avoid references to the religious aspects of Christmas.
    Religion is a personal matter; don't run the risk of offending parents
    or confusing children.  Stick to the universal aspects of Christmas.
 
 
Sometimes children will ask Santa difficult questions.  Santa needs to
be prepared to answer them in ways that won't put the child's folks in
a difficult situation or cause any damage to Santa's image.  The
following are some of the questions that Santa might be asked, followed
by acceptable.
 
    Question: Santa, I just saw you at another store.
 
    Answer: That was one of my Helpers.  You know, Santa needs Helpers.
 
    [Real Answer: That's right, I can travel faster than light and move back
    and forth through Time.]
 
 
    Question: Why didn't you bring me what I asked you for last year?
 
    Answer: I was at the North Pole last year, and it must have been one of
    my Helpers who saw you.  I'll try to get the matter straightened out
    this year.
 
    [Real Answer: Because you were bad.]
 
 
    Question: Santa, can you bring me a baby brother?
 
    Answer: OK, my fine young lady, you want a baby brother.  Well, that's
    clear out of my department.  I bring gifts.  You'll have to talk to
    your folks about a baby brother.
 
    [Real Answer: Come back and see me in a few years and I'll give you your
    own baby.]
 
 
    Question: I want a horse for Christmas.
 
    Answer: You like horses, don't you?  Is there anything else you would
    like for Christmas?
 
    [Real Answer: Tell you what, put on these spurs and you can ride me like
    a horse any time you want to.]
 
 
It is absolutely necessary that Santa be neat and clean in appearance.
For this reason, we ask you, as responsible adults, to bathe every day,
to use a good deodorant and to use mouthwash.  Smoking is not
permitted, as children will smell smoke on your breath.  Also, the
beard is flammable.

Implicit  in the process  of modeling is the separation of the subject
from the object, of the  map from the territory.   Problems arise when
the model comes to be regarded as more real than the modeled, and this
is more likely to happen when, as in our current relationship with the

        A Brain-Computer interface is a staple of science fiction
writing.  In it's earliest incarnations no mechanism was thought
necessary, as the technology seemed so far fetched that no explanation
was likely.  As more became known about the brain however, the
possibility has become more real and the science fiction more
technically sophisticated.  Recently, the cyberpunk movement has
adopted the idea of "jacking in", sliding "biosoft" chips
into slots implanted in the skull (Gibson, W. 1984).  Although such
biosofts are still science fiction, there have been several recent
steps toward interfacing the brain and computers.  Chief among these
are techniques for stimulating and recording from areas of the brain
with permanently implanted electrodes and using conscious control of
EEG to control computers.  Some preliminary work is being done on
synapsing neurons on silicon transformers and on growing neurons into
neural networks on top of computer chips.

installation. This led to an enormous explosion and the closure of the

In April, a Franciscan friar, the Rev. Bede Frrara, handed out coupons
in Somerville, Mass., offering his parishioners "50 percent off" of the
penance for whatever sins they confess.
  He said he thought his parishioners needed a boost because of economic
woes in the area and so offered them the opportunity to atone for a sin
by, for example, doing only 15 Hail Marys instead of 30.

On December 7, 1906, one Christopher Timms slipped on Mount
Elie de Beaumont, a 10,200-foot peak in New Zealand.  He skidded,
bounced, plummeted 7,500 feet down the ice face into a crevasse.
His climbing companion was killed, but Timms lived.  With bruises,
a concussion and injuries to one hand.  Longest fall ever survived
by a mountain climber, according to the record books.

After police pulled over Kevin Temple, 35, in a routine traffic stop in
Bronson, Fla., in October, a police dog sniffing the trunk became agitated.
In the trunk and back seat, officers found the following live animals:
48 rattlesnakes, a Gila monster, 45 non-poisonous snakes, 67 scorpions,
several tarantulas and small lizards, and a parrot.  Temple said they were
just pets.

In 1982 while employed at a audio/video/record store in New York City
I discovered that by staring at a live TV show while in a meditative
state that I could cause the TV camera lens at the TV studio to glow.
I worked facing a bank of sets all day long and by experimenting with
some Zen meditation techniques I discovered that the people on TV were
reacting to the fluctuations in my mental state.  The effect looks like
a bright spot of light in the camera lens directed at the person.
 
Since 1983 I've been using the effect to wreak havoc in the incipient
mind of the media/state.  I have learned to control the effect so that
I can induce more eye blinking, more stammering, etc. by changing the
brightness and location of the spot of light which I cause to appear in
the broadcasting TV camera.
 
In 1991 I decided to create an experiment which would be verifiable to
the public at large, so that I might prove the existence of the phenomenon
to the skeptical community.  So, I came up with the Thursday test.  Every
Thursday I illuminate the cameras of the CBS Evening News.  Watchers of
the show can do various things to prove the veracity of my claims.  They
can count the number of times Dan Rather blinks on Thursday as compared
with Friday or Wednesday.  They can measure the reflected luminosity of
the spot of light on Dan's eyeballs or they can count the number of
mis-speaks.
 
I've been zapping all presidential TV appearances since late 1983.  If
you watch the first 1984 Reagan debate you will notice my efforts.  I've
zapped all of the presidential and vice-presidential debates this year.
 
Millions of people know about this phenomenon and harbor knowledge of it
through a "cult of secrecy."  There is no real conspiracy in the public,
it is just that people do not tell others of this story unless provoked.
There have been quite a few pop songs written in homage; these usually use
innuendo to refer to the phenomenon.
 
My intent on Internet is to inform the public of this process.  My intent
is infinite and immaculate in its beautifully chaotic intentions.  Wreaking
havoc with light.  Photonic agents of bliss infiltrating the minds of
commerce and conspiracy.

Comments on a Tim Leary prediction presentation:

        "You have to go out of your mind to use your mind," he exclaims at
one point, and a number of us cheer hopefully, wondering just how much
"experimenting" he allows himself these days.  He sees virtual reality as a
key breakthrough in consciousness expansion and human communication, and he
predicts than within two or three years, no one will simply give lectures,
which appeal only to the so-called "left brain;" they will give full-blown
multi-media presentations that will appeal to both the logical and the
creative functions of the brain. *Everyone* will do this, he says; it will
be *the* way to give seminars. Leary's penchant for prediction has always
fascinated me.  I'm reminded of one of his earlier predictions, that
reliable life extension techniques would be available during his lifetime.
These predictions haven't got much time to be fulfilled.

[In the 60's] there was madness in any direction, at any hour ...  You
could strike sparks anywhere.  There was a fantastic universal sense
that whatever we were doing was `right', that we were winning ...
 
And that, I think, was the handle -- the sense of inevitable victory
over the forces of Old and Evil.  Not in any mean or military sense; we
didn't need that.  Our energy would simply `prevail'.  There was no
point in fighting -- on our side or theirs.  We had all the momentum;
we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave ....

Deep Thoughts
by
Jack Handey

When I was a kid my favorite relative was Uncle Caveman.  After school we'd
all go play in his cave, and every once in a while he would eat one of us.
It wasn't until later that I found out that Uncle Caveman was a bear.


If you go parachuting, and your parachute doesn't open, and your friends are
all watching you fall, I think a funny gag would be to pretend you were
swimming.


Whenever I see an old lady slip and fall on a wet sidewalk, my first instinct
is to laugh.  But then I think, what if I was an ant, and she fell on me.
Then it wouldn't seem quite so funny.


If you're a young Mafia gangster out on your first date, I bet it's real
embarrassing if someone tries to kill you.


I wish a robot would get elected president.  That way, when he came to town,
we could all take a shot at him and not feel too bad.


One thing kids like is to be tricked.  For instance, I was going to take my
little nephew to DisneyLand, but instead I drove him to an old burned-out
warehouse.  "Oh, no," I said, "DisneyLand burned down." He cried and cried,
but I think that deep down he  thought it was a pretty good joke.  I started
to drive over to the real DisneyLand, but it was getting pretty late.


If a kid asks where rain comes from, I think a cute thing to tell him is
"God is crying." And if he asks why God is crying, another cute thing to
tell him is "Probably because of something you did."


He was a cowboy, mister, and he loved the land.  He loved it so much he made
a woman out of dirt and married her.  But when he kissed her, she
disintegrated.  Later, at the funeral, when the preacher said, "Dust to dust,"
some people laughed, and the cowboy shot them.  At his hanging, he told the
others, "I'll be waiting for you in heaven--with a gun."


As I bit into the nectarine, it had a crisp juiciness about it that was very
pleasurable - until I realized it wasn't a nectarine at all, but A HUMAN HEAD!!


To me, boxing is like a ballet, except there's no music, no choreography, and
the dancers hit each other.


Dad always thought laughter was the best medicine, which I guess is why
several of us died of tuberculosis.

   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Religious cultists convinced that flat tires
were the key to salvation deflated tires on scores of buses and cars Monday,
paralyzing traffic throughout the city. Police arrested 32 people.
   Terrified motorists abandoned their vehicles and fled for cover as armed
police chased the cultists, who swarmed through the stalled traffic deflating
more tires. Other cultists flagged down buses and then let the air out before
drivers could stop them.
   The mass deflating, which appeared to have been well planned, began during
the evening rush hour and created massive traffic jams. Hours later, traffic
was still at a standstill on major thoroughfares.
   It was unclear what purpose the cultists thought was served by the bizarre
strategy. When pressed for an explanation, they said only that cult leader
Alelio Bernaldez Pen told them it was God's will.
   "This is God's order to let out air," said Honora Dimagila, 44, who was
arrested Monday. "Air is from God. This is the solution to the crisis in our
country."

That Damn Hundredth Monkey Story Again:
 
"There were these Japanese scientists in the '50s who left potatoes every
day for these wild monkeys on Koshima Island and then watched what
they did.
 
One of these monkeys learned to wash the potatoes and began teaching
this to the others.  Then, when a certain number had learned, maybe a
hundred - scientists call this a 'critical mass' - an amazing thing happened.
Suddenly, all the monkeys knew how to wash potatoes, even monkeys on
other islands hundreds of miles away!  Scientists consider this to be
conclusive proof of a telepathic 'group mind'."

Ron Amundson on the whole Hundredth Monkey phenomenon:
 
I would express Blair's thought somewhat differently:
"Convince enough people of a lie, and it becomes truth."
I suggest that someone who accepts this view of truth
is not to be trusted as a source of knowledge.  He may, of course,
be a marvelous source of fantasy, rumor, and pseudoscientific best-sellers.

This was in Ann Landers in today's paper.  I thought it was classic:

     Dear Ann--

     On April 30 of this year, the LA riots were in full swing.
     I was with a couple of friends and we got carried away with
     all the excitement. One guy suggested that we join the rest
     of the crowd and loot a Korean dry cleaners.

     The scene was incredible. There were about 20 people grabbing
     as much stuff as they could before the store was set on fire.
     That's when I saw this great leather coat hanging not two yards
     from me. I went to grab it and at the very same moment, ``Wanda''
     reached for it, too.

     She was beautiful, and she really wanted that coat, so I made
     her a deal. She could have it if she would let me take her to
     dinner.

     We hit it off right away and I knew that night we were perfect
     for each other. We plan to be married next April.

     The problem is this: Many out-of-town family members will want
     to know how we met. Should we tell them the truth? Should we lie?
     We aren't convicted criminals. We both work and have no police
     records.


Reply to "Pair steal more than each other's hearts":
 
What a charming way to meet people!  Here I've been suggesting church
and temple affairs, volunteer groups and night school classes.  You say
you have no criminal record?  Too bad.  You SHOULD, because what you
did was clearly criminal.  Do you have any idea how hard those Koreans
worked to open their shops?  Overnight, everything they had was gone,
thanks to animals like you.  As for your question, sorry, pal, I'm
fresh out of cover stories.

I was making pesto in a blender -- one of the models where the jar
screws into a metal base which has the blades and bearings built into
it, and this base then sits on top of the drive unit.
 
Well, the blender was screaming away on high speed when I suddenly
noticed that the jar was unscrewing itself from the base.  I dashed
across the kitchen and reached for it, just as the whole thing let go.
The jar toppled off before I could grab it, pesto exploded everywhere,
and the base flew straight up off the drive unit, blades still spinning,
right smack into the palm of my outstretched hand.
 
So there I was standing in the kitchen with my hand bleeding copiously
and a heavy horizontal band of pesto all around the walls of the kitchen
and across the front of my shirt.  I was all alone in my house way out
in the mountain boonies, but I knew I needed stitches (at least 25
years later, I still have the scar).
I wrapped my hand up in a towel and I drove 15 miles of dark mountain
roads to the emergency room.
 
When I walked into the ER, the almost-a-doctor on duty sized me up, and
as he unwrapped the bloody towel from my hand he said "My gawd, you
smell REALLY DELICIOUS!"

of 64.
 
Queen Elizabeth II dubbed 1992 as an "annus horribilis."
 
Time magazine in turn dubbed 1992 as "annus terrificus."

In 1992, scientists announced that the overpopulation is on the rise
in a way much worse than they had earlier surmised. The population of the
planet is expected to double to 10 billion by 2050.

Two baby buffalo are on the loose in the suburbs south of Baltimore. The

And just to put a capper on to 1992, Todd Bridges from "Different Strokes"
was arrested for posession of speed and a 9mm pistol.

        NEW YORK (UPI) -- The American Civil Liberties Union Wednesday named a
	number of government officials and private individuals, including Oliver
	North and Washington State Gov. Booth Gardner, as ``1992 Arts Censors of
	the Year.''

        The watchdog organization cited those chosen as having ``shown
	exceptional disregard for the First Amendment values of freedom of
	speech.''

        ``All of the people and groups that we've named today, and many
	others like them, are trying to impose their ideological, moral and
	religious standards on a very diverse population,'' said Marjorie Heins,
	director of the ACLU's Arts Censorship Project.

        She noted that several of those named as arts censors ``are public
	officials who have used the weight and authority of their offices to
	wage campaigns against musicians, painters, sculptors and writers.''

        The others, she said, ``are private individuals and pressure groups
	who have advocated censorship in an effort to impose their morality and
	cultural tastes on the rest of society.''

        Those listed were:
	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        -- Anne-Imelda Radice, acting chairwoman of the National Endowment for
the Arts, ``who stated in testimony before Congress that she would veto
any grants for sexually explicit art or other projects that deal with
'difficult subject matter.'''

        -- The Duval County, Fla., public school district, ``which has
censored more than 60 books over the years, and which, this past year,
purged the county's school libraries of titles by Stephen King and
African-American poet Nikki Giovani, not to mention the classic fairy
tale 'Snow White' banned because of 'graphic violence.'''

        -- Omaha, Neb., City Councilman Steve Exon, and members of Omaha for
Decency, a private organization, ``who together organized a private
sting operation resulting in prosecutions against four local record
stores for selling 2 Live Crew's 'Sports Weekend' album to teenagers.''

        -- The Maryland State Legislature's Frederick County delegation, which
reversed its plans to seek $500,000 in state funding for a local arts
center ``after the museum displayed a satiric, anti-Persian Gulf War
painting.''

        -- The Washington State Legislature and Gov. Booth Gardner, who passed
a law imposing a mandatory labeling sytem, with criminal penalties, for
musical recordings deemed ``erotic'' by a state court.

        -- Former Marine colonel Oliver North and Florida attorney Jack
Thompson, ``who led a campaign of harassment against musicians and
record companies over Ice-T's song 'Cop Killer,' and other music with
messages they dislike.''

        -- Legal scholar Catharine MacKinnon and writer Andrea Dworkin, ``for
drafting and advocating legislation that would allow lawsuits to ban
sexually oriented entertainment, and to allow victims of sexual crimes
to collect damages from the producers and distributors of such
entertainment.''

        -- The Rev. Donald Wildmon, head of the American Family Association,
``for a lifetime of disservice to the fundamental values of the Bill of
Rights in his pursuit of one overarching goal: the restructuring of
American law to reflect his own moral code.''
