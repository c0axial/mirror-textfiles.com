    Well we've talked about trashing, social enginering, and other stuff,
    but what if none of it works?   Well .....


    Call up the company...

    Them>  Yes, it is. 
     You>  Yeah, umm, look.  I'm doing a school project about [what the 
           company sells or the service it provides].
    Them>  Oh well, umm, I'll put you through to our PR people.
     You>  Thanks.

    Them>  [Company Name], Public Relations.  How can I help? 
     You>  Ahh, yes, hi.  I'm doing a school project and was wondering if 
           it's possible to have a look around your company. 
    Them>  Well, we are happy to show you around, but you need a group of

 Once you're in the company building, have a look around.  Study their en-
 vironment and the people.  If there's a computer around, stare at it and you
 will soon get a demonstration from one of the people standing around. 
 Try to get there password or at least the way their user names are defined 
 on the system.  Note down what type of computer and what type of operating
 system they are using.

  PRIMAL SCREAM: an interesting way to find prime numbers.


  There are many numbers in the world.  Some of them are special; some of
them are hard to find.  One such class of numbers are known as "prime."

  A prime number has the quality of being indivisible by any other number
but for itself, and one.  Thus 5 is an example of a prime number; 15 is not,
because it is divisible by both 5 and 3.  15 is instead an example of a
"composite" number, one that can be expressed as the product of prime
factors.  All numbers not prime are composite.  On average, there are very
many more composite numbers than there are prime.

  Prime numbers are increasingly hard to find as they themselves increase.
There are 25 primes under 100; if you were to choose any number under 100,
there'd be a 1 in 4 chance that the number you choose would be prime.  But
once in the thousands of millions, the likelihood of picking a prime
declines to less than 1 in 20.

  If they are so hard to find, why bother finding them?  For one thing, they
have very broad applications in computer science, and more generally,
information science.  In the case of computer science, prime numbers can be
used in the construction of hash-functions; ways of indexing data so that
they may be stored and retrieved with rapidity.  They also have everyday 
applications in error-checking - cheque and credit card numbers, bar codes -
wherever there is scope for data-entry error.  Small prime numbers are
useful for quickly computing functions that will catch such errors.

  Perhaps the most arresting applications of prime number theory are in
cryptography.  Cryptography, by nature, requires functions that are
relatively easy to compute in one direction given a key, but are far too
hard to reverse without the key, even if we should have available limitless
computing resources.  Presently, it is difficult to reduce a large number
into its prime factors - so, several much relied-upon modern cryptosystems
use this to their advantage.  Some public-key systems are of the latter.
  
  I became seriously interested in cryptography in mid-1990, when I read an
article from the then-current Encyclopedia Brittainica, describing in vague
conceptual terms the class of German Second World War cipher machines known
as Enigma.  Much of the conclusions drawn of cryptanalysis of this group of
machines remains classified by the British government, at least, directly;
puzzling, considering the age of the material - until you consider that
present-day cryptography has its roots in that broken ground.

  In late-1990, I implemented variously Enigma machines in software, and set
about determining their weaknesses.  Briefly, I felt I was able to
demonstrate that, given certain assumptions about the way the machines were
wired - attributable to laziness of the part of German cipher clerks - large
amounts of plain text were recoverable from the cipher text, even if the key
was not nearly correct.  I was able to write a simple, heuristic
"Enigma-breaker" that given enough time was able to recover enough key 
fragments to completely recover the entire cipher text.  I was to later 
learn that this function was executed by "bombes," electromechanical
symbol-manipulators, built from telephone switching equipment and operated
during the War by the Allies.

  It was after the War that the computational arms-race had begun; the
Allies having a head start by designing cryptosystems that relied upon for
their security prime number theory.  The American M-209 cipher machine was
an operational prototype of the type of technology we were to see emerge.
From then until now, cryptographic research has tended toward double-edged
research; in one direction, to find functions that are difficult to reverse,
and in the other, to find faster ways of reversing or just computing
existing functions.

  A fast way of finding prime numbers would go quite a way toward breaking
some modern cryptosystems.  The editor of this magazine remarked such to me;
I was helpless to resist - I was hooked.  Within a few days I was working on
finding my own method to improve upon the ones I had discovered in the
computer science and mathematics text I had access to.

  The simplest methods I found for finding primes consisted mainly of
division; numbers under test were variously divided, the more efficient
methods involving less division, since division is computationally
expensive.  I was most dissatisfied with these methods for two reasons; one,
their reliance upon such time-consuming things as division, and two, their
lack of an ability to use the considerable storage resources of the modern
computer.

  I was more greatly attracted to sieving methods, particularly the simple
Sieve of Erastothenes.  Though fast, particularly the latter method required
inordinate storage, precluding sieves for any great distance.

  The method I eventually came up with is a dynamic-extension of the
canonical Sieve of Erastothenes - Primal Scream.  It involves no arithmetic
but for addition, and simple addition at that; having a machine with a
coprocessor makes very little difference to the speed of the program.  Also,
Primal Scream makes the assumption that most computers worth playing with
today have quite a few hundred kilobytes of storage, preferably memory,
available - so why shouldn't it be used to speed our purpose?

  Specifically, Primal Scream's memory requirements are in a direct
relationship with the number of primes under the square root of the highest
number to be considered.  For instance, when sieving to one million, the
number of nodes allocated in the algorithm's search tree is (the number
of primes under the square root of one million, which is one thousand), just
168.  This relative conservation improves with a square-root relationship as
the upper limit increases, making long sieves with even quite modest
computers practical.

  Memory is dynamically-allocated as needed, and is recycled as much as
possible - there are no significant algorithmic restrictions that would
preclude its implementation on any common operating system.  It makes no
assumptions about the speed that memory can be allocated, nor does it place
any reliance on the speed that difficult calculations may be made; these two
aspects making the only real limit the speed of the processor.

  As an example, the production version that I have written (which collects
quite a few interesting statistics in the course of its run), can exhaust a
32-bit unsigned integer of candidates within a day on a 486DX-40 running
Linux.  That is, all the primes almost up to 4500 million.  By way of 
example, here is an extract from the log file of one of the later versions:

Fri Dec  2 16:49:57 1994 DONE 98.0 completed
Fri Dec  2 16:49:57 1994 HIGH highest prime so far 4209067897
Fri Dec  2 16:49:57 1994 LAST 3877719 found since last report
Fri Dec  2 16:49:57 1994 HITS 4.514 of those since last report prime
Fri Dec  2 16:49:57 1994 TOTL 199405845 found so far
Fri Dec  2 16:49:57 1994 AGGR 4.738 of so far prime
Fri Dec  2 16:49:57 1994 ITIM 1662.8 seconds since last report
Fri Dec  2 16:49:57 1994 IPPS 2332.0 primes per second since last report
Fri Dec  2 16:49:57 1994 TTIM 80449.3 seconds so far
Fri Dec  2 16:49:57 1994 TPPS 2478.7 primes per second so far
Fri Dec  2 16:49:57 1994 DUMP dumping sieve at 4209067905
Fri Dec  2 16:49:58 1994 FLAT 99.7 sieve structure optimality

  Note particularly the "primes per second value;" this does not decline
much in the course of most long sieves - meaning that the number of numbers
considered per second does not decrease significantly either.  Primal
Scream's runtime is thus quite stable and has a very strong linear component.

  Primal Scream may not be the fastest, nor the best, but I believe the
implementation to be unique and my approach to be interesting.  I would be
happy to talk with anyone else interested in the program or in its obvious
applications - I will consider distributing it to anyone who should ask, and
naturally any comments are welcome, though of course the algorithm itself is
copyrighted by me - unless it has as I suspect it has been innumerably
reinvented.

Okay, I noticed that we received a few complaints about the carding and
stuff so I thought I'd go about writing a more detailed article for those 
of whom aren't yet experienced enough as of late.

Firstly, I'd like to say - this is for INFORMATIONAL purposes ONLY and I,
nor any part of Southern Lights inc. takes ANY responsibility for anything
which may happen in conjunction with you using this information for anything 
other than what it was designed for.

For starters - checking back on the past couple of issues - we didn't quite
explain what to do once you had possession of the cards you may have acquired,
ie. we never explained in detail what you COULD do.  

... hopefully, this may be of interest to you.



                               ******


Okay, you've gone trashing, used your social-engineering skills or found
a card just sitting somewhere (I'd feel sorry for the poor (hehehe, if you're
reading this, the person will definitely become poor in no time if I explain
it right - I'm not saying that you SHOULD use the card... It's all up to 
you! =) ) bugger who the card belongs to .. ;) )

Step One:     Find a card-phone and say to the operator that you'd like to
             place a credit card call ; to make sure the card works.

Step Two:     Give the operator the number of the local Pizza Hut rest-
             aurant - I, personally, prefer Pizza Hut as there aren't too
             many pizza parlors out in the Wellington region which accept 
             credit cards over the phone without seeing the piece of plastic
             when the pizzas arrive (well, sometimes they'll ask to see the 
             card, but the pizza deliverers get paid for how long it takes 
             for the consumer to receive the pizza/s so you probably wont
             need to worry about it).  

Step Three:   After quoting the Pizza Hut number, the operator will ask for 
             the card number and expiry date.  Tell him/her the card type 
             (if the card starts with: 3 - American Express (Amex), 4 - Visa, 
             5 - MasterCard and 6 - Discover.)

             [NB: This can be done with any number, whatsoever, not only just
             Pizza Hut, so take y'pick.]

Step Four:    Okay, you're listening to the ringing tone as your call to 
             Pizza Hut is being placed.. <CLICK> One of the Pizza Hut 
             employees picks up the telephone.


Conversation w/ employee should go SOMETHING like this:

      THEM:  Hi, Pizza Hut.
       YOU:  Hi, I was wondering whether you do Pizza Deliveries.
             [Knowing full well they do - you gotta appear to be at least
             a little ignorant (not too ignorant tho', mind you)..]
      THEM:  Where are you wanting the pizzas to be delivered to?
       YOU:  Karori thanks. [or wherever you're planning on picking 'em up
             from.]
      THEM:  Yup, we deliver there - just gotta check because we can't 
             deliver to some places.
       YOU:  Yeah, I know what ya mean.
      THEM:  Uh, how are you paying for your order?
       YOU:  Credit card okay?
      THEM:  Yup, that's fine.  What type of credit card?
       YOU:  Visa. (or Mastercard, American Express.. etc)
      THEM:  Yup, we take Visas.  What's your card number and expiration
             date?
       YOU:  4732-7492-7122-9237. Expiration date, 09/95. [That's not a 
             valid number (unless I'm extremely lucky, and that's definatly
             one thing I'm not...) so you'll have to find one y'self.]
      THEM:  Now, what's the name of the cardholder?
       YOU:  [Some fake name which doesn't sound too unbelievable - Joe 
             Bloggs isn't ranked amongst the best ones to use.]
      THEM:  Okay, thanks.  What would you like to order?
       YOU:  [Make your order - Don't forget to be polite and friendly.. =)
             Oh, and don't OVERSPEND!  Be realistic.]
      THEM:  Now, what address would you like the pizzas to be sent to?
       YOU:  [Give them some address which isn't too far away - walkwise -
             but not too close or, if someone knows what you do, you may be
             picked out (or up, depending on the circumstances. ;) ).
             Also, if possible, make it somewhere with a long drive so you
             can just wait at the bottom of the drive so not to "cause the
             pizza deliverer any problems".]
      THEM:  Okay, is there any time you'd prefer us dropping it in, other-
             wise we'll be there in about 30 minutes.
       YOU:  [If you live a distance from your drop site, or if your tele-
             phone is a distance from the drop site (depending on where you
             are at the time) then it's advisable to allow yourself time to 
             get there, but once you've got the pizzas, get the hell outta 
             there!]
      THEM:  Okay, we'll be right there.
       YOU:  Thanks. [You gotta be polite! ;)]

Step Five:    Now that you've made the call, you're about halfway there -
             all ya gotta do now is the hardest part of it all.....
             Waiting for the pizzas to arrive to the drop site.  Now, it's
             not a good idea to hover around the drop site looking suspicious
             as it would be likely that the neighbors will get a bit anxious
             as to what you're actually doing there - especially if the house
             is owned by an elderly couple and there are a bunch of people
             who aren't usually there hangin' about.

Step Six:     Okay, you see the pizza delivery car drive up - hopefully you
             have managed to get that far.  The likelyhood of a cops car
             comin' around to check up on it is pretty dim, although, you
             shouldn't always think that it's never going to happen, or maybe
             it just might.  The pizza deliverer jumps out and asks you if 
             you're, say, Michael Jones (The name you gave the person who
             answered your call earlier).  At this point, it's advisable, if
             you're the one who was planning on signing for it, you say some-
             thing along the lines of a "yes".  The person delivering the
             pizzas should hand you a slip of paper and ask you to sign your
             name next to the X.  You sign the paper and take off with the 
             pizzas and make your way up this long drive - maybe stay and 
             chat for a bit if you really want to, just don't make yourself
             look suspicious.  Get the hell out of there as soon as the pizza 
             delivery car is out of sight. 

Step Seven:   Eat pizza.  (Not too hard, is it?) ... oh, and destroy the
             docket - y'never know when/if the copz come snooping.. =)



Any queries/questions - you know where to send it... =)

                             Gun Control

            By "Susej, son of Lucifer", with bits by "Thorium".

A member of SLi has had a few problems with the law lately (who hasn't?
hehe) but this is a little different.  It makes for a good story, so why
don't ya take a read...

It all started during Calculus a long time ago...  About 6 months anyway.
Well, there's this real lame shit who is in the same class as this SLi
member, and so the SLi member and his mates hassled the crap out of this
lamer (whose sexuality is questionable).  Well, one time hassles as usual,
the transcript follows.  We shall call the lamer "Herbert" and the member
"Thorium"...

< General Hassles >

Herbert:  "Ya wanna step outside for five minutes then?"
          (trying to be tough)

Thorium:  "What, so you can shove your dick up my arse?"

Herbert:  "No, so I can shove my fist up your arse!"
          (again trying to be tough)

Thorium, to whole class:  "Herbert just said he wants to shove his fist up
                           my arse!!!  Faggot Alert!"

< Herbert then looks real stupid and lame, whole class laughs at him etc.
  Teacher walks back in, then leaves again 5 mins later. >

< General Hassles >

Herbert:  "One more comment about me being a homo and I'll fucking deal to
           you!"   (still trying to be tough)

Thorium:  "Whatever, faggot."

Herbert:  "O.k. then, in the car park after school"

< More General Hassles, class ends without much more of interest >

< In the carpark >

Thorium:  "Hey, Faggot!  You forgetting something?"

Herbert:  "Oh, I'd like to go somewhere more private..." (lamely looking to
           get out of it)

< Herbert gets into his car and drives off >

Now Thorium and his friend have a most excellent idea!  Thorium's brother
has a totally real looking _FAKE_ UZI replica, which they decide to go home
and get, then wait outside Herb's place.  They wait in the car for about
five minutes then Herbert arrives, with one of his lameshit friends in his
car, and 2 (fairly fat) girls (about 2 years younger than Herb and his
mate).

< Herbert sees Thorium and his mate in their car, gets out and starts
  walking over tough like >

< Thorium gets out of car with UZI behind him >

Thorium:  "You want it Herb"

Herbert:  "Yup!" (fists across his chest, looking tough to impress these
           slags)

< Thorium pulls out the UZI, extends the stock and cocks it, which looks
  really excellently real >

Thorium:  "Well fucking come and get it then!!!"

Herbert:  "...eeehehnn..."  (Really funny high-pitched sound)

Thorium:  "C'mon, you wanted a fight!"

< now here comes the classic all-time stupid thing to say to a psychopath
  with a gun >

Herbert:  "Well shoot me then"

Thorium:  "I won't shoot you unless it's in self defense.  I get less time
           that way"

Herbert:  "."

Thorium:  "Well, if you're not man enough to fight, don't ask for it
           faggot."

< Thorium gets into the car with his friend, drive off.  NB:  One of these
  fat chicks made the second worst comment to a psychopath with a gun:
  "Dick" >

Another day goes past, Herbert comes to school in the morning after Thorium
and his mate had just told the whole class about the previous day's
happenings.  Herbert walks into class, the whole class (well about 3/4 of
them) all simultaneously say "Dit Dit Dit Dit" - Herbert looks a complete
Herbert.

This appeared to be the end of this until that Friday night (3 days later)
when mister policeman turns up on Thorium's doorstep with a search warrant.
"Humm.." thinks Thorium - is this for phreaking, hacking, or bomb making?
Thorium sees Mr.  Policeman while he is talking to Thorium's (VERY
surprised) mother - Thorium splits for a few mins and stashes all his gear
and backups, then starts the HPA partition of his HDD on formatting.  Then
goes back...

Mr Policeman then totally surprises Thorium when he shows him a "search and
seizure" notice for an "UZI semi or fully automatic pistol".

A train of thought goes very quickly through Thoriums mind, something like
"One of the neighbors saw it?  Naah, no-one did.  He can't have narked.
Could he?  Is he lame enough?  Fuckwit, he probably is!"

Of course Mr. Policeman knows what he's looking for, so there's no point in
bullshit, besides which Thorium's mother has already said it's his
brothers gun.  Thorium goes and gets it, hands it over.  Mr. Policeman
tells Thorium to come down to the police station the next morning (it could
be worse - Mr. Policeman could have arrested Thorium then and there...)

Thorium gets a huge massive lecture from his old lady, the goes back to his
room and finds that OH SHIT it was formatting!  Aaah well, good job those
backups were only about 2 weeks old...  Some time early the next morning
recovery is complete...

Meanwhile Thorium has to explain the fact that big brother's UZI just
walked out the door with a policeman attached when big brother gets home...

The next morning (Saturday) Thorium goes down to the station, and has a
videotaped interview with Mr. Policeman.  This takes about an hour of
otherwise perfectly good hacking time.  Apparently according to New Zealand
law, a firearm is ANY OBJECT WHICH CAN FIRE, OR CAN BE MADE TO FIRE THROUGH
THE ADDITION, REMOVAL OR FIXING OF PARTS, AND BULLET, MISSILE OR PROJECTILE
- which means a pound of butter could be a firearm - all you have to do is
add the guts of a pistol...

Thorium gets home again (to another lecture etc).  Things are fine for the
rest of the weekend...

On Monday Thorium tells quite a few people about Herbert calling the cops
on a FAKE gun in a REAL SMALL argument...  Herb comes to school, and most
people point out to him what a fuckwit he is.

Anyway, as yet there has been no further action (the police still have the
UZI replica) but the case has been handed up to Mr. Policemans "Superiours"
and Thorium will eventually be sent a summons or whatever.  Herbert is
thought of as even more of a fuckwit than usual.  That's about it.

As a result of this:  Thorium will probably never be able to own a firearm.
Not a problem however, as he regularly makes his own guns and bombs in
preparation for when "They" come (naah, only for fun really...).  He will
also probably end up with a few hundred hours community service, and if he
ever gets busted (even slightly) for HPA stuff, then he will probably be
classed as a repeat offender and go to prison for a stay at "Her Majesty's
Pleasure".


The morals of this are:

1)  The police get almost as upset about fake guns as real ones, stupid as
    it may seem.

2)  Never assume a fuckwit won't go to the police even for a small
    illegality.  He thought it'd get Thorium back, but all it did is make
    Herbert look even more of a fuckwit than usual.  However, Thorium will
    now probably have to do community service and pay fines, none of which
    help Herbert, but certainly fuck Thorium right off.


[Editors Note:  "Herbert" in this article is actually "Jason Collins" who's
 vital info will be disclosed (I requested it from Thorium) so you may do
 as you wish with it.  Thorium consents to all persons hassling Herbert.]

Potassium Permanginate Starters:

Most anarchists know the Potassium Permanginate lighter, but for those who
don't, here it is:

Potassium Permanginate (Condyes Chrystals) are a strong oxidising agent,
and when mixed with glycerine (normal cooking glycerine is suitable) it
will spontaneously combust.  Depending on the ambient temperature and the
ratios, there may be a delay of a couple of seconds to several minutes
before combustion occurs.  If a _SMALL_ amount of water is mixed with the
glycerine, the time will increase.

This way you can almost "set" a specified time for detonation of any other
flammable substance (or wick or whatever).  To speed up the reaction, change
the temperature (a little change does a _LOT_ - what takes 5 secs in summer
can take a minute in winter - so, you can make a LONG time delayed mix,
then put this somewhere it will heat up at a given time (like to body temp
or a bit above) then this will set it off.  VERY handy!

Potassium Permanginate is available from most chemical supply companies,
and is not a restricted substance in New Zealand, but if asked what you
want it for say "REDOX (ree-dox) Titrations" - it might help to give the
name of a local high-school or university .

Glycerine is available from almost all supermarkets as "Cooking Glycerine"
and is used in baking.

     CRYPTOGRAPHY: A terribly brief introduction.

     There are quite a few ways of notating information so
that its meaning is not immediately obvious.  Some of the more
interesting ways require altering surprisingly few aspects of
the information to be described.

     I will describe one simple method I used for the first
time in the fourth-form at College.  I experimented with the
two main classes of substitution ciphers, both monoalphabetic
and polyalphabetic.  Monoalphabetic ciphers are functions in
which each symbol in the plaintext is replaced with only one
other cipher equivalent; "a" might always encipher to "z," for
instance.  Polyalphabetic ciphers can be quite a bit more
complex - "a" might encipher to any other symbol depending on
your arbitrary method.

     The most well-known monoalphabetic substitution cipher is
called the "Caesar" cipher.  Its first use has been connected
to the Roman Empire.  In this cipher, each letter of the
alphabet is shifted along an arbitrary distance.  For
instance, you might decide to pick the letter following your
plaintext one by three places - you would write "a" as "d,"
for example, when enciphering.  When deciphering, you would
write an "a" when you saw a "d" in the ciphertext.

     Such ciphers are regarded today as childish and
uninteresting.  However, combined with some transposition,
they can be made quite fun to play with.

     In the cipher we used, which I believe was suggested by a
friend of mine (and I suspect the cipher was not originally
from him), we did just monoalphabetic substitution on vowels. 
So if we saw an "a," or an "e," for instance, we'd write them
down as "b," or "f," respectively.  All the other letters we
left unchanged.

     However, we introduced a transposition twist; spaces
between words were replaced by the unenciphered form of the
last vowel used.  Say the last vowel we enciphered was an "a,"
which we would've written as a "b."  The space between that
word and the next we would've then replaced with an "a."

     Throughout the ciphertext, we scattered spaces at random,
since spaces no longer had any significance.

     So, wherever there is a vowel in ciphertext, there is
really a space, and spaces as written in the ciphertext have
absolutely no meaning whatsoever.

     An example, then.  Take the plaintext, "My name is
Siggy."  Here's the enciphered version:

     Myan bmfejs iSjgg y.
     My n ame is  Sigg y.

     Notice how the random spacing serves to confuse the
issue.  Note also how I have replaced every space with the
vowel last used; for the first space, since I had not yet
enciphered a vowel, I just arbitrarily picked an "a."

     With only a little practice this cipher can be read and
written as fluently as normal English.  There is point of
particular importance, in writing a program to implement this
cipher; it is impossible to say, without knowing the correct
deciphered version of a word, whether a letter following a
vowel is a vowel or really only the letter as it appears.  For
instance, a program has no easy way of telling whether the "j"
in "Sjggy" is really an "i," or if it is really just a "j."

     To the human eye the correct translation is obvious in
context, anyway.

     In closing, I should say that this sort of cipher really
drives teachers and people with IQs less than room temperature
up the wall with alacrity.  Perhaps in another issue I will
discuss other pieces of cryptography that are both interesting
and simple - I suppose this will really depend on how strongly
the world in general dislikes my articles, hint, hint.

   So there's an indepth look at the people in SLi.  We have only a few
   members because we only use the best, and my people are that (or close to 
   to it).  They are all friends and comrades.  We fight for freedom, and the 
   right to live how we want.  We fight for information and we fight against 
   corps that think they can control us.... or anyone.

Things to do with Redox Bombs:                                      Thorium

As a follow up to my article in the last mag on "Redoxon Bombs" (a type of
fairly safe pipebomb for those who missed it), here is a number of fun uses
I have put them to:

1)  Exhaust poppers.  The Redoxon Tubes are just the right size to put down
    someones exhaust with some space for the gas to escape.  So, here's a
    fun activity:

Read the article on Potassium Permanginate Starters.  Right, now you know
how to get something to go off when it gets hot.

All you have to do it sit the Redoxon Bomb inside the exhaust tube of your
opponents car, and place a small amount of your "Infinate Time" Pot.
Permanginate mix over the wick.

When you opponents car is going for a while it will go off, and either
scare the hell out of them, or split the exhaust pipe open!

Note - My friends and I tried this on an old car that a mate was taking to
the wreckers, and the bomb split the exhaust, but I think this was only
because it was quite old and rusty.  You may wish to do similar stuff with
bigger bombs, it's up to you.


2)  Bomb Fishing.  The Redoxon Bombs are made of metal and plastic, and
therefore are pretty waterproof, except for the small hole for the wick.

The wick itself is the wick off some old firework, I find those REAL cheap
mini-skyrocket wicks best.  The green wick from most Chinese fireworks will
actually burn underwater.  So, get a length of this wick (About 5cm is in
the mini skyrockets) and use this.

Put vasaline, wax or whatever over the hole.  Now go to your favorite
fishing spot (Ponds in Public Parks are GREAT) and light it and chuck it
in.

BOOM.  SPLASH.  You have just send a huge shockwave through the water.
Like in a depthcharge, the air inside anything underwater is compressed and
expands with the shock, and ruptures weak containers.

Fish have oxygen in their blood, as well as many soft body parts, so after
about 2 minutes, they all start floating to the surface on their backs
(Dead of course).

Now, if you feel like it you can collect your catch, or just wait till some
mother and kid go to feed 'em!  "Mummy, why are all the fish upside down?"

A group of my friends and I got into the local paper with this trick by
doing all the fish ponds in a park in one night.  The article said they
thought it was pollution...  HEHEHEHE...

How to Rip Off Music Stores - Thorium

Sick of paying $20 for a tape???  Feel like just copying it, but find that
the copy isn't even close in quality?  Try this, but not too often:

Got to your music shop and buy that tape you want.  (You can afford CDs?
well you can afford to pay.)  Since you can't do this too often, it would
be a good idea to buy a double or tripple album and do this to it.  Also,
for reasons that become clear below, make sure you and a friend both want
it.  You each pay half of the cost of the tape and a blank of the same
length - poor quality, of course...

Now buy a blank tape of the same length, and copy side A of your tape.
Wait till the source has fully unwound.  Now cut the destination tape
there.  Undo the destination tape, and chuck out any remaining tape.  Now
open the SOURCE tape, and take it off it's spool, and put it aside.  Open
the spool of the destination tape and attach this to the original tape
end.  Now attach the original spool to the copied tape.  You have now
swapped 1 spool, and cut the copied tape to the correct length.

Record side B and then swap spools as described above.  Now swap the COPIED
tape with ORIGINAL spools into the ORIGINAL case and the ORIGINAL tape
with COPIED spools into the COPIED case.  Do them both up again.

Now take the "original" tape back to the shop as complain that the tape
has a lot of hiss.  The will play it and find that there is, because all
copies have this.  Ask for a replacement copy, which you first "Test" to
see if it is different, which it is.  Take the replacement copy home, and
keep it.  Give the "copy" which is actually the original MEDIA to your
friend, since you did all the hard work.

Don't do this too often because they may catch on.  However it is most
effective if a group of you that all want the same tape pair off and do it
(with a reasonable amount of time between so as not to arouse suspicion).
That way the store thinks it's a semi-dud batch...

Have fun, and half-price tapes!

Hey there yet again!  Yup, you guessed it..... time for me to spill my guts
to you all - gotta talk to someone, so it may as well be EVERYONE... ;)
This magazine has been a bit of a rush, but, as per usual, it doesn't take
me long to spill my life story out onto a computer - what is there to say? =)

I don't think I'll include my big 'hi's coz I'll most prolly miss out on some
people, and I wouldn't want that now, would I? =)  Okay... what's happened
lately that's worth talking about... hmm.. not a lot really.. 

Hmm, from word through the grapevine, it appears that Actrix has had a bit 
of a hacker problem as of late.. well, maybe I should rephrase that to,
"Actrix's hacker problem seems to be rising rapidly".. =)  Now, it seems, 
"Mr SysOp" is using 'Crack', or some form of password cracker to check up
on any any accounts which have easily guessable passwords, and take the 
account down until the user telephones him and changes the password to some-
thing less guessable.  Well, that's what I've heard anyway.  

Telecom has been busy over the past few months, and we, SLi, have had a few
run-ins with them - not any which have prompted us to pay any fine, or such,
but they've been interesting.  A few members have had a few MORE run-ins 
than others, but that's a different story.  It seems that Telecom has been
stocking up li'l things they've had the pleasure of finding out - ie. names,
numbers, events.. etc.. - and had only been using those to their advantage 
over the past few months.  One of the main reasons we haven't got around to 
doing much in the phreaking scene (other than carding 'n' stuff) as of late.

They've managed to figure out that there have been a few people trashing 
in their bins over the past year or so, and have supposedly done something
to change that - from what I hear, they've removed the bins altogether...
instead of simply chaining and locking them.  But, then again, I haven't
been there in a while, so I might go find out for m'self.

Wait just a minute... I feel a deep and meaningful thought come on...
Hmm, maybe I should change this to being the 'Gossip Column'... okay.. so
I never said it was important, or intellegent, just deep and meaningful.. =)

Hmm, well, other than all that, there really isn't all that much going on
of any interest.. well, there isn't anything which I can say which wont
get me into loads of trouble, so I guess I'd better signout... =)

Re: [REMOVED]

Mr. [REMOVED]

AT&T respectfully requests your consideration of the following issues
related to the criminal acts committed by [REMOVED].  AT&T and its customers
are among the many victims of [REMOVED].  We have obtained copies of
physical evidence and computer files seized during his arrest.  A
preliminary review of the material has revealed extensive lists of
contraband (e.g. Visa, Master Card, Calling Card account numbers and
associated proprietary customer information) as well as additional
details of unlawful acts committed by [REMOVED].

Considering the sheer volume of material, it may take several weeks to
conduct a thorough examination.  It is anticipated that other victims
and losses will be identified and additional criminal charges filed.
Accurate quantification of losses can only be conducted at the
completion of the review.  A detailed report should be read by Friday,
December 16, 1994.

In the interim, it is critical that no handwritten files, notes,
computer equipment (hardware, software, peripherals, etc...) be returned
to [REMOVED].  The computer was the "weapon" that allowed [REMOVED] to commit
the crime.  Returning any or all of the above-referenced items could be
likened to returning a handgun to a convicted armed robber.  In light of
the damages estimated to be in excess of $40,000 it may be appropirate
to consider [REMOVED] computer assets as partial restitution.

I welcome your comments and suggestions regarding this matter.  Please
call me at [REMOVED].

Respectfully,


Matt Connolly
Investigations Manager

 [Dont that just make you vomit !!!!] 



 Now for more laughter here is a news-paper artical.



                POLICE PULL PLUG ON PHONE SCHEME [FRONT PAGE]

   When scott policeman Edward Pivick and Robert Zimmerman arrived on the
   scene, the trail was still warm and talking.
   Responding to a womans call about voices in the woods near her home, the
   officers discovered 100 feet of cable leading into the woods from an open
   telephone junction box outside her apartment building.
   At the other end of the cable, they found a metal folding chair and a
   phone, chattering with what sounded like four teenagers talking.
   Since that discovery Aug. 6 police and Bell Atlantic security officials
   have been trying to find out who used the illegal tap in to make hours long
   conference calls to people around the United States and the world and bill
   them to Scott residents' private lines.
   In a month or two, participants racked ypu more than 60 hours and
   thousands of dollars worth of calls to New Zealand, Israel, Germany,
   Florida, New Jersey, Texas and Colorado.
   Bell Atlantic workers have sealed and buried the junction box at the
   270-unit Kings Grant Condominiums off Cochran Road and plan to bury another
   one.  The Boxes usually stand about 3 feet above the ground and join
   undergrond phones lines.
   Police have yet to make any arrests.
   "At one point, I heard one of the males say, "The cops came, but I don't
   think they saw me,'" said Povirk, who listened to the Aug. 6 conversation
   for about 20 minutes.
   Povick said he beleives the person who broke into the box and made the
   illegal tap-in ran home after seeing patrolmen in the area.
   Since then, Bell Atlantic and AT&T security officials have been matching
   condominuim residents' phone bills against phone records to try to find
   where the calls went.
   One resident's phone bill last month was more than $4,000.  On it was a
   293 minute call to New Zealand costing $306 and a 110 minute call to Germany
   costing $86.
   So far, only one local number has been identified as a conference call
   participant.  That number is assigned to a residence in Ross that has
   several phone lines and a computer.  No one there has been charged, but the
   calls could constitute a felony because they were valued at more than
   $2,000.
   Stephen Capp, senior investigator for Bell Atlantic Security in
   Pittsburgh, said the investigation would continue.
   "We'll exhaust every possibility.  We're not giving up," Capp said
   yesterday.                            [Ed's Note         ^ra^ ???]
   The Scott case is more sophisticated than most cases of phone service
   theft, Capp said.
   "They opened up the box and used something like alligator clips to clip
   onto the phone [line] itself."
   Capp said all calls were made during the middle of the night, when most
   people are asleep and their phones are not in use.  He said Bell Atlantic
   had received several complaints from people in the Kings Grant Area about
   erroneous phone charges prior to Aug. 6.  He said calls were placed in July
   and possibly June.
   Kevin Montaque of AT&T corporate security in Bridgewater, N.J., said AT&T
   routinely monitors its lines for unusual activity and had picked up
   excessive usuage on at least two Kings Grant residents, including the woman
   who reported the voices.
   Though Capp said no reports of phone fraud had been reported since Aug 6,
   Argall Management Inc., which operates the condominiums, said a resident
   yesterday reported receiving a bill for calls to 900 number sex lines.
   Capp said some of the conference calls could have been to 900 numbers but
   most were not.

 A new computer service in Wellington is causing considrable consern,
 the sevice provides instions on terrisum and sabotage tequneques some of 
 it taken from a book banned by the indecent publications tribunal
 david jamerson reports...


 [Dave]

 This would be the last place many would expect to find advice on terrist
 tequneques but its here , in homes across the country computer operators 
 are talking to eachother via buliten bords they are programs that allow
 users to exchange information and some of the information on this new
 buliten board has computer users here worried scared of reprisals they
 wanted to remain anonimous. 


 [Mike] 

 I could start utilising this information tomorrow if i wish yes so its very 
 serious


 [Dave]

 Well we made a printout of some of the information thats avalible on this 
 buliten board now heres an example of the sort of stuff you can find out 
 for example building a flame thrower umm how to make a working letter bomb 
 firebombs , napalm , matchhead bomb , fuse ignition fire bomb , how to make 
 a phone tap and how to make tear gas the list just goes on and on... 
 How to knock out a phone exchange and an entire citys telephones is even 
 described.


 [Telco Lamer]

 We take active mesures to makesure our network remains intact thats got 
 essintual services like 111 involved patantly safeguarding the integraty
 of our network is inportant. 


 [Dave]

 Much of the information has been lifted from the poormans james bond 
 a home made terrosum type book banned by the indecent publications tribunal 
 But the operators of the buliten board are quite open in shearing the 
 information.. 

 [Mike] 

 Chat .. here we go look were chatting to him.  


 [Dave]

 Infact as we were filming we started talking live to the person who runs the
 service there replies are in yellow they told us how another buliten board
 member had be busted for hacking then boasted that the cops would never 
 catch them.

 David Jamerson one network news.


 [News Presentor]

 Tonight police say there extreemly consurned that this type of information
 is avalible. and the new clasification of films, videos and publications bill
 now before paliment aims to make spreding milicious information by computer
 illegal.

 Comming up ..

     LINUX: a short and opinionated review.

     Linux is a multitasking, multiuser, unix-like operating system intended
to become POSIX-compliant.  Since most of the technical details are better
left to the FAQ, I'll omit them here.

     Briefly, Linux will run on any common 386 PC or better, having at least
2 MB of memory (the theoretical minimum).  Ports are currently being
developed for several other processors, including the DEC Alpha.  Linux
supports practically any common hardware combination that any other PC OS
would support, excepting particularly machines with an MCA bus.

     Linux was originally written by Linus Torvalds, a computer scientist
from Finland.  It is currently being written by, to quote the FAQ, "a
loosely-knit team of hackers around the net."  Linus has placed his OS under
the GNU Public License, meaning that it can be distributed freely, along with
its source code.

     Linux supports most any software available for any other Unix system; I
personally have and use copies of such programs as emacs-19.5 and gcc 2.6.2,
and the GNU shell, bash.  I am able to run the DOS emulator that has been
developed for Linux, which is more precisely a DOS-machine emulator - you
still have to provide a bootable copy of DOS, though you can run DOS and DOS
programs within a virtualised machine whilst Linux runs alongside.  I have
found the emulator to be quite stable, though at version 0.53 there seems
still much work to be done on it.  Also available is a Windows emulator that
will eventually make it possible to run Windows programs completely
independently from a real copy of Windows.

     Linux has convenient support for other operating systems sharing the
same disk; it can access the files on DOS, OS/2 HPFS (currently read-only),
System V, Minix, among others.  Though Linux can share a disk with another
operating system, it is a complete system in its own right - you do not need
to have any other OS installed on your system at all.  For many months I ran
Linux as the only software on my system, though recently I added a
DOS-partition to run DOS as is occasionally demanded by my job.  For this
there is a multi-boot loader, LILO, which can let you choose an operating
system to boot when you start your computer.

     I have been running Linux for some months now, and I have not missed
any part of DOS - being free of TSR and memory-management hassles alone has
been worth the change.  I often while using other DOS machines have
absent-mindedly tried to switch consoles, and I have become increasingly
frustrated with single-tasking.

     For those wanting the X-windows system, implementations are available,
and most name-brand video cards are supported.  There is an extensive range
of software for communications and networking - fax/modems, network cards -
and most of the paraphernalia demanded by multimedia - CDROM drives,
scanners, sound cards (including the Gravis Ultrasound and the ubiquitous
Sound Blaster family).  I myself use a Hercules video card and monitor, with
which I am more than satisfied, though this point of view is seen a little
extreme by my local computing community.  My machine is a 486DX/40, with 8MB
of RAM, which seems to run Linux admirably.

     From the programmer's perspective, Linux is a wonderful environment to
program in.  Being a "protected-mode" OS, it is quite difficult to crash -
and, in fact, I have never had Linux crash on me in all the months I have
been running it.  Much of the programming I do is in C, and that with quite
heavy pointer algebra; the occasions where I have used a pointer incorrectly
Linux has always shut the program down cleanly.  One of my more recent
projects required writing a background daemon, and the signal and exception
handling made available by Linux was a dream to work with.  My daemon can
handle sensibly most any common situation, and can even help debug pointer
problems in itself.  I have also occasionally used the GNU Pascal compiler,
GPC, and the GNU Pascal-to-C translator to compile some of my earlier work -
the Pascal compiler is reasonably complete, so if your main language isn't C
you won't be stuck without one.

     The games I have on my machine are Linux-ported versions of the Lost
Treasures of Infocom, of which I have a DOS copy.  I was able to obtain the
C source for an Infocom interpreter, and with only a little work on the code
I can now play some of my favourite Zorks and Spellcasters.  For those of
you who think that a repetitive collection of sound and graphics effects
constitutes a game, Doom for Linux and X-windows is provisionally available
and will read DOS Doom's .WAD files.  Purportedly it is possible to play it
over the Internet as well, but I hope most people realise what a waste of
network resources that would be.

     World-wide several hundred-thousand people run Linux as their primary
OS - this number is healthily growing.  With an OS that offers as much as
Linux, with the source as freely available, it is little wonder that it is
enjoying such success.

     Now would be a good time to get rid of DOS and run a sensible OS - I
think your choice of that sensible OS should be Linux.

     - "Siggy."

 [Editors note ! YES !! this OS rox all REAL people should run it !! ]

The Old Pipe-Bomb - Modernized

The pipe bomb has been the ol' faithful for anarchists since it's
invention.  The main reason for this is that it is EASY to make.

There are, however, two major problems with it:

- People tend to blow their hands off making them
- People tend to get suspicious when you walk into a hardware shop asking
  for 20 endcaps each week...

So, for both of these problems, I have a solution.  It takes a little more
work than making the origional, but as you will see, it can be A LOT more
useful.

The basic idea is two tubes, each with one totally secured end, which can
slide inside eachother.  See diagram.

----------------
 ^ Strong End ^

Right, basically we have the two tubes, which slide inside eachother, this
should be an interference fit (may need oiling even, the tighter the
better).

The two tubes should be of the same length (about 15cm dows well) and quite
thick (I use 3mm steel, however this may be overdoing it).  The bases
should be welded on the ends REALLY TIGHT, and make sure it's a REALLY GOOD
weld.  If these come undone you won't have a bomb, and they have to be
stronger than the sheer required to break high tensile steel.  A local
engineering firm will be able to do this for you as long as you don't say
what you're gonna use them for.
                                                                         
Have a large plate as the end of at least the outside tube, see why later.
                                                                         
Now that you have the two tubes made, place them together, but not quite
all the way together (leave about 5mm or so each end, excluding the weld).
Now get a drill press and place a hole about 5-8mm diameter through both
sides.  MAKE SURE THEY ARE HELD REALLY WELL otherwise they might slip off a
straight line, which destroys your bomb...

PS - it is slightly stronger if the two holes are at 90 degrees to each
other, ie:

End on view:
   ____
  /    \
 /  I   \
 | _I__ | _/ Drill one here
 |  I   |  \ 
 \  I   /
  \____/

    ^ and one through here.

You should be able to fit a piece of high tensile rod (which you bought
earlier, right?) through each hole, and sticking about 1cm out each side.
With these in you can't pull your two ends apart.  Can you guess how it
works yet?

Now, with these together, drill a very small (1mm or less) diameter through
the middle, at 45 degrees to each of your rods (in the center).  This only
goes through one side.  Now take this to bits, and on the outside one drill
this same hole with a larger bit (about 5mm) - this is so when you put it
together there is some room for slip.  This hole is for the wick.

Now drill a small hole in the corner of each base that is sticking out.
This is just to attach some wire to keep hold of it when she blows.

Ok, now to actually make the bomb.


Use your favorite low explosive (I use the "Sweet Powder" from the last
issue) and fill some sort of plastic bag that will fit inside the center
tube.  A condom works well.  Seal the end of it (to stop getting powder
everywhere) then put this to the side.  Low explosive is one that expands
"slowly" like gunpowder, as opposed to something like C4 which goes all at
once.

Put a pin in the bottom hole of the inside tube, then a small ball of paper
on top of that.  Then put your bag of explosive in, and then enough paper
balls in to fill it to the bottom of the top pin hole.  Take out the bottom
pin with the tube on it's side (so the paper don't fall down and block the
hole).


Now put the two tubes together slide in your high tensile pins, and you
almost have a bomb.  You may wish to stick these pins against the side of
the case with tape or sommit, so they don't drop out if you made it too
loose.

When you are ready for action (because you have the explosive inside a
fairly waterproof bag this can be a fair while later) you puncture the bag
through the small wick hole, then insert your wick.  Place the bomb with
the ends pointing in "safe" directions, light the wick and run like hell.

The explosive expands, putting pressure on all sides and ends.  Because the
sides of the tubes are double thickness, it will take a fuck of a lot of
pressure to break these, so all the presure is really trying to force the
ends open.  This is why you neded such good welding on the ends.  What
happens is that the pins will eventually get so much pressure between these
layers of steel that they will be sliced appart like string cut with
scisors, and the ends will fly appart with much speed.

If you look at the remaining bits of steel from the pins, you will see how
cleanly they are cut.  If this makes a little more bang than you want, you
could use brass or copper rod, which will slice easier.


Right, we not have a bomb that required no direct friction on the powder
(99% of the cause for losing ones hands with conventional pipe bombs) and
if you can find them, the ends are totally reusable.  Don't bother trying
to tie them to anything yet to keep hold of them - it will just break.

The only "Combustable" appart from your explosive are these lengths of high
tensile steel - and noone will ask questions about that.


Creative uses for the new modem pipe bomb:

You will realise that for the bomb to actually release pressure, not only
does it have to slice two pins, but the ends have to come appart.  This
means almost twice it's length.  The blast will be all against these ends.
This is VERY USEFUL.

1) - Have both tubes with fairly small ends, and place inside letterboxes -
     the sides are both knocked out totally, leaving little evidence!

2) - Have both tubes with large flat ends, and place this under a car
     chassis.  I have done this on a firends farm with an old car body, not
     a real car.  As long as you have it fairly well up under the chassis
     when it goes off the car lifts about 30cm in the air - a LONG way if
     you were in it.  I havent got up the guts (or would that be stupidity)
     to actually sit in it while this happens, but I think it may be very
     unhealthy for occupants.

3) - Have both tubes with large flat ends, with holes drilled in the
     corner.  Attach about 6 - 10 meters of heavy fishing line to each,
     then take your bomb down to the port, light and chuck it in.  Silence.
     The whole warf shakes though!  (Water dissipates the shock since it
     goes off about 6m down, so you can't hear it.)  About 2 secs later a
     large ball of gas reaches the surface (what actually did the work) and
     about 2 more seconds later a whole bunch of dead fish start floating
     to the surface in about a 4 meter radius of your bomb!

     The reason your parts didn't fly off the line and you can pull them
     back up is that water is much more dense than air, and the large flat
     ends create a lot of friction in the water.

     You may find that you have to get waterproof wick for this (I use
     normal wick with petrolium jelly on it).  The bag for the explosive
     should be well sealed, and I find pouring liquid petrolium jelly over
     the whole thing leads to far lower failure rates.

4) - Armor piercing bullets.  You have the outside tube with a large flat
     end, and the inside tube with a small end with a steel ball beering
     about 1cm diameter welded on (TIGHT).  You could go for pointy ends
     and that sord of thing, but in my expreience they just blunten after a
     few uses anyway.  Now put the base agains something large, like a
     tree, and aim at your target.  Again, I did this (Many times - it's
     real fun) at my friend's farm with this old car body.  The inside tube
     went STRAIGHT THROUGH 2 layers of sheet steel on one side door, and
     hit the other side door, breaking the first sheet of steel and denting
     the other side about 10cm out! - With more improvement or stronger or
     bigger pins, it may be able to go all the way through.  However this
     is not a particularly suttle way of doing someone's car, however fun,
     so I wouldn't advise it.

 Okay, as of late, I've discovered that there seems to be a lack of con-
 fidence over who exactly is a part of Southern Lights inc.  At no point 
 has there been a total recount over who exactly exists in the group and 
 I thought I'd go about finding out for myself - even though I'm a co-
 chaiperson (I guess that's what I could be called... ;) ..

 I decided to come up with an idea (which was wholly supported by Eon,
 so I guess it must be okay.. =) ) of how to figure out who is definatly
 in SLi and who isn't...

 Firstly, I'd like to go about listing the current members as of 
 December, 1994.


 Founding Members:
 Eon and BT

 Gwythion

 At present, that's about all I'm comfortable in saying are part of SLi -
 seeming that we're all still a bit unsure as to who's in and who's not..

 We've decided upon asking for new, fresh blood of all you H/P/A guys/gals
 reading this mag - you've got to pass standards tho' so only the best need
 apply =) ... If you're interested, just send the attatched form below

 Ok umm how to build a few 


 Easy:

     Get a fly spray can and a lighter hold lighter infront of spray 
     and light liquid comming out of can. 

 Better:

     Get one of them charge bottles fill it with petrol 
     get a glass <or metal> tube block one end put string down the tube 
     fill the tube with petrol tape tube to charge bottle so the flame from 
     the tube is a cm or so infornt of the nozle bit on the charge bottle 
     pull triger and boom flamez !!! 


 The best! :

     Get a water blaster <makesure its a good one with no rubber seals 
     get 40 gal brumb and fill it with petrol get one of those electric
     gass lighter things and connect it to the triger of the water blaster 
     put hose from water blaster into 40 gal drumb and pull trigger 
 
  what happens:
         Water blaster sucks up petrol fires it out the eletric igniter 
         ignites the fuel and a VERY big LONG flame shoots out towards 
         what ever you were pointing at. be warned its dangerous
