        Letter from the head guys:

        Hey!  This is Dr. Menace and Angel of Death.  We're the guys in
        charge of all this bullshit.  We imagine you are no doubt thinking,
        "Oh god.  Another fly-by-night underground computer hacker
        magazine!"  Well, we actually have a purpose for this one.  Here's
        the story:

        One day Angel of Death and myself were sitting around.  We realized
        that "Hey, there are magazines on drugs, magazines on weapons,
        magazines on phreaking, and magazines on hacking, but no really
        wonderful compilations all of the above."  (Of course, I am para-
        phrasing.)

        So here is the fruits of our effort.  I hope ya like it.

========================================================================

        This week's letter from Dr. Menace:


   What's up y'all.  Sorry this one is so late...finals at school are
   getting in the way of the important things in life.  :)

   Anyways, as you read through this, you'll probably notice the lack of
   articles from Angel of Death!  This is because I made this issue one
   day while I was home sick and didn't tell him about it because I
   wanted to get it out QUICK.

   So we have an FTP site now, listed at the bottom, and soon we'll have
   another at netcom.com ... as well as a mailing list there.  Stay
   tuned for more info!  Later.

========================================================================

========================================================================

        Shout outs: What's up to U4EA and the BoW staff (I BoW down to
        you.)...Phrack, (Even though I still liked the old one better.)
        the uXu staff, ACT, the nice folks at the Gutenberg Project, and
        YaZoO, for your wonderful ToolZ script.  What the hell would I
        do without you man.

  Title: Here Kitty, Kitty
   Date: 5/13/94


----------------------------------------

        If you are into the modern scene, you've probably read the text
        file GLUE102.TXT, the Prophecy of Glue.  If so, you know that
        all cats must die.  This is just a fact.  Man and cat were never
        meant to be friends.  The following is a rather extravagant
        manner of err...eradicating the little pests.


        Needed: 1) 1 can of tuna fish.
                2) Some black powder or gun powder.
                3) 1 "party popper"
                4) String
                5) 1 can of epoxy.
                6) 1 toy mouse.

        Ok, take the can of tuna.  Rinse it out throroughly and dry it.
        Then squeeze some oil from the tuna by and and CONSERVATIVELY
        coat the insides of the can with it.  Then lightly flour the
        can, as you would a cookie sheet and bundt cake pan, so the
        surface is dry.  The smell should draw cats to the general
        vacinity.  Now put a SMALL hole the can with a screwdriver.
        Put the party popper (These are those things that look like
        little plastic champaigne bottles that send out paper and sparks
        when you pull the string) inside the can and lead the string
        through the hole.  Attach 3 more inches of string to it.  Should
        look like this:


                             __ Can of tuna.
                            |
                     ****************
                    *   [[][]]       *
                    *   [[][]] ---------Party popper.
                    *   [[][]]       *
                    *     []         *
                    *     []         *
                     ******+*********
                           +
                            + ---- String coming off of party popper.
                            +

        Now take the toy mouse, one stuffed with catnip, and grease it
        up thoroughly with oil from the tuna, or cod liver oil.  This
        will make the stupid fucking cat think it's something he should
        eat.  Now tie that mouse's tail to the string on the party
        popper.  Fill the remaining space in the can with black powder
        or gunpowder, and seal it off.  (We here at PfA prefer black
        powder, it's smokier.  After all, effect is everything.)

        Epoxy the the can to the ground.  What will happen is the cat
        will see the mouse, put it in his mouth, and try to carry it
        off.  This will pull the party popper string, and set off the
        gunpowder!  Good bye, fuckin' cat!!!

  Title: Pure Fucking Nicotine!
   Date: 5/10/94


----------------------------------------

        Alright guys...this is a recipe for one of the most popular
        drugs in the world if not THE most...nicotine.  For you absolute
        idiots, this is the addictive substance in cigarettes.

        First, you'll need some tobacco.  Measure out approximately 100
        grams of the shit.  Soak it for a week.  (Half a fortnight for
        you UK'ers.  Hahahahah.  I'm such an asshole.)

        The resulting substance will be brown and look kind of like
        shit.  Strain off the tobacco, and simmer the stuff until the
        liquid vaporizes away, leaving about 2 teaspoons of unpleasant
        looking material.  Now take it.


        If you did that...


        You are now dead.


        Don't you feel stupid?  That's more than enough to kill you
        dude!  You'll have to figure out exactly how much to take based
        on what kind of smoker you are, so I'll leave you guys up to
        that one.

        Ok guys....here's a really cool thing that's going on now...read

BEGIN FILE big_brother_inside_picts_info.txt

big_brother_inside_sticker.ps is a generic postscript file, created in
CorelDraw. The postscript image lies landscape on the page, and consists
of the intel-logo's ``swoosh'' and crayon-like lettering on the inside.

This design was originally created for the sticker project: the image was
screened onto transparent stickers 1" square for the purpose of applying
them to future clipper-chip products. (cdodhner@indirect.com was in charge
of that project; as far as I know he's still distributing them for a small
donation to cover printing & mailing costs).
<cut here>

        Pretty fucking rad huh?  I emailed him and there aren't any
        stickers left now but it's still a great .gif or .ps ...
        FTP or Gopher (puke.) the shit from cpsr.org in
        /cpsr/privacy/crypto/clipper.

        You can also find them on America Online in the Mac Telecom and
        Graphic Arts areas.

  Title: Project Gutenberg
   Date: 5/6/94


----------------------------------------

        I don't normally do articles on such conservative items as this,
        but I'm making an exception this time.  This article is about
        the Gutenberg Project.  And if any of you h/p dudes are as into
        free information as you always claim, you should hold these
        people in VERY high regard.

        Their mission is to provide people with digitized books and
        other literature for free.  (i.e. - putting books into text so
        you can FTP it etc.)

        They have done a very wide range of stuff, from the Gettysburg
        Address, to the Book of Mormon, to Around the World in 80 Days.
        People that work so hard for the benefit of others deserve more
        credit than they are currently getting so I just thought I'd
        take this chance to thank them.

        Gutenberg material can be FTP'd from etext.archive.umich.edu in
        /pub/Gutenberg.  They also appreciate donations, (tax
        deductible) which can be sent to:

                        Project Gutenberg
                        P. O. Box  2782
                        Champaign, IL 61825

        If you can't get ahold of them anyway else, contact their
        Executive Directory, Michael S. Hart, at: hart@vmd.cso.uiuc.edu
        (Internet) or hart@uiucvmd (bitnet.)

Thanx for your attention.

Appendix A - PfA BBS List Information.

 If run a hacker related Bulletin Board System, perhaps you would like
 to publicize your board to the appropriate crowd.  If so, call The
 Escapade Macabre and leave feedback to Dr. Menace or Angel of Death
 telling us the name, number and NuP (if any) of your BBS.  Thanx!

  Current BBS List:
  -==============-
{Name}                          {Phone #}               {NuP}

The Escapade Macabre            206-565-0786            None
The Private Cartel              206-475-7439            None
Hyperion 9                      206-984-9568            None

----------------------------------------

Appendix B - Submitting articles to PfA

 If you have read PfA, and like what you see, perhaps you'd be interested
 in being published in our fine magazine?

 If so call The Escapade Macabre and leave feedback to Dr. Menace (NOT
 Angel of Death.) that contains the body of the article, the author, the
 date, and the title.  Most articles will be accepted as long as they are
 of the appropriate genre.  Thanx!

----------------------------------------

Appendix C - Receiving copies of PfA

 The best way to receive PfA is of course by modem.  However this is not
 possible for all people, and we were at PfA realize that.  Very soon,
 you will be able to send a couple bucks to our post office box and get
 very nice bound copies of the current PfA issue.  (It looks real good,
 printed on a BubbleJet Printer with high quality paper, then carefully
 photocopied, and stapled.)  PfA can also be FTP'd from:

 etext.archive.umich.edu in pub/Zines/PfA

 At some point, we do plan on making a special hardcopy edition of PfA,
 featuring bold, italics, and underlines, with different sized fonts,
 hand drawn pictures, and a magazine format (Like 2600 sorta.) and
 everything, but this is a long way off....
----------------------------------------

Appendix D - Contacting the Editors

 There are a few ways you can contact Angel of Death and I.  Here they
 are:

 1) BBS: The Escapade Macabre, (206)565-0786.  A WWiV BBS run by Dr.
 Menace and Angel of Death.  We can both be contacted their.

 2) Yaki-Net: If you are one of the few people who are on Yaki-Net, try
 E-Mailing Dr. Menace@2600, or Angel of Death@2600, from any Yaki-Net
 BBS.  Some Yaki-Net BBS's carry an PfA discussion area, too.

 3) Internet: We can also be reached by InterNet!  Dr. Menace is
 drmenace@hebron.connected.com, and Angel of Death is
 craig@hebron.connected.com.  I (Dr. Menace) am also on the Telnet
 Citadel BBS's as Dr. Menace, and Angel of Death is also on them as Net
 Prowler.

 4) IRC: We will soon host a ?weekly? chat for 2-3 hours...probably on
 Fridays.  We do not have this totally worked out yet, but the channel
 name will be "PfAChat"...

 Any form of E-Mail is acceptable for submitting articles, just make
 sure you make you include the author, and subject of the article.

 Also, submissions may be posted in the "PfA Discussion" area of
 participating Yaki-Net BBS's.  (Please DO NOT post articles in the
 Hacking Discussion areas on Yaki-Net!!!)
----------------------------------------

Appendix E - Citing the Sources

 In short, we ain't gonna do it.  I've been through megs and megs...shit
 maybe gigs of text and sometimes have to extract information from
 memory and it would be totally impractical for me to try citing every
 source.  I will say though that useful info can be obtained from old
 BootLeggers and TAPs, Jolly Roger's Anarchist Cookbook, and
 LegalHi.Txt...

Have fun guyz!
