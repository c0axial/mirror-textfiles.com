        Letter from the head guys:

        Hey!  This is Dr. Menace and Angel of Death.  We're the guys in
        charge of all this bullshit.  We imagine you are no doubt thinking,
        "Oh god.  Another fly-by-night underground computer hacker
        magazine!"  Well, we actually have a purpose for this one.  Here's
        the story:

        One day Angel of Death and myself were sitting around.  We realized
        that "Hey, there are magazines on drugs, magazines on weapons,
        magazines on phreaking, and magazines on hacking, but no really
        wonderful compilations all of the above."  (Of course, I am para-
        phrasing.)

        So here is the fruits of our effort.  I hope ya like it.

========================================================================

        This week's letter from Dr. Menace:


   Hey guys.  I know, I know it's been a fucking LONG time since I put
   out an issue of this thing.  And I know that seems a tad
   irresponsible as I would like this to grow into a very popular 'zine,
   right up there with Phrack and 26oo!  (In my dreamz...)

   Well the thing is I wanted to setup a REAL mailing list...but we've
   got info on that and it's in the works...but as of my writing of this
   letter I'm sure we won't have it worked out in time for you to read
   this using that...

   Plans for the hardcopy edition of PfA are now being made.  We're not
   sure if it'll replace the data version or if they'll go side by side
   kinda like 40-Hex started doing quite sometime ago... I think it was
   40-Hex anyways.  (I'm out of it right now.)

   The layout will be a newspaper like format, but it'll be in magazine
   physical form.  It'll probably be done with Microsoft Word (A payed
   for copy of course!!! :-) ) so we can do really cool st00pid fonts
   and shit...

   I think we'll do it once we get past a couple hundred subscribers or
   something.  (Probably in 2001! haha.)

btw - Unless you are VERY fucking dumb you will have noticed the name
change by now, it's because there's some lame DiSCo group called ABBA.
Please note we are not endorsed (Nor do we endorse, by ANY fucking
means...) this DiSCo group...

l8r friendz.....


         btw - I realize the ASCii art in the beginning there is pretty
         lame...think you can do better?  Then send it to me...

  Title: WORKING Tennis Ball Bomb...
   Date: 03/10/94


----------------------------------------

        Okay...I've read somewhere...don't quote me on this but I
THINK it was the Jolly Roger's Anarchist Cookbook thing...about this
really lousy tennis-ball bomb.  How it worked was that you
jury-rigged...no jury-rigging is fixing something so it barely
works...this just doesn't work...a bunch of strike anywhere matches onto
a tennis ball half and putting blackpowder or some such behind them so
if you through it at the pavement near someone, and god was on your
fucking side and the correct surface area of it hit, the strike anywhere
matches would ignite, and fuck the dude up pretty bad.

        Well, this may not mean much from a guy who used to break
Macintosh password copy protections (A scheme which used to be common on
those lousy things.) by hand, but I'm not willing to rely on chance like
that.

        My method also involves a tennis ball.  First, cut it in half.
If I need to tell you how to do this then get lost, bud.  Next, get some
of those paper caps for cap guns.  You know the kind that are little
squares with pimples on them filled with gunpowder?  They come in
rolls...  Any ways, get a bunch of those.  Check this out:

                        half of the tennis ball.
                            |
                       _______________
                      / +++++++++++++ \
                     /++++++++++++++++ \
                    | +++++++++++++++++-+----- Get it?  Cover the inside
                    | +++++++++++++++++ |       with ROWS (This is important!)
                     \ +++++++++++++++ /        of the caps.
                       \_+++++++++++_/
                         -----------

                          epoxy all of the caps down except for every 3rd
                          cap, HEAVILY.  (If you do all of them there's a
                          slight chance it won't work.)

        Ok, this done, fill each half with gunpowder, then put
        paper on top of one half while you put it on top of the other.
        Slide the paper out and hotglue the halves together.  You may want
        to use something to weight it down if you want to be able to throw
        it further.

          The Gist: When the bomb strikes a surface, the caps will
        hit the hard epoxy layer and discharge, igniting the gunpowder.

              Hehehehehhahehaeohaoheh!  Great for bullies, assholes,
              sociology prof's....whatever.

  Title: Glory, Glory, Glory!
   Date: 03/11/94


----------------------------------------

        In our recent trends of covering hallinogenic materials, we are
now going to cover the wonderful world of Ipomoea violacea, that is, Morning
Glory seeds, of the convolculaceae, or bindweed family.

        Any part of the morning glory plant except for the roots will work,
but the seeds are the most potent.

        Generally consumption:

        Take from 5-10 grams grams orally, or grind 'em up really good, soak
'em for 40 minutes or so, strain it and drink it.

        What gets you high is the d-lysergic acid amide and the ergometrine,
it's kinda like LSD and last ya about 5-6 hours.

        DON'T fuck with this shit if you've had any sort of liver disorders,
or if you are pregnant or have had uterus surgery.  (The ergometrine has
uterus stimulating properties.)

        Also if you obtain it from a florist, it may have been treated with a
poison to discourage illicit use or with methyl mercury to preserve them.
This will make you puke and will give you the shits.  If you suspect the seeds
you've obtained are treated as such, plant 'em, and their offspring will not
be poisoned.

  Title: Announcement of the Upcoming
   Date: 03/11/94


----------------------------------------

        This is to announce a project that I will be starting soon.
This will be a large file, or a series of files (Which I am not sure
yet.) that covers how to make your own drugs.

        By this I don't mean step by step instructions like I have put
in here before.  I mean a guide to figuring out your own combinations.

        This will include which chemicals can have which effects, which
chemicals will neutralize the effects, and which can enhance them etc...
Allowing you to therefore mix and match.

  Title: The Chrome Box
   Date: 03/20/94


----------------------------------------
The Chrome Box

Emergency vehicles in many American cties have now beghun using devices 
called OptoComs.  An OptoCom is a sensor on traffic lights that will detect
a certain frequency of strobe coming off of an emergency vehicle.  The actual
frequency of the strobe varied from city to city, and many cities do not have
them at all intersections.

A Chrome Box is designed to fake the signals coming from these strobe lights,
so that your own car has the same priority as an ambulance, firetruck, or
police car.  

The first step is to watch an emergency vehicle.  If you watch a firetruck or
ambulance, they will probably have a strobe light mounted on top.  If this
light seems to send off a steady stream of flashes, just go to Radio Shack,
and get a strobe, and then adjust the flash rate until you cause traffic 
lights to change.  However, some cities use a system where the strobe sends
out a morse-code like pattern of flashes.

To figure these out, videotape an ambulance on the move, and then play it 
back in single-frame mode.  Unless your VCR specifies otherwise, each frame
will be 1/30th of a second, so you can just figure out the flash pattern 
from that.  

If you're confused, try calling the fire department and asking something like
"what are those flashing lights on the top of the trucks for?" or "how do you
get traffic lights to change when you drive through the intersection?".  If
you can find out where they get their equipment from, write the manufacturer
for a service manual, and they'll probably send you some information on it, 
some even send a schematic diagram of how to build the lights.  Just pose as 
a consultant or a free-lance journalist.

Sometimes you might need a faster strobe rate than your light allows, so you 
will have to modify it.  Just open it up and find the large capacitor inide, 
and replace it with one that has the same voltage rating, but a lower 
microfarad rating (marked on the outside).

You can also replace the potentiometer (the speed control device with the 
knob on it) with one that has a lower ohm rating (abbreviated with the greek
omega letter).  This will speed up the strobe.  You can also replace the
with one of a lower value, if there is one.

To generate a complex pattern, you will either have to design and build
a triggering circuit using IC chips, or rig up a mechanical device with
a multiple-contact rotary switch and a motor.  It HAS been done.

To run it out of your car, you will probable either need to get a 110-volt
inverter that will run off your cigarette lighter, or just get a battery-
powered strobe.

For extra stealth, try putting an infrared filter (available from military 
surplus, or from optical supply houses).

Here's some decoded patterns that you can use:

Torrance, California
    Standard large Radio Shack strobe lights are used. Moderately fast rate.
    *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *

Manhattan Beach,CA
   Flash-pairs in a 4:1 ratio, at a rate of 2 flash-pairs per second.
   * *       * *       * *       * *

VAX Hacking

VAX is an acronym for Virtual Address eXtension, meaning that it uses memory
addresses beyond the limit of its physical memory, allowing it to run 
programs that are too large to fit in its memory.  These are manufactured by
the DEC (Digital Equipment Corporation), and generally run an operating 
system called VMS (Virtual Memory System).  VMS uses a system called the DCL
processor, that lets you enter DCL programs, sort of like a DOS batch file,
or a UNIX shell script.

You can identify VAX systems, because all of them have the "Username:" and
"Password:" prompts as you log in.  Anything else is just extraneous, and 
helps you guess passwords.  There are some default logins built into VAX,
but most responsible sysops delete these accounts or change the passwords:

                       USERNAME              PASSWORD
                       --------              --------
                       DECNET                DECNET
                  *    SYSTEST               UETP
                                             SYSTEST
                       SYSTEM                SYSTEM
                       DEFAULT               DEFAULT
                  *    FIELD                 FIELD
                       OPERATIONS            OPERATIONS
                  *    SUPPORT               SUPPORT
                                             DEC
                       SYSTEST_CLIG          CLIG
                                             SYSTEST
                                             TEST

Accounts with asteriks next to them are VERY powerful, and good ones to 
crack.  

When you get the "$" prompt, there are hundreds of commands you can enter,
depending on the system.  Here's a few basic ones:

@ - Executes a DCL program format is @filename.com
ACCOUNTING - accounting program that charges users for their use of the sys.
CREATE - Pascal compiler.  Format is CREATE filename.pas
CREATE/DIR - creates a subdirectory like in UNIX or DOS
DEL - used to delete files.  Format is DEL filename.ext
DIR - displays a directory, like DIR in dos or ls in UNIX.  Adding the /FULL
      option gives you a full listing, with security info. and such, adding
      the /BRIEF option gives you a brief listing.  Wildcards can be used,
      with * to mean all, and % to mean anything matching one character.
      DIR *.* or DIR newuser%%.doc
EDIT - VMS editor.  Use VT220 terminal with this.
HELP - brings up a help program like what you're reading.
LOGOUT - logs you out of the system
MAIL - lets you send mail locally, and on any networks the system is on.
$PASSWORD - lets you change password.  Used: $PASSWORD mynewpass
PHONE - brings up a chat program that changes your prompt to "%".  Type in
        a user's name to talk to him.  If he is on a different node, type 
        his node name, two colons, and his username.
PHOTO - records session (like a capture)
RUN - executes executables.
SHOW -  With SHOW, you can look at a lot.  I am
        just  going to list a lot of things  you  can
        view and what it will show you.
        EX: SHOW USERS DAV

        CLUSTER    - VAX cluster if any
        DEFAULT    - Directory path and device
        DEVICES    - The system devices (drives,
                     etc.)
        INTRUSION - If any accounts are being
                    hacked
        MEMORY     - Memory of course
        NETWORK    - Network and the VAX's location
                     within
        PROCESS    - PROCESS ProcessName shows
                     status
        PROTECTION - Protection on files
        QUOTA      - Shows disk space allowed for
                     your account
        SYSTEM     - Miscellaneous system info
        DAY        - Day & date
        TIME       - Time
        USERS      - Users online all systems
TYPE - types a file out to your terminal (like the UNIX 'cat' command)

SET FILE/PROTECTION - The syntax for this is:
                      SET FILE/PROTECTION=OWNER[RWED] filename.ext
                      To set the Read, Write, Execute, and Delete flags for
                      a file's owner.  WORLD or GROUP can be substituted for
                      OWNER, to mean users in your world or group.  SYSTEM 
                      can be used for anyone that has SYSPRV privileges.
SET TERMINAL/WIDTH=80 - Sets width to 80 columns
SET TERMINAL/ADVANCED_VIDEO = Sets 124 X 24 lines
SET TERMINAL/ANSI_CRT = ANSI escape sequences
SET TERMINAL/AUTOBAUD = Possibly gets higher baud rate
SET TERMINAL/BROADCAST = Enable messages from SEND, MAIL & PHONE
SET TERMINAL/DEVICE_TYPE=VT220 - Sets terminal type to VT220
SET TERMINAL/ECHO = Enables echoing from DCL command line
SET TERMINAL/FULLDUP = Enables full duplex
SET TERMINAL/HANGUP = Causes account to log off if no carrier
SET TERMINAL/INQUIRE - Shows device_type of terminal
SET TERMINAL/PAGE=43 - Sets display length to 43 lines
SET TERMINAL/TYPE_AHEAD = Sets type ahead function on
SET TERMINAL/UNKNOWN - Used for ASCII device types
SET TERMINAL/WRAP = Used to set wrap around feature

    NOTE:
    All  of  the above denoted with a "=" rather than a  "-"  can  be
    changed  to  the opposite setting by placing a "NO"  directly  in
    front of the qualifiers.  EX: SET TERMINAL/NOECHO

There are other uses for the SET command that you can get with HELP, but 
these are the most common.

VAX systems also have some special filename extensions that you might want
to know to keep yourself out of trouble:

        ADA    Ada compiler source code file
        BAS    BASIC compiler source code file
        B32    BLISS-32 compiler source code file
        C      C compiler source code file

        HLP    Text for help libraries
        JOU    EDT editor journal when problems occur
        LIS    System listing file (as in TYPE, PRINT, & PHOTO)
        LOG    Batch job output file
        MAI    Mail message file
        MEM    DSR output file
        OBJ    Object code created by compiler before LINKing
        RNO    Source file for DSR
        SIXEL  Files for Sixel graphics
        SYS    System image file
        TJL    Journal created when the unusual occurs (DECNET a lot)
        TMP    Temporary file (sometimes valuable)
        TPU    Editor command file
        TXT    Text library input file (also MAIL output file)
        UAF    USER AUTHORIZATION FILE

Appendix B - Submitting articles to PfA

 If you have read PfA, and like what you see, perhaps you'd be interested
 in being published in our fine magazine?

 If so call The Escapade Macabre and leave feedback to Dr. Menace (NOT
 Angel of Death.) that contains the body of the article, the author, the
 date, and the title.  Most articles will be accepted as long as they are
 of the appropriate genre.  Thanx!

----------------------------------------

Appendix C - Receiving copies of PfA

 The best way to receive PfA is of course by modem.  However this is not
 possible for all people, and we were at PfA realize that.  Very soon,
 you will be able to send a couple bucks to our post office box and get
 very nice bound copies of the current PfA issue.  (It looks real good,
 printed on a BubbleJet Printer with high quality paper, then carefully
 photocopied, and stapled.)

 At some point, we do plan on making a special hardcopy edition of PfA,
 featuring bold, italics, and underlines, with different sized fonts,
 hand drawn pictures, and a magazine format (Like 2600 sorta.) and
 everything, but this is a long way off....
----------------------------------------

Appendix D - Contacting the Editors

 There are a few ways you can contact Angel of Death and I.  Here they
 are:

 1) BBS: The Escapade Macabre, (206)565-0786.  A WWiV BBS run by Dr.
 Menace and Angel of Death.  We can both be contacted their.

 2) Yaki-Net: If you are one of the few people who are on Yaki-Net, try
 E-Mailing Dr. Menace@2600, or Angel of Death@2600, from any Yaki-Net
 BBS.  Some Yaki-Net BBS's carry an PfA discussion area, too.

 3) Internet: We can also be reached by InterNet!  Dr. Menace is
 drmenace@hebron.connected.com, and Angel of Death is
 craig@hebron.connected.com.  I (Dr. Menace) am also on the Telnet
 Citadel BBS's as Dr. Menace, and Angel of Death is also on them as Net
 Prowler.

 4) IRC: We will soon host a ?regular? chat ...probably on
 Weekends.  We do not have this totally worked out yet, but the channel
 name will be "#PfAChat"...

 Any form of E-Mail is acceptable for submitting articles, just make
 sure you make you include the author, and subject of the article.

 Also, submissions may be posted in the "PfA Discussion" area of
 participating Yaki-Net BBS's.  (Please DO NOT post articles in the
 Hacking Discussion areas on Yaki-Net!!!)
----------------------------------------

Appendix E - Citing the Sources

 In short, we ain't gonna do it.  I've been through megs and megs...shit
 maybe gigs of text and sometimes have to extract information from
 memory and it would be totally impractical for me to try citing every
 source.  I will say though that useful info can be obtained from old
 BootLeggers and TAPs, Jolly Roger's Anarchist Cookbook, and
 LegalHi.Txt...
