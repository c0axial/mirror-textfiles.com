I. About The Front Cover

1. "3,142,522 COIN TELEPHONE HOUSING: Norris R. Hall and Richard K. 
Thompson, Jr., Indianapolis, Ind., assignors to Bell Telephone 
Laboratories, Incorporated, N.Y., a corporation of New York
Filed Dec. 18, 1962, Ser. No. 245,567 10 Claims.  (Cl. 312--199)"

The front cover depicts the housing of the 1A1, the first single slot 
payphone used in the Bell System. Note the large circular hole for the 
rotary dial. The patent for the housing itself was granted in May, 1964. 
The 1A1 was introduced in 1965 after seven years of development by Bell 
Labs and Western Electric. I found this patent by making a list of 
developer's names from articles in the Bell Laboratories Record.  I then 
looked for those names in many year's worth of the Index of Patents. See 
my article on patent searching for information on the different kinds of 
indexes.
2.	Want to know more about early payphones? Check out Stokes, R.R., "A 
Single-Slot Coin Telephone" Bell Laboratories Record  (January, 1966) 20 
and W. Pfred "A New Coin Telephone" Bell Laboratories Record  (December, 
1959) 464. Please note that the Record  is not  the same publication as 
the Bell System Technical Journal. The B.S.T.J. is widely available. It 
is dense, intimidating and hard to read. It is also indispensable. The 
Record, on the other hand, is user friendly. It is well illustrated and 
easy to read. It was published until 1984. Look for it. You'll find 
valuable background information on how the Bell System set up phone 
service for about 75% of America's  population. 

-----------------------------------------------
II. An Introduction

3.	Welcome to the fourth issue of private line. This is the first 
national edition! private line is an open, questioning forum about all 
things telephonic. It's written with the beginner in mind, but I hope 
that everyone can find something interesting here. Readers are 
encouraged to submit articles and to forward corrections. I pay with 
subscriptions. private line focuses on the technology of the information 
age, rather than on the personalities. How did all this get started? The  
magazine 2600 rekindled an interest in telephones that had laid dormant 
with me for over fifteen years. I read about blue boxing as a teenager 
but I didn't know anyone who did it. Many San Francisco Bay Area people 
were involved in hacking but there was no way to get in touch them. 
Everyone quoted in The San Francisco Chronicle used a fake name.  I 
experimented a little with coin first phones but that was by myself. I 
tried reading telephony books but they were very difficult to 
understand. I didn't apply myself and I eventually gave up. That was a  
mistake. I graduated from high school, went to work and got involved in 
other hobbies and pursuits. And then last year I saw a copy of 2600 for 
the first time.

4. What a revelation. I sent for back issues and got a look at what I 
had been missing. People were still experimenting with the telephone 
system and still having fun doing so. What's more, the technology of 
communications was rushing ahead at an incredible speed, producing more 
fascinating equipment that I could begin to understand. But I still 
didn't know the basics.  I hit several libraries and was discouraged to 
find that most of the books were as difficult as before. I resolved, 
however, to apply myself this time. I started taking notes since I learn 
better when I write things out. The first two issues of  private line 
were a result of that loose collection of notes. 

5. I could tell you more about the past but I want to write about the 
future. I look forward to sharing  what I learn about telephones and 
telecommunications.  I look forward to seeing anything you have to 
contribute. Maybe we can learn together.  Thank you!

III. Updates and Corrections

6.	I discussed California Penal Code Section 502.7 in the first issue. 
502.7 covers toll fraud. I had a question about subsection (3). It says 
that avoiding lawful charges "[b]y use of a code, prearranged scheme, or 
other similar stratagem or device whereby the person, in effect, sends 
or receives information" is illegal. I wasn't sure what this was about.  
I asked if anyone could give me an example of what the legislature 
meant. 

7.	Tom (8STRANO_T@spcvxa.spc.edu) clears this up nicely. He writes, 
"Perhaps they mean trying to avoid collect call charges.  For example, 
let's say I'm in Jersey City, and I want my mom, who lives in Bayonne, 
to pick me up to take me home.  I don't want to put $.20 in the phone to 
make a call, and I don't want her to get the collect call charge.  So, 
we prearrange this idea:  I'll call her collect, and when the operator 
asks who the call is from, I give a fake name that we have prearranged 
to mean that she should pick me up to drive me home.  Then my mom simply 
refuses the call, saying 'I don't know who that person is,' she hangs 
up, then goes to Jersey City to get me.  Neither my mom or I have been 
charged for the call, but the information was passed successfully. In 
real life, though, I'm not THAT cheap... I CAN spare 20 cents... I guess 
some people see small change in terms of cheap transistors and 
resistors.  But anyway, that what the law seems to mean."
	
8. I think Tom provided a good example. It takes on even more importance 
with new services such as 1-800-COLLECT. You can leave code names that 
stand for different things.  Biff Barker, for example, to stand for 
"Call me back." Interestingly, the technology is so good these days that 
phrases like "Call me back" or "My number is . . ." may result in an 
operator intercept if you try to record them. True, this process is a 
hassle and it takes a long time to do. But it is possible. I suppose 
they would charge you with that code section if you had, say, a thousand 
'800' calls from your residence that were never completed. And your long 
distance company does keep track of those calls . . .

9. In issue 3 I talked about a program that came from Thipdar's Custom 
Software. I said it hunted for modem tones. Not so. It's actually a 
normal scanning program. It notes modem tones but does not look for them 
exclusively.

A. Introduction

10.	Patent searching is a great way to find out about telephones. It's 
low cost and fascinating. Got a question about AT&T's True Voice? Tired 
of the hype? Read the patent instead.  Interested in pay phones? You'll 
find more information in  patents than from any other free, public 
source.  Need telecom clip art that's copyright free?  Patents provide. 
Too good to be true? Well, you must not expect too much. You will not 
find, for example, operating procedures like those in a manual. But you 
will find some detailed information that a manual may be based on. Using 
patents with other information will get you closer to the goal. You may 
find that patent searching becomes a compelling, hypnotic hobby. 

11.	A patent is a written document with illustrations. Hardcopy versions 
of the entire patent are only available at the Patent and Trademark 
Office in Washington, D.C. Patent and Trademark Depository Libraries or 
PTDL's have microfilm copies of those originals. See page 18 for a list. 
In addition, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office gopher has the texts 
of 1994 patents online. See the Quick Start Guide if you want to start 
looking at patents right now. For the rest of us, let's start the search 
process by looking at patent classification. . . (go to paragraph

A. Sidebar -- Quick Start Guide

The Conventional Approach

12. Go to a Patent and Trademark Deposit Libary listed on page 18.  Pull 
out the microfilm roll for any of the following patents.  Thread roll on 
viewer. Read  the patent.

a) 3,142,522 Payphone housing
b) 3,86,3036 Ground circuit
c) 4,310,726 Early 911 network
d) 4,924,496 COCOT info
e) 5,311,582 Current COCOT

The Internet

13. Do you have net access? Preferably an .edu account? Full text of all 
1994 patents were on line as of 12/01/94.  The Patent and Trademark 
office has a gopher.  It pulls files from a database at town.hall.org. 
True keyword searches of more than 90,000 documents are possible. You 
can enter phrases such as toll fraud, COCOT or  paystation and get a 
list of relevant patents. You can then select which patent you wish to 
view. Check out paragraph

B. Patent Numbering and Classification

14.	Each patent gets a permanent number once it's approved. These go in 
chronological order. You can get an idea, then, of an invention's age 
without looking up its patent. The payphone housing on the front cover, 
for example, has patent number 3,142,522. That dates back to mid-1964. 
The patent number for the 1994 COCOT we discuss later is 5,311,582. 
Tables exist that match dates to numbers. Two thousand patents on 
average get approved weekly. More than 5,000,000 patents have been 
assigned already. Organizing these patents is a major task.

15.	 All patents are first put into one of several hundred broad 
classes. Some examples are Class 119 for Animal Husbandry, Class 102 for 
Ammunition and Explosives and Class 380 for Cryptography. Most telephony 
related stuff is put into Class 379: Telephonic Communications. All 
classes, including 379, are broken down into subclasses.

16. Take a look at class 379 at the end of this file. See how everything 
is arranged? Every conceivable piece of telephone equipment gets a 
subclass number along with its class number.  Payphone patents start at 
subclass 143. So, the COCOT we'll talk about later has the reference 
number 379143. That patent deals with other subclasses as well. But 143 
is the one that that patent impacts most.

17.	The chief problem with subclasses is that the headings are non-
intuitive. That's because the descriptions use 'patenteese' and not 
telecom lingo. The Patent and Trademark Office defines these subclasses 
but you have to go to a PTDL to look up the vague descriptions. Who 
would describe, for example, a toll fraud prevention device with 
language like this: "189. Fraud or improper use mitigating or indication 
(e.g., 'blue box', 'black box'). Huh? This category is actually quite 
broad. It includes equipment that deals with fraudulent tones of all 
kinds. It may be a payphone that's designed to deal with red boxing, or 
it may involve central office equipment that's designed to detect blasts 
of 2600 Hz. Don't rule out a subclass because the wording of a heading 
doesn't match your search exactly. 

18.	Other classes contain other telephone related products. Not 
everything is in 379. Telephone booths are in Class 52. Coin collectors 
for pay stations go in Class 194. You can look up these related things 
with The Index to the U.S. Patent Classification System. I list it under 
resources at the end of this article. It is essential for anyone dealing 
with patents. Let's now look at the patent document itself. . .
(go to paragraph 20)


C. Sidebar -- A  Tale of Two Classes

19. 	Classifying telephone equipment used to be simpler. Telephony  
inventions were in another class altogether: Class 179: Telephony.  It 
had nice, friendly headings like 'Systems', 'Telephones', 'Switches', 
and 'Testing Devices.' It contained 190 subclasses. The breakup of the 
Bell System opened telecom to an avalanche of new products, inventors 
and companies. This diversity  of inventions caused the old class to 
collapse after only a year. In 1986, Class 379 was introduced to replace 
old 179. The amount of subclasses doubled. Simple headings were replaced 
by cryptic ones. Parenthetical statements were devised to explain the 
headings. Most don't work.  You may get a better understanding of the 
new class by photocopying the last revision of 179.  At the very least, 
you will need a copy of it to do a telephony search before December, 
1985.

D. The Patent Document

20.	Many, many parts make up a patent. I'll cover the main ones. The 
first part is the title. Something complex like, "An Integrated COCOT 
and Regulated Paystation Telephone System." Or, "Automatic Telephone 
Answering System Using a Single-Tone Signal For Various Operations." 
Only rarely will you see a simple title like "Modem With Call Waiting." 
The first title is about a payphone that can be a  COCOT or a telco 
payphone. Two in one. What's more, the phone can be dialed up and set 
into either mode with just a few commands. It takes some reading to make 
sense out of these titles. Your best bet may be to always look up a 
patent that has the right class and subclass number, despite what the 
title says.

21.	The second interesting part of the patent is its bibliography. It 
gives you clue after clue about the invention as well as the entire 
field that it belongs in. You'll quickly learn the companies, people, 
documents and patents that are important. Use any large libary with 
business directories to get names, addresses and phone numbers.

22.	The third important part of the patent is the abstract. It is a 
legalistic summary of the invention. The abstract is the most widely 
accessible part of the patent. That's because each new patent has its 
abstract printed in the Official Gazette, a weekly publication of the 
Patent and Trademark Office. Hundreds of libraries carry it as well as 
some companies. You can look up the abstract in the Gazette, even if you 
don't have access to a Patent and Trademark Deposit Libary. An entry in 
the Gazette also gives you the patent's number, its title and an 
illustration. Correctly interpreting abstracts saves you time. Certain 
abstracts grab your attention. In those cases, you know immediately that 
a patent is worth the time and effort  to get to a Patent and Trademark 
Deposit Libary to look it up.  Many abstracts, though, leave you 
wondering. Relating an abstract to its patent is a matter of practice 
through more reading.

23.	The background of the invention is the most engaging part of the 
patent for general readers. It gives you a technological summary of the 
subject involved. For example, a patent about telephone handsets will  
contain a  background that summarizes handset history and operation. 
I've reprinted the background of the COCOT patent on page 10 to give you 
a good idea of what they contain. This short summary is a great 
introduction to pay phone operation

24.	The summary of the invention tells you how the invention works in 
fairly non-technical terms. It also provides good details about how the 
invention relates to other things in its field. The COCOT we discuss, 
for example, has a specific procedure to deal with credit cards. The 
summary gives details of calling card principles in order to relate the 
invention's claims to everyday practice. I reprint the COCOT summary on 
page 10 as well.

25.	The body of the text provides the nitty gritty details. It is the 
longest part of the document. The text is always linked to 
illustrations. It is next to impossible to figure out a patent without 
seeing the whole thing. Here's one quotation that shows you the problem. 
Each number represents a diagram or a part of diagram:

 "Assuming the voice message system is collect/return, control 
relay 93 is provided in co-pending application Ser. No. 
07/740,576 incorporated by reference above. The coin refund 
inhibit relay 73, coupled in series between the collect/return 
relay 93 and the coin relay 100, includes a pair of control 
windings 75, 76. One end of  each of windings 75, 76 is coupled 
in common to receive a coil energizing voltage. The other ends 
of control windings 75, 76 are respectively coupled to receive 
"relay off" and "relay on" signals from the  microprocessor 45, 
to delineate the position of switch 74 in series with the coin 
relay 100. As shown in FIG. 5, switch 74 is closed so as to 
complete the circuit between the collect/return control relay 
93 and coin relay 100 allowing for a firing of the coin relay 
100. If the microprocessor 45, however, issues a relay off 
signal, then the switch 74 opens (as noted by the phantom line) 
to turn off the coin relay 100.  .   ."

You can tell that the body provides enough information to do some 
serious reverse engineering. I hope this article persuades you to visit 
a Patent and Trademark Deposit Libary so that you can look at what is 
available. Or at least to look up a few abstracts at your local libary. 
Let's now turn to the search process itself.
F. The Search Process
26.	Go to the nearest patent and trademark deposit libary if you are 
impatient and you know what patent you want to look at.  These are the 
only places that have the complete, illustrated patent on microfilm.  
Not sure what to look for? Then you have to choose a subclass to 
investigate. Let's say you've picked subclass 189, the one about 
detecting toll fraud. What then? Well, again, the easiest answer is to 
tell you to get to a Patent  and Trademark Deposit Libary. It has the 
most tools and you'll waste the least time. But I can make a case for 
not going to the PTDL first, even if you have one near you. 
27.	PTDL's can be intense, intimidating and somewhat crowded. Why not 
start with a lower key setting first? I'd recommend a beginner go to a 
state college or university that carries the Official Gazette. You'll 
usually find it in the Government Documents section. Such a libary will 
have some supporting materials as well. You can get familiar with patent 
publications and the microfilm reader there, rather than at a PTDL. 
Let's go through an example of using a libary that has just the Gazette.
28.	Okay, you're now in the Patent section at your libary. Find the 
Manual of Classification. It's in two loose leaf binders. This is your 
key to the whole classification system. It's a compilation of all the 
different patent classes. You'll find Class 379 in there along with 
everything else. No pictures but very compelling. All of technology is 
categorized in one work. A libary may keep only the current  Manual in 
the Government Document section; older ones may be kept out in the open 
stacks.
29. 	Let's say you're sticking with  subclass  189 in telephonic 
communications. You need to make a list of the recent patents in that 
field.  How? Look for the Index of Patents Issued From The United States 
Patent and Trademark Office. A long title for some small books. You'll 
find them near the Manual. The Index of Patents is put out every year in 
two parts.  Stronger libraries have more back issues.
30.	The first part of the Index of Patents lists patent holders by name. 
Organizations such as Bell Laboratories, Protel and Motorola are listed 
by name as well. Next to the patent holder's name is the class and 
subclass number of their invention. But no description of the invention 
is given. A more useful tool is the second part. It lists patents by 
Class and subclass.  What it calls subjects. A list of all patents 
issued in the last ten years may take only a few minutes  to look up if 
you have a quiet subclass.  Classes like 149, "Post pay coin 
collection", however, may not have had a single patent issued as far 
back as you can search. Don't be discouraged. Developers may be 
producing equipment in your field but they may not have decided to go 
through the patent process. Remember, too, that Class 379 changed in 
1985.

31.	Well, now you have a list of patent numbers in your subclass. The 
next step is to look up their abstracts in the Official Gazette. You'll 
want to see if it's worth it to look up the entire patent at a PTDL. 
Smaller libraries take the Gazette on microfiche or microfilm. 
Microfiche is easier to use since you don't have to thread a machine. 
The disadvantage is that the image produced on the reader is smaller 
than that with microfilm. A small paper envelope holds each issue of the 
Gazette on fiche. A single issue may consist of 10 or 15 individual 
pieces of film.  The issues themselves are arranged by date and patent 
numbers in a file cabinet with shallow, wide trays. Class 379 is usually 
2/3d's of the way back in the packet. It's a laborious process to look 
up several abstracts but it's okay to look up a few. And you'll get 
motivated to get to the PTDL where the hardcopy volumes are.

32.	Microfilm is a different story. Looking up several abstracts is very 
time consuming.  Threading the film onto the microfilm reader takes 
time, patience and practice. Don't be afraid to ask for help. I've had 
librarians admit that they have problems threading the machines. I do 
most of my film reading on the microfilm readers that double as copiers. 
These machines tend to be in good repair since they make money. It is 
really silly to thread up a conventional reader, only to have to thread 
another machine to make a copy when you see what you want. Looking up 
abstracts this way gives you an insight into the patent process and 
gives you practice for the PTDL. Patents are on 16mm film but it threads 
the same as the larger film of the Gazette. Let's now look at what the 
Patent and Trademark Deposit Libary has to offer.

33.	A few PTDL's have every patent ever issued on microfilm. Most don't. 
Much of what we are interested in, though, goes back no more than 30 
years. Every PTDL should have at least that many patents on file. Start 
viewing the patents on your list in case you want to get going. You'll 
see shelf after shelf with thousands of small boxes of microfilm. Most 
PTDL's allow you to grab the roll yourself and start threading. You'll 
also see the Gazette in hardcopy.  You'll appreciate immediately how 
much faster it is to search those instead of looking at film versions of 
the Gazette. Speaking of speed, every PTDL has a CD ROM machine that's 
great for doing recent patent research. It's called CASSIS.

34.	CASSIS stands for Classification and Search Support Information 
System.  Arrgh. It's a collection of CD's that allow you to look at 
patent titles back to 1969 and abstracts back to 1988. In addition, it 
allows you to do key word searches of the entire classification system. 
You can put in words like telephone pole, toll fraud or payphone 
housing, for example, and it will tell you what class those inventions 
are in. It's a cross reference, in other words, to the massive Manual of 
Classification that I mentioned previously. This keyword searching, 
however, can be done with the  hardcopy Index to The U.S. Patent 
Classification System. CASSIS is nice but you can do without it if you 
are looking up a specific class and subclass. 

35.	One tool I haven't used is the Automated Patent System or APS. 
That's the main Patent and Trademark database. You can access it from at 
least thirteen PTDL's across the country. I list those with a small 
diamond on the opposite page.  This database has the full text of all 
patents back to 1971! This is, I think, the same database that DIALOG 
accesses for their patent information. The nearest  APS equipped libary 
to me is in Los Angeles, never-the-less, I will check it out the next 
time I go and report on how it works. I'm looking forward to using it.  
For right now, I'm pulling a list of patents in the conventional way. 

36.	You can run into quirks at the PTDL. Take a lot of change for the 
copy machines. Don't assume that there will be a change machine. 
Speaking of copy machines, you may be surprised at what you find. The 
Sacramento PTDL has some from the late 1960's. These things spit out 
copies with wet ink on blue print like paper. I'm not kidding. I have to 
hang the copies on the tops of chairs to dry them off. The quality of 
these copies is terrible. There is no way that you could use them for 
OCR work. The illustrations on these pages took quite a bit of work with 
my scanner to clean up. Some of them started as out as photocopies of 
abstracts from the Gazette and not from the patent itself. It was easier 
to get a good illustration that way instead of chasing pixels for hours. 
There is hope, though, even for this problem. The Patent Office will 
send you a clean copy of any patent for three dollars. See the section 
below for details. Good luck with your searching and tell me about any 
interesting patents you find.

G. TOOLS AND RESOURCES

The Internet

37.	The quickest way to look at patent information is to use the 
Internet. It is also a confusing way. The 1994 APS or Automated Patent  
System database has over 90,000 patents online. The easiest way to use 
it is through the United States Patent and Trademark Office gopher. This 
gopher seems poorly supported. I managed to connect to it through my 
Delphi account for the first time as this goes to print. I simply did a 
search of directories in gopher space using VERONICA. I chose the 
VERONICA at SCS Nevada. I keyed in the word patent. Several screens of 
information came back. I picked one choice labeled U.S. Patent and 
Trademark Office. It lead into the same menu that I had seen before with 
an .edu account. All of my previous attempts through Delphi did not 
connect. Keep at it. I wanted to make sure that a gopher was available 
because it is the simplest service for most people to use. The more 
technically proficient can use the following information. I've also 
included what town.hall.org says about connecting with FTP directly. 
Here's what you'll see if you connect to the PTO gopher:

Modem --

39.	The PTO BBS can be dialed directly. It's at (703) 305-8950. It goes 
up to 9600. No account is necessary to access this information. It's a 
useful bulletin board and you can download the contents of the current 
Gazette. I'd recommend that you take a half hour or so and cruise around 
in it.

Hardcopy Stuff --

40.	Patent Copies  You can get a copy of any patent for $3.00 from the 
Patent and Trademark Office. That's a great bargain. It doesn't matter 
how long the patent is either, all patents are three bucks. There is one 
drawback -- getting your copies take four to six weeks. Still, this is 
the best choice for many people. You could do your searching in the 
Gazette  and then order promising copies by mail. It's also a cheaper 
process than making copies at a PTDL when you have a long document to 
get. The Patent Office told me that  all copies come on plain paper. So, 
they should work fine for scanning or OCR work. Send a check or money 
order to:

Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks 
Box 9, Washington, DC  20231 

41. More information? Call (703) 305-4350. All they need is your money 
and a list of patent numbers. Nothing else. There's no form required. 
I'm ordering a few patents to see what they look like. Can you imagine 
the possibilities? A CD ROM designer could put, say, 30 cell phone 
patents on a single disc. Text and pictures together. (By the way, all 
the information is public domain and copyright free.) Or, you could put 
all COCOT info on one CD. Let me know if you do this -- I'll let you 
advertise for free in private line if you price them at an affordable 
level. Your editor will, of course, need a copy of each one for 
review. . . 

Magazines  

42. The most relevant magazine about patents for us is Inventor's 
Digest. It's for the independent inventor and it has lots of interesting 
information. It's ISSN number is 0883-9859. They're distributed by Fine 
Print Distributors. Or call them at (719) 635-1916. Only four dollars a 
copy.

Books 

43. Most books on patents become outdated quickly. None deal with 
telephones exclusively. Never-the-less, here are a few that I think are 
worth a look:

I. Background and Summary of the Invention on Patent 5,311,582
	
	Bacground of the Invention

	Presently, paystation telephone systems are manufactured and produced 
to operate in a regulated line or coin line environment or in a 
customer owned, coin operated telephone (COCOT) environment. 
Paystations operable in the coin line mode are generally controlled via 
a central office through the use of the telephone line ring/tip pair 
and a ground line. The Bell Operating companies are examples of a 
regulated system which control numerous paystations through out the 
United States. In contrast, the COCOT systems are produced for 
individual owners who maintain, service and operate the COCOT 
paystations as a business for profit. COCOT paystations include a 
microprocessor providing the intelligence to operate the paystation. 
Programs are stored in the microprocessor's memory for carrying out the 
features of the paystation. However, once conventional COCOT telephones 
are installed in the field, the owner can not change any functional 
operations of the paystation but rather can only affect certain 
paystation characteristics such as calling rates, etc.

	Because each system is controlled differently, vendors supplying 
paystations to regulated companies and individual customers currently 
produce either two separate paystation units or a single unit which 
requires the removal and insertion of circuit cards in order to change 
the operation from a coin line telephone to a COCOT telephone. The use 
of two different paystations has the disadvantages of not allowing the 
paystations to be interchanged and increases a manufacturers overall 
cost due to the necessity of carrying two distinct product lines. These 
problems arise because each system is controlled differently -- coin 
line systems by a central office and COCOT systems by the paystation 
itself. It has heretofore been unable for vendors to integrate such 
systems due to their individual control and operating characteristics. 
For example, the paystation telephone must operate differently to carry 
out such features as voice messaging, charging for incoming calls, coin 
tone fraud prevention, safety checks, coin disposal (how the paystation 
collects and refunds), dialing sequence (whether the paystation passes 
the digits dialed directly to the telephone line or buffers the digits 
and then sends them to the telephone line), voice prompts (where the 
paystation voices a message to the paystation user), and the like, when 
controlled via the central office in the regulated system or when 
controlled via the microprocessor contained with the paystation in a 
COCOT system. There is therefore needed a paystation telephone 

system that integrates both a COCOT and a coin line system, without 
requiring hardware modifications, and provides a wide range of 
paystation features operable in either mode.

  Summary of the Invention

	In accordance with the present invention, the above-mentioned needs 
are met by an integrated COCOT and regulated paystation telephone 
system which  permits the functionality or features of the paystation 
to be remotely programmed, in order to increase the versatility of the 
paystation in either mode of operation. The features can thus be 
selectively enabled or disabled when the paystation is connected to 
either a regulated line or a business line. 
	
	Pursuant to the invention, the integrated paystation telephone system 
includes a central microprocessor coupled with an external  RAM memory 
that stores the firm ware for operating the paystation telephone. Novel 
circuitry is provided under the control of the microprocessor to 
operate such functions as the power control and coin relay (the relay 
which excepts or refunds a deposited coin) in either mode of operation. 
A more detailed description of the power control and coin relay 
circuitry is provided in co-pending application Ser. No. 07/740,576, 
filed on even date herewith and entitled "Circuit for Firing Paystation 
Coin Relay Using Power Derived From Telephone Tip/Ring Voltage, the 
specification of which is herein incorporated by reference. Further, 
call progress or answer supervision circuitry is provided to enhance 
the availability of other paystation telephone features according to 
the present invention. The call progress circuitry is described in 
greater detail in co-pending application Ser. No. 07/745,594, filed on 
even date herewith and entitled "Answer Supervision Circuit For 
Paystation Telephone With Non Mute Microphone", the specification of 
which is herein incorporated by reference.

	It is a advantage of the integrated COCOT and regulated paystation 
telephone system of the present invention to be remotely configured to 
operate in either a COCOT or coin line mode without requiring any 
hardware changes. This is accomplished via the microprocessor reading a 
status bit set in the firmware downloaded into the external RAM memory 
to determine its mode of operation. 	The paystation telephone system of 
the present invention further allows for voice messaging
systems to be implemented for both coin line and COCOT operation. For 
coin line operation, a microprocessor open circuits the coin relay such 
that the central office signal refunding a caller's coin is inhibited. 
This allows the voice message system to operate. The deposited coin is 
then collected after the caller leaves his voice message and the phone 
line is released.

	Another novel feature of the integrated paystation telephone system is 
its operability to detect coin tone fraud via filters provided in the 
call progress circuitry.  The microprocessor controls the filters such 
that they detect when coin tones are being generated from the handset 
microphone and, in response thereto, mutes the handset microphone so as 
to disrupt the coin tone generation.

	Still another advantage of the present invention is the provision of a 
safety program which detects if the paystation housing case is properly 
grounded so as to avoid shocks to a caller resulting from an accidental 
charging of the paystation housing case via an AC line. The 
microprocessor operates to read a case ground sensor signal indicating 
whether the case is grounded and to report the results thereof.

	Yet another advantage of the present invention is its operability to 
determine the actual connect time between the calling and called 
parties in order to determine whether overtime charges should be 
applied for local calls. The call progress circuitry indicates when the 
called party actually answers the phone which signals the 
microprocessor to begin a local overtime timer set to a pre determined 
time stored in the external memory. Once the timer expires, the 
microprocessor generates a voice signal requesting  further money to 
continue the call. Use of the actual connect time is an advantage over 
the prior devices which normally begin timing after a pre-set delay 
period once the call is made, e.g. 15-20 seconds. The present invention 
provides for a more accurate timing of the conversation based on the 
actual connect time.
    
 	Another advantage of the present invention is its operability to 
prohibit long distance or `one-plus` telephone calls when the cash box, 
which receives the deposited coins, is stolen or otherwise missing. The 
microprocessor is controlled via a program to read a cash box sensor to 
determine its presence. If the sensor indicates the cash box is 
missing, the microprocessor prohibits any coin tones from being output 
over the phone line thus eliminating long distance phone call 
capability in a regulated system. Furthermore, for local calls, the 
microprocessor can keep open a circuit path from the telephone line tip 
to ground such that the central office will not detect that the initial 
calling rate, i.e. the amount of money to be charged for the call, for 
a local call has been met. Hence, the central office will not allow a 
local call.      
          
	Still yet another advantage of the present invention is the provision 
for the paystation telephone system to accept any type of credit or 
bank card to be used for placing calling or credit card calls, 
otherwise referred to as `zero-plus` calls. Whereas currently regulated 
lines, such as the Bell operating companies, only allow use of their 
own or related calling cards, the present invention provides a program 
for the microprocessor to store a credit card number input by the 
caller for comparison with stored credit card numbers which have been 
approved for use by the particular paystation. These numbers can be 
continuously changed via the down-loading feature into the external RAM 
memory.

Other objects, advantages and novel features of the present invention 
will become apparent from the following detailed description of the  
invention when considered in conjunction with the accompanying  
drawings. . . <End of Summary>

private line talks with Chris Hall . . . 


NOTE: Chris Hall helped give a great talk at Def Con about electronic 
security. He'll be a regular contributor to private line on a number of 
subjects. This e-mail interview is about telephone security. My 
questions are in italics.

TF: It seems there are three ways to monitor a telephone conversation: a 
"hardwired" wiretap, an electronic bug or transmitter and REMOBS or 
Remote Observation. Any others?

CH: A  body wire but that only gets one side of the conversation. And a  
beige box or a lineman's handset, which is a kind of remote observation.

TF: What constitutes a wiretap? 

CH: Any unauthorized ( by the tap-ee) monitoring of your telephone 
communications or room conversation.

TF:  Do you come across many? 

CH: In my years in the industry I have seen the number of discovered taps 
increase by at least 60% in just the past five years.  Mostly in 
industry -- high-tech, bio-tech, etc.

TF: A wiretap, to me, conjures up visions of policemen huddled in a 
rented room, bent over a tape recorder. Perhaps across the street from 
the observed site. Is this accurate or do they just leave the tape 
recorder in place and change the tapes when needed?

CH: Police or Federal wiretaps usually are REMOBS ( Remote Observation
Posts ) and can be several miles away.  Most are usually unmanned and 
recorded on digital tape or digitized and stored on disk for later analysis.  
Most authorized taps are done at the central office, and routed to the 
REMOB point where it can be either manned ( if a sensitive operation is 
on-going) or unmanned.  It's kind of like modern surveillance for the 
PI.  You used to be stuck in the back of a windowless van for hours on 
end waiting for activity to video tape.  Now, with technology, I can use 
a rented car, park it across from the subject location, use a pin-hole 
camera shot through mylar in the turn signal, control it via radio with 
a DTMF pad (pan, tilt, zoom), and have it transmit through a video 
repeater and watch or record it miles away in my office or hotel room
 ( if out of town ) while eating a pizza and watching "Party of Five" on 
the other TV.  The technology today is phenomenal.
 
TF: Can you detect a wiretap if it is off site?

CH: Central office taps are nearly impossible to detect.  Especially if it 
is an authorized tap.  About the only way you will find out is when they 
produce the transcript at the trial.

TF: Can you detect it if it is on site?

CH: Almost all taps on-site can be detected by a competent electronic 
countermeasures technician.  Most ECM techs are sloppy.
 
TF: Let's talk specifics. Doesn't any device working off of line power 
affect the electrical status of the line? Can't this change be detected?

CH: Yes, if it is using line power.  There are several crystal controlled 
transmitter kits that work off of a battery and are very high impedance.  
I have seen these used in training sessions and the telco people miss 
them in a sweep of the line.  If a knowledgeable amateur places them 
correctly, it is very difficult to locate them with line sweep gear.

TF: Ever run across any police wiretaps in your investigations? What 
happened?

CH: Most wire taps we run across are either amateur or what we call 
"wildcat" taps.  A wildcat tap is an unauthorized tap usually performed 
by law enforcement to gain intelligence information.  They then use the 
intel to build a case or to develop snitches.  We have run across a few 
wildcat taps in our work and the resultant contact was not pleasant.

TF: Describe a typical bug.

CH: Typical bug is a crystal controlled FM transmitter with an electret mic 
attached directly to it or remoted via thin wire to the target listening 
position.  With surface mount technology they can be quite small and 
powerful.
 
TF: Do most use line power or batteries?

CH: Cheap garbage uses line power, most higher end use batteries, high-
high end use external exciter like microwave energy and the like.

TF: You talked about the cheaper bugs at Def Con. These seem to be the 
ones offered in catalogs, the so called "free oscillating types" that 
use the VHF band. Correct?
	
CH: Those are the ones. They are garbage.  Most operate on Wide FM just 
outside the standard FM radio band, are low powered and very frequency 
unstable.  We use them in training, however, at the basic level.

TF: Do you see any of them in use or is this strictly low budget?

CH: Seventh graders bugging their sister's room, disgruntled employees 
bugging the bosses office, that's about the extent of it.  Don't see any 
in industrial espionage, but that doesn't mean we don't look for them 

TF: Describe the difference between those bugs and the crystal 
controlled ones.

CH: Crystal controlled use far more transistors and, of course, a 
crystal for stability and power.  Most are battery powered and hide in 
"nestled" frequencies near active services.  All I know of are FM.
 
TF: What freqs do these bugs use?

CH:I have seen Low VHF, High VHF (old fed stuff is near wireless mic 
frequencies, new stuff is frequency hopping or spread spectrum).  Some 
UHF,  but not too many.  Highest is usually near Military aero at around 
300 MHz.
 
TF: What do they cost?

CH: From $50 to $200 in kit form.

TF: What's involved in a sweep? Walking around with a frequency counter?
	
CH: That's part of it, but it is much more extensive than that. Physical 
search is the most important. That means opening every electrical 
outlet, switch, light bulb base, etc., followed by an RF search over 
time with a sub-audible marker tone, spectrum analysis looking for 
anything that doesn't "belong", then a non-linear junction detector 
sweep, plus some other methods (especially for fiber optics) that we 
don't discuss. 

TF: What is a "non linear junction sweep"?

CH: Basically a device that detects semi-conductors including surface 
mount components (transistors), etc.  It is useful when sweeping a wall 
and you can't tear off all of the drywall, but you want to be sure 
nothing is behind it.

TF: Ever find any decoy bugs? That is, do people ever plant one that is 
easy to find and leave behind another?

CH: Very common, in fact, that is a good way to test a prospective 
electronic counter-measures service provider. Do it yourself.

TF: Ever find a transmitter but not find who did it?

CH: Most of the time, unless we have good background or advance 
intelligence.  There are signatures in the business , however, that 
point fingers.  It is a craft.

TF: What's the range on a good transmitter?

CH: In training I have seen up to four blocks on a battery powered telco 
transmitter correctly placed, and with good receiving equipment.  Kind 
of like using a cordless phone.

TF: What's the neatest technical installation you've seen?

CH: Hard wire burst transmitter.  They used a trace repair pen after 
placing the microphone to draw the leads for the mic to the transmitter, 
then painted over it.  The transmitter used a chip to store information 
and then it transmitted it in "blips" which made it hard to detect.  

TF: Any funny war story you can share?

CH: Not really funny but a client's employee kept getting a signal from 
near a light switch at a clients residence on top of a hill.  The hill 
above was a congested radio repeater site, and the employee called us 
only after he had destroyed all the wallboard surrounding the light 
switch looking for the "bug".  We found it was only a radio reflection 
off of the metal cornering they use on drywall interiors from a 50,000 
watt radio station.  We got all their business after that incident.

TF: Find many bosses syping on employees? How far do they go?

CH: We don't really run across this much since it is usually the boss 
that hires us.  Have heard of it though.  Lots of companies monitor and 
record fax traffic now.  How far they can go depends on what kind of 
form you signed at the time of  your employment.  I have heard of them 
going as far as they could, till they got caught.

TF: How are faxes and data transmissions intercepted?

CH: Usually logged, recorded and stored on a PC, then later analyzed 
with software.

TF: Many offices use all digital PBX's. How does this affect monitoring 
when you have a digital signal? More expensive equipment needed?

CH: It's more expensive to monitor at the switch, but not at the 
individual telephone.  PBX people, though, are a weak link. They're low 
paid and ripe for social engineering.  It is a weak area we analyze for 
our clients.

TF: Ever hear of someone tapping an optic fiber line? Does the test 
equipment for it allow a person to do such a thing?

CH: It's available now, and I have heard from very reliable sources that 
there is a method that doesn't even involve a physical tap of the 
line but it's mega expensive and although not classified, it's reserved 
for the government types.

TF: What do you think of Zimmerman's effort to build a secure phone 
based on PGP?

CH: I'd love to buy a license and distribute it !  I'm waiting and 
watching. Like everyone else.

TF: Are scramblers silly?

CH: Cheap inversion scramblers are silly, STU phones and DES 3 are still 
useful.  I use a transcrypt digital unit on my cell phone.  All of the 
radios we use for our executive protection details are scrambled at a 
high level. 

TF: What is a transcrypt digital unit?

CH:Transcrypt International makes a surface mount board that mounts  
inside a Motorola flip phone and mates to a Motorola supplied connector.  
To activate it, you simply press two digits on the keypad of the flip 
phone, and your voice is digitally encrypted and then decrypted at the 
other end by a Transcrypt hardwire phone, or another cell phone with 
compatible code and unit.  There is something like four trillion code 
combinations to encrypt with. Those are programmed in by the dealer.  It 
is a slick unit and we use them extensively.  It is digitally controlled 
analog encryption and the voice channel sounds like static mixed with 
modem tones.

TF: Is it possible to tap a line without making a physical connection? 
That is, can you do it by induction? Like  a pickup microphone on a 
guitar?

CH: Sure, all rules of electronics apply.  You would probably have to 
amplify it and send it down another pair or via RF for any kind of 
distance.

VI FEDERAL TOLL FRAUD LAW

I discussed California Penal Code $502.7 in the first issue. It 
prohibits both credit card fraud and electronic devices used to commit 
toll fraud. 18 U.S.C. 1029 is the rough federal equivalent. It does not, 
however, contain any specific language prohibiting electronic tone 
generators like rainbow boxes, red boxes or blue boxes. It is, instead, 
almost exclusively concerned with stolen codes and account numbers.  The 
only electronic device it seems to prohibit are cloned cellular phones. 
You may have wondered what gets the Secret Service involved with toll 
fraud -- this law answers that question.  Here is the full text of Title 
18 United States Code section 1029 as I went to print in November, 1994. 
The digital telephony bill has since amended it. Those amendments will 
be in issue number 6 that comes out in May, 1995. My comments are in 
contained within asterisks.

$1029. Fraud and related activity in connection with access devices

(a) Whoever --
		(1) knowingly and with intent to defraud produces, uses, or traffics 
in one or more counterfeit access devices;
		(2) knowingly and with intent to defraud traffics in or uses one or 
more unauthorized access devices during any one-year period, and by such 
conducts obtains anything of value aggregating $1,000 or more during 
that period;
		(3) knowingly and with intent to defraud possesses fifteen or more 
devices which are counterfeit or unauthorized access devices; or
		(4) knowingly, and with intent to defraud, produces, traffics in, has 
control or custody of, or possesses device making equipment; shall, if 
the offense affects interstate or foreign commerce, be punished as 
provided in subsection (c) of this section.

*An access device is vaguely defined in section (e) later on. For now, 
think of an access device as any stolen code, stolen credit card or 
stolen telephone calling card. Any 'device' (a legal word of art)  used 
to access someone else's account. You must run up a $1,000 bill before 
the Feds can come in. In reality, the government  may not act at that 
level because of their caseload. You never know. They also have to 
connect you to the calls and the calls must cross state lines.*

	(b)(1) Whoever attempts to commit an offense under subsection (a) of 
this section shall be punished as provided in subsection (c) of this 
section.
		(2) Whoever is a party to a conspiracy of two or more persons to 
commit an offense under subsection (a) of this section, if any of the 
parties engage in any conduct in furtherance of such offense, shall be 
fined an amount not greater than the amount provided as the maximum fine 
for such offense under subsection (c) of this section or imprisoned not 
longer than one--half of the period provided as the maximum imprisonment 
for such offense under subsection (c) of this section, or both.

	(c) The punishment for an offense under subsection (a) or (b)(1) of 
this section is --
		(1) a fine of not more than the greater of $10,000 or twice the value 
obtained by the offense or imprisonment for not more than ten years, or 
both, in the case of an offense under subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3) of 
this section which does not occur after a conviction for another offense 
under either subsection, or an attempt to commit an offense punishable 
under this paragraph;
		(2) a fine of not more than the greater of $50,000 or twice the value 
obtained by the offense or imprisonment for not more than fifteen years, 
or both, in the case of a subsection (a)(1) or (a)(4) of this section 
which does not occur after a conviction for another offense under either 
such subsection, or an attempt to commit an offense punishable under 
this paragraph; and
		(3) a fine of not more than the greater of $100,000 or twice the value 
obtained by the offense or imprisonment for not more than twenty years, 
or both, in the case of an offense under subsection (a) which occurs 
after a  conviction for another offense under this subsection, or an 
attempt to commit an offense punishable under this paragraph.

	(d) The United States Secret Service shall, in addition to any other 
agency having such authority, have the authority to investigate an 
offense under this section. Such authority of the United States Secret 
Service shall be exercised in accordance with an agreement which shall 
be entered into by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney 
General.

	*The Secret Service was first set up to fight counterfeiting during 
Lincoln's time. They've had different duties through the years but they 
are still used as the shock troops in many fraud related cases.* 

(e) As used in this section - -

	(1) the term "access device" means any card, plate, code, account 
number, or other means of account access that can be used, alone or in 
conjunction with another access device to obtain money, goods, services, 
or any other thing of value, or that can be used to initiate a transfer 
of funds (other than a transfer originated solely by paper instrument);
	(2) the term "counterfeit access device" means any access device that 
is counterfeit, fictitious, altered, or forged, or an identifiable 
component of an access device or a counterfeit access device:
	(3) the term "unauthorized access device" means any access device that 
is lost, stolen, expired, revoked, canceled, or obtained with intent to 
defraud;
	(4) the term "produce" includes design, alter, authenticate, duplicate 
or assemble;
	(5) the term "traffic" means transfer, or otherwise dispose of, to 
another, or impression designed or primarily used for making an access 
device or a counterfeit access device.
	(6) the term "device-making equipment" means any equipment, mechanism, 
or impression designed or primarily used for making an access device or 
a counterfeit access device.
	
*Does the definition of an access device include electronic tone 
generators? Bruce Sterling, author of  The Hacker Crackdown thought so. 
He wrote that "[s]tandard phreaking devices, such as blue boxes, used to 
steal phone service from old fashioned mechanical switches are 
unquestionably "counterfeit access devices." Redboxes  might be 
questionable as well. Sterling, though, wrote his comments in 1991, two 
years before the Brady case was decided. 

	In US v Brady, 820 F.Supp. 346 (D. Utah 1993), aff'd 13F3d 334 a man 
was accused of using and selling altered cellular phones in violation of 
section 1029. Brady set up his phones to tumble calls. Tumbling confuses 
a switch. It allows a call to be made without a bill to an account. The 
government contended that his phones accessed the accounts of the telco 
itself and hence constituted an access device. The court disagreed The 
court held that since his tumbled calls did not access a subscriber 
account they were not an access device within the meaning of  section 
1029. They did state that he would have violated section 1029 if he had 
cloned his  phones. Cloned phones do access at least two accounts. The 
telco did keep an accounting of lost calls caused by tumbling. But that 
is not the same as an account itself. Lost blue box and red box calls 
are also kept track of  when and if discovered. The court, in fact, 
specifically mentioned blue boxes in their decision. In so doing they 
gave us all a lot more hope that the Secret Service will not kick in our 
doors looking for tone generators:

			"The Government maintains that the charges for 'unmatched' calls 
handled as thus described represent a "direct accounting loss" to 
Cellular One within the meaning of section 1029 as construed in McNutt. 
In effect, the Government argues that access to the cellular carrier's 
system translates into access to the carrrier's own accounts through 
which the cost of system usage is allocated within and between carriers. 
	Yet the same reasoning would seem to apply to use of the older, less 
sophisticated "blue boxes" used to gain access to the long distance 
telephone system. A so called 'blue box' uses no account number or 
access code at all; it emits a 2600Hz tone which permitted the user to 
'free ride,' to gain access to the system and place long distance calls 
which were not charged to any customer account [footnote deleted] See, 
e.g., United States v. Foster, 580 F.2d 388 (10th Cir.1978); United 
States v. Patterson, 528 F.2d 1037 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 
942, 97 S.Ct. 361, 50 L.Ed.2d 313 (1976). Long distance calls placed 
with blue boxes are listed in telephone company records in a fashion 
similar to 'unmatched' cellular calls described by the Government's 
witnesses. This court has not found a reported case in which a 'blue 
box' used 'for the purposes of circumventing the charges on interstate 
long-distance calls' has been deemed to be an account 'access device' 
within the meaning of section 1029(e)(1) on the theory that the 'blue 
box' gained access to the telephone company's own accounts.  See, e.g., 
United States v. Disla, 805 F.2d 1340."
	
	Isn't the law fun? Think you're safe? At least from the Feds? Maybe. 
The court, after all, wasn't addressing the question of whether tone 
generators were covered by section 1029, they were deciding on whether  
a tumbling cellular phone was. These side opinions are called dicta. But 
let me tell you folks, this is dammed powerful dicta.*

	 (f) This section does not prohibit any lawfully authorized 
investigative, protective or intelligence activity of a law enforcement 
agency of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision of  a 
State, or of an intelligence agency of the United States, or any 
activity authorized under chapter 224 of this title. For purposes of 
this subsection, the term "State" includes a State of the United States, 
the District of Columbia, and any commonwealth, territory, or possession 
of the United States.  -end-
