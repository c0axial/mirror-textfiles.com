I. EDITORIAL PAGE	

	1. Damien Thorn has agreed to be the technical editor for 
private line. Damien has written for Tap and 2600.  He now writes 
a great column called Full Duplex Communications for Nuts and 
Volts. Damien brings more than 15 years of practical, hands on 
hacking experience to private line. Let me explain a little about 
what he'll be doing for the magazine and what it means to you.

	2. Damien won't be checking every technical fact in my 
writing or in this magazine, any more than I will check on his 
writing. Instead, he'll help me with questions that I can't 
answer. I can't tell you, for example, which cell phones are the 
easiest to work on and why. He can. I can tell you in general 
about cell phone theory and operation but I can't tell you much 
about real field experiences. He can. His advice will help me make 
fewer mistakes and  keep private line more interesting and more 
practically grounded. In addition, he's also open to the idea of 
writing a column on a regular basis. I am very happy that he has 
signed on.

	3. What will this magazine cover in the future? I intend to 
write general pieces about specific subjects. An issue on PBX's, 
one on outside plant equipment, another on business telecom 
equipment and so on. I will not write any specific hacking pieces 
myself. That's for any reader of the magazine to do. I could put 
two months of effort into a piece about hacking ROLMs but what 
good would that do someone who doesn't know about PBX operation to 
begin with? Someone that doesn't know a port from a pier? Reader 
submitted articles may be as specific as you like. But I'll keep 
my pages and my articles oriented toward beginners.	

	4. Today is January 1, 1995. The start of a new year. It's 
odd to think that these words won't be read until March. In 
reality, my deadline is only three or four weeks before the cover 
date. But you have to get each page done when you can. It's one of 
many oddities that I am dealing with for the first time. Magazine 
distribution is certainly another. A newssrack for a small 
magazine is like a consignment stand. Practically every magazine 
will be bought  the real question is how many. You're doing well 
if 25% of your magazines go unsold. I explained the costs of 
producing private line last issue but I didn't figure in the cost 
of returns. Instead of $1.18 a copy, therefore, the true cost is 
more like $1.47. Quite a difference. On the positive side, it 
looks like I'll have at least 1200 copies printed up of this issue 
instead of 600 for the last. That will lower the per unit cost 
quite a bit. On the other hand, the better  cover for this issue 
will  make costs go up. And first class mail rates have also gone 
up. Oh, well. It feels like I am reinventing the wheel in learning 
all these things. When I don't have the time to learn them to 
begin with. What's a solution? 	

	5. Well, the solution might be easy if I had a great deal of 
money. I could hire staff and advertising people. Then I'd go back 
to writing and research. But I don't have the money nor would I 
really want to change the character of the magazine by hiring a 
paid staff. Perhaps a better idea might be to organize a loosely 
structured publishing house for alternative technical magazines. 
Six or seven 'zines using the same printer to lower costs, sharing 
the same advertiser list and promoting each other's magazines with 
free ads in each others publications. Nothing too formal or 
involved. More like an association. No dues or fees. We could all 
keep in touch with fax machines, the mail and the internet. 	A 
quick check of Factsheet5 reveals several technologically oriented 
magazines: 2600, 2600 Connection, 3W, Short Circuit and 
Historically Brewed. Throw in all the electronic zines on the net 
that don't go into hardcopy and you've got quite a few people who  
aren't in the mainstream writing about tech. I don't have the time 
to explore this right now but feel free to write if you have any 
thoughts along this line.	Lastly, I want to thank all my new 
readers, especially those subscribers who signed up without seeing 
a copy of private line first. That takes faith. In return, I'll 
try to put out the best magazine I can, something with articles 
you'll be interested in. The mailbox and the electronic door are 
always open . . .

II. UPDATES AND CORRECTIONS

	6. The internet patent connection got turned off for a few 
weeks in January. Try it again if you were disappointed before. 
Internet Multicasting Service and the Patent and Trademark Office 
were apparently involved in a turf war, with the PTO doing the 
instigating. There's hope, though, for the future. Bruce Lehman, 
commissioner of the Patent Office, told the IEEE Spectrum that his 
agency intends to put the entire patent collection online by the 
end of the decade. Hot damn. That means the text of all patents 
dating back to 1790. Wouldn't it be possible, however, to get text 
and illustrations at a web site? The patents are simple black and 
white line drawings. Speaking of web sites, I didn't include the 
PTO's in last issue. It is: http://www.uspto.gov/

	7. Def Con III will be held at the Tropicana Hotel in Las 
Vegas on August 4th, 5th, and  6th. Speakers will talk on the 
fifth and sixth. Get there. The Tropicana Hotel is located at 3801 
Las Vegas Blvd. South, Las Vegas, Nevada, 89109. Rooms are $65 for 
a single or a double Monday through Thursday. Rates climb to $90 
for a single or double from Friday to Sunday. Ask for the Def Con 
III convention to get those rates when you call. The Tropicana is 
at (800) 4689494 or (702) 7392448 (Fax). Yes, Dark Tangent knows 
that those rates are expensive. That's why he encourages everyone 
to keep track of developments as the con draws near. Keep up on 
details and you'll find cheaper motels, people to drive with or 
people to crash with. The ftp site is: ftp.fc.net /pub/defcon. 
Subscribe to the mailing list by sending email to the following: 
majordomo@fc.net. Put the following statement in the body of your

list and you will receive updated information on a regular basis. 
DT's voice mail is 07008264368 from a phone with AT&T LD. His 
email address is dtangent@defcon.org. There's also a bulletin 
board at Alliance Communications +1 612251 2511. Or write him at 
2709 E. Madison #102, Seattle, WA, 98112. That will also get you 
on a list.	I do not want any excuses from any of you for not going. 
You have the whole spring and summer to save up. You have months 
and months to schedule an entire week off. Which is what you'll 
need to really enjoy yourself. And you will enjoy yourself. I 
won't be speaking but I will ask Dark Tangent about setting aside 
an hour or two for telephone talk. Anyone interested in that could 
just show up at a certain place at a certain time. No big deal. I 
wrote at length about Def Con II in private line #3. Please, 
please try to get there. I'll be writing a little more on this as 
the con draws near.	

	8. I just got a copy of Public Communications Magazine. It's 
the trade magazine that covers customer coin operated telephones  
most. A careful reading clears up many mysteries surrounding the 
wiley COCOT. Even the ads are interesting. The inside cover of the 
November issue, for example, has a Mars Electronic International 
ad that shows their MS16 electronic coin validator. It's an 
electronic beastie that checks each coin deposited into a COCOT. 
While these units were originally designed to guard against fraud, 
some telcos have been installing them in an apparent attempt to 
prevent red boxing. Unlike a COCOT, a telco payphone doesn't check 
every coin deposited during a conversation. It usually just checks 
the initial deposit. It can't do much more since it's just a dumb 
box of relays. No memory or intelligence. It sends tones to the 
central office to indicate a coin deposit. A red box simulates 
those tones. A coin validator can help stop this if added to a 
telco payphone. There are other ways for a telco to stop red 
boxing. One of my readers reports that GTE in some parts of the 
midwest has gone away from ACTS or automated coin toll service. 
They're now routing 1+ calls to the operator. You can still try 
boxing but you lose your anonymity. Public Communications also 
mentions some other interesting things. Ever notice the housing on 
these COCOTs? They look like a telco brand (W.E.) but cheaper? 
Quadram Telecom probably makes them. And who supplies the boards 
for these so called smart phones? The boards that let the COCOT 
total coins, rate calls and provide an ACTS like voice to tell you 
how much they are ripping you off for? Leading suppliers are 
Protel, maker of the BB and 2000 board, Intellistar, Elcotel and 
Intellicall. These fit on a chassis as illustrated on page 48.
And the locking mechanisms? The most sophisticated is from Medeco 
High Security Locks, Inc. It's part of a whole system of key 
management. Check out the March 7, 1994 issue of Design News for 
more information on this coin box lock. Look for this system to 
come into wider use in the future.

	9. Speaking of the future, the telephone industry is going 
nuts over debit cards. And I mean nuts. Even Teleconnect is going 
overboard. Public Communications and Telecard World are fueling 
the fire but it is the private payphone owner and the card seller 
that will shove these things into our lives. What's worse is the 
talk of putting debit card payphones in a neighborhood near you. 
No coins accepted, thank you. Coinless phones were limited before 
to airports, train stations or highway rest stops. Places where 
you had lots of other phones to choose from or no other phones at 
all. One example is Ameritech's LobbyLine indoor coin phone. You 
call with a calling card or debit card. Or you call collect or 
bill to a third party. The present debit phones, though, are being 
discussed as a replacement to the omnipresent COCOT. The reason? 
Pure greed. Protel's president, Jerry Yachabach, says that more 
than 70% of the cost of maintaining payphones is due to coin 
related functions. He reasons that the industry should find a 
substitute for coins. Great. His comments go along with pictures 
of two expensive looking credit card phones. No doubt Protel will 
make big bucks by selling these things.  And what about the rest 
of the trade? What do they think? Eric Stebel, Managing Editor of 
Public Communications, nearly drools when he writes "And talk 
about vandalism and theft  switching to a debit card payphone 
would virtually eliminate that. When was the last time you heard 
of someone blowing up a payphone just for the fun of it? No, most 
vandals have an ulterior motive  to get to your payphone's coin 
box. And just think of the float money your company could make off 
of lost or unused cards. Heck, some people would even buy your 
debit cards as a collectible and never use them." Hey, Eric, float 
this! Let's go over some of these terms.	

	10. The most common form of debit card is the prepaid long 
distance calling card. Or talk and toss. Industry types call it 
centralized debit card technology. You pay for a certain amount of 
long distance in advance at a retail store. In return you get a 
card. Such as the "AT&T  PrePaid Calling Card" available at Office 
Depot. It has an 800 number and a calling card number on the back. 
The pictures on the front, in part, drive collector mania. These 
can be anything from Satan to Santa. Let's say you want to call 
Germany. You call a number like 1800357 PAID. Your call is routed 
to a PBX somewhere. Industry favorites for prepaid cards are the 
NACT LCX 120C from National Applied Computer Technologies and the 
Harris Digital Systems 20/20 switch. Harris has an entire system 
called Protocall to handle prepaid debit cards. Their 20/20 switch 
is called a NGC for some strange reason when it's part of 
Protocall. In any case, the card seller's switch gets your call. 
What then? Next step is to enter the calling card number. Could be 
anything. Like 533 442 5968. The automated attendant tells you the 
value on your card. It then tells you to dial your number. Your 
call now goes out from the PBX to the Federal Republic. The robot 
comes back on after your call to tell you how much you have left 
on your card. You're now free to make another call or hang up. 
It's a pretty neat system and you can't beat the anonymity when 
you're calling from a payphone. The Tonya Harding Gang did have 
their toss and talk card calls monitored. But that's because the 
FBI was already watching. 

	11. What are the economics of all this? Here's a quotation 
from December's Teleconnect. This article had the happy title 
"Cash Cow": "Imagine you have a 100 store chain. You sell one 
$20 prepaid  calling card per day per store. You bring in $60,000 
a month. ($3,000 cards). You sell calls for 35 cents a minute. 
Your call cost is 24 cents a minute. 15% of the cards are not 
active  (breakage). Your first month's operating margin is 
$24,000. Your first year's operating margin is $486,300. Where 
does the 24 cents a minute come from? You pay seven  cents a 
minute for inbound 800 calls. Eight cents a minute for  calls 
going out.  Staff and space two cents. Equipment is five cents. 
Printing of cards is half a cent. Dedicated T1s [the leased line 
running from the telephone company  to the  switch] are one and a 
half cents a minute. The name of the game is volume. Without 
volume you can't get your prices down enough." Well, you know that 
AT&T can get costs down. Yet they charge 60 cents a minute for a 
call within the United States on their card. Much of that must go 
to places like Office Depot that actually sell the card. But it's 
still an expensive service. Remember, too, that a one minute and 
one second call will get you  dinged for two minutes. 	The other 
kind of debit card is one with a magnetic stripe. You swipe these 
in the reader of a debit card payphone. Many countries have this 
service. Some telcos are playing with it now. Want to call home 
from the Quickie Mart? Buy a card from the store or go to a 
vending machine. Just like a BART card. Calls go directly to their 
destination once the payphone approves the card. The Public 
Utilities Commission in each state will probably require that 911, 
800 numbers and 10X codes can be dialed without a card. Whether 
the COCOT actually allows those calls is another story.  You may 
also hear about a debit card with an integrated circuit built in. 
This is chip technology. The chip itself maintains the account 
balance of the card. VISA and Mastercard are coming out with these 
soon. You'll be able to make small transactions of all sorts, 
including phone calls. I think, though, that calling them debit 
cards is wrong. Chip cards are based on credit and not on money 
put up front. That makes them a credit card and not a debit card.

III CELLULAR TELEPHONE BASICS, PART 1 -- BY TOM FARLEY 

	13. Welcome to the world of cellular telephony. It's a 
fascinating place. Used phones prices are falling rapidly. It's 
time to experiment or at least to read up. Let's look at the big 
picture first. Telephone over radio is nothing special or unusual. 
Long distance radio telephony dates back to at least 1927, with 
the introduction of overseas service on short wave between the 
United States and Great Britain. AT&T and the British Postal 
Office put that project on the air after four years of 
experimenting. They expanded it later to communicate with Canada, 
Australia, South Africa, Egypt and Kenya as well as ships at sea. 
This service had fourteen dedicated channels or frequencies 
eventually assigned to  it. The main transmitter was at Rugby, 
England. [1] Cables and satellites have replaced radio telephone 
for nearly all long distance use but  many ships still use it. 
Radio amateurs on short wave still handle noncommercial telephone 
calls over short wave. These patches often handle emergency 
traffic.	

	14. Local, noncommercial radio telephony has also been going 
on for years, possibly since the 1950's. Enterprising radio 
amateurs wired simple telephone interfaces to their base stations 
long before any direct connection to Bell System equipment was 
allowed. These home built kits preceded today's sophisticated 
autopatches. An autopatch is, essentially,  a remotely controlled 
phone. You activate and control one from afar with your radio's 
DTMF keypad. This could be a 6 meter, 2 meter, 70 cm or even a 1.2 
GHz handheld or car mounted rig. You can then make calls from 
anywhere that you can key up the autopatch.
	
	15. Car mounted mobile telephones carried out local 
commercial traffic for decades. Companies like Motorola still make 
them.  It's an excellent choice for areas not well served by 
cellular. Cellular service may cover 90% of urban areas, but it 
only reaches 30% to 40% of the geographical area of America. Many 
people refer to mobile telephone by just saying IMTS, which stands 
for Improved Mobile Telephone System. It's the newest form of 
mobile radio. [2] Most  IMTS equipment operates in the UHF band. A 
centrally located transmitter and receiver serves a wide area with 
a relatively few frequencies and users. It's the same concept that 
taxi fleets and tow truck companies use to dispatch vehicles. Most 
areas allow you to dial out directly from your car, however, there 
are still places where the operator comes up on frequency to place 
the call for you. [3] A single customer could drive 25 miles or 
more from the transmitter, however, only one person at a time 
could use that channel. 
	
	16. This limited availability of frequencies and their 
inefficient use were two main reasons for cellular's development. 
The breakup of the Bell System in 1984 allowed real cellular 
development to begin. The key to the system is the concept of 
frequency reuse as depicted in the upper right. Let's  look at 
that as well as some basic cell phone theory.

II Basic Theory and Background	

	17. Cell phone theory is simple. Executing that theory is 
extremely complex. Each cell site has a base station with a 
computerized 800 megahertz transceiver and an antenna. This radio 
equipment provides coverage for an area that's usually from two to 
ten miles in radius. Even smaller cell sites cover tunnels, 
subways and specific roadways. The amount of area depends on 
topography, population, and traffic. The MTSO decides which cell 
and which frequencies in that cell should carry your call. How 
does it do that?	
	
	18. Your telephone's signal strength declines or 
increases as you move toward or away from a tower. The nearest 
base station constantly reports this signal strength to the MTSO. 
The mobile switch transfers your call to another cell when your 
signal level drops to a predetermined point. This handoff usually 
occurs automatically when the switch determines that another 
cell's transmitter can provide a better, stronger connection. You 
may drive fifty miles, use 8 different cells and never once 
realize that your call has been transferred. Let's look at some 
basics of this amazing technology.

	19. The FCC allocates frequency space in the United States 
for many services. Some of these assignments may be coordinated 
with the International Telecommunications Union but many are not. 
Much debate and discussion over many years placed cellular 
frequencies  in the 800 megahertz band. The FCC also issues the 
necessary operating licenses to the different cellular providers. 
Cellular development began in earnest after the Bell System 
breakup in 1984. The United States decided to license two carriers 
in each geographical area. One license went automatically to the 
local exchange carriers. The LECs. The other went to an 
individual, a company or a group of investors who met a long list 
of requirements and who properly petitioned the FCC. Cellular 
parlance calls these LECs wireline carriers. Each company in each 
area took half the spectrum available. What's called the "A Band" 
and the "B Band." There's no real advantage in having either one. 
The nonwireline carriers usually got the A Band and the wireline 
carriers got the B band. Depending on the technology used, 
however, one carrier might provide three times the connections a 
competitor does with the same amount of spectrum.	

	20. Cell phone frequencies start at  824.04 MHz and end 
at 893.7 MHz. [4] That's 69.66 megahertz worth of radio frequency 
spectrum. Quite a chunk. By comparison, the AM broadcast band 
takes up only 1.17 megahertz of space. This band, however, 
provides only 107 frequencies to broadcast on. Cellular may 
provide thousands of frequencies to carry conversations and data. 
This large number of frequencies and the large channel width 
required for each channel account for the large amount of spectrum 
space. For example, AT&T's Advanced Mobile Phone Service or AMPS 
uses 832 channels that are 30 kHz wide. It's the most common 
system right now. AMPS, though, has been replaced with NAMPS in 
crowded cell site areas.  NAMPS stands for  Narrowband Advanced 
Mobile Service. It's a Motorola technology. It produces 2412 
narrow channels. A NAMP's channel is 10 kHz wide. AMPS, NAMPS and 
Hughes' ENAMPS are all FM based, analog systems. Digital systems 
like CDMA and TDMA provide even more channels in the same space. 
CDMA, in particular, could  provide 20 times the number of 
frequencies that an AMPS system can. Let's back up a little before 
we drown in a sea of acronyms.	

	21. I mentioned that a typical cell channel is 30 kilohertz 
wide compared to the ten kHz allowed an AM radio station. How is 
it possible, you might ask, that a one to three watt cellular 
phone call can take up a path that is three times wider than a 
50,000 watt broadcast station?  Well, power  does not necessarily 
relate to bandwidth. A  high powered signal might take up lots of 
room or a high powered signal might be narrowly focused. A wider 
channel helps with audio quality. An FM stereo station, for 
example, uses a 150 kHz channel to provide the best quality sound. 
A 30 kHz channel for cellular gives you great sound almost 
automatically, nearly on par with the normal telephone network. 
That's what's impressive about Motorola's NAMPS. The base station 
uses a special frequency control circuit  to keeps calls exactly 
on frequency. No wavering or moving off frequency to destroy a 
call's quality. Things should sound fine with this narrow band 
_if_ everything is working right.

	22. I also mentioned that the cellular band runs from 824.04 
MHz to 893. 97 MHz.  In particular, cell phones use the 
frequencies from 824.04 MHz to 848.97 and the base stations 
operate on 869.04 MHz to 893.97 MHz. 45 MHz separates each 
transmit and receive frequency within a cell. That keeps them from
interfering with each other. Getting confusing? Let's look at the
frequencies of a single cell for a single carrier. Maybe that will 
clear things up. For this example, let's assume that this is one 
of 21 cells in an AMPS system:

Cell#1 of 21 in Band A (The nonwireline carrier)

Channel 1 (333) Tx 879.990 Rx 834.990
Channel 2 (312) Tx 879.360 Rx 834.360
Channel 3 (291) Tx 878.730 Rx 833.730
Channel 4 (270) Tx 878.100 Rx 833.100
Channel 5 (249) Tx 877.470 Rx 832.470
Channel 6 (228) Tx 876.840 Rx 831.840
Channel 7 (207) Tx 876.210 Rx 831.210
Channel 8 (186) Tx 875.580 Rx 830.580  etc., etc., 

(Each cell has at least 15 frequencies or channels)	

	23. The cellular network assigns these frequency pairs 
carefully and in advance. The layout is confusing since the 
pattern is non-intuitive and because there are so many numbers 
involved. Don't get too caught up with exact frequency assignments 
unless you want to go further. [5] Speaking of numbers, check out 
the sidebar. Channels 800 to 832 are not labeled as such. Cell 
channels go up to 799 in AMPS and then stop. Believe it or not, 
the numbering begins again at 991 and then goes up to 1023. That 
gives us 832.  Why offset at all? Cellular is not like CB radio. 
Citizen's band uses the same frequency to transmit and receive. A 
push to talk setup. Cellular provides full duplex communication 
like nearly all modern radios. It's more expensive since the 
mobile unit and the base station need the circuitry to transmit on 
one frequency while receiving on another. But it's the only way 
that permits a normal, back and forth, talk when you want 
to, conversation. 
                                                                                
                          
	24. Some Important Frequency Terms	Okay, so what do we do we 
have? Three things: 1) Cell phones transmit on certain, dedicated 
frequencies, 2) base stations transmit on certain, dedicated 
frequencies and 3) a certain amount of bandwidth separates these 
frequencies. Let's get even more specific. We call a cell site's 
transmitting frequency the forward channel. A forward channel 
contains everything you hear since it is the cell site that 
transmits it. The cell phone's transmitting frequency, by 
comparison, is called the  reverse channel. There's more. Certain 
channels carry only data. We call these control channels. They, 
too, have a forward and reverse frequency. This control channel is 
usually the first channel in each cell. It's responsible for call 
setup. Getting confusing? Let's go back to our friendly cell site 
for an example. 

[TABLE]

	25. The first channel  is always the control channel for each 
cell. You'll have 21 control channels if you have 21 cells. Calls 
get setup on these. A call gets going, in other words, on the 
control channel first. The MTSO then assigns a normal channel to 
carry the conversation. The voice channels and the control channel 
may handle signaling during the actual conversation. A single 
call, therefore, involves two kinds of forward and reverse 
channels. One for voice and data and one  for data only. Makes it 
hard to follow, doesn't it? But there are real benefits to 
figuring it out. A phone's ESN number, for example, is only 
transmitted on the reverse control channel. A person poaching ESNs 
need only monitor one of 21 frequencies. They don't have to look 
through the entire band. 	I'll use the terms reverse control 
channel and reverse voice channel to keep these terms separate 
from now on. One last point at the risk of loosing everybody. 
You'll hear about dedicated control channels, paging channels, and 
access channels. These are not different channels but different 
uses of the control channel. Let's clear up the confusion by 
looking at call processing. We'll start out with AMPS since it's 
the most common system and because TDMA uses the AMPS protocol to 
first set up calls. Even a CDMA carrier uses an AMPS system in the 
background to carry calls from non-digital phones. We'll also 
touch on a number of new terms along the way. 

III Call Processing

	26. Let's look at how cellular uses data channels and voice 
channels. Keep in mind the big picture while we discuss this. A 
call gets set up on a control channel and another channel actually 
carries the conversation. The whole  process begins with 
registration. It's what happens when you first turn on a phone but 
before you punch in a number and hit the send button. It only 
takes a few hundred milliseconds. Registration lets the local 
system know that a phone is active, in a particular area and that 
it can now take incoming calls. What cell folks call pages. The 
local system then notifies, in theory, the entire nationwide 
cellular network that this phone has come on line. Registration 
begins when you turn on your phone. 

	Registration -- Hello, World!

	27. A mobile phone runs a self diagnostic when it's powered 
up. Once completed it acts like a scanning radio. It searches 
through its list of forward control frequencies, trying to pick 
the one with the strongest signal. The nearest base station 
usually provides that. The phone then transmits information to 
identify itself on the corresponding reverse control frequency. 
The mobile sends its phone number, its electronic serial number 
and its home system ID. Among other things. The cell site relays 
this information to the mobile telecommunications switching 
office. The MTSO, in turn, communicates with different databases, 
switching centers and software programs. 

	28. The phone gets registered with the local system if 
everything checks out. It can now take incoming calls since the 
system is aware that it is in use. The mobile then monitors a 
paging channel while it idles. All idle phones monitor this 
initial paging channel or IPCH. It's usually channel 333 for the 
non-wireline carrier and 334 for the wireline carrier. [6] Only 
larger systems have multiple paging channels. Again, this is a 
data based, forward control channel, transmitted by the cell site. 
What's different about a paging channel is that it cuts across the 
entire cellular service area. It's transmitted by each base 
station, even if that frequency isn't part of a cell's group of 
fifteen or sixteen. A mobile first responds to a page on the 
reverse control channel of the cell it is in. The MTSO then 
assigns yet another channel for the conversation. But I am getting 
ahead of myself. Let's finish registration.

 	29. Registration is an ongoing process. Moving from one 
service area to another causes registration to begin again.  Just 
waiting ten or fifteen minutes does the same thing. It's an 
automatic activity of the system. It  updates the status of the 
waiting phone to let the system know what's going on. The cell 
site can initiate registration on its own by sending a signal to 
the mobile. That forces the unit to transmit and identify itself. 
Registration also takes place just before you call.  Again, the 
whole process takes only a few hundred milliseconds.

	30. AMPS uses frequency shift keying to send data. Just like 
a modem.  Data's  sent in binary. 0's and 1's. 0's go on one 
frequency and  1's go on another. They alternate back and forth in 
rapid succession. Don't be confused by the mention of more 
frequencies. Frequency shift keying uses the existing carrier 
wave. The data rides 8kHz above and below, say, 879.990 MHz. Read 
up on modems and FSK and you'll understand the way AMPS sends 
digital information. Data gets sent at 10 k bps or  100,000 bits 
per second from the cell site. Quite impressive if we're talking 
about a modem on a land line. But we aren't. Cellular uses a radio 
link, a very high frequency signal that's subject to  the vagaries 
of its band. Things such as billboards, trucks, and underpasses 
can deflect a cellular call. So the system repeats each part of 
each digital message five times. That slows things considerably. 
Add in the time for encoding and decoding the digital stream and 
the actual transfer rate can fall to as low as 1200 bps. [7] 
Remember, too, that an analog wave carries this digital 
information, just like most modems. It's not completely accurate 
to call AMPS an analog system. AMPS is actually a hybrid system, 
combining both digital and analog signals.	

	Getting a Call -- The Process

	31. Okay, your phone's now registered with your local system. 
You get a call. It's just MCI security, wondering about all those 
conference calls to the mideast. You laugh and hang up. As you 
drive off to pick up another shipment of weapons, you marvel at 
the process of getting a call. What happened? Your phone 
recognized its mobile number on the paging channel. That's usually 
the forward control channel. The mobile responds by sending its 
identifying information once again to the MTSO, along with a 
message confirming that it received the page. The system responds 
by sending a voice channel assignment to the cell you are in. The 
cell site's transceiver gets this information and begins setting 
things up. It first informs the mobile about the new channel, say, 
channel 10 in cell number 8. It then generates a supervisory audio 
tone or SAT on the forward voice frequency. What's that? 

	32. An SAT is a high pitched tone that acts like a marker. 
The mobile tunes to its assigned channel and it looks for the 
right supervisory audio tone. Upon hearing it, the mobile throws 
the tone back to the cell site on its reverse voice channel. We 
now have a loop going between the cell site and the phone. This 
verifies that the mobile is on the right frequency. No SAT means 
no good. The cell site can fine tune the phone's reception with 
the SAT. It can also use it roughly determine the phone's 
location, since it takes a certain time for the signal to make a 
go around. The cell site releases or unmutes the forward voice 
channel if the SAT gets returned. It follows that by sending a 
digital signal on the FVC. This signal alerts the mobile to an 
incoming call. That action, in turn, causes the mobile to take the 
mute off the reverse voice channel. The  mobile sends an audio 
tone to the cell site confirming that it got the alerting message. 
The system then produces a ringing sound for your caller while 
your phone rings. But let's go back to the SAT for just a moment.

	33. I said that a mobile looks for the right supervisory 
audio tone.  AMPS uses three named frequencies: SAT 0: 5970 Hz, 
SAT 1: 6000 Hz, and SAT 2: 6030 Hz. Three different markers. Why? 
Spacing cell site frequencies carefully avoids interference. It's 
the same way with SATs. Call setup is ongoing in each cell. Using 
several frequencies makes sure that the mobile is using the right 
channel assignment. It's not enough to get a tone on the right 
forward and reverse frequency  the system must get the right 
channel and the right SAT. Two steps. Incorrect SATs cause havoc 
in the cellular bands. This tone is transmitted briefly but 
somewhat continuously during a call. You don't hear it since the 
signal lasts less than 300 ms. and because it's muted during 
transmission. The mobile, in fact, drops a call after a certain 
amount of time if it looses the SAT connection. 
	
	34. Well, enough about the SAT. I mentioned another tone 
that's generated by the mobile phone itself. It's called the 
signalling tone or ST. Don't confuse it with the SAT. You need the 
supervisory audio tone first. The ST comes in after that. It's 
necessary to complete the call. The mobile produces the ST, 
compared to the SAT which the cell site originates. The signaling 
tone is a very high audio frequency tone that you can't hear. 
Maybe your dog can but not you. It's 10 kHz tone.  The mobile 
starts transmitting this signal back to the cell on the forward 
voice channel once it gets an alerting message. Your phone stops 
transmitting it once you pick up the handset or otherwise go off 
hook to answer its ringing. Cell folks might call this 
confirmation of alert. The system knows that you've picked up the 
phone when the ST stops. AMPS uses signalling tones of different 
duration's to indicate three other  things. 	Cleardown  or 
termination means hanging up, going on hook or terminating a call. 
The phone sends a signalling tone of 1.8 seconds when that 
happens. 400 ms. of ST means a hookflash. Hookflash requests 
additional services during a conversation in some areas. 
Confirmation of handover request is another arcane cell term. The 
ST gets sent for 50 ms. before your call is handed from one cell 
to another. Along with the SAT. That assures a smooth handoff from 
one cell to another. The MTSO assigns a new channel, checks for 
the right SAT and listens for a signalling tone when a handover 
occurs. Complicated but effective and all happening in less than a 
second.

	Origination -- Making a call--	

	35. Making a mobile call uses many steps  that help receive a 
call. The same basic process. Punch out the number that you want 
to call. Press the send button. Your mobile transmits that 
telephone number, along with a request for service signal, and all 
the information used to register a call to the cell site. The 
mobile transmits this information on the strongest reverse control 
channel. The MTSO checks out this info and assigns a voice 
channel. It communicates that assignment to the mobile on the 
forward control channel. The cell site opens a voice channel and 
transmits a SAT on it. The mobile detects the SAT and locks on, 
transmitting it back to the cell site. The MTSO detects this 
confirmation and sends the mobile a message in return. This could 
be several things. It might be a busy signal, ringback or whatever 
tone was delivered to the switch. Making a call, however, involves 
far more problems and resources than an incoming call does.

	36. Making a call and getting a call from your cellular phone 
should be equally easy. It isn't. Originating a call from a mobile 
presents many problems for the user and the carrier. Especially 
when you are out of your local area. Incoming calls don't present 
a risk to the carrier. Someone on the other end is paying for 
them. The carrier, however, is responsible for the cost of 
fraudulent calls originating in its system. Most systems  shut 
down roaming or do an operator intercept rather than allow a 
questionable call. I've had close friends asked for their credit 
card numbers by operators in order to place a call. Can you 
imagine giving a credit card number or a calling card number over 
the air? You're now back at a payphone, just like the good old 
days. Cellular One has shut down roaming "privileges" altogether 
in New York City, Washington and Miami at different times. But you 
can go through their operator and pay three times the cost of a 
normal call if you like. So what's going on? Why the problem with 
some outgoing calls? We first have to look at some more terms and 
procedures.  We need to see what happens with call processing at 
the switch and network level.  This is the exciting world of 
precall validation.

	37. We know that pressing send or turning on the phone 
conveys information about the phone to the cell site and then to 
the MTSO. A call gets checked with all this information. There are 
many parts to each digital message. A five digit code called the 
home system identification number (SID or sometimes SIDH) 
identifies the cellular carrier your phone is registered with.  
For example, Cellular One's code in Sacramento is 00129. Go to 
Stockton forty miles south and Cellular One uses 00224. A system 
can easily identify roamers with this information. The "Roaming" 
lamp flashes if you are out of your local area.  Or the "No 
Service" lamp comes on if the mobile can't pick up a useable 
signal. This number is keypad programmable, of course, since 
people change carriers and move to different areas. You can find 
yours by calling up a local cellular dealer. Or by putting your 
phone in the programming mode. [8]. This number doesn't go off in 
a numerical form, of course, but as a binary string of zero's and 
ones. These digital signals are repeated several times to make 
sure they get received.	The mobile identification number or MIN 
is your telephone's telephone number. MINs are keypad 
programmable. You or a dealer can assign it any number desired.  
That makes it different than its electronic serial number that we 
discuss next. A MIN is ten digits long. A  MIN is not your 
directory number since it is not long enough to include a country 
code. It's also limited when it comes to future uses since it 
isn't long enough to carry an extension number either. [9]

	38. The electronic serial number or ESN is a unique number 
assigned to each phone. One per phone! Every cell phone starts out 
with just one ESN. This number gets electronically burned into the 
phone's ROM, or read only memory chip. A phone's MIN may change 
but the serial number remains the same. The ESN is a long binary 
number. Its 32 bit size provides billions of possible serial 
numbers. The ESN gets transmitted whenever the phone is turned on, 
handed over to another cell or at regular intervals decided by the 
system. Every ten to fifteen minutes is typical. Capturing an ESN 
lies at the heart of cloning. You'll often hear about stolen 
codes. "Someone stole Major Giuliani's and Commissioner Bratton's 
codes." The ESN is what is actually being intercepted. A code is 
something that stands for something else. In this case, the ESN. A 
hexadecimal number represents the ESN for programming and test 
purposes. [10] Such a number might look like this: 82  57  2C  01.

	39. The station class mark or SCM tells the cell site and the 
switch what power level the mobile operates at and what 
frequencies the phone uses. The cell site can turn down the power 
in your phone, lowering it to a level that will do the job while 
not interfering with the rest of the system. The SCM also tells 
the switch if your phone is voice activated. That information, in 
turn, affects the way the MTSO handles signalling a VOX phone.
	
	40. The switch process this information along with other 
data. It first checks for a valid ESN/MIN combination. You don't 
get a dial tone unless your phone number matches up with a 
correct, valid serial number. You have to have both unless, 
perhaps, if you call 911. The local carrier checks its own 
database first. Each carrier maintains its own records but the 
database may be almost anywhere. These local databases are 
updated, supposedly, around the clock by two much larger data 
bases maintained by Electronic Data Systems and GTE. EDS maintains 
records for most of the former Bell companies and their new 
cellular spin offs. GTE maintains records for GTE cellular 
companies as well as for the Cellular One group, a consortium of 
many different companies.	 Dial tone will not be returned unless 
everything checks out.  They try to supply a current list of bad 
ESNs as well as information to the network on the 27,000 new 
cellular users coming on line every day.

	41. A local caller will probably get dial tone if everything 
checks out. Roamers may not have the same luck if they're in 
another state or fairly distant from their home system. A roamer's 
record must be checked from afar. Many carriers still can't agree 
on the way to exchange this information or how to pay for it. A 
lot comes down to cost. A distant system may still be dependent on 
older switches or slower databases that can't provide a quick 
response.  The so called North American Cellular Network is an 
attempt to link each participating carrier together with the same 
intelligent network/system 7 facilities. Still, that leaves many 
rural areas out of the loop. A call may be dropped or intercepted 
rather than allowed dial tone. In addition, the various carriers 
are always arguing over fees to query each others databases. Fraud 
is enough of a problem in some areas that many systems will not 
take a chance in passing a call through. Yet the fraud is fueled 
in part by lax network security. It's really a numbers game. How 
much is the system actually loosing? How much is prevention? 
Preventive measures may cost millions of dollars to put in place 
at each MTSO. In any case, the outlook is not good for roaming. 
Yet the ability to drive anywhere and call from anywhere was a 
main reason to move away from the old mobile telephone system. You 
used to have to call ahead to say that you would be visiting a 
distant city. An operator then had to make arrangements for your 
phone to be recognized by the local system. Well, Cellular One 
throughout December and January of last year was asking visiting 
cell phone callers to do just that before coming to New York City. 
Such progress!

	42. In the next issue I'll write a shorter article that 
highlights TDMA and CDMA. I intend to have a resource list of part 
suppliers and publications. I'll also bring you some current 
information on cell fraud, including a look at Cellular Technical 
Service's Project Blackbird, a radio "fingerprinting" system 
designed to identify cloned phones. A similar system is being 
turned on in N.Y.C so the article should be  interesting . .

IV THE ROSEVILLE TELEPHONE COMPANY MUSEUM ------------------------

The Photographs on the Opposite Page

	43. The upper left hand photograph shows the interior of a 
typical magneto wall set. Turn a crank and you generate enough 
power to signal the operator. Batteries provided the line current 
needed to talk. Note the pad beneath the batteries used to soak up 
the occasional acid spill.

	44. The upper right hand photograph shows an Automatic 
Electric, Type 1 test board that was one of four  in service in 
Roseville from 1956 to 1984. Tests of the local loop often 
required one person at the test board and one person in the field 
to actually perform the adjustments. Many coin line tests are 
marked at this board.

	45. The lower left hand photograph shows an operator toll 
switchboard in use from 1959 to 1981. Local and long distance toll 
calls were handled at this A.E. Model Type 31C cord toll board. 
Several boards were in use at any one time. 

	46. The lower right hand photograph shows a detail of the 
step by step  switch. The entire mechanism is nearly six feet tall 
by six feet wide. All photographs by Little Sheeba" 

Text of Article -----------

	"The notion of a museum springs from the passion for 
	collecting, which is deeply rooted in human nature. All 
	civilizations, from the most primitive to the most advanced, 
	share the desire to accumulate objects that are beautiful, 
	costly, rare, or merely curious."

	47. The Roseville Telephone Company's museum in downtown 
Roseville, California  is a marvelous collection of telephone 
technology. More than that,  it reflects the history of an 
independent, progressive telephone company. Any telecom enthusiast 
should take the time to travel there, visit for an hour or two and 
engage in wondering, reflection and curiosity. What will you find?  
300+ telephones. 12 switchboards.   A test board and a toll board. 
Friendly telephone people to talk to. And best of all  the pride 
of the museum  a working step by step switch. 

	48. Step by step or Strowger switches were the mainstay of 
switching in rural and small town America for over forty years.  
I've described stepper operation in previous issues but I never 
thought  I did a good job of explaining the process. Seeing one 
work is a great way to understand it. A large, open case contains 
the switch. Three phones are mounted on the left side of the case 
and three on the right. You can call from one phone to the other 
and in so doing observe all the action. Pick up a handset and go 
off hook. A selector jumps into action as you start dialing. Watch 
the wipers revolve as they search for a contact. Something's 
moving with every digit you dial. Hang up and everything resets 
itself with a satisfying clunk. Will you comprehend Strowger when 
you see it? Maybe not. But you should see it anyway. A stepper is 
like a Swiss watch with its insides revealed. You may not follow 
the function of each lever, sprocket and cam but you can 
appreciate its design and construction. And you can hear the 
wonderful clicking, chattering sound that steppers make, the sound 
that old switchmen get nostalgic about. The Roseville Telephone 
Company people will happily explain its operation. They'll even 
show you how the TraceaMatic works. It's a simple device once used 
to trace calls on a step switch. 	

	49. The magneto powered cord switchboard is also interesting. 
Switchboards like these acted as a telephone company's central 
office before automation. This board dates back to 1914, the first 
year of RTC's operation. A small crank on the bottom right hand 
side allowed an operator to ring a customer's phone. Let the RTC 
people demonstrate how the board rings some of the phones on 
display. Vary the cranking at the switchboard and you vary the 
ring. That's important since RTC had more than ten subscribers on 
some party lines. What Roseville Telephone called farmers' lines. 
Each customer needed a distinctive ring, since it was the only way 
each party could tell if the call was for them. Party lines lasted 
until 1986 when the last open wire farmer line was retired. 
There's a nice exhibit that tells the story. That display includes 
square poles, insulators and samples of the wires. The two parties 
on that retired line, by the way, had their old monthly rate 
grandfathered in. To this day they pay less than $3.00 a month for 
phone service.	

	50. There's 4,000 square of exhibit space at the museum. The 
curator of the museum, Bob Parsons, says that Roseville Telephone 
will expand this to 8,000 feet within just a few years. Some of 
this new area will include outside plant equipment as well as a 
working open wire demonstration. They're even going to outfit an 
old telephone repair truck from the 1920's with a complete set of 
tools. 

	51. Thinking of going?  I've had friends from Stockton and 
the San Francisco bay area say that it's well worth the drive. 
Plan to spend an hour to an hour and a half in the museum. Have 
lunch  afterwards and help out the flood stricken economy. There 
are plenty of antique stores in Roseville in case someone with you 
gets bored. As well as one of the major train switching yards on 
the West Coast. Speaking of antiques, Roseville has a dealer who 
specializes in telephones. American Antiques and Collectables is 
located inside the building at 106 Judah Street. The old phones 
are expensive but you can handle them and look at them closely.

	52. I tried to find out about telephone museums and 
collections in the United States but I've come up with only a 
small, incomplete list. Please write if you find something 
interesting in you area. Local antique dealers might help you. Go 
in to a large one and ask who collects telephones. A telephone 
collector will know if there are any museums or displays in the 
area. You might even be able to wrangle a tour of a private 
collection. Want to know more?  Fagen's  A History of Engineering 
and Operation in the Bell System: The Early Years 1875  1925  
explains older phones and systems. It concentrates on Western 
Electric equipment but it is still invaluable on understanding 
early phones, PBX's, toll boards and switchboards.

	53. Roseville is located 15 miles northeast of Sacramento, 
California Take Interstate 80 to the Atlantic Street off ramp. 
Head north into Roseville. Atlantic becomes Vernon downtown. The 
address of the museum is 106 Vernon. It is open on Saturdays only 
from 10 to 4. Look for the only  building with a cell tower on 
top.

	V. TELECOM RELATED MAGAZINES AND NEWSLETTERS

	54. Welcome to the telecom related magazine  list of private 
line. This is an update to the list that first appeared in issue 
Number 5. I think it is the best magazine list on the Internet. I 
hope to update this every two months or so. Addresses are for 
subscriptions and samples. I didn't include editorial addresses to 
save space. Quoted material comes from a magazine's masthead or 
from a reader's comments. Let me know if you find any mistakes in 
this list or if you find a magazine that I should be aware of. 

	55. Some of these magazines will give you free subs if you 
take it third class and are "qualified" to have it. My advice is 
to ask for a sub, fill out their form and let them make the 
decision. Who knows? Maybe the magazine needs more subscribers so 
that they can charge higher ad rates. I personally am always 
willing to pay for a sample copy.

	56. See what happens after you write in. Then start filling 
out product information cards in the magazines that arrive. Be 
specific. The trick is to get a low cost flow of information into 
your mailbox. Really broke but still interested? Ask for their 
writers' guidelines along with a sample. Or ask for a media kit. 
Dummy up some letterhead at Office Depot and call yourself a 
consultant if you have to. But I just use my real name. That's 
worked so far.

southern California. It's well worth looking for. You'll probably 
want to subscribe if you enjoy 2600  or my magazine.

P.O. Box 2506
Cypress, CA 90630
(310) 596-4673

Quarterly. $20 a year. $5.00 for a sample.

Cabling Business Magazine

"The Only Telecommunications Copper and Fiber Optics Cabling and 
Wiring Magazine for Voice, Data, and Image." These people seem a 
little too  eager to give you a subscription. Wouldn't even tell 
me the price of a sample or sub over the phone. They insisted on 
sending a free copy. In addition, the publication is very 
practical and interesting. Write for this one!

Call Center 

A call center is a place that takes a customer's calls. It might 
be a catalog sales center or a cable TV company's order 
department. Interesting enough to check out. "Ten Ways To Foil a 
Hacker" was a good, non-hysterical article on fraud.

Call Center

Southampton, PA 18966 
1-800-677-3435
MCI Mail 627-4700. 
Monthly. US: 12 issues for $14. Canada: $20.

Cellular Business

"This rag sucks and doesn't contain much more than fluffy press 
releases from the manufacturers of phones and accessories.  No 
technical information, and they ran an article on cellular fraud 
that was grossly inaccurate and belonged in a Sunday newspaper 
supplement.  I subscribed, and then refused to send them the $39 
they wanted for a subscription.  Just glossy garbage."  Your 
editor, though, thinks that it really is worth a look, they seem 
to be getting  better.

recommends. He says it is trying to take on a more technical 
focus. Write for a sample.

Nashville, TN 37204

$29 for a U.S. sub and $39 for a Canadian or Mexican subscription.

Cellular Network Perspectives

Expertly done, professional newsletter. David Crowe focuses on

corporate slant.

Computer  Telephony

Driven by ads and corporations. Same folks as Call Center and 
Teleconnect. Some interesting articles on occasion. A recent 
article by Mitel predicts the death of PBX's as we understand them. 
They're giving away subs so you might as well sign up.

Electronic Design

A real find. Features articles occasionally on telecom. Goldberg's 
article on PCS, for example, was a better read than a similar 
article that ran about the same time in the expensive IEEE 
Personal Communications.

A hoot. COCOTs and more. The November, 1994 issue featured an

for following current events in the business."
