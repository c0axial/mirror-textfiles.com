                 (Biafra.... He's more than just sheets)

ok. ummm abraxus has been bitching at me to write a vomit lately and well
i really didn't have much to say.  He's always telling me to 'fix the damn
page' or 'write a vomit' or 'i don't need you'.  Well these things have
taken a toll on my ego.  Soooooo i'm getting depressed.  maybe i'll kill
myself and write a vomit suicide note.  Gee that would be pretty neato huh?
We could get on national tv.  the 5:00 news or something.  say..."Teen
commits suicide over Internet based magazine"  gee that would make headlines
and make all parents scared to let little billy talk or read anything,
especially when they tell the part how i met abraxus over a computer, which
is kinda funny in its own little way.

Which leads me to something(what's this?? thoughts being funneled to a
common purpose in one amazingly witty issue of vomit by god.. it's amazing)
-that was a long thing inside those little round things that are round
[whose name i forgot] so i used the brackets[the square ones].  Soooo OUCH
my hand hurt just thought i'd let you all know.  I have now lost my
thoughts of what i was channeling from the vomit gods. Oh yeah we've been
getting all sorts of lovely mail from people.  Me personally, i only get 1
or 2 a week having anything to do with vomit that isn't forwarded to me as
an incentive to write something.  Which finally leads me to my purpose:

-Thesis statemet please[sorta]-

Everybody i've met over a computer[in real life] has been normal for the
most part.  Scary huh?  You see all this stuff on the news[FORESHADOWING!!]
about how the 'internet' is all full of porno people and teenage rapists.
Well i'm none of the above and neither are you.  i hope. please don't ruin
my ingorance and tell me you are either.  basically the only person i met
who is a complete and total computer loser stereotype is our own beloved
vomit mascot Micheal Jerome V.[i don't know how to spell his last name]
[[gee i love these bracket thingys.... lets try []]][]][][]][]][][]][]][[.
ok all better now.  now back to work:

i have met about 4 people over the computer.  all of which are normal and
none of which weigh more than 180 pounds.  i'm probably the skinniest of
all the computer type people i know.  being the lanky hick wannabe that i
am standing 6'0 at 130lbs.   thats pretty damn skinny.  alas i don't care.
gee i like that word... maybe i could compile a list of all the vomit
readers to see how you guys compare and if you would be considered 'normal'
by The Vomit Weights & Measures Co. of the Greater Tri-State Area.
Henceforth i give you this form:
I might put this on a form on our web page later:
