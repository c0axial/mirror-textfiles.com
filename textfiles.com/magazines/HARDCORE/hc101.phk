Reviews - Ice Cube "The Predator"

New Review scale :

6.  Phat  - Ten years from now this shit'll still be so dope!
5.  Funky - Ownership is the difference between a mack and a mark
4.  Fine  - If your pockets are fat get it, but don't panic if you don't
3.  Fair  - It has some potential hits, and at least it doesn't stink
2.  Flat  - Somebody explain to me why this person even tried?!
1.  Flunk - The ultimate diss... PM Dawn sounded better

With that in mind, may I present...

Artist : Ice Cube
Tape   : The Predator
Label  : Priority Records

Lyrical content - 6
Musical content - 6
Overall rating  - 6

What can I say?  Fuck Billboard and the editor, and yet he still debuts at 
number one with a bullet on both the Pop and R&B charts!  I couldn't be 
happier if I had just won the lottery... to me this is the ultimate 
testimony of hip-hop's power.  He said "Fuck all y'all!" to the mainstream 
media, and in doing so paved the road of success for all future griots.  He 
has in fact proved that all you really need for success as a rap artist is 
lyrical talent and fat beats.  But enough chit-chat, it's time to drop the 
411 on one of hip-hop's ten greatest tapes EVER!

Side One        Side Two

First Day of School               Interview
When Will They Shoot?             Dirty Mack
Prejudice                         Don't Trust 'Em
Wicked                            Gangster Fairytale 2
Now I Gotta Wet 'Cha              Check Yo Self (with Das EFX)
The Predator                      Who Got the Camera
Today Was a Good Day              Malcolm X
Tear This Muthafucker Up          Say Hi to the Bad Guy

'First 6ay of School' sets it off nicely, with the meaning of 'school' 
becoming instantly obvious...

"Bend over, spread your cheeks and give me two good coughs"

Then it drops right into 'When Will They Shoot?' with no pause.  The Queen 
sample is the first GOOD Queen sample I've ever heard in a hip-hop song, 
the 'We Will Rock You' stamp.  That sample works very appropriately with 
the X-Clan snatch -

"Stomping, walking in my big black boots"
followed by a voice saying
"But when will the shoot?"

Ice Cube explains himself to those who didn't about him and his fiery 
attitude, with lyrics like

"Ice Cube is outgunned
 What is the outcome?
 Will they do me like Malcolm?...

 But I'm the O.G. and I bust back
 (Boom Boom)            bust back
 (Boom Boom)           peel a cap"

In other words, Cube ain't taking no shit.  He has a nice bit of lyrics 
aimed at his 'bitch' critics as well...

"A women is my manager, not in the kitchen
 So would you please quit bitchin"

And he gives his props where props is due...

"You missed!  And didn't hit the Lench Mob either
 (Guerillas in tha Mist) Without jungle fever"

Following this dope cut is another skit featuring interviewers and 
interviewees discussing why Ice Cube is 'controversial'.

"What is he saying that you have a problem with?"

These three cuts are a good warm-up, but the intense 'Wicked' still blows 
you away.  Don Jaguar enhances the track with his skillful reggae chats, 
and Ice Cube's lyrics are (as always) sharp and to the point.

"Looking for the ones that did it
 But like En Vogue, no you're never gonna get it
 Cause I'm the one with the fat mad skillz
 And I won't choke like the Buffalo Bills...

 Do up Daryl Gates
 But is Willie Williams
 Down with the pilgrims?
 Just a super slave
 We'll have to break his ass off
 like Super Dave"

As 'Black Koreaa' predicted the L.A. rebellion, you wonder if 'Wicked' 
might not be another prediction...

Afterwards it breaks into 'Now I Gotta Wet 'cha', which is not as intense 
as 'Wicked', but still a good track

"Even if I miss, you don't have a chance
 You'll still piss in your pants"

Not that I mean to downplay the last song, but "The Predator" does a better 
job of getting my attention.  It features the now ironic chorus

"Eat 'em up yum in your Ford
 Muthafuck Billboard and the editor
 Here comes The Predator"

What can you say?  Cube outshines nearly every hip-hop artist.

The surprise song of the tape comes next, it's called "Today Was a Good 
Day"

"Today I didn't even have to use my A.K.
 I gotta say it was a good day"

The mellow groove is reminescent of Dead Homiez and Lord Have Mercy, yet it 
works better here than on either of those other two.  This song really 
comes off well.

There is a drastic change up here... it goes into "We Had to Tear this M.F. 
Up"

"The filthy devil tried to kill me
 When the news gets to the hood the niggaz will be
 Out of their cayun pepper plus bust
 Kicking up dust is a must
 I can't stand a cracker in a blue uniform
 Stick a nigga like a unicorn..."

On and on.  Cube really gets ferocious, starting out with the same rhyme he 
used on 'You Can Get the Fist'.  Once again Cube slams.

Side two starts out with the into, then breaks into "Dirty Mack" with a 
cameo by J-Dee of LM.

I don't know about the rest of y'all but this song was to me the most 
average on the tape.  It gets maybe a four at best.

Then comes a song called "Don't Trust 'Em" which, if it weren't for 
Penthouse Players Clique qould probably be called "Trust No Bitch".  THis 
one is very hardcore and will undoubtedly have the p.c. people upset.  But 
hey, I love it!  Six outta six here.

Three more cuts are worth mentioning.  One is the smooth "Gangsta 
Fairytale2" which kicks a phat nursery rhyme 'bout the hood.  Then there is 
the extrordinary "Check Yo Self"

"Ya better check yaself before ya wreck yaself
 Cause shotguns bullets are bad for ya health"

"Sittin in the House of Pain
 And no I'm not the butler
 I cut your head cut chop"

Last but not least is "Who Got the Camera" which uses a P.E. 'Megablast' 
sample in an innovative and hard hitting way.

Lastly is another skit/song about cops, very anti cop here.

"What kind of a cop killer are you?"

So in conclusion, I gotta say this is a very phat tape.  Since The Source 
didn't review it in the new issue w/ Run-DMC on da cover, it'll be 
interesting to see how they review it next month (especially since they 
gave Kool G Rap 3.5 outta 5, and I give him 5.5 outta 6).

"Cop Killer" Aftershocks
.
Labels asking rap artists to remove controversial tracks from albums
.
by Kim Neely

On the heels of the controversy over the Body Count song "Cop Killer,"
other artists on labels owned or distributed by Time Waner have been
asked to alter or remove cop-related tracks from their forthcoming
releases.
    In at least one case, the big chill has transcended the Time Warner
umbrella:  A&M Records rapper Tragedy, a.k.a. Intelligent Hoodlum,
agreed to remove the song "Bullet" (containing the lyric "If you ever,
ever put a nightstick up in my head, I'm gonna shoot your motherfucking
ass dead") from his upcoming album, _Black Rage_.  But the majority of
affected artists record for labels affiliated with Time Warner.  At
press time the casualty list included Boo-Yaa Tribe, which was asked to
delete the song "Shoot 'Em Down" from its forthcoming EP on the
Elktra-distributed Hollywood Basic Records;  rap act Juvenile Committee,
which was advised by Warner Bros. to re-record "Justice for the Hood," a
track from its debut album; and Kool G Rap and DJ Polo, whose album
_Live and Let Die_ was rejected for distribution by Warner Bros.
following a company review meeting.  Warner-distributed Tommy Boy
Records also dropped the Boston rap unit Almighty RSO, whose song "One
in the Chamba" was denounced by the Boston Police Patrolman's
Association for allegedly condoning violence against officers--although
Tommy Boy has said that Almighty RSO's lyrics were not a factor in the
group's being dropped.
    "If you want me to say,'We're not putting out records that have cop
killing, and if they do, we're gonna drop the artist,' I'm not gonna say
that, 'cause I don't think it's true," said Warner Bros. spokesman Bob
Merlis.  "There's increased sensitivity throughout the industry, and the
increased sensitivity that we feel we've tried to convey to our artists.
 We've always imparted a cautionary note when we've thought that the
marketability of a given record ws dubious because of content.  This is
nothing new."
    Although Merlis said he finds it disturbing that the protests by
police organizations over "Cop Killer" have had such a squelching effect
on the industry, he doesn't feel that the artists in question ar being
strong-armed.  "The artist is always involved in these decisions," said
Merlis.  "It's not unilateral."

I hope y'all like this.  I'd like to see the C.O.R.E. members contribute 
reviews of tapes, both new and old hip-hop.  Also, lyrics to be printed in 
C.O.R.E. would be pretty phat, especially for songs that fit as one of our 
themes.  Lyrics for Crossover and In The Trunk would be greatly 
appreciated..  One other thing -- if you like it, please tell others!  
Let's keep this C.O.R.E. thing going for '93.  PEace y'all, and I'm out!
