Reviews - "Trespass", the movie
from Rolling Stone -- Feb. 4, 1993
(reprinted without permission)

Trespass 

Critics mostly dissed Walter Hill's hip-hop take on John Huston's Forties 
classic _The Treasure of the Sierra Madre_.  Early box-office returns 
indicate audiences know better.  _Trespass_ is an action powerhouse, 
brimming with high style and low cunning.  The script, by Bob Gale and 
Robert Zemeckis, is merely servicable, but Hill directs with a ballsy zest 
missing since the glory days of _The Warriors_ and _48 HRS_.

In _Treasure_, Humphrey Bogart and Tim Holt dug for gold in Mexico.  In 
_Trespass_, William Sadler and Bill Paxton find a map to a gold stash in a 
gutted Illinois factory.  Bogie and Holt fought bandits, lead by the 
chilling Alfonso Bedoya.  But Bedoya's a wimp compared with Ice Cube and 
Ice-T, playing crime lords who can draw a cellular phone (to close a drug 
dealer) as fast as a gun (to close an argument).  It's a standoff until the 
violence escalates and Art Evans -- tops as a squatter modeled on Walter 
Huston's crafty old prospector in _Treasure_ -- gets the last laugh.  Both 
Ices are dynamite, giving _Trespass_ the poetry and potency of rap.

        AMG for the nine-three
        Lord Finesse wins again
        Sir MixALot rippin

Lowlights  : Of all the new P.E. songs...
        Ice-T is falling off
        Black Sheep - good song, but...
        King of the Street - not!
        
Part two of the Trespass review special features this mixed bag of hip-hop 
songs.  Some of these are destined to be underground hits, and others... 
well, ya moms always said if you can't say anything nice don't say 
anything.  Which means I can at least skip reviewing the P.E. track.  After 
all, we've all seen what the Source had to say about it -- 

"Gotta Do What I Gotta Do (is) surprisingly average.
 'I gotta do what they don't like,' Chuck drowsily rhymes,
 'Cause I gotta mic'.

But at least the first track helps offset this dissapointment.  Thankfully, 
Ice-T comes off on this track... something which I believe is entirely 
because Cube was there.  Even so, Cube totally outshines his partner in 
crime.

Here's a good rhyme (Ice-T)

"This is my shit, my hood, my turf
 my gold, my grip, whatevah the fuck it's worth"

And here's a great rhyme -- it looks good on paper, but you really have to 
hear Cube's intense pitch-shifting off-beat flow to get the feel.

"Take a good look at my motherfuckin jack-up
 About to feel the wrath of a greedy ass cracker
 Pile of snow, so you know the hoes stand out
 Coming in my hood with his hand-out
 Tryin to get over on the black
 But the motherfuckin mack
 Will put a fuckin slug in his back
 And with the boom-ping-ping
 It ain't no thing to blast
 On greedy motherfucker that trespass"

Don't get me wrong, T is good, and ya can't help putting these two 
together, but Cube owns this song lock, stock, and barrel.

Anyway, you press the FF button to skip Public Enemy... while you're at it 
skip Ice-T with Daddy Nitro, a.k.a. "Depths of Hell".  The bass is weak, 
the P.E. style whine is the worst attempt to use it I've heard yet, and 
Daddy Nitro sounds more like Baby BlastingCaps.  If it comes to battle of 
the guest chatters, Cube's Don Jaguar would kick shit all over the place.  
I don't know what is wrong with T... he was once the articulate rapper of 
'Lethal Weapon' and 'Freedom of Speech', but somewhere after "O.G. Original 
Gangster" he fell off hard.  Must've spent too much time trying to be heavy 
metal headbanger...

Two tracks this weak?  Are you ready to sell this tape back to the stor for 
half price?  Don't give up yet, cause it's about to get a whole lot 
better... it's time for MixaLot to start rippin.  I know some of y'all 
think he's too pop, and that his flow is goofy, but HELL with it!  I like 
him!  Any man who makes a song like 'Hip-Hop Soldier' gets props in my 
book... and 'I Check My Bank' may be his best song yet.

Or, as Mix says,

"When your platinum niggaz start dissin
 Record companies think your missin
 But I'm back, I'm back,
 I'm back and I gotta bigger gat"

And the sentiments of this song are very much on target

"A word to the bouregois fuck all y'all..."

Now this one might cause some disagreement, but that's nothing compared to 
what I'm about to say about Penthouse Players Clique.  Now, I'll agree with 
anyone that that first album was weak (I only liked 'Explanation of a Playa 
on the last one) but for whatever reason 'I'm a Playa (bitch)' clicks with 
me.  It's not so much the lyrics, so I won't quote them, I think it's more 
the funky track and the hook of the chorus.  4.5 out of six.

Last but not least on side one is 'On the Wall' by Black Sheep.  A good 
song, but the track is so muddy it distorts Dres lyrics... here is some I 
can make out

"Yo it's not easy at the top
 Which is why we play the back
 Not to say that we don't shine
 In fact, to be exact
 It's a one-sided coin
 Gotta know how to flip it..."

And so on... it's better than 'I'm a Playa' but still only a 4.5

Let's just fast forward from here on out and mention the few cuts left that 
I like (remember the don't say anything rule?)

'Gotta Get Over (taking loot)' by Gangstarr is phat.  The track is destined 
to be a classic (as all Gangstarr tracks are) and the hook is my favorite

"Makin moves I'm never fakin
 cause the loot is for the takin"

6 outta 6 here!  It slams!  Even slow Gangstarr jams still kick shit!  
Okay, the two cuts I want to mention are as follows.  First is Lord Finesse 
'You Know What I'm About' which as K-Mello already stated is a slamming 
track.  Forgive me, but why does everybody sleep on him?  Not only is he 
good on this track, but I even saw him freestyle hard on YMR!  THis brother 
ranks tops in the underrated dept.

And, if you heard the Juice sndtrk., you will understand the Chorus

"Knockin niggaz off, knockin niggaz out
 You know what I'm about"

5 outta 6 on that one, and last but not least on my least is WC and the 
Maad Circle's 'Quick Way Out'.  

"I'm looking for a quick way out motherfucker"

Why quote all the lyrics?  This one you should hear for yourself... falls 
somewhere between a 4.5 and 5 but I haven't decided which.

In summary - If you like these groups get it, if you like West Coast flava 
get it, but if you do at least be careful not to get the censored version.  
PEace and I'm out.


SECTION FIVE -- 5

Tribe Called Quest Interview from RapSheet magazine
Feb 1993 pg 16-17
By Gerrie E. Summers
(reprinted without permission)
-------------

        If you have difficulty trying to fit A Tribe Called Quest into a
neat little category, you're not alone--they have a problem with that 
too, and frankly would rather not have to deal with the question.
        "We get asked that question every year and every year we have the 
same answer,"  Tribe's Ali says dully.  "We cannot describe our music."
        "It's just there.  It's just music," says Q-Tip.  "It's just some 
hip-hop, you know.  It's hard to catagorize it,"  and besides, "when you 
put yourself into a category you limit yourself."
        One reason that Tribe may be difficult to categorize is their 
change in styles between the first LP, _Instinctive Travels and the
Paths of Rhythm_--an East Coast underground hit--and _Low End Theory_.
Instead of recording _Instinctive Travels Part II_ or abandoning hip hop 
for a more profitable path, Tribe switched gears.
        "The first album was more of a learning experience," says Phife,
"and when the second album came around, we know what we wanted to do.
We had good control over [the production].  As long as it feels good 
when it hits, we don't care how other people think."
        Sure the jazz thing was in effect on both albums, but Tribe
definitely flipped the script in some other areas.  Where the first one
was abstract and esoteric, with personal lyrics only the group could
understand, the second was more street accessible.  While the rapping
styles on the first were plain, the second had the trio kicking styles
in all types of directions.  And while the samples on _Low End Theory_
may not have been clearly recognizable to many rap fans, the beats were
crazy--not dance, not jeep, just plain hype.
        Along with the Jungle Brothers and De La Soul, fellow members of 
the Native Tongue posse, Tribe helped open up hip hop to another level,
one of adventurous experimentation that has been continued with groups
like Das EFX and Arrested Development.  Experimentation has been an 
uncertain road to take in hip hop, where followers often have a confused
definition of what is truly hip hop and hardcore.  Groups like PM Dawn
and even De La Soul's hip hop legitimacy  have been put in question,
especially when the mainstream embraced them.  PM Dawn never wanted to
be labelled as a hip hop or rap act, and De La, who suffered from an
image problem caused in part by the acronym D.A.I.S.Y. (Da Inner Sound
Ya'll), succumbed to the pressure by recording a more "hardcore"
follow-up to their critcally acclaimed _3 Feet High and Rising_ called,
not suprisingly, _De La Soul Is Dead_.
        Thus far, Tribe has not had this problem.  With "Scenario," they
attracted mainstream white America without making the hip hop crowd ill.
But Tribe did not crossover, a new audience crossed over to them.
        "Going commercial or crossing over is changing your music style,"
says Ali, "and 'Scenario' is just a street raw record.  It's just that
different kids are opening themselves up to hip hop a little more.  So
the real hard stuff is making it.  It's going real mainstream, so we're
just keeping it the same, keeping it street."
        Although introspective Tribe-like hip hop slowly rose in the world
of rap, the biggest trend in '92 was still gangster rap.
        "Everybody's just on the gangster tip.  Everybody's got a gun in
their hand," says Ali.
        Q-Tip adds, "Everybody's talking about shooting somebody and how
bad they are.  Actually they probably would think twice about shooting
somebody if they had to."  Q-Tip also notes that many acts are cropping
up that are inspired by Das EFX and their vocal style.
        The impact of female rappers, however, has been on the decline for
awhile.  An influx of female rappers in the mid-'80's made most of them
nothing more than exploited novelty acts, though Q-Tip allows that Lyte
is the best female rapper.
        "You know why women don't really come off in rap?" Phife begins,
"Because women always stress the point that they are women."  Although he 
understands a female rapper's need to prove that she is a legitimate
rhymer in a male-dominated field, gender shouldn't factor in the makings
of a skilled MC.  "You're supposed to be an artist.  So if a woman just
came out and just rhymed and did her thing without addressing the fact
that she's a female in a man-dominated business, she'd probably get a
lot further."
        Q-Tip agrees.  "Lyte doesn't address that shit and she's the best
one because she looks at herself as an MC...Women support hip-hop more
than men do, because guys don't buy albums.  Girls go out and buy shit 
and they buy tickets to the shows and that's why Lyte is so popular. 
She addresses herself as an MC and women spectators want to be 
entertained just like a man wants to be entertained."
        For 1993, Q-Tip predicts that Large Professor, Nasty Nas and 
again, Naughty By Nature will be large, while the subject matter for 
most rap will be darker.  "As the economy and society gets more and more 
wretched we'll keep hearing more and more dark music."
        Tribe can't, or won't predict what the next Tribe album will be 
like.  But the pressure is on.  "We get a lot of pressure, but what you 
got to do is keep checking yourself," says Q-Tip, "and the pressure is 
good pressure because it make you try that much harder to do well.  It's 
not that we try to set out to do better than our last effort.  We just 
try to make good music and that pressure just keeps us in tune to that, 
so we don't get pushed off the trail."

SECTION SIX -- 6

Stranded on Death Row by The Dogg Pound
(contributed by MC Flash X)

Intro : Bushwick Bill

Yes, it is I says me
And although me
By morning three, cause they're weak
(laughter)
Yes, yo!, I'm in the house now for sure
Because I wanna talk about the hearts of men
Who knows what evil lurks within them
But lets take a travel down the blindside
And see what we find on this...
Path...
Called...

Verse One : Korrupt

Stranded on Death Row, so duck when I swing my shit
I get rugged like brawl head wrecks with fat tracks that fits
The gangsta type, what I recite's kinda lethal
Niggaz know, the flow that I kick, there's no refill
I'm murderin niggaz, Yo, and maybe because of the tone
I kicks my grip, the mic and kick shit
Niggaz can't fuck with
So remember I go hardcore, and slam
Nuff respect like a sensei, ba-bash like Van Damme
So any nigga that claim they bossin
What don't you bring your ass on over to Kris-Slaus Slausson
Take a walk through the hood, and we up to no good
Slangin on things like a real ho
G should, I'm stackin and mackin and packin a ten so
When you're slippin, I slip the clip in
But ain't no steady tripppin
Cause it's Death Row, rollin like the mafia
Think about whoopin some ass, but what the fuck stoppin ya
Ain't nathin but a buster
I'm Stranded on Death Row for pumpin slugs in motherfuckers
Now you know you're outdone
Feel the shotgun, Korrupt inmate cell block one


Verse Two : RBX

No prevention from this mention of sorts
Your're a victim, from my driveby of thoughts
No extensions, all attempts are to fail
Blinded by the light, it's time you learn braile
>From the lunatic, I death like arsenic
When I kick up wicked raps
That the grain will hit the scratch
With treachery, my literary form will blast
And totally surpass the norm
Not a storm, zero, make it, many storms
When I'm vexed, I fly leg necks and arms
In this dimension, I'm the presenter
And the inventor, and the tormentor
Deranged, like the hillside strangler
MC mangler, tough like Wrangler
I write a rhyme, hard as concrete
Step to the heat and get burned like mesquite
So what you wanna do
The neverator RBX, cell block two

Verse Three : Rage

Rage, lyrical murderer
Stranded on Death Row
And now I'm servin a lifetime sentence
There'll be no repentence
Since it's the life that I choose to lead
I plead guilty
On all counts let the ball bounce where it may
It's just another clip into my AK
Buck em down with my underground tactics
Facts and stacks of clips on my matress
Bed frame thereUs another dead pain
Layin lain with the shame, whoUs to blame
Me, the lady of Rage
On when IUm comin from the D-E-A-T-Hin
R-O-W takin, no shit
So flip and youUre bound to get dropped
ItUs 187 on motherfuckers donUt stop
Handcuffed as I bust thereUll be no debate
ItUs Rage, from cell block eight

Verse Four : Snoop Doggy Dogg

And yo steppin through the fog
And creepin through the smog
ItUs the number one nigga from the hood
Doggy Dogg
Makin videos, now I stay in Hollywood
Bustin raps for my snaps now they call me Eastwood
Dre is the doctor and my homey little nigga
Warren G is my hand and my hand's on the trigga
Shootin at the hoes with the game that I got
Sent to death row cause I wanted to make a quick one servin my rocks
And I'm still, servin for mines, peace
To my motherfuckin homies doin time
In the pen and the county jail
Moppin with your blues on, mad as hell
And you say yeah fuck the police
And all the homies on the streets is all about peace
And it's drivin the cops crazy
But ain't nuttin but a black thing bay-bee, uhhh
I'm not flaggin, but I'm just saggin
I betcha don't wanna see the D-O double G
And you can't see, the D-R to the E
Or my motherfuckin homey D.O.C.
You know you can't fuck with my motherfuckin DJ
That's my homey and we call him Warren G
Yeah, and you don't stop
Doggy Dogg break em down with the motherfuckin DoggPound
That's the only way we'll beat em man
We gotta smoke em, then choke em
Like the motherfuckin peter man
It's like three and to the two
And two and to the one
Cell block four peace Doggy Dogg's done

Outtro : Bushwick Bill

Yo, now you know the path I'm on
You think you're strong, see if you can travel on
Cause only the weak, will try to speak
Those who are quiet, will always cause riots
There's three types of people in the world
Those who don't know what happened
Those who wonder what happened
And people like us from the streets that make things happen!

SECTION SEVEN -- 7

I would once again like to thank everybody for their support of this 
project.  If you have any comments on the newsletter or other things you 
believe C.O.R.E. should do, feel free to let me know.  One thing I would 
like to remind everybody was that the original idea was for HardC.O.R.E. to 
be "very creative with articles 'n shit".  I've got commitments from a few 
people, but the more, the better.  I hope we can turn this into something 
really unique in hip-hop.  Thanks again y'all, and I'm audi 5!
