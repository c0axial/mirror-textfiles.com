Article        --  Hip-Hop Exchange

Yo, I just wanted to thank you for sending me the HardC.O.R.E.  electronic 
mag.  It slams like who?  Like Bam-Bam, the kid from Bedrock! The P.E. 
discography was very appreciative as well; good to see what I gots, whatI 
don't gots, and what I needs!  Know what I meanz?  I'd like to check out 
the Pete Rock special remixes of Shut 'em Down that were on the UK release 
that US andCanada didn't get to hear... anywayz:Suggestion: In order to 
spread the world of hip-hop across the world... why not form an 
tape-exchange type thing... where readers can exchange pre-mixed tapes, 
or12" special remixes, etc...  I'm all up for that...  I've been buyin hip 
hop since back in the day... about 400 cassettes, a bunch of CDz and couple 
crates of12"s...  What do ya think?  Peace-out.    

[DJ Tagline]

{editor} -- So what do y'all think?  I thought it sounded like a pretty 
good idea, and I'd even be willing to help it along by posting a list
in HardC.O.R.E. of those who wish to exchange tapes.  If you  do, let me 
know and I will set it up, or if you have a better idea of how to organize 
it let me know!


SECTION FOUR   --  4
Review         --  King Tee, _The Triflin Album_

Review scale :

6.  Phat  - Ten years from now this shit'll still be so dope!
5.  Funky - Ownership is the difference between a mack and a mark
4.  Fine  - If your pockets are fat get it, but don't panic if you don't
3.  Fair  - It has some potential hits, and at least it doesn't stink
2.  Flat  - Somebody explain to me why this person even tried?!
1.  Flunk - The ultimate diss... PM Dawn sounded better

Lyrical Content - Phat... King Tee mixes his metaphors and messages well
                          No song is without purpose or a point
Musical Content - Funky.. Some old stuff, but it's still hooked up lovely
                          Including the 'At Your Own Risk' rm was a nice 
                          touch
Parental Advise - 6/6.... Don't play this for your Grandmother
                          Don't play it for Chuck D either
Overall rating  - Funky.. Hardcore hip-hop fans should bumrush for this 
                          tape!

Highlights : King Tee returns with a vengence
             The Alkaholiks rip the shit up
             Ice Cube has some 'Wicked' cameos

Lowlights  : Pass the 40 and call Chuck D, but no biggie for most
             Tee sometimes sounds the same as Cube
             A posse cut that smells!

Drunk Side                      Sober Side

Drunk Tekneek                   *Where'sa Hoe Sat
*I Gotta Call Earl              A Hoe B-4 the Homie
I Got It Bad Y'all              Blow My Sox Off
On the Rox                      *Where'sa Hoe Sat (cont.)
Just Flauntin                   The Triflin Nigga
At Your Own Risk (Buddha Mix)   Black Together Again
*King Tee's Beer Stand          Bust Dat Ass
Got Tha Fat Joint               

Well, if you have a problem with St. Ides, don't buy this album... 
otherwise prepare yourself for a phat ride to the drunk side.

It starts out nicely with 'Drunk Tekneek', a slow jam with some phat 
samples from Del, and LL Cool J.

'E-Swift's got his hand on the glock
 Taking some young girls cock'

Just to give you an idea.  Mostly he raps about his comeback and how funky 
he and posse are, and it works.  This track gets a 'Funky' rating.

Next up is 'I Gotta Call Earl', which isn't really a jam, just filler 
between 'Drunk Tekneek' and 'I Got It Bad Y'all'.  Search me why it's on 
here, other than to set the 'drunk' mood.

Then all of a sudden

'Ladiezz and gentulmen...
 That nigga King Tee and the al-cum-a-holiks'

And that favorite track off mine on the tape kicks in... with the 
alkaholiks ripping some wicked rhymes

'It took a long time for the people to hear me
 Seems like I been rappin since my birth in '69
 Sorry to keep you waitin
 I run rhymes like Walter Payton...

 On the mic I get wicked
 Like Wilson Pickett'

And there is the reoccuring refrain that could be called 'Alkaholik's 
Theme'

'(What you bout to do?)         Bout to rip
 (Where you goin to?)           To the tip
 Some rappers use the word funky to loosely
 And just how many niggaz say they kick it like Bruce Lee
 (What's your favorite brew?)   Old E
 (And what it make you do?)     Go pee
 It used to be about ryhmes, all about rhymes
 Now rappers rearranging, and chagin like times
 I got it bad y'all, I got it bad y'all
 When it comes to the pen and the pad y'all'

To sum it up, this jam slams!  Definitely a 'phat' track!

Next up is 'On The Rox', a jam which does indeed take out '187 Proof' as 
the best use of alcoholic metaphors.

'I knew this nigga named Johnny Walker
 A night stalker, a big shit talker...'

Why spoil it?  You get the idea... this track is not quite 'phat', but 
definetly a 'funky' jam.

Next up is 'Just Flauntin', the first low ebb of the tape, albeit not the 
lowest dip.  Basically it isn't the lyrics, I just felt like the tracks was 
wasted, the it needed some more horns 'n shit and it would've come off 
better.  A 'fine' cut at best.

Then you catch the switch quick fast.  The 'At Your Own Risk' bonus is 
truly appropriate, because this is a slamming Marley Marl remix.

'The K-I-N-G-T super cool mack daddy
 I drive a caddy, and yes I'm livin fatly
 Had me on stage in a rage
 Yellin bout what I know, that's how I get paid'

This cut also definetly gets a 'funky' rating, as does the next mini-cut, a 
St. Ide's commercial that Tee did with Cube.  This is the track that 
emphasized to me that sometimes Tee sounds like Cube, but mostly he stands 
out... it only happens now and then.  And of course Tee doesn't have Cube's 
awesome flow.

'Once again it's on
 I'm headed out the front though
 Ice Cube in the glass house
 headed for the store
 To get a beer that's better than the rest
 The S-T-Period-I-D-E to the S
 And it'll put hair on your chest...'

Et cetera.  Next up is the second low point of the album, a posse cut 
called 'Got Tha Fat Joint'.  Ya know, I thought Mad Kap was supposed to be 
all that and a bowl of cole slaw, but he sounds unoriginal and uninspired, 
and so does this whole song.  I'm not even gonna quote this one.  It gets a 
'Fair' at best, and in my opinion is the one true FF song of the tape.

The sober side may have less to do with liquor, but it's just as funky if 
not more so.  'Where Sa Hoes At' is a strange cut, but funky.  Whomever is 
rapping sounds like that voice from _Death Certificate_ that kicked the 
'Were called jimmy hats, have ya ever seen us' verse.

When I saw the title 'A Hoe B-4 the Homie', I thought it was gonna be all 
on bitches the suck a nigga dick, and why rappers love them.  But it's not 
'Hoe Be For'..., it's 'Hoe Before'!  Surprise!  This phat posse cut (that 
almost seems to be two songs) is about those who put their women before 
their homies.  Once again Cube steals the show...

'I told them to kidnap the hoe
 And they came back with two'

Once again, I don't wanna spoil this cut.  Go hear this 'Funky' jam... it's 
phizat and all that!

Next, another short 'Where Sa Hoes At' skit, then the last low point of the 
album, a song called 'The Triflin Nigga', which isn't bad, just not fresh.  
A 'Fine' cut at best.

Next up is 'Black Together Again', which jacks the sample from that dope 
L.A. rebellion relief cut 'You Can Get the Fist'.  Very funky

'And all the king's hoes, and all the king's men
 Couldn't put this shit black together again...
 The judge has no love for chocolate fudge
 He only likes Vanilla
 But we do all the work like Cinderella'

Once again, a phat cut.  The album closes out with 'Bust Dat Ass', a 
gangsta cut about exactly what it says, a 'Fair cut'

Overall this album is well worth the duckats, especially if you like King 
Tee's flow and are a fan of classic Tee cuts like 'Played Like a Piano'  
Spare some $$$ and bumrush the store for this one!

Lyrics         --  Das Efx, _Hard Like a Criminal_

Verse One

Well biggedy bust a mover

Verse Two

They got me upstate troop, so fuck it
In penile, I'm hard as a fuckin brick I wreck shop
Money grip, I'm up in the yard fightin kids till I drop
But, I'm out now, so fuckers around the way are sweatin my peoples
Not worried about a new jack black my shit is diezel
Cause I pack, steel, I got the back, wheel
And plus I got the Yung and the Resless watchin my back, still
Because I'm runnin the ave again
I'm back in the game with my neighbor
Up on the ave runnin guns that was to be the new flavor
And I'm wid it, my cousin's throwin a jam tonight I figures
That I'm bringin all my guns and I'm bringin all my niggaz
(Don't go hangin out with no niggaz...-= That's the life, that I lead)
You figgedy fuck around you lay around I told my cousin
First kill the flex, word is born I'ma bug him
We spiggedy spark the buddha now I got the devil in me
I'm sick, quick to smoke a nigga like a chimney
I'm packin a clip, ready to flip, just me and my friends
Twenty deep and two deep, a B-M-W and a benz, rollin

Verse Three

Brrr, it's cold as shit, liggedy split I think we're here G

Yo Stevie, remember the crib she was tellin us that she chilled in
Well there go the block she live on and I think that's her buildin

Let the games begin I'm packin my steel with nuff dreads
In front of the buldin shit's thick cause all I could see was nuff heads
But I know them, we're spiggedy sparkin blunts and squeezin triggers
Bustin caps with my troops and a buncha other niggaz

Figgedy fuck it

Doin a year and a half until my court date


SECTION SIX    --  6
Review         --  King Tee, _The Triflin Album_
                   2Pac, _Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z._

Here's a tip.

Two good projects to buy are as follows.

     a.  King Tee (The Trifflin Album), this is a really good cd
except for maybe two cuts at the most.  All n all, KT really
improved on his skillz as a gangsta rapper.  As an extra, him and
Cube perform a cut together entitled (don't put a ho before a
homie) looped over an old Funkadelic cut (Nappy Dugout).  But
it's still a solid purchase with lots of base.

     b.  2Pac (Strictly for my N.I.G.G.A.S), at first I was not
impressed with it.  After a few more times I became very
delighted that I bought this one.   I guess the last two (2)
years have been tough 2Pac as a solo act.  Lawsuits, bad media,
VP (Vomit/Prick) Dan Quayle. and so on.  It seems that he has the
background for the material he released with stricly black love
of his people.  I didn't buy his first release because he fell
under that Digital Underground, doin the humpty hump type of sell
out cross over shit.  But he did have one cut that I could
identify with (When my Homie Calls).  THis in my opinion was
really tight groove.  Back to the new release.  The music tends
to be on the errie side with a touch of PE flavor.  As an extra,
he does a peice with Ice Cube, T titled: (Some Last Wordz).
Sorry, but this type of style of rapping does not work good with
Ice T.  Cube has perfected his style of hesitant, flow, stammer
to perfection.  2Pac keeps up with tempo, but Ice T needs to
stick with what he's familiar with.  It's worth your money,
quality recording.

SECTION EIGHT  --  8
Closing        --  What comes in HV004 and more

I'm looking forward to some dope articles from Robin L. Gibson and Alex 
Reed (on Lench Mob), plus perhaps another article from the Mack (If ya got one 
homes, I'd appreciate it).  And if I can pick up Tim Dog/KRS-One I'll have 
the lyrics for that.  Until next time, I'm Swayze

Remember -- letters to the editor are always welcome
PEace yo!
