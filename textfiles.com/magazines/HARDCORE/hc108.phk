The C.O.R.E. creed

We at C.O.R.E. support underground hip-hop (none of that crossover
bullshucks). That means we also support the 1st Amendment and the
right to uncensored music.

Some Shots from the Industry.
Relayed by Mike C

Public Enemy just finished a trip to the motherland.  Along with
singer/actor Isaac Hayes, Public Enemy was warmly welcomed by Brother
Akbar Muhammed in Ghana.  The Ghana representative of the Nation of
Islam,  Brother Akbar also represented the government and thge Pan
African Historical Theater Festival.  In an eight day program, PE and
Hayes traveled to the Cape Coast Slave Dungeons and put on a show for a
packed house at the University of Ghana, and privately performed for the
President before their grand finaly in front of 60,000.

Nikki D is finishing up her second album.  Eric Sadler, Showbiz, and Sid
Reynolds are all helping her out on the production tip.  She's got a cut
on it with Apache.

Nice and Smooth are rounding out their new album as well in LA.  It'll
be self-produced and, surprisingly, Bobby Brown is helping out.  Teddy
Riley could appear in the credits on this one.  I can't imagine that
these brothers'll go soft, but seeing B.Brown and Teddy in the same
paragraph as Gregg Nice and Smooth Bee isn't exactly encouraging.

Terminator X, as you may have heard, is hooking up some new artists who
will appear on his new joint.  Juicehead, Punk Barbarians, Godfathers of
Threat, 8-Ball, and Life will be on it.  If I didn't know better, I'd
think Terminator was working on a new death-metal/hip hop album.

Slick Rick has finished his new album called "Behind Bars."  9 tracks
will appear on this LP, as well as a bonus cut.  Pete Rock, Marley
Marl, Easy Mo Bee, Large Professor, Epitome of Scratch, and Mic Profesah
will set him up with the beats on his second album since he was
incarcerated.

Father MC will be dropping the "MC" from his name for his forthcoming
alubm _69_ which is set to drop November 10.  The title song is produced
by Teddy Riley.  Other producer's on this project will include Eddie F.,
Clark Kent, Pete Rock, and Ski from Original Flavor.

Daddy O's new solo effort entitled _You can be a Daddy, but Never a
Daddy-O_ will be written lyrically by him, but the production duties
will be left to others in the industry.  The first single is "Brooklyn
Bounce" and the album will drop October 5.

The first artist from Parrish Smith's "PMD Records" is Top Quality,
whose first cut, to be released in a month or so, is titled "Magnum
Opus."  Tammy "Sunkist" Greer, the promo rep for his label has been
hanging out with Masta Ace and the Alkaholiks on the recent tour that
just finished up at the end of August.  According to Greer, every show
slammed, and she had a "great" time.

Elektra representatives claim that the year delay of the new Leaders of
the New School album is because of "clearing samples."  The first track
has had a limited 12" release for major radio stations, and is entitled
"What's Next."

New Del the Funkee Homosapien 12" will be released on the Elektra label
as well in early October, although one should take into account the
"Elektra Factor," and should add on 6 months to a year to compensate for
this mysterious syndrome.

And remember, don't sleep on the Troubleneck Brothers.

*The Atlanta Scene*

Yo, this was a crazy couple of weeks.  First, let me say
congratultions to Fourtie for makin' the unsigned hype in The
Source.  I predicted good stuff in my last edition and like the
Last Dragon "SHO' NUFF" it went down.  Also, I shoulda included
this little tidbit in my last edition but it slipped my mind...
C.O.D. is comin "Straight From the Underground" on Select Records. 
I saw the video and it's a good quality one, so you will probably
see it at least on Rap City or the Box.  They used to work with
Easy Lee (Kool Moe Dee's former DJ) and they may still.  I have
just forgotten about C.O.D. lately since they've ben on the DL ever
since they signed with Select a while back. 

The only news this edition is JACK THE RAPPER.  For those who don't
know, Jack the Rapper is a music industry conference that is geared
to urban radio stations and they (the record companies) showcase 
their artists in hopes of collecting aadds to the playlists across
the country.  I've attended the convention for the past three years
now and it's always interesting to say the least.  It seems to be
more geared toward rap music these days as there are two nights of
Marathon rap showcases known as "Rappin' in the Ayem" (they usually
don't start till at least midnight).  Let me take you through the
weekend in as best a chronological order as I can. 

Thursday:  I had to work so I didn't get down to the Marriot until
about midnight, which I don't think mattered all that much as
everyone was still just arriving.  The first person I saw was Lin
Que and I was goin to approac her to ask her about working with
Lyte on Duke Da Moon management, and if Lyte was around cuz' I had
met Lyte two years ago at JTR and hung out a little wit her. I
hadn't seen her since then, and Lyte was/is crazy cool, one of the
nicer people with deals that I've met in the industry.  However,
she got lost in the crowd that was headed into one of the Marquis
ballrooms, and I didn't see her again for the whole weekend, or
Lyte.  I ran into LeShaun but I don't like her stuff and saw no
real reason to talk to her cuz' she stirked me as someone who would
think I'm tryin' to sweat her if I just struck up a casual
conversation. I was just coolin' and enjoyin' the showcase... the
highlight performances were Poor Righteous Teachers, the
Alkaholiks, and 2Pac.  Nemesis and some others were also on, but I
don't really remember the rest as this was the shorter showcase.  I
went over to the area where they were playin' videos cuz' there
were some new ones that I hadn't seen and some other promotional
clips.  I saw clips from Digital Underground (cool), Pharcyde's
"other fish" (alright), K7 (hey I liked the video although the song
is trying to go hot 100), C.O.D. (I thought the video was good
visually but that's all I can say without doggin' a local crew),
and some others, but the best clip was from L.O.N.S., "What's
Next?", probably just cuz' I was glad to see them back.  Anyway, I
was gettin' into the video and all, and me and the two guys on my
left were mad bobbin' our heads so I looked over to see the fellas
who were gettin into it as much as me, and it was B-Real and Dicno,
all smiles like me.  After the video I just said what's up and they
broke out somewhere together.  Then I sw my man Subtle T who does
"the Beatbox" on Thursday nights, 9-11 P.M., on my school's radio
station WREK 91.1 (Georgia Tech) and we just kicked it for a
while.  Then I met DawgCatcher from C.O.D. and congratulated him on
his release from Select.  Then as always my man Hafez Harris found
me (he's always in the place and he always sneaks up on me), and of
course he was tryin' to collect contacts for his house music. 
Finally, before I broke out I saw Logic from Y'all So Stupid and I
had to talk with him and let him know that I thought their album
was nice adn to keep it up, so we talked for a little bit about
some old shows, and then I had to break.  

Friday:  The craziest!  I was just chillin' upstairs and watchin'
all the people and talkin' to a few.  A lot of hopeful artists were
tryin' to give me their demos because I had the Mercury VIP pass in
effect (props to Barry for that hook up), so I had to explain that
I wasn't with Mercury but E.C.T. Entertainment and would be glad to
take their demo, but politely suggested that if they had a limited
number not to give them to me as the E.C.T. is still pretty small
(right now).  I said what's up to Shock G, Kid, and returned a hard
look to Big Daddy Kane himself.  I felt bad for Snoop Doggy Dogg
because he couldn't get ten feet without brothers tryin' to give
him tapes for Dre or gettin' their picture taken with him.  Talib
Shabazz from another local hip-hop radio show (actually two, Da
Bomb, and Rhythm and Vibes, on WRAS 88.5 Saturday 8-10 P.M., and
Sunday 10 P.M. - 2 A.M. respectively) came over where I was sittin
and began talkin to Lord Digga from Masta Ase, Inc.  I didn't even
know I was sittin' by him so Talib did introductions, and then he
asked me how things were going with the Natural (who E.C.T. is
producing).  After that, finally, B-right (my potnah who's the only
one left in Tribal Science, but he'll come back his new shit is mad
fly) came upstairs from watchin' Tony Tone Toni, and Royal T was
with him to my surprise (Royal T is another artist down with East
Coast Tribe but not on the compilation EP).  B asked me if I had
seen Trendz of Culture yet, 'cuz we were lookin' for them
especially to talk to them about workin' with Nastee's Aunt, the
NATURAL.  As asoon as he asked me that I saw Grapevine and MO.L,
and we talked to them for a while about the Natural and what they
were up to.  They said they were already done with their second
album and about to start some more tracks.  Next, Royal T suggested
that we go up to the 40th floor to DJ Magic Mike's suite 'cuz there
was a party.  I was with that 'cuz I was hungry and I didn't wanna
pay $2 for the corn dogs that the hotel people were selling with
$1.75 cans of soda.  However, we tried to get on the elevator and
me an' B got left off the first one.  There wasn't another elevator
for at least fifteen minutes so we went downstairs with the
intention of splittin' a plate of chicken fingers and fries, but
when we got downstairs people started runnin' for the doors.  Oh
snap!  What the Hell's goin' on? Things got calm for a minute, then
again Mad People runnin' away from somethin'.  When it calmed again
I spotted this girl that I met a while back at a P.E. concert
(Anastasia) and I was talkin' to her as things got crazy, then
calmed, then crazy, and so on for about three more times (at one
point she had me worried when she said that she thought she had
heard shots).  Anyway from what we could tell the commotion was
that just before the Dogg Pound Showcase (yeah, Dr. Dre's whole
crew), somebody knocked Luke's (yeah that one) hat off of his head
and there was a bunch of people scufflin' with chairs and stuff,
which we should have been able to see because we were less than 100
feet away, but there was just too many people to see through.  FOI
was in the house and there didn't seem to be that much human
damage... the only property damage was the hotel's food stand
(which cancelled our dinner).  This post-poned the showcase for an
hour and a half.  The showcase was great(!) though... it started at
2 A.M. and B-right and I left the ballroom at 7 A.M. on the dot.
Kool DJ Red Alert hosted the whole show.  The lineup was 2Pac
(again?), some crew whose name I didn't catch but they had a mad
DJ,  then the Pharcyde (dope and then some), some Flavor Unit group
with "hey DJ" {editor's note this is Jhane, and the song is "Hey,
Mr. DJ"}, Fat Joe, UltraMagnetic M.C.'s, Wu-Tang Clan, Whodini (oh
yes! memories), Punk Barbarians, Black Moon (with new members...
I'll keep it under my hat and let you be surprised, but they were
kinda weak in terms of live performace), Mad Phlayva (not Dallas'
Mad Flava) and the reason why mad heads stayed was the Kings,
Run-D.M.C.  They showed and proved why they are the best.  It was
truely one of the best nights of hip-hop that I have ever witnessed
and I think that went for almost everybody. 

Saturday:  Me and B-right got some breakfast, went to our
apartments, showered, changed, went back to the Marriot, and took a
small nap over in the lounge with the soft couches.  We got up and
met Prime (formerly of BET he was the original hip-hop
advisor/informer) and a producer named Yahone, and we just sat
around and talked smack about everybody who ever made a record with
a couple of speechless breaks (at least from me) as we watched
Madeline Woods from Video LP pass by where we were sittin' a couple
times in this scandalous outfit.  I said hello but she was talkin'
with B-Real for a spell and later when I saw Sen and Mugg without
B-Real in the same spot they had all been before, Heather Hunter
came over to chat, and I though how nice it must be to have the
number one album in the U.S. (know what I mean?).  Anyway, Prime,
B-right and I went to get some food downstairs, but the free food
line was too long for me so we went downstairs to the trade
displays and my man B-love from BMG hooked us up with crazy samples
(however they weren't all that impressive upon a later listen). We
saw Tip, Phife, Ali and Posdunoos from De La, and we asked when the
new albums were due.  Pos said the single end of August the album
October, pretty much the same for Tribe's stuff but we got a flyer
for that (I wasn't really payin' attention to the dates it was just
an excuse to talk).  We also saw Daddy-O from Stet at the trade
displays.  We went back upstairs and saw Too $hort, Jam Master Jay,
and Hurby Luv Bug.  We met Run and told him how fat his show was
the night (really that morning) before.  We saw Logic again and he
seemed to be having a great time as we were meeting all the Big
Shots.  We left early because we were pretty tired and I always
boycott the Famous Luke Party just as a personal protest to what
Mr. Campbell stands for (I hear that Luke's party is the craziest
and certainly the most popular even every year at JTR). So I left
as everyone was askin' me if they'd see me later.  No that's it for
this year, but it was cool.  Peace.

Well I hate to say it, but there is at least one good thing about
MTV... Yo! MTV Raps on Friday nights (although I wish they'd go
back to EVERY afternoon). And since I've been watching for the past
two weeks, I thought I would post my opinion on some of the new
music/videos. 

First of all, even though Illegal is way too much like Da Youngstaz
(really no difference between the two), I liked the new video "We
Getz Busy".  Erick Sermon hooked the track up lovely and even has a
funky cameo (too bad he didn't produce the whole LP).  The setting is
cool too... just three mean (boys, whatever) in the studio rocking
the mic.  The simplicity of the video and the slamming music, plus
the (hate to say it but) above average lyrical flow make for a sure
fire winner. 

The one y'all been waiting for, L.O.N.S. is back with a passion. 
"What's Next" is a typical L.O.N.S. video... hyper and colorful. 
As usual, Busta Rhymes lyrics are near incomprehensible (but damn
funky despite that).  The rest of the crew shine, and the track is
NOT TO BE FUCKED WITH.  If your head is not bobbin when you watch
this video, have it examined PRONTO! 

And of course, you know De La Soul is in the house.  "Breakadawn" is
just the SMOOVEST of tracks I have heard in a long time, and as
usual the De La flow like water.  There is some interesting
symbolism going on in the video, like De La being trapped at the
bottom of a well/prison... I don't quite follow it but suffice it
to say this is a unique video and a fat track. 

The only thing that made last nights "Yo!" worth my two hours of
sleeplessness was George Clinton's "Paint the White House Black". 
In some ways it exceeded my expectations, in others it fell short. 
I expected jus a lil more funkiness in the track, considering
Clinton is the king of funk.  And Cube and Dre only have cameos,
not full verses (although they are PHAT cameos).  What was good was
the verses from Breed (the original P.T.W.H.B. man), Yo-Yo, and a
gang of others.  Oh, and Flavor-Flav had a few cameos too...
suffice it to say this was a very good video.  The funniest part
was when Dre is on the phone with Hillary Clinton... I won't spoil
it see this SLAMMIN video for yourself. 

The newjack Dred Scott was in the house, but I wasn't very
impressed.  The song was called somethin' like "A Dred Scott Ain't
Got Nuthin to Lose".  It was average lyrical style, to an average
beat, set to an average video.  The funkiest part of the whole song
was a breakdown between verses two and three which was in there. 
Dred probably has potential but this video didn't highlight it very
well. 

Dissapointments:  No Snoop Dogg video, no UltraMagnetic M.C.'s
video, no video from the Alkaholiks (I keep hearin that Make Room
is PHAT), and basically a lack of new video material altogether
(last week and this week were almost the same).  But all in all I
still want my Yo! MTV...

Rolling Stone Street News
by Dimitri Ehrlich

Some things just can't be learned.  Like a taste from rhubarb, the gene
for muscular calves, or the ability to be a great rapper, you're either
born with it or you're not.  And while the slightly endomorphic Erick
Sermon will probably never pose for Calvin Klein ads, he was born with
an extra dose fo that elusive but essential B-boy trait:  supremely ill
rhyme skills.  As a result, "No Pressure" (Def Jam/Sony). Sermon's first
solo album since the breakup of EPMD, is the most straight up funkadelic
rap album of the seasonb.  In addition to recording "No Pressure," the
lisping Long Islander has collaborated with TLC producer Dallas Austin
on an upcoming project under the name Shades of Lingo.

Speaking of endomorphs, on August 31 the patron saint of healthy
cabooses, Sir Mix-a-Lot, released a compilation entitled "Seattle...the
Dark Side," a showcase for the nogrunge faction of Seattle that features
a roster of rap and R&B artists signed to his Rhyme Cartel label.

Four days before Mix-a-Lot's album drops, Def American Recordings, which
distributes Rhyme Cartel, will change its name to American Recordings.
Label head Rick Rubin is holding a funeral for the word "def," which he
believes is passe.

Seattle will be host to Ice-T in September, who will be filming
"Surviving the Game" in the rainy yuppy paradise.  As soon as that
wraps, the Home Invader will be shooting another film, "Johnny
Mnemonic," described by a spokesperson at Priority records as "a
futuristic, 'Blade Runner' secret-agent type of thing."  Ice's winter
tour of Europe with Body Count will follow.

Earlier this summer, just as KMD had completed tracks for their upcoming
album "Black Bastards"(Elektra), group member Subroc was fatally struck
by a car on Long Island, NY.  In a show of solidarity, Pete Nice,
Leaders of the New School, Brand Nubian, A Tribe Called Quest, H2O and
others will lip-sync the parts originally rapped by Subroc in the video
for the album's first single, "What a Niggy No."  The same artists will
take part in a Manhattan benifit performance for Subroc's family,
including his brother and partner in KMD, Zevlov X, to be held in late
August.

Pete Nice's Hoppoh Recordings, a new Sony-distributed label, will be
launching in September with the release of "Jorge of the Projects," by
Kurious Jorge.  Jorge, who used to be a foot messenger for Def Jam until
he was discovered rapping, has a sleey-eyed style that makes his artful,
unpretentious rhyming seem deceptively simple.  And like Erick Sermon,
he never seems to struggle, pretend, or break a sweat.


Section 7 -- Seven

                   THA ALKAHOLIKS, "21 & OVER

                       Review by David J.

        With all the talk in rap music today about creating new
styles and finding new subjects for rhymes, a lot of artists lose
the things that made rap great -- funky beats and rhymes that just
flow.  Tha Alkaholiks have both of these.
        This album features ten songs from the group that first blew
up on the scene on the King Tee single "I Got It Bad," where they
established their style with the lines "It used to be about rhymes,
all about rhymes... now rappers rearrangin', and changin' like
times."  It would seem at first that Tha 'Liks are all about rhymes,
until you get a listen to their beats. 
        E-swift takes care of most of the production, with a little
help from King Tee on two tracks and The Loot Pack on a two
others.  From the basic bassline on "Only When I'm Drunk" to the
phat uptempo jazz licks on "Turn Tha Party Out" and "Mary Jane"
(both Loot Pack-produced) to the straight up jams on "Make Room"
and "Last Call" (the tracks on their first single), the beats kick
from start to finish, which makes the entire album worth playing. 
        Of course, even with the phattest music, crews are nowhere
without dope rhymes to recite on top of 'em.  No problem.  J-Ro and
Tash say that crews talk about "back to the old school./Ya never
should have left in the first place, fool," and they back it up by
just flowing on each track and inviting their numerous guests (King
Tee, The Loot Pack, Threat, Field Trip) to do the same.  The 'Liks
use so many braggadocious metaphors in every song that all you can
do is just sit and listen and wish you could have written them.
        They extend the metaphor for "Mary Jane," a song which
compares the average spliff to a real life girlfriend.  "Some
people don't approve of me being with ya, kiddo./They say you're
bad for me, and my mama says ditto./ When I walk up witcha, my
brothers wanna hit ya,/I know you been with others, but you know
I'll never quit ya."  It's a refreshing change from the rest of the
basic blunt-smoking tracks in rap these days. 
        As the group name indicates, though, J-Ro and Tash main
subject in their tunes is booze.  You can almost hear the entire
keg party singing, "Last call for alcohol!" when the chorus pops
in, and J-Ro sounds on the verge of vomiting on "Only When I'm
Drunk."  Tash has to pass the mic on that track because "Goddam I
gotta piss..." 
        The lone positive message on this album is simple -- don't
drink and drive.  J-Ro gives props to some friends who were killed
in a car accident, and Tash tells the crowd on "Turn Tha Party
Out", "If you're going home, ride home with someone sober."  Beyond
that little bit of seriousness, though, this album is just fun to
listen to from start to finish.  It's a little on the short side
(about 35 minutes of music), but well worth it.  Throw it in your
stereo or car tape deck and play it as loud as you can. 

Rating: 5 (out of 6)


Section 8 -- Eight  
Tyrone Ellison-Minista of Rage

The DITC crew represents once again with Fat Joe's debut album
"Represent."  Daimond D handles the majority of the production work, but
phat joints hooked up by Lord Finesse, Showbiz, Chilly Dee and the
Beatnuts make this package complete.  Lyrically, Fat Joe demonstrates
some skills, but there's nothing to make you want to rewind the tape.
Trackwise, the standouts are Lord Finesse's "Living Fat", "This Shit Is
Real" by the Beatnuts, "Another Wild Nigga from the Bronx" by Chilly Dee
and Diamond's "You Must Be Out Of Your Fuckin' Mind."

Although Fat Joe's not exactly the most innovative MC, he does know how
to flex, and he especially catches wreck on the album's two posse cuts
"...Fuckin Mind", which features Kool G Rap and Apache, and "...the
Bronx", which features Gismo, Kieth Kieth and King Sun.  Apache seems to
flow harder and more relentlessly on "...Fuckin Mind" than he did on his
own album, but in my opinion, G Rap's performance left a little
something to be desired.  I have heard G Rap rip shit wickedly on other
projects, but he fails to shine here.  King Sun shows that he hasn't
fallen off since his last outing on his portion of "...the Bronx", and
Gismo and Kieth Kieth show promise and potential.  Grand Puba also makes
a guest appearance on "Watch the Sound", and he comes correct.

Overall, this was a decent debut... nothing WACK, but nothing really
groundbreaking.  This album shows that Fat Joe has a lot of potential to
catch rek on future DITC projects.  Speaking of which, whatever happened
to Percee P?  I guess I'll just have to wait.

Rating (out of 5):  3 1/4.

Lyrics - "I Got It Bad," King Tee and Tha Alkaholiks

Intro:

Ladies and gentleman, that nigga King Tee and the al-cum-a-holiks

Verse One: J-Ro

Who bust play the rear cause I'm makin yapes
The rhymes ain't no thicker than a, skittle grapes
A lot of girls would like to thank me, for the hanky-panky
On the mic I hold a belt, now I know no one could spank me
It took a long time for the people, to hear my rhymes
Seems like I been rappin since my birth in '69
Sorry to keep you waitin, I run rhymes like Walter Payton
I get a rhyme like spokes on a Dayton
But I won't knock off, because I just rock off
the beats to get funky, like when you take your sock off
To all the white folks I would like to say howdy
And to all my brothers I say peace quit actin rowdy
Wack MCs in ninety-two, ew you need to take a rest
the public don't you aim the best you're softer than a hookers chest
raps, I make em, snaps, I make em
For duties movin booties cause I shake shake shake em
And I got rhymes, funky funky rhymes
E-Swift hold the needle down with nickels and dimes
I drink Olde English, St. Ide's and Mickeys
When it's time to roll I throw on my black dickeys
On the mic I get wicked, like Wilson Pickett
I get the place jumpin like a cricket when I kick shit
I'm from the West coast but don't sleep home-sniffy
Even if I was a paperboy you still couldn't rip me
I walk up and chalk up pairs like the Knicks
I'm all in the mix like snares, and kicks
When it comes to rhymes I get loose like belt buckles
Those who chose to oppose this nose is felt knuckles

(Where you goin' to?)        To the tip
(And what cha bout to do?)   Bout to rip
Some people use the word funky too loosely
And just how many rappers say they kick it like Bruce Lee
(What's your favorite brew?) Olde E
(And what it make you do?)   Go pee
It used to be about rhymes, all about rhymes
Now rappers rearrangin, and changin like times
I got it bad y'all, I got it bad y'all
When it comes to the pen and the pad y'all
I got it bad y'all, I got it bad y'all
When it comes to the pen and the pad y'all

Verse Two: E-Swift

Back the fuck up, gimme room to breath
Not too many niggaz can flip the rhymes like these
I freak the technique as if it was a bitch
Got more soul than the pit with a fifth
Pitch the ball, so I can beat it with the bat
Talk some shit, so I can smoke ya with my gat
I'm feelin kind feelin kinda feelin kinda feelin kinda
feelin kinda buzzed off a sack of chocolate tie
My my my ho, I like to rip the shows up
Smack the hoes that walk around with they nose up
Run to the liquor store, before they close up
Buy a few 40s, cause daily I get to' up
Sit at the crib and write RIGGY RIGGY rhymes
Line after line after LIGGY LIGGY line
Yo I can get funky, buy my tape and bump me
To the break of dawn I hit the bud and pass it on
Hangin at the park, shootin craps on the weekend
My brown bag is wet cause my tall can is leakin
Starin at the cops, beatin up on Rodney
While a pack of O.G.'s steppin to me tryin to rob me
Just because I'm dope, niggaz wanna smoke me
On the mic I get funky while you're doin the hokey-pokey
Dance steps, I think that you should leave to Paula
Alkaholiks is the shit, E-Swift's the smooth bawler
Is slangin these rhymes like a rock
Life ain't shit but money and a glock
Don't punch a clock, but I cock a fat knock
So I can smoke a lot of pot that I roll up with tops
And ya ain't heard shit yet, I'm just gettin warm
Like hot butter on, SAY WHAT?, THE POPCORN
I'm headed to the top, please give me my props
My beats are fat as fuck so bump my shit in your box
I love to hit the skinz, but then again WHO DOESN'T
I love to hit the herbs cause it leave me feelin buzzin
I dedicate this chumpie to the poets who can wreck
And to all the nottie dreads I gots to give them nuff respect

(Where you goin' to?)        To the tip
(And what cha bout to do?)   Bout to rip
Some people use the word funky too loosely
And just how many niggaz say they kick it like Bruce Lee
(What's your favorite brew?) Olde E
(And what it make you do?)   Go pee
It used to be about rhymes, all about rhymes
Now rappers rearrangin, and changin like times
I got it bad y'all, I got it bad y'all
When it comes to the pen and the pad y'all
I got it bad y'all, I got it bad y'all
When it comes to the pen and the pad y'all

Verse Three: King Tee

Up jumps the man with the loot
Rockin like a troop with the Alkaholik group
Everything is kosher, got a little taller
Livin kinda phat cause King Tee's a bawler
I just, irritate the wack, leave em so confused
When I'm checkin on the mic with the ones and twos
Sneak you a peek of the drunk technique
Can't stand up, need to take a seat
Baby baby baby it's the Alkaholiks
But I can freak the mic no matter how ya call it
Metaphors grand, and I'm the great man
Drink a whole fifth YES I CAN YES I CAN CAN
The girls call me dick-em-down
Got that title rockin for the crown
Catch y'all later, around next weekend
I'm a Alkaholik and I'm late for my meeting


Section 10 -- Ten

As you can see, it's back to business as usual for C.O.R.E.  We are
taking this thang seriously and not wasting time with the punks and
the marks (you know who they are).  HardC.O.R.E. is not about a
diss war... we shall continue to represent Rap EXCELLENCE, and not
be dragged down by garbage or bullshit.
