Dear Sir or Madam:

I am writing to express my concern with the actions taken recently
by your channel.  At this time I would remind you that MTV claims
to have made rap music national, and that MTV is invaluable to the
hip-hop nation.  But I would like to show you the hypocrisy of
these statements.  On several fundamental levels, you have failed
in these regards; furthermore, your station could be accused of
racial discrimination.  These are not foundless claims; I have the
documentation to back it up. 

I would first like to cite as an example the time scheduling of Yo!
MTV Raps. Within the past year it has changed more than three
times, leaving many viewers confused.  It was moved from a popular
afternoon scheduling where it pulled large ratings to late at
nights.  Then, when Yo! MTV Raps core audience (25 and under) was
unable to watch the show at its new time, the show pulled less
ratings.  When the ratings dropped, you had an excuse to cut back
the hours of the show from more than seven a week to just two. 
These actions as a whole are inexcusable and have convinced the
hip-hop nation at large that you intend to kill Yo! MTV Raps
despite its popularity. 

Secondly, I would bring attention to your policies of censorship of
music videos.  As an example I would cite the top 15 countdown of
Yo! MTV Raps from the weekend of July 4, 1992.  In the video for
House of Pain, a white group, they were allowed to refer to a
"punk-bitch" and to say "I never eat a pig because a pig is a
cop."  These statements would normally cause massive criticism and
perhaps even cause the video to be pulled, but several weeks later
"Jump Around" was the number one video.  Yet the group Das EFX,
whose single "They Want EFX" had already gone gold, could not even
say "blunt" in their video, nor could Del the Funkee Homosapien say
"chronic" in "Dr. Bombay". I understand if you don't wish to
promote the use of marijuana, but if this is your policy, why have
you done nothing about the Black Crowes?  It boils down to this...
white groups and rock groups have clout, and black hip-hop gets no
respect. 

So, on behalf of the Committee of Rap Excellence, the alt.rap
bulletin board, and the hip-hop nation at large, I state our formal
Declaration of War with Music TeleVision, which we refer to as
eMpTV.  Until your policies change, it will continue you to be
eMpTV, and we will do our best to make everyone aware of the fact. 
If you think the 'Cop Killer' protest was large, you ain't seen
nothin' yet. 

Very sincerely,

                         The Scene: Atlanta

Here we go with a brief introduction to the Atlanta Hip-Hop/Rap scene.  Right
now Atlanta is enjoying a growing reputation for music of all types, a
reputation that is long overdue seeing as the South is where almost all music
innovators in America have emerged with the exception of hip-Hop (unless you
count James Brown as a Hip-Hop artist).

How did Rap start in Atlanta?  That's a tough one even for me the Hip-Hop WIz
to answer as I was living in New Jersey when I was first introduced to Hip-Hop. 
However, I believe that it's safe to say that a few isolated old-school songs
dipped onto the scene in Atlanta and inspired some young artists to get down
with the underground sound.  Some of the Atlanta rappers wereThe Duice of Juice
"House Rock Tremble", MC Shy-D "Rap Will Never Die", and soon after came Raheem
the Dream "Raheem the Dream".

At that point, Atlant was not known for much of anything in the world of
Hip-Hop.  In fact, SPIN magazine once had a feature called the Hip-Hop Map
which basically stated that Atlanta wasn't about jack.  The most infuriating
thing about the article/diagram was that Luther Campbell was quoted in the
small inset that represented Atlanta information, as if Luke has a right to
speak for Atlanta from his offices in Miami.  However, very soon after that
Atlanta started to slowly make headway.  Success-N-Effect, Silk times Leather,
and others started showing up on BET and in records stores across the country. 
Then came the unbelievable successes of Kris Kross, Arrested Development, and
TLC all at the same time.  This brought the spotlight to the Atlanta hip-hop
scene.  What will become of the Scene remains a mystery:  will the underground
artists emerge, or will the bass-boy wannabe gangsters like Kilo, Duice, and
A-town Posse deine Atlanta for the next SPIN Hip-HOp Map.  I hope you know who
I'm rooting for.  Peace to the Underground!

Review - Who's the Man? : Soundtrack

By MC Flash X

Review scale :

6.  Phat  - Ten years from now this shit'll still be so dope!
5.  Funky - Ownership is the difference between a mack and a mark
4.  Fine  - If your pockets are fat get it, but don't panic if you don't
3.  Fair  - It has some potential hits, and at least it doesn't stink
2.  Flat  - Somebody explain to me why this person even tried?!
1.  Flunk - The ultimate diss... PM Dawn sounded better

Beatz :  Many songs sound like 'Funky', but mostly they are 'Fine'.
Lyrics:  Some degree of explicitness, but (except for Party and
         Bullshit) parents could tolerate it.  The lyrical flow is in
         effect on nearly every hip-hop song... no loose ends there.
Rating:  Another tape that falls between ratings, but I will take the
         higher end and call it 'Funky'.  Opinion will vary greatly on
         this mixed bag of hip-hop, r&b, and reggae.

Side One:               

Party and Bullshit                   BIG        
Let's go Through the Motions         Jodeci
What's Next on the Menu?             Pete Rock and CL Smooth
You Don't Have to Worry              Mary J. Blige
Hittin Switches                      Erick Sermon
Madness                              Heavy D and Buju Banton

Side Two:

Who's the Man?                       House of Pain
Lovin' You                           Crystal J. Johnson
Pimp or Die                          Father MC
Hello, It's Me                       Spark 950 and Timbo King
Ease Up                              3rd Eye and the Group Home

I'm going to try a new style this time.  I will rate each song  and say what I
liked or didn't like about it instead of quoting lyrics.  Let me all know what
ya think.

Party and Bullshit - Funky

BIG has gotten wreck in Unsigned Hype, had a slammin cameo on Heavy D's "A
Buncha Niggaz", and now proceeds to catch wreck all on his own.  This songs has
the track goin on, and BIG rips his deeper-toned Heavy-Dish gangsta flow quite
nicely.  Definetly a man to watch out for.

Let's Go Through the Motions - Fine

I'm not normally one for R&B cuts, but this one is OK.  The track sounds like a
diced up sample of the 'Punks' beat, and the drums are snappy, not sappy like
most R and BS.  Not a FF song!

What's Next on the Menu? - Phat

Can I help it?  I love these guys!  Pete Rock proves that less can be more,
with a track that went on a diet and came out fatter!  And you can't even sleep
on the lyrics... forgive me if I quote for a minute...

"Got I rhyme so chunky it's amazing G
 I Make you think the Fat Boys are back on crazy...
 I want a salary Moriah couldn't Carey"

CL is the lyrical heavyweight!  This track is pure butter!

You Don't Have to Worry - Fair

I don't know why, but this track has no juice.  Mary J. is my homegirl and all
that, but it sounds like the track that was leftover from "What's the 411",
with good reason.  Nuff said.

Hittin' Switches - Fine

OK I like it, and the "Off an on off and on it's on" chorus is hype.  But every
verse I keep wondering, where is Parrish Smith?  I'm sorry, to me these guys
will always be a group, and Erick just DOES NOT SOUND RIGHT BY HIMSELF!!!!

Hotness - Funky

It helps that I have been gettin into reggae lately, so this song hit me at
just the right time.  They do some really strange but funky double layering to
Heavy D's voice, and Buju Banton rips the track up.  This one is gonna hit hard
in the dancehalls and the hip-hop spots.

Who's the Man - Fine

Biting Dr. Dre's already (better) used sample does nothing for originality, but
the lyrics are OK, and the tracks is kinda smooth.  House of Pain fans will dig
it, but if you didn't already like em you may skip this one.

Lovin' You - Fair

Just one more diva wannabe.  Need I say more?

Pimp Or Die - Fine

Perhaps the reason it doesn't quite work for me is that to me, Father MC is not
a gangsta.  But he still flows well, and once again, the chorus will have you
hooked "What's the law?  Pimp or die!".  Kinda flava!

Hello It's Me - Fair

This track is just pretty average.  Pretty average hip-hop artist, pretty
average reggae artist, and the song is not that exciting.
 
Ease Up - Funky

Two verses is not enough!  Damn!  3rd Eye comes off hard!  The Uptown posse is
gonna be runnin shit correct in '93, no doubt about it!

As you can see this album never really dips below Fair, and some tracks are
truly slamming.  You aren't gonna be dissapointed by having this Soundtrack in
your collection.  Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up!


Section 6 -- Six

Review -- Lords of the Underground
by the Mack......

Lords Of the Underground
"Here Comes the Lords"
check it--3 stars out of 5

Now before yall get all down on Marley Marl for doin the similar beats
and styles, you should know that K-Def produces about half of the tracks
on this solid debut.  Marley Marl cuts are distinctive --check out
"GraveDigga" and "Funky Child."  "Grave Digga" gots some deep creep bass
with some funky organs sprinkled over the top and comes off phat.
You've heard "Funky Child" which is as close to hype as you can get
lately.  Anyway, the point is, K-Def product is the average sections of
the LP.  Formula:  rolling bassline, phat beat, some scattered horns,
and some sort of chant for the chorus.  Songs like "From da Bricks,"
"Chief Rocka," and "What's Going On," all have the same style, same
everything.  But its still smooth to listen to because they do have some
distinctiveness, as far as lyrics and subtle basslines go.

Tracks to check out:

"Lord Jazz Hit Me One Time (Make it Funky)," a classic style pure DJ
selection in which DJ Lord Jazz flexes some mad wax skills while giving
the mic a try.  Cool style.

"Flow on and on (new symphony)"  smoothest track on the LP, but with a
kick beat.  Some crazy styles and some old school lyrics combine for a
solid effort.

"Funky Child,"  Massive large huge, etc...you've heard it.

"Grave Digga,"  mentioned above, gots an edge to it that makes it come
off.  It's about people digging their own graves.

"Mad Skillz,"  this cut is exactly what it says it is, Doitall and Mr.
Funky go flexin..

That's about it.  Like I said, K-Def's got to learn to vary his
production style a whole lot more.  This is a good album to get a dub
off of someone to keep for the car....


Section 7 -- Seven

Review -- Common Sense
"Can I Borrow a Dollar?"

*Heidi Ho produced by the Beatnuts
All lyrics written by Common Sense

Common Sense is gettin' slept on seriously.  He collects much props on the
inside of Hip-Hop (the Pharcyde among others).  Also, Common Sense is a former
member of the Source's unsigned hype club.  He is starting to get a little more
notice with his secong single "Breaker 1/9" that  features a nice little remix
by the Beatnuts.

The thing that impresses me most about Common Sense is his abstracts "Insert
crazy similies whenever and wherever I can" style as well as his vocal range
(he can screech with the likes of Biz Markie).  These two factors add up to mad
flavor from Chicago (home of hip-house and Tung-Twista).

First I'll go over what I don't like about this LP.  The best song on the album
is his first single "Take it EZ", this is always a pet peeve of mine because
there doesn't seem to me to be a point in buying an album if the rest of the
material doesn't measure up to the first single (the rest of the stuff is good
no doubt, but if you weren't very impressed with "Take it EZ" then you may want
to preview the LP first).  Another thing that might turn people off is his
style.  By that I mean that if you like continuity in your rap songs you might
not find much of it here, as Com jumps from simile to simile and sometimes
loses the central theme if there even is one.  So if you like clean structured
Essay-type raps then for you Common might not make Sense.  There is a lot of
female bashing on the album, not as harsh as your average gangster but
nevertheless it is there, which is usually a turn-off for me but coming from
Com it's more bearable than most.  And finally, white rap fans and artists
(especially the alt.rap group) may not appreciate this slight diss that appears
on the album "..When we was on the streets, you was at home on your
computer..."

The beats and samples you've heard before or even later (like the Hip-Hop
Hooray beat which Com used before Naughty), even one that an artist from my
posse East Coast Tribe used last year.  However, Common Sense uses these beats
very well and his versatility helps him get over.  He can roll-it-up, sing
along, and even use a touch of raggamuffin.  I like how he uses old school
chants and I have a weakness for rappers who use movie lines and titles.

As for guests, Immenslope (tha producer) appears on "Two Scoops of Raisins" and
he basically sounds like Common Sense-lite.  While Rayshell, the female rapper
on "Tricks up my Sleever" sounds a lot like Tarrie B. and I was wonderin' if
its possible that she's tryin' to make a comeback with a new style a la her
ex-boyfriend Everlast (I doubt it though, Rayshell probably just sounds
similar).

Anyway down to the point of this review, Common Sense is pretty dope with his
own distinct styke (somethin' which is far too uncommon these days) and he
deserves some props and at least a preview so go check it.  I'm out like a
Dragon Stout in Red Baron's Mouth.  I haven't written for publications in a
long while so forgive my rustiness, I'll try to get better as I go assuming
they allow me to do more articles.  Peace and Love.

Section 8 -- Eight

Lyrics- Flavor Unit - "Roll Wit the Flava"
(I had trouble with the first two verses, so any corrections would be 
very much appreciated.  Hope y'all like it!)

Verse One : Treach

Once again, it's on
Cause where I'm from there ain't no picket fences pickin' straight and rock
so you pick it my sticky finger was a glock
Many dashed from the fat cat but I like to cap for laughs
So I rap till my ass will laugh
I'm never trouble but if troops will come and jam me
You Remind Me like Mary then I'm scaring your little projects
On the prarie I'm hairy and hot like Dougie with a smokie
So I boo-boo, just like Fu-Schnicks I'll say F-U-2

Verse Two : Chip-Fu

A-bibbedy-bibbedy-bibbedy-bibbedy-bong-gang ultra-king
But BBD boxing up yang, giddy-up
Didduh-duh, didduh-duh, didduh-dum dum dum
I'm coming again and again a Ku-Fu vomit
Gosh, darn it!  Like we're lyin' to bits
The John-John shaker lyrical shaker
Yes and doin some heimers-lichs
I sings my lyrical style from Flatbush
Quick to Greenwich, Finnish
I'm strong to the finish
When I eats, me spinach
I'm one of the lyrical flava
My nigga Foxx is stompin fast
Check my dum-dum-dum-dum-dum and step

Verse Three : Freddie Foxx

Now I been breakin rappers down for a while now
Now it's time to break, child
Rappers get chopped like the head on a fat cow
I'm mister micraphone, rappers can't fuck around
I'm Freddie the Foxx I'll brake it back and buck em buck em down
You know my rep I got a record like the turnpikes
When I was young they use to call me Freddie-burn-mics
But now they call me big Foxx, daddy boot-knocks
With burn marks on my hips from my twin glocks

Chorus

(Queen Latifah) I got flava for days   \
(KRS-One) Flava unit has a title        >  Repeats four times
Roll With the Flava                    /

Verse Four : Queen Latifah

Now it's about the time to put you out of sight and out of mind
I got the skills to blast you off the mic and out of rhymes
Now who the hell-am-I-a?, the L-A-T-I-F-A-H the motherfuckin sire
I come in on time
You wear a silly grin we like we do when niggaz in
We gotta practice so slap the hands off your chinny-chin-chin
The Flava Unit's got my back, so I'm quick to start shit
Get the short end of a bat, cause we beat him broken sticks

Verse Five : Heavy D

I-guy-guy-guy-guy-guy bet you never knew
That I could flow I flew I grow I grew
I blew up the spot, I'm sippin my props
And now I am just passin brew
Ruff rugged rigid nigga, the one who's quick to figure
Some think they're big, but the heavster is bigger
The funky flip-flop flava unit, my hip-hop neigbor doin it
Came to the studio, check my flow, and ran right through it
I bet you thought I wouldn't come, I came
I'm never done till I'm done rippin drums like a shotgun, ohh!

Chorus

Verse Six : D-Nice

Now ladies, what's my name? (aaah)
That means it's time to go
I'm the same muuuhfucker from it's time to flow, so
Some might have dissed the way I flow it out
Niggaz need to throw it out
Simply cause it's somethin you don't know about
So watch the Nice man shake the ground
And now I'm Rollin with the Flava cause
The Flava's what I'm rollin in my sound
To make you get down, rippin the sound from Jaycee to Uptown
Now

Verse Seven : Dres

Now if you got a nine, and you got a nine
And you got a nine, and you got a nine
And he got a nine, and she got a nine
Well it's a motherflockin party yo cause I got mine
So bust it the Black Sheep are (where?) here (where)
Here (where) there, everywhere there's a jeep
There's a Sheep sheep beatin up the air
Graphic as illustratin frustratin like waitin
The Sheep are a joke?  Nigga you playin
Yo I drink twenty forties, smoke forty blunts
Say a hundred rhymes and not sound like you once
Twice, three times, nigga never figured
You'd be triggered by Dres, that R and B smokin nigga
Doin it, screwin it, chewin it, well
Done on the weak bun hon can't you tell
Unification cells on the flava flingin
If a Queen has the balls my Lady is a King
So long live the King, and love to my unit
Spoon it and you'll croon it, diss it, and yo balloon it

Chorus

Like the name of it already tells, the first track is only some kind of
intro. It leads the listener to one of the greatest hip hop records ever
made (at least in my books).

"Mr. Sandman" is one of my favourites. To be honest, it even seems to
have made its way into the best individual rap pieces in my collection.
A magical synthesizer line starting this is simple but very good. After
few cycles of it and a couple of yawns (listening to this definitely don't
make me yawn) the drums start to beat in full effect along with some
excellent rapping and BUMMMM: _that_is_something_. I would consider this
a perfect lazy-style rap. In spite of the name, using the track as a
lullaby is just impossible. How could one go asleep listening to it. I
imagine even mummies would snap their fingers along the beat.

"Mellow But Smooth" could be the lullaby. This IS very mellow and won't
hit me very hard after "Sandman". Style is a little 'crossoverish'. Larry
Lar visits here.

Next to come is the funkiest track of the LP. "Weak At The Knees" has
very funky beat with nice drums and guitar picking. Some parts of this
one is not rapped but sung rather. A good tune. Talking about live
instruments, in record cover there is a list of players for guitar (Mike
Tyler), drums (Andy Kravitz), etc. Doug Grisby is said to play bass, but
only on this particular track. Thus, those brilliant basslines in some
songs later must be sampled or played with synthesizer. No, I'm the last
one to say it's wrong to use computers on music. In my opinion, though,
for example real drums sound usually much better. At least in this album.

"No Words" has a beat that doesn't compare with some other ones here.
Backgrounds and rap are OK but not all of it. If I had to listen to this
a lot, it _might_ bore me. I would call this standard material.

Two tracks left in side one. I mentioned basslines earlier, meaning these
two. Especially "In Effect" has a very good one leaving "Make Ya $" a few
inches behind. Both of these are dope pieces of work. In "In Effect" there
is this chorus-type-of-thing that I in particular do like. First comes a
tasty sample of some wind instrument (sax, I assume) and after that the
voice saying those letters E-F-F-E-C-T. Someone could love these two beats
on the dance floor. In general, I think 3xD's albums contain a little more
'dancable' songs than other rap artists have on their records. This holds
true with both their first and second LP. Well, the guys are Audi 5000
and it's time to flip the vinyl.

B-side wins again could a person say and I agree. Although the start isn't
best possible. "10 Lil' Sucka Emceez" is a modified version of some
nursery rhyme. At least I think it is. The piece is not bad at all, but
the chorus lowers level a bit, still leaving LL's later effort with big
bad wolf miles away (behind). Larry Lar is also here.

"Make Dat Move" is a standard rap too, in my books. The groove is better
than in for example "No Words". While listening to this I thought my LP

had become overplayed cause I clearly heard some 'unwanted noise'. After
more careful listen I found the rasping sound coming from a sample used
here. Nice little point.

If the party isn't already on, it will start along with "I Ain't Try'n 2
Hear It". Here comes the second highlight of the album. Just a glorious
song. Actually, the second highlight will continue four tracks from here.
This one has a catchy guitar riff and a terrific background. Wood's
scratching is just like it is meant to be. While listening, it becomes
clear to me that Chuck Nice is doing better production work alone than
Lawrence Goodman and he did in "Original Stylin'". I had this one recorded
on a tape (from radio) before I bought the whole LP. So, in the beginning
when I wasn't used to other brilliant tracks in it, I thought this was the
best.

"Peace Ya'Self" also has sung chorus which, though, doesn't dim the shine
of this one. So far I have not taken a stance on the lyrics in this LP.
Here I make an exception. Chorus goes: "Peace in the world today, and in a
hurry". Naive or not but yet true. If everyone just realized this......
"We need less dissin', more huggin' and kissin'" states EST hitting the
nail on the head. Whole song is great containing a few cuts from 3xD's
first album in the beginning of it.

And again we got a masterpiece here. "I Got It" has excellent background
and marvelous rapping. By now, I _know_ EST is one of the greatest rapper
on the scene. The whole LP proves it to be true. In this one, James Brown
claims to got soul and no one on the face of earth is able to contradict
with Mr.Dynamite. And if those mummies mentioned earlier missed everything
before this one, at least now they are really starting to get the rhythm.

"Do You Wanna C It" makes them move even more wildly. The flow of diamonds
seems not to end at all in this record. Simply very good bassline again
and Tyler's guitar hits me also. Rap is like everywhere in the record just
wonderful. A short sample of Sade's "Sweetest Taboo" in the middle is
speeded up a little to match the beat. Nice work with that. I love this
one like those three before it. I have noticed that it is rare that a rap
album contains this many great tracks in a row. Usually a few good ones
but the album as a whole not so good (for example Cube's first). That is
the reason why I decided to review this precise record.

"Live From Acknickulous Land" finally completes the record. After four
previous pieces, I'm not going to say anything special about this. That
does not, under any circumstances, mean that it is no good. Vice versa.
If I only knew what the word 'acknickulous' does mean?

Time to sum it up. Like you have noticed, I have been praising the LP
pretty torrently. I'm not going to give any specific ranks to music and
lyrics. Just overall mark which is, with no hesitation, a full 6 out of 6.
After now spinning 3xD a lot on my turntable (because of review), I raise
this straight to the top of my rap albums. That drops PE's second LP to
number 2 spot. (Let it be known that my rap collection only has about 40
records not containing the latest albums of 1992-93.)

OK, that's it. Hope you liked it. I'm backin' left.

This is just a little reminder.  I would like to see everybody in C.O.R.E. at
least drop the 0.29 to mail the letter to MTV, with your name attached in place
of mine.  And if you can spare it, mail it to your local media too.  Thanks,
and I'm audi!
