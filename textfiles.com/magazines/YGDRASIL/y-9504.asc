  **************************************************************************

    Welcome to a special issue that welcomes Ygdrasil's upcoming second
    Birthday. It's hard to imagine that it's been this long, and that
    we've come this far - but it's all been worth it. There's no regrets -
    only gratitude.

    I'd like to thank some friends who've made this wonderful experience
    possible for me: Klaus Gerken, for his brave spirit and unstoppable
    enthusiasm; Paul Lauda, for almost going to the poor house by doing
    his thing to improve the world; Evan Light, for energetic activism;
    Pedro Sena, for vision, truth and dreams; Tom Almy, for quiet and
    dutiful service to others; all those that fought for dignified and
    worthy causes; and all those we've lost along the way.

    This issue steps forward into a realm of art that's just as poetic,
    though much less wordy - throughout the issue there's intertwined
    poems, pictures, sculptures and grafix. So if you're not seeing the
    Web version, you're missing most of the show; and if you're just
    seeing the only text & pictures, then that's barely second-best. If
    you're only reading the text, well, I can only gently say that there's
    a great deal more to this issue than what you're seeing. This is all
    about hushed voices and images....

    The Web version is at "http://www.ee.pdx.edu/~igal/ygdrasil/y-9504".

    To get full viewing satisfaction, you'll need to get a HTML level 3
    browser and JPEG & GIF graphics viewers to see the pictures - your
    best bet is to get Netscape 1.1 (ftp://ftp.mcom.com) which does both.

    Enjoy and spread the word.

    And now let's start....

                                                -Igal Koshevoy

    PS: urgent notice to Centipede boards: Paul Lauda's Revisions Systems
    had a tragic disk crash and may take a while to become operational
    again. Tom Almy's Bitter Butter Better BBS has been officially
    announced as the temporary hub of operations. To continue your
    Centipede service, please send netmail to Tom Almy at 1:105/290 or
    dial up BITTER BUTTER BBS at 1-503-692-5841 (new number) and leave a
    message.

    Unravelings
    ~~~~~~~~~~~

    Cobwebs in musty closets, filled with things that weren't there. A
    quiet drape of disappointment, maybe not too far from truth. Currents
    seem like the only movement; close the window, kill the lights. Hazy
    imperfection; outlines, shadows ... patient things.

    Motion is measured by a framed perspective. Distances traveled; vistas
    past. Sometimes seems like we're actually moving ... but it's always
    just the earth beneath us - washing by.

    Drive through every city and you're seeing the same thing, every
    channel playing the same dry song. Flat dullness, rolling across an
    absent void. We are our world. It's not surprising.

    And the time flies past; there's no reason to look at the watch ... we
    know what it's saying.

    faceless
    ~~~~~~~~

    filthied union, one under the streaking mud.
    collected leeches, barnacles and rainy gloom.
    shades of grey and brown -
    what a dirty, ugly place.

    i can feel the indifference,
    yeah,
    i'm sopping wet.

    in the cold of the moment,
    words come flowing like turbulent sewage -
    damp anger.

    plastic translucence and
    stainless appreciation.

        thank you.
            fuck you.
                i love you.
                    go to hell.

    irregular beat and enthropic carelessness,
    waiting for Now to come.

    self-defacement and soul replacement,
    press the off switch on the battery-powered god.

    stream of dissonance veiled by the steam of ignorance;
    no really,
    i don't want to know what's going on.

    there's everything if one looks hard enough for it,
    but shutting-in is good enough.

    scratch the itch,
    hit the bitch,
    and caress the rich.

    flick the button,
    change my channel,
    shift my focus to
        bluurroouuutt..

    tired,
    live to sleep -
    eternal night,
    effacing nightmare.
    so much better though....

    traversing on a line-by-line.
    ...i'm faceless....
    can't recognize a scream any more.

    last shot
    ~~~~~~~~~

    collapse
    framework crumbles

    heart-rot wormed from limb-to-limb
    filthy rags lay uninspired
    unwashed lies just sit and stare

    ghostly aberration fall down from wooden throne
    quiet whimperings of one too numb to cry

    the knot disintegrates
    the shadow melts and spawns

    a mattress sags
    enfolds and holds me close

    `tis only i, the loser
    the robber
    the ghost

    wander aimless
    through unending hallways
    mind subtracts itself from empty space

    burned down embers
    glow the coals forever

    swimming awash of sky and motor
    glistening

    pretty lights
    with fingers extended
    reaching like an infant
    one thing in mind:

            abyss
             ~~~~~

               nothing left to worship
                everything forsakened ...
                 tainted
                  twisted away

                    my gold has turned to rusting heaps
                     the bibles have crumbled down to blowing dusts
                      the statues have fallen from their marble pedestals

                      . . .

                      so close
                     but still
                    so far away

                  my fingers can almost reach you
                 almost hold you again ...
                almost

              the reaching out ...
             and i know it's wrong -
            i know it

          bringing you closer
         brings closer to tragedy

       i'd do anything -
      absolutely anything
     to bring things back to the way they were before -
    anything to just glimpse back at what might have been

    . . .

    all those pictures of you
     that hang in my darkened hallways,
      i'm afraid to turn the lights on -
       i'm afraid to look at them ...
        but i can still -feel- the accusing eyes
         staring
          whispering with slitted throats
           drowning me in pools of unspoken shame

             and even with all its hatefulness
              the gauntlet i run
               each and every day -
                i can't escape it

                  some faces so darkened by the shadows
                   the names lost
                    the details contorted ...
                     but their message remains

                       and the others
                        the fresher kills
                         with features glowing red
                          by the light of my infernal heart-pyre ...


                            they stare back
                             unmoving
                              frozen as they burn in time
                               glaring
                                unforgiving ...
                                 not them -
                                  not i

                                  . . .

                                  the gods have fallen
                                 the devil left
                                the idols crumbled
                               the faith has been shed

                             stalking the ruins
                            a black, hauntling glitch

                          staring into the anger-streaked horizon

                       and the shattered remnants
                      reach to the sky like broken teeth

                    in a world a million miles away
                   transposed onto another reality ...
                  too real
                 too false
                so artificial ...
               so far

               . . .

               i can almost reach you
                my extended fingers ...
                 almost ...
                  almost able to hold onto you.

                    i know it's poison,
                     i drink it just the same.

                       i know it's wrong -
                        but i can't stop it, not again.

                          nothing can
                           hold it back.
                            as if by a butchering-stencil
                             it all falls back into place ...
                              each step closer to you
                               a step closer to assured disaster.

                               . . .


                               the red sun
                              forever setting ...
                             watching me
                            mercilessly
                           for hours
                          years
                         eternities -
                        always setting,
                       never leaving
                      me behind

    DEATH SONG II
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    i am the wild-toothed rider
    of the fresh pine wood coffin
    that rides the nightmarish tidal wave of hate!
    ENGULF!  ENGULF!  ENGULF!

    'ah just gonna rip 'em apart,
    limb to limb, organ to organ!
    mow 'em down with a wall of glittering steel,
    LET'S GO SEVER SOME HEADS!

    i'm the child of the flames.
      gonna find that Dream Child
      n' toast a drink of battery acid for 'er health.
    i'm a bat out of hell.
      find the damned Child,
      and pierce 'er throat
      suck all the reeking goodness out
      and spit back the seeds.
    i'm the pain in this world.
      jus' gonna hum a tune,
      strike up a song,
      pull up a keg of blood,
      for the night is young and long!

    come 'ahn DOWN, ye'r neXT!
    i am the incinerator,
    i am doom!
    hell on wheelZ,
    pain in a wheelbarrel,
    death on a stick!

    simpl'y gonna do ya' all,
    make no damn diffRence ta' me!
    scream all you want, i'll make
    PLENTY more.
    can't get away,
    i'm on you heels,
    on your intestines,
    on ye'!


    come on down and
    take my bony hand
    and with leering skulls dance
    through the flames
    of our burning pasts.
    dance to the new rhythm
    set by the beat of a meltdown reactor core.
    dancin' thru da' flameZ - we go hand in hand!

    yeah, 'ah gotta head in my freezer
    ya' see.
    was an ol' luv o' mine: WAS, ya' see!
    so damn, maybe she never smiles - such'a damn shame
    but she don't bitch, don't gripe, don't whine.
    jus'a handful of somethin' clean
    to gnaw the hours away.

    and so U'll go,
    'ah smile as
    i gleefully grasp
    my rusted fork.
    jus' gonna take from you,
    what i never had.
    gonna take it
    ALL from you:
    everybit
    everypiece
    everydrop
    everypart.
    'n gonna shove't 'en ma meat locker
    for a RRRrrrrrainy day!

    i am your creation,
    you made me what i am.
    i am what you tossed out with the trash.
    i am the one you unceremoniously flushed down the john.

    now i'm back
    with a vengeance,
    with a plan,
    with a fork!

    ain't nuttin' gonna stop me this time.
    all those times past,

    morals

    contemplations
    expirations

    condemnations
    justifications.
    now eit's jus' decadence!


    'ah know it all,
    ultraomnipotent!
    'ah know ye'r best kept secrets,
    ye'r best told lies
      told with slippery tongue.
    but i've put ye'r testicles to the grindstone,
    and i'm beatin' 'em as my war drum!
    i've cut through the shit with a chainsaw.
    it's all done now!

    gonna stuff my pain
    down the throat of a long dead corpse
    gonna slay those god-damned souls!

    i can see you through
    like the frail polythene ghosts
    fluttering and dropping away in
    the acid rain.
    i know who you are.
    'ah can see your selfish selfs,
    your beheaded saints,
    your corrugated idols,
    your burnished shrines,
    that festered flesh,
    the bleeding hearts,
    the rotten minds,
    and the inside - much worse.
      and most of all,
      i can see the emptiness that you are.

    and i'm gonna kut it all out
    with my surgical chainsaw
    till the blood flows upon the planes in tides,
    the day, the day ... shall come.
    and we shall be ONE.
    twisted, pained flesh and my glorious doom.
    Cuz
    blind devotion to my cause,
    cause nuttin's gonna change my mind,
      no matter, evermore!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    shitterd
    ~~~~~~~~

    the tables turned
    i find myself beneath
    the powertrip replaced by fear

      once i was somebody
      once i was someone
      once i was something
      once...?

    cornered into surrender
    pushed into a shove
    reality betrays me
    falls out under my tired feet

    i lost the luxury
    my amenity
    now a dysfunctionality
    fucking through me in tyranny

    stepping down as royal lord of evaporation
    dropping knees to face my breaks

    shuddering incohesion
                           r
                              e

                                                             you're the one
    proud stand
    now a one-night pity

    the bruises glow unmuted
    transdifiguration eats me
    and i deserve

    shut it out
    propel to escape velocity
    but it's not my whim
    not my decision
    this collision

    passing reminiscence
    permeated by insolence
    feed by derogance
    flushed with impotence



    flash of light
    hand comes down so hard
    and the guilt even harder

    stopped world stands in attention
    focusing and staring into my weak and emptied soulruin

    i'd defend myself
    but it's too late to fight
    i'd hide
    but that wouldn't be right
    i'd run
    but i'm broken already

    eyes clamped shut
    tears wrestle for passage
    too late for self-reproach
    too late for anything other than shame

    collapse to breakdown
    and the stoning begins
    raw flesh on shattered moans

        . . .

    draining
    draining

        . . .

    drained

        . . .

    dragged by inertia
    lead by purpose unbelieved
    rebuild the paper-thin wall of decency
    bite down, ignore the memory

        . . .

    fading
    fading

        . . .

    faded

        . . .

    i'm sorry

    pity's bloom
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~

    raise the head
    ungazing desire

    security fixation
    with a gun against head

    trepid diffusion
    swimming besides
    refrigerated gardens
    hidden inside

    tread past
    midst confrontation
    through greying wounds
    and brittle stares

    unfurling unbeauty
    thorned fenced and spayed

    creep long the blockings
    move slow the vines
    tonight collapse and linger
    forget the eyes you can't see with
    ignore the world you won't live in

    divulged infestations
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    returning, i wear the lark -
    as stigmata
    of my insolence

    hidden under its lost innocence -
    shattered,
    torn asunder

    asyncronism,
    spinning mad -
    breaking dimension's walls

    insult to the living,
    dead are neither proud,
    in between - just hatred wrought

    staring from under tattered feathers,
    breathing from bloodied pores,
    livid existence - petrified

    singularity
    on field of battle,
    pride so hard on ground so cold

    no expectations,
    have i from you,
    my darling

    a moment collapses,
    unfairness blurred -
    de rigueur

    reflective derision -
    laugh so hard
    you cry

    Model ... under plexiglass
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    looking at you isn't enough
    holding you in my arms isn't either
    your eyes staring past me is enough
    enough to shatter the glory of the moment
    enough to break the myth
    enough to lose the feeling

    you're behind a protective glass wall
    and i can't break through it
    there's no way i can smash it
    no way to get through to you

    and i can see you
    there on the other side
    and you look happy
    almost
    i know you're hurt
    you weren't one to look hurt
    but i know you too well
    i know the truth
    but still the truth never mattered to you
    it never will either

    so there you are
    smiling away
    crying inside
    holding him tight
    as you break-down inside
    and what am i left with?

    a memory
    a fast-fading dream
    it was real, just moments ago
    but it's turning to fantasy so quick
    too fast
    too fast for me to hold on to

    i don't want to let you go
    i never wanted to let you out of my arms
    i didn't want to let you back into this hateful world
    never wanted to let you hurt
    i wanted to protect you
    maybe too much
    maybe too little
    but whatever it was
    it wasn't enough

    i couldn't hold on
    not the ride
    and not the trip

    now you're in my sight
    and your soft smile and bright eyes
    no longer bring me joy
    they bring those same tears you feel
    to me

    i want so much
    to tear those hateful emotions away
    and love you again
    but i can't
    without you loving back
    at least a little
    if you at least look back a little
    if you just give me a chance
    if you just let me try

    but you were never one for emotional types
    you had to it there and now
    i guess i terrified you
    by being so different and yet the same
    i was all i could be for you
    seems it wasn't that much

    i'm sorry
    i'm sorry i couldn't be what you wanted
    i'm so sorry i couldn't hold on to you as tight as i should
    i'm sorry

    it's cold up here
    the wind is blowing
    it's even colder inside me
    i want to warm myself by your fire
    want to warm your cold body with mine
    i don't care what you've put me through
    i still love you
    and i wish i could say that
    with the sincerity
    that i once had

    i miss you
    it's lonely here
    without you in my arms
    it's getting colder
    i can barely see you through this fog
    i can barely see at all
    i don't want to see anything else
    i want you
    i need you
    i love you
    wish you could say that for me

    i can almost remember your soft hair against my fingertips
    the way your eyes would sparkle just for me
    your laugh
    and smile

    i can almost remember
    almost

    i hate this memory
    because it's a memory
    i want it to be reality
    i want it to be now
    i want you now
    i need you now
    i love you now
    let me love you
    while i still can
    let me be something
    while there's still something left
    let me embrace you
    while you're still here

    you don't know how much i've missed you

    you'll never understand what you mean to me

    you don't know what you mean to me

    parting momentum
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    i can't live without you
      and tomorrow you'll be replaced
    right now you're my one desire
      and soon you'll be a memory passed
    everything i ever wanted from life
      forgotten blindingly quick
    i'm incomplete without you
      and with you i can't be

    an age of digital medicine
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    spinning slowly
    little lights
    cracked mirrors
    in a small darkened room

    somewhere an ironic melody plays
    a cruel mechanical and joking song
    its cords a punctuation
    twisting into a revolving conclusion

    mocking childsong serenades
    a quiet whirling dervish
    its pieces losing cohesion
    dropping crashing to an unseen floor

    jerky metal tune
    playing on a spinning drum
    and the harder one listens
    the more it changes, the more it stays the same

    each return to the placebefore
    also a return to the hereafter
    masked by almosthearing the hidden machineries
    (wonder)     is this inertia ... or is this eternity?

    and the fragments of the broken chandelier
    torn from sockets
    by conspired gravity
    come crashing down

    spinning
        falling
            watching from outside

    nothing more than a carnival inside a little head
                     ...it's all inside a little head.

    careless end of ... something...?
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    over a decade of punctual apologies
    hidden beneath multi-lingual guises
    under these hundred faces
    none of which i even believe

    the black clouds swell with anticipation
     a need to give back something
      waiting so long to impress
     saving up for retribution
    but they're only vapors

    and the sun dies no matter how hard i try to hold on to
    it watches with shutting eyes, the end of my world

    the repeated mistakes hum dull inside the framework
    "i did my best" ... or so i tell myself

    with a soft whimper i hug myself a little tighter
    and whisper quietly, "you tried" but i do not believe


    amidst these chirping, faded strangers
    amidst this perfumed sea of suits

    i stand between no where and nowhere
    and now i'm nothing

    Anyways, I've wasted enough of your valuable time and brain cells, so I
 honestly hope you have enjoyed the pictures and poetry. I also hope that
 some of the stuff written has 'rubbed-up' on you and has, or will, change
 your life and that of others, somehow, for the better. Take care.

  **************************************************************************

Here's some ways you can get a copy of Ygdrasil --

Internet:
  * Use the World Wide Web to browse "http://www.rdrop.com/~igal/ygdrasil" -
    the official Web site. This contains EVERYTHING that's Ygdrasil,
    including all versions, even hypertexted ones with really awesome
    graphics that aren't available elsewhere. This is the place to be if you
    can get there.
  * Read Usenet's "rec.arts.poems" or "alt.zines" newsgroups, where the
    7-bit Ygdrasil magazine is posted in full as it's released.
  * Use Internet ftp to "ftp.rdrop.com/~igal/ygdrasil" - the official ftp
    site. View "INDEX" file to see a directory explaining our files.

BBS & Fidonet:
  * If your BBS gets Centipede (Ygdrasil's favorite Network) or EPub file
    echoes, if so, look for files that start with "Y-yymm" where "yy" is the
    last two digits of the year and the "mm" is the month of the issue.
  * Perform a Fidonet FileRequest to 1:105/290 and look for files with the
    above naming scheme. You can do this if you're a Fidonet "Point",
    otherwise, just ask your friendly Fidonet sysop.
  * Call 1-503-692-5841, that's Tom Almy's "Bitter Butter Better BBS" in
    Tigard, Oregon which connects 1200 through V.FC & V.34 - it's our
    official BBS site until RESY comes back. Enter "downloader" as the name,
    "guest" as the password. Enter the (F)iles section, (E)nter group "1"
    Fiction, and (A)rea change to "14" Contemporary Poetry. And download
    away! You can be downloading within 15 seconds of connection.

Electronic Mail:
  * Send email (Fidonet: Igal Koshevoy at 1:105/290; or Internet:
    igal@agora.rdrop.com) and ask us to send you Ygdrasil by email. Please
    tell us which version you wish to receive: (1) the uncompressed 7-bit
    universal ASCII or (2) the UUENCODED 8-bit MSDOS version. If not
    specified, you'll get the 7-bit which you can read in your mail program.
    Don't forget to mention any length related quirks in your mail reader -
    such as you can't view more than 200 lines in OLX.
  * Request and read the "A Very Brief E-mail User's Guide to Ygdrasil
    Online" and get your own copies of Ygdrasil through email.

Postal Mail:

    to know. Feel free to make any suggestions or comments, we look forward
    to hearing from you.

       to accent a poem at the right meter?  Well, come join our
       PoetryForum, and everyone would be willing to help you out.
       Have any problems in deciphering your dreams?  Select The Dreams
       echo, and you're questions shall be solved.

       The Network was created on May 16, 1993.  I created this because
       there were no other networks dedicated to such an audience.
       And with the help of Klaus Gerken, Centipede soon started to
       grow, and become active on Bulletin Board Systems.

       I consider Centipede to be a Public Network; however, its a
       specialized network, dealing with any type of creative thinking.
       Therefore, that makes us something quite exotic, since most
       nets are very general and have various topics, not of interest
       to a writer--which is where Centipede steps in!  No more fuss.
       A writer can now download the whole network, without phasing
       out any more conferences, since the whole net pertains to
       the writer's interests.  This means that Centipede has all
       the active topics that any creative user seeks.  And if we
       don't, then one shall be created.

       If you want to find out more about Centipede, give us a call
       at +609-896-3256, and join one of our conferences.  You'll
       not be disappointed!   Or, check out the latest info packet
       being distributed in the format: CENTyymm.[ARCHIVE].
