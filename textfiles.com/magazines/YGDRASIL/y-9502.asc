                               [ INTRODUCTION ]
  **************************************************************************

       In my younger years I came across this story, which may not quite
   follow the proper history of Marpa and Milarepa, but nonetheless has
   always stayed with me for its sheer fortitude and wisdom.

       Milarepa, the great Tibetan Saint (western concept - but it serves a
   purpose) and Poet (universal term - ultimately meaning only, 'talking in
   rhythms', depending on the context), when a young man, and out of remorse
   for exacting revenge for the slaughter of his family, he attached himself
   to the Great Guru Marpa to gain the self-enlightenment, which all good
   self-reliant souls must seek, to ultimately, through many life
   'awareness' become a botthistatva, and therefore Buddha. Well, Milarepa,
   young and filled with pride, approached Marpa in his cave on a steep
   hill. 'What should I do to gain enlightenment?' he asked in youthful
   exuberance. 'Build me a house.' 'But there is nothing on this hill to
   build with.' 'There are rocks in the valley: gather them.' Marpa would
   have no other word with the young poet. Milarepa, did not lose faith, but
   went down to the valley and began gathering the rocks to build Marpa a
   house. For ten years he laboriously dragged rock after rock up the steep
   hill without complaint. After the ten year period, and after the house
   was built, Milarepa again approached the venerated guru and prostrated
   himself before him. 'Master, I have done what you requested; please
   emerge from your cave and see the house that I have built for you.' Marpa
   looked at the poet in disgust: 'It is an abomination. Tear it down
   immediately and replace every rock where you found it.' Milarepa, bowed
   and immediately began to tear down the house he had so laboriously built,
   and for the next ten years replaced every stone where he had found it.
   After his task was completed, Milarepa returned to the great and now
   aging Marpa, 'I have replaced every rock as you requested.' 'Fool!' Marpa
   cried aloud, 'No stone is returned to it's rightful place, and you have
   torn my home apart.' 'Quick, rebuild it!' Milarepa, bowed reverently, and
   slowly with illumination in his heart, set about his task. It was only
   after Milarepa had rebuilt the house that Marpa agreed to teach him.

       So what does this story tell us? Many will simply say that Milarepa
   was a fool, and wasted his life. It sure sounds that way on the surface.
   But when we look more closely, do we see anything different? I can't help
   thinking that this is a lesson for every person who aspires to being a
   poet. Not in the task as much as in the question, and especially the
   conviction of the answer. Did Milarepa waste his life? Milarepa didn't
   think so. Did Marpa waste his? Not at all. Because Milarepa did not think
   that either his own task was purposeless, nor the reason for Marpa
   requesting the task be done. So what did Milarepa learn? First he came to
   an understanding of what sacrifice for a cause is. One begins by being
   humble. To be humble one must sacrifice conceived notions of what one
   thinks one knows and needs. One must be open to a new experience,
   unprejudiced and prepared. Then through the task Marpa communicated, and
   Milarepa took on willingly, he learned first of all, discipline, for
   without discipline we cannot achieve a purpose we have set for ourselves;
   second, he learned perseverance, for without perseverance we cannot have
   hope of making a good ending, we must believe in ourselves and our
   purpose, otherwise there is nothing to strive for; and third, he learned
   the art of building a good foundation, without which, nothing that is
   built can survive. It is said that for every stone Milarepa lugged up and
   down that hill he wrote a poem, the poems of which became the 100
   thousand songs of Milarepa. Which brings me to how many young people
   approach poetry; through a great desire to express themselves. And how do
   they express themselves? Through words and immediate emotions. This is
   raw, and this is good. But without discipline, these raw expressions of
   energy become only part of the moment, and they dissipate as quickly as
   they are read. Many are put off be the four truths I set out earlier:
   Sacrifice, Discipline, Perseverance and a good foundation. I have seen
   many potentially good poets give up because they are told to be something
   that will take them many years of apprenticeship to achieve. They are
   sent away and told to return when they have a 'product' and are no longer
   just a 'potential'. This is a sad situation and many continue writing
   'poetry' when they are writing nothing at all of substance except for
   their own pleasure. Milarepa saw this immediacy in his own situation, and
   looked at the difference between his own self gratification and the
   gratification one gets when doing something on behalf of others. While I
   am not suggesting that anyone abandon their families and seek refuge in
   the Himalayas, I would say that if we take this as a metaphor and realize
   that a poem written for oneself may help oneself, it will also not
   survive oneself. A poem written to search for a universal discipline
   becomes an example. And therefore survives as the example, and spurns
   others to greater heights. What this tells us is that there is nothing to
   run away from. There is nothing in this world which does not exist on a
   strong foundation. Anyone who thinks they can be a poet simply by
   scribbling something on a piece of paper and chopping it into rhythmic
   lines, or even making it rhyme, is sadly mistaken. Poetry ultimately
   comes down to perseverance. It is not verbal ingenuity, and it is not
   pretty rhymes. It is back-breaking labour and a lot of soul searching. A
   lot. Ah, you might interject, but what about inspiration? Fine, but
   inspiration without discipline, is simply inspiration, a moment, a glow,
   a flash of light, or thought, a dream that fades as soon as one wakes;
   only comprehensible to self. Inspiration, as a great fire needs a spark
   to ignite, ignites the volatile elements which ultimately build a poem.
   But it is not the poem. Ultimately inspiration does not communicate other
   than to the recipient of the inspiration, to communicate this challenge
   (and it is a challenge), a vehicle is needed: for engineers, a bridge;
   for architects a building, for travellers, a destination, and for poets,
   a poem. A means to communicate the vision. And this is where Ygdrasil
   comes in. Ygdrasil is not as harsh on young poets as Marpa was to
   Milarepa. But it does aspire to a certain standard. And that standard is
   to try. To try and achieve the clearest possible development which
   communicates a poet's vision. What inspires is within each and every one
   of the poets contained herein, and it is also in each and every reader.
   Perhaps a merging will develop in this communication. Perhaps one who is
   inspired will inspire others; not just to write and read, but to live
   each moment in the knowledge that we all contribute. Milarepa bore great
   stones on his back, and through that labour achieved the enlightenment he
   so sorely sought. Sometimes it is others who show us the way, but never
   before we take the first step towards them.

       Ygdrasil attempts to recognize not only the accomplished poets, but
   also poets with potential, poets who might ultimately realize that they
   have a chance at it. And through this recognition, perhaps something of
   permanent value will emerge. That is also why Ygdrasil places the onus on
   the poem rather than the poet. If the poem can stand on its own without
   the poet's intervention, then the poet and others can learn from the
   poem. A good poem requires no explanation. This is the ultimate that
   Ygdrasil strives for. Those who read, be open minded; those who write,
   aware.

                      numb toes and burning nose
                  I've awakened simply to lie again

                      my bellybuttons both mouldy
                    But my feet are squeaky clean

                        canvas still dripping
                     Leaking through the ears of
                          a nation embodied
              Humanities puddle on my solid cyprus floor

   AS I SLEPT
   ~~~~~~~~~~

   Are you gonna cruse me too?
        say that I'm poisoned,
        rotted dead,
   curled up against my precious self?

   Are you gonna point a finger,
        laugh your silly
        head off
   behind my back?

   Nah, you is my lady,
        my woman-wife
        carin', sayin' sweetness
   to these, my silent ears.

   But that was once upon a time,
        wasn't it?
        Sure it was.

   It was before there was death
        on my hands,
        painted in my soul.

   So look,
        looking at me,
        through me
   your eyes.

   You are,
        yup, you are,
        killing me again and again
        as your words were warm
   and your soul was stiff.

   So where were you then,
        when the noise,
        the shattering tears ripped us apart,
   ripped us as I came home,
        landing nowhere as you walked away
        leaving me, my own tears
   for the dark to swallow.

   And I know you where there as I slept
        finally home,
        but you left as I slept
   went home making me wake to the nothingness.

   I screamed and screamed,
        again and again,
   Then I knew we would never make it,
        I would never be the same,
   never, ever again.

   SMILE AT ME
   ~~~~~~~~~~~

   Smile at me constantly
        my most ...
   And in you is that one
        special, oh so ...
   Very, very come to me
        as in dreams, as on
        clouds, as
   Within you is a frailness
        most fragile about me, around me
        your presence permeates,
   Penetrates me now.

   When gold so frankincense
        tugs on gossamer tails of
        precious pristine basilicas and
   Byzantine pomegranates
        i see Pisces clinging tightly,
        so rightly
   roundly you and i, me and oh so you,
        truly ours.

   (and ever so permanently you
   surround, abound me
   And again it's your hands,
        those fingers gentle about me,
        searching me;
        discovering yourself in my
   pressed unconsciousness)

   But Saint Steven's Day was such
        An oh, so very long drawn time ago,
   Wasn't it.  Your delicate reach that
   Never -- on that day -- enclosed,
   Wrapped me good,
        Whitely around me not once.

   Far away now (you are)
   Somewhere else as we never saw that
   Christ-like morning melting us
   Together, wedding us forever.

============================================================================

   I say
   ~~~~~

   You say,
   "You don't have to feel like you owe anybody anything,"
   But don't you owe everybody everything?
   I think so. I think so.
   You don't.
   That's ok-
   Sometimes I don't either.

   You say,
   "You always have to get us fighting!"
   But I think you're too excitable.
   Maybe you need a valium.

   You say,
   "You've wasted my time!"
   But I think that perhaps your time isn't so precious.
   I think you're a blowhard.

   You say,
   "You can't make the simplest decisions!"
   Oh? So make them yourself.
   Can't, can you.
   I find you so entertaining.

   You say,
   "What's your problem?"
   I'll tell you.
   You are the problem.
   You and you alone.

   You say,
   "You're too weak!"
   Weak?
   Perhaps. But the weakest of the weak
   Is so much more than you.

   You say,
   "You're wrong and you know it!"
   I laugh.
   He's tired, and so am I.
   Leave him alone.

   You say,
   "Don't talk to me like that!"
   Like what?
   In a mature and coherent manner?
   So sorry, so very sorry.
   Should I talk like you?
   Should I bitch and moan?
   You don't stop until we're mad,
   Though he shouts,
   And I write.

   You say,
   "Now you've gone too far."

   But I say,
   "No. No, I've got quite a bit farther to travel."

   Lonely man in the corner
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   I tried.
   I truly did try.
   Now I am done.
   And what can I say?
   Everything's been said.
   Yet, we've said nothing.
   How ironic.
   How sad.
   Go. Please.
   I ask only one thing of you.
   Remember me.
   Oh, remember me.
   For that which is, will never be.
   And that which isn't?
   Always.

   Hell, and other places
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   "You'll burn the house down
   One of these days."
   And that will be the day when I
   Laugh and laugh and laugh and cry.
   At you. For you. With you.
   You don't like it?
   Fool. It's all for you.
   It always was, and your failure
   To see that will be (is) your tragedy.
   Your own personal slice of Hell.
   And other places.
   You'll never read this.
   What a waste.

   A symphony I'll always hear
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Is there one for whom the angels weep,
   For whom the souls of heroes seek?
   For whom the birds of air do fly,
   For whom; the turn of every eye?

   I think I do know such a one,
   And, Ah! Her beauty, bright as sun!
   Her smile is my saving grace,
   Captured in her shining face.

   When she speaks, it's like a song,
   Sweet harmony, it makes me strong!
   Her voice like music to my ear,
   A symphony I'll always hear.

   Such caring I have never seen,
   Compassionate; so like a dream!
   And in her eyes there's so much light!
   So deep and calling, like the night.

   And in all this, there's something else,
   I cannot describe it, but yet it's felt.
   It is her soul, so very strong,
   and with it, she can do no wrong.

   Dark Angel
   ~~~~~~~~~~

   Ah, to be one with the night!
   To be free and beautiful.
   To be a reaper of spirit,
   And a seeker of beauty.
   If only I could be!
   If only I could be...
   But can I?
   Can I be the Dark Angel,
   The eternal learner?
   Could I be he
   who is married to the darkness,
   And all her silent children?
   I want to know.
   I must know.
   I want the bittersweet Water of Life
   To flow down my white throat,
   Into my veins.
   I need to be the fiend!
   I need to feel the thirst!
   I need to touch the pale skin,
   And feel the fangs deep in my neck.
   I need to be the Vampire.

   Dirt
   ~~~~

   So, I see you've dug yourself a corpse.
   Well, what's a girl to do?
   Bury it- Burn it-
   Ask it to leave.
   Wouldn't want anyone to think it was yours.
   Oh, no.
   Don't forget, now!
   Here, take my spade.
   Cover it well!
   Don't let an inch of skin show!
   There, there, now hurry away,
   Can't be seen here, no!
   Good enough, now, good enou-
   Say... Is that a finger?
   Oh dear.
   I suppose I should bury it...
   But I rather think I won't.

   Never Forgotten
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   So what,
   If I decide,
   That my killing need,
   Is so,
   Much stronger,
   Than our sacred creed?
   And what,
   If I need,
   To go away?
   To fade,
   To the Darkness,
   Like Blood to my veins.

   Never Forgotten.

   And there,
   If I want,
   The taste of Blood,
   Who's there
   To tell me,
   It must not be done?
   Please now,
   come and hold me,
   I soon will leave.
   I'll take
   With me only,
   My need to greave.

   Never Forgotten-
   The first little taste...
   Never Forgotten-
   The warm-cold embrace...
   Never Forgotten-
   All of my kind...
   Never Forgotten-
   The words in the rhyme...

   Never Forgotten.

   Walls
   ~~~~~

   Builders, Creators:
   Carpenters all.
   Each building
   our individual
   wall.

   What magnitude we achieve
   as shapes, complexities
   we conceive.
   Each grander than before
   to hide, shelter, contain
   and no more.

   Variety,
   spice of life,
   is plentiful
   as each strives
   for his/her grand design.

   For some,
   building many small sections,
   to dive into
   in the midst of the fray.
   They often are hit,
   running to and fro,
   the little ducks
   all in a row;
   still they come.

   Others build one wall.
   Resplendent in height and depth.
   Brightly lit windows,
   doors bound and secure,
   they mat look upon,
   even enter,
   the world.
   Taste all it offers
   then;
   when burdens become wearisome to bear
   becomes a place to retreat,
   bind the wounds,
   so they never cease
   to care.

   A few
   seem never to know.
   Fearful of hearts desires,
   beyond reason they go.

   Domes,
   massive and brittle,
   they create.
   Chipping at the mortar
   frantically they seek.
   An obvious,elusive key.
   When found-again they run
   entombing themselves
   in the dark loneliness of the soul.

   Oh!; for the courage.
   To tear down
   each massive block
   set in anger and fear.
   To use the key
   open doors long closed.
   Restore the vitality
   to laughter
   once mine.

   mutterings
   ~~~~~~~~~~

   O heart drenched in sorrow,
   O wreckage of a fallen love.
   Pitiless and fearsome,
   The Nons mutter over this soul.
   Where deep love, as life, has perished.

   Treading currents of emotion,
   from deepest shadow,
   I hear
   the mutterings of the nons.

   Tracing first,
   ascent from chaos.
   Watching the spark
   fanned into flame.

   Listen, as it gathers about
   the elements of life
   upon this plane.
   Becoming a creature
   of blood and dust.

   Revel
   in the strange ecstasy
   called life.
   Experiencing all bright, and well travelled.
   Striving to explore the dark unknown...
   blazing paths
   for others to follow.

   Reaching beyond the bounds,
   touching another.
   Grasping that which is beyond
   oneself.
   Soaring to depths hither unplumbed
   as the flames of passion
   fill all horizons.

   The wheel spins,
   cycles turn,
   that which has grown
   and flowered
   begins to drop petals.

   Sorrows shared,
   ties which bind.
   Joys remembered,
   as each fragment screams
   toward the final end.

   With each passing petal
   the abyss opens,
   earth swallowing maw,
   life destroying...
   soul-crusher.
   Invites deeper visitation.

   In a moment of frailty,
   which is great strength,
   lashing out in love and anger.
   try to stop the descent
   into the maelstrom.
   Burning out the life
   it cannot
   keep.

   Leaving behind
   only the ruin,
   of a dried, withered,husk.
   Where deep love, as life, has perished.
   pitiless and fearsome,
   the nons mutter over this soul.

   Illusions
   ~~~~~~~~~

   Illusions.
   Realities we call
   life.

   Shadows play before my eyes.
   Collocating
   then dispersing.
   Focusing,
   but never clear.

   Often
   waiting for words
   we will never hear.

   The past
   rises from the mire.
   Bringing the feelings
   and the pain.
   Rising as specters
   haunting the soul.

   Each step taken
   changes unforeseen.
   Withholding knowledge
   of destiny's dream.

   Allowing belief
   we are plotters of our fate...

   into the mists we march.
   Good little morons all in a row.

   Following our brother,
   the lemming,
   over the cliff we go....
   into the swirls and eddies
   of life's uncertain flow.

   She Comes
   ~~~~~~~~~

   She rises from the earth in stretching straining branch's sway
   She walks upon the surface of the lake, in mists, in sunlit day
   She comes, with greening heart, and blooming fingertips into the air.

   She hears as called by torment's child pounding on the church door
   She comes, I say, unscheduled walker growing from a distant moor
   She wakes at Winter's ingress, as she will, and where she may, a care.

   She listens to  lost daughters wailing 'neath the basement stair
   She wonders how the Father's twisted love has brought them there
   She comes, her hand extended through the cracks, and weeps, alone.

   She sees the child of visions tossed into a culture's refuse pile
   She wanders through  'enlighted' days of love and all the while
   She watches each desert the crying child within to build a throne.

   And who is She that comes without an invocation circled tight?
   Without the Season's behest giving Her moon worship's right
   Without the Sun to guide her steps and light her willful way?

   She Is faceless, perhaps, and nameless, perchance. Just as well
   She Is, and that is all I've come so far, through much, to tell
   She Is and was and will be, born, yesterday tomorrow and today.

   Where The Eagles Soar
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   When I missed the Eagle's call
   And took that first most painful fall
   Some bright sea creature reached within
   And brought me from the madding din
   A blue, a grey, come from the deeps
   To show me that my spirit keeps
   A way, a path, a conduit's note
   Whether by chance, by plan, or rote
   A map, in lines, writ on the stars
   A diagram between the bars
   Of Music sweet and song so deadly
   A heartbeat felt within the medley

   When I touched Grey Eagle's feather
   I drew a flight within harsh weather
   Dim and deep that spoke of loss
   When sea and wave the sailor toss
   Upon an ocean far and dear
   That in my dreaming brought me near
   To albatross, that fate  marked bird
   The mariner's lament, but not the word
   For in the flight is cast the fate
   For such as I who comes but late
   From nature's work onto the field
   Whereby nature's writ I yield.

   And with the Black I saw my ire
   Long waked anger my best attire
   Just lament toward which I lean
   Of blooded metal, cruelly keen
   A match for red's most ancient sword
   A writhing repast for the board
   Of justice called upon a god
   Whose heavy hand would wound the sod
   And cage within the fitful bird
   In-flights of spirit newly heard
   A child's awakening, a hopeful tale
   Sent in winds from inland gale.

   Aquila, Golden Bird of Prey
   Laid eggs of  love upon the tray
   Of wounded silver dreams in flight
   I sailed the day and kissed the night
   Anew, regrown, another leg
   Another view within the egg
   Becoming green took back the day
   Sorrow touched where anger lay
   Migrant wanderer again I knew
   The soaring freedom of the blue
   The flowing river rushing by
   And  she who ever walks the sky.

   A White tailed Eagle crossed  my path
   And brought to me my own sweet laugh
   An aviator's tail, sea salted
   A wing of fogged in joy, unhalted
   A wide flung span from other lands
   A fisher from another's hands
   And herein is my story told
   Of flights diverse in nature's hold
   Of varieties the Earth holds dear
   If Humanity can but see and hear
   For of the Eagles in the heavens
   Of species there are fifty seven!

   Black and blue house-

   This black and blue house
   is on the verge
   of collapse.
   This morning I was

   STIFLED   CRIES, AND
   SUPPRESSED LONGINGS.
   STRUCTURED WITHOUT
   WATERPROOFING..STRUCTURED
   WITHOUT PROTECTION-
   AGAINST DOWNFALLS
   OF SOFT TEARS.

   BLACK AND BLUE  HOUSE
   OWNED, SOLELY BY YOU.
   YOU WHO ARE OBLIVIOUS
   TO NEEDED REPAIRS.

      BLACK AND BLUE HOUSE
     SLOWLY SUFFOCATING
       IN SNOWDRIFTS.

   Only to feel it anew
   Upon my breast at every turn
   Fatal gems of frozen dew

   Innocent

   So red, the blood at dawn
   Yet blacker than the night
   Of fields and furrows, evil's pawn
   Lies uncaptured, frozen flight-
   The hollow sound of rotting wood
   Surrounds thy fragile ear
   The death of being understood...
   And the raw deceit of fear.

   Suicide
   ~~~~~~~

   Thunder rolled when she opened her eyes
   White clouds as dark as a raven
   Fear grew cold in her eyes while he watched
   For he knew, and so- she fled.

   Denial of love, shoved aside in importance
   Never a crime greater e'er stood
   Bury truth, attempt at creation-
   The suicide of the soul.

   Moment of Truth
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   So, it's come to this:
   dispassion with a vengeance
   and a frightening disease
   that disallows us to reveal
   what has truly been our lot...
   We hold on to each other
   because there's nothing else.

   When those we love become a shadow
   And we do not see them in the light
   Poison must reveal the better part...

   Presentiment
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~

   And as if something where to happen:
   something that would desperately appeal
   to those who haunt the fringes
   of the violent abrasions that we feel
   within the velvet wind of torture
   not as sharp, but splintered bones
   that choke you like a nest of robins
   consumed by pollution capturing the wind
   I recoil like many of no purpose
   and despise the crowded violence
   that others in confusion do not feel
   But I feel it in my bones and in my heart
   You see it on the evening news...and
   disregard it...others caution...you can only nod.

             NANCY and STEVE are both in the thirties; a
             handsome all-American couple.

             AT RISE it is 8:00am on a Sunday morning in early
             March, nineteen hundred and ...

             The lights begin to come up very slowly as if the
             sun is just breaking the horizon. STEVE BUSH has
             been sitting down left looking out the livingroom
             window that faces directly into the audience.

             The setting is a one bedroom apartment in
             Philadelphia, Pennsylvania   We see only the
             livingroom. It is a simple, rather sparse room
             with a somewhat vague, middle-class sensibility.
             There is a faded stuffed chair, a small bland sofa
             and a glass top coffee table center right. Several
             inexpensive reproductions of oil paintings and
             watercolors hang on the walls; one of which is a
             small reproduction of Vermeer's " Lady Reading A
             Latter At An Open Window". There is an archway up
             center; to the right, is the kitchen, to the left
             an unseen bathroom and bedroom. A doorway up stage
             of the archway is the main entrance to the
             apartment.

             After several beats NANCY BUSH enters from the
             bedroom and stands in the center of the archway.
             She is wearing a delicate nightgown covered by a
             tattered terrycloth robe that is too large for her
             small frame. She folds her arms across her chest
             and leans against the archway looking at STEVE.

             STEVE does not notice her at first. He is wearing
             winter pyjamas and looks as if he hasn't slept in
             several days. He is unshaven and somewhat
             dishevelled. After several long beats, NANCY exits
             to bathroom. Several seconds later we hear a
             toilet flush. She reenters and stands looking at
             STEVE.

                            NANCY
   You want some coffee?
             (no response)
   I want some coffee.
             (pause, then she exits to kitchen and
             continues to speak from off stage )
   You know something, Stevie, the more you keep this up, the
   more you are only going to make things worse.  Know what I
   mean, partner?  I'm getting a little tired of it.  You're
   getting a little tired of it.  The whole world's getting a
   little tired of it.
             (she enters carrying two cups of coffee and
             moves into the room and places one cup on the
             coffee table)
   It's only going to get cold sitting there all lonesome like
   that.
             (no response.  She moves back to archway
             and stands Looking at him as she sips her
             coffee)
   So, do we go to church this morning, or do we sit gazing at
   the street?
             (pause)
   How's traffic?  And what the hell am I doing up at eight
   a.m. on a Sunday morning?  I'm sipping coffee is what I'm
   doing.  By the way, did you come to bed at all last night?
   Nah, of course you didn't.  Now, how did I know that?
   Simple, when I moved over to feel a warm, sweaty body all I
   felt were ice cold sheets.
              (STEVE stands and moves to the coffee table
             and picks up his cup of coffee then returns
             to the window and sits)
   You don't have to say thanks, it's okay.  You're welcome all
   the same.
              (she moves to sofa and sits)
   So, big boy, what's happenin'?
             (no response)
   That's just great.  So, can I help it if my breasts are
   beginning to sag?  Ah, what's having sex to such an elderly
   couple like us anyway.  Or is it that maybe because we did
   have so much sex when we were too young to appreciate its
   endearing qualities that I'm now all stretched out, maybe
   worn out.
             (pause)
   Yeah, maybe you were right last night when you expressed
   your world view, your optimistic evaluation of life with
   that final word of communication, actually two final words:
   "Fuck it!"  Steve Bush's final statement: "Fuck it!"  Nice,
   real nice.  What's odd is, you say fuck it and then you
   don't, at least not with your wife.  That's rather odd,
   don't you think?
              (after a beat STEVE rises and begins to
             move off to kitchen with cup.  She stops him)
   Can I have some more too?
             (he takes her cup and exits)
   By the way, since when don't you like me in bed anymore?
             (no response)
   Well, you don't have to be that articulate about it.  Come
   on, you can be natural with me, real honest and all.
             (STEVE enters carrying two cups of coffee.
             He hands one to NANCY, then returns to the sit
             by the window.  He sits sipping his coffee)
   Thanks, champ.
             (pause)
   As I was saying, since when don't we make love to each other
   anymore?
             (no response)
   Since last night?  Or was it the night before?  Or maybe
   since our glorious wedding night thirteen years ago.  Since
   when?  I thought that I've always treated your chunky little
   rear end with tender loving care all these long years.
   Since when?
             (pause)
   Are you going to talk to me, or just sit there looking like
   that?

                            STEVE
   Let's just drop it, okay.

                            NANCY
   Drop what?
             (no response)
   I said, drop what?
             (pause)
   Drop that you're acting stupid?  No, let me rephrase that,
   acting crazy?  Go on, tell me.  Tell me what all this
   bullshit has been about for the past two stinking years.
   Why, all of a sudden, do I hear about something that
   happened to you years and years ago.  How come I never heard
   about it when you first got back?  How come?  Fill in the
   details, I seem to have lost something in the translation.
             (pause)
   And what does that stupid ass crack about "fuck it" mean
   anyway?
             (no response)
   It means that we don't sit and talk things over anymore.
   Steve, you know how I hate this crap when you just sit there
   and say nothing.  I mean, don't you know that about me?
              (to herself but for his benefit)
   What is this Nancy, forty questions to a mute?
             (she stands and is about to exit but stops
             in the archway and turns to him)
   Is that it, you want me to leave you alone this morning!?

                            STEVE
   Yeah.

                            NANCY
   Why?
             (no response)
   Well, buster, I live here too. I cannot walk around here
   avoiding you, being like a damn shadow, now can I?  I don't
   want to leave you alone this morning, I need you this
   morning, need you to talk to me, be my goddamn husband or
   whatever it is you're suppose to be for me.

                            STEVE
   Drink your coffee, okay.

                            NANCY
   I don't want the damn coffee!  I want you to say something
   to me, to be with me.
             (STEVE stands and exits to kitchen. NANCY
              moves to the chair STEVE was sitting in and sits)
   Oh boy, this is going to be another one of those peachy
   Sunday mornings.
             (STEVE reenters carrying another cup of coffee.
             He reacts to her sitting in "his" chair)
   Does it really bother you so much that I nag?  I mean,
   really. You call it nagging, and I call it being very
   interested. Maybe I shouldn't care, shouldn't be interested.

                            STEVE
   Don't be.

                            NANCY
   Oh, I see, I should leave you alone so you can piddle around
   in your own self-serving pity.  You'd like that, wouldn't
   you.
             (STEVE moves to window and stands looking out)
   You want to know something handsome, your so-called problems
   - the ones you think you suffer more than anyone else - are
   getting to be a very large pain in my ass.  You know what I
   mean, Stevie?  Hasn't this state of selfish depression been
   going on just a little too long these days?
             (pause)
   Okay, I want to know just how long you intend to keep this
   up this time.  Just how long is this war bullshit going to
   last!
             (he quickly turns to face her)
   I didn't mean it to sound like that.  I'm sorry.  Now don't
   go looking at me like that.  You're the one who keeps
   bringing it up every day for the past couple of years, and
   without saying a solitary word.  What do you expect me to do
   when you don't say a thing, only that I should understand.
   Good Christ, understand what?  All you said last night -
   other than fuck it - was that I would never understand. Well
   explain it to me in words that I can understand. I'll
   listen.  I want to listen.  But I can't listen anymore to
   just one simple phrase: "it was the war."  And how come I
   hear all these ugly stories from books and magazines, from
   everywhere but from the mouth of my own husband?  No, all
   you do is lock the bathroom door, punch holes in walls, etc.
   ... etc.  And you wonder way I don't understand. How can I
   understand refrigerators being turned over, windows being
   smashed?  And when I say let's try and start all over again,
   you just laugh and look right through me. Well, for
   Christsakes, how long do I have to stay empty?
             (she slams her coffee cup down on table)
   DAMNIT STEVE, I CANNOT TAKE THIS BULLSHIT ANYMORE!
             (calming herself as STEVE stands and moves
             off to kitchen.  He returns with a dish rag and
             begins cleaning up)
   I touch you and it's like touching an ice tray, that or a
   fish.
              (he exits to kitchen)
   Don't you think that after thirteen years we could at least
   talk this out, finalize something in our goddamn lives.
              (STEVE enters and moves to chair and sits)
   We were suppose to be buddies, right?  Just you and me, you
   promised.  Don't you understand, I need you now.  Always
   have.
              (pause)
   I'm sorry about the screaming before, real sorry.  It must
   be time now, right?  You know I just can't do it myself.

                            STEVE
   I can't.

                            NANCY
   Sure you can.  I mean, Christ, you're suppose to be my
   buddy, right?

                            STEVE
   Right.

                            NANCY
   I just can't do it myself.  You have to help me out, you
   promised.  Just once more and that'll be it.  I'm hanging
   here by a thread.  I'm asking you and I know I shouldn't,
   but I have to.
             (pause)
   Steve?
             (pause)
   No, never mind, it passed.  Let's talk, okay? It must be
   time now, Steve. It's only been a week so far.  A week,
   that's all. I've been good all these years, ten years,
   right?  But I just couldn't help myself last week.  It's all
   this stuff coming back to you, back to me.  It'll be easy to
   get rid of this time.  Only a week.
             (pause)
   Just a light touch is all I need.  Just a drop or two. You
   know I can't do it by myself.  You have to help me in this.
   I don't wanna take too much like I almost did that first
   time.  I always take too much, you know that, you've seen
   that.
             (pause)
   Maybe we can wait.
             (pause)
   I'm gonna go nuts!  SHIT!
             (pause)
   LISTEN MOTHERFUCKER, YOU'RE SUPPOSE TO BE MY FUCKING BUDDY
   IN THIS!
             (pause, then STEVE stands and moves to her,
             he calmly stands looking down at her)

                            STEVE
   Could you stand up for a second.

                            NANCY
   I wanna stay right where I am.

                            STEVE
   Please.

                            NANCY
   No.

                            STEVE
             (gently taking hold of her arm he lifts
             her to her feet)
   Please stand up for a second.
             (pause as they both stand looking into
             each other's eyes)

                            NANCY
   Just wait a few minutes. Wait until we talk some more, okay?

                            STEVE
   Do you want to wait?

                            NANCY
   I got a little excited before.

                            STEVE
   Just whisper.

                            NANCY
             (whispering)
   Do you like the sun this morning? Isn't it nice coming
   through the window like that?
             (STEVE reaches to the sofa and pulls out a small
             dark brown leather bag. He then gently sits NANCY
             back down)
   I saw the sun come up this morning. It was the first thing I
   saw when I opened my eyes. That's nice, don't ya think?

                            STEVE
             (moving back to the chair by the window, he sits)
   Real nice.

                            NANCY
   Yeah, real nice.
             (she stares at the leather bag. As she speaks
             during the following, her voice will, for a time,
             grow deeper, hoarser)
   You remember Dorothy? The one from the "Wizard of Oz"? You
   know, the Judy Garland character who had this silly little
   dog? Sure, you remember.
             (long pause)
   Now?
             (pause. We begin to see a very small, yet
             perceptible shaking of NANCY's hands. Her eyes
             seem to widen)
   You know something, Steve, I use to think it would be great
   to be Dorothy. You know, searching around looking for the
   right way to go home, the right way to the Emerald City and
   all. That sort of thing, ya know.
             (STEVE continues looking at the unopened bag in
             his lap. NANCY begins to show signs of some inner
             fear.)
   You do know that I didn't do the things you did. I never had
   to kill anybody. You know that, right? I never killed
   anybody, not once.
             (she slowly walks around the room, her eyes
             constantly going back and forth between STEVE and
             the leather bag in his lap.)
   So I can't really know what you know. But I know me, know
   what I had to go through. What I had to do.

                            STEVE
             (reassuringly)
   I know.

                            NANCY
   You like talkin' with me?

                            STEVE
   Yes.

                            NANCY
   Me too.  I mean, I like talkin' with you too.  We're
   buddies, right?

                            STEVE
             (the word "buddy" seems to have an effect
             on him)
   Right.

                            NANCY
   Just like your buddies in the war?  Just like them, right?
   I mean, I fight just like you do, right?  And I had my
   sinkin' in ta the mud, right? We're buddies and we're not
   gonna forget that neither, right?

                            STEVE
   Right.

                            NANCY
   I like that Steve.  I like when we talk like buddies, real
   honest-ta-God war buddies.
             (after a beat, STEVE opens the bag and removes
             a hypodermic needle, a bent spoon, a three
             foot piece of rubber hosing, and a small, clear
             plastic bag that contains a soft, white
             powder.  He then takes out a small candle and
             lights it)
   Sometimes, like right now, I picture myself like I'm sitting
   inside a coloring book with all these furry little animals
   around me.  Ya know what I mean?

                            STEVE
   Yes.
             (STEVE pours some of the white powder into
             the spoon and heats it to a liquid.  All
             through this process, NANCY is looking intently
             at STEVE's every action)

                            NANCY
   Buddies, right?  Buddies like I meet walkin' along that
   yellow brick road.  I meet the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion,
   persons like that. And there's other creatures too.  The
   Walt Disney kind of creatures that are always smilin',
   smilin' that vacant smile with those white, white teeth.
   But I'd color their teeth orange, or maybe purple.  And I'd
   be painted too, filled in between the thick, black lines.
   I'd be filled in by all sorts a colors.  But never pastels,
   never that.
             (once the powder has transformed itself
             into a clear liquid, STEVE fills the needle.
             They both look at each other)
   Ya know the kind a colors I'm talkin' about, Steve?

                            STEVE
   I know.

                            NANCY
             (she slowly moves near him and slides to
             the floor on her knees sitting like a
             small child)
   Ya know, sometimes your eyes are like great big pink and red
   forests, with real tall pine trees, the kind that smell like
   Christmas, the real thick, dark green kind.
             (STEVE stands holding the needle.  He moves
             to NANCY, bends and rolls up her left sleeve)
   And when I look at this coloring book, I see myself meetin'
   up with all these Disney characters: lions and tigers and
   stuff like that.  And I'm ... I'm walkin' along ... just
   walkin', like now ... walkin' and thinkin' a colors, of
   fine, clear, sharp colors.
             (STEVE wraps the rubber hose twice around
             NANCY's upper arm, slaps the arm several
             times causing her to wince, then he quickly
             injects the liquid.  After the process is
             completed he withdraws the needle and removes
             the rubber hose.  He stands looking down at
             her.  A sad, almost forlorn expression crosses
             his face.  NANCY reaches up to him and holds
             on to his arm and slowly pulls herself to
             her feet)
   Ya see, I'm there followin' this dumb road to paradise, and
   I'm movin', shufflin' my little red glass slippers until
   all of a sudden I fall into this very large hole in the
   ground, a well or somethin' like that.
              (STEVE moves back to window, puts equipment
             back in the leather bag, then sits looking
             at NANCY)
   And I'm fallin', and as my body gets lighter and lighter I
   fall past this little white rabbit, one with a pink and
   purple nose.  And this dumb rabbit is clutchin' a great big
   grandfather clock in his little paws.
              (she slowly moves to STEVE, lifts her leg
             up and climbs on the back of his chair, sitting
             on the chair's back.  She slowly begins to
             wrap her legs around his waist, pulling him
             close to her, she takes his head in her
             hands and begins to stroke his hair)
   All of a sudden I'm realizin' that I'm confusin' two
   different fairy tales, mixin' 'em up, ya know.
              (pause)
   I'm mixin' up fairy tales, Stevie.  And before I hit the
   bottom of this well I see a giant house with a great
   over-sized fireplace with warm thick carpets and beautiful
   cut-glass chandeliers. And stain-glass windows too.
              (she takes his head and looks into his
              eyes)
   Ya know, sometimes your eyes are like forests.
              (pause)
   And all these stain-glass windows have pictures that show
   the Child Jesus sucklin', no, pinchin' his Mama's breast,
   the one that's bare, her clean white, ever so holy breast
   with its rounded gray nipple.  And she hurts, Stevie. She
   hurts 'cause he's bitin'  so damn hard, suckin' so strong.
   He's suckin' so hard that she's bleedin', but she's bleedin'
   from her eyes, not her nipple.  Tears of red blood are
   runnin' gently down her China-doll face.  I can see she can
   sense where things are gonna go with her white porcelain
   little boy baby. And all she does is smile, smile that
   pained, seamless smile.  Ya see, she's sacrificing
   somethin', somethin' that she's not even sure of. A mission,
   yeah, that's it, a mission.  She's carvin' the way for her
   boy baby to die, to be torn to shreds by small cartoon
   animals.
             (pause)
   Oh, and ya know what he's gonna do?  He's gonna plead with
   his Papa not to let him go that way.  But Papa is very old
   and very deaf.  Mama's the one that'll have to taste her
   son's tears.  And she prays desperately, so earnestly the
   prayers of the almost dead.  She wants to tell her son of
   the night that was covered in blackness when his Papa came
   to her dressed all in gold and silver, smelling of
   frankincense, wrapped in a thunderstorm.  Tell her son of
   how Papa tore off her robes and dug his large marble hands,
   his steel-coated arms up inside her; grabbed onto her womb
   and yanked so hard, with so much force that he pulled her
   inside out, ripped her womb from her belly and threw it to
   the stone floor, smiling all the while.  And then he wiped
   his wet, dripping hands on her thighs and in her
   golden-brown hair, rubbing away the holy salt water.
             (she begins to rock his head with more
             force)
   And the Papa bear just laughed and said now Mama bear was
   clean, finally clean enough to have his son belch forth upon
   the earth, and that she would have to cry but once.  And
   Papa bear stood there screaming with such a mighty force
   that the sky blurred and the sea turned white.  He shouted
   so loud, so distant: "When you give life you must also give
   death."  And then she knew that she would have to send her
   son far, far away to a place built of rust and fire where
   there are no prayers, where the land is soaking wet from
   tears.
             (pause)
   Are ya feelin' inside yourself now, Stevie?  Do you like the
   way I am?  DO YOU!?
              (softly)
   Like forests sometimes.  Yeah, your eyes, they are.  They're
   like steep cliffs hoverin' over an ocean too.  And what do
   ya see in my eyes, Stevie?
              (pause)

                            STEVE
   Glass.
             (pause)
   Glass, sometimes.

                            NANCY
   Glass?
             (pause)
   Nothin' else?  Glass?  You mean like in tall buildings, or
   glass like in looking-glasses?  Or picture frames, or
   department store windows?  Is it pink glass, cut glass, or
   polished glass?  What kind, Stevie?  LIKE FUCKING GLASS THAT
   DOESN'T BREATHE? I WANNA KNOW!  WHAT KIND DO YA SEE!
             (she violently shoves him to the floor)
   YOU NO GOOD ... YOU CARTOON OF A HUMAN BEING!  GODDAMN YOU
   AND GODDAMN THE DAY I LAID EYES ON YOU!
             (she begins to move around the room always
             looming at STEVE)
   YOU AIMLESS, SELF-CENTERED HUMPING CREEP OF A COW THAT STOLE
   MY LIFE, THAT FUCKED ME GOOD ... THAT SPIT ON ME ... THAT
   SPEWED YOUR ROTTEN SCUM OUTSIDE MY BELLY ... MY BELLY THAT'S
   EMPTY, VACANT BECAUSE OF YOU, BECAUSE OF YOUR MINDLESS
   SELF-PITY!
             (she falls to her knees and speaks to him)
   You're a real fucker there, Stevie boy, a real peach of a
   find.  Look at what you're makin' me do.  Just take a good
   look.  Listen to my ugly mouth screamin' at ya, hatin' your
   every breath. Do ya see me?
             (she begins to crawl toward him.  He has
             remained motionless throughout)
   For God sake, Stevie, look at the two of us.
             (she reaches out and touches him gently)
   For cryin'-out-loud, I'm tryin' to reach out to you.  Do ya
   see that?  I don't wanna stop us from bein' us.
             (pause)
   But I feel okay now.  It's just that the stupid fairy tails
   I have come true sometimes, or seem too.  Stevie, ya gotta
   know that you didn't fight nothin' alone, ya didn't do
   shittail alone.  Ya see, when you left, you left me here to
   my memories of you, left me to my imaginations.
             (pause)
   So I found my little white friend.  Or it found me, no
   matter.
              (pause)
   I'm sorry, really sorry that you had to come home to this.
   I am, really.  But we were doin' okay there for awhile.  I
   did stop.  You helped me stop.  But last week ... all these
   things comin' back ... to you, to me. All our glorious
   ideals, all that we had been taught, all that we were to
   told to believe, all shot ta shit. All of a sudden, you and
   your buddies became the villains.
             (pause)
   And I was clean for so damn long.  It was good, real good.
             (she looks at him)
   You don't hear a word I'm sayin', do ya?

                            STEVE
   I hear you.

                            NANCY
   Do you really?  I wonder.
             (pause)
   But we'll clean it up again, that's all.  You'll see.  But
   we can't bring that time back no more, no more about over
   there, that time.  If you do, I'll never be able to see
   myself again, know who I can become.

                            STEVE
   Yeah, let's let it lie.

                            NANCY
   Yeah, let's do that.  We'll make great love to each other
   again.  We'll fornicate 'til our eyeballs fall out.  We'll
   have parties like we use to. See other people. Talk with
   friends.  Do we have any friends left these days?  No
   matter, we'll just make new ones.
             (pause)
   Right?

                            STEVE
   Right.

                            NANCY
             (she slowly stands, but with some trouble.
             She then begins to walk toward STEVE, stumbling
             every so often.)
   And I won't mix fairy tails anymore.  I promise.  But you
   see, I couldn't take hearin' ya say nothin' and all the
   while knowin' that inside you were hurtin' like you was, I
   mean were.
             (she reaches HIM and stands there
             stroking his hair)
   We can tell good stories and stuff.  Right?

                            STEVE
   Right.

                            NANCY
             (she moves to his side and stumbles
             over his foot and slowly slides down to
             the floor holding on to HIS leg.  She
             nestles next to him.)
   Whooooopssssssieeeeee.  I know that sometimes things'll pop
   up here and there, memories and all, but it's all in the
   past, in our little tiny histories, right?
             (HE slowly touches her gently.  She does
             not seem to feel his touch.)
   And we won't mix up fairytales up anymore.  And ... and we
   can still be buddies and stuff, real friends and all. And
   kids, we'll have kids, lots.  We'll name 'em little so and
   so and such and such.  Right?
              (pause)
   And I can be a woman.

                            STEVE
   Nancy?
             (no response.  She's fallen asleep.)
   Nancy?
             (HE realizes that she's drifted off.
             He moves slowly so that he can take
             her up in his arms.  He then carries
             her to the sofa and lies her down.
             She rolls over hugging the pillow.
             STEVE stands there looking down at
             her for a long moment, then he takes a
             chair and places it beside the sofa
             and sits.)
   I sometimes hear music, a distant kinda music. Like a jazz
   piece, a delicate horn whispering off somewhere.
             (pause)
   I use to hear it all the time. Not much lately, not until
   this mornin'.  It's comin' back to me.
             (HE looks down at HER)
   I think maybe you're right.  You had your own war.
   Somethin' I never saw before, somethin' I never thought
   about before. Everybody has their own wars.  I guess I
   wanted mine to be the biggest, the best, the most special
   war.
             (pause)
   It wasn't, not really.
             (pause)
   Yeah, we'll clean it up again.  A little bit less each time,
   just like that first time.  Less and less.
             (HE touches HER gently, tenderly)
   I love you.
             (pause)
   Buddies.  You and me.  I just don't know what to say
   anymore. It's not you, it's not us ...
   it's ...
              (HE'S lost for words)
   But maybe we can forget all that bullshit.  Can we do that?
              (pause)
   All that killing, all that pain, all for nothing.
              (pause)
   But we'll make it.  We will.  Buddies.
              (pause)
   I love you more than anything in my fucked up life, and when
   ... and ... and I began to think I lost you, you'd given' up
   on me.
              (HE starts to cry very softly)
   All our fairytales are mixed up, they always were but we
   never saw it 'til now.  I guess I'm that dumb white rabbit
   holdin' on to that clock, a clock that stopped too many damn
   years ago.
              (pause)
   Ya know, I just realized somethin'.  You're that music, that
   distant music I use to hear.  It was you all the time, no
   matter where I'd go, that music would be there.  Think I'll
   be able to hear it again, hear that soft jazz playin' softly
   somewhere?
             (pause)
   Yeah, maybe if we work at it ... do a few things ... kids
   aren't such a bad idea.  Just as long as they don't have the
   same screwed up world we had, that we were brought up in.
   Yeah, maybe than.  Why not.
             (pause)
   Sometimes I'm afraid.  Yeah, I am.  I'm afraid.  I'm afraid
   'cause I love you so much, that if I hold you too close, too
   tight, I'll squeeze you to death.
             (HE sits back and just looks at
             HIS sleeping wife)
   I like talkin' with you.  You like talkin' with me? We'll
   make it. I promise.
             (the lights begin to FADE)
   And we'll make up new fairytales, just our own, nobody
   else's. Yeah, our own private fairytales, just you and me.
   Buddies.
             (pause)
   Ya see, once upon a time, in this great big pink and green
   forest, there lived a Mama and a Papa, two nice kinda
   people. And these two nice kinda people had two kids, a boy
   kid and a girl kid.  And they didn't have a lousy two car
   garage either.  None a that stuff for these two real nice
   people.  And one day ...
             (HIS voice trails off as the lights
             go to BLACK)

   |    A New Age: The Centipede Network Of Artists, Poets, & Writers    |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------------|
   |     - An Informational Journey Into A Creative Echonet   [9310]     |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | (C) CopyRight     "I Write, Therefore, I Develop"     By Paul Lauda |
   +=====================================================================+

       Come one, come all! Welcome to Centipede. Established just for
       writers, poets, artists, and anyone who is creative. A place
       for anyone to participate in, to share their poems, and learn
       from all.  A place to share *your* dreams, and philosophies.
       Even a chance to be published in a magazine.

       Centipede offers ten echo areas, such as a general chat area,
       an echo of poetry and literature, and also on dreams and
       speculated history & publishing.  In all of the ten conferences,
       anyone is allowed to post their thoughts, and make new friends.
       For that is what CentNet is here for: for you.  Ever wonder how
       to accent a poem at the right meter?  Well, come join our
       PoetryForum, and everyone would be willing to help you out.
       Have any problems in deciphering your dreams?  Select The Dreams
       echo, and you're questions shall be solved.

       The Network was created on May 16, 1993.  I created this because
       there were no other networks dedicated to such an audience.
       And with the help of Klaus Gerken, Centipede soon started to
       grow, and become active on Bulletin Board Systems.

       I consider Centipede to be a Public Network; however, its a
       specialized network, dealing with any type of creative thinking.
       Therefore, that makes us something quite exotic, since most
       nets are very general and have various topics, not of interest
       to a writer--which is where Centipede steps in!  No more fuss.
       A writer can now download the whole network, without phasing
       out any more conferences, since the whole net pertains to
       the writer's interests.  This means that Centipede has all
       the active topics that any creative user seeks.  And if we
       don't, then one shall be created.

       If you want to find out more about Centipede, give us a call
       at +609-896-3256, and join one of our conferences.  You'll
       not be disappointed!   Or, check out the latest info packet
       being distributed in the format: CENTyymm.[ARCHIVE].
