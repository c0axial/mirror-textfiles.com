   DIVINITY
   ~~~~~~~~

   As if Divinity had catched
   The itch in order to be scratch'd,
   Or like a mountebank did wound
   And stab himself with doubts profound
   Only to show with how small pain
   The sores of Faith are cured again,
   Although by woeful proof we find
   They always leave a scar behind.
   He knew the seat of Paradise,
   Could tell in what degree it lies
   And, as he was dispos'd, could prove it
   Below the moon or else above it:
   What Adam dreamt of when his bride
   Came from her closet to his side,
   Whether the devil tempted her
   By an High-Dutch interpreter,
   If either of them had a navel,
   Who first made music malleable
   Whether the serpent, at the fall
   Had cloven feet or none at all,
   All this without a gloss or comment
   He could unriddle in a moment
   In proper terms such as men smatter
   When they throw out and miss the matter.
      For his religion, it is fit
   To match his hearing and his wit,
   'Twas Presbyterian true blue
   For he was of that stubborn crew
   Of errant saints who all men grant
   To be the true church militant
   Such as to build their faith upon
   The holy text of pike and gun;
   Decide all controversy by
   Infallible artillery,
   And prove their doctrine orthodox
   By apostic blows and knocks;
   Call fire sword and desolation
   A godly-thorough reformation
   Which always must be carried on,
   And still is doing but never done,
   As if Religion were intended
   For nothing else but being mended.
   A sect whose chief devotion lies
   In odd preverse antipathies,
   In falling out with that and this
   And finding somewhat all amiss,
   More peevish, cross and splenetic
   Than dog distract or monkey sick
   That with more care keep holy-day
   The wrong, than others in the right way.
   Compound for sins they are inclin'd to,
   Still so preverse and opposite
   As if they worshipp'd God for spite.


                                        -- Samuel Butler, 'Hudibras'
                                           1612 - 1680
   Need anyone say more?

============================================================================

   The Quality of Light in Mt. Oliver
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   It begins where the pavement crumbles
   around abandoned trolley tracks ~
   Mt. Oliver, where even the bars burn down.
   The Goodwill is now a Rent-a-Center
   but the sidewalks are new.

   Brownsville Road is the main drag.
   It will end where it begins
   to be called South Park Road
   at an intersection where a Burger King
   is closed down.  The owner lost his franchise
   gambling with his mistress.

   I thought I was every girl in America, a future
   model, 12 years old with lipstick on my teeth,
   and yet my smile never knew the difference
   between wanting and being,
   walking in painful shoes
   that made my legs look good,
   unashamed of wearing panty hose
   with hotpants, walking past the endless
   bars and churches and the cemeteries
   where I'd learn to say no
   that sounded like thank you
   to boys named Michael
   who would turn me on
   to my first beer, my first dope,
   my first regrets:  acquired tastes
   are the source of all desperation.

   But just to be 16 again ~ listening to Bob Seger
   sing "Main Street" out of someone else's car,
   making love to Michael on a hill
   without knowing how steep it was
   till we caught our breath at the bottom,
   wishing the moon would just close its eyes,
   at least wink.

   And here I am age 33, walking down this same street
   and men annoy me with their horn blowing,
   as if I'd get in, as if the moon didn't
   stare holes in me, as if my heart wasn't a sieve.

   Disgust made me patient
   and patience keeps me here.
   But there's no shame in getting picked up
   if you're left off right.

   I love silk cemetery flowers, purple,
   folds full of snow.  I continue walking,
   dressed like someone who thinks she's a movie star,
   as compared to how a real movie star would dress.

   The difference is supposed to be
   some kind of embarrassment
   but here hair reigns high
   and nails grow long and proud
   and we're not pretending
   that we're pretending.
   It's this difference
   that makes Mt. Oliver
   feel like home,
   feel like no and thank you.

   I see a grave digger taking a nap on a coffin
   whose corpse waits for the ground.
   There is a difference.

   BLEMISHED
   ~~~~~~~~~

   The octave of us is an avenue
   of blackbirds with marbolized wings
   As the blacksnake licks the bobcat
   in a herculean daze.

   Your impotent homeland spread
   the last deep-sea of freckles
   on your icey, olive face.

   Your blemished hands belong on you like
   Auburn liquer on pale blue tablecloths.

   I swim in the black of your eye until it
   liquifies ;like blues in autumn.

   We talk like friends of jewel and berry bandits
   Erasing halls of bored handwriting.


                                        -- Allison Eir Jenks

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   MINERALS
   ~~~~~~~~

   Rays from his barren eyes
   Collect the cranberry air,
   Rain'fall carries the temper
   of comets to the crib.

   Consoled by the concord of thymes,
   minerals and misty plums,

   His blood is baptized
   with the cocoa and
   toffee climate.

   Prancing through the
   crooked underground

   His roots condemn
   the pressure.

   Thoughts of solemn drifts
   Time in laps
   of waves and sun-down.
   His dramatic, purple soul
   lives in the sands
   of wooden music and butterfly leaves.

   Taken back
   Not there but all of this here
   Balances itself like landing tornadoes.


                                        -- Allison Eir Jenks

   STARHEART
   ~~~~~~~~~

   Shard blackness in flame
   Shred infinite silence with screams....
   Atom to atom wrenched
   Nuclei dissevered, expanded, exploded and

   Holocaust visits outer realms
   Gas clouds and dust swirls that imitate
   Galactic nebula until

   StarHeart bursts in sweeping gouts
   Of stellar blood
   Shed in expiation for its inner fires
   Its gravity beyond all weight and time

   [STARHEART -- computer-assisted

   Atom to atom wrenched
   Galactic nebulae until
   Gas clouds and dust swirls...imitate
   Holocaust visits outer realms

   Gravity beyond all weight and time.

   THE HEAVEN THAT I SEEK
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   on earth lies hidden
   memory of sage and shadow and
   silence
   beneath crisp Idaho skies

   lies unbidden lonely
   laughter
   all that remains of
   years passed

   lies captured glimpse
   of cloud; whiff of grape;
   peculiar, angular heat of August
   sunset

   lies raptured glance
   of blue, deep-ice-pure blue
   above a dizzying arc
   of smiles


                                        -- Michael Collings

============================================================================

   extinguish
   ~~~~~~~~~~

   hollow eyes watching an empty world;
   the stain spreads like the smile on god's ugly face.
   a million lights slowly join in his sickening song -
   a wall of tortured screams, a flood of amputated cries.

   glassy, pre-approved visions pass before the cogs,
   in planned spontaneity.
   the snuffed few, a blinded reminder to sanctity --
   building on the solid foundation of the crushed.

   a praise to envy;
   malice purring in a once-warm bed.
   a caressing hand, the other holds a bloodied knife -
   and the audience's role is to be fooled (again).

   the noose snaps tight,
   the crowd explodes at the sight of blood,
   and falls to its knees before it's corrugated idols;
   the ceremony repeats.

       . . .

   stamped impressions,
   propagated lies -
   our love is for those who use us,
   beat us,
   tear us down and
   leave.

   prophets and filthy liars - we know on what they feed.
   give one more scapegoat, slay to deny the guilt.
   we love most those who rape us,
   and watch us tremble at their feet.

   everything is a commodity,
   shit, blood and cum.
   taken by force or sold, it's all a matter of pricing;
   of moving pawns in a pawn-shop.

   human mercy - an existence by other's pleasure;
   worship in trade for bread and circuses,
   pity for a fuck,
   crucifixion for encroachment.

       . . .

   smash the light that shines above us -
   i don't want to watch this any more.

   SIX BY SIX
   ~~~~~~~~~~

   Fifty miles outside Barstow I walk into the desert
   the rain driving into the sand like micro meteors
   me my gun and shovel among cactus and rock
   forsaken by man getting the last laugh anyway freezing
   and sweating long after its tormentors and violators
   are gone I pick a place and start to dig six by six
   the rain pouring off my body I pick up the gun
   aim it to my head pulling  back the hammer
   hoping it won't be long before someone comes
   along and finishes the job.

   RELATIONSHIPS
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The idea was to beak bread eat in peace
   but you couldn't and wouldn't plugging in
   propaganda tape #23 an attempt to revise
   history never letting it go never seeing anyone
   else's pain and grief  only your own
   and like always I pulled out my drill
   struck deep the bit finding it's way
   to your soul opening up skin and blood
   the moisture of your feelings exposed to
   fresh air once again and I felt bad because
   I had gone too deep and when I withdrew
   I tried to pour syrup on your open wound
   the dark sticky liquid burning your nerve ends
   that much more like raw flesh exposed to salt
   as long as we live we'll never get it straight
   between us isn't it time we quit trying?

   OCTOBER 28, 1967
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   A hook shaped pipe a saucer like object attached at the end
   stuck in the middle a single bulb it shines down on
   a faded sign whispering gas and food at the foot of the
   highway behind the glass case candy bars and smokes
   look up with vacant eyes their many colors faded from
   the desert's hot sun and lack of consumer traffic
   ninety miles away steel and chrome compete with
   concrete and sad memories all of us gazing at the same
   sun waiting for the black comfort of night where we'll
   stare at the same moon an occasional semi breaking
   concentration in a symphony of fumes and noise
   I string the rope over a wooden two by four weather
   worn put up by hands long gone I stand on a milk crate
   ready to swim in liquid fire will the breast stroke work
   or should I try the crawl? I kick the box out and dangle
   until the first rays of the sun greet my swollen and blue
   body careful cutting me down my soul's resting near by
   like a an ugly wet animal free from its egg.

   All-ways
   ~~~~~~~~

   Killing, killing, killing!
   Everyone is killing
   They love to kill.
   On the computer they kill
   They kill, they stay at home
   They're naked, they're sitting
   In front of the computer
   They're killing.

   That's all they're doing
   Is killing...
   Killing, killing, killing,
   Constantly killing
   You go outside,
   You see a bug,
   And you kill it.

   You kill--
   And you want to kill
   Somebody
   I want to kill that
   Person
   And I want to kill
   Somebody
   And you're on the highway
   And you're saying:
   "I'm gonna take my car
   and I'm gonna kill someone!"
   Then you might say,
   "I'm gonna drive my car
   into that wall
   and kill myself!"

   What is killing
   All the time,
   What is all this killing?

   Life is always!
   Life is always...
   Some people will
   Look back at my life
   In all-ways...
   And
   Always
   See my life
   All ways...

   There's all ways
   To do it
   Live-- life--
   The always life
   The life you'll
   Always live will
   Always be your life
   The life you live...

   All-ways...

   umm
   ~~~

   So the cranberries sit on the table
   Not berries, more like a gel
   A gel retaining the curves of the tin.
   So it rests in the center of the table,
   Jiggling every now and then as a grandparent
   or an Aunt decides to stretch over for the potatoes
   Instead of asking.  We kids at the small table
   May not have a tin of cranberries, but at least
   We know how to ask.  They breathe through mouths
   Decades old, filled and stuffed, crammed
   with fats and sweets, exhaling now,
   Inhaling, exhaling and now pausing to eat more.
   The food wobbles down their throats and passes to their stomachs.
   From under their chins, human fat hangs,
   Dripping like tired candle wax, and stinking of rotted meat.
   They try to hide it, packing it under tight blouses and trousers,
   Defying truth with lines, curves, and popular designs-
   When they go home, the belts come undone
   The tight clothing is peeled away.
   They sit in the center of their houses,
   Tired, fat and content.  Jiggling
   With laughter at slapstick on the tube.
   The fat bounces freely now,
   But they retain the shape of their tins.

   Whispers
   ~~~~~~~~

   Invaded shadow
   Smoke-woven lace
   A silhouette
   And whispered face
   Stirrings, ancient
   Silence- wild
   Remembrance-
   So faintly riled
   Pleading hearts,
   Myopic sight
   Destiny...
   Whispers the Night.

   Quests?
   ~~~~~~

   A quest of greater depth
   Lies behind my outer eyes
   While here, I'm forced to choose
   From evils, ill advised..
   Outer paths scream,
   Inner doors invisible
   A stoic blur to me -
   A mind and soul divisible?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Desire
   ~~~~~~

   There's a Passion in Not Having
   And to Lack has strange appeal
   In a Yearning for Receiving
   Never doubting what we feel-
   A momentum in the Wanting
   To Desire is to Be!
   The Obsession for Possession
   Is the Blessing, not the Yield.

============================================================================

   I ran through her hair today.
   It was like sweet vegetable-smelling perfume.
   I told her she was awful.
   "That," she said, "is exactly what my mother says."
   We rolled down hills together
   And kissed in the tall grass at the bottom.
   We walked through wooded paths,
   Where she fell into the water,
   And made us turn back.
   We froze in a tent together,
   While my friends in the next tent
   Wondered what those noises were.
   And then we talked.
   And now I am afraid.

   The Call of the Modern Bard
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   I watch the sky,
   the stars going by,
   thoughts alite in my mind,
   like so many stars,
   a song I have to find.

   A tune floats by
   as a shooting star streaks
   forming the foundings of my tale,
   of magic, battles, and knights,
   and grand starships under sail.

   Thus I dream the
   stories of a modern bard,
   known to but few;
   for today who has time
   to listen to a little rhyme?

   Rachel
   ~~~~~~

   I saw her by the gate
   as I walked into town.
   I did not walk slower
   than my normal rate,
   for; she is a god.
   How could I explain
   to her if I block the lane?

   It was not not lust
   made me feel I must.
   Her stride, grace, told
   what I needed to know.
   She was another of the stars,
   child of the moon.
   Like me - a creature unalike.

   I talked to her one day,
   she smiled my fear away.
   "Why dost thou fear,
   for thou art of the stars"
   she said to me then,
   and I knew from that moment,
   She was my one.

   But oh what temptors fates are,!
   for I had met my true love,
   my one love to care,
   and never another would come,
   no one would part us we declared.
   Throwing caution to fates
   our love was true.

   She an elf and I an elf
   we could not deny the call;
   that call to confirm our love
   beneath the stars above.
   But our night came cloaked
   a gray and moonless pall
   where mists clung low.

   I know now it was not meant,
   for as we lie together on the
   hill confirming our love,
   to us came black-cloaked
   death; pall-bearer for one
   of us; I knew he would not wait;
   Fate had played her hand.

   I lie now wondering;
   was it her he demanded,
   or was it I who refused -
   refused to take fate
   in my hands
   and change it all;
   what was commanded.

   Ode to Optimism
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   I don't know you
   but that's okay
   you don't know me.
   but we'll meet someday.

   You in your world
   as lonely as I
   here in my own.
   under the same sky.

   Memories yet to be
   the days gone by
   are yet to pass.
   no more shall we cry.

   Stronger love than this
   neither of us knows
   until we cross paths.
   In your arms I'll doze.

   Every day that goes by and still

   LIX

   One goes on ever hoping that in the end
   It finishes correct.  That all the fears will
   Come to naught. That all the hoping will
   Endeavor to correct the nights so often

   Fraught with fevers, madness and desire.
   It is with fire we collect the rope of each
   demeanor.  It is with flame we argue first
   Against what we should know; and then against

   What we have found as truth, hidden deep within
   our understanding.  Not a simple thing to just
   let go.  Like a graven image we confront

   and find it is our own.  Love is like this.
   The quest for love is often fatal.  A lover's leap,
   a full clear view: ashen bones piled there below.

   There is little of an empire where dust collects.
   And even less where brothers do not answer brothers.
   The sword is like a twin blade and the grand portals
   Of Janus always stand open to the arsenal.  No one

   Answers others in distress; it is only looting for oneself
   That measures brawn for brawn and strength for strength.
   Where power is the argument, and destruction falls
   As answer to the common lot.  Dust to dust the empire
      clings.

   The wounded do not touch the water lest the water
   Be sweet poison.  No one wants to die, but the argument
   Persists:  blind slavery or freedom's death.  There

   Is no compromise.  And history persists to blow the
   Footprints from the ground.  The victor triumphs. And we
   Who are so small content ourselves with nothing.

   LXI

   So it's come to this that I must flee from her
   Who so captured my mind that I could never be the same.
   I must depart from her in body and in mind.  I must put
   Distance between myself and this great longing in my heart.

   Her life and mine are not the same.  There is no hope
   That even one clear night could bond a fond remembrance.
   The autumn leaves have such full shadows that I crave
   To be among them, lost -- how heavy is my atrophy.

   Once I thought there could be something; but a spark
   And nothing more.  A flash of light that dissipated
   As soon as it was there.  It was obvious, and took

   This poor fool so long to see.  I do not blame her.
   She has not been different from how she was before.
   It was I who wished a future that could never be.

    vivant.

    *PAVILLON KRISTOF - SALON - INT. JOUR*

    ___Un salon modeste. Au centre de la piece une grande table. Un

    symphonie moderne. (pause) A vrai dire, j'ai invente une
    nouvelle facon pour trouver le theme principal d'une
    composition. (pause) Donc, vous mettez mon casque sur votre tete

    Ah, il travaille chez... Il est chez monsieur Paco Raban !
    (pause) Monsieur Lazar dit qu'il est un vrai genie. Moi, je ne
    sais pas. Je n'ai jamais vu les creations de ce mec. Chez nous,
    on travaille de jour a nuit. (off) Oui, oui, la collection

    *PAVILLON KRISTOF - SALON - INT. JOUR*

    ___La camera fixe le visage de Kristof.

    choisit sa philosophie. (pause) La mienne ? Comme l'avocat, je
    ne peux que plaider pour la vie, (en souriant) meme dans mon
    lit. (pause) Suis-je mauvaise ? Une femme n'est jamais mauvaise,
    son corps cree un autre corps, (en souriant) et une ame avec.

    ___On passe a un plan rapproche de professer.

    LE PROF. (face camera) Bien sur, Napoleon n'est pas un heros

    *ATELIER LAZAR - INT. JOUR*

    ___Derriere Lazar, un poster de general Mladic. Lazar assis sur
    une chaise.

    *GALERIE NADA - SALLE - INT. JOUR*

    ___Une femme de trente cinq ans, Nada Cisie, en tailleur.

    NADA. Alors, un historien, ce machin serve a quoi ? Pour manger
    tous nos carottes. Napoleon aujourd'hui, le betisier de ce type

    parce qu'il ose dire que Napoleon dirige avec ce machin la-bas.

    *BANC MONTMARTRE - EXT. JOUR*

    ___Kristof tres perplexe.

    KRISTOF. Le futur n'existe pas. Quand je touche ce banc, il se

    Zaaaaap - timtamtamtim - zaaaap ! Le rhytme de notre univers.

    ___Letitia, une jeune femme, vient et s'assis aupres de Kristof.

    LETITIA. J'ai achete un bon bouquin pour toi, mon cher.

    KRISTOF. Bouquin, quel bouquin ? Je n'ai rien demande.

    LETITIA. Comment devenir normal, en 40 lecons !

    KRISTOF. Ce n'est pas le sujet de...

    LETITIA. Ce n'est pas le sujet de mon fou. Onze cordes de je
    n'sais pas quoi ! Napoleon aux cieux ! La musique sans aucun
    sentiment...

    KRISTOF. E, ma belle, tu bouges bien.

    LETITIA. Je ne bouge pas, je vomis.

    *ATELIER LAZAR - INT. NUIT*

    ___Lazar est derriere son chevalet.

    LAZAR. La guerre, cela fait du bien. Conquerir le monde, violer,
    voler, bruler. (pause) Mon art fervent predit la fin de ce monde
    pourri. Un dieu re-createur viendra... (l'air tres responsable)
    Je sais, Napoleon est son apotre. (pause) Imaginez la France,
    grande et jolie, comme le maitre absolu d'un monde tres nouveau,
    different, different, different.

    *APPARTEMENT BO - CUISINE - INT. JOUR*

    ___Bo prepare un sandwich.

    BO. Il n'est jamais trop tard pour devenir heureuse, meme avec
    un homme. (pause) J'aime quand il m'attrape par derriere, quand
    il viole mes principes catholiques. (pause) Non, je ne crois
    pas, mais j'y tiens, (en souriant) quand meme. (pause) Mon
    dieu ? C'est la verite. L'argent, surtout pas l'argent !

   |    A New Age: The Centipede Network Of Artists, Poets, & Writers    |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------------|
   |     - An Informational Journey Into A Creative Echonet   [9310]     |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | (C) CopyRight     "I Write, Therefore, I Develop"     By Paul Lauda |
   +=====================================================================+

       Come one, come all! Welcome to Centipede. Established just for
       writers, poets, artists, and anyone who is creative. A place
       for anyone to participate in, to share their poems, and learn
       from all.  A place to share *your* dreams, and philosophies.
       Even a chance to be published in a magazine.

       Centipede offers ten echo areas, such as a general chat area,
       an echo of poetry and literature, and also on dreams and
       speculated history & publishing.  In all of the ten conferences,
       anyone is allowed to post their thoughts, and make new friends.
       For that is what CentNet is here for: for you.  Ever wonder how
       to accent a poem at the right meter?  Well, come join our
       PoetryForum, and everyone would be willing to help you out.
       Have any problems in deciphering your dreams?  Select The Dreams
       echo, and you're questions shall be solved.

       The Network was created on May 16, 1993.  I created this because
       there were no other networks dedicated to such an audience.
       And with the help of Klaus Gerken, Centipede soon started to
       grow, and become active on Bulletin Board Systems.

       I consider Centipede to be a Public Network; however, its a
       specialized network, dealing with any type of creative thinking.
       Therefore, that makes us something quite exotic, since most
       nets are very general and have various topics, not of interest
       to a writer--which is where Centipede steps in!  No more fuss.
       A writer can now download the whole network, without phasing
       out any more conferences, since the whole net pertains to
       the writer's interests.  This means that Centipede has all
       the active topics that any creative user seeks.  And if we
       don't, then one shall be created.

       Feel free to drop by and take a look at Centipede; simply dial up
       BITTER BUTTER BBS at 1-503-692-5841, enter "downloader" as the name,
       and "guest" as the password for fast access.
