Welcome to the third release of The NASTY JOURNAL! Let me start off by
telling you what has happened during the past few months.
    Someone had created an account on a ROLM CBX with the account name of
NASTY.  After this happened DAMAGED SECTORZ, and CYBER LINK were busted.
JAMES BROWN gave his computer away (he lives near CYBER LINK and is a
close friend of his), and a handfull of other people were busted. All of 
which were asked questions about NASTY.
    I have retired from Hacking & Phreaking, all I will be doing is editing
the NASTY journal, and writing for it. You may see me on a few boards and
chat systems, but that's about it.
    After NASTY had all but disappeared alot of rumors had started. these
rumors ranged from me getting busted, to Corrupt saying that he had crushed
NASTY with his thumb. His comments led to NASTY JOURNAL RELEASE 2, not really
a Journal, but it was very intresting to say the least!
    After a long period of Chaos NASTY managed to survive.  Now NASTY
consists of only three  members, there is room for expansion. There is
no set time for release of a new journal, it could be in a month, two days,
or never. It all depends on you. Our intention is to create a
conglomerate of information from various sources in order to obtain a
uniform Journal.
    If you wish to write for the NASTY journal, have any news, rumors, gossip
or you just have a question or comment, please mail us at:

    The future plans and wishes I have for NASTY are:
 
                 1. That we get a good programmer in 'C'.
 
                                    and 
 
                 2. I plan to set up a UNIX for use by NASTY. 
 
Well, until the next Journal, or in the ever growing underground-

Prior to 1960 the network consisted of:

Analog Electromechanical Switching System

   - End Office (EO)
     A switching system where customer station loops are terminated for
     purpose of interconnection to each other and to trunks for access to the
     network.

   - Toll Offices
     Toll offices such as the ToIl Center (TC) and Primary Center (PC) are
     tandem switching system that establishes trunk-to-trunk connection.
     Analog transmission system were used throughout the network.

   - Voice Frequency (VF) metallic cable pairs in the subscriber loop and
     also in the inter-office facility environment.

   - Frequency-Division Multiplexing (FDM) carrier system in the inter-city
     environment.

   The first presentation of digital technology in the network was with the
introduction of "T"-carrier in the inter-office facility environment. "T"
carrier provides the opportunity to improve the economics of providing
communications between Central Offices and also improve the quality of the
transmission.uality of transmission. During the same time period the first
Analog Electronic Switching System (ESS) with Stored program Control (SPC)
was installed.

  The Digital Toll Switch (No. 4ESS) was introduced in 1976. Use of digital
inter-office facilities increased. Analog pair-gainsystems were used in the
Subscriber Loop Plan primarily as temporary solutions regarding facility
exhaust problems. Fiber optic systems began to penetrate exhaust problems.
Fiber optic systems began to penetrate the interoffice facility area of the
network in the late 1970's.

Use of Digital Toll Switching and Digital Interoffice facilities continued to
grow. Analog Remote Switching Units (RSU), served by analog host ESS were
introduced. Digital pair-gain systems were introduced as long-term facility
alternatives in the subscriber loop plant. Penetration of fiber opticsystem
moved into the inter-city enviroment of the network.

   Local Digital Switches and Digital Remote Switch Unit (RSU) were
introduced during the 1980's. Fiber optic systems began to penetrate the
Subscriber Loop Plant. The Modified Final Judgement (MFJ) requird AT&T to
divest itself of ownership of the Bell Operating Companies (BOC). One of the
provisions of the MFJ is that the BOCs must furnish equal access to the
network to all Interexchange Carriers (IC). The combined access tandem/LATA
tandem office may provide the equal access and the LATA tandem switching

3   PULSE CODE MODULATION (PCM) THEORY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Analog Signal

   An analog signal is a signal in the form of a continuously varing physical
quantity such as voltage, which represents variations in another quantity,
such as the loudness of the human voice. In other words, we use electrical
waves to represent (or be analogous to) the acoustical speech waves generated
by the human voice.

Characteristics of the analog signal are:

   1.  It is continuous in time, and
   
   2.  All values are permitted (within the _+_ maximum limits defined).


Analog Transmission

   The purpose of the ideal transmission channel is to deliver an accurate
reproduction of the original signal to the receiving terminal. Transmission
of analog signals involves three major impairments-

    LOSS       -  Attenuation of the information signal
   
    NOISE      -  Unwanted electrical signals that interfere with the
                  information signal
   DISTORTION  -  Changing the information signal waveform

   
Loss can be overcome by introducing an amplifier to restore the signal to
its original amplitude. However, since the amplified cannot differentiate
between signal and noise, it amplifies the noise as well as anydistortion in
the signal. The amplified noise and distortion is now part of the input
signal for the next section of the analog transmission line.
   As the length of the analog transmission line increases, more amplifiers
must be used, and effect of noise and distortion accumulates. The cumulative
effect of noise and distortion can be minimized by proper system design and
component selection - but it cannot be eliminated. Noise and distortion
generally control the maximum design length of an analog transmission system.

     8-Bit Binary Number = 2^8 or 256 discrete values



   Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)

   - Uses 8-bit binary numbers to represent periodic samples of the speech
     signal (or analog signal).

   - The pulses are of equal higth and width.
 
   - The information content of the digital (or PCM) signal is carried by the
     presence or absence of the pulses - not the shape of the pulses.

   Characteristics of the digital (PCM) signal are:

   1. It is discrete in time (non-continuous).

   2. It is discrete in value (only 256 levels are permitted.


   The major advantage of digital (PCM) transmission comes from the use of
regenerative repeaters.
   The digital signal is distorted by the loss, noise and distortion
characteristics of the transmission line. When the distorted signal arrives
at the input of the regenerative repeater, it is examined during each bit
position-

   - If the input signal exceeds a designed threshold level, the
     repeatdecides there is a pulse in that position, and the repeater
     generates a new pulse.

   - If the input signal dose not exceed the threshold level, the repeater
     decides there is no pulse in that bit position, and no pulse is
     generated.


   In this manner, the digital signal is re-generated (rather than amplified)
at each repeater, and the effects of transmission impairments on the waveform
are eliminated at repeater.
    Speech signals start at the transmitter button of a telephone set as an
analog signal. To carry the "information" in the analog signal over a digital
transmission line, it is nessary to convert the analog signal to a digital
signal. The process that bell uses is called Pulse Code Modulation, or PCM.
PCM essentially uses three steps in the analog to digital conversion.

   1. Sampling - the analog signal is sampled periodically. Each sample
      generates a PAM (Pulse Amplitude Modulation) signal, with an amplitude
      equal to the amplitude of the analog signal.

   2. Quantizing - the amplitude (or hight) of the PAM signal is "measured"
      to derive a number that represents its amplitude level.

   3. Encoding - the decimel (base 10) number derived in the quantizing step,
      is then converted to its equivalent 8-bit binary number.


   Since this process converts one instantaneous value of the analog signal
into an 8-bit word, it is obviously nessary to repeat the process many times
a second. Now that you have a overview of this process, lets look a little
closer at the individual steps.

Sampling -

   The first step in the analog-to-digital conversion is sampling. The analog
signal is sampled periodically to determine its instantaneous value at
different points in time. Each time the signal is sampled, Bell generate a
PAM (Pulse Amplitude Modulation) signal. The PAM signals are pulses with
uniform width, but varing in amplitude (or hight). the amplitude of each PAM
signal represents the instantaneous amplitude of the ana;og signa; represents
the instantaneous amplitude of the analog signal at one point in time.
   The rate that we sample the analog signal, and is based on the Nyquist
sampling theorem. This theorem says:

    If a band-limited signal is sampled at regular intervals of time and at a
    rate equal to or higher than twice the highest significant signal
    frequency, then the samples contain all the information of the original
    signal. The original signal may be reconstructed by use of a low-pass
    filter.

The standard sampling rate for telephone-band transmission is 8000 times a
second. Theoretically this would limit the voiceband signals to 4000 Hz, due to
imperfect filter characteristics.


Quantizing -

  Is essentially matching the PAM signals to a segmented scale. The purpose
of quantizing is to "measure" the amplitude (or height) of each PAM signal
coming from the sampling step, and assign an integer (whole) number between 0
and -\+127 to define the amplitude of each PAM signal. Once a number has been
assigned, the next step in the analog-to-digital conversion is encoding.

Encoding -

   Involves the conversion of the number that was determined in the
Quantizing step, to a binary number. Each quantized PAM signal is converted
to an 8-bit binary "word", in which each bit may be either a "1" (pulse) or a
"0" (no pulse). The 8-bit "word" represents the binary equivalent of the
number from the quantizing step.

For Example:

   If the PAM signal "measures" +47 on the quantizing scale, the output of
the encoding step is the 8-bit word "10101101" (i.e. the binary equivalent of
+45).

The binary word consists of pulses for binary one and no pulses for
binary zerors. Each bit is weighted by some power of two (2). Except fot the

   In quantizing, PAM signals do nto always match exactly with the step on
the quantizing scale. For example, a PAM signal may measure +1/2, or +4 1/2,
or +124 1/2 or any fraction of a step.
   Since an 8-bit word limits us to 256 discrete number, only whole number.
For example, a PAM signal that "measures" + 4-1/2 might be  rounded up to +5
and encoded as "10000101". When  the distant terminal decodes this binary
number, it will rebuild a PAM signal exactly +5 unit high. As a result, the
system has introduced an error of +1/2 in the encoding and transmission of
that PAM signal. This error is called quantizing error or quantizing
distortion.
   Quantizing error or distortion is perceived by the listener as noise or
"graininess" of the signal.


   If we use a linear scale (equal steps), and decide to round up or down at
the half way point in the step, the maximum error that can be introduced is
-/+ 1/2. When that error (or distortion) is compared to the relative signal
level however, the ratio of signal-to-quantizing distortion (S/D ratio) is
much worse for low-level signals than for high-level signals.
   Since it is much more likely in speech transmission to have lowlevel
signals than high-level signals, linear quantizing would give us the poorest
S/D ratio in the area where most of the spech energy falls (i.e. low-level
signals).
   One solution might be to decrease, the size of the quantizing steps (i.e.
use more steps in the linear scale). For example experiments have shown that
a satisfactory S/D ratio for lowlevel signals can be odtained by using a
linear scale with 2048 step; but this would require an 11-bit word to encode
and a much larger bandwidth to transmit.

Quantizing With A Non-Linear Scale

   Another solution is to use a non-linear scale (unequal steps). Bell can
improve the S/D ratio for low-level signals by using smaller steps in the
lower amplitude portion of the scale, at the expense of the high-level
signals. Since the range of amplitudes has not changed, and we only have 256
steps to work with, Bell has to make the steps larger in the higher amplitude
portion of the scale. Ideally Bell would like to have a uniform S/D ratio
across the entire range of amplitudes.

 Companding  generally describes the methods used to reduce noise during the
transmission of low-level speech signals and during quiting intervals. In
todays standaed PCM system, companding is provided through the use of
non-linear quantizing scales in the encoding and decoding of speech signals.
  The design of the non-linear scale is defined by one of two modified
logarithmic formulas.

  - The companding formula used in North American standard systems (USA and
    Canada) is called MU-255.

  - The companding formula used in CCITT standard system is called A-LAW.


  CCITT standaed systems also differ from North American systems in the
number of channels and the transmission line bit rate. Since Bell dose not
comply with CCITT standars, Bell has to have the reaponsibility to provide
the conversion of the CCITT signal format to the North American signal format
when we interconnect the two systems.

The Analog-to-Digital Conversion essentally involves three steps:

   1. SAMPLING - The analog signal is sampled at periodic intervals. The
      output of the sampling step is a PAM (Pulse Amplityde Modulation)
      siganl.

   2. QUANTIZING - In this step the PAM signal is matched to a segmented
      scale. The purpose of this step is to "measure" the amplitude (or
      height) of the PAM signal and assign an integer number that defines
      that amplitude.
   
    3. ENCODING - In this step the integer base-10 number converted to an
      8-bit binary number. The output is an 8 bit "word", in which each bit
      may be either a "1" (pulse) or a "0" (no pulse).
   This process is repeated 8000 times a second for telephone voice cannel
service.

      PCM Signal                PAM Signals                   Analog Signal


 After the Digital (PCM) signal is transmitted to the receiving terminal , it
must be converted back to an Analog signal. The Digital-to-Analog conversion
essantially consists of two steps:

  1. DECODING - The recived 8-bit "word" is decoded to recover the number
     that defines the amplitude of that sample. This information is used to
     rebuild a PAM signal of the orginal amplitude.

  2. FILTERING - The PAM signal of the original amplitude. When the 8000 PAM
     signals (per second) are passed through the filter, it reconstructs the
     original Analog waveform.


Single Channel PCM

   So far, I have discussed the Analog-to-Digital conversion for a signal
voice channel or circuit. If the Analog signal is sampled 8000 times a
second, there will be 8000 PAM signals per second, there will be 1/8000
seconds (or 125 microseconds) apart.
   The 8-bit word that is generated for each PAM signal can be transmitted in
a fraction of the 1/8000 second time frame. If Bell transmitted the single
channel PCM signal down the transmission line, there would be a considerable
amount of time between samples when the line would be a considerable amount
of transmission line, there would be a considerable amount of time between
samples when the line would not be "used".
   TIME DIVISION MULTIPLEXING takes advantage of the unused time between
samples of a single channel or circuit. In the standard North American PCM
system, 24 channels are time division multiplexed together and transmitted
over a common line.
   The 24 channels are sampled sequentially so that the PAM signals for
channels 2 through 24 occupy the time interval between subsequent PAM signals
for channel 1. Each PAM signal may then be passed in turn to a common
quantizer/encoder circuit. Since the PAM signals from the 24 channels are
staggered across the 1/8000 second time frame, the 8-bit words are generated
in sequence across time frame, the 8-bit words are generated in sequence
across that same time frame.
    Within the span of 125 microseconds (1/8000th of a second), an 8-bit
binary word is transmitted serially for each of the 24 channels (8
bit/channels - 192 bits).
   After 192 bits are transmitted, one more bit is added to identify the end
(or beginning) of a FRAME of information. This additional bit (can be a "1"
or a "0") is called the framing bit.
   The framing bit is used to synchronize the transmitting and receiving
terminals. (i.e. The frame bit provides the reciving terminals with a
starting point to separate the incoming bit stream into 8-bit words and
distribute them to the proper channels).
   A FRAME requires 125 microseconds to transmit and contains one encoded
sample (8-bit word) for each channel that is multiplexed, plus the framing
bit. The basic PCM frame contains 193 bits (192 encoded signal bits +1
framing bit).
   The FRAME is sub-divided into TIME SLOTS. A TIME SLOT represents the time
required to transmit one 8-bit word. (One PCM encoded sample).
   The basic PCM bit stream contains 1,544,000 bits/second (8000 frames/second
x 193 bits/frame = 1,544,000 bits/sec.). Every sixth frame Bell robs the last,
or least significant bit of each voice channel and substitute signaling
information in its place (bit robbing).
   Information is extracted by the terminal or machines as it is always in the
same place.

Encoded Unipolar

   Each "1" is transmitted in the positive direction and "o" are reference
level.

Encoded Bipolar

   Every other "1" pulse is alternated in the positive and negative axis.
Effectively cuts the frequency of the line signal in half. Noise bursts cause
two positive or negative pulses in a row, which is recognized as an error
(bipolar violation).

   The 64 Kb/s, Norht American Standard, noted earlier in this lesson,
inherently possesses several transmission qualities. These are:

1. Dynamic Range - having 255 levels enadles PCM to handle a sudstantial
   input signal rage: -40dBm0 to 0dBm0.

2. Signal to Quantizing Distortion - having a S/D of 35 to 40dB enables up to
   10 analog/PCM conversions with minimal adverse affects.

3. In Band Signaling thru bit robbing, signaling is accomplished by utilizing
   the least significant bit of every 6th sample. Ths results in less than
   2.1% of bits robbed with no detectable analog distortion.

4. All Zeros Code treatment - the North American network cannot tolerate more
   than 15 consecutive zeros. Zero code suppression, the changing of the 2nd
   least significant bit of an all Zero PCM word, eliminates the all zero
   problem with minimal impairment.

   These qualities are the reasons that justify the "robust" discryption given
to 64 Kb/s PCM. The cost of these qualities is bandwidth.

ADPCM-DLQ

   Sampling of speech at the Nyquist rate yields sample differences that
differ much less than the original samples differ.
   Differential PCM is premised upon coding the difference between successive
samples. Again, because of the "difference" values in less (4 bit encoding
yields 16 values).
   As the analog signal level varies, so will the difference values vary.
Thus, the differential values and associated levels must be adjusted or
"adapted" based on signal size. The result is Adaptive differential PCM.
   The ability to adjust the quantization levels in an accordion fashion is
called dynamic quantization and is desirable for speech signals. For yones or
voice band data where analog values are constant, the quantization are locked
at an optimum point. Thus, dynamic locking quantizer, or DLQ.
   The net result is an analog signal, sampled at 8000 tiem/second, with the
difference between sample amplitudes being dynamically quantized into one of
16 levels, each level represented by 4 bits. In short, 32 Kb/s ADPCM-DLQ.

ADPCM-DLQ vs. PCM

   In comparing ADPCM-DLQ vs. PCM, both objective and subjective test were
performed:

   1. Assuming equal dynamic range input speech signals, ADPCM-DLQ was
      subjectively evaluated to be very close to PCM.

   2. Objective tests using 4.8Kb, PSK data sets yielded no errors for PCM
      and a 6*10^-7 bit error rate for ADPCM-DLQ with 16 level encoding. A
      3*10^-6 BER was odserved for 15 level ADPCM-DLQ.

   3. In band signaling thru bit robbing reduces ADPCM-DLQ to 15 levels and
      dose degrade its error performance (See Item 2 above).

   4. Zero code suppression dose not appreciably affreciably affect
      ADPCM-DLQ performance.

   5. At data rate greater than 4.8 Kb/s, ADPCM-DLQ contributed unacceptable
      error rates.

   6. PCM yields satisfactory performance for all types of voiceband signals
      with up to 10 analog/PCM conversions. For ADPCM-DLQ with 4.8 Kb/s voice
      band data, standard objectives cannot be guaranteed for more than 3
      back-to-back encodings.

ADPCM-DLQ Applications

   Assuming the CCITT facored standard is implenmeted, the following terminal
configurations could be used:

   1. Transcoding Terminals - input to the terminal are two 64 Kb/s based,
      DS1 signals (48 channels) with an output of single, 32 Kb/s based,
      DS1 signal (48 channels).

   2. Integrating Terminal - input to the terminal are 48 voice channels.
      Output is a single, 32 Kd/s based, DS1 signal.

   3. Bundling Application - where customers require private line trunk
      groups of 11 (or fewer) channels. Each bundle consisting of 11  32 Kb
      channels plus one signaling channel. 4 bundles would then comprise a
      DS1.


In a PCM system:

   Signal is composed of a group of pulses. Repeater looks for a pluses.
Repeater regenerates a new signal instead of amplifying the incoming signal.

                         GRADE OF SERVICE

   As the network becomes more digital, the grade of service should improve
because:

  1.  Loss in digital systems is not length-dependent.

  2.  Noise is controlled by companding, 8-bit word size, and the use of
      regenerative repeaters.

  3.  Distortion is controlled by the use of a nonlinear quantizing scale and
      regenerative repeaters.


                          BANDWIDTH

   Most analog systems require the use of a 4 kilohertz of bandwidth for each
voice channel. In our digital systems, each voice channel is composed of
8,000 8-bit words per second or 64 kilobits per second. The bandwidth
required to transmit this signal is several times greater than 4 kilohertz.
Primarily, this is of concern only in bandwidth-limited transmission systems
such as microwave radio.






4   CHANNEL BANKS AND TERMINALS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


                            OVERVIEW

   The function of the digital facility is to provide 24 voice frequency (VF)
channels from one point to another over a PCM transmission system. The most
basic type of digital facility consists of two elements:

1. Channel Banks (or terminals) and

2. A Transmission System


   The channel banks provide the A/D interface between 24 VF circuits and a
digital (PCM) transmission system. The digital transmission system carries
the time division multiplexed PCM signals between two channel banks. This
section will discuss the channel banks, and other terminal equipment that
generate the PCM signal. The Digital Transmissionsystems will be discussed in
the following section.
   The basic function of the digital channel bank is to provide the VF
analog/PCM interface. On the analog side, the bank terminates 24 VF circuits
(message trunks or special service). On the digital side, the bank terminates
a single 4-wire, 1.544 Mb/s bipolar PCM circuit.

The general functions os the digital channel bank include:


   1. Analog transmission and signaling interface - that is, it provides
      termination for either 2- or 4-wire circuits using various modes of
      signaling.

   2. Analog-to-Digotal and Digital-to-Analog signal conversion - for each
      of the 24 VF channels

   3. Time Division Multiplexing and Demultiplexing

   4. Process signaling and supervision information

   5. Digital Line Interface
      - unipolar to bipolar conversion, clock signals, etc..

   6  Performance monitoring and alarms


   The general structure of a digital channel bank consists of a mounting,
equipped with two types of modular plug-in units. These are channel units
(CU) plug-ins and common unit plug-ins.

Channel Units

   The channel unit (CU) plug-ins provide the following functions for a
single circuit:

   1.  Analog transmission interface
       - the connecting analog circuit may be 2- or 4-wire

   2.  Analog signaling interface
       - The connecting analog circuit may use any of a number of sinagling
         modes
         (i.e. loop, E&M, simplex, etc.)

   3.  Sampling step of the A/D conversion

   4.  Provides a standard interface to the common plug-in units


   There is a variety of different channel units available to provide the
range of transmission and signaling interfaces that are required for the
various message, special service, program, and dataport applications. Each
type of channel unit is equipped cations. Typical options and controls
include:

   1.  Trunk and signaling options

   2.  Attenuation controls

   3.  Balance controls

   4.  Equalization controls


Common Units

The common plug-in units provide fuctions that are shared by all (or part) of
the channels in the digroup, and are generally independent of the types of
channel units used. The principle common functions include:

   1.  Time Division Multiplexing (and Demultiplexing)

   2.  Quantizing and Encoding (and Decoding)

   3.  Digital Transmission Line Interface

   4.  Timing and Synchronization

   5.  Performance Monitoring and Alarms

   6.  Power conversion and distribution


Typically, multiplexing is achieved by multiple wiring, rather than by a
plug-in unit.

   The D5 bank is a 96-channel bank equipped with a microprocessor for
centralizing and automating bank operations (provisioning, maintenance,
etc.). It is anticipated that 8 generic (multi-function) channel units will
provide the capabilities required for the majority of message and special
service applications. These CU's will be conditioned electronically, as
opposed to the manual setting of options with switches and plugs as is done
with today's channel banks.
   A fully-equipped D5 system with a single system controller and 20 channel
banks will accomodate 1920 circuits.

*   A D1D or D2 maybe used with a D3, D4, or D5 bank if the D3, D4, or D5
    bank is optioned to use the channel sequence of the D1D or D2. While D1D
    and D2 banks are signal compatible, their end-to-end use is not
    recommended since their channel sequences are not the same.


Compatibility

There are three types of compatibility that may have to be considered.

   1.  Connecting Circuit Compatibility
       -  Compatibility of a channel unit with the connection VF Circuit

   2.  End-to-End Channel Unit Compatibility
       -  Compatibility of a channel units on either end of a digital
          facility

   3.  End-to-End channel Bank Compatibility
       -  Compatibility of the channel banks on either end of a digital
          facility


   Only end-to-end channel bank compatibility will be discussed here. In order
to be end-to-end compatible, channel banks must use the same coding, signaling,
and digital line format. With the exception of D1A, D1B, and D1C, all D-type
banks are end-to-end compatible. D1A banks may only be used with D1A banks, D1B
with D1B, and D1C with D1C. A D1A may be modified to a D1B. A D1A or D1B may be
modified to a D1D. Both conversions must be performed on an out-of-service
basis.

   Typically, a D-type channel bank will be installed in the transmission
area of the Central Office (CO), with a universal lead set from each channel
cable to a Distibuting Frame (DF). Any channel may be used for either a
message trunk or to other circuit equipment, as required. Message channels
may be cross-connected at the TDF to a designated location on the Trunk Link
Network. Trunk scan and SD functions are provided over individual leads to
the central control processor.
   The principal advantage of this arrangement is the flexibility of using
any channel for any application and to use any channel with any trunk unit.
The DF provides a convenient interface between switchingand transmission
equipment and minimizes the coordination required in planning, engineering,
provisioning, and operations. But, this flexibility comes at a cost --
especially for message trunk applications. The cost is in floor space (for
the D-bank and trunk frame), frame space and cross-connects (terminations on
two frames), cabling (terminations on two frames, plus universal lead sets),
and the wide variety of channel units and trunks units required.

   An alternative for terminating digital trunks on an analog #1/1A ESS
switch is the Digital Carrier Trunk (DCT). With this alternative, the DCT
bank (DCTB) replaces the conventional D bank and eliminates the need for a
separate trunk frame.
   In place of conventional channel units, the DCTB is equipped with Combined
Channel Units (CCU) which perform the ESS trunk circuit functions and channel
units functions in a sigle plug-in unit. The CCU is designed to replace most,
but not all, of the 2-wire #1/1A ESS trunk/channel combinations . Only one
type of CCU is currently used in the DCTB.
   The VF side of each channel position is cabled directly to the Trunk
Distributing Frame (TDF). Since all combinations are 2-wire trunks with
network signaling, only two leads per channel (T&R) need to be cabled to the
TDF.
  Trunks control and many of the routine call processing functions are
provided by the Peripheral Unit Controler (PUC), which is a part of the DCT
frame. The PUC interfaces the Central Control Processor (via Peripheral Unit
Bus leads) and the DCTB channels (via the Digroup Control Unit in the DCTB).
The PUB not only relieves the Central Control Processor of routine call
processing function, but also eliminates the need for individual trunk scan
and scan Distribution leads. The PUC also provides frame diagnostics and
reports frame and facility alarms to the Central Control Processor.
   Normally, the DCT frame is installed in the switching area of the office, due
to PUB lead length restrictions and ESS office grounding requirements.

Advantages of DCT

   The following factors contribute to the economic advantages that DCT may
provide over conventional D bank/trunk frame arrangements.

1.  Floor Space Saving (eliminate trunk frame)

2.  Frame Space & Cross-connect Savings (fewer terminations)

3.  Cabling Saving (fewer leads to cable)

4.  Eliminates Individual Scan & SD Leads

5.  Fewer Types of Trunks & Channel Units to be Stocked

6.  Simplifies Trunk Design

7.  Two-way Trunking (without additional hardware expense)


Considerations in Use of DCT

   DCT can only be used for message trunk applications. DCT cannot be used
for special services since all channels are cabled to the TDF with an
abbreviated lead set. Separate digital facilities are required for special
services. Existing facilities may require grooming or segregation.
   A DCT frame must be dedicated to one switch. In multiswitch offices, a
single DCT frame can be used only for trunks into one switch, due to the link
between the PUC and the Central Control Processor. This may require more
digital facilities and result in lower system fills.
  Use of DCT alters operations and methods. In the conventional
configuration, prior to DCT, the distributing frame between the D bank and
the trunk frame provideed a flexible switch/transmission interface. With DCT,
this well-defined interface no longer exists. The DCT bank ios physically
located in the switching area. Bank and facility alarmes are now reported to
the switching maintenance venters. This change responsibilities, as well as
methods, in various engineering and maintenance groups. Ohter operations
groups, such as circuit provisioning and switch administration, will also be
affected by the elimination of the switch/transmission interface.
   The Digital Carrier Trunk Frame is a 3-bay configuration, 7 ft. high and 6.5
ft. wide. It consists of:

        1  Peripheral Unit Controller (Fully Duplicated)
       10  DCT Banks
        1  DCT Maintenance Bank

   A fully equipped DCT Frame will provide 480 trunks for a single #1 or #1A ESS
switch. It will normally be installed in the switching area of the office,
unually in the area reserved for trunk frames.

Digital Carrier Trunk Bank

 The DCT bank is a 48-channel bank comprised of an A and B digroup. It uses the
same physical mounting as the D4 bank. Each bank consists of 4 shelves, with 12
channel positions per shelf. The bottom 2 shelves make up the A digroup, the top
2 shelves make up the B digroup.
   Except for the Alarm & Digroup Control Unit (A&DCU) or the Digroup Control
Unit (if used), all common unit plug-ins are identical to those used in the D4
bank. DCT can be equipped for the same operational modes as D4, which will be
discussed in the next file. Currently, only type of channel unit, the Combined
Channel Unit (CCU) is used in the DCT bank.

   So far in this file I have talked about converting 24 voice frequncy
channels
into a PCM bit stream. But on many occasions today we have the need to convert
an analog carrier signal (frequency division multiplex) into a PCM bit stream.
For example, L-Carrier or L-Multiplex (LMX) facilities may need to be switch. Or
we may have the need to take ciruits from an analog microwave radio facility and
put them on a digital transmission facility.
   Initially the only way we could convert an L-Carrier (or LMX) group signal to
a PCM bit stream was to use back-to-back channel banks. The L-Carrier group
signal was terminated in A-Ttpe channel bank and demodulated into 12 VF
channels. Each VF channel signal was then taken through a single frequency
signaling set to recover the signaling information. Then the VF and signaling
information could be cross-connected to a D bank channel - to be converted to
PCM and time division multiplexed with 23 other channels.
   This got the job done - but it was expensive. Especially when there were
large numbers of facilities to be connected.

   To minimize the cost of analog-to-digital facility connections, the LT-1 and
LT-1B facility connectors were developed. The LT-1 (or LT-1B) provides the
A-to-D and D-to-A conversions between two 12-Channel 1.544Mb/s PCM signal.
   The incoming L-Carrier group signals (60-108 KHz) are terminated on a
Combiner and Splitter (C/S) unit. The splitter connects the group signal to a
bus shared by 12 channel units. Each channel unit selects the appropriate 4 KHz
band, demodulates the signal to VF, and extracts the SF signaling information.
The VF and signaling information is then sampled before leaving the channel
unit. PAM signals from the 24 channels are time division multiplexed and sent to
the Transmit Unit (TU). The TU quantizes and encodes each PAM signal, inserts
framing ans signaling bits, and sends the signal to the Line Interface Unit
(LIU). The LIU converts the signal to bipolar and sends it to the Digital Access
Unit (DAU). The DAU provides cable equalization and test access to the PCM
signal. The D-to0A conversion.

Per channel options and controls are provided in the channel units to:

1.  Provide insertion loss between the analog and digital channels.

2.  Select signaling options.

3.  Select trunk conditioning options (CGA).

 The principal difference between an LT-1 and LT-1B facility connector is that
the LT-1B offers broader signaling and CGA (Carrier Group Alarm) features. The
LT-1 was designed for message channelapplications - specifically for terminating
L-Carrier (or LMX) message group on the No. 4ESS digital toll switch. The LT-1B
was designed as a general purpose facility connector - where either message or
special service circuits could be carried on the group.
    The physical equipment configuration is essentially the same for both the
LT-1 and LT-1B. Each bank involves a 3-shelf double digroupunit which is 13-1/2"
high and 22" wide. The channel units for digroup A are mounted (by groups) on
the bottom shelf, and the channel units for digroup B are mounted in the top
shelf. The middle shelf contains common plug-in units that are either associated
with digroup A or B,

    e.g.  TU  - Transmit Unit
          RU  - Receive Unit
          ACU - Alarm Control Unit
          C&S - Combiner and Splitter (per group)

or are shared by both digroups,

    e.g.  DAU - Digital Access Unit
          LIU - Line Interface Unit
          SU  - Syndes Unit (SYNchronizer-DESynchronizer)
          PU  - Power Unit

General Trade manufacturers offer similar L-to-T facility connectors, for
example:

LTM-1 Transmultiplexer (ITT)

      -  Which is similar to the LT-1B in both function
         and equipment configuration.

TransMuxtm TM 7400  (Graner)

      -  Similar in function to the LT-1B, but dose not
         involve demodulating to voice frequency. Only
         uses 10 plug-in cards per digroup. Signaling and
         CGA functions are programmable though the use of
         a hand-held unit.

  The LT-2 Transmultiplexer (AT&T) will replace both the LT-1 and LT-1B, and
will bilaterally convert between L-Carrier group signals and PCM signals
without demodulating to voice frequency. Level control, insertion of test
tones, measurement of test tones - as well as options for echo control,
signaling, and trunk processing - will be programmable from a local maintenance
access panel, or remotely from TTY terminal.

                 "The ONLINE National Information Network That
                        Gives You The Information Edge."

PREFACE:
~~~~~~~~

I am currently taking private investigation classes.  The
information gathered for this textfile is from 2 sources.  The first
being directly from the company.  I have obtained the information as I
am currently in the position to resell accounts on the network.  The
second source is my personal experiences thus far in my private
investigations & from PI's who I have spoken with throughout my coarses
& inquiries.

The W.D.I.A. Network consists of over 1000 databases.  W.D.I.A. is
not actually a network, but rather a gateway.  The databases consist of
sources that retain information on credit, DMV, criminal history,
workman's compensation, address forwarding, social security numbers,
aircraft & aircraft licensing, and cross directories.

The National Credit Network is a division of the W.D.I.A
Corporation, an Ohio Corporation having National Headquarters based in
Cincinnati.


THE SYSTEM:
~~~~~~~~~~~

The system is a VAX.  Users may connect to it via an 800 phone
number.  The system supports it's own menu's so you can connect to it
with a regular terminal program. It supports 300-2400 BPS.  Its
connections consist of both leased lines, and switched lines (depending
on what database is being resourced).  Most transactions take
approximately 60 seconds (some take longer, transfer time will be
elaborated on further in this documentation).  They're currently using
AT&T as their long distance carrier.


THE INFORMATION:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This will contain information on the major databases used for
transactions concerning personal/business records.  There are several
other services also accessed (such as Easylink), but I will not include
it, as it has hardly an impact on the professional side of the gateway.


THE WRITER:
~~~~~~~~~~~

I thought I would include a little about myself, as I plan on writing
several more articles in the future dealing with investigations, and
skip-tracing.  I am currently a student of a Private Investigation
coarse.  Currently I have done work for a few private citizens.  The
jobs consisted of financial and personal outlines of the subjects.  I
have also done third-party skip-tracing for the FHA/HUD (Federal Housing
Administration/Housing & Urban Developement).  I am in a position to
sell this network if I choose to, although I hate sales so I have
declined thus far.  There are several other networks/gateways that I
have come across in my marketing research.  I am planning on releasing
further documentation on them all.  Well, enough about my self, on with
the documentation.

DLD: Drivers License Records via ENTERING ONLY -  Name and Date Of Birth
DRI: Drivers License Histories
LIC: License Plate Searches
VIN: Vehicle Identification Number Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NOTE: The NCI Network has 2 different and unique ways by which you can
      search for Drivers License Numbers and/or Drivers License Records.
      The Menu CMD Code for these searches is  DLD 
      This unique service allows you to enter merely the
      NAME, DATE OF BIRTH, and STATE TO SEARCH and the search will
      be able to produce either the DL# only or the complete driving
      record history.
      The above  DLD  method of searching is more expensive
      than obtaining a driving record when you have much more
      identification information to provide such as the DL#,
      and address  etc. but if you are short on information,
      TRY IT, YOU'LL LIKE IT!

purposes INCLUDE A $3.50 employment compliance surcharge,

Note:  At least the last name is required for this type of search but
the full name is best.  The format of the name line is first name, or

WOR: Workers Compensation Prior Claims
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NCI provides access to worker's Compensation claims histories, providing
any claims made against employer's Worker's Compensation funds by the
subject.

Information provided to NCI clients on Worker's Complensation claims
history will require a release from the subject you are requestion
information on.  Each report request cannot be sent back without a
release signed by the subject.  If you already have release forms signed
by your employees or prospective employees and wish to use your own
release form you may send it in for approval.

Example Report:

Joe Consumer suffered injury to the right hand 11/12/85.  Employer was
R&L Packaging.  Number of days missed 12.  Amount of claim $530.00

ZIP: Zip+4 - Nine Digit Zip reference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This option will provide address standardization and output of hte
4-digit add-on code with the current, correct 5-digit zip code.  This
option may be selected as the only option desired or in a combination
with other options.  If an address is not found on the Name/Address file
and the ZIP+4 option is selected, the system will return a stardardized
address with ZIP+4 code in place of the record that may have been
displayed in the REQUESTED DATA section.

The more specific the information supplied, the more accurate the
returned ZIP+4 code will be.  This means you should include the
apartment number or suite number if available.

Addresses returned without an add-on code designates "NO DELIVERY".

A message of "MULTIPLE RESPONSES" indicates that the search information
provided requires some additional information to distinguish between the
possible responses.  The address in the search information may need a
direction suffix (e.g. ST, AVE, RD) or a zipcode.  If you add this
informatio nand re-submit the requestion there will be another billable
request.


CONCLUSION:
~~~~~~~~~~~

Well, that will conclude my textfile on NCI/W.D.I.A Network.  Hopefully
it has been interesting, and if nothing else informative as to what type
of information sources are currently available to people in the position
to use them.  This network is probably the best I know of for
skip-tracing.  There is another network called CDB INFOTEK which is very
similar to this network except it also contains public information.  I
am planning on releasing documetation on that network as well in the
near future.

If you have any questions or comments for me, you can leave me mail at
kludge@hale.uucp or to kludge@isis.cs.du.edu (it would be most likely be
read faster from hale.uucp).  I would also like anyone who has knowledge
about similar networks to leave me mail, stating the name of the
service, what it provides, and a place the business can be contacted at
if at all possible.

computer-to-computer, or by PASSPORT(tm) PC Software program.

     Based on social security number input, you will recieve a list of
up to six possible names and addresses.  If additional files exist, a
message will appear on the TRACE report with instrunctions to contact
your local bureau for a complete listing.

     Trace users who are subscribers to Trans Union's HAWK will also
have their reports automatically checked against the nation's largest
database of consumer credit fraud information.  HAWK Alert messages will
apprear whenever a listed social security number has been used
previously in fraudulent activities.  By matching an individual's social
security number against the Social Security Admininstration's Death
Master File, HAWK will also identify individuals who are using the
social security number of a deceased person.

                              ----------
                              TRACE-Plus
                              ----------

     Now, stores, banks, utilities, oil companies, government agencies
and other  subscribers that have a legally permissable purpose for
obtaining credit information, can review a new, value-added TRACE report
that does more than provide name and address information.

     TRACE-Plus includes all the basic data contained in the original
TRACE report PLUS age, salary and employment informaiton.

     The addition of this input adds a new dimension to TRACE.
Subscribers can now determine the age of the person the're checking or
seeking. (Age often corresponds with a person's mobility.)  They'll also
learn if the individual is currently employeed and, if so, where.  If
the information is available, subscribers will also find out about the
individual's financial wherewithal, based on their position and salary.

     All this translates into a more comprehensive search system,
improved collections, better quality loans, more qualified response to
direct marketing promotions, and fewer "adress unknown" returns.

     You can use TRACE-Plus with confidence, assured that Trans Alert
will automatically scrutinize every input of social security numbers.
You'll also have the option of utilizing HAWK to spotlight previous
fraudulent activity and invalid social securty numbers of deceased
people.

     TRACE-Plus is available on-line or in batch following the same
simple procedure as TRACE.  The special subscriber code used to sign
into the system will identify you as a TRACE or TRACE-Plus user and
provide you with the appropriate informaiton.

                                  --------
                                  Re-Trace
                                  --------


     Social security numbers are a vital element in the credit and
search process.  But often this critical information is not available.

     RE-TRACE is a special search system that matches names and
addresses against Trans Union's national database of social security
numbers.  For example, if you're a company with 100,000 files that have
no social security numbers, you can now match your customers names
against the database, and append it with social security numbers.

     In view of the government's recent clause reguarding "Due
Dilligence," RE_TRACE is especially relevant.  It enables insurance
companies, banks, and other financial institutions to demonstrate that
they have excercised ever possible means, including the search of
traceable social security numbers, to help locate missing heirs, policy
holders, lock box holders, etc.

     RE-TRACE performs this quickly and easily.  Just provide us with
names and addresses and we'll give you the corresponding social security
numbers.  It's as simple as that.

ATLAS Report Two- Address Verification and Neighbors
 EG: 2i SMITH, JOHN* 1574,,MAPLE,,SOUTH HOLLAND, IL,60743*
     This report searches by the address, and provides the occupants at
     that address.  It will stop searching once the address match has
     been found, and will never attempt chance of address searches, even
     if the data base indicates the subject has moved.  If ATLAS locates
     the street but cannot find the actual house number, in most cases
     the infomration on the neightbers will still be returned.

ATLAS Report Three- Subject Verification
 EG: 3i SMITH, JOHN* 1574,,MAPLE,,SOUTH HOLLAND, IL,60743*
     This provides the most current address and phone number for an
     individual.  The primary objective of this report is to verify the
     address or phone for an individual

ATLAS Report Four- Phone Verification
     Provides the name and address listed for an input telephone number.


IMPORTANT POINTS TO REMEMBER

1.  ATLAS does not contain post office boxes.  Input of a post office
    box alone will result in a no hit.  ATLAS contains rural routes.  If
    an address has a rural route and a post office box, do not enter the
    post office box.

2.  Directions (N, S, E & W) and street types (ST, DR, ETC.) are
    critical to the match process and most be entered whever possible.

3.  Numbered streets must be entered with the appropriate two character
    suffix (ST, ND, RD & TH) Examples: 1st, 2nd, 103rd, 198th.

4.  All requests should be individual, joint inquiries are not valid.

5.  If ATLAS returns ",,G" as the name and "(000)000-0000" as the phone
    number, you found a ghost- a valid residential address for which the
    occupant is unknown.


     Ok, that is the basics of what their system has to offer.  Now I
guess we shall venture to the meat of this phile.  Once again in this
report, we have obtained reports from the company with full information
as to the lines of the report and have enclosed all information that had
been disclosed to us.  This information is on the credit form 2000 which
is the standard for Trans Union.

    Well, that ought to about do it for this file.  I hope you have found
the information contained useful if you currently are using Trans Union, or
not, then I hope that it has given you some insight as to what their reports
are, what they have to offer, and how the records are kept.

    I still have not written on NCI yet.  It should come out in later files.
After I have done research on the other databases and investigative nets
I plan on releasing one on NCI.  I have the complete book for it, and just
as some preamble to my NCI file, Trans Union is just 1 of the databases that
NCI is connected to.  TRW Commercial & Individual Credit, Equifax/CBI, and
several others I plan to release documentation on.

Some of the following Information was taken from The Teleputing Hotline
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

WILL U.S. BELLS BECOME INFORMATION MONOPOLIES? 

Judge Harold Greene lifted the regional Bell companies from their ban on 
providing information services. The Bell companies loved it, the competition 
hated it. Greene was forced to move by higher courts, who upheld a higher, 
unmeetable standard on the ban. 

There will be appeals, and Congress could overturn the order in a new law. 
But the Bush Administration wants the Bells to be let into the field, and 
will veto the bill. FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes hopes the Bells will get 
into the cable TV business and forestall re-regulation there. 

=============================================================================

NY TELEPHONE proposed a restructuring plan to head-off New York 
moves to force its divestment from parent NYNEX. 
=============================================================================

NEW PRODUCT HELPS DETECT TOLL-FRAUD 

Account-A-Call launched the Toll Fraud Monitoring Service, which 
can monitor lines going out of a large business PBX to detect 
calling patterns that suggest hacking or potential toll fraud. 
Account-A-Call requires a piece of hardware which links to the 
PBX and its phone lines and is programmed. Then the line is 
monitored by AAC staff, who sound alerts at anything suspicious. 
It all costs about $250 per month, writes Linda Rohrbough of 
Newsbytes. 
=============================================================================

A SMART SOVIET DEBIT CARD 

Comparator Systems of the U.S. signed a deal with the Central 
Bank of the Russian Federation and the Russian Export Co. to 
install over 2,000 debit card terminal systems across Russia. The 
machines will employ Smart Cards, using chips which log all 
transactions and other data -- Western systems use magnetic-strip 
cards which can store only account numbers. Smart cards will 
reduce the need for telecommunications and enhance security with 
fingerprints stored on the chips, writes Kirill Tchashchin of 
Newsbytes. 
=============================================================================

U.S. HOUSE COMMITTEE PASSES PHONE PRIVACY MEASURES 

A U.S. House Committee approved measures to provide protection 
from junk phone calls and restrict Caller ID services. The 
proposals, from Rep. Edward Markey of Massachusetts, chair of the 
telecomm subcommittee, require per-call blocking of Caller ID 
numbers, and create a national databank listing people who don't 
want to hear from phone salesmen. The latter bill, similar to a 
Florida law, would also require that calls placed by computers 
hang-up on consumer demand. A pending Senate bill would ban all 
commercial solicitations to non-business phones. 
=============================================================================

TELESPHERE MAY BE UNDER IN SEPTEMBER

The #4 U.S. company offering caller-paid 900 number lines may be 
about to go under. Telesphere will lose $9.9 million for the quarter 
ending in June, mainly because 900 revenues declined. It's is 
trying to get customers to finance it, offering to give them 
stock instead of cash for funds it owes.  

Telesphere owes the money to 900-number service providers like 
Softguard Systems. Softguard now says it faces "an imminent 
financial crisis" because Telesphere, which provides it with 
billing and collection services, "has failed to remit amounts now 
past due and has indicated that payment is unlikely to be 
forthcoming in the foreseeable future." Softguard says unless it 
gets financing to tide it over it will go under. 
=============================================================================

SPRINT cut its prices 15% under the U.S. government phone 
contract, but still lost the Navy to AT&T, which had complained 
a 60-40 revenue split in its favor had not been carried out. 
=============================================================================

AT&T A BIG WINNER FROM GULF WAR 

AT&T is a big winner in the Gulf War. It's shipped 2 digital 
switches for international and domestic calls, and won $11 
milllion in PBX business. AT&T also rebuilt Kuwaiti Air Force 
communications. Now it's signed with Alghanim Industries to 
distribute at least $3 million in corded and cordless phones, 
digital PBXs, business telecomm systems and answering machines. 
European companies dominated the market before the Gulf War.  
=============================================================================

FCC CAN'T HANDLE PHONE COMPLAINTS 

Allnet, a small U.S. long distance company, says the Federal 
Communications Commission is so far behind in handling complaints 
against local telephone companies that cases begun now will 
still be pending in 1995. Lack of staff was blamed for the 
delays, which looked at FCC data on 1,419 complaints filed 
between 1984 and 1991. The complaints, mainly against local Bell 
companies, include high rates and other anti-competitive 
activities. They're supposed to be settled within 15 months under 
U.S. law. Allnet also said the FCC is biased in favor of AT&T on 
settlements. AT&T says it's just willing to settle. 
=============================================================================

MINITEL SERVICES ANNOUNCES PC CONNECT 

Minitel Services announced PC Connect, a networking service which 
will compete most closely with NVN. NVN is a U.S. service on AT&T 
Accunet's system which covers NAPLPS, Minitel, and ASCII text. PC 
Connect offers connections to 23 countries, credit-card billing 
in local currency, and connections via Infonet. The new venture 
will support ASCII text and the Teletel protocol, which is 
popular in Europe but has had a great deal of difficulty finding 
a foothold in the U.S. market. Separately, the company will link 
to the US West Community Link gateway due to open in Minneapolis 
this fall. 
=============================================================================

INFONET EXTENDS NETWORK TO BRAZIL 

With Brazil prepared to finally scrap an informatics `domestic 
content' law, enacted in 1987, the rush is on to get back into 
the market. Infonet, owned by MCI along with European and Asian 
phone authorities, will extend its packet network to the country 
through a facility in San Paulo run by the EMBRATEL long-
distance monopoly. That center will link to Brazil's RENPAC 
public data network, giving people in 50 cities local access to 
Infonet services. 
=============================================================================

THE MOST POWERFUL COMPUTERS IN THE WORLD 

Arguments continue over what is the world's most powerful 
computer. We think it's the one put to the most powerful purpose. 
While celebrating the failure of the Soviet coup, Americans 
should consider which computers hold the most power over them. 

Those are the mainframes owned by credit agencies. Two firms lead 
the market -- Equifax and TRW. They prepare credit reports, which 
are used by banks in determining whether you'll get a car, a 
home, a job, or a credit card. The two have taken separate tacks 
toward the same goal. TRW is claiming in state courts it has 
every right to sell mailing lists based on data collected for 
credit purposes. Equifax is trying glasnost, getting out of the 
mailing list business, opening a customer service center, and 
waging a PR campaign which claims the industry can police itself. 

Equifax has already taken some steps which should be mandated for 
its competitors. Citizens must have free access to their credit 
reports, including toll-free calls to ask for copies, and they 
should have the right to question anything in them. There should 
be independent adjudication of disputes between grantors and 
grantees of credit. As it is now a credit grantor's word is 
law. And the credit agencies must be prohibited from re-selling 
information to anyone for purposes other than checking credit. 
=============================================================================

MCI announces MCI MAIL TRADING PARTNER PROGRAM--It is a way for e-mail 
subscribers to create a network among their business associates.
=============================================================================

There have been, and are, such things as "responsible" 900 numbers--at places 
such as The National Space Institute, educational tv, and colleges and 
universities.
=============================================================================

MCI has 14 percent of L-D market share according to USA TODAY chart; AT&T 70,

AT&T:
     --ends the no-fee feature on its Universal Card; starting today, new card 
applicants will be charged a $20 annual fee.

     --introduces AT&T Customnet, a small business service for customers who 
spend $50-$200 monthly on L-D and want to combine their service costs on one 
bill for discounts.

     --Maryland computer hacker pleads guilty in AT&T case.

     --fresh technological advances are leading to new Caller ID controversies;
it's possible now to identify callers by name, display unlisted numbers.
=============================================================================

     --900 numbers offer "hot lists" of business and employment opportunities 
at exorbitant charges
     --actually, Kuwait is so devastated that it will take some time before 
meaningful opportunities develop.
=============================================================================

   Here is a list of all the networks that make up the Internet and their
Internet addresses. This list can be thought of as a kind of  DNIC list for 
the Internet, of course it is not, in fact it has nothing to do with DNIC, 
that is just  to give you an idea of what this list is.
   This list of networks on the Internet was found by Haywire, but the list 
was in such poor shape I though I would "fix" it up and ended up editing the
whole thing by hand. I hope it helps you out as much as it has helped me on 
the Internet.

It has just come to our attention, that Damaged Sectorz was never busted, it
was a rumor fabricated by him. He is currently running around using the
handle Mind Rape. He has started a group called NSA (National Security 
Anarchists). Oh- Why do you say that the basis of creation is plagerism??
Pretty stupid slogan for your group.

Three LOD members have started a Computer Security Company called COMSEC 
running out of Huston TX. These three are: Erik Bloodaxe, Malefactor, and 
Doc Holiday. Contrary to the rumors COMSEC is not out to bust hackers. I 
quote Erik Bloodaxe as saying: 'COMSEC is not out to get hackers, hell the 
only hackers that we would ever turn in are those dicks from MOD'. 
    -To each his own!
