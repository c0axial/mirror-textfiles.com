During the past few months NASTY has taken a small vaction. During that time
MOD has bragged about 'crushing NASTY with my thumb'. Well it just got to
unbearable. It's time for us to show the little shits for what they really
are.

Oh by the way MOD:

An individual wishing to remain anonymous wishes to say 
'Corrupt, the angry man wishes to say MOD fucks dogs.'

Well, let me start of by recapping the situation. MOD claims to be so dam
untouchable. They also claim WINGNET and their UNIX are so dam secure.
hehe what a joke. During the time NASTY has been 'crushed', we have been
monitoring WINGNET! All of the mail, files, password files, messages, 
and lovers quarrels have been intercepted. YES we OWN MOD! This file
is only the first of several! By the way, the angry man says that the
telenet database is pretty impresive even for a bunch of losers! EVERYTHING,
I mean EVERYTHING is going to be made public. Including but not limited to
MOD's 'PRIVATE' database! During the course of several weeks we at NASTY
will be studying MOD in depth! Now the public can know everything that MOD
knows. (Isn't that great? woopy!)

boo.  what's new?  Got root on that 3020... with a little bit of werk.  They
are now the proud owners of a new login too, it's a Sun 4.1.1 a root shell is
in /usr/tmp file: .Ex0371 weird kind of system, that thing has one hell of a
fast connection!!!  I can't even tell, no lag at all!  anyway, new telnet for
them very soon, I was too tired to get telnet done last night.  I'm getting
the password file for att.att.com within a week also.  Welp, gotta get ready
for work (friday, yea!)  so I'll catch you later!

osi now has a new version of telnet /usr/lib/adb/.^A is the mystical place.
there is: log.handler there too.  ugh, oh, the bkdr p/w for any account:
igg13 don't use root with it though unless it's an emergency.  It also
knocks you out of utmp so use guest, igg13     anyway.  gotta go to a b-day

David Barts (davidb@polari.uucp) and Joe Stein (jose@techbook.com)
have recently talked about GTE switches, especially in GTENW.  Since I
work for GTE I guess I'll see if I can actually shed some light on the
actual situation here vis-a-vis switches types, etc.  I do not work
directly for GTE Telops -- GTE Telecom is an unregulated subsidiary of
GTE and so we have to pay for our phone service just the same as
everyone else.  However, many employees here used to work for Telops,
specifically in GTENW, so I can get some inside information.  I myself
have never worked for *any* regulated phone company, so I can only
pass along information from others here.

The information I have is just GTE *before* the Contel merger.  I
don't have information about Contel switches, etc.  Overall, 50.9% of
GTE switches are SPC (stored program control) and 49.1% are still
mechanical.  In GTENW for area code 206, there are only three
mechanical offices left: Stevens Pass, Mount Vernon and Stanwood.  I
don't have the breakdown for any of the other area codes (503, 509, etc.)

Here is a percentage breakdown of all of the SPC switches in GTE.  The
areas are the pre-Contel areas.  With the Contel merger, the area
names and boundaries change, but since I don't have information about
Contel switches, this is the best I can do.  South West is the
Texas/Oklahoma/NewMexico area, North is the midwest states, South is
the Florida area and West is the west coast states.  The column
percentages may not total 100% due to rounding error.  Also the
notation .% means less than .5% (I round .5% up to 1%.)  The last line
is the percentage of SPC switches in each area, the remainder being
various mechanical switches (cross-bar, step-by-step).

              South                         Overall
Switch         West   North   South    West   Total

GTD-5           62%     71%     58%     62%     64%
#2 EAX           5%     11%     11%      8%      9%
DMS-10           6%      8%     14%      5%      8%
DCO             24%      2%      6%      0%      6%
DMS-100/200      2%      3%      9%      6%      5%
Vidar            0%      3%      0%      6%      2%
#5ESS            1%      0%      2%      4%      2%
GTD-3            0%      2%      0%      2%      1%
#1AESS           0%      0%      0%      3%      1%
#4ESS            0%      0%      1%      2%      1%
GTD-4600         1%      0%      0%      1%      .%
EWSD             0%      0%      1%      0%      .%
ITT-1210         0%      0%      0%      .%      .%

Total SPC       44%     39%     66%     76%     51%

You can see that GTE West has the largest percentage of SPC switches.
At one point (maybe ten years ago, or so the story goes), someone at
GTE estimated that it would take 50-100 *years* to convert all of the
cross-bar and steppers to electronic switches.  Five years later, the
estimate was down to ten years (mainly due to the economics of lower
head counts)!

In GTENW for area code 206, there are six #5ESS COs, in addition to
the tandem #5ESS in Everett (Everett (Casino), Bothell and Redmond COs
are #5ESS in the Puget Sound area).  Almost all of the rest of the
switches (especially in the 206 area) are GTD-5's (sixteen total).
There is one Vidar, four EAX2's (early SPC switch), three CXP5's (#5
cross-bar) and four SXS (step-by-step!).  According to my list, GTENW
(Washington, Oregon, Idaho) has 73% of the #5ESS in all of GTE!

Steve Forrette <forrette@cory.berkeley.edu> asked about 206-338 in
Mill Creek, which is served by the GTD-5 at the Everett (Alpine) CO.
I just moved from Seattle/US West service area (#5ESS) into northern
King County/GTENW service (Richmond Beach CO, GTD-5), and the
difference is quite noticable.  One thing I fail to understand is why
GTE has to play around with the various Call Waiting, Three-way
calling, etc.  features.  Here I am, used to using *70 to disable call
waiting on the old #5ESS, and now I have to retrain myself to use 70#
instead!  They also use timeouts to detect feature dialing on rotary
phones instead of ``11'' (on 5ESS you can dial 1170 instead of *70.)
Here is one vote for standardizing feature access codes!  Sigh...


Joe
