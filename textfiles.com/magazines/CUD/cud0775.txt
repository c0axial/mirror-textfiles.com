...that the EFF-housed CuD archive has been jazzed up a bit for WWW users.
It now features a nice index page.
URL: http://www.eff.org/pub/Publications/CuD/

This index should propagate to all the mirrors as well, so all of them
should be browsable in style.

Only the top level is currently so indexed.  Will work on the

SUMMARY OF INTERNET CENSORSHIP LEGISLATION

The four different pieces of legislation that address Internet regulation
are still waiting for conference committee consideration.  With the budget
as the current Congressional priority, it isn't likely the fate of the
Internet will be considered for several weeks.

VTW is still collecting the signatures of businesses and bulletin boards
that wish to participate in the joint letter to be sent to Congress urging
parental control (instead of censorship) as a means of approaching the
Internet.  VTW urges you to contact your Internet service provider along
with any business that use the Internet to signon to this letter.  Details
can be found at the http://www.vtw.org/cdaletter/
or by sending mail to vtw@vtw.org with "send cdaletter" in the subject line.

 _________________________________________________________
CHANGES IN US CRYPTOGRAPHY POLICY

VTW has been chronicaling the government's attempts at forcing Clipper II
onto the public and industry.  Of course, it is still extremely unpopular.
At the Sep. 6th and 7th NIST workshop, industry and public interest
groups panned the plan and small working groups setup by NIST to evaluate
the criteria unhappily participated, even openly revolting in some instances.

On Sep 15th, NIST held another workshop to discuss the FIPS (Federal
Information Processing Standard) that would embody Clipper II (also
know as Commercial Key Escrow).  Believe it or not, this meeting was not
a repeat of the Sep 6th/7th meeting.  Several attendees noticed significant
differences:

HEIGHTENED GOVERNMENT PRESENCE
At the Sep 6th/7th workshop, dissent among industry and public
representatives interfered with NIST's attempts at having a discussion
about the specifics of Clipper II.  Simply put, industry and the public
advocates didn't like the plan.  Therefore discussions of the details
were fruitless.  One smaller working group simply refused to work on
the details and issued a statement condemning the whole Clipper II plan.

The government upped the number of Federal participants at the Sep. 15th
meeting in order to prevent the repeat of such an event.  Several public
advocates noticed a high percentage of government-provided participants in
the working groups.  One civil liberties advocate noted that he had never
seen so many NSA individuals identifying themselves in public before.

Needless to say the tactic worked.  Little in the way of opposition to
the plan was voiced.

BURNOUT AMONG INDUSTRY AND PUBLIC REPRESENTATIVES
Having been through this Kafka-esque exercise a mere two years ago with
the original Clipper plan, industry and public advocates are showing
signs of burnout.  It's fairly clear that their concerns are not being
listened to.  Both the public and the industry clearly sent a message to
the Clinton Administration when the original Clipper was proposed.
Said F. Lynn McNulty of NIST in the New York Times Magazine (6/12/94), "We
received 320 comments, only 2 of which were supportive."

NIST made the Clipper Chip a government standard anyway, and it flopped
in the marketplace.  How many of those Clipper-phones do you see running
around?  The government's so-called "stupid criminals" are just falling
over themselves to buy them, aren't they?  NIST has stated that it has
already been decided to make Clipper II a standard, before receiving any
public input.  Is this how democracy is supposed to work?

COMMERCIAL CHEERLEADING FROM SELECT INDUSTRY INDIVIDUALS
If you're wondering how the Clinton administration can get away with
pushing such a disastrous proposal again, look no further than select
members of the hardware and software industry.  Several companies that
make both security software, hardware devices and several key escrow
companies are pushing Clipper II because they incorrectly believe that
the government will not make it mandatory, and because they believe
the industry wants key escrow.

VTW believes they have it half-right: industry wants key escrow, though
not on the Clinton Administration's terms.  It is clear, however, that
the Administration will not allow key-escrow to be a voluntary program.

The EPIC (Electronic Privacy Information Center) has proved that the
government has enough common sense to know that key escrow is going to be
unpopular and will have to be forced on the marketplace. (See FOIA'd
documents at URL:http://www.epic.org/crypto/).

Never the less, several companies who want to produce hardware key
escrowed devices, key escrowed software, and become escrow holders have
become the champions of the Clipper II (Commercial Key Escrow)
program.  With their support, VTW predicts that the Clinton
Administration will ratify Clipper II as a FIPS standard over the
objections of industry and public.

Stay tuned to BillWatch for progress on Clipper II.

Anti-Electronic Racketeering Act of 1995 (HR n.a., S 974)

Description:
	S 974 has many effects (not good) on law enforcement's use of
	intercepted communications.  It would also make it unlawful for
	any person to publicly disseminate encoding or encrypting
	software including software *currently allowed* to be exported
	unless it contained a "universal decoding device".  This
	more than likely means that Clipper-style key escrow systems
	could be disseminated, but not strong, private cryptography.

Senate sponsors: Grassley (R-IA)

Senate status: Currently not active and probably won't move before the
	August recess.

Senate citizen action required:
	Request bill below and familiarize yourself with it.  VTW is
	tracking this bill, and will alert you when there is movement.
	There is no Congressional action to take right now; as other

          To amend certain provisions of law relating to child pornography,
          and for other purposes.
                           IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
                    September 13 (legislative day, September 5), 1995
          Mr. Hatch (for himself, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Grassley, and Mr.
              Thurmond) introduced the following bill; which was read twice
              and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary
                                         A BILL
          To amend certain provisions of law relating to child pornography,
          and for other purposes.
            Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
          United States of America in Congress assembled,
          SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
            This Act may be cited as the `Child Pornography Prevention Act of
          1995'.
          SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
            Congress finds that--
                (1) the use of children in the production of sexually
              explicit material, including photographs, films, videos,
              computer images, and other visual depictions, is a form of
              sexual abuse which can result in physical or psychological
              harm, or both, to the children involved;
                (2) child pornography permanently records the victim's abuse,
              and its continued existence causes the child victims of sexual
              abuse continuing harm by haunting those children in future years;
                (3) child pornography is often used as part of a method of
              seducing other children into sexual activity; a child who is
              reluctant to engage in sexual activity with an adult, or to
              pose for sexually explicit photographs, can sometimes be
              convinced by viewing depictions of other children `having fun'
              participating in such activity;
                (4) prohibiting the possession and viewing of child
              pornography encourages the possessors of such material to
              destroy them, thereby helping to protect the victims of child
              pornography and to eliminate the market for the sexually
              exploitative use of children; and
                (5) the elimination of child pornography and the protection
              of children from sexual exploitation provide a compelling
              governmental interest for prohibiting the production,
              distribution, possession, or viewing of child pornography.
          SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
            Section 2256 of title 18, United States Code, is amended--
                (1) in paragraph (2)(E), by inserting before the semicolon
              the following: `, or the buttocks of any minor, or the breast
              of any female minor';
                (2) in paragraph (5), by inserting before the semicolon the
              following: `, and data stored on computer disk or by electronic
              means which is capable of conversion into a visual image';
                (3) in paragraph (6), by striking `and';
                (4) in paragraph (7), by striking the period and inserting `;
              and'; and
                (5) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:
                `(8) `child pornography' means any visual depiction,
              including any photograph, film, video, picture, drawing, or
              computer or computer-generated image or picture, whether made
              or produced by electronic, mechanical, or other means, of
              sexually explicit conduct, where--
                    `(A) the production of such visual depiction involves the
                  use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct;
                    `(B) such visual depiction is, or appears to be, of a
                  minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct; or
                    `(C) such visual depiction is advertised, promoted,
                  presented, described, or distributed in such a manner that
                  conveys the impression that the material is or contains a
                  visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit
                  conduct.'.
          SEC. 4. PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES RELATING TO MATERIAL CONSTITUTING OR
                            CONTAINING CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.

   STATEMENTS OF INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS (Senate -
   September 13, 1995)



  THE CHILD PORNOGRAPHY PREVENTION ACT OF 1995



   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is impossible for any decent American not
   to be outraged by child pornography and the sexual exploitation of
   children. Such material is a plague upon our people and the moral
   fabric of this great Nation.

   And, as a great Nation, I believe that we have both the constitutional
   right and moral obligation to protect our children from those who,
   motivated by profit or perversion or both, would abuse, exploit, and
   degrade the weakest and most vulnerable members of our society.

   Current Federal law dealing with child pornography reflects the
   overwhelming bipartisan consensus which has always existed, both in
   Congress and in the country, that there is no place for such filth
   even in a free society and that those who produce or peddle this
   reprehensible material must be made to feel the full weight of the law
   and suffer a punishment reflective of the seriousness of their
   offense.

   As with many of our criminal statutes, however, effective enforcement
   of our laws against child pornography today faces a new obstacle: The
   criminal use, or misuse, of new technology which is outside the scope
   of existing statutes. In order to close this computer-generated
   loophole and to give our law enforcement authorities the tools they
   need to stem the increasing flow of high-tech child pornography, I am
   today introducing the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1995.

   The necessity for prompt legislative action amending our existing
   Federal child pornography statutes to cover the use of computer
   technology in the production of such material was vividly illustrated
   by a recent story in the Washington Times. This story, dated July 23,
   1995, reported the conviction in Canada of a child pornographer who
   copied innocuous pictures of children from books and catalogs onto a
   computer, altered the images to remove the childrens' clothing, and
   then arranged the children into sexual positions. According to
   Canadian police, these sexual scenes involved not only adults and
   children, but also animals.

   Even more shocking than the occurrence of this type of repulsive
   conduct is the fact that, under current Federal law, those pictures,
   depicting naked children involved in sex with other children, adults,
   and even animals, would not be prosecutable as child pornography. That
   is because current Federal child pornography and sexual exploitation
   of children laws, United States Code title 18, sections 2251, 2251A,
   and 2252, cover only visual depictions of children engaging in
   sexually explicit conduct whose production involved the use of a minor
   engaging in such conduct; materials such as photographs, films, and
   videotapes.

   Today, however, visual depictions of children engaging in any
   imaginable forms of sexual conduct can be produced entirely by
   computer, without using children, thereby placing such depictions
   outside the scope of Federal law. Computers can also be used to alter
   sexually explicit photographs, films, and videos in such a way as to
   make it virtually impossible for prosecutors to identify individuals,
   or to prove that the offending material was produced using children.

   The problem is simple: While Federal law has failed to keep pace with
   technology, the purveyors of child pornography have been right on line
   with it. This bill will help to correct that problem.

   The Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1995, which includes a
   statement of congressional findings as to harm, both to children and
   adults, resulting from child pornography, has three major provisions.
   First, it would amend United States Code title 18, section 2256, to
   establish, for the first time, a specific, comprehensive, Federal
   statutory definition of child pornography. Under this bill, any visual
   depiction, such as a photograph, film, videotape or computer image,
   which is produced by any means, including electronically by computer,
   of sexually explicit conduct will be classified as child pornography
   if: (a) its production involved the use of a minor engaging in
   sexually explicit conduct; or (b) it depicts, or appears to depict, a
   minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct; or (c) it is promoted or
   advertised as depicting a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.

  PROCEEDINGS



   THE COURT: I have some remarks to make, some of which may be
   considered preliminary. But I think that they are important for a full
   understanding of what this kind of procedure is.

   A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy providing the
   potential for considerable harm, yet because of its emergency nature,
   it does not afford the Court the usual degree of careful consideration
   and examination of all relevant and material evidence which is
   afforded by the deliberative process of a so-called full-fledged
   trial. It is by its very nature an emergency matter, and as a
   consequence, the issuance of an injunction is tentative, and it's
   subject to later modification or for that matter even a complete
   rescission or vacation following trial on the merits. That is why in
   our legal tradition the question of whether to issue an injunction,
   what terms such an injunction should contain are to be approached with
   the utmost caution and prudence.

   The power to issue an injunction, like the power to hold a person in
   contempt of court is a power which is best used sparingly, if at all.
   Moreover, the very purpose of an injunction is to preserve the status
   quo ante. That is a rather elegant piece of Latin which means the last
   existing state of peaceable, non-contested conditions which preceded
   the pending controversy. I will not dwell on this, but I do think it's
   helpful to observe that our legal forefathers were not fools, and the
   complete phrase from the Latin is the status quo ante bellum which
   literally means the state of things before the war began.

   Given this purpose and the caution that the law prescribes, there are
   four basic considerations or findings which must be made before an
   injunction can issue. These same four factors likewise assist in
   determining the scope of an injunction and the conditions which would
   attach to it. Applying these conditions and factors to this case and
   reserving, as I had previously indicated, the right, if not indeed the
   obligation, to issue a more detailed document of a finding, finding of
   fact and conclusion of law, in other words, a more formal opinion at a
   later time, I am going to make the following ruling on the case from
   the bench. And if there is any ambiguity, the parties can obtain a
   copy of these comments from the court reporter.

   The first consideration is probability of success on the merits. I
   find the plaintiff has not established a probability of success on the
   merits, either in relation to the copyright or the trade secret cause
   of action.

   With regard to the copyright infringement, on the evidence before me,
   I find there is no probability of plaintiffs succeeding on their
   copyright claim because the evidence which has been presented shows
   that the defendants' use of the copyrighted works constitutes a fair
   use under Section 107 of the Copyright Act in that it is for the
   purposes of criticism, comment, or research, and as such is not an
   infringement.

   With regard to the trade secrets violation claim, the plaintiff has
   not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the materials in
   issue are secret or within the definition of trade secrets under
   Colorado law. The evidence shows the materials are in fact in the
   public domain, and I am not persuaded by the evidence presented here
   that they entered the public domain only through unlawful means.

   The second consideration or factors is irreparable injury, and I find
   that the plaintiffs has not shown it will suffer irreparable injury of
   the use by defendants for the materials in issue. The evidence does
   not show that plaintiff will lose competitive advantage through
   defendants' use of the materials, nor that the defendants are using
   the materials for commercial purpose. In balancing the hardships to
   the plaintiff, I find the threatened injury of the plaintiff does not
   outweigh the damage the proposed injunction would cause the
   defendants. Whereas, the evidence has not shown the plaintiffs will
   suffer harm if the injunction is not issued. It shows the affect of
   issuing the injunction would amount to an infringement on defendants'
   right of fair use of copyright materials, and even more so in this
   case to barely prevent the functioning of the defendant F.A.C.T.NET in
   its entirety.

   With respect to the final consideration of public interest, the public
   interest is served best by the free exchange of speech and ideas on
   matters of public interest. This is indeed a matter of public interest
   and to issue the injunction sought would not serve that interest.

   Having weighed all of the factors, as I am required to do, I conclude
   the plaintiff has not shown a likelihood of success on the merits and
   the balance of harm lies in favor of the defendants. For these
   reasons, Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction is denied.

   I order, however, as follows: That the plaintiffs shall return and
   restore to the defendants immediately at the plaintiff's expense all
   seized materials, including defendants' hard drive in the exact
   conditions that they were taken and from the precise places from which
   they were taken. I also order the defendants in this case that they
   must maintain -- and each defendant must maintain the status quo as to
   the possession of all of the copyrighted materials at issue in this
   case and the defendants, and each of then, are restricted to making
   fair use and only fair use thereof. The defendants here are
   specifically prohibited from making any additional copies of the
   materials or transferring them in any manner or publishing them other
   than in the context of fair use. Those are the orders of the Court.

   I thank counsel for the presentation, and the Court will be in recess
   until 9:00 a.m.

   MR. COOLEY: Your Honor, we'll undoubtedly be appealing this to the
   United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, and we would
   respectfully ask a stay of the Court's order of return pending that
   appeal.

   THE COURT: No, I will not order a stay of the return of the materials.
   That would, in my view, cause the exact harm, which I am mot concerned
   with, and that is the inability of the defendants in the case to
   maintain their continued existence during this litigation.

   (Recess.)
