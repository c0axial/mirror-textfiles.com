[1] Groups Write Senate on Pending Net Censorship Bills

EPIC joined with a dozen other free speech and civil liberties
groups on July 14 in a letter sent to the U.S. Senate concerning
two pending Internet censorship bills, saying they violate the
First Amendment.  The groups contend that the bills -- one
requiring Internet content filters and the other setting criminal
penalties for providing "inappropriate" online material to minors)
-- would severely restrict free expression on the Internet.

The Senate may soon vote on both bills.  Sen. John McCain's
"Internet School Filtering Act" (S. 1619) would require schools
and libraries receiving federal Internet subsidies to install
filtering software designed to prevent children from accessing
"inappropriate" material. Sen.  Dan Coats' bill (S. 1482) would
criminalize the "commercial" distribution on websites of material
that is "harmful to minors."  The Coats bill, in adopting a
criminalization approach to online content, is similar to the
Communications Decency Act (CDA) struck down last year by the
Supreme Court.  The bill, which has been dubbed "CDA II," could
come to the Senate floor as early as this week.

"One year ago, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the
Communications Decency Act of 1996, which made it a crime to
transmit 'indecent' materials on the Internet, violated the First
Amendment," the coalition letter states. "The two pending bills
ignore the central holding of the Court; expression on the
Internet is entitled to the highest degree of First Amendment
protection.

"We share the concern of Sens. McCain and Coats that the Internet
remain a safe and rewarding medium for young people," the letter
continues.  "However, we strongly believe that these bills embrace
approaches --filtering and criminalization -- that are both
constitutionally suspect and ultimately ineffective in providing
our children with positive online experiences."

EPIC is supporting an online campaign to raise Congressional
awareness of the implications of these Internet censorship bills.
Faxes can be sent --free of charge -- to your Senators by visiting
the EPIC Free Speech Action page:

     http://www.epic.org/free_speech/action/

If you sent faxes to the Senate earlier, you helped keep these
bills off the floor.  Please reiterate your concerns once again
and let your Senators know that these measures remain
controversial.

   INTERNET FREE EXPRESSION ALLIANCE

   INTERNET FREE EXPRESSION ALLIANCE


  JOINT LETTER TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE



     July 14, 1998

     Re: S. 1619 and S. 1482

     Dear Senator:

     We are writing on behalf of the undersigned organizations to express
     our concerns about two bills that would restrict free expression on
     the Internet -- S. 1619 and S. 1482. We understand that both of
     these bills may soon be considered by the Senate.

     One year ago, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the
     Communications Decency Act of 1996, which made it a crime to
     transmit "indecent" materials on the Internet, violated the First
     Amendment. The two pending bills ignore the central holding of the
     Court; expression on the Internet is entitled to the highest degree
     of First Amendment protection. The Internet School Filtering Act (S.
     1619), sponsored by Senator McCain, would require that all public
     libraries and schools that receive federal funds for Internet access
     install blocking software to restrict minors' access to
     "inappropriate" material. S. 1482, sponsored by Senator Coats, would
     punish commercial online distributors of material deemed "harmful to
     minors" with up to six months in jail and a $50,000 fine.

     We share the concern of Sens. McCain and Coats that the Internet
     remain a safe and rewarding medium for young people. However, we
     strongly believe that these bills embrace approaches -- filtering
     and criminalization -- that are both constitutionally suspect and
     ultimately ineffective in providing our children with positive
     online experiences. As such, we urge you to consider a better
     approach to this issue, one that would encourage the development of
     "Internet drivers' education" programs of the kind being
     successfully employed in communities throughout the nation. These
     programs may effectively supplement policies that limit Internet use
     to educational and curricular purposes. Individual school districts
     that find them useful currently are free to adopt such educational
     use policies, even without specific legislation.

     We urge you to consider this alternative approach because we believe
     that parents and teachers -- not the federal government -- should
     provide our children with guidance about accessing information on
     the Internet. Clumsy and ineffective blocking programs are "quick
     fix" solutions to parental concerns that provide a false sense of
     security that minors will be protected from all material that
     parents may find inappropriate. At the same time, filtering software
     restricts access to valuable, constitutionally protected online
     speech about topics ranging from safe sex, AIDS, gay and lesbian
     issues, news articles, and women's rights. Religious groups such as
     the Society of Friends and the Glide United Methodist Church have
     been blocked by these imperfect censorship tools, as have policy
     groups like the American Family Association. This type of arbitrary
     censorship is a blatant violation of the First Amendment.

     S. 1482 should be rejected because it contains many of the
     unconstitutional provisions of the Communications Decency Act that
     were unanimously overturned by the Supreme Court in Reno v. ACLU.
     Like the CDA, S. 1482 would have the effect of criminalizing
     protected speech among adults. Whatever governmental interest may
     exist to protect children from harmful materials, that interest does
     not justify the broad suppression of adult speech. While the bill is
     ostensibly aimed at "commercial" web sites, that term is so broad
     that it covers anything from an on-line book seller like Amazon.com
     to a non-profit website that sells books or T-shirts.

     The age verification affirmative defense of S. 1482 -- which
     precisely duplicates the CDA's defense -- ignores the finding in
     Reno v. ACLU that there simply is no way to verify age on the
     Internet. As the Supreme Court noted, the vast majority of websites
     are not financially or technically capable of requiring a credit
     card or other form of identification to verify the age of users. The
     government may not mandate the application of a legal standard to
     the Internet -- whether it be "indecency" or speech that is "harmful
     to minors" -- that requires speakers to distinguish between adults
     and minors when such a distinction cannot be made.

     Finally, S. 1482 will not be effective in keeping from minors
     material that might be inappropriate for them. No criminal provision
     will be more effective than efforts to educate parents and minors
     about Internet safety and how to properly use online resources.
     Moreover, the Internet is a global medium. Despite all the
     enforcement efforts that might be made, a national censorship law
     cannot protect children from online content they will always be able
     to access from foreign sources.

     For the foregoing reasons we urge you to oppose S. 1619 and S. 1482
     and any other efforts to dilute the potential of this powerful
     medium. We hope you will agree with our view that an educational
     approach, as opposed to filtering requirements and new criminal
     laws, is the best way to address the issue of how our children use
     the Internet.

 ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION REACTS TO SENATE PASSAGE OF TWO INTERNET
 FILTERING BILLS


 Statement of Barry Steinhardt
 President of the Electronic Frontier Foundation

 This afternoon the Senate passed two draconian bills that would
 ultimately prevent access to a wide array of content on the
 Internet.

 I don't mean to rain on EFF's parade, but they have mistakenly
 reported that CDA II passed the Senate when, in fact, it has not.
 Senator Coats' CDA II and Sen. McCain's School/Library filtering
 act were both attached to an appropriations bill, but that bill
 has not yet passed the Senate.  Moreover, pro-free speech forces
 should be aware that there are a number of additional steps in
 the legislative process before final passage and Presidential
 signature of these bill. So, there's still time to express your
 opinion to your elected representatives.  They bill could pass
 today, tomorrow, or never, but it's still important to

 EFF is not alone in its confusion about this legislative process.
 Several press outlets also reported that the bills passed.  The
 source of confusion appears to be a press release put out by the
 bill's sponsor (Senator Coats) declaring victory in the Senate a
 bit early.

Subject: File 3--Followup to Rutstein review

Boy, did *this* ever open a can of worms!  I cannot recall any
review that has generated this much response, this fast.

Sorry to those who did not get a personal response, and thanks to
the majority of you for your kind words about the reviews, but
there were just too many of you, mostly asking the same question.
Almost all of you wanted to know of an NT security book that I
could recommend.

Well, I am sorry to disappoint you, but *I'd* like to know of an
NT security book that I could recommend.  I haven't found one yet.
(For those incipient authors who are experts in the field, and
have about a year to give to the task, there is an apparent market
niche.)

The reason for this lack may lie in a number of areas.  As one
correspondent implied, many think that "NT security" is an
oxymoron.  I note that while there are a variety of NT security
resources out there, and there have been a few attempts to start
one, there is no really good NT security FAQ available yet.  There
are a number of sites with exploit information, and there is one
vendor that tries to sell you an NT security file, but the closest
I've seen to a good FAQ was a recent "top ten" list of things to
do to make NT marginally more secure than it is when it ships.

I suspect that part of the problem lies in the design of NT
itself, which does not make security provisions straightforward to
implement, but it may also be simply bad luck in the selection of
authors who have attempted to address the issue so far.  Of the
number of NT security books I've reviewed to date, I still haven't
found a definitely good one, let alone anything to the standard of
Spafford and Garfinkel.

Just to reiterate, here are the titles I've reviewed so far:

<p><a href="bkpwntsg.rvw">   "PCWeek Microsoft Windows NT
         Security"</a>, Nevin Lambert/Manish Patel, 1997,
         1-56276-457-8, U$39.99/C$56.95/UK#36.99 - good introductory
         or non-specialist guide, but there are holes

<p><a href="bkwntscg.rvw">   "Windows NT Security Guide"</a>, Stephen
         A. Sutton, 1997, 0-201-41969-6, U$29.95/C$41.00 - too vague
         for users, lacking detail for administrators

<p><a href="bkwntsec.rvw">   "Windows NT Security"</a>, Charles B.
         Rutstein, 1997, 0-07-057833-8, U$34.95 - reasonable range,
         but has gaps and lacks analysis

Normally, if I were recommending texts on security in the UNIX
field, I would also include works on system administration.
However, in the NT arena, while some admin authors have tried to
cover the topic it is just too big to handle as a subsection of a
larger work.

I have to differ.  I've found the reviews you've done of both Rutstein and
Sutton's books to be hypercritical.  Both of those books are resources that
I find valuable.  I personally recommend both of them, as well as Mark
Edward's book.  If I were to give someone an NT security reading list, I'd
start with those three, add the NT Resource Kit, and the help system to
ISS' Internet Scanner for Windows NT.

As someone who lives and breathes NT security (and has for about 4 years),
and who has been approached to write a book on the topic, I'd like to think
I'm familiar with this area and would be a decent judge of the existing
material.  I'd also note that Jim Kelly (architect of NT's security
subsystem, and author of the security reference monitor) had some very good
words to say about Rutstein's book.  I know Jim and have a lot of respect
for him and his opinion.

>The reason for this lack may lie in a number of areas.  As one correspondent
>implied, many think that "NT security" is an oxymoron.

Nice joke, but any professional in the field understands that perfect
security cannot be obtained.  We've got a difficult job to do trying to
secure networks, and there are significant challenges securing _any_
operating system.

>I note that while there
>are a variety of NT security resources out there, and there have been a few

yet.

You may be missing Robert Malgrem's FAQ.  Sutton's NSA paper isn't a FAQ,
but is the clearest, most comprehensive and up-to-date information
available on what to secure and how to secure it.  I can find very, very
few things I feel he's left out and little I can argue with.

>There are a number of sites with exploit information, and there is one vendor
>that tries to sell you an NT security file, but the closest I've seen to a

Then you should read Sutton's paper.  It could be that you're not aware of
all the resources.

>Of the number of NT security books I've reviewed to date, I still
>haven't found a definitely good one, let alone anything to the standard of

Let's not lose sight of another fact - Spafford and Garfinkel was first
published in 1991.  That is nearly 25 years after UNIX was invented.  I
would certainly hope that we will accumulate a well-defined body of
knowledge on NT security in the next 20 years.  A comparison of a book
based on 3-4 years of experience to a book based on over 25 years (current
edition) is going to be flawed - you're talking apples and oranges.

           Browser-Enemies Microsoft and Netscape Are
          Kindred Spirits Regarding Employee Diversity
                       by David Batterson


There are gay-friendly computer companies, and those that only
pretend to be. Let's separate the wheat from the chaff.  If a company
isn't gay-friendly with its employees, do you want to buy from them?

A few of the many gay-friendly computer corporations (A-Z) are
Adobe Systems, Aldus, Apple Computer, AOL, Dell, Egghead, IBM,
Gateway, Lucent Technologies, NEC America, Oracle, Qualcomm, Seagate
Technology, Texas Instruments, US Robotics (now part of 3COM), Xerox
and Ziff-Davis.

Two companies are currently fighting a fierce browser-battle
that makes the Bette Davis v. Joan Crawford spats look like ballroom
dancing. While many favor Netscape's browser, that's not the issue
today.

What the focus is: are these companies a great place for those in the
GLBT community to work?  The answer in both case is: definitely.
Both offer domestic partnership benefits, natch, and much more.

Microsoft has a huge commitment to diversity, and also devotes a
large Web section to it:  www.microsoft.com/diversity/default.htm.

Microsoft currently offers two interactive diversity training
programs.  The "Diversity Awareness" program is an introduction to
diversity.  The program "focuses on reducing the image and influence
of stereotypes, identify elements that make each participant a
diverse person, and share communication strategies that help
participants in a diverse environment."

The company also has a variety of internal initiatives, including
an intranet site (internal to Microsoft employees only) called
"DiversityNet" where employees can find information vital to the
company's diversity efforts.

If you have any questions/comments about diversity at Microsoft or
their Diversity Web site, e-mail them at: diverse@microsoft.com.
GLBT job candidates are encouraged to submit resumes directly to:
Jobseek@microsoft.com.

While Netscape's diversity section in their corporate Web site is
not as elaborate as Microsoft's, it shows their true colors.  Surf to:
home.netscape.com/comprod/about_netscape/hr/diversity/index.html.
Or just go to their main Web site, and search under "Jobs."

Netscape's diversity statement says: "Netscape is committed to
hiring the brightest and the best, and we execute this philosophy
without regard to race, color, creed, religion, national origin,
sexual orientation (perceived or otherwise), age, sex, or
disability."

It goes on: "Diversity in our work environment is not simply
something Netscape values, we strive for it. Project DIVA (Diversity
Involves Valuing All) is a four-step process conceived to actively
pursue the goal of cultural diversity within the company."

Netscape also has a program that works with university programs and
community organizations to increase the diversity of their applicant
pool.  E-mail them for more info: diversity@netscape.com.

So there you have it.  In the diversity competition between
Microsoft and Netscape, you'd have to call it a draw (and that's good
for us).  If you work for either company (or know those who do), your
feedback is welcomed.

Subject: File 6--cDc releases BACK ORIFICE for MS Windows


    RUNNING A MICROSOFT OPERATING SYSTEM ON A NETWORK? OUR CONDOLENCES.

[July 21, San Francisco] The CULT OF THE DEAD COW (cDc) will release Back
Orifice, a remote MS Windows Administration tool at Defcon VI in Las Vegas
(www.defcon.org) on August 1. Programmed by Sir Dystic [cDc], Back Orifice
is a self-contained, self-installing utility which allows the user to
control and monitor computers running the Windows operating system over a
network.

Sir Dystic sounded like an overworked sysadmin when he said, "The two main
legitimate purposes for BO are, remote tech support aid and employee
monitoring and administering [of a Windows network]."

Back Orifice is going to be made available to anyone who takes the time to
download it. So what does that mean for anyone who's bought into
Microsoft's Swiss cheese approach to security? Plenty according to
Mike Bloom, Chief Technical Officer for Gomi Media in Toronto.

"The current path of learning I see around me is to learn what you have to
to cover your ass, go home and watch Jerry. Microsoft has capitalized on
this at the cost of production value which translates down to security. A
move like releasing [Back Orifice] means that the lowest common
denominator of user will have to come to understand the threat, and that
it is not from [Sir Dystic] writing an app that [potentially] turns Win32
security on its ear, but that Microsoft has leveraged itself into a
position where anyone who wants to can download an app [or write their
own!] and learn a few tricks and make serious shit happen."

None of this is lost on Microsoft. But then again, they don't care.
Security is way down on their list of priorities according to security
expert Russ Cooper of NT BUGTRAQ (www.ntbugtraq.com). "Microsoft doesn't
care about security because I don't believe they think it affects their
profit. And honestly, it probably doesn't." Nice. But regardless of which
side of the firewall you sit on, you can't afford not to have a copy of
Back Orifice. Here are the specs:


Back Orifice (BO) allows the user to remotely control almost all parts of
the operating system, including:

     File system
     Registry
     System
     Passwords
     Network
     Processes

* BO contains extensive multimedia control, allowing images to be captured
from the server machine's screen, or from any video input device attached
to the machine.

* BO has an integrated HTTP server, allowing uploads and downloads of
files to and from a machine on any port using any http client.

* BO has an integrated packet sniffer, allowing easy monitoring of network
traffic.

* BO has an integrated keyboard monitor, allowing the easy logging of
keystrokes to a log file.

* BO allows connection redirection, allowing connections to be bounced off
a machine to any other machine on the Internet.

* BO allows application redirection, allowing text based applications
running on the server machine to be controlled via a simple telnet
session.  Even open a remote shell.

* BO has a simple plugin interface, allowing additional modules to be
written by third parties, and executed in Back Orifice's hidden system
process.

* BO is EASY TO INSTALL!  Simply run the server, and it installs itself,
and removes the executable it was originally run from, or it can be
attached to any other Windows executable, which will run normally after
installing the Back Orifice server.

* BO is TRANSPARENT!  Back Orifice does not show up in the task list, or
even the Close Programs dialog, it is automatically restarted each time
the computer boots, and does not affect the operation of any other
applications.

* BO is CONFIGURABLE!  The filename that Back Orifice installs itself as,
the port Back Orifice communicates on, and the encryption key are all
configurable before the server is installed.

* BO is ENCRYPTED!  Communication packets used by Back Orifice are
encrypted with a user definable key, so only the intended client can
control the server.

* BO is FREE!  All the functionality mentioned above AND MORE is available
in the 120k server, along with an easy to use text based or GUI client,
Back Orifice comes with everything you need to distribute and control any
number of machines.

* BO is GROWING!  New features, increased efficiency, new plugins, and
more support are being added to Back Orifice every day.


After August 3, Back Orifice will be available from www.cultdeadcow.com
free of charge.
