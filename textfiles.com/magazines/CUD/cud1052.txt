Internet Pioneer Postel Dies

.c The Associated Press

 By TED BRIDIS

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jon Postel, the Internet pioneer who wielded
enormous influence managing technical details of the global
computer network, has died of complications from heart surgery in
Los Angeles, friends in Washington said Saturday. He was 55.

Postel, considered by the Clinton administration to be a crucial
player in the future of the Internet, died Friday night while
recovering from surgery to replace a leaking heart valve, said
Vint Cerf, a senior vice president for MCI Worldcom Inc. who
worked closely with Postel.

The death also was announced Saturday at an Internet conference in
Barcelona, said Bill Semich, the president of .nu domain, another
Internet company.

Postel's death comes at a critical juncture for the Internet, with
the federal government in the midst of largely turning over
management of the worldwide network to a non-profit group that
Postel helped organize.

Though Postel worked behind the scenes and was hardly known
outside high-tech circles, his role as director of the Internet
Assigned Numbers Authority allowed the Internet to match unique
numerical addresses for computers on the global network with its
millions of Web addresses, such as www.ap.org.

So powerful was Postel that ``The Economist'' once dubbed him
``god'' of the Internet.

Islands in the Clickstream:
Who Cares?


"Because they have so little," observed Eleanor Roosevelt, "children rely
on imagination rather than experience."

Which is why childhood is such a magical time, during which - even among
the worst deprivations - children can weave a luminous web around their
daily lives, filling the landscape with lively fantastic shapes.

Just like adults.

This week an extraordinary event gave the digital world its seal of
approval. Lively fantastic shapes humped and bumped their way across our
monitors, a magic lantern show for the wickedly leering.

Those of us who remember Watergate recall a judicial process that proceeded
at a deliberate pace. Congressional hearings spelled out how the President
of the United States had undermined the law by directing criminal
activities from the Oval Office. The intelligence community was widely used
to destroy enemies, distort the truth, subvert the constitution.

A generation later, the independent prosecutor's report of the Clinton
affair is shot-gunned onto the Net so debate can slosh back and forth
across the body politic and members of congress, fingers to the wind, can
sail toward impeachment, or not.

We all frame the world according to our experience. As the Viet Nam War and
Watergate unfolded, it became clear that our leaders, Democrats and
Republicans alike, were lying through their teeth. Our denial eroded, and
the voice of the people grew until it was amplified by those hearings,
saving the constitution for another generation.

Where is that "voice of the people" now, crying out for the deeper truth?
Is it locked in the closet with our comic books, faded tales of Superman,
an idealized father who couldn't protect us? Whose heroic belief in "truth
and justice" made us feel better when we were children afraid of the night,
as Auden said, lost in a haunted wood?

The digital world, with its altered or manufactured images, is a haunted
wood, a prison of the imagination. But when we use digital images to tell
as much truth as can be told, the prison walls become transparent and we
see real trees in the digital forest.

We need to see more than the rubble and dust of falling-down public lives.
There is so much more going on out there than presidential peccadilloes. We
need a transcendent vision that begins with the simple truth but moves
toward larger possibilities.

A former computer hacker who occupies a sensitive position in corporate
America and works frequently with the intelligence establishment described
a chilling moment. He found himself involved with something so much bigger,
deeper, more evil than he had imagined that he felt that chill running down
his spine that tells us our world view has shifted forever. My friend had
stumbled into the heart of darkness.

Once we know, we can't not know what we know.

Hackers are often portrayed as criminals, but - like many hackers - my
friend was really an innocent. The hacker ethic of integrity, a passion for
truth and knowledge, an obsessive desire to put together the Big Picture -
that's closer to the superhero credo of "truth, justice, and the American
way" than a criminal code.

The History Channel just ran a series on the Kennedy assassination. The
series raised legitimate questions - again - about a conspiracy.  All we
can know now about the assassination is filtered through text, the
television screen, the digital interface  and sometimes, the words of a
friend. A prominent local physician remembers when his mentor at Medical
School was called away to examine Kennedy's body. When he returned, he
tried to work as if nothing had changed, but he kept looking away and
muttering to himself, "It's the damndest thing."

Then he said:  "One day - one day it'll all come out."

Just another "conspiracy theory."  Like Gary Webb's.

This month's Esquire has a story about Webb. He wrote articles for the San
Jose Mercury News about the connections between cocaine distribution, the
CIA, and the Contras. His story was well-documented but it didn't take long
for the guardians of consensus reality to whack him. The truth is, he
described the tip of the iceberg, but that's all he had to do to find
himself surrounded, isolated, neutralized. The deep involvement of members
of our government in narcotic trafficking is well documented, but when Webb
tried to tell the truth, it was as if he had screamed himself awake from a
nightmare and rushed to the window, only to find it nailed shut and people
on the walk below who would not look up.

Besides  guns, Contras, cocaine   who really cares?

I have explored the fun-house mirrors of the world of UFOs for years. When
you brush away the cobwebs of disinformation, snake oil,  mistakes, and
reports of remarkable flying machines that we make ourselves, we are left
with credible people telling us what they saw. Fighter pilots, intelligence
agents, commercial airline pilots have told me what they or their friends
encountered, that the hardware is real and flew rings around them, leaving
them in the dust.

We're a small planet on the edge of a vast spiral of stars, the center of
nothing but our own perspective. All we have is our small voice. Digital
media can amplify that voice or drown it out.

"The movie "Conspiracy Theory," said my hacker friend, "doesn't even come
close."

As Jane Wagner said, I get more and more cynical all the time and still
can't keep up. Yet we humans are meant for a deeper truth, more truth than
a thousand pages of a president lying to keep a sexual affair secret.
Perspective, as Alan Kay said, is worth fifty points of IQ. Sex on the Net
is a sideshow, keeping our eyes on the dancing bears.

So step right up! The circus is just beginning! Elephants are on parade,
clowns pour out of a tiny auto, a calliope pipes and - in the distance - we
think we can hear a voice, a contrarian voice, a still small voice  but
it's only our imaginations. Isn't it?

Anyway   who cares?

FIRST SALARY SURVEY RESULTS

  The average annual salary for the 7209 valid respondents was
  US$61,072/year.  All numbers below are annual salaries converted to
  US Dollars.

  How do the salaries break down?  What about the gender gap?

    Salary range       M+F     %     Males/%   Females/%
   Under 20,000        105   1.5%     103/ 1.6%     2/ 0.3%
   20,000-29,999       245   3.4%     220/ 3.4%    25/ 3.4%
   30,000-39,999       659   9.2%     574/ 8.9%    85/11.5%
   40,000-49,999      1226  17.1%    1078/16.8%   148/20.1%
   50,000-59,999      1415  19.7%    1258/19.5%   157/21.3%
   60,000-69,999      1338  18.7%    1204/18.7%   134/18.2%
   70,000-79,999       880  12.3%     799/12.4%    81/11.0%
   80,000-89,999       532   7.4%     472/ 7.3%    60/ 8.2%
   90,000-99,999       272   3.8%     250/ 3.9%    22/ 3.0%
   100,000 & up        499   7.0%     477/ 7.4%    22/ 3.0%

  Other than at the highest salaries (for which the female sample size is
  a bit small for great conclusions), there does not appear to be a major
  gender gap in salary.

  What about salaries for the different kinds of administrators?

                             --- Administrator Type ---
     Sal Range        System     Network       Security
   Under 20,000      63  1.7%    31  1.4%    11  1.0%
   20,000-29,999    136  3.6%    78  3.5%    30  2.7%
   30,000-39,999    322  8.4%   270 12.0%    64  5.8%
   40,000-49,999    692 18.1%   431 19.2%   109  9.8%
   50,000-59,999    773 20.3%   455 20.3%   188 17.0%
   60,000-69,999    729 19.1%   391 17.4%   217 19.6%
   70,000-79,999    454 11.9%   241 10.7%   190 17.2%
   80,000-89,999    273  7.2%   135  6.0%   119 10.7%
   90,000-99,999    135  3.5%    80  3.6%    55  5.0%
   100,000 & up     240  6.3%   131  5.8%   124 11.2%
   Average            60394       58455       68261

  Security administrators seem to make significantly more money than
  their counterparts in System and Network administration.

  How did salaries increase from year to year?  Is there a gender gap?

     Sal Range            Male           Memale
   Under 20,000      18.32% [  92]   26.65% [   2]
   20,000-29,999     10.16% [ 187]   14.32% [  23]
   30,000-39,999     10.46% [ 513]    7.65% [  66]
   40,000-49,999     11.12% [ 974]    8.08% [ 137]
   50,000-59,999     11.57% [1182]    9.73% [ 149]
   60,000-69,999     11.72% [1155]   10.34% [ 123]
   70,000-79,999     11.95% [ 762]   10.60% [  79]
   90,000-99,999     12.79% [ 241]    9.48% [  21]
   80,000-89,999     13.55% [ 453]   11.61% [  60]
   100,000 & up      16.86% [ 437]   24.83% [  20]

		5996 Male respondents
	 	 680 Female respondents

  Except on the very highest and lowest end, male salaries seem to be
  rising faster than their female counterparts.

  NOTE: People totals on some charts are fewer than 7,209 because some
        people omitted certain pieces of information (e.g., gender).

                             IS YOUR KID A HACKER?

   By Kevin Poulsen

If you suspect your kid is a computer hacker, here's some advice
from a convicted hacker on how to handle it

It starts with a knock on the door. A dozen men in suits and
shoulder holsters are outside, their Buicks and Broncos crammed
into your driveway and parked along the street. Over their
shoulders you can see your bathrobe-clad neighbors watching the
spectacle from their lawns.  It might be the FBI, it may be the
Secret Service, but whoever it is, the humorless agents hand
you a piece of paper and head toward your son or daughter's
room. You wonder, perhaps for the first time, what your kid has
been doing in there with the computer.

If you're a parent, you probably regard the Internet as a font
of both promise and peril for your children. It can be an
invaluable learning tool and a way to encourage your kids to
develop the basic computer skills they'll eventually need. But
what if they take to it a little too eagerly and
enthusiastically and begin using it to get into places where
they don't belong? In that case, normal youthful rebellion, or
simple inquisitiveness, if it's expressed over the Internet,
could turn your family upside down.

It happened last February in Cloverdale, California, when
surprised parents found out their teenage son was suspected in
a series of Pentagon intrusions. It happened again in
Massachusetts a week later, when the Justice Department won its
first juvenile conviction under the Federal Computer Fraud and
Abuse Act.

It happened to my family 15 years ago, in one of the first
hacker raids in the country. At that time, I was the teenage
miscreant who was illegally accessing federal computers. Now,
in my early thirties, I've begun to wonder how I would protect
a kid of my own from becoming a poster child for computer
crime. I believe the best approach is to stay informed and to
communicate with your potential cyberpunks.

We've posted a program on Peacefire.org that will display the

Cyber Patrol has just found out about it, and they are not
pleased.  They have about 9 million users and the dam is about to
burst.

We also have instructions for disabling all the other blocking
programs --CYBERsitter, SurfWatch, BESS, I-Gear, etc.  We're

Wal-Mart Sues Amazon.com

.c The Associated Press

 By RACHEL BECK

NEW YORK (AP) -- In a battle of booksellers, Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
has sued Amazon.com and claimed the Internet company that wants to
be the discount superstore of cyberspace is stealing trade
secrets.

In a lawsuit filed in Chancery Court in Benton County, Ark.,
Wal-Mart asked for an injunction against Amazon.com to prevent the
Seattle-based company from allegedly trying to duplicate
proprietary technology.

The order also would apply to Amazon.com affiliates Kleiner
Perkins Caufield & Byers and Drugstore.com.

The Bentonville, Ark.-based company claims Amazon.com recruited
its former associates and targeted its vendors to learn more about
Wal-Mart's information database, which analysts say is second in
size only to the U.S. government. It includes data on sales,
inventory and consumer buying habits.
