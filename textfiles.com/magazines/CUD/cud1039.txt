House Commerce Committee Overwhelmingly
Appproves WIPO Bill by vote of 41- 0

Washington (July 17)--The full House Commerce Committee today
overwhelmingly approved a bipartisan measure that would implement
the World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty and
the Performances and Phonograms Treaty. H.R. 2281, the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, was reported out of the committee
as amended, by a vote of 41 to 0.

Commerce Committee Chairman Tom Bliley (R-VA)made the following
opening remarks at this mornings WIPO markup:

"Today, the Committee completes its consideration of H.R. 2281, the
World Intellectual Property Organization Treaties Implementation
Act.

"This is perhaps the most important piece of legislation relating to
electronic commerce that this Congress will consider.

"And lets be clear: while it is true that this legislation
implements copyright treaties, it is done in such a way that it
defines the way in which consumers will participate in the future of
electronic commerce.

"When we began our review, I stated that the Committee on Commerce
would add value to this important piece of legislation -- and in
doing so, ensure that the WIPO treaties are implemented in this
Congress.

"Im pleased to say that we have done just that.

"On a number of important issues, the Committee has worked closely
with the interested parties, and crafted balanced and reasonable
solutions that substantially improve this bill.

"We have reached a resolution, for example, on the issue of
encryption research, thanks in large part to the leadership of
Chairman Tauzin.

"We also have a compromise on the issue of privacy, and I want to
thank Mr. Markey for all his hard work in getting this important
issue resolved. This solution protects the interests of consumers
without stifling the growth electronic commerce.

"Finally, we have reached an agreement on the very important issue
of "fair use." I want to thank Mr. Klug for all his hard work.

"Above all other issues, it is this issue of "fair use" that
concerned me the most. I have faith that the digital revolution
holds enormous promise for consumers and the economy.

"It is changing, and will continue to change, the way in which we
learn . . . work . . . invest . . . and even heal ourselves. And
that change, I believe, will be for the greater good.

"But I also recognize that, in many ways, the digital environment is
the great unknown. It is the newest of new paradigms.

"Digital technology has the potential -- and let me emphasize the
word potential -- to lock up information and works that are
otherwise widely available to consumers today.

"The fact that this problem is only speculative or hypothetical
does not convince me that we should do nothing. Quite the opposite,
it raises the possibility that it will inhibit growth in electronic
commerce.

"The agreement we have today gives consumers a reliable and regular
process that ensures they will have fair use access to information
and copyrighted works  without stifling growth in electronic
commerce.

"I appreciate all of the parties participation in these
negotiations, and look forward to moving forward on this important
piece of legislation."

The following amendments were voted on at todays full committee
markup:
* Amendment offered by Mr. Tauzin (R-LA)  encryption research,
agreed to by voice vote;
* Amendment offered by Mr. Markey (D-MA)  protection of personally
identifying information, agreed to by voice vote;
* Amendment offered by Mr. Dingell (D-MI)  reverse engineering,
agreed to by voice vote;
* Amendment offered by Mr. Klug (R-WI)  fair use, agreed to by
voice vote;
* Amendment offered by Mr. White (R-WA)  protecting the 1st
amendment to the Constitution, agreed to by voice vote; and
* Amendment offered by Mr. White (R-WA)  evaluation of impact of
copyright law and amendments on electronic commerce and
technological development, agreed to by voice vote.

              *** How Technology Dumbs Down Language

From Steve Talbott <stevet@oreilly.com>

You've doubtless noticed that web search engines now offer
on-the-spot machine translation of foreign-language web pages.
I'll spare you the usual examples of comical translation.  What
worries me is not how bad they are, but how we will go about
making them better.

It's actually quite easy:  all we need to do is to continue using
ever less evocative, less richly textured, less meaningful
language.  The more we can resort to a flat, abstract, technical,
and contentless vocabulary, the more satisfactory the machine
translation will be.  If we could finally learn to speak and write
in something like a programming language, we'd be blessed with
near-perfect translations.  Don't look for a *Moby Dick* or
*Leaves of Grass* to be written in this language, however.

But there's a second, complementary way for the translations to
become more acceptable:  the reader can lower his standards of
acceptance.  Commentator David Jolly tells us that, while computer
translations were once the butt of jokes, they are now taken quite
seriously.  He goes on:

   But the real story is the Internet, because web-surfers aren't
   worried about a publication-quality document; they just want to
   be able to browse foreign websites.  (CBS MarketWatch, May 13,
   1998)

Of course, when we're "just browsing" we're not particularly
concerned about such things as depth of understanding, subtle
distinctions, fidelity to the source, and the intimate and
sympathetic penetration of another mind.  These objectives, along
with many others, fade into the background.

They may *need* to fade into the background on occasion.  The
concern on the Net today is whether they are fading beyond
retrieval.

In any case, all this underscores the question that a few people
began asking some years ago.  In the convergence of human being
and machine, which is more fateful -- the machine's becoming more
intelligent and human-like, or the human being's becoming more
machine-like?  All the commentary, all the prognostication, all
the excitement seems focused on the machine's
generation-by-generation ascent -- which already suggests that the
human descent is well advanced.


Searching, Filtering, Blocking
   ----------------------------

The risks of machine translation are presenting themselves on
several fronts.  To begin with, the widespread use of search
engines encourages authors to write for "searchability."  The idea
is to avoid the unexpected (and therefore potentially more
revelatory) word, and instead to appease the audience's
expectations.  They will, after all, search according to their
expectations, and if they don't find you, what good will your
words do?

The same issues arise with filtering and blocking software.  There
is no way -- and in principle never can be a way -- to implement a
dependable filter or blocker so long as our language remains alive
and meaningful.  The blocking software must rely to one degree or
another on past word associations, automatically correlating
certain words with particular subjects and meanings.  The result
is that those whose intentions are not, for example, pornographic,
must avoid the "pornographic lexicon" or else suffer blocking.

But -- as the study of meaning and metaphor has made abundantly
clear --the renewal of language and the extension of human
understanding depend on continual cross-fertilization between
lexicons.  Only in that way can we counter the tendency for our
language to harden into unrelated, narrow, specialized usages that
give us precision while eliminating expressive power.  Such
specialized lexicons are ideal for capturing, in the most prosaic
terms, what we already know -- but disastrous for helping us to
take wing and transcend the previous limits of our understanding.

The concern for internationalization of web pages raises the same
issues yet again.  Colorful, inventive, richly textured language
is not only difficult for foreigners to understand, but may also
lead (we're told) to unintended messages and even insults.  The
standard advice is to avoid colloquialisms, unusual metaphors,
and, in general, any unexpected use of language.

While a genuine thoughtfulness may be at work in this advice, you
will find that I make none of the recommended accommodations in
NETFUTURE.  My refusal is rooted in respect for the reader.  To
hear or read someone from a different culture calls for a heroic
effort of imagination and sensitivity, and we do no favor to
anyone by discounting this effort.  Personally, I would not want
to encounter a foreign author in a watered-down and patronizing
form.  Nor would I want to learn a foreign culture through a
compromised version of its language.  Only the fullest and most
powerful use of language lends itself to the most profound grasp
of the speaker and his culture.

While I am not much of a stylist, I always try to do my best.  I
realize, though, that this stance, taken in the wrong spirit,
quickly becomes arrogant.  Certainly, for example, one-to-one
communication calls for profound mutual accommodation.  The
accommodation -- the willingness to address the concrete
individual in front of you -- is, in fact, nearly the whole point.

But it happens that the mental effort and resourcefulness of
imagination required for this kind of accommodation is exactly
what the machine-reduction of language is now discouraging.  You
cannot accommodate to the world of the other person without first
doing the hard work of *entering* it.  The inability to achieve
this work of imagination is surely implicated in the various
ethnic conflicts currently roiling the globe.

It is one of the characteristic paradoxes of the Net (a paradox
lying, I'm convinced, at the core of the entire technological
enterprise) that the tools designed to bridge the distance between
peoples can operate in a deeper way as tools for destroying even
the bridges we already had.


Unspeaking the Creative Word
   --------------------------

Voice recognition systems offer still another venue for the attack
upon language.  But here it is no longer just the written word --
the word already substantially detached from us -- that is at
issue.  It is more directly we ourselves, in the fullest act of
expression, who must adapt ourselves to the machine's limitations.
We must train ourselves toward flatness, both in sound and
meaning.  But it is almost impossible to achieve a given quality
of voice without first achieving more or less the same quality
within oneself.  Just how far is it healthy to practice inner
qualities of machine-likeness?

From ancient times the spoken voice -- the Word -- has been
experienced as the primary agent of creation.  Still today we may
occasionally hear dim echoes of the Word's power, whether in song,
or in dramatic presentation, or at times when we are spooked, or
in those intense, interpersonal moments when everything hangs on
the overtones of meaning and the soul-gripping tonal qualities in
the voice of the other.

I happen to believe that a lot hinges on our ability to
rediscover, for good or ill, the powers that stream into the world
upon the current of the human voice.  It would, however, be a hard
case to make to a computer-bred generation.  And, with our
adaptation to machine translation, it promises to become harder
still.

Speaking of efforts to reform and simplify language, philologist
Owen Barfield has written,

   Those who mistake efficiency for meaning inevitably end by
   loving compulsion, even if it takes them, like Bernard Shaw,
   the best part of a lifetime to get there .... Of all devices
   for dragooning the human spirit, the least clumsy is to procure
   its abortion in the womb of language; and we should recognize,
   I think, that those -- and their number is increasing -- who
   are driven by an impulse to reduce the specifically human to a
   mechanical or animal regularity, will continue to be
   increasingly irritated by the nature of the mother tongue and
   make it their point of attack.  (Preface to second edition of
   *Poetic Diction*)

Barfield wrote that in 1951.  If he were writing today, I think he
would refer less to specific enemies of the mother tongue and more
to the emergence of a global logic of distributed intelligence and
connectivity.  As we articulate more and more of our activities
into the logical operations of the computerized global system, we
will also -- unless we consciously resist the tendency --
sacrifice more and more of our creative world of meaning, from
which alone the future can arise.

(This is another illustration of my contention -- see NF #59 and
61 --that the new threats of tyranny look less and less like
issuing from central, identifiable authorities, and more and more
like properties of "the system.") NETFUTURE is a newsletter and

Islands in the Clickstream:
                                         Summer Nights


The evocative power of summer nights in northern latitudes is intense.

Different climates, like different constructions of reality, fuse so
completely with how we experience our lives that we are like fish in water.

When I lived in Hawaii, I missed the first chill in the air that came in
mid-summer, an intimation that long daylight might not last forever. An
intimation that the luminous humid darkness of this particular summer night
is an unappreciated gift.

Why are so many feelings interlaced with memories of summer nights? And why
am I sitting at two in the morning in front of a computer when the sky is
clear, Scorpius is rising, and the warm night is an invitation to go
outside and do nothing, absolutely nothing, while the symbols of the
universe written in the sky say more than I want to know of what's passed
and passing and to come?

Memories in their molecular matrix trigger chemicals that make me wistful.
I remember the smell of the summer hair of the first girl I loved. I
remember a night in a back yard behind the home of an uncle and aunt,
surrogate parents that I visited in southern Indiana, their neighbors
visiting and the hollyhocks growing wild and how it felt to dream to sleep
with their warm house around me. And I remember summer in the city, a
promise of excitement that was always kept.

Memories -- I remember Deckard in Blade Runner, murmuring "Memories. You're
talking about memories." Trying to grasp that memories implanted in
replicants cushioned the shock of their brief lives.

These memories of which I am writing are not memories at all. They are
digital images coupling with your own. Those stars in the summer sky are
pixels darkening on your monitor. Or ink squeezed onto a white page by a
printer.  The moment these words are written and sent into cyberspace, they
become part of something else. Part of a different molecular matrix, part
of a larger mind.

Memories -- cushioning the shock of our brief lives.

The digital world that so many of us loved just a few years ago is already
gone. It has become the ubiquitous sub-text of our lives.

These days, we are all in the business of the construction of reality.
Literature - the creation and discovery of meaning and value - used to be a
special case. Then the Romantic poets said that everyone was a poet, that
all reality was "half perceived and half created," and poets simply did it
a little better.

When Vance Packard told a popular audience in the fifties of "hidden
persuaders" in advertisements, it was a revelation. Now we don't have to
board a plane to go to Disneyland, we merely have to get out of bed. We
live inside simulations, in a sanitized landscape, under which imagineers
are pushing buttons, flipping switches, smothering alternative voices. They
can even make things vanish.

"The Disappeared," those thousands of men and women that vanished into
unmarked graves, ceased to exist, their presence no longer magnified by the
minds of those who knew them.  In the digital world too, we cease to exist
when our images are no longer magnified or replicated.

The CIA-drugs-Contra connection, disappeared by a swarm of false assertions
 -- the reality of UFO phenomena, disappeared into the manufacture of crazy
worlds inhabited by "useful idiots" -- the horror of war, disappeared into
"cool" images of smart bombs smoking down chimneys -- digital images
insulating us from our own experience.

Leon Panetta, former Chief of Staff at the White House, said he was once
awakened in the middle of the night by the Secret Service.

"A plane has crashed into the White House!"

Panetta roused himself. "What kind of plane?"

"Well, according to CNN --"

Panetta exploded. "Will you stick your head out of the window and LOOK at
the plane and tell me what you see?"

Somalia was the first invasion covered by cameras and lights already on the
beach to welcome soldiers wading through the surf. But the digital world is
a two-edged sword. The will of the Last Great Superpower was broken by a
thirty-second video-tape of a Marine dragged behind a jeep.

Outside on a summer night, the stars look still and timeless, as if nothing
is exploding. Nothing disappearing.

The other night, several of our many kids came and went. The house was
alive once more with their noisy life. Then they scattered again. We must
have looked to them as they left as I remember that uncle and aunt in
southern Indiana, an image of reassurance that stays there after they're
gone.

Now I am outside, looking up at Cassiopeia. On a good night, the Andromeda
galaxy is a smear of light, but beyond the reach of my telescope, galaxies
explode and civilizations vanish. That house in Indiana has had several
other owners now. The neighbors who came and went have moved away or died,
as all of my family died. The trees they planted have grown tall, but
someone else sits in their shade.

What do we know of our place in the scheme of things, of secrets kept not
only by those who think they have good reasons but by the universe itself?
What has the digital world done but accelerate the construction of
realities, the dark bars of our locked cage?

Memories -- the mystery of a molecular nexus, a biomechanical process
turning into a meaningful image. The digital world is a repository for
memories fading fast, oh fast, in media that flake and peel, software that
can't even turn the corner of a century without a shrill hysterical shriek.

Digital dreams, under the silence of indifferent stars. The sound of
footsteps far away disappearing into an imaginary house. Clocks melt,
trains race out of chimneys. Email is deleted, systems go down. Yet the
will to build and persist persists, life loving life, mystery and passion
of which even digital images dare not dream.
