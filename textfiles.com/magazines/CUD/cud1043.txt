The explosive growth of the Internet, combined with rapid
globalization and the convergence of major telecommunications
services, has strained current methods for administering the Net.
New organizations are coalescing to take on the tasks
of Internet governance, while traditional organizations try to
redefine their relationship to emerging electronic networks.

As this new system is shaped, the public risks losing to corporate
 and government dominance of the discussions. The debate concerning
who administers the Internet and how  that administration is achieved
will have enormous social implications, affecting access to information,
privacy rights, and freedom of speech for the population at large.

CPSR's international symposium, "One Planet, One Net," will bring
together concerned computer professionals, Internet experts, and
corporate, nonprofit, academic and governmental leaders to define the
public interest and set the stage for an advocacy coalition, to make sure
the public voice is heard.



Panels and Interactions
Saturday, October 10,  9:00am-6:00pm

Public Interest in the Age of the Behemoth

The increasing dominance of large corporations over the
infrastructure of the Internet raises serious questions about
whether the broader public's interests will be met in this era of
deregulation and globalism. While the Internet is praised as the
place where the little voice can get a hearing, the Internet may
well change under corporate pressure coming from many directions.

Telephone companies and cable TV companies are starting to offer
Internet service that small providers cannot match. Major
content-providers are changing copyright law in ways that affect
the Internet. Many new technologies are shaped by the advertising
and commerce-oriented interests of corporate sites. Finally,
commercial "portals" pose as value-free conveniences while
actually selecting content.  How do such trends affect the
experience of the average Internet user?.


Panic over Privacy: A Case Study in Regulation

Everyone agrees that something has to be done to ensure the
privacy of Internet users' personal data. What roles do market
forces, laws and regulation, and advances in technology play in
securing our privacy rights?

Governments world-wide are struggling to find solutions that fit
their needs.  Privacy discussions in the United States range from
free-market self-governance to the privacy advocates' demands for
strong privacy legislation.  Two weeks after this symposium, the
European Union nations are required to have laws in place that
prevent the transfer of data to countries without "adequate
privacy protections." What progress is being made in resolving
different views of privacy solutions?


Universal Access: A Global Perspective

The importance of the Internet for personal communication,
information access, and commercial competitiveness means that
those who are connected to the Net will encounter greater
opportunity than the "have-nots." But different communities, some
unable to provide even basic food, water, and health care, must be
viewed differently when we try to meet their information needs.

What services should be universal, and how might tools,
technologies, and processes benefit nations in varying degrees of
development?


Convergence and the Internet's Future: Avoiding the Tragedy of the
Commons

What are the goals of a global information infrastructure?  We
will discuss some of the ways in which the Internet, telephony,
television, and other media are converging, with a view toward
understanding the impact of convergence on regulation,
technological innovations, and user activity.

Panelists will look at implications for grass-roots participation
and democratic influences. How do we create channels for popular
commercial fare and yet leave space for divergent voices? What
scalability issues will arise as the Internet grows several orders
of magnitude?


Action and Coalition
Sunday, October 11,   9:00am-12noon

Our goal is to create a coalition of activists, community members,
political leaders, educators, and socially responsible business
leaders who will work together to draft an action plan
representing the public interest in the development of a new order
of Internet governance. Join us at MIT and help shape the future
of the Internet.


Banquet and Award Ceremony at the Computer Museum
Saturday, October 10, 7:30-11:30pm

CPSR's prestigious Norbert Wiener Award for Social Responsibility
in Computing Technology will be presented to the Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF). CPSR recognizes the IETF for the
exceptionally open and democratic process with which it has
effected the evolution of the Internet.  Join with members of the
Internet Society (ISOC), the IETF, and CPSR.  The festivities
include a keynote talk by the Internet pioneer Einar Stefferud.

Boston's incredible Computer Museum is the venue for this
magnificent evening. We will have exclusive use of the museum.

Subject: File 2--Proposed Rules Issued for National Identity Card (Epic 510)

                            Published by the
              Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC)
                            Washington, D.C.

                          http://www.epic.org


The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) issued a notice on
June 17 that would effectively turn state drivers' licenses into
national identity cards.  The proposed rule would require that all
states modify their drivers' licenses to create a uniform national
drivers' license.  It would prohibit government agencies from
accepting any identification besides the authorized identity card.

The proposed rule would also encourage states to include the
persons' Social Security Number either in written form on the face
of the license or in electronic form of all drivers' licenses.  If
a state does not wish to include the SSN on the license, it must
minimally require every license applicant to provide the number.
State agencies would be required to send every such SSN to the
Social Security Administration for review.

The DOT is basing its rule on provisions in the Illegal
Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996.
Reps. Ron Paul (R-TX) and Bob Barr (R-GA) have introduced H. R.
4217, the Freedom and Privacy Restoration Act of 1998, which would
repeal the immigration act's provisions on identification.  It
would also prohibit federal agencies from  "accept[ing] for any
identification-related purpose an identification document, if any
other Federal agency accepts such document for any such purpose."

More information on the proposed rule is available at:

Are We All Petty Bureaucrats?  -----------------------------

I've been devoting much of my "spare time" during these past
several weeks to bringing up Linux side by side with Windows 95 on
my new PC.  It's a struggle.  Between the Linux installation
itself (my first time), hardware incompatibilities, network
configuration (TCP/IP, PPP, UUCP, dial-in, dial-out, kermit, and
so on), X Window configuration (with an unfamiliar window
manager), disk re-partitioning, and a seemingly endless queue of
inter-linked challenges -- well, for someone who's managed cleanly
to avoid PCs and Microsoft until now, and whose UNIX system
administration skills are more rusty than they ought to be, it's
been an unsettling time.  My sleep has often been disturbed --
especially when I make the mistake of wrestling with a computer
problem late into the evening.

Of course, there are also great satisfactions when some of the
pieces finally come together.  It was at just such a moment that I
got to thinking about what I was doing and how I was feeling.  I
realized that my struggles and victories are those of the
stereotypical petty bureaucrat:  I spend my days getting long rows
of in-boxes properly hooked up to the corresponding out-boxes;
making sure every action is part of a correct, overall procedure;
defining, codifying, logging, and verifying; reducing everything
to precise predictability; and then taking great pleasure when all
the parts move, lockstep, exactly according to plan.

I don't mean to denigrate this pleasure.  It plays a legitimate
part in the human psyche.  We *need* a principle of order to be at
work in all that we do.  The problems arise only when that
principle becomes one-sided, no longer balanced by imaginative
freshness, inner flexibility, and a habit of revisioning our
activities.  The computer, whose own functioning must always be
"strictly according to specifications", is, I would argue, a
powerful influence toward imbalance.  The rigidities we encounter
globally -- for example, in the Year 2000 Problem -- are, in other
forms, a dominant feature of our daily, bureaucratic interaction
with our own computers.  By now we routinely accept them.  We
build our relationships to the world upon these bureaucratically
correct procedures, scarcely aware of the constraints.

But the level of functioning described above is not the only one.
Step down a level, for example, and you will find yourself
laboring in an even more obviously mechanical fashion, keystroke
by determinate keystroke, click by determinate click.  It's a
world of fixed mappings from action to result.  Putting it in
different words:  the voice with which we speak the modern world
into being is increasingly a synthesized voice.  The immediate
physical and gestural elements from which we construct our online
selves are as resistant to the ancient qualitative and expressive
power of the word as the bureaucrat's blank face.

Does it make a difference that you and I must interact with each
other by building upon a foundation of mechanical keystrokes and
bureaucratic procedures?  The easiest way to answer that is to
imagine carrying on your relationship with your spouse or best
friend exclusively by choreographing a set of fixed, predefined
gestures.  Yes, it can be done; in the choreographing, at least,
there is a degree of freedom.  But the more rigidly the materials
with which we must work have been predefined, the more powerfully
creative we must become in imposing our own meanings upon them.

You may be thinking:  "The typewriter, too, required us to
communicate with mechanical keystrokes; did that warp our
personalities?"  The point is an important one, and you might have
added mention of our communication through the printing press, and
even the development of the alphabet and writing.  Each of these
involved a step in the mechanization of human expression and in
the detachment of the word from the living, present speaker.

One consequence of this was that the writer (and I suspect even
more the typist) was freed to project various styles or personas
of his own invention.  Of course, one could also learn to do this
in face-to-face presentation, but when we write there is less work
in "putting on the act" -- we don't need to *live* the new style
with quite the same intensity.  Our entire physical organism does
not become a vibrating, resonant instrument of our expression, as
it does when we speak and gesture.

It is notorious, of course, that the computer carries the
opportunity for creation of artificial selves much further.  And
my point is not to decry this freedom but rather to point out that
it must be *exercised*.  The problem arises when, instead of
grasping our freedom and becoming deeply, fully, with profound
moral commitment, *who we are*, we allow the freedom to become
mere arbitrariness and artificiality.  Behind the various poses,
there remains a blank.  Then the machinery conducing to our
freedom substitutes for our missing selves and enslaves us.

What the bureaucrat too readily forgets -- that the regulations
were made for man and not man for the regulations -- is even
harder to keep in mind when the bureaucratic machine he oversees
is a machine pure and simple.  It's no accident of terminology
that our computers execute "programs" compounded of correct
"procedures" -- or that they are uncompromising in their rejection
of syntax errors.  They challenge us, in effect:  either you
embrace the yet untapped power in your selves to transcend our
syntax, or else you will become a pawn of the syntax.

Unfortunately, we already have a history of passive submission to
the narcosis of television, and throughout our society we continue
to honor and employ the black arts of unconscious manipulation,
otherwise known as marketing.  It is not clear where we will find
the resources to assert ourselves against the forces from beneath
that are training us to become bureaucrats and sleepwalkers.

As for me, I stayed up late last night helping my wife figure out
how to create a complex table in Microsoft Word, which I was using
for the first time.  Then, sleeping only fitfully, I dreamed of
merging and splitting endless rows and columns without, however,
getting any closer to my goal, which had somehow disappeared from
sight.  I hope these are not the dreams our future is made of.

[1] Senate Makes Stealth Assault on Internet Free Speech

Without advance notice or public discussion, the U.S. Senate last week
approved three controversial measures that could adversely impact free
expression on the Internet.  By offering the provisions on the Senate
floor as amendments to the $33 billion appropriations bill for the
Commerce, State and Justice departments (S. 2260), the sponsors avoided
debate and apparently reneged on an agreement to consider alternative
approaches to the complex issue of children's access to "inappropriate"
material.

The Senate's stealth action involved the following measures:

- The so-called "CDA 2" bill sponsored by Sen. Dan Coats (R-IN).  The
bill creates criminal penalties for anyone who "through the World Wide
Web is engaged in the business of the commercial distribution of
material that is harmful to minors" and fails to "restrict access to
such material by persons under 17 years of age."  Opponents of the bill
contend that it, like the unconstitutional Communications Decency Act,
would restrict the ability of adults to receive online information
because speakers on the Internet are unable to determine the age of
potential recipients.

- The "Internet School Filtering Act" sponsored by Sen. John McCain
(R-AZ). The bill requires schools and libraries receiving federal
Internet subsidies to install software "to filter or block matter
deemed to be inappropriate for minors."  Senate opponents of the
filtering bill, led by Sen. Conrad Burns (R-MT) had been assured that
the Senate would consider an alternative measure requiring schools and
libraries to adopt Internet "acceptable use policies."  That agreement
was not honored.

- An amendment offered by Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-CT) requiring
Internet access providers to, "at the time of entering into an
agreement with a customer for the provision of Internet access
services, offer such customer (either for a fee or at no charge)
screening software that is designed to permit the customer to limit
access to material on the Internet that is harmful to minors."

The Internet provisions of the appropriations bill must now be
considered by a House-Senate conference committee that will reconcile
discrepancies between the two chambers' versions of the spending bill.
The Coats and McCain provisions are likely to be challenged in court if
they emerge from the conference committee and are signed into law.

prohibition on Internet gambling) are available at:

%T   "Virtual Private Networks"

Large corporations can afford to set up high bandwidth communications
links between local, national, and even international offices, as well
as hiring the staff necessary to manage major networks.  This keeps
internal information (relatively) secure.  Small to mid-sized
companies can't afford this infrastructure, and so must use the links
of the public networks, such as the Internet.  However, there are ways
of using public networks while still keeping communications private.

Chapter one looks at the needs (both economic and security related)
for a virtual private network (VPN), and the basic technologies used
to provide for those needs.  Some of these technologies are expanded
upon in chapter two.  The discussion of cryptography is fairly minimal
(not really covering, for example, key management issues) but the
descriptions of different types of firewalls is excellent.  The VPN is
compared against Wide Area Network (WAN) and remote access options for
a variety of company sizes and scenarios in chapter three.  Chapter
four outlines a case study for a medium sized business designing a
VPN.

The specifics of VPN technologies start in chapter five with an
examination of the Point to Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP).  Various
details of PPTP are given, but the explanation of connections over the
Internet are not well presented.  Chapter six walks the reader through
PPTP configuration for a Windows NT RAS server as well as NT and
Windows 95 clients, and the Ascend MAX 4004 switch.  The AltaVista
Tunnel is described, with advantages, disadvantages, and an enormous
variety of configuration options, in chapter seven.  Actual
configuration is covered in chapter eight, along with troubleshooting
and management information.  Conceptually the same, operation of the
Cisco PIX Firewall is different because of its hardware basis,
examined in chapter nine.

The maintenance and management of a VPN can have the complexity and
problems of remote access, a WAN, and an ISP (Internet Service
Provider).  Chapter ten is brief, but does point out a number of the
more serious issues to consider.  Appendix A looks at some emerging
technologies that may bear on VPNs.

While the material is not exhaustive, this book does provide a clear
overview of the issues to be dealt with in setting up a virtual
private network.
