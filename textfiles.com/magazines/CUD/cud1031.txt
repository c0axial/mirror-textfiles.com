Islands in the Clickstream:
            a wild-eyed dreamer talks to himself late at night on a dark
side street


A: Exactly. While we know that other cultures see things differently, it's
difficult not to believe that our way of constructing reality is right. And
obviously superior.  The same goes for the little differences between us,
differences amplified in cyberspace (or contact-space) inversely in
proportion to the lack of a conversational context. How can we know what
we're hearing when we don't know who we're talking to?

Q: Say what?

A: Put it this way.  Insufficient bandwidth, an absence of real earth-time
context to provide recognizable cues make it difficult to understand. Add
differences in background and temperament and you have the makings of a
real mess.

Q: What do you mean by temperament?

A: Different ways of perceiving, framing things. Like the Myers-Briggs.

Q: What's that?

A: The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator is based on Jungian personality types.
It's popular because everybody using it feels validated. Each person in a
group can see how everyone else contributes.

Q: Is that important to you, that everyone see that?

A: Yes. The group works better that way.

Q: Like Capricorns learning to live with Leos?

A: Right. The MBTI is like a horoscope for intellectuals. Instead of the
stars, it locates why we do things in our genetic heritage.

Q: What's your temperament?

A:  I'm an ENFP, an extroverted intuitive feeler. I see the future more
clearly than what's right in front of my face. Visions are more real to me
than chemicals in a test tube.

Q: And you think that's better than being, say, someone who makes things
work? Someone who sees why a satellite won't work, say, if it's missing a
few bolts?

A: Not better, but that's how things come to me. Dilbert thinks the fact
that a pager is pink is irrelevant. I think it's clever. When the chips
inside are identical, packaging matters. Marketing  product when we're
selling perceptions. In the digital world, that's what there is. Diplomacy.
How we present ourselves in symbols.

Q:  You like to "network" too, I imagine?

A: Absolutely. Hanging out in the Web is the name of the game, even if it
goes nowhere.

Q: Why would someone want to go nowhere?

A: Well, there isn't really nowhere to go, there's always somewhere. Like
divination. The Web is a meaningful network of symbols that if nothing else
displays ourselves for all the universe to see.

Q: <smirk>

A: Anyway, I was talking about networking with a typical representative of
the dominant culture here in the upper Midwest, an STJ if ever there was
one. He said, "Sorry, but that sounds like a woman.

"Someone asks me to lunch," he said, "if I don't know by the time we're
eating what they want, I get angry.  The thought of meeting just to have
lunch - just to "connect" - makes me nuts."

Q: Of course it does. So what's your point?

A: Don't you think that's interesting? <pause>  Oh. Well, it's kind of a
game, see, just getting out there into the Web. Start when you want and not
be behind, quit when you want and not be ahead.

Q: Then how do you know who wins?

A: Everybody wins.

Q: Huh. Alice in Wonderland.  <pause>  But the Net's exploding with
commerce, ways to make money. It does matter how it gets built, who gets
what.

A: I won't argue with that. The rewards appropriate to knowing how to do
whatever are always exactly that, the appropriate rewards. Meanwhile the
Web is becoming the air we breathe. To me, that's what matters.

Remember the robber barons. For a generation, the men who built the
railroads looked like they were going to own America. By the end of their
time, though, the infrastructure had been built, most were bankrupt, and
something brand new was being born. But the railroads were in place. That's
what mattered to the next generations. Where is the Soviet Union now and
the Space Race?

Q: So what will matter to the "next generations?"

A: [faraway look in his eyes] I don't have a clue. All I know is what's
happening now.

Q: And ? What do you see?

A:  I see only the obvious.

Our religions, the symbol systems we worship instead of God, are cracking
and about to explode. The molten flow will coalesce into different shapes
of beliefs, new gods rising in the steam. The shape of the global economy
itself will pull political realities into the next century after it, like
civilization bootstrapping itself, and what we call nations will be tribal
identities or neighborhoods. The earth is our cradle, and the contact with
other life that has already happened will quicken in our consciousness when
we see what's right in front of our eyes. We'll re-invent and engineer
ourselves and then be able to understand a little bit more where we came
from and why. Maintaining social order will matter more than anything else.
In the name of security and efficiency, we'll sell our freedoms for a mess
of digital images. We'll invent more sports to keep people off the streets.
We'll manage the aftermath of catastrophe. Humankind will move through a
zone of annihilation in which everything we thought ourselves to be -
everything - is called into question. We'll think we are losing our Mind,
only to emerge on the other side when we least expect it. As we come to
recognize our collective Self, what we call psi will become an integrated
aspect of knowing. And what we call culture, when we have encountered
deeply the way the alien races think, the way they construct their millions
of years of non-history, will invent itself as an image in our minds seen
through their eyes the way, for example, Hawaiians imagine Hawaiian culture
in the reconstructed image of the European mind.

Q: <shrug> Well. As you say, that's all happening now. That's nothing new.
That doesn't give me any answers.

A: No. It's nothing new. It's just a digital monkey chattering to itself.

Subject: File 3--Blitzkrieg server computer virus

You know, every once in awhile I lean back and say "I've seen it
all in the antivirus world."  Then something like THIS comes
along...

The London Sunday Times, New Scientist magazine, Hewlett-Packard,
and the Armed Forces Communications & Electronics Association
published separate stories about the amazing new "Blitzkrieg
server computer virus."  AFCEA's president (a retired three-star
general) stakes his association's reputation on this story.
Here's what we know so far about Blitzkrieg creator Larry Wood and
his company's new product:

   * The Blitzkrieg server computer virus defends networks by
launching retaliatory strikes against a hacker's Internet provider
and every hapless customer logged on at the same time.

   * Larry Wood "will simulate a computer attack that disables a
defense agency by making it impossible to launch any missiles"
during TechNet'98 (the Defense Department's version of COMDEX).

   * The Blitzkrieg server computer virus can resolve Heisenberg's
uncertainty principle -- a feat which will guarantee Mr. (not Dr.)
Wood a Nobel prize in physics, since it flies in the face of how
we currently perceive the universe at the quantum level.

   * Wood says the Blitzkrieg server computer virus "assimilates
all other nodes attached to the network in a process that is
intentionally transparent to the host computer irrespective of any
antivirus preventive or protective mechanism."  [Translation: "you
will be assimilated; resistance is futile."] It can move to
another network without detection, too.  "As the wind is to a puff
of smoke [sic], no trace of the virtual machine, its dynamic
problem-solving state or its historical activities remain upon
transfer from a network host unless ordered by the collective,"
Wood declared.  [His use of the term "collective" equates to the
Borg collective in Star Trek.  "Automacapcids" (not "drones")
describe individual elements within the collective, similar to the
term used in a recent episode of the X-Files.]

   * The Blitzkrieg server computer virus can peer into the future
with astounding clarity.  "After only two weeks of on-line
operational testing, the Blitzkrieg server determined a high
probability that a hacker attack would be targeted at specific
U.S. corporations and California state government installations.
The server predicted that the network attack would be from
Japanese nationals with the help of U.S. collaborators affiliated
with the 2600 international hacker group."

   * On a lesser note, the Blitzkrieg server computer virus can
trace spam email to its original source and can "plant a virus" on
those computers.  Talk about a useful function!

   * AFCEA's magazine editor (originally "sworn to secrecy" about
some of the details) believes CIA or NSA "will probably make it
black now," meaning they'll classify the entire project to keep it
from falling into the wrong hands.  An unnamed CIA agent (aren't
they all?) called the Blitzkrieg server computer virus
"potentially more dangerous than nuclear weapons" should it fall
into the wrong hands.  And "the thing is [only] in a prototype
form right now" according to AFCEA's magazine editor.  Imagine
what the final product could do!

   * Wood's company claims the Los Angeles Times wrote a
copyrighted story about Blitzkrieg.  Actually, it's word-for-word
identical to a press release with a Business Wire copyright
notice.  The Times business desk couldn't find the story in their
news archive.  And why does AFCEA's magazine editor appear on the
press release as the primary contact for more info?

Subject: File 5--Wiretaps Increase in 1997; Only Two Computer Taps (EPIC fwd)

=======================================================================
[3] Wiretaps Increase in 1997; Only Two Computer Taps
=======================================================================

State and Federal wiretapping increased by three percent in 1997
according to the annual report of the Administrative Office of the U.S.
Courts, released last week. The total number of wiretaps approved by
state and federal judges in 1997 was 1186, up from 1149 in 1996.  There
was a slight decrease in federal orders and an eight percent increase
in state requests, mainly from a special New York police anti-narcotics
squad.  Once again, no request for a wiretap order was turned down by a
federal or state judge.

Investigation of drug cases was again the major reason for wiretaps.
Seventy-three percent of all applications listed narcotics as the
primary reason, up from 71 percent the previous year.  Gambling and
racketeering each accounted for eight percent of the applications.
Only three cases involved "arson, explosives, and weapons" cases.

Wiretaps continued to be relatively inefficient as an investigative
tool. In 1997, each tap intercepted an average of 2081 calls for a
total of nearly 2.5 million calls intercepted.  Only 20 percent of
conversations intercepted were deemed "incriminating" by prosecutors.
Federal taps were even less efficient -- only 16 percent were deemed
"incriminating."

An analysis by EPIC of the reports for 1995-1997 has found that while
the FBI continues its push towards limiting cryptography used to
protect the privacy of electronic communications, federal and state
investigators only conducted five wiretaps that involved computer
communications in that period.  In 1997, two such instances were
reported.  The two 1997 cases were a fraud case in Ohio and an
extortion case in Illinois.  The Illinois order was only in force for
six days and did not yield any "incriminating conversations."

Administrative Office of the U.S. Court's 1997 Wiretap report (in PDF
format) is available at:

=======================================================================
[5] Industry, Public Interest Groups Ask FCC to Delay Wiretap Law
=======================================================================

Public interest groups, telecommunications companies and trade
associations filed comments with the Federal Communications Commission
on May 8 asking the FCC to delay the implementation of new technical
standards required by the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement
Act (CALEA).  Under the law, telecommunications companies and equipment
manufacturers have until October 25, 1998, to implement new standards
for digital wiretapping or face heavy fines.  However, delays due to
controversial FBI demands in the standard-setting process have
prevented them from being adopted.

Comments filed jointly by EPIC, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and
the American Civil Liberties Union asked the FCC to indefinitely stay
the proceeding until the controversy over the standards are resolved.
The groups also urged the FCC to issue one order covering all
companies, rather than process several thousand individual requests for
relief from the requirements.

%T   "Firewalls Complete"

While there is a large amount of information in this book, and a
particularly valuable compilation of vendor data, I am not sure that I
can agree with the claim to be complete.  It is difficult to point out
specific gaps in the work, since the whole volume could use a thorough
reorganization.

Part one is described as a reference section.  Chapter one, rather
oddly for a security book, deals not with security, but with the
TCP/IP suite of protocols.  This appears to set the stage for a
technical treatment of the subject.  Networking details continue in
chapter two with an overview of the various connection methods over
the net.  I am always delighted to get more information about new
Kermit products, but I would sympathize with any reader who was
confused about what this material may have to do with firewalls.
Encryption gets a brief review in chapter three.  The content gets the
basics across, but is of uneven depth between topics.  Chapter four
does start to provide security, and specifically firewall, related
information in regard to the Web.  The data is good, but seems to be
somewhat random and unstructured.  Advanced Web security areas
(including a more detailed examination of ActiveX vulnerabilities) is
found in chapter five.  Chapter six looks at specific programming
problems with the standard net APIs (Applications Programming
Interfaces) but does not address firewall responses.

Firewall technologies, implementations, and limitations are discussed
in part two.  Chapter seven attempts to define firewalls and describe
firewall technologies, but concentrates almost exclusively on packet
filtering aspects.  Vulnerabilities of individual Internet
applications are the subject of chapter eight, but many concerns
mentioned are more potential than actual (and thus difficult to defend
against) while a good deal of the content (including a complete, ten
page Perl script) is repeated from earlier chapters.  "Setting Up a
Firewall Security Policy," in chapter nine, is much broader, touching
on many security topics that may have little or nothing to do with
firewalls.  An example is the information on viruses, which is
generally trite.  The overview of antiviral software betrays no
knowledge of activity monitoring or change detection classes of
programs.  The recommended protection procedure suggests copying
downloaded programs to a floppy disk rather than the hard disk, which
is both useless (malicious software invoked from floppy will generally
happily destroy data on your hard drive) as well as being impractical
in these days of enormous packages.  The more effective approach would
involve a type of firewall: an isolated machine that could download
software and test it before the programs were used on production
machines.  Chapter ten is supposed to address issues of design and
implementation, but deals primarily with considerations for evaluation
of specific products.  The question of design is made more problematic
by the fact that the second major type of firewall Goncalves proposes,
an application gateway, while first mentioned in chapter seven, is not
defined until chapter eleven as a more generic form of a proxy server,
which is itself first mentioned in chapter five but not described
until this point.  Chapter twelve covers basic auditing of the
firewall, while chapter thirteen promotes the TIS Internet Firewall
Toolkit and offers three ludicrously short "case studies."

Part three is chapter fourteen, which lists firewall vendors and
products.  Descriptions of the products are extensive, and sometimes
technically detailed, but it is difficult to call them evaluations,
since there is little analysis of strengths and weaknesses.  It is
also hard to make comparisons, since there is little similarity of
format in the entries.  Appendix A is a collection of vendor contact
information.

Goncalves' writing on any given section is quite readable.
Explanations are clear and illustrations can even be amusing.  At
times it seemed that the material was moving into common traps and
misconceptions, but ultimately the analysis is generally balanced and
realistic.  However, in some cases there is an apparent contradiction
between one paragraph and the next.  The incongruity disappears on
more rigorous scrutiny, but the text can be startling.  In addition,
the structure of the book, both overall and within individual
chapters, leaves something to be desired.  It can be difficult to
follow developing concepts, and also to use the book as a reference by
going back to specific topics to pick up particular points.

As an adjunct to Cheswick and Bellovin's "Firewalls and Internet
Security" (cf. BKFRINSC.RVW) or Chapman and Zwicky's more practical
"Building Internet Firewalls" (cf. BKBUINFI.RVW), this work does have
useful information.  As a reference or introduction it falls short.
