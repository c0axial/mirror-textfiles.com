Islands in the Clickstream:
If Truth Be Told


The press coverage of the Black Hat Briefings II and Def Con VI tells part
of the story, but the fact that mainstream media covered those cons the way
they did tells much of the rest.

Def Con is the biggest and most celebrated convention for computer hackers.
The con has grown from sixty to two thousand in six years. The Black Hat
Briefings, which grew out of Def Con, is a forum in which the best and
brightest hackers engage in serious conversation with experts in computer
security. The technical presentations are as good as it gets, and
attendance at Black Hat tripled in a year.

Stories about Def Con in the New York Times and L. A. Times had similar
slants: Young hackers who a few years ago hesitated to reveal even their
on-line handles now occupy critical positions in business and government.
Which is certainly part of the story.

The crew from CNN, however, floating through Def Con like the bright
shining bubble of the Good Witch of the North, was a symbol of a bigger
truth.

Leon Panetta once said that CNN inserted itself like a filter between our
minds and our own experience of reality.

Panetta recalled his arrival at the White House as Chief of Staff. One of
the first things he wanted to see was the Situation Room. He wanted to know
if it really looked like the one in "Doctor Strangelove."

So what did he find?

"Two guys in shirtsleeves sitting at a table watching CNN."

Now, think about it. A much younger Leon P sits in a darkened movie
theater. Inside his head are "symbolic modules" generated by his youthful
experience and education. "Doctor Strangelove" coupled an image of a
hidden, forbidden reality - the situation room where life and death
decisions are made - with that modular interface. With all his experience
and political savvy, Panetta still wondered when he arrived at the White
House years later if the image fit. He said it did not  but in a deeper
way, maybe it did.

Panetta saw two people interact with CNN, a medium that couples symbolic
modules with our modular constructions of reality. Panetta had interacted
with a movie that coupled a symbolic module with his construction of
reality. In other words, decades later he laughed at two guys for doing
what he had done  and he had believed in his images all those years.

The CNN crew attracted everyone's attention. The camera and fuzzy mike on a
long boom were huge, and every time they turned on the bright lights,
attention in the room swirled around them like water going down a bathtub
drain. Like physicists observing sub-atomic particles, they altered what
they saw by the act of observing it.

The reporters who directed the process knew their business, but not hacker
reality. "Three weeks ago, I had never heard of Def Con," said one. They
looked forward to the Black-and-White Ball on Saturday night because they
wanted good visuals. The visuals would be filtered to fit the expectations
of the audience - expectations created by the media,  where images of
hackers have replaced Cold War spies as magnets of fear and fascination.

The media need modules that snap tightly together without being forced.

News and entertainment are virtually indistinguishable in the digital
world. Their agendas are set by those who own the media and decide what is
thinkable. Those who determine the questions that can be asked do not need
to worry about the answers. The answers fly about in simulated opposition
like birds flocking to a few recursive rules inside a digital cage. Because
the birds have enough room, they do not even notice the cage.

At a deeper level, the structure of our information infrastructure
determines how we think, the questions that we ask. That infrastructure is
the context of our lives. Those who work at the nexus of context and
content rule the digital world.

We don't notice those cages either, but that's what the real geniuses at
Black Hat and Def Con are building. Those who code software and build chips
(i.e. code in a harder state, like ice and water) create the contours or
parameters of commerce, social interaction, and the kinds of wars we fight.

Although intrusion and data manipulation or destruction can be damaging,
hackers are not threatening simply because they can break into systems. At
the top level, it is their ability to piece together the Big Picture and
see how the imaginary landscapes that we call "the real world" are
constructed that constitutes a threat.

Hackers, spies and journalists resemble one another.

A reporter told me of her journey through ostensible coverage of the
software industry to the unintended discovery of how things really work.
Her off-the-record account detailed infiltration, collusion, and sabotage.
"It wasn't what I was looking for," she said, "but I can't forget what I saw."

I mentioned something a hacker had uncovered, and she laughed. I repeated
what I said and she laughed again.

"Ridicule is easy," I said. "The first line of defense of consensus reality. "

"I have to laugh at that," she said, suddenly not laughing. "I would go
insane otherwise."

If truth be told, that reporter is telling it. Wisdom and sanity depend on
a context to give them meaning. When the context shifts, wisdom becomes
nonsense, what is sensible sounds insane. And vice versa. The first line of
defense of consensus reality is always to laugh, then ridicule, then attack.


Hackers don't live inside that consensus. Nor do spies. They live too close
to the edge,  the terminator on the moon where everything is thrown into
relief, where intentionality creates consensus.  In a world of pure
information, intentionality is everything.

There's plenty of laughter at Def Con, but it's laughter at the paradox of
the mind observing itself, watching itself build worlds in which - in spite
of seeing marks of the tools on the raw material, the tools in our own
hands - we lack the freedom not to believe.

July 27, 1998
Report Reveals Cost of Computer Incidents at Universities
By PAMELA MENDELSBio

A student receives an e-mail message with a fake warning that he is a
suspect in a Federal Bureau of Investigation child pornography case. A
hacker sets up a "Trojan horse" log-in screen that captures the confidential
passwords of 75 university students. An innocent software upgrade leads to
weeks of computer crashes and disruption of service for students, faculty
and administration personnel.

These are three of the 30 incidents that researchers at the University of
Michigan uncovered in a recent report that examined computer-related
misdeeds and malfunctions in university settings.

The study took a look at computer snafus that had occurred from about
September 1996 to April 1998 at the 12 Midwestern universities that make up
the Committee on Institutional Cooperation. The group, an academic
consortium whose members include the University of Chicago, Northwestern
University, Purdue University and the University of Minnesota, paid for the
effort, called the Incident Cost Analysis and Modeling Project.

The purpose was to get an idea of the kind of computer problems that crop up
at the universities and to estimate how much they cost to handle.

<snip>

The study was prompted by concern that university lawyers and insurers need
a clearer picture of the kinds of mischief that university computers can
cause so they are better prepared to manage the risk.

<snip>

In the 30 cases documented, researchers estimated that universities spent
about $1 million in cleanup costs. The money paid for everything from new
equipment to staff time, including about 1,160 hours spent by one university
computer specialist to track down what eventually turned out to be a group
of 20 to 30 hackers, one of whom had used a university computer account to
try to threaten a California-based Internet service provider.

Rezmierski emphasized that the study was not a scientific one -- and for a
simple reason. Because no one knows about all of the computer-related
incidents that occur at the schools, researchers could not select a random
sampling of cases to examine.

<snip>

But hackers were far from the only source of headaches. Indeed, other
incidents involved old-fashioned theft, such as a break-in at a university
fundraising office. The stolen goods included a computer containing
sensitive information about 180,000 donors, including their Social Security
numbers, addresses and the amount of money they contributed.

<snip>

And some serious incidents happened without any malicious intent. For
example, among the cases studied, the problem that cost the most to solve
occurred in a bumpy attempt to update the software of a computer containing
student files, financial information and the school's Web page. After the
upgrade, the system began crashing frequently over a two week period and
then required another week of repair before it functioned properly.
It cost the university about $14,300 to fix the problem, but students, staff
members and professors lost about another $175,000 in time that could not be
spent working on computer-dependent projects.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators accused GeoCities on Thursday
of lying to its Internet customers and revealing to advertisers
details that it collected about people online, such as their income
and marital status.

GeoCities' shares fell more than 15 percent Thursday, down $7 to
close at $38.50.

Subject--Telling a Lie
Organization--University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee

According to an Associated Press story in today's Milwaukee Journal
Sentinel the company GeoCities gives people free space to build Web
sites in return for the answers to personal information questions.

The Federal Trade Commission has accused the company of releasing that
data to advertisers in violation of a promise not to do so.

This story is interesting in itself but brings to my mind the question
of just what does an individual owe a questioner who asks personal
questions.

If I am asked for my birthdate by an insurance company, I owe them an
honest answer as the true cost of insurance might well be affected by
the answer.  But if I am asked that question by the vendor of a
camera, perhaps on a warantee card, I can reasonably argue that there
is no need to speak the truth, the warantee should be valid if I am 1
or 100 years old.

Of course I can just refuse to fill in the answer and submit the form
with a blank field, but I can alternately answer with a deliberately
false value.  After all, a blank field gives the vendor the
information that someone does not wish to participate in the survey
but a false answer, given by several folks, gives the vendor reason to
believe that the entire data set is invalid, a much more satisfying
result.

Subject: File 4--new book on Alan Turing

              Alan Turing's Biographer Publishes New Book on Turing,
               Pays Tribute to Gay Genius at a Dedication Ceremony

                              by David Batterson

     Mathematician Andrew Hodges, author of the biography, "Alan
Turing: the Enigma," has a new book out on the British gay computer
genius Alan Turing, and Hodges also recently paid tribute at Turing's
birthplace in England.
     About his newest book, Hodges said "my short text on Alan
Turing's philosophy of mind appeared in November 1997 as 'Turing,'
number three of a new series of 'The Great Philosophers' issued by
Weidenfeld and Nicolson (London).  My subtitle is 'Alan Turing: a
natural philosopher.'  It runs to 58 pages, about half taken up with
original Turing text, and half with my commentary."
     "Turing" is available on Hodges' recently updated Alan Turing
Home Page (www.turing.org.uk/turing/).
     Hodges added that "in accordance with the scheme of the Great
Philosophers series, the text is intended to show exactly what Turing
wrote, particularly regarding the Turing machine.  To some extent this
is a condensation of the critique in my biography.  But I've found
something new to say about the development of Turing's thought; in
particular about the way his ideas developed between 1935 and 1945."
     Alan Turing (1912-54), was an openly-gay computer genius, one of
the most significant pioneers in the history of computers.  He founded
computer science (1936), cracked the German U-boat "Enigma" cipher
during World War II (1939-45), led the world in schemes for computer
software (1945-47), and started the first Artificial Intelligence
program (1946-50).
     According to Hodges, "Alan Turing was the originator of the
computer as we understand it now.  He was also an open gay man.  In
1952 he was arrested, and although unrepentant at his trial had to
submit to humiliating treatment with hormones (Estrogen) to avoid
going to prison.  He found himself under watch.  In 1954 he ended his
life; he ate an apple dipped in cyanide."
     Hodges said that "on June 23 I had the honor of being asked by
English Heritage to unveil the official Blue Plaque on Alan Turing's
birthplace.  It would have been his 86th birthday."
     The day turned out to be ironic.  "There was a great deal of
publicity for the 50th anniversary of the world's first working modern
computer," Hodges said, "which ran at Manchester on June 21, 1948.
And at 10:30 p.m. the night before, the House of Commons had voted by
a large majority to change the law so that homosexual and heterosexual
acts would alike be governed by an 'age of consent' of 16."
     At the tribute, Hodges read a statement from the Rt. Hon. Chris
Smith, the UK Minister of State for Culture, Media and Sport, which
stated:  "It is long overdue and very welcome indeed that the
birthplace of Alan Turing should now receive official recognition.
Alan Turing did more for his country and for the future of science
than almost anyone.  He was dishonorably persecuted during his life;
today let us wipe that national shame clean by honoring him properly."
     Excerpts from Hodges' June 23 oration follow:
     "In 1952, while Nazi war criminals went free, Alan Turing faced
punishment: a choice between prison and chemical castration.  The
shame is that this country enforced a sexual Apartheid law which
penalized honesty.  Betrayed by his country, Alan Turing embodied
scornful resistance to that Apartheid; he acted and suffered
accordingly."
     "Turing being a free-thinking free-living and open homosexual
could not, at the height of Cold War panic, be consistent with his
chosen duty, of knowing innermost secrets of the security state.  But
it does not amaze me that eventually he found existence
self-contradictory and life unlivable, on that tenth anniversary of
the invasion made possible by his work."
     Playwright Hugh Whitemore used Hodges' "Enigma" as the basis for
his play, "Breaking the Code."  The "cut-down version of the play" was
filmed for BBC television, and later appeared on "Masterpiece Theatre"
in the U.S.
     Hodges wasn't too happy with the results, saying "what I really
hope to see is a real film based on my book, something true to history
but connecting with the 1990s and beyond."
     Hodges" Website contains "The Alan Turing Internet Scrapbook."
As Hodges explained its content, "these pages are full of images and
links to exploit the interactive and cooperative world of the Web as
created by Alan Turing's invention, the computer.  They don't try to
give a complete picture. They will mix thoughtfulness and feeling and
anarchic humor like Alan Turing himself, and be in perpetual
development as the Internet expands."
     The biography of Alan Turing was originally published in 1983,
simultaneously in the UK by Burnett Books and Hutchinson, and in the
U.S. by Simon & Schuster. It's now in print in the UK Vintage
paperback edition, ISBN 0-09-911641-3.  You can also order "Enigma"
from the Turing Web site.  Hodges said "a new American edition is
currently being negotiated by my literary agents, but will not be
available until 1999."
     Hodges is now writing a novel titled "The Unwelding."  The author
said that "one reason for calling it "The Unwelding" is that it tries
to combine subjects which are usually kept far apart.  That makes it
highly realistic--real lives don't divide into neatly pigeonholed
'genres'."
     He added that "it's a 'gay novel' in that most of the characters
are gay men."  The content includes "explicit equations as well as
explicit sex. Taboos are broken," Hodges added.  A preview of the
novel is on the Web at: www.turing.org.uk/preview/.

ACLU Criticizes Lack of Might in Gore's =93E-Bill of Rights

Vice President Gore announced support for an =93electronic bill of
rights, to protect privacy of electronic communications earlier this
month. =93You should have the right to choose whether your personal
information is disclosed; you should have the right to know how, when,
and how much of that information is being used; and you should have the
right to see it yourself, to know if it's accurate, Gore said.

Privacy advocates, including the ACLU have said that while Gore's
statement is a move in the right direction, the administration still
fails to support meaningful legislative solutions -- and instead
continues to rely on self regulatory measures.

The ACLU believes that there is little incentive in a free market
setting to provide genuine accountability to the user for violations of
stated privacy principles.  Even where penalties are imposed by self
auditing programs -- these penalties may effect the site's accreditation
-- but there is no recourse available to an aggrieved user.

A recent ACLU survey of privacy policies of top rated financial sites,
one site out of the 14 reviewed uses the TRUSTe self- auditing
mechanism. However, the site disclaims any liability "for any breach of
security or for any actions of third parties which receive information."
None of the sites we surveyed provided anything beyond an e-mail address
for complaints or questions about privacy protections and half of the
sites do not provide even an e-mail address or a general privacy
information.

In a recent letter to the Department of Commerce, the ACLU stated that
the following principles must be incorporated into legislation in order
to provide true privacy protection:

-Personal information should never be collected or given out without
knowledge and permission by the subject of such information. The most
sensitive personal information, such as Security Numbers, should be
non-transferable without notification or express affirmative consent and
the circumstances under which it can be collected must be limited.

-Federal and state government may not acquire information that is
collected by the private sector. Moreover, individuals who are the
subject of improper government browsing of data should be provided
notice and redress.

-There must be no intermingling of government and private sector
collected data for the creation of membership or identification cards --
e.g. smart cards --which include private information and government
issued driver's license numbers.

-Organizations must inform users as to why they are collecting
personally identifiable information and they may not reuse such
information for any purpose other than the stated reason for which they
receive user permission. Information may only be reused if the
individual provides affirmative consent to the new use.

-Information that is collected with permission must be secure from
intrusion and unauthorized browsing. Any information that is no longer
being used for the stated purpose for which it is sought should not be
retained.

-Users who provide consent to collection of information must have the
right to examine, copy, and correct their own personal information.

-Government restrictions on the development and use of strong encryption
programs to secure online information and communications must be
removed. Such utilities must be widely available to provide security
against government and third party abuse of information.

These principles should be enforceable by law in order for individuals
to have recourse or remedies when their rights are violated.

The ACLU cited the need for such legislative protection because of the
widespread availability of thousands of online databases that provide
ready access to revealing personal information about ordinary people,
either through privately owned dial-up services or via the Internet.
=93These databases cover information ranging from tax records to arrest
records, home addresses and telephone numbers. Moreover, many sites that
provide personal information tout the ability to provide virtually any
information, the ACLU said.

the results of our informal survey of privacy policies of the =93top rated
financial sites can be found online at
