you should hear a click, and the red hot things are gonna light up
ok, next.. insertion, ok, you know.. blah blah, do whateever feels natural
for you, or whatever, then like, here are my recommendations:

withdraw before you ejactulate/get burned, this is probably a good idea to
avoid a nationwide problem.. toaster pregnancy.. thats right, what are you
gonna say when the toaster starts getting fat, or when it eats a slice of
toast, what are you gonna say when your mom asks, "how did the toaster get
pregnant?!" ok, but dont use condoms, it gets burned up and could stick to
you painfully.. ok.. one last thing, Toaster Rejection. 704573R R3J3C7!0N,
however you want to put it, its when your toaster pops you out before you
are ready, well there are solutions, get another toaster, or set the timer
for longer

yep. ok, on to PIXIE STIX!@!# they rule!@!@#!# there are three catagories
thigns that rule can be put in.. sexual, games, or drugs, and im not sure
where pixie stix go
drugs: sugary enough to be regulated
sex: hey, they make you hyper
games: be creative, im sure you could make a game such as "superinhale" or
sumfin, ok, anyway, so they rool, if youe never see a pixie stick here is a
handy diagram...
