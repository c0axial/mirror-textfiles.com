----------------[ w0ol #8: we force you into unbearable positions ]----------

we force you into unbearable positions, think about it, we do, and not 
only sexual ones, social ones too, admit it.  typical day, you read a 
w0ol, suddenly your overcome by the desire to twist your ankles into your 
armpits, see, strange sexual position, also unbearable, then you get to 
school by walking on your knees.  at school someone walks up to you and 
says something, it remides you of something you read in w0ol, so you say 
"hey dude, i read this thing in w0ol, it was sooo un-funny" then you 
repeat it, to this they reply "oh my god you clearly homosexual 
person!^#% reader of w0ol!@^% stone him!%@&" others say "i agree, shove 
stones in all his orfirces!^*" besides the fact that your ankles are in 
your armpits, you have ALOT more trouble walking home.

---------------------[ ha ha ]----------------------------------------------

that reminds me of something, once i was laughing at my monitor, cause 
someone said something funny on a BBS, and my mom walked by and made fun 
of me or something cause i was laughing at the computer, grr, so later 
while she laughed at the TV i made fun of her, hrmph.

-------------[ good god, that was pointless ]-------------------------------

i know you didnt need to hear it, ok, here is a quote from an IRC 
Operator Non-person i talked to.. TheRose, if you read this and ban me, 
ill kill your first-born-chincilla. 

[TheRose:therose@millenium.texas.net] you know of course you just banned
 yourself from my server for running clonebots.
<*-[therose]-*> ugh, i was just seeeeeeeeeeeing something.
<*-[therose]-*> i didnt actually do anything bad, i connected them, joined
                them, killed them..ugh.
[TheRose:therose@millenium.texas.net] seeing something?
<*-[therose]-*> i just wanted to see if it stilll worked.ugh
[TheRose:therose@millenium.texas.net] see if what still worked?
[E/X] TheRose requested version information for you.
<*-[therose]-*> see if clonebots still worked
*** nettle is away: Automatically set away. (Away since 8:16 am Sun Apr 28)
[E/X] nettle requested version information for you.
[E/X] Version: nettle: w0ol comes from sheep!
[TheRose:therose@millenium.texas.net] you know also that we don't allow lame
 versions
[TheRose:therose@millenium.texas.net] get yourself a REAL version
<*-[therose]-*> w0ol does come from sheep though.
[TheRose:therose@millenium.texas.net] the truth of the version.
<*-[therose]-*> ugh, ok..
<*-[therose]-*> the reason my version says that is that i write a e-zine
                called w0ol, so i like that
[TheRose:therose@millenium.texas.net] don't be surprised if you get 
banned for not having a real version. I'll let it go this time... also 
know that we don't allow bots of any type.
<*-[therose]-*> im not a bot, im sorry for the clonebots thing, it wont 
happen aagin
[TheRose:therose@millenium.texas.net] I hope not.
<*-[therose]-*> ok


-----------------------------[ that was, well, dorky ]----------------------

ok, my BBS might go back up, its called Node Island, or Ni, umm, it usta 
run MBBS before i lost it, and now im trying to get *nix MBBS to start it 
again, so if i do (or if you have it) send me it, and Ni will retunr, woo!

-----------------------------[ laymur ]-------------------------------------

ok, typical situation, you dont like someone but this person loves to 
hang around with you for no reason.  im going to relay information 
through text to you which will ruin this attempt!@! ya! i say "ok" too 
much to start sentances. hm, alright, stage one: embarrasment. get them 
to tell you some dark secret, and hint it off to everyone, ie: they once 
fucked an iguana, say "i iguana do this work" in front of them to say, a 
teacher.  step two: go to their house and wreck it, if they have a dog, 
bring a bowl-sized bag of some dogfood they DONT have, on to the carnage, i 
mean, eat food in their basment or whever THEY hang out and drop lots of 
it under the couch, and also spill soda on some mag their parents like, 
now, pick your nose infront of his siter, then say you gotta go to the  
bathroom, go in there, if htey have deodorant cut it FLAT with a knife 
or something, then get it all wet, put water in their mouthwash, put  
toothpaste on the faucet-where-the-water-comes-out bit, and then you get 
to pissing, piss on the seat, not too much, but enough, if they have 
carpet get it too, if they dont try getting some piss behind the toilet,  
then you move on, oh yeah, squeeze out the last few drops of piss onto a  
paper towel, drop it in the garbage. dont flush. get out, your hanging,  
making a mess, now its time to move in on the food, if theyve got  
lucky-fuckin' charms or something shitty with marshmellows, open the box  
and shake it till most of the marshellows converge at the top to 
negotiate with you, give them no mercy, scoop them up and eat them, the  
food will suck. get some meat or cheese and put it in the dishwasher, 
also take some sauce of some type, get ranch-dressing, youll use it 
later, then open some liquid-solids like A1 ort something, and knock 
them over in the fridge. ok, go over to the dog bowl, pick it up and 
empty it into the garbage, now put YOUR dog food in there, once the 
doggie gets indigestion and poops nasty shit on their porch or something 
theyll change their minds about you, next go up to the room, while X isnt 
looking pour ranch dressing inside the blankets, then just hang around 
and make a mess in general then leave. woo.

-----------------[ woah, hey, can i come over your house, i guana ]----------

shut up. bumbityboo, im arguing with some machead over some stupid stuff, 
and he is consistently referring to DOS-software problems as hardware 
problems, ugh. so im not talking to him anymore:)

damn right, hmmmm, oh yeah, its time for an amazing adventure of ASCII MAN!

------------[ ascii man we love you!#!@ ]-----------------------------------

ok, ascii man is patrolling the streets of his hometown, lameland and 
looking for crime, suddenly
                             ,'
    .                     .b,`
   d$bsss   suddenly...  d$P
  s$$o                  s$$*
  s##=                  s##O
  `$$'                  `$$'

there was a HUGE explosion, so ascii man ran to the sceene, there were 
several people there, he jumped towards the victims and carried them 
away, then he met evil Mr AssholeGuyWhoBombedTheBuilding
              /--------\
           /~^         ^~\
          |   ./\.  ./\.  |
          |   `\/'  `\/'  |
          \___-_-_-_-_-___/ - Muahah, ascii man, you are under my control
          /~~~-~-~-~-~-~~~\
          \_______________/

ascii man was frightened, he whipped out his ascii-gun and shot

 
    .$$$$##$$$$$$$$$$$$.
   ,@$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$'
   $%#%$L$
   $#%#$$'
   $%#%$
   $#%#$
    ~~~

          |   `$@'  `\/'  |
          \___-_-_-_-_-___/ - ow you bastid, my eye!@            
          /~~~-~-~-~-~-~~~\
          \_______________/

ascii man had no choice, he shot several more times

             /---------\
           /~^    *^   ^~\
          |   .*&.'&./\.  |
          |   `$@'  `\/'  |
          \___-&%@-_-_-___/ 
          /~~~-~-~-~-~*&~~\
          \___________%$__/

Mr AssholeGuyWhoBombedTheBuilding fell to the floor dead, ascii man 
loomed over him and this was the last thing he saw..

                  .%%.
             .$$$$$$$$$$$$.
           .$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$.
             .@@@.    .@@@.
             $   $    $   $
             $ %%$ %  $ %%$
             `@@@' $$ `@@@'
                   `'
           `s              s'
             $$          $$
               $$$$..$$$$
                   ~~

Lesson: never fuck with ascii man.
