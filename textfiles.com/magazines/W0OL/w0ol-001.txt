-----= [ welcome to w0ol, an intro ] =----------------------------------------
hey everyone!@!# its w0ol time!@
yay
ok as you can see im a freak, lame, annoying, etc (please dont stop 
reading) ok, note my amazing name
i was saying something about w0ol (randomgly) and was suddenly hit by the 
divine inspiration of phorce....watch thsi.. GPM quote time
:w0ol
[Phorce]: that should be the name of a 'zine.
so i figured "yeah that should be, but who will write it?" then i was 
inspired, the clouds opened up, a bright light shown, and a large shit 
fell on me from above... "NOOOOOO! i screamed" then i realized i was 
cursed to write w0ol forever by myself... ok, i say w0ol too much... let 
me giv eyou an amazing rundown on myself

-----------------= [ no thats quite alright ] =------------------------------

ok
you know hwat i love? i love talking to mysefl on the divider, it makes 
it seem so real, like your actually talking to me, wow, its freaky, i saw 
it all the time somewher and now i cant stop. im sorry.. ok.. im a 
nettle, a plant, w0ol, i can sting you, phear me. ok anyway, back to 
topic...uh yeah, various shit, im done

------------= [ you know what? you should say more stuff you hate ] =---------

yeah you know, your right readerlytype person, i should, so ill say some 
things i hate:
1) AOL AND CAPS
2) accidneatllly hitting caps key and making yourself look like a lamer
3) people who are like "oh yeah im open minded" then their like all 
racist and stuff
5) i ahte it when my stuff gets out of order
4) people who bitch, complain, or write lists of compliants
6) jokes that are overused
7) anything to do with listing, orgnization, or whatever

wow, i was about to delete that garbage but you know what, ill let it 
fester there and grow under me, to be my children, wow i cant wait... 
ok.. wow, heh, im back, i just drew the volcano (see top of issue) you 
know what is freaky, sometimes i can draw cool things in ascii and others 
i just suck, in fact i think i suck all the time but sometimes im deluded 
into thinking tha twhatever i drew looks like whatever i wanted it to 
look like, kinda like thoes ink-blot things, which i dont believe really 
work because ink is a psychotic kinda thing, i think thoes things have 
subliminal commands to pay extra and tip the psychologist. conspiracy.

------------= [ yeah i know man, happened to me ] =--------------------------

really? mabey you should see a psychologist... ok anyway now that its 
apparent that i cant write its DINNER TIME! ok thanks, after a short 
break of eating god knows what and playing "contra" (0ld) for a few 
minutes (until my bro poured water on me and i left) im back to write 
w0ol.. ok...hmm i need some art, ill draw a cow
