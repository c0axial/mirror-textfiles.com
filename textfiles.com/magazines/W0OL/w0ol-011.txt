------------[ w0ol #11: how nettle hax0red the FBI ]------------------------

ever since i hax0red the fbi i haven't had much time to run around and 
write for w0ol, cause i've been runnin' frum da law, y0. so i've had some 
trouble gettin' to mah computah! now im gonna tell you how i managed to 
hax0r the fbi with such ease and style, fewl.

-------------------[ eleet! ]-----------------------------------------------

yes. i was elite. hax0ring the fbi isn't easy if you're LAME. duh. so 
here is my elite nfo on how to hax0r the fbi.

--------[ fbihax0r.nfo ]----------------------------------------------------

 : to : public
 : re : hax0ring the fbi
 : y? : for fun!
 `----'

first: i take no responsibilty if someoen actually hax0rs the fbi, agian, 
like i did, for some weird reason such as i told them how. 

one: on with the wacky-elite! ok, first you're going to need a tv, if you 
don't have one then STEAL ONE, duh, now wait till friday, at friday turn 
the tv on and watch chan 5 until the X-Files comes on, while the intro is 
running wit the rad music you'll see two fbi-pass-things! if you aren't 
k-rad enought to catch them and draw one then here is a subst. 

  ,--------------------------.
  :      fbi pass thing      :
  :--------------------------:
  : your name     your age   :
  : your bday     your addrs :
  : your phone    logo       :
  `--------------------------'

simply print this issue and fill in the infoes, oh, and the FBI PASS 
THING should be BLUE at the top, and replace everything with the correct 
stuff, and for the logo put in this:

      $$$$$$ $$$$$$. $$$$$$$  
      $$$    $$$ $$$   $$$ 
      $$$$$  $$$$$$'   $$$
      $$$    $$$ $$$   $$$
      $$$    $$$$$$' $$$$$$$

execpt write 'elite' for every line, that way when someone looks at it 
they are subconciously mezmerised by elitness, and they let you in.

tew: go to the s3cr3t fbi headquarters, show them your pass, now you have 
3lyt3 access, what i did was go around pissing in people's coffee, i'm 
sure you can think of something fun to do at the fbi buttquarters!

--------------------------[ spd. lmt. wrz. ]---------------------------------

wow! we're groovin' now! ok, hmmmm, so uhm, wow, i'm so bored.. let me think.
well
one day i was groovin' (see previous sentence!) and i kinda just grooved 
my way over to the snacks, and munched a few down, and then i grooved my 
way back to my lifelong companion fil.  fil gets pissed when people call 
him phil so i avoided it.  divergent.

------------[ wha? ]--------------------------------------------------------

sell your shoes.
"what?"
i mean it.
"uhm."
sell them.
"why?"
because. you don't understand.
"uhhh"
S-E-L-L. Y-O-U-R. S-H-O-E-S.
"ok!"
now thats much better!
