------------------[ w0ol #6: the annual collage issue ]--------------------

this w0ol is composed of several peices of "writing" in a grueling 
attempt to release another w0ol on time.. please expect these annually 
(annually meaning "whenever i cant write anything") ok, we will start off 
with something i wrote for dto upon mogel's request, it sucks but i guess 
that showed when he didnt accept it, here we go

---------------[ eye love squids ]-----------------------------------------

wow really? here is a story about one!

--------------[ y00 4r3 s0 d4mn3d 3lyt3 ]----------------------------------

it was a happy day for Trank, as she jetted through the warm tropical 
water, he liked to swim by all the small fish, sometimes grabbing a few 
with one of his powerful eight arms, mostly that was how he got his food 
but occasionally there were barracudda around, which was a great problem 
for Trank.  As he swivled one of his large eyes about looking for good 
prey, he noticed the glimmer of a barracudda, as Trank attempted to turn 
away from it she couldnt help but notice it mimic her movements, she 
began to phear it.  As the barracudda approached her at great speed she 
had little choice but to do the nasty: ink the water, she squeezed hard 
with her ink-bladder-muscles and caused a great deal of the dark 
substance to be excreted, the barracuda had no chance of finding her now, 
she thought, as she swam away happily.  Trank began to happily head 
deeper into the warm waters towar a reef.  There she found the body, she 
had seen scuba divers before, but this one behaved strangely, at first 
she thought it must be trying to catch her, because it didnt move at all, 
then she noticed that it didnt have the large back of a scuba diver, so 
she started a head to toe investagation.  As she looked at the face she 
noticed it was quite light colored and a bit of the skin was peeling off, 
she moved down the neck to the torso and then hips, legs, and ankles, 
around the ankles were some large steel links which formed a tight 8, 
with one leg in each of the holes, attached to the middle of this Trank 
observed a large mettalic object.  As if from nowhere a small crab 
jettsoned itsself from the torso of the apparent scuba diver, upon 
Trank's examination the crab was holding nothing but a small peice of 
carrion.  Several more crabs began appearing on the body, some small, 
some huge, mostly just taking bits of meat from the body.  Trank wondered 
how the diver could endure such torture for so long, after what seemed 
like hours of pondering Trank left for her wise friend, Mr Moray.  She 
swam the way to his cave very quickly, but this was something she very 
much desired enlightenment on so she didnt mind the hurry.  When she 
reached Mr Moray's cove she knocked a few times on the coral, he then 
appeared. 
Trank: there is a scuba diver, he isnt moving, why?
Moray: ii woooouuulddd haaaveeee toooo seeeeee hiiiiiiimmm
Trank: ok, follow me.

Trank and Mr Moray then swam off towards the body, when they got there Mr 
Moray did some examining and sat back as if in deep thought.  Finally 
Trank piped up.

Trank: whats wrong?
Moray: HES DEAD YOU F00L!%!&*%!&$#^!%#* 
Moray: HOW COULD YOU NOT SEE THAT?!&!*^#@! YOU TAKE ME OUT OF MY CAVE 
JUST TO SEE SOME DEAD SHMUCK!(#^!(#&@!??
Trank: d--de---dead?
Moray: sorry, yes, he is dead
Trank: oh, how thoughtful
Moray: he was drowned, he couldnt breathe water
Trank: oh
Moray: only lamers cant breathe water, this man is a lamer.
Trank: well, uhm, i guess im going now.
Moray: bye.

Trank then swam off for quite awhile, trying to outrun the pain she felt 
because of Mr Moray's attack of her stupididty.  She could almost.  No, 
she'd never even thought of that.  Yes, she had to.  No, Yes, No, Yes.  
Their meaning blended together in her mind, she began to swim off towards 
shore like a zombie.  When she reached shore she threw herself into a 
wave, the wave was large and pushed her far up onto the hot sands of the 
beach, as she began to fade away she heard something approaching...

Bob: hey wow, a squid!^@ dude, we gotta take it!
Dave: no way, its dying
Bob: well put it in the water
Dave: dont you see?!@ only lamers cant breathe air!@ this squid is a 
lamer!&^% it must be destroyed!^*

Trank felt the foot descending on her, she felt it move from side to 
side, bits of sand went into her open wounds as she moved her last muscle.
Ink went everywhere.

------------------------[ uh, i can see why he rejected it ]----------------

really? so can i. it sucks. ok, now on to a piece of school work which i 
am supposed to do today, it is now rougly 4:30 in the morning, today at 
school i have to present this

you dont know how k-rad you have to be to stay up till 5am every night.

-------------------[ pretty damned k-rad id supposed ]---------------------

this is an award, shh in the back.

-------------[ award ]-----------------------------------------------------

people say nobody works anymore, people say that nobody tried, people say 
that nobody even cares, well today they are proven wrong by the youth of 
america. hello, my name is [EDITED OUT], but thats not important, we are 
here to ocelebrate Stacy's acheivments in our special and very selective 
group of goat murderers.  Stacy is a very hard working young woman with a 
firey passion for goat murdering, when she kills goats you know she has 
prepared for hours for the occasion, she never shows up with dull knives, 
she never makes a large mess, and she always removes the carcasses.  Not 
only has Stacy demonstrated great leadership in such things as the goat 
slaughtering contest, but she also has many other qualifications.  Being 
a goat murderer is not easy, and Stacy has tried very hard, she has 
broken many records including the Goat Massacre record where she broke 
the record of 45 goats by a massive 20, not only were these goats clearly 
dead, but they were killed with ease and style.  Stacy also helped us 
very much in a self-sacraficing manner when Bob was rammed in the face by 
an unruly goat at our last festivle, she even dropped from a race to 
bring him to a local hospital.  In giving this goat rib, which came from 
the goat she first slayed, by stabbing it in the eye with a scissor, to 
Stacy, id like to say that she is a role model to all of us, and not only 
a great goat slayer but one damned good leader.
