--------------------( w0ol #10: big smelly dogs are my heroes and stuff)-----

y'know, i always did love big smelly dogs.  they love me too.  y'know what i
mean?  'cuz one day i was jus' walkin' along, and this big'ol dog started
barkin' at me, and i shouted something at it like "DAMN YOU BIG ASS DOG!#
WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?!?#!"

then the owner of the dog came and and said something like "WHAT THE FUCK
IS WRONG WITH *YOU*, FEWLIO?!##!  MY DOG HAS DONE YOU NO HARM#!#!#!"

and i said something like "BITCH YOUR BITCH DOG OVER THERE BARKED AT ME AND
I WANT MY MONEY BACK!##!%%#!"

and she said something like "WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, YOU DIDN'T
GIVE ME ANY MONEY!#%*(&%#!(*)&%#"

and so i whipped out my gun and shot the dog in the leg.  i felt a little
guilty about that, but it was the owner's fault.  for being such a bitch.

and so she got all upset, and then she was afraid of me 'cuz i had a gun
and i was IN POWER NOW#!%%!#  so i reloaded and said "i'm gonna go ballistick
on your kneecaps if you don't give me my money back."

and she said "shit, man, i don't know what your talking about.  i know
ballistick is some lamur who now is creed and writes for some bad 'zine, but
you ain't given me any money, how da shit am i 'posed to give it back?"

so i shot the sorry bitch.  'cuz she wouldn't give me any money.

----------------------( hoe )------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------( no, the lady was a hoe )---------------

yeah, she even tried to sell herself to me for money.
