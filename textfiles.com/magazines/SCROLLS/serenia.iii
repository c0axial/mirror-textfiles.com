        Welcome to the third (yup, count em - one, 2, uhm, three!) issue
        of the Scrolls of Serenia. I'm not sure exactly how many (if
        any) people have been checking out SoS, but lately I have been
        getting some replies (which is better than none) about how the
        zine is definitely a good idea, and how most people aren't sure
        they've seen anything like it before.

        That's good...

        I think...

        Anyway, I personally think that SoS is proceeding nicely and I
        would love to hear from anyone out there about what they think.
        I don't currently have an internet email address, but you can
        email Belial (his address later) and he will definitely route
        your comments directly to me.


                   ***Note to first-issue readers***
        Well, if you're reading this and are at all interested, you
        should take the time to look around for the previous releases of
        SoS (issues #1 and 2) so that you don't get any more lost than
        you _will_ be after you're done reading this issue.
                   ***Note to first-issue readers***

        This month, I handled the ascii (as I did first issue, and
        Belial donated one for issue #2), which I think came out
        somewhat nicely. The first issue's ascii plainly sucked, and so
        I couldn't embarrass myself or SoS by making another punk-ascii
        for the second issue.

        Oh, and btw, I have officially changed my handle from "Warlock"
        to Lord Finesse, so now all o you flaming idi0ts can find out
        which of the thousands of Warlocks I really am...

        But... Like I say every time at about this time, eenuff about
        me, get to tha damned zine!

           |_|‰lk slept quietly and at peace. He slept all through that
        night and into the next day. I wondered when and if he would wake
        up. He seemed to be in a state of madness while he slept, yet his
        words and conversations stopped in the first night of his sleep.

        Then, on the third day of his sleep, he woke. His awakening,
        however, was not nearly as subtle as his sleep.

        He rose from his bed and greeted me, saying, "Ah! Ray, my man.
        Hurry! We must be off soon. Pack your trail gear, we must be
        off!"

        I asked T‰lk if he had been feeling alright, what with his
        previous illness and the scene in the square, and he calmed down
        a bit to "explain" past events to me.

        "My dear Reyhan, since my, [ehem], `encounter' with the angel in
        the square, my illness has healed during my sleep..."

        I accepted that, and I then asked him about this "being off" and
        the like.

        "Ah, that. Listen to me Ray, what I'm about to tell you might be
        a little, eh, hard to believe..." and with that, the event in the
        forest replayed itself in the back of my mind, "and all I can do
        is hope that you will believe me and follow me.

        "You see, while my body slept here, at home, my soul was taken
        away to meet with Geldrion, of the makers, and I was told that I
        had to fulfill a destiny and that you were to come with me.
        Everything that Geldrion told me I can't remember all now, but
        it slowly makes itself evident to me the longer I'm awake."

        I looked at him, dumbfounded and confused.

        "Ray?"

        "Yo, Ray?"

        "Raaaay?..."

        I stood there for a minute, taking all he has just told me in
        and applying it to the already-past events, and thus coming to
        the conclusion that I had nothing else to do, so...

        "aww, ahight. Since I got nothin better to do, and because I
        need a good workout," I put my hands together and cracked my
        knuckles, "I think my skills are gettin a little rusty."

        \_____/hile I chose to sleep and gather my strength that night,
        T‰lk stayed up for what I gathered to be all night, mapping routes
        and making plans for people to meet, places to stay, and other
        little odds and ends that we had to take care of during this
        quest which we were ready to set off upon.

        The next morning, T‰lk and I went to the town gates with our
        packs, threw them over, and we clambered over ourselves. Once
        outside the town, we began our trek, heading north.


        Soon after our leave of Andrion, we encountered the first of
        those "little" odds and ends I had anticipated.


        We traveled through the forest of Andrion, and when we came to
        the clearing, T‰lk pushed me into a bush and pulled me down. I
        began to speak and he made a quick gesture motiononing for me to
        shut up.

        I noticed he was intently watching something in the clearing,
        and as my sight followed his, I noticed a man, a bounty
        hunter-like character, kneeling down sniffing the ground and
        running his hands over foot tracks.

        T‰lk, eyes still fixed on the hunter, wispered, "Friend of
        yours?"

        I, somehow unnerved by his question, then looked at the man
        again and found that I did, in fact, know him.

        Of all the other rival hunters I had, Danno had been the largest
        pain in my ass for the longest time. They called him `The
        Relentless'; I mean, damn, where he came from, his _name_
        meant damage.

        "shit."

        "Heh. I thought so. But you can handle him, right?" T‰lk said,
        looking at me with a weak smirk on his face.

        "Handle? Why, whatever do you mean my good man?" I said
        mockingly in return, knowing what response was coming.

        "To tell you the truth, he is in possession of something we
        need."

        "And what would that be T‰lken, hm? Maybe a magic wand, or a
        golden scepter? What could it possibly be?"

        "No. It's a Pentagram."

        "A Penta-what!@? You want me to just outright take this guy for a
        Pentagram? Maybe you don't realize who this is. This is Danno
        The Rel-"

        "...you sound intimidated..."

        "I am NOT intimidated, I mean, god-damn T‰lk, the guy's name
        means damage!" I shouted, forgetting the devil I spoke of which
        stood in the clearing but a few paces from where we stood.

        At that point, T‰lk looked back into the clearing and
        frantically stood up. I spun my head toward the clearing and
        then I knew why. Danno was gone. This was bad.

        "Gone?" T‰lk said, dumbfounded.

        "Nah, he's hangin around here somewhere." I came up behind T‰lk,
        who was now standing in the middle of the clearing, and motioned
        for him to shut up. I opened my cloak, and handled the short
        sword with my left, putting my right hand in my small satchel and
        pulling a dagger.

        Danno himself wasn't the smallest or the lightest of hunters,
        but he was good. Not good enough, however, to move through the
        trees unnoticed by, say, another hunter.

        Danno himself was half Dwarf and half Man. No dwarf by himself
        could be a hunter, they're not at all gifted with stealth. Me,
        well, I'm mostly human, but I got just enough elven blood in me
        to get by.

        I strained to listen, but I could hear nothing. As a hunter, it
        would seem that Danno is sitting still.

        It was worse than I thought.

        No hunter sits still in a tree unless either he's sleeping, he's
        watching, or he's got backup. I doubted the first two and the
        latter was the only option left.

        I looked around slowly, completely calm. Gettin' hyped up before
        little rumble has been the death of many good fighters.

        Then I heard a small wisper from the trees, "ugh. ray?" the voice
        said in light disbelief. Danno dropped from the tree and drew
        his sword. "Ah my good friend Reyhan; the Royal Assassin! har-
        har!" His men dropped shortly after and he waved them off.

        Turning only his head around toward them, he said, "This is
        nothing I cannot handle. Go twiddle your fingers ar something."
        Then he turned back towards me, glaring intently and grinning
        slightly, expecting a battle.

        I presently motioned for T‰lk to back off and he, unlike Danno's
        peons, he silently understood and retreated to the edge of the
        clearing. "Nothing would please me more, and nothing would make
        my day more complete than to relieve you of the useless mass
        upon your shoulders, but my companion and I need something from
        you."

        And then Danno stopped his glaring, sheathed his sword, and
        spread his cheeks with a wicked smile. "And what would that be,
        my fine fighter?"

        "Professional."

        "Oh, well then, I apologize. Maybe you should not be so forward
        when it is you who wants from me, eh, 'professional'?"

        "A, <ehem>, a Pentagram." I said.

        "Ah," and his eyes lit up an illustrious and wicked red, "_my_
        pentagram. Well then, my good man, I will be needing something
        in return then, won't I now?" I knew he had a high asking price
        for his services, but I knew Danno wasn't greedy, and that he
        wasn't wanting money...

        So there I was. Laying close to madness in a foreign place that
        I've never seen before.

        Oh yeah, and there was this guy standing there. It was that old
        guy from the last dream I had. I looked up at him with a
        confused look.

        He stood there, hands behind his back, and hunched over to a
        small extent.

        "I have brought you here because there are forces working
        against that which you must do. They attempt to rob you of your
        possession and use it to their advantage..."

        "Forces?...they?...uh...possession?" I was completely jumbled
        by the move from where, eh, from wherever I was, to, eh,
        wherever I am now.

        "All will be explained in due time. Hmm. Perhaps you do not
        understand the, eh, magnitude of your situation.

        The "forces" which act against you are that of an evil demi-
        god, Neim. "They" are his minions and servants, the shadows
        and all things of dark Serenia, which Neim named the Dark
        Sovereigns. Unfortunately, they've already found you and now
        you must confront them or your mission will fail."

        "soff-er-ins?" I replied again, still feeling displaced.

        The man sighed, and kneeled down to me, looking me in the eyes.
        He mumbled to himself, "it's the only way we ever get anything
        understood ... these mortals just can't handle the jump."

        And with that he softly put his hands on my head. He had one over
        each ear, holding the side of my head and he was looking deep into
        my eyes, and then, without warning, I knew. I knew everything.
        For atleast one split second, I had a complete realization of
        everything everywhere. I knew of the nothing that existed before
        the Makers, I knew of Ll„n, of the other Makers, and at last, I
        knew of my mission. Clearly note that I still wasn't all too
        thrilled about it, but I did know.

        Then the man released his hands and looked away, giving my mind
        a rest so that it wouldn't burst. I looked up at him and, at
        that point, I had had a "moment of clarity" as some drunkards
        call it. I knew that this man was no man at all, that he was
        Geldrion, the Lord of the Makers, and now, if Serenia was to be
        saved, I had to obey him.

        Geldrion stood up again and said to me, "You now hold a part of
        me inside you. Not only do you possess the knowledge I have
        given you, but other gifts as well. Use these to help you in
        your mission, and save you and those with you. These I give to
        you in the name of Ll„n and all the Makers. May godspeed be with
        you."

        Once again, like it had before, reality began to blur and a
        maddening howl came from every direction, until I was back in
        the alley, surrounded by the Dark Sovereigns.
                  
        Damnitall! I put my face in my hands and hoped this was all
        a dream; though I doubted it...

        Whelp, there ya go. Another issue of SoS for the books. Oh yeah,
        that reminds me, once we get to the fifth (5th) issue, SoS will
        be releasing a 5-issue "compilation", which will include all of
        the first five issues. We will attempt to do one of these for
        every five issues so that those of you who have the tendancy to
        miss an issue or two here and there will still be able to catch
        up and not miss a thing.


        *** Special Note ***
        Included in the next issue we'll be starting a seperate part of
        the Scrolls, which will be called "Dark Legends". As you may have
        gathered by now, these current stories are from what is called
        the "First Age", in which the creation of the Serenia reality
        and its first encounters with godly evil are explained. The Dark
        Legends side-stories are the explanation of what happens after
        the First Age into the Second Age, and how Serenia has the
        strange tendancy not to be all that serene. My friend and
        part-time writer, LathSpell, will be doing a lot of the writing
        for DL and some of the editing for SoS as well.

        Why will this be seperate from the main Scrolls issue?
        Well, it will be included in the archive, but it will be a
        different file, but I think it will make SoS a lot more simpler
        to keep the storyline if we keep the past (where Scrolls is now)
        in the past, and the future (where Legends is) in the future. It's
        just the natural order of things =)

        What'll be so different between the First Age and the Second Age
        storylines?
        In the First Age storyline, there are 3 main stories: creation,
        which is the "narration" of what is happening throughout the
        other stories, Reyhan, which is one man's account of the
        *** Special Note ***
