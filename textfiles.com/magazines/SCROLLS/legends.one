                                eternity

           I've been on this earth, Serenia, for what seems like an
        eternity. I'm sick of it. The pain, the suffering, well,
        sometimes that's fun, but otherwise life is dull, boring. I used
        to be so many things, now I'm just a dying legend. Hopefully
        I'll die one of these days, when the makers are done with me and
        it is their will so to do.

           Only a short couple hundred years ago, this earth encountered
        a great evil, and the strands of the balance itself were thrust
        out of position by the battle that proceeded. The world that was
        left is not like the Serenia that was. It is no longer serene,
        and now evil things inhabit wherever they can.

           I had used to be prosperous in my encounters, well known and
        respected, as well as feared. I remember when I was first pulled
        into the Quest in a strange turn of events brought on by one of my
        closest companions, and then, once we had came to the end of our
        quest, we had crossed paths with some supposed demigod who
        claimed himself Neim.

           My companion, a bold yet intelligent man I hold in high
        esteem named T‰lk, had at that point told me that he had to
        handle this situation on his own. He told me that my part in
        his quest was done, and that it was time we said our goodbye's
        and that he'd see me, "on the other side". I began to leave and
        then realized I couldn't. I turned to go back and found T‰lk in
        swords duel with the evil Neim; a magical barrier over Serenia
        which had been created by Neim prevented the use of strong
        magical forces that those like Neim would use forced them into
        combat.

           Sparing details, Neim was not destroyed but imprisoned in
        a far backwater type of place, I'm not sure. T‰lk also is gone,
        I have no idea where he's been, during the battle both he and Neim
        just `poofed' and that was the last I've seen of him.

           After the Quest, I tried once more to settle down and have a
        life, which led me to a wife and son. I told my wife nothing of
        my immortality, for she would grievingly condemn me and deem me
        mad. We lived in my old city of Andrion, and one day, while I
        had been out in the marketplace, a band of brigands, whose first
        leader I had slain during the early stages of the Quest, killed
        my wife and stole away with my son.

           Since he was born, I had wondered if my son would inherit my
        immortality, or would he just be normal. Nevertheless, nothing
        could exceed my rage when I returned from the marketplace to
        find my wife hanging from the beams.

           For months upon years I searched far and wide for the
        brigands who took my son. They had broken up and spread across
        the land, thus I had to hunt them down one by one and slay them
        by hand. I eventually found all of them, but they could give me
        no information on the whereabouts of my son.
        
           I hope my son is still alive, and for some reason I think he
        is. I soon will be venturing out once more to search for my son,
        for I have, as the makers would have it, an eternity...

                         into the mistúchapter1

           In the light mist of a summer midday, a lone cloaked figure
        walks along a dirt road. The figure seems to be in no certain rush
        yet he keeps his pace, never slowing or stopping, relentless. Then,
        unexpectedly, he turns and looks in the opposite direction down the
        road. His cloak, covering his head and face is dark and wonderously
        clean despite the cloud of dust that englufs the area. Although the
        darkness that this cloak dons is not merely that of the cloth, but
        that of another, more mysterious source.

                The lone figure stands, fixed on his sight down the road, and
        then looks up into the sky, and then at the ground before his feet.
        His body language gives off nothing of his feelings, yet he turns and
        returns to his original walk along the dirt road.

                Then, in the distance, the sound of horses and men, maybe even
        warriors, strikes the old man as he looks frantically back down the
        road and then once again into the sky. He knows nothing else but to
        continue his wandering trek along the dirt road. Far along the road
        behind the old man an aura of smoke appears and from that emerged a
        pack of large men laced in royal arms. The man fails to notice the
        appearance of the men and continues down the road in a faster pace
        than before.

                The old man gets nowhere before the men overtake him. The men
        ride up and stop in front of him, blocking his path and forcing him
        to, if nothing else, stop. The old man did, in fact, stop and he kept
        his head low, saying nothing. The men seemed taken back by the silence
        of this man in the presence of royalty, or atleast thats what they
        claimed themselves to be. Something about this man got to them, they
        thought, something that reached into the back-ally shadows of their
        souls, and some of them wondered how long this charade was going to
        last. Even the leader of the men, the largest and apparently strongest
        seemed shaken by the brute force by which they had been somehow gripped.

        "You there!" the leader shouted, "What is your business? Where
        are you going?"

        The man stood silent for what seemed to the men for an eternity.

        The leader repeated himself, "YOU there! State your business or
        to the dungeons with you!"

           The man slowly moved his head back and forth, showing his motion
        only by the small movement of the cloak hood. Finally he said in
        a deep, evil voice, "Where is this place?"

           The warriors were somewhat taken back by the firm defiancy of
        the man, for who was he to challenge their might and power? But
        their leader, having a sudden sense of caution instilled in him,
        answered his question warily, and his battalion was taken even
        more aback by this.

        "You are in the Kingdom of Pehr Jrago, ruled by th-"

           As the leader of the men continued on with his lecture on the
        past and present details of his mighty kingdom, the cloaked man
        turned and departed. The leader, obviously content with himself,
        finally finished his speech and looked down from his hand-waving
        and over-bearing to find the old man gone.

           "Hmph." The leader thought to himself, "downright
        disrespectful..."

           The warriors, though, sat there, dumbfounded, appalled at his
        outright disrespect. Though they wanted to tear this man apart
        all night and behead him in the morning, they didn't. They
        couldn't explain it; any other time they wouldn't hesitate in
        such an action, but now, they just couldn't, and they were
        terrified at themselves for it. They looked back and forth
        between each other at each other, blank-faced while the leader
        merely sat there on his horse staring at the back of the old man
        as he drifted off down the road and eventually disappeared into
        the noon-day traffic of commoners.

        Then the smaller of the warriors dared to break the silence,
        saying, "Jor."
        
        The other warriors, including the leader, turned to look at the
        smaller warrior, and then, once again, they looked at each other
        and fell silent, this time easing into their saddles, content
        with that conclusion.

                          Lost memoriesúPart1

           In a dimly-lit forest, where the light is cut off high above
        in the canopies of the trees, faint footsteps can be heard. As
        short time passes, the steps become louder and more persistent.
        They are footsteps with purpose, strong, foregoing, unstopable.
        More time passes and finally a claim to the footsteps is made. A
        warrior clad in arms of a fallen kingdom appears out of the
        darkness and continues running. The man ducks into a bush and
        sits completely still, disappearing from sight.

           Then, once again, sounds can be heard from a distance. This
        time, though, they are not footsteps; they are horses and men
        shouting.

           The warrior looked back in the direction of the horses,
        straining to get a good look. "Damn." he muttered to himself.
        He hopped out of the bush and continued, faster in his plight.
        He wondered what was going on; why he was being chased by
        warriors, who he was, where he was, and much else because he
        remembers nothing of his past.

           He looks around as he runs, and flashes of the past remind
        of -- something ... that he can't remember. "DAMN." That's been
        happening to him often lately. He runs, and eventually the
        warriors on their horses burst through the brush only paces
        behind.

           He swings his head around, looking at the phalanx, then
        swerves his head back around. "Ah! What is that, out there?" He
        thinks aloud.

           It was a clearing, with a large building, like a fort, in it.
        As he drew nearer he could see that it was a fort, and as he
        reached the clearing, he called out to the gatemaster, who
        immediately recognized him and ordered the gate dropped.

           Once the gate had been dropped, fighters wearing grey arms
        emerged and charged past the lone warrior and toward the phalanx
        that had been persuing. Their leader stopped and turned to the
        warrior saying, "What have you done this time, Endrek, to get
        yourself into this mess? Outnumbered by brigands and running? Are
        you feeling alright? Hmm?" He looked deep into Endrek's eyes for
        what seemed like hours, and he was then brough back into reality
        by the clanging of weapons only footsteps before him.

        "Endrek, you never run from a fight, are you all right?" The
        leader said, looking at the blank stare of Endrek.

        "This is not good..." The leader said, half to himself and half
        to Endrek. The leader rushed he and his companion into the fort
        and left the fray to his men. Once they were inside the fort, he
        brought the lone warrior into the small tavern.

        The two warriors sat down and the leader continued, "Do you know
        who I am?"

        Endrek looked at him unknowingly, head tilted and blank stare
        complete.

        "Hmph. It is as I thought -- Listen to me, I am Keshon, do you
        know who you are?" Keshon said, looking intently at Endrek.

        "Endrek?"

        "Yes. I will try to explain this to you plainly; for some
        strange reason, a reason which you won't tell even to me, there
        are instances when your memory goes blank and for a period of
        days to weeks, even months. It eventually comes back, however,
        but I suggest that you do no more travelling this day."

        "But I must be somewhere."

        "Where? Do you even know where you are now?"

        "uhm," Endrek said, looking around the grungy, darkly-lit
        tavern, "no."

        "This is a fort in Sahr Padia, the southern forest region of
        Pehr Jrago," Keshon said while pulling out a map and showing it
        to Endrek, "we are here, see? You're lucky you found our fort
        before the brigands took you for hostage. Many people would pay
        good money to see you hanged in their town squares. By the way,
        Endrek, how long have you been like this? I mean, the running
        from the brigands and all?"

        "From what I can recall, I'd say just about the entirety of the
        day..."

        "Then I suggest you rest for the night, regain your strength
        <and hopefully some of your memory> and you and I both will set
        out upon the morrow. Can your quest be prolonged for yet another
        day?" said Keshon in a half-sarchastic tone.

        "ah, I suppose so." Even though Endrek had lost his memory, he
        hadn't lost many of his natural abilities: wit, speech, theory
        and the like.

           So that night Endrek joined Keshon for the night, and the
        next day they proceeded out into the forest. They got no farther
        than a few paces when Keshon stopped, looking out in all
        directions, and said to Endrek, "So, revive any of your lost
        memory yet? Do we know where we're going?"

           Endrek also looked out in all directions, seeing nothing of
        importance, and said to Keshon, "no, if I've remembered
        anything, it hasn't come back to me yet. Although I think I had
        planned to go North," extending his arm and pointing.

           "Ah, so North it is," Keshon said in a somewhat cheerful
        mood, or atleast a cheerful mood as far as the leader of a
        battalion could be, "I hope we find what we're looking for soon,
        I'm already getting hungry..."
