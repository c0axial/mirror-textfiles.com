        Well, I'm happy to announce that we've acutally made it to issue
        number 4, and I'm even happier to announce that alderAAn (Blade
        WHQ, and a whole lotta others) is now an official sOs distro
        site. I am also more than ecstatic to announce the arrival
        (finally) of sOs' creator and my mentor, Belial, to the world
        which is Serenia. He will be editing and hopefully writing,
        though we haven't gone over all complete details.

        Oh, also included with this issue of scrolls is Legends #1. This
        is the continuing story of the world of Serenia in the 2nd Age.
        These stories, (the main scrolls) are of the 1st Age (the
        creation, Serenia's first encounters with monumental evil, etc.)
        and there are a lot more things that are revealed about the
        world and, of course, what happened to the characters during the
        passing of the 1st Age to the coming of the 2nd Age.

        As of lately, I haven't been getting much of a reply as to what
        people think of sOs, and I've decided that if I don't get much
        of a reply soon, that I'll stop releasing scrolls, or I'll just
        let somebody else pick it up.

        Well, read and enjoy...

        |___|\___|ow, my dear Reyhan, I offer you a deal..." At this I
        looked back upon Danno with wicked eyes. "...and this deal is
        that I shall give the pentagram to you, <ahem> that is, given you
        defeat me in a swords-duel. Not a hard task for a `professional'
        such as yourself, now is it?" Danno said, holding back intense
        laughter with his wide grin.

        "Not at all, Danno." I said in return, holding my wicked thoughts
        back and drawing my sword.

        "Ha! Then let's be at it then!" Danno came charging forward
        drawing his sword. I backed up and almost tripped over T‰lk, who
        had pretty much planted himself at that spot since Danno had
        arrived.

        "MOVE!" I yelled at T‰lk as I tumbled out of Danno's sword-
        swing. T‰lk crawled slowly out of harm's way and began to watch
        the fight in what appeared to be pure disbelief.

        As of late, I hadn't been really paying attention the matter at
        hand, and when I did, and Danno had me down, I looked into his
        eyes and I saw, though as distant as it was, his fear. I tried
        to dig deeper, but all was pure fear buried. And so, as my
        current position called for, I went for his weakness...

        \__/\___/ hen I spoke, I seemed to be in a trance. I wasn't sure
        if I was actually speaking for myself, or if someone else was
        speaking for me. But when I did, I had no idea what I was saying
        until I heard it.

        "Danno, tell me about..." and Danno looked down at me, "Father."

        Danno looked down on me with frightful eyes. He was dumbfounded.
        "What? No! He couldn't know. Could he? How would he know?" These
        thoughts and many more flowed through his mind as he slowly
        backed away, I could see them in his eyes.

        I stood. I had control, yet I didn't. I knew what I was doing,
        but at the same time, I didn't. As I stood and walked towards
        Danno, he tripped over and scrambled frantically in place, there
        on the ground.

        In the background, Danno's men themselves slowly disappeared
        from the scene.

        I now stood over Danno, the image of power in this
        confronatation. I looked once more into Danno's eyes and saw his
        fright, and I said, "Danno, they say the eyes are the window of
        the soul. And since you have shown me yours, I open myself to
        you and show you mine..."

        And Danno looked up into my eyes, and became frozen. He went
        white with fear as all of my life, my horrid childhood, the
        death, the destruction, the terror, it all went, and he saw.

        |______| remember little of what happened after this new, eh,
        happening with Danno. I know I pocketed the pentagram and when I
        had turned around T‰lk was there, and he was quiet. We hadn't
        run into nor had we confronted any of Danno's brigands for the
        rest of the journey.

        For the first few hours after we left the clearing, T‰lk and I
        said nothing to each other. To tell you the truth, my mind was
        elsewhere. I had been wondering why all of these wierd things
        were happening to me.

        My life was simple, I hunted. Be it people or animal it didn't
        matter, but I was good at it. Then, all of a sudden, somebody
        sends me after some sorcerer, and I get a full-body tan that
        looks like I got a little too close to a volcano. I meet an
        angel, who saves my life, and gives me a gift of some sort, and
        then T‰lk almost dies and is saved by an angel, which completely
        changes him.

        My head hurt, and I had to rest. All of this, <ehem> magic or
        whatever was just too disturbing...

        A short recap of events...
        After my brief meeting with Geldrion in which much had been
        explained, I found myself back in the alley behind the bar
        (which I had previously been booted out of), surrounded by the
        Dark Sovereigns.

        The Dark Sovereigns are those followers of Neim, some evil guy
        that I am, no doubt, against. They are made of the shadows and
        dark sides of everything in this world, real pals of mine.
        yeah, really.

        They hunted me down, which wasn't that much of a hunt (well,
        cause I'm a drunk), because of some book that I got from an
        old guy in a dream?@#!

        Hmph. If yer not confused yet, you will be.
        <Damn sure know _I_ am.>

        Now...
        I am surrounded by shadows which are, by short contemplation,
        some of the Dark Sovereigns. Before I was zipped out to wherever
        by Geldrion and talked to, their "leader" (as if I could tell
        which one was the leader?) asked for the book.

        Out of the darkness, I could strain to hear them speak, "Do NoT
        pHeRe. gIVe uS tHE bOoK anD We SHalL spaRE YouR lIfE."

        I looked up, and then around, and said, "Would you take it the
        wrong way if I said, oh, I don-no, go to hell?"

        At this the shadows which stood, er, drifted, before me sat
        silent and I could hear low murmurs coming from their general
        direction.

        "wE fINd y0U NoTt aMmUSInG. WE wIlL dIspOsE 0f y0r LiFE n0W."

        "oh shit." Was about all I could say. I was surrounded by the
        shadows, and all I could think of was the book. Then, without
        thinking, I pointed my finger into the sky above and the most
        divine flare of light filled the alleyway, almost blinding
        myself and temporarily dispersing of the shadows.

        I ran out and from the alley, needless to say, as fast as I
        could, which, because of my drunken state wasn't very fast. I
        had to find somewhere to stay atleast for the remainder of the
        night.

        I was scared shitless and I had nowhere to go, cause, well, I
        was drunk and I wasn't from around here...

                                  ...
     ...find out who this guy is and everything else next issue...
