   1] Introduction 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
 
Welcome to fingal's cave. This is the first issue so here's what 
to expect: I don't know. That depends on what you cyber-loonies 
send me to put in this thing. Myself and my friends only have so 
many (interesting) things we can put in here. This first issue is 
totally consisting of things from myself and my friends. Please 
contribute for the next issue. We only have three guidelines:
 
1) You wrote what you are submitting. Don't rip someone else off.
 
2) It is under 5K or so.
 
3) It is interesting (at least to some people)
 
If you meet all these three, you may get into this thing. We're 
looking for: stories, jokes, poems, editorials, record reviews, 
gripes, and things we haven't even thought to include. Our goal 
is to produce a zine that anyone can at least find one or two 
things inside of interest.
 
I'm going to release this piece of electronic nonsense every 
month at or around the 15th onto alt.zines. I'm operating from a 
PC, so I don't have a FTP site. If someone would like to store it 
somewhere, go for it man.

   2] Bless me father                           by: Tommy Details
-----------------------------------------------------------------
 
(This is a poem about a friend of mine)
 
Bless Me Father
 
Bless me Father for I have told
You can read it in my deposition
People in your flock believe me now
Your congregation is slipping away
 
Bless me Father for I was sinned
My pain is deep and eternal
I was taught you could be trusted
But god's soldier is a devil
 
Forgive me father, for you're in trouble
The courts have your pious ass now
You said if I told I'd go to hell
If I do, I'll meet you there

   3] This Just In                                     by: Fingal
-----------------------------------------------------------------
 
This just in, the situation in the west has changed dramatically 
in the last 24 hours. What started out as a county fair in 
southern Oregon has erupted into civil war between Californians 
and Pacific Northwesterners. California is claiming it has taken 
the southern half of Oregon in retaliation for last night's raids 
on Beverly Hills. The state of Delaware has joined California and 
Arizona and declared themselves a nation called "California-
Arizona-Delaware". Meanwhile, Washington, Oregon, and now Idaho 
have declared themselves a nation, calling themselves 
"Washington, Oregon and now Idaho". The state of Nevada remains 
neutral so they can take bets on the wars. Texas has declared 
itself a nation also, because they always wanted to, and now 
seemed like a good time. New Mexico doesn't care. The East is 
relatively calm, but a possible conflict between Chicagoans and 
Milwaukeeans seems eminent. The President is urging people to 
stay at home to watch sitcoms and not join the conflicts. We'll 
be right back after a word from Kelloggs.

   4] Record Reviews                                   by: Fingal
-----------------------------------------------------------------
 
Here's my top five albums of 1993. I got to see four of the bands 
this year, which may or may not effect my choices.
 
1) Siamese Dream, Smashing Pumpkins.
It's not because I'm from Chicago. I didn't put Liz Phair in my 
top ten and Urge Overkill I didn't get into at all. Although I 
did like Styx a long time ago. The music is loud and soft, and 
the lyrics speak for any kid who was unpopular (doesn't everyone 
claim they were a misfit today?) The music is fresh.  The 
Pumpkins have built onto their previous album Gish with more 
production and clearer lyrics. If I had a vinyl copy, it would 
have to be replaced by now.
 
2) Become What You Are, Julianna Hatfield Three.
Julianna, formerly of the Blake Babies, is perhaps the most 
underrated female song writer today. Her songs are never simple 
pop songs, but tackle many subjects such as fear of death, 
supermodels, striking back at criminals, stardom, addiction, and 
the homeless. She gives a great concert and has a great attitude 
about music. She's going to be big.
 
3) In Utero, Nirvana
Nirvana has grown in this next album. Even without a "Teen 
Spirit", the songs show more diversity, in some cases by adding a 
cello. There is tenderness, but their is also killer guitars, 
feedback, and screaming. The lyrics speak more intelligently, 
from the perspective of fame. I like this album tons better than 
Pearl Jams' Vs.
 
4) self-titled Rage Against The Machine
I bought this CD strictly on a recommendation from Perry Farrel 
of Lollopoluza (if he even decides that sort of thing). This is 
an album with angry sounds, angry lyrics, and great combining of 
the two. It's kind of Red Hot Chili Peppers meets Rollins, which 
is why I like it so much. They give a no-nonsense live show 
filled with emotion.
 
5) self-titled The Muffs
Who? This is a quartet of two women and two men. The women were 
from The Pandoras. A friend was in the mood for a loud show at a 
small club, and the Muffs were in town. They killed the 
headliners (The Digits) with short pop/punk songs. The CD I 
bought the next day proved the Muffs have what it takes to 
deliver loud, fast, but melodic songs to a crowd.
 
Other of my favorites:
Undertow, Tool
Fontanello, Babes in Toyland
Debut, Bjork
Everyone Else is doing it, why can't we?, Cranberries
Vs, Pearl Jam
Exile in Guyville, Liz Phair

submissions, it will grow! Please send us your weird, funny,
