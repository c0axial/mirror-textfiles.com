Welcome
Copyright (c) 1994, Joe DeRouen
All rights reserved


Welcome to Sunlight Through The Shadows magazine! In this issue, as well
as in the future, STTS will strive to bring you the best in fiction,
poetry, reviews, article, and other assorted reading material.

STTS Magazine has no general "theme" aside from good writing, innovative
concepts, and the unique execution of those concepts.

STTS wouldn't have been possible without the aid, support, and guidance
of three women:

Inez Harrison, publisher of Poetry In Motion newsletter. Her's was the
first electronic magazine I ever laid eyes upon, and also the first such
magazine to publish my work. She's given me advice, and, more
importantly, inspiration.

Lucia Chambers, publisher of Smoke & Mirrors Elec. Magazine and head of
Pen & Brush Network. She gave me advice on running a magazine,
encouragement, and hints as to the kind of people to look for in
writers.

Heather DeRouen, my wife. Listed last here, but always first in my
heart. She's proofread manuscripts, inspired me, listened to me, and,
most importantly, loved me. Never could I find a better woman to live
life by my side, nor a better friend.

Now that that's said and done... Again, welcome to Sunlight Through The
Shadows Magazine! I hope you enjoy it.

Joe DeRouen
 
 
Editorial: Why This Is Late . . . Again
Copyright (c) 1994, Joe DeRouen
All rights reserved


I have a good reason this time.  I promise.  As of September first,
1994, I became a published (read: paid!) writer.  Furthermore, the piece
in question was the first installment in a new column.  But I digress.

In several areas of the USA, there are free monthly publications called
COMPUTER CURRENTS.  Dallas has one, and that's the magazine I'm writing
for.  Hopefully, if all you kind folks that are lucky enough to have a
local version of COMPUTER CURRENTS write in and ask for it, I'll go
national before too long.  <Grin>

The monthly column, ASK THE TECH: QUICK TIPS AND FIXES, is pretty
self-explanatory.  People write in with questions or problems they're
having or have had with computers, BBS's, or software, and I try to
solve them.  The article will also appear here each month, in the
monthly columns section.  Read it and let me know what you think!

I'm also doing a computer/BBS-orientated "Top-Ten List" for COMPUTER
CURRENTS.  Regular readers will know that such lists have been appearing
in these electronic pages all along.  The ones in CC will differ,
however, in the fact that they'll *always* be computer-related.  With
STTS, I'm able to do pretty much whatever strikes my fancy.  <G>

Anyway, that's why this issue is late.  I've been busy working on the
column and the top ten list, as well as other possible paid submissions.
I shan't forgo STTS, however.  With the recent addition of Shawn Aiken
as Assistant Editor (notice, Shawn - Your title gets Caps! <G>) things
should start going a bit more smoothly.  The next issue might even be
out on time.  Or closer, at least.

At any rate, that's my explanation.   Thanks for sticking with STTS and
making it one of the most popular e-mags out there!

  The Staff and Contributing Writers of Sunlight Through The Shadows
  ------------------------------------------------------------------



  The Staff
  ---------

  Joe DeRouen............................Publisher and Editor
  L. Shawn Aiken.........................Assistant Editor   

  Heather DeRouen........................Book Reviews
  Bruce Diamond..........................Movie Reviews
  Tamara.................................House Poet


  Joe DeRouen publishes, edits, and writes for STTS magazine. He's had
  poetry and fiction published in several on-line magazines and a few
  paper publications as well. He's written exactly 1.5 novels, none of
  which, alas, have seen the light of publication. He attends college
  part-time in search of that always-elusive english degree. In his
  spare time, he enjoys reading, running his BBS, collecting music,
  playing with his five cats, singing opera, hunting pseudopods, and
  most importantly spending time with his beautiful wife Heather.

  L. Shawn Aiken dropped out of college when he realized that they  
  couldn't teach him the two things he wanted to do; live successfully,
  and write.  He had to find out these things all by himself on the
  road.  Thus he became a road scholar.  After spending his life hopping
  country to country, state to state, he now feels confident in his
  abilities and is working on his literary career.  His main endevour is
  to become successful in the speculative fiction area, but he enjoys
  writing all forms of literary art.

  Heather DeRouen writes software for the healthcare industry, CoSysOps
  Sunlight Through The Shadows BBS, enjoys playing with her five cats,
  cross-stitching, and reading. Most of all, she enjoys spending time
  with her dapper, charming, witty, and handsome (not to mention modest)
  husband Joe. Heather's help towards editing and proofreading this
  magazine has been immeasurable.

  Bruce Diamond, part-time pseudopod and ruler of a small island chain
  off the coast of Chil, spends his time imitating desk lamps when he
  isn't watching and critiquing movies for LIGHTS OUT, his BBS movie
  review publication (now syndicated to over 20 boards).  Recently,
  Bruce became the monthly movie critic for VALLEY REVIEW MAGAZINE,
  published out of Pennsylvania.  LIGHTS OUT, now two years old, is
  available through the Rime or P&B Networks by dropping a note to
  Joe DeRouen, courtesy of Sunlight Through The Shadows BBS.  The
  magazine will soon be available through Fido file request and
  Internet FTP.  In the Dallas area, Bruce's distributor is Jay
  Gaines' BBS AMERICA (214-994-0093).  Bruce is a freelance writer
  and video producer in the Dallas/Fort Worth area.

  There is very little known about Tamara, and she prefers to let it
  remain that way. She's a woman of mystery and prefers to remain hidden
  in the shadows of the BBS world. (Enigmatic, don't you think?)


  Contributing Writers
  --------------------

  Ed Davis...............................Fiction
  Sean A. Donahue........................Poetry
  J. Guenther............................Poetry
  Daniel Sendecki........................Fiction, Poetry
  Andee SoRelle..........................Music Review
  Louis Turbeville.......................Software Reviews
  Thomas Van Hook........................My View, Music Review


  Ed Davis has been scribbling seriously or has at least enjoyed the
  electronic equivalent, since 1981. Prior to that, his literary efforts
  were confined to whatever scrap paper he could find on a work bench at
  break or lunch time, since he was spending his working hours making
  chips and money in the guise of a Journeyman Machinist.  Married to
  the same lady for 26 years and with two children still hovering
  uncomfortably close to the nest, Ed continues to write down his
  thoughts electronically. Check out the file NEWBOOK.ZIP, available
  from STTS BBS, for more of his work.

  Sean A. Donahue does not have any publishing ties whatsoever.  He has
  written over 4,192 poems.  Only 38 have seen to survive the Mighty
  Morphin Power Rangers.  The time in which normal people say is spare,
  he tries to use to study for school at Texas Tech University.  This is
  Sean's first published poem and he hopes that it is not his last.  He
  has written exactly 428 novels all starting with "It was a dark and
  stormy night."  None ofthem have gotten past the second paragraph.  In
  whatever time he has left, he enjoys reading, riting, and rithmatic. 
  He has an creative writing minor, a history minor, and a Honorary
  Doctorate in B.S. from Bowling Green State University.  He dedicates
  his writing to those who are without love and hope.  And that's no
  B.S. 

  Grant Guenther, sometimes known as J. Guenther, confesses to be from a
  long-lost Martian colony, but in-depth investigations reveals that he
  was born and raised in a small but well-to-do community called
  Hartland in Wisconsin.  A senior, he has written several collections
  of poems, and won many awards from his high school literary magazine,
  including 1st place for poetry and short-short fiction.  He is the
  editor-in-chief of the school newspaper and writes as a humor
  columnist (or at least he thinks so).

  Daniel Sendecki is a young, emerging, Canadian writer who lives 
  in Burlington, Ontario.  Currently, Daniel is pursuing his writing 
  interests at home but intends to study literature at McGill 
  University, in Montreal, Quebec.  

  Andee SoRelle is a visual artist working in both paint and clay.
  She lives in the Dallas, Texas area and enjoys BBSing, (of course!)
  music, film, and kvetching about her day job.

  Louis Turbeville currently works as a computer analyst for the Air  
  Force.  He's originally from Hawaii (about an 1/8 Hawaiian <everyone
  seems to ask>) and has a BBA in Management Information Systems from the
  University of Hawaii.  Louis is married and has a two year old son who
  keeps him busy, especially when he wants to sit at the computer and
  write.  His interest in writing was nurtured by his wife, a journalism
  and english major who's yet to be published and holds this very much
  against Louis. <G>  He's had a couple of reviews published on
  WindowsOnLine Review Magazine and hopes to broaden his base of published
  media in the near future. 

  Author Unknown (oddly enough, his real name) has had several stories,
  poems, novels, plays, and pieces of artwork published throughout the
  world dating back to the dawn of man. So far, he hasn't received one
  red cent in royalties. 

  Thomas Van Hook resides in Dallas, where he works as a contract
  employee for the Federal Reserve Automation Services.  Having served
  eight years in the USAF, he is happy to finally be free and able to
  pursue the dreams of his heart.  At the age of 29, he is looking
  forward to many new adventures and experiences within the realms of
  the Elven kind.  He enjoys reading, writing, sports of all kinds, his
  son Corey and the attentions of any Elven women that seem interested
  (not necessarily in that order).  Recently divorced, he is trying to
  restore order and balance to his life without losing what little is
  left of his sanity.

Hi Joe,
 
Just DLd SUN9407.ZIP and found myself stunned.
 
I really don't know what to say - I've only tried to write this note a 
dozen times.
 
First place in Fiction.
 
Thank you very much. I'm honored. This is the first piece of work I've 
ever been paid for. I'm really overwhelmed and I don't know what else to 
say.
 
Thank you very much. You have no idea what this means to me. I hope 
you're not too big for me the next time I have something to submit.

QUICK TIPS AND FIXES
by Joe DeRouen


Q: I'd love to take a ride on the Information Superhighway, but I'm not
   even sure how to hitchhike!  Where do I get started? 

A: There's been so much coverage of the Internet in the last year that
   it would seem that it's the easiest thing in the world to get
   involved in.  It's not.  The Internet's backbone is the UNIX system,
   which features commands more arcane than DOS could ever be. 

   Until a universal graphic user interface is developed for access into
   the Internet, it's going to remain a great and challenging learning
   experience.  The challenge can be met, however. 

   If you're currently on local bulletin board systems, log onto your
   favorite one.  Go into the file area and do a text search for the
   word "Internet".  Chances are, they'll have at least one Internet
   help file.  Files in particular to keep an eye out for are THE 
   BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO THE INTERNET (an excellent guide to getting
   started) or ZEN AND THE ART OF THE INTERNET.  They're free programs
   and well worth the download time. 

   If you don't have access to a modem, check out your local bookstore
   or library.  You'll have several dozen different books to choose from
   in helping you access the Internet.  A couple of good ones are THE
   INTERNET FOR DUMMIES (John Levine and Carol Baroudi, IDG Books) and
   TEACH YOURSELF THE INTERNET - AROUND THE WORLD IN 21 DAYS. (Neil
   Randall, Sams Publishing)  Either book can be had for around twenty
   dollars.  

   With a little patience and a bit of intestinal fortitude, you'll be
   cruising the Net's highways and byways in no time! 


Q: Help!  I just erased my AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS, and now I can't
   get anything to come up.  What should I do? 

A: When your computer can't find those two files, it boots up, asks you
   for the date and time, and drops you into C:\.  What next?  Fear not,
   for all is not lost.  Actually, you've lost very little.  Those two
   files just tell your computer how to act. 

   Type PATH=C:\DOS. (If your DOS directory isn't on C, substitute the
   correct drive instead)  Then type UNDELETE.  As DOS's UNDELETE
   program scrolls through the erased files, look for ?UTOEXEC.BAT and
   ?ONFIG.SYS.  It'll ask you to supply the first character of each
   filename.  Do so, and it's like it never happened. 

   If you're using an older version of DOS that doesn't support UNDELETE
   (and you don't have NORTON UTILITIES, PC TOOLS, or another program
   that offers an UNERASE option) your files are pretty much lost
   forever.  There's nothing much left to do now except rebuild the
   files from memory. 

   To safeguard against this happening in the future, (even if you DO
   have UNDELETE - The program isn't failsafe!) always keep a current
   copy of your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS on a write-protected floppy,
   in a safe place.  That way, you'll always have a backup of your files
   and a permanent solution to the delete-happy frenzy that we all 
   occasionally fall prey to.  

   To be even safer, make a paper copy of the two files.  Fold them into
   an envelope and toss them in your desk drawer.  You'll probably never
   need them, but you'll be thankful that they're there if you ever do. 


Q: My Super VGA monitor is developing a rash!  This "rash" consists of
   blurs and distortions in the screen that seem to change and move
   around as time passes.  What's the problem? 

A: It could be a variety of different things.  The most probable
   culprit, however, is your phone.  If you're like me, you love to talk
   while you're playing games or entering data.  If you have a full-size
   phone with a large metal base, it most likely contains magnets that
   aren't very well shielded.  Placing a full-size phone closer than
   about a foot in front of the monitor can cause problems. 

   The magnets in the phone cause the phosphor (which make up the pixels
   in the screen) to glow differently than the rest of the screen.  It's
   nothing too serious, though.  Just move your phone or replace it with
   a smaller model, preferably a handheld unit.  
 
   All phones contain magnets, of course, but smaller phones contains
   smaller magnets that really aren't as harmful to your screen.  Newer
   phones also have better shielding. 

   The damage to your screen isn't permanent and should clear up fairly
   soon.  If it doesn't, you'll have to have your monitor "de-gaussed".
   (a procedure that involves running a very large magnet over your
   monitor) De-gaussing is relatively inexpensive and can be done at
   most any computer repair shop or service. 

   If your phone *doesn't* seem to be the problem, it could be another
   magnetic source.  Check out any large, bulky appliances that happen
   to be hanging around your monitor. 

   If it's obvious that isn't the source of your frustrations, contact
   the manufacturer of your monitor immediately.  More than likely, you
   have a defective screen that's probably still covered in your
   warranty.

As you read this, Major League Baseball will probably be in or near the third 
week of the Players' Strike.  It's really interesting to note that fan apathy 
towards either side is at an all-time high.  My prediction, however, is that 
the fans that are disgusted with the actions of both players and owners will 
come back to the Major League ballparks in droves when the season resumes.  
Like the fans of past strikes, today's fans are angry over escalating 
salaries, and like the fans of yester-year, their memories will be short and 
forgiving when the strike is over.  If the fans of today would make a stand 
over the escalating prices of ballpark seats and escalating player salaries, 
then maybe the owners and players would realize that they have it better 
financially than most of their fans do.

Football is upon us.  Preseason is coming to end as I write this, and the 
season's beginning is right around the corner.  There will be many surprises 
along the way, but I have my own predictions to give to you.  We start with 
the NFC East:

NFC East
1.  Dallas
2.  Washington
3.  New York Giants
4.  Philadelphia
5.  Arizona

Dallas will once again storm to the top of the conference on the arm of Aikman
 and the legs of Smith.  Their defense is somewhat suspect in the linebacking 
corps, which will sink them in the end.  Washington will hold second on the 
strength of their BIG (!) offensive line.  Otherwise their entire team is 
suspect after this.  The New York Giants will rise to third solely on the 
backs of their defense.  The offense is a bit suspect with a starting rookie 
quarterback.  Philadelphia will find it will be very difficult to ask Randall 
Cunningham to win it all for them.  Arizona is on the track with Buddy Ryan, 
but this won't be their year.

NFC Central
1.  Detriot
2.  Chicago
3.  Tampa Bay
4.  Minnesota
5.  Green Bay

Detriot will barely take this conference away from the Monsters of the Midway 
in Chicago.  However, Barry Sanders will show that he is on the last years of 
his career.  Tampa Bay will be somewhat of a surprise, but they still need to 
let their entire offense loose during the game.  Even Warren Moon won't help 
Minnesota, which can thank Green Bay for the cellar cushion.  Green Bay had 
better pack it in, their offense has trouble even remembering where the ball 
is.

NFC West
1.  Atlanta
2.  New Orleans
3.  Los Angeles Rams
4.  San Fransisco

Welcome Atlanta Falcons, you have finally arrived!  The Falcons will be the 
most improved team in the NFL this year.  Get ready folks, because they will 
be going to the Big Dance before this decade is out.  New Orleans made some 
good off-season moves and is stronger than ever.  It's a shame that they have 
to play in the same division as Atlanta.  The Rams look better than they have 
for the past few years.  The 49ers have finally hit rock bottom.  It's hard to
 win games when your team is saturated with egos.

AFC East
1.  Buffalo
2.  Miami
3.  New England
4.  Indianapolis
5.  New York Jets

Buffalo fields a strong team, but they will have trouble taking their division
 over a much-improved Miami Dolphins team.  Look for a full-season battle for 
the top spot here.  New England looks better and better, but they have to play
 both Buffalo and Miami twice this year.  Indianapolis continues to look like 
one of the three blind mice.  The Jets are a plane without an engine.

AFC Central
1.  Houston
2.  Cleveland
3.  Pittsburgh
4.  Cincinnati

Houston finally comes into it's own with Cody Carlson at the helm, but just 
barely.  Cleveland and Pittsburgh will turn this division into the most hotly 
contested division all year.  Cincinnati hasn't got a prayer of making it this
 year.  They are just happy that there is a New York Jets team to look worse 
than they do.

AFC West
1.  Los Angeles Raiders
2.  Denver
3.  Kansas City
4.  Seattle
5.  San Diego

And here is my pick for the Super Bowl Champion:  Los Angeles Raiders.  The 
Raiders look like they have finally put it all together.  Denver finally got 
some recievers for Elway, but their defense looks really thin this year.  
Kansas City is resting it's hopes on has-beens Montana and Allen -- a bad 
move.  Seattle will improve, while San Diego joins their Major League Baseball
 brethren in the basement.

Will Dallas make it to a third straight Super Sunday?  Sure.  And they will 
find that two championships will be all they can have.  The Raiders are my 
pick to take it all this year.

Next month:  A look at what we might have enjoyed during September in the 
world of Baseball, and a quick peek at the world of Basketball.  Ciao!


NFC Champion - Dallas Cowboys
AFC Champion - Oakland Raiders
Super Bowl Winner - Oakland Raiders

 issue]



As of this writing, Major League Baseball is poised on the edge of it's
most exciting "second-half" in quite some time.  The realignment that
took place during the winter has added to the excitement of the
potential division races.  Not one single team is running away with
their division at this point in the season. 

In the meantime, Ken Griffey Jr., Frank Thomas and Matt Williams have
very good chances of breaking Roger Maris' single-season home-run
record.  Frank Thomas also has a real chance to become the first
Triple-Crown winner in quite some time.  Attendance at most major league
parks is on pace to break last year's marks.  Yes indeed, MLB is looking
at a summer that could be talked about for years to come. 

Despite all the excitement of record-runs, increased attendance and
potential playoff races, baseball fans see the dark cloud of the
players' strike on the horizon for this season.  It's really nothing
new.  Strikes have been fairly common place since the late 70s within
baseball ('72, '73, '76, '80, '81, '85  and '90). 

The Players' Union, which has made quite a few advances in how players
have been treated since the inception of the game, has basically come to
"loggerheads" with the owners over the issue of a salary-cap. 

This salary cap is designed to keep to keep the owners within a set
level of spending concerning player's salaries.  If this is agreed to,
the current system of arbitration will be obsolete.  The players will no
longer be able to have their salaries raised to the astronomical levels
we have witnessed since the 1990 free agent signings. 

The basic point here is that the owners stand to lose very little under
this proposed system, while the players stand to lose billions of
potential dollars.  The game, however, stands to gain a lot through this
system. 

Under the newest round of expansion, the current talent pool of players
has been dilued even further.  The teams that can afford the "big" stars
are loading their teams up with such "gate-drawing" superstars.  Teams
located in the smaller markets can't gain these superstars to effect
their turnstile counts. 

Under the new system that is proposed by the owners, these smaller teams
will have a better chance to afford and obtain these stars for their
lineups.  This should provide boosts for their turnstile counts and for
their team's on-field play. 

A strike will hurt quite a few people.  For instance, some cities depend
heavily on the revenue and taxes that the stadiums bring into their
budgets.  Average citizens employed for the season by the stadiums as
vendors, merchandisers and the such, will see their pocketbooks
experience a drought in times where everyone is feeling the financial
"pinch."  

The owners will be slightly hurt since the revenue of their team won't
be coming in on a regular basis, but most of the owners are financially
independent through other means. The players are working from guarenteed
contracts, and will make most of their contractual monies where they
play or not.  

The young fans will experience a let-down as their idols (most notably
the three mentioned above that are chasing basbeball history) are sent
packing before the season draws to a close.  And lastly, MLB itself will
be hurt as scores of fans (most who remember the strikes of the past)
leave MLB for other sports such as Football and Basketball. 

Fans believe that they are powerless to influence players and owners in
such issues as salaries and the such.  But they are wrong.  Fans have a
lot of influence on the game.  Fans pay the sharply escalating prices of
tickets.  Fans are the ones that drop the dollar into the pockets' of
the players and owners.  In today's game of baseball, the ALMIGHTY
dollar speaks very loudly. 

If fans would refuse to pay the high prices at the games, the players
and owners might be able to see what ails baseball.  If the Owners and
the Players' Union can resolve their differences and avert a strike,
remains to be seen.  However, if a strike takes place, the long-term
effects on MLB could possibly be as devastating as the 1919 Black Sox
scandal. 

That scandal almost sunk baseball, except that a savior named Herman
"The Babe" Ruth arrived on the scene and brought back the excitement
missing from the game.  I'm not too sure that the greed of the players
and owners is going to find such a savior this time around.

Mars, the Face, and the Bulletin Board: 
An interview with Elizabeth Orne
Copyright (c) 1994, L. Shawn Aiken
All rights reserved



        Elizabeth Orne is a programmer who runs THE MARS INFORMATION
EXCHANGE, a Dallas based computer bulletin board system that is 
devoted to information related to interesting new discoveries about 
Mars and other anomalies found throughout the solar system.  While 
interviewing her on the night of August 12th over her BBS, we began to
discuss governmental interference in the acquisition of data.  
Suddenly the electricity went off at my home and I lost the entire 
interview.  Luckily Ms. Orne had been keeping her own log of the chat.
I don't REALLY think that the government had anything to do with it, 
but you never know . . .

STTS:  What were the demons that drove you into the world of BBSes?

MS. ORNE:  Well, that's an interesting question.  Two years ago I
decided to start a BBS to support my software users.  <Ms. Orne writes 
software for bankruptcy lawyers.>  So I set it up and ran that for around 
a year.  It was about that time that I realized that none of my clients 
ever called because most didn't know how to use a modem, and others 
preferred that I come to their office to install updates for them.  

STTS:  What made you decide to set up THE MARS INFORMATION EXCHANGE? 

MS. ORNE:  About that time I picked up a copy of The Monuments of Mars by 
Dick Hoagland.  I had seen the book a couple of years previously but, for 
some reason it didn't really catch my attention.  Anyway, reading the book 
was fascinating and I decided that I would log on few BBSes and see if there 
was any information out there about the really interesting propositions that 
Dick was making.  I was amazed to discover that there was almost nothing 
available.  Well, since I was getting ready to shut down the BBS that I 
was running for my business, and in light of my new interest in Mars and 
Cydonia, The Mars Information Exchange was born.  

STTS:  Where do you get your information for TMIE?

MS. ORNE:  I scoured BBSes everywhere across America for data.  In fact, I 
still do make regular 'bomb runs' on numerous BBSes <G>.  The artifact 
questions regarding Mars are of such singular importance that I really feel 
that there is a large need for a central data base on the subject.   
Also, at the time that I started TMIE, the Mars Observer was 3 or 4 months 
out from Mars and according to Dick Hoagland and others it seemed that the 
questions revolving around Cydonia where going to be answered in just a few 
short months.  Those days and weeks of waiting were filled with anxiety.  I 
remember the heart sinking feeling that I suffered when the Mars Observer 
failed.  It wasn't long after that that the Cydonia issue began to wane a 
bit.  It's really hard to keep specific subjects in the public eye.  But, we 
are going back to Mars in a couple of years and TMIE will still be here 
collecting info and ready to distribute the answers to the questions posed 
by Cydonia when the data finally arrives.

STTS:  What specific parts of Hoagland's book caught your attention?

MS. ORNE:  The Monuments of Mars by Dick Hoagland draws attention to a very 
small region of Mars where Viking (this was a mission sent to Mars in the 
70's) photos seemed to show pictures of a face and, what appears to be 
intelligently constructed structures, just adjacent to the image of the 
face.  These photos have been scrutinized in great detail by many researchers 
and, of course, this has resulted in two camps of scientist - those who think 
that it's all a simple illusion created by lighting and those who think that 
there is either something there or feel that these enigmatic objects are at 
least worth re-photographing in greater detail.  The photos taken by Viking 
were of insufficient resolution to allow for any conclusions regarding their 
origin.  In recent years there has been a lot of work put forth by workers 
such as Erol Torun who ascribe all kinds of mathematical relationships to 
the structures seen in the Viking photos.  But for me, at least, the most 
compelling evidence are the photos themselves.  The photos beckon an 
immediate sense of recognition, a kind of gestalt.  They seem to be saying 
"Look here!  These structures are artificial."  So I guess in answer to your 
question, the most interesting portion of Dick's book were in fact the Viking 
images themselves.  

STTS:  Can you describe these structures and explain why they are believed 
to be artificial?

MS. ORNE:  Yes, I can.  The structure that first catches one's eye, and in 
fact was the first object to catch Dick Hoagland's eye, is the face itself.  
Right there in the middle of the Cydonian plain a huge stone (one presumes it 
is made of stone or other hard substance) face stares out into space.  It's 
symmetry is striking.  The fact that the face is apparently human creates 
a great number of questions regarding previous notions about our origins.  
Several kilometers to the west of the face are structures that look to be 
pyramids and the remains of other artificial structures.  I think the 
most compelling aspect of the Cydonia region is that all of the 
interesting features are all within a few kilometers of each other.  You 
can look at hundreds of images of Mars and find no evidence of anything 
remotely artificial looking but, when you look at the Cydonia Plain there 
are artificial looking structures littered all over the landscape.  One of 
the structures (which has been coined "The Fort") looks like a pyramid 
with a portion of the top collapsed and you can actually look down inside 
it.

STTS:  Scientists in the 70's noticed those pyramids and said that they were 
simply sand dunes formed by the wind.  Has there been a concentrated effort 
by scientists to explain away all of these features through natural means?

MS. ORNE:  Yes, NASA, for the first several years, stood firmly on the 
opinion that the structures where entirely natural, regardless of mounting 
evidence to the contrary.  I think that I should point out here that although 
the photos are compelling for many, very view individuals take these photos 
as proof, but rather a case for a return imaging mission to clear up the 
mystery.  In any case, NASA has actually been caught in the act of 
obstructing information regarding internal views of the Cydonia region when 
a memo was found circulating in NASA which instructed employees to hinder 
requests, change text in documents etc. with regard to the Cydonia question.  
They have since retracted (publicly at least) these directives.  Dr. 
McDaniel of Sanoma State University has written an excellent treatment of the 
history of NASA's views and their methodology regarding the Cydonian 
question. 

STTS:  Is this obstructionist memo available to the public?

MS. ORNE:  I knew that you were going to ask that and yes, I am sure that it 
is but, off the top of my head I don't think that I can provide a means of 
obtaining it.  I'd have to go back through my own reading material and 
locate some reference's to the Document.  I am sure that Dick Hoagland's 
organization "The Mars Mission" would be more than happy to provide 
instructions in obtaining the aforementioned document<s>.

STTS:  Your board has a summary of a book called The McDaniel Report in
the files section, a report that goes over inconsistencies in governmental
actions on this subject.  Does that book discuss this memo?

MS. ORNE:  I am pretty sure that it does.  The book entitled simply 
"The McDaniel Report" is published by North Atlantic Books and went into 
general distribution 2 months ago (that would be early June 1994).  There is 
a very interest summary of the book available on this BBS.  I think that 
McDaniel presents many valid arguments.

STTS:  Okay.  I want to get to those arguments soon, but if you don't mind 
if we venture back to Mars for a sec.<G>  What was it about the book 
(Hoagland's) that, so to speak, 'pushed you over the edge?"  What data 
finally convinced you that there may be something to all of this?

MS. ORNE:  This may sound naieve (oh boy i can't spell)  but, the Q³i²Y

****** BEGIN CHAT on Aug-12-94 at 23:23:28 with Shawn Aiken ******

MS. ORNE:  It's really funny but although I really don't think that the FEDS 
are watching I've had all kinds of strange things happen here since I 
started the Mars Board.

STTS:  What kind of strange things have happened?

MS. ORNE:  Well, my phones beep a couple of times a day.  I get line noise 
on this machine and my other machine at the most inopportune moments.  
Sometimes I even get beeps while I'm talking on the phone (not the calling 
waiting kind either).  I really, think it is coincidence but, other theories 
have crossed my mind.<G>  Anyway, your last question was back to the 
Monuments book and what part was really most interesting.

STTS:  Oh yes.  Interesting to you.  The stuff that 'pushed you over the 
edge'.<G>

MS. ORNE:  I don't want to sound naive but, the most compelling portions of 
the book really were the images.  Dick presents a lot of very interesting 
ideas regarding geometric associations and such but, I'm always suspicious of 
such relationships.  He may well turn out to be correct but, the images 
themselves still seem to speak the loudest.  He also attempts to draw 
parallels to Egypt and the pyramids there, with emphasis on the Sphinx.

STTS:  Exactly what parallels?

MS. ORNE:  Well, the one point that most impressed me was that Cairo actually 
means MARS.

STTS:  Is there any geometrical relationship between the two he could find?

MS. ORNE:  Actually, as I recall there were.  Off the top of my head I can't 
remember exactly what they were.  Again, I wasn't as impressed with the 
mathematical relationships as many others have been.  I guess, it's just to 
easy to read such relationships into things where no such actual 
relationships exist.  I really would like to say however, that Dick and Erol 
may very well be right, I'm just not, at the moment, very impressed with the 
data.

STTS: Have you spoken to Richard Hoagland?

MS. ORNE:  I spoke with Dick several months ago and I got the impression 
that at that time he was expending his energy in uncovering Government 
collusion regarding the failure of the Mars Observer.  Dick feels, and I 
also believe, that it's a bit suspicious that the MARS Observer failed.  
Building these machines is something that the US is really good at.  And 
apparently NASA turned off the radios prior to an important maneuver which 
is absolutely against all of the previously defined procedures.   The radios 
provide all kinds of information to ground controlers if something goes wrong 
even in the event that the satellite blows up the radio data (if you leave 
them on) provides detailed information about what went wrong.   The whole 
affair is rather mysterious.

STTS:  Was this what sparked the McDaniel Report?

MS. ORNE:  Actually, the McDaniel report was already in the works at the   
time of the MARS Observer's failure.  The McDaniel report was spurred by   
NASA's adamant refusal to spend any effort in re-imaging the Cydonia site.  
It was only  Dick Hoagland's hard work talking to NASA and congress that   
swayed NASA's stance on the matter.                                        

STTS:  So NASA had decided to re-image the site?

MS. ORNE:  Yes, but with one major flaw.  NASA signed a contract with a 
group headed by Malin (the builder of the on board hi-res camera).  Malin 
had complete authority with regard to what images would be released, and    
could keep images to himself for up to 6 months before releasing them.     
There was a lot of fear going around that Malin would doctor the images    
prior to release.  This is the first time ever that a contractor was given 
such latitude with NASA imaging.

STTS:  Is NASA in the habit of contracting out image processing? 

MS. ORNE:  No, not until the contract with Malin and the MARS Observer     
program.  It really appeared, and still does, that this was an             
attempt by NASA to move the information into private hands so that no one  
could make any demands regarding the disposition of the imaging.  If NASA  
kept the imaging in house then we could always force their hand.  NASA is,  
after all, solely owned by the American people - Malin's group is not.       

STTS:  Has there been any other attempt to control the information coming 
from space exploration?

MS. ORNE:  Never before.  Recently, and this is another story, the military 
re-imaged the MOON with the satellite Clementine.  They have been hoarding 
that information but, the military is really a different story.  Although, I 
can't imagine what's classified about the Moon.

STTS:  Which leads me into the area of the Moon and what has recently been 
being talked about on your board.  What is going on?

MS. ORNE:  Well, several months ago Dick Hoagland released some old Apollo 
and Surveyor (not sure of all of the various missions that were involved) 
photos taken back in the 60's.  As in turns out there are a lot of very 
interesting pictures to be found including some depicting spires several 
miles high and what appear to be great structures in the Mare Crisium       
region and around Ukert crater.  A Dr. Coronet has examined the photos and 
feels that these may represent artifacts perhaps 500 million years old or 
older.  Some of these images were of excellent quality but were listed as 
blurred in the NASA imaging catalogs.  This brings the whole NASA 
withholding data argument back up again.  About the time that this was 
going on the military sent a satellite to the Moon called Clementine.  It 
was equipped with very high resolution cameras and the mission was 
essentially classified.  Well, I guess the question that comes to my mind 
is why would the military want to re-image the moon (with high-res 
equipment) and why would they want that data classified.  After all the 
moon is probably one of the most imaged objects in the solar system 
besides the Earth itself.

STTS:  People have been looking at the moon for centuries with telescopes.  
We've had countless images made of the moon by probes in the last two or 
three decades.  How could 'mile high' structures have been missed?

MS. ORNE:  Well, actually at least some of these structures have been 
reported on and off for quite awhile.  They all fall under the category of  
LTP's (Lunar Transient Phenomena).  There have been large numbers of         
reports of such things from ground based telescopes for quite some time.  
Here again with regard to the satellite based NASA imaging.  How come all 
the interesting photos were cataloged as blurred but, when ordered you find 
that in fact the images are quite clear.  Some are again questioning whether 
NASA had noticed the anomalies a long time ago but, were attempting to make 
the images appear disinteresting by placing misinformation in the catalogs.  
In fact many of the images, if you order them from NASA, will come with a   
note indicating that due to a NEW process the photo's may be blurred.

STTS:  If any of this is true, it would be apparent that something existed 
that should AT LEAST be looked into.  Why is there no interest in this from 
'respected' circles?

MS. ORNE:  The McDaniel report actually addresses that issue.  The simple 
fact is that if, as a scientist, you suggest the idea that there may be 
artificial structures on the Moon or on Mars you're immediately labeled a 
nut.  This is done without any review of data.  It's a knee-jerk reaction and 
one that has only been around for the last 50 years or so.                  
Before that it was considered OK to speculate about such things without 
worrying about such behavior from your associates.  It's clearly not science 
but something that has become a part of the scientific culture - almost a 
kind of belief system that ignores certain things without regard for data.  
Some ideas are just not received well these days.

STTS:  Are the people involved with this (Hoagland, Cornet, Torun, and 
McDaniel) merely amateurs, or do they have scientific training?

MS. ORNE:  Hoagland has an impression background as a science journalist and 
has worked as an advisor for the major networks during the Apollo era.  
Cornet is a PH.D. (I believe in geology although I could be wrong). Erol 
Torun works for the US Mapping agency and has a lot of experience with 
working with aerial photographs and McDaniel is also a PH.D.  There are 
also many others both inside and outside of NASA who support Dick Hoagland's
Mars Mission.

STTS:  What is the purpose of THE MARS INFORMATION EXCHANGE?

MS. ORNE:  The mission of The Mars Information Exchange, and now it's sister 
board on IOS (International On-line Service) is to provide a place to both 
collect and disseminate information regarding apparent artifacts on other 
planetary bodies and where applicable there relationship to the Earth.  I 
really feel strongly that a central source is needed rather than the 
previously haphazard way the data was stored in bits and pieces on other    
boards throughout America.  The implications of the data, if it turns out to 
be true, could change our most fundamental concepts about our origins and who 
we are.  The board in it's small why is my contribution to the further 
pursuit of this information.

STTS:  Does your board go beyond this scope?

MS. ORNE:  Actually, I hadn't intended it to - but yes, it has.  There seems 
to be, albeit a tenuous, connection between the UFO phenomena and           
interest in artifacts on neighboring planetary bodies.  I had so many       
requests for information regarding ufos that I started carrying a section 
devoted to that as well.  Along the lines of diversity, I also have plans to 
add CD-ROMs to the system which will contain all of the original Viking 
imaging.  There really is a need to go back over all those hundreds of images 
to see if there are other anomalous areas on Mars.  I would also like to 
obtain some CDs of lunar imaging but, I'm not sure if such an animal is 
currently available.  Dick Hoagland has indicated (in a conversation we 
had last week) that he may begin placing information updates on Frontier 
II, the TMIE sister board on IOS along with the ability to order photos, 
videos and audio tapes..  I'm keeping my fingers crossed.                          

STTS:  What are IOS and Frontier II? 

MS. ORNE:  Frontier II is the next logical step for the Mars Information 
Exchange.  To date, everyone (who didn't live in Dallas) had to call long 
distance to get on the board.  Now, by calling the International On-line 
Service, or IOS, people can reach the board with a local call.  There is fee 
for using IOS, but it's less than the long distance charges.  This will be 
mean a wider availability of information to a lot more people.

STTS:  Is Frontier II a separate BBS located on IOS that is managed 
by you?

MS. ORNE:  Yes, exactly.  Frontier II is located within the IOS system which 
is located in Downtown Dallas.  I manage all of the resources etc. remotely.  
I changed the name from The Mars Information Exchange to Frontier II to 
better reflect the expanded information (i.e., the Moon etc...)...

STTS:  What sorts of files do you keep on the systems?

MS. ORNE:  I'm going to make every attempt to keep the same files on both 
systems.  At the moment there are sections pertaining to Mars, The Moon and 
ufos with various sub grouping inside each of the categories.  There isn't a 
lot of information simply because there isn't much information to be found, 
but what is there is the most comprehensive collection of files on Mars or 
the Moon that I'm aware of on any single system.                            

STTS:  What types of files do you have in these sections?

MS. ORNE:  There are assorted image files of almost all of the anomalous 
features currently under discussion.  These image files are mostly GIF files 
but, there are also some JPG's and PCX files.  There are also some viewers 
available for those who don't already have the software for looking at the 
images.  In addition to image files there are many text files which 
contain information, conversations and theories regarding all of the 
anomalies.  Some programs can also be found, for example there is an        
excellent program for learning more about the Moon.  There are also 
demonstration programs of my own software that I write for attorneys who 
practice bankruptcy.  This is what I do to pay the rent.  The Mars 
Information is strictly a public service that I feel strongly about.

STTS:  What sorts of message bases do you have?

MS. ORNE:  There are a variety of specialized message areas.  Of course the 
full range of pertinent FIDO areas are available, these include messages 
areas about UFOS, Fringe science and the like.  There are also numerous 
local message areas (these messages stay on this board only) regarding the 
Cydonia site, the moon, ufos the Paranormal, geology, Martian history.  
Some of these areas are more active than others.  The board also 
supports QWK format off-line readers for those who want to just jump on and 
download mail and later quickly upload replies.

STTS:  What message areas are the most active?

MS. ORNE:  At the moment "What's happening on the Moon" is the most active.  
This is because the Moon is a current interest of the Mars Mission.  When the
Mars Observer died, interest in Mars waned because there appeared to be no 
hope in resolving the issue in the foreseeable future.  The moon is a 
different story.  If the military releases the Clementine photos then we can 
know, right now, whether there is anything of interest on the Moon or not.  
The moon section is by far the most active at the moment followed closely by 
ufos (always an interesting subject no matter what else is happening.)

STTS:  Is there any scheduled date that these images will be released?

MS. ORNE:  Sadly, none that I am aware of.  The current fear is that by the 
time we get them the interesting ones will have been air brushed.  I think 
that the only hope of getting information that everyone can feel comfortable 
with is to mount a private lunar satellite mission to the Moon.  This is, in 
fact, one of the things that the Mars Mission is trying to put together.  The 
estimated cost is 30 million and will have to come solely from donations.

STTS:  What do you think the most interesting Lunar object or site is?

MS. ORNE:  Mare Crisium is by far the most interesting area and contains 
apparent towers and bridges.  This would be the area that I would want to 
see high resolution photos of.  There are other areas such as the vicinity 
of Ukert crater, but Mare Crisium remains the most talked about.  Hoagland 
had indicated that he believes that Mare Crisium contains the remnants of 
a huge domed structure.

STTS:  What other file areas are available?

Ms. Orne:  The Mars file section contains lots of images of the Cydonia area 
and other anomalous areas on Mars.  If all goes well I'll be adding a CD-ROM 
in the next month or two and will make available the entire planet Mars 
from NASA Viking images which I can get on CD.  This would allow users, or 
perhaps a group of users, to reexamine other areas of Mars for additional     
anomalies.  An amateur survey, if you will.

STTS:  How much data will be available with this?

MS. ORNE:  Somewhere in the neighborhood of 3 gigs of Viking imaging.  At 
first I'll have to place 1 CD in the CD drive each day and provide a 
schedule of which days which CDs will be available.  Eventually, I'd like 
to have all the CDs available all the time.

STTS:  And how many CDs does this collection contain?

MS. ORNE:  Between 6 and 10.  NASA is not finished making them so I don't, 
at the moment, know the final number.  I'm sure that NASA will also be 
making other satellite mission imaging available that could be added as well.  
As far as I know, there isn't any organized data on CD regarding the Moon 
yet, and I don't know if NASA has any plans in that regard.

STTS:  What other missions would you like to have available?

MS. ORNE:  I'm just guessing but, I would expect that it's NASA's intent to 
place other missions on CD as well such as Voyager 1 and 2, Magellan and 
Galileo when it's available (it hasn't reached it's target -Jupiter- Yet) 
but, will be dropping a probe into the Jovian atmosphere.

STTS:  What else do you know of that will be available on your board?

MS. ORNE:  At the moment Mars is the emphasis.  Someone else can do 
Venus <G>..  I do have, in the back of my mind however, to start a new 
section dealing with ancient anomalies here on Earth that may tie into the 
Mars/Moon imaging and information.  I really don't have any files in that 
area at the moment though.

STTS:  Aside from message bases and files, what else does your board have 
to offer?

MS. ORNE:  At the moment that's it, just messages and files.  I do hope to 
add some type of door programs at some point the nature of which I'm not 
sure of at the moment (Not games though).

STTS: What types of doors?

MS. ORNE:  Well, a database access door has come to mind although this would 
probably be something in conjunction with Viking CDs for locating sites of 
interesting categorized images.

STTS:  Like a search program?

MS. ORNE:  Yes something like that with perhaps some ANSII graphics to 
provide descriptions for processes etc.  Sort of an encyclopedia of Mars.
I have been considering RIP graphics as well (this would be optional) but 
would allow for much more comprehensive imaging on-line.

STTS:  So what other plans do you have?

MS. ORNE:  Beyond my presidential aspirations that's about it <G>.....

STTS:  Okay.<G>  Thank you very much for your time.

Beginning last month, everyone who answered the survey had their
name thrown into a hat for a random drawing.  Each month we'll give away
a prize of some great (or not-so-great) worth by drawing a name out of
the hat.  Everyone who fills out and sends in a survey is eligible!

Sept. 1st was the first such drawing, and Dave Crumb of Chicago,
Illinois was selected to win Cinemark's claymation VGA/Soundblaster game
FREE DC!  Congratulations, Dave! 

The Oct. 1st prize will be three FREE month's of access of Cambridge,
Mass.'s mega BBS Channel 1.  Check out the MONTHLY PRIZE GIVEAWAY
articles from the main menu for more details. 


            #          #          #


The results are in from the survey in the Aug. issue of STTS, and
tabulated below for a median score. 

So far, the response rate has been tremendous.  We've received responses
from all over the USA and several other countries including Canada,
South America, and France! 

For those of you who've yet to respond, please do so now.  Your response
will be greatly appreciated, and help shape the look, feel, and content
of the magazine in the months to come. 

I'd like to thank everyone who responded. Each and every one of your
comments were read and taken into consideration.  

In the survey, I asked the readers to rate the sections of the magazine
on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the best and one being the worst. Here's
the averages, taken by adding all the scores for an indiviual section
(eg: fiction) and dividing it by the number of survey's received that
scored that section with something other than an "X" for no comment.

Magazine sections are ranked in order of scores, from highest to lowest:


SCORES
ÄÄÄÄÄÄ 

Fiction:            9.6    
Poetry:             9.2
Book Reviews:       8.0
Editorial:          8.6
Feature Articles:   8.6
Humour:             8.7
Movie Reviews:      8.6
Software Reviews:   8.9
ANSI Coverart:      7.3
CD Reviews:         7.1
Question & Answers: 7.1


Summary: Fiction and poetry seemed to prove the most popular, as I was
         sure it would. Nothing really received *bad* scores, though,
         which is promising. Of the reviews, the software reviews seem 
         to be ahead, the book and movie reviews seemed to be neck and 
         neck, and the CD reviews place a somewhat distant fourth.  

         What the above scores really *don't* tell is that the surveys
         seemed to be divided into camps. There were several people that
         read STTS mainly for fiction and poetry, and almost as many 
         people who read it exclusively for the reviews. Both groups
         scored their interest group high while X'ing a "No Comment" 
         on the other sections. 

Again, many thanks to those of you who took the time to fill out and
send in your surveys. If you haven't yet filled out the survey, you 
still have time to do so. 

Thanks for reading and, if you haven't already, please fill out the
survey! <G>

Blue Wave Off-line Mail Reader
Requires: DOS 3.3 or above, Shareware program
Cutting Edge Computing
Registration Fee: $25.00
 
Bulletin Board Systems have many exciting features.  You may check the latest
Shareware/freeware files, play a diversionary on-line game or explore the
robust world of electronic mail. Ideally you would like to do all of the above.
However, without an easy-to-use off-line mail reader you could not possibly
enjoy many of the opportunities and help that the world of e-mail has to offer.
With the growing popularity of message conferences, some with hundreds of
message posts a day, you could not read many of your favorite conferences and
still have time to look at other features of a BBS.
 
To alleviate this problem many boards are using off-line mail utilities that
allow a user to read messages off-line and enjoy other aspects of the board
while freeing up telephone lines quicker.  One of the top mail reader programs
is Blue Wave.  Blue Wave can be used with any BBS mail utility that uses
either the QWK or Blue Wave mail packet format.
 
Blue Wave is very easy for the beginner to use, but has a lot of power
functions for the experienced user and someone who wants to get the most out of
a program as possible.  A few or its many functions include:
 
- An address book - to keep the name of people you write to most often
- DOS Shell
- The ability to run batch files
- The ability to post the same message in many conference with one keystroke
- Delete messages from your mail packet
- Reply to messages with one quick keystroke
- It automatically quotes the original message when you enter a reply
- Delete, Edit or View replies that you have already saved
- Read the BBS opening screens and bulletins (if your BBS has the capability)

TIME Man Of The Year - CD-ROM
Compact Publishing, Inc.
PO. Box 40310
Washington, D.C. 20016
(800)964-1518
List Price: $39.95
 
If you need to find information on some of the most influential people during
the last seven decades, this is a must see program.  The Time Man Of The Year
CD-ROM has bibliographical information on the TIME Magazine Man Of The Year
winners dating back to 1927.  There are photographs and video clips of each
person.
 
Besides having the Man Of The Year winners, this program also has information
on some of the most prominently featured people ever covered by the pages of
TIME Magazine, under the section titled Portraits.  The individuals covered in
the Portrait section are very influential and have had far reaching impacts on
the world, but never received the distinction of TIME Man Of The Year.  The
program also has the text of every issue for the past year.  The disk I
reviewed was for 1992 and prominently features President Clinton, who was the
1992 TIME Man Of The Year recipient.
 
The program itself is easy to use.  You can view photos, video clips and text
easily.  There is a search feature that allow you to browse all of the text
related to a particular subject.  Once you find the information you want to
use, getting that information into your document is only a cut and paste away.
 
This program requires a CD-ROM player, Windows and 1MB of hard disk space.
Most of the information is kept on the CD, where is should be.  However, when
viewing video clips you may have to be patient while the program copies the
video files to the HD for quicker playing.  Other than patience, there are no
technological difficulties to contend with.  Everything seems to run very
nicely right from the start.
 
If you like history, you'll enjoy this program.  It is a very useful tool for
the student writing many historical papers or doing research.  There is a ton
of information on some of the most influential personalities in recent history
and a whole years worth of text from one of the best information sources, TIME
magazine.

          IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU is a deliriously giddy movie, a work
     that's determined to make you feel better despite yourself.  Such
     an aggressively feel-good movie hasn't appeared on screen since,
     well, since last year's SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE.  Though neither
     romantic comedy share cast, crew, or creative personnel, they
     still resonate on the same giddy level, layering the proceedings
     in a fantasy-like quality.  The situations (a perfect love
     changing your life forever; top prize in a lottery changing your
     live forever) are storybook simple writ large -- the choice of
     music, the "staging," even the staggering coincidences that turn
     up in both films underscore the similarity in style.  The
     directors do have their distinctive touches, though:  Nora Ephron
     (SLEEPLESS) keeps a light, breezy touch on her material.
     SLEEPLESS is airy and expansive, as open as Tom Hanks' heart and
     Meg Ryan's smile.  Andrew Bergman (IT COULD HAPPEN) exhibits a
     tarter edge to his humor, nervous and twitchy (Rosie Perez), and
     by turns glum and morose (Nicolas Cage, Bridget Fonda).  But the
     romantic icing with which Bergman frosts his story makes this
     film brighter and more colorful than its nigh-claustrophobic
     Queens settings would normally allow.  I'd refer to IT COULD
     HAPPEN TO YOU as the SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE of 1994, but it's a
     little more intelligent and won't earn as much box office as
     Ephron's frothy mix.  Plus some other critic already beat me to
     it.

          The film is a wonderful romantic comedy originally titled
     COP GIVES WAITRESS $2 MILLION TIP, which says it all.  Cage plays
     the big-hearted cop with an old-fashioned "goodness" that never
     lapses into unbelievably wide-eyed innocence or smarmy sentiment.
     He does what he does (honors his promises; saves a merchant from
     a holdup) because it's what he does.  He needs to be good,
     because it's an essential part of his nature, like breathing.
     Approval, awards, or applause never enter his mind, though they
     do visit him throughout the story.  That's why he's a cop.
     Cage's character is a refreshing change from the current crop of
     "What's in it for me?" protagonists -- and actors, for that
     matter.  It's a role that would fit Tom Hanks or Richard Dreyfuss
     just as well as it fits Cage.

          Fonda's waitress, while just as cheery as Cage in the latter
     half of the film, starts out a bit cranky and cantankerous.  Who
     can blame her -- she's just declared bankruptcy, having been
     stuck with a $12,000 credit card bill by her estranged husband.
     Her protestations that she can't afford a divorce don't wash in
     this day of $40 quicky specials.  Despite her troubles, though,
     she still manages to force a smile for smart-alecky customers
     (Cage and his cop partner) and avoids blowing up at her Scrooge-
     like boss.

          Cage and Fonda are almost too good to be true, so of course
     they're going to fall in love.

          When the "lottery cop and waitress" begin sharing their good
     fortune with others -- buying subway tokesn for strangers,
     renting a baseball stadium for the neighborhood kids -- the film
     almost teeters into pur sappiness.  Disasters visited upon the
     pair (in the form of Rosie Perez as a shrewish wife and Stanley
     Tucci as Fonda's unemployed actor husband) almost seem forced,
     contrived to counterbalance the sweetness.  The third act
     reality-warping coincidence that throws Cage and Fonda together
     at the Plaza nearly topples the realism created by screenwriter
     Jane Anderson and director Bergman.  Cage and Fonda are solid
     enough, however, to carry us through such concerns and even bring
     us to cheer for them.

          A seemingly-metaphysical Isaac Hayes ("Angel") serves as
     narrator, but he's thankfully brought to ground by the time we
     reach the Plaza.  He serves as an understated observer to what is
     loosely based on a true story.  "The story you're about to see is
     more or less true," he tells us in the beginning, and you find
     yourself wishing that more films carried the same disclaimer.  IT
     COULD HAPPEN TO YOU doesn't need it, though, because it's strong
     enough, and entertaining enough, to stand on its own merits.

          Whoopi's had an interesting career, alternating broad comedy
     (BURGLAR, GHOST, SISTER ACT) with heart-touching drama (THE COLOR
     PURPLE, THE LONG WALK HOME, CLARA'S HEART), equally at home
     wringing laughter or tears from her audience.  On the heels of
     1993's disappointing MADE IN AMERICA, we now have CORINNA,
     CORINNA, a touching look at a young girl, her nanny, and her
     father.  Set in the 1950s, CORINNA, CORINNA is a film more of its
     characters than of the time it wants to portray.

          Ray Liotta is a jingle writer with an ad agency that's
     working on big name accounts like Mr. Potato Head and Jello.
     His wife dies unexpectedly, and due to his commitments at work,
     he needs to hire a nanny, and he needs to do it right away.  The
     parade of nannies is starting to become old hat for this kind of
     picture (neatly spoofed by the multi-voiced Robin Williams in
     MRS. DOUBTFIRE), and the present film really adds nothing to the
     clich.  There's the bible-thumper, the neurotic, the storm-
     trooper, and the demander, all laid out in a row like a blueprint
     for a Mary Poppins remake.  Whoopi's interview scene is rather
     standard as well, nervous during the interview (trying to take
     charge, then backpedaling mightily), capped off by her kind act
     towards Tina Majorino, Liotta's daughter, that the father happens
     to catch through a parted curtain.  This kind of scene always
     strikes me as false; just because a person is kind to a child
     doesn't mean he or she will make a good babysitter/nanny/
     caretaker.  But of course Whoopi does, and manages to draw
     Majorino out of her shell.

          Majorino temporarily refuses to speak after her mother's
     death, falling into a self-imposed autism that you'd expect the
     father to have her examined by a specialist -- he makes enough
     money to pay for treatment.  But all it takes, and here's another
     one of the movie's fallacies, is Whoopi's love and irreverent
     attitude to overcome the child's deep psychological scars.  It
     only happens in the movies, folks, and in this instance serves as
     the first step to the inevitable: Goldberg and Liotta falling in
     love.  I don't mean to sound cynical here -- the scenes are
     tentative and very touching, and there's one shot of Majorino
     lying on a hillside, her mother's dress beside her and her hand
     hidden protectively in one of the dress' pockets, that will
     absolutely pull your heart out of your body.  It may be a
     manipulative scene with little grounding in reality, but the
     image *works*, and works exceedingly well.  Would that
     writer/director Jessie Nelson had crafted the rest of the picture
     as lovingly as that shot.

          After Majorino begins speaking, the focus shifts to the
     incipient love story, which grows very naturally from the
     circumstances.  Both Liotta and Goldberg share an intimate
     knowledge of music, he due to his chosen profession, she because
     she loves music and longs to write album liner notes (remember
     liner notes?) and a column in "High Hat" magazine.  Music becomes
     the universal language of love, to steal a quote from another
     source, and as the soundtrack becomes more lush and more lusty
     (bluesy numbers from Louis Armstrong and Billy Holliday add
     nicely to the proceedings), the relationship deepens, and
     relatives on both sides (Liotta's parents, Goldberg's sister)
     begin to notice, all the time fixing them up with boring,
     desperate dates.  Wendy Crewson does a nice turn as Liotta's
     potential girlfriend, thrown at him by his mother.  She's lonely,
     but Nelson gives the character a comedic spin, so she doesn't
     seem too pathetic.

          At first, I didn't think a relationship between Liotta and
     Goldberg would work on screen, but Nelson builds to it so
     gradually and interestingly (some nice scenes depicted from
     Majorino's point of view) that it works.  Unfortunately, when
     Nelson deals with the attendant bigotry of the time, from both
     sides of the relationship, the movie falls flat and becomes
     forced.  We expect the prejudice to crop up earlier and more
     strongly, and when it finally rears its ugly head, it's no more
     threatening than a Klansman in a paisley sheet.

          Lo, I have been to the wasteland, my friends, and I have
     seen the devil's work.  Harken to me now as I tell you a tale an'
     will chill your blains and set your knees to knockin'.

          There were matinees abroad in the land in those days, a
     temptation to adult and child, an idol to the heathen god of
     entertainment.  And Hollywood created the serial and the short
     subject, and the audience looked upon them, and they were good.
     At the very least, they were entertaining.  At the very, very
     least, they killed time before the feature attraction.  And the
     short subject begat cartoons, and cartoons begat cliffhangers,
     and cliffhangers begat action serials, and action serials begat
     children's serials, and children's serials begat "Our Gang," and
     "Our Gang" begat Alfalfa, Spanky, Darla, Stymie, Porky, and
     Buckwheat.  And the children looked upon them, and they were
     otay!

          And movies begat radio (kinda sorta), and radio begat
     television (sorta kinda), and television became the devourer of
     material and the babysitter of children.  "Our Gang" became "The
     Little Rascals," and lo, the message was brought unto a new
     generation, and the message was otay!

          And successful television series begat motion picture
     remakes.  STAR TREK begat STAR TREK:  THE MOTION PICTURE.  And
     STAR TREK:  THE MOTION PICTURE begat THE ADDAMS FAMILY.  And THE
     ADDAMS FAMILY begat THE FUGITIVE and THE FUGITIVE begat THE
     BEVERLY HILLBILLIES and THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES begat THE FLINT-
     STONES and THE FLINTSTONES begat THE LITTLE RASCALS.  And the
     cycle was complete, and the audience looked upon it, and it was
     not otay.  In fact, it stunk to high heaven.

          THE LITTLE RASCALS has to be the worst-directed movie I've
     seen this year, and in a summer that includes NORTH and COLOR OF
     NIGHT, that's saying something.  I've long suspected that
     director Penelope Spheeris wasn't an actor's director, and this
     picture proves it.  Mugging kids, misdirected gazes, an
     inconsistent mix of over-reacting and non-reaction . . . the
     children are constantly distracted, unable to focus on who
     they're talking to or what they're supposed to be working on.
     Spheeris works better with experienced actors (i.e., Mike Myers
     and Dana Carvey in WAYNE'S WORLD, 1992), but even then she can't
     rein in the mugging and broad acting styles.  Something seems to
     happen to Spheeris once she sits in the director's chair; she
     loses all sense of control and proportion.  In the current
     project, she indulges her entire "kids is cute" repertoire,
     employing extreme close ups until Darla's darling pudgy face
     fills the screen or Alfalfa's endearing cowlick hits the top of
     the frame.  Had any of these kids the comic timing or double-take
     ability of the original cast, they'd manage to redeem the use of
     Spheeris' lingering and intrusive camera.  The camera isn't an
     observer of the Rascals' adventures -- it's an unwilling and
     unwitting partner in their nefarious activities.

          Labeling THE LITTLE RASCALS sexist or racist is silly --
     little boys and little girls frequently don't like each other,
     and this time both Stymie and Buckwheat are more positive role
     models than the originals.  No, THE LITTLE RASCALS' primary
     problem isn't PC-related.  It's the other aspects of the movie
     serials that Spheeris slavishly sticks to that sinks the story-
     line and the picture's entertainment value.  She repeatedly uses
     rapid motion to convey comedy, whether it's Keystone Kops-like
     chases or group scenes like building a new race car.  This visual
     gag is old hat and doesn't pull laughs from today's audiences (at
     least not from the audience in the screening I attended).  The
     He-Man Womun Haters Club, Alfalfa's romance with Darla (actually
     one of the sweeter aspects of this movie), Alfalfa's singing and
     his incident with soap bubbles are all things we've seen before,
     and don't bear repeating.  And the costuming, gadzooks!  THE
     LITTLE RASCALS is set in today's Los Angeles, but the kids dress
     as though they stepped right out of the '40s.  They own no modern
     toys (aside from the race car, and even it seems dated), they
     don't reference today's pop culture (comics, movies, TV), and
     they don't interact with modern technology in any way.  It's as
     though the children live in their own world, a time warp bubble
     set in the California hills.  What at first seems cute becomes
     weirder and more divorced from reality as the movie progresses.

          Spheeris also displays a shocking lack of continuity.  She
     had her hands full concentrating on the childrens' performances,
     as the end-of-movie outtakes show (and even then she botched her
     job), but surely she had a responsible continuity person who made
     sure that scenes matched from take to take.  These gaffes are
     incredibly easy to spot and don't take a special eye at all.  It
     becomes something of a game with some movies to see how many
     mistakes you can spot.  With THE LITTLE RASCALS, you'll find so
     many bloopers (moving scenery before kids arrive to move it,
     reappearing items after the prop has been removed from a scene,
     the race car being rebuilt in a cockeyed order, and a spilled
     pickle jar that apparently had no effect on Porky and Buckwheat)
     that it's no fun looking for them after the first twenty minutes.

          THE LITTLE RASCALS is a poor excuse for a movie, and should
     have been shelved or released straight to video to save the
     embarrassment of the big screen.  How Spheeris managed to snag so
     many recognizable stars for cameos escapes me, especially
     considering her movie track record, her most recent stinker being
     THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES (1993).

          They're crazy, they're wacky, they're rock-n-rollers with
     Uzis.  Sure, the Uzis are really water guns filled with pepper
     spray, but the members of an unknown band, The Lone Rangers (how
     can there be more than one if you're "lone"?), do pull a wild-n-
     crazy stunt with them.  They hold up a radio station just to get
     their demo played on the air.  Every record company in town and
     several nightclubs have slammed the doors on this band, so
     hijacking the airwaves seems to make sense.  Only to the band, of
     course.

          Imagine Bill & Ted partnered with Pauly Shore.  Imagine the
     band from PCU (released earlier this year) actually getting air-
     play.  Imagine Weird Al Yankovic's music video parody of Nirvana
     being expanded to two hours.  Slice all of that sideways and
     serve it up as baloney, because that's what AIRHEADS, directed by
     Michael Lehmann, is made of:  a silly, non-vital view of today's
     music scene.  Brendan Fraser, Steve Buscemi and Adam Sandler star
     as the Gen X grunge-punk-post-wave rockers, and though the movie
     features fine work from such solid supporting cast members as Joe
     Mantegna, Ernie Hudson, Michael McKean, and Amy Locane, among
     others, the script wimps out by failing to really name names or
     expose specific industry practices.  To be a vital commentary on
     the contemporary scene, AIRHEADS' basic message should be more
     than, "It's really hard to break into the business."  Well, duh.
     Let me write that down.

          AIRHEADS for the most part is fun, watching three brain-dead
     dudes turn a simple bluff into a full-blown hostage situation
     with an army of cops, hordes of groupies, a SWAT team and real
     guns.  The situation goes from bad to worse, and it's obvious,
     painfully obvious, that these idiots hadn't thought things
     through.  Heck, to expect them to think in the first place is
     asking too much.  Director Michael Lehmann (HEATHERS, 1988) and
     screenwriter Rich Wilkes actually are asking us to identify with
     them, mistakenly portraying them as poor, downtrodden minimum-
     wage bums who just want a break.  Well, I'm sorry, but equating
     three goofs to heroes and giving them a happy ending kinda takes
     the edge off this movie.  It's part of the whole "getting what
     you deserve" philosophy that Lehmann danced with in HEATHERS but
     only flirts with here.  He wants to have it both ways, to
     criticize the industry and yet resolve AIRHEADS' dramatic dilemma
     with a Cinderella success story.  Face facts:  these guys aren't
     smart enough to handle the fame they want, which is shown every-
     time they open their mouths, by their actions at the radio
     station, and by their reactions when a real gun falls into their
     hands.  One moment Chazz (Fraser) is standing by his ideals --
     winning a record contract by the merit of their talents, not
     through the freak show cult of celebrity that's sprung up about
     them -- and the next moment he compromises just so his music can
     be heard.  The end becomes important, to hell with the moral
     implications of the means.

          Most of this film is lip service to rock and roll ideals, to
     personal integrity, and to defying authority.  In the end,
     AIRHEADS plays it just as safe as any Michael Bolton record.  I'm
     very disappointed that the first important movie to address '90s
     music doesn't have the *huevos* to follow up on its promise.  The
     music, and the supporting performances (especially the standout
     Mantegna as an aging rock-n-roll DJ, the only real bite to the
     movie) aren't enough of a backbone to prop the rest of the film
     on.

     RATING:  $$

FUMBLING TOWARDS ECSTASY
Sarah McLachlan
Arista Records

I hear the CD dropped and sense the laser hitting its surface. In
seconds, I hear the strains of dark, compelling music. This first of a
dozen songs is the single "Possession." It begins this journey with Ms.
McLachlan through her world of relationships. She sings "I won't be
denied" and I believe her as I sing along and know that this melody will
haunt my dreams.

The songs of this CD are all about relationships. Dark, deadly,
dysfunctional, confusing, desirous, miserable, foolish, losing, silly,
whimsical, and fearful tales of love that are relinquished, reviled and
revisited again and again. Sarah's soaring vocals push and pull us
through the dark forest of her melodies and her stories of love.

The song "Wait" plays and I feel ready for fall, wrapped in a warm
blanket watching leaves skitter by out the window. McLachlan's words
bring a chill and a desire to search for warmth. She respects love til
her "dying day" and you believe her.

In "Elsewhere," she sings "this is heaven to no one else but me," and
you want to know why she is so willing to wait, linger and cling to
something or someone who will only take what he can get. In some songs,
the relationship is let go, but missed. In others, the lover has "so
much to lose."

In the title track, Sarah sings "I won't fear love." Perhaps that is the
driving force behind this CD; that McLachlan doesn't fear love but wants
to examine, inspect and divine the power behind it. Even in silly songs
like "Ice Cream," I heard a singer/songwriter exploring another aspect
of this thing called love.

For all fans of well-crafted, thoughtful, beautiful music I recommend
this CD. I know I can listen to it repeatedly. However, if you prefer
loud, jarring tunes with obnoxious lyrics this isn't the album for you.
Ms. McLachlan has delivered intelligent music as she fumbled towards
ecstasy.

My score, on a scale of one to ten: 9

In today's culture, things change at light-speed with a certain regularity.  
After all, what may have been "in" this morning, might not be "in" by the end 
of lunch.  And so it goes with rock and roll.  Bands come and go with the 
changing popular attitudes.  Very few hang on to the very end of the last 
member's career.  Black Sabbath, however, is one of those bands.  With a 
career that now spans over three decades, they have proven themselves to be 
the most influential of all the "doom and gloom" bands.  With only two former 
members selling their own solo projects (Ozzy Osbourne and Ronnie James Dio), 
Black Sabbath has never been a launching-pad for the careers of others.  
Instead, guitarist Tony Iommi has carved a niche for the band in the annals of
 Heavy Metal.

This particular Compact Disc might be a little hard to find in the United 
States, as it is a "Greatest Hits" compilation made and sold in Germany.  I 
was lucky enough to get a copy of it while I was stationed overseas at Sembach
 Air Base.  Included with the tracks is a sleeve that chronicles the band's 
history and the various lineups that the band has had.  I highly recommend 
this album for anyone who is a Black Sabbath fan and would love to have the 
complete history of Black Sabbath (at least the history up until early 1989.

The material is culled from every point in the band's career with the 
exception of one album -- "Master Of Reality," released in 1971.  It would 
have been nice if a track from that album had been added.  Regardless, this 
album has all of Sabbath's best hits and makes for a very good introduction 
for the new fan that hasn't heard all of Sabbath's material.  With such 
Sabbath standards as Iron Man, and Paranoid, the album covers the usual ground
 one would expect.  Unexpected pieces of material for this compilation are the 
two "live" tracks from the album "Live Evil," which was a tremendous flop for 
the band in sales.

Outstanding Track -- Born To Lose
Lackluster Track -- Rock & Roll Doctor
Overall Grade -- B+

Parallel Dreams by Loreena McKennitt
Quinlan Road Limited  QRCD 103
 Copyright 1989 Stratford, Ontario Canada

Track Listing
  1.  Samain Night
  2.  Moon Cradle
  3.  Huron 'Beltane' Fire Dance
  4.  Annachie Gordon
  5.  Standing Stones
  6.  Dickens' Dublin (The Palace)
  7.  Breaking The Silence
  8.  Ancient Pines

    "Beyond the transportation into fantasy, dreams have served as a vehicle 
through which we have integrated our conscious and subconcious, the real and 
the surreal, the powerful and the intangible.
    The dreams found in this recording span a wide range from the contemporary
 to the historical as in the Romeo and Juliet story of Jeannie and her lover in
 "Annachie Gordon"; the singular as in the little Dublin street girl who dreams
 of having a home; to the plural in those who who dream of freedom as reflected
 in "Breaking The Silence"; or the earth's yearning for release from the 
oppression of the human hand in "Ancient Pines."  In the "Huron 'Beltane' Fire
 Dance" I have tried to recall the reverence for dreams of the North American 
first peoples and the early Celts.  If there is a recurrent thread which runs 
through these dreams it is one of yearning toward love, liberty and 
integration.  Of all the variations of dreams we may have, these surely are 
our parallel dreams.  --L.M." (1)

I first heard of Loreena McKennitt when I visited Dallas during the Christmas 
of 1993.  I had just come back from Germany with my wife (now my ex-wife) and 
my son Corey for his first Christmas.  Wanting to renew some of the 
friendships that I had lost touch with over the past two years, I had asked 
Tamara (STTS House-Poet) to arrange some "get-togethers" with our mutual 
friends.  One of these "meetings" was with our illustrious editor, Joe 
DeRouen, and his wife Heather.  During that night, Joe continually pumped CDs 
into his stereo system as we all caught up on the gossip.  One CD featured a 
glorious feminine voice floating over some of the most exquisite music I had 
ever heard.  I asked who the artist was and was told it was Miss McKennitt.  
From that moment on, I was hooked.

This is one of the prized CDs in my collection.  Not a single track keeps my 
heart from being stirred, awakening deep within my soul the dreams that I have
 pushed further and further away.  If there were a soundtrack to my soul...this
 is it.  If you love Celtic-style music...you cannot afford to not have this 
artist in your collection.  If you enjoy music along the vein of Andreas 
Vollenweider and Yanni, you will more than likely fall in love with this 
artist as well.  Being that she is still not very well known as an artist (her
 latest album was released on Warner Brothers with zero publicity), it will be 
through mediums such as this that she will gain her fame.

In my opinion, she is one of the best artists of her genre.  Give her CD a 
spin in your deck and see if you don't agree.

Chrome Circle by Mercedes Lackey and Larry Dixon
Baen Books, August 1994
Cover Art by Barclay Shaw
End Piece by Larry Dixon
ISBN 0-671-87615-5

For the past few years, Mercedes Lackey has enjoyed a loyal following of 
readers that has steadily grown.  The immense popularity of her various book 
series (The Heralds of Valdemar, The Last Herald-Mage, The Mage Winds, Diana 
Tregarde Investigations) have recieved critical acclaim from many corners of 
the SF/F (Science Fiction/Fantasy) realm.  Her characters have been right on 
the money, while her storylines sensitive, funny and somewhat believable.  
Once again, she is totally on target with "Chrome Circle," her latest offering
 in the SERRAted Edge series.

These books are based around a group of Elves and humans in Georgia and some 
of the mis/adventures that they have along the way.  The Elves are interested 
in stock car racing and build their own vehicles using magick and a bit of 
technological wizardry (that's where the humans come in).  The stock car 
racing makes for a nice distraction from tense situations in the storylines, 
but it still seems odd to me that Elves would be interested in human gadgetry.
After all, this Elf is particularly interested in fun, music and women -- but 
that is beside the point (sigh).

The story follows one of the human mages named Tannim on his trip to visit his
 folks in Tulsa, Oklahoma (Yessir!  People actually DO LIVE in Oklahoma!!).  He
 gets visited by the lady of his dreams (literally), and she challenges him to 
a duel.  From here, the plot twists and turns like a roller-coaster, with some
 quite preditable endings and some really shocking ones.  While Miss Lackey 
included several very funny scenes there is one thing missing that is usually 
prevelant in her novels:  Emotion.  The story never really tugs at your 
heart-strings like her "Last Herald Mage" or "Mage Winds" series do.  She 
never really gets you to "fall in love" with Tannim or Shar
(Tannim's love interest).

Art-wise, Barclay Shaw's cover-work is quite misleading.  Shar is never 
described in the manner that she is depicted on the cover.  The dragon 
Charcoal looks more like a maniacal horse with wings.  Larry Dixon's end-piece
 is obviously his attempt to put the drawing in a better light.  His end-piece 
is not as well-done as Shaw's -- and once again Charcoal looks like a horse 
with an Ozzy Osbourne attitude!  Big failure on both these artists' part.

All in all, "Chrome Circle" is much more enjoyable than most novels that I 
have read.  Being a big Mercedes Lackey fan, I enjoyed reading yet another 
story in the SERRAted Edge series.  I am dissappointed at the missing 
emotional elements from the book, but I do recommend it to anyone looking for 
a "fun" read.

The Powers That Be
by L. Shawn Aiken


I had a dream.
I wrote it down.
And here it is.

        Two glowing eyes stared at Arthur from the interstate.  His heart 
thumped.  The eyes raced by, showing a dark figure surrounded by a darker 
pool.  A cat.  A dead cat.
        The pain in Arthur's gut wavered, swaying back and forth from a 
dull, numb sensation to a jabbing, poking explosion waiting to happen.  
Should he pull over here?  No.  Too close to the cat.  He would find an 
exit.
        The darkened highway stretched out before him.  The feeble 
headlights showed little of what was up ahead except glowing white markers 
zipping under him.  The rear view mirror showed him the opposite view, 
smothered in a red haze.
        Then orange, luminous markers to the side of the road showed him the 
exit.  He took it.
        The conference in Little Rock had gone well.  For some, at least.  
How was Arthur to know that Mike Moorehead would be there?  Eleven years 
after graduation and Moorehead still remembered Arthur by the nickname 
"Table".  And Moorehead made sure that everyone at the conference called him 
that.
        Perhaps the name Arthur Roundtree lent itself to ridicule, but no 
more than "Moorehead."  Did Arthur even once call his high school 
acquaintance by his old nickname?  No.  It would have been rude.  They were 
professionals now.
        Arthur peered through the windshield.  He had hoped the road would 
lead him to a service station or a rest stop or something.  Some sign of 
civilization at least.  But no.  Nothing.  Just a dirt road and pine trees.  
A murky fog was rolling in from somewhere, probably the foothills nearby.  
Arthur sighed.  He would just have to relieve himself out in the open.
        Light poured from above as he pulled the handle on the door.  Arthur 
noticed all of the rubbish in the passenger side of the floorboard.  Bits of 
paper and countless little hypodermic needles with orange plungers.  He 
shook his head and smiled.  He would have to get onto Mary about that.  
Arthur needed his cigarettes as much as she needed her insulin, but he 
didn't make unholy messes all over the place.
        A glance at the over-stuffed ashtray caused him to smile and eat his 
words.  He then noticed that musty ash smell that permeated the car.  Arthur 
loosened his belt and stepped outside.
        A tingling void filled his gut as he slid back into his seat.  The 
night air was uncomfortably cold, but the relief he felt more than made up 
for it.  He started the car and drove on.
        "Damn Moorehead," he said to himself.  The more he thought of the 
ferret-like little man, the angrier he got.  It was like Moorehead was 
playing some game with him - a game Arthur had never seen the rules to.  And 
who would have guessed Moorehead would have gone into the newspaper 
industry?  He had always been interested in stupid things, like football.
        Most of the people at the convention talked about sports.  
Especially the baseball strike that was paralyzing the major leagues at the 
moment.  But Arthur didn't know much about it, nor did he care.  It did keep 
him out of quite a few conversations, though.
        Arthur mushed the cigarette dangling from his lips into the glowing 
lighter.  As he pulled it away, glowing flecks of tobacco stuck to the red 
hot swirls of metal. He took a puff and looked out into the gravely road lit 
poorly by his headlights.  He should have gotten back to the interstate by 
now.  Had he taken the wrong turn?
        The road abruptly ended in a barbed wire fence that initiated a 
sharp downhill slope.  He peered beyond it and thought he saw the sparkle of 
water.
        "Great,"  he yanked the gear shift into reverse.  The headlights 
died and the engine went silent.  He sat motionlessly in the dark for a few 
seconds, then tried the ignition.  Nothing.  No grinding.  Not even a failed 
turnover.  He tried again.  Still nothing.
        "Crap," he slammed the steering wheel and reached over to the glove 
compartment.  It snapped open and he felt around.  Just as he thought.  No 
flashlight.
        He grudgingly stepped out of the car into the cold night air.  At 
least this time he wouldn't have to expose his privates to it.  Darkness 
enveloped him.  He could not see his hands, much less the ground.  But there 
was some light.  The grey fog seemed to glow with a brilliance all its own.  
The moon, he surmised, but did not remember seeing it on the highway.
        Arthur had seen nothing the way he had come in.  The fence had to 
have been built by someone.  Most likely there was a house somewhere nearby.
        He grinned to himself, picturing the house's residents as clones of 
the little in-bred banjo player in Deliverance.  He stopped grinning, 
remembering the scene with Ned Beatty and the squealing.  Why had Mary drug 
him all the way up to the foothills of the Ozarks to live?  It was 
definitely not his element.  He preferred big cities, like New York or Los 
Angeles.  Places where you could get whatever you needed, any time you 
needed it.  Mary agreed with him, saying that you could get shot anytime you 
needed to as well.
        "Our kids will be safer back home," she had told him.  "They will be 
closer to Aunt Jacene and Uncle Roy.  They  will have kids to play with, and 
we won't have to worry about drugs or anything."  That was before her 
episodes that had made her barren.
        That argument had never affected his decision anyway.  Arthur always 
had felt that kids should be exposed to the real world so they know how to 
deal with it.  The real reason was perhaps a bit more selfish.
        "And daddy will give you any job you want at the paper," she had 
smiled at him with that mischievous, 'I win the argument' glint in her eye.  
"He will even make you editor, if that's what you want."
        That had settled it.  Of course, he had never planned to spend the 
rest of his life in Arkansas.  He saw the job as merely temporary.  A place 
to get experience at, then move on to bigger and better things.  But Mary's 
heart attacks had derailed everything.
        He didn't blame her.  He didn't blame anyone.  At least until now, 
stuck out in the middle of nowhere with a broken car and the cold air 
seeping into his flimsy windbreaker.  The obvious culprit was Moorehead.
        Arthur popped the hood on the Chevy.  He had left the Mercedes with 
Mary in case she needed reliable transport.  And it had the car phone in it, 
just in case she needed it.  He preferred the Nova anyway.  It was were he 
had lost his virginity to Mary.  She had lost hers somewhere else.  Mary 
would sometimes jokingly say that she had lost it on a trampoline.
        He dug the lighter from out of the pocket of the windbreaker as he 
lifted the hood.  There was a sharp smell of gasoline.  The lighter played 
nervously in his hands.  He better not.  The last thing he needed was an 
exploding car to warm the night air.
        The hood slammed down and he peered out at the fog.  It glowed all 
around, interrupted by the straight, dark trunks of the pine trees.  No 
signs of any habitation.  Arthur was sure that the fence meant something.  
Someone had to live nearby.  If he could follow it to a gate or something.
        Arthur reached out towards the fence, then remembered it was 
barbed.  He then knelt and felt the ground.  There.  Something rough.  A 
stick.  He gripped it.  Not too long.  He smiled and yawned at the same 
time, almost pulling a facial muscle he did not know he had.
        He tapped the stick against the gate.  A clanky - twang sound came 
from it.  Good.  This would help guide him in the dark.  Arthur took a step, 
then hit the fence.  He took another, and hit the fence again.  It was 
working.
        A yawn broke forth from his again.  It was late.  He was tired.  The 
conference would not officially end until the morning, but Arthur had felt a 
strange urge to come home.  Speaking with Mary on the phone to make sure she 
was all right had not quenched his urge.  Moorehead was probably the real 
reason, but he didn't want to think about it.
        He stumbled on a root, then decided he should walk with another 
stick tapping the ground.  No.  One hand had to be kept in his pocket or he 
would feel he was freezing to death.  The one stick could do both.  A 
clang - twang against the fence, a thump against the ground.
        The glowing mist seemed to be closing in on all sides.  Slowly, 
oozing about.  It had no real form, but Arthur imagined it as a giant bed 
sheet wrapped around him.  Or perhaps thousand of Ku Klux Klan members 
marching towards him.  That thought sent the small bit of Jewish blood in 
him racing through his veins, trying to go deeper and deeper in his body.  
Trying to run away.  He smiled as he shut his eyes and imagined himself 
machine-gunning people with pillows on their heads.  Their leader was a man 
named Moorehead, and he got more bullets that the rest.
        Several minutes seeped by and Arthur realized something was missing.  
He looked around.  The mist was still there.  The dark trees were still 
there.  But something was missing.  Something important.  He shrugged and 
continued on, thumping away at the ground.
        That was it!  His heart pounded louder than the thumping.  The 
clang - twang was gone.  He reached out with the stick.  Nothing.
        He stood motionless, trying to fight the urge to run.  The random 
roots would surely trip him, sending him headlong into a tree trunk.  But he 
couldn't hold back.  He ran.
        The stick waved quickly in front of him.  Nothing.  No noise.  The 
fence was gone!  He kept running.  Perhaps he was going the wrong way!  He 
turned and ran in another direction.  Then in another.  By the time the 
stitch in his side came, he had no idea where he was.
        But he saw something!  A light.  No.  Not a light.  It was a 
building.  Glowing.  It looked like it was lit by the fog.  Or maybe the fog 
was lit by the building.  He walked quickly towards it, ignoring the sharp 
pin in his abdomen.
        The building grew clearer as he approached it.  His first impression 
was that it looked like the Alamo in San Antonio.  Only build of grey rock.  
But that wasn't the right shape.  It seemed more like a Gothic cathedral 
without spires.  But that wasn't right either.  Perhaps some other type of 
structure.  A castle?  No.  I was a movie theater!  A grey stoned Gothic 
movie theater?  Was there such a thing?
        He crept toward it slowly, the stick clenched in his hand.  A golden 
glow was emanating from inside, shining out through glass doors.  Arthur 
took his stick and tapped the stone steps leading up to it.  They were real.
        Inside he could see a glass counter, filled with candy and popcorn.  
But he could not see anyone inside.  There was no ticket booth.  Arthur went 
up the steps and tapped the door.  It swung open.
        What was this?  Arthur's mind tried to pierce through the cold that 
had seeped into his mind and find some explanation.  He yawned.  There was 
no explanation there.  With a deep breath of the cold night air, he stepped 
inside.
        The warm glow of the overhead lights seemed to heat his skin.  It 
felt good.  The smell of fresh popped popcorn tickled his nose.  The popcorn 
machine was full to the brim of the fluffy stuff.
        "Hello?" he said.  Nothing.
        "Hello!" he said louder.  Still nothing.  The carpet was clean.  No 
little bits of wrapper.  No brown spots of spilled cola.  No popcorn 
shrapnel.
        "Hello?" he said again.  Double doors beyond the counter had a sign 
above them: "NORWAY."
        "I don't remember that movie," he muttered to himself.  Still no one 
had showed up.  He walked silently to the doors.  One was cracked open.  A 
big blue screen stared back at him from beyond the seats of the movie 
theater.  He looked back at the counter.  No one.
        Should he go in?  He had not even paid.  Would they be angry if they 
found him in the theater without paying?  He turned and looked through the 
glass doors to the darkness outside.  It certainly was much more comfortable 
in here.  Nice and warm.  And it smelled good too.  Should he get some 
popcorn?  No.  That would be stealing.  But sitting in an empty movie 
theater?  That would be okay.  He opened the doors.
        The seats were all clean and nice.  No tears.  No rips.  And that 
sickly smell of spilt cola was not present, even standing right next to the 
trash can.  He walked down the slopped isle.  He got to the middle and 
turned right.  Then he counted off six seats, then sat down.  His place.  
His place in any movie house.
        The seat was soft and comfortable.  It was good to get the weight 
off of his feet.  It would be nicer to put his feet up on back of the seat 
in front of him.  But no, that would scuff it up.  And maybe someone would 
come and tell him to put his feet down.
        Arthur closed his eyes and put his stick across the armrests.  There 
was no one to complain about that here now.  He smiled and leaned back.
        It got dark.  Much darker than if he had just closed his eyes.  He 
opened them again.  The lights were off and the screen was no longer 
blue - but the glowing kind of black that movie screen get when film is 
rolling.  He looked up.  Light was coming from the projection booth.  
Somebody must was in there.
        "Hello?" Arthur said toward the booth.  Nothing.  He did it again.  
Still nothing.  Perhaps it was automatic.  Arthur shrugged his shoulders and 
looked back at the screen.
        "NORWAY," is said in big capital letters.  The image was jumpy and 
there were audible clicks like in an audio-visual film at school.
        A majestic scene appeared.  The walls of a  glacier-plowed fjord 
towed over head.  The view rose slowly up over the cliffs, showing a 
tree-studded plain filled with snow and purple mountains looming in the 
distance.
        "The beauties of Norway are at an arm's length with a simple visit 
to your local travel agent," said a thickly accented voice.  Arthur blinked 
twice at the screen in amazement.  What the hell was this?
        The announcer continued, and an more panoramic views of the country 
were shown.  Huge, snow covered trees.  Simple villages made up to look like 
ancient Viking holdings. And the amazing shopping opportunities located at 
easy to access locales in urban areas.  Arthur shook his head, wondering 
what was going on.
        Then he saw it.  Some one was standing behind a bush.  Not a real 
bush, but a bush on the screen.  The person was crouched behind it as if he 
were hiding.
        Before Arthur could get a good look, the scene changed.  Pretend 
Vikings were on a pretend longboat, rowing away like mad.  All except one.  
One was not in Viking garb.  He was hiding behind the other Vikings.  But he 
was there, all right.  Arthur could see him.  What was he up to?
        The screen changed again.  Young blonde couples were skating on a 
frozen lake.  The announcer described what joy they were having.  But one 
was having no joy.  One of the people on the lake was just standing there.  
He did not even have skates.  He was looking.  Staring.  Staring at Arthur!
        The scene changed.  Arthur's heart was pounding and both hands 
gripped the stick.  He quickly scanned the scene.  Was the person there?  It 
was a zoo.  Bears.  There were lots of bears.  And people were looking at 
the bears.  All except one.  One was staring at Arthur.
        He had the countenance of a ferret - little black eyes and a long 
nose.  It almost twitched.  His back was bent and his shoulders stuck out.  
It made him almost look like a vulture.  Some strange genetic mutation of a 
ferret and a vulture.  No humanity anywhere in the equation.
        "Moorehead!" Arthur gasped and held the stick tighter.  What was 
going on here?
        Giggles erupted.  Not the maniacal giggles he had expected.  Girlish 
giggles.  The scene changed.  More girl giggles.  He looked down at the 
front row.
        Three silhouettes were outlined against the screen.  Arms were 
undulating from them, and hands that were making dogie shaped shadows.  
Suddenly one threw a handful of something at another.  It sailed lightly 
through the air and showered down.  It was popcorn.  The other returned the 
blast, and more giggles ensued.
        Arthur breathed deeply.  People.  Perhaps they could explain what 
was going on.  Just as he got up from his seat, on of the silhouettes stood 
up.  It was the one that had stayed out of the popcorn fight.  Arthur walked 
to the aisle and she met him there.
        Her skin was pale and her eyes were dark.  She was far shorter than 
he was, but somehow she looked at him eye to eye.
        "Can you tell me where we are?" he asked, still gripping the stick.
        She pointed a finger at herself.  "I am here," she said, then 
pointed at him.  "And you are there.  Duh!"
        Arthur breathed deeply.  This was not going to be easy.  "What is 
your name?"
        "Annakie, if it's all the same,"  she giggled.
        "Where is this place?"
        She sighed, "Norway.  It's awful dull, isn't it?"
        "Why was that man up on the screen?" he demanded.  She took a glance 
back.
        "I didn't see any man," she said.
        "But there was a man on the screen.  A man that shouldn't have been 
there!"
        She shrugged.  "You see what you want to see, don't you?"
        He stared at Annakie.
        "Come on.  Let's go.  I'm suppose to tell you something."
        "What?"
        "Not here," she shook here head.  "Outside.  Outside."
        What was the girl on about?  "Okay," Arthur said, and turned around 
toward the double doors.
        "No no," she tugged at his hand.  "Out the back way.  The exit.  Not 
the entrance.  Down at the bottom of the theater.  See?"
        Arthur looked to where Annakie was pointing.  A red neon sign over a 
door.  He nodded and they went down the aisle.  The past the two other girls 
on the way out.
        "Who are they?" Arthur asked.
        "They're my friends, but they don't know it yet," she smiled and 
pushed the door open.
        They came out into a courtyard.  Four building faced them on all 
sides.  Large, gray, stone buildings.  Gothic-like arches.  Streaked with 
acid rain.  Deteriorating.  Crumbling in chunks.  Beyond them were the 
silhouettes of slim pine trees and a gray mist coming from behind.
        The girl walked to the center of the courtyard.  There was a 
monument.  Or a obelisk.  Or something.  It was made of gray stone as well, 
and rectangular in shape.  Not a wall, though.  It was much too short.  
Perhaps only two feet high.  Arthur followed her to it.
        Annakie turned to him.  "There will be a meeting of the Powers 
soon."
        Arthur stared at her blankly.
        She pointed to her chest.  "I'm a Power.  See?"
        "Um . . . no," he shook his head slowly.
        "See!"  she knelt down and pointed to the stone.  There was a name 
on the wall.  "Dexter Geis."  It had a line drawn through it.  Underneath 
was the name "Annakie Webber."  There were other names on the stone, but 
Arthur could not read them.  They were not in a foreign tongue.  He just 
couldn't read them.
        "You are a power," Arthur looked at her.
        "No.  A Power."
        He nodded slowly, still not knowing what the hell was going on.  
"And who told you to tell me this?"
        "That's not what I'm supposed to tell you.  Hold your horses and 
I'll get to it," she stamped her foot.  "I don't really remember who it was.  
I was asleep and I'm kind of new here and don't know everything that's going 
on."  She looked up at him now, not eye to eye.
        "Okay," he smiled reassuringly.  For some reason he was feeling 
sorry for her.  He wanted to protect her.  "So what are you supposed to tell 
me?"
        She breathed deeply.  "The person that was the Power before me is an 
old man.  You should go meet him at a baseball game."
        He nodded, still not understanding.  "Okay.  Is that it?"
        "That's it a-rooney!" she laughed.  "So you will go see him?"
        "Uh . . . sure."
        "Good.  I have to go wake up and pee."


        Arthur looked at the popcorn nestled in the white paper bag.  It did 
not smell as good as the movie theater popcorn.  The hot dog in his other 
hand was not right either.  The hot dog itself was the wrong color and the 
wrong shape, the bun was all out of sorts, and the mustard failed to be 
yellow, but was a rather brown color.
        "Your inner light is quite radiant," said someone next to him.
        "Excuse me?" Arthur asked.
        "What's the hold up.  Pass me my popcorn and hot dog."  The man 
sitting next to him was an older man, greying hair, and was sporting the 
beginnings of a beer belly.
        Arthur passed him the food.  His hands were all greasy now and he 
wiped them on his pants.  He noticed the stick was in his lap.
        "GO CUBS!" the man next to him yelled.  Arthur realized then that he 
was in the bleachers of a baseball stadium.  People were out on the field 
standing around.
        "Do they ever move?" Arthur asked.
        "Why sure they do!" the old man laughed.  "Someone has to hit the 
ball first."
        "Oh."  Arthur looked around the stadium.  It was filled with 
people.  They were all screaming and making noise.  But the players on field 
just stood there.  "Are you Dexter?"
        "Dexter's the name, if it's all the same," he laughed.
        "Good.  I think I'm supposed to meet you.  I think.  Everything is 
really strange and I don't understand any of it."
        "You are right there.  Everything is really strange indeed," Dexter 
turned to Arthur.  "It all went wrong somewhere."
        "What went all wrong?  Where?"
        "Nothing has been the same since Roswell."
        "Roswell?"
        "Yeah.  Roswell.  But they weren't aliens.  They were something 
else."
        "Not aliens," Arthur nodded as if that actually meant something to 
him.  This was getting ridiculous.  He looked out at the field.  Someone was 
actually moving - running from one little white thing to another.
        "Wait a minute," Arthur glanced at Dexter.  "I don't know much about 
baseball, but isn't there a strike going on?  Isn't this the major leagues?  
This shouldn't be happening, should it?"
        Dexter looked at him with sad eyes and sighed.  "Oh dear.  I'm 
sorry."  And then Dexter shrugged.


        His eyes flashed open at the glowing white dots as they rushed by.  
Arthur growled at himself in the darkness.  He should not have fallen 
asleep.  Especially not when he was driving.
        The pain in his . . .  Arthur looked around.  He didn't need to go 
to the bathroom.  That was strange.  Just a few moments ago he . . .
        Arthur took a deep breath.  He passed another exit.  He did not 
need to go, but he felt like he should have turned down it.  Or, more 
correctly, he thought he already had.  Strange images of a girl and an old 
man drifted in his head.  They did not seem to fit anywhere.  He shrugged 
his shoulders.
        He glanced down at the passenger seat.  A stick lay in it.  His 
heart gave one loud pound that rattled his eardrums.  The stick.  If the 
stick was true . . .  Memories flooded back.  Strange things.  Things he 
could not explain, even though he spent the whole trip back home going over 
them in his mind.


        Arthur stretched his arms and his legs as far as they would go.  The 
sheets were nice and soft and there was a large, warm mass next to him.  He 
opened his eyes to the white, spackled ceiling and smiled.
        "Good morning," his wife turned over next to him.  Her heart-shaped 
face gave him a sleepy smile.
        "Morning honey," he grinned and Mary kissed him.  "Sorry to come in 
so late last night."
        "It wasn't that late," she sat up and laid her head on his chest.
        "It must have been very late," he shook his head and began to stroke 
her hair
        "No.  I remember hearing you come in and I looked at the clock and 
it was 12:14 exactly."
        "Exactly," he chuckled.  "If you were up, why didn't you say hello 
to me?"
        "I went to sleep.  If I would have been awake when you got to bed we 
would have talked all night and you would have been late for work."
        "Don't be so sure that we would have just talked."  Mary moved her 
head to look at him.
        "Why is there a stick on the night table?" she asked.  Arthur's 
heart thumped.  He looked at the night table.  There was the stick.  It was 
all there again.  The movie house, the girl, the old man, and that creep 
Moorehead.  He took a deep breath.
        "Uh . . . the Nova broke down just outside of town and I was trying 
to fix it and . . ."
        "You tried to fix the car with a piece of wood?" she sat up.
        "Yeah.  Best thing to use.  And it worked didn't it?" he grinned and 
sat up.  "Can we play 'feel the pacemaker'?"
        She rolled her eyes and tried to hide a grin.  "I suppose so . . ."
        "Good." he said and grabbed her right breast.
        "The pacemaker, as well as the heart, are on the other side," she 
rolled her eyes again.
        "Oh, sorry!" he grabbed the right breast with his other hand.  
Needless to say, he was late for work.


        That day at work was terrible.  His father-in-law had not liked the 
idea of the conference from the start.  "It's a God damned complete waste of 
time.  Who in the hell cares what other God dammed editors do with their God 
damned rags.  I have a business to run here and that don't include you 
gallivanting off to the big city!"
        Big city!  Little Rock?  Arthur wanted to educate old James Jayston 
on a few of the realities of life, but he though better of it.  And Jayston 
ran the Searcy Gazetteer at a constant loss, anyway.  It was just a big tax 
write-off to him.  Why should he care about it?  He didn't want it to make 
money.  If it actually showed a profit he would loose money.
        The fifth screaming session of the morning sent Arthur stomping back 
into his cramped office.  Mrs. Oglesvie, his secretary who was far too large 
to share the office with, handed him a yellow piece of paper.  It had that 
sticky stuff on the back.  He hated that stick stuff.  It was of no use.  It 
held the note to a surface for two seconds.  After that it was just a mess 
that got your fingers nasty.  He glanced over it.  It read:
        "Arthur.  Meet me at the Searcy Zeppelinport.  Dex."
        Arthur reread the note.  It still said the same thing.
        "Mrs. Oglesvie.  What is this?" he asked.
        "A note," she said without looking at him.  "It was stuck to the 
phone when I got back from my coffee break.  Don't know who wrote it.  No 
time or number or nothing."
        "That's okay."  He sat down at his desk and stared at the note.  
Zeppelinport?  What in the hell was that?  An airport?  They don't make 
zep . . .  He cut himself off.  He was not sure why, but he did.  He stood 
up.
        "Mrs. Oglesvie, I'm going to the municipal airport."
        "Why?" she looked at him.  "Has there been a crash?  Should I tell 
Gary to go get his camera?"
        "Oh no.  Nothing like that.  I'm just . . . following a lead."
        "Oh." she turned away.  "Could you pick me up some bear claw's as 
Sue's Bakery while you're gone?"


        The blue Nova struggled its way up the road.  Arthur could see the 
control tower over the trees.  Not a very tall tower, but it did it's job.  
Various antennae and dishes poked out on top of it, mostly instruments for 
NOAA.
        He passed several small hangers.  Outside of them were various prop 
planes.  Cessnas, Pipers, and Beechcrafts.  Or Beechnut, as his wife called 
them.  Nobody was around.
        At the end of the runway was a small shack.  Something for 
utilities, perhaps.  The Nova pulled up outside of it and Arthur stopped the 
car.  He did not know why it was the shack.  Perhaps it was supposed to be 
the shack.  But he did not know for sure.  But he wanted it to be the shack, 
if that meant anything.
        He stepped out and opened the flimsy wood door.  There was Dexter 
with a pair of binoculars around his neck.
        "Ready to do some Zeppelin spotting today?"  Arthur's mind raced 
with questions.  But he forced them aside.
        "Sure."
        "I hear there is quite a crowd gathering to watch."  Dexter walked 
out of the shack.
        "Where?"
        "Right there," Dexter pointed down the runway.  Near the control 
tower a mass of people had gathered.  Just outside the huge metal hanger.  
It must have been several hundred yard long.  Arthur blinked several times, 
but it remained.
        "I . . ."
        "Here she comes!" he put the binoculars to his face.  Arthur looked, 
but could see nothing.  He glanced back at the crowd.  Women were holding up 
parasols.  Parasols?
        "Looky that!  Here, use the binoculars."  Dexter handed them to him.
        Arthur looked through them.  Sky.  Clouds.  Trees.  Zeppelin.  Sky.  
Zeppelin?
        It was huge.  It was very far away.  But he could see it's shadow on 
one of the hills.  A huge cigar shaped silver thing.  And a big swastika on 
the back.
        "Nazis?" he turned to Dexter.
        "Nah.  We don't call them that anymore," Dexter smiled.  "Democratic 
socialists.  You see, the Hindenburg was only a plot.  Hitler had it blown 
up."
        "A plot?  Hitler?"  The zeppelin was getting closer.  He could make 
it out with the naked eye now.
        "He saw that zeppelins could be a big threat to the Third Reich if 
other countries used them for troop and supply transport.  So he had it 
blown up right on American soil, right in front of reporters and cameras.  
Scared the shit out of the American people.  As soon as the war ended, 
Hitler started building them again."
        "War ended?  Hitler?"
        "Yeah.  After he won.  You know." Dexter looked at him strangely.
        "Yeah,"  Arthur nodded slowly.  "After he won."
        "Good," Dexter slapped him on the back.  "Come on.  This is a big 
day.  It's not every day that a zeppelin comes to Searcy.  We aren't on the 
main route.  Let's go get some beer and sauerkraut.  Das ist gut, ja?"
        Arthur's elementary German could handle that and he nodded.  They 
made there way to several tables laden with food and drink.  An oompah band 
was setting up outside of a hanger that housed commercial Messerschmidt prop 
planes.
        Dexter handed him a mug of beer.
        Arthur looked at him.  "What's going on?"
        "A celebration!  A party!" Dexter laughed, then his expression 
changed as he looked at Arthur.  "Sorry, sometimes I loose myself in these 
things."
        "What things?"
        "Things, you know," Dexter waved his hands around.
        "Dexter, there is a Nazi zeppelin bearing down on my home town right 
at this very instant.  I want to know what the hell is going on."
        Dexter smiled.  "You've entered my universe.  Just agree with me, 
and everything will go smoothly."
        "Universe?"
        Dexter took a swig of beer.  "Okay.  There are three universes.  My 
universe.  Your universe.  Then everybody else's universe.  You live in 
everybody else's universe.  You barely get to see your own universe.  But 
you are getting a chance to see mine.  Neat, huh?"
        Arthur looked at the beer mug in his hand.  It was still full.  He 
could not have possibly gotten drunk yet.  So why was he seeing zeppelins?
        "I see you don't understand.  Okay.  You have your universe.  That's 
totally different than anybody else's universe.  And everyone has their own 
universe.  But then there is everybody else's universe.  You see?  It's a 
mesh of everybody's universes all put together.  Kind of like a grand 
central station.  It's where everybody meets.  It's what people normally 
call reality."
        Somewhere inside of him it clicked, but not at any area near the 
surface of his consciousness.  It had something to do with philosophy and 
religion, but this was something else.  This was actually happening!
        "What has this got to do with anything?" Arthur cried.  "What does 
this have to do with the movie house and the girl and what you said about 
Roswell?"
        "Oh, Roswell," Dexter took a sip of his beer.  "That was my fault.  
Back when I was a kid I was living in the southwest.  I had read H. G. Wells 
and stuff and really wanted there to be aliens.  Martians.  I wanted them so 
bad that it bled over into the real universe and aliens crash landed.  Boy 
was the Council pissed."  He took another sip of beer.
        "What do you mean?  What council?"
        "The Council of Powers.  They did their best to clean it up.  Erased 
it from history and everything.  But people don't forget things like that - 
even when they have been erased."
        "What Council?  What are the Powers?"  Arthur was getting desperate.  
He took a sip of beer.
        "The Council.  Of Powers.  I was a Power.  Not back when Roswell 
happened, of course.  But they saw that I had the Power and so they let me 
be a Power.  I kind of messed up, though."
        Arthur scratched his head.  "Messed up how?"
        "That whole World War Two thing," she sighed.
        "You mean the Nazi zeppelin?"
        "No," he smiled.  "This is just for fun.  I mean the real World War 
Two.  The one you are familiar with.  The one I messed up."
        Arthur shook his head.  This was not getting anywhere.  But maybe if 
he played along.  "How did you mess it up?"
        "Well, your World War Two isn't the right one.  You see, my father 
died during the Invasion of Japan.  There was an Invasion of Japan, you 
know."
        "With the bombs?"
        "No.  The nukes came after.  No.  They came before.  Well, it depend 
on how you look at it.  You see, they didn't have nukes back then."
        "They had two, didn't they?"
        "No.  None.  And they wouldn't have had any for another two hundred 
years.
        "Huh?"
        Dexter gulped half of his beer down.  "You see, the Pacific theater 
was really nasty.  It took years to finally conquer Japan and millions of 
men died.  My father died in 1947 in the third wave.  It wasn't until 1953 
that Japan finally surrendered.  Actually, they didn't surrender.  There was 
just no one left to fight.  Then the Americans and Russians started fighting 
over China.  Then over Europe.  World War Two didn't really ever end.  Well, 
I guess it would have ended eventually."
        "You mean, in your universe,"  Arthur nodded.  He was sure he was 
understanding it all now.
        "No.  In the real universe.  The one you live in.  After I became a 
Power with the Seat of Time, I did a few things.  A few very powerful 
things.  Things that the Council wasn't even aware of.  I went back in time 
and gave a fellow named Einstein what he needed to build a nuclear weapon. 
Just the idea, really.  He figured it out for himself - and he never really 
knew that anyone had given him the information."
        "So wait a minute.  The bomb was built.  It didn't happen any other 
way."
        "Well, you see, my father died in the invasion.  I wanted him back, 
so I fixed it so he would still be alive.  The council didn't even catch on 
for a while.  But when they figured it out, boy were they mad.  That's why I 
got kicked out."
        Arthur looked at the Zeppelin.  It was much closer.  It was huge.  
The crowd was cheering.
        "I don't really understand."
        "I don't really either," Dexter finished his beer.  "I get banished 
from reality and get locked in my own universe.  I can only peek out under 
special circumstances."
        "Like what?"
        "Like with this deal with you.  It's very hush hush.  Only half the 
council is in on it."
        "What deal with me?"  Arthur was at his wits end.  But it had 
something to do with him.  So perhaps he could understand it.
        "What I did was so big that it screwed up everything.  Not even the 
Council could fix it without having to rework the fabric of the universe.  
Big.  I didn't realize how big.  And now everything is botched because of 
technology.  Half the council wants to throw it out."
        "Throw out technology?" Arthur shook his head.  Perhaps he would not 
understand this after all.
        "Yeah.  Go back to the way it was originally.  Magic.  You know.  
Hocus Pocus?  The Council is split fifty-fifty.  Except for the Seat of 
Time."
        "Your seat?"
        "Not any more.  The girl.  Annakie.  She has got it now.  The way it 
is set up, half the Council is pro-magic, and half the Council is 
pro-technology.  Annakie will make the deciding vote, and they already know 
she is a namby-pamby pro-magicer.  Giving a little girl a seat.  A little 
girl who loves unicorns and pegasi!  Pah!  Talk about tipping the scales of 
justice.  She is real young, though.  Real inexperienced.  You have already 
seen how easy she can be manipulated."
        "How?"
        "She delivered the message to you herself," he laughed.  "The 
message for her own demise."
        "Demise?  What do you mean?"
        "You are going to kill her and take her place on the Council as the 
Power on the Seat of Time."
        Arthur dropped his mug.  It crashed to the ground.  Suddenly, 
darkness enveloped him.  He looked up.  The zeppelin was overhead.  It was 
huge.  One of the largest structures he had even seen.  And it was floating 
above him.
        "What do you mean 'kill her?!'" he screamed over the oompah band's o
ompahing.
        "Kill.  A non-Power can kill a Power.  You just find their body and 
kill it.  And she has to be killed or technology will vanish.  Where would 
your wife be without technology?"
        Arthur squeezed his eyes shut.  The blood was pounding in his head.  
He refused to believe any of this was happening.


        The flimsy door to the shack swung open.  A few fire extinguishers, 
some rope, and a trash can.  Arthur peered inside.  No one.
        He looked around.  The sky was clear.  A few birds overhead.  High 
above the clouds there was a glint of metal.  A plane.  A military plane.  
He knew why it was here.  The hills were littered with nuclear missile 
silos.  The planes kept watch.  Exactly what for, Arthur never knew.
        But no zeppelin.  No oompah band.  No ladies with parasols.  No 
Dexter.  And no command to kill a fourteen year old girl.  He got into the 
Nova and drove away.
        His wife's sweet face came to his mind.  And the pacemaker that kept 
her heart beating rhythmically.  Without the unholy thing it would flutter 
and fail.  Like it had done before.  So many times before.  And the girl's 
face came to his mind as well.


        Mrs. Oglesvie was upset that he had not returned with the bear claws 
so she left without notice.  It would be just as well.  Arthur would have 
time to think alone.  He pulled a cigarette from his drawer and lit it.
        He loaded up his communications software into the  computer.  A 
mouse click here and a mouse click there connected him with the on-line 
service.  The headlines stared back at him on the opening screen.  It was 
the anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima and a large protest had been 
held there.  North Korea was ranting about nuclear inspections.  And another 
sizable chunk of nuclear material had been seized in Germany.  Destination 
unknown, but the source was Russia.
        Was all of it real?  Really real?  Or was it Dexter's dream imposed 
on everyone else to save his father.  Or was Arthur going insane?
        He checked his mail box.  It was crammed with electronic 
advertisements, a few of the newsletters that he subscribed to, and a 
rejection from an electronic magazine that he had sent a short story to.  
Arthur sighed and began flipping randomly through the system out of boredom 
while taking puffs on his cigarette.
        The on-line Omni had several interesting articles about Ufos.  One 
was about the cover-up at Roswell.  The dead alien bodies were stored 
somewhere in Northern California, and the surviving alien was teaching 
astrophysics at Berkeley.  Normally he would have smiled at reading such a 
thing, but he could not find the motivation.
        He continued to randomly flip through menus and ended up at the 
User's Directory.  He absent-mindedly typed in "Annakie Webber."  The system 
sputtered a bit and shot the name back.  There was an Annakie Webber.  She 
lived in Sherman, Texas.  And she liked horses and fantasy books and her 
favorite author was Marion Zimmer Bradley.
        The screen stared back at him for some time.  She was real.  And she 
liked fantasy.
        The chair seemed to swirl about, making him dizzy.  Was it true?  Or 
was he just in some alternate universe where he wanted it to be true?  He 
stared at the name.  He disagreed with it.  He squinted his eyes and 
disagreed with it harder.  But it was still there.  It wasn't Dexter's 
doing.
        What if it was true?  What if all technology would cease?  What if 
the pacemaker in his wife's chest stopped?  Perhaps he could talk to the 
girl.  Change her mind.
        He glanced over her dossier and shook his head.  It was firmly 
entrenched in fantasy.  She seemed to spend all her time on the system doing 
something fantasy related.  She even belong to some medieval group called 
the Society for Creative Anachronisms.  He had heard of it.  Strange people 
that dressed up in strange costumes who would go off and live in the woods 
in pavilions over the weekend.  Not a good sign.
        But what happened if magic suddenly ruled the land.  Perhaps magic 
could save his wife.  But could it?  Would Dexter would know?
        The computer beeped.  A line was flashing.  Someone on the network 
was requesting a chat.  He accepted it.
        A window opened up.  He looked at it.  Nothing was being written on 
the other side.  Several seconds later text began to show up.
        "Sorry about the delay," the screen said.  "The moon is pretty far.  
Speed of light and all that."
        "Hello?" Arthur typed.  "Who are you?"
        More delay.  Then, "Dexter, of course.<G>"
        "Where are you?" he typed.
        "<LOL>  I told you.  On the moon.  Tranquility Facility, actually."
        "What?"
        "There you go again.  Everything progressed quickly after the 
Russians landed at Mare Fecunditatus in 68'.  We had to bust our asses to 
set up a base of our own.  Luckily Grissom, Borman, and McDivitt made it 
there safely and set up the missile emplacements.  God knows what would have 
happened if we had let it go unchallenged."
        Arthur stared at the screen.  Somehow it appeared different.  It was 
rounder - not square.  And the label said "Atari", not "IBM" like it was 
supposed to.
        "Oh," he typed.  "I want to ask you about . . . the magic."  He took 
a puff on the cigarette.  Something was wrong with it.  It wasn't tobacco.  
It tasted like burning wood.  And there was no nicotine in it.
        "What about the nasty stuff?" Dexeter's type appeared.
        "If the magic comes, can't the magic be used to fix the problems 
that happen when technology disappears?"  He felt stupid for asking the 
question.  The whole thing seemed stupid.  Insane.
        "The Council of Powers already has the plan.  Technology will cease 
to function.  All computers will die.  Radio won't work.  Nothing above a 
simple pulley mechanism will survive.  And then the magic will come in.  
Gradually,  over a period of time, people will learn how to use it.  Only 
those who know how to use it will gain any benefit.  And since no one 
expects what will happen, no one can prepare.  At midnight tonight, the 
world will end."
        Arthur blinked.  Midnight.  Not enough time.
        "Why can't you do something about it?  You can control time," he 
typed.
        "Time may be an important factor to you, but it is only a minor 
concern to the Council.  There are far more powerful things.  I have no 
power in this matter.  It is up to you."
        A tear welled up in his eye.  Arthur refused to believe in it.  It 
could not be.  He banished Dexter.


        The computer beeped.  A message flashed that someone on the computer 
network wanted to chat with him.  He accepted.
        "Table man!  I didn't know you were one this network," the screen 
blurted.  Arthur's eyes widened.
        "Moorehead?" he typed slowly.
        "Yeah, it's wonderful me!  We had a wonderful time without you at 
the conference.  You were dragging everybody down."
        "Fuck off, Moorehead," he typed and yanked the plug out of the wall.  
His blood has boiling.  His head was hot.  A fever.  He was sick.  That 
would explain it.  Something was in his lap.  He looked down.  There was the 
stick.
        Mrs. Oglesvie walked in the office holding a coffee mug and a white 
paper bag filled with bear claw's.  They were warm and they filled the 
office with their sweet scent.  Arthur breathed deeply and swiveled his 
chair toward her.
        "I need to find an address of someone living in Sherman, Texas," he 
said.  She sat down and did not look at him.
        "The library has phone books from all over.  Why not check there."  
She pulled out a bear claw and took a big bite.
        He swiveled his chair back to his desk.  Like the screen of an old 
ATM monitor, fuzzy text appeared on the computer screen:
        "Table, Mary will die."  It faded slowly away.


        The sun was setting right into his eyes.  Arthur pulled down the sun 
shade but it did not help.  Finally the interstate curved positioned the sun 
behind an eighteen wheeler.
        The address had taken an hour to find.  His father-in-law had 
tracked him down to the library.  Veins were bulging in his neck.  Before 
the man could speak a work, Arthur told him to fuck off.  That had shut him 
up.  And perhaps it had cost Arthur his job as well.
        The address was on a little piece of paper on the dashboard in front 
of him.  One of those nasty yellow things with the sticky crap on the back.  
It was the only thing he could find.
        He still could not think about it.  He was going to some one horse 
town in Texas.  For no real reason.  Perhaps he would just look around.  
Then leave.  Or maybe he would drive by the Webber house.  The only Webbers 
who lived in Sherman.
        That was what he would do.  Arthur glanced down at the passenger 
seat.  There lay a hypodermic needle and a bottle of insulin.  An overdose 
of insulin would kill a person dead.  And it was very hard to trace.  He had 
snuck the bottle from his wife's supply.  She had enough for several months, 
at least.
        No, he was not going to Sherman for any reason.  Just to drive 
around.  Look at the sights.  Then he would go home.  He would do nothing.
        The needle was not one of those small kinds that Mary used.  It had 
a big, wide chamber that could suck up the entire contents of the insulin 
bottle.  The little ones wouldn't do the job.
        What was in Sherman, anyway?  It was probably just like Searcy.  
Nothing.  Nobody.  Just people that time had left behind somewhere.  But 
Dallas was nearby.  Perhaps he could stop off at the Book Depository 
Building and look at the grassy knoll.  Kennedy had been assassinated, 
hadn't he?  Or course he had.  This was the real world.
        Her mouth would be soft and warm when he clamped his hand over it 
and jabbed the needle into her neck.  Would it take long?  Would she scream?  
She would look into his eyes.  Most definitely.  She would look into his 
eyes.
        He pulled the car over onto the shoulder and jumped out of the car.  
He ran.  He ran across the access road, jumped a fence, and ran out into a 
pasture.  The land was flat.  As far as the eye could see.  A few clumps of 
trees dotted here and there, but that was about it.  He stopped running and 
bent over, heaving.
        "Dexter!" he straightened up.  "Dexter!  I refuse to do this.  Do 
you hear me!  I refuse."
        A rabbit ran by him.  Well, not quite a rabbit.  Something like a 
rabbit.
        "Damn."  Arthur hear something behind him.  It was Arthur.  In a 
loin cloth.  Carrying a spear with a flint head.
        "I won't do it,"  Arthur crossed his arms.
        "My dinner just got away," Dexter panted and leaned on his spear.  
"The tribe will go hungry tonight."
        Arthur did not have time for this.  "I don't have time for this."
        "Things haven't been the same since Kulet killed Og," Dexter looked 
at him and smiled.
        "Listen, I don't want to talk about this.  I refuse to kill her.  
I'm not going to do it.  Do you understand?"
        "Og was the one who thought of planting seeds.  But Kulet killed him 
before he could tell anyone.  Things just haven't gone smoothly for humanity 
since.  Have they?"
        "Are you listening to me?" Arthur barked.
        "Without that one spark of brilliance, we never could get organized 
enough to even wipe out the mammoths," Dexter pointed to the horizon.  
Arthur saw large, dark shapes moving against it.  Low, distant noises 
flittered through the wind to his ear.
        "What happens if I kill her?  She will be dead.  I will go to 
prison - and rightly so.  I don't have even have a good excuse.  Son of Sam 
had the dog tell him to do it.  What do I have?  Some old man with a beer 
belly dressed up in a loin cloth.  And what will change if I don't?  
Nothing.  Can you tell me of anything that will change if she lives?"
        "Do you really want to see?" Dexter eyed him.  Dexter's blood 
chilled and he shivered.
        "Yes.  Show me."


        They were outside of his house.  The houses were scattered out at 
this distance from Searcy's center.  Each house had a lot the size of an 
acre.  And all filled with trees.  Lots of thin, dark trunked, pine trees.  
The lights on the house were on and the Mercedes sat outside.  Long ago the 
garage had been converted into a children's bedroom.  A bedroom that they 
had never needed.
        "Look at your watch," Dexter told him.  Arthur looked down and 
squeezed the light button.
        "Eleven fifty-nine.  No.  Twelve."  The house went dark.  A scream 
echoed throughout the house.  Then silence.
        Bam-bam.  His heart almost blasted out from his chest.  He started 
running he couldn't think.  He ran to the house.  This couldn't be 
happening.  It couldn't.  It couldn't.


        He leapt over the fence and ran.  Something caught his foot and he 
stumbled.  Arthur looked back.  It was the stick.  It came into his hands 
and he walked back to the car.


        Sherman was different than he imagined.  It was more spread out.  It 
was filled with large plants.  Big companies.  He wondered if it was cheaper 
for them out here, away from the big city and less taxes.
        It was dark.  He turned down a farm road.  It was called a farm 
road, but he could not see any farms.  Housing developments.  A pasture of 
two.  Then he drove by a large factory.  It stank.  It stank just like 
burned coffee.  It was a coffee plant.
        He turned down a street.  It could have been any street.  In any 
suburb.  Anywhere in America.  Except maybe for the wagon wheel decorations 
on the lawn and the high flying Texas flags that flapped from every other 
house.
        There it was.  He could not breath.  The Webber house.  Green with 
little wooden duckies on the lawn.  And a curved driveway.  He parked his 
car across the street from it grabbed for the insulin.  The stick came to 
his hand instead.
        Arthur looked at it and closed his eyes.  None of this is happening, 
the thought, and opened his eyes.  He was still in Sherman.  It was still 
night.  He was still across the street from the Webber house.
        He snatched up the insulin and the needle and exited the car.  The 
door he left open.  No reason to make noise shutting it.
        The flicker of the street lamp gave him enough light to safely make 
it up to the house.  The grass was wet on his shoes.  He walked up to the 
front door.
        Stupid.  Just knock on the door and ask for Annakie.  Right.  He 
shook his head and looked at the side of the house.  It was dark.  Everyone 
must be asleep.
        His legs began to tremble as he made his way around the windows.  
What was he doing?  Perhaps he was here just to talk.  He rolled the insulin 
bottle around in his hand.
        None of the window curtains were fully closed.  He peered in one.  W
as that a couch he saw?  A living room?
        The next was a small window.  A dim light came from it.  The 
kitchen.  He could see the sink just below him and the counters.  A light 
was coming from the refrigerator.  It was one of those kinds that had a 
water and ice nook in the door.  Papers were stuck on the front, but he 
could not see what was on them.  But he could imagine.  Cute little crayon 
drawings.  A tear came and he wiped it on his sleeve.
        Between the side of the house and the side of the next door 
neighbor's house was another window.  He peered in.  It was dark.  But he 
could see a sparkle on the wall.  Was it glitter?
        It was paper.  Paper and glitter.  Rainbow glitter.  In the shape of 
a unicorn.  His chest tightened.  He was just here to talk.  The needle fell 
from his hand and he stooped to pick it up.
        The screen.  It needed to be removed.  He nervously stuck the 
insulin and needle into his windbreaker pocket and pulled out his keys.  
They jingled loudly.
        He stiffened so tight he thought he heard his spine crack.  Still.  
Arthur stood motionless.  Did she hear?  Nothing happened.  She must be 
still asleep.  A cigarette would have calmed his nerves, but this was not 
the time.
        He took one of the keys and pried at the screen.  It came off 
easily.  Too easily.  He had to catch it as it fell toward him.  Then he 
carefully set it on the ground and looked at the window.  Was it locked?
        A fourteen year old girl in a small town knows no fear.  No real 
fear, at least to his mind.  Annakie would not lock it.  She had never had a 
reason to.  She was a Power, after all.
        He stuck his fingernails at the bottom of the window and pulled up.  
It slid freely.  Cool, air-conditioned air blew in his face.
        He closed his eyes.  It was not happening.  He opened them.  The 
window was still there.  He could hear breathing.  Soft breathing.
        The window was difficult to climb through.  He scraped his leg on 
the sill as his slid in and dragged himself down to the floor.  The room 
slowly brightened as his eyes adjusted to the gloom.
        There was a smell of perfume.  Not a woman's perfume, but girl's.  
Cherry or strawberry.  A fruity smell.  Perhaps lip gloss.  He stood up.
        The wall were coved with posters.  Unicorns.  Dragons.  Pegasi.  All 
manner of magical beasts.  There was a mirror dresser with little bottles on 
it.  And pictures stuck to the mirror.  People.  Girls.  He could not make 
them out, though.
        Then he turned to the bed.  It was a canopied bed.  Some light 
color.  Perhaps pink, although he was not sure.  And there she was.  
Sleeping on her back.  An elaborate quilt over her.  A huge pillow under her 
head.
        He almost dropped the insulin bottle as he fumbled with it, removing 
it from his pocket.  He withdrew the hypo.  She was breathing gently.  
Completely unaware.
        Stop!  He screamed to himself.  The cap came off the needle 
smoothly.  Arthur inched closer to her.  His heart has pounding, 
reverberating through his body.
        Mary had asked him to help with her insulin occasionally.  Arthur 
always refused.  He could never bear to poke her with a needle.  He could 
not even bear to watch Mary inject herself.  But she would do it in front of 
him anyway, despite his protests.
        He thrust the needle at the cap of the insulin bottle and missed, 
jabbing his thumb.  Bone.  He yanked it out and crammed his thumb in his 
mouth to keep from yelling.
        Blood.  The coppery taste of blood filled his mouth.  His legs began 
to shake and he stopped inching toward her.  What would her parents say in 
the morning when they found her body?  Was her life worth Mary's?
        He ripped the question from his mind and yanked his thumb out of his 
mouth.  The needle went into the cap easily, and in the gloom he could sense 
the hypo filling up with the fluid.  The needle slid easily out of the 
bottle.  He crept up to the side of the bed.
        She moved slightly and Arthur froze.  The dark hair framed her white 
face, and the ruffles of the pillow gave the appearance that she was lying 
on a bed of flowers.  How beautiful she was.  How innocent.  Could she 
possibly be the source of all his problems?
        His hand reached out toward her, but he yanked it back.  Arthur 
could not touch her.  He just couldn't.  He would have to quickly jab her 
and inject her and run away.
        Her neck.  It was so smooth.  The vein leapt out at him.  Was that 
the best place for it?  Mary always put it in her belly.  But he could not 
bring himself to even thinking of doing that to Annakie.  The neck.  It had 
to be the neck.
        The needle slowly moved toward the vein.  Arthur closed his eyes and 
told himself none of this was happening.  When he opened them it still was.  
His heart began to pound.  His mind began to scream.
        "Stop me!" he screamed in his mind.  "Wake up and stop me!  Scream 
and call for your parents!  Stop me!"
        She didn't move.  The needle hovered over her skin.  Then he dropped 
the bottle of insulin.
        It hit her on the arm.  Her eyes flashed open and stared at him.  
But not in terror.  A smile came over her face and she shook her head.
        Annakie waggled her finger at him.  "I don't think so!"


        His eyes flashed open at the glowing white dots as they rushed by.  
Arthur growled at himself in the darkness.  He should not have fallen 
asleep.  Especially not when he was driving.
        But he had not been asleep.  And why was he looking for an exit?  
Arthur did not need to do anything.  He turned on the radio and smiled.  And 
he sang.
        I've been from Phoenix, Arizona,
        All the way to Tacoma,
        Philadelphia, Atlanta, L. A.,
        Northern California,
        Where the girls are warm,
        So I can here my sweet baby say . . .
        But where was he?  Where had he been?  Arthur recognized the area.  
He was on his way back home.  But where had he been?
        Perhaps he had went out driving.  But at night?  You can't see 
anything at night.  Where, then?  Phoenix, Arizona?
        He shrugged his shoulders.  Maybe he went nowhere.  Maybe he was 
picked up by aliens and had some anal probing done.  He smiled, but for some 
reason the smile faded.  Arthur looked down at the passenger seat.
        The stick.  His eyes screamed at it.  The stick.  And next to it, an 
empty insulin bottle.  His heart pounded.  Then he saw the hypo.  It was 
sitting there.  Full.
        He slammed the gas pedal and was pushed back in the seat.  The clock 
glued to the dashboard read 11:55.  His heart stopped, then blasted him, 
reverberating in his bones.


        The tires squealed as he turned off the main road, down his street.  
Then the car died.  He slammed on the brakes. And jumped out of the car.
        There was a hill just before the houses on his street.  An empty 
hill, full of trees.  He ran up it, gasping for air.  Stumbling, he reached 
the crest.  The houses came to view.  The lights were on.
        He ran.  He ran past the Baker's house.  The ran past the 
McCandley's two story place.  He panted up the road and jumped the ditch 
that lay between the road and his lawn.
        The light were still on.  He smiled.  It must be past midnight.  
Nothing had happened.  Then the lights went out.  A scream cracked the still 
night air.
        The blood in his temples screamed in unison.  He raced up the walk 
to the door.  It wouldn't open.  It was locked.  The keys were in the car.  
He banged on the door.  And again.  Nothing.
        The window.  He picked up a rock from the garden and threw it.  The 
glass smashed.  he ripped through the screen and flung himself inside.
        There she was.  In her blue housecoat.  Crumpled on the floor.  A 
broken coffee mug lay near a dark stain on the carpet.  He ran to her and 
gathered her up in his arms.
        Warm.  She was still warm.  Nose.  Her nose.  He held his hand in 
front of it.  Nothing.  He put his head to her chest.  Nothing.  He beat on 
her chest.  Nothing.
        Arthur laid her back on the floor.  Tilted her head back.  Blow.  
Pump.  Blow.  Pump.  He had studied CPR so much that it was a part of his 
being.  But nothing was happening.  Nothing at all.
        A minute passed.  Pump.  Blow.
        More minutes.  Pump.  Blow.
        Half and hour.  Pump. Blow.
        He was exhausted.  She was still dead.  He stopped and screamed.
        "Bastards!"
        A swirling motion began in the room.  It slowly took form in front 
of him.  A face.  A body.  Crooked shoulders.  The long nose.
        "Moorehead?"
        "The Power of the Seat of Death, if it's all the same," his eyes 
rolled upward into the back of his head and he let out the gurgle that had 
passed as a laugh for so many years.  "Since college, in fact.  Since then 
I've had my eye on you - and her."
        "No . . ." Arthur's jaw dropped.  The beady little eyes brightened.
        "Let go of her.  She's in my domain now.  There is nothing you can 
do," he gurgled. 
        Arthur refused to agree.  He refused to agree.  Never.  Never would 
he agree.  She was alive.  In his reality, she was alive.  She would always 
be alive.  What did the psychiatrists call that.  Denial?  They said it was 
wrong.  But it was the only right thing to do.  She would not die.  Never.  
Not now.
        Other universes.  The Real Universe.  Grand Central Station.  His 
mind spun about.  It had changed.  They had changed it.  Sweat poured from 
him and he leaned back on his heels.  Moorehead stopped gurgling and cocked 
his head.
        Deep inside him.  He felt it.  It had always been there.  But 
Council had forbidden it for so long.  He demanded it to come out.  It 
refused.  He coaxed it.  It was shiny and warm.  It was himself.
        Power filled him.  He looked down at his wife.  He could see inside 
her body.  The scared heart that had exploded.  The faulty glands.  The 
broken womb that had witnessed the death of a child.  And deeper.  Smaller 
but bigger.  The blueprints.  The errors.
        He took the Power.  He took the Power and fixed her.  Smoothed out 
the rough edges.  Mended the broken bits.  Then he called her.  Coaxed her 
out from hiding.  Out from whatever dark place she had retreated to.  Back 
to where he needed her.
        She opened her eyes.
        Tears streamed down his cheeks.
        "Are you okay?" she asked.  He reached down and hugged her.  With an 
angry hiss, Moorehead vanished, leaving a void filled with fullness.


        The walked out of the darkened house hand in hand.  The sky was 
brightening in the north.  She looked at him but he had no answers for her.  
Something rose from the tree tops.
        It was not the sun.  It was a great golden ball on fire.  The 
tendrils of flames coated it and shot forth from it, lighting the entire 
sky.  It did not seem to care that all the clocks said it was midnight.
        Arthur heard hoofs tromping through the pine needle littered ground.  
He turned to look.  It was Annakie, upon a unicorn with a glowing golden 
horn.
        "You see?" she tilted her head from side to side.  "It all turned 
out all right.  And you are the first."
        She then rode out of sight.  Not behind something, but into 
something.  Mary looked at him, but he still had no answers.
        They hugged each other and looked out at the horizon.  But there was 
none.  The land just kept on going.  The earth's curve no longer hid the 
land beyond.  The earth was now flat.
        A presence filled his mind.  It was Dexter, and Arthur smiled.  "It 
all turned out all right," Dexter's voice huffed.  "Yeah, sure.  Wait till 
you see what happens after this."
        He kissed Mary and they turned their eyes towards the stars.  But 
they were not stars any more.  They were silver fish swimming in a giant 
velvet ocean.  And nearby, sitting on a rock, was a cat.  A cat with golden 
glowing eyes, pawing at them.

                    MADGE'S MEDAL

                  by Franchot Lewis

          There was no honeymoon, because the day after we got married
     was a monday, and on Mondays, I had to go to work. Madge had to go
     to her job too. But that Sunday night of our wedding day, I'd planned
     to go to work on Madge. She was a sweet girl, a nice girl. We got
     married at noon in a church. Her mama and grand mama sang a hymn.
     Her father gave us a nice reception that went on all afternoon and
     into the early evening. So many of her relatives were in attendance
     and there were so many toasts.
          Madge sat on the bed rubbing her hand over the small medal of
     Jesus dangling from a silver chain around her neck. The silver figure
     of a hippy-headed Jesus that looked like a young Errol Flynn had a
     polished shine. She rubbed upwards over the flawlessly engraved nose
     and on, around the face. She then got off the bed, went and stood
     in front of the full-length mirror. She held the chain with
     reverence as an enormous sigh shook loose from her belly. She thrust
     her chest forward, causing the medal to bounce and swing from side
     to side. She then turned and returned to the bed where I, her newly-
     wedded husband, waited, wearing my fireman red wedding night briefs
     that she brought for me to wear. I'd prepared myself carefully in
     the bathroom [cologne, aftershave, a touch of musk, a tonic of
     ginseng root that I was told gave a man an extra measure of strength;
     not that I felt I would need it, I felt more than ready for Madge].
         I'd only a second before laid down on top of the sheets. My
     patient eyes zeroed in on the shining medal of Jesus [The face - the
     silver colored engraved eyes looked like little gleaming bumps].
         "This is Jesus, my good luck piece," Madge said. "Now, Honey,
     let's pray before we start our wedding night." She smiled as she
     pulled back the sheet and slid in to the bed with me. We prayed.
     After the prayer, I thrust my hips to hers and held us together.
     Using every bit of my strength, I pulled her closer, persistently,
     until the hard shining medal - pinching, scraping, grating - hurt
     my chest too much.
         "I hope I don't get permanent scars," I said softly. [Mumbled,
     maybe. Groaned. Muttered ...]
         "Oh, excuse me," she pulled away, politely.
         "What's that!" I asked. [Maybe barking, a little. Just a
     little.]
         "My Jesus? My medal?" she bitched. [Barked. Maybe asked just a
     little too annoyed.]
         I asked, "Are you going to keep it on?"
         "Yes," she answered, a little louder than I'd expected. "I don't
     take it off, not even in the shower."
         "We're not in the shower -"
         "Don't start raising your voice to me. Ever since the day I
     accepted my Lord and have been saved and have come to love Jesus
     very much I have worn this. This medal is something that will keep
     me in luck. I made a promise never to let it out of my possession."
         As she told me this, I started to remove her night gown. Her
     young breasts re-fired quickly my passion, and took my attention and
     caused my caressing hand to - 'Lord, have mercy!' [I may have
     mumbled this.]  - Oh, I had the intense desire to cover her breasts
     with my chest, and as I did, the brutal medal caused my chest pain.
     The medal was incredibly rough, like a claw, scratching my skin raw,
     causing a red bruise and pricking a small drop of blood. From that
     moment on I became determined to get her to remove the medal. She
     would not, and so, the wedding night was a night of misfortune, of
     me trying to embrace her and of me complaining about the medal.
     Eventually, I had to abandon the activities I had long planned and
     hoped for, for that night. My bride accused me of being only
     interested in carnal sex, and of caring more about carnal sex than
     having Jesus there to bless us and to watch over our marriage.
         I attempted a few times to remove the medal. She repeated that
     she would not take off the medal. "Not ever!" she snarled. [Yeah,
     like a dog. A certain female dog, I'm sorry to say.]
         I told her, I would not embrace her until she removed the medal.
     I said that being married didn't warranted being marred by that
     trinket of Jesus and given scars that would last for a life time.
        She got pissed, said I had an attitude, was being mean and was
     acting in a sinful, terrible way. "A groom doesn't act like you
     toward his bride, " she said with her own attitude. And, so, as
     I've stated, I gave up in despair.
        The strong, natural urge to consummate the marriage grew stronger.
     By the next day I was irritable and nervous. I believe I came to the
     edge of a nervous collapse. I even sought the help of a work buddy,
     an older man whose opinion I valued. I did not like what he had to
     say. He told me there was nothing he could advise, except I should
     snatch the medal from my wife's neck and get down to some immediate
     relief. He said, if I didn't take action I would definitely end up
     in a mental institution.
         That evening I was in the bathroom, breathing hard, aroused with
     intense carnal thoughts. My bride stretched to adjust the shower
     head.  I could see her clearly through the transparent curtains.
     She in the sensuous all-together - The shower water falling down, and
     around her fine, firm figure. She was a sight, excitingly good to
     to the eye to watch. Hanging down between her breasts, on the chain,
     was the medal of Jesus. That darn medal seemed to nip and tear
     another raw place in my skin as I watched my bride take a long
     shower. She scrubbed the cloth down her legs, stopping at her chins.
     Her bent butt with her broad hip bones made me scratch my head more
     and more, and yes, I said a little prayer to Heaven for help. Soon,
     she was out of the shower and standing on the bathroom floor mat,
     dripping, drying herself with my HIS of our set of HIS and HERS
     towels, and the medal of Jesus was dangling down on its chain. She
     rubbed her luscious body, pausing to stare at me. It looked obvious
     that she wanted to cuddled with me.
        "It is bizarre," she mumbled. She stroked her legs with the towel
     and I stroked the scalp of my head. My head began to feel thinning on
     the top as if hair was falling out from stress. I stared at the
     Jesus medal, at it glare, its reflection of bathroom's bare ceiling
     light. I could swear, I winced from the glare.
         "Stop being high and mighty," I said. [Maybe plead]. "Will you,
     long enough to permit me my husbandly duty? [I'er - maybe I put it a
     little plainer, like: 'let me have you, baby,' or 'come on, girl.']
         She surprised me, sounded as if she was hurting almost as much
     as I. "Stop being a jerk, you think I don't want you? But, I am
     your bride, not somebody to have her faith torn from around her neck
     just for your convenience." She looked more determined to resist
     removing the medal. She stood straight, her back straight, her
     breasts out. She let the long bath towel fall to the floor. She
     took a walk to the bedroom to her chest of drawers for underwear.
     She spent a full minute working a frilly trimmed pair of pink undies
     up and over her legs and her sexy hips. I scratched my head like
     crazy as my bride finally tugged the underwear in place. Naked with
     the exception of her drawers, Madge was now at her sexiest, and she
     wore a proud expression on her beautiful face. She stood before me,
     her husband. She was incredibly beautiful and she knew that I knew
     it. She stood up to me, her soft hands on her hips, her magnificent
     breasts bared and challenging, and that medal, that darn medal, like
     a weapon at the ready, resting on those bare, bodicious breasts.
         Suddenly, my hand darted out, took her arms and ... quick like a
     stroke of lightning, pulled her tightly to me. Anxious looks took
     over her face as I would not let her pull away. For a brief moment,
     neither she or I saw the blood that dripped from my chest at the
     point where the medal tore a small hole. My eyes must have looked
     glazed over during that moment. Her eyes kept widening. The small
     flow of blood ran down our [held closed together] chests and reached
     her drawers. My mind was busy, my body was shuddering, experiencing
     a strong kind of intense relief; then I stepped back and she broke
     loose and darted across the room away from me. As she moved away, I
     said softly, "There is a line nobody should have to cross. I saw
     what you were doing. Shall I apologize, no?"
         She started talking slowly, having much difficulty speaking.
     She was extremely tight. She saw the blood and the wound. The wound
     was still small, the blood was still bleeding out.
         "You actually want to hurt me?" she said.
         I said, "I don't."
         "Why do you?" she asked.
         "Wait a minute?" I said. "Do you have an idea what you do? You
     do things to me like -"
         Her eyes got fierce and bored into me. "Do you realize that you
     are crazy?"
         "Yes."
         "You actually admit it?"
         My eyes were wandering over her body. "I'm crazy about you, " I
     said.
         "I-I had to meet a man like you," she stammered. "That's the way
     I am."
        "And me," I said.
        "What are you going to do? Hurt me more?"
        "You don't know how much I love you. You don't know? I'm going to
     kiss you, squeeze you, hug you tight, never let you go." [Yes, I
     spoke like I was quoting from a love song.]
        "I'm bruised and you're bleeding ..." she said.
        I moved closer. "You're my wife, my WIFE. I'm going to squeeze
     you tight, get ready."
        "Wait!" she said. "Wait ..." She made the sign of the cross,
     removed the chain and laid the medal reverently on top of her chest
     of drawers.

 
 
The Lyric

                             THE LYRIC
                            by Ed Davis


         I met the Lyric in 1946.  She was only thirty years old, but she was
      already a lady with a colorful past.  She was born a vaudevillian and
      was converted to a nickelodeon, during the rush to spread the flickers
      over the country.  Her early years were highlighted with all the ups
      and downs of the times.  She experienced the last of the "Roaring
      Twenties" and had even passed through the madness of the depression.
         My Lyric was well past her teens when, on December seventh, she and
      all her people were thrust into the confusion of war.  She did her part
      as her people joined hands to fight the distant enemies.  Rubber
      drives, tin drives, glass drives, and steel drives were all initiated
      within her sheltering arms.
         War news, good and bad, flashed in stark black and white reality
      through her comforting interior.  Comedy, romance, and drama passed
      through her eyes for the entertainment of her beloved town.
         War bond drives, with live heroes in obligatory attendance, provided
      a tense counterpoint to the frivolity.  She never really forgot the
      serious nature of the peril which had taken her young people away.  Her
      shiny black exterior seemed to mourn the deaths that were chronicled in
      her nightly displays.  Even the recounting of V.E. Day and V.J. Day
      seemed anticlimactic, after the hell of war.
         My first meeting with Lyric was on a Saturday afternoon.  Her vast
      interior was filled with seats.  Soft lights reflected warmly from her
      sides.  Her big heart was in repose behind heavy curtains.  Those
      curtains covered one whole end of her.  The lady had an enormous heart.
         She was filled with children, as usual.  I felt lost, and a
      stranger.  I do not recall a Saturday when she was not filled with
      eager children.  She swiftly took me to her breast.  I felt welcome.
         We children always expected, and received, her best.  We were
      amused, excited, inspired, and sometimes terrified, by the scenes she
      unveiled.  When her interior was lighted again, however, she cherished
      us with love and the security of a familiar place.  We felt free to
      explore the world, wrapped safely within the care and protection she
      gave.  Our lady introduced honor into our lives.  She persuaded us to
      laugh, despite our teacher's solemnity and the approaching terror of
      growing up.  We cried and laughed together in her protective darkness,
      and failed to notice that she was growing older.  Maybe we missed her
      decline because we moved further away from the flashing images she
      revealed.  Younger children rushed to take our places up front, as the
      process of maturing allowed us to take a broader view.  My memories
      were not memories yet.
         I did not achieve that step in maturing until 1964, when I returned
      home, and learned that the Lyric was closed.  I was stunned.  Memories
      washed over me in waves.  The smell of popcorn...  The bite of Coke,
      freshly splashed over ice...  The enormity of a ten cent Sugar Daddy...
      Eager faces lighted by the strobing light, reflecting from her radiant
      heart...  The tingle of waiting for "The Thing" to appear...  The feel
      of her carpet, new again under my small feet, as my child's memory ran
      down her beckoning aisle.
         I recalled childhood friends, some dead now, throwing popcorn
      bullets and candy wrapper grenades, at a variety of bad guys.  I
      mourned the loss of another friend.  Rest well old friend, you were
      never a mother, but you delivered me and my friends from childhood to
      maturity.  God bless you.
         I persuaded the owner of the jewelry store that now fills her lobby
      to allow me to take a peek out back.  He obliged.
         Her seats were stacked together in random piles, her exit signs were
      broken, and the exits themselves were boarded over with raw lumber.
         As I strained to see in the half light, her heart was still visible.
      I will forever recall the lessons she had flashed into my mind.  John
      Wayne, in his myriad roles, reminding me of Dad.  Beautiful women,
      their radiance dulled now by time.  Walt Disney magic.  The Buck Rogers
      serials, Star Wars in diapers.  Tarzan and his simian companion.  All
      the western morality plays.
         My memories will stay.  Just as surely, my vision will fade.  She
      even taught me to accept that finality.  I have never entered another
      theater, since that day, without thinking of her.  I never will.
         My vision faded that day.  I was wiping tears away, as I left, and
      felt no shame.

Natalie, those children are calling for you
-------------------------------------------

Natalie, those children are calling for you
those smiling eyes
those unlined faces
Innocence is excusable
        Eyes cannot shine forever against
what I know
        Children crack
like porcelain dolls
and babies grow raggedy-
limp from hunger
        I stand on your front step
like a puppet-master
of broken marionettes
hoping that you never will see
a rotten limb
a knotted fist
a painted grimace

In the beginning
they were created equal
two halves of a whole
or so they say.
Then the two became as one

Where's Laura?
With him, came the reply.

As the years moved on
their lives intertwined
From there union formed
another, and then one more
A life complete; a family.

Where's Laura?
With them, came the reply.

Tucking them in; a nightly read
just one of many routines
Wide-eyed with wonder
they listen to the fairy tales
she once believed.

Where's Laura?
Withdrawn, came the reply.

A vacant stare left undisturbed
by the passing of the years
Forlorn, she felt forgotten
He, an outsider to her grief
from him she withdrew..

Where's Laura?
Without, came the reply.

Came a time when night was day
and chaos ruled supreme
there was to be a single crushing blow
from the rubble came a sign
Lady Hawk, her spirits rose

Where's Laura?
Within, came the reply.

She laughed.

Turn away
by J. Guenther

[DON'T LOOK AT ME
DON'T SPEAK TO ME
DON'T TALK TO ME
DON'T THINK OF ME]

please, I'm standing here for you
and i want to talk to you
but please don't turn away from me--
i still need you!

[DON'T SMILE AT ME
DON'T WHISPER TO ME
DON'T WALK TO ME
DON'T WRITE TO ME]

listen to my heart as it trembles
as you turn your deaf & mute head away!
i still need you tonight
to hear my words!

[DON'T LISTEN TO ME
DON'T INSULT ME
DON'T REMIND ME
JUST LEAVE ME]

depth of pain, have mercy!
i see your reflection, but like a vampire,
its host has vanished into air
and left a soulless shell to do its deed.

[DON'T TALK TO ME
DON'T STAY BY ME
PLEASE DON'T LIVE BY ME
AND PLEASE DON'T LOVE ME]

i don't

[PLEASE DON'T LOVE ME]

i said i don't

[PLEASE DON'T LOVE ME]

i promise i won't

[JUST LEAVE ME]

 
 
Eternity
Copyright (c) 1994, Sean Donahue

I was lost and wandering,
Wondering what to do.
Looking for another,
but running into you.
 
Each day with out you is ETERNITY.
ETERNITY without you.
My love is meaningless,
without your soft caress.
ETERNITY, without you.
 
As I get up to apologize,
you say you're sorry too.
And as I gaze into your eyes,
I wonder who are you.
 
Each day with out you is ETERNITY.
ETERNITY without you.
My love is meaningless,
without your soft caress.
ETERNITY, without you.
 
We sat and talked for awhile,
and then you went away.
The feelings that I have now,
are the same I had that day.
 
But I left a book with my name,
today your looking fine.
We got together and had some fun.
And now your love is mine.
 
Each day with you is Eternity.
Eternity with you,
my love to share with no other,
But Eternity with you.
Eternity!

"A Bum Walked Up To Me And Said..."
Copyright (c) 1994, Bruce Diamond
All rights reserved



                      "A Bum Walked Up To Me And Said,
                    'I Haven't Had A Byte In Three Days.'
                         So I Gave Him A Computer."
                                     by
                                Bruce Diamond


      My friend, Rick, the stand-up comic, told me the other day he just
landed a gig at some big gala event and he wanted to bounce some jokes off
me.  Dripping sweat on the new carpet I had installed in my home office, Rick
flopped down on the guest chair after his afternoon jog.  Why he insisted
jogging with all of his gadgets always puzzled me -- he looked like a secret
service agent after a quick sprint around the Rose Garden with Bill Clinton.

      Rick's a gadget freak, even if he doesn't know the business end of a
computer; he gravitates towards telecommunications/paging gizmos.  Two
pagers (one for digital messages, the other to display telephone numbers), a
cellular phone (usually kept in a briefcase), a flip phone, two microcassette
recorders (one for joke ideas, the other one to record everything else), an
electronic rolodex, an electronic dictionary, and an electronic translator (he
just likes the sound of English translated to Latin and back . . . don't ask
me).  The translator hits the upper limit of his gizmatic abilities, though . . .
most everything with more than ten keys confuses him.

      I just nodded, staring at the "Wrong fax modem type" error message on
my screen.  Wrong type?  The manual indicated all I had to do was install the
word processing program and boom, I'd be junk-faxing thirty companies in
Walla Walla the details of my new fake insect in the ice cube products, "the
perfect ice-breaker at parties."

      Rick droned on about the national convention of computer nerds where
he'd be performing.  I shot him my best "I can kill you with a pocket
protector" glare, but he ignored it, as usual.  The word processor/fax
software manual was more interesting, anyway.

      "I figured," he went on, "that since you're the only computer ner . . .
er, I mean expert . . . that I know, maybe you could give me some feedback
on these techy jokes I'm gonna wow 'em with."

      Murmuring a vague assent, I realized I hadn't loaded the fax utilities
that came with the word processor.  Writing jokes for Rick would take less
time than reinstalling the program, but it was my only option.  At least Rick
could help me kill some time.

      "Get this one, get this one."  Rick shuffled the index cards he pulled
out of his fanny pack.  "Hey, I hear Bill Gates once worked on an earlier
version of Windows called . . . No-Doze!  Geddit, geddit?"

      I snatched the card from him.  "It's spelled W-I-N-D-O-W-S, Rick.  And
the only people who complain about the speed are the prehistorics still
running 386-25 machines."

      Rick took the card back, giving me his "you're a walking encyclopedia,
and annoying on top of it" look.  I just smiled and turned back to the
computer.  The installation was finished, so I rebooted while Rick scribbled
some notes.  He grabbed another card from his stack. Torturing him was going
to be fun.

      "I suppose I can scrap this one, too.  'Programs don't run under
Windows . . . they crawl.'"  He lifted an eyebrow, daring me to disagree.

      I smiled.

      Rick tore the card in two.  And about ten others, muttering something
like "Fifty bucks, down the drain" under his breath.  He lifted another card.

      "WordImperfect?" he asked, querously.

      Shaking my head, I answered, "Been done."  While he tossed three other
cards, I tried faxing again.  Again the computer beeped and "Wrong fax modem
type" appeared on the screen.  Realizing my mistake, I rewrote the batch file
to load the driver before the word processor, and rebooted again.  Maybe
writing jokes for Rick would be easier than this.  The person who first
thought of integrated software should be subjected to Rick's routine.

      Where did he get this material?  Rick's no A-list comedian, but he isn't
bottom-of-the-barrel, either.  He's played Vegas, for goodness' sake.  Well,
okay, so it was a small club on the outskirts of town, but it was Vegas.  His
glitter-suits, specially tailored for him in Nevada, were the only proof he had
of the two-night gig, but I never doubted him.

      Triumphantly, Rick lifted another card from the stack.  "This one's
guaranteed, baby.  It'll kill, I know it will."  He cleared his throat and put on
his best stage voice.  Unfortunately, I can't repeat what he said here, this
being a family publication and all.  The joke went on for five minutes, filled
with "software" and "hardware" and "hard disk," all told in an adolescent-
male voice loaded with testosterone.  Is that a vivid enough picture for you?

      "Obviously, Rick, you've never played Leather Goddesses of Phobos or
Leisure Suit Larry.  This material won't kill . . . it's already dead."

      "Writing the Great American Novell?"  Nuh-uh.  "New Frito-Lay Computer
Chips, able to store three times the fat and salt than other chips?"  Nope. 
"IBM means Infernally Bad Machines?"  I showed him my IBM shirt with three
dozen variations on the theme.  "I hit a speed-bump on the Information
Superhighway?"  Oh, please.  You've hit a speed-bump in your brain.  "My
mouth runs at 14.4k baud but my brain runs at 300 baud?"  That's true, but
it won't get any laughs.  "I got a code in my node from a computer virus?" 
Highly unlikely.  "Nancy Sinatra's new hit song, 'These Reboots Are Made For
AWKing'?"  Too obscure, incorrect, and just plain unfunny.  "I know all about
multitasking -- I read in the bathroom, and eat while watching TV."  Yawn. 
"This LAN is your LAN, this LAN is my LAN . . ."  He still insists on singing
in his act despite his agent's advice, and despite my yowling-dog
impersonation when he does it.  Rick is completely tone-deaf.  "Byte me." 
Only works in print, bucko.  And even in print it's dull.

      Rick must have run through a hundred "jokes" on that lazy, hazy,
crazy afternoon, getting more discouraged with each passing hour.  When he
offered "just the fax, ma'am," that reminded me of my task at hand, and I
reloaded the word processor while he ran through his last half-dozen gags.  I
couldn't stand it any more . . . I just had to know.

      "Rick, where did you get this awful material?  Your usual stuff is
cleverer than this."

      Rick shook his head and sighed.  "I've gotta cousin, oh, about 15 years
old, who runs her own BBS, and thought I'd save a little money . . ."

      I ran a hand over my face.  "Don't tell me -- she grabbed a tagline file
for you, didn't she?"

      Nodding, Rick tore the last few cards in two.  My office looked like the
remains of a ticker tape parade, or an all-night crash programming session at
Microsoft.  "Look, Rick," I counseled, "you and I both know you get what you
pay for.  Gear up your regular writers and bite the bullet."

      "Yeah, yeah, I know you're right."  Rick thanked me for the input and
shuffled his way back to his apartment, gadgets clacking against each other
on his fanny pouch belt.  He looked as dejected as Lotus after Novell beat
them out to purchase WordPerfect.  Turning back to my screen, I entered
Rick's name and address on the fax cover letter as the contact person for the
fake ice cube novelties.

      Looked like he needed something to fall back on.  Those "nerds" were
going to eat him alive.

 There are several different ways to get STTS magazine.


 SysOps:

 Contact me via any of the addresses listed in CONTACT POINTS listed
 elsewhere in this issue. Just drop me a note telling me your name,
 city, state, your BBS's name, it's phone number and it's baud rate, and
 where you'll be getting STTS from each month. If your BBS carries RIME,
 Pen & Brush Network, or you have access to the InterNet, I can put you
 on the STTS mailing list to receive the magazine free of charge each
 month. If you have access to FIDO, you can file request the magazine.
 If you don't have access to any of these services - or do but don't
 wish to use this option - you can call any of the BBS's listed in
 DISTRIBUTION SITES and download the new issue each month. In either
 case contact me so that I can put your BBS in the dist.  site list for
 the next issue of the magazine.

 (Refer to DISTRIBUTION VIA NETWORKS for more detailed information about
  the nets)


 Users:

 You can download STTS each month from any of the BBS's mentioned in
 DISTRIBUTION SITES elsewhere in this issue. If your local BBS isn't
 listed, pester and cajole your SysOp to "subscribe" to STTS for you.
 (the subscription, of course, is free)



 If you haven't any other way of receiving the magazine each month, a
 monthly disk subscription (sent out via US Mail) is available for 
 $ 20.00 per year. Foreign subscriptions are $ 25.00 (american dollars).

 Subscriptions should be mailed to:

 Submission Information
 ----------------------


 We're looking for a few good writers.

 Actually, we're looking for as many good writers as we can find. We're
 interested in fiction, poetry, reviews, feature articles (about most
 anything, as long as it's well-written), humour, essays, ANSI art, 
 and RIP art.

 STTS is dedicated to showcasing as many talents as it can, in all forms
 and genres. We have no general "theme" aside from good writing,
 innovative concepts, and unique execution of those concepts.

 As of January 1st 1994, we've been PAYING for accepted submissions!  

 In a bold move, STTS has decided to offer an incentive for writers to
 submit their works. For each accepted submission, an honorarium fee
 will be paid upon publication. Premium access to STTS BBS is also
 given to staff and contributing writers.

 In addition to the monthly payments, STTS will hold a twice-yearly
 "best of" contest, where the best published stories and articles in
 three categories will receive substantial cash prizes. 

 These changes took effect in January of 1994, and the first
 twice-yearly awards will be presented in the July 1994 issue.

 Honorariums, twice-yearly cash awards, award winners selection
 processes, and Contributor BBS access is explained below:


HONORARIUM

 Each and every article and story accepted for publication in STTS will
 received a cash honorarium. The payment is small and is meant as more
 of a token than something to reflect the value of the submission. 

 As the magazine grows and brings in more money, the honorariums will
 increase, as will the twice-yearly award amounts.


   Fiction pieces pay an honorarium of $2.00 each.
   Poetry pieces pay an honorarium of $1.00 each
   Non-fiction* pieces pay an honorarium of $1.00 each


 You have the option of refusing your honorarium. Refused funds will be
 donated to the American Cancer Society.

 Staff members ARE eligible for honorariums.

 * Non-fiction includes any feature articles, humor, reviews, and
   anything else that doesn't fit into the fiction or poetry category.


TWICE-YEARLY CASH AWARD

 Twice a year (every six months) the staff of STTS magazine will meet
 and vote on the stories, poems, and articles that have appeared in the
 last six issues of the magazine. Each staff member (the publisher
 included) gets one vote, and can use that vote on only one entry in
 each category. 

 In the unlikely event of a tie, the winners will split the cash award.

 Winners will be announced in the July and January issues of the
 magazine.

 Anyone serving on the staff of STTS magazine is NOT eligible for the
 twice-yearly awards.

 Twice-Yearly prize amounts
 --------------------------

 Fiction         $50.00
 Non-fiction      25.00
 Poetry           25.00


 The winner in each category does have the option of refusing his cash
 award. In the event of such a refusal, the entire sum of the refused
 cash awards will be donated to the American Cancer Society.


STTS BBS

  Staff members and contributing writers will also receive level 40
  access on Sunlight Through The Shadows BBS. Such access consists of 2
  hrs. a day, unlimited download bytes per day, and no download/upload
  ratio. A regular user receives 1 hr. a day and has an download/upload
  ratio of 10:1.

  Staff and contributing writers also receive access to a special
  private STTS Staff conference on the BBS.


LIMITATIONS

  STTS will still accept previously published stories and articles for
  publication. However, previously published submissions do NOT qualify
  for contention in the twice-yearly awards.

  Furthermore, previously published stories and articles will be paid at
  a 50% honorarium of the normal honorarium fee.


RIGHTS

 The copyright of said material, of course, remains the sole property
 of the author. STTS has the right to present it once in a "showcase"
 format and in an annual "best of" issue. (a paper version as well
 as the elec. version)

 Acceptance of submitted material does NOT necessarily mean that it
 will appear in STTS.

 Submissions should be in 100% pure ASCII format, formatted for 80
 columns. There are no limitations in terms of lengths of articles, but
 keep in mind it's a magazine, not a novel. <Grin>

 Fiction and poetry will be handled on a pure submission basis, except
 in the case of any round-robin stories or continuing stories that might
 develop. 

 Reviews will also be handled on a submission basis. If you're
 interested in doing a particular review medium (ie: books) on a
 full-time basis, let me know and we'll talk.

 ANSI art should be under 10k and can be about any subject as long as
 it's not pornographic. We'll feature ANSI art from time to time,
 as well as featuring a different ANSI "cover" for our magazine each
 month.

 In terms of articles, we're looking for just about anything that's
 of fairly general interest to the BBSing world at large. An article
 comparing several new high-speed modems would be appropriate, for
 example, whereas an article describing in detail how to build your
 own such modem really wouldn't be.

 Articles needn't be contained to the world of computing, either.
 Movies, politics, ecology, literature, entertainment, fiction,
 non-fiction, reviews - it's all fair game for STTS.

 Articles, again, will be handled on a submission basis. If anyone has
 an idea or two for a regular column, let me know. If it works, we'll
 incorporate it into STTS.

    Advertising
    -----------

 Currently, STTS Mag is being "officially" carried by over 90 BBS's
 across the United States. It's also being carried by BBS's in the
 United Kingdom, Canada, Portugal, and Finland. 

 Unofficially (which means that the SysOps haven't yet notifed me that
 they carry it) it's popped up on literally hundreds of BBS's across the
 USA as well as in other countries including the UK, Canada, Portugal, 
 Ireland, Japan, The Netherlands, Scotland, and Saudi Arabia.

 It's also available via Internet, FIDO, RIME, and
 Pen & Brush Networks.

 Currently, STTS has about 10,000 readers worldwide and is available
 to literally millions of BBSers through the internet and other 
 networks and BBS's.

 If you or your company want to expose your product to a variety of
 people all across the world, this is your opportunity!

 Advertising in Sunlight Through The Shadows Magazine is available
 in four different formats:




 1) Personal Advertisements  (NON-Business)
    -----------------------

 Personal advertisements run $5.00 for 4 lines of advertising, with each
 additional line $1.00. Five lines is the minimum length. Your ad can be
 as little as one line, but the cost is still $5.00. 

 Advertisements should be in ASCII and formatted for 80 columns. They
 should include whatever you're trying to sell (or buy) as well as a
 price and a method of contacting you. 

 ANSI or RIP ads at this level will NOT be accepted.

 Business ads will NOT be accepted here. These ads are for non-business
 readers to advertise something they wish to sell or buy, or to
 advertise a non-profit event. 

 BBS ads are considered business ads.


 2) Regular Advertisement (Business or Personal)
    ---------------------

 We're accepting business advertisements in STTS.  If you're interested
 in advertising in STTS, a full-page (ASCII or ASCII and ANSI) is
 $25.00/issue. Those interested can contact me by any of the means
 listed under Contact Points.

 If you purchase 5 months of advertising ($125.00) the sixth month is
 free.


 3) Feature Advertisement (Business or Personal)
    ---------------------

 We'll include one feature ad per issue. The feature ad will pop up
 right after the magazine's ANSI cover, when the user first begins to
 read the magazine. This ad will also appear within the body of the
 magazine, for further perusement by the reader.

 A feature ad will run $50.00 per issue, and should be created in
 both ANSI and ASCII formats.

 If you purchase 5 months of advertising ($250.00) the sixth month is
 free. 


 4) BBS Advertisement (Business or Personal)
    -----------------

 Many BBS SysOps and users call STTS BBS each month to get the current
 issue of STTS Magazine. These callers are from all over the USA as well
 as Canada, Portugal, the UK, and various other countries.

 Advertising is now available for the logoff screen of the BBS. The
 rates are $100.00 per month. Ads should be in both ASCII and ANSI
 format. We're accepting RIP ads as well, but only for the this
 advertising option.

 If you purchase 5 months of advertising ($500.00) the sixth month is
 free.



    Advertisement Specifications
    ----------------------------

 Ads may be in as many as three formats. They MUST be in ascii text and
 may also be in ANSI and/or RIP Graphics formats. 

 Ads should be no larger than 24 lines (ie: one screen/page) and ANSI
 ads should not use extensive animation. 

 If you cannot make your own ad or do not have the time to make your
 own ad, we can make it for you. However, there is a one-time charge of
 $10.00 for this service. We will create ads in ASCII and ANSI only. If
 you absolutely need RIP ads and cannot create your own, we'll attempt
 to put you into contact with someone who can.

Sunlight Through The Shadows Magazine is available through FIDO,
INTERNET, RIME, and PEN & BRUSH NET. Check below for information on how
to request the current issue of the magazine or be put on the monthly
mailing list.


                         FIDO

To get the newest issue of the magazine via FIDO, you'll need to
do a file request from Fido Node 1:124/8010 using the "magic" name
of SUNLIGHT.


                       INTERNET

To get on the STTS mailing list, do the following:


  Send internet mail message to:


        STTS-REQUEST%textalk@egsner.cirr.com
 
  With either the following in the body:
 
        ADD SUBSCRIBE JOIN
 
  To be added to the list or:

        UNSUBSCRIBE DELETE REMOVE

  To be removed from the list.


If you're a SysOp *Please* be sure to send me a note telling me your
BBS's name, your name, your state and city, the BBS's phone number(s)
and it's baud rate(s) so I can include you in the list issue's
distribution list. 

Send the note to:  Joe.DeRouen@Chryalis.ORG



If you wish to FTPMAIL request the magazine, please send mail to:
 
        FTPMAIL%textalk@egsner.cirr.com
 
With the following in the body:
 
        GET <filename.ext>
 
Where <filename.ext> would be SUN9408.ZIP or whatever issue you're
wanting to retrieve.  The current issue available will correspond to
whatever month you're in.  Septemeber 1994 would be SUN9409.ZIP, etc.


                         RIME

To request the magazine via RIME, ask your RIME SysOp to do a file
request from node # 5320 for the current issue (eg: sun9408.ZIP, or
whatever month you happen to be in) Better yet, ask your SysOp to
request to be put on the monthly mailing list and receive STTS
automatically.

                    PEN & BRUSH NET

To request via P&BNet, follow the instructions for RIME above. They're
both ran on Postlink and operate exactly the same way in terms of file
requests and transfers.


I'd like to thank Texas Talk BBS and Archives On-Line BBS for allowing
me to access the Internet and Fido (respectively) from their systems. 

 
 
End Notes
Copyright (c) 1994, Joe DeRouen     
All rights reserved


Lately, I've been playing in MUDs (Multi-User Dungeons) on the internet.
Couple that with the fact that I'm not writing for Computer Currents
magazine and have been extremely busy with some non-computer related
stuff as well and you have the reason why the magazine is late.

It's also a decent reason as to why the endnotes doesn't say much.
<Grin>  Ah well.  There's always next month!
