Welcome

Welcome to the first issue of Sunlight Through The Shadows magazine! In
this issue, as well as in the future, STTS will strive to bring you the
best in fiction, poetry, reviews, article, and other assorted reading
material.

This issue wouldn't have been possible without the aid, support, and
guidance of three women:

Inez Harrison, publisher of Poetry In Motion newsletter. Her's was the
first electronic magazine I ever laid eyes upon, and also the first such
magazine to publish my work. She's given me advice, and, more
importantly, inspiration.

Lucia Chambers, publisher of Smoke & Mirrors Elec. Magazine and head of
Pen & Brush Network. She gave me advice on running a magazine,
encouragement, and hints as to the kind of people to look for in
writers.

Heather DeRouen, my wife. Listed last here, but always first in my
heart. She's proofread manuscripts, inspired me, listened to me, and,
most importantly, loved me. Never could I find a better woman to live
life by my side, nor a better friend.


Now that that's said and done... Again, welcome to Sunlight Through The
Shadows Magazine! I hope you enjoy it.

As I write this, I'm only about 3/4th's of the way finished with the
first issue of Sunlight Through The Shadows. It's 12:30am June the 14th,
exactly 24 hours before my self-imposed deadline for the release of the
first issue.

If this editorial sees the light of day (or should I saw the glow of
your monitor?) then you'll know that I made it.

There's several other electronic/on-line magazines out there. Poetry In
Motion, Smoke & Mirrors, Ruby's Pearls, ModemNews, On-Line News and
Review, Dallas/Ft. Worth On-Line, Eeek! Bits... and several others that
I can't recall at the moment but I'm sure are good magazines all the
same.

So why bring STTS Magazine into existence, with all these other's out
there?

The world of electronic publishing is just now opening up, and I'm
sure that my magazine won't be the last to debut. There's plenty of
room out there in the electronic world for magazines, as there's
virtually no overhead involved in producing one. What IS involved,
though, is time. Lot's of it, too. When I first started this, I really
didn't know what I was getting myself into. Now, I think I'm finally
beginning to realize.

And you know what? I'm not going to give up. Producing this first issue
has been a real challenge, and I don't foresee things getting any easier
in the near future. My goal is to bring to you, the reader, some of the
best writing available. A lot of it will be mine at first. This isn't
because I'm over egocentric (well, maybe a little) but because the BBS
world at large seems hesitant to submit stories or articles to the
various magazines out there. I'm not exactly sure why, but I'm hoping
that as this medium grows and matures that that'll change. I'll do my
best to help bring about the change.

Which brings us to my original rhetorical question: Why bring out such a
magazine, with all the others already out there? STTS isn't going to try
to compete with any of the others. There's no need for that. We'll try
and find a loyal readership and give them a reason to stay loyal. We'll
try to bring innovative ideas and concepts to the world of electronic
publishing. More than anything else, though, we'll try to have FUN and
to help YOU have fun. If you don't have that, there's really no point to
any of it.

If you have any comments, compliments, or criticisms, direct them to
myself, Joe DeRouen, through any of the addresses listed in CONTACT
POINTS elsewhere in this magazine.

Thank you, and happy reading!

Joe DeRouen

  Joe DeRouen publishes, edits, and writes for STTS magazine. He's had
  poetry and fiction published in several on-line magazines and a few
  paper publications as well. He's written exactly 1.5 novels, none of
  which, alas, have seen the light of publication. He attends college
  part-time in search of that always-elusive english degree. In his spare
  time, he enjoys reading, running his BBS, collecting music, playing
  with his five cats, singing opera, hunting pseudopods, and most
  importantly spending time with his beautiful wife Heather.

  Heather DeRouen writes software for the healthcare industry, CoSysOps
  Sunlight Through The Shadows BBS, enjoys playing with her five cats,
  cross-stitching, and reading. Most of all, she enjoys spending time
  with her dapper, charming, witty, and handsome (not to mention modest)
  husband Joe. Heather's help towards editing and proofreading this
  magazine has been immeasurable.

  Bruce Diamond, part-time pseudopod and ruler of a small island
  chain off the coast of Chil‚, spends his time imitating desk
  lamps when he isn't watching and critiquing movies for LIGHTS
  OUT, his BBS movie review publication (now syndicated to over 15
  boards).  Bruce started reviewing movies for profit in 1978, as
  part of a science fiction opinion column he authored for THE
  BUYER'S GUIDE FOR COMICS FANDOM (now called THE COMICS BUYER'S
  GUIDE).  LIGHTS OUT, now a year old, is available through Bruce's
  distributor, Jay Gaines' BBS AMERICA (214-994-0093).  Bruce is a
  freelance writer and video producer in the Dallas/Fort Worth
  area.

  Russell Mirabelli is currently pursuing his Master of Science
  degree in Information Systems at the University of Texas at Arlington.
  He works for an educational software company as a multimedia programmer.
  He enjoys playing bass, cycling and rollerblading. He lives in Arlington,
  Texas, with his wife and two cats.

  Jason Malandro resides in Dallas, Texas, and has for most of his 24
  years on Earth. He enjoys reading, writing, bowling, fencing, and
  several other unrelated activities. Jason works in the publishing
  industry and runs a successful florist business part-time. Single, he
  shares his apartment with Ralphie, his pet iguana.

  Randy Shipp is a sometimes-writer who specializes in half-finished works,
  an idea he decided was chic and the sign of genius after hearing about
  some unfinished symphony. The generous offer from Bruce Diamond to join him
  in publishing (plus free movie passes!) led Randy to take up movie
  criticism. When he's not picking movies apart, he's showing conservative
  political thinkers the error of their ways, reading, or playing bass or the
  guitar (depending on the day of the week) He occasionally works selling
  computers, too. When he grows up, he expects to teach high school history.

  There is very little known about Tamara, and she prefers to let it
  remain that way. She's a woman of mystery and prefers to remain hidden
  in the shadows of the BBS world. (Actually, I didn't get her profile in
  time for the first issue, but it sounds much more enigmatic this way,
  don't you think?)

Cancer: Surviving The Fear
Copyright (c) 1993, Joe DeRouen
All rights reserved


Nearly one year ago today, my wife was diagnosed as having terminal
cancer. She has atypical Mycosis Fungoites, which is a rare form of
lymphoma. Atypical means it isn't typical, so what it boils down to is
that she had a rare form of a rare form of cancer.

In other words, almost no one else in the world has exactly what she has.
This has been maddening but has also given us hope. The doctors refuse
to give us a life prognosis, saying that she could live as little as
three years or as long as thirty. They just don't KNOW. She's skipped
certain stages in the "normal" progression of the disease, and gotten to
other levels before she should have. In every sense of the world, her
case is abnormal.

Heather's engaged in topical radiation therapy, PUVA light therapy,
Interferon injections, steroids, and several other drugs and treatments.
Sometime in the next two years, her doctors should know whether or not
her disease will go into remission.

The point of this article isn't to educate the readers of STTS on
cancer, nor is it to bring "get-well" mail to my wife.

When we discovered that she had cancer and had possibly lost years to
her life, we also discovered that we had lost something almost as
precious: friends. Before she was diagnosed we had several friends, all
open, intelligent, and generally good people. We now have very few, and
of those we DO have, fewer still feel comfortable talking about her
disease. Of her family, only Heather's mother will openly talk about it,
and even then you can tell she's uncomfortable.

"How're you doing?" They'll ask, not really wanting to know. Anything
more than a "Fine, thanks." and they close themselves off, and
physically leave the room if possible.

We're all afraid of death, and anything that reminds us of our own
mortality brings us a step closer to that Ultimate End. It's human
nature to hide from what we fear or don't understand, to bury our heads
deep beneath the covers of our life.

It doesn't have to be this way. Heather's still the same bright, warm,
funny woman that she was before she got sick. She still has the same
dreams, hopes, wishes, and ambitions. She's still the kindest women I've
ever had the pleasure to know. She doesn't deserve to be shunned from
those who once claimed her friendship, nor to be forced to pretend that
there's nothing wrong when there most definitely is.

I, too, have fallen prey to this most human failing. In the beginning, I
was strong and tried my best to be There For Her. As time went by, I
became frightened. What if her life span was to be closer to the three
years than the thirty? I'm 24. I didn't want to be left alone in the
prime of my life. For a while, I ran as far away mentally as I possibly
could.

I consider myself to be of above-average intelligence, open, honest, and
accepting of those different than me. One of the "enlightened crowd", if
you will. Yet here I was, running away from the woman who loved me more
than anyone else ever had, and who I, in turn, love with all of my
heart. It had to stop somewhere. And it did.

If you have a friend of relative who suffers from a handicap, who has
cancer or AIDS, who needs your support.. Go to them. Be their friend,
love them. Remember that, deep down, where it really counts, they're the
person that you know and love. Time is precious and the time we're given
to share the love within us all is far too often brief. Take advantage of
it. Listen to them, and, whatever you do, don't run away. If you do,
come back.

There are a multitude of support groups and counseling services out there
that will help you come to terms with your loved one's situation. If you
find you're having problems dealing with it on your own, seek one of
these out. Don't feel silly or bad for doing so. Believe me, you're not
alone. Look through the yellow pages under "counseling" or "support
groups" and look for a group or orginization that specializes in the
disease or handicap that you need help in coping with.

Sooner or later, we all die. Accept that, and you can get on with what's
important in life: living.

     BRUCE DIAMOND:  Welcome to the first installment of THROUGH THE
                     MAGIC LANTERN, with Diamond and Shipp.
                     I'm Diamond.


     RANDY SHIPP:  And I'm Shipp.


     DIAMOND:  For this first installment, we'll be discussing Steven
               Spielberg's new epic, JURASSIC PARK, taken from Michael
               Crichton's best-selling novel.  Billionaire John
               Hammond (Richard Attenborough) creates a theme park on
               an island off the coast of Costa Rica.  His investors
               are nervous about the park, so he invites two
               scientists, paleontologist Allan Grant (Sam Neill) and
               paleobotanist Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) to give the
               park their "stamp of approval."  As added insurance,
               the investors' lawyer, Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero)
               brings along a brilliant mathematician, Dr. Ian Malcolm
               (Jeff Goldblum), whose Choas-based theories foretell
               the inevitable collapse of the park.


     SHIPP:  The visitors are astounded when they reach the park to
             find that Hammond's team of geneticists have cloned
             dinosaurs from DNA millions of years old.  The group
             quickly decides that perhaps Hammond's scientists have
             acted too quickly, but are convinced by the jubilant
             Hammond to withhold final judgement until after they have
             had the grand tour of the park.  But a tropical storm,
             and the actions of a spy on Hammond's staff combine to
             make for a less-than-pleasant tour.  When Hammond's
             dinosaurs are set free to roam the island, the visitors
             are forced to survive against long-extinct predators.


     DIAMOND:  Well, Randy, I think you may have understated the case
               when you say "less-than-pleasant tour."


     SHIPP:  You're right.  I think that's one of the things that most
             people, especially parents, may be interested in hearing.
             JURASSIC PARK isn't exactly a kiddie movie.  Steven
             Spielberg's movie isn't gory, but it is suspenseful,
             maybe too much for some younger kids.


     DIAMOND:  Suspenseful is, again, an understatement.  JURASSIC is a
               tense, scary movie, perhaps the best-made monster movie
               ever.  It will scare you.  Bar none.


     SHIPP:  Maybe the fact that these monsters were once real makes
             it even more scary.


     DIAMOND:  That's a good point.  There's something primal about
               dinosaurs -- practically every kid feels it at one
               point or another.  Maybe it's a racial memory that
               keeps bringing us back to dinosaurs, even though
               science tells us that humans and dinosaurs never
               co-existed.  Look at the popularity of Godzilla, for
               example.


     SHIPP:  Right.  There's been a real rush on dinosaur things
             lately, and I think it's because they're the only
             monsters we're allowed to believe in.  Spielberg has
             taken what may have been fascinating creatures for kids
             and made them very believable and very scary.  Of course,
             it's worth noting that not all the dinos in JURASSIC are
             killers.


     DIAMOND:  Too true.  The brachiosaurs are one example of the
               peaceful dinos in this film.  The scene where Neill and
               Dern first see a live brachiosaur is incredible.  I
               *felt* the awe they were feeling, and the computer
               graphics are impeccable.


     SHIPP:  Yeah, in my opinion, I think the shots of peaceful animals
             were more awesome than the dark, violent shots of T. Rex.


     DIAMOND:  A friend who accompanied me to the preview said he was
               pulled in by the shot of the brachiosaurs in the lake,
               mixed with smaller dinosaurs and birds.  It was so
               REAL.


     SHIPP:  Or the scene where the herd of small dinos flocked like
             birds across a field.  That's where JURASSIC PARK's
             special effects people really succeeded:  they managed to
             really let you forget you weren't looking at models or
             computer graphics.  The effects, including the incredible
             sound, convinced you for a while that all that was
             possible.


     DIAMOND:  You know, I've already heard one critic complain that
               the full-size animatronic puppets and the computer
               graphics didn't blend together at all for him.  He even
               mentioned stop-motion animation, but the fact is that
               while Industrial Light and Magic's "Go-Motion" team
               (the same team responsible for the Landwalkers in THE
               EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and other such movies) worked on
               the dinosaur's movements, absolutely NO stop-motion
               animation was used in the movie.


     SHIPP:  I think it's a tribute to ILM that I couldn't tell how the
             effects were done.  And I'm a person who usually pays
             close attention to special effects.  I think it's great
             that the effects in this movie didn't vie for your
             attention quite like TERMINATOR 2.


     DIAMOND:  T2 seemed more of an effects-for-effects'-sake movie,
               whereas in JURASSIC PARK, the thrill-ride terror is
               more of the focus.  That may be the major distinction
               between James Cameron and Steven Spielberg as
               directors.  Cameron's great with action flicks, but
               NOBODY can do atmosphere and white-knuckle scenes like
               Spielberg.


     SHIPP:  And they abound in JURASSIC PARK.  I'll tell you, I'm
             tempted to declare this movie Spielberg's best for that
             very reason.  At no point did the tension stop building
             in this movie until the very end, when it climaxed and
             then dropped off very suddenly.  I thought that perhaps
             there might have been a bit more denouement or epilogue
             to the story, but then the ending was a weakness in
             Crichton's book, which may have been difficult to remedy
             in the screen adaptation.


     DIAMOND:  Yes, but there was more of a sense of closure to the
               novel.  The film, unfortunately, just leaves you
               hanging.  Perhaps deliberately for a sequel, which
               Spielberg has dropped hints about lately.  Spielberg
               changed several things from the book, some for the
               better, some for the worse.  I'm not sure I agree with
               his softening of EVERY character.  Hammond, for
               example, is not nearly as obsessed as he is in the
               book.  Crichton's Ian Malcolm was much more acerbic,
               and his kids were quite annoying.


     SHIPP:  You're right.  I worried that the kids would come out
             badly in the film, and in fact they did quite well.


     DIAMOND:  I agree.  The girl (Ariana Richards) plays absolute
               terror so *well* that I was afraid for her!


     SHIPP:  As for a sequel, I think they might have used the
             minimal epilogue of the novel to set us up for a
             JURASSIC PARK 2, but instead, Spielberg chose not even to
             give us a hint that there could be more action.  I think
             part of that comes from the fact that he was forced to
             edit the story heavily.  A time and money constraint
             certainly must have led him to cut back some scenes in
             the book, some of which suggested in no uncertain terms
             the possibility of a sequel.  But I think that with the
             incredible box office success this movie is likely to
             see, a sequel may be so financially sound an investment
             as to be inevitable.


     DIAMOND:  A time and money constraint?  I don't know.  Considering
               Spielberg spent somewhere between 50 and 70 million
               dollars and spent two months filming in Hawaii, it may
               have been more of a *dramatic* purpose to cut back some
               scenes from the book.  The whole business of dinosaurs
               (velociraptors, actually) escaping to the mainland was
               dropped entirely, and I think it makes for a stronger
               film.


     SHIPP:  A little more focused, maybe.


     DIAMOND:  Which, frankly, film needs to be.  The medium dictates
               it.


     SHIPP:  It's hard to fault Spielberg for not making a four hour
             movie, which JURASSIC PARK surely would've been had every
             scene been recreated...but it would've been fun to see
             two more hours of incredible dinosaur effects and to hear
             more of John Williams' outstanding score.


     DIAMOND:  Williams has outdone himself here.  It's not often I can
               still hear the score in my head after I leave a movie.
               Right now, the theme from JURASSIC PARK is playing over
               and over in my mind.  While it may not be his absolute
               best work (and I might have to say that for Spielberg,
               as well), it's certainly better than some of his more
               recent efforts.


     SHIPP:  Yep.  This soundtrack will join STAR WARS in my CD
             collection.  I found myself several times thinking, "This
             is just like STAR WARS.  Williams has actually WATCHED
             this movie."  His music will bring back the story when
             you listen to it later.


     DIAMOND:  Do you maintain that this is Spielberg's best movie,
               even in the light of JAWS, E.T., and THE COLOR PURPLE?
               While it's an excellent job, and easily the most
               exciting movie so far this year, I'm a little hesitant
               to call it his best.


     SHIPP:  It's tough to decide which of those medalists should get
             the gold, isn't it?  I just feel that maybe Spielberg has
             found a style which he might even refine more.  The
             suspense was so taut in JURASSIC, you'd think it was the
             only style Spielberg had ever worked in.  Perhaps I was
             hasty to suggest it was his best, but then I hope that we
             haven't seen Steven Spielberg's best movie.


     DIAMOND:  I hope we haven't, either.  God knows, it'll take a lot
               to surpass JURASSIC PARK.  I've been maintaining for
               the last two weeks that this is Spielberg's medium.  He
               works best with topics that at least have some
               grounding in reality.  When he takes off on a flight of
               fantasy (viz. HOOK), he loses his footing, despite the
               youth-based themes that he resonates so well with.



     SHIPP:  I think that may be why, surprisingly to some people,
             JAWS sticks out among the list of movies you mentioned
             earlier.  It had the same sort of building fear that
             JURASSIC PARK has, and it also deals with real-life
             monsters.  In JAWS, though, he had a much easier time
             building suspense, since the menace was hidden and struck
             without warning.  In JURASSIC, I think Spielberg had to
             work harder to be scary, so maybe I'm a little more
             impressed.


     DIAMOND:  Well, in the end, all the arguments and little flaws in
               the movie can be swept away by just two words:  "WHO
               CARES?"  JURASSIC PARK is one mother of an amusement
               ride, and everything else can just fall by the wayside.
               On a scale of 1-10, I'd have to give JURASSIC PARK a
               10!


     SHIPP:  I'm with you, Bruce.  This movie sparkled the way only a
             high-budget, high-quality film can, and is the first
             movie in a while which left me breathless even during the
             ride home.  JURASSIC PARK was a perfect 10!


     DIAMOND:  That's it for this month's installment of THROUGH THE
               MAGIC LANTERN, with Diamond and Shipp.  Be with us next
               month when we discuss another summer blockbuster.


     SHIPP:  I'm Diamond and he's Shipp...nononono...He's Diamond and
             I'm Shipp...and we'll meet YOU at the matinee.  See you
             next time.

                        ** Reviewed by Bruce Diamond **
                      (from the June issue of LIGHTS OUT)


          Go for popcorn or whatever after the first ten minutes,
     because by then you've already seen the most exciting moments of
     CLIFFHANGER, the Sly Stallone starrer that's supposed to be his
     mega-hit this summer.  Here's a hint -- it ain't gonna happen,
     despite a strong opening weekend.  Some wags have already tagged
     this movie as "DIE HARD on a mountain," and while there's some
     truth to that description, you'll find that it doesn't hold true
     for the length of the film.

          Director Renny Harlin also directed DIE HARD 2, which is
     where the comparison is coming from.  Unfortunately, the same
     weaknesses he exhibited in DIE HARD 2 (when compared with John
     McTiernan's DIE HARD, the first film) are on display here.  At
     least with DIE HARD 2, he had a halfway-clever script and a
     compelling villain to work with.  There's no humor in CLIFF-
     HANGER, at least not that I could find, and John Lithgow's
     villain is scenery-chewing at its worst.  He's almost as bad here
     as he was in last summer's Hitchcockian stinker, RAISING CAIN.
     Sporting what seems to be a South African accent, Lithgow's
     dialogue, after the first half hour of exposition, is reduced to
     endless variations on, "You bahstid."  At one point, after dis-
     covering that Stallone (playing rescue ranger Gabe Walker) has
     survived yet another attempt on his life, he says into a walkie
     talkie, "Walker, you're a bahstid, but you're a resourceful
     bahstid."  I can only assume that these lines are the result of
     Stallone's wholesale rewriting of the script.  They're definitely
     on a par with, "Yo, Adrienne!"

          I pray we eventually see the end of the Hollywood blockbus-
     ter, the "high concept" film, soon.  If you checked the credits
     in the box before this review began, you'll have noticed that
     CLIFFHANGER is "based on a premise by John Long."  Based on a
     premise?  This has all the smell of a "high concept" thrown out
     during a power lunch with studio executives.  "How's this?
     Stallone on a mountain!  What do you think?  Can't miss, eh?"
     And whoever this John Long is (sounds like a pseudonym, doesn't
     it?), he gets paid his "premise" money, the star and director are
     signed, and THEN the script gets written.  I'm willing to bet
     that's exactly how the deal went down.

          Gabe quits the Rocky Mountain Rescue Team when something
     goes wrong during a rescue.  His lover, Jessie Deighan (Janine
     Turner), convinces him to get back on the mountain to rescue some
     hikers who have lost their way.  Hal Tucker (Micheal Rooker),
     Walker's former partner, joins him in the rescue, even though he
     still blames Gabe for what happened.  What neither rescuer knows,
     though, is that the hikers are actually criminals looking for
     some lost U.S. Treasury money, led by Eric Qualen (Lithgow).
     The band of criminals is pretty run-of-the-mill, although they
     all seem to have ODed on testosterone before making the drop.
     They are all, to the person, rude, egotistical, and basically
     playing the same character.

          The scenery and the aerial photography are tops, and the
     only reason to see CLIFFHANGER.  If you want really exciting
     mountain climbing scenes, stay home and rent K2 from last year.

     RATING:   3 out of 10

Many bulletin boards across the nation have a huge amount of
software to choose from for download. Most have so many titles
that determining which ones might be worth the download time is
difficult. In this column, I will attempt to help you sort through
the huge morass of shareware available and let you know which
titles I feel are worth your evaluation. All the software reviewed

One of the recent trends in the commercial game market is
the horror genre, and Apogee software is joining in the fray
with their release MONSTER BASH. Weighing in at over 900k of
download time and well over 1MB of disk space (more for the release
version), monster bash is a great run-and-shoot style adventure
game. Its graphics are just a little bit on the horrific side,
but not so much as to cause any real concern.

Monster Bash supports joystick as well as keyboard controls, and
soundblaster/adlib cards are supported. This recent trend by the
major shareware game manufacturers to support these cards is
quite appreciated.

Monster Bash does require quite a bit of free memory to run, so
this can be a problem if you keep a lot of drivers loaded. Most
games have this problem these days, so you should be prepared
for this problem.

In Monster bash, Johnny Dash's dalmation, Tex, has been
kidnapped. As is usual, it is your job as JD to free all the
pets kidnapped and save the world from the scourge of all
humanity (of course, just as in every other game). You
are equipped with a magical slingshot that never runs out of
stones and can mutate if you jump and grab certain icons.

Although it is a quite large download, I feel that Monster Bash
is a really interesting and fun game, at least for a little
while. This reviewer has no fondness for PC arcade games (that's
why I got a SEGA), but Monster Bash may very well be just the
thing that some other gamers are looking for.

For your $39.00 registration fee, you receive hint/cheat sheets
and two more sets of levels (and even better graphics!). Apogee
is also one of the largest game companies in existence (even
though it is a shareware company) and boasts great service.

My rating for MONSTER BASH: (1-10)

Value        7
Graphics     8
Action       7

Monster Bash is a well-executed arcade game for the PC with

THELMA THISTLEBLOSSOM, by Timp Software, is a comprehensive
stand-alone spelling and grammar checker. This package allows a
user to review his or her documents for spelling and basic
grammatical errors. Although it has its weaknesses, Thelma is a
sound product.

The first thing that you encounter when you start this program is
a "beg screen" accompanied by the theme from Beethoven's Ninth
Symphony. This is a welcome item in the eyes of this reviewer, as
sometimes when these opening screens stay up too long, I will
reboot my system, suspecting a crash. The tune lets me know that
I'm intentionally being held at this point.

Once the intro screen goes away, Thelma asks for the file you wish
to check. It accepts documents in two formats: ASCII text and
WordPerfect. The WP format is nice for those users who don't wish
to export from their word processor. It also is not a surprise, as
Timp software comes from Orem, Utah (the city where WP
headquarters is located). It uses a relatively strong file-opening
dialog sequence, though the user does need to understand the use
of DOS wildcards to get full use.

The first of Thelma's two functions is that of a spell checker.
Although people who use a full-featured word processor might not
need this, those (like myself) who prefer small text editors will
find this useful. Thelma's dictionary size of 89,000 words is
actually a bit small compared to other shareware spell checkers,
but it certainly is adequate. Upon finding a misspelled word, it
will offer selections for replacement (using letter keys), or allow
the user to edit the word manually (if the word is not found).

The spell checker falls down in one major respect: the dictionary is
fixed. I personally dislike the fact that my name is considered
misspelled every time it comes up, or that major computer terms
are not in the dictionary. A user-extensible spell checker would
take care of this problem.

The second and more unique of Thelma's functions is that of a
grammar checker. It checks for technical errors, such as doubled
words, overuse of technical words, and long sentences. Its
function in that regard is adequate: it does help pick up on things
that I might have missed otherwise. I personally have the problem
of overuse of the passive voice, and Thelma reminds me to not
overuse it.

The grammar functions are not entirely perfect, either. For
example, the proper way to use a period on a typewriter is to
follow it with two spaces, but on a laser printer (especially with
good fonts) it is proper to use a single space. Also, the advice
given is a bit stoic: it offers no real solutions to your problem,
it merely points out the problem.

Thelma's registration fee is $29.00, and for this you get quite a
bundle of goods: a grammar reference and tutorial, a printed
manual and quick reference, and one shareware update. The intro
screens also go away. Comparatively, this is a quite good value,
and extremely competitively priced in comparison to commercial
products (Grammatik, Correct Grammar, etc.).

My rating for THELMA THISTLEBLOSSOM: (1-10)

Value        8
Usability    5
Performance  6
--------------
Overall      6

Thelma Thistleblossom performs as well as one would expect, and it
compares favorably to commercial software. However, grammar is not
a set of cut-and-dry rules, and this makes it a difficult task for
any computer program. If your writing could use a little touch-up,
I wouldn't hesitate to recommend that you give Thelma
Thistleblossom a try!

POWER OF TEN
Chris deBurgh
A&M Records

POWER OF TEN, Chris deBurgh's first release of new material since
1988's disappointing FLYING COLOURS (he released a "best of" collection,
SPARK TO A FLAME, and the live album HIGH ON EMOTION - LIVE IN DUBLIN in
1989 and 1990, respectively) marks a return to the styles and passions
embodied in earlier works such as THE CRUSADER and AT THE END OF A
PERFECT DAY. Filled with grace, style, and most importantly powerful
lyrics and music, POWER OF TEN is a definite winner.

Opening with Where We Will Be Going, a beautiful song that takes us
through a bit of history and beyond, the album gets better and better.
Each song flows into the next, and it's smooth without being slick.

The album's first single release, Separate Tables, tells the tale of
a broken love affair with the hint of hope and gentle wit. (At separate
tables we sit down to write/The separate letters that never see the
light/If only we could just agree/To read between the lines) It's a
wistful, heartbreaking tale of love gone awry and lost chances.

Talk To Me, the album's 6th track, is an emotional, energetic foray into
obsession and desperation. (I am the one, yes I know I am the one/I am
the one for you now/I want you beside me/I dream of your body/I see you
and me there forever) It's one that leaves you breathless and wanting
for more.

The Connemara Coast, the 7th track, features a guest appearance by
irish/celtic folk band The Chieftains. The Chieftains' Paddy Moloney
arranged the piece, and deBurgh plays a beautiful acoustic guitar in this
haunting love song.

Brother John, the CD's 8th track, returns to the world of religion
with a twist recounted in Spanish Train (SPANISH TRAINS & OTHER
STORIES) and The Devil's Eye (THE CRUSADER). Brother John tells the
story of a priest that eventually gives in to temptation, and shows off
deBurgh's strong sense of the ballad as well as his sense of humor.

The CD's last track, Making The Perfect Man, is the weakest of the set
but also the most innovative. An energetic, modern version of
Frankenstein's Monster, (So they called the doctor, the doctor said
'it's strange/He's got pistols on his fingers, he's got love on the
brain/He's got a tongue good for lying and the legs to run away/He will
fool all the people all the time some day!') it's certainly a break from
his usual style of ballads and wistful love songs. It doesn't work on
all levels, but it doesn't really have to.

About the only negative thing I can really say about POWER OF TEN is the
fact that it was released in 1992 and STILL isn't available in the USA.
Alas, deBurgh's music seem to be destined to remain strictly a European
delicacy. Except for Lady In Red (INTO THE LIGHT), a 1986 mega-hit, and
1982's Don't Pay The Ferryman (THE GETAWAY), deBurgh's music has managed
to elude the vast collective consciousness of most Americans. Perhaps that's
part of what keeps it fresh and alive despite well over 10 albums. If you're
a fan of deBurgh's (or think that you might like to give his music a listen)
I'll urge you to pick up this CD. If you're American, that'll mean having to
go to a bit of trouble, but it's definitely worth it.

ZEUS AND CO.
David Lee Jones
AvoNova Fantasy
$4.99 US, $5.99 Canada


Cyrus Major, Computer programmer, night shift computer security officer,
and California surfer, was readying to shut down the Sigma Systems
computer for the night when something strange happened. His monitor began
to glow a phosphorescent green, fading only moments after it appeared.
In it's wake were a few lines of an unknown poem, words that would draw
Cyrus deep into the heart of the biggest, funniest mystery that he'd
ever known.

Thus starts ZEUS AND CO., David Lee Jones' second novel (he also authored
UNICORN HIGHWAY). Cryus is drawn deeper and deeper into the plot, as he
discovers that an unauthorized user using the codename Iberlin has
created a 100 Meg file on the mainframe's Top Secret hard drive. Soon
after his discovery, he meet a beautiful blonde who claims to be the
Greek Muse of love poetry Erato. It seems as though, through accident or
scheme, her sister Euterpe (the Greek Muse of lyric poetry) has managed
to get herself trapped on the very hard drive that Cyrus discovered the
100 Meg file on earlier. As Cyrus - a former hacker-turned-surfer -
delves deeper into the mystery, he finds he must fight his own disbelief
at the situation he's found himself in at every turn. Adventure ensues,
drawing bikers, FBI agents, employees of Sigma Systems, the owner of the
company herself, and even the thunderbolt-tossing God of Mount Olympus
Zeus himself into the fray.

It takes over half of the book before Cyrus let's himself believe that
Euterpe is trapped on the mainframe hard-drive, and he's just as stubborn
about falling in love with Erato. A goodly portion of the book seems to be
devoted to waiting for Cyrus to come around and accept what's happening to
him. This gets a bit tedious at times - especially after the third or
fourth time that he and Erato decide that they can't be together. The
story slows at these points, but manages to pick itself back up again
without being much the worse for the wear.

Despite these problems, ZEUS AND CO. is an enjoyable read, and
definitely worth the price of the paperback. Jones' style seems to be
developing well as a writer, and, in time, he'll overcome these stumbling
blocks. He has the potential to go far in the genre of Comedic Fantasy,
and I wouldn't bet against him.

POSSESSING THE SECRET OF JOY
Alice Walker
Pocket Books
$5.99 US, $7.50 Canada


"There are those who believe Black people possess the secret of joy, and
that it is this that will sustain them through any spiritual or moral
or physical devastation."

Thus begins "Possessing the Secret of Joy", the most recent novel by
Alice Walker, the Pulitzer-prize winning author of "The Color Purple".
From this point forward, we witness the voyage of self-discovery and
revelation of Tashi, the Olinkan wife of Adam.  Adam was the son that
Celie put up for adopion at the beginning of "The Color Purple".

This book is neither a prequel nor a sequel to "The Color Purple", as was
"The Temple of My Familiar", but is rather a detailed development of two
of the characters introduced in "The Color Purple".  It is the existing
familiarity with these characters that makes the reader feel all the
more intensely the joy, pain, and rage expressed within the pages.
With this book, Alice Walker has once again proven herself one of the
foremost storytellers of our time.

The book is a "coming of age" story for every woman who has ever
lived in the servitude of men, tracing Tashi's journey from
servitude to freedom as she realizes that "RESISTANCE is the secret of
joy".

I found this novel to be one of the most compelling I've read in many
years, and highly recommend it.

  Suave Knight,

  I noticed your handle and, intrigued, decided to browse your
  account. What I read there intrigues me even more. You and I share many
  similar interests.

  I'm looking forward to chatting with you sometime, and, eventually,
  getting to know you.

       Sincerely,
           Dragon Lady

    "Damn." Roger muttered under his breath, looking away from the
computer screen. He'd been calling bulletin board systems for nearly three
years now, ever since he'd gotten a modem for his 18th birthday. This was
the first time anyone had ever initiated contact with HIM.
    Roger wiped a bead of sweat from his greasy forehead, in the same motion
knocking a pair of horn-rimmed glasses from his nose.
    "Shit!" The glasses tumbled to the rug below. He couldn't see without
his glasses, not even barely. Momentarily forgetting the computer
(something Roger rarely did) he fumbled about on the floor until, eventually,
his akward hands managed to find his glasses.
    Glasses perched percariously upon his large nose, Roger jumped back in
astonishment as the computer beeped at him, and words swept across the screen.


  <Suave Knight 83168, Dragon Lady 83598 wishes to chat you! Y to chat>=>


    Should I chat with her?, he thought. He'd managed to make many on-line
friends (many more than he had in real life) but, somehow, those friendships
had never developed into anything more.
    He'd met maybe a half a dozen other users in his three years of BBSing,
and, of that half a dozen, only one did he even chat with anymore. None did
he ever see again.
    The one that DID continue to chat with him was nearly as shy as he was
in real life and they had agreed upon mutual consent that they'd probably
get along better on-line than in person.
    It wasn't that he was particulary hideous to look at. He stood an even
six feet tall, weighed nearly 250 lbs., and had short, greasy black hair.
Of course, he wasn't particulary handsome, either. And the thick, nerdy
glasses didn't seem to help matters.
    He had just never learned to get along well with people. Dungeons and
Dragons groups were one thing, to be sure. But actually meeting people and
talking to them in REAL life.. That was something else alltogether.
    Especially women. Even Marjorie, the only girl in his D&D group, made
him nervous. He'd never been able to muster up enough courage to ask a girl
out, and had only been on three dates in his life; they were all set up by
his mother. No, Roger didn't get along at all well with women.
    Roger's thoughts were interrupted as the computer beeped once more.

  Hello!

  Hello. How're you this evening?

  I'm doing just great, thank you. I glanced through your bio this
  evening and found it to be really interesting.

  Thank you. I haven't had the chance to peruse yours yet, but
  I'm sure I'll find it equally as interesting.

  Perhaps. So.. What do you do, Suave Knight? What keeps you awake at nearly
  1 in the morning?

  I'm a science fiction writer and I was working on my latest novel. Decided
  to take a break and see what was happening on here.

  Well, if you're busy..

  No, no. That's allright. I was ready for a break.

  Wellll.. In that case.. Tell me about yourself.


     They had chatted the night through, finally logging off just as dawn
came. They had talked about everything.
     She was from Britain and ran a successful import-export business here
in town. She refused to tell him her age, but she didn't sound a day over 30.
She'd never wed, had been BBSing only a short time, and absolutely LOVED to
read science fiction. .
     This last bit of information had been given because Roger had mentioned
that he was a science fiction writer. Well, who could blame him? If he had
told her he worked at 7-11, would she have continue to chat with him? Of
course not! He'd managed to tell (mostly) the truth throughout the rest of
the conversation, though. Well, except for the fact that he doesn't REALLY
live in a penthouse apartment, nor does he drive a brand new (or even an
old) Jaguar. But those were minor details. She'd probably forget all of that
anyway. At least he'd told her his real name.
     He couldn't get her off his mind. The way she typed. The way he
imagined she talked.
     Roger knew; this time, it was for real! He was in love! Sure, he'd
thought the same thing a few times before, only to realize just before he
made that final step -before he actually met the person- that things couldn't
work out. But this time, this time would be different. They'd meet, she'd
fall in love with him, and they'd live happily ever after. He'd move out
of his parents house shortly after, of course.
     Though only a few hours of sleep could be had before his mid-afternoon
shift at 7-11, Roger slept well. He slept the starry-eyed sleepy of love.


     "Umm.. Er.. Sorry, I must have the wrong number." Roger slammed down
the phone, hands shaking. That was the third time in the last hour he had
dialed her number, only to have his nerve fail him.
     It was only a little over an hour ago that Roger had logged onto the
computer -he always called immediately after work- to find her message
waiting for him. A simple 'Call me' with her phone number. That was it.
Brief, yet compelling.
     And he had called her. Only to hang up when she answered. She had the
most beutiful voice Roger had ever heard. Exotic, deep, and, at the same
time, delicate. The british accent had been there, as promised. He could
almost hear bells as she fatefully intoned 'Hello.'
     Unfortunately, at that instant, that brief pause between her
answering and his being required to speak, he'd clammed up. His heart
began to thunder in his chest, his legs got weak, sweat poured from
his brow, and his eyesight began to fail him. Meekly, he hung up.
     The fourth time, just as his courage was about to fail him again,
he heard his name. "Hello? Roger, is that you?"
     He wanted to answer. He formed the words in his mind. Unfortunately,
his mouth wouldn't cooperate. Defeated, he lowered the phone towards the
cradle.
     "Roger, don't be scared. TALK to me!"
     He froze. She KNEW it was him, for sure. If he didn't say something
now, he'd probably never have the chance again. Drawing up whatever
courage he has accumulated in 21 years, he spoke. "I'm sorry, there's
a bad connection here. Hold on."
     "Allright Roger."
     "There, is that better?" His heart pounded in his chest, threatening
to break out, but he managed to sound calm.
     "Much better, Roger." Her voice resonated over the sprint lines. "I'm
glad you decided to call."
     Silence. "Umm.. Yeah, me too. So.. You've never told me your name."
     Laughter. "How silly of me, Roger. I thought I had. It's Tia." She
seemed to whisper over the phone, causing Roger's thick, hairy skin to
tingle with excitement.
     "Pleased to talk to you, Tia." He tried to laugh, overcoming his
     nervousness a little.

     And so it went on, for three and a half hours. They talked about
everything. What Roger liked to do, where he liked to go, what he did for
a living. (he was even honest with her this time) By the end of the
conversation, Roger was even breathing normally.
     "Roger, we're getting along so well. I have something to ask you, and
I hope you don't think I'm too terribly forward."
     "Go ahead." He choked into the phone. This was it. She was going to ask
what he looked like, or if he'd ever done it with a woman. His hands started
to tremble.
     "Roger, would you like to meet me?"
     Silence.
     "Roger? Are you there, Roger?"
     "I'm here. Umm, what'd you say?"
     "Would you like to meet me?"
     "Of course I would." He did want to, didn't he? Yes, he did. He was done
with being a coward. He wasn't going to blow this one. "Yes, I'd very much
like to meet you Tia."
     She almost seemed to smile over the phone. "Good. How about tomorrow?
What time do you get off work?"
     "Tomorrow's my day off. Umm, what would you like to do?" He was getting
daring.
     "Well, I was thinking you could come over for tea. After that, we'll
see what we feel like doing." She paused, letting her words sink in. "Roger,
I like you very much."
     Roger gulped into the phone, fought not to faint, then responded with
a weak "Thanks."
     "Well, then. How about tomorrow at eight? I'll leave you directions on
the BBS. Sound like a plan?"
     He kicked himself. He'd had the chance to tell her how he felt about her,
and he'd blown it. Sure, she'd caught him off guard. But, still, that was no
excuse. Finally, Roger was really starting to see himself. He was scared.
Scared to take a chance. Her words interrupted his thoughts.
     "Roger? If tomorrow's a problem.."
     This time, his words interrupted hers. "Tomorrow'd be great, Tia. I
like you very much, too. Don't forget to leave me directions in E-mail. Did
I mention I like you a lot?" It all came out in a rush, leaving Roger
breathless.
     Tia purred. "It's a date, then. And, Roger - I'm glad you like me,
too."


     He'd woken early that morning. Actually, there hasn't been much sleep
to wake up from. He'd spent most of the night lying awake in bed, thinking
about what he was going to say to Tia, what she looked like, about where
they might go on their date, and, yes, about making love to her.
     Over and over they'd make love, doing it in the bed, on the washing
machine, with her lying on the kitchen table. Every different way he'd ever
seen, or heard about. Every way he'd ever dreamed about.
     His thoughts (not to mention the bulge in his shorts) were interrupted
by his mother's gruff voice.
     "Roger!" She yelled through his bedroom door, before slamming it open.
"Roger, there's a phone call for you."

     "Roger?" Came the voice from the other end of the phone. "It's me,
Tia. How're you this morning?"
     "Great!" He smiled, as though she could see him. "I'm doing great.
Really looking forward to tonight!"
     "Me too." She purred. "Listen, Roger.. About tonight.."
     That was it. It WAS all too good to be true. She'd changed her
mind, finally realized what a nerd he really was.
     "Roger, the BBS was busy and I didn't want to chance you're missing
my directions. If you don't mind, I'll give them to you over the phone.
Got a pen?"

     Nearly 15 minutes early, his light blue '75 Pinto pulled noisly
into her driveway. The crunch of tires on gravel added to the
ever-present roar of the Pinto, and Roger was sure that he'd probably
scared off the entire neighborhood.
     What there was of it. Tia's house - a beautiful victorian-style
brick home, flanked with amazingly tall trees and bushes - seemed to be
out in the proverbial middle of nowhere. He'd driven nearly a half hour
to reach it, and had never even been this far out of town before.
     It'll be worth the drive, he thought to himself, smiling. If Tia
was even half as beautiful as the mental picture he'd formed, it'd be
worth it.
     Clamboring out of the Pinto, he tried to shut the door with quiet,
calm assurance. Failing that, he DID managed to get it shut without the
usual grinding of metal against metal.
     Slowly, with increasing nervousness, he walked the 10 feet to her
front door. Balling his hand into a fist, he willed it to knock. It
didn't. Trying again, he managed a faint tap against the wood. "C'mon,
Roger. It's now or never." He told himself with a half-smile. This time,
his fist swung hard at the door...
     ...just as the door opened inward. Stumbling with the momentum of
the swing, Roger twisted, turned, and fell head-over-heels at the feet
of the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen in his life.
     "Tia, I presume?" He asked meekly, staring up at her long, sleek
legs. His eyes carressed her form, following up the tight silken skirt
that wrapped itself around her body, around her taut, firm breasts, and
ended in a face from heaven. Deep, silky hair fell down around her face
and full lips, as the deepest pair of blue eye's he'd ever seen gazed
down at him.
     "Only if you're Roger." She smiled, offering her hand.
     Meekly, Roger shook it.
     "No, silly, I'm helping you up!" She laughed, and the air around
her seemed to tinkle with her laughter. Her hands enveloped Roger's and
she pulled him to his feet with barely an effort.
     "Umm.." Mumbled Roger, and he rubbed the toe of his K-Mart sneakers
into the gravel pathway. "I.."
     She leaned forward, sniffing him. "Roger.. You're a virgin, aren't
you?"
     "What?"
     "I said you're a virgin. You are, aren't you?"
     Roger's face reddened, and he looked away. It was all a trick.
She'd set this whole thing up, to make fun of him. Suddenly, he felt
anger rising in his stomach, up through his throat, and he heard himself
saying: "So what if I am? Why does that matter?"
     "Are you or not, Roger? You see," She smiled, licking her lips. "I
like virgins."
     Roger started to get dizzy. Leaning against the doorway to steady
himself, he smiled back to her. "Well, yes, I am."
     "That's all I needed to know." She purred, pulling Roger to her.
Her lips brushed gently against his, then harder, as her hands began to
trail slowly down his shaking body.
     Never before having been in this situation and not knowing what
else to do, Roger kissed her back. His almost pulled back as her tongue
found it's way into his mouth, probing and seeking out his.
     "Oh, Roger." She mumbled, as their kiss intensified. Her tongue
delved deeper into his mouth..and deeper..and deeper..
     Roger couldn't breathe. Pushing her away, he nearly fell again
as serpent's eyes stared deep into his own. A long, forked tongue
flicked about her razor sharp incisors as her hands clamped firmly
around his arms.
     Suddenly, she began to grow and change. Her body elognated as
bluish-green scales ripped through her designer dress, and her lips
turned to a snout. Roger stared helplessly as Tia held him tight, all
the while turning into a ten-foot-long blue dragon.
     He struggled against her firm grasp as razor-sharp talons dug into
his arms. "Wha.. How? Why?" He managed to get out, as her diamond-hard
teeth edged ever more near his head.
     *Simple*, he seemed to hear a voice echo in his head, and knew it was
her's. *I have special... tastes, Roger. I have a taste for you.*
     Roger flung up an arm into Tia's face, pulling it quickly back
minus three fingers. "HelpOhShitHelp!!" He screamed into the night,
struggling against her steel-like grasp. "WhyTiaWhy??"
     *Roger, my love.* The voice rang inside his head, cutting deep into
his psyche. *I have a taste for virgins. What better place to find a
virgin than on a BBS?*
     His reply was drowned out by the sound of her teeth shredding
Roger's body in two.

Desperately Seeking...
Copyright (c) 1991, Tamara
All rights reserved


Look not and ye shall find
a mind of different worlds
a heart that in kind
is searching
Searching
not alone, not without
unaware even
that the search has begun.

Look not and ye shall find
a world of different choices
a life that portrays
a fulfillment
fulfilling
not of need, nor of want
unaware even
that the needs are there.

Look not and ye shall find
a choice of different hearts
a passionate companion
who's growing.
Growth
not of desperation, nor starvation
unaware even
of the passion growing within.

Look not and ye shall find
a heart of different loves
an intimate harmony filled
with symphonies
Symphonies
not of discord, nor melodious unity
unaware even
that the movement has begun.

The Moment Now
Copyright (c) 1992, Joe DeRouen
All rights reserved



She smiles and takes his hand
Dancing in the wind, his breath taken
She runs from him wanting him to come
Taunting, whispering sweet carresses

Promises of today the moment now
Tomorrow a distant gleam in her eye
He catches her they tumble
Lying in the grass he notices she's gone

He cries hammering his fists
Against her memory he rages
Anger gives ways 'gainst sweet sorrow
He finds her in his heart

 
 

                        Thanks for your interest in
         
                                  P&BNet(tm) 
             
             the Pen and Brush Network for Writers and Artists                      

    ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
    ³  P&BNet is a QWK-and-Postlink echo SPECIFICALLY for boards which ³
    ³  cater to creative people, writers, journalists and artists. Our ³
    ³  conferences are tailored especially for that purpose. P&BNet    ³
    ³  is NOT an echo for general interest boards.                     ³
    ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

       P&BNet espouses diversity in creativity. If your users are mostly
       mature individuals who enjoy creativity and creative stimulus,
       who do not need rules for conduct but conduct themselves with
       wit and style, who enjoy a wide range of interests but would
       rather not try to categorize each one... you've found the right
       network for your BBS.

       We don't call ourselves an "elite group" but somehow, that
       description fits.

       First and foremost, we are writers and artists.  Some of us have
       publications on the shelves at the local bookstores; others have
       artwork in various museums and galleries.  Above all, we share
       the same muse - that dream we fall into when we create.

       Many of us are professional publishers, too, and writers will
       find a tremendous research, reference and electronic publishing
       resource with P&BNet.

       We also are a friendly lot with many interests, including
       landscape arts (gardening <g>), cooking, birdwatching, and some
       of the sciences such as astronomy.  In order to keep our network
       focused, we primarily offer conferences for networking between
       writers and artists; but to not constrain ourselves to ONLY 
       those topics. To allow some free-flowing ideas exchange, we don't
       hamper creativity within the bounds of a "conference."  We use
       the conferences for focus, but we don't want to stop a fascinating
       thread that has gone askew of the subject matter.  You see?
       There is a balance... and we do our best to enjoy it.
              
              If you can use a mail door, you can join P&BNet.
         
         We are also using Postlink.  If you are already set up with
         Postlink for another network, you're in great shape to access
         P&BNet from one of our Postlink-capable regional hubs.

 ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
 ³ VERY IMPORTANT: ³ We only have 3 "rules" by which I *insist* you abide:
 ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

 [1] DO NOT join P&BNet if you don't have a decent writers, artists or
     other "creatives" oriented user base at your BBS.

 [2] Do your part to keep your local conference participation ON THE TOPIC
     and AWAY FROM PETTY BICKERING. We rely on the local SysOp to
     keep the network amicable.

 [3] Do your part to remind users to CHANGE THE "SUBJECT:" HEADER when they
     veer away from the original topic of a thread.  

 We do have a few Conference Hosts. These volunteers are leaders
 in their respective fields and therefore are subject matter experts.
 It's their job to help people, focus attention on the subject matter,
 and enlighten everyone with news as it occurs.  We do not want to
 turn our CH's into some sort of police force and therefore ask the local
 SysOp to help out by using common sense and good communication skills
 to prevent, neutralize or "moderate" any bad vibes that may occur between
 users.

 ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
 ³ VERY VERY IMPORTANT: ³ NO P&BNet SYSTEM may cross-echo network
 ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ messages with other echomail networks without
 prior express permission of P&BNet(tm) and it's National SySop, Lucia
 Chambers.  Failure to abide by this request will most certainly result 
 in legal action initiated by P&BNet(tm).

 Network Concepts
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      NODE           A  bulletin board  system that calls  another
                     bulletin  board  system (a hub)  in order  to
                     transfer mail.  A node  doesn't receive its mail
                     directly from any other BBS  (that is, no one
                     calls it to transfer mail.)
                               
      HUB            A  bulletin board system which may or may not
                     call another hub system in  order to transfer
                     mail,  but is called by one or more  nodes to
                     transfer mail.

      REGIONAL HUB   A hub  which calls  another hub  in order  to
                     transfer  mail.  It's  called a  regional hub
                     because  when designing a  network, a  hub is
                     usually placed  in each of the  major regions
                     serviced in order  to minimize long  distance
                     phone charges.

      For example :

                                  P&BNetHub
                                /    \      \
                              /        \      \            
                            /           \       \ 
                        RUBYS          BBS1     BBS2
                        /     \
                      /        \
                    BBS3      BBS4
                                       

 P&BNetHub is the NATIONAL HUB because it does not call anyone for mail.
 BBS1 and BBS2 are NODES, directly linked to P&BNetHub.  BBS3 and BBS4 are
 nodes connected to RUBYS.  RUBYS is a node of P&BNetHub and also a
 REGIONAL HUB since it calls P&BNetHub to transfer mail.
 
 Each hub that is a regional hub  has a HUB ID.  This ID is used by the
 regional hub to identify itself when it calls the hub "above" it to
