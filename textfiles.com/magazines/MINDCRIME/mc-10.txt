These are two articles about John Falcon's arrest that appeared
in the Anchorage Daily News in Alaska:
 
Police Report
 
Hacker accused of computer fraud
A 20-year-old Anchorage man has been charged with four counts 
related to computer fraud. Donald Max Fanning is accused of 
breaking into a computer system at a Seattle-based company and 
illegally charging phone calls to the Federal Aviation 
Administration and MarkAir. The charges also allege that 
Fanning stole property from Elmendorf Air Force Base and 
illegally obtained a password that could have allowed him to 
break into a government computer. Fanning is scheduled to be 
arraigned in U.S. District Court today.

Hacker gets 20-month sentence
 
By S.J. Komarnitsky
Daily News Reporter
 
     An Anchorage man convicted of computer hacking has 
been sentenced to 20 months in federal prison. 
     Donald Max Fanning was also ordered to pay $21,000 in 
restitution and perform 200 hours of community service.
     Fanning, 20, pleaded guilty in June to two counts of 
computer fraud, one count of fradulant use of an access 
device, and theft of U.S. government property.
     Assistant U.S. Attorney Jim Torgerson said the charged 
included stealing computer equipment from Elmendorf Air Force 
Base, illegally charging more than $1,700 in long-distance 
calls to the Federal Aviation Administration and MarkAir, and 
breaking into a Seattle-based computer company. (Typist: I 
know this to be Tera Computer)
     Fanning also posted the code he used to charge calls 
to the FAA on a voice-mail system.
     Torgerson said Wednesday that most of the money - 
about $14,000 - would go to the Air Force to cover the cost of 
the stolen equipment. An additional $4,800 would go to the 
Seattle company to repay its costs in tracking Fanning down, 
while the remainder would be given to the FAA and MArkAir to 
pay for the phone calls.
     Fanning will be on probation for three years following 
his release. As part of his sentence, he will not be allowed 
to own or use any computer during that time.
