                               Getting Even
                  The Sequel Your Momma Warned You About.
                                by h0wcum
 
        Revenge is an art. Cristian belief is to forgive one another, but 
my persoanl belive is to make the fuxers pay for even the smallest 
mistake. The mistake being fuxing with you. Life is short, unfair and 
painfull and I don't have time to waste getting fucked with. So, to make 
life a little more interesting, I sit around conceiving and implementing 
revenge tactics. Your anger must fuel you. It it the primary driving 
force in seeking revenge. The anger must come from severe intolerance of 
getting fucked with.
 
        I will discuss a few more revenge tactics in this edition. I'd 
like to point out that some are illegal, and some are not. Wether or not 
they are illegal, the do not make a good story to tell a cop, so watch 
your ass and don't get busted. I will not be resposible for your 
implementation or failure to implement these tactics.
 
        Most of these tactics I will discuss require knowing your mark's 
name and possibly his or her address.
 
"They're Coming to Take Me Away!"
        This tactic definately requires knowing your mark's name and 
address, or atleast his name. The first time I pulled this one off, I did 
it from half way across the country. It's great for laughs and it will 
really ruin your mark's day.
        Find the name of a radio station local to your mark. This isn't 
really hard. Find someone in the area to tell you or get it out of 
directory assistance, or you can order a set of yellow pages for your 
mark's area. (always a good idea as it comes in handy. I have about 10 
foreign phone books.). Call that radio station at night, but when you 
expect your mark to be awake. You will pretend to be your mark. Act 
really upset and paranoid and threaten suicide. BE CONVINCING! Talk of 
how the world is against you and you have a gun pointed to your head, or 
better yet, say you popped a huge ammount of pills and time is running 
out on you. Use your imagination.
        If you are certain your mark is not listed in the phone book, 
reluctantly give him your address (yes, he will ask repeatedly). Atleast 
give him your name. He will call an ambulance on the other line while you 
talk. It is especially usefull to use the pill method here because if the 
EMT's think you are dying, they will be more forcefull in hauling your 
mark away. 
        If all goes well, the EMT's will be hauling your mark away to the 
local mental hospital for a 24 hour stay of observation. This is required 
by law in some areas. Of course your mark is going to deny it, but the 
doctors will expect that, and it will keep him in longer if he does in 
fact get taken. The worst case scenario here is that the ambulance shows 
up, and leaves without him. Even if that happens, you can rest assured he 
will not be very happy.
        Suicide threats to radio stations are taken very seriously, so it 
is probable the EMT's will aguire your mark no matter how much he denies 
being suicidal. When I tried this, mr. mark was away for 2 days. (I sent 
him flowers)
        A variation of this tactic would be to call the ambulance and 
skip the radio station. You can make up any medical situation, or you can 
be suicidal to them. If you do, act really out of it, keep forgetting 
things and being contradictory. Make them think you can't remeber from 
one minute to the next. That way, they won't believe your mark when he 
claims not to be suicidal. neighbors get a kick out of watching ambulances.
 
 
PART B: Supplimental Toolz: Fake mail and fake news.
 
        Now before you kiddies get going on this, I know this is old shit.
I know it's been done before and I am merely posting it for the less
informed, so spank me.
 
        Just about every system on the net has a mail daemon running, the
process which handles incoming and out going mail. You can usually connect
to these daemons (on just about any system) by telnetting to port 25 of
that system. Ex:
 
telnet buttfuck.com 25
 
        I'll show you a sample session. Lines beginning with <you> are
what you would type (duh).

---------------------
 
        I embellished a little. my.fake.mail.edu is the mail server you
used, victim.com is your mark's address and buttfuck.com is you. Still,
unless someone points out a better way, there is no way to get rid of this:
 
Received: from buttfuck.com by my.fake.mail.edu; Mon, 12 Dec 94 04:18:54 -0500
 
So, if you can, telnet to somewhere else before telnetting you your fake mail
server.
 
FAKE NEWS
 
        Fake news rox. I allways post fake news to the gay areas of usenet.
You can either post to gay areas, post to alt.test to get your mark about
1000 automatic replies, or cross post wildly to groups that have nothing
to do with what you are posting about so that every Mr. Butt-cheese will
write your mark (and his postmaster which could get him kicked if
enough complaints come in) bitching of an inapropriate cross-post.
        You can't telnet to just any NNTP server and post. You can usually
only do it from a host in the NNTP's domain. So use a hacked account for
this. Some sites use a seperate news server in their domain for news. If
you can't find the site, type tin -r and watch for "Connecting to
news.masterbation.com" (or whatever) to find the host then telnet to that
site. You will be using port 119, folks, and if any1 knows an anonymous
access NNTP server, lemmie know. Here's an example:
 
200 bondage.buttfuck.com InterNetNews NNRP server INN 1.4 20-Mar-93 ready 
(posting ok).

        bondage is the NNTP server and sodomy is the host you posted from
so be sure to use a hacked acct. Like I said most of this is common
knowlege to all hackers. The trick here is most effective use out of it.
Use your imagination. People get really pissed on UseNet. Time Magazine
recently wrote an article on UseNet and how people who cross post get
thousands of nasty replies. One good use of this is to incorporate the
"Make Money Fast" scam into this and cross-post to every group from your
mark. Time said a lot off ppl got pissed, a lot. So do it up. Remeber, if
you're gonna get revenge, don't do it with sticks and stones, do it nuclear.

JUST IN: (old news, but I just found it) These are NNTP servers
which you can telnet to from anywhere:
