        For those of you who collect comic books, you probably know
   that it can be an expensive hobby.  For those of you who don't collect
   comic books, trust me.  Even if you don't collect comics, this file may
   be of some use to you.  Comic books, like basball cards, can be(come)
   very valuable; so you could acquire and sell comic books, or give them
   away to friends, relatives, etc.  Also, to those of you who don't collect,
        I suggest you start- its damn fun.  There are comics for everyone.
 
===-
 
        First, you'll need a place to steal comics from.  This could
   be a local bookstore or a supermarket with a comic book stand.  But,
   the Best place would be either a comic bookstore, or a comic book
   convention.
        In a place like a bookstore or a supermarket, you could
   hide the comic book(s) inside on another, in another book or magazine,
   or just take it.  When I say 'just take it', i mean discretely, like 
   hiding it or something.  Stick it under you shirt/jacket, whatever.  
   The best way is to roll the comic book (gently!!!  if you bend it, 
   it may not be worth shit!) a little, then stick your hand and forearm 
   through it, then put your sleeve over that.  That may seem a little 
   complicated, but I've found it to be the best/most discreet way.  
   Or you  could always walk out of the store it.  
   
        Many times people won't even think that you are stealing it.  
   If they do, just say that you bought it somewhere else.  If you are 
   going to say that, you may want to bring along a bag from a comic 
   bookstore plus make up a fake receipt on your home calculator(on that 
   you can print up numbers and shit on), or you COULD do it with your 
   computer/printer.  If you bring along the bag, you'll probably get 
   away with taking more stuff.
 
   STORES & CONVENTIONS
        Comic book stores and conventions are sometimes better to steal
   from because you can get older/more valuable/more rare comic books than
   at a bookstore or something.
   
        Choosing the store is very important.  You want to find a store
   that is poorly run, somewhat spacious, and does not have any employees
   walking around watching you.  At most of the larger comic book stores,
   they'll have a television with some sort of sci-fi movie playing, if
   you've seen the movie before, you're in luck.  The employees are usually
   watching the movie.  Listen to the employees talking to see if there is
   a part of the movie that they especially want to see.  If that part isn't
   too far away, you'll want to make your purchase RIGHT before it comes on.
 
        It also works to your advantage if the employees are having a discussion
   If you are a veteran collector, and there is a particular store
   you hate, because of the owner being an asshole, Whatever, you'll probably
   want to hit this store.
 
        Once you have found the comics you want, you can try a few different
   things.  If you didn't already know, in comic book stores, all back issues
   are stored in a plastic comic-sized bag with a thin piece of cardboard o
   the back (but inside the bag) to keep the comic book safe.  One thing
   you can do is get some newer issues off the new issue rack-section-type-
   thing, then open up the comic bag, look through the comic book a little 
   (as if you are deciding whether or not to purchase it) then, as you 
   are putting the comic away, put a new issue or two inside the bag also.  
   Remember to put these behind the back issue that was originally in the bag.  
   Then look around a little longer, then casually go and buy your comic 
   books.
         Another thing to try is somewhat easier, but requires more
   planning, and only works if you have some experience collecting.
   First of all, you'll need to find a comic book worth stealing.
   You don't HAVE to for this plan to work, it may even work better if
   its any old comic, but its just not worth it unless you find a comic
   worth stealing.  I suggest a comic in the $20-$60 price range.  Also,
   and this is the important part, make sure that it is either not very
   popular AT ALL, or that it has 2nd, 3d, etc printings that look exactly
   the same as the first printing.  Next, go to the comic book store and
   find that comic book and check to see if they have 2nd or 3rd, etc,
   printings that are cheaper than the first printing.  Remember how the
   price label looks (you may even want to take a piece of paper and copy
   it right there - say you're checking how much comic books are in a couple
   of places to compare prices or something), now go home and make that label
   again.  The next day, go to the store and put that copy of the label
   that was on the later printings on the FIRST printing (right over its
   old label).  Now the first printing looks like a later printing, and
   has the same price as a later printing.  Now, just like before, wait til
   the employees are preoccupied, then make your purchase.  You may want to
   buy some other comics at the same time so they don't get suspicious.
   
        For those of you who collect comics: a perfect comic to do this with
   is the Vampire Lestat #1.
   
        Conventions can be handled somewhat the same way as stores, but
   there are usually more people watching you at all times at a convention,
   so it can be much harder.  An essential at a convention is a bookbag and/or
   a binder.  The best thing to do at a convention is to look at the boxes
   that the dealers have set up under the table; the larger dealers usually
   keep the stuff they couldn't fit on their table under the table.  While
   under the table, keep your bag right next to you, OPEN.  Take out some 
   comics that you'd like out of the box along with some others, proceed 
   to look at some, then put some down next to the opening of your bag, 
   and when no one is looking casually, but quickly, slip them into your bag.
        But using methods like those above work too, especially putting 
   comics in a bag with other comics and buying just one (with the others 
   in the bag).  You can find conventions by looking in comic book price 
   guides or magazines(Wizard, Comics Vaules Monthly, Comic Books Buyers 
   Guide, etc), in a section entitled 'Conventions!'' or something 
   self-explanatory like that.

        There are more methods than I've described above, but some were 
   little complicated, some too simple, some just variations on stuff above
   and some i just didn't feel like putting in.  Again, if you don't collect,
   I suggest starting a little before trying any of this, just so you have the
   general feel of being at a store and/or a convention; and also cuz its fun.
        For those of you who do collect, be careful and not too greedy.  If 
   you  have any other ways to get comics, problems with what I wrote, 
   questions, etc, please leave me mail or talk to me on IRC or something 
   like that. Cya l8r....
