                        How to mess up department store Macs
                              By C-D and Walrus
 
        Messing up department store Macs is a fun a wholesome activity 
        that can be enjoyed by the whole family. Some of these might 
        be to complicated to do in a store without people getting suspicious,
        but they are fun anyways. Here's some favorites!
 
*       Make a copy of the system folder, leave it next to the other system
        folder. This will screw up the system, and to boot you will need 
        a system disk.
 
*       Make tons of copies of all the extensions in the extension folder. 
        This makes the startup a very slow one, and could cause conflicts
 
*       Bring a modified system and finder from home. You should have 
        edited it with ResEdit, for example make the "Are you sure you 
        want to empty the trash?" dialog into something like "The gamma 
        correction buffer on this monitor has failed, please step away 
        from the monitor and seek help from a qualified technician".
        
*       Get a startup pict <note it must be a perfect fit of the screen> 
        of a dialog box saying "Are you sure you wish to purge your ROM? 
        This process is irreversible" and have the cancel button grayed out. 
        A couple more you could try:
        
*       Switch the empty and bulging Trash icons, so that the trash looks 
        empty when it contains files, and bulges when empties.
        
*       Edit the balloon Help text strings (most of the are in easy-to-access
        STR# resources so that pointing to a window's Close box produces 
        a help balloon that says "click this box will cause 
        irreparable damage to the motherboard"
 
*       Edit the MENU resource to turn a separator line in a menu into an
        alluring new menu command (like "Double Processing Speed") that 
        doesn't work.
 
*       Use ResEdits MENU editor to change all text in menus to white, 
        rendering the commands completely invisible. (they still work, 
        you just can't see them)
 
*       Replace the standard alert box icon with the System Bomb icon.
 
*       Re-map the keyboard so that pressing any key produces a semi-colon.
 
*       Change the names of an applications menus, so that the File 
        menu contain the Format commands and vice-versa
 
*       Install a desktop pattern consisting entirely of Trash can icons, and
        then hide the trash in the pattern.
 
*       Create a startup screen that features a realistic System bomb message,
        urging the user to restart the Mac immediately.
 
*       Switch the trash and hard drive icons, give them each others names. So
        much fun to watch them trash the whole hard drive.
 
*       To crak At-Ease, simply hit the programmers switch and type  G FINDER .
 
        This will quit At-Ease and return you to the finder for your hours of
        wholesome fun. If you don't have a programmers button, you can also 
        try command power <the key in the upper right corner> which might 
        or might not work.
 
*       If you really want to down the Mac, make some files in teach text 
        (about3-5). Name them all .sony . Put one on the desktop, one in 
        the first HD window, one in the System folder. If you have any left,
        sprinkle them gingerly through the System folder. Restart, and the 
        Mac will attempt to use the files as Hard Drive Drivers. This can 
        completely corrupt the hard drive, its tons of fun.
 
*       Unplug and plug back in the ADB cables, this makes all the ADB devices
        work very oddly.
 
*       Randomly unplug cables, and plug them back into other sockets. Its 
        great to see the expressions on sales peoples faces.
 
*       Switch the keyboard type in the control panels, this will mess up
        everything you type.
 
*       Take an old disk and bend the metal sliding cover thing a bit out. Put
        the disk in, and then try to eject it, if it came out bend the 
        metal more and put it in again. This works like an arrow or fishhook, 
        it goes in but does not come out.
 
*       Push the restart button, and then repeatedly push the programmer 
        button while the startup sound is playing, then leave the computer 
        sitting with the sad Mac.
 
*       Remove the monitor cable just a bit, so that everything appears green,
        or red, or purple=8Apsychedelic!
        
*       Name the finder 'finderL' Restart and run away, watch as dumbfounded
        salespeople open the case to make sure the HD is really there.
 
*       Make all the icons that are root folders invisible , and name 
        them with=spaces. Watch the clerks go nuts!
