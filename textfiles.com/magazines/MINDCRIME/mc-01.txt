                               Introduction  
                             
        Welcome to iSSUE #2 of MiNDCRiME. Things are rolling now, we are 
a little late with this issue because some of our authors are late 
sending in their articles. The initial reaction to MiNDCRiME has been 
mixed. There are people who say it rox, and there are ppl who say it sux. 
Nevertheless, I have been highly sought after since publishing the first 
issue.
 
MiNDCRiME is:
        h0wcum  : editor
        Valgamon: assistant editor. (welcome aboard!)
        iP      : global co-ordinator.
        oJ      : Staff dude
        Digital : Staff dude
 
        So here is the second issue. I hope everyone gets a little 
something from it. Enjoy and don't get caught.

                           About Article Submission
 
        Some people have pulled me aside on IRC to tell me they thought 
certain submitted articles in issue #1 were lame. I'd just like to point 
out that the people who write for us put a bit of effort into their work 
and it isn't fair to shoot them down so quickly. I'd also like to add 
that if you hotshots think you can do better, you are *more* than welcome
to submit an article.
        Remember, next time it could be you they are saying wrote a lame
article. We try hard, Valgamon and I to put out the best magazine that we 
can. You can take your attitudes and put them where the sun don't shine. 
If you have some constructive criticism to offer, we will be happy to 
hear it, but if you want to cop an attitude with us, you can eat me.

                              Thoughts on IRC  
                                 by h0wcum
        
        As you all know #hack is +i. I'd like to start off this message 
saying that I intend no disrespect to any of those who have chosen to
make #hack invite only. This is merely my opinion, which is shared by
many, even those who choose not to gripe openly about it.
 
        For quite some time #hack has had its doors open to all who wished
to enter. That was the essence of the channel. The only time I have known
#hack to be invite only is when the channel has been taken over, and it
it appears now that it has been taken over for the final time, on a more
permanent basis.
 
        No one person, or small group of people own #hack. No one has the
right to make the channel invite only: it's like inviting or refusing
quests to someone elses' house. You have no right to make #hack +i. It's
*not* yours. The decision to make #hack +i was brought about by
one individual and supported by others. It is, however, contested by 
many, some of which who are ops, who have tried to make #hack -i and
ended up in a +i <--> -i war with len.
 
        Let's forget for a moment that you have absolutley *no fucking*
right to make any permanent descisions on the channel. Let's forget that you
have to be re-opped evertime you join #hack and that #hack does not
automattically role out the red carpet and op you when you join. Let's
examine, if you will, the inconvenience factor. 
 
        I usually get invited to #hack, that is, when ops are awake. Getting
into the channel at night or even at 8am is another story. Check it:
 
<-[len]-> invite #hack 
*** len is away: ask mark ][ceman or loki or y or loq
<-[mark]-> invite #hack 
*** Mark is away: Doing evil thigns to evil things
<-[][ceman]-> invite #hack 
<-[y]-> invite #Hack 
*** y: No such nick/channel
<-[loq]-> invite #hack 
*** loq is away: ZZzzzZZZ...msg len loki ragent gentry for invite
<-[ragent]-> invite #hack 
*** ragent: No such nick/channel
<-[gentry]-> invite #hack 
*** gentry: No such nick/channel
<-[loki]-> inite #Hack
        
        .... or my personally favorite circular reference:
        
<-[len]-> invite 
*** len is away: ask mark
<-[mark]-> invite 
*** Mark is away: ask len
 
        As you can see, one has to fuck around for a time just 
to get an invite. You end up in a big circle of invite /msg's 
just to get into a channel that should be allowed in with no 
hassle.
 
        This is rediculous. I emplore those who are holding 
#hack hostage to take a fucking step back and realizee that 
you have exactly *squats* worth of authority to make it +i, 
especially when there are so many against it. len, you don't 
own #hack, I don't know who you are, but in all my time on 
#hack, I've just started to see you around in the last few 
months, unless you went by another nick.
        
       I don't wanna blow sunshine up anyone's ass, but I'd 
like to open this to a vote. If you are a non-op on #hack, send
e-mail to our address and explain your position on this. Also, I am
not trying to blow sunshine up anyone's ass, but this shit has got to end.
