What is The Mickey Mouse Club?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     The Mickey Mouse Club was founded by Cardiac Arrest and The Dark Lord.
The name MMC came about because we couldn't think of a better one.  We are
basically a cracking club.  Aside from cracking, we write instructional text
files, and an electronic magazine called Hackers Unlimited Magazine, designed
to help beginning hackers and phreakers.  We are also the authors of programs
such as Data Protect, a file that, as the name implies, provides features such
as data ecnryption/decryption, file hiding, file clearing, and several other
functions.

MMC Membership
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Since we are still a comparitively new group, we are looking for members
of the underground BBS community who can do one or more of the following :

     * Crack games (or other programs)

     * Draw crack screens

     * Write instructional text files about phreaking, hacking, carding, etc

     * Contribute to Hackers Unlimited Magazine in other ways than files

     * Write programs beneficial to the hacking community (ie code hackers,
        etc)


     If you are interested in applying for the MMC, contact either Cardiac
Arrest or The Dark Lord.  If you fit into the above specifications, we will
give you permission to fill out our application.  After completion, upload
your application to the BBS you downloaded it from.  Your membership will be
considered ONLY if you received the application with permission.  It will be
based entirely on the application (ie, your truthfullness and knowledge).

Hackers Unlimited Magazine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     The Mickey Mouse Club puts out an electronic newsletter/magazine called
Hackers Unlimited Magazine.  This magazine is devoted to informing the hacking
community about hacking, phreaking, carding, or anything else or interest.  It
is geared towards beginners, but we hope some experienced hackers will benefit
>from it also.  The editors of the magazine are the founders of the MMC, Cardiac
Arrest and The Dark Lord.  ANYONE may write for HU magazine, and we would like
to encourage readers to submit any articles they have written to a HU Support
Board.  We would also like to encourage comments, complaints or suggestions.

Where You Can Contact Us
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Cardiac Arrest and The Dark Lord can be contacted on most pirate boards in
Denver (303/CODEN), as well as various BBSes around the country.

     Hackers Unlimited Magazine is an ongoing newsletter, and we will release
issues as regularly as possible.  To do this we will need readers to contribute
articles for the magazine as often as possible.  We ask that if you feel you
have something good to write about that will fall within the guidelines for
Hackers Unlimited, please submit it.  However, we do take pride in the magazine,
and we will only accept articles up to our standards.  Do not be discouraged if
your article is turned down.  Although this is not a thing that is expected to
happen, if we feel the article is not good, then we do reserve the right to
turn down your article.  Please don't let that stop you from writing your
article.  Ninty percent of the articles will NOT be turned down, and by having
this policy, we are not wanting to scare off the good writers.  We ask that you
keep the topic within the guidelines, and make it to the best of your ability.
If your article IS turned down, the editors may make suggestions, or, if the
changes are minor, permission to edit the file.
      One thing to keep in mind, we do not base our decisions on the
type of computer you own, reputation that you have, age or anything else
unrelated to the magazine.  The decision whether the article stays or goes is
based STRICKLY on the quality of the article itself.  To submit an article just
     find some way of getting in touch with one of the writers of Hackers
Unlimited, or even better, one of the editors, The Dark Lord, or Cardiac
Arrest.  If you do get in touch with one of the writers, you must make sure it
is relayed to one or both of the editors, because it will do little or no good
if we don't know you're out there.  There will be ways listed through out this
magazine on how you can get in touch with us, either through support boards,
Colorado boards, Vmb's etc.  Hope to see an article from you soon and
enjoy.........Hackers Unlimited!!!

       I realize that most of you are just about ready to skip over this
 part of the magazine because Blue Boxes are old news.  Well I have talked
 to a couple of Phreakers who have been doing it for a couple of years (by
 no means beginners) and they were not Really sure what the process behind
 blue boxes was.  Thats why I am writing this.  Ok Enough of the Intro....
       Ok first blue boxes are one of the oldest color boxes there are.
 When the box was first discovered, it was, heheheh, far from a box.  It was
 a whistle.  Good 'ole Cap'n Crunch was the one to discover this.  He was
 messing around with the phone (As usuall) and he found that by blowing in
 his Captain Crunch wistle had got a free call.  He figured out that the
 whole Phone company runs off of tones.  When you dial a number on your key-
 pad, it does not register the number, it registers the tone.  The Cap'n
 was able to simulate one of these tones to get a free call.  This Box that
 created a tone was just great for making calls then, but now they have a
 system called ESS (Electronic Switching System) which is the worst thing
 that could ever happen to a Phreaker.  The ESS can find EXACTLY were the
 call came from, were it was made to, and from there they could get all the
 information on the person(s) who made the call through other methods.
       The Blue Box is an Electronic Box that simulates Tones.  It simulates
 2600hz and 120hz tones.  These tones travel through things called trunks,
 which are kinda like the phone lines.  When you call a number, it will
 reconize the tones that you made in dialing and will goto the destination
 set by the dialing codes.  Once it finds this trunk that it is suppose to
 goto, it will send a 2600hz tone over the trunk (Unless its busy, which is
 like not making the call).  Once it makes this 2600hz tone, it will then
 kill the tone and sends the call to its destination.  If it the line is busy
 it will send the dialer a 120hz tone, which is, you guessed it, a busy
 signal.
       What the Box does, is this exact thing, to where you are sending your
 own tones and by passing haveing to go through though Phone company, where
 you will be charged.  Well, you went through the phone company, but you
 kinda took control of the operators system.  When the lines came through,
 the operators would give it the tones needed to carry on.  With the blue
 box, you do that for her, only registering it as a free call. Once again
 though, the ESS can find these and tell where they came from, which is the
 exact reason why they aren't safe, because the will catch you in the act.
       I know this is probably old news to some of you, but hopefull some
 did not know what actually happened and know have that knowladge.

                                    Overview
                              Wireless Transmitters

                               Special Thanks To :
                           [      The Mad Bomber     ]



Introduction :  This file is divided into two parts.  In the first part of the
~~~~~~~~~~~~   file, I will try to present a general overview of bugging and
electronic surveillance.  The second part of this file deals with one method
of bugging: Wireless transmitters.  I will give a description of wireless
transmitters and will show several variations of this method.  I have called
this file "Part I", but I'm not sure how many additional files (if any) will
be added to this series.

NOTE:  I won't lie and say I'm an expert on bugging.  I have NOT tried all of
the methods presented here.  However, between myself and The Mad Bomber, most
of the bugs in this series have been tested.  I am writing this to inform
people of these methods and provide some simple methods that SHOULD work.  I
will also list all of my sources and also a list of mail-order companies that
sell bugs and the like.


[--------------------------------[ Overview ]---------------------------------]

     The American Heritage Dictionary defines "bug" as "A small hidden
microphone or other device used for eavesdropping."  Bugs of the late
80's-early 90's can be nearly any size.  The cover of Popular Science (August
1987) shows an electret microphone 3/16 inch across at it's widest point.  They
can be placed so as to be nearly impossible to dectect.  Bugs can be placed in
electronic devices (such as phones or radios), wired into existing electrical
wiring, or an empty pack of cigarettes.  In this country, bugs are commonly
sold as "home security devices" or "hearing aids", and in Europe an Asia, bugs
are openly sold as bugs, although they're illegal there, as they are here.
     Bugs can be broken down into three basic classes: bugs with a microphone
and a transmitter; bugs with only a microphone; and, bugs that sit inoperative
until a specific radio signal is received.  The first type are by far more
common, being simple to make with components available at Radio Shack, or they
can be assembled as plans, kits, or assembled, from companies such as
Information Unlimited.  With a few dollars and a little persistance, a person
with little or no knowledge or electronics can assemble a simple bug in less
than a day.
     Electronic surveillance is legal in only one highly controlled situation:
when law-enforcement agencies receive a court order allowing surveillance of a
suspect.  However, bugs are widely used to get a leading edge over a competing
corporation, for blackmailing purposes, or simply to find out a little more
about a person.


Hiding A Bug :  There are several easy methods of hiding bugs, both from sight
~~~~~~~~~~~~   and detection.  Sight is usually no problem.  Simply drill a
hole in the wall, insert the bug, and patch it up again, or cover it with a
picture, etc.  Or place it in the handset of a telephone.  A matchbox is a
perfect hiding place for a den or family room with a fireplace.  The
possiblities are as limitless as the bugger's imagination.
     Hiding the bug from detection is the tricky part.  You could set the
transmitter to a frequency very close to a local TV station, so that it is
overlooked during scanning.  More complicated bugs are possilbe of changing
frequecies several times per second, but this is very expensive.  One expert
says that during the construction of a building that is to be bugged, simply
mix thousands of diodes in with the concrete.  That way, when scanned, the
entire walls would appear to be bugged, and it would be impossible to guess
where to start looking for real bugs.  Passive bugs that turn on only when a
certain radio signal is received could simply be turned off when a person
enters the room.  A more down-to-earth method would be to simply place the
bug inside an electronic device, say, a simple radio.  When the radio is
scanned, the electronic devices inside the radio cover up the bug.

Aquiring A Bug :  Anyone with a little money can aquire a bug.  It just depends
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   on how much you're willing to spend.  This could range from a
few dollars to buy a Radio Shack wireless transmitter and removing the shell,
to a black market bug in the thousands of dollars.  Bugs are also readily
available in kit form from mail-order companies for as cheap as $20.  In
several foreign contries, bugs are sold openly on the streets.  Or, if you want
to save a few bucks, you can go to Radio Shack, buy a few inexpensive
components, and build your own.

Some Interesting Bugs :  From various sources I found some interesting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   variations of bugs.  These are some of my favorites.

Martini Olive Bug
-----------------
     This now infamous bug was designed by a San Francisco security expert
named Hal Lipset.  To make a "martini olive", hollow out opposite ends of a
piece.  Throw all the components into these holes (there's only about 12).  He
also figured out how to cut open a small (AAA) battery and use the parts to
make a tiny power supply.  The olive is completed by making a mircophone out of
foil.  The olive shaped case is made with fiberglass putty.  You can then make
an antenna shaped like a toothpick.  Just serve it to the person you wish to
bug.


Picture Hanger Bug
------------------
     This one's looks like, of course, a picture hanger.  It's about 1/4 inch
long with a picture hanger on the end.  Just drill a hole, insert the "hanger",
and replace the picture.  It could sit there forever without being discovered.


Electret Bug
------------
     This is the bug shown on the cover of Popular Science.  It is of the
second class of bugs, using only a microphone.  You are required to run two
thin wires to the bug for operation.  However, this could be as simple as two
thin stripes of metallic paint, covered up with normal house paint.  An
electret bug is made by polarizing certain types of plastics or waxes with a
high voltage.  A hole the size of a pinhead is where the sound enters.  The bug
pictured on Popular Science measured only 3/16 inch at it's widest point!


Window/LASER Bug
----------------
     When sound is generated, window panes vibrate slightly.  Using inexpensive
equipement, such as a General Electric H1A1 Laser and an astronomical
reflecting telescope available from Edmund Scientific Company, these vibrations
can be translated to reproduce the original sounds.  This is done by bouncing
the laser off of the window, and interpreting the modulations of the beam that
returns.


Computer Bug
------------
     About three years ago, in Olympia, England, a British electronics engineer
entered a computer show, where the emphasis was on somputer security, wheeling
a cart.  As he walked, he adjusted a few knobs and soon a display screen on his
cart duplicated the monitor of an Epson PC AX.  The machine cost under $500,
and was designed by a Dutch researcher named Wim van Eck.  A monitor works by a
beam sweeping across the back of the screen.  Whereever the monitor is to be
dark, the beam is turned off.  Where the monitor should be light, the beam is
turned on.  This switching of the beam creates a digital signal.  Eck's machine
translates this signal and transfers it to a receiving monitor.  The only
problem is synchronizing the sweeping beam.  However, Eck built a circuit to
discover the original sync and match the receiver to that signal.


Toilet Bowl Bug
---------------
     Have you ever played that game in a swimming pool where one person talks
and the other tries to figure out which direction it came from, but it seems to
come from every direction?  This is because water is an excellent conductor of
sound waves.  Get the picture?  Why not just stick a bug on the piping of a
toilet?  That way, you could pick up all conversation (or any other noises)
>from that bathroom.


KGB Bug
-------
     In February of 1982, the manager of a Soviet airline was arrested for
espionage.  Authorities became suspicious of a scar on his chest, which he
claimed was from an operation.  After a closer look, however, they discovered
that the KGB had surgically implanted a bug inside his chest to monitor all
conversations occuring around him.

What The Future Holds :  As we enter the 90's, bugs will continue to become
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   smaller and less detectable.  One possible solution to
bugs that transmit continuously, which is easy to detect, is to have a bug that
collects information, then sends it in short bursts.  One speculation for such
a bug could collect information for 15 seconds and send it in a burst of 1
microsecond.  Another idea that is already possible in an impractical form, is
a voice-activated bug that shuts off after a conversation is finished.  There
will also be great advances in bug detection.  Although advanced detectors are
available, they are very expensive.  One such instrument, called the
SuperScout, costs approximately $25,000.  And that's owned by a private
businessman.  Makes you wonder what the government spends on bug detection....


Notes On Schematics :  I'm sorry about the ASCII schematics, but there's not
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   really much I can do about it.  I know it'd be better to
do them in extended IBM ASCII, but we're hoping there might be some Apple (or
otherwise) users reading this, too.  Anyways, here's a "key" for some of the
hard to understand symbols.

[--------------------------[ Wireless Transmitter ]---------------------------]

Introduction :  Wireless transmitters are by far the most common, the cheapest,
~~~~~~~~~~~~   and the easiest of all the bugs to build.  I'll present two
different wireless transmitters.  They are all similar in design and function,
but since availability of parts varies for each person, it can't hurt to have
plans for both.  The Mad Bomber and I have both tested both of the methods
presented in this file.

Method #1 :  This method was found in Radio Electronics March 1989.  This
~~~~~~~~~   method transmits over a very short distance (only a couple hundred
feet).  It transmits to any frequency in the normal FM band.  The PC board in
the book is a little less than 4 inches square, but you can make it smaller
with a little patience.  This is a good one to start with, since it's easy to
build and uses common components.

Required Components
-------------------
     Resistors (1/4-watt, %5)
        R1    - 100 ohms
        R2,R4 - 10,000 ohms
        R3    - 1000 ohms
        R5,R7 - 47,000 ohms
        R6    - 2.2 megohms
        R8    - 4700 ohms
     Capacitors

        Q2    - BC183C or NTE199, or equivalent NPN transistor
     Other Components
        L1    - Coil, approximately 1 uH (more on this later)
        M1    - Electret microphone
        S1    - SPST switch
     Miscellaneous
        9 volt battery
        9 volt battery connector
        Wire for connections
        Case to put it in
        Solder
        Soldering Iron
        PC Board or "BreadBoard"

NOTE :  Complete kit available for $13.85 from Prospect Electronics, PO Box

Construction Notes
------------------
For the coil (L1), you'll need to either coil a wire or set an adjustable coil
around 1 uH.  Just make sure there's no bridged, or bad joints when you start
it.

                                                     -

Operation
---------
     After you've built the transmitter, you have to set the frequency.  Set a
normal FM radio to an odd frequency.  Radio Electronics recommends around
88MHz, but in my area up at the high end (108MHz) is a little better.  Have a
friend or brother or someone constantly speak into the microphone while you
adjust the trimmer capacitor.  At one setting or another, you should hear your
friend's voice.  That's all there is to it.


Method #2 :  I came across this design in a book called Build Your Own Laser,
~~~~~~~~~   Phaser, Ion Ray Gun & Other Working Space Age Products (I'll give a
little more info on it in the source list), which is a VERY interesting book,
with 3 different types of bugs, several LASERs, and some other goodies (like
shock-wands, etc).  This is an excellent device, because it is small and can,
according to the book, transmit well over a mile (I've tested it to around a
1/2 mile) with a good antenna.  It is very sensitive, and can transmit sounds
>from all over a house.  The tuning range covers the standard FM band, such as
method #1, and also the lower end of the aircraft band, allowing a completely
interference-free transmission.

Construction Notes
------------------
     The book recommends 1 5/8" square for the breadboard.  My smallest has
been a little less than that size, but I'm not that good at electronics.  The
Mad Bomber made one about 1" by 1/2".  To make L1 (the coil), get a #8 wood
screw (a pencil seems to work fine for me) and tightly wrap 5-10 turns of #16
buss wire around it.

Operation
---------
     Pretty much the same as method number one.  Be sure to tune carefully, or
you'll overadjust and never find the frequency.  Trust me on that one.  The
book also suggests marking the capacitor, which isn't too bad an idea, in case
you accidentally move it.  This bug is EXCELLENT for using in houses etc.  You
can also use it as a "walkie-talkie" when you're out field phreaking or
something.  Just get a walkman type headset radio, and havbe your friend do the
same, and you can talk through the transmitter and listen through the radio.

        StarLink is a really good system that is supposed to replace
 Pc Persuit.  It has many features and improvements that Pc Persuit does
 not have.  Starlink has other features Such as Up to date News Events,
 Many things on current affairs that have been happening lately, Inter-
 active Chat systems that many people can converse with each other through
 the use of there modems.  It has many "Extras" available.  Starlink is run
 by a company Called GTD or Galaxy Telecomunications Division.  It is a large
 and established Telecommunication Company that is in no way a beginner to
 Telecommunications business.   Most of the "Extras" are things that are
 provided by the other companies that are working with GTD to make Starlink
 the Best system of Long Distance calling Around.  Companies such as Tymenet
 have joined with GTC to make this system the way they want it.  One of the
 options available is, at the same time that you are using Starlink, be able
 to use the Tymnet OutDial, to have a farther reach over the United States.

        Not only does Starlink have the little options like the Chat Systems
 and such, the quality of calling has improved.  The Phone lines are said to
 be Much clearer, so you don't have the the same amount of line noise that
 you get with Pc Persuit.  It also has a much faster transmitting system.
 What I mean by that is there is not the horrible Delay that Pc Persuit has.
 I don't want to imply that there is no delay, because that type of tech-
 nology is not yet developed to the point were users will have no delays, but
 the delays have been cut down.  There is also a large increase in the amount
 of areas available for making a call.  Starlink has the capibility to call
 Ninty-One (91) different Cities and twenty-Eight (28) different States.  The
 number of cities and states available for calling is increasing as the
 company expands.  One other thing that is a good thing for the users of
 these systems but a bad thing for us hackers of the systems, is there is
 supposed to be increased security of the system.  I do not know for sure
 if this is true, but it is something that has been said by a lot of people.

        By reading the contents of this file up to this point, you probably
 can't understand why a lot of Pc Persuit users have not switched over to
 Starlink.  There are a couple of reasons for this.  Number one, the system
 is new and people are still learning the things Starlink has to offer.  Not
 only that, but there is one MAJOR flaw.  You have to pay for all the extras
 that the system has, and for the people just looking for the Long Distance
 calling, they have no need for the other things, and the would have to pay
 extra to get what they would never have any use for.  There is not just a
 little difference either.  There is a repsectable margin in the prices with
 starlink not fairing to well.  This probelm is said to lessen because Star-
 Link says that thier prices WILL go down after they have restored the fees
 that have been spent to start the system.  Also, Pc Persuit is said to have
 a rise in there cost, to make the gap in affordablility decrease in size.

        Right now is the best time in the world for hackers.  This is a new,
 good system that will suplly all the needs of the hackers, but besides the
 supposid "Increased Security" there is no other prepreation know to us made
 for the hacking of there system.  Some might say "It is Ripe for the
 Picking".  This system has not seen much action by the hacking community for
 a lot of the same reasons that the paying users have.  The system is new
 and people are just now learning the system, and no one really knows what to
 expect.  Once the system grows, there will be more experimentation by the
 hackers to see what the system is like.

         I hope that this Text file will increase the amount of ativity by
 the hackers.  I hope that they will do more experimenting with the system
 and soon get accounts on the system.  I do not feel that StarLink is ready
 for the hacking community, therefore it is a prime opportunity to explore
 and learn the system. There is software out much like Icex made specifically
 for Starlink and it is called "StarDial".  The newest version that I have
 seen of this software is 2.0.

         Well, happy hacking and good luck.  If you find out any additional
 information on StarLink, Hackers Unlimited would be extreamly greatfull for
 the information so we can update the file so others will have enough info to
 be sucessfull in hacking this system.  Please leave any Information at any
 of our Distribution sites, Vmb's or any other ways you know of to get in
 Contact with A member of Hackers Unlimited.  Thanks and..........

    Remember:  The Night Belongs to...............The Dark Lord!

There is a nifty little trick you can do if you have two or more phone
lines in your house but don't have a phone that handles multiple lines and
does conferencing.  There is a very simple way to do it yourself with a
switch and some phone wire.  The schematic at the end is pretty simple and
should be easy enough for the layman to decipher.

Problem
-------
I have three phone lines but no multi-line conferencing phone!!!  Whaaaaaa!

Solution
--------
Two separate phone lines
Telephone type wire
Solder/soldering iron
Prototyping circuit board (Known as breadboard or socketboard.  Get it
                           at Radio Shack if you are going to use it.)
One phone (preferably with an auto-dialer and
           memory for a couple of numbers)

Procedure
---------

1)  Strip a few mm. of insulation from all of the phone line wires.

2)  Plug the wires into the socketboard so that one line will have wires on
    different rows but on the same side.  (*'s for phone wires, x's for switch
    wires.

            -------------
            | *| x| x| *|
            -------------
            |  |  |  |  |       (Please excuse the ASCII drawing)
            -------------
            | *| x| x| *|
            -------------

Now you can get a switch and connect 2 wires to one side (so each terminal has
one wire) and 2 wires in the middle.  This switch must be able to break the
connection between the two lines, or else you will always be dialing out on
two phone lines at the same time  (it's cool to call a VMB this way)

By now, you should have a piece of bread board with 4 phone wires that aren't
connected to eachother and a switch with four wires hanging off it.  (it
should have 2 positions (one links middle to front, one links middle to back)
you will want to hook up the line with the phone you will be using on it to
the middle and the other line to the front.

Take the two wires hanging out of the middle and plug them into the breadboard
where your main line is hooked into.  Take the wires hanging out the back and
plug them into the lines on the breadboard with your other line.

If when you pickup the phone and hear a fucked up dialtone, try switching the
wires around like trading places with red/green on one side only.  Technically,
you have to hook red to green and red to green with the separate lines.



Schematic Attempt
-----------------
--  or  |   is phone wire.
R1          470k resistors.
SW1         should be the middle terminals of a six-pole, 3 setting switch.
SW2         should be the end terminals of the same six-pole switch.
SW3         should be between the lower-left terminal and middle-left terminals
            of a different six-pole switch.

With enough tweaking of this, you can have a simple system of a memory dialing
phone with the numbers of two favorite enemies set in.  All you have to do is
call the first, flip the switch and call the second.  Make sure your phone has
a mute button because you will be laughing so hard.

I prototyped this on breadboard and you should consider starting yours on
breadboard too.  It is really helpful for debugging your circuit.

                       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
                                               By: The Dark Lord


       Hacking Prodigy is just like hacking any other type of system like
  Compuserve, Genie and stuff like that.  They all run off the same basic
  format as the other.  They have an account and the password which is the
  password of WHATEVER choosen by the owner of the account.  The best way to
  hack Prodigy is to find some one that will be willing to help you, that
  has a account on the system.  If they have an account, they can list all
  the users on that certain system, and when you list it it will tell you
  the owner of the account and the account number they have.  If you know
  someone that is able and willing to do this for you then you have half of
  the battle won.  Just enter the account number and look at the name of the
  owner of the account.  I would estimate that about 10 percent of the users
  will use some part of thier name in the the password.

  Example:
    Account: EJA0632
    Owner: Jamie Wallis
    Pass: J.W
      or  Jamie
          Wallis
          Jam

      That is just an expamle. and with about 10 percent of the people using
  being dumb enough to do that you would think that you would have a real
  good chance, and in reality, you do but consider this, There are usually
  about 300 + users of it.  10 percent of 300 is thirty.  Thirty users out of
  300, that is still going to be a fun little job just to find one of those
  idoits, so don't just jump in thinking that you have it made.
     If you are not lucky enough to know someone that has an account, I will
  let you know some of the formats and lenghts of passwords and accounts.
  The passwords can be anything from Four to Ten digits long.  They can
  consist of any type of charactors like numbers and letters.  The Accounts
  are 7 digits, and it can be either letters and or numbers.
          dgit23j
     I have never found any programs like Pcp Code Hacker.  So, most of the
  work that you have to do will have to be done manually, which will turn
  most hackers off.  You can just hack through your ordinary term programm,
  but to use the system you have to have the software that they use.  The
  software is simply called, yes, you got it, "Prodigy".  You can pick up
  the software for about $30.00, but I see no reason for paying for it.  MMC
  should soon have it out availible for download.  It does have a copywrite
  on it, but thats what MMC is for right?
     If you would happen to get caught hacking prodigy, the punishment would
  be the same as it would for hacking any system, but the thing about it is
  prodigy is not a system that you have to worry about being traced on.  On
  prodigy you get unlimited hours and up to 6 people can be on the same pass-
  word at the same time, so the user really isn't loosing out.
     You are probably wondering what good Prodigy would be for you?  Well,
  other that the hacking of the system, I am not real familiar with it.  From
  what I have heard from the people who use it though, you can do a lot of
  your carding through prodigy.  There is also an On-Line catalog to do your
  carding from.  They have catalogs that you can order computer equiptment
  and things like that.  There are a lot of other little things that you can
  do, but other that, the rest are just the Prodigy B.S that pretty much
  worthless. Prodigy has the News, Online Games and Up to the minute sports
  and other usless stuff like that.  You can also talk to others using the
  system, kind like an online chat with multipul people.  The only reason
  that I hack Prodigy is for the Carding aspect of it.  It is really nice.
    Like I said, I have done a decent amount of hacking on the system, but
  did much work internally, so I am not real sure about everything that is
  has to offer.  Oh well..... I guess its the sport of hacking that is so
  attractive.

                      - NATIONAL NEWS UPDATE -


     Raising Again?
   __________________


       Yes you got it.  The Phone company is trying to rip us off once again.
 Can you belive this crap?  I heard a news report lately where the where
 taking to a spokes person for AT&T and they said it was so they could by
 new, more up to date Supplies.  When asked what types, they replied some to
 keep up with the higher technology of the phone systems, some to replace
 old unsafe tools, and last but not least, better systems to control the
 problem of Phreakers.  Ooooohhhh, sounds like a great solution to me.  So
 they are saying to reduce and or stop the amount of phreakers is increase
 calling costs?  Doesn't make much sence to me, how about you?  I think the
 reason for phreaking is to avoid the tremendous costs of the phone company,
 but when you raise it, I think you might even be making more, right?  It is
 still in the voting and setting up stages though, so it might not even go
 through, and until then, we should just keep our fingers crossed, because
 even though you wouldn't think an increase of costs would effect us, it
 will because some of the money is going to fight Phreakers.


  Hacking & Phreaking
     Update

PBX

        Well we all thought PBX was safe.  Well they still are basicly, but
there is now a new thing that us hackers just found out.  It seems that they
can call your phone company and get your number, which they can tell what
phone company you used by a type of user log that has all the information. On
this user log they have the phone number from were the call is being made.
>From this number they can bill ya. Well we use to beable just to use them but
it seems that they do not want to be ripped off no longer. PBX is such a big
system that they usually don't even want to bother.  But now there are so many
people useing them that they don't know what to do, so instead of shutting
down the system they are going to bust.  It isn't just us hackers that use
these codes but even DRUGGIES, Civilized Bussiness people, and many other
people.  What is wierd is how they drugies got started, they don't use
war dialers or anything, but maybe one of our fellow hackers told them.  It
don't really matter it is just that from thier stupid ways is how we got
reconized.  I was watching Current Afair the other night and they were talking
about Phone Crimes, they caught a billion drugies in the act.  Then they found
how we were useing Code Thief and other programs to do our work.  They even
know how to get programs and how to use them.  What bothers me is that now it
seems that not ONE code is working at the time.  Other systems have been
busting people also just not PBX, I just am reporting on this because of the
number of people who use them.

        On the TV show I was watching they said that about a third of the use
was from ilegal purposes.  And the other 2 thirds was from PBX support
companies.  They estimated that phone criminals have a bill of $80,000 over
the whole bill.  The bill isn't very high but what they say it is still a lot.
We pay for these long distance calls, that PBX is transmitting, threw TAXES.
Can you believe it, and they expect us to be good an dnot use them like we do,
well that is a bunch of shit.  Our taxes should not be used for this, but in
fact the comanies who use them. They are cracking down on the users that
should not be using these codes.  So this is not telling to to stop but just a
little reminder to be careful on what you use.

Cable Piracy

        Well I know almost half of us have used cable ilegaly, but now is
not the time to start. They now have strongly busted people who are hooked up
illegal.  They say if you get caught then you will pay $10,000 fine and a 1
year sentence in jail.  What is funny is that they say if you call them and
say you have it hooked up they will just forget the time you used it illegal
and just start sending you bills.  Well I don't know if that is true but why
would you tell them anyway.  I mean why bother, they will just bug the hell
out of ya anyway, well I don't really know if they will but they say they
wont, they call it the ask no questions plan.  It has just been in the last
few weeks that this has been on the news and on comercials on TV.  Anyway my
point is if you have it hooked up illeglly then think about what you are doing
and see how hard they are busting down in your area, and if you do not have it
hooked up but thinking about it well the choice is up to you.  Just make sure
that you do not get caught.  If you are under 18 it will be your parents that
get in deep shit.

VMB

        VMB's (Voice Mail Boxes) are seeming to decline.  There use to be over
30 boxes, in which half of them were codelines.  Since they reconized that we
are taking boxes it seems that they are changing every day.  I have never
hacked a VMB myself but there are a few guys who have for me.  In which they
say is a "Bitch".  I was given about 5 boxes on one system and lost all of
them in about a week.  Some have there ways of telling others just get
complains from the real box owner.  Boxes seem to get harder and harder to
hack even though they use to be easy (as I am told).  The password format
changes everyday, the boxes are gone with in a couple, but with this pain do
you think we will stop?  NO!  Hackers seem to find boxes or hack them out some
how. They probably stay up all night just to get one box, and then it is gone
with in a day.  I don't know about you but that is the TRUE hacker to me.
Hackers aren't suppose to give up, they are suppose to be on the move at least
an hour a day.  The thing is, is that some hackers are kids (13-18) and have
to go to school.  But why can't they just take some time after school and hack
a VMB or a CODE or some other system.  VMB's have been around for a long time,
but it seems that we just relized them yesterday.  One thing that worries me
is that will hackers stop hacking?  Well I don't really think so, since man
lived in caves there was hacking.  VMB's will come and go but there will
allways be one that is in control of a hacker.

Field Phreaking

        I allways loved going out and doing a little field phreaking at night.
But the thing that bothers me is how many people have dogs!  I think that
there should be a limit on how many dogs are in a neigborhood.  But the more
dogs I guess the more fun, right?  There are so many things that seems so fun
in the field, fences you have to climb, dogs you have to kick, people you have
to run from, and most of all scaring the shit out of some person who has seen
you.  Field Phreaking is very fun and I encourge everyone to try it.  If you
don't know what this is then try and find out from another hacker or just
download a text file from your local hacking board.  Though I haven't really
got in to the REAL excitement of fielding, I did get in to it a little and
tried a lot, it still seems like a lot of fun.  I mean you wont have to pay
for the call and wouldn't have to bother with codes.  All you would need if
you wanted to modem it on the field job is get yourself a Laptop Computer.
Hell if you are in to carding just TRY carding you one, the chances on it is
very slim but still, what the hell.  You get out in the field and start a
conference and you feel good to brag a little about how you are calling from
Neigbor BOBS house.

                         Jesters Guide to....

                {- 950-0266's for the new Phreaker -}

                          {- 11\6\89 -}


      This is a file I just decided to write, right after a guy
  that lives near me, who runs a bbs complained about his
  outrageously high phone bill, and being that I use 0266's I
  decided that I would TRY to write a text file on how to use the
  0266's as a simple way of phreaking. I am not an expert on the subject
  and I don't claim to be, I am just writing this file to try to help
  out others that are in the same experiance level as the guy that I
  was talking about previouly in the file.
      There are many different types of 950's, but the type I use is
  the 950-0266 and I use these because that is what I was taught
  with and they seem like a fairly good, and easy way to phreak.
  950-0266s are known to have VERY clean lines, so they are
  perfect to use with modems.
      The basic format for these codes are:

  (1)  Dial 950-0266
  (2)  Wait for tone then dial your 7 digit Code
  (3)  Right after dialing your Code dial your ACN (Area Code
       Number)
   I.E. if I were to call my friend Joe in Utah, I would do
   this...
  950-0266 (tone) XXXXXXX8015551234
   The X's stand for the 7 digit code


      950's have known to be dangerouse, they are on ESS (electronic
  switching service) which is a phreaks nightmare. Being that
  950's are on the ESS they can, and have been known to trace.
  The type of tracing service on 950's can trace in a heart
  beat, so there is somewhat a great risk in using these.
* Some precautions about using 950s - Do NOT use the same code
  for more then 3 days. Try to use different codes if you have
  them i.e. call one board with a code like 2314211 , and then
  call the next board with a totally different code. Use these
  codes during prime time, to cut the risk of getting caught
  down. And use these in moderation, do not get crazy with them.

    I hope this file hasnt been to much of a waste of time, I
  hope it has offered some help to you in using 950-0266's.

     I would like to have suggestions and comments on what you think
  of my file.  If you have valid Input, please let me know your opinion
  on one of my Vmb's.  Obviously Vmb's don't last forever, but as for this
  now it is valid.....


 Editors Note: Jesters Box has just been cut before the release of the
  magizine, so as of this time, he has no Vmb's available for comments.
  Information will be updated as it is recived.  Thanks

      I would like to take this time to Explain to you how this was judged.
  First, both me and Cardiac Judged the BBS's on there rating.  Once all the
  catagories were filled, we went on a 1-10 scale and the one with the most
  points won.  This listing is of only Colorado boards, and in no way are
  they the best out, but I wanted to start somewhere.  Heres what we am going
  to do.  Leave me your nominations for the best boards in any of the topics
  besides overall best board.  Once you send in your nomination we will look
  at the board and judge it.  I think the "Best Sysop" part will be taken out
  though due to that fact that a couple of calls cannot distiguish the Sysops
  at all.

  Remember:  The Night Belongs to..........The Dark Lord!

                            .


      First off, If you are wondering What a CBI is it is like a TRW but
  has a different setup.  You can call and with the right information on
  the person you can get the credit cards that they now own, and there
  credit history and all the cards that they ever had.  These are as touchy
  (Dangerous) to use as TRW's but just as much fun.  This is a good thing
  for carders.  It is a way to find a person that is rich, and get the info
  that you need on them, and the get there card and CHARGE, CHARGE, CHARGE!
      CBI's will tell you the amount that you are allow to charge and the
  whole 10 yards.  This is also a very effective way of taking care of people
  that you don't particuarly care for.  All ya have to do it find there card
  (Mom Or Dads) and work from there.  Open your mind to it though.  Don't
  just charge with it, do much more, post it on boards and VMB's, Get the
  needed accounts and close there account.  In other words, make it to where
  they can no longer charge on that card because it has been, how should we
  say....."CUT".  You could also order all the things possible with the card
  and have it all sent to the front door of the person that you are getting
  back at an have everything addressed to him.  If he/She is living with the
  folks, its Murder time, and if not, they have to explain why they are
  returning all the stuff and why they went over there carge limit.  They
  Way CBI's are set up, this is the procedure you will need to take:

  1. You will call and get a connection.  Most CBIs will be 300 baud and
  you will need the settings of 7-E-1.

  2. You will need to carrage return Three times.  Once you have done that,
  hit CTRL-S followed by another return

  3. Enter the Account.  Then Enter another CTRL-S. After that input the
  Lastname, First name, then the Middle Initial.
    Ex.  Wood Sam K

  4. Hit a Return and wait for a couple of seconds (5-10)

  5. Enter the Address, Apt Num. etc..., City then the State and last but not
  least the ZipCode.  The State MUST be an abreviation.

  6. Once again hit the CTRL-S and you can work it from there, doing what
  you need to with the card.

     Now, all you need is an account and a Dial up.  There should be one near
  you, kinda like a 7-11. but I don't have the dial ups to any except for
  the one in the 713 Area code, which is.....(713)591-8900.  Since this is
  a unsecure thing to use, I would suggest a diverter or something like that,
  just makes it a little funner becuase you have better odds of fully
  succeding.

                  .NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
                                                        By: The Dark Lord


         There has been many rumors that have floated around in the year of
  1989 and I imagine there will be a lot more seening that the year is not
  over yet.  The first on that I heard was the one involving FHP (Federation
  of Hackers and Phreakers).  They are a so called "ELITE" group and only the
  "Proud Few" get in.  Around July of this year, there was a rumor going
  around about a spy, if you want to call it that, within the ranks of FHP.
  Supposidly the spy was giving away the working codes to the Phone Companies
  and giving away the dial-up that are used a lot because they are considered
  to be safe.  The spy also was said to be turning in a lot of the memebers
  of FHP and some other in and out of the orginization.  FHP took immediate
  action in freezing all applications until the whole ordeal blows over.  I
  cannot tell you whether this rumor was or was not true, simply because
  I was and outsider looking in. I was not in the group, and besides what
  information I had gathered I did not know what was actually going on within
  the group.  I dunno if FHP actually found the person, if the person left,
  but was never descovered, or that "Person" was just a rumor.  Either way,
  there was disorder within the group because as I recall I had sent in my
  application and I was assured in by one of the Higher members, but they
  never seemed to, Unfreeze, the application process.  Nothing against FHP,
  but from wht I see where it is going now, I am kind of glad.
      Another rumor was one of a Pcp Code.  It was a carded account and it
  was caught before the person recived the information on the account (Pass,
  account #, etc....).  Instead of killing the account and not sending the
  informtion to person, they went on with it but traced the account.  I am
  not sure how often they traced but I imagine that it was a decent amount.
  I dunno if this rumor was actually true of just a coinsidence but a person
  I know did get snagged on a Pcp.  Hopefully you do learn for this little
  expedition, that it is not one of the wiser things to do, Carding a Pcp
  account that is.
      Yet Another Rumor that was going around is a trap Pbx.  The dial up for
  this Pbx is still in service.  It had the procedure of 9 + 1 + ACN and that
  was said to be specifically designed as a trap.  I have used Pbx's for a
  long time now and to this day I have never heard of ANYONE getting in any
  trouble over any Pbx's, that is the reason I had trouble beliving it.
  Once I heard this rumor, I did a little research of my own on the Pbx's and
  I found a couple of intresting this proving the rumor to be false.  Let me
  give you a list of them, then I will explain them more thouroghly.

     d No one had been Busted for the Code
     d The Part that was set up for the trap was the same procedure as most.
     d That dial-up, to that point was supposidly "Virgin"
     d Phone company workers said nothing was said about that particular one
     d Difficulty of a Pbx trace
     d The attitude taken by the Pbx owner

      Those are the major pieces of information that I got.  First, no one
  was busted on the code.  The whole rumor was total speculation.  Second,
  The thing that was supposidly the "Trap" part of the code (9+1+ACN) was the
  procedure used by multiple Pbx systems.  Third, the dial up for the Pbx was
  supposidly Virgin which would mean that the owner of the Pbx system would
  have to move extreamly fast.  Fourth, I know many people that work for the
  phone company.  They hear a lot of the stuff that is going around, and some
  even do the traces themselves and none that I talked to heard a thing about
  it although there are many that they never hear about.  Fifth, One on the
  workers of the phone company that I know has installed a lot of Vmb and Pbx
  systems.  He said that it is REALLY hard to trace on a Pbx because of all
  the switching the system does.  And he even went on to say, if you get on
  certain trunks in the system it is nearly IMPOSSIBLE to trace.  Last, the
  attitude of most of the companies owning the Pbx is in the favor of the
  phreakers.  They are so big, they never miss the money, and not only that,
  they can take the damn thing as a tax write-Off.  Before I go any further,
  I would like to thank the people who supplied me this information.  I will
  only mention one, because he is the only one that has an alias.  That
  person is Kedma Oediv.  Thanks Kedma!!
      The Last one that I will talk about is really vauge.  I have heard VERY
  little about this one, but I figured that you might like to hear about it.
  It is a very new one, and supposidly there is a FBI agent in the 804 area
  code, logging on most of the pirate boards, gathering informtion on people
  so they make make a bust.  That is all I know about it, but it is kinda
  a word of caution.  If you call or live in this area, you want to be a
  little cautious, but don't worry about it.  Ninty percent of the rumors I
  have heard I have gathered enough information to say that they were a bunch
  of crap.
      Well there was a couple others, and like I said, I imagine many more,
  but those are some of the ones that I heard the most about.  I will try to
  keep you updated on the newest ones, so you can put them to rest once and
  for all, cause I know I have wondered about some of those that are still
  hanging around in the air somewhere.
      One last thing that although is Kinda Dorky, but I just HAD to add this
  for some reason.  Well its really not a rumor, but I'll say it is for the
  sake of argument.  Teenage Warroir is a COMPLETE DICK, and has Millions of
  alias's just so he can get access to boards.

     A lot of the listing and things like that might be WAY out of wack. It
  is extreamly hard to keep up with the listing due to the way all the Vmb's
  and stuff die so rapidly.  The problem wasn't as bad as in the last issue,
  but there has just been a massive killing on the boxes, and a lot more are
  expected to go, so like I said, its hard to keep an accurate list right
  now.  Sorry for the inconvience, but we will try to keep it as up to date
  as we can up to the release of this issue.  Thanks....
