  there was and still is a BIG request for an overview of definitions, and
  we just ran out of time, so just bear with us.

     A lot of the listing and things like that might be WAY out of wack. It
  is extreamly hard to keep up with the listing due to the way all the Vmb's
  and stuff die so rapidly.  The problem wasn't as bad as in the last issue,
  but there has just been a massive killing on the boxes, and a lot more are
  expected to go, so like I said, its hard to keep an accurate list right
  now.  Sorry for the inconvience, but we will try to keep it as up to date
  as we can up to the release of this issue.  Thanks....

     Well, that is it for "Hackers Unlimited".  We hope you enjoyed, and have
 gotten a lot of information from, it.  There was a lot of time, and a lot
 of effort put into this from a lot of fine writers.  The editors of Hackers
 Unlimited would like to thank these people for contibuting to this fine piece
 of writing, both in the writing of articles and the support of this project :
