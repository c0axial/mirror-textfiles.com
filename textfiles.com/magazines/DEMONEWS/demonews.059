((Section 1...Standard Info))
==============================================================================
    DemoNews is a weekly publication dedicated to the demo scene.  It is
produced at the Internet FTP site ftp.eng.ufl.edu (aka WASP or HORNET).  
This newsletter focuses on all aspects of demos and demo-making  (including 
music, art, and coding).

There are currently three active demo-operators at this site:
     
     Dan Wright (Pallbearer) - dmw@eng.ufl.edu
     Christopher G. Mann (Snowman) - r3cgm@dax.cc.uakron.edu
     Mike - weis@elf.stuba.sk

    This site is mirrored by the following ftps:
         ftp.uwp.edu
         ftp.luth.se
         ftp.sun.ac.za
         ftp.uni-erlangen.de
         ftp.uni-paderborn.de

If you would like to receive a new copy of Demo News every Sunday in your
mailbox write to dmw@eng.ufl.edu.  We delete all bounced mail from this
service, so if you SHOULD BE getting Demo News and ARE NOT, please re-request
this newsletter.

SPACE

We hit our 400Meg limit this week--again.  Anyone got a spare GIG hard
drive (SCSI) or $700 they can donate for a worthy cause?  Till then I
will continue to bug the Sys Admins for more space...like asking them
to delete some of those 20Meg files in the /pub directory.  Chances
are it will not help but it is worth trying...till it backfires and
people start wondering why this stuff called "demos" is located here.

stop uploading them and just put them on the DEMO CD.

(GENERAL)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Hello everyone.  I start school this week, and I'll have time to spend
at the computer lab, so HORNET may go through some cool new changes.  I think
I'm going to experiment with ANSI in some of the directories.  We'll see how
this works out.  It will depend a lot on your response.  Also, the .message
files (that automatically display text when you enter a particular directory)
are going to be standardized, and the /programming directory should be
straightened up too.
        A lot of files were deleted this week because they did not have a
text description file.  In the future, I plan to delete all uploads that do
not have a .txt file with them.  Due to the traffic that goes through HORNET,
it is no longer feasible to search .zip files for these descriptions.  Sorry
for the inconvienience.
        A couple of you have written me in response to your files being
deleted.  Remember, I have no control over this.  If you will donate a hard
drive, we can allow files to remain online much longer.  Until then, your
uploads have about a month life expectency.

**Music Contest ][ ends on September 5th, so hurry up and get your entry in!**

==============================================================================
((Section 5...ESCAPE Demo/Music CD))
