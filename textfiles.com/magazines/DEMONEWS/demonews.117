=---------------------------------------------------[Introduction]--[Snowman]-=

 Hello all, and welcome to DemoNews issue 117.

 This is our final "catch up" issue of DemoNews.  While the server was down
 last week (after some hardware problems), we missed a week of DemoNews and
 the "Top Downloads."  The statistics you see above reflect last week's
 shortened totals.

 Here are a couple of quick things for you:

 Epeius has changed his handle to Ara.

 Darkness is getting ready for the new Imphobia diskmag.  Please write to
 jeff.van.audenhove@infoboard.be if you have any questions or submissions.

 A week or so ago there was a day called "Black Thursday."  It was so titled
 because the U.S. Government, in its infinite and divine wisdom, outlawed the
 ability for us to transmit "offensive or obscene materials" to each other.  I
 found a poem on the web the other day.  Even though you may have already seen
 it I found it inspiring enough to reprint here.

   First they came for the hackers.
   But I never did anything illegal with my computer,
     so I didn't speak up.

   Then they came for the pornographers.
   But I thought there was too much smut on the Internet anyway,
     so I didn't speak up.

   Then they came for the anonymous remailers.
   But a lot of nasty stuff gets sent from anon.penet.fi,
     so I didn't speak up.

   Then they came for the encryption users.
   But I could never figure out how to work PGP anyway,
     so I didn't speak up.

   Then they came for me.
   And by that time there was no one left to speak up.

   Unknown

 I personally thought the poem was fucking brilliant.

=---------------------------------------------[Review of Velvet Studio]--[GD]-=

 _____Introduction

 Velvet Studio is a new module tracker program from Extreme. Formerly known as
 "Extreme Tracker", this program adds degrees of professionalism to the domain
 of module tracking programs.

 This new tracker has the look and feel of some of the other popular trackers
 currently available, except that it combines some of their best features into
 one convenient package and allows for maximum configurability.

 Unlike other tracking programs available, this program comes as a crippled
 shareware release. Saving features are not available until one registers the
 program.

 _____Configuring

 In the "Configure Keys" menu, users can set up the menu keys to be similar to
 Scream Tracker 3, Fast Tracker 2, or use the default Velvet Studio key setup.
 The menu keys can also be configured any way the user decides. Gripes about
 new tracking programs from die-hard users often are about menu "hot-keys,"
 and how "it's not worth it to learn the new menu keys." This option solves
 such a problem for users intending to switch to this program.

 Configuration is split into several groups for layout, playback, sample
 editor options, disk options, and more. It would be nice to see an autosave
 feature for the configuration, as Fast Tracker has as a toggle option, and as
 Scream Tracker performs automatically.

 _____Features

 As Fast Tracker showed the music scene the importance of an on-board sample
 editor, the Velvet Studio coders took notice. The sampler inside Velvet
 Studio offers an array of effects, and the almost necessary "Undo" function
 which was missing from Fast Tracker's sampler.

 Several effects can be selected from an "Effects" menu, including reverb,
 flanging, sample reversing, and more.

 Bidirectional looping is also offered, as well as reverse looping. Reverse
 looping isn't necessary though, since the sample can be reversed easily.
 However, Velvet Studio uses loop-start and loop-end markers that surpass
 those in the Fast Tracker sample editor and make the task of looping much
 easier. It will also replay the loop using the new loop positions on the fly.

 This new tracker also makes use of multisample instruments as first seen in
 Fast Tracker 2 by Triton. The concept behind this is that certain samples
 have a "sweet spot", or a limited note range at which the sample will sound
 good. For example, playing a piano sample two octaves lower than it was
 sampled at can result in poor sound quality. Therefore, separate samples can
 be defined for certain note ranges, using a miniature piano keyboard to mark
 which sample within a 16-sample instrument covers which range of keys.

 _____Online Help

 Another similarity between Velvet Studio and Fast Tracker is the online help.
 It is set up in hypertext fashion, such that clicking on certain highlighted
 words or phrases will take the user to the section of the document covering
 that particular subject. The online help also has a string search feature,
 allowing the user to type in words or phrases to search the help text for,
 which is very useful in locating topics of interest quickly.

 Also, when in program configuration, a small window beneath the configuration
 menu explains the differences between different options. The window can be
 scrolled, allowing for plenty of information to be provided. This is an
 improvement of a Windows-style program with a status bar, as much more
 information can be provided.

 _____Summary

 Extreme's Velvet Studio is available at ftp.cdrom.com under the directory
 /demos/music/programs/trackers/ and the filename is vs???.zip where ??? will
 designate the current version.

=-----------------------------[Luminati's Tweaked Video Mode]--[Captain Hook]-=

 After my last article about Hooked Text Mode (Trixter's Note: This article
 will be published in the line of VGA Hardware Tricks series), I'll show you
 how Ambiance & Luminati by TRAN works.

 _____A Brief History

 Some time ago a little demo came to the scene based on Timeless.  Called
 Ambiance, it's another wonderful production from Tran.  Some weeks ago, the
 next episode of the timeless saga came out: Luminati, a beautiful demo with a
 "21-bit color" mode mixed by hardware aligned to soft music that provides a
 wonderful way to relax.  This mode is very "tweaked", but I'll explain all
 the steps in making it.  First off, however, I'd like to give thanks to a
 CSIPD dude who helped me to discover the format... Neal T. Tew.

 _____The Explanation

 Basically the mode consists of two different images, one on each page in
 normal unchained mode, merged by the video card hardware via rapid page
 flipping to create a "hicolor" image.

 Through rapid page flipping, the VGA Card joins colors automatically, so if
 you have a yellow color in pixel 0,0 of page 1 and a blue on the same pixel
 of page 2, the hardware "mixes" those colors and shows a green at 0,0.

 Because those two images are effectively displayed at same time, they must
 have the same palette.  To achieve that, we will divide the palette into two
 128 color blocks:  The first 128 block is for image A and the other block is
 for image B.  Normal VGA cards support only 64 levels of R,G, and B for each
 color; this gives us something like 262144 colors, but the screen allows only
 64000 different colors at a time.

 Here is an example video initialization routine:

 {--------------------------------}
 program FakeHico;
 uses crt;                {needed for keypressed}

 procedure waitvret;      {our friend}
 begin
  while ((Port[$3DA] AND 8) > 0) do;
  while ((Port[$3DA] AND 8) = 0) do;
 end;
 {--------------------------------}
 procedure starttwk;
   begin
      asm                  {Enables normal 320x200x256}
       mov ax,$13
       int $10
      end;
      port[$3c2]:=$c3;     {Enable odd/even mode & 480 lines}
      portw[$3c4]:=$0604;  {Set More than 64K & odd/even}
      portw[$3d4]:=$0811;  {Set Vertical Retrace End}
      portw[$3d4]:=$3606;  {Set Vertical Total}
      portw[$3d4]:=$1107;  {Set bit8 of line compare}
      portw[$3d4]:=$4009;  {Doubles ScanLine 400->200}
      portw[$3d4]:=$eB10;  {Set Vertical Retrace Start}
      portw[$3d4]:=$c712;  {Set Vertical Display End}
      portw[$3d4]:=$0014;  {Set Single Word Addressing}
      portw[$3d4]:=$eA15;  {Set Start Vertical Blank}
      portw[$3d4]:=$1816;  {Set End of Vertical Blank}
      portw[$3d4]:=$e317;  {Set Rotation Word}
   end;
 {--------------------------------}

 Cool, eh?  Those register values were captured from Luminati by a small 15
 minute TP program hooked in INT 10h & INT 1Ch.  When Luminati enters VGA Mode
 via INT 10h, my program moves itself to INT 1Ch and waits a bit to allow
 Luminati to set up all the registers; and before Luminati enters into PMODE
 my TSR grabs those registers and send them to my printer via INT 05h.  It was
 quite simple; now just compare those to same registers in the now tweaked
 mode and register the differences. ;-)

 Now that we've set up the video mode, we need to load some images to each
 plane.  Let me show you how.

 {--------------------------------}
 procedure loadraw(rawfile:string;page:byte);
 var f:file;
     n:word;
     c:byte;
     rgb:array[0..255] of record r,g,b:byte;end;
 begin
  assign(f,rawfile);                      {Open a rawfile 320x200}
  reset(f,1);
  blockread(f,rgb[0],768);                {Reads Palette from file}
  for n:=0 to 255 do
   begin
    port[968]:=n;                         {Stores palette in DAC}
    port[969]:=rgb[n].r;
    port[969]:=rgb[n].g;
    port[969]:=rgb[n].b;
   end;
  for n:=0 to 63999 do                    {320*200}
   begin
    blockread(f,c,1);                     {Loads a pixel from raw}
    portw[$3c4]:=2+($0100 shl (n mod 4)); {Set Page to write to}
    mem[$A000:(page*16000)+n div 4]:=c;   {Put pixel in Unchained page}
   end;
  close(f);                               {Close file}
 end;
 {--------------------------------}

  Done! All we need to do now is show those two pictures together, right?
  So let's do it! :-)

 {--------------------------------}
 procedure hardflip;
 begin
  repeat
   waitvret;                              {our friend Vertical Retrace}
   portw[$3d4]:=$c;
   portw[$3d4]:=$d;                       {set display start addr for img1}
   waitvret;
   portw[$3d4]:=word(16000 and $ff00+$c);
   portw[$3d4]:=word(16000 shl 8+$d);     {set display start addr for img2}
  until keypressed;
 end;
 {--------------------------------}
 begin
  starttwk;
  loadraw('c:\thi\imagem1.raw',0);
  loadraw('c:\thi\imagem2.raw',1);
  hardflip;
  asm
   mov ax,3
   int $10
  end;
 end.
 {--------------------------------}

 And you're done!  We have two pictures merged in the screen; now doing the
 effects is your own business :)

 Most of the page select code was made by Neal T. Tew, the rest was made by
 myself.

=-------------------------------------------[Things to Know about NAID]--[GD]-=

 _____Introduction

 Last year around this time, I constructed a checklist for those planning to
 go to NAID. This list included several things which one might need for the
 trip.

 Once again, we are nearing that time when we will embark on our journeys of
 varying length and direction to get us to NAID 1996. Therefore, I think it is
 crucial that you know the following information before planning your trip.

 _____Weather

 Being moved from mid-April to late-May, NAID will hopefully have a different
 climate this time around.  Instead of the snow we were met with last year, we
 can hope to be rewarded this time around with shorts and t-shirt weather.

 However, a computer's processor actually works better when it is colder, so
 expect your demo to run slowly on the competition machine this year. I heard
 the organizers tried putting the CPU into a tank of ice cold water, but the
 test results came back negative.

 _____Driving

 If you are driving, you will need to exercise extreme caution on the streets
 of Montreal and surrounding areas. This is because Canadian drivers do not
 act the way you expect them to.

 When driving on a busy street, you must be careful that others do not cut you
 off. To be sure of this, locate a vehicle with Canadian license plates and
 tailgate them for as long as they continue going in your direction.

 This will also prevent the oncoming traffic from seeing your license plate
 and labeling you as a "tourist" complete with complimentary hand gestures.

 _____Bathrooms

 Last year, the small number of females associated with the demo scene were
 incorrectly overlooked. Due to this, the bathrooms were not adequately
 labeled. As a result, some females at the party place were accidentally using
 the men's bathroom (that is until one male came out of the showers and was
 discovered by a female.)

 In other words, guys, if you want to show off your stuff, this time you'll
 have to use the women's bathroom.

 _____Sleeping

 In the Hornet NAID report, we all saw a photo of a guy and a girl together in
 the same sleeping bag. Now, I am going to assume that their intentions were
 strictly to conserve space while packing their belongings.

 May I recommend an alternative for couples who intend to share sleeping bags
 at NAID to take turns sleeping. This will leave more space in the sleeping
 rooms for others, as well. It will also mean that your sleeping bag gets not
 8, but 16 hours of use in one day!  That effectively doubles its usefulness.

 _____Eating

 With all the activity at NAID, it can be at times difficult to set aside some
 time to grab a bite to eat. There are people you want to go chat with, take
 pictures of, and perhaps work together with on a competition entry.

 Since you never know when you might get a free moment to hit the snack bar, I
 suggest you always keep a napkin tucked into your waist. Messy eaters may
 also want to wear a bib under their chins. You will be ready to eat at a
 moment's notice, and your clothes won't get stained.

 _____Conclusion

 If you are able to follow these simple suggestions, you should enjoy NAID
 thoroughly.  The first step to having a good time is effective planning. If
 you do follow these guidelines, please remember that I am not responsible for
 any odd stares, point-and-giggle, or blushed-face effects which you may
 experience.
