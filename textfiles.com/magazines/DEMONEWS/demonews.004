INCOMING
========
-Vega by Ultraforce is an old ultraforce demo with SB digitized sound.
-SpaceFun 1 & 2 (Reblefun) are also by the old Ultraforce.  SB needed to
 play! Has digitized sound and horrible music. (If they are not up then
 they will be up real soon.)
-Lamer Demo --Demo by DEC (I believe).  Suports many sound boards and has
 VGA graphics.  (Use 386 25MHz if possible.)
-I am still waiting on that Twilight Zone RNS demo
-We have the OVERLOAD music working but unfortunately only as a mod.
 If I get it to work with the demo I shall re-up the whole working demo.

OLD INCOMING
============

-Putrefac(tion) by SKULL has some great music.  Made in 1991
-CDA-Xmas demo.  Basically a demo that plays music--8 tunes.
-Chaos3D.  For some reason this "newer" version will not play any sound on
 my computer.  I will try to speak to the person who wrote it and get a 
 working copy.
-Realthng by The Phone Coders.  Released Sept 30, 1992.  ROLAND sound only!

======================
WHAT ABOUT OTHER DEMOS
======================

Mega thanks too all those people who have recently uploaded demos on the 
want list.  If you have any of the files below(or others) perhaps you could 
donate them to the pub/incoming/demos DIRECTORY.

ULTRAFORCE :  Mach 3, Space Demo, Sphinx Demo
RENAISSANCE:  K2 Demos (Not sure if this is out yet)

Others:  RSI-DEMO, Odyssey Demo, CD Fish, and a working copy of Vectrat.

===========
COMPRESSION
===========

Are you wondering why there are the same files in the UPLOAD directory and
demo directory?  Well, if there is it is because I am in the process of re-
compressing all the files.  They will all use the LHA compression program
(version 2.13) which is also on this site.  I am also (on most demos)
placing a ANSI text file to spread the word about this site.  Why LHA?
a) It is FREE--not shareware, not copyrighted.
b) It is almost as fast as ZIP--within 15 seconds for a 1.8meg compressed file
c) It compacts as well as the best.  PKZIP 1.93a and LHA 2.13 come reasonably 
   close.  There was a split on the two files I compacted--both over 500K.
d) Not everyone has PKZIP1.93a (or Ver 2.0) plus it is an alpha version.

=========
TOO SLOW!
=========

Just type "hash" and see what you are getting.  I have gotten over
5Kbytes/s when uploading!  If you still feel the site is too slow then 
help find a place to mirror it!

===========
MIRROR SITE
===========

There are no mirror sites yet but...  Here are some sites I think would be
nice:  ftp.cis.ksu.edu (7.5Kb/s), archive.umich.edu (8.2Kb/s), 128.36.21.1
(12.7Kb/s), ftp.ulowell.edu (12.? Kb/s).  Of course only ONE is necessary 
for the USofA.  What about Europeans transferring at .5k and below?  
Well, if you want to solve a problem then do something about it!  
If you want to transfer faster (and I know everyone does) then find a site 
that will want to mirror this place, tell me, and we will arrange things.


=======
WRAP UP 
=======

-Be sure to get out and VOTE--may the worst man not win!
-If something is not updated recently (i.e. ABOUT.DEMOS) it is because I
 have been busy.  I will get to it when possible.
-I plan on writing a REQUIREMENTS file so people have an idea whether a demo 
 will work with their computer before downloading it.
-I like organization so that is why I am making all the files a single format.
 Not to forget it will save space and make things easier on downloaders.
-The ABOUT.DEMOS file gives a general description of the demo.  I updated
 it when possible.  Just do a "ls -ld" to see the date the file was updated.
-Remember to type "get DEMO.NEWS_? -" if you want to read these text files
 while on line.  Only and idiot would do that with something like UNREAL--
 please don't try to read a binary (.zip,.exe,.lzh,.arj) file while online!
-For those who can't wait to get a new demo remember you can always go into
 the pub/incoming/demos directory for the newest arrivals.  However, be 
 forewarned that if there is a problem with a demo there (i.e. virus,
 trojan) I will not be held responsible.
