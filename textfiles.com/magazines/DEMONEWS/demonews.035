MAILING LIST
------------

If you are not recieving this newsletter via E-mail and would like to
just mail us a message at dmw@eng.ufl.edu asking to be added to the
"demonews" mailing list.  This is not done automatically so you do not
need to type anything specific.  We can also send you the "TOP25DL" which
is in the /news directory and compiles the top 25 downloaded files every
week automatically.  

FOR those wondering "Hey, I subscribed but I did not receive anything
via mail yet." consider the following:  a) This weekend the mail decided
it would take a DAY longer to be sent--i.e. the post office does dont
deliver mail on the weekends (seems to be the same policy here), b) for
those of you who know UNIX we use the "at" command and I update the same
file that is atted--I suspected "at" spooled the file but did not
know until I just proved it TODAY.  Thus, either we have to start doing
a double "at" or just split our program in half.  If you have no idea 
what I am talking about don't worry cause someone has it under control.

The only mail to BOUNCE this week was to--Toby (again).  If Toby wants
it fixed he has to notify me asap.

DEMOS.TXT
---------

This file is in the /alpha directory has been recently updated.  This week
demos k-n were updated fully.  By the end of the month everything should
be back to where it was a year ago--100% updated.  Of course this does not
include the programming directory.

Demos & Money
--------------

Future Crew has gotten a few bucks, Ultraforce has, as well as a few
other PC demo groups.  Well, maybe this is your chance--if you like
Creative (SB company).  I saw this tidbit posted on c.s.i.p.d and it
was not sent directly to me.

Newsgroups: comp.sys.ibm.pc.demos
From: jpynchon@netcom.com (Jonathan Pynchon)
Subject: Request for bids
Summary: Creative Tech needs a demo
Keywords: demo 3-d money
Date: Fri, 11 Mar 1994 19:39:02 GMT

    Creative Technology Ltd. is requesting bids for demo/training
    software for a new wireless 3D input device product line.  This
    software should demonstrate the unique capabilities of the device
    for navigation and control of X,Y, and Z axes, as well as rotational
    input, in true 3 dimensional movement rather than implied movement
    as with traditional joysticks.  The hardware connects via a standard
    serial port.

    The program must create excitement about the product, it should
    feature fast 3D graphics and high quality sound effects and music.
    The software may also introduce new ideas for the use of the
    vertical axis and the 3D cube such as layering, where each layer or
    zone in the 3D space has a unique meaning to the application.
 
    This program will be used for trade show and other demos and will
    be bundled with our product as an introduction and 3D tutorial for
    the customer.  As such we feel it will provide an excellent
    opportunity for the software developer to promote itself to a wide
    audience.  Future 3D software development projects are also planned
    for this product line.  Please send questions, comments, sample demo
    programs and/or a proposal or contact information to
    jpynchon@netcom.com.
 
    Creative Technology Ltd. designs, manufactures, and markets the line
    of Sound Blaster audio cards for the PC, as well as Multimedia
    Upgrade Kit bundles and video capture boards such as the Video
    Blaster.

FINALLY

ONCE AGAIN:

If you have anything demo related you want to say you can say it here too.
Just mail me what you want to say by Friday and I will include it in the
newsletter that weekend.
