=========                            
SITE DOWN
=========

DEMO SITE II (sioux.ee.ufl.edu) is no longer a demo site.  In fact
you will find nothing useful there.  It is a long and sad story and I
am sorry that the demise is partially my fault.

=========
NEW DEMOS
=========

I plan on uploading any demos I have (on my ABOUT.DEMOS list) that are not
currently on this site.  Bartsblnd is one of them.
Twilight Zone plans on releasing their newest demo soon.  I do not know what
it is called but look for it here!  I will try to get it, and include their
TZ-scope (sound blaster sound analyzer) in the compacted file.

======================
WHAT ABOUT OTHER DEMOS
======================

There are still a bunch of demos out there that this site does not have.  If
you have any of the below (or others) perhaps you could donate them to the
pub/incoming/demos DIRECTORY.

ULTRAFORCE :  Vega, Rebelful, Mach 3, Space Demo, Space Fun, Sphinx Demo
SKULL      :  Putre Faction
CRONOLOGIA :  X-mas '91
RENAISSANCE:  K2 Demos (Not sure if this is out yet)
SPACE PIGS :  Megademo

Others:  RSI-DEMO, Odyssey Demo, CD Fish, a working copy of Vectrat, and
         a copy of OVERLOAD where the sound works on the SB pro properly.

=======
WRAP UP 
=======

Be sure to read this DEMO.NEWS_? everytime the number changes to see what is
happening.  Just type  get DEMO.NEWS_4 -  (The hash - will allow you to read
the file while on line).
