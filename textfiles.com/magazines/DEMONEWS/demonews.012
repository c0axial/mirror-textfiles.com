NEWSGROUP 
=========

It sounds like a few people are going to attempt to get a DEMOS newsgroup
on the USENET (newsreader) system.  Go to the .soundcards GROUP to find out
more.  I'll keep you posted on the details when more info arrives.

NOT DEMOS BUT...
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

If any of you are interesting in collecting/seeing "Underground Zines" now
is a great time.  I recently sent a $2.90 SASE (10x13) envelope to:
FactSheet Five, 1800 Market Street, San Francisco, CA 94102
and recieved TWO pounds worth of cool zines.  As a former zine publisher
and reader I suggest EVERYONE do this.  You will get about $30 dollars
worth of material, which is practically impossible to get, for only a
SASE.  It will probably be the BEST three bucks you spend in your life!
It will open up a whole new world of literature.  "Of the people, by the
people, for the people."  Unsensored, uncut, and in your face.  For more
information simply visit the alt.zines newsgroup on the newsreader.

==========
STATS BACK
==========

--Hamell created a program to take the WASP ftp.syslog and make a TOP
  25 DEMOS downloaded file called TOP_25_DL.  This will be updated WEEKLY
  when the ftp.syslog is completed early Saturday.  This way you can see
  what demo is being downloaded the most.

=======
CHANGES
=======

--As you may have noticed the "source.code" directory has been renamed to
  "source" because of a suggestion a user made.

--Some proposed changes include 2 possibilities:
  1)  Moving the TEXT files to a subdirectory.
  2)  Create subdirectories for each demo group.

  If you have any comments or suggestions on the above changes let me know.

================
CLOSING COMMENTS
================

--On a quest to be the best through excellence--demo site motto.

--Zax (of The Phoney Coders) plans on putting together a list of 
  coders and demo groups you can reach via "netmail."

--If anyone wants to help review, contribute, or have any good ideas
  for this demo site let me know.

--In my never ending confusion I am trying to get into a groove of 
  updating this INFORMATION every friday/saturday.  This means most
  of the text files shall be updated, files moved, and a DEMO news
  written.

--It is always funny how the best laid plans fade to naught when 
  complications arise.  The previous statement seems to be a good example.
