=---------------------------------------------------[Introduction]--[Snowman]-=

 Hello all, and welcome to DemoNews issue 102!

 The Party 1995 invitation was officially released today.  It is a 5k zip
 file with nothing but ASCII text.  When I first saw this, my reaction was
 "Ack! 5k zip file = corrupted upload because the TP95 invitation intro
 _has_ to be bigger than that".  I guess it doesn't.  Hopefully we'll see
 something more substantial from TP organizers soon.

 If you haven't already heard by now, our site is moving from a .txt based
 site to a 00index.txt one.  This means that all of the files we have on our
 site that were not reviewed in DemoNews are being reviewed now.  As a
 result, the "Uploads" section of this newsletter may occasionally be
 sprinkled with older files that are now just being cataloged.  Our goal is
 to have the entire site organized by this coming X-mas.

 Imphobia 11 is just around the corner and voting is needed for the "Charts"
 section of the diskmag.  I highly encourage all of you to take a few
 minutes and complete the form included in this issue of DemoNews.  The
 accuracy of the charts depends on it.

 The "Hornet NAID Report" is nearly complete and should be released in the
 next couple of weeks.  The holdup?  Its me!  :)  Trixter asked me to do all
 of the descriptions on the images we have, and I still have many more left
 to do.  Luckily we are using a .jpg compression scheme for the report so
 the entire thing should be under 1.5 megs.

 Last but not least, I would like to mention Denthor's GFX Coding Tutorials.
 Some of you may be aware that I have converted a fair number of them (the
 first 10) from pascal to C++.  Many of you have written to ask me when I
 intend to convert the rest.  Well, recently a USA-based group contacted me
 with an _incredible_ idea.  I can't say anything about it yet, but I will
 be converting the rest of the tutorials shortly (even though you won't see
 them for at least 1.5 months).

 Thats it for now... just check out the files, read the articles, and have a
 good time.  That's why we're here anyway.

=----------------------------------------------------[Demos on the Web]--[GD]-=

 _____Introduction

 Hello, this is the first column in a hopefully weekly series. Each week, I
 will check out some web pages dealing with demos, give the URL, and a brief
 description of what you find once you connect.

 A lot of web pages use enhanced Netscape graphic features, so I recommend
 that you use Netscape if you have a SLIP, PPP, or ethernet connection. You
 can find Netscape on FTP at: ftp.netscape.com /netscape - this server has
 clients for Unix, Mac, and Windows.

 This week, we'll take a tour through the Kite page, and the Legend Design
 page.

 _____http://kite.ithaca.ny.us/kite/

 This KITE page has a link to a demo section. In fact, the link should be
 labeled INTROS, because the focus is on 4k and 64k intros.

 Each of the three sections under the intros section contains screen shots and
 file links to the intros featured. "Transferring the pictures takes up more
 file space than the whole demo, so why not just get the demo" the text reminds
 its users. Marveling at the technical ability of their programmers, the page
 maintainer is sure to point out what makes these intros special.

 On the ASM95 intro screen-shot page, users can see shots of the blurred donut
 from "Ahrum," the magical butterflies of the 4k winner, "Animate," the
 "Fraction" shadebob section, another one of those donuts in "Heaven," a
 wiggly donut from the "Loop01" intro, and part of the TV scene from "Ukko,"
 the Stickman intro.

 Viewing a shot from an intro as a freeze-frame picture, instead of the
 intended method of viewing, gives an intro a new perspective. Instead of a
 four minute flashes-by-your-face presentation, these images are permanently
 captured. This page makes full use of the well-worn phrase, "A picture is
 worth a thousand words."

 The maintainer of this page is Joe Hess, and he can receive email at
 jeh22@cornell.edu .

 _____http://www.nacamar.net:8080/groups/LD/

 This page is about the PC demo group from Germany that call themselves
 "Legend Design." It features group info, contact info, releases, and future
 plans for the group.

 Also within the links are pages of ASM94 pictures and The Party 94 pictures,
 with a focus on German scene members. If you didn't get enough when you saw
 the party reports, be sure to take a peek at these pictures!

 Unfortunately, the "Legend Design News" section included a sub-heading that
 reads "Last updated June 22 1995," so it may be outdated.

 This page also has a tremendous amount of links, ranging from PC demo groups,
 Demo pages, FTP sites, and newsgroups. The demoscene favorite of newsgroups,
 comp.sys.ibm.pc.demos, is among the newsgroups of which a user of this page
 can access.

 The maintainer of this page is Pit Bull of Legend Design, and he can be
 reached via email at pitbull@nacamar.de .

 _____Conclusion

 That's all for this week, but be sure to read this column each time it
 appears for more interesting demo sites on the web! I'm not sure what will
 be featured in the next column; it depends on what I can connect to.

=------------------------------------[69 Effects Based on a Torus]--[Phoenix]-=

 The torus has become a popular symbol for PC demos.  What group hasn't
 shaded a donut and thrown it in their demo for fun?  Your group would
 probably like to show some more toruses (tori?) in your next demo,
 but why do the same old thing? Try something different instead! Here
 is a list of some effects you could do with a torus.  I planned to think
 of 101 of them, but ran out of ideas so I felt 69 would be as good a
 magic number. :)

 ^ 1.^Wireframe torus
 ^ 2.^Gouraud-shaded torus

 ^ 8.^Dot torus
 ^ 9.^Plasma-filled torus
 ^10.^Half a torus
 ^11.^MPEG video of a torus
 ^12.^Inside of a torus
 ^13.^Metal-shaded torus

 ^66.^Two toruses molded into a figure 8
 ^67.^Larusse-mapped torus
 ^68.^1996 Olympics five-torus logo
 ^69.^Torus-circle of torusues

 If it is originality you are striving for, be careful, many of these have
 already been done.

 Three cheers for the torus!

=--------------------------------[ftp.cdrom.com Through the Mail?]--[Snowman]-=

 _____Introduction

 [Aquafresh writes...]

 I`ve been checking out your FTP demo site lately and I think its really
 quite c00l!  However, its extremely slow to ftp warez off your site down to
 my HD here in England.. =(

 So, is there anyway of FTPing via email so that it gets stored under my
 mail on the mail-server at Demon, and is then sent to me from London to my
 house, rather than from the otherside of the world.. If its possible to FTP
 via email, please tell me how to do it!
        
 [He's in luck]

 For all of you out there who find ftp.cdrom.com to be sluggish, we have an
 alternative!  Its called FTP-by-email.  Thanks to Trixter for finding this
 FAQ.  I hope that some of you out there find it useful.

 _____How to FTP-by-email

 It is possible to use FTP even if you don't have access to it directly.
 There are many sites that have e-mail to FTP servers that will FTP the
 files for you, encode them (if they're binary) and mail you the results.

 FTP via EMail sites:

   ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com
   ftpmail@cs.uow.edu.au          (Australia)
   ftpmail@ftp.uni-stuttgart.de   (Germany)
   ftpmail@grasp.insa-lyon.fr     (France)
   ftpmail@doc.ic.ac.uk           (Great Britain)
   ftpmail@ieunet.ie              (Ireland)
   ftpmail@lth.se                 (Sweden)
   ftpmail@sunsite.unc.edu        (USA)

 Mail a letter to any of the above sites with the word 'help' on one line in
 the body of your message.   If you don't want to wait forever don't use the
 sites that deal with decwrl.dec.com as that machine is overloaded with
 ftpmail requests.   Please use the machine that is closest to your site.

 Alternative method using BITNET machines:

   bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu      (USA)
   bitftp@plearn.edu.pl           (Europe)
   bitftp@vm.gmd.de               (Europe)

 Send any of these three mail with the word "help" to get a help file for
 the service or the word "ftplist" to get a list of anonymous FTP sites.

 Please choose one of the two types of services above and retrieve a help
 file from one of the sites before you try to FTP any files. Make sure you
 read the entire help file before proceeding.

 _____Help and Examples of ftpmail and bitftp

 Requests for the ftpmail servers are of the form:

   open <site>
   cd <directory>
   dir                            # To obtain a directory listing
   get <file>                     # To retrieve a file
   quit

 Example:
   open ftp.hmc.edu
   cd pub/drugs/psychedelics/LSD
   get FAQ-LSD.Z
   quit

 Requests for the bitftp servers are of the form:

   FTP <site> UUENCODE
   USER anonymous
   cd <directory>
   get <filename>
   QUIT

 Example:

   FTP ftp.hmc.edu UUENCODE
   USER anonymous
   cd pub/drugs/psychedelics/lsd
   get FAQ-LSD.Z
   QUIT

 With either type of service they will UUENCODE any binary files before they
 can send them.  You will need to do the UUdecoding yourself.  UUDECODErs
 are available freely at almost every BBS.   You obviously wont have much
 use for a UUdecoder that is mailed to you UUencoded as you won't be able to
 decode it.

 You of course need access to uncompress or a compatible program to take
 care of files with the .Z (or .gz) extension.

 If you are on an ms-dos based machine get the file:

 comp430d.zip from oak.oakland.edu in the pub/msdos/compress directory.

 It contains a unix compatible compress/uncompress/zcat program for dos
 based machines.  Instructions for it's use are included.

 If you are using any other type of machine (MacIntosh, etc..) you'll need
 to find a Unix compatible "uncompress" utility that runs on your machine to
 uncompress any files with the .Z  or .gz  extension.

 NOTE: Please make sure your system admin has approved the the use of a mail
       server, as files can take system resources of not only your site, but
       several sites up the stream. And please abide by the guidelines that
       the ftpmail server administrators have put in their help files. Most
       ftpmail servers default to their own site for files, so try
       retrieving things from that site first. In general, most files you
       need are already available there, so it is a waste to connect to
       another machine.

 _____Conclusion

 Hopefully a few of you out there will be brave enough to try this out.  We
 now have a file called ALLFILES.TXT (and ALLFILES.ZIP) posted on our site.
 It contains a list of all cataloged files we have.  This file resides under
 /pub/demos in case you want to ftpmail it.  :)

 If you do try this out, please mail us and let it know you like it.

=---------------------------[ST3 Technical Tracking Tips]--[Liam the Lemming]-=

 _____Preface

 I can't believe I'm doing this. I can't believe I let Snowman talk me into
 it. (Yeah, like he had to try so hard... :) ) Ho well, it's done now, I'm
 doing my first ever article for... sorry, my _second_ article for DemoNews.
 Why? Cos I want people to stand up and take notice of me. I'm in three
 groups and I'm still a virtual unknown, it's scary. :)

 One slight problem. What the heck am I gonna talk about?!

 Sod it. Nothing specific springs to mind, so I'll have a look through past
 issues of DemoNews for inspir... oh crap. This is my sister's PC (a crap
 386SX, urgh). Don't gotz no DNs here! Just a few TraxWeekly's on a floppy.

 What the hell. I'll probably get into trouble for taking inspiration for a
 DemoNews article from TraxWeekly articles, but I seem to have run out of
 options... :)

 Right then. What have we here? "Tracking tips"... hmm, well I can do a bit
 on technical hints and tips (for all you users of ST3, anyway). "Ripping" -
 yep, I could do a bit on that too... only about samples though...

 Well, I'd better get started. This article ain't gonna write itself...

 _____Introduction

 Necros more or less covered everything you need to know about the musical
 side of tracking. I've never had any music theory at all, so I'm hardly the
 one to offer advice on that topic.

 Apart from which, his advice has frequently helped me with my work.
 (Although I figured out stuff like tweaking the volume on successive notes
 to give a more realistic "velocity-sensitive" feel, the "swing-beat" trick,
 and cool chord structures, all by myself before I saw his "tracking tips"
 articles.)

 So what does that leave me? Sod all. Bah... :)

 _____The Null Instrument

 There are a few little tricks, though - technical ones, but still pretty
 neat - which I use regularly. For example, the "null instrument" trick.

 This means, simply, that for the first few notes of a track (say, for an
 echo of the lead melody), you enter the notes as normal... and then go back
 over them and _delete_ the instrument fields.

 I've done this in one of my latest releases - a reworking of my Asm95
 entry, soon to be released through Bass Productions (on the Caution
 musicdisk) and moz[IC]art (on the more simply titled "moz-pack 6")... look
 at the echo of the lead string when you get it. No instrument field.

 But enough self-publicity. :) What this method does is this. The first time
 the pattern is played, the "null" notes are ignored, since the channel it's
 in is clear, ie no instrument has been played in that channel, so there's
 no sample to play the note with.

 The next time round, however, the lead sample has been echoed just as the
 in the channel containing the lead melody, so the "null" notes can now be
 assigned that sample, and the echo is filled in nicely. This is handy for
 saving a little space - where you might have used two patterns, now you
 need only use one.

 In fact, I'll try to illustrate using diagrams, like all the experts seem
 to do. (Even though I'm no expert, but hey, I can still pretend. :) )

 Say you have three channels of echo, each of them three lines below the
 previous one. Like so:

             | G 4 13 .. H00 | ... .. .. ... | ... .. .. ... |
             | ... .. 16 H00 | ... .. .. ... | ... .. .. ... |
             | F 4 13 .. H00 | ... .. .. ... | ... .. .. ... |
             | C 4 13 32 H00 | G 4 13 32 H00 | ... .. .. ... |
             | E 4 13 .. H00 | ... .. 08 H00 | ... .. .. ... |
             | ... .. .. H00 | F 4 13 32 H00 | ... .. .. ... |
             | G 4 13 .. H00 | C 4 13 16 H00 | G 4 13 22 H00 |
             | ... .. 16 H00 | E 4 13 32 H00 | ... .. 06 H00 |

 And at the end of the channel, we'll have a progression, say, D, -, C, D,
 E, F, -, D (where "-" is a empty note ie "... .. .. ..."). You want that at
 the top of the channel so the echo follows the lead... but you can't just
 put it in, cos it'll play that echo bit the first time the pattern plays.
 Well, here's how to get round it. And it's really simple:

             | G 4 13 .. H00 | F 4 .. 32 H00 | C 4 .. 22 H00 |
             | ... .. 16 H00 | ... .. .. H00 | D 4 .. 22 H00 |
             | F 4 13 .. H00 | D 4 .. 32 H00 | E 4 .. 22 H00 |
             | C 4 13 32 H00 | G 4 13 32 H00 | F 4 .. 22 H00 |
             | E 4 13 .. H00 | ... .. 08 H00 | ... .. .. H00 |
             | ... .. .. H00 | F 4 13 32 H00 | D 4 .. 22 H00 |
             | G 4 13 .. H00 | C 4 13 16 H00 | G 4 13 22 H00 |
             | ... .. 16 H00 | E 4 13 32 H00 | ... .. 06 H00 |

 As you can see, the instrument field (normally playing instrument 13 in
 this example) is blank. So if there's no instrument assigned to that row,
 the note won't play. Hey presto, no echo until the second time round, by
 which time the channel has been assigned instrument 13 and the note plays.

 But what if it's part of, say, a chorus or some such specific structure?
 You want it "nulled" again, of course. Well, that's easy - a simple ^^
 command (note off) to "empty" the channel. Right?

 Wrong. Most s3m players do this the wrong way - wiping the note rather than
 the instrument. My player of choice, MIDAS module player, makes this
 mistake. Perfect in every other way, but it gets that _one_ thing wrong.
 How annoying.

 _____The Invisible Sample

 So what to do? Cue my other Neat Little Trick - the "invisible sample".

 Honest to god, I'm being serious here. You can actually have what I call
 "invisible samples". Simply press F3 to go to the instrument screen and
 move the cursor into the field which, for every sample you load in,
 displays the letters SMP, meaning SaMPle (except for Adlib samples, but
 I've only ever seen Falcon use those).

 Now press S. The little instrument window with the stats appears to the
 right as if there were a sample there... but if you notice those stats, the
 sample has no waveform... and no length. So you're not using up the space
 you saved by using one pattern instead of two. Just use that sample
 (unsample? :) ) instead of the note-off, and it's sorted.

 But won't the player crash or something when it finds a note of zero
 length? Well, it doesn't bother MIDAS, and ST3 dealt with it without any
 hassle, so I can't really see how it would crash your player, whichever you
 use. And it changes the sample (rather than shutting the note off) to play
 this invisible one for each note. No sample, therefore no note, therefore
 no sound. Simple.

 Ish. ;) (I must try that out on Iplay or Cubic or whichever. I wish someone
 would release a really good player for the AWE. :[ )

 _____Conclusion

 Well, that's all for now. I think the article's long enough without me
 yapping about when it's okay to rip and when it isn't, and so on.

=------------------------------------------[Faces in the Crowd]--[Kal Zakath]-=

 _____Introduction

 Hello, Kal Zakath here...  Some of you may have read my column in
 TraxWeekly #26 introducing my new weekly article - "Faces In The Crowd", a
 column dedicated to raising the scene's awareness of aspiring composers in
 the scene.  Snowman asked me to write a little something about it for
 Hornet DemoNews, so here it is...  Read on for more info about "Faces In
 The Crowd".

 First of all, let me (briefly) introduce myself, as I'm sure very few
 of you have any idea of who I am. :>  My real name is John Townsend, and I
 go by the handle of Kal Zakath.  I'm 17 years old and have been following
 the demo and music scenes for about 3 years now (starting with when I first
 saw Unreal shortly after it was released at ASM'92), but I've only been
 IRCing since about May, so I'm sort of a newbie to that part of the scene.

 Also I've been tracking music since March, so I'm also an amateur composer.
 I finished 14th in MC3 Rookie with my first "real" tune, and two of my
 newer works, uwdreams.xm and kz-eop.xm are available on the Hornet archive.
 That's all there really is to say about me.  I'm just a long time demo
 "fan" who has just recently decided to get active and actually do something
 in the scene. :>

 But enough about me, that's not the point of this article. :>  I'm here to
 talk about "Faces In The Crowd".

 _____The Problem

 Basically, the motivation behind FITC is that, in today's growing music
 scene, it is very difficult for an aspiring musician to get any sort of
 recognition.  There are so many tunes uploaded to Hornet each week (and
 unfortunately there are many tunes of a low quality) that most people just
 can't be bothered to download the latest S3M by -NoBoDY- of NaMeLeSS MuZiK.
 They've never heard of this person, never heard any of his tunes, so they
 ignore it and download the latest Five Musicians or KFMF release instead.

 Mind you, there's nothing wrong with this at all.  People want to KNOW that
 what they're FTPing is going to be a quality production.  But I've sure you
 can see the inevitable cycle if this keeps up.  People don't know who a
 certain composer is, so they don't know if he's any good or not.  They
 don't know if he's any good or not, so they don't get his tunes.  Nobody
 ever hears his music, so nobody ever really finds out who the hell he is.

 Then the cycle starts over.  The point of course is that it's possible for
 a person to release god-knows-how-many tunes and never get a shred of
 respect or recognition.  You might think, "That's not true.  If somebody's
 good enough, SOMEONE will find out and spread the word."

 Perhaps.  But, it doesn't really work like that.  It's pretty damn unlikely
 that someone will come in and take the scene by storm with a first release
 that's on par with an FM release.  It just doesn't happen.  What DOES
 happen is that somebody works hard tracking music for a few months. Then he
 releases a tune.  Let's say it's not bad and gets ***+ from Hornet.

 He's happy, so he keeps on tracking, improving his skills, and releases
 another tune and gets ***.  He's a bit disappointed but not seriously.
 Meanwhile, he's been trying to get people to listen to his works and give
 him feedback and gotten a total of like 3 replies per tune.

 He can't get in a demo group because he has NO reputation, and there are
 dozens of other musicians just like him out there.  So he starts to get
 discouraged and wonders if being in the scene is really worth it.  He
 decides that of course it is.

 He tracks because he enjoys it, and he decides that he'll keep on tracking,
 hoping someday he'll get lucky and break through to become a true member of
 the scene, and get at least a moderate amount of recognition. (BTW - This
 is speaking from my personal experience. :>)

 _____The Solution

 I started "Faces In The Crowd" because I believe that aspiring musicians
 should have a chance to have their music heard.  They shouldn't have to
 wait for a lucky break, they shouldn't have to be the next Necros just to
 be noticed, and they shouldn't have to have a famous group affiliation.

 All musicians who are determined to deliver quality to the scene should
 have the chance to be heard and judged on their merits.  Each week in
 TraxWeekly, I will interview an aspiring scene musician who is making an
 effort to write quality music and is looking for more people to find out
 about his compositions.

 In the interview, I'll discuss with the composer their music, their
 background in the scene, their influence, their views of what it's like to
 be a "newbie" in the constantly growing PC music scene, and more. I'll also
 include a short article profiling the composer and any demo/music groups he
 might be in, a release listing of the person's tunes, and an e-mail address
 so people can contact him and give feedback and constructive criticism.

 Hopefully, FITC will be able to raise the scene's awareness to include some
 of the newbies who have yet to make it big, but are certainly capable of
 doing so in the future.

 _____How Can I be a Face?

 You might be wondering how you (or someone you know) can go about being
 featured in "Faces In The Crowd".  Really, there are two ways.

 1) If I have heard your music, and I don't feel that you are getting the
    recognition you deserve in the scene, I may ask you if you'd like an
    FITC interview.  Of course, if this happens, you are free to accept or
    reject my offer. :>

 2) If I don't contact you, and YOU feel that you aren't getting the
    recognition you deserve in the scene, YOU can ask ME if you could have
    an FITC interview. :>  If you do this, just let me know where I can get
    one or two of your tunes.

    If you ask for an FITC interview, I will _most likely_ (90% chance or
    so) say yes, of course.  If I started denying everyone an interview
    because I didn't think they were good enough, it would be completely
    counterproductive, not to mention hypocritical.

    The bottom line is: if you want an interview, ask me. Don't worry that
    you're not good enough.  Just the fact that you strive to write quality
    music is a good quality in itself, and you probably have more potential
    than you think. :>

 _____Conclusion

 Anyhow, I'm rambling.  That means I should probably take the hint and wrap
 up this article. :>  Read TraxWeekly #26 if you haven't already, I might
 have said a few things in that article that I forgot to mention here.

 And if you have any questions/comments/suggestions, _please_ e-mail me.  To
 make my column successful, I need feedback from where it counts- the
 members of the scene themselves.  My first two interviews will be Master of
 Darkness of AIM Higher in TW27, and Mesonyx (who did 3 of the way-kewl
 Xixit tunes) in TW28.  Read them, enjoy them, learn from them. :>

 One last thing.  :>  Thanks to Snowman and Hornet, FITC will be featured in
 HORNET DemoNews as well!  So look forward to two different FITC columns
 each week, one in TraxWeekly, and one in Hornet DemoNews.

 This will allow me to double the amount of composers I can cover, and will
 reduce the chance of me having to deny or delay interviews due to the
 overwhelming response that I've gotten already.  Hopefully FITC will be
 doubly successful now thanks to this dual coverage. :>

 Thank you for supporting the dozens of aspiring musicians in the PC demo
 scene by supporting "Faces In The Crowd".  See you next week, and on IRC in
 the meantime! :>

=------------------------------------------------[Article Corrections]--[Ior]-=

 [This message is in reference to the 2-part ASM95 report we featured in
 DemoNews.100 and DemoNews.101]

 This is IOR again ... And I thought I was done with this string of
 articles, but I guess not :) First off, I was NOT trying to take any or all
 credit for running to compos, I was just trying to explain the view I had
 of the organizing and the way the compos were run.

 Secondly, I made a slight mistake in my articles (My memory is NOT perfect,
 I don't think anyone's is). I was not in the booth for the Amiga demo
 compo, but for the intro compo. I was not in the booth for any of the
 compos on Sunday, just the ones on Saturday. Thank you to those who
 mentioned my errors.
