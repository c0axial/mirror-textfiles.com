=-----------------------------------------[Introduction]--[Snowman and Rimbo]-=

 Hello all, and welcome to DemoNews issue 121.

 This week marks the official announcement of Music Contest 4.  Sometimes I
 have difficulty believing that the whole series started back in 1993 when a
 Chinese philosopher came to my house and told me "If you hold it, they will
 come."  I would also have difficulty believing that the contest actually
 started back in 1987 with Music Contest -5.  Even less realistic is the
 notion that people just started uploading "MC1" songs back in 1993 and I
 later invented a contest around them.  In any case, MC4 is nearly here.
 You know, 4 is a really big number if you think about it.

 I went out to eat with RaD Man / ACiD this week.  Now some of you might be
 thinking "Oh yucky!  Those ansi sceners have cooties!"  In many cases, you'd
 be right.  However, RaD Man impressed me... more than a little bit.  He's
 the current organizer of ACiD and has 6 years experience in the ansi scene.
 He is thoughtful, mature, and well organized.  Many of the organizational
 challenges faced by the ansi/art scene are more closely related to those
 of the demo scene than I had originally thought.

 Tension continues to grow within our group as the new file cataloging
 system for the Hornet archive is slowly designed and implemented.  If you
 see files being moved around, directories suddenly vanishing and
 reappearing, files sitting in /incoming even longer than normal, or
 00_index.txt files looking totally goofed up, don't be alarmed!  I can't
 even begin to list the advantages and features that this new "level 4"
 system will give.  It will probably be at least 4 months until this system
 is up and working properly.  As the scene changes, so must we with it.

 Last but not least, Rimbo offers an explanation of my introduction in
 DemoNews.120.

 _____Rimbo Writes

 Okay, I'd like to right just a little bit about Snomans intruduction last
 week. Frist and foremost, the hole thing was a JOKE!

 Let me try and explaine the joke for you who missed it.  First, he talks
 about how much quality has improved in DemoNews.  Than, he makes a bunch of
 deliberit misteaks such as "Quebec tried to SUCCEED from Canada."  He KNOWS
 that its spelled "secede," he was making a -JOKE-.  He even re-iterated the
 fact at the end of the introduction just too try and make things more plane.

 Snowman is a awesome editor, and never misses a misspeling or an grammer
 mistake, and you can be sure this are so because he edited this little
 letter of mine himself and it is completely flawless without any run-on
 sentences or speling flaws or typos so there.

=----------------------------------------[Music Contest 4 Announcement]--[GD]-=

 _____Introduction

 Got that tracking fever?

 Hornet is proud to announce that MC4 is approaching!  The contest will
 officially begin on May 31, and all entries will be due by July 15.

 An MC4 intro is being produced to announce the contest. Kiwidog is writing
 the code and Leviathan will be tracking the music for it, so it should be a
 real crowd-pleaser!

 Once again, ftp.cdrom.com will serve as the host site to the contest.  With
 the tremendous growth of the music scene, the increased exposure of the demo
 site, and the previous growth of prior Music Contests, it is our hope that
 this will be the biggest and best such contest in demo scene history.

 Due to Floss' recent hardware problems and his sometimes unstable email
 account which became a factor during MC3, he will be unable to help out with
 MC4.  I (GD) will be assuming this position for MC4, and will be the editor
 of the MC4 Updates Newsletter.

 _____MC4 Updates Newsletter

 This year, we are going to release a bi-weekly newsletter containing any
 updates or changes which occur once the contest has begun.  This will be the
 central location to find information on MC4.

 There will be six releases of this newsletter during the contest. The
 mailing list is now available, and I suggest you subscribe if you plan to
 enter or be a judge for the contest.

 How to subscribe:

 Mail to : listserver@unseen.aztec.co.za
 Body    : subscribe mc4-updates [first_name] [last_name]

 The listserver will send the MC4 Newsletter to your e-mail's return address.

 _____Changes since MC3

 First of all, the song size limit has been increased to 1,000,000 bytes. The
 limit in MC3 was 524,288 bytes (512 kb) and judging was limited to owners of
 Gravis soundcards.  However, this soundcard restriction has been removed for
 MC4 to encourage more people to vote.

 Why 1,000,000 bytes?  It's just easier to look at.

 There will once again be two entry divisions, rookie and veteran.  There
 will be two rounds of voting this time around to provide a more accurate
 ranking of the songs.

 We have more changes planned which you'll find out about soon!  An "alpha"
 version of the MC4 rules is scheduled to be released to the public within
 two weeks.  This will give everyone a chance to look for flaws and make
 corrections.

 _____Conclusion

 Please note that the plans are still being made and all information is not
 yet final.  I will attempt to handle any email sent to me, but it is still
 early yet, and I may not be able to answer all questions.

 This contest has been held annually since 1993.  It is well organized,
 professional, and FUN!  :)  You don't even have to leave your seat to
 enter.  Why not become part of the experience?

=-------------------------------------------[Tribute CD Review]--[Dan Wright]-=

 There is a new mod CD in town.  It is called Tribute and is produced by
 Diffusion/Xerez out of Denmark.  This BBS ready CD contains 286 megs of
 "authors" mods (91 directories), 42 megs of "rave labels," 99 megs of music
 disks, 200 megs of different styled music (classic, country, rock, techno,
 etc.), your favorite players (Cubic Player, CMOD, IPLAY, etc.) and a buggy
 menu interface.

 All of the music files on the CD are zipped so your choices on players are
 limited--Cubic Player is provided but it still can't play tagged files (one
 after the other) like a Cappa Mod which can't unzip files.  The CDs menu
 interface is nice but too buggy and featureless to be of any use.  So a
 Mod4Win might be your best bet in playing the music on this CD.

 The CD booklet/backliner are professionally printed (in color) with well
 done computer generated art--a surreal underwater effect.  The 4 color art
 on the CD--even though it is a dupe of the cover art--impressed me the most.

 The Cost of TRIBUTE is 100 Danish Krone.  Translated to US dollars at
 (5.6959Dkk to $1US) the CD sells for $17.55.  Throw in postage and your
 price rises to around $24 for US airmail delivery with the European mail
 rate being much less.

 The down sides of the CD are the buggy interface, cost, and the fact that
 all the modules are zipped.  Most players, unlike Cubic Player, can not
 uncompress ZIPs on the fly and play the modules.  The good side is a
 professionally packaged "non commercial" CD with tons of great tracked
 music.  Get it for your collection or get it to support Rene and future
 productions (namely audio CDs) under his Underground Records label.

=_-------------------------------------------[4DOS 4DEMOS: Part 7]--[Snowman]-=

 _____Introduction

 Welcome back to the 4DOS trainer series!  It's been a little while since
 I've done one of these so I might be a tad rusty.  In any case, this series
 is not dead (unlike Trixter's "VGA Tricks" series?).  :)  Since these
 tutorials have been going on for over 10 months now, I'm getting kind of
 anxious to finish them up and remove them from my "todo" list.

 Today we'll show you how to set up a multi-config environment in dos, how
 to do a basic tricky-prompt, and learn an undocumented feature of 4DOS that
 I discovered.

 _____General Overview

 This article assumes you have read Parts 1 through 6.  Be sure to follow
 all of the steps I listed there.  We will be relying on them now.  Just for
 reference, here is a list of what we have covered so far (and what we will
 cover today):

 _____Multi-Config

 Multi-config is a built-in MSDOS feature allowing you to select one of many
 system configurations at boot time.  For a PC demo scener today, at _least_
 two configurations are necessary.  I usually have between 3 and 5.

 Now you are yawning, thinking "but I already _know_ how to use
 multi-config!"  You do not. :)  There is a certain feature of multi-config
 that can be used intimately with 4DOS.  This would have been a logical
 place to tell you what that feature is.

 Let us cut the chit-chat... here's how you set it up.  Assume you want
 three configurations: a meaty config (CDROM drivers, network drivers,
 etc.), a normal config, and a bare-bones config (for demos that won't work
 under meaty and normal).

 In your config.sys file, you would put something like:

   [MENU]
   Menuitem=BMEATY,  --Meaty Boot-------- CDROM, Network, Mouse, VESA
   Menuitem=BNORMAL, --Normal Boot------- Mouse, VESA
   Menuitem=BBONES,  --Bare Bones Boot--- Himem.sys and a lot of love
   Menudefault=BMEATY,2

   [COMMON]
   ; put everything here that would be used in all 3 boot configurations
   ; (like DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS, SHELL=C:\4DOS\4DOS.COM, etc.)

   [BMEATY]
   ; put everything here for the meaty boot

   [BNORMAL]
   ; put everything here for the normal boot

   [BBONES]
   ; put everything here for the bare bones boot

 The only non-intuitive thing above is probably the "Menudefault=BMEATY,2".
 That simply means to wait "2" seconds before automatically booting up with
 BMEATY.

 After you select the desired configuration, DOS sets up an environmental
 variable called "config" which will be used in our autoexec.bat as well as
 other things in later tutorials.  Now you know what the secret feature is.

 Now we just have to make a few modifications to our autoexec.bat to reflect
 our new boot options:

   @echo off
   CALL C:\STARTUP\ENVIRON.BTM
   : put everything here that would be used in all 3 boot configurations
   : (like LH C:\4DOS\KSTACK.COM, LH C:\UNIVBE\UNIVBE.EXE, etc.).
   : remember that SUBSTituted drives belong here and not in ENVIRON.BTM
   goto %config%

   :BMEATY
   : put everything here for the meaty boot
   goto END

   :BNORMAL
   : put everything here for the normal boot
   goto END

   :BBARE
   : put everything here for the bare bones boot
   goto END

   :END

 That's it.  Now you can flip between different configurations depending on
 what you want to do.  Even after we are completely done booting, that
 "config" variable remains set.  We will use it later.

 _____The Basic Prompt

 PROMPT $P$G

 Do you know how boring that looks?  What is it going to tell you?  Current
 drive and directory you say?  <yawn>

 The prompt should be your friend.  You see it every time you type something
 in.  It is now time to make that prompt mature and grow, add color and
 information, let it become the king of all prompts.

 Setting up a complex prompt poses two minor problems.  First, most
 DOS-based text editors will not display more than 80 columns on the screen.
 If you go over 80 characters, you either word wrap the line too early or
 you can not see the entire setting at once.  This makes it difficult to
 write the prompt.  Second, the prompt itself is somewhat limited in space
 (I think 255 bytes maximum can normally be allocated to it).  We will find
 work-arounds to both problems.

 First let us discuss adding information to your prompt.  Back in part 5 of
 this tutorial, I talked about basic level function calls.  It is time to
 solidify some of those concepts.  We will be using our ENVIRON.BTM file to
 set our prompt up.  Did you add all those section headers from part 6 of
 this tutorial?  :)

 Think of the most critical pieces of information about your system's
 configuration.  How about BASE, XMS, and EMS memory?  It is very easy to
 add these to your prompt.  Observe:

   SET PROMPT=base:%%@DOSMEM[k] ems:%%@EMS[k] xms:%%@XMS[k] $_$p$g

 Now our prompt might look something like:

   base:610 ems:15670 xms:15670
   c:\>

 Note that the "$_" above simply means to issue a newline.  If we left it
 off, our prompt would have just looked like:

   base:610 ems:15670 xms:15670 c:\>

 Now, this example looked ok because our "SET PROMPT=" statement was not
 very big.  Things are quickly going to get very hairy and unorganized if we
 do not break our prompt up.  Let us redo the above example.  In your
 ENVIRON.BTM file you could put something like:

   : -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   : SET PROMPT - Makes my prompt look just the way I like it.  :)
   : -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   : Base Memory
   SET P_DOSMEM=base:%%@DOSMEM[k]
   : EMS Memory
   SET P_EMS=ems:%%@EMS[k]
   : XMS Memory
   SET P_XMS=xms:%%@XMS[k]
   : Ending Stuff
   SET P_FINISH=$_$p$g

   SET PROMPT=%P_DOSMEM %P_XMS %P_EMS %P_FINISH

   : Deallocate variables
   SET P_DOSMEM=
   SET P_EMS=
   SET P_XMS=
   SET P_FINISH=

 All we have done is to make little happy subvariables out of each prompt
 part.  We set all of these up, make our big prompt, then destroy them. This
 gives us the opportunity to keep things organized in a logical manner, as
 well as let us see everything on-screen.  In a future tutorial, I will show
 how to create local variables so we can even eliminate the "Deallocate
 variables" section.

 There is one problem with the above section.  If we left it the way it is,
 DOS would see these mini-variables, do the function calls, and assign an
 unchanging result value to our prompt.  For example, our

   SET P_DOSMEM=base:%%@DOSMEM[k]

 subvariable might be evaluated to

   SET P_DOSMEM=base:610

 and then assigned to our prompt.  Our prompt would then always say that we
 had 610k of base memory regardless of what the actual value was.  We need
 to prevent our little subvariables from being evaluated prematurely.

 Luckily, there is a way to do this.  The command is called "setdos" and it
 controls several DOS attributes including variable expansion.  Observe:

   : -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   : SET PROMPT - Makes my prompt look just the way I like it.  :)
   : -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   : Do not expand the following environmental variables
   setdos /x-35678

   : Set our little subvariables here

   : From this point on, we want to expand the environmental variables
   setdos /x0

   : Now make our big prompt

 Now the function calls in our subvariables are not evaluated when they are
 created.  Rather, they are evaluated _after_ they have been assigned to the
 BIG PROMPT.  These functions will be evaluated every time our prompt
 appears, giving us an accurate picture of what our system currently looks
 like.

 The next part of this tutorial will discuss adding color to your prompt.

 _____The UNKNOWN_CMD Alias

 4DOS has a very special alias.  It is called UNKNOWN_CMD.  Observe:

   C:\>start Cubic Player v1.666 NOW!
   Unknown command "START"

   C:\>ALIAS UNKNOWN_CMD=`echo Sorry man... I can't`

   C:\>start Cubic Player v1.666 NOW!
   Sorry man... I can't start Cubic Player v1.666 NOW!

 So what have we learned?  We can change our "Unknown command" error message
 to something a little more abusive or creative.  This might be cool, but is
 not really useful.

 But instead of just changing the UNKNOWN_CMD alias to a different message,
 why don't we actually change it to a different _command_?  I am proud to
 say I discovered this one myself and do not believe it to be documented
 publicly anywhere until now.  Observe:

   C:\>dos
   Unknown command "DOS"

   C:\>ALIAS UNKNOWN_CMD=cdd

   C:\>dos

   C:\DOS>

 We've actually made a bad command into a good one.  Instead of issuing an
 error message, 4DOS tried to change directories to the command you typed.
 Think about it.  All we have to do is type in the name of a subdirectory
 and 4DOS changes to it.  We can completely navigate our hard drive without
 ever using the "CD" command!  Having our CDPATH variable set (see part 3)
 along with UNKNOWN_CMD gives you an _extremely_ efficient way of getting
 around.

 I haven't even seen a UNIX shell that can boast this kind of efficiency.

 _____Conclusion

 DOS is dying a slow and painful death, taking 4DOS with it.  However, 4DOS
 has been converted to several other PC-based operating systems. In future
 editions of this article I'll start to discuss how to port your own 4DOS
 environment to Windows 3.1, NT, 95, and OS/2.

 With the basics covered, we are starting to get into some very cool topics.
 The next edition of this series will talk about an intermediate level
 prompt, using escape sequences in odd places, and moving your autoexec.bat
 file out of the root directory.

 And remember, 4DOS 4EVER!
