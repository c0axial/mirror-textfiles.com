((Section 1...Standard Info))
==============================================================================
    DemoNews is a weekly publication dedicated to the demo scene.  It is
produced at the Internet FTP site ftp.eng.ufl.edu (aka WASP or HORNET).  
This newsletter focuses on all aspects of demos and demo-making  (including 
music, art, and coding).

There are currently three active demo-operators at this site:
     
     Dan Wright (Pallbearer) - dmw@eng.ufl.edu
     Christopher G. Mann (Snowman) - r3cgm@dax.cc.uakron.edu
     Mike - weis@elf.stuba.sk

    This site is mirrored by the following ftps:
         ftp.uwp.edu
         ftp.luth.se
         ftp.sun.ac.za
         ftp.uni-erlangen.de
         ftp.uni-paderborn.de

If you would like to receive a new copy of Demo News every Sunday in your
mailbox write to dmw@eng.ufl.edu.  We delete all bounced mail from this
service, so if you SHOULD BE getting Demo News and ARE NOT, please re-request
this newsletter.

==============================================================================
((Section 2...General))
==============================================================================

If you are interested in reviewing demos please WRITE me.  We have a couple 
people doing some reviews now.  Brandon is working on demos M-Z in the  
alpha/NEW and Akatinde reviewed a lot of the A-L demos recently.  This has
been appeneded to the DEMOS.TXT file in case you were wondering.

Check the /democd directory for OLDER demos which will not be listed in
this newsletter as moved. (This may change but when there are a ton of 
files I just move them...)

I will keep this short because I did not have time to do much this
week.  That together with the "incoming" directory changing owner caused
us to get backlogged.  Hopefully next week we will be back to normal.

ASSEMBLY '94 stuff?  As of 11:30pm EST Saturday nothing has been uploaded
to the /incoming/asm94 directory.

 GENERAL
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     This issue almost didn't happen.  The /incoming directory went haywire
this Saturday (the day I do all my work), and I almost wasn't able to get my
stuff in for this issue.
     Anyway, I guess ASM94 is just about over here in the USA (time-wise),
and I look forward to getting the new files in the next couple of days.  This
week a lot of unusual and hard-to-catagorize things were uploaded.  This makes
our job a little bit harder, but who's complaining?
     I finished the MC][ files program this week.  It will be shipped to the
distro sites, and allow them to coordinate MC][ files more.
     Also, I am going to start distributing DEMOcd forms to my family and
coworkers this week.  I should be able to get rid of about 25 or so of 'em
this way.
     Until next issue, take care.  -Snowman

Subject: Some notes to demos creators

Hello from Moscow, Russia.

1) Don't forgive about SB/Sbpro owners.
   It's _very_ boring about ripping your music from demos and hear them
   separately after demo-looking. It's seems like all demomakers are using
   one or two public playing routinges. Please, write it your self or contact
   with Otto chrons to reach all-supporting (but in my opinion Renaissance's
   player play nicely ;) At last weeks released demos from Impact Studios
   and Legend and we satisfied with quality and perfomance. But only GUS 
   support. Thats nice to meet in one or two places to hear/look demos to
   listen GUS musax but not always.

2) About speed: Yeah, of course, we understand, in USA and Hungary (Magic 12)
   =) all demos creators have i486DX66 in use. Okay, but mostly guys at 
   Russia have i386DX33 or DX40. 

3) Sources: seems like Renaissance or Future Crew released music/.coding 
   routines at ftp and thru boards and each who wanted become DEMOS CREATOR.
   Nice! But we lost most interesting ideas! And  practically _all_
   demoses (except some groups) have equal look.

                Sire Gongofer//DDT//OMNi WWDC// Chameleon.

[I ran out of time in trying to "correct" all the mistakes in this little
 announcement from Gongofer but hey, I formatted it nicely and that counts.]

ELASTIK productions up to date include an intro, a musicHARDdisk and ABT,
Advanced 16 bit Tracker. The intro and the musicHARDdisk were released
at Assembly '94. The release date of ABT is not set yet. ABT is currently
our main project and the finished product was on display at ASM'94. ABT
supports true 16 bit stereo sound at 44.1 kHz using 14 channels, the 
maximum number of channels being 32. ABT includes a number of special effects 
and concurrent MIDI with no sample length limitations. ABT is currently a 
GUS only tracker, but we are planning to add SB AWE32 support later on. 
The fate of ABT is currently still an open question. It is up to you, the
people, to come and tell us what you really think of ABT. The specs for ABT
follow... 

Later days,
                Dirk  & Sir Adrian
