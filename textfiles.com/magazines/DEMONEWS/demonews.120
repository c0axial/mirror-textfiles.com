=---------------------------------------------------[Introduction]--[Snowman]-=

 Hello all, and welcome to DemoNews issue 120.

 I sure am late getting this one out, eh?  :)  So just what prevented this
 issue's timely release?  Call it reflective nostalgia.  I've recently been
 going back through older issues of DemoNews, noting gradual (and
 occasionally dramatic) changes that have shaped the newsletter you read
 today.

 Over the years, quality control... <yawn>.  You're bored aren't you?  You
 don't want to hear me ramble about changes to DemoNews.  You don't want to
 read five more paragraphs of text dealing with random aspects of our demo
 archive, right?  You want to read something spicy, something juicy,
 something you can jump on #trax and tell everyone else about.  Maybe we can
 strike a healthy balance here.  How about I use exciting _words_ but keep
 the same content?  Let's give it a go...

 Whoa!  Kiwidog didn't do a code article this week!  Man, that BITES.  I've
 heard from tons of people (Trixter) that his articles roK.  Oh yeah... I
 forgot.  KD mentioned something about working on Terraformer's NAID demo.
 Get a load of that.  Says he'll be too "busy" to write another article
 until after NAID.  So what about all those North American coders who were
 counting on his articles to write _their_ NAID demos?  Huh?  Ever think of
 that?  I didn't think so!

 Hey, while I'm thinking about NAID... I heard on the news the other day
 that Quebec was trying to succeed from Ontario.  Reminds me of that
 American mini-series on TV a while back called "The North and the South".
 It had that one guy in it who played William Riker on Star Trek TNG.  How
 did he ever keep his beard so neat and trim anyway?  I wonder if they make
 special brushes?

 I can not continue to write like that.  Not only does it have nothing to do
 with demos, but it sounds more like an AOL user's first time on
 comp.sys.ibm.pc.demos than a formal introduction to a widely read
 newsletter.  As I was saying previously...

 Over the years, quality control on DemoNews has gone up substantially. This
 has enabled us to avoid embarrassing mistakes, such as: grammatical,
 logical, and conceptual errors.  I consider it a blessing that we have
 learned to avoid childish and immature remarks, focusing on the topic at
 hand and doing a good job presenting information.  We have a wide variety
 of articles for your reading pleasure this week so relax and enjoy, DUDE!

=---------------------------------------------------------[Rumors]--[Trixter]-=

 Here are some general rumors.  Most are verified to be true:

 It is estimated that NAID's turnout will double in size, to 1500 people.

 Trixter is thinking about tracking.  No, seriously.  No, he really means it.

 3some is over 50% done with their NAID intro, whose concept is a demo that
 runs backwards.  Undrawing shadebobs, fire that flames downward, etc.

 Jeroen Tel is getting ready to release a musicpack that will kick some
 serious ass.

 Hornet's NAID Demo (as coded by Trixter, anyway) will most likely place in
 the top 5, but Trixter can't guarantee a winning position.  At least it
 won't be "Go Easter".

 Vogue and Lizardking of Triton are in California right now finishing up
 Into The Shadows.

 LakEE / Craw Productions has written and released a song that he wants to
 be the theme song to NAID.

 According to Daredevil, there is a very good chance that Tran will attend
 NAID.

 With everyone migrating from BBSes to the Internet, there is a lack of
 demand for ANSI.  As such, many groups, such as ACiD, are finding it harder
 to find home bases/locations.

 JsNO / Ex-Hornet, is considering porting his FunkTracker to XWindows (a
 windowing environment under UNIX).

 There are several older demoscenes (Atari 400/800, ST; Spectrum 128K) and
 newer demoscenes (Archemedies Acorn RISC PC) that many sceners have never
 heard of.

 The new Amiga computers being designed currently will *not* be based on the
 Motorola 680x0 series of chips (they will be PowerPCs), making them
 incompatible with all previous Amiga demos.

 Snowman is thinking of gathering up all these rumors, asking for
 more from other Hornet members, and printing them in DemoNews.

=---------------------------------------------[Realtime Raytracing]--[Fornax]-=

 _____Introduction

 Like pretty well everyone who saw Transgression 2, I was amazed by the
 realtime raytracing.  I was intrigued by how they managed to do it and
 started watching it over and over again trying to figure out what they did.
 Here are the two ideas I came up with.  I'm not sure if this is what MFX
 actually did but it's a decent enough starting point.
 
 _____Resolution Reduction

 The one thing everyone noticed was the low res which looked really crappy
 in the faked 262144 color mode (that's why I run it in the 64k color mode).
 Most of you probably already realize that the pixels were doubled, making
 the screen effectively 160x100.  Another thing many of you may have noticed
 is that not the entire screen was used.  Let's say 160x80.  That cuts down
 the time to calculate a frame quite a bit.  Try running POV at that
 resolution with a sphere and a plane.  It's definitely not fast enough for
 animation.

 So let's look again...

 Unless you've got incredibly bad eyesight, you'll see the use of blobs
 which are approximately 5x5 (of the doubled pixels).  This now makes the
 screen effectively 32x16.  Now try running a sphere and plane scene again
 in POV, this time at 32x16.  It's much faster, _almost_ fast enough for
 animation.  You've probably realized that the circular fashion of the blobs
 would leave gaps in the screen, but that can be taken care of by
 alternating rays like this:

   O - No ray fired, X - ray fired

   Frame 1 - OXOXO       Frame 2 - XOXOX
             XOXOX                 OXOXO
             OXOXO                 XOXOX

 Using a method similar to that would reduce the number of rays cast
 significantly and still fill the screen with enough blobs to make the image
 appear to have a decent resolution.  Actually if you think about it, you
 could use that method to reduce the number of rays cast to less than 32x16
 'cause 32x16 would give 512 rays to cast per frame and TGR2 by default
 casts a maximum of 400 rays and a minimum of 100.

 I tried running a sphere and plane scene in POV with resolutions lower than
 32x16.  It's not that much faster but it may do.  Still, there are other
 aspects of ray tracing which could be sped up.  A couple of them can be
 fixed with simple lookup tables.  However, there's one that, to my
 knowledge, can't be fixed with a lookup table.  At least not a reasonably
 sized one.
 
 _____Length Calculation

 The main speed loss in raytracing is the infamous SQRT which is found in
 length calculation.  That blasted 3D version of the pythagorean theorem is
 a real lag in the routine.  I wondered if there was any way to calculate
 the length without the SQRT.  Obviously lookup tables were out of the
 question. Then I remembered an alternate method to using the pythagorean
 theorem. It's a method used in Wolfenstein style games.  The method is used
 in 2D and I believe there's probably a way to do it in 3D.

 Anyway, for those of you who understand 2D raycasting, you will hopefully
 understand what I'm about to write. Those who don't know much about 2D
 raycasting can download one of the many textfiles on it (I got my
 information from Tricks of the Game Programming Gurus, I'm not sure if
 ACK3D uses the same method, but it's worth a try).
 
   For horizontal intersections on a 2D plane:

                                                1
   distance = (X_intersection - X_origin) * ----------
                                            cos(angle)
 
   For vertical intersections on a 2D plane:

                                                1
   distance = (Y_intersection - Y_origin) * ----------
                                            sin(angle)
 
 I really don't want to go into raycasting.  So like I said earlier, if you
 don't understand it, get a text on 2D raycasting.  I still am not sure if
 or how something like this can be applied to 3D but I believe by using
 Spherical Coordinates to represent each ray being cast, one can derive
 formulas, similar to the ones above, for finding the length of a 3D line.
 Of course, I don't know too much about Spherical Coords so I don't think
 I'll be finding a method anytime soon.  Hopefully someone else will...

 If you have any questions, feel free to email me.

=--------------------------------------------[The Assembly Situation]--[Pehu]-=

 _____Introduction

 This is the official announcement of the Assembly Situation.

 There has been a lot of speculation what will happen and what the situation
 is. I hope this news posting will clear most of it, and I hope people will
 spread it across the networks.

 _____The Money

 Assembly '95 still owes people prizes in money.  This is a very annoying
 situation that we still work on.  Romware has _finally_ made the Assembly
 '95 CD and we are waiting for the sales data.  But don't be too optimistic,
 we are not waiting.  We had the CD ready at the beginning of October but it
 only just now came out.  From this money, all will be spent on prizes.  We
 will have a website to serve people on the internet - it will come up
 soonish, we only need some gfx for it.

 From all this we will give all money to the prizes.  Also, at some point,
 there will be a list of people who have been paid so you can check the
 situation if need be.

 Some people have made 'threats' of suing: it is ok.  They are allowed to do
 that but at this point we don't see any reason to continue our work so it
 is solely up to people to do what they want.  The situation isn't easy for
 us either, as we made the best party ever and now the glory has been
 stained with this incident.  Years of nonpaying work for nothing.

 _____Assembly '96

 This party will not be held.  Mainly the reason is that we don't want to
 start organizing anything with prizes still unpaid.  I hope someone can
 organize a good summer event here in Finland and we shall see what happens
 at 97.  :)

 The people who have been promised CDs will get them as soon as we get them
 from Romware.  We have received 10 promotional CDs, that's all.

 In general, people have been very supportive.  I thank you all those who
 have called or mailed us and who have had patience.  Those kinds of spirits
 are rare nowadays and I thank you for giving us some extra strength to
 continue the work that is still in process.  Lots of things have happened.
 There have been lots of hopes and now we have decided the way we take.  I
 am sorry if I have missed some emails.  I have tried to reply to everyone
 but I have had a lot of work here so I apologize if some of you haven't
 received a reply.

 Assembly '96 would have rocked, with 2M ethernets and links abroad, lotsa
 new features and stuff for people to enjoy.  But again, I hope people
 understand why we don't want to have it, and I feel we have made the right
 choice although it feels quite sad.

 So, why did all this happen?  There have been many wild rumors about it,
 but in short: the damages to the fair center were a bit too big and the
 insurance company did not pay one single penny.  Also, we got few extra
 bills that were quite unremarkable but still justified.  So, you can thank
 all those people who painted the walls, broke windows and demolished the
 toilets.  We should have had the rule that all the damages would be taken
 from the prizes... that way, the damages would have been much smaller.

 Be it then a success or not, we are working to get the prizes paid.  I
 think they will be... eventually.  I don't want to give up if people still
 have faith that they will get their fair share.

 Well, I think this has been short. If someone else wants to know about the
 situation, they are free to mail us at assembly@assembly.org.  But, please
 give us some time to reply as we are quite busy with other work.

=---------------------------------[Review of "Blur Religion" Musicdisk]--[GD]-=

 _____Introduction

 Following up his four-channel .MOD musicdisk "Kaktoos" which was released
 in May of 1995, Mellow-D has released his second musicdisk under Five
 Musicians which proves to be his most definitive collection of songs to
 date.

 This new disk is a reflection of the changes in his life, as he said "I've
 been enormously inspired ... by a number of factors, the biggest one being
 my move to Belgium."  He also cites groups such as the Orb, Front 242, and
 Rage Against the Machine as influences for his new music.

 If you look, you'll find poetry scattered in some of the sampletexts.  This
 musicdisk was originally going to have a graphical interface, but time fell
 short and the idea will be postponed for Mellow-D's next disk, which he has
 scheduled for the end of 1996.  Some of the poetry that was going to be
 used in the interface can be found in the sampletext area of some of the
 songs.

 In the text that comes with this disk, the composer recommends a certain
 order for listening to the songs.  Below, each song is discussed in this
 order.

 _____Gum Flex Tide

 This song starts out in a trancey fashion with a strong bass line and
 gradually acquires a drum beat.  Ambient synth pads follow, as does an acid
 bass line.

 Among the many accomplishments of this song is the fact that there is a
 techno styled bass drum sample in the song but it is not used at regular
 intervals (a mistake that many so-called "techno" songs make).

 Gum.Flex.Tide was the first to be completed specifically for the disk (the
 actual first completed song on this disk was "Nouveau").  This tune has one
 of the biggest atmospheric feelings out of any song on this disk.  It has
 lots of open space, often eliminating the drums and bass line while gliding
 along with only synth pads.

 _____International Beetle

 Combine elements of industrial, trance, and a merry-go-round, and you may
 end up with this song.  Smashing glass, the erratic noises of a dot matrix
 printer, and a swing tempo are some of the elements that fuel this musical
 idea.

 A very experimental song starting with a very clever bassline and ending
 with a sudden dropoff, this song is unpredictable even after several
 listenings.  However, the chaos spilled throughout is not enough to disrupt
 the continuity of the piece.

 _____Fix

 This song starts off with a a distorted bassline and a swing tempo.  Next
 follows some nice string arpeggios.  It has kind of a weird happy feeling
 to it overall.  At the end of the piece, it "falls apart" with the
 instruments straying from the organized fashion they maintain throughout
 the rest of the song.

 There's no excessive repetition in the song, but parts are re-used in
 different combinations.  The string arpeggios are used over different bass
 parts, the intro bass line is played over a very low-pitched industrial
 sounding drumline, and no section is maintained for too long throughout the
 song.

 _____Me Machine

 Starting off with a bouncey feel and a low drum line, this song and its
 bass line can have adverse effects on certain people. One such listener has
 reported a desire to "commit violent crimes" after hearing this tune.

 Towards the middle, the song breaks down and begins to fill your head with
 weird voice clips.  Among these voices is one that says "the movement of
 Miss Saigon."  Excessive echoes on certain sounds give a very professional
 sound to the song.

 About three-fourths of the way through the song, a lot of the "weirdness"
 is taken out and a synth/string section is repeated.  Underneath this
 section is a light drum beat and a bass line which drag the song to its
 ending.

 _____Syanide Self

 Described by the composer as "distortion, cacophony, and weirdness," this
 song has probably the most aggressive intro of all the songs in this set.
 It helps define the mood for the rest of the song, which is also similarly
 aggressive and defiant.

 The elements of this song are small musical ideas which work well together
 and would also sound good by themselves.  There's a simple string melody, a
 well written bass line, an interesting synth melody which complements the
 bass line well, and defiant percussion accompaniment which sets the pace
 for the rest of the song.

 _____Mandarin Ride

 Beginning with a simple string progression, then adding a complex drum
 rhythm and an acid synth riff, this song doesn't progress as one might
 expect.  There's also a strange background noise that almost sounds like an
 electronic cow.

 Again we find Mellow-D using a faint and distant drum beat to cover some
 sections before returning the "normal" sounding drum line.  The depth of
 the alternate rhythm section gives a very loose feel to the sections during
 which it is used, which in turn give the song its character.

 _____Nouveau

 This song is older than the rest.  It was originally intended to be used in
 Surprise Production's "Scenial" diskmag, but it remained unused in
 Mellow-D's collection.

 Being older than the rest of the musicdisk material, this song doesn't fit
 in as well with the others.  It's a bit more straightforward and less
 atmospheric than the other songs.

 However, it is also very well composed, and each section fits well with the
 rest.  The rhythm section is very well laid out, with a slick drum part and
 a bass line with alternating intensity in the attack.

 _____Conclusion

 The musicdisk "Blur Religion" is a collection of seven new works by
 Mellow-D of Five Musicians.  The music is experimental, ambient, and fresh.
 Some may find it a bit too experimental for their liking, however.

 Unfortunately, since the XM format is one of the newer and more advanced
 module formats, these songs should be played in Fast Tracker to hear them
 the way the composer intended them to sound.  The support for the XM format
 in players such as Cubic Player and CapaMod 3 won't accurately play all
 these songs.

 The music in this collection is unlike Mellow-D's older music.  Using Fast
 Tracker 2 to create the music and some of the samples, he has taken
 advantage of features such as panning envelopes and unlimited sample size.

 This musicdisk can be found on ftp.cdrom.com under /demos/music/disks/1996
 or on ftp.axs.net under /demos/music/fm.  fm-blurr.zip is the filename.
 With each song in the area of 500k, the entire musicdisk after compression
 is around 2mb in size.

=--------------------------------------[Top 10 List of a Demo Addict]--[Sage]-=

 (All names and titles used in this article are used strictly for
 demonstrative purposes, and no offense is intended towards the respective
 holders.)

 One night, after achieving a drunken type stupor from watching a horde of
 demos and listening to some amazing S3M's, I sat in a daze and experienced
 a moment of outward contemplation (it really was a scary moment I'd not be
 eager to repeat!).

 Well, I wondered about the nature of the cosmos, whether God really exists,
 and whether I am addicted to demos, among other such deep concepts.  To
 find out whether I really _am_ addicted to demos (I decided to let the
 other questions pass because they gave me a headache :), I created a little
 top ten list.  Maybe you will find it useful yourself.
 
 10. Your dog is named White Shadow, your cat is named Miss Saigon, and your
     goldfish is named Whalebone.
 09. You have had a computer surgically incorporated into your body so that
     you can watch Second Reality over, and over, and over...
 08. You have forgotten the names of your school friends and brother, but
     have created pet names for each pixel on your computer's monitor so that
     you wont be lonely.
 07. You can't pickup a date because girls get the wrong idea when you ask if
     they'll come over and compose with you.
 06. You are doing some serious coding at 2:00 in the morning, and have
     sudden, unexplainable cravings for Jelly Tots. (See Demonews issue
     number 75: Hey, Denthor! ;)
 05. You sweat, act ornery, and feel nauseated whenever you don't get your
     proper daily intake of demo watching.
 04. You think of what life would be like without demos and find yourself
     involuntarily screaming in horror.
 03. Your idea of an excellent Saturday night is sitting in front of your
     monitor with a bag of Cheetos, a six-pack of Root Beer, and issues one
     through one-hundred twenty of DemoNews.
 02. You have moved from The Hardy Boys series and Spider-man comics to books
     like Assembly Language: Master Class, and Programmer's Guide to the EGA,
     VGA, and Super VGA Cards.
 01. You have started to make stupid little top 10 lists to determine whether
     you are addicted to demos or not.

 In curiosity, I followed this list, and there can be no lying, I guess I
 _am_ a demo addict...and all the more glad for it!
