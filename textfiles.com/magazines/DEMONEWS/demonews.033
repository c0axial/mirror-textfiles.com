MUSIC
=====

If anything music related is placed in the incoming directory I usually
move (mv) it to SNOWMANS /incoming/music directory and let him take care
of the files.  That is why I sometimes put question marks (?) with the
music related files I list.  Snowman may move the files or keep them in the
incoming/music directory or even delete them.

FINALLY
=======

Hopefully our script works this week and everyone on the mailing list
will get this.  If you get two copies then we still have bugs.  If it
bounces I will attempt to fix my mistake.  Of course, if you mailed us
and did not receive this via e-mail on SUNDAY morning then let us know.
(Someone from Iguana mailed me but my E-mail bounced so I took you off
the list--I need a better E-mail address then name@zipi.)

The TOP25DL file was incorrect last week and will probably be 
incorrect this week.  It has something to do with the FTP.SYSLOG not
being properly processed.  

Any ideas, problems, suggestions?  Then write to:
