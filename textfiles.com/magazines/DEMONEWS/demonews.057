((Section 1...Standard Info))
==============================================================================
    DemoNews is a weekly publication dedicated to the demo scene.  It is
produced at the Internet FTP site ftp.eng.ufl.edu (aka WASP or HORNET).  
This newsletter focuses on all aspects of demos and demo-making  (including 
music, art, and coding).

There are currently four active demo-operators at this site:
     
     Dan Wright (Pallbearer) - dmw@eng.ufl.edu
     Christopher G. Mann (Snowman) - r3cgm@dax.cc.uakron.edu
     Mike - weis@elf.stuba.sk
     Jason - cavalier@anshar.shadow.net

    This site is mirrored by the following ftps:
         ftp.uwp.edu
         ftp.luth.se
         ftp.sun.ac.za
         ftp.uni-erlangen.de
         ftp.uni-paderborn.de

If you would like to receive a new copy of Demo News every Sunday in your
mailbox write to dmw@eng.ufl.edu.  We delete all bounced mail from this
service, so if you SHOULD BE getting Demo News and ARE NOT, please re-request
this newsletter.

==============================================================================
((Section 2...General))
==============================================================================

SPACE

It seems that we are limited to 400 Megs on this ftp site (eng.ufl.edu)
thus we will now reach max capacity more often until either we
can get more space (doubtful), someone donates a hard drive, or we move
the site to another location.  Maybe someone out there has an extra SCSI
1 gig hard drive they could donate.  Or maybe someone out there pulls in
a great deal of dough and would not mind parting with some so this site
can increase its space for demos/music/whatever.  I do not like the idea
of deleting demos so the ANSI and MUSIC directories will suffer because
of our limitation.  SCSI gig drives go for $700 nowadays in the US.  We
welcome contributions and will tell you where to send them.  Till we get
that hard drive grab all the old files you can cause they will be going
going gone really soon.  Too bad we couldn't collect a 50 cent fee from
all the ASSEMBLY goers...that would have easily paid for a hard drive and
no one loses much money.

This little newsreader reaches over 340 people now.  Quite an improvement
for less than a year.  Typically I get about 10 bounces and will attempt
to correct the problem.  If I can not I typically delete the bounced
entry so if you do not get this file two weeks after requesting it then
you are OFF the list and need to "re" subscribe.

Anyone go to WOODSTOCK '94 or HOPE this weekend in New York.

==============================================================================
((Section 4...Music Articles - MC][))
==============================================================================
 GENERAL
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    I am busy.

    Music Contest ][ takes a lot of my time, so if I can make things more
efficient in my other duties, it relieves a lot of stress.  In pursuit of this
I am going to ask everyone who uploads music files this week to follow a few
simple rules:
        1. TYPE "bin" BEFORE YOU UPLOAD.
        2. INCLUDE A .txt FILE WITH YOUR UPLOAD.
        3. DO NOT UPLOAD FILES TO BOTH /incoming AND /incoming/music.
    It makes my job much more difficult if I have to unzip every file uploaded
for a FILE_ID.DIZ.

    We ran out of room again on Hornet this week.  Apparently, my /music
directory was eating up 100 megs of the 400 we have been allocated.  About
half of that 100 was from music disks, and so this week a lot of them went
bye-bye.  Don't bitch at me if yours was one of them.  We are more than happy
to accept donated hard drives to increase our online storage (talk to Dan).

    I really hate to say this, but unless you have something specific that
you need me to do, please don't write me.  I used to pride myself on the
amount of mail I receive, but if this trend continues, I won't be able to
respond to mail in a quick and timely manner.  The following are valid reasons
for contacting me:
        1. You have a question about Music Contest ][.
        2. You have an advertisement or something else to go in Demonews.
        3. You accidentally uploaded something ASCII instead of BIN.
        4. You are reporting a problem with Hornet (out of space, denied, etc)
        5. You can help relieve my workload in some way.

    If I am to pull off MC][ and make it be as professional a contest as I am
hoping, I can't handle chit-chat mail.  This really depresses me.  :(  I used
to be able to download songs, and write the author if I liked them.  I used to
be able to write music (which I can't much anymore).  I used to be able to get
on IRC and chat.  Now, it is all I can do to get these weekly articles in.
This will continue until late September, and you can expect short articles
from me in here until that point.

    Should you be able to help me in any way (handling the workload), please
do contact me.  Remember, this is only temporary.  Once MC][ and the DemoCD
are finished, I should have time to settle back into my normal routine of
writing to friends and helping people out.

    Best of luck in whatever you do, and keep on trakin'

((Section 5...Demo CD))
==============================================================================

Check /pub/msdos/demos/incoming/democd for UPDATES and information.
(i.e. More information, cost, how to get the DEMO/MC][ CD)

MUSIC

In case you did not understand we do plan on having a Digital Audio portion
on this DEMO/MUSIC CD we are working on.  Most of the TUNES will come from
the winners in the MC][ contest (/demos/incoming/mc2) but there is STILL
space for non MC][ enteries.  IF you have a tune you think should be
included on the CD (Digital Audio) then tell us about it and/or submit it.
There are some tunes out there we would include in a second if they were
submitted but that has yet to happen.  Remember...your favorite song still
has a chance if WE KNOW about it. (CCCatch, PM...any takers?)

ART

We could REALLY use some help with ART for the CD.  I can send you all the
specs regarding size/format/etc.  You will get many professional copies
of your ART back if you do contribute.  Everything will need to be converted
to Corel Draw format for color separation--2 or 4 colors.  We have upto
six spaces for design including the 2 color CD design.  If you can help
we need to know ASAP.  The art needs to be complete next MONTH.
