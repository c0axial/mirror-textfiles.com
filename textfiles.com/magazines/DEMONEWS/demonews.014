NEWSGROUP 
=========

There has not been many responses to the RFD demogroups posting on the 
news.groups section of the NEWSREADER this last week.  I wonder if a 
Call For Votes will be taken?  Where are all the people?  The NEWSREADER
is an excellent place to talk and find out about the newest demos.  You
could be reading that instead of this.  So go make some NOISE!  Subscribe
to the ...pc.soundcards and news.groups and lets get this newsgroup.

OVER THERE
\\\\\\\\\\\

A few people in the UK plan on putting together a BBSable CD.  I believe it
will be under the HOT STUFF "label" in case any of you are familiar with
those people.  The CD will contain 600MBytes (Ziped) of Demos, FLI's, GLs, 
MODs, MIDI, Gifs, and games.  The full package will cost around $50 for 
anyone interested.  If you would like any of your stuff to appear on the CD
then contact rob@sound.demon.co.uk  This includes demo groups and such.

I shall be graduating MAY 1 1993.  From that time on (and perhaps earlier) 
I will no longer be able to maintain or provide any help in updating this
(these) demo site(s).  If anyone would like the "job" of maintaining, 
commenting, updating, organizing, and continuing the progress I have begun
please let me know.  It does require some "time" but then again, so does 
everything.

--Check out the TOP25DL this week.  Kinda weird how over 500 people Retrieved
  a file called xwingdmo.  Someone actually UPLOADED it and mentioned it
  was on this site on the ...pc.games NEWSGROUP.  No wonder the ftp.syslog
  is over 2 Megs!

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
PROPOSED CHANGES
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

--As you may have noticed the "source.code" directory has been renamed to
  "source" because of a suggestion a user made.

--Some proposed changes include 2 possibilities:
  1)  Moving the TEXT files to a subdirectory.
  2)  Create subdirectories for each demo group.

--Then again, if no one makes a comment on the above changes perhaps I'll do
  what I feel is best.

================
CLOSING COMMENTS
================

--This weeks DEMOSITE quote comes from orion@ somewhere in San Francisco
                 "If you fail to plan then plan to fail."

--I added a "text" subdirectory withing the demos directory on the
  WASP site.  It has old DEMO.NEWS text files.
