GENERAL STUFF
*************

Some asshole created a "zeraw" directory within the root /incoming
directory on ftp.eng.ufl.edu.  For those who do not know "zeraw" is
WAREZ spelled backwords.  This is NOT a good sign--read demonews.022 if
you want to know what I mean.  The sys admin made ALL directories 
unwriteable but I changed back the demos/incoming to read/write. Could
this mean the collapse of the demo site?  Let's hope not but I think
it is only fair to warn you.  

Anyone know when "Composers contest" results will be released?  

HAVING problems uploading?  Have you tried ftp.eng.ufl.edu instead of
wasp.eng.ufl.edu or eng.ufl.edu?  I believe the "WASP" ftp site has
moved to "HORNET."  Same location just a different machine.  The
"ftp.eng.ufl.edu" should automatically route you to this new address.

I am indefinitly disabling the TOP25DL feature.  Those of you who 
subscribed to it will remain on the list but shall not receive E-mail
like in the previous weeks.

((GENERAL INFORMATION))
========================================================================

        Hi gang!  This be Snowman here, and I was really able to put
some time into my article this week.  Like the new borders?  :)

Several things of interest this week:

1. Music Contest ][ News
       There are 3 files you should all have now.
           /music/MC2/mc2rules.zip  - the rules to the competition
           /music/MC2/mc2demo.zip   - the demo made to promote MC][
           /music/MC2/mc2upd1.zip   - the update for the first month
       If you don't have them yet, GET THEM! 
    
       Due to troubles with my mailer, I was having trouble getting mass
       mails out, but I think this is now fixed.  I still can not upload
       anything, and it took several hours of work just to be able to
       get a sucessful download going.  I still can not upload, and that
       is really frustrating. Grr...

       Now that things are starting to work again, the contest will be
       coordinated better.  Remember, just write me if you want to be
       added to the mailing list.

2. 3 cool new S3Ms
       There are 3 new S3Ms that I heard this week which are worth
       noting.
         a.  Realization.S3M      by Necros/Psychic Monks
               a very different type of music, and I like it
                 /music/anecros/realize.s3m
         b.  Chariots of Fire.S3M by HMW (Kerry Ho)
               a beautiful translation by the tune from Vangelis
                 /music/ms3m/chariot.s3m
               I wrote him a letter, but he didn't respond. :(
         c.  Mysticism.S3M        by Necors/Psychic Monks
               a standard kind of tune with unstandard chords and good!
                 /music/ms3m/mystic.s3m

3. Deleting Files
       I am now deleting about as much as I am adding each week.  This
       is an equilibrium that needed to be reached to keep this site
       running efficiently.  By keeping the files fresh and current,
       you can always count on getting the best music without having to
       spending hours searching for it.

4. Cleaning /music/disks Directory
       I straightened up the /music/disks directory today.  I deleted
       some really old stuff.  If you were one of the people who made
       something I got rid of, don't get upset.  Its not that I didn't
       like them, we just don't have the room.

5. KLF Releases
       There were only 2 KLF releases these past 2 weeks.  Usually, in
       that kind of timeframe, I would have expected at least 5 or 6
       songs.  What's the deal?  You know that I delete pretty much all
       music after one month, and there are only a couple of KLF tunes
       left in /music/klf.  Could there be a secret KLF project I'm not
       aware of in the making?  :)

6. .message and .review
       Thanxs to Dan, we now have the ability to put .message files in
       our directories.  Now, whenever you go into a directory, a
       message will automatically tell you what the directory is about.
       An explanation of these is probably in this issue of DEMONEWS
       somewhere else, but I don't see the rest of the magazine until
       its released.  I myself had the idea for the .review files.  
       These will be located in some of the /music directories, and
       will rate some of the files in the directory (this is really
       needed in the /music/pplayers and /music/disks dirs).

7. New Farandole Tracker
       It is rumored that Daniel Potter (of Digital Infinity) is
       working very diligently on his Farandole (FAR) tracker.  I have
       seen an advance release and let me tell you, its much better
       than before.  Intermitent lockups plauged the tracker before
       (who wants to use a tracker that freezes randomly) but I have
       kicked this program around and its much harder to get it to
       crash.  :)  The only thing that will still reliably crash the
       system is DOS shell (but I'm SURE this will be fixed shortly).
       You might have to wait for a little while before this new
       version comes out, but I'll keep you posted.

8. My New Program
       Snowman (that's me) will be releasing a new program in the next
       couple of weeks.  It will keep track of all your internet
       addresses and is geared for the demo community.  Not a simple
       little utility, this program is robust and has lots of
       functions and pretty colors.  :)

9. DMP Gone Mad!
       DMP (Dual Module Player) has been like a good TV series for the
       past couple of years.  Every week, there is a new episode, and
       it generally gets better and better.  However, in the past two
       weeks, there have been 6 new versions of the player released!
       (DMP290.ZIP, DMP292.ZIP, DMP293.ZIP, DMP294.ZIP, DMP295.ZIP,
       and DMP32295.ZIP).  Now, if I remember correctly, Otto Chrons
       just recently finished his conscription (in the army) and is
       back at home.  This would certainly explain a lot.

       My point: I really like DMP, and I want to see at least 6 more
       versions in the next two weeks!

       Here are settings I like to use:
             dmp -q -g -n30 -a31 <filename.ext>

A. Composer's Contest #1 Results
       (no comment)

B. Does Anyone Read This?
       I really don't get that much response from my articles.  As far
       as I'm concerned, I just write these for myself to keep track of
       what is happening.  If you read these things regularly, it would
       be nice if you dropped me a line and told me what you think.


((ADDED))
========================================================================

.message files were added to all music directories
.review files should start popping up in some directories

/music/anecros  - music directory for Necros of Psychic Monks
/music/anemesis - music directory for Nemesis of iCE

NOTE: There will be NO MORE new artist directories for a little while.
      These two were long overdue, but consider adding a new artist
      directory like adding an amendment to the US Constitution (hard to
      do, and not very often).

Mellow-D/Sonic music files have been moved to the /groups/sonic dir.
