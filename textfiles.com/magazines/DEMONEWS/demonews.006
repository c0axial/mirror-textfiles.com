======================
WHAT ABOUT OTHER DEMOS
======================

Check out the WANT.LIST for demos to look for and upload.  Hopefully
someone out there is local to THE MUSIC CHANNEL BBS or THE MUSIC CONNECTION
and can up some of those demos here.

Please try not to upload stuff the site already has unless it is a newer
version that WORKS.

UPLOAD new demos to the /pub/incoming/demos DIRECTORY.

=====================
IMPORTANT INFORMATION
=====================

1) I am willing to change my RATING system of demos if people feel the current
system could be better.  See the ABOUT.DEMOS file for more information.

2) If anyone feels I should be using the old shareware version of .ZIP (V 1.1
I believe) instead of .LZH then mail me a message.  Thus far we have:  
TWO for .ZIP and ONE for .LZH.  The LHA compression program saves more space
and is slightly slower.  However, people tell me BBS's like .ZIP more--go
figure.

3) Anyone who would like to join/create a demo group but do not know where
to go let me know and I will attempt to put you in contact with others
wishing to do the same.

4) Is there any chance of someone out there attempting to get a DEMO
NEWSGROUP on the NEWSREADER?  How about trying?  They have an amiga demo
group, what about an IBM/PC demo group on the newsreader.  So, if anyone
knows the process of getting a NEW group perhaps you can help us with this. 
 
=============
ANSI TACK-ONS
=============

We now have THREE ANSI files which I can choose between to tack onto the demos
received here.  If you can draw, are an artist, or just want to do an ANSI
file then DO IT.  Grab tdraw430 or newer and make a .COM file.  If you have
something better then by all means USE it.  Send the completed file to me
or upload it to the incoming/demos directory.  Anyone who makes an ANSI file
WILL get it tacked onto a demo.  Unless of course it is REALLY bad.

All that is necessary to be in the file is the SITE address >ftp.uwp.edu<.
Draw ANYTHING--especially any cartoon, city, or odd art.  Don't worry about
having to list demo groups, my E-mail address, or demo site #1.

If anyone has a problem with me including these things with the demos
PLEASE speak-out!  I shall continue packing these things in with the demos
otherwise.  So far only one person has spoken against me including these
ANSI files.
  
==================
MIRROR SITE UPDATE
==================

OKAY, for you people around the AFRICA area check out the MIRROR at
oliver.sun.ac.za under the /pub/msdos/demos directory.

So far wuarchive.wustl.edu and ftp.ulowell.edu are out of the picture.  A
site in Finland expressed interest in mirroring this site--nic.funet.fi.
That is all there is to say for now.

=========
WHAT'S UP 
=========

-Have a Happy Thanksgiving everyone!  I'll be gone from Wed till Sun (29)
 so if anyone sends mail during that time don't expect a quick response. 

-If anyone lives in the following CITIES pleas E-mail me:  Dallas,
 Hartfort, Gainesville, or Fort Lauderdale.  Thanks.

-type "ls -ld" for the dates the files were uploaded.
