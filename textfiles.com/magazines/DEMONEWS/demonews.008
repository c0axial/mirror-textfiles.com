INCOMING
========

--Balmania = A older two screen demo with fun music and an unique scroll.
--Dineout  = A intro for Zax's (TPC) BBS.  Very short with no music.

===================
SOON TO BE RELEASED
===================

Who is doing what and when is what I want to know.  I talked to a few demo
coders and found out the following:

  -The Square will be releasing an X-mas demo but won't attend THE PARTY.
  -The Phoney Coders will also release an X-mas demo.                
  -DEA said it was releasing a demo for THE PARTY.  However, the land down-
   under is far from DENMARK.  Perhaps Lohmann will help them out.
  -Twilight Zone will be attending THE PARTY and have a "funny" demo.
  -The group I'm in will probably release a demo in January pending we
   get someone to do some music.  Perhaps Adam Ant will prevail.

I anticipate Future Crew, The Code Blasters, and Ultraforce will
attend THE PARTY.  Perhaps DCE, CASCADE, TRITON, and the SPACEPIGS will also
be there.  I expect Ultraforce to take the GOLD with their "Pandora's Box"
demo if released.  Certainly excellent demos shall be released.  All of which
will hopefully make there way here (ftp.uwp.edu) or to wasp.eng.ufl.edu in
the INCOMING dir.  I maintain the wasp site (my account) so I hope to find
some demos there for quicker D/L time (INSTANT--for me).

===========
SOURCE CODE 
===========

Upload source code and utilities to the /pub/incoming/demos directory and
we will make sure it gets moved over to the source.code dir.  This directory
will hold files to help make demo coding easier.  There is currently a
sprite editor, many ASS/C programs, a music editor that likes to crash, and
a couple routines that will allow your program to play MOD/STM files.

======================
WHAT ABOUT OTHER DEMOS
======================

Where are all the new demos?  If not new demos then what about old demos?
Anybody out there local to the MUSIC CONNECTION or the MUSIC CHANNEL BBS?

MUSIC CONNECTION (Dallas, TX) = 1-214-596-2827
MUSIC CHANNEL (Hartford, CT)  = 1-203-646-3058 

Be sure to UPLOAD new demos to the /pub/incoming/demos DIRECTORY.
(or /pub/msdos/demos/INCOMING DIRECTORY on the wasp.eng.ufl.edu site)
Please try to include a short text file on what it is.
(Remember that files in the incoming directory usually have yet to be scanned
so be careful.)

=====================
IMPORTANT INFORMATION
=====================

1) The RATING system was changed.  Check out the ABOUT.DEMOS file

2) The demos will continue to be compressed with .LZH using LHA213.EXE

3) Anyone who would like to join/create a demo group but do not know where
   to go let me know and I will attempt to put you in contact with others
   wishing to do the same.

4) Is there any chance of someone out there attempting to get a DEMO
   NEWSGROUP on the NEWSREADER?  How about trying?  They have an amiga demo
   group, what about an IBM/PC demo group on the newsreader.  I have a whole
   article on how to GET a NEWSGROUP on the NEWSREADER.  Anyone got the time?
 
=============
ANSI TACK-ONS
=============

Silence is deadly!  Silence is worse than a NO.  Is there anyone out there
willing to make a ANSI tack ON?  "Death comes silently" you know. :^)

==================
MIRROR SITE UPDATE
==================

This site is mirrored at the following places:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
oliver.sun.ac.za     - /pub/msdos/demos (in South Africa)
wasp.eng.ufl.edu     - /pub/msdos/demos (in USA--FAST)

The WASP directory also has an INCOMING dir within the demos directory.

========
I GOOFED
========

Of all the possible things a group could do in their demo including a hidden
file ranks among the top of my "don't do" list.  The SPACE PIGS did this in
their MEGADEMO.  When I compressed it guess what?  The hidden file did not
seem to be included.  How about that?  So, could someone with the "original"
MEGADEMO please RE-UPLOAD it or UPLOAD just the hidden file.  The MEGADEMO
on this site will most likely not work without it.

=========
WHAT'S UP 
=========

-All the TEXT files have been updated as of DEC 17 and DEC 18.

-I shall be on vacation from Dec 19 till Jan 4.

-If anyone lives in the following CITIES please E-mail me:  Dallas,
 Hartfort, Gainesville, Youngstown, or Fort Lauderdale. 

-type "ls -ld" for the dates the files were uploaded (ftp.uwp.edu only).
