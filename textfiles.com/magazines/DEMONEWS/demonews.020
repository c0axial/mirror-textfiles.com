CHANGES
!!!!!!!

A proposed change is to make a /util(ities) directory instead of placing
all the CODE and utilities (mod players,intromakers) into the /source
directory.  What do people think of this idea?  -->dmw@sioux.ee.ufl.edu

CLOSING COMMENTS
================

--Gopher?  ftp.uwp.edu can be ACCESSED world wide via the GOPHER system
  which many universities have on their LIBRARY computers.  Of course
  getting the files via gopher did not look possible.  Welp, just another
  one of those "look, don't touch" things.

--No quote this week.
