((Section 1...Standard Info))
==============================================================================
    DemoNews is a weekly publication dedicated to the demo scene.  It is
produced at the Internet FTP site ftp.eng.ufl.edu (aka WASP or HORNET).  
This newsletter focuses on all aspects of demos and demo-making  (including 
music, art, and coding).

There are currently four active demo-operators at this site:
     
     Dan Wright (Pallbearer)       - GENERAL - dmw@eng.ufl.edu
     Christopher G. Mann (Snowman) - MUSIC   - r3cgm@dax.cc.uakron.edu
     Mike                          - GENERAL - weis@elf.stuba.sk
     Jason (Cavalier)              - ANSI    -  cavalier@shadow.net

    This site is mirrored by the following ftps:
         ftp.uwp.edu
         ftp.luth.se  --> DOWN lately due to hard drive problem.
         ftp.sun.ac.za
         ftp.uni-erlangen.de
         ftp.uni-paderborn.de
         ftp.cdrom.com

Here are some thoughts on our lack of space:

        -We don't have enough of it
        -Even if we deleted ALL ansi, it would only free up 26 Megs
        -We have a HUGE >20 Meg old version of Emacs off of our root
                directory that we can't get rid of
        -Programming source takes up very little, so we can have more
        -Music disks take up WAY too much space, so we will have less

You've heard us bitch and bitch about how we don't have enough space.  Well,
the above statistics should explain.

I have found that ftp.uwp.edu does an excellent job of mirroring our site,
so if you want a file that was on here 3 months ago, chances are good that
they will have it.  In addition, I get a faster transfer rate from this site.
My suggestion to you is: if the file you want can be found on ftp.uwp.edu,
then hop on there and get it.  This also will make hornet a bit faster, as
not so many people will be online.

In summary, unless Hornet gets more space online, we will become a CURRENT
site of demos/music/code/ansi as opposed to a STOREHOUSE of all files.


SPACE

We will probably delete some older demos to help reduce our space problems.
If you are interested in older demos I recommend getting some before they
get deleted in the coming weeks without notice.  Of course BBS's and
the ftp.mpoli.fi site may carry what we delete so all is not lost.

((Section 4...Music Articles by Snowman))
==============================================================================
(GENERAL)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is a new tracker out this week.  It is called Dynamic Studio 
Professional, and makes DSM files.  I havn't downloaded this yet, but it might
be worth checking out.  I belive it only uses GUS, and you can find it under
/music/trackers/dynamic.arj.  There are also a couple of songs in .dsm format
which can be found under /music/songs/dsm.  Let me know what you think of it
and I'll post it here next issue.

Nothing else for now.

==============================================================================
((Section 5...Code Articles by Snowman))
==============================================================================
(GENERAL)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The /code directory is slowly being reorganized.

With music, you have files like MOD, S3M, MTM, etc.  The same goes for code,
where you have files like ASM, PAS, C, etc.  Include what language your source
code is in the description.  This will make things easier for people who want
to download your file.

==============================================================================
((Section 6...ESCAPE Demo/Music CD))
==============================================================================

Check /pub/msdos/demos/incoming/democd for UPDATES and information.
Snowman:

Well, my responsibility for the Escape CD is almost done.  I have finished
the recording of the audio portion, and I am sort of working on the Art.  The
rest of the workload falls on the shoulders of Dan Wright.  Dan has been doing
a ton of work on this project, and I think he deserves a letter or two of
appreciation.  You can write him at dmw@inca.gate.net.

Dan:

I updated the files in this (/democd) directory.  The file "dirlist.txt"
contains all the demos/music/etc that will appear as DATA on the CD.  
CDINFO.TXT is now up to date and should answer most of the questions
you may feel like asking.

The final CD shall contain 232 Megs of DATA, 12 Songs (9 from MC][), and
a full color insert/backliner in a "jewel" case.  The absolute price has
not been set at this time.  When I send out my final checks for the CD
pressing and ART I will be able to tabulate the EXACT cost.  Keep the
figure of $10-$13 in mind...which is the range originally predicted.
