 :: "Introduction"
 :: Snowman / Hornet
 :: r3cgm@ftp.cdrom.com

 _____Personal

 He ambles up to the stage...

 <cough ugkum> He awkwardly reaches for the microphone. "Hello all."

 "Hello!", the warm crowd tries to reach out.

 <cough> "Umm... my name is Snowman and... I am a perfectionist.  I'm afraid
 to release anything for fear of making errors."

 A few are shocked and inhale sharply.  The crowd is ice rigid.  Then
 suddenly, as if heating blankets fell from the sky, a few mumble warm
 nothings and giggle.  Up starts a buzz and hearty laugher.

 On stage, the speaker is a pinnacle of rock.  Unmoving... shocked.

 An outspoken lad in the front row clears it up.  "We don't care!  Make
 mistakes!"

 Hello all, and welcome to DemoNews issue 125.

 I finally realized that I was having a problem a couple of weeks ago.  I sat
 down to write a little mini-report about NAID.  The first 3 paragraphs took
 about an hour to write and it went downhill from there.  Two screenfulls
 later, I chucked the article... dissatisfied.

 Even as I sit here now, I am ever so tempted to delete this introduction and
 start over.  After all, it's kind of stupid, right?  People want to read good
 quality scene articles and not about revelations from the editor.  Cut to the
 chase, show the files, print the articles, whip up a few wordy sentences and
 be done with the intro.  Simple, right?

 To make a long story short, I'm gonna make mistakes (it's an organic thing).
 I've reconciled most outstanding differences with the gods of perfectionism
 and resolved to resume normal duties as DemoNews editor, flawed as they may
 often times seem to be.  So to everyone; peace, love, and all that shit.

 On with the show.

 _____HA4

 If you read DemoNews, you probably use our archive.  After all, that's the
 primary purpose of it.  Give to the masses new file listings each week (a
 snicker from the back of the room, "Each _week_!? hahaha").  Anyway, we made
 massive improvements to our archive these past two weeks.

 HA4 = 4th major revision of the Hornet Archive maintenance system.  You've
 heard me hint at it for a long time.  After months of planning and
 preparation, it is now a reality.

 "That's nice.  Archive maintenance system.  Who cares?"

 "You do!"

 "Surely you don't mean me?  All I do is hop on ftp.cdrom.com every once in a
 while and grab some of the new files I saw in DemoNews or whatever looks cool
 in /incoming."

 "The archive loves you."

 "What?"

 Ladies and gentlemen, I am proud to announce HA4.  Two and a half weeks ago
 I finally started coding it.  6 days ago the first file was officially
 cataloged.  Just for the record, I believe it was /alpha/1987/rax.lzh.

 Here are some features this new system offers:

   1. Online search engine.

   You wanted hypertext links to all songs written by Necros?  A
   DemoNews-style listing of 64k intros from Assembly 1993 and 1994 that
   placed 3rd or higher?  A page of all demos that got **** or better in the
   past two weeks?  You want a /group directory on our site?  Too late... you
   already have one.

   2. Party links and info.

   A party database is being constructed.  All index.html files on our site
   that have a file with a party marker (ASM95:, NAID96:, etc.) will be
   linked _directly_ to the appropriate /party directory on our site.  Say
   you can't figure out what MEK95 stood for?  Say you want a list of all
   files that competed at /party/1996/SAT96?  Say no more.

   3. Lng. Desc.

   File descriptions now have no maximum length.  Authors, groups, and titles
   in the past were often abbreviated to fit within a one-line 00_index.txt
   entry constraint.  No more.  /code can actually have _descriptions_. People
   who choose insanely long handles can now be accommodated.  Most files in
   /alpha/1994 and before had a paragraph of information that went along with
   them.  This information will now be brought back to the 00_index.txt files.

   4. Get the hell out of /incoming!

   The process of reviewing, describing, and moving files on our site has been
   tremendously tweaked (TT).  This TT system will dramatically improve the
   frightening delay between uploading and processing.  It is a personal goal
   of mine to see Diablo handle over 20 music reviewers by the end of this
   year.

   5. Intelligent archive.

   "Snowman, I've been looking through the /graphics directory and found two
   files that didn't have any description."

   "So why are you telling me?  Mail GD."

   "I tried... can't get a DNS lookup.  Could you please handle this
   yourself?"

   "Fine.  I'll get it.  BTW: You're pretty cool for a Perl script."

   "Hey $username, you're not so bad yourself!"

   "DOH!"

 Archive users, some cool stuff is ahead.

 _____Music Contest 4

 Wanna enter?  Better get your butt in gear!  The entry registration deadline
 has already passed but we'll still let you sneak in if you're quiet.  Contact
 gd@ftp.cdrom.com immediately if you have any questions.

 _____Random Things

 Kiwidog's address has changed from kiwidog@vt.edu to
 chargrove@mail.ravensoft.com.

 Who videotaped the Necros/Basehead seminar at NAID this year?  We want
 footage for the NAID CD (which is coming out in about 1.5 months).

 _____Conclusion

 It's good to be back.
 This tired old hack
 has still got some keys to depress.

 To one I say "hi",
 and boy does he cry!
 (My numlock is under much stress.)

 All lymrics aside,
 I'll no longer hide
 behind a perfectionist mask.

 But err and be wrong?
 Misspell a new song?
 I'm human.  What more could you ask?

 Some things that we write
 (at four in the night),
 might later seem flawed or contrived.

 I'll think not of that
 cause listserver-fat
 means DN five cubed has arrived!

 :: "NAID Log - Part 1/3"
 :: Trixter / Hornet
 :: trixter@ftp.cdrom.com

 The following is a log of the events and thoughts of my trip to and from NAID
 96, which I'm recording for several reasons; two of which are posterity and
 for the benefit of those who couldn't make it to NAID.  I hope you enjoy
 reading it.  If you wanted to know what NAID was like, or what being a member
 of Hornet amongst demo freaks is like, maybe this log will help you.

 (Only handles will be used in this memento.  If you want to know what
 someone's real name is, email me at trixter@mcs.com or
 jleonard@condor.depaul.edu.  Also, some swearing is used, so if you don't
 like swearing, don't read further.)

 Some background for people not familiar with my life and previous demo scene
 experience: I'm Trixter of Hornet, and my real name is Jim Leonard.  I live
 in Chicago.  I'm 24.  I'm married, and my wife and I have a baby due January
 25th.  This is _not_ a typical demo scene person; usually, the typical
 'scener is from 16 to 19, lives in Europe, and is single.  Well, I started
 coding BBS intros in 1991, but saw my first demo (SpacePig's EGA Megademo) in
 1990.  So, I guess I've been in the demo scene since 1990.  Maybe that's why
 I'm so old and goofy.  :)

 I've been to NAID before, but it was my first compo, and I lost myself in the
 whole amazement of the thing.  It was a whirlwind of computer freaks just
 like myself, and I was so overwhelmed I forgot a lot of the finer points.

 Not this time--I typed up this log during and after the party (NAID 1996) and
 I'm damn glad I did, although since I am editing this file after the party, I
 will probably flip between past and present tense slightly.  :-)  Also, the
 only song I've listened to during the entire creation/editing of this log was
 Dizzy/CNCD's "CNCD_P3.MOD" (cncd party3 slide) tune.  After about 6 hours of
 listening to this thing loop, it is still one of my top 5 favorite tunes.
 Listen to it as you read this if you want to get closer to my current mental
 state.

 _____May 27th

 I pick up Snowman / Hornet from the airport with my wife Melissa, and the
 three of us go to Checkers, a local drive-through fast food joint.  We talk
 about the demo and many other things, most of which I can't remember at this
 point.  Sleep comes early.

 _____May 28th

 Work on the demo progresses.  Phred and I have been working on this for at
 least four months, but it almost doesn't matter if I can't add enough effects
 to extend the demo past 4 minutes.  Both Phred and Stony have come through,
 however, with the graphics (Stony) and two parts for the demo (Phred, the
 "Phish" and "Transparency" parts.)  I integrate them into the demo fairly
 easily, with no compilation or linking problems.  Unfortunately, we're over
 the size limit by about 200K.  Some palette quantization/combining is in
 order, and Snowman and I get it down to about 70K under the limit.  I hope
 they count by bytes and not the space used up by clusters.  :-)

 _____May 29th

 Snowman and I pack up the car with my computer and all our gear, which makes
 me a bit nervous, and head for GD's house.  The demo is a bit unfinished, but
 it's just about at the point where I could enter it into the compo and not
 cringe in embarrassment.  I'll just have to finish it when I get to NAID.
 Snowman and I talk on the way to GD / Hornet's house about what to expect at
 NAID.  I have no idea what to expect, other than the fact that if DCB (Da
 Cheeze Brigade) competes this year, Craw Productions and I will have a run
 for our money.  I believe my exact comment on that subject was "DCB is going
 to wipe up the floor with my ass this year."  :-)

 Along the 12-hour trip to Syracuse, New York, we take two wrong turns, first
 splitting off of 90 onto 80 ("No problem, we'll just keep going west."), then
 from 80 to 76 ("Pennsylvania?  Uh oh.").  The end result is that we waste
 four hours traveling straight north to get back onto 90 again.  At least we
 didn't run out of gas like we did last year; we talked so heavily about the
 finer points of Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat that I didn't look at the
 gas indicator for over an hour, and we just rolled to a stop.  We were
 incredibly lucky that year--we stopped about a mile away from a gas station.
 In the middle of nowhere.  _Very_ lucky indeed.

 _____May 30th

 After sleeping at GD's house and packing his stuff, all three of us take to
 the road.  We arrive in Montreal and pass through it like veterans, having
 prepared sufficiently this year.  Unfortunately, the map we were using wasn't
 detailed enough, and we got lost in Boucherville.  We wound up at a Ford
 dealership and asked for directions, which got us to the CEGEP just as Struk
 and Mr. Khan were leaving.  (These NAID trips seem to bless us with the gift
 of luck and good timing).

 We park after talking to the parking attendant in broken French and English,
 asking him where we should park (and how much the fee was) if we were to
 attend NAID.  (Afterwards, Mr. Khan explains that almost everyone in Quebec
 under the age of 40 speaks at least _some_ English, for many reasons --
 Friends, X-Files, and ER being a few.  :-)

 We split up and meet at Struk's house, where we all have a nice conversation
 about what to expect this year, the pending excitement, who gets to do the
 NAID report, and so on.  One of the more interesting conversations is how
 they got the first one going--it was initially going to be a small school
 project for a class that just grew and grew from about 30 people expected to
 attend, to over 700!

 Struk also explains a lot of the work that goes into NAID.  I had no idea
 that it takes about 8 months of planning, a ton of money, sponsors to supply
 the money, and over 100 volunteers!  I want to ask him why they volunteer,
 but I forget; I hope I learn later what their motivation was.

 After some Chinese food, Struk sets up his Dolby Pro-Logic Surround Sound
 decoder, puts some surround-sound speakers on the back wall, and blasts
 Jurassic Park.  _Quite_ cool.  GD has never seen the movie before, which is
 probably an indication that he should get off of IRC more often.  ;-)  The
 sound is just fantastic; I am mesmerized the entire time.

 :: "A Graphician's Tip Book - Part 3"
 :: Shaithis / Psychic Monks, Immortal Coil
 :: shaithis@dreamscape.com

 I can't list any bug-fixes in this article because the issue preceding this
 one has yet to go out at the time I'm sitting here writing.  At any rate,
 I've decided I'll have a one issue delay.  For example, an error is pointed
 out to me from article 2.  I'll point it out for all of you in article 4.
 Same thing goes for tips.  If you send me a tip right after article say, 6,
 comes out, it won't be in until article 8.

 Enough on that, let's get to the main point of this article:

 _____DeluxePaint IIe

 DeluxePaint (which will forever after be called "Dpaint"), is old.  I'll not
 lie to you.  It's an old program.  However, it is also still the best 256
 color drawing program I've seen (Perhaps some 32-bit apps are better even in
 256 color mode, but they don't count, because they can draw in more colors).
 Dpaint has a variety of commands, shortcuts, and secrets.  Today we'll be
 focusing on the basic commands.  Next issue will deal with more involved
 commands, and the issue following that will handle the shortcuts and secrets
 (Not quite tricky enough to be "tips -n- tricks").

 _____Tools

 Dpaint offers a variety of drawing tools.  At this point, I'm going to assume
 that those reading this have at least opened up a drawing program before and
 therefore don't need to have the basic tools explained to them.  Dpaint's
 basic tools include: the pencil, the line, the curved line, the circle, the
 square, the fill bucket, the ruled fill tool, the freehand fill tool, the
 eyedropper, the hand, the undo button, the highlight tool, and the spraypaint
 can.

 Dpaint's other tools are the font tool, the CAR tool, the 3d tool, the
 pattern tool, the gradient tool, and the rose tool.  These tools are grouped
 in this section because they are either too advanced to fall in the basic
 tools section, or are native to Dpaint.  For example, I have yet to see the
 rose tool in any other paint program.  It is these tools we will discuss
 today.

 _____The Font Tool

 Similar to the font tools in most other art applications, it allows you to
 bring up one of Dpaint's predefined fonts and write with it.  However,
 because Dpaint is an older program, the font tool has many limitations.  You
 cannot use standard True-type fonts.  You must use the fonts that are already
 included in Dpaint.  There are probably ways to create your own but I have
 not been able to discover them.  You must also realize that, due to Dpaint's
 lack of layers, you have only one chance to undo a font.

 If you put it down, colorize it, and then decided you don't like it, too bad,
 'cause it's there for good.  (Unless you saved before adding the font, which
 brings up a quick point...SAVE! Save whenever you make any significant
 changes to your work.  Trust me, someday you'll be happy you did).

 _____The CAR Tool

 CAR stands for Constrained Aspect Ratio.  This means that when you have the
 CAR tool on, your spheroids will always be circles and your rectangles will
 always be squares (or as close as possible, due to the fact that in some
 resolutions, at some sizes, it is not possible to for Dpaint to achieve a
 perfect circle).  This is a tool I rarely use as I have been working with the
 program for so long that, in relatively low res, I can pretty much eyeball my
 circles and squares.

 However, for a novice, the C-AR tool is extremely useful, and I recommend
 toying with it to help obtain the ability _not_ to use it. :)

 _____The 3d Tool

 The 3d tool allows you to take a flat object and manipulate it along the x,
 y, and z planes.  In common english, it allows you to change your view of the
 object.  Take a piece of paper and hold it flat in front of you.  You'll see
 a long, wide white section.  Now turn it in space until it becomes nothing
 more than a thin white line.  This is the essence of the 3d tool.  It allows
 you to turn, rotate, and move your objects on a 3d plane.

 _____The Pattern Tool

 This tool is found in quite a few other paint programs.  It simply allows you
 to paint or fill using a pattern as opposed to a single color.  Common
 patterns include patchwork, bricks, dots, etc.  This is a fun tool to play
 with, and at times can be useful, but most experienced artists rarely touch
 it.

 _____The Gradient Command

 The most powerful, useful, misused, and overused tool in Dpaint.  This
 command simply takes an initial color of the pallette, and ending color, and
 alters whatever colors fall between them to create as smooth a blend as
 possible.  For example, if you set the 33rd palette color as red, and the
 64th as black, and used the `spread' command, Dpaint will take up palette
 colors 34-63 blending the two.  This is a gradient.  These can then be linked
 to create multiple gradients.

 _____Conclusion

 Well, that brings me to my word limit. :)  I'll finish up with gradients and
 the rose tool at the start of the next column, and then move onto commands
 like translucent, smooth, shade, smear, etc. (as well as tell you how to
 ensure that these effects work at their absolute best).  I have a sneaking
 suspicion this Dpaint section is going to run into 4 articles, instead of the
 initially planned three, but please bear with me.  I'm new to journalism. :)
 Until next time.
