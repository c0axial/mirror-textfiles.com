((Section 1...Standard Info))
==============================================================================
    DemoNews is a weekly publication dedicated to the demo scene.  It is
produced at the Internet FTP site ftp.eng.ufl.edu (aka WASP or HORNET).  
This newsletter focuses on all aspects of demos and demo-making  (including 
music, art, and coding).

There are currently three active demo-operators at this site:
     
     Dan Wright (Pallbearer)       - GENERAL - dmw@eng.ufl.edu
     Christopher G. Mann (Snowman) - MUSIC   - r3cgm@dax.cc.uakron.edu
     Mike                          - GENERAL - weis@elf.stuba.sk
     Jason (Cavalier)              - ANSI    -  cavalier@shadow.net

    This site is mirrored by the following ftps:
         ftp.uwp.edu
         ftp.luth.se
         ftp.sun.ac.za
         ftp.uni-erlangen.de
         ftp.uni-paderborn.de
         ftp.cdrom.com

If you would like to receive a new copy of Demo News every Sunday in your
mailbox write to dmw@eng.ufl.edu.  We delete all bounced mail from this
service, so if you SHOULD BE getting Demo News and ARE NOT, please re-request
this newsletter.

((Section 2...General))
==============================================================================

SPACE

We deleted some ANSI and MUSIC stuff to allow for uploads.  This puts us
back over 20 Megs...for now.

Other DEMO ftp sites:

ftp.mpoli.fi is "starport" and has a lot of demos not here--and it will
stay that way because we do not have the space for them.  Starport is
mirrored by ftp.funet.fi which is maintained by Abyss of the Future Crew.
So, if you the demo you are looking for is not here then CHECK the
above sites.

OTHER ASM 94 releases (Hope you have a Gravis):
/pub/msdos/demos/alpha/NEW/asm94/demos

Fairy Tale -- Interesting demo with "plot."  Requires Mathco.  Great idea.
The Final Option -- If you do not have this GET IT NOW.  This Phantom 
                    Dezign demo is one of the best I have seen. Like a movie!
Images -- Epical's demo is out...placed 5th.
Volbyval -- Valhalla's Vision of Light demo.
Themo -- DEMONIC placed last with this demo.  :)
Warp  -- Legend design's 4th place demo.
Accident -- Axidental.  From CANADA.

There are a few more--some may not be at wasp (check mpoli.fi /pub/starport/
asm/demo)--worth checking out.  I am impressed.

(GENERAL)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        All artists directories will be deleted in the next week.  This is
due, once again, to lack of storage space on this site.  If you want to grab
the songs, DO SO NOW!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MUSIC CONTEST 2 UPDATE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Today or tomorrow, all of the voting forms will be sent to the judges.
If your entry is lying around some BBS and has not been uploaded to this site,
you are probably out of luck.  I gave all of the sysops adequate warning to
get the songs up here.  By the time this issue of Demonews is sent out, it
will be too late to upload any more entries.
        I also finished the statistics generator for the entries.  I now know
the percentage distribution of format and countries of entrants.  Very inter-
esting.
        Because of all the time I have put into this contest recently, things
are going surprisingly well.  I do not feel like I am running behind, and
everything looks to be going according to schedule (as in mc2upd3.txt).
        If you are a judge, expect mail from me soon.

COMPOSER'S COMPETITION (a message from Mike Phillips)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Christopher,

    (You may distribute this if you like)

   I am having a very "Very" hard time collecting the voting forms from 
  certain people that are judges. I will not mention names here but I will 
  say this, What I am gonna do is compile what I have now and get this 
  thing closed out, I really hated having all the users wait on this as 
  long as they have and REALLY REALLY appreciate your support in the  
  suggestion of taking the entries into MC][ I will though compile the 
  voting forms I have now and come up with a winner. I will if its ok with 
  you announce and handle the advertising of Composers Compo I through MC][ 
  if that is fine with you. if you have any questions at all about this 
  please contact me voice. (Call collect if you like)

   Thanks and best regards,

    Mike Phillips

[Message from Snowman]

        Good news!  I have found a DAT machine.  After the MC][ results have
been released, I needed to transfer the winners onto DAT so that they could
be transfered to the Escape Demo/CD.  This week, I made arrangements with
the University of Akron to use their DAT for a day.

ART

We could still use some ART.  Get back to me if interested--dmw@eng.ufl.edu.

IN CASE YOU MISSED IT the FIRST and SECOND and nth TIME here is the

    September 10, 1994
    
    Dear Demo group/enthusiast:
    
    I am trying to distribute this "letter/press release" as far and
    wide as I can via the internet/demo mags and a few postal letters. 
    There are a few demo groups I have yet to reach (Diffusion, Symptom,
    Progrex, Synergy Designs, Diffusion PC, Arkham, Binary Poets, PCI,
    Access Denied, Ultraforce, and Xography among others) and would
    appreciate it if you (the reader) could post this on a BBS and/or
    show members of the above groups this letter.  The more this gets
    around the better; especially for those who may have objections
    with their demo appearing on this CD.  Please read carefully, don't
    jump to conclusions (this is not a profit project) and if you have any
    questions let me know.
    
    TO THE POINT
    
    I am creating a DEMO CD-ROM and would like your permission to
    include any and/or all of your productions on this CD.
    
    SNOWMAN AND THE PROJECT
    
    Snowman (Chris) and I are collaborating on this CD project.  Snowman
    is the organizer of the Music Contest ][ (MC][) and will be taking
    care of the Digital Audio portion of this CD.  I am a maintainer of
    the internet demo site (ftp.eng.ufl.edu) and will be gathering all
    the demos for the CD ROM portion as well as funding all or most of
    the project.  
    
    SPECIFIC INFORMATION  
    
    The Digital Audio (or "Red Book audio" = 44.1kHz) portion of the CD
    will consist mainly of songs entered in Snowman's MC][ contest.  I
    highly recommend musicians/composers as individuals or groups to
    enter.  If you do not want to enter MC][ but feel you have a great
    contribution (composed whenever and for whatever) then certainly
    submit that (to Snowman or me) because THERE WILL be some space for
    non MC][ music--anywhere from one to seven songs will be non MC][
    related.  We anticipate having 40-50 minutes (i.e. 450 megs) worth
    of CD music (10-15 songs) mastered using a Gravis Ultrasound (unless
    someone recommends/donates something better) and DAT recorder.  
    
    The data portion of this disk will consist of MC][ related material,
    demos, and possible other demo related items (i.e. music disks, disk
    mags, source code).  I anticipate everything taking up about 200MB
    of compressed space.  Currently I have 170+ MB of stuff to include.
    
    WHEN AND HOW MUCH  
    
    Due to MC][ ending late August we will not be able to release this
    CD till mid October.  Our plans at the present time are to have
    200-300 of these CD's pressed and sell them for approximately $13
    ppd. for people in the US and $15 to people elsewhere (the final
    price depends on the overall cost but these estimated figures will
    be pretty close).
    
    The reason for the small pressing is twofold:  1) We do not know the
    demand and 2) We do not have the funds to press more.  If interested
    in helping with distributing/funding then contact us so we can
    increase our run and decrease our price.  Just so you know we are
    not doing this project to make a profit or exploit any
    person/group--that has already been done.  The CD cost formula goes
    something like this:  
    
    CD COST = AT cost CD manufacturing + misc. + postage.  
    
    For people who buy a lot (i.e. distributors) we will knock off the
    "misc." charge but require you to not mark up the CD more than 10%.
    Remember that the idea of this project is to create a unique product
    available to the masses, not to line ANYONE'S pocket.  As a bonus,
    if any of your productions (group or individual) appears within the
    disk we will give you a 5% discount.  Keep in mind that due to our
    low price we can NOT offer FREE CD's.  (i.e. Please don't tell me
    "You have  permission to use our production if you send us X CD's.") 
    
    
    ORDERING  
    
    Thirteen bucks gets you get a quality CD in a jewel box with 40
    minutes of Digital Audio you can play on your regular CD player and
    200 megs of demos. Want one?  You may want to reserve a copy by
    contacting me (info listed above) and providing me with a way to
    reach you when the CD comes out.  About 140 copies have been
    reserved thus far--if you even THINK you might want a copy I 
    HIGHLY recommend reserving one ( I will not hold you to the 
    reservation if you change your mind. ).  Max pressing = 300 with
    NO repressing planned!
    
    ANYTHING ELSE WE SHOULD KNOW
    
    If interested you ...
    may submit a TEXT file to me about your group/demo/whatever and I
    will include it on the CD.  There is no deadline for submitting
    demos or TEXT but the sooner you get it to me the better--I prefer
    to have it by Sept 24th.
    
    FINALLY,  I do not expect to hear from everybody I send this to and
    will be surprised if I heard from half the people who see this. On
    that note if I do not hear from you I understand that it is okay to
    include your "freeware" demo production meant for "mass
    distribution" on this CD I have been talking about. Be sure your
    friends and other demo groups see this so it gets widely
    distributed.  This CD will be a winner if we have actual
    contributions from the scene--music, art, stories,
    comments/suggestions, etc. so be sure to contact us.  
    
    Out there,  
    Dan Wright 
    Pallbearer/Toxic Zombies

-> If you seek a questionaire E-mail me and I will be happy to send
   your group one.  Only 10 or so have been filled out.

This newsletter is sent out at 00:30 Sunday to over 390 people.  We get
about 2-20 letters a week asking to be added to the list which get added
by hand.  So, if you do not receive this after "subscribing" then I
probably typed your address in wrong and you may need to re-subscribe.
If I get a bounce to your mail address I will probably delete you from
the list.
