    DemoNews is a weekly publication dedicated to the demo scene.  It is
produced at the Internet FTP site ftp.eng.ufl.edu (aka WASP or HORNET).  
This newsletter focuses on all aspects of demos and demo-making  (including 
music, art, and coding).

There are currently four active demo-operators at this site:
     
     Dan Wright (Pallbearer)       - GENERAL - dmw@eng.ufl.edu
     Christopher G. Mann (Snowman) - GENERAL - r3cgm@dax.cc.uakron.edu

(GENERAL)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There were not many uploads this week.  :(

Next week, no-ryan.zip and no-cc.zip will be deleted.  These are the tunes
from Renaissance's music disk Nothing On, and they are very good.  I suggest
you download them now before they are gone.

I wrote a hell of a lot of material for this issue of Demonews.  Rather than
skimming and deleting it because there is so much, I suggest you save it and
read it a little bit at a time.

Here's a rather odd letter I recently received:

Snowman : Tue Oct  4 21:35:33 1994

  I was lurking through a ftp site down in florida earlier tonight when I saw
  that's it's operator's name was "Snowman".

  By coincedence my handle also happens to be "Snowman". I've written to find
  out when you adopted the name "Snowman", for if you chose the name before me
  then I cannot with good conscience continue going by that title.

  If I chose the name first then I have no problems living on the Net with
  another Snowman. (I would never dream of demanding anyone to change their
  name).

  I decided to change my handle to Snowman during in March of 1993. I would be
  gratefull if you can inform me as to the date you changed your
  name. Thanks in advance.

[Back to Snowman (Christopher G. Mann)]

Just for the record, I chose my handle in February of 1992, when I first log-
ged on Canton Connection BBS.  I had absolutely reason for chosing that
specific name.  At the "Handle: " prompt, I had to type something, so I just
thought Snowman was as good a name as any.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(MOD4WIN 2.10)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

!What a player!

I first downloaded MOD4WIN a couple of months ago and was very impressed.  I
don't like Windoze, but this player was enough to keep me in the straight-
jacket-GUI for a while.  My shareware expiration came and I couldn't use the
program any more.  I stopped using Windoze.

Recently one of the authors of MOD4WIN wrote me and asked if I'd like a
registered version of the program.  I said sure, and last week I got it in the
mail.  This may seem like a small thing, but the label on the disk was very
nice and it set me up for the professional level of this player.

I tested MOD4WIN out of a couple of my own tunes and it handled them wonder-
fully.  It uses whatever sound drivers you currently have installed in Windows
so both GUS and SB users should be happy.  It handles MOD, S3M, MTM, 669, with
more formats being supported soon.  The sound output is excellent, and MOD4WIN
can play songs back at 44.1, in stereo, 16-bit, and in Q-Sound.  There is also
a read-ahead buffer so that the song doesn't jump everytime a new window or
application is being opened.

The authors have done his homework to provide this level of excellence.  I
believe that they deserve a lot of credit for putting this thing together.
You can find the shareware version of MOD4WIN at :

  /music/programs/players/m4w210sx.zip & m4w210sx.txt

(DYNAMIC STUDIO)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[VLad DRacl writes...]

     Well, I just downloaded the Dynamic Tracker, and I must say I like it a
  LOT...  255 instrument limit, 16 channels, sample editing, MIDI
  capabilities, CD-Player and more.  Plus, a nice looking interface...
     Though it's quite mouse-driven, there's also keyboard commands for most
  of it, which makes it nice.  The interface reminds me of something...
  (amiga)  Can't quit place it... (amiga)  I think I've seen it before...
  (amiga)  I think the (amiga) interface of it is one of the slickest
  (amiga) GUI/text type thingies I've seen... :)
     Sound quality is good, plenty of effects, looks nice...  I (would) give
  this tracker 2 thumbs up if it weren't for the STRICT crippling of the
  program (no saves, no CD play, some other stuff)... Plus, for $55, it
  isn't exactly going to be the demo-musician's first choice.  :(  Not only
  that, but the first method of payment they suggest is *CASH*...  Hmmm....
     Anyway, though...  I like this tracker, but there's some seriously
  badly crippled features that can't be accessed unless you send (roughly)
  $55 CASH to SWEDEN, for gawd sake!  *sigh*  Looks like I'll be sticking to
  MMEDIT for a little while longer...  :(

                -VLad DRacl-


[Back to Snowman]

I really like this tracker as well.  However, $55 is a bit out of my price
range at this point.  I was going to contact the author about the tracker,
but I couldn't find internet address in the documentation.  If you are from
ProWare Sweden, please get in contact with me.  I may be able to help you get
some registrations.

(MUSIC CONTEST ][ RESPONSE)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most of the feedback I have received concerning MC][ has been positive.  Here
are just a few of the letters I have received.

Hadji : Tue Sep 27 01:09:51 1994

  Hey Snowman...just thought i'd tell you that you put a lot of work into
  Music Contest ][, and I enjoyed it, even if I am still not satisfied with
  the song I entered ;) Haha...but in all seriousness, I'd like to see you
  get on IRC sometime too man! :) C-ya!

Ryan Cramer : Tue Sep 27 10:02:15 1994

  ...I also thought that the MC2 demo was quite awesome, I think that
  everybody is really going to be impressed how nicely the results were
  presented. MC2 really wrapped up nicely. I'm going to start my MC3 song
  now. :) I think its great that you exceeded everybody's expectations by
  producing a demo and putting everything on CD... Anyways, great work!

Krystall : Tue Sep 27 17:59:39 1994

  ...I must say that the contest was pretty well organised.  You found a way
  to make the votes fair to everybody.

  I don't have a lot of time to write you, but here are some things I found
  you could do for the next one.
  The most important thing, IMHO, would be to make the contest shorter.
  You could make it finish in the summer, like July, to be sure that the
  results are released before the school start.  It would be better for
  everyone.

Imre OLAJOS, Jr. (LaLa of TranSByte) : Thu Sep 29 01:27:18 1994

  MC2 was an excellent way to let the world know about the talented amateur
  musicians. Personally, I am very proud of my music which was ranked 6th in
  the Rookie section. I think, the quality and the quantity of the composi-
  tions was fairly high, and it was DAMN WELL-ORGANIZED !!! :)

  Just a thought for MC3: why not release all the entries to some public
  place, like the WUARCHIVE, or the official GUS FTP-site, or even the
  Usenet? There still would be dedicated judges, just like in MC2, but the
  broader public would have a chance to vote, too. For example, each indivi-
  dual would vote for the first three musics, and these votes would be
  accumulated.

  I know that technically it is very hard to implement, but it is not
  impossible. Also, how about the ever-growing WWW? It would be nice to set
  up a neat hypertext page for MC3 and have everybody free access to all the
  entries and other related infos.

Alexander Verburgt : Sat Oct  1 09:44:51 1994

        Hi Snowman,
        thanks for organising the MC ][.   I like the idea of this
        compo and it was for me a very nice experience.
        I will certainly join MC ]I[  next year !!

Jenkins of Synth Dream PC : Tue Oct  4 09:11:37 1994

  I really enjoyed participating and I am looking forward to MC]I[!
  Good things about the contest:

  * joining a contest without traveling across the world to some party place
  * strong judgement system: gives a musician really the feeling people have
    been listening to their tune instead of voting on famous names
  * detailed information available, including updates: gave me the feeling
    the contest was still alive
  * friendly organisation: incorrect uploads were not wiped immediately
  * and most important of all: a deadline, fast publishing of results and
    incredible fast sending of prizes (Ive got mine = netherlands in one week)

Clement Poon : Thu Oct 13 11:28:04 1994

  Hi!  I would just like to inform you that I got my disk ok, like you asked
  us to do.  I did expect songs instead of the MC2 files, but that's ok!

  Anyways, here's some feedback on the results for MC2:
  All us 'Calgary' musicians (me, Markell (1st), Lloyd, etc.. and other non
  musicians) thought that the results were kinda rushed and didn't really
  make much sense... But oh well, these reflect our opinions and not the
  judges, so what's final is final.  Oh well, it was a good contest anyways.
  So I still look forward to MC ]I[.

  Oh, BTW, I know that this was a BIG contest, but I would've really liked
  it if each judge could just put in a couple words to justify their decisions
  like the MC I thing.  It would've helped us understand why each song
  deserved what it got...

Clement Poon...continued : Fri Oct 14 15:54:23 1994

  Anyways, we were on the subject about voting.  You did mention that there
  was 75 entries and 13 judges.  Yah, I understand how big a task that might
  have been, so when the job gets BIG like this one, split up the work load!
  Have each judge write up comments and then upload the whole wad to you, and
  all you have to do is just stick it in one big archive containing all the
  comment files from each judge!  I don't know, cause of course, I have never
  done a music contest before, so there's got be to another side to side, but
  it's a suggestion anyways.

  Oh, about the voting.  Somehow, I am opposed as to having public voting.
  It's just that if you have public voting and you have 2 categories to
  go by, I think that you should have 2 seperate categories of judges.
  Because one is based on Samples and the only one, Technical, it's really
  hard for the judges to give fair marks.  So might be not that good at music
  theory (that DOES include me!), they would have no idea how to give fair
  marks to the Veterans guys.

  ...Now are the judges being objective or are they just bored with listening
  to so many songs?  I think that the panel should've been split.  Oh well...
  I would like to say that MC ][ was still a great success and congratulate
  you for it!


[Back to Snowman]

As you can see, there were many good suggestions.  I will probably implement
some of them when MC]I[ rolls around.  Overall, people seem to be very pleased
with the way MC2 turned out.  I was happy to do it, and I look forward to
doing it again next year.

==============================================================================
((Section 5...Code Articles by Snowman))
==============================================================================
(GENERAL)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are two very good manuals out there that I have seen for programming
demos.

The first is Richard Ferraro's THIRD edition to: Programmer's Guide to the
EGA, VGA, and SVGA cards.  Our local Borders book store had this at $45.
Its ISBN is: 0-201-62490-7.

The second is Tricks of the Game Progamming Guru.  It has a CDRom full of C
source code and covers many topics like ray-casting (used in Doom) and
vectors.  It is published by Sams.  I have bought "Teach Yourself C in 21
Days" and "Teach Yourself Advanced C in 21 Days" from Sams, and they are sup-
erior manuals.  I expect no less from this new manual.  You can pick it up
for around $45.  Thanks to Trixter who pointed this book out to me.

I currently don't have either of these manuals.  :(

Of course, the best trainer IMO for getting started in the demo scene is
Denthor of Asphyxia's "VGA Trainer series".  You can find these under
/code/graph/tutor.  Best of all, its FREE!  :)  I am currently working on
converting the source in these tutorials from Pascal to C.

==============================================================================
((Section 6...ESCAPE Demo/Music CD))
==============================================================================

Check /pub/msdos/demos/incoming/democd for UPDATES and information.

We now have everything done for the CD and ready to be sent off for 
pressing.  Of course I had hoped to be done by MID OCTOBER but the
queueing of data and art took much longer then expected--especially
the art part.  Considering how talented people in the demo scene are
it is amazing how difficult it is to get anyone in ANY group to 
contribute art or anything else.  This is "THE" demo CD we are creating...
for demo enthusiast by demo enthusiast.  We didn't put any .GIF's or .FLI's
or other shit on this disk...just DEMOS/INTROS/MUSIC...and a couple
demo diskmags.  The results will be out in about TWO weeks so we will
let YOU (well, those who order/requested/will order) be the judge.  We
are pressing 300 copies with an option to press another 150 (unlikely).
This is not done for profit and we do not have any big distributors/
investors so the pressrun was kept to a minimum to reduce possible loss.

I expect to upload .jpg files (800x600 or higher) of the ART appearing
on the CD in their anticipated COLORS.  You can download this BIG file
from the /democd directory.

The CD will contain 209Megs of data and 48 minutes worth of music (12 songs)
which is a correction from last weeks newsletter.  I had to sixth about
20 megs for formatting space/precautions.  The CD will be a Mixed-MODE
ISO 9660 formatted CD.  Approximate selling cost is $10 (down from earlier
predicted cost).  I hope to have an EXACT cost by next week so people can
start sending money/etc.

Deadbaby is a FTP site run by SiDS [ACiD], who also coded the well know 
tribe view. This is an ANSI/Art Scene ONLY site. No demos, no muzak, no 
code, just packs, zines and text files. Deadbaby is also a dist site for 
many groups, including: katharsis!ascii, shiver, union, etc etc... hmm... 
that's about all... so ftp over to

deadbaby.res.wpi.edu NOW!

[This is great...maybe we will transfer all our ANSI/GFX to the
above mentioned site and gain some much needed space.]

Not this week.

I maintained this demo site from its beginnings in August/September 1992
to April 1993 and then from Late 1993 till now.  I plan on retiring from
mainting this site within the next month and would like somone to replace
me.  As we stand this person will be Snowman (Christopher) however, Snowman
will need somone to help him.  If you really explored this site you know
it could use some updating--demos reviewed, older/crap demos deleted, 
file links deleted, files linked, certain directories updated and such.  I
do not have the time to do all this...maybe you do.  Maybe you have ideas
for improvement.  If you feel you can help and are a dedicated person
then please contact Snowman or myself.  We only want SERIOUS people who
can continue to put in the 5-10 hours a week this site requires.  Most
of the previous people who attempted to help started strong and dwindled
to not helping at all...the work built up and now...well, there is
enough work to occupy a 40 hour week then 5 hours each additional week.
Well, maybe I am exagerating.
