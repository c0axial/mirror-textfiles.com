NEED HELP
---------

We could use some help REVIEWING demos and fixing up the text
files around this BBS so it is more informative and up-to-date.
IF you CAN and WANT to help let us know.  The programming dir
is in need of a update (1 line description).

We could also use a responsible person wanting to help organize
and move the incoming files every week.  Maybe even a person to
write this newsletter.  I can't do it forever ya know.

================
CLOSING COMMENTS
================

The TOP25DL is automatically updated every week on SUNDAY!  In fact,
we can mail you a copy if you want!

I expect ftp.uwp.edu to MIRROR soon--AGAIN--and things will be back
to normal with less strain on this site.

About the time the PARTY demos were coming in this site was down to
1.5 Megs!  Luckily the sysadmin freed up some space and now there is
a little over 150Megs--maybe less with all the stuff that has been
recently uploaded.
