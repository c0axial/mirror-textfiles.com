GENERAL STUFF
*************

The DEMOS.TXT file (/alpha directory) is now updated except for about 5
demos.  About 288 demos are reviewed within the 200K file and if you do
not want to read that you can always glance at the ONE LINE comments within
each /alpha directory while "on-line" (use "get DEMOS.A -").

*****************
A Plea to TRITON!
*****************

Please finish up the Fastracker 2.0 with GUS support. I grew to love 
fastracker when I had my SB Pro and now that I have my GUS, no other 
tracker will do! 

Sure some trackers come close in one aspect or another but Fast Tracker 
was/is the best tracker around.

Please don't make me put my SBPro back into the computer just so I can 
compose music.

I know you guys are busy coding for commercial stuff, but if you just 
finish FT2 in your spare time you will make your fans very happy.

So once more, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE finish FT2.0!!!

PS. If anyone close to TRITON reads this, do the world a favor and 
forward it to one of them!

sell for around $1000), Four color printing, One-off CD pre mastering, 
marketing, distributing, and good CD making companies.
