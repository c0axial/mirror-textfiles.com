HOT NEWS

So where is the 2nd Reality by Future Crew?
It's the 65th day since Assembly '93 and the winning demo is not released
yet. How is this possible? According to some messages in USENET NEWS comp.sys.
ibm.pc.demos   "FC ARE LAME" (but we disagree with this). But if FC want to
prevent such messages they'd better release their demo soon. DO NOT LET US
WAIT TILL 100th ANNIVERSARY!

GORE from FC wrote following:
Oct 2nd         Hehe... Still no Second Reality. Just hang in there!

Sep 2nd         Second Reality should come out pretty soon now, but
                we wouldn't want to give you an exact date since you
                never really know when things start to fall apart :-)

Why does adapting the demo to SB take so long? Their S3M routines were made
far before GUS appeared, so what's the problem?

Just one note: there are some rumors that FC are gonna release 2nd Reality
at Oct 9. This is what Abbys (SysOp of Starport, FC's HQ) said this weekend.
On ftp.uwp.edu was also created a directory:
                 2nd_Reality_will_be_released_on_Oct_9

And info from pulse004 (Extreme's diskmag):
they call FC disorganizers of ASM'93 because there was a big mess. And: why
were all demos presented on mono devices and only 2nd Reality was shown on
stereo??? Maybe it's because FC used surround sound in their demo and that
wouldn't be obvious if all demos were in stereo. Why didn't all the groups
have the same conditions??? The Party'93 will be a battlefield!!!

On 8th-10th Oct there will be an Aggresive Party in Kerava/Finland and
someone said that 2nd reality will be released on this Party, because FC are
organizers of PC section on Aggresive Party... (or maybe disorganizers
again?)

And next rumor about FC: Marvel's Ice Kingdom (ASM '93 gfx winner) seems to
be copied from a fantasy book. This is the story so far:
P.B. uploaded bear1.gif to this site with this text:
  "Its a picture that Marvel from FC copied and won ASM'93 with"
When you compare both pictures you can see that bear1 is a scanned image,
but they are quite similar. Marvel surely did a good job BUT HE STOLE THE
PICTURE. It was not his idea, his own creativity. There are messages in
USENET NEWS that the money should be returned, the painter of the original
should be found and given the money :-)  So is anybody from FC gonna explain
this? BTW: how about the copyright in the bottom of bear1!!!

FC are definitly losing their reputation?
