Not Recommended DEMO:  SUNKNOWN--the demo that won The Gathering 1994.  I
have a 386DX40 and I let the part directly after the introduction run for
about 30 minutes and did not see more than some blue cubes spinning past
the corners of my screen.  I could NOT escape nor progress past this 
extremely slow portion of the demo.  Certainly not a demo optimized for
speed.  If this group is LISTENING it is recommended that you allow
usage of the "ESC" key so everyone can watch SUNKNOWN.


ANSI:  Acid 4/94, Bad 3/94, Die pack 7, Gothic 3/94, Ice 4/94, and
       Visual Insanity (vi) 2/94 & 3/94.

*************
GENERAL STUFF
*************

Demos moved from the incoming directory will now be placed into the
"/alpha/NEW" directory until they have been reviewed.

As of today all the demos from K-Z have been reviewed and the DEMOS.TXT
and 1 line descriptions reflect this update.  0-9 to j are almost complete
and Mike is expected to finish updating them this week.

NEW MIRROR SITE:

We have another demo site in Europe.  This new one is called:  ftp.luth.se
and is located in SWEDEN.  I am not sure how often this site is updated
or what is mirrored.  The demos are located in the /pub/msdos/demos
directory.  Check it out if you are getting slow x-fer rates here ftping
from abroad to the US.

DEMO/MUSIC CD ROM
:<:<:<:<:<:<:<:<:

If you know about data/audio CD's please feel free to contact SNOWMAN 
or myself to let us know COST, companies, and technical information.

We are serious about this.  Maybe we can have an encore track by
New Order or a group YOU may be in with LIVE VOCALS.

Restructuring the /music directory by Snowman - r3cgm@dax.cc.uakron.edu
----------------------------------
 
        This will all be in a music.txt soon, but I wanted to jot this
down for those of you who have asked me this.
        In the /music directory, we now have some directories that start
with a, some with m, and some with p.  a = artist, m = music, p = program.
I had too many directories and this should simplify things a bit.
        This week I uploaded a ton of stuff to all the a directories so
check 'em out.  If you have a song written by Zodiac, PM, Skaven, C.C.Catch,
or Leinad that is not posted, then please upload it.  I'll be really happy
with you.  :)

SPOTLITE by Snowman - r3cgm@dax.cc.uakron.edu
--------
 
        Does anyone remember my article last issue called "Make or Break"?
Well, you know how many responses I got to it?  Just about the same number
as Future Crew demos that suck.  This in mind, I decided to write an article
which requires NO reponse.  "SPOTLITE" was born.  Each week, I will high-
light some of the new programs that are uploaded that in my opinion are
unusual, different, or interesting for some reason.
 
This months Spotlites are:
 
EXTREME'S TRACKER
-----------------
 
   UMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM8
   3This is a GUS ONLY tracker. So if you have another card,3
   3go get a GUS because it's the card of the future.       3
   TMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM>
 
   I downloaded this tracker about a week ago, and was pretty impressed.
   It has a very nice GUI (Graphical User Interface).  It does not play
   MODs completely correctly, but it says that in the documentation.  This
   is just a beta version, and we are supposed to report known bugs.  It
   requires mouse.  The new 16 channel format it stores files in is X3M.
   Hmm......sounds like another 16 channel I've seen before..  :)  It
   imports MODs only (if I remember right).  This program is worth checking
   out.
        
VLA'S PASCAL DEMO TUTORIAL /pub/msdos/demos/programming/source/tut1-9.zip
--------------------------                                     tut10.zip
 
   About half a year ago, I started to     +----------------------------+ 
   learn pascal.  Right about the same     |     The ASPHYXIA VGA       |
   time this tutorial was released, I      |   DEMO TRAINER SERIES!     |
   was trying to learn some graphics       |   By Denthor of ASPHYXIA   |
   routines.  Even though I know that      |    Documentation on how    |
   pascal is a "lame" lauguage to code     |  to code demo like effects |
   demos in, I thought I'd learn the       |         in TP6/7!          |
   basics before I tried my hand at        |Full Pascal source included!|
   assembler.  I havn't gotten a chance    |    From putting a pixel    |
   to fully look at this yet, but I did    |  to sprites and animation  |
   try to run all the demos.  All but      |  to wireframe 3D to solid  |
   3 compiled on my TP6.0.  I'll have to   |            3D!             |
   get a copy of 7.0 soon.  I wrote        |       Get it now!          |
   Denthor himself to tell him how much    +----------------------------+
   I liked this tutorial, and he seems
   like a very personable guy.  By the
   way, Asphyxia is clear down in South
   Africa.
 
FUNK IT UP.MOD /pub/msdos/demos/incoming/TG94_Music/funkitup.zip
--------------
 
   After I listened to this song, I couldn't figure out why it finished
   4th.  Its really good, check it out.
 
LUNATIC.MOD /pub/msdos/demos/incoming/TG94_Music/lunatic.zip
-----------
 
   This song placed first at the Gathering, and for good reason.
 
ASSEMBLY 94' INVITATION /pub/msdos/demos/incoming/asm-94.zip
-----------------------
 
   This is the intro you have all been waiting for.  Nothing really special
   or groundbreaking about it, but it IS the Assembly 94 intro, so you
   should get a copy of it.
 
 
Closing Words:
 
        If I didn't mention your new song, music disk, program, etc., it
   doesn't mean that I didn't like it.  I am just trying to highlight some
   of the more unusual or groundbreaking releases.

The Grumpy Old Man
------------------
 
        BACK IN MY DAY!, WE DIDN'T HAVE NO FANCY SCHMANCY 28.8Ks.  WE
DIDN'T EVEN HAVE 300 Baud.  WE HAD TO CALL EACH OTHER VOICE AND SAY "BIT 1
IS 0, BIT 2 IS 1, BIT 3 IS 0, etc."  THOSE WERE THE DAYS!
        But when I was a youngen and got my first shiny modem, I thanked
the God of Hayes whenever a file transfer took under a day.  You hoolagins
have it so good nowadays!  You'll never know the pleasure of a CPS rate of
22.  You don't have any respect FOR YOUR ROOTS!
        YOU LAZY LAZY LAZY SONS OF BITCHES!  After I put my dentures in to
soak a couple of months ago, I thought I'd call Digital Oxygene.  You know
what I saw!?!?  A new demo by Future Crew!  As you kids would say, I was
pretty "happy".  It was an add for SSI (makers of AD&D computer games).
Well, I called my wife Mildred over to the computer.  I said "Dear, look
what the boys in Finland did!  They made me a very happy man today".  She
replied "Thats very nice dear, NOW LEAVE ME THE HELL ALONE, I'M TRYING TO
POLISH OFF THIS DAMN VECTOR DOT ROUTINE!"  Well, Mildred now sleeps about
6 feet underground (thanks to a well placed toaster in the bathtub).
        Anyway, back to what I was saying... I was so happy.  Unfortunately,
this program was over 5 MEGS BIG!  IN MY DAY, 5 MEGS WAS ENOUGH TO KEEP A
FAMILY OF 12 FED FOR OVER A WEEK!!!  YOU LAZY KIDS!  I didn't want to pay
$25 to download this thingie long distance, so I hopped on the 'net.  IT
WASN'T THERE!!!  AND GUESS WHAT?!!?!?  IT STILL ISN'T!!!  YOU LAZY LAZY SONS
OF BITCHES!  You mean to tell me that not ONE of you, after 2 months, has
the power to get off your lazy ass and upload this demo to the 'net!?!?!
        IF I WERE YOUR AGE, I'D TAKE YOU !ALL! OUT BACK AND BEAT THE TAR
OUT A' YA.  THERE ARE WOMEN AND CHILDREN STARVING 'CAUSE YOU HAVN'T UPLOADED
THIS!!!!  YOU DON'T WANT THEIR DEATHS ON YOUR HANDS.
        UPLOAD THE FREAKING FUTURE CREW DEMO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
