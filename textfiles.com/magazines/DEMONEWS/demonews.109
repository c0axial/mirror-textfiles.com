=---------------------------------------------------[Introduction]--[Snowman]-=

 Hello all, and welcome to DemoNews issue 109.

 Sorry for delaying this newsletter.  There was some information I needed
 for the "Freedom CD" review that I couldn't get earlier.

 The Hornet NAID Report has been completed.  You can find it under
 /demos/incoming/demos/hrn-nr95.zip.  It's just a little over a meg so it
 shouldn't take a long time to download.  Trixter wanted me to say that if
 you find any bugs in the report, mail him at trixter@ftp.cdrom.com.

 This week I reviewed most of the Wired '95 demos, intros, and graphics.
 There is one file I should note; the Autumn 64k Intro by Episilon.  I liked
 this intro, but a rather odd thing happened.  Apparently the intro left my
 computer in an unstable condition.  When I went to record the rating for it
 in DemoNews, my computer hung.  Snowman's tip: don't upload something that
 is going to crash my computer while entering in its rating.

 Work continues on re-organizing the /graphics directory.

 We are in the process of creating more and more utilities to manage the
 archive better.  Originally these were done in C, but have since been
 converted to Perl.  I sent out a proto-type for a totally new type of
 ALLFILES.TXT within the group this week, and it was received well.  Look
 for some big changes by the end of this year.

 BTW: We are up 72 subscribers from last issue.  This is the biggest jump
 since DemoNews.075 clear back on December 18, 1994.  Welcome to all those
 who recently subscribed.

 Enjoy the articles, enjoy the ratings, and remember that The Party 1995
 is only about a month away.

 Take care.

=------------------------------[Assembly '95 Prizes]--[Pehu, Moku, and Abyss]-=

 [taken from newsgroup comp.sys.ibm.pc.demos]

 _____Introduction

 This is official information about Assembly '95 and its prizes.  I don't
 find it nice myself personally, and I hope all the winners understand the
 ongoing situation.

 Assembly '95 was budgeted a zero profit party.  Many disbelieved it and
 thought it was so commercial and to the benefit of only the organizers.
 Well, such was not the case.

 _____Why the Delay?

 Assembly '95 Prizes has to be delayed in some parts.  Why is that? We got a
 HUGE (50-70K fim) extra payment from the fair center.  Our insurance
 company got cranky and the cleaning company that provided the cleaning
 billed us a HELL lot more than was agreed.  They did something extra that
 we didn't agree upon and now they are billing us from it.  Thus, we don't
 have money to pay ALL the prizes.

 The delay for others has been caused by the fair centre's late timing for
 paying us the money we had in their vaults, and that our bank messed up
 with the payings (I guess they cant handle too much at the same time).
 Things are beginning to clear now (thank god) and we have been completing
 the final transfers during this week and the last week (today being
 02-Oct-1995).

 _____Apologies and Plans

 I am very sorry about the state of the things at the moment.  I must
 apologize also personally that this happened, be it then our fault directly
 or not... I won't be the judge.  But, WE WILL PAY ALL THE PRIZES WITH
 INTEREST, that is our primary objective at the moment.  We are collecting
 money furiously and I am very sure the final payments will be done within
 two months from this date.  We think its the best way to delay more the
 positions 6-15 in all competition series and pay the bigger prizes first.

 I feel quite unhappy myself because of this situation.  In a way, me, Abyss
 and Moku are in the same boat with you, we made 6 months of hard work for
 zero pay. The  asm95 prizes and other organizers payments are our primary
 objectives in that particular order.  But I would like to keep in mind that
 WE DO PAY THE PRIZES.  We have been working for the demoscene a long time,
 and this what happened is very unfortunate thing :(  But I ask your trust
 regarding this matter.

 _____The Assembly 1995 CDROM

 About the state of ASM95 CDROM: it is finished.  We expect the final
 updates of all products to be delivered to us before next friday.  You can
 upload them to ftp.icon.fi to /incoming directory as anonymous.  Please
 REMEMBER to add a text file describing what the product is.

 The rom will be on market in about 1 month [this article is about 2 months
 old], and we also arrange that the demoscene can buy it via internet too.
 The price will be around $35 or so. And it darned looks good! :) (some
 positive news about it).

=-----------------[WIN '95 - What Does It Mean for the Scene?]--[Ryan Cramer]-=

 _____Introduction

 This is a look at Windows95 and its advantages and disadvantages for the
 Demo Scener.  Also a look at what it can do in terms of Internet access.
 After all, the scene practically lives on the Internet now.

 Windows has long been something to bash for many scene people (including
 myself).  Lets face it, Windows 3.1 was a piece of shit.  Seeing the lead
 that Microsoft had taken with its Windows 3.1 product, there was quite a
 reason to be scared about the future of the scene.  This is mainly because
 of the fact that Windows (and other products) take the system resources
 away completely, and we usually like our system resources to be available
 for demos.

 Lets also admit that DOS is a piece of shit too.  Anyone that has any UNIX
 experience can attest to this.  However, since DOS is not a multitasking
 operating system, programs (such as demos) can easily take full control of
 the computer.  Of course, operating systems like Linux could potentially be
 a great demo system, but keep in mind that unix is like Windows in that it
 wants you to do everything its own way, and it also wants control over all
 low level system resources.

 I had thought that Windows95 would spell death to the demoscene, because no
 longer would we be able to run demos since they required total system
 resources and Windows95 likes to have control of EVERYTHING.  On the other
 hand, an operating system like DOS just cannot survive unless the only
 purpose you have for a computer is to run games and demos.  I *hope* that
 this is not you.  Multitasking operating systems are here to stay,
 specifically Windows95 is taking over whether we like it or not.  What does
 this mean to us?

 _____Windows '95

 Because my job required it, I had to install Windows '95 on my home
 computer to do some Win32 development.  I've been kind of away from the
 scene lately, so I wasn't too bothered about turning my computer over to
 Microsoft since it would lead to $$ in the long run.  Money is a good
 thing.

 Windows '95 was not at all like Windows 3.1, it's totally different.  At
 first, I really did not like it and was very tempted to remove it entirely.
 However, once you get used to it, you tend to discover just how clever some
 of the stuff is.  Not only is Windows '95 good for the complete beginner,
 but it gives the advanced users the power they demand.  However, after
 being in DOS and unix for so many years, it can be difficult to get used to
 a Windows environment.

 The interesting thing about Windows '95 is that it is apparently still
 running on top of DOS, and it is using the DOS FAT file system.  This means
 that all previous DOS apps are completely compatible with Win95. In fact,
 Win95 *multitasks* DOS apps quite well.  I was ftping files from the
 Internet on my PPP account and at the same time composing in ST3.

 While kind of a kludge, Win95 long file names appear like this in Windows:

 LongFilename.txt

 ...and in DOS...

 LONGFI~1.TXT

 If we had another file called: LongFilenameYouAre_a_Loser.txt, it would
 appear as:

 LONGFI~2.TXT

 While this looks pretty stupid, if Microsoft had done this in any other way
 (not using FAT) no longer would your old DOS programs be compatible under
 Windows '95.  In this respect, Win95 long file names work quite well.

 _____What about Demos, Trackers, etc.?

 When you are ready to dedicate total system resources to DOS to run your
 favorite demos or tracking programs, you have to shut down Windows '95 and
 have it load DOS. This works a lot better then you'd imagine.  When you've
 done this you're back into the old DOS that you've grown to love and hate.
 The only difference is that it's called Windows95 DOS (ouch!).  You will
 not have trouble running anything because you are in DOS, not some sort of
 emulation like you might get in OS/2 or dosemu under Linux.

 Under Windows '95, you are getting a 32 bit operating system, but you still
 get to keep your DOS.  Something that I didn't think I'd get to do when I
 originally installed it.  You *will* be able to run your DOS stuff.

 _____System Resources

 Windows95 is just as much of a resource hog as Windows 3.1, but it does it
 a little more smoothly.  With the same amount of memory, Win95 can do quite
 a bit more than Win 3.1.  However, I wouldn't bother installing it unless
 you have a 486/66+ with at least 8 megs of RAM, and preferably 16.  Right
 now I'm running it on a 486/120 with 20megs of RAM, and it runs quite
 nicely. Win95 is also going to take up quite a bit of hard drive space.
 For people that have a minimum configuration, stick with what you've got
 and don't install Windows '95.

 _____Internet Connectivity

 These days, being part of the demoscene means that you must also be pretty
 involved with the Internet (at least for most of us reading this).  Win95's
 Internet abilities on SLIP/PPP accounts are in my opinion its greatest
 strength.

 Those that use SLIP/PPP accounts on Windows 3.1 have to use a program
 called Trumpet Winsock (or one of the other cheezeball WINSOCK's). Those
 that have used it know that while functional, it is not a very likable
 software. Under Win95, the Winsock networking is included as part of the
 operating system, and its all 32 bit. Because of this, you will get a lot
 better performance out of your PPP account.

 Right now I am working for an internet provider as the senior unix systems
 administrator, and I've found I can do much of my work from home through my
 PPP account.  I can have a number of telnets open to different machines,
 Netscape running, and ftping files from various sites.  With a good telnet
 client (like QVT) you can telnet to your unix shell account and think you
 are actually sitting right at the unix terminal.

 In addition, whether we like it or not, most new internet software is being
 developed for Windows. While I don't see Windows being a reliable server
 product, some internet providers are actually using Windows/NT to power
 their servers.  IMHO, only unix based machines are acceptable for Internet
 servers, but from the client side, Windows95/NT is a good product.

 _____Should You Upgrade?

 This is tough to say. I'm not sure that I would recommend you to upgrade to
 Windows '95 unless you have a powerful system and you can take advantage of
 its Internet abilities.  I have to say honestly that I think a large
 percentage of the market is going to be using Windows '95 in the near
 future, and it is the operating system to know.  Just to be competitive, I
 think upgrading would be to your advantage.

 I'm not going to tell you to upgrade or not to upgrade. Many of you already
 have, and you really like it.  Also, many of you have upgraded and have
 quickly deleted Win95 off of your system.  It is different than what you
 are used to.  My main purpose in writing this article is to let you know
 that using Windows95 will not in any way decrease your ability to
 participate in the Demoscene, and in some ways, may enhance it.

=---------------------------[The Freedom CD Review by 7th Graders]--[Snowman]-=

 _____Introduction

 The Freedom CD is produced by Dan Wright.  It is a dual-cd (2 CD's in one
 case).  One CD contains, in audio form, entries to Music Contest ]I[ and
 several other songs.  The other CD contains demos, intros, source code,
 music, etc., collected from various sites.  Freedom is the sequel to
 Escape, which was produced last year.

 The CD case itself is simply beautiful.  The artwork used was carefully
 selected and went through several drafts before it finally went to press.
 By simply looking at the exterior of this CD, you'll know that a lot of
 time and effort went in to making it.

 Dan Wright has been the coordinator for both the Escape and Freedom CD
 efforts.  He is very particular about how productions will look, and it
 shows.

 Now with the outside of the CD explained, it's time for the twist...

 _____Background Info

 Floss and I had the pleasure of hosting Music Contest ]I[, from which most
 of the audio data was derived.  As you might expect, my mother was eager to
 hear what the songs sounded like (not kidding).  Now, she is an elementary
 school teacher and is in charge of the 7th graders music class.  I gave her
 one of the Freedom CD's to listen to, not having the faintest idea what
 else she intended to do with it.

 In America, a holiday called Thanksgiving has just passed.  It is a time
 when families get together and eat food (not a complicated thing).  :) I
 explain this because only one third DemoNews readers are from the USA, but
 I digress.  After I finished eating dinner with my mother, she pulls out a
 stack of papers and hands them to me.  To my astonishment, they were
 reviews of the Freedom CD by her class of 7th graders!

 Apparently she had played the CD during one of her lessons, and then asked
 the children to write down what they thought.  So now I present to you the
 Freedom CD as reviewed by 7th graders.

 A few of the songs on the CD are referred to by track number.  Just for
 reference:

 1 = Kingdom Skies by Jase
 2 = The Crossing by Necros
 3 = Drift by Nemesis
 4 = Wanderlust by Leviathan
 7 = Can't Fake Michelle by Shikando
 8 = Babewatch by Ryan Cramer

 _____Angela

 This piece of music was different from any kind of music I've heard before.
 I liked it but it made me feel like I was dreaming.  It felt like I was in
 a jungle or something running or trying to get away from something chasing
 me.

 _____Ryan

 I like the music but I wish more of the songs were of a faster tempo. I
 like music with a lot of bass and electric gitar but this music wasn't bad.

 _____Jennifer

 In my opinion, I love it.  I've heard music before, but but neve to such an
 extreme work of excellence.  I'm not saying this just to be a goody-goody
 either.

 _____Lesley

 I kinds of liked the C.D. and kind of didn't most of the songs were okay
 but the first couple realy rtunh [can't make out the word].

 _____Jan

 The music I just heard was not what I call music.  The stuff I was
 listening to was a hole nother artform.  In a second I liked it and didn't
 like it.  I guess I thought it was going to be something more than what I
 just listened to.

 _____Cassandra

 My view on the music I just heard.  I like this music.  I would like it
 better with some words.  My favorite songs were numbers 2, 7, and 8. Some
 of the songs needed more rythm, but the songs I liked best were perfect.

 _____David

 The tempo would be high and fast and then gradully slow down but right when
 you thought the song would a loud sound with fast tempo would like start it
 up again.  That computer music was cool.

 _____Allison

 Sometimes I would feel calmed and relaxed then other times I would feel
 more excited.  I have never heard computer music but now that I have I know
 it is something I will remember.  At first you think it is going to be
 similar to some of the classical music.  You get too relaxed but then it
 changes and makes you want to get up and dance.

 _____Patrick

 I enjoy this music.  It was sounds you can't get out of a regular
 instrument.  Computers can give you that sound to that sounds like it comes
 from the future.  This music can make you feel like you can just go out and
 have fun.

 _____Tiffany

 My favorite song what I heard was the second one.  I didn't only like just
 one song, I loved them all, but my favorite is still the second song.

 _____Natalie

 My favorite was the number one song the judges liked.

 _____Doug

 I liked number 2, 3, 4, and 7.  I believe it would be nice to listen to
 this on a rainy afternoon just sitting down and relaxing.  Piece number 3
 first started out like a native american beat but then it built you up and
 went back to the refrain I like that.

 _____Emily

 I hope your son get's that job you were talking about in January.

 _____Leah

 Crossing has a different beat but it sounds good. I like the difference in
 it.  It feels like it could be in a movie like showing something.  4th song
 I didn't like as much as the others but then at the end I liked it.

 _____Kyle

 I thought the computer music was very intiresting because you can do all of
 it siting down in a chair in front of a keyboard.

 _____Ryan

 The second song was one of my favorites.  I didn't like the first song
 because of the tempo.

 _____Summary and How to Order

=----------------------[Gravis and the new PnP Sound Card]--[Advanced Gravis]-=

 _____Introduction

 BURNABY, British Columbia, October 9, 1995 --  Advanced Gravis Computer
 Technology Ltd. announces a new generation of wavetable PC sound cards, the
 UltraSound Plug & Play and the UltraSound Plug & Play Pro.  The new cards
 offer the quality of wavetable sound and the convenience of Windows '95 PnP
 at very affordable prices.  Expected to be one of the first Plug & Play
 wavetable sound cards on the market, the standard and Pro versions are
 estimated to have a street price of $149.00 and $199.00 US, respectively.
 Competing sound cards typically cost up to $50 more.

 _____Capabilities

 Advanced Gravis is the most prominent company to offer a sound card with
 full duplex capabilities, making simultaneous, real-time verbal
 conversation on the Internet possible. To fully showcase this feature,
 Advanced Gravis is including with the UltraSound Plug & Play, a microphone,
 and a complete bundle of software enabling users to utilize the Internet
 for telephonic communications.  This full Internet package is comprised of:

 -CompuServer Internet access kit, which includes the Mosaic browser for
  access to the Internet.
 -Internet Phone, which allows users to "dial-up" and actually speak to
  others on-line.
 -RealAudio, which delivers real-time sound for programming such as concerts
  and sporting events.

 The UltraSound Plug & Play sound cards are the first to announce use of the
 highly-integrated Interwave chip developed by Advanced Micro Devices.  The
 Interwave chip was developed as the result of a joint venture between
 Gravis and AMD utilizing Advanced Gravis' UltraSound audio technology.

 The Interwave chip is the first to provide integration of the MPC-3
 multimedia requirements.  This integrated technology allows Gravis to
 deliver more honest reproduction of sound and reduce the card's cost
 without sacrificing the quality of the other components.

 "Gravis pioneered consumer-priced wavetable synthesis, with its
 introduction of the world's first affordable 32-voice wavetable sound card,
 the UltraSound," says Mike Cooper, President of Advanced Gravis. "So, it
 makes sense that we would be one of the first to introduce Windows 95 Plug
 & Play wavetable sound cards especially at a reasonable price."

 For the first time, Gravis is offering instrument samples in ROM format as
 well as in its widely accepted RAM architecture.  The Pro version comes
 with 512K RAM installed, making it compatible with UltraSound, the
 industry's most widely supported, full-featured wavetable sound card.  Both
 versions can be upgraded to up to 8MB of RAM delivering the ability to load
 a broader array of high-quality custom sounds and digital effects such as
 flange, reverb and chorus.

 Like the family of UltraSound cards, the UltraSound Plug & Play features
 musical sound from playback samples of real instruments.  Unlike other
 sound boards that use FM synthesis, the true 16-bit, 32 voice UltraSound
 Plug & Play cards use all digital wavetable synthesis to produce superior
 CD-quality sound.  (FM syntheses tries to electronically emulate
 instruments producing unrealistic simulated sounds, while wavetable
 synthesis relies on digital recordings of actual sound.)

 The sound quality, price and convenience of the UltraSound Plug & Play line
 make it an ideal choice for a first-time sound card buyer or as an upgrade
 for experienced users. The UltraSound Plug & Play will replace the
 UltraSound MAX in the Gravis line of wavetable sound cards.

 The UltraSound Plug & Play is an ideal card for the Internet, but also
 delivers technical and performance enhancements which make it a
 well-rounded wavetable sound card for other uses.

 _____Technical Advantages

 -Built using the AMD Interwave chip - fully transparent in its operation,
  the AMD Interwave chip provides third generation wavetable technology and
  quality.
 -Plug n Play compliant, Win95 compatible - for maximum ease of use.
 -Packaged with popular software - Internet Phone, RealAudio, Cakewalk
  Express, CompuServe Internet kit with the Mosaic browser, Sound Forge
  v2.0, WinDecks stereo rack, 200MB of games and demos for additional fun.
 -Enhanced emulation mode - greatly improved and transparent emulation of
  other sound standards for games that don't support UltraSound directly;
  optimized to take advantage of new features in the Interwave chip for
  backward compatibility with Sound Blaster and General MIDI applications.

 -Upgradeable to 8MB RAM using standard 30-pin SIMMs - to create and use
  custom instruments and have access to richer quality sound; digital sound
  effects such as reverb, chorus and flange will be available via a software
  upgrade in the first quarter '96.

 [editor's note: you may want to keep this in mind if you are considering
 upgrading your motherboard to handle 72-pin SIMMs (and not knowing what to
 do with those old 30-pin SIMMs).]

 _____Performance Advantages

 -Ultra-compatible - most widely supported wavetable sound card for DOS
  games.
 -Provides full duplex record and playback - ideal for Internet voice
  communication and multitrack recording applications.
 -16-bit, stereo recording and playback, up to 48KHz - enables DAT-quality
  recording from a multitude of sources.
 -Speed compensating, full gameport - fastest way to connect your game
  controllers.
 -Full 192 General MIDI instrument set, plus 6 GS drum kits - all the
  instruments you need for great music.
 -5.6 megabyte General MIDI patch set - on CD-ROM for downloading to onboard
  memory of the card.
 -Support for standard sound libraries - featuring the Sound Operating
  System from HMI and the Audio Interface Library from Miles Design, which
  together comprise a majority of current games.

 _____Standard Features

 -Five input mixer with stereo and volume controls - allow you to control
  input from your sound sources.
 -MPC-3 compatible.
 -IDE CD-ROM interface.
 -MIDI interface - connects industry standard MIDI instruments.
 -External connectors including - stereo line-in, line-out, microphone-in,
  joystick/MIDI adapter.
 -Supports most popular games - games written for Adlib, Sound Blaster,
  UltraSound, General MIDI, SCC-1 and MT-32.

 The UltraSound Plug & Play works with all 386 and higher IBM PCs and
 compatible computers.  UltraSound Plug and Play comes with 1MB of ROM
 standard.  The Pro version has 512K of onboard memory, features a 5.6
 megabyte General MIDI patch set and supports applications written for
 Windows 3.1 and Win95, Sound Blaster, Roland MT-32, General MIDI and
 UltraSound.

 Just for the record, E-TECH, formerly FORTE TECHNOLOGIES, INC (we now are
 the VFX1 HEADGEAR Division) Made BOTH Ultrasound Series cards - the
 previous ones (GUS, GUSMAX) and invented these new ones as well - along
 with the chip!  AMD just happens to have bought the rights to it or
 something to that effect.  But in any event, E-TECH is THE real brains
 behind these cards.

 Sorry to butt in, but I feel that credit should be given where credit is
 due, and it miffs me that Gravis & AMD "steal" all the credit for doing
 nothing but having big pocket books.
