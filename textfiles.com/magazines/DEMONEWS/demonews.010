===============
DEMO GROUP INFO
===============

--Twilight Zone shall be releasing a "special demo" called The Jungly
  Kitchen.  Morten (Bogeyman) assures me it will not be the "boring"
  stuff that every group seems to be doing these days.  They also hope
  to have GUS support.  There is possibly a bootleg of this demo that
  was COPIED at the party in Denmark.  It would be very buggy.
  LOOK for it HERE within the next couple weeks.

====================
DEMO BBS'S AND STUFF
====================

SOUND BARRIER (New York, NY)  = 1-718-979-9406
MUSIC CONNECTION (Dallas, TX) = 1-214-596-2827
MUSIC CHANNEL (Hartford, CT)  = 1-203-646-3058

UPLOAD new demos to the /pub/incoming/demos DIRECTORY.
OR to /pub/msdos/demos/INCOMING DIRECTORY on wasp.eng.ufl.edu

=========
NEWSGROUP 
=========

   Is there any chance of someone out there attempting to get a DEMO
   NEWSGROUP on the NEWSREADER?  How about trying?  They have an amiga demo
   group, what about an IBM/PC demo group on the newsreader.  I have a whole
   article on how to GET a NEWSGROUP on the NEWSREADER.  Anyone got the time?

============
MIRROR SITES
============

This site is mirrored at the following places:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
oliver.sun.ac.za     - /pub/msdos/demos (in South Africa)
wasp.eng.ufl.edu*     - /pub/msdos/demos (in USA--FAST)
nic.funet.fi~         - /pub/msdos/games/demos/new? (FINLAND)

*The WASP site has an INCOMING dir within the demos directory.
~Have to check in to see if official mirror or just a hack.

=========
WHAT'S UP
=========

--At LEAST 2 demos changed the CLOCKon the computer I use.  These demos
  are MONSTRA and STARBASE.  Others may also do this.  My advice is to
  not have your modem call LD to set your clocks time.  You'll save money.

--This demosite, including the source.code directory, takes up a little
  over 25 Megs.  I have all the demos stored on approximately 17 disks. 

--Every Week the WASP demo site compiles statistics which I will use to
  create a file called TOPTEN_DOWNLOADS.
