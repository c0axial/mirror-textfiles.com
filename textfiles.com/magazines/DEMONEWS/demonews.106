=---------------------------------------------------[Introduction]--[Snowman]-=

 Hello all, and welcome to DemoNews issue 106.

 This is a very interesting week as far as DemoNews and ftp.cdrom.com are
 concerned.  I apologize for this rather lengthy introduction.

 _____The Future of ftp.cdrom.com /pub/demos

 This week I received a mail from one of the ftp.cdrom.com administrators.
 Our demo archive is in a rather awkward and touchy situation.  I print this
 information because it affects _everyone_ who uses the archive.  This is
 very important.  Please read over the material and give some feedback if
 you feel inspired.

 Running out of room:

   Problem:

   >> In DemoNews.104, I listed the remaining size for our archive at about
   >> 394 megs.  Earlier this week, I checked again and it was down to less
   >> than 200!

   Solution:

   > I've removed one of the archives on .21, and I'm in the process of
   > moving two more to another drive.  This _should_ leave you with about
   > 850 megabytes remaining.

   Analysis:

   We have a comfortable area to grow into for a few months.

 Slow connection:

   Problem:
 
   >> Many people are having a lot of difficulty getting on to
   >> ftp.cdrom.com. This situation will not improve until the
   >> administration at Walnut Creek (who own the ftp.cdrom.com archive)
   >> decide to add on a few more processors or increase the bandwidth.

   Solution:

   > Actually (just so you know), we're actually _memory_ bound and not CPU
   > nor I/O bound.  We're running at 128 megabytes on ftp.cdrom.com, and
   > we're looking _actively_ into getting a motherboard which can handle
   > more.  Believe me, we're more anxious than you to make ftp.cdrom.com
   > faster and better!

   Analysis:

   Faster connect and transfer times coming soon.

 Our future:

   Problem:

   >> Now, I'll bet you're saying to yourself "I'd really like to help out
   >> ftp.cdrom.com in some way but I just don't know how."

   Potential Solutions:

   > You can ask them for donations!  Those 4.4 gigabyte drives aren't free,
   > you know!  (If we could make a demos CDROM, however, we could _easily_
   > put in a 4.4 gigabyte drive for you!  We get a request a few times a
   > week -- the most of any part of our site that's not already on a
   > CDROM!)

   Analysis:

   This is a tricky thing, and I am stumped.  When we first came to
   ftp.cdrom.com, I made sure with Mr. Seidl that we were under no
   commitment to have our files sold on CD.

   Walnut Creek gives us a place to hold our archive, a nexus from which all
   new demo scene releases can be obtained, a place that Hornet calls home.
   But what do we give Walnut Creek in return?  Not much.  :(

   WC is a wonderful company and has shown us every courtesy possible. It is
   now time for us to pay our duty.  But how?  Here are a few options:

   -Allow Walnut Creek to put the demo archive on CDROM

     Upside:   You can download our entire stock of demos, music, code, and
               graphics at about a 400k/s transfer rate (since you only have
               to go from your CDROM drive to your hard drive).

               Walnut Creek is happy with us and gives us a 4.4 gig drive to
               use (won't have to delete any old files for a long time).

               We can complain about the archive being slow without fear. :)

     Downside: Lots of difficulty getting permissions from authors.

               Not the best public relations in the world; "You upload to
               our site, we sell your file on CD and don't pay you anything!"

               Possible copyright conflicts with existing CDs that already
               have files from a given demo party on them.

   -Don't allow Walnut Creek to put our demo archive on CDROM

     Upside:   No copyright conflicts.

     Downside: Walnut Creek is not happy with us and decides that giving
               storage to an archive which provides no financial return is
               not worth the trouble.  We are gone.  Not a pleasant thought.

   -Allow Walnut Creek to put _some_ of the demo archive on CDROM
    (this is also known as GD's option)

     Upside:   (see all Upsides from first option)
               (see all Upsides from second option)

     Downside: Still can't pay for college.  :)  Can't think of any others.

 Conclusion:

 This last option appears to be the most attractive.  However, _which_ parts
 of our archive do we offer for the CD?  How do we go about getting
 permissions from the authors of those files?  Do we _need_ to get
 permissions from the authors if the files we choose are shareware?

 The whole situation is more than a little frustrating.  I welcome any and
 all thoughts you have to offer.

 _____Points for Helping

 Last week I wrote an article about how you can help our site out.  Here
 are the current standings for points:

 Name      Points
 --------  ------
 Henchman       7
 Mdark          5
 Softlord       1

 Now I'll bet you want to see your own name up there, don't you?  All you
 have to do is find an incorrect description for a file, a mislink, etc.,
 and you can start earning your own points!  Please refer to DemoNews.105
 for more information.

 I am going to keep pushing this system, so you just better start helping
 out.  :)

 _____Other Information

 Due to multiple requests, I have asked our listserver maintainer (Pieter
 Immelman) to create a new mailing list for ALLFILES.TXT.  By subscribing to
 this, you could get regular updates of all the files on our site.  Right
 now Peiter is debating whether or not to create the list because the
 mailings would be rather large and frequent.

 This week, I was sent a 40k text file entitled "The Swiss Scene."  As a
 result of this (and several other article submissions), I could release
 DemoNews 107 and 108 today.  Needless to say, we are not hurting for
 material to put in this newsletter. :)

 I am currently learning Perl, and the utilities that produce those nifty
 00index.txt files will soon all be converted over to this language.  In
 current form, the utilities are an ugly mesh of C and shell-script code.

 You may already be familiar with the 00index.txt markers.  These take the
 form of "ASM95", "TP94", "X95", etc. (each one denoting an file from a
 given party).  A newer convention has been adopted.  For example, the file
 "ASM94:demo:1:" would refer to a demo at Assembly '94 that placed 1st.
 Sorry if this sounds confusing, but I thought I'd mention it in case you
 were wondering.

 If you ever see the words "freak" or "freaking" in this newsletter, it
 generally means that I have substituted them for less socially acceptable
 words.  :)

 _____Introduction

 First I would like to say "Hi!" to all you DemoNews readers out there.

 Okay I agree, the ASCII above is a bit lame. It's one of my tries to make
 DOS Screens look a bit nicer.  My English is also not State-of-the-art and
 that perhaps makes the whole Report a bit cheesy. But cheese fits perfectly
 in the theme that this report has. ;)

 What do I want?  Besides wasting my time writing and yours reading ;), I
 try to make the world-wide scene a bit more world-wide. This report is
 about the small country Switzerland also known as Cheeseland where at
 noontime you eat "Fundue" and "Raclette", the Money is lying on the
 streets, where the "Zytglogge", the "Kappelenbruecke", the Village "St.
 Moritz" and the Mountain "Matterhorn" is, and Japanese are running with
 their Video-Cams and Photo-Cams around like tomorrow is worlds end.

 _____About Me

 As I said above, I'm no pixler.  And I'm no musican either.  I spend my
 spare time (when I'm not hanging around with my girlfriend), hacking
 strange commands into my computer.  I'm a Coder for the Group LSP.  And
 when I'm not actually coding, I'm writing articles, texts or reports like
 this one.

 For this, I'm a member of the group TAC that wrote the word Phreaking on
 his banner.  I am relatively long in the scene, compared to many other
 swiss scene guys.  For about 3 years, I was a scene-watcher.  I just
 consumed the stuff that came out of the demo scene.  But now, the time has
 come for me to get active.

 So if you are interested in my work check out the Wired '95 Stuff.  We hope
 that we can contribute something in the PC Demo Competition.  I hope you
 have phun reading my report.

 _____Overview

 Switzerland is a small country in the middle of Europe.  The population is
 about 7 million.  The Capital of Switzerland is in the middle of the
 country and is known as Berne. It is not the biggest town in the country.
 This is the role of Zurich.  Some other cities are: Geneva (who does _not_
 know Geneva?), Basle, Lucerne and Lugano.

 Switzerland is bordered by three big countries: Germany on the north,
 France on the west, and Italy in the south-east.  Our country consequently
 has three languages (or even four if you count a "local-language"). The
 biggest is the German speaking part. It contains the capital (Berne),
 Zurich, Basle and Lucerne.  The french speaking part is Geneva, Lausanne,
 basically, the western part of Switzerland.  The Italian part of
 Switzerland is geologically in the southeast (on the other side of the
 mountains).

 The German speaking and the French speaking part are divided by the so
 called "Roestigraben".  This is because the French part tends more toward
 France and is politically more on the left side.  The Italian part is
 further from the German part than the French is, and they naturally tend to
 Italy. Okay, I don't want to give you a lesson in geography... I just
 wanted to show you the physical "layout" of Switzerland.

 _____The Report

 Now, what's interesting in the swiss "Scene"? The Swiss scene has several
 groups, some Diskmags and ... a lot of people who are talking about doing
 something.

 First, you can dividide up the groups in the following sections:

 Description                                                    Category

 Sure, you knew that before but if one newbie learns something it's enough
 ;). There are also some Trading groups but .. erm .. hey this is a _demo_
 related Zine not ElE3t WaReZ!

 _____Interview with iNVi

 Okay, here I prepared a interview for you with one of the more active
 people in the swiss scene.  He's the main coder of the group TouchForce.
 The interview was done in one session on October 12 1995, 15:00-15:50.
 Thanks to my company for putting a modem on my desk. ;)

 Q: Hello iNVi let's begin. What's your name, age and groups you're in?

 A: Ok my (real) name is Remo Inverardi. My handle and nickname is iNVi.
    I'm 19 years old and I'm in Touchforce.

 Q: What's your current occupation?

 A: I'm working as a programmer in a little software research enterprise in
    Switzerland (actually it is the biggest one in switzerland.. but hey: 40
    employees isn't too much, eh?).

    In my spare time I do quite everything related with computers (coding,
    painting, composing, BBSing, sysoping, ... you know the chunk :). I also
    do sports (skiing, football, biking).

 Q: What's your "status" in the Swiss scene?

 A: I sure belong to the Swiss coding top ten (scene-related!). In musics
    and graphics I'm still learning and my BBS is more for fun than for real
    success (I don't want to be 'Switzerland's #1').

    Some History: With 17 years I bought my first PC (before I was learning
    'how to switch my computer on' on my C64). About half a year after that
    I got my first modem (somewhat really cool: 2400bps, even capable to
    fax!) =)

    Well I called around, got to know some interesting people and finally
    called to all the so-called 'elite' boards in Switzerland. I began to
    code (PAS) and soon realized that I'd love to write my own demo. So I
    started to read some dox about ASM coding. I wrote my first little
    intros, did some utils and began to write some PPEs for some friends. So
    much about personal history.

    Besides that we (Defact, Big Bear, Jarke, Scout, Icare and me) founded
    Touchforce. Today, Touchforce is one of the most active groups in
    Switzerland (besides LSP, TAC and BLT).  We're doing some
    utils/intro/music stuff and our goal is to release a demo somewhen (we
    already did the musics, graphics and effects. But we're trying to link
    everything together a little intelligent to give the whole thing a own
    look).

 Q: What is your view of the Swiss Scene?

 A: Theoretically, the swiss scene _should_not_ be lamer than others around
    the globe. But it seems to be ;). Most of the guys are just babbling
    around all the time (just like I am doing it right now) instead of
    sitting behind their screens and doing somewhat productive.

    There was one great production since I joined the scene: The PSD-Ad
    2001. Besides demos, there were some great musics out by Silent Mode,
    lunatic great pics by Lucifer, Ansis by Jazz, Mick the Punisher and some
    other guys. Last but not least, our 'Top Pirate Coder' Chicken should be
    mentioned here (even if he didn't release anything this year expect a
    new music player for the Pain2 interface). Last year, chicken coded the
    famous HSC-Player, the well-known PPLD.EXE and the ASM-4k-Intro
    'S!P_MOVE'.

 Q: How will the scene die/live?

 A: Our most-loved thing on earth (our cheesy demo scene) will hopefully
    _never_ die. If I'm scared of something, then about the trading scene,
    but this doesn't belong to here.

 Q: In your eyes, how will the Swiss scene develop as time goes on?

 A: There are some fine 'junior' coders/musicians. If we support them and
    help them releasing their first products, they surely will become better
    than guys like I could ever be. But if you judge about their first
    products with mails like: "Hey, I've seen your intro - little lamer.
    Really bad stuff.  Why don't you buy a book about Visual Basic?!"...
    well that sure won't help ;)

 Q: What's the biggest plus in the Swiss scene ?

 A: We've got our own scene mag (Pain ][)
    We've got beautiful girlfriends (mental assistance)
    What do I know? It's small, you know nearly everybody personally!
    (some guys really became good friends to me)

 Q: What's the biggest ..... guess ;) _minus_ ...

 A: There are too many "I'm_freaking_Elite_and_you're_freaking_lame" guys
    out (they only call themselves 'elite', they aren't). Their only
    thoughts are about how they could trade their millions of ZIP files even
    faster etc etc. They don't know anything about coding, composing,
    painting...

 Q: And last but not least, who would you like to greet?

 A: All those guys in the Swiss scene that really do something productive
    and know about what's _art_ and what's _not_. Big kisses (?) to the
    following guys (in iNVish order): Chicken, Zarek, Big Bear, Silent,
    Deimos, Titanik, Psycho, Zarek, Lucifer, the whole LSP-Crew, Crocodile,
    Scout, Thorax and Patrizia (not a scene member) =)

 Q: Okay that's it, you survived it!  Thanks a lot for the interview.

 A: You're welcome. Bye.

 Q: Bye?

 A: NO CARRIER

 _____Conclusion

 Next week I will have more stuff to show you, including an interview with
 Chicken, new efforts, my view of the scene, and some advertisements.
 Hope you are enjoying this article!

=------------------------------------------------[Siggraph '96]--[Dan Wright]-=

 _____Introduction

 I consider siggraph (Special Interest Group on computer GRAPHics) the demo
 scene commercialized.  It is a specialized COMDEX where computers are used
 to show off the latest graphical/artistic software/hardware.

 _____Specifics

 Companies like Parallax, Sony, Sun, SoftImage, SGI, Adobe, NEC, Cirrus
 Logic, DEC, Kodak, IBM, and others represent themselves through products
 related to the graphical side of computers.  You will find virtual reality,
 animation, computer graphics, hardware/software products, courses,
 conferences, and lots of other ear/eye candy at this demo like convention.

 For those of us in the United States who can't attend the real demo parties
 abroad this is the next best thing--especially if you can catch all the
 computer animations.  This time Siggraph '96 is being held in New Orleans,
 Louisiana on August 4-9 1996.  Even if you are not in the "art/graphics"
 industry like me it is fun to attend just to see what the future holds.  On
 the plus side you will also see software demonstrations on how they do
 computer animation for movies like Terminator 2, Lawnmower Man, etc.

 I've been to the last two Siggraphs (in Los Angeles and Orlando) and can
 highly recommend attending one for a couple days.  Especially if you live
 within a reasonable driving distance (500 miles).  And if you do go be sure
 to register early in order to save $25 off the admission/exhibition price
 of $50 (I believe).

 _____For Demo Groups

 Siggraph has an awesome Computer Animation Festival (CAF) showing
 throughout the day and an Electronic Theater in the evening.  The CAF
 ranges from TV commercials to your standard SGI computer animated shorts.
 The Electronic Theater is only presented a few nights (1 showing), contains
 the "best of the best" in animation, and is almost always sold out.  If
 your are lucky enough you can catch the Electronic Theater showing in your
 area--for those in the South Florida area I hear it will be showing at the
 Fort Lauderdale Film Festival (early November).

 Here is where your demo groups fit in.  Siggraph '96 accepts submissions.

 From their "Call for Participation" manual I quote "In keeping with the
 SIGGRAPH '96 education theme...we are specifically seeking submissions that
 are explanatory or documentary in nature.  Potential contributors are
 encouraged to interpret this theme creatively; in addition to the
 educational, technical, and scientific visualization works that have often
 been shown in the Electronic Theater, we hope to receive explanatory
 submissions from other fields, particularly art and entertainment."

 Deadlines are April 24th, 1996 for submissions and June 16th, 1996 for
 final versions of accepted versions.  Siggraph does have this submission
 stuff on line:

 http://www.siggraph.org/conferences/siggraph96/ or
 ftp.siggraph.org

 You can also E-mail caf.s96@siggraph.org for more info on your entry.  As a
 last resort you can contact me and if you are serious I will send you the
 full packet of information (of which I have one but believe I can get
 more).

 _____Conclusion

 Don't laugh.  I've seem some demonstrations (animation) light years ahead
 of the PC (sound years ahead of the Amiga) and I've seen some animations
 that stunk.  Some of the top notch PC and Amiga groups stand a chance--
 especially if they mention "created on a 486/Amiga."  This will impress the
 hell out of the "jury" and perhaps get selected for the Computer Animation
 Rooms and/or Electronic Theater.  I'd really like to see a few groups enter
 and I wish those that have the guts to good luck.  Simply enter your groups
 best demo; no need to create something specifically for siggraph.

 Oh, and one last thing...for whatever reason, children under 16 are not
 permitted to attend the Exhibition.

 See you there...?

=--------------------------------[Scene Future After Windows '95]--[Meriadoc]-=

 _____Introduction

 When all that Windows-95 hype came closer and closer, I was doubting about
 what it would mean for the demo-scene.  Which way are we ultimately going?

 I am a computer-freak (as is said by some people, my ex-girlfriend says her
 brother (Stony) is worse). Anyway, as a computer-freak and a coder, I do
 really like the keyboard above mousing. I like mice as animals, but not
 attached to my computer.

 I am not going to have a discussion about what is better, and what is not,
 because that might be just a matter of taste. I was asking myself what the
 demoscene would do with the invasion of Windows 95.

 _____Directions We Can Go

 I think there are three different directions we can go:

   1. We make Windows 95 demos.
   2. There will be no change for the scene--we will be still use DOS.
   3. Someone will code an entire operating system for the demoscene (or use
      a pre-existing OS more suited to the needs of the scene, like Linux)

 Let's try to imagine what will happen in all three cases.

 1. Windows-95 demos:

 A demo will have to be a part of the multi-tasking system of Windows 95, and
 will act like that. It will ask for a full screen, enough memory (argh,
 swapfiles!) etc.  Perhaps someone is so crazy that he will make a demo that
 runs in a window! Finally, it should be possible to find new tricks to speed
 things up, just like in DOS.

 2. Dos-demos:

 Demos would, just like now, use the DOS-operating system to get (parts of)
 files from the harddisk. The rest will be done by the demo-itself. Things
 like protected mode and so on will be used.  But who will win, DOS4GW or
 Tran's PMODE?  :)

 3. Own system:

 I can imagine that a Win95 coder could be just as smart as Bill Gates was
 once. As I heard it was Bill Gates himself (along with some other coders)
 who programmed DOS. For its time, it was a good system. It was made for the
 computers of that day. Gates did that at the age of 20 years, so why
 couldn't a coder do that nowadays? (Just be that crazy, BG has the most
 money a person has on earth [somewhere around 12.8 billion USD].)

 The OS could run on every PC, maybe even in conjunction with Windows 95.

 I think it's possible to design a program loader that has a method of
 loading specific parts in certain memory address from every operating
 system. Even a Linux-based computer could then run a demo. The demo should
 be of some standard format, and in 1 file....  Maybe it is possible, maybe
 not...

 _____Analysis

 As you can see, I like the last option the most. But I have to be objective
 (every option has it good and it's bad).

 The first option is not all that bad. I don't like windows 95, but I think
 that you can reach more people with Windows 95 than by using DOS.  The
 demo-scene has to stay 'attractive'. If you don't adapt yourself, you will
 die out. This is important because scene members leave the scene once in
 life. Even though I say I will leave the demo-scene when I die, that's not
 realistic. There will always be need for new people in the scene. That's
 why there must be another way someday for demos to be made and run.

 The second option is too conservative, I think. Perhaps that windows 95
 will not be the success that Bill Gates guarantees, you can never tell.
 Maybe DOS will stay longer than most people think.  I personally think that
 DOS will stay for at least 5 or 10 more years. It will not die out very
 soon.

 And, if nobody has DOS anymore, I will _not_ run windows 95. I think I am
 going to run Linux by then...  If the demo-scene is staying with using DOS
 as the main operating system, I think that's a good idea.  For the moment
 it will be the only way to continue.

 But maybe someone is just that crazy as the inventor of DOS 1.0 was.  I
 don't think that one coder can do that on his own anymore, just because a
 486 is 'slightly' different than the 8088...

 It _should_ be possible to code a "portable operating system" that is
 tacked onto the demo and executes before the demo does, setting up the
 computer for the demo, and it _should_ be possible to make this work from
 any operating system.  Let me explain:

 The loader might be able to be not too big. Maybe it could contain a
 build-in protected mode handler, and a system handler that would fit for
 most of the demo-coders.

 The loader could be made for different systems, like Linux, Windows '95,
 DOS, OS/2, etc.

 _____Conclusion

 I don't know what the scene will do in the future. It might be that the
 PC-scene stays only as long as DOS stays. One never knows what is going to
 happen in the computer world. Maybe a big chip-factory creates a real great
 invention, and people change to another system in a few years; maybe the
 Windows-hype calms down, and DOS is still one of the biggest systems used.

 Computers are almost changing as fast as the weather, and factories are
 more unpredictable than the weather.  We can only wait...

 If someone has his own thoughts with this, just contact me. I will try to
 answer/react on your opinion.

 [taken from comp.sys.ibm.pc.demos]

 _____Introduction

 Well, reading the thread on "How the scene will die," I thought I could
 write a few comments on how the scene will live.

 As Trixter says, there should be more emphasis placed on the design of the
 overall demo.  While some groups are already doing this, there are those of
 us who still have a little ways to change.

 _____Observations

 I often wondered why these Amiga demos were so much "better" than PC demos.
 I've come to the conclusion that the reason why the Amiga demos are better
 in entertainment and _wow_ quality is partially because it seems that the
 Amiga demos are more "cognitive" or rather different parts are linked
 together in a way that it wouldn't seem different.

 Also the Amiga demos don't always show the brute force of the program.  The
 brute force and capability of the demo is intertwined within the music,
 graphics, and the code.  Not just twirling 3d objects around at so many
 frames a second.

 I was also thinking that demos could use outside "inspirations" like ideas
 from natural phenomenon, and not just mathematical.  I spent one night
 observing how lightning behaves during a storm and I noticed that the
 lighting bolt sort of fades out after you've seen it.  I know this isn't a
 real concrete example, but it's an illustration of what I'm saying.

 Also, we should all try to adhere to _some_ set of standards when coding a
 demo.  Standards in a sense not to say, "All demos must use XM modules for
 music," but rather one that will ensure the creativity of the demo, and not
 just objects rotating on a machine.  It seems that _anyone_ can do that
 these days.

 Also, it helps to understand the math behind certain effects.  For example,
 Nikola Tesla (a great inventor) once commented on how Thomas Edison wasted
 countless hours on figuring out how his inventions (Edison's) worked
 because he lacked some of the basic foundations of mathematical theory and
 application.

 While sometimes the math may not be easy, we should try to help one another
 out with such difficulties.  I've looked through some of OTM's math
 tutorials, and must say they're nice.  We could use more of these out
 there!  =)  Also FireLight's FMODDOC series is GREAT for learning how to
 write MOD files, and Denthor's Pascal Tutorials are good too.  These three
 are the only ones I've ran across, but I'm sure there are more.

 Also, we shouldn't be too quick to criticize a new group who's demo may not
 be "Second Reality" quality.  It isn't fair either to say someone is lame
 because they use a certain language.  While is may be true that certain
 languages aren't too ideal for demos, not everyone has the time (or
 patience) to learn assembler ... some of us started using Basic as our
 first language!

 A person also shouldn't be ridiculed if they don't have the proper hardware
 to run or code a demo.  Not everyone can afford to keep up with IBM PC CPU
 industries' mad rush to produce ever faster processors.  I've own my
 486sx/33 MHz machine for only 1.5 years, and it's already getting of date.
 I can't really afford to buy a new computer every two years!

 I think that's why the C64 scene is _still_ alive in Europe despite the age
 of the machine.  It's quite impressive I must say.  I've never owned a C64
 before but I'm curious to see some of the software for it.  I hear so many
 people talk about "how great" the machine is, and start nastalgizing over
 the games made for that system.

 _____Conclusion

 We should try to maintain some form of high standards, so we'd get more
 noticed from the "commercial" folks out there.  Not for monetary purposes,
 but for the pure reason of _respect_.  Companies like Advanced Gravis, Epic
 MegaGames and id Software for example at least acknowledge us.

 And I'll be bold to say a little that the IBM PC demo scene has to some
 degree or other _improved_ the quality of games out there for the PC.  I
 mean if some say 15 year old person can code realtime 3D phong shaded
 stuff, that means that those game companies better be working harder ...
 but demos and games are two different things (though closely related).

 I'm not sure what else to say, but those were some things I think that we
 could all do to keep the seen alive.

 _____The Quasi-Official List of Demo Hidden Parts, Keys, and Tricks

 This list is v1.00 and updated as of October 18, 1995.

 About any demo/intro with a "*?*" next to it.. if you know how to get to
 the part mentioned, email me at "vossa@rpi.edu" and I will update the list!
 Be sure to send any interactive keys, parameters, or other demo tricks as
 well!

 _____Secret Parts

 "The Accident" by Axidental (ASM '94)

   Type "accident l" to replace the first main tune with a hidden S3M made
   by LakEEE who coded and made gfx for much of the demo.  It's quite good
   compared to the rest of the music in the demo.

 "Assembler Instinct" by Gollum (Party 3) *?*

   "3 Hidden Parts. Try finding them (Only a real pro will find all)."

 "Avena Kinetik" by Distortion (1995) *?*

 "Cardiac" by Infiny (Party 3)

   Type "cardiac 187" to enter the secret part! It is some extra gfx, with a
   "musicdisk player" from which you can select any of the songs included in
   the demo.

 "Epic" by Zuul Design (1994)

   Typing "epic desing" (note the "ng" in "design") will go to the secret
   part of this demo.

 "Images" by Epical (ASM '94) *?*

 "Journey" by Keen Like Frogs (1994)

   Type "JOURNEY /HIDDEN" (all caps) to go to the hidden part.

 "No Means No" by Distortion

   Type "nomeans c" for the hidden scroller.

 "Poor" by Majic 12 (1994) *?*

 "Pseudotiny" by Fatal Justice (Bizarre '95) *?*

   Maybe they were just kidding about the hidden part. This is only a 4k
   intro!

 "Second Reality" by Future Crew (ASM '93)

   Type "second u" to go to the hidden part, which is a starfield that gets
   _really_ filled up.  This is probably the best known of the hidden parts.

 "Sehabla Routines" by Jamm (Juhla 2 '95) *?*

   "Try to launch the hidden part. hint -> 'S'"

 "Show" by Majic 12 (1994)

   You can get to the hidden part by downloading "SHOWSECR.ZIP" or
   "SECRET12.ZIP" (available on ftp.cdrom.com and probably other places).
   The picture is from the title screen of their 1993 "Wish" demo.

 "Vesisade" by Chaos (Abd. '95) *?*

 "Warp" by Legend Design (ASM '94)

   Typing "warp -esel" will take you to what looks like the end scroller,
   but talks about what Legend Design _really_ thought about Assembly '94,
   and some other things.

 _____Interactive Keys

 "Dentro" by Ultraforce (1992)

   Pressing Control, RightShift, F9, Gray Plus, then 0 will show a picture
   of the coders.  It works in the section with the scroll.

 "Flight" by Kosmic (NAID '95)

   During the first voxel-landscape:
     Arrows - Move       W - Increase altitude     S - Decrease altitude

   During the vector spaceship approaching the earth:
     Arrows - Move camera    PgUp/PgDn - Raise/lower camera
     CTRL with the above keys will rotate the ship around each axis

   If you tap a key during the second voxel part (with spaceship) you can use
   the following keys:
     Arrows - Move                     UP     - Thrust ship forward
     W      - Increase altitude        DOWN   - Thrust ship backward
     S      - Decrease altitude        CTRL and UP   - Zoom into ship
     +      - increase movement speed  CTRL and DOWN - Zoom away from ship
     -      - decrease movement speed  PgUp/PgDn     - Raise/lower camera
     R      - Rotate camera around the ship
     F      - Rotate camera in opposite direction

   During the seagull credit sequence:
     F1/F2/F3 - Low/Medium/High ground detail

 "HeartQuake" by Iguana (ASM '94)

   During the Comanche-landscape part:
     Arrow keys (gray) - fly around         A - restart
     PgUp/PgDn (gray) - change altitude     D - toggle low/high detail

   Also, the Space bar skips each part.

 "NewIntro" by Majic 12 (1993)

   Press the Up Arrow key during the airplane part to play a game.

 "Why" by Adrar Design (CAF '95) *?*

   "Try to find secret key and fly during comanche part of intro."

 _____Command-line Parameters

 "Facts of Life" by Witan (Party 2)

   Like with Second Reality, you can run "witan p#" to get to a specific
   part of the demo.  I think "p5" is the house-techno part.

 "Images" by Epical (ASM '94)

   "DATA SPACE" (all caps) starts the demo at the Space part.
