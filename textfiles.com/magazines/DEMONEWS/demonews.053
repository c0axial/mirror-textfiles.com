((Section 1...Standard Info))
==============================================================================
    DemoNews is a weekly publication dedicated to the demo scene.  It is
produced at the Internet FTP site ftp.eng.ufl.edu.  One of the servers at
this site used to be called "WASP," however the ftp server was recently moved
to HORNET (another machine, same place) so I guess it can now be called
"HORNET."  This newsletter focuses on all aspects of demos and demo-making 
(including music, art, and coding).

There are currently three active demo-operators at this site:
     
     Dan Wright (Pallbearer) - dmw@inca.gate.net
     Christopher G. Mann (Snowman) - r3cgm@dax.cc.uakron.edu
     Mike - weis@elf.stuba.sk

     We are currently looking for an artist to handle some of the art files.
Qualifications include: high level of experience with the graphics aspect
of the demo scene, many contacts, and reliability.  If you fit all three of
these characteristics, then drop us a note if interested.  In addition to
an artist we could REALLY use some help with the demo reviews.

    This site is mirrored by the following ftps:
         ftp.uwp.edu
         ftp.luth.se
         ftp.sun.ac.za
         ftp.uni-erlangen.de
         ftp.uni-paderborn.de

If you would like to receive a new copy of Demo News every Sunday in your
mailbox, just write to dmw@eng.ufl.edu.  We delete all bounced mail from this
service, so if you SHOULD BE getting Demo News and ARE NOT, please re-request
this newsletter.

NICE DIRECTORY ASSHOLE:

Some nice fellow "@infotech.infomx.com" (or so our info.log stated)
was nice enough to create a "  "/? directory within our incoming directory.  
Well, I disabled and renamed the incoming directory because I CAN NOT DELETE 
DIRECTORIES with FILES in THEM.  For those who do not know directories
like "SPACE" and "..." usually are usually associated with PIRATED wares.
Of course Mr. infotech's intentions could have been sincere but I doubt it.

US PARTY:  HACK ATTACK '94

Can't make assembly '94? :(  Well, cheer up cause a week later you can
always check out HOPE.

Imagine if you will a US demo party in New York City on August 13th and
August 14th.  This is the same weekend HOPE--Hackers On Planet Earth--
and WOODSTOCK '94 take place!  Now, imagine having the DEMO party at the
same place as the HACKER CONVENTION--Hotel Pennsylvania.  

I could imagine such a conference and being in NEW YORK this could draw
a ton of people (air fares are about < $200 for people like me in Florida).
Lets look into our crystal ball at what we could expect.

A couple rooms could be reserved for the few demo people interested in
showing up with general meetings happening on the first day and demo comps
happening on day two--Sunday.  And what about prizes?  Well, I figure first
place winners should get some kind of semi-automatic weapon--may come in
handy on your way to the airport--, second place could get a stun gun, and
the third place winner could get a nice KNIFE from "The Edge."  Of course
I am implying our country is a bit violent and I think most would probably
feel safe on there way out of the "big apple."  Hey, I work in Miami and
we hear/see violence everyday on the news...it is OUT THERE.  But lets
get serious.  Would such a party DRAW people?  Would it work?  Maybe 
everybody could write Renaissance and get them to work with 2600 and
arrange a room or two for such a "party."  Remember, Renaissance members
live in New York...most of them anyways.

 TASTE OF AMIGA (Main Feature)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Well, I have spent numerous hours downloading music files from the
Amiganet (also known as Aminet), and have put together a couple packs of what
I consider the best and/or most unique tunes I found.  There are also a couple
of pictures of some renouned Amiga musicians included.
        These are, without exception, all 4-channel Protracker style MOD
files.  Dispite the advent of formats like MED and FTM, some Amiga musicians
still harken to the dark days of computer music history when 4 channels was a
lot and a sampling rate of 22050hz was unheard of.  These songs, at least in
some part, will discourage the notion that MODs are dead.  Just go download
and kick 'em around a bit.

 COMPOSER'S COMPETITION (Will this thing not die?!)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"
From daredevi@dorsai.dorsai.org Tue Jul 12 11:21:32 1994

I would appreciate it if you would include this in an upcoming DEMONEWS or
something, because I really feel it was unfair of you to go including OUR
names in your commentary, and made it look like it was our fault that this
contest was not done.

----

Snowman,
        
        In response to your commentary on Compoer Competition 1 I would like
to make a few statements about our involvement. First off, we are not
affiliated with that competition in any way past our duties as judges and my
board as a distribution site. Secondly, I've contacted Mike Phillips a
number of times in the past and he was going to call me when the competition
was over to send me the voting forms or whatever. He called me about a month
ago and I wasn't home. I figured he would call back, but he never did. I
assumed something had happened with the compo so I just decided to wait
until he called me again some time. I was not even aware that Digital
Oxygene had gone down until after reading your commentary. I'm not blaming
Mike, because he was probably busy with alot of things. But this competition
has gotten a little out of hand. The bottom line here is, we never received
the voting forms and by now everyone here in the group is really sick of
this competition because it really never became the event that some had
hoped it to be. Please redirect all flames to /dev/null because I am not
going to answer any more mail regarding this subject. Thanks...

                                        [-] Daredevil/Renaissance [-]
                                        daredevil@dorsai.dorsai.org
"

        Also, I (Snowman) discovered this week that Mike Phillips DOES NOT
have the Gravis Ultrasound that was mentioned as the prize for Composers
Competition.  Apparently, Gravis/Forte made a deal with Mike that he would
send them the name of the winner to the contest and Gravis/Forte would send
that winner the GUS card; so Mike is clear on this one.
        An idea has been brought to my attention by several people, and I
am now going to officially announce it (it will also be in mc2upd3.zip).
Have you wondered what is going to happen to all of the CC1 entries now that
it appears the contest will not be completed?  How would you like to enter
your CC1 entry into Music Contest ][?  Well, NOW YOU CAN.  On the outside
chance that CC1 does finish up, I am going to say that you can't enter a
CC1 entry of yours into MC][ until August 17th (two weeks before the end of
MC][).  This way, if CC1 finishes, you still have time to put something
together.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 MUSIC CONTEST ][
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Guess what?  Snowman is in a bit of trouble this week.  MC2UPD2 was
supposed to go out at the beginning of this month, but every time Snowman
would finish it up, someone else would send in a judge application or upload
an entry.  I am going to release the current MC2UPD2.TXT which does not
contain changes for the past 3 days or so.  I WILL try to get MC2UPD3.TXT
out by the first of next month.
        I now have 6 official entries and 2 unofficial ones for the contest,
and things seem to be going well.
        I finally figured out how to post to USENET newsgroups this week, but
did not know anything about "cross-posting" (I posted an article in about 8
newsgroups).  One very emotional individual showed me the error of my ways.
While I am not all together happy with the method he used to tell me I was
wrong, I accept the fact and will try to brush up on USENET etiquite.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 CAMUG (Canton/Akron/Massilon Users Group)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        On Saturday July 16th, 1994, I am giving a presentation for a local
computer club.  There are 50 people expected to attend and I must keep their
attention for a couple of hours.  I'll talk about demos, intros, trackers,
players, "eLiTe" and "lame", Amiga's role in the scene, and of course will
finish the show with Second Reality.
        A co-worker of mine invited me to do this.  Luckily, at work we have
this really cool full-color overhead projection system that hooks in right
where your monitor cable goes.  I tested it with ASM94_1 intro to make sure
the screen refresh rate was fast enough, and I think it will work.  I'm
wondering now if that part in Second Reality with the pink lines that blink
to the music and zip around REALLY fast will be too fast for the system.  I
guess only time will tell.
        I am VERY nervous about this presentation.
        I'll let you know how it went next DemoNews.

==============================================================================
((Section 5...Demo CD))
==============================================================================

Check /pub/msdos/demos/incoming/democd for UPDATES and information.
(i.e. More information, cost, how to get the DEMO/MC][ CD)

I will try to upload a list of WANTED demos and what demos we already
have for the CD next week.  If you have a BBS perhaps you can upload
a list of the demos you have so I can compare.

ART:

We are looking for artist to design the ART for the CD's inserts.  Pay
will be 10-100 copies of your ART (worth $5-$50).  It all depends on the
cost/min press run.  If we have to run 1000 you get a ton of your art in
FULL color or whatever we decide to use.  (Most likely Full color for
the front and back of the book and possibly for the insert).

DAT:

We are going to need to borrow or find someone with access to DAT player
to help us master our music for the CD.

==============================================================================
((Section 6...Advertisements))
==============================================================================

Anyone got anything they might want others to know/see?  Let us know.

==============================================================================
((Section 7...Top 25 Downloads))
==============================================================================

Well, the info.log (aka ftp.syslog) is 34 megs on this site and dates back
to early July.  If I attemped to create a TOP25DL I would definitly DUMP
"core."  So, I'll just wait till the log gets reset before I do another
TOP25DL.

==============================================================================
