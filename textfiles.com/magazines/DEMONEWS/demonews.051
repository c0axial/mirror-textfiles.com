GENERAL STUFF
*************

Composers CONTEST...anyone...anyone.  Maybe we should call the organizer
and record the conversation then post it here.  What do you think--there
is suppose to be a GUS to the winner.  I'm going to sixth the dir soon.

TOP25DL is now correct.  Check it out in the /news directory.  I can not
mail it to you yet because of linking problems between computers.

Some files in the "alpha" directory will be renamed to their proper DEMO
name so be aware of this if you are searching for a demo in the coming
weeks.  (i.e. dzdebcde.lzh  will be renamed debute, dust_unt.zip will
be renamed untitled.zip).

feraraw@iia.org asked: 
Do you have the way to get to the secret part of Poor_12 yet???
Does anyone know the answer?

Please try not to OVER DUE comments within the /incoming directory--
mainly stuff like "this demo sucks shit" or "we rule or something like that"
are the things we can do without.  Mentioning CORRUPT files and general
TEXT files are very helpful.

Can anyone get reduced/free tickets to SIGGRAPH in Orlando?  (Info can
be found at siggraph.org /conferences/sig.../advan... )

DEMO CD INFO
------------

I set up a new directory within the /incoming structure called "DEMO_CD."
This directory is to be used for stuff that will go in or on the DEMO CD
including:  

  A) Classic (old) demos not currently on this internet site.
  B) Music which can't be entered into MC][ which you feel should belongs
     on the DA (digital audio) portion of the CD.  (Only a couple songs
     besides MC][ will be "mastered")
  C) Art for the CD/COVER/INSERT.  We are looking for BW/2 color/full color.
     Anyone can submit art and there is no definition as to what it has
     to be at this time.
  D) Group interviews/info that are not mailed directly to me.

We still seek help with mastering the music onto DAT as we do not own
a DAT player.  If you can help please contact Snowman or myself.

Check out "demo_cd.txt" (I think it is called) within the directory to
learn more about the project.

A CHANCE FOR $
**************

This was uploaded to the demosite so I've decided to place it here
for those who may be interested but did not download this file.

Custom Programming Request:
------------------------------------------------ -   -     -       -
   The Center for Sustainable Cities at the University of Kentucky is 
looking for a small group of graphics programmers to complete a custom
program.  The program would involve the folowing:
 
* It must be able to load extremely large .dxf (Drawing eXchange Format)
   files and fly through them (via the 3D Cyberman Joystick).  
 
* It would need to be displayed at at least 25fps (frames per second), and
   would need to be textured and lightsourced.
 
* It would be in the form of two modules; one would allow you to fly 
   through and place the textures, and the second would simply allow
   you to fly through (with the textures determined in the first module).
 
* The program must be in 256 color VGA, or if possible in 256 color SVGA.
 
   If you are interested or have any questions please contact: 
 
                       paguru02@ukcc.uky.edu. 
 
   Please mention a price and an estimate about how long it will take to 
complete...
 
Thank You.
