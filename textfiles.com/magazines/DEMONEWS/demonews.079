_____Contributions to DemoNews

 DemoNews is an "open" publication and it is designed to provide a detailed
 look at the demo, music, code, and art scenes on a weekly basis. We would
 really like to see more people contributing articles to DemoNews with
 reviews, interviews, commentaries, promotions, and advertisements.  Anyone
 can submit an article for DemoNews, and it will probably be printed.
 DemoNews is a fantastic way to get yourself heard.

 As you may have seen from the current list of the subscribers, DemoNews is
 initially distributed to well over 1100 people on Internet. In addition,
 DemoNews makes its rounds to hundreds of BBSs around the world. I would not
 be surprised if DemoNews had a final distribution of 5000 to 10,000 readers
 around the world.

 Currently, most of the articles in DemoNews are from the HORNET team which
 consists of Christopher Mann, Ryan Cramer, Stony, Denthor, etc. However, to
 get a more broad look at the scene, we'd like YOU to write some stuff for
 demonews too! :) If your interested, mail either me (Ryan Cramer) or
 Christopher Mann at one of the following addresses:

 Ryan Cramer - rcramer1@osf1.gmu.edu - BBS (703) 847-0861 or (703) 506-8598
 Christopher Mann - r3cgm@dax.cc.uakron.edu

_____Small Issue

 Finally we have a small issue.  We decided it would be nice for a change to
 have a compact issue rather than a super-huge special issue.  Consider it a
 resting period before DemoNews.080.  :)

_____Please Upload

 In reviewing files from /alpha/NEW, we found 3 that were broken.  Would
 someone please re-upload: bbsintro.zip, chslumi.zip, and happy95.zip

_____Suggestion from a DemoNews Reader

 Samer Meshreki from the University of Delaware recently asked if we could
 move the "New Uploads" section of this newsletter closer to the beginning.
 We have done so.  As just a general reminder to all readers of DemoNews, we
 highly encourage suggestions and comments in order to make this a better
 guide for the demo scene.

_____Eratta

 1. In the new uploads section, the intro "Grey" was listed as being done by
 "Grey/Abaddon".  The author should have been listed just as "Abaddon".
 2. In the interview with Maxwood, his name was incorrectly listed as "Anal
 Tamas".  It should have been "Antal Tamas".

_____A Day in the Life of Snowman
     Christopher G. Mann - Demo Maintainer

 Did you ever wonder what goes into producing DemoNews and maintaining
 HORNET?  This little editorial will take you through a typical day of mine.
 This article doesn't really have much to do with the demo scene in general,
 so feel free to skip it if this does not interest you.  This issue is
 fairly small so I figured I had nothing to loose by putting in a shameless
 bio of myself in here.  :)

 Background:

 My name is Christopher G. Mann.  I was born on April 4, 1975 and I am 19
 years old.  I reside in Akron, Ohio in the mid-western United States.  This
 is my second year at the University of Akron and I am currently enrolled in
 the Computer Science program.  My weight is about 145lbs (65.7kg) and my
 height is 6'0" (1.83 meters).  Overall, I look like a very serious skinny
 guy.  A recent change in my appearance has been to let my hair grow in the
 back.

 I live an apartment about half a kilometer off campus.  It is split into
 top and bottom floors, each of which can accommodate two people.  Down-
 stairs live Duncan and Alistair (did I spell that right?), a couple British
 students who are also attending the University of Akron.  I rarely see them
 as our apartments are not connected (there is a door from each to the out-
 side).  On my floor are two bedrooms and a shared kitchen, bathroom, and
 small entryway.

 However, the last roommate I had recently moved away and half of my apart-
 ment has been completely vacant for about a month.  The spring semester
 here at the University has already begun and I do not know how likely it is
 that I will get a new roommate will be here anytime soon (most students
 already have a place to live by this point).  Leaving the bathroom door
 open all the time is just one of the many perks I currently have.

 My mother lives in New Philadelphia (about 60 kilometers south) and my
 father lives in Magnolia (about 60 kilometers south-east).  I usually call
 them once or twice a week to keep them happy, but only see them infre-
 quently.  I have no brothers or sisters and have a very small family in
 general.  For the most part I am perfectly content to be alone for long
 periods of time.

 I have two big addictions: Swisher Sweets little cigars, and black coffee.
 In a typical day I will smoke between 1/2 to 3/4 a pack of cigars, and
 drink about 4 cups of coffee.  However, I also drink about a gallon of
 water a day to flush my system.  Needless to say, my toilet gets a workout.

 My financial situation is very bad.  Most of the time I have to cook pasta
 or something just to conserve money.  Believe it or not, the cigars and
 coffee also make me less hungry.  Food costs money so this is a plus.
 Unfortunately, this has also been a contributing factor to the loss of 15
 pounds (7kg) in the past few months.

 Overall, I am an efficient and organized person who likes to get things
 done.  I do not have much of a social life and I am very happy to leave it
 that way.  Dating and getting together with friends is something I enjoy,
 just not too often.  Friends, girlfriends and family may come and go, but
 knowledge and experience stay with you forever.

 My Day:
 
 Almost without exception, I do three things every day when I wake up: light
 up a cigar, check my e-mail, and go to the bathroom.  Depending on how much
 water and coffee I had to drink the night before, the order may be slightly
 different from day to day.  In general I have between 5 and 15 new mails
 waiting for me that were received during the night.  I could actually break
 down the mail into several defined categories.

 First there is listserver mail.  This consists of subscription and unsub-
 scription notifications, bounced DemoNews copies (which I forward to
 someone else to be processed), and mail from people requesting personal
 help with the listserver.

 Second is the "please help me" type of mail.  A few typical topics are: "I
 uploaded something on HORNET that was corrupt...", "We are from the new
 group X and were wondering if we could have our own directory on HORNET",
 and "How can I use a SB with demo X...".  Usually this mail doesn't eat up
 too much of my time.  I either fix the file, deny a group directory, or
 forward music-related mail to Ryan Cramer to be answered.

 Third and most time consuming is the personal mail.  Dee-Cug and Jester
 (two of my friends) are probably responsible 15% of the total time I spend
 on mail alone.  Every once in a while I get a letter from Dan Potter,
 Krystall, Vic, or some other friend which I reply to.  This type of mail is
 also my main way of keeping up with gossip.

 The forth type of mail is Dan Wright's.  Even though the dmw@eng.ufl.edu is
 not the way to reach him anymore, I still get about 2-3 letters per week
 that I forward to him.

 Last is DemoNews-related mail.  This includes articles, advertisements,
 suggestions, interviews, comments, and feedback on the newsletter.  When I
 don't get much of this type of mail (such as this week) DemoNews ends up
 being rather small.

 Anyway, back to my day.  Usually I can answer and take care of about 60% of
 the mail I got overnight in about 10-15 minutes.  The rest I keep in my
 mailbox to be answered in more depth later.  As it happens, my cigar just
 about finishes up after this 10-15 minutes, so I go and hop in the shower.

 The late-morning / early-afternoon period is my recreational time.  I might
 call up a friend to come over and watch demos, go to the mall, or catch a
 movie (this is during winter break).  If I do not get together with anyone
 then I start on my night-time schedule (next paragraph).  During normal
 school, my day time is spent in class.

 At about 17:00 I sit down at my computer and remain there until I go to bed
 (02:00-05:00 during winter break).  By this time another 5-10 new mails are
 waiting for me.  The first thing I do is take care of HORNET business.  I
 will hop online and see if anything interesting has been posted.  At this
 point I also try to fix corrupted uploads, delete old files, and move files
 from /programming to /code.  I also check and see how big the
 /incoming/music directory is so I know how much work Ryan has to do the
 coming weekend.

 About an two hours each night is spent trying to fix up the formatting of
 DemoNews, improve the efficiency of HORNET, and work on other HORNET-
 related projects.  It is my goal to make HORNET the best demo site on the
 Internet and I place high priority on this task.

 After all important HORNET stuff is taken care of, I get offline and
 program.  Denthor's "Demo Programmer's Trainer" is a series I have been
 working on for a while.  This job is simple enough (convert Pascal source
 code to C++) but it is time consuming.  It is my goal to have enough
 experience to do something decent for NAID and I have increased the time I
 spend coding accordingly.

 When it gets really late and my mind goes fuzzy, I hop on IRC for about 15
 minutes to a half hour.  This is a great way to promote HORNET, get sub-
 scriptions for DemoNews, hear new gossip, and exchange ideas about code and
 music.

 When I finally go to bed, I fall asleep immediately.  I may not get enough
 sleep, but I do not waste time lying awake in bed.

 In Summary:

 This type of article is not one I encourage for DemoNews.  Biographies and
 personal information should be left with IRC and e-mail, not put into a
 public newsletter.  However, this editorial may have shed some light for
 you on what the Demo Maintainer is like.  Above all else, I believe in
 efficiency and organization.  It has been my goal to have HORNET and
 DemoNews reflect those beliefs.

 ===========================================================================
 This week's music section consists of a review on Zero-G's Ambient Volume
 One Sample CD. Sorry that we don't have a very large issue this week, but
 we're sort of taking a breather from last weeks 110k issue (pant pant).

 Well, now that The Party '94 is over, the demoscene will probably be kind
 of quiet for awhile. It seems these days that the only major productions
 are released at demoparties (particularly ASM'94 and TP'94). I kind of wish
 that the PC scene had more major parties. Hopfully this will happen in the
 future. I'm anxious to see how everything goes with this party thats taking
 place in Canada called NAID.

 Anyways, on with the review of Zero-G's Ambient sample CD. For those of you
 that are not familiar with Sample CD's, here's a little background
 information. Sample CDs are simply Compact Disks filled with samples of
 various sounds, instruments, backgrounds, and such. These samples are
 useful to musicians because these samples are generally sounds that we
 would not otherwise be able to obtain. Often, sample CDs contain sounds
 from rare synthesizers or perhaps original drumloops and percussion sounds.
 The possabilities for sample CDs are limitless. Because sample CDs are not
 widely produced, nor are they in especially large demand, they are quite
 expensive. As an example, my Ambient CD set me back $100. Despite this
 fact, its a LOT cheaper then buying a synth that might only have half of
 the amount of samples a sample CD would have. Sample CDs are a good deal
 for many of us - they especially make a lot of sense for musicians using a
 tracker; you can simply sample the sound directly from the CD and use it in
 your music. Sample CDs typically contain around 100 tracks with 3 to 15
 samples per track. There are of course many exceptions to this, but as you
 can see, there are a LOT of samples on these CDs.

 The best place to get sample CDs from is a company called EastWest. They
 carry the world's largest selection of sampled sounds on CD. To get a copy
 of their catalog, or to order CDs from them, call their 800 number, or mail
 them at the following address:

 In USA        : 1-800-833-8339
 Outside USA   : 1-310-858-8797

 EastWest/SoundWarehouse
 Suite 277, Maple Plaza
 345 North Maple Drive
 Beverly Hills, CA 90210, USA

 If you'd like to see an advertisement from EastWest that would have more
 information than is included here, pick up a copy of Keyboard magazine at
 your nearest bookstore. Keyboard magazine also includes other resources of
 sample CDs and tapes.

 The Ambient/1 CD comes with a large booklet describing each of its 99
 tracks and the individual samples that make up each track. The outside of
 the CD jewelbox says:

 --begin--
 The Ambient/Atmospheric/Soundtrack Sample CD.

 Fantastic array of dreamy atmospherics and effects for use in ambient
 dance, film soundtrack work, or futuristic & spacey music of all kinds. A
 goldmine of analogue sounds and techniques from the early days of the
 synthesizer. Includes: Synth waveforms, FX and textures from early synths
 e.g. Roland Modular System 100M, VCS3, rare ethnic percussion, natural
 environmental atmospheres, superb audio quality, fully indexed, etc, etc.
 --end--

 That description pretty well summarizes the CD. It really is a great
 collection. However, its pretty hard to describe sounds without hearing
 them, so I've included some FastTracker 2 .XI instruments that I sampled
 from the CD, they can be found on:

 If you do not have internet or ftp access, you can also get a copy of this
 file RC_SAMPS.ZIP on Data Connection BBS at (703) 506-8598 or (703)
 847-0861. The file is 818k.

 The archive includes the following samples:

 ambient1.xi - Inharmonic Loop 3
 ambient2.xi - Banshee
 ambient3.xi - Alien Wind
 ambient4.xi - Click Bubbles
 ambient5.xi - Jet Flange 2
 ambient6.xi - Sequence Atmosphere 2
 ambient7.xi - 7 Various Waveforms, using FT2 split keyboard
 ambient8.xi - 8 Ethnic Percussion sounds, using FT2 split keyboard
 ambient9.xi - Atmosphere Wailings
 ambientA.xi - Atmosphere Train 1
 ambientB.xi - Synth FX Wobble
 ambientC.xi - Ambient FX Aquaphone
 ambientD.xi - Ambient FX Marine
 ambientE.xi - Mmmm Drone
 ambientF.xi - Growl Vox
 ambientG.xi - Hot Mud

 All of the sounds are sampled at 22050 khz (8 bit) in FastTracker 2 using a
 Gravis Ultrasound. Feel free to use any of them in your music if you'd
 like. Since some of the samples are very large, they might require editing
 before use though. Keep in mind that this is a VERY small selection of the
 samples on the Ambient CD as it contains well over 400 sounds compared to
 the 17 included here. In addition, I *didn't* attempt to record all of the
 "best" sounds from the CD, I just tried to get a good selection. As a
 result, hopfully this will give you a good general idea of just whats on
 the Ambient CD as opposed to my favorite sounds on the CD. :)

 Note that these instrument files can only be loaded into FastTracker 2.
 They can easily be converted to other formats by loading them into FT2 and
 saving them again.

 The Ambient CD really has a lot of fantastic and dreamy sounds in it. It
 also has a lot of strange analog sounds too - some of the sounds, I don't
 think that I would ever use. Overall, the sounds are quite good and VERY
 high quality. In the booklet that was included with the CD, here is what it
 said in regards to the sound quality: "Every effort has been made to obtain
 the highest sound quality by compiling and mastering the sounds digitally.
 However, some of the old analogue sounds may have some inherent noise, as
 well as some tape hiss being evident on some of the old tape delay/loop
 atmospheres. Equalisation has been applied to minimise extraneous noise
 wherever possible and it is felt that the best possible sound quality has
 been obtained with what, after all, are some fairly unique sounds which are
 by and large unreproducable on modern day equipment."

 The Ambient/1 CD could also be very useful for someone that wants to record
 sounds for use in a video game. Many of the analog sounds sound like they
 are straight out of PacMan or something. :) In addition, while I was in
 CompUSA today, on one of the demo computers, they were playing some game. I
 was just standing there looking around, but then I heard something
 familiar. It turned out that many of the sounds from this game were
 actually samples from the Ambient/1 CD. :)

 The Ambient/1 CD also includes a number of cool percussion sounds. Most of
 them are quite rare and a creative musician could do some very cool stuff
 with them. There are no heavy or industrial percussion sounds, most sound
 very ethnic and mellow. In regards to the included percussion sounds, here
 is what the Ambient/1 booklet said: "The selection given here is not
 intended to be a totally comprehensive range of sounds but rather a more
 select choice of unusual and interesting drums/percussion as well as some
 different ways of playing more familiar instruments. Have fun. The majority
 of the sounds were specifically programmed for this disc. Think of the 700+
 sounds as a giant jig-saw puzzle that can be combined in as many different
 ways as your imagination allows and above all have fun in creating your own
 personal sound pictures."

 While the Ambient/1 CD includes many rare sounds, because this CD is so
 popular in the trance/ambient/techno industry, these sounds aren't so rare
 anymore. I was in Tower Records yesterday, and I listened to a Future Sound
 of London CD that they had headphones hooked up to. I found the some of the
 sounds were very familiar and were in fact directly from Ambient/1. In
 addition, I've noticed a couple of Amiga MOD musicians using samples from
 the Ambient/1 CD.

 In summary, I'd have to conclude that the Ambient/1 CD is well worth the
 $100 that it costs if your interested in doing ambient, trance, ethnic,
 newage, or just plain "different" music. For me, this CD was just about
 perfect, and I plan to make use of these sounds in the future. Zero-G also
 makes Ambient/2 which I hope to purchase in the future.

 For all tracker musicians out there, take advantage of sample CDs and start
 using some samples that haven't been used in other songs before. There is a
 great sense of satisfaction and accomplishment when you create a song that
 uses sounds that you have sampled. In addition, your music will obviously
 sound much more original. Order the catalog from EastWest and take a look
 at all of the great sample CDs which are available. These sample CDs are so
 easy to sample from and it seems like they're practically designed to go
 hand in hand with tracked music. However, be careful when purchasing sample
 CDs, they are expensive and you should be sure that what you are getting
 will provide a practically inexhaustable resource of samples for your
 music. If any of you reading this article also have sample CDs, I'd
 encourage you to write up a small review of the CD to let other people know
 how it is.

 Hope you enjoyed the review, and have a good week!

_____Where's the Sound Blaster?

 Hello all!  I'm the SysOp of a demo oriented BBS in Brazil and I try to do
 some coding in my free time (not too much lately though).  Always when you
 ask a demo group that started with the amiga demo scene why they went to
 the pc scene you get the same answer : coding demos for amiga is too
 easy...

 Looking at the results of The Party 94 I saw that too many demos have GUS-
 only support.  This is very bad!  Ok, I know that the GUS has very good
 sound quality and coders prefer to do their player routines for GUS. The
 question is : WHY do they do it?  Maybe it's because it's easier to do a
 player for GUS than for SB (but isn't difficulty a motivation for a real
 coder?), but SB is a world standard.  I know GUS is spreading out but it's
 very difficult to find people with a GUS outside Europe, and I think here
 in Brazil and in most parts of the world, SB (and its clones) are the
 "default" sound board for all people.

 All of you know that a demo without music is like orange juice without an
 orange :-)  So I ask all the coders around the world to at least keep SB
 compatibility in their demos.. don't forget us poor SysOps and users that
 only have a SB (or one of the many many SB compatible cards)...

 Yes, I know that Creative Labs is making the life of all coders more
 difficult by limiting the programming information about SB.  I still have
 no idea why they do this and I feel there is no good reason.  This is a
 point on which Gravis/Forte is very good. They at least give a lot of
 programming information about their sound cards.

 Hope I will can hear music in the next demos through my Sound Blaster!

 Ok, it's my opinion...

 GREETS to ALL !!!!

_____TP94 Graphics Competition Review

 [This is a copy of an article Stony sent me last week which I forgot to
 include in The Party 1994 special issue.]

 (From the Party Place)

 The Graphics Competition should have started at 02:00 on the 29th of
 December but according to a message it was delayed until 02:30.  This seems
 ok to me, but... at 03:30 still nothing was shown on the screen so everyone
 started to yell, clap their hands, and scream.  Then at 03:40 it finally
 was ready.  A total of 150 pictures were submitted to the competition but
 only 62 were selected to be shown.  I think that its bit weird that not all
 the delivered stuff can be shown because that is what a "competition" is
 all about.

 What I heard from most of the graphicians is that the more time you put in
 a picture the nicer it will be. I have been working on mine for some hours
 but I didn't have the time to make something spectacular out of it, I
 didn't even have a nice background.

 The organization has just now decided to show all delivered pictures.
 Everybody should be satisfied now.  Well, again it didn't work out because
 the system has failed again. :(

 A lot of pictures have been redrawn from existing artwork. Some of the
 graphics are raytraced, others re-done from existing art, and still others
 were re-released from Assembly '94 in this competition!  This is a weird
 assortment.  Apparently, only 99 pics can be voted on because no allowance
 was made for a higher number of pictures.

              --- The Party '94 Graphics Competition Results ---

      Nr. Name                           Group                   Points
       1. Helgi Schneider................Peachy / Masque          239
       2. AH. Self D.....................Ra / Sanity              202
       3. Vampire........................Mirage / Bonzai          187
       4. Self Portrait..................Dize / Silents DK        161
       5. Digital Modelling..............Luma / P5 Crew           144

 (In Retrospect)

 It must have been really hard to come up with the final results because
 most of the graphics were very good.  As a result, the decision as to which
 is best is really a matter of personal taste.

 A lot of great pictures were shown, the best I have ever seen. I couldn't
 manage to do a review on them, only having seen them once on the big
 picture screen. However, as soon as I get all these pictures then I'll do a
 review on them.

                                                         ...Stony and Meriadoc

        Bass Productions, an American-based quality music group has been in
existence for a little less than a year. In that time, unfortunately, not
much has happened for or with the music group. Due to terrible local
standards, and only recent internet access, member growth and music
releasing has been low. We are looking for quality musicians with somewhere
to go. Unlike our "partner" group Epinicion Music, we are not seeking
inexperienced musicians nor do we want to gain 10 zillion members this month
alone ;). We simply are looking to improve our output and perhaps gain some
contacts along the way. We believe that we have some talent, and if you
would like to become part of this well-meaning organization, you can reach
me, or any member at the following :

_____How to Get 'em

 After reading this issue of DemoNews, you may be wondering how you can get
 previous ones.  Well fear not!  There are two different ways to do so:

 1: FTP to hornet.eng.ufl.edu and go to /pub/msdos/demos/news/OLD_NEWS and
    start downloading anything you see.

 2: Now you can request back issues of DemoNews via e-mail.  Start a letter
    to listserver@oliver.sun.ac.za (any subject line) and in the body of the
    letter include "GET DEMUAN-LIST <INDEX>" where INDEX refers to the
    index number of the issue.

    For example:  GET DEMUAN-LIST 43

    This would retrieve DemoNews #76 (part 1 of 2).

    For more recent issues that are split into multiple parts, you must send
    an individual request for each index number.
