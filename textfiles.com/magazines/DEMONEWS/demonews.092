 IMPORTANT!!!

 Today, a file called clxmag.zip was uploaded to few finnish scene boards.
 It claims to be a "magtro" by Complex, but actually it tries to destroy
 your hard disk.  I haven't yet studied it, but I'll do it tonight...

 File is about 44k, and has following text in FILE_ID.DIZ:

 -------------------------------
        CoMPLEX
                   MaGINTRO
 -------------------------------
       jmagic/jugi/reward

 Needless to say, I did not code this.

 All sysops of BBSes delete this file, and if you see it in internet, please
 tell ftp admins to delete it.

=---------------------[Introduction]--[Snowman, GraveDigger, and White Noise]-=

 SM: Hello all, and welcome to the 92nd issue of DemoNews.
 GD: Christopher, it's sure good to see Jeff here with us! Where the heck
     have you been, Jeff?    
 WN: Hmmm... lost myself in real life somewhere...    
 SM: That seems to happen to a great many in the scene at one time or
     another.  Anyway, what articles do we have lined up this week GD?
 GD: Well, our first article is called "One-Track Minds" and was written
     by me. It's about how people can get hostile with their opinions.
     After that, another article by me titled "Generation Gaps."
 SM: Is that about Star Trek...
 WN: ...or the gap between Trixter and I and you guys? :)
 GD: No, silly! It's about the parents of kids in the demo scene. Sort of.
     Ya know, Jeff, you're not *that* old, or are you?
 WN: nah... age-wise no, but scene-wise yes...
 GD: Ah well. In that case, pass me my pacifier.
 SM: But I don't live with my parents anymore!  How does the article
     apply to me?
 GD: Well, Snowman, maybe you can relate to it from earlier experiences.
     And think about your kids! What if they truly master 7800 polys in a
     demo?
 SM: Speaking of 7800 polys, I just made my own metal shaded dolphin.
     Actually it isn't metal shading, its tiny vector balls!
 WN: ... pray that comment doesn't bring hate-mail.
 GD: Ok, what's the next article? Christopher, what kind of mail do we
     have in the mailroom this week?    
 SM: Well GraveDigger, that's a very good question.  I think we have a
     letter from the ftp.mpoli.fi dudes about getting descriptions with ftp.
 GD: That sounds like an interesting piece of mail.. Jeff, do you ever get
     hate-mail?
 WN: Not to my knowledge...    
 GD: Well, that's good to hear. :)
 SM: I got flamed more than a few times in my day.  :(
 GD: Snowman, how do you handle such mail?    
 WN: ... he passes it on to me... <grin>
 SM: ... and if White Noise can't handle it, then I find out where they
     live and... well... what's the next article?
 GD: Isn't there another piece of mail this week?    
 WN: <fumbling in the mailbag> ... hmmm can't see any...
 GD: Wait! Here's apiece of mail. Boy, it looks old. Christopher, what's 
     this?
 SM: <blowing off dust> Hey! Its a mail from Dan Wright.  Its something
     he wrote me about a year and 4 months ago.
 WN: Hey, didn't Maelcum release something?  (or so I heard in my few
     stops on the Net)
 GD: That's right Jeff, Maelcum and IQ have released a CD called "FTZ"...
     I've heard some of it and its pretty cool!  This article is an 
     advertisement for the CD.
 WN: This introduction lacks sound... atmosphere... something.
 GD: This introduction lacks Trixter! With him, we would have the whole
     Hornet Core here.    
 SM: Trixter told me he'll be in-com-mun-a-ca-do until this Saturday.
 GD: Ah, I see. Well, I hope he enjoys his job...
 WN: I can relate to THAT.  Can you spell B-U-S-Y? :)  Speaking of busy, I
     gotta run now guys.  Take care.
 GD: So long, Jeff.
 SM: Later dude.
 GD: Hey Christopher, how are newsletter subscriptions doing?
 SM: Actually, _very_ well.  I get up each morning and there at least 5
     or 10 new subscribers.
 GD: Great! Glad to hear that.  Hey, did those party files get taken 
     care of this week?  Some people asked me about that.                       6PM r3cgm (+is
 SM: Actually, I'm in the process of moving the demos and intros now. 
     Next week, can you follow the format I use and move the music from
     those compos?
 GD: Sure thing. I'll be anxious to listen to some of that music again!
     I'm sure you don't want to hear another minute's worth of NAID compo
     tunes, huh?
 SM: Actually, with all of those entries at NAID, you'd think more of
     them would have been uploaded...
 GD: That's true. With 50+ entries, very few were uploaded. And I only saw
     one graphic uploaded! The ripped one, of course.
 SM: I wonder why people aren't uploading more party files.  I mean, we
     have a European site now so there's no reason not to upload.
 GD: Maybe next year at NAID, Hornet could take responsibility for

=--------------------------------------------[One Track Minds]--[GraveDigger]-=

 Demo scene musicians are fortunate to have a vast collection of freeware
 and shareware programs available to them. But once they find a program they
 like, they tend to stick with it to the point of insisting that it's the
 best. Only a newer version of the same program will replace it.

 They have a reason for hating other tracking programs, too. Logical? Not
 always. Take a look at a few things I've heard in my day:

 "A mouse isn't practical for a tracker program!" Some might say, indicating
 their distaste for FastTracker 2. Yeah, that little white thing with one
 ball that sits on your desk, waiting for you to open Windows. But wait, is
 the mouse more confusing than those hotkeys in other programs? The buttons
 in FT2 are labeled and even explained in-depth in the online documentation.

 "Scream Tracker is so buggy." Hey, so was the Intel Pentium chip, and
 millions of people didn't care much, except when it came time to return
 them for a free replacement. Besides, Psi admits that ST3 has bugs. Just
 save your work every so often and you'll surely get along fine.

 "MultiTracker is so old!" Now come on, my grandmother is old, but I still
 love her! Well, you see, she has a Corvette, and maybe, just maybe, she'll
 let me drive it someday.

 "Everything else sucks." Right. Everything with a copyright date before
 1992 is more outdated than the week-old milk in my refrigerator. Being that
 this is an age of binary numbers that don't change, good 'ole ModEdit will
 still write the same exact mod file as it would back when you first got it.
  
 But is all this foolish talk really just elitism? One person using a
 certain program that they believe to be the best? Or are there real reasons
 behind a musician's insistence on their work environment?

 How would Future Crew's music sound if written in FastTracker 2? Imagine
 Skaven loading in 600k samples and editing their sound right in the
 tracker? What if LizardKing picked up MMEdit and wrote his music in that?
 What if all demo music on the PC was limited to 4 channels?

 Besides the various advances in technology that these programs bring out,
 they also segregate musicians into groups that think their program is the
 best, everything else is junk, and anyone who disagrees is wrong.

 The authors of these programs never envisioned such occurrences. These
 simple programs come with little more than documentation, and maybe an
 example song. There's no subliminal messages that tell the user to hate
 everything else. It's just a learned behavior, most likely copied from
 one's influences.

 Why do some people take things like this so seriously? So, your favorite
 musician just switched tracking programs on you. True, some module formats
 are better supported than others, but you can always load a song into the
 tracker it was written in and listen to it that way. After all, in most
 cases you can't argue that a tracker will play a song incorrectly.

 With such emphasis on matters of little importance, I see the music scene
 as one that discourages beginners and only caters to the veterans. It is
 unfortunate and hard to reverse, but its effects are devastating for those
 outside of it. With such a large and still growing music scene, its almost
 impossible to be objective.

=--------------------------------------------[Generation Gaps]--[GraveDigger]-=

 One night, I was banging away in Scream Tracker, trying to get a song
 written when my dad, as he often does, came into my room without knocking
 and peered over my shoulder. Hoping to make a point, I ignored his entry
 and continued at my work; headphones on, eyes fixed on the monitor, and
 brain somewhere off in left field.

 "Can't you move the cursor with the mouse?" He abruptly asked, forcing my
 head to snap at the muffled sound; a sound from an object which I had
 forgotten the presence of. He was noticing that I had to tap furiously and
 repeatedly at the cursor keys to move the cursor across the screen.

 "Not in this program, no," was my response. I had chosen my tracker, and I
 had to accept the keyboard-driven interface, which I did not mind, really.

 But then, a short time after this experience, I realized how many differences
 there are between myself and my dad. But it seems to go beyond my own family,
 and I think it bears some relevance to why we all do what we do.

 Parents are generally working in somewhat stable careers, and have reached
 a point in their lives when they know that their childhood dreams will
 never become a reality. My father, for example, works in a hospital. His
 dreams are of boating and fishing, and being outdoors. But while at work,
 occasionally he finds himself behind a computer running Windows. Usually,
 everything in Windows relies on a mouse.
  
 Their children, (that's us, guys) are still dreaming those dreams. That's
 where the products of the demo scene come from, at some level. Visual
 hallucinations, audio delusions. We are also a dos-driven society, for the
 most part, where a mouse is frequently little more than an annoyance.

 It is a simple difference like this that holds generations apart like two
 same-ended magnets.

 And these differences can sometimes go beyond a simple matter-of-choice for
 computer operating systems. Often, parents are stuck on the idea of "Work
 first, play later." Or, "Reality first, dreams later." This is a matter
 that I meet with much difficulty. I struggle hard enough to stay out of
 reality as much as possible without it being forced upon me. "Dreams first,
 everything else later" is my personal motto.

 Some are fortunate. They can show demos to their parents. However, this
 takes patience on their part for them to accept something that you enjoy.
 It also takes courage on your part to face the possible rejection. If you
 are able to talk about and show demos to your parents, then consider
 yourself very fortunate.

 But if you think for a minute, it seems that there are many people who do
 not understand the demo community. To them, we look at things backwards. An
 illusion to them is reality to us, and vice versa. As if the world we all
 live in is upside down from the rest of the world.

 If only it were as simple as to grab the earth and flip it over.

 We hacked standard GNU ls command to support extra parameter -e. It reads
 descriptions from 00index file. We lost sources few weeks ago when harddisk
 crashed.

 interesting.  Probably not.  However, its one of my most treasured mail
 momentos. -Snowman]

 January 21, 1994  <--- 1 year, 4 months ago!

 Hey Snowman, your the guy who uploaded all  those MODS right?  5+ megs!!!

 Yeah, we could still use help.  We have a few people but no one "stable".

 It gets out of hand if you do not KEEP UP and that is what has happened as
 of late.  However we have a little more control now...just that the
 incoming directory is starting to FLOOD again!!!

 Maybe we could start you with the MUSIC, misc directory.  Then if you get
 yer shit done you will be welcomed aboard...

 Many of the maintainers have started off good or with lots of talk and then
 dwindled to zilch after learning that it is TOUGHER or maybe not as
 exciting as they think.  We could do without those people.

 What do you say...can you help?
