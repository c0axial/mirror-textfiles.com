GENERAL STUFF
*************

Other sites to download ("get") demos from are listed at the top of this
file.  Notice a new one was added--ftp.uni-paderborn.de /pub/msdos/demos.

Only ftp.luth.se mirrors the /incoming directory so keep that in mind
if you are ftping for new demos.

In the last week over 2 Gigabytes of files were downloaded from WASP.
Of coures, not all of this stuff was gotten from the /demos directory
(which takes up 230 megs)--this site does have other files though not
as interesting.

Please do not delete files in the /incoming directory.  This week two
demos (or what I considered demos uploaded by someone in France) were
deleted/removed.  If you have problems with certain files let me know--
don't just delete.

Also try to put any music related files into the /incoming/music directory.

As a final note ftp.uwp.edu finally opened its /incoming directory for
demos...but this is a hastle for me (switching/checking/etc) so upload
new files here not there (unless it is faster).  If your file is at 
"uwp" and not here it may not ever make it here.

 Hello all Mike here.
 I've reviewed new some demos, and here are some notes:

 * Poor/Majic 12
   - Yo Maxwood! How about fix "GUS only at 220" ;-) Or i must create patch or
     other ones?
   - secret part - I've not enought time now to crack it completly, but
     not quite sure if there is a secret part at all ;-) part called zoom
     doesn't rehandle keyboard or mouse, doesn't check mouse or port 60, and
     doesn't check ofs 529 - last key scancode stored by new handler...
     if u know how to enter it, send msg to us ;))
 * Show/Majic 12
   - again probs - at first it looks like it'll not work on my machine at all.
     but after few lines in asm i saw that Maxwood is determining name of
     exe-program searching for '.' so, I mean - you cann't place this demo
     in any sub-directory with '.' in name :)))
 * Fudged Insanity/Razor 1991
   - crash on my machine with OFF BOARD PARITY ERROR :)) if it crashs on many
     machines, i can create patch for it (prob with int handling/masking)
 * Red/Razor 1911
   - same prob with PARITY ERROR :)) but you can use switch -s to turn it off
     (also music)

=======
FINALLY
=======

Thanks to Patch we now have the programming/source directory updated.
the docs and libs has also been checked and is up to date.  Now, if
we can get the utils directory updated...

We can't have a jam packed and interesting demonews every week...
especially without other people contributing.  If you have anything to
say to 100+ people or would like to help (with newsletter/demo site)
let us know by sending mail to the address below.

Happy May Day!
