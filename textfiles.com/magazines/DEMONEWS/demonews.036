		VLA's 3D Math Tutorial 1.01  (3d_math.zip)
	
	Well, here's an updated version of the math tutorial we released 
a couple of weeks ago.  Several people had some difficulty implementing 
the code, so I dropped in a more direct approach to rotating your 
points.  It isn't as efficient as the first one, but it is easier to get 
working, so you might want to try it out.  I also went into a panic for a 
second when I realized that multiplied through with a negative X, but 
then again you do crazy things when you mix math and programming late at 
night.  It still works, it's just counter-intuitive, that's most likely 
why people were having problems with the concepts.  So anyways, pick it 
up, start coding, and go wild... :)
