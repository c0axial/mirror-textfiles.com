NEWSGROUP 
=========

If you have access to the NEWSREADER go to "news.groups" and do a 
FOLLOWUP.  WE NEED this GROUP.  Lets do it!

OVER THERE
\\\\\\\\\\\

A few people in the UK plan on putting together a BBSable CD.  I believe it
will be under the HOT STUFF "label" in case any of you are familiar with
those people.  The CD will contain 600MBytes (Ziped) of Demos, FLI's, GLs, 
MODs, MIDI, Gifs, and games.  The full package will cost around $50 for 
anyone interested.  If you would like any of your stuff to appear on the CD
then contact rob@sound.demon.co.uk  This includes demo groups and such.

Anyone have access to a CORETAPE-format DC600 tape backup system?  Rob
(of above) has about 40 MEGS of demos not on our site he is willing to
contribute.  It would be great if someone in the UK had access to a 
DC600 backup system and could upload this stuff.  Ah, but it may take 
awhile.  Welp, I can wait--I can, really.

BAD NEWS/GOOD NEWS

I shall be graduating MAY 1 1993.  From that time on (and perhaps earlier) 
I will no longer be able to maintain or provide any help in updating this
(these) demo site(s).  If anyone would like the "job" of maintaining, 
commenting, updating, organizing, and continuing the progress I have begun
please let me know.  It does require some "time" but then again, so does 
everything.

STATS BACK
==========

--TOP25DL on the WASP site.
--Did you know that during a typical week 1/2 Gig of demos get downloaded
  from ftp.uwp.edu?

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
LIKELY CHANGES
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

--I plan on re-locating all the TEXT files (except the README file) into
  a directory called "text"  Within that directory all the up-to-date
  text files--including DEMO.NEWS--shall be kept.  Old DEMO.NEWS files
  shall be kept in an "old_text" directory within the text directory--
  at least on the WASP site.

IF YOU think this is a BAD idea then get back to me PRONTO as I expect to 
implement the changes the BEGINNING of the NEW MONTH (MARCH).

CLOSING COMMENTS
================

--This weeks DEMOSITE quote comes from Henry Rollins of The Rollins Band:
                 "I'm no stranger to kindness."
