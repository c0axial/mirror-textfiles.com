REVIEWS
=======

Many of the demos have been reviewed on this site--I am working on
combining the files you see in the /alpha directory into one DEMOS.TXT
file.  Reviewing of demos is neverending.  As for other directories...
only the /programming directory is not updated (.TXT wise) very often.

Anyone want to write do a description file for the PROGRAMMING directory?
