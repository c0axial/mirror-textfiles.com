 Happy New Year!
 
 Well it's the first day of 1996 now, as I write this.  I'm apparently a bit
 late, but I thought these things go out on Monday.  Well at least now I can
 wish you a happy new year!  In the past week, the Party 5 happened and we
 all heard how badly organized it was.  Again.  I'm not sure whose fault
 this is, but I know it's gotta be hard to organize a 3000 person party.  I
 just hope someone figures out how to do it right.  Necros spent what little
 money he has to fly all the way there and went home disappointed. IOR flew
 even further and didn't even do as well. =)
 
 Sorry if this is a bit short, but I have stuff to do still before I get
 this out.  I hope my first demonews satisfies all your needs.  If you don't
 like it, print it out on nice soft paper and use it in the bathroom =)
 
 Oh, one more thing.  As you may know, I handle the music section of our
 archive. If you have questions or comments about this or the music ratings
 we include here and in our 00index.txt files, please mail me at
 diablo@wcarchive.cdrom.com.  I try to include as much explanation about
 archive procedures as possible in the .message files in each directory.
 The music reviews are another thing.  Some people like them, some hate
 them.  If you have a particular like or dislike, please mail me.  Please
 include reasons or alternatives.  It doesn't help me to get messages like
 "Your reviews suck."

=----------------------------------[The Party 1995 Demos Reviewed]--[Phoenix]-=

 This won't be your average party compo review.  I've added a little section
 to reflect my personal disgust toward the recent attitude in the scene;
 that is, to imitate groups more popular than yours.  You'll see...

 [From Snowman: Please note that the "Overall" fields below are _not_ the
 same thing as the file ratings listed above.  Where Phoenix has given
 ratings for TP5 entries with respect to each other, the demos under
 "Demos:General" are given ratings with respect to all other demos in the
 scene.]

 Who would've thought, a SVGA vector-demo by Realtech?  This one takes cues
 from several other demos, like Bill G Force/Complex (lens flares/ logo),
 Nation Zero/Jamm (cubes), and Cyboman 2 (school of fish). Also, the title
 comes from a Purple Motion S3M.  However, they did a good job with the
 underwater theme.  I wonder if the manta/seahorse textures come from the
 same critter-library EMF/Plant used (see later)? The end pic/music are
 nice.

 Well, considering Croaker/Halcyon made the music for this demo, it's no
 surprise where the design came from.  Watch Karma by Halcyon or Avena
 Kinetik by Distrosion for a similar feel.  A worthy effort.

 This was the only Dutch demo entry as many from there were cut out of the
 compo.  As a result, an Anti-TP5 intro was made (check out antitro2.zip).
 I think this demo deserved better than 17th, it had full 32k color, some
 nice objects and good graphics.

 Well, through all the turmoil going on in this country there are those
 courageous enough to keep on coding.  The only unique part of this demo is
 the intro screen where a bunch of cubes fly around the screen to form a
 Hyperopia logo, this is pretty neat.  The rest is the usual
 tunnel/rippling/rotation effects.  Some decent gfx.  The music is standard
 dancefloor but a little dull for a demo, and breaks up a bit in the middle.

 Sorry, but I couldn't fairly rate this.  With my Vesa 1.2 driver it locks
 up after the logo, and with Univbe 5.1 it locks up after announcing the 64k
 color part.  BTW I have an ET4000W32 chip.  A bugfix is in need.
 
 [From Snowman: I too had this problem.  However, I found out that the Sony
 Trinitron monitor I was using would not synch to the correct mode (even
 with UNIVBE).  My 4 year old Samsung Sensor monitor did the job though.  Go
 figure.  :)  I liked this production a lot and gave it a **** overall.]

 This is the last demo of S!P-Poland before they join the new Pulse group
 (see below).  Scorpik once again made a cool soundtrack, and the effects,
 some of which are in faked-18-bit-color, are numerous and well done,
 although not extremely unique.  I feel this demo should've placed a little
 higher than 10th.  If you like Cocoon, you'll also want to check out
 S!P-Poland's last demo, "Dreamsteal".

 Kudos to Masque for their idea behind this "demo", to arrange effects
 according to the frequency of the music.  Unfortunately, there are only
 9 or so effects and they start repeating after about 30 seconds.
 So I think E-Beat placed a little too high, for what it has.

 This is demo is from a new group consisting of the what used to be Infiny,
 plus in the future Distorsion and S!P Polish section.  Polka Brothers
 (Amiga) fans will be in for a treat, but hardcore Second Reality fans
 should probably keep away.  Has complex vector-scenes with a dude
 sky-surfing around them, and some still gfx by Antony.  Shad's "rock" music
 is uhh, interesting. :)

 To be honest, I was more impressed with Dubius' ASM95 demo, "Optimal
 Torque".  This one has many effects based on that, among other places. The
 tunnel is reminiscent of the one in Realtech's "DX Project", and the
 dog.3ds in between two rings, I've think I've seen SHADOW an effect VOLUME
 like that DOPE before, hmm.. the music is borderline techno (too slow to be
 I guess), but I really like it.

 Believe it or not, this is Jamm's very first full length demo.  And they
 didn't do a half-bad job.  While there are not very many effects (blobs,
 odd voxels, project-xyz-like tunnel (but in color), etc), the design and
 graphics (by Visualize) are excellent.  The music played by Midas .5 beta
 is very high quality.  Worth checking out.

 This was the not only the winner of the TP5 PC demo compo, but also the
 only one that made it to my diskmag voting list :).  Saracen/EMF teamed
 up with Mik Sair/Plant for a valiant coding effort, with Beatnik doing
 gfx and Dune/any-Finnish-group-I-feel-like doing the great music.

 It starts out in the usual Dope-ish manner, followed by a tunnel (sure),
 then the first vector-scene.  It has VERY life-like fish floating around a
 seafloor.  Following this is another scene with butterflies (once again
 realistic) flying above lilypads (nice vectors) and into the sky.  Third is
 a group of firefly-lights swarming around a group of tall stones in a dark
 scene, then the stones change into translucent pillars.  It ends with a
 form-changing picture.  Unfortunately, the demo never seems to return to
 DOS, although Escape did the job for me.  Very impressive for two weeks
 work.

=-----------------------------[The Party 1994 CD Reviewed]--[Snowman and Ior]-=

 _____Introduction

 Hello all, Snowman here.  About 2 months ago, I ordered "The Party 1994
 CDROM" from your friend and mine, IOR / Hornet.  Just for kicks, I decided
 that I'd write an e-mail to the Hornet gang _while_ I was opening up the CD
 for the first time.  IOR subsequently replied to my comments.

 Two months ago, I told IOR that I would do a review of this CD for
 DemoNews.  Unfortunately, by now I've forgotten most of what I thought
 about this CD.  :)  I went back to my old logs and came across the e-mail
 that IOR and I sent back and forth.  Using my artistic license (making up
 some of IOR's words), I now present to you "The Party 1994 CD Reviewed", as
 converted from e-mail.

 Please note that IOR has attended TP94, ASM95, and is currently in Europe
 just waiting for TP95 to begin.  For those of you attending TP95, I'd like
 to also mention that Stony / Hornet will be there.  Just walk up to him and
 say "Hi Stony, I'm Snowman / Hornet" and he'll be friendly to you.  :)

 _____The Review

 SNO: OK gang, I will now open up my two snail mails... online!

 IOR: Sounds like fun!

 SNO: First mail, "Get a VISA Card."  Only 5.9% fixed APR financing until
      May 1996 when you then pay $4999.55 per month low service charge.

 IOR: Doh!

 SNO: Second mail, The Party 1994 CD.  Opening...

      Yes!  Bubble-wrap!  [making popping noises now]  Oh, there's this CD
      inside too.  But who cares about that.  I got bubble-wrap!

      OK, the front cover has a child (little boy with blonde hair) being
      held up by the back of his collar by this green sharp-looking demon.

      "This CD is full of the best demos, music and graphics for PC and
      Amiga."  "An ASSEMBLY Organizing Production... THE PARTY 4 CD. Try
      this at home." [note the omission of "don't"]

      This CD is heavy and shrink-wrapped.  Still haven't opened it up yet.

 IOR: Well open the blasted thing already.  What do you think?

 SNO: Just hold on dude... I want to look at the back of the case first.

      [looking at back]

      - 100 demos, 190 musics, 120 gfx, etc. etc.
      - Cubic Player v1.5
      - New version of F-Prot.  [hehe... Remember the virus on ASM94 CD?]
      - Whoa!  "All the entries from Juhla 2 and the best from Abduction
        95".  Remember TP94:, JUH95B:, and ABD95:?  We are missing graphics,
        music and demos from these parties and now I can make sure that
        ftp.cdrom.com has a full set.

      This looks and feels like a very professional production.

      [opening plastic wrap now]

      OK, with the ASM94 CD, you could enter the CD-ROM competition. If your
      name was drawn, you won a free trip to ASM95.  I want to know who won!
      Anyway, the competition for this one is "If your name is drawn, you
      win a free Zytel modem." It says results of the CD-ROM drawing will be
      posted to comp.sys.ibm.pc.demos, so look for this in mid to late
      December.  Hmm...

 IOR: Actually, it's not as bad as it sounds.  They're giving away _6_ ZYXel
      ISDN modems.  WOW.

 SNO: "Producer: Markus Kantonen"  <-- who is that?

 IOR: That is Moku, ex-Accession member.  Prez of ASSEMBLY Organizing.  All
      around cool guy :)

 SNO: The insert is so huge that I had trouble pulling it out of the case.
      (23 pages, it's no wonder the thing felt heavy)

      The style of language used in the "Opening Words" suggests that the
      end recipient of this CD may not be from the demo scene.

 IOR: Again, Moku :)

 SNO: Very nice printing color.

      There appear to be some enhancements in the GUI (compared to The
      Assembly 1994 CD).  Whoa!  The pictures are going to be displayed in
      640x480x256 so have your VESA driver loaded.

      There is a new mode for Cubic Player called "Big GSA" and it says that
      a Pentium or DX4 is recommended.

      OK, I've read through the documentation, let's go try this thing out.

      [time passes...]

      Just got done playing with the CD.  This is a really groovy
      production, and I would recommend you all get a copy.

      I'm not sure if this is what I saw, but it appears that at TP94, they
      had a bulletin board (and I ain't talking about a BBS) at the party.
      Groups could just come over and put a memo saying "Looking for
      graphician, come see Snowman in room 144", etc.  This is a GREAT idea
      and I would highly recommend doing it at NAID.

 IOR: Yes, that is indeed what you saw. They also had one at Asm '95. Cute
      idea and it has some use, although it's hard to find a specific
      message.  And equally hard to describe where to find yourself ;)

 SNO: There are several really odd pictures of people who painted their
      computers whacky colors.

      There are 3 audio tracks on the CD, none of which I could get to play
      through the default player (Cubic Player, which was playing the other
      music just fine).  When I say "audio tracks", I mean like tracks on a
      CD and not an .s3m or .mod.

 IOR: Yes, I discovered this about a month after I opened my copy. I was
      really bored, and I put it in my Audio CD player.  Lo and behold! 4
      tracks are detected.  So I skipped the 50 minute first track (the
      data) and moved on to the next three.  Three "decent" techno tracks.
      Third one is kinda cool.  Nice rez at the beginning of the first.

 SNO: There is a ton of stuff from Juhla 2.5 and Abduction and TP94.  Our
      demo archive is going to be a _really_ complete archive.

      There are descript.ion files for most directories.  For you non-4DOS
      people, that means that by typing "dir", you can get descriptions of
      all the files automatically.  Yee-haw!

 IOR: I hope you enjoy the CD :)

      And let me send you a little order to include in the next copy of DN.
      Remember, this is for North American purchasers _only_.  Euro
      purchasers must get their copy straight from ROMWare or ASSEMBLY
      Organizing.  I am not a European Distributor.

      This is what I've come up with. Tell me if you think I should change
      anything on it.

 SNO: This order form looks good dude.  I'll include it below.

 _____Ordering Information
    
 Wow! Now you too can own the "The Party 4" CD-ROM! =)

 Previously available only in Europe through ROMWare, I have a supply of the
 "TP4 CD-ROM : Try This At Home" sitting near me.  And now, I'm offering
