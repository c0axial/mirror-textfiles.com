I also moved the following files.

/incoming/music  summer , bussis3m  to /music/other
                 darkness, opticmod to /music/demo_music
                 fish3m to music/demo_music

/incoming/PARTY93  party93 graphics to /graphics
                   journey  to /music/music_disks

[I may have actually moved more as papers are everywhere.  BUT, for the
most part, I believe this is everything that was moved--at least up to
today.]

===========
ALSO MOVING
===========

Expect the PARTY93 stuff to slowly move to the proper directories.
Graphics and music will probably be move first.  The results will be
moved to the "compos" directory.

=====
MUSIC
=====

Any music not demo related or not written by someone in a demo group "may"
end up getting deleted.  We don't have the space to become a MUSIC/MOD
site as well as a demo site thus we have to make these restrictions. So
please don't start uploading every mod on the planet.

======
MIRROR
======

ftp.uwp.edu is again MIRRORing the "wasp" site.  If we move a file we will
delete it off the incoming directory of both sites!  If possible upload 
your STUFF to both sites.  At the LEAST upload it to WASP as it is the
MAIN demo site.

===========
COMPRESSION
===========

We have started to accept ZIP here--makes life easier--so files will be
in either .lzh or .zip format.  Please try to avoid uploading files in
.arj format, ESPECIALLY ARJ files with DIRECTORIES IGUANA!!! It will cut 
down on our converting formats if you do.  ARJ files with DIRECTORIES
takes 30 times as long to CONVERT since we do not have the DIR version
of ARJ on this system.

=======
FINALLY
=======

We can mail you the TOP25DL every week if you wish.  We can probably also
mail a directory listing and other crap.

That is all for now.
