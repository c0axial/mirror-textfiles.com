((Section 1...Standard Info))
==============================================================================
    DemoNews is a weekly publication dedicated to the demo scene.  It is
produced at the Internet FTP site ftp.eng.ufl.edu (aka WASP or HORNET).  
This newsletter focuses on all aspects of demos and demo-making  (including 
music, art, and coding).

There are currently three active demo-operators at this site:
     
     Dan Wright (Pallbearer) - dmw@eng.ufl.edu
     Christopher G. Mann (Snowman) - r3cgm@dax.cc.uakron.edu
     Mike - weis@elf.stuba.sk

    This site is mirrored by the following ftps:
         ftp.uwp.edu
         ftp.luth.se
         ftp.sun.ac.za
         ftp.uni-erlangen.de
         ftp.uni-paderborn.de

If you would like to receive a new copy of Demo News every Sunday in your
mailbox write to dmw@eng.ufl.edu.  We delete all bounced mail from this
service, so if you SHOULD BE getting Demo News and ARE NOT, please re-request
this newsletter.

SPACE

If you have some money/hard drives laying around (about a gig in size)
why not donate it to this site.  We are topping out at our 400 meg limit.
Too bad, too sad.  If we could get about 150 people to donate $5 or 
700 people to donate $1 we could get the drive.  Truthfully I would
rather have one or a couple donators as I would not care to keep track
of the money being sent in.  If we get any big donation we will honor
you in the README file.  Theres gotta be someone making over $75k somewhere
out there willing to help--whats 1%.  I will keep pushing this issue until
I (we) discover a solution or I retire from being a maintainer (soon).

Some cool demos coming in from ASM'94 include:
(can be found in the /demos/incoming/asm94/demos directory)

CATCHUP--I really enjoyed the MUSIC of this Hungarian demo.  Very original
         with excellent samples.  The Virtual reality FLY is a winner.
COSMIC--A Video (GUS) type demo that rivals FONT242's Amiga demo that
        competed in last years Assembly compo.  What a concept.
MEGAMIX--Contains an interesting "Techno" section.  SB, GUS may not work.
VERSES--Bill Gates face being morphed into different expressions is 
        very impressive.  The ASM'94 winner.

==============================================================================
((Section 4...Music Articles - MC][))
==============================================================================
        
        No time to do an article this week.

==============================================================================
((Section 5...Demo CD))
==============================================================================

Check /pub/msdos/demos/incoming/democd for UPDATES and information.
(i.e. More information, cost, how to get the DEMO/MC][ CD)

MISC

The name of the CD will be "ESCAPE."  I am pulling demos from STARPART
when I get time and hope to download a few from some BBS's.  It looks
as if this CD will contain 90% of the PC demos out there.  I would like
100% but I do not have the time to search and download everything.  So
far I have 150 megs of demos for the CD.  Over 100 copies of the 
DEMO/MUSIC CD--ESCAPE--have been reserved.  We plan on pressing about
200-300 pending on cost/who we go with (DMI/3M/JVC/other).

MUSIC
(Repeated from last week)

In case you did not understand we do plan on having a Digital Audio portion
on this DEMO/MUSIC CD we are working on.  Most of the TUNES will come from
the winners in the MC][ contest (/demos/incoming/mc2) but there is STILL
space for non MC][ enteries.  IF you have a tune you think should be
included on the CD (Digital Audio) then tell us about it and/or submit it.
There are some tunes out there we would include in a second if they were
submitted but that has yet to happen.  Remember...your favorite song still
has a chance if WE KNOW about it. We are Serious.  AND if you have a DAT
player or know where we can get one (rent) by all means let us know.


ART

We are accepting ART for the CD and perfer people from the DEMO scene.
Acceptable formats include PCX, JPG, GIF, TIF, and anything COREL DRAW
(4) and/or CANVAS will accept.  UP to 3 drawings can be in full color,
2 drawings need to be in gray scale (will be halftoned), and one drawing
needs to be in 2 colors (PANTONE).  Submit samples if you can but DO
notify us (dmw@eng.ufl.edu) if you can help.  We have a couple people
but thus far no ART has been submitted.

==============================================================================
((Section 6...Advertisements))
==============================================================================

If you like "Punk" rock I highly recommend the "SPOKE" DONE CD for $7US ppd
put out by NO Idea Records, P.O. Box 14636, Gainesville, FL 32604.  The
CD contains all the songs from 3 7" records SPOKE has released over the
past few year--13 songs in all.  Three guys--bass, guitar, drums--who
are no longer together made up SPOKE which played in the GAINESVILLE area.
Color insert, jewel case, CD, and postage paid for $7--how much more Punk
can you get?

==============================================================================
((Section 7...Top 25 Downloads))
==============================================================================

Again, nothing this week.  This time the info.log was clean but I did
not have access to it. :(

==============================================================================
((Section 8...Misc))
==============================================================================

We, like most of you, have no idea where the other DEMOS/MUSIC/GFX placed
at ASSEMBLY '94.  In fact, I do not remember seeing any percentage or
VOTE count like last year.  Hey, even a list of ENTRIES for the 64K intros
and DEMOS would be nice.  Seems like a conspiracy.  Maybe it has something
to do about that "CD" the Future Crew is releasing next month.  Anti up
and CA$H in!

==============================================================================
((Section 9...Closing))
==============================================================================

Got anything to say about demos?  Let us know.
