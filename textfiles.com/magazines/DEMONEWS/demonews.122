=---------------------------------------------------[Introduction]--[Snowman]-=

 Hello all, and welcome to DemoNews issue 122.

 I'm sick.  No intro.

 Snowman / Hornet - r3cgm@cdrom.com


=------------------------[Announcing the Hornet Underground CDROM]--[Snowman]-=

 _____The Big News

 Our site ftp.cdrom.com has a lot of demos (over 400 megs worth).  It is well
 organized.  It has a lot of support from the demo scene and has continued to
 become more and more popular since its creation in 1992.  It has been my
 individual responsibility to maintain the "/alpha tree" for the past two
 years and it's time for something new.

 Most of you reading this announcement like demos.  You want to watch, listen
 to, and even reverse engineer them.  It's a mystical thing; a discrete
 hobby, a secret playground.  The demo scene has its own culture and slang.
 All of us thrive off making contributions to it and getting feedback.  After
 all, what good is a demo if there is no one to watch it?

 But bandwidth on the modern-day 'net has become quite a commodity.  With
 routers and servers bogged down, it has become quite a task for many to
 access our humble archive.  Another form of distribution is called for.
 It's time for the Hornet Underground CDROM.

 Several months ago, it was decided that we would attempt to make a CD from
 the demos collection on our archive.  Until 1 week ago, I wasn't certain
 that the CD would be completed in time for NAID (where it was supposed to be
 sold for the first time).  Yesterday I finished the CD.  Now you know why
 DemoNews has been delayed lately.  :)

 _____The Specifics

 Everyone who has contributed to a demo on the CD is entitled to 1 free CD a
 year!  Since it is nearly impossible to get permission from everyone who
 contributed, this is a compromise we settled on.

 If you don't want your demo on the CD, we will remove it in the next update.

 This CD will probably be updated quarterly.

 The CD will probably cost $19.95.

 Revenue from the CD goes toward maintaining and upgrading the archive.

 _____Closing

 I have to send this CD off to press in about 6 days for it to get produced
 in time for NAID.  This means you have 6 days to contact me if you don't
 want your production on the CD.  Please write to the address below if you
 have any questions/comments.  More information will be forthcoming in a week
 or so.

=--------------------[Shut Up Shutting Up, a SB vs. GUS Perspective]--[Rimbo]-=

 Few of us in America over the age of 18 will easily forget the
 administration of Ronald Reagan.  The man was one of the most well-liked
 presidents since Franklin Roosevelt, and might have been elected three times
 if such things were legal.  People certainly considered ditching
 presidential term limits while he was in office.

 That's what makes his current situation so sad.  At first, when he was at
 the hearings and trials of the so-called "Iran-Contra" scandal, people made
 fun of his short memory; as people realized that he was suffering from
 Alzheimer's, it wasn't funny any more. Now, the man is probably only dimly
 aware that he was even president--only 8 years ago--and soon won't even be
 able to finish a thought before he's forgotten what was on his mind at the
 beginning of his sentences.

 Waitaminit, that describes my writing style.  Oh, well...onward!

 A similar sort of Alzheimer's can be seen in history.  No mistake has ever
 been made in history that hasn't been made at least twice before, and as
 long as successive generations fail to recognize the importance of learning
 the mistakes of the past, we are all doomed to fall into the same snares.

 Which brings us to a recent thread in comp.sys.ibm.pc.demos, a newsgroup
 certainly affected with Alzheimer's.  You know which one I'm talking about.
 The one that's made Trixter, me, Jare, and many of us who have been around
 long enough pull the hair out of our heads.  You know, "Why don't demos
 support the SB16?", "Because it sucks!", "Yeah but more people have a SB!",
 "Yeah, but more democoders have a GUS!", "Oh, yeah?", "Yeah!", "You wanna
 take it outside?", "Yeah!", *sok!* *bam!* *pow!*

 It's the old SB vs. GUS flamewar ALL OVER AGAIN, except only the cards have
 changed--what once was the SB/SBpro vs. GUS became the SB16 vs. GUSMax and
 is now the GUS PnP vs. AWE32, but it's still the same old debate.  Hasn't
 anyone realized that nothing has been said in this discussion that hasn't
 been said before a thousand times?  Oh, you ask, "How would I know?"  Well,
 you would if you had bothered to read the one thing which documents the
 history of flamewars in our newsgroup.  It's called the FAQ.

 The irony is that in each case I've mentioned so far, the cycles of
 forgetting get shorter--a lifetime, a generation, and no more than a
 year--while the means of prevention get easier--no means of prevention, a
 good education in history, and READING THE FAQ. This is why the FAQ
 exists...so folks, since you've bothered to read this, why not take a day
 off of reading c.s.i.p.d.?  Just miss reading all of the news, and instead
 go download the FAQ (http://www.mcs.com/~trixter/pcdemos.faq) and read it.

=---------------------[Multifaceted Insects and Self-Aware Robots]--[Phoenix]-=

 It's about that time.. time for a few more demo/intro reviews from
 recent party competitions.  Notice my ratings use a slightly sharper
 scale this time; 1-10 for the 3 categories, and 1-10 with .5 increments
 for overall.  For those of you who can't survive without seeing "*"'s in
 ratings, remember * = 2 and + = 1 and convert them yourself. :)

 Disclaimer: The ratings and opinions presented in this review do not
 necessarily reflect those of the Hornet/DemoNews staff.  Whee.

 Country : Germany                       Overall: 8
 Place/Party/Compo: 1st / Mekka '96 / 4k Intro

 This 4k intro supposedly has general MIDI music, but it needs a
 Roland-compatible soundcard to play it, so I couldn't hear it.  But
 the effects are still impressive.  The intro contains multi-layered
 plasma, sinus vectorballs, zoom rotation/warping, rippling phong
 blobs/rings (like in Purge's "Phenotype" demo), and a simple yet smooth
 tunnel.  Quite an accomplishment.

 Name    : Inside                        Effects: 6

 Place/Party/Compo: 2nd / Mekka '96 / 64k Intro

 A somewhat simple intro.  Starts out with a doom-like part, then it goes
 into some phong objects with a slowly zooming background, then back into
 another doom-like area which is really just a big box.  The intro ends
 with a vertically reflected heightfield-scape.  Pretty nice music.

 Place/Party/Compo: 2nd (tie) / The Gathering '96 / Demo

 Another Amiga group takes to the PC, with some coding help from Scoop.  This
 demo is not out to show any effects.  Instead it has managed to show some
 cool Japan-imation with music and sound effects in under one zipped disk.
 The backgrounds and sprites are incredibly drawn.  Any fans of anime or
 violent cartoons in general should be sure to get this one.

 Place/Party/Compo: 2nd (tie) / The Gathering '96 / Demo

 COMA knows a good idea when it sees it, and has made another "music video
 with a message". (Note: Likuid Krystal/PM watched this with me and noted
 that COMA ripped his gears-and-words-in-video idea from Eden :)

 It starts out strange, with a 3D flower and insect that almost seem dull.
 But this is followed by the real demo, with the video parts, mostly of guys
 walking around in a store with gas masks on, but there is a message.  There
 are both mono-color and faked-18-bit color video clips.  The music in
 "Control" is a LOT better than the music in COMA's last demo, "Paimen".  It
 is similar to Rollins Band/Rage Against the Machine type "rap-rock" music.
 "Control" takes up two full disks zipped, but is definitely worth watching.

 Place/Party/Compo: 1st / The Gathering '96 / Demo

 New group?  Not quite.  CNCD (Cyberiad/Carillon) has been leading the
 Amiga scene for years with the best musicians, and demos like "Closer"
 which won the TP5 Amiga compo.  This demo won TG'96, on the PC side.
 A Pentium is strongly recommended for this demo as the effects are very
 intensive (although a _little_ more speed optimization seems possible).

 It starts out with a blob-filling pic, then moves to several color tunnel/
 rotation/warping effects, none of which stay on the screen for more than a
 few seconds.  Various rapper guys are placed on the screen, with shadows
 cast on the background effects.  Other effects in "Inside" include fluid
 dynamics and a textured landscape with a lens flaring sun and flying jets.

 The demo ended a bit quicker than I hoped for, and the music (if they wanted
 to let people play the soundtrack, why not have just made the original a MOD
 and saved almost 700k diskspace?) was pretty basic.  But this demo deserved
 to win and is a worthy first notch in CNCD's PC belt.

 Known quirk: 1MB RAM is required for GUS music playback.  If you have less,
 the demo will fill in the intro pic non-stop, filling the entire screen
 (except a small part in the upper left corner).

 Place/Party/Compo: 3rd / The Gathering '96 / 64k Intro

 This intro is pretty nice overall, but for a Complex production it's
 only mediocre.  It uses 32k colors in 320x200, which means you need a
 Vesa 2.0 driver.  Unfortunately, I tried loading Univbe 5.1 and the intro
 still did not recognize the hi-color mode.  As a way around this,
 "Supermax" features a faked hi-color mode that looks just about as nice.

 The effects in the intro are few, just color sun-rays, zoom-blurred bobs,
 and a light-sourced logo in the middle that looks rather ugly compared
 to the rest of the demo.  The music, by Supernao and remixed by Jugi,
 is decent but not very mood-setting like the "Dope" or "Bill G Force" music.

 Place/Party/Compo: 2nd / The Gathering '96 / 64k Intro

 This has to be the most original concept intro (or even demo) this year so
 far.  I'm reviewing it, so I have to spoil it for you. :)  Rather than being
 set in some fictional future scene, it's set a century in the _past_, made
 to look like an antique silent film with old piano-rag music.  It has mostly
 vector-people walking around, with occasional subtitles.  Much like
 "Stickman's World", this intro's uniqueness got it its second place,
 although I personally felt this one was more deserving.

 float.robot.float.. if.thy.degrade.thyself.. thy.shall.be.upgraded.

 If you had no clue what I just said, then you are likely sane.  If you
 recognized it, consider yourself a true Orange fan.  This intro is the
 fourth in their "Robot" series.  While not as well organized as "The Sea
 Robot Of Love" from TP5, it contains some brilliant effects in 64k.

 The intro starts with a galaxy of stars which scramble around then form into
 an Orange logo, then burst apart.  It then moves into a color tunnel (yawn)
 with phrases flashing at the bottom.  A cool landscape (fast) follows this,
 then some greets with a weird wavy background.  Then back to the tunnel, and
 then the intro ends with an excellent light-sourced logo.

 Umm.. hel-lo!  _Why_ exactly did these guys use the "monitor-buster" 50Hz
 mode, not mention it in their info file, and not even offer an alternate
 70Hz mode?  It didn't cause me any damage but I was still unable to watch
 the demo because of this.

 Spirit is ditching the toruses they have been so well known for, and did a
 better job this time than with their "Just-ice" TP5 intro.  Some of the
 screens do not seem to work right for me, showing only some dots. Argh, I'm
 tired of rotating plasma circles!  Those things are twice as annoying as
 donuts ever were.  Their 3D object code is good, but unfortunately not used
 too creatively in this demo.  The best effect is probably at the end, with
 env-mapped morphing objects.  The rest is just simple texture warping that
 Tran was doing two years ago.  The music is medium quality but works well in
 a demo.

 This demo was originally intended for TP5 release, but of course that didn't
 happen, did it?  It contains various cool effects, like a spike morphing
 head, phong stuff, blur motion stuff, and that famous naked chicks points
 picture by Danny, along with several other pictures which are very well
 drawn, but just sit there during the demo rendering any transitions
 impossible.  They also did a funny play on the "23806 faces" bee object from
 Nooon's "Stars" demo.  Well put together, but hey, they had nearly half a
 year to make it, didn't they? :)

 Place/Party/Compo: 1st / X '96 / 64k Intro

 IMHO not as good as last year's X intro winner, "Spring".  It's pretty
 short, and the music is a little too "chippy" (I know, 64k, but things
 have changed :).  Still it wasn't bad for what it was.  As for the effects,
 only a few, like a bunch of gears and simple texture warping and swirling
 that is so common nowadays.  And of course flashing words, which would be
 one of those "effect checkboxes" if I bothered to have them again. :)

 End of reviews.  Now go grab this stuff, if you dare. :)

=----[Entering Flat Real Mode with a Memory Manager Still Installed]--[Voins]-=

 Editor's Note:  This information has actually appeared in Imphobia articles
 by Walken, but unlike those articles, this one provides a quick solution and
 code to obtain the same result.

 If you've ever tried to make a protected mode program, you've probably run
 into extended memory managers which are already in protected mode and
 managing memory for you.  Normally this isn't a problem; you can just ask
 the memory manager for some memory.  But if you want to use Flat Real Mode
 (aka unreal mode) then there's no DOS extender that can help you because
 they don't operate that way--they'll either stop you from running or lock up
 the computer.  You can ask the user not to load EMM386 or QEMM, but the user
 can say, "Why should I use a program which requires rebooting?", and he'll
 be right.

 But there's one program that doesn't require a DOS extender that works
 perfectly in Protected Mode with any extended memory manager: Microsoft
 Windows (3.0, 3.1, 3.11, 4.0).  Not long ago I read a very good book by
 Andrew Schulman called "Unauthorized Windows 95".  In there, I found a way
 to use Protected mode in any manner I wanted to with an EMM installed.  How?
 Well, Microsoft Windows can tell the memory manager to shut down so it can
 operate.  All we have to do is emulate Microsoft Windows and the memory
 managers will temporarily disable themselves.  Then we can do whatever we
 want.

 Windows generates 4 messages with int 2fh: Start-up, Start-up Complete,
 Begin Exit, Exit.  Any driver that traps int 2fh will receive these
 messages. (i.e. If driver requires to load VxD). The first message is what
 we need.  Let's look at it closer:

 Parameters:
   ax     =1605h
   cx     =0
   dx     =flags (bit0=0 -Enhanced mode, bit0=1 Standard mode)
   di     =Windows version (30ah = 3.1)
   es:bx  =0:0 or pointer to previous struct Win386_Startup_Info_Struct
   ds:si  =0:0 or pointer to V86 mode toggle function

 Returns:
   cx     =0 if Windows can be started,!=0 if not
   ES:BX  =pointer to new struct Win386_Startup_Info_Struct
   DS:SI  =0:0 or V86 mode toggle function

 struct Instance_Item_Struct {
   void far *IIS_Ptr;   // seg:ofs to Instance data
   WORD ISS_Size;       // number of bytes
 }

 struct Win386_Startup_Info_Struct {
   WORD SIS_Version;
   Win386_Startup_Info_Struct far *SIS_Next_Dev_Ptr;
   DWORD SIS_Virt_Dev_File_Ptr // name of the VxD
   DWORD SIS_Reference_Date    // data for VxD
   Instance_Item_Struct far *SIS_Instance_Data_Ptr;x
 }

 So, to emulate windows we need:
   set-up parameters and call int 2fh (ax 1605h),
   save ds:si,
   call int 2fh (ax = 1608 - Start-up Complete),
   call previously saved ds:si with ax=0 (switch to Real mode),
   do anything,
   call ds:si with ax=1 (switch to V86 mode),
   call int 2fh(ax=1609h - Begin Exit),
   call int 2fh (ax = 1606h - Exit).
   That's all.

 Here's some source code with detailed comments (I use GEMA, but all command
 should be obvious).

 This code was tested with both EMM386.EXE and QEMM 8.0, and works.

 NOTE: Be careful using memory once you've got complete control, because you
 can damage DOS data, which could crash the computer. EMM uses "windows
 global EMM import interface" to transport information about what's in use
 and what's not, but I still don't know much about it.  (I haven't got "Dr.
 Dobbs' Journal", August 1994, where that info is supposed to be).
