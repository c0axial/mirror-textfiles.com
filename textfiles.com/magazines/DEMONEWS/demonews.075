   The name "HORNET" refers to several things.  First, it is the name of a
  demo FTP site on Internet (hornet.eng.ufl.edu).  Second, it is a group of
 people who help to manage files, write articles for DemoNews, and contribute
  various other things.  In this respect, HORNET could also be considered a
                       demo group in the literal sense.

     "DemoNews" is a weekly newsletter containing information on various
    aspects of the demo scene, including but not limited to: coding, music,
   graphics, and design.  We have a regular staff that puts this newsletter
         together, but everyone is encouraged to contribute articles.

 (Burning Chrome and DEMOBOOK)

  I would like to make an apology to Burning Chrome for not listing him in
  the "demo-operators" section last week.  Rob has been working on a demo
  scene database and is expected to release a beta of it this week.

  Concerning DEMOBOOK, BC is one of the few people we have working on the
  project.  I can't go into more detail about what DEMOBOOK is right now,
  but it WILL BE BIG.  Stay tuned for future developments.

 (No School)

  I am now done with school and work.  During the next few weeks, you may
  see quite a few changes on HORNET.  I am hoping to get the entire
  /programming section cleaned up over this X-Mas break.

 (Otto Chrons)

  Last week I asked if anyone knew what Otto Chrons (author of DMP) was
  doing. I found out that he is working on a commercial game system (called
  Genesis) and might be releasing one final fix-up version of DMP.

 (A Few Problems)

  This week, I was not able to complete my interview with Maxwood.  However,
  there are a couple BIG things planned for next week's X-mas issue of
  DemoNews.  Be sure to get this one: it comes out on Christmas Day!

 (Links)

  Many of you have asked for links to be set up in the /demos/groups
  directory.  Following is a form I have been sending out.  Feel free to
  complete it and upload it to the /incoming/links directory.

  -----------------
  Link Request Form
  -----------------

  Hello, this is Christopher G. Mann.  You have expressed an interest
  in some links on HORNET.

  One nice feature of HORNET is the ability to create "links".  These
  symbolically link a file to another directory.  In this way, a user
  can access a file that is contained somewhere completely different.
  This is especially handy for organizational purposes.  For example,
  we have a directory called /groups on HORNET.  There are only a few
  real files in there, the rest are all links.  If you try to 'get'
  /groups/fc/second.lzh (Second Reality), HORNET actually sends you
  /alpha/s/second.lzh.

  To set up a link is fairly simple.  At the prompt, type:

         ln -s filename.zip

  For example, if I wanted to link escape.zip to the directory
  /groups/snowman, I would first "cd /groups/snowman", and then type
  "ln -s ../../alpha/e/escape.zip".  This would create a link to that
  directory.

  Please fill out the form below.  I will make the appropriate
  changes after you send it back to me.  Please do NOT ask to link
  music files.  The music section is constantly being updated and
  there is no guarentee that the file you want linked will still
  be there in a couple of months.  Also, files in the /programming
  directory will not be linked, as I am in the process of moving
  them to the /code directory.

  Please do not fill this form out if you only have one release
  posted on HORNET.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------
                       EXAMPLE (read this one)
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  cd /groups
  mkdir new.group
  cd new.group
  cp ../../incoming/newgroup.txt newgroup.txt
  ln ../../alpha/h/hdemo.zip
  ln ../../alpha/m/mdemo.zip
  -------------------------------------------------------------------

  -------------------------------------------------------------------
                   MAIN FORM (fill this one out)
  -------------------------------------------------------------------


  -------------------------------------------------------------------

  Once you fill this out, send just this last section to me in the
  mail (r3cgm@dax.cc.uakron.edu).

                  (A DemoNews Reader - Mail from Brian Ray)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 [Recently, I wrote to the 4 people subscribed to DemoNews with .GOV
 extensions and asked them how a government employee would become interested
 in the demo scene.  One reply follows, and I do have his permission.
 From now on, I'm going to try and put some reader response to DemoNews
 in each issue. - Christopher G. Mann]

   I work at the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory
   operated by Martin Marietta Energy Systems in Oak Ridge, TN.  I'm in
   the Data Systems Research and Development (DSRD) division.  We perform
   data systems work for (primarily) other government agencies through
   something called the "Work For Others" program.  That's a lot words,
   but, basically, what we do is take on cutting-edge type projects for
   sponsors such as the Department of Defense, FAA, FBI, etc.

   I've been interested in electronic music since 1979 and have been into
   the MIDI scene since 1985.  I've only recently become aware of MODs,
   trackers, etc.  DemoNews has been very useful in getting me up to speed
   on this area of electronic music.

   So, how does this apply to my work here at the DSRD?  Since multimedia
   is becoming more and more feasible on dektop PCs, I am trying to
   explore this area for possible incorporation into future projects.

   But the main reason I'm interested in the demo scene is because I think
   it is very cool! :)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 (The Birth of a Commercial Life by Vic/AcmE)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 A little over a year ago, my father bought a PC.  It was only a 386SX-16,
 but I didn't know any better then.  I had some fun playing around with it.
 Then, I heard something about soundcards and how cool they would be when
 you play games with it.  It would make you part of the game.  So I thought:
 Gotta have one of those!  After I bought one I received a program from a
 friend called RGBDEMO.  I was really curious about what it was.  So I ran
 home, turned on my computer and ran that thing called a demo.  When I
 watched the screen, I almost ended up drooling all over my keyboard, just
 because I had never expected THIS!  All those nice vector balls, flying all
 over the screen and being reflected by the floor, made be long for more.

 After I had collected some more demos, I began to get a little familiar
 with some group names.  All the terms like vector and plasma were known to
 me.  But the music drew the most attention to me.  That's when I got
 acquainted with those things caller trackers. First I used mod-edit, then
 FastTracker became my favorite item to work with.  Later I saw this intro
 made by AcmE.  I was making some music since a little while and they were
 looking for a musician to join them in their little demo-group.  So I
 dialed the number listed in the end-ansi.  I sent a copy of my best (?)
 work to some guy called Aap a.k.a. Steven.  I got accepted and was in
 heaven.

 Now that we've released some products, I am pretty known with everything
 that's going around in the demo-scene.  You might even say I've seen all
 the demo's on earth, know a lot of the groups and we seem fairly successful
 here in Holland.  I love the demo-scene.

 Then you hear about people who all of a sudden go to do some things for
 money.  Draw pictures for game companies or compose some tracks for a game.
 Even coders start making their own public entertainers.  I think that's a
 really cool thing to do.  You start out making things for free, just for
 fun.  And after a while, companies see those productions and might even
 think of hiring YOU!

 Nowadays you see this phenomenon happen much more frequently.  EVERYBODY is
 making things for money, not for free anymore.  Even I have given in to
 this disease and many more with me.  And there are so many other people who
 want to get into it as well.  But is it really a disease?

 Well, in some cases I think the demo-scene will not be improved by everyone
 going commercial, because their works go to the companies and not to demos
 anymore.  But on the other hand, people will make better productions just
 to impress companies.  And I think they really are impressed.  Just take
 the IBM demo-compo for example.  They have witnessed the quality of the
 demo's and how they can serve them.  So to improve their sales, they ask us
 to help them!

 But it's not just companies that give the opportunities, some groups start
 a business of their own.  They specialize in an aspect of the demo-scene
 and try to make some money with it.

 The demo-scene is so perfect for those commercial companies, because people
 in the scene mostly have a lot of experience with computers.  Actually they
 are experienced with exactly the right things a man must know to make it
 work for the undertaking.  That's what makes the demo-scene so attractive
 to them: It provides in the required knowledge.  And who knows what's next?

                            (Calm Before the Storm)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 You can feel it in the air.  The sun is just beginning to rise over the
 Danish horizon.  Wisps of fog litter the hillside, and a solitary bird 
 screams from overhead.  The landscape is full of majestic shadows and
 gentle color.  Soft chinks are heard as armor is repaired in last minute
 preparation for battle.

 Men full of courage and strength have worked long years for this day.
 The grizzled veterans pull on their wired beards in serious contemplation.
 For the young, some sit in silence, unsure of what lies ahead.  Others,
 eager to prove themselves, dance in their boots and hoot and holler about
 the conquests they will make.

 THIS IS THE TIME that will separate the strong from the tender and weak.

   THIS IS THE TIME that ability will come to bear under heavy opposition.

     THIS IS THE TIME that a man will discover where he stands in the world.

 Of this day will be written songs to be sung for years to come.  And when
 these tired and salty soldiers return home, they will tell the tale of how
 they earned their scars at the battle of TP94.
 
 The war cry will sound on December 27.

   And remember... Don't Try This At Home

((Section 6...Musicians Corner))     <BY>     Ryan Cramer [Iguana/Renaissance]
==============================================================================
 Greetings! This week, we have another great issue for you in the music
 section. We start off with an interview of Mellow-D (formerly of
 Sonic-PC). Next, there's an article about my trip to New York when I
 visited the entire Renaissance crew and stayed at Tran's house. I hope you
 enjoy this week's articles. Be sure to send me feedback at
 rcramer1@osf1.gmu.edu.

 The interview with Purple Motion did not go through this week. Since
 Purple Motion apparently does not speak very good English, I've got a
 friend in Finland taking care of doing the interview for me. When he gets
 back to me, we'll have the interview in a future issue.

 There have been a TON of uploads to the /incoming/music directory this
 week. While I haven't checked out everything there yet, theres a really
 great song by Necros/LD which is a remix of a bunch of classic Christmas
 tunes. You will *definitly* want to check out this song.

 ftp.eng.ufl.edu - /pub/msdos/demos/music/songs/s3m/december.zip

 There's also a bunch of releases by Mellow-D which are quite excellent as
 well, be sure to check them out! With The Party '94 just around the corner,
 there should be a lot of exciting stuff coming out very soon. Be sure to
 stay tuned to DemoNews for a look at The Party '94. We will have all
 results and reviews here.

 INTERVIEW: Mellow-D                                   [Music article 1 of 2]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This week's interview is with Mellow-D, formerly of Sonic-PC. Mellow-D has
 done a lot of cool music and he's got a very unique style. You may be
 familiar with his music in the Epidemic music disk. Mellow-D's songs were
 some of the best liked songs in the entire disk. Mellow-D was also one of
 the main organizers at Assembly '94. This week, Mellow-D uploaded a bunch
 of his S3Ms to HORNET, so I figured it would be a great time to interview
 him. I listened to all of the songs that he uploaded, and they are really
 excellent! Be sure to check them out. Look for:

 ftp.eng.ufl.edu - /pub/msdos/demos/music/songs/s3m/mld*.*

 Unfortunatly, Mellow-D's group called Sonic-PC recently folded and the
 members called it quits. Some of the members joined a group called Orange.
 Sonic-PC was one of the most famous demogroups in the scene, and its sad
 to see them go. While Sonic-PC may not be active in the scene anymore,
 Mellow-D is staying extremely active in the scene, and his current work is
 his best ever. I hope that you enjoy the interview!

 [Start of interview, Saturday, December 17]

 MD = Mellow-D [iCE] = jak@hole.fi
 RC = Ryan Cramer [Iguana/Renaissance] = rcramer1@osf1.gmu.edu
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 RC: How old are you? Whats your occupation (student, etc) and where do
     you live?

 MD: I'm 18, I work as a Network Admin at a computer company, and I live
     in the beautiful downtown area of Helsinki, Finland :)

 RC: What sort of musical background do you have? Do you do music outside
     of the demoscene?

 MD: I never really took any musical theory classes.  I played the
     guitar for a couple months.  Other than that, I guess it's
     basically based on hearing. :)  I don't compose outside computers,
     but yes, outside the demoscene I do.

 RC: Were you previously involved in the Amiga scene? If so, tell me about
     your involvement with that.

 MD: Yeah.. I started in like 1988, when a friend of mine showed me a
     Megaforce intro.. I wanted to get in and after a while, I joined
     Securitate with Turtle .. I then went to various groups like
     Deadline, X-Beat, Razkels, etc. and then finally left the Amiga.

 RC: What brought you into the PC scene?

 MD: Well, I got tired of the scene on the Amiga, and I didn't do
     anything for about a half year.. But then one day I called
     Programmers' Paradise and saw it was the Sonic PC WHQ. I uploaded
     a couple of my mods, and after a week I joined. :) Then I joined iCE
     around xmas 1993.

 RC: Speaking of Sonic-PC, what productions were you involved with?

 MD: Well, just one actual release - Plan B.  Sonic PC was starting to
     be a partying group instead of a serious one so we were all taking
     it easy and kicking back with the Lapin Kulta (beer).

 RC: Hehehe :-)

 RC: What ultimatly lead to the end of Sonic-PC? Why did you guys call it
     quits; did it have anything to do with ASM'94?

 MD: In my opinion it all started from when MiK wanted to leave.  Some
     of us knew then, that when he would leave (he was the "main"
     coder), people would get discouraged.  And we did, so after
     Assembly, me, Dune, NiK and Cybelius all left. And in my opinion
     Assembly 94 being fucked up had a lot to do with it too. We got a
     lot of negative fame from it.

 RC: Now, I hear your not currently in any demogroups. Are you looking to
     join a group?

 MD: Well, I'm not actively seeking a new group, but if I get a decent
     offer I'll take it without having to think twice.

 RC: Well, your music has a very unique style, and you are very respected
     but a lot of scene musicians, what would you say are your
     influences?

 MD: Well, I _love_ ambient which I guess could be one of the biggest
     influences. :-) I get influences from whatever I hear. If I like a
     song, it'll come back on a song of mine.

 RC: When you speak of "ambient" do you mean: Brian Eno type stuff, or
     more like The Orb?

 MD: Both. Ambient is very wide, thank god. Many songs of Sinead
     O'Connor are very ambientish. Everything from etheric Pink Floyd
     to The Orb to Sven Vath. :)

 RC: Tell me about your trip to the USA. Why were you over here, and how
     did you like it? How do you compare it to Finland?

 MD: I was in the US as an exchange student.. I wanted to go and see the
     US culture as I've always had a certain pull towards it if you know
     what I mean.  I loved it over there!! Never had such a good time,
     and I'm trying to find a way to move there permanently.

 RC: What certain "pull" did you find about the US culture?

 MD: I don't know really, there's just always been one. Always wanted to
     go there.

 RC: What do you think is your best piece of music that you've composed?

 MD: Urgh! :-) I don't know. I seriously don't. I like my ambient tunes
     maybe the best but.. :)

 RC: How about your tunes in Epidemic? I think that many other people
     consider those to be your best, what do you think?

 MD: Well, those are among my favorite ones, yeah. :) Oh now I know!  My
     best one is an XM that I haven't named yet. (Yeah, it does exist)
     It's saved as 1.XM on my HD. :)

 RC: So your using Triton's new tracker? ...And, when do you think you'll
     release this cool new .XM file? :)

 MD: Oh a couple days from now. :-) Yeah, I couldn't live without FT2
     anymore. The instrument support is fantastic, some editing flaws
     and a couple bugs, but in general it's great.

 RC: How do you compare FT2 to ST3? (I'm using both right now)

 MD: FT2 doesn't click. FT2 has instrument panning/volume
     envelope/effects, MIDI, etc. etc.  ST3 is getting outdated,
     although it was great when it first came out too.

 RC: What equipment do you use to sample, what what are your sample
     sources?

 MD: My most usual sample sources are CD's. I have a crappy Yamaha TX81Z
     and an even crappier Korg 707, but thru the DigiTech DSP 256XL they
     both sound pretty good. Everything I sample goes thru the DSP where
     I can choose how I want it to sound. :-)

 RC: What does this DigiTech DSP do?

 MD: It's a DigiTech Digital Signal Processor, an effect machine. It
     does reverbs, flanges, echos, etc...

 RC: What software do you use for sampling?

 MD: I used to use Cool in Windows, but now I use FT2's sampler.. On the
     Amiga I used ProTracker. Cool suited my needs and so does FT2.. All
     I need is Cut/Paste. :-)

 RC: FT2's sampler is excellent. I don't know what I did without it.

 MD: Ever used ProTracker? Now there's a good intergrated sampler.
     (For a tracker)

 RC: Well, on a different subject, tell me about your experience with
     organizing ASM'94?

 MD: Well, it was a hell of a time. :) I mean, what can I say, it was fun,
     it was thrilling. I was running all over like a mad man. :)

 RC: How about the controversy surrounding it?

 MD: Oh, I don't care that much about it.  People talk.  If they had been
     organizing it, they would KNOW.

 RC: What musicians do you have the most respect for in the scene?

 MD: Generally everyone who does their own shit and not generic
     techno/dance/demoshit.. But there are specials not only as musicians but
     as good friends - you and Necros being the top 2 :-)  .. And I have one
     idol too ...Romeo Knight. And I love Jogeir Liljedahl's music more than
     anything.

 RC: Musically, what are your goals for the future?

 MD: My goals? Uh. I'm thinking about getting more serious with my stuff,
     like spending more time with it, more in depth.  Then, my sort of like
     dream is to make an album, a REAL album, a CD.

 RC: Thanks again for taking the time to do this interview. Is there
     anything else that you'd like to add?

 MD: No prob man.   Yeah I want to thank a couple people .. Sonic PC, JK,
     Syntax, Necros and you.

     There's too much copying around, there's not much originality in demo
     music.. So.. Do your own thang, and DO IT FOR YOURSELF first. If YOU
     like it, that is all that matters.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 As far as the demoscene goes, the United States has never had much
 involvement in it. Who knows why this is, but regardless of that fact,
 there are quite a few of us here who *are* very interested in the
 demoscene. Through the magic of Internet, it doesn't really make much
 difference what country you live in, you can be part of the scene. The
 group that I am in called "Iguana" is located in Spain, yet through the
 Internet, we can keep in contact and work together as a group. The same
 goes for Necros of Legend Design and Basehead of ImpCda, and others.
 Before I had access to the Internet, I was very isolated and I didn't
 know much about the scene outside of my BBS.

 Renaissance has always been one of the big names in the demoscene, and
 the ironic thing is that Renaissance is located in the United States.
 Renaissance isn't really considered a "demogroup" at this time, but all
 of its members are in some way or another involved in the demoscene.
 Way back in the golden years of the demoscene, Renaissance was actually
 placed #1 on the Imphobia charts (this was one of the first issues).

 Last year, I got the opportunity to go visit the entire Renaissance
 crew, past and present members. At this time, Pixel of Future Crew
 (Mikko Iho) was in the United States doing some graphics work for Epic
 Megagames. Epic is located only about 15-20 minutes away from my house,
 so Mikko and I hung out quite a bit while he was here. Mikko and I went
 to quite a few parties while he was here. In fact, we hit three Parties
 in one weekend: The Cellar, Alpha-Phi Sorority, and Phi Kappa Theta
 fraternity. But, thats an entirely different story.

 Mikko hadn't really had the chance to see much of America, and when I
 asked him if he wanted to go visit the Renaissance crew in New York, he
 already had his bags packed for the trip. I also talked my 17 year old
 brother (Austin) into going on the trip too. He wanted to get away from
 the parents for a few days. :)

 On Saturday morning, we headed off to the train station in Washington
 DC and started our journey to New York. We couldn't get the lady in the
 dining car to feed us beer, but it was a good train ride nevertheless.
 We arrived in New York City four hours later.

 We got off the train in New York, and felt kind of lost. There were
 people rushing in every direction, it was hot, the the loud screech of
 metal on metal echoed through the cavernous train station.
 We stood there with our bags and pillows thinking "Uhhh... whats
 next?" My brother, Mikko, and I just ended up just following the crowd.
 Apparently Daredevil, Tran, White Shadow, StarScream, and C.C.Catch
 were waiting for us somewhere in that train station. I had never seen
 any of them, so I had no idea what I was looking for.

 Somehow we found them, they were all standing there waiting for us. I
 walked up to confirm who they were and we all shook hands. They all had
 long hair and were wearing black clothing, except for StarScream
 (Dan Goldstein). StarScream looked exactly like I expected he would, but
 the rest of them didn't look like your typical computer users. They looked
 more like rock musicians. In fact, most of the weekend, Tran, White
 Shadow, and Daredevil sat around plucking away at their guitars. Everyone
 was very cool.

 Soon after I met everybody, Daredevil took off. He apparently wasn't
 feeling too well. Everyone was there except C.C.Catch. It turned out
 that he was in the arcade playing Street Fighter II. When we found him,
 he was very involved in his game, and he didn't really even take a second
 to say "hi" to us. He takes his games VERY seriously. :) After his game
 was over, we shook hands and headed out of the train station. C.C.Catch
 also looked exactly like I expected he would, he was a clean cut, well
 dressed oriential guy with a great sense of humor.

 Once we were out of the train station, we were surrounded by tall
 buildings and hundreds of people rushing this way and that. There were
 dudes on the corner selling watches, pretzels, and cooked chesnuts.
 This was New York! My brother, Mikko, and I were each carrying a heavy
 bag and we were anxious to unload our cargo. To our surprise, this was
 not going to happen. In fact, we ended up carrying our bags around for
 the rest of the day. It wasn't a problem though, we're men.

 I wasn't really sure where we were going, but we just followed
 Daredevil, Tran and White Shadow. Everyone was kind of hungry, so our
 next stop was a pizza place called "Sbarro". Throughout the day, we
 stopped at various music and art stores around the city. Our final stop
 was Tran's house in Brooklyn. Overall, the entire city (or atleast the
 parts that we saw) was kind of run down and overused. Our
 transportation around the city was the New York subway system, known to
 be one of the worst in the world. In fact, New Yorker's seem to be kind
 of proud of just how bad their subway system is. :)

 The apartment complex that Tran lived in looked very depressing. It
 was an old building that looked like it may have been a nice place
 fifty or so years ago, but when we saw it, it was just low rent housing.
 The entire neighborhood housed families that were just getting by. It
 made me feel lucky about where I lived. However, for Tran, this place
 was ideal. It provided him the independance and isolation which seemed
 to suit him. I mean, it wasn't that bad of a place for someone of his age
 and income level.

 We entered the building and climbed up several flights of stairs.
 Behind some of the doors that we walked by, there were babies crying
 and women screaming something in Spanish. The entire building had
 somewhat of a gothic feel, sort of like the building in Ghostbusters.
 The stairs that we climbed were made out of marble, yet they were
 coated with a heavy layer of dust. Layers of paint were peeling from
 the ceiling and walls and the only light in the building came from the
 few windows that were there. I was a little bit scared. My brother gave
 me a strange look which I didn't know how to interpret, but we
 continued on.

 We came to Tran's room, he opened the door, and we entered. There was a
 long narrow hallway leading to his place. In this hallway, the floor
 was covered with paint chips that had fallen from the ceiling. His
 apartment consisted of one main room, a bedroom, a kitchen, and a small
 bathroom. Tran didn't have any furniture besides his desk, a small
 shelf, and his TV. The place was kind of dirty, but he kept all of his
 possessions neatly arranged and in order.

 I had always assumed that with all of the neat stuff that Tran had
 programmed, he probably had tons of computer books and equipment
 around, but this was not the case. He only had a handful of books and
 his only computer was a 386/16 with an old NEC 2E monitor. He also had
 a guitar, a small Casio keyboard, and a selection of Anime movies. His
 Gravis Ultrasound was hooked up to his guitar amplifier.

 The rest of the day, we sat on the floor and watched some really
 strange Anime movies. I had never seen anything quite like them; half
 of the movies were animated sex scenes. Were these supposed to be kid's
 movies? I guess not. Tran watches them for their artistic appeal, but I
 had trouble figuring them out. I'm no Anime freak, but there is some
 incredible art in those movies.

 I went to check out the facilities (aka the shitter). The bathroom was
 quite bad. No, it was worse then bad. The shower, the sink, and the toilet
 were from the 1930s or something, they were ancient! The whole room was
 coated with some sort of shit and you had to be careful where you stepped.
 The toilet seat was rotted, and shit... it hurts my mind to remember this.
 I pissed in the toilet, and I was scared that the toilet might actually
 piss back. I went to flush the thing, and the toilet was rigged with some
 sort of contraption, I have no idea what it was, but you had to pull a
 little chain to get the toilet to flush. Weird. This truly was a man's
 bathroom. To give you a definition of just how it was, imagine the
 absolute worst bathroom that you've ever seen at a gas station. Actually,
 make that a truck stop. Multiply the shit factor by 100, and then you
 have this bathroom. I think that the bathroom was this way when Tran
 moved into the apartment. As I said before, Tran keeps things pretty neat,
 but this _is_ low rent housing, and that bathroom was so bad that it
 wasn't even worth cleaning.

 Mikko and my brother were pretty quiet the whole time, they didn't really
 know any of these people, and I guess they weren't too comfortable with
 the situation. They probably saw the bathroom before I did or something.

 I started to wonder where I was going to sleep that night. Like I said,
 there was no furniture, and there wasn't any carpeting either; there was
 just a cold wooden floor. I ended up using the shirt that I was wearing as
 a pillow, and somehow I managed to sleep. It didn't really matter though,
 we're men. Men don't need pillows or blankets or any of that shit.

 Despite the fact that the apartment was quite bad, Tran himself was not
 nearly as bad as I had always imagined. Tran seems to have developed this
 satan worshipper image, but I will tell you, he is no satan worshipper.
 He's actually a cool guy who is just a little bit isolated. Perhaps this
 isn't the best way to word it, but Tran is a true Renaissance man. His
 life seems to be devoted to art and the persuit of knowledge. Unfortunatly,
 for him, this does not include school or a job. But, each to their own.

 Before I came to New York, I expected there to be satan symbols and shit
 all over the walls in Tran's apartment. I thought maybe there would be
 carcasses hanging from the ceiling like in DOOM 2. That was definitly not
 the case. I only mention this because people always asked me about it.

 The next day, we all went to have breakfast at a nearby restraunt. It was
 pretty neat to be hanging out with such big names in the demoscene.
 Throughout the rest of that day, we visited more of New York. We even went
 to the top of the Twin Towers. Soon after that, Mikko, my brother, and I
 had to take off and catch our train. It was a good experience and it was
 fun to meet people that I had kept in contact with for so long, but never
 actually met.

 I could say a lot more about the trip, but I don't want to bore you. :)
 I've also run out of time for this week, I've got to go study for my exam
 on Monday! Hope you enjoy the rest of DemoNews!

                         (Jelly Tots and Pizza Shops)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 As I come to the end of possibly the busiest week of my life, I have come
 to various realizations about my life and where I live.

 Let me elaborate.  I live in South Africa (that's in the Southern part of
 Africa for those of you who didn't take geography).  I have been living
 here all my life (except for a brief tour of England).

 The other night, during a late night coding session with GoTH, we decided
 that a nice hot pizza would go down really well just about then. GoTH,
 being the only person I know to have memorized the numbers of several local
 pizza places, went to phone ahead to order our pizza. He came back shocked.
 All the pizza places ... _ALL OF THEM_ ... closed at 9PM! It was then that
 I truly realized that I am living in a third world nation.

 The only thing open after 9 is the local KwiK Spar, a convenience store.
 GoTH and I usually wander in at about 2AM and buy large packets of Jelly
 Tots. If you don't get Jelly Tots where you live, you are in an even more
 third world nation then I am. They are sweet gooey things covered in sweet
 gooey stuff then covered in sugar. They are slightly smaller then your
 nail, and deliver and instant sugar rush. Round about 3-4AM even strong
 coffee loses it's appeal, but if you pop a mouthful of Jelly Tots, once you
 recover from the glucose overdose, you are ready to code for another few
 hours. One thing to note is that the cashier who sells us these sugar bombs
 at 2AM never seems surprised. Maybe lots of people do it.

 Anyway, back to my week.

 I have a full time job coding Internet applications for a local firm. In my
 spare time, I code demos and games with Asphyxia. Joy of joys, as we gear
 up to a major release at work, Asphyxia nears completion of a major
 project. My schedule : Wake at 9 (the firm is fairly lenient about coders
 hours, as long as the work gets done), shower, dress etc etc, drive to
 work, get there at 10. Code till 5, not taking a lunch break. Drive home,
 eat something. Get to Fubars at 6. Code stuff with Asphyxia till 4-5AM, not
 stopping for dinner. Go home, eat something, go to sleep. Repeat. Wave to
 parents and siblings if I see them, because I am usually going somewhere
 else when I do.

 It is probably a good thing that my internet server also chose this week to
 die, as if I had yielded to the temptation to cruise the net, it would have
 meant instant death. The week was harder on GoTH though ... he has a
 girlfriend. Say no more ;-)

 Ahh well. Life goes on. It's a public holiday tomorrow (Ascension Day), and
 I plan to sleep through all of it. Only problem is, all my brothers and
 sisters are home, all at once, a very rare thing (three sisters, one
 brother), so I'm pretty sure I won't be able to sleep in.

 *sigh* Oh well. At least there is always strong coffee and, of course,
 large packets of Jelly Tots.

                (Review of the Wired '94 Graphics Competition)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 'All the reviews are my personal opinions on the pictures.  Don't be upset
  if you think it's to negative or positive because we all do have our own
  view on things.' - Stony

 'Cyrix Outside'.LBM

   This is the typical picture we all see at parties, just delivered for fun
   and not for competing.  Such pictures are usually done at the Party
   itself and usually do have something critical about for a subject. The
   picture is very hazy because of the anti-aliasing or smoothing.

   Display    : 320x200x256
   Colors used: about 6
   Rank       : 'unknown'

 'HC-Ranma'.PCX                                      

   This is a nice picture to see, it is quite easy to make and is the
   well-known style of Manga: big eyes, little nose, and just a few colors
   used for some shade.  The Manga is very popular at the moment and it also
   is one of my favorites :)  The picture could have been sharper if
   anti-aliasing or smoothing was done by hand instead of the function in
   the paint program.

   Display    : 320x200x256
   Colors used: about 32
   Rank       : 'unknown'

 'Nadia and the Secret of Blue Water'.LBM by Moebius 

   This is also a nice one in the style of Manga.  The whole view on the
   picture makes it nice, with a small background in a window instead of
   filling the whole screen with the background. A minor point is the
   resolution, this one easily could be done on a lower resolution because
   there isn't that much detail.  The anti-alias has been done well without
   making the picture look hazy. The picture has been designed with Fractal
   Paint 2.0, PhotoStyler 2.0 and Deluxe Paint ][s according to the
   info-file with the picture. It deserves 2nd place.

   Display    : 360x480x256

   Rank       : 2nd

 'Robot'.GIF by Youvi                                 

   It is a nice picture if you like the robot stuff, in my opinion it is
   nice but it has that high resolution thing (I'll explain this at the end
   of this article).  At first sight, it is a bit loud with all the stuff on
   the robot but with a longer view, you see that there is some detail in it.
 
   Display    : 640x480x256
   Colors used: about 32
   Rank       : 3rd ? Not sure about this.

 'SunSweath'.GIF by Balex-T

   The picture looks nice in a first view.  However, according to the info
   in the text-file it was done in 2 days and 2 sleepless nights.  Thats
   just a bit too much time for such a picture.

   Display    : 640x480x16
   Colors used: 16
   Rank       : 'unknown'

 'Tarzan : The Cruel Law of the Jungle'.PCX by Fred   

   Done on a Atari 260 ST according to the info-file with this picture.  Not
   a real competition to the others but it's an original picture :) Nothing
   to say about this picture.  No anti-aliasing or smooting was used and it
   probably was just made for fun. Should have ended 3rd but I'm not sure
   about this.  HC-Ranma should be third in my opinion.

   Display    : 320x200x16
   Colors used: 16
   Rank       : 3rd ? According to diz-file

 'Ukko?'.LBM by Zuul Design

   In one word, 'WOW'! This one really deserves to be first, a nice view.
   Well thought out green and pink frunsels under and above the picture to
   let the picture get more attention.  Also the outcoming flower is a nice
   effect.  Nothing critical can be said about this one!

   Display    : 320x400x256
   Colors used: about 120
   Rank       : 1st

 'Nerd Cyrix'.PCX

   This is another one similar to the one I mentioned previously about
   Cyrix.  Well.... this one is better than the 'Cyrix outside' :) Too bad I
   haven't heard anything about this Cyrix stuff... maybe I would have had
   another opinion...

   Display    : 640x400x256
   Colors used: 9
   Rank       : 'unknown'

 -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

 (RESOLUTIONS)

 In my opinion there should be graphics-competitions set to different
 resolutions.  As I said before, pictures in a higher resolution are much
 more easier to make because you don't have to be very accurate with your
 colors and pixels.  This is because it will look sharp even without
 anti-aliasing or smoothing. The only thing tougher about drawing in a
 higher resolution is that more has to be drawn to fill the whole screen.

 If I would decide how the gfx-competitions should be set then it would
 be something like: Category 1: up to 320x200x256 or 640x480x16
                    Category 2: up to 640x480x256 or 1024x786x16
                    Category 3: up to 1024x786x256 

 The maximum amount of colors should stay 256 because the possibility of
 scanned pictures.  This is something like the restrictions of music-
 competitions because, as all music-composers will confirm, it's easier to
 do a module with 16 or 32 channels instead of 4.

 I hope this all will be made possible in the future.

 (IDEAS)

 There is one major point with this review: original ideas should be
 considered one of the most important aspects of a picture.  In my opinion,
 ideas are the toughest thing of all.

 (PROGRAMS)

 Now a request from my side, can someone name/send me some paint programs
 which are able to draw on a resolution of 320x400x256?  i.e. Set the screen
 in this mode and not, as I do now, enter this as screen size in my paint
 program.

 (END)

 I hope no one has become upset from my reviews because I respect all people
 in the scene for what they are, good or bad.  The most important thing of
 all is that friendship rules!!  If someone out there wants things reviewed
 in the Artists Corner just let me know, just send the things to be reviewed.

                                                               ...Stony '94

I, Scoobs, am trying to compile a large group of electronic music (MOD, S3M,
MTM etc.) to place on an IBM-PC CD-ROM disk that we are trying to put out,  
to be called PS MuzakDisk.

The purpose of this CD is to promote this sort of electronic music and its 
authors to the general public who, at the present time, know nothing of 
music modules and the potential of them.
 
The format of the CD we are looking at is the main menu being a list of all
of the music types on the CD.  Then the user can select which section and
then be given a list.  They can then choose which music to listen to from 
that list.  The CD will be well presented with introduction artwork and the
like.  The intro, menu and player will be coded by Statix/KLF.
 
If you are interested in having your music on the CD-ROM or have any
questions about it, please contact me at the below address.

Thanks for listening!  :)

         I have the one of the worlds largest collection of MOD, 669,
    STM, S3M, ULT, DMF, XM, FAR, and MTM music files. This collection
    currently contains over 2800 files comprising in excess of 545
    Megabytes of memory!  The Collection will include both a DOS player
    written by Otto Chrons, and a Windows player written by Jens Puchert.
     The music player for DOS, called Dual Module Player (DMP) is capable
    of monaural, stereo, and surround sound depending upon the type of
    sound card. Supported sound cards include Sound Blaster, Sound Blaster
    Pro, Sound Blaster 16, Proaudio Spectrum, Proaudio Spectrum 16,
    Thunder Board, Aria, Gravis UltraSound, and more.  The Windows player,
    Mod4Win, will support any sound card that can be installed into
    windows.  Several of the module file formats are standard across many
    computer systems including IBM, AMIGA, and MAC.  Even though this
    release is for the IBM-PC and compatible, most of the files should
    work on the Amiga and Mac also.  This volume will sell for $34.95, and
    should be ready by mid January 1995.
         This CD-ROM allows the user to fully demonstrate the power of
    his/her Multi-Media system. The original artists of these music files
    have labored extensively to create the quality product that these
    Multi-Media owners desire. This CD as a single volume contains over
    100 hours of recorded original and remade classics. Not only will you
    have full control over the selection combinations of the music, but
    also, you will have real-time control of the speed, and tempo, and
    will have the ability to scan forwards and backwards through your
    currently selected music.  More over,  with the Windows player, you
    will have the ability to play the music in the background, while you
    do other things.

 PMODE/W v1.10 - Finally A Replacement For DOS/4GW
---------------------------------------------------

PMODE/W is a replacement for DOS/4GW and is fully compatible with
Watcom C/C+. PMODE/W provides you with a number of advantages over
DOS/4GW. The following is just a small list of what you can expect:

- Small Size (Less than 9Kbytes!)
- Fast Execution Time
- Low Memory Overhead
- No Annoying Initialization Messages
- Self Contained Extender Requires Nothing External To Your EXE
- Does Not Require ANY Extended Memory To Load OR Execute
- Minimal Interrupt Latency
- PMODE/W Programs Can Be Run Under DOS/4GW Without ANY Modifications
- Free For Non-Commercial Use

Simply put, PMODE/W has been designed with two things in mind: size and speed.
PMODE/W undergone rigorous optimization, making it the smallest and fastest
extender available for Watcom C/C++. PMODE/W does not provide many of the
frills found in other extenders. It does not provide virtual memory, exception
trapping, or anything else that could possibly slow down the execution of your
code. For this reason, we have designed PMODE/W specifically with the
developer in mind. You can perform all of your development and debugging using
DOS/4GW if necessary, and then plug PMODE/W in for the release version of your
program. If at any time you are dissatisfied with PMODE/W, you can switch back
to DOS/4GW with absolutely no hassle whatsoever. PMODE/W has been thoroughly
tested with popular programs like Doom, Doom ][, and One Must Fall 2097 in
order to insure compatibility. But don't take our word for it, try it out for
yourself today!

The current version of PMODE/W as of this writing can be found in PMW110.xxx,
where xxx is some archive extension (ZIP, ARJ, etc.)
