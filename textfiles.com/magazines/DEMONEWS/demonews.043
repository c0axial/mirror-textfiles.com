GENERAL STUFF

There is less than 10 MEGS of free space within the ftp directory here
at WASP (ftp.eng.ufl.edu).   Hopefully a few megs will be freed up in
the coming days otherwise I will have to sixth some of the older ANSI
packs.  Thus, I recommend getting old ANSI now before it is too late--
just in case.

From: pochol@lifl.lifl.fr (Pochol Pascal)
Subject: ASM'94 : French Toxic Flight

Hello Netters!

I'm organizing a plane trip to the Assembly'94 from Paris (France) :-)

    departure : Friday 5 of August 10h35am from Roissy 2 airport
    arrival   : ------------------ 02h35pm at Helsinky

    departure : Sunday 7 of August 04h35pm from Helsinky
    arrival   : ------------------ 06h35pm at Roissy 2 Airport

    cost : 2280FF (French Francs) not including the entrance fee...

It's cheaper than by BUS...and much faster :-)
I reserved 40 sits. I'm sure we can find 40 persons...

If you are interested then e-mail me at pochol@lifl.fr

WildCoder / Toxic Zombies

[Pascal, I and another Zombie made this trip last year and it is a tough
journey via AUTO from France to FInland.  At the best you can expect it
to take 36 hours STRAIGHT if you are lucky enough to catch the boats and
not have to wait like we did.  The car plus Gas ran about $200 per 
person.  Tack on another $150 for TWO boat rides and you start coming
out cheaper if you can take a plane directly.]
