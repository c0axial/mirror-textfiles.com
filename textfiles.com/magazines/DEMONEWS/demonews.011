===============
DEMO GROUP INFO
===============

--Twilight Zone shall be releasing a "special demo" called The Jungly
  Kitchen.  Morten (Bogeyman) assures me it will not be the "boring"
  stuff that every group seems to be doing these days.  They also hope
  to have GUS support.  There is possibly a bootleg of this demo that
  was COPIED at the party in Denmark.  It would be very buggy.

--Look for the above demo VERY soon.

===========================================

--On a quest to be the best through excellence--demo site motto.

--If anyone wants to help review, contribute, or have any good ideas
  for this demo site let me know.

  working on a C program to compile statistics from the ftp.syslog.

  updating this INFORMATION every friday/saturday.  This means most
  of the text files shall be updated, files moved, and a DEMO news
