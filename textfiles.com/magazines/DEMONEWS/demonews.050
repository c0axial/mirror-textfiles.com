GENERAL STUFF
*************

Anyone know when "Composers contest" results will be released?  

Thanks go to TINYZ for the new "header" for this file.

I got the TOP25DL program to work correctly after fixing a few things
in the program so it searches the NEW ftp.syslog file properly.  The
results for most of this week can be found in the /news directory under
the top25dl name.  Unfortunately I can not mail the list because it
is impossible for me to run my file (on wasp) against the LOG (on
hornet) because I do not have a directory on hornet nor a path to the
LOG file.  Thus, the program will remain disabled for now except for
(probably) weekly manual updates.  BTW:  Shape (okay, nothing really
exciting) was downloaded 144 times in 6 days!

I plan on deleting EVERYTHING that bounces this week (except the

((GENERAL INFORMATION))
========================================================================

1. Cool new tunes
         a.  Firestorm Music disk by Firelight
               just download and try this one
                 /music/disks/firestrm.zip
         b.  Damage Music disk    by multiple musicians
               this is one of the best mdp packs I've seen
               there are about a half dozen musicians and 10 songs
                 /music/disks/damg/damg0694.zip
   Cool new programs
         a.  Capamod version 1.4
               in my opinion, the most accurate MOD player around
                 /music/programs/players/cmod114.zip
         b.  Textmode intro
               has nothing to do with music, but I thought it was
               pretty cool
                 /alpha/NEW/shape!.zip
 
2. DMP News
           Well, only one new version of DMP was uploaded this week.
         However, that one version (DMP300.ZIP) has been locking my
         system a little bit.  This only occurs when I shell and do
         other things like PKZIP or QEDIT (which I do a LOT).  I
         still made the swith to version 3.00 though and am just
         using it without shell until a new version comes out.  But,
         I havn't gotten off my lazy ass and written Otto Chrons
         about this little bug, so it might not be fixed next ver.
 
3. 4DMP (by Snowman)
           I released a little program last weekend called 4DMP300.
         It has been difficult to explain, but I will endeavour to
         do so now.  When you are playing a song in DMP, the bottom
         half of the screen is occupied by the sample names.  Now,
         whenever a sample is being played, the appropriate channel
         number appears next to that sample.  However, once you hit
         channel 10, it starts going "A", "B", and so on.
           What I did was to redraw and redefine about 26 high ASCII
         characters, so that the numbers "10", "11", "12", etc.
         would appear in ONE character.  Now, whenever you play a
         song in DMP that has more than 9 channels, you will see a
         "10" instead of an "A".  This would be kind of trivial if
         it were the only thing I changed, so I also included an
         enhanced dmp.ini file.  This will actually make DMP look
         pretty!  I can't belive Otto kept that yucky color scheme
         for two years.  Well, just go download it and have fun
         (/music/programs/players/4dmp300.zip).
 
4. Tiny Play Deleted
           Hello?  I had to delete 2 duplicate uploads of Tiny Play.
         If its not in the /incoming/music dir, check the appropriate
         directory /music/programs/players and see if it was moved
         there.
 
5. Restructuring of /music Directory
           This week, I made several new subdirectories under music
         and put the "a", "p", and "m" directories in there.  It was
         brought to my attention by Shades (he and I kind of quarrel
         on IRC, but he does have a good idea once in a while :), and
         I recognize that there needed to be more general division of
         the files.  If you want to see how things are laid out now,
         just read the music.txt file under /music.
 
6. Response to "Anyone read these things"
           Well, after my question last week asking people if they
         actually read these articles in DEMONEWS, I had an over-
         whelmingly good response.  More than a dozen letters were
         written which expressed an appreciation for these little
         weekly articles.  I just need that kind of affrimation
         every once in a while to give me the energy to continue.
         Thank you.
 
7. Composer's Contest 1 Results
           NO, I DON'T KNOW WHEN THEY WILL BE IN.  Please do not
         keep writing me asking me this.  Mike Phillip's address is
         digoxy@metronet.com.
 
8. No .review
           Originally, I was going to start putting .review files in
         some of the music program's directories.  But then I realized
         its not my place to tell you what not good.  I don't have a
         problem telling you what IS good, but thats only my opinion.
 
9. Amiga-Net
           Whether you know it or not, our computer musical heritage
         comes from the Amiga scene.  I have been downloading lots of
         goodies this past week, and I'll probably post most of them
         next week.
 
10. Snowman the Salesman
           Lately, I've been feeling like all I do is promote things
         like my Music Contest ][ and this Demonews.  Well, guess what?
         I'm going to continue to do so until the contest is over.  :)
         So if you want to get to know the REAL Snowman, talk to me
         sometime after September 3rd.
 
11. Music Contest ][ (the aggressive campaign)
           After that clarification in #10, I must tell you all that
         July is Music Contest ][ Promotion Month.  Have a MC][ party
         at your university, give your family MC][ gifts for their
         birthdays, go out and eat a MC][ burger.  That's right, I need
         YOUR help.  Tell all your friends about Music Contest ][, and
         if they say "Music Contest ][ sucks", punch them really hard
         in the head and tell them the error of their ways.  :)  (just
         kidding about telling them the error of their ways).
           The dude who was going to write a nice little program to
         handle the entry shuffling slipped out the back door or
         something, so I'm going to have to do it myself.
