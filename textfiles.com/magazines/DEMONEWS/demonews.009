WHAT ABOUT OTHER DEMOS
======================

Some USA BBS's that have DEMOS:

SOUND BARRIER (New York, NY)  = 1-718-979-9406    
MUSIC CONNECTION (Dallas, TX) = 1-214-596-2827
MUSIC CHANNEL (Hartford, CT)  = 1-203-646-3058 

UPLOAD new demos to the /pub/incoming/demos DIRECTORY.
OR to /pub/msdos/demos/INCOMING DIRECTORY on wasp.eng.ufl.edu

=====================
IMPORTANT INFORMATION
=====================

1) The RATING system was changed.  Check out the ABOUT.DEMOS file

2) Is there any chance of someone out there attempting to get a DEMO
   NEWSGROUP on the NEWSREADER?  How about trying?  They have an amiga demo
   group, what about an IBM/PC demo group on the newsreader.  I have a whole
   article on how to GET a NEWSGROUP on the NEWSREADER.  Anyone got the time?
 
=============
ANSI TACK-ONS
=============

Anyone want to provide any for future demos?

==================
MIRROR SITE UPDATE
==================

This site is mirrored at the following places:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
oliver.sun.ac.za     - /pub/msdos/demos (in South Africa)
wasp.eng.ufl.edu*     - /pub/msdos/demos (in USA--FAST)
nic.funet.fi~         - /pub/msdos/games/demos/new? (FINLAND)

*The WASP site has an INCOMING dir within the demos directory.
~Have to check in to see if official mirror or just a hack.

=========
WHAT'S UP 
=========

-The WASP site keeps statistics so I may mention the TOP downloaded
 demos every week in the future.

-It took awhile but everything is updated once again.
