  DemoNews is a weekly publication for the demo scene. It is produced at the
   Internet FTP site  ftp.eng.ufl.edu (HORNET).  This newsletter focuses on
  many aspects of demos and demo making. Everyone is welcomed to contribute
                    articles, rumors, and advertisements.

_____DemoNews/HTML by White Noise, HORNET webMaster.

 We talked about it, promised it, pushed back deadline after deadline, but
 it's finally here.  Your patience will finally be rewarded.

 HORNET ftp site now has an official identity on the World-Wide Web, and
 houses within it DemoNews/HTML, the WWW offspring of DemoNews.  Now you can
 read all this information with hypertext links to the files on HORNET as
 well as graphics all over!

 To reach DemoWorld, HORNET's identity on the WWW, the URL is

     ftp://ftp.eng.ufl.edu/demos/dw/dw.html

 Since DemoWorld has been created with Netscape and Netscape Navigator in
 mind, it uses many html extensions proper to Netscape and Navigator.  Use
 of these browsers is necessary for best results.

 A last note: as you may have noticed, the only way to reach DemoWorld is
 through an FTP link to the site.  This has a major drawback:  if the site
 is nearly full (ie around 100 users are online), you may experience image
 transfer errors.  The images are actually really there, but the server will
 not send them.  If this is the case, then maybe you should try and connect
 later, when activity on the site is lower.

 Enjoy!

_____Traffic Jam

 HORNET can hold a maximum of 100 ftp users at one time.  This limit is
 frequently being reached.  As a result, I would like to ask all of you to
 start using our FAST mirror ftp.cdrom.com (/pub/demos).  This mirror is
 relatively close to HORNET and it is a great deal FASTER.  This site also
 mirrors the /incoming directory and updates it regularly, so there is no
 need to hop on HORNET just to check for new uploads.  By the way, did I
 mention that this other site is FASTER?  :)

_____CodeThink(School); by Christopher G. Mann

 For most of us coders in the scene, Christmas is a distant memory and
 school is a bad habit we can't seem to break.  Day after day we are forced
 to interact with other people our age who know nothing of C or Assembler.
 Trust me, its very difficult to explain to your lunch buddies how your
 latest ASM graphics algorithms work.

 As I spend so much time coding and reading related manuals, it would be a
 difficult thing indeed to restrict my mind soley academic matters during
 the day.  In this vain, I here present some ideas for incorporating
 coding-related thoughts to the tedium school.

 // INCLUDE FILES

     #include <BodyIO.h>           // walk(), write(), eat()
                                   // If using Microsoft C++, this file

 // CONSTANTS

     const NumCourses     =  5;
     const NumKewlCourses =  2;
     const NumSuckCourses = NumCourses - NumKewlCourses;
     const TimePerClass   = 45;
     const TimeForFun     = NumSuckCourses * TimePerClass;

 // CODETHINK() FUNCTION

     void CodeThink(int timeleft) {
       if (timeleft > 40) {
         GetInspiration = lookat(classmate(PrettyGirl));
         NewEffect = createffect(rand());
         ThinkFeasibility(NewEffect);
         if (rand() == 100) remember(DoomGame);
         ThinkAlgorithm(NewEffect);
       }
       else {
         AnswerEmail(ThinkAhead);
         if (bored > 100) {
           WriteNote(friend);
           CountHowMany(rand(ObjectInRoom));
         }
         FigureOutEffect(rand(demo));
       }
     }

       else {

         turnoffalarm();
       }
     } until ((awake == "yes") || (alarmbroken() == 'y'));

   // MORNING ACTIVITIES
     getup();  // use getupc() to 'c'onceal side effects of rated X dreams
     // smoke();  <-- I'm trying to quit
     if (family(status) == "Donna Reed")
       sayf("Good Morning %s, I am now awake.",FamilyMember);
     else getbathroom(first);
     getdressed();
     if !(AssemblerCoder) {
       eatmeal();
       watchnews();
       pet(DOG+CAT);
     }
     else {
       openfridge();
       eatavailable();
       if (family(status) == "disfunctional") yellat(rand(familymember));
     }
     // now we are ready for school!
     if (age < 17) bustoschool(); else drivetoschool();

   // SCHOOL LOOP
     int timeleft;
     for (int classloop=0; classloop<NumCourses; classloop1++) {
       goto(class);  // normally you aren't supposed to use goto's, but
                     // I don't feel like jumping
       timeleft = TimePerClass;
       if (class == "kewl")
         do {
           payattention();
           takenotes();
           participate(fearfactor);
           timeleft--;
         } while (timeleft > 0);
       }
       else {
         do {
           eyesopen(2);
           timeleft = TimePerClass - (lookclock() - startclass(classloop));
           CodeThink(timeleft);  // see function definition above
           noyawn();
         } while (timeleft > 0);
       }
     }
 } // end of school day

 So in summary, if you budget your time effectively you can accomplish quite
 a bit during the course of a normal school day.

_____The Solo Sample CD by Chuck Biscuits / Heretics

 Most composers I've talked to on the net would love to get some sample-CDs.
 Let's face it - they can be a very useful source of the building blocks of
 your music - raw sounds.  They are limited in their use by those with
 samplers, sampling synthesisers, or the tracker musician - those of us who
 cannot afford the first two, which are generally at the more expensive end
 of the synthesiser scale, are limited to the third choice.  But I digress.

 I'm reviewing the Solo (disc Solo-1) sample cd entitled "workstation volume
 one".  A humble title, at a humble price.  With the top-end sample-CDs
 costing in the range of 50 pounds UK, or $100US (and them just not being
 reall available in Australia [where I live] at all!), it's just too
 expensive for alot of composers to bother, especially if they're unsure as
 to the sounds on the disc and if it's really what they're after.  The
 workstation one sample CD cost me $34.95A (about $27US), and I picked it up
 from a local techno/hiphop record store.  Now, onto the actual CD itself:

 The CD is all audio, in Phillips redbook format (1-99 track, 44.1kHz,
 16-bit, stereo, 75 frames/sec).  Within the 54 tracks the composer is
 firstly given a collection of 24 drumloops, ranging from mid-range quick
 techno to 90-odd bpm rap and 120-odd bpm rock backbeat/funk loops.

 Inside the jewel case (which has a weird picutre of the inside of a canyon
 looking up on it) is enclosed a sample list, which is quite difficult to
 read, the text being similar in shade and colour to the background.  That
 aside, the information given here is very useful - most importantly, the
 speed (in BPM, beats-per-minute) is given for all 24 loops.

 There's actually two copies of the loops each, one in tracks 1-24 and a
 second copy in tracks 31-54.  The first set have some effects (mainly just
 a light reverb) and are slightly spatial in the stereo sense.  The second
 copy of the loops (in the same order from 31-54) are "as above/no fx/mono",
 which is good for tracker composers since we need mono samples - however
 you could create interesting effects by sampling both from the exact start
 of track (say with a CD-ROM red-book format audio grabbing utility) and
 crossfading the two in the stereo-domain.

 And the loops bring my first disappointment about the CD - the loops are
 played far too long!  Most of the loops, in the first set of them (tracks
 1-24), are played up to 30 times each.  This kind of space filling,
 although very annoying, is evident on a lot of "budget" sample-cd's simply
 due to the fact that they are cheaper, so you're going to get less on them,
 even if you see the disc and think "wow, 63 minutes, 650 megs of samples!".

 The second time the loops are played, with no effects and in mono, as
 stated earlier, we are saved from the inanity of the above repeating, but
 still, the loops are repeated twice or three times.  Since most of the
 loops are only 4 bar, and a couple have a variation in the second set of 4
 bars, only one loop would be required - this also makes it easier to loop
 if they haven't cut it off too short.

 If you're wondering what's in the tracks 25-30, this is where the
 "workstation" element of the sample CD is.  Tracks 25 to 27 are full of
 samples from the Roland JD-800 workstation synth.  The JD-800 was an
 attempt by Roland to revive some of the "old school" analogue controls,
 such as were evident on their classic analogue synthesisers like the
 Juptiers and the Junos (apart from the last Juno, the Alpha Juno 1 and 2)).

 The synthesiser didn't do too brilliantly, but is still capable of creating
 some great sounds, as is proven on the disc.  We range from lots of string
 pads and short 1/2 bar pad loops to "velo crunch" sounds which sound
 something akin to a Fender Strat being played through the cleanest
 distortion pedal you've ever heard, and then feeding back.  Great stuff.

 There's 25 samples in each track, so that's 150 samples in all in the
 JD-800 section.  The samples are well split up, having a second or two of
 space between them (about the only good thing about budget cd's, the filler
 space is there and you dont have to be a perfect looper/sampler to get the
 sounds out because they're not rammed up against each other such as in some
 "more-samples-for-yer-cash" CDs).

 Tracks 28 to 30 contain samples from the E-Mu Proteus 3/World collection.
 E-Mu have made a bucket out of providing these superb little sample-replay
 units (the Proteus series) with little programming functions. They're
 mainly a preset unit, however they have sold like hotcakes, and the
 Proteus/1 (rock/pop) and Proteus/2 (orchestral) were accompanied a few
 years ago by the 3/World.  There's a lot of cool ambient/world/ethnic
 sounds in this section, some interesting pads, overall a lot of useful
 sounds.  There's a little too much of the Shakuhaci-type instrument on this
 sample cd, we have "Shakflute" in the JD-800 section, and "Koto", "Ney
 Flute", "Pluck", "Jade Spring" (oh how original preset names :), "Shinto",
 "Shakuhachi" and so on, in the proteus section (just to name a few). This
 is a little nauseating after awhile, but fortunately there's also some good
 sounds.

 I have just one major quam about the Proteus section, which is simply that
 the sounds are played too quietly.  You really need to turn up the CD
 player to be able to sample the sounds well, and by doing that of course
 you begin to add noise, which is unwanted and unnecessary - a little more
 care in the recording process would've improved this part of the CD no-end.
 You could of course rip the audio directly from the CD via a CD-rom drive
 assuming you have one, but this is very annoying if you dont, and it
 detracts from the overall usefulness of the CD a little.  There's 75
 samples in this section also, making 150 samples in the instrument section
 and 24 (*2) loops on the CD.

 Although it may sound like I've been bagging this CD, I really enjoy alot
 of the loops - and the loops are to the most part original, also, I haven't
 heard these lurking on any other sample-cd's, although I'm sure some of
 them are, I cant pick any of the loops out of many (only 1, to date) songs,
 and there's variety of great pad, lead, organ, synth and ethnic sounds on
 the CD.  The price was initially the reason I had a listen and checked it
 out, and for the price, especially over here, it would be hard to find much
 better.  If you're after a few loops and some interesting (yet useable)
 sounds, it's most definately worth a look.

 datafile:

     "workstation one" (solo cd-1)
     54 tracks, 62 minutes and 43 second
     2 copies of 24 drumloops
     150 instrument sounds

_____How to Get 'em

 After reading this issue of DemoNews, you may be wondering how you can get
 previous ones.  Well fear not!  There are two different ways to do so:

 1: FTP to hornet.eng.ufl.edu and go to /pub/msdos/demos/news/OLD_NEWS and
    start downloading anything you see.

 2: Now you can request back issues of DemoNews via e-mail.  Start a letter
    to listserver@oliver.sun.ac.za (any subject line) and in the body of the
    letter include "get demuan-list <index>" where INDEX refers to the
    index number of the issue.

    For example:  get demuan-list 43

    This would retrieve DemoNews #76 (part 1 of 2).

    For more recent issues that are split into multiple parts, you must send
    an individual request for each index number.

 <<Closing Comments>>

''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

 The quote this week comes once again from "Programmers at Work".  This
 should be the last time I use this reference as I have recently completed
 my reading of it.

 This excerpt comes from an interview with Jaron Lanier, father of Virtual
 Reality.

   INTERVIEWER: You have quite a collection of musical instruments.
                Which is your favorite?

        LANIER: I don't know.  It changes every week... Actually, musical
                instruments have a lot to do with computers.  They're one
                of the best examples of users interfaces in the world.

 Well, once again this was a small issue.  This will probably not continue
 as a trend into next week though.  We have several big articles planned
 that just did not make it to this week's issue.

 See you in CyberSpace,

                        -Christopher G. Mann (Snowman)-
