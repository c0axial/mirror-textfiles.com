COUNTDOWN TO SHUTDOWN
---------------------

Sixty-one days till I say "GOODBYE" to good ole U of F.  Thus far there are
THREE people who have mentioned interesting in taking over the demo site.
They are:

1) belgo@gnu.ai.mit.edu
2) crt@tiamat.umd.umich.edu
3) z_tompsettcj@ccsvax.sfasu.edu

Mail me at: dmw@sioux.ee.ufl.edu if you are interested.  I plan on making a 
decision in the next few weeks.

==========
STATS BACK
==========

The WASP site has the old stats back.  This STAT gives info like # of 
logins, where logins came from and frequency of each, frequency of files
downloaded, and the total file size downloaded among other things.

Of course ftp.uwp.edu has more interesting stats--like which directory
had the most files downloaded from and the file size downloaded from
each directory.

/////////////
SPRING BREAK
\\\\\\\\\\\\\

I invite anyone who will be visiting Florida for vacation (Spring Break/
whatever) to drop by.  I live in Gainesville which is located in the NORTH
Central location of the state.  A major highway runs 5 miles from the 
campus.  

--------
TV SHOWS
--------

One of my favorite TV shows was OUTER LIMITS.  I have, over the last couple
years, been able to collect 18 episodes thanks to TNT showing TWO OUTER
LIMITS marathons--9 hours each time.  I am looking to collect the other
(however many) episodes.  They are all in B/W and one of the BEST TV shows
I have ever had the pleasure of seeing.  I am also looking for the classic
One Step Beyond episodes.

Other favorites of mine include Twilight Zone (old and new), Amazing Stories,
One Step Beyond, Ray Bradbury Theatre, and Night Gallery.  I have been 
lucky enough to see almost EVERY Twilight Zone episode over the 5-7 years
I watched it in syndication.

Other strange shows I have enjoyed include Invaders (Remember the fingers),
Dr. Who, Six Million Dollar Man, My Favorite Martian, The Incredible Hulk,
Highway to Heaven, Cliffhangers (Does anyone remember this), Freddy's
Nightmares, Monsters (Excellent), and The Dark Side (Awesome show).

What do TV shows have to do with demos?  Nothing really I just though
I would stick in some of my favorite shows.

BTW:  ARMY OF DARKNESS is really EVIL DEAD III.  EVIL DEAD II was the BEST
      horror movie I have ever seen!

-------------------------
CONSUMER ELECTRONICS SHOW
-------------------------

I am not sure if it is OPEN to the PUBLIC this year in CHICAGO but I plan
on doing everything I can to GO.  Anyone else out there going?  Anyone
live in CHICAGO, IL?

CLOSING COMMENTS
================

--This weeks DEMOSITE quote comes from my Total Quality Management book:
"If you always do what you always did, You'll always get what you always got."

--Dentro by Ultraforce has a secret key combination.  It is as follows:
  CONTROL  RIGHT_SHIFT  F9  GRAY_PLUS  0    It will show a picture of the
  coders.  It works in the section with the scroll.

--This demo site now has over 106 DEMOS.

--The last 2 weekends I have noticed the WASP site was down for some time.
  I have no explaination for this.
