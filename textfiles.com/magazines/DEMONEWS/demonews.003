INCOMING
========
-(PutreFac)tion by SKULL has cool digitized SB only music.  Excellent!
-(MegaDemo) by Space Pigs.  Made in 1990 this demo is EGA and outputs music 
 via PC speaker
-(CDA-Xmas) demo.  I have not looked at it but CDA has makes demos.
-Chaos3d.  This is probably the newest version! Have not looked at it yet.
-Look for the Twilight Zone RNS demo which I expect to be out any day.

OLD NEWS
========

-Realthng = "Even Better Than the Real Thing" was created and distributed
 Sept 30 1992 by The Phoney Coders.  It uses the ROLAND sound board so
 if you don't have the ROLAND then expect no music.
-Mantaray has been reuploaded as mantaray.lzh.
-OVERLOAD by Hysterica will be fixed and re-upped VERY soon. Look for
 overload-fix.lzh for the version with the sound working properly.
-RBGdemo2 will be re-upped for those without pkzip v1.93 (more below).

======================
WHAT ABOUT OTHER DEMOS
======================

Mega thanks too all those people who have recently upploaded demos on the 
want list.  If you have any of the below (or others) perhaps you could 
donate them to the pub/incoming/demos DIRECTORY.

ULTRAFORCE :  Vega, Rebelful, Mach 3, Space Demo, Space Fun, Sphinx Demo
RENAISSANCE:  K2 Demos (Not sure if this is out yet)

Others:  RSI-DEMO, Odyssey Demo, CD Fish, and a working copy of Vectrat.

===========
COMPRESSION
===========

PKZIP is starting to piss me off.  People do not have recent versions 
(could it be because it is now commercial?), and it does not do a very
good job of compressing.  PKzip, PKpak, zoo, arj, and lha are the main
compression programs people seem to be using.  The best for compression
and speed is by far lha.  It beats the pants of PKzip (even 1.93) and it
is much faster than arj.  And who uses zoo?  My plan is to re-up all the
files so they are a single format--LZH.  LHA is one small file that can
be use to COMPRESS as well as DECOMPRESS--another reason why it is in a
class by itself.  Also, it is FREE--unlike the new PKZIP which everyone
does not seem to have.  If anyone is opposed to this conversion of files
then let me know ASAP.  I will attempt to do the conversion over a period
of a few weeks.  The conversion includes downloading (maybe?), virus 
scanning, including an ansi file with some of the demos (site location),
compressing (with LHA), and finally uploading.  Problems?

=========
TOO SLOW!
=========

Type "hash" to see how fast you are transfering files (if you care).  I
have noticed myself getting about one # (hash mark) per second.  My 
average transfer rate is somewhere around 1.50 Kbytes/s--which is bad.
That is somewhere around what a fast modem can do.  Is the problem a 
slow site, bad line, or long distance?  Well, I figure it is just a
slow site and there is not much that can be done about that.  So, if you
WANT fast then do what you can to find another SITE that is willing to
have these demos.  I am all for it--but make sure it is fast and not just
for you. The question is, who will volunteer?

=======
WRAP UP 
=======

-Remember to type "get DEMO.NEWS_? -" if you want to read these text files
 while on line.  Only and idiot would do that with something like UNREAL--
 please don't try to read a binary (.zip,.exe,.lzh,.arj) file while online!
-I also try to update the ABOUT.DEMOS file whenever I get new demos so be
 sure and read that if you want to find out about a demo before getting it.
-For those who can't wait to get a new demo remember you can always go into
 the pub/incoming/demos directory for the newest arrivals.  However, be 
 forewarned that if there is a problem with a demo there (i.e. virus,
 trojan) I will not be held responsible. 
-Oh yea, at 131.234.2.32 there is a demo directory under /pcsoft/msdos/demos
 (i believe).  I wonder if any of them are REAL demos?  The system had a 
 slow transfer rate for me.  Anyone with the time want to check these out 
 and let me know?
