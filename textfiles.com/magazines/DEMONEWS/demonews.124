==[Articles]===================================================================

=-----------------------------------------------------------------------------=

 :: "Introduction"
 :: Snowman / Hornet
 :: r3cgm@ftp.cdrom.com

 Hello all, and welcome to DemoNews issue 124.

 I'm back.  (how's that for brevity?)

=-----------------------------------------------------------------------------=

 :: "A Graphician's Tip Book - Part 2"
 :: Shaithis / Psychic Monks, Immortal Coil
 :: shaithis@dreamscape.com

 _____Introduction

 Ummm, I'm gonna start out this article by making a few "bug-fixes".

   1. I was wrong about MCGA.  It could display 320x200x256 or 640x480x2.
      (Thanks to Rimbo for the info.)

   2. Pale pink is low in saturation but high in intensity.  Oops. That was
      actually a mistake on my part.  I knew what I meant, but I typed the
      wrong thing... that's it... ;)
      (Thanks to Samuel Marshall for that one.)

 Alright.   With that out of the way I'll continue.  In the last article I
 mentioned that we were going to jump right into Dpaint in this one.  I lied.

 I figured perhaps I'd do one more introductory article, this time dealing
 with basic terms used by us "graphicians".  Is that a real word?  Oh well. :)
 I realize that most of the people who aren't scrolling past this to get to
 Trixter's article already know their terms, but in case there's anyone out
 there who doesn't, this article is for you.  [NOTE: There is no article by
 Trixter in this issue.]

 _____Anti-aliasing

 Anti-aliasing is a gift of the gods.  It's what takes a decent picture and
 makes it great.  Quite simply, it is a subtle blending of the outer edges of
 a form in relation to the forms around it.  This gives said form a more
 natural looking appearance, as opposed to the "Cut and Paste" look it might
 otherwise have.  It makes the form fit better.

 Most 32-bit apps (Photoshop, Fractal Design Painter, etc.) will anti-alias
 anything you are inserting or moving automatically.  Some older programs,
 such as Dpaint-paint, will not do this by themselves.  Some ancient programs
 will not do it at all.  (Dpaint's anti-aliasing feature is not great,
 however, and my next article will deal with a better method to use if you
 want to anti-alias in 256 colors).

 _____Layers

 This is a feature that not all programs have.  Some do, some don't.  I'll
 cover them briefly here, and then in more depth when I get to Photoshop
 (which uses them very well).

 Layers are separate sections within a picture that combine to create the
 whole.  Say you are thinking of inserting a font on top of the picture you
 just created, but you are unsure if the font will look correct or not.  Or
 you know the font is right, but you are unsure what effect you want to add to
 it.  Simply create a second layer, put the font there, and it can now be
 edited and altered without affecting the background you spent six hours
 creating.  The layers can then be compressed to a finished picture at your
 will.

 _____Shading

 This is not a program feature, but I want to discuss various techniques for a
 moment.  There are multiple kinds of shading as most demosceners know well
 enough (Gouraud, Phong, etc.).  In 256 color still art, I have found that
 there are two types of shading that work the best.  Imitating Gouraud shading
 is relatively easy and creates a nice, clean effect (more on that in a later
 article).  "Bitmap" shading also looks very nice and involves gradually
 lessening pixels of the first color overlapping the start of the second. (For
 an example of this, see tigerkid.zip in /incoming/graphics/images).

 _____Texture

 This can be a program feature or it can be hand generated.  Texture is what
 determines whether your image looks like metal, glass, rock, Slime Mold Pus,
 or whatever it is your image is supposed to look like.  How you achieve this
 texture is entirely up to you, but it is important that you achieve it
 correctly.  (Hint, there'll be a tip coming up for Dpaint involving the
 creation of marble texture.  It works VERY well).

 _____File Format

 This one is both important and unimportant depending on your use.  How do I
 save my work?  Dpaint only gives you the choice of LBM or PCX.  However, if
 you are working in other programs, you may have the choice of GIF, JPG, TIF,
 PIC, EPS, or many more.  JPG, in general, provides the best compression.  GIF
 has some compression as well, but not as much as JPG.  These two are the most
 common WWW formats.

 TIF, PIC, and EPS are printing formats.  If you are creating extremely high
 resolution, printable pictures, it is unwise to go with JPG or GIF because
 printers and CMYK film outputs HATE them.  PCX is usable, but TIF or EPS is
 your best bet due to compatibility and quality of printing.

 _____Conclusion

 That wraps up this article, seeing as this line exceeds my space limit. :)

 My next article will definitely begin on Dpaint and other 256 color image
 editing programs.  I'll see you then.  Remember: if you have tips, questions,
 comments, or error corrections, please feel free to contact me at the address
 below.  Until next I write...

 :: "NAID '96, A Newbie's Opinions"
 :: Kilowack / MIRACLE
 :: klaks@bu.edu

 _____Introduction

 My first (and hopefully not last!) NAID encounter was, how would you say,
 fascinating?  The quality and quantity of demos was staggering, and I think
 this time, we've upped the ante on the Euros.  The top three could easily have
 taken on anything that Europe's put out.  Anyway, enough about that.

 NAID'96 was very well planned, kudos to the organizers.  With so many events,
 activities and competitions, I don't think any of us got more than 6 hours of
 sleep over the entire weekend.  There are a few peeves though.  Here's the
 list:

 _____Los Angeles Smog

 Right, I know it's Montreal, but there was enough smoke exhaled at NAID for
 the tobacco companies to consider supporting us!  Hey!  A new sponsor!  But
 seriously, for some of us who are a wee bit susceptible, a smoke free NAID
 would be a good idea.  Correction.  Make that an INCREDIBLY good idea.

 _____Food

 For those of you who took some time to eat, food in the main hall was rare
 and in small quantities.  Yeah yeah, there's Harvey's Grease Pot outside and
 the Quebec imitation of Dunkin Donuts (Commander Ici!) but for some of us who
 were busy coding or drawing, having at least a decent supply of food in the
 main hall would have been nice.  Maybe a freezer stacked with cheap pizzas
 and a microwave would do the trick.

 _____Deadlines

 A final foreword on the actual deadlines of the compos would be nice.
 Especially the intro compo. 12:00 AM friday night?!  Many of us didn't get
 there until 2AM!  Well, actually, that was just our group.  Still, the 12AM
 deadline on opening day is a little stiff.  Maybe postponing that to 9:00AM
 on saturday would go a bit easier on many of us.  Or perhaps a concise and
 definite deadline mailed out to the competitors before NAID.

 _____Showers

 Did anyone shower?  Around Sunday, I noticed a funny odor in the air. Could
 be my imagination.  Personally, I got up at 6 AM (actually, I was up till 6
 AM!) to make sure I sanitized myself.  Someone should have posted a schedule
 of the shower times, especially since some people in the room were getting
 rather mal-odorous.  It's not that they didn't want to shower, just that
 every time they went, the shower's were closed!  By the way, the showers were
 very nice, just that infrared thingy took forever to activate.

 _____Organizers

 Congrats to the organizers for an incredibly good time.  Only problem is that
 you're leaving!  Well, I guess everyone's got to take their own path
 eventually.

 _____Conclusion

 Well, that about sums it up.  One thing for sure, reading and watching a
 group's demo is one thing.  Actually meeting them in person is a completely
 different experience.  We should have some more of these NAID things.

 To the organizers, there's just one final request before you go.  Write an
 article on how you organized and got sponsors for NAID.  Many of us were
 quite influenced and would like to try to organize something similar (or at
 least a small party).  Maybe a FAQ would do.

 Viva la NAID!!!!

 :: "Top 10 Reasons Perisoft Should Have Won the NAID '96 Gfx Compo"
 :: Rimbo / Lucid
 :: rimbo@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu

 From the home office in Austin, Texas...

 10. Because the lady could have said "PeriSoft" with more enthusiasm
       [phoenix]
  9. So he could whack Snowman with his purple stick. [stein]
  8. Because then we won't have to hear Mosaic say, "except Peri...he
       blows" [rimbo]
  7. So he'd stop whining about the music compo [necros]
  6. Wouldn't yell out "Capacala R00LZ!!!!!" [phoenix]
  5. Because his Ma brought him to NAID last year [diablo]
  4. Yet another scene trivia question answered with "PeriSoft" [necros]
  3. Because the better he does in art, the fewer 64-channel IT's he'll do
       [necros]
  2. Hip, early 80's hairstyle [fred]

 ...and the #1 reason PeriSoft shoulda won the gfx compo:

  1. He won't threaten to sue if he doesn't. [rimbo]

 :: "The Virtual Music Contest Mini-Report"
 :: Garfield / RA, Infinity
 :: pjscorreia@mail.telepac.pt

 The Virtual Music Contest was Portugal's first demoscene related event.
 VMC was like Snowman's Music Contest series, but only Portuguese musicians
 and judges were allowed to enter.

 The quantity and quality of the entries we had was far beyond what we
 expected since the demoscene around here is a bit small.  With events like
 this, we sincerely hope we're helping the Portuguese demo/music scene to
 develop.

 The songs are available from ftp.cdrom.com.  Please take a look at some of
 them and tell us what you think.  Thanks.
