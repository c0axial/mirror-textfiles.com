ANSI:  There were 11 BAD ansi PACKS uploaded:  bad93-1.zip, bad93-2.zip, 
       bad93-4.zip, bad-0693.zip through bad-1293.zip, and bad-0194.zip
       Also, a CORP (corp0394.zip) ansi pack was upload.

DEMO/MUSIC CD ROM
:<:<:<:<:<:<:<:<:

Does anyone out there know of any DEMO (only or mostly) CD?  I am very 
interested in getting such an item.  If there is none then maybe one
can be done.  The cost for a MASTER CD is around $1500 and to press
300 CD's cost $1.79 for each CD.  It works out to be quite cheap and
effective if you can sell what you make.  Permission from any and all
demo groups is something "I" can guarantee with a $10 US (or less) price.

Another idea is to release a music/data CD.  I have never heard of such
a product but it has most likely already been accomplished.  Snowman and  
I have thrown around the idea to produce a CD with 10-20 digital songs
in AUDIO CD format and have about 40-50 megs of MODS/misc with the space
left over.  Does anybody know if this can be done?  Would anybody be
about to STUDIO MASTER the 10-20 SONGS we would need for the CD?  Finally,
does anybody know of companies that can MASTER the AUDIO/DATA CD for us?

See SNOWMANS article for more info regarding the music/data CD.

Hello,
	This is Snowman, and I am a baaaaaaaaaad man.  :)  Recently, I
deleted the /LEINAD directory because I thought that our space
restrictions were greater than they (given all the ANSI packs uploaded
lately :) and I removed a directory which apparently people have since
been asking about.
	Now, I DO have my own personal storehouse of songs/programs, but
I fear they are grouped by file format, and not by author.  During the
next month or so, I will ask you all to upload any songs you have by
C.C.Catch, Skaven, Purple Motion, Zodiak, and of course LEINAD.
	With your help, we can make this the bestest demo site in the
whoooooole world.
	BTW: I just downloaded 2 new Purple Motion songs last night from
Music Connection, so look for them soon.

As always, you can flame me at r3cgm@dax.cc.uakron.edu

MAKE or BREAK? #1  by Snowman (r3cgm@dax.cc.uakron.edu)
-----------------
-------------------------------------------------------
 
Starting this month, there will be a regular column in this little
newsletter called "MAKE or BREAK?" which will put new music programs
in the spotlight.  Due to space restrictions, I have to be very
selective in what I keep on this FTP.  Consequently, the fate of new
music programs will be decided by YOU.  In this article, I will give
you a list of new programs to be challenged.  Download them, kick
'em around a bit, and write me back if you like them or not (include
comments about the file if you want to - they might be posted here in
this newsletter).
 
For those of you who are uploading new programs to this site, don't
get upset.  Look at it this way, you will now probably get a lot more
downloads than you normally would.

MUSIC CONTEST ][ UPDATE
-----------------------
 
        An international music competition is due to be announced on
May 1st of this year.  Until then, I will keep the details as secret
as I can.  However, there is one aspect of the contest that I can not
do in private...
        A while back, I had the idea to make cassette tapes with Music
Contest ][ winning songs available.  This idea was expanded greatly
when a friend of mine suggested that we put them on CD.  Unfortunat-
ely, he only has access to a WORM drive (writeable CD-ROM drive, not
audio CD drive).  This same friend is willing to put up a little bit
of $$ provided we can find someone who has the ability to produce
audio CDs.  THAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN.
        I had thought it would be a really great idea to put BOTH
audio and file data on the CD.  I don't know if this is possible or
feasible though...
        If you know anyone who has a studio, or even just a standard
1/8th inch audio feed to a direct audio CD write, I would be very
happy to know about it.  Production should be fairly small (100-200
prints, depending on how good a response I get).  I figure that even
if not many people buy them, I can sell at least 25 or so to friends
and family as a novelty item.  :)
        It is preferable that the studio be within a few states drive
from Ohio.  This is where I am, and I most certainly would like to be
present at the recording to make sure everything sounds correct, etc.

I would like to see more demos that stray from the mainstream "do what is
in" (aka copy the best group) attitude.  Yea, something more BUTTMANish.
Any thoughts?

Happy Easter...
