VOTE
====

Remember the PANIC demo by the Future Crew?  Well, it had a VOTING form
with it which FC hopes you fill out if you want to see their DEMO magazine.
They need about 90 or so more VOTING forms filled out before they consider
releasing the DEMO-disk magazine.  So, VOTE and send your VOTES to:
jtheinon@kruuna.helsinki.fi (Future Crew internet contact)
Everyone who votes shall have their name mentioned in the DISK-MAG.

--------
TAKEOVER
--------

I will announce who shall be taking over the DEMO SITE next week.
This TAKEOVER will take place on EASTER unless otherwise noted.

/////////////
SPRING BREAK
\\\\\\\\\\\\\

I invite anyone who will be visiting Florida for vacation (Spring Break/
whatever) to drop by.  I live in Gainesville which is located in the NORTH
Central location of the state.  A major highway runs 5 miles from the 
campus.  

-------------------------
CONSUMER ELECTRONICS SHOW
-------------------------

The CES is open to the PUBLIC one day only--June 6th (sunday).  
I do plan on going to the CES, held in CHICAGO,IL.
But lodging if of my main concern.  Does anyone live in CHICAGO?

------
TRAVEL
------

I can fly just about anywhere for a minimal fee.  Most likely vists this
summer shall be:  Youngstown OH, Chicago IL, Seattle WA, and Northern CA.
If anyone lives in any of those places or anywhere else for that matter and
provides me transportation and lodging I will probably visit.
I am willing to TRAVEL--anywhere.
BUT, my main concern this summer shall be a JOB (Electrical Engineering) so
my reason for traveling to many of the places I shall will be due to trying
to secure an EE job.  Anyone got any EE job tips for me?

-----------
DEMO COURSE
-----------

A user proposed to setup a course on programming demo's. Item's
could be explained like basic graphics programming in assembler, making
simple scrolls, colour cycling, simple vector graphics, making your own
fonts, recommended literature, standard assembler procedures for
playing music files (mod, voc, 669).

If you're interested he's willing to try to set this up. But first he would
like to know how many people are interested and if the demogroups are
willing to supply him with information and assembler procedures.

If you are interested in such a course or if you and your DEMOGROUP
are willing cooperate please send a mail to GBRINK@NKI.NL

--Perhaps a BOOK can be written in the future as a result of something
  like this.

================
CLOSING COMMENTS
================

--I will be mailing out a "CONTACT LETTER" and disk with a DEMO on it to
  approximately 20 demo groups--mostly in EUROPE.  I have CONTACTS in
  NORWAY,SWEDEN,FRANCE,USA and still could use one or two more in central
  EUROPE.
  If there is enough space on the DISK I am willing to include stuff by 
  other groups.  Just let me know.  The main concern with MAILING the 
  stuff is the IMPORTANT letter that will be included.

--This weeks DEMOSITE quote comes from Jack Soo (Barney Miller):
                         "Enjoy your time."

--This weeks joke comes from FUNNY PAGES:  As an honor for President
  Clinton Dodge (Auto Company) shall be releasing a new car.  It will 
  be known as the "Dodge Drafter."
