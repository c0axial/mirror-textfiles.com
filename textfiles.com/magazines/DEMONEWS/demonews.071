 "HORNET" is the name of an FTP site on the internet.  It is a place where
 people upload and download files.  However, HORNET has grown much larger
 since it was first created 2.5 years ago by Dan Wright.  Now HORNET
 releases a weekly newsletter called DemoNews, and is starting to offer other
 services.  HORNET specializes in the "demo scene", and files that are re-
 lated to demos, coding, music, or graphics are welcome.

 It is going to take several weeks before everyone is ready to do their jobs
 here on HORNET.  I only have 28 hours in a day to work with (we worked on
 a new time compression algorithm in Computer Science class this week).

 Denthor and Ryan Cramer are now both writing articles for DemoNews on a
 regular basis.  My next step is to get the Link-Manager set up.

 I have been preparing a "How to Run HORNET" document.  This should be
 finished up early next week.  Once this is out, people working on this site
 should have a better idea on how to do things.

 There will be space limitations for each section from now on.  We keep
 running out of room.  This is out of my control.  To help compensate, I will
 be setting limits like /music directory must be under 70k.  If a directory
 goes over the limit, then the oldest thing in there will be deleted.

 I will be putting more responsibility on Ryan Cramer and Denthor and taking
 a couple of people of the "active demo-operators" list.  Solutions to
 problems require thought, not brute force.

 The Demo's size must not exceed 3 megs (100k for intros).There is no time
limit,but it shouldn't last an eternity. The Organizers reserve the right to
skip a given part if they judge that it is best for the public (15 minutes of
vector balls could put anyone to sleep).
 All demos will be run, by default, on a choosen computer with a Gravis
UltraSound card (512k) or SoundBlaster Pro. If for some reason you want it to
be run on your own computer, notify us when entering your submission
to the compo so that the techs can hook it up properly.

Music Compo
-----------
 All the songs will be played by default on a choosen computer with a Gravis
UltraSound card or SBpro via Dual Module Player. If you have a file format
DMP cannot play or you don't want to use DMP to play it, be sure to have your
own player. There will not be a seperate compo for multi-channel and 4 channel
songs.Song length cannot exceed 6 minutes. Limit one song per person.

(A Message from White Noise)

    Sorry Christopher, I haven't been very clear from the start.  I had
taken for granted Dan had let you in on this, but as I felt, he didn't.  Not
that he had to anyways.  Let me therefore introduce myself and my work
properly.

    I am Jean-Francois (aka Jeff) Poirier, also known as White Noise.
I've been around demos ever since they started on the C64.  I am quite
active on IRC and am a music composer on the IBM PC.

    The whole DemoNews/HTML project is a parallel project to DemoNews
that started a few weeks ago.  HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
and is the command structure used to create World Wide Web documents.

    A few weeks ago, I was looking at DemoNews and telling myself "darn,
there's GOTTA be a way to push DemoNews one step further in multimedia.  I
mean, it IS a newsletter cetnered on multimedia demos from the start,
ain't it?"  At the same time, I was discovering Mosaic, the WWW and HTML.  I
therefore started experimenting with HTML and DemoNews.  The result is
DemoNews/HTML, which is ON Hornet, accessible via the URL given in DemoNews
itself.

        Now I currently am not satisfied with the look I gave to
DemoNews/HTML, since I retained all the ASCII logos and everything, and
since it all is in one file.  In other words, I adapted DemoNews to the
highway, but left a LADA engine in it.

    Thus, in the past few weeks I started rethinkng the entire
DemoNews/HTML venture, and started looking at how I could turn in into a
real WWW publication, using multimedia nad all the possibilities HTML
offers.  I started working on a new structure for the document as well as
grafx.

    What I am going to do, since you didn't know the project even
existed, is finish the product this week and send you a document summarizing
the entire design of the thing.

    I am thinking about a graphical DemoNews (including snapshots from
products and demos mentionned, links to description pages (for groups, ie
links that give info on any existing group)), linked to the WWW, exploiting
all of the available facilities of the web.

    That, briefly summed up, is the DemoNews/HTML project.

    jeff,
    aka White Noise.

            Interview: Basehead of Imphobia/Cascada, KLF, and iCE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This week, I'm doing an interview with Basehead of Imphobia/Cascada. He
 was previously a member of the demogroup Mental Design, and is the most
 recent member of Imphobia/Cascada. Most of his newer stuff is not released
 because its all been done for various productions and such, but you'll be
 hearing a lot from him in the future. I've been hearing some of his "beta
 test" songs, and I think that they are fantastic. From the stuff that I've
 heard, Basehead is one of the top musicians in the scene. One of his more
 recent songs called "Forever" appeared in the music disk called Epidemic
 (which you should have all checked out last week, =).

 Basehead's music sets him apart from other musicians in the scene because
 most of his stuff is VERY unique. If you've heard his stuff, you know that
 he's got his own style. Much of his music has a very newage and ambient
 feel to it. I would also consider Basehead to be the master of percussion.
 Here's the interview conducted on 11/19/94:

 [start of interview with: Basehead of Imphobia/Cascada]

 RC: How did you get interested in tracked music? What sort of music
     background do you have?

 BH: Hmm.. let's see, going way back to the C64 days, and SID tunes.. when
     i was much, much younger, the son of friends of my parents was big
     into the C64 demo scene (i'd say this was '86-'87), and he hooked me up
     with a whole variety of stuff.. disks of songs, demos, bootintros, etc..
     That was the beginning of things.. of course when you first see/hear
     this kind of stuff, you never think it's possible that you yourself
     could get into doing it. So.. time passed, a few years later i got an
     Amiga 500.. looked at tons of demos, heard tons of songs on it.. spent
     hours attached to it. At this point, i had never called an LD board, and
     all the stuff i got had been obtained from a few local boards, and
     sent on disks by the same guy who had given me stuff in the first place.
     Again, i didn't attempt anything myself, just admired the work of
     others. Finally, in the spring of '93, i got my first PC.. 486/50, which
     was a fantastic computer for the time. SBPro came with it.. i figured,
     hey, there's gotta be a scene on this platform too, right? So now that
     i had a bit more money, i made some LD calls.. got onto boards that
     were stockpiled alot bigger than anything i could find locally, and
     got to experience all the glory (pffft) of renaissance and future crew
     demos. I was not as impressed with 'em as some people were, because
     i was used to the higher caliber demos and productions coming out of
     the amiga scene.. but i thought it was interesting that things were
     starting to get serious over here too. Sooo, after all this interest
     in demos and tracked music became too much to hold back on, i searched
     out for a good tracker.. i was gonna start doing this shit myself.
     Anyway, i got FT (the original).. and couldn't believe how much of a
     piece of junk it was (or so i thought..) I had tons of musical training
     in real life, and i couldn't see how one could get used to composing
     music looking at little numbers and letters in rows. Looked too much
     like debugging a file to me =) So i gave up on that.. and came upon
     the only sheet music tracker (to my knowledge).. KingMod. This thing
     i could get used to, and though i didn't know how shitty it was at the
     time, i could actually DO things in it. With all its bugs, i give it
     credit for getting me started.. and i think alot of you would be
     surprised at the quality of the songs i churned outta that thing.
     In fact, about half of my released songs were made in it.. i didn't
     compose with anything else until ST3 was finally released earlier this
     year.


 RC: What music would you say your most influenced by? Either from CDs or
     MODs, etc?

 BH: Well, it depends alot on the style i'm writing. When you're talking
     about dance music, i'm more influenced by other mod writers.. because
     i believe some of the best dance hybrid styles are written by
     tracking musicians, and i enjoy them alot more than most of the
     commercial shit. However, artists like Orbital, The Orb, Spooky, etc..
     have influenced me in that style. I listen to alot of jazz, funk, and
     real mellow music, too.. this is what has influenced me in most of
     my other trackings. Also, i get inspired from fooling around myself
     on a piano.. i've been formally trained for 12 years. Although the
     mood and style have been influenced more by outside listening, the
     tracking technique and tricks, and stuff like that has been influenced
     by other modules. Most of my influence comes from older amiga guys,
     like Groo, nhp, dizzy, etc.. as well as the god of all time, Jch
     (the legendary C64 SID musician).


 RC: Now that you've joined Imphobia/Cascada, what plans do you have for
     the future? (any productions?)

 BH: Well, Darkness tells me impcda is looking for a new coder, and once
     that is obtained, they will get back to work doing some demos and other
     productions. Currently, i'm trying to get a tiny chiptune together for
     a bbs intro they're releasing, as well as working on songs for a
     musicdisk (there is no tentative release date, so don't ask =) Besides
     continuing in the demo scene, which i'm sure i'll do for a while yet,
     i want to get into commercial things.. maybe movie soundtracks, etc..

 RC: You obviously are interested in lots of different styles of music
     (ambient, techno, newage, demo music, etc), what would you consider to
     be your favorite type of music to write?

 BH: Truthfully my favorite style to write is what you would consider
     "Muzak" .. really mellow, slow, jazzy stuff. Next to that, maybe
     ambient, atmospheric styles. I'm really not into writing traditional
     "demo music" or "techno" .. because i always think it sounds like
     utter crap while i'm writing it..

 RC: What equipment do you use for composing? (ie: what tracker, sampler,
     etc)?

 BH: Well, i sample alot of sounds off of CD's.. both normal and sampled
     ones, using Wave for windoze (turtle beach). Often, i sample sounds
     at a friend's house who has numerous synths and samplers, and this
     is the same place i do alot of my tracking. I have been using ST3
     since it came out.. it's not mindblowing at all, it doesn't have any
     amazing features.. but it's easy to write with, and i'm comfortable
     with it.. i don't plan on switching to FT2.

 RC: What is your list of releases, and where can we find them?

 BH: Truthfully, i have no idea.. =) I don't upload any of my songs to
     ftp sites or bbs's. The only way they've gotten around is from
     other people spreading them. My KLF releases can be found on
     freedom.wit.com (the new KLF ftp), but i don't know the directory
     off-hand. I've had a few songs in musicdisks and intros, and i've
     seen even some of my more obscure stuff on various bbs's. A friend
     of mine compiled a discography of my works, and we plan to set up
     a service where people can email us, requesting a certain work, and
     it will be uumailed back to them.. but this isn't finished yet.
     If you ever see me on IRC (#trax,#rave,#amigascne,etc...), you can
     ask me to send you the newest updated discography, and then you'll
     know everything i've released. I can also send you a song if you
     want a certain one..

 RC: Any people you'd like to greet or additional things you'd like to say?

 BH: Yeah, quick greets to Majesty, Khyron, Necros, and Maelcum.. for
     being the cool guys that they are, and for putting up with my shit
     (especially Mael and Maj).. i'd just like to say in closing that
     people stuck on Purple Motion and Skaven (who are good composers,
     granted), should really examine the roots of tracked music, check out
     some of the classic amiga mods, as well as some of the stuff still
     being composed on both platforms.. even tho they may not be spread
     around too much. I think you'll be amazed and surprised.. and
     alot more inspired. You'll see where musicians like PM and Skav got
     *their* inspiration (and samples =) That's about it, i guess. If you
     want to contact me.. email me at ssn@pcnet.com, or you can call me
     for any reason 24/7 (not that i'll be around 24/7, but.. =) at
     +1-203-264-7053.. and ask for Dan (though i doubt anyone else will
     answer my line.)

 RC: Thanks for taking the time for this interview...

 BH: No problem.. thanks for asking.

 More on Fast Tracker II
 -----------------------
 In last weeks article about Fast Tracker 2, one of the things that I
 mentioned as a problem with the tracker was the fact that I could not get
 my samples to sustain. I sent a message to Loot of Triton to see if he knew
 how I could fix this, and here was his reply:

  ---[begin quote]---

 RC> I can't get any of my samples to sustain like they should, even when they
 RC> are looped. The tracker stops playing them as soon as I let go of the key
 RC> on my keyboard. How can I fix this?

 You had some serious trouble with your old samples? When you load an old
 sample it'll get a default envelope value (envelope no. 1) and that one
 doesn't have the "volume envelope" button on. So if you want to have that
 continous sound you must click ON the "volume envelope button", thereafter
 save the instrument as .XS and everything will be all right! (I hope) :]

 ---[end quote]---

 Apparently Triton has released a number of XM modules, but I have yet to
 find them on the net. Below is a listing of all of the modules that Triton

 I get a hold of it, I'll stick it on hornet right away.

 Special thanks to Loot of Triton for the information on FT2.

 After another week of screwing around with FT2, I'm still having trouble
 getting used to it. I guess that for the time being, I still prefer Scream
 Tracker ]I[. What does everyone else think? Please send me some feedback
 and I'll post the results in next weeks music section.

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Special thanks to HeatWave for the ascii logos.

 Thats about everything for this week. Until next time...

((Section 6...Coders Corner))  <BY>  Denthor [Asphyxia]
==============================================================================

 Hi there everyone. As you probably read last week, I will be writing a
 column here each week, My name is Denthor (in Real Life : Grant Smith),
 and.. and ... I am a democoder!  (People around the room stand up, slap me
 on the back.  "Admitting it is the hardest part"  "It is cureable"  "There
 is always hope")

 Anyway, you may have seen my work in the various Asphyxia Productions,
 forefront of which are Psycho Neurosis and the Asphyxia VGA Trainer Series.

 There is still some confusion as to what I will be writing here. The way I
 got this column was as follows :

 Christopher : I want someone to write a column.
 Denthor     : Me! Me! Pick me!
 Christopher : Hmm... who should I pick ...
 Denthor     : Me! Me!
 Christopher : Oh, well, I guess it will have to be Denthor.
 Denthor     : Yaaay.

 Two days later ...

 Denthor     : Errrm, Christopher, what am I supposed to write for this
               thing?
 Christopher : You decide,
 Denthor     : Your'e joking. What should I write.
 Christopher : Think of something.
 Denthor     : Should it be a heavy code thing? Each week a "So all you have
               to do is plug the above through a reverse warped inverse
               matrix with a bit of noise and you will have a triple
               hypertext plasma"
 Christopher : Errrm....
 Denthor     : Or just a discussion? "Hi, I'm Barney the Denthor; Today we
               learned a valuable lesson about code sharing."
 Christopher : NO! Er, I mean no. Just ramble on about something.
 Denthor     : Oh goody, I am good at that.
 Christopher  <Aside> : Oh boy, what have I done?

 Anyway, I have decided that I will generally fool around with a few things
 and see what response there is.  I will discuss how some demo effects are
 done (especially new ones), tell stories (like those at the end of each
 trainer), and generally waste bandwidth ;-)

 If you have any topics, comments etc, mail 'em to me at
 denthor@beastie.cs.und.ac.za    (the .za stands for South Africa. I live
 on the east coast, near the city of Durban, the province of KwaZulu-Natal)

 If you want to grab a copy of the trainers, mail the above adress with the
 subject line request-list, and my mailserver will get back to you.

 Um.

 Okay, that's it for now, I will start my reign of terror next week.

 PS. Anyone wanna send me a GUS...you don't get them in South Africa... :-)

==============================================================================
((Section 7...Artists Corner))
==============================================================================
 Starting next week, we will try to have an article in here.  Jester and
 Stony are two people I expect to be contributing.  One of the main topics
 will probably be ray-traced vs. hand-drawn art.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(New Files)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Graphics play a big role in the production of demos.  However, HORNET has
 very few utilities or programs dealing with art.  THIS WILL CHANGE.

 To start, graphics in the demo scene can be divided into two categories:
 hand-drawn and ray-traced.  Both are legitimate forms of creativity, and we
 will be presenting articles in DemoNews which argue this issue.

 There are two individuals I have selected to help out HORNET in improving
 the art section: Jester (ray-trace), and Stony (hand-drawn).  Both will be
 contributing articles to this newsletter, and both will help to put some
 files on HORNET dealing with their respective areas.

 For now, I will try to allocate 4 Megs of space to Stony.  He will be
 uploading utilities and players for this section.  Jester will have 3 Megs
 at his disposal.

 ANSI takes up a ton of room, and this is bad for HORNET.  As a result, I
 will be looking for an alternate site to keep the ANSI on.  Jason (Cavalier)
 will still be on-staff, and I will probably ask him to write an article
 every once in a while for DemoNews just to let us know what's up in this
 area of the scene.

 If you want any ANSI packs, grab them this week.  They will be gone by next
 Saturday.

((Section 8...ESCAPE Demo/Music CD)) The Final Chaper!
==============================================================================
[From Dan Wright]

Finally the CD is here...and if I did not have STEREOLAB in my CD player I'd
be listening to it right now...really.

This week (Wednesday) I mailed out the details on the CD to all who reserved
a copy.  However, a few LETTERS did bounce so if you are one of the people
below PLEASE contact me cause when I mailed you it bounced and I do not
know if my second attempt reached you.

Anthony Woods--sector@cyberspace.net (user)
Tom Grandgent--tom.grandgent@wizardbbs.com (?)
Jorge Vasquez--vasquez@if1.ufrgs.br (?)

I did correct a few bounces but the above list contains those I believe
did not receive any word on the CD release.  If you know anyone or are
one of the above DO contact me (dmw@gate.net).

In case you have not been keeping track the CD contains 209 megs of DATA--
190 of this is demos/intros.  Basically this whole eng.ufl.edu /demos/alpha/
directory as of OCT 5th(?) 1994 is included on the CD.  All the files are
ZIPPED or ARJed.  There are also 12 D/A songs--9 from MC2.  So, if you did
not like the MC2 winners then you probably won't like the music on the CD :(

I won't critize or comment on the CD--we will let you do that HERE.  Suffice
to say it turned out pretty good and you WON'T be disappointed.

Does anyone know if that ASM'94 CD ever got released?  Only a couple people
from Finland ordered "ESCAPE" and none of them were Future Crew members. Go
figure.  I am actually surprised at the percentage of people in demo groups
ordering the CD.  I believe it is quite low...then again quite a few groups
do not have internet access and how many people actually saw the IMPHOBIA
article I wrote...anyone...anyone.

Be sure to let us know what you think--both the good and the bad.

Dan Wright...dmw@gate.net

==============================================================================
((Section 9...Advertisements))
==============================================================================
No advertisements this week.

==============================================================================
((Section 10...Miscellaneous))
==============================================================================
The /music directory will now be under some space limitations.  The maximum
amount of files for each directory are specified below:

        Directory       Maximum Room (Megs)

  /music/               65 (this may be increased later)
        /MC              7
        /disks          20
        /programs       15
        /songs          20
        /other           3

All but the top 10 MC1/MC2 entries have been taken offline.  This will
help out a bit.  In addition, the /klf and /time directories will be removed
and the songs will be put into the appropriate /songs directory from now on.

==============================================================================
((Section 11...Closing))
==============================================================================

The quote for this week takes the form of a definition from Webster's:

   MEGALOMANIA -
     1. A highly exaggerated or delusional concept of one's own importance.
     2. An obsession with doing extravagant or grand things.

Your happy megalomaniac,
