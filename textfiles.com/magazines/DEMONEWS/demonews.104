=---------------------------------------------------[Introduction]--[Snowman]-=

 Hello all, and welcome to DemoNews issue 104!

 I'm really pushing to get this issue out now, so here some quick notes
 about various things:

 1. Would anyone be interested in an ALLFILES.TXT mailing list?
 2. Subscribers are way up this week.
 3. At our current growth rate, we will be out of room in about 1.5 months.
    Joy.  The "under ***" music deletion system now has higher priority.
 4. We are working on getting ftp.luth.se to start mirroring us again.
 5. Watch out for Hornet's "Coder's Compo."  Trixter is heading this up.
    I'll see if I can get him to write an article about it for DemoNews.105.
 6. Due to the size of this issue, there was not enough space for the next
    installment of "4DOS 4DEMOS".  :(
 7. For those fans of the VGA Trainer Series, you are in luck!  All of the
    tutorials are once _again_ being converted by myself.  Several things
    are being changed or improved upon: no inline assembler, consistent code
    formatting, better coding practices, clearer descriptions, etc.  I will
    not even release the first one until I have up to number 5 or 6 done (so
    you still have a little wait left).
 8. We are becoming hopelessly overwhelmed by the new music uploads.  For
    a temporary period, we are seeking an individual or two to help find
    and catalog music that was released at various parties.

 Gotta run now...

=-----------------------[Review of Lotus Position by Basehead]--[Ryan Cramer]-=

 I recently downloaded Basehead's new music disk entitled "Lotus Position"
 and was quite amazed by the excellent work. The music disk does not include
 an interface or a player, you must use your own player. In some ways, it
 would have been nice to have an interface, but when you consider it, a
 music disk is about music and not about an interface.

 Basehead's Lotus Position proves that a killer music disk does not need an
 interface and I believe that Lotus Position is one of the hottest music
 disk releases in the PC music scene. Following is a detailed review of each
 individual song. I hope that you enjoy the review!

 _____Freedom at Midnight

 This is a song dedicated to Basehead's girlfriend, and I guarantee you that
 Basehead *REALLY* scored the night after she heard this song. As for the
 title of the song, Basehead said that it has "special meaning for Sai, but
 that we should draw our on conclusions". As you can see, I have drawn my
 own. :)

 The first thing you may notice is the huge size of this song, it is almost
 one meg. If you are stuck with a 512k, or even a <GASP!> 256k GUS, then I
 truly feel sorry for you. It would be worth your hard earned money to
 upgrade your GUS merely to hear this song.

 Freedom at Midnight is perhaps one of the most professionally sounding
 songs tracked on the PC. The samples are really beautiful and abundant. The
 feeling of the song is much in the same style as Basehead's ground breaking
 work with his Epidemic song, and CDAGAME.S3M.

 However, Freedom takes this style to a new level. The song does not sound
 tracked. It truly sounds recorded and your unsuspecting friends may be
 asking you what CD is playing!

 What style is this music? Well, its classic Basehead style. What is
 "classic basehead style" you say? Consider that to be a mix of New Age,
 Jazz, and percussion oriented music. Freedom definitely fits into this
 description, and it's Basehead at his best!

 While Freedom may be somewhat slow to start, it does get you into a more
 relaxed and music listening state to adequately prepare you for your
 "Freedom at Midnight" experience. The excellent bassline work on top of
 dreamy chords and background flute melodies with drifting piano chords
 really creates a beautiful atmosphere.

 The highlight of the song comes at the end with a really excellent jazzy
 groove. The music progresses from a relaxed somber state, to a motivated,
 energetic, and cheerful state at the end. It really leaves you feeling
 good. This song will be one to play when you are feeling down and need a
 pick me up. It works for me!

 _____Passion Play

 By far one of the most unique songs in this music disk, Passion Play
 combines so many sounds perfectly, and still maintains a surreal feeling.
 Passion Play also has the feeling of taking us on a journey with its
 advanced progressions more so then much of the other music does.

 It is one of my most favorite songs in the disk. This is the type of music
 that I hope we get to hear from Basehead in his future efforts with
 commercial game companies.

 The bassline is one of the driving forces in this music and it sounds very
 finely tuned with everything else that is going on in the song. It reminds
 me very much of Tangerine Dream in the early 80's.

 I hope that we get to hear more of this unique style from Basehead in the
 future. Even though he is leaving the scene, I hear that he will still be
 doing tracked music for Origin!

 Passion Play is one of the major highlights in Lotus Position. Passion Play
 also succeeds because it combines so many feelings into a very
 non-repetitive and not especially long song. So much of Basehead's music is
 very long, but Passion Play is refreshingly short compared to some of
 Basehead's other music.

 _____Open Your Mind

 I will tell you right off the bat, Open your Mind will be many peoples'
 favorite song in the entire music disk, and rightly so! The melody and
 groove are so catchy that you will find yourself in such an energetic state
 that it will be difficult to stay in your chair!

 This song is a MAJOR contrast to much of the other music in Lotus Position.
 Its very impressive that Basehead can go from relaxed and surreal songs to
 totally energetic dance music like Open your Mind.

 Open your Mind is some of the best dance music I've heard anywhere. I
 consider this song to be far and away the best that I've heard in PC music
 scene dance music. Basehead is truly the authority on this style of music.
 Open your Mind continues where Arcadia-2 left off.

 While Open your Mind explores many different avenues, it does not go off
 tangent at any point. It always stays with the same melody. In some of the
 songs best parts (mainly the beginning) there are many intermingled
 electronic sounds creating and incredibly technically advanced groove!

 My only complaint would be that the song does not need to be quite as long
 as it is and there is a lot of repetition involved which is often the case
 with this type of music.

 Open your Mind is mainly driven by its percussion, powerful bass lines, and
 classic dance melodies. This is the type of music the tracker was designed
 for!

 _____Smooth Operator

 While this song has a cheezy sounding generic and over-used title, the song
 has some of the best percussion work in Basehead's history! In fact, the
 song *sounds* tracked because such complex percussion work is rarely heard
 in recorded music.

 While the progression and bassline sound somewhat generic, and the song
 does not sound especially original, it is very impressive tracking effort
 with an amazing groove. There is also some especially amazing tracked organ
 work around pattern 24h.

 This song reminds me very much of work by HeatBeat and other famous Amiga
 musicians, and Smooth Operator was no doubt influenced by their work. Don't
 misunderstand me though, everything here does indeed sound 100% original,
 but Smooth Operator conforms to a "style" which is something that Basehead
 rarely does.

 Part of what I appreciate so much about Basehead's music is his lack of
 conformity to any sort of style in favor of creating something entirely
 new. However, as a well-rounded tracker, it is especially important to do
 music such as Smooth Operator to aid in developing new styles and
 understanding existing ones. For many that really appreciate this
 particular style, Smooth Operator is an excellent feat of tracking wonder!

 _____Last Request

 Last Request has a lot of history behind it. The first fourteen patterns of
 this song are entirely composed by C.C.Catch of Renaissance over two years
 ago.

 At the time C.C.Catch was working on this song, I was in New York visiting
 the Renaissance team and we were all hanging out at Tran's apartment in
 Brooklyn. Kenny brought his song on a disk and played it for all of us on
 Tran's 386/16 and guitar amp.

 The music was so classically C.C.Catch, and many of us fell in love with
 the song from the first listen. Kenny (C.C.Catch) had been doing a lot of
 techno style music and we had not heard anything in this "Amnesia" style
 from Kenny in a long time. It was really refreshing to hear this work and I
 think it was some of Kenny's best work since Amnesia.

 At the time the song was only about fifteen patterns and was unfinished or
 in a "beta" version as Kenny called it. What you hear in the first fourteen
 patterns of Last Request *IS* the song that was on that disk. For reasons
 unknown to any of us, Kenny never finished the song. I think that he just
 did not know where to take the song after those first fourteen patterns.

 I guess about a year and a half later, Kenny gave the song to Basehead to
 finish, and this song became Last Request. Basehead really did a beautiful
 job at maintaining the quality and evolving the song from Kenny's original
 work. While Kenny's and Basehead's parts in the song are distinctly and
 noticeably different, they fit so perfectly together that it makes you
 yearn for more Basehead + C.C.Catch work.

 Kenny's parts in this song give the feeling of being on a sailboat, swiftly
 cruising the ocean. As the progression continues, you can feel the wind
 blowing and the boat flying. The music is very visually stunning.

 Then around pattern fifteen Basehead's section comes in and takes us under
 water and into the abyss while still maintaining the original feeling, but
 somewhat more relaxed. The flute melodies are among the best and most
 beautiful that you will find anywhere.

 Basehead's portion puts you into a surreal and relaxed state, but when
 Kenny's part returns again, it brings you back into reality above water.
 Much like sleeping on the beach, and waking to hear the relaxing waves and
 feel the warm sun. As you might have guessed, I think this song really has
 the effect of generating some visually stunning images.

 The grooves in this song are also quite excellent. I would compare them
 (especially towards the end) to Mannheim Steamroller's work in terms of
 feeling. Last Request is sure to be a classic that will be remembered by
 all in the PC music scene for years to come.

 _____Steppin' Out

 At nine channels, Steppin' Out is the only song in Lotus Position that is
 less than 16 channels.

 The Nitty Gritty bassline is really amazing and reminds me much of Moby's
 work. This song also demonstrates Basehead's ability to track other styles
 of music.  Steppin' Out is a very impressive tracking effort of Late Night
 Smoky bar type music.

 While there is very little background chording, it would be unsuitable for
 this style of music. The piano and lead work is also quite impressive.
 Around pattern 25h, we get some BRUSH DRUMS! This is something that you
 will probably not hear in any other tracked songs, and it is very cool to
 hear.  As much of Basehead's other music, Steppin' Out once again
 demonstrates his amazing percussion ability.

 The leads and piano work in this song are killer!

 Close your eyes and you might think you are watching and listening to live
 music at the Old Irish Pub!

 _____Shades of Night 4 - Sea at Dawn

 This song is the fourth in the series of Basehead's most famous ambient
 work. Shades of Night 1 was perhaps one of the first ambient pieces done on
 the PC, and Shades of Night 2 was what really started to get Basehead's
 work very recognized. I think at the time Basehead received a lot of
 varying praise and criticism about SON2. Many people just did not
 understand it, and at the time Ambient music was only known to a few people
 in the PC music scene.

 For me, SON2 was some of the first ambient/techno music that I had ever
 heard, in fact it WAS the first. Basehead DCC'd the song to me on IRC and
 told me to turn down the lights, get relaxed and listen to the song with my
 eyes closed. This is exactly what I did, and ever since this time, I've
 been hooked on this type of ambient music. SON2 was over twenty minutes in
 length!

 A few months after SON2 was released, SON3 came out in Kosmic's EGG-2 music
 disk. SON3 was also around twenty minutes in length, but it had a much more
 professional feel then SON2 did. This can probably be attributed to
 Basehead's increase in experience (compare The Orb's older releases with
 their latest Orbvs Terrarvm). SON3 was also accessible to many more
 people's ears and some of it did resemble the style of music that has made
 Enigma so popular.

 Shades of Night 4 is entirely different from the first three releases, but
 it is equally ground breaking, and in many ways more-so then the previous.
 The best phrase to describe SON4 would be "Heavenly Dissonant". SON4 sounds
 unlike anything you've heard. The sound is very surreal and "high" feeling,
 yet it is still somehow dissonant. SON4 creates an atmosphere that is
 populated by visually surreal images.

 Like music from The Orb, SON4 has a lot of things going on in the
 background that sound very far off and full of activity. The song is based
 on the depths of the sea, but many of the effects sound straight out of the
 jungle too. There are many different unrelated sounds playing at once that
 are moving in a musically organized fashion. This music is quite a feat and
 I imagine took a lot of effort.

 About one third way through the song, we start hearing some bass lines
 which start to organize all of the sounds and give them purpose. In
 addition, one of the highlights of this song is some of the most hauntingly
 amazing and unique percussion work ever tracked!

 SON4 may not be as accessible for some as the previous SON3, but SON4 is
 ambient music in a much more evolved state, and it will no doubt lay the
 groundwork for many aspiring ambient musicians in the future. Basehead is
 the master at this type of music, and SON4 is some of his most amazing work
 to date.

 _____Conclusion

 I hope that you enjoyed my review of Lotus Position. I really enjoyed
 listening to this ground breaking music disk. 1995 has really been an
 amazing year for the music scene with releases such as Necros's Progression
 music disk and now Basehead's Lotus Position music disk.

 FM has really taken the PC music scene by storm and taken it to new
 professional extremes! It is really sad that Basehead will be leaving the
 scene, but it is also good that he will be expanding his musical abilities
 to mediums that can be enjoyed by many more people. I look forward to
 hearing Basehead's work in the future. If you have not yet heard Lotus
 Position, I hope that this review will encourage to download and listen to
 it immediately!

 Lotus Position can be found on ftp.cdrom.com. I will also be placing a copy
 of it on my computer at work.

=---------------------------------------------[Interview with Basehead]--[GD]-=

 Basehead (real name Dan Grandpre) is one of America's finest PC musicians.
 He has been an active composer for about three years, in which time he left
 his mark in several big-name groups, such as Five Musicians, Kosmic Free
 Music Foundation, and Imphobia.

 With the help of Necros, Charlatan, Maral, GodHead, and Khyron, Basehead
 helped found the IRC #trax channel. This was a result of the overwhelming
 number of musicians occupying space in the IRC #coders channel, the other
 of two heavily used IRC channels for the demo scene.

 Among some of his major accomplishments are "Can't fake the funk," a song
 that placed third in the NAID'95 music competition, "Forever," his
 contribution to the "Epidemic" musicdisk, a song in the Imphobia #9
 diskmag, various songs in all three EGG musicdisks, including two of the
 four songs from his "Shades of Night" series, and his musicdisk "Lotus
 Position," which also contains the last of four "Shades of Night" songs.

 And now, Basehead leaves behind the scene he had a big part in helping to
 shape. His sudden announcement came shortly after the release of his "Lotus
 Position" musicdisk. And to help clear up some of the misconceptions of his
 decision, and to discuss other related matters, we bring you this
 interview.

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Q: What was your very first knowledge of the demo scene, and when?

 A: Let's see... in 1986 or 1987, this kid next door (well he was 17 then)
    was really into the C-64 demo scene, and I saw demos from C-64 groups of
    the day... Fairlight, 1001 Crew, Danish Gold, W.A.S.P., FBR, etc.. and I
    was immediately interested.

 Q: Did you ever do any composing on the C-64?

 A: Well, just a bit, with a few SID composers/programmers.. but nothing big
    really.

 Q: How long was it before you moved to a different platform?

 A: I got an Amiga in '89... so I was on both the C-64 and Amiga until '91
    or '92 or so when I got a PC of my own.. but, I knew what was going on
    in the PC scene the whole time too since I had a friend into it.

 Q: Were you in any groups during your C-64/Amiga days?

 A: Yeah, so many that I won't even bother to mention... a few big ones too.

 Q: Did a lot of people you knew from the C-64/Amiga scenes move to the PC
    scene as well?

 A: Not really.. most went on to college/jobs/etc.. I still keep in touch
    with a few. Some went to the game development industry right away... but
    yeah, some moved to PC too. Although I don't think the PC and Amiga
    scenes have the heart that the C-64 scene did.

 Q: What do you mean by that?

 A: Well, it was just a lot more exciting I think.

 Q: How did you get your start as a PC musician?

 A: I always messed around but never really got down to business because I
    never took the time to learn trackers -- I am completely programming-
    language illiterate, and trackers looked too much like hex code to me.

    I am a born and trained musician, and I was not used to this type of
    format (beyond sheet music, I mean).. so when KingMod came out in '92, I
    attempted some stuff finally.. since its sheet music interface hit
    closer to home for me.

 Q: What different tracking programs have you used for the PC, both that you
    liked and didn't like?

 A: I've used every one ever made and distributed widely... my favorite
    being ST3, and least favorite being the Farandole composer. =)

 Q: How, and when, did you become affiliated with KLF?

 A: Well in '92 and '93 I talked to Maelcum semi-frequently.. but I was not
    really a decent musician at all.. then in early-mid '94 I did "Collapse-
    house" and "Shades of Night 2," which got me into EGG (the original
    musicdisk), and effectively then, into KLF itself in July... it had 8
    members or so at that point I believe. =)

    I sorta gained the reputation of being a one-trick techno-pony, and that
    really aggravated me.. which is why I released "Forever" in the Epidemic
    musicdisk in late '94... and that effectively shut most everyone up
    about that whole deal. =)

 Q: What kind of response did you get from your song in Epidemic?

 A: Sheez, a lot more than I expected.. maybe 40 (?) email or so over a
    period of a few months. I'm sure I'd still get some random lamer's
    ramblings about it if I still had my ssn@pcnet.com account. =)

 Q: In the beginning of 1995, FM was formed .. how long was it discussed
    before it came together?

 A: An hour.. =) Basically the same day Andy (Necros) and Jaakko (Mellow-D)
    came up with the idea, they called me.. and BigJim was around the next
    day when we decided on the name. It wasn't a planned takeover of the
    music scene or anything.

 Q: Scoring third place in the NAID music competition, were you happy with
    your placing?

 A: Well.. I don't put much faith in compo placing, especially because I
    think musicians should judge musicians, not just a whole crazy crowd
    that isn't even really paying attention too closely. I thought my song
    was better than Maelcum's, so 2nd woulda been cool.. =) but I'm not
    complaining. I think the whole compo was messed up anyway. *shrug*

 Q: When did you first decide to work on a musicdisk?

 A: Hmm I first decided to do a musicdisk when I finished "Freedom,"
    "Stepout," and "Smooth".. they were also sorta close-together projects,
    and I was very happy with them... and since they weren't released
    *shrug* I figured I'd wait it out, and do a few more..

 Q: At first, you had planned to do it with Stalker?

 A: Yeah.. that's true. I did those 3, and then figured I'd do a dual
    musicdisk with Stalker, who was also working on a bunch of tunes at the
    time. But that idea faded, since the disk would have ended up being
    really huge, so I figured we'd each do a separate one.. hopefully
    Stalker will release his for FM too.

 Q: When did you make the announcement that you were leaving the scene?

 A: Hmm, I don't remember exactly.. I think it was the night when I released
    my musicdisk, or maybe the night after.

 Q: What was the general reaction of others to that announcement?

 A: It varied.. a lot of people were sad or disappointed I guess, for
    whatever reasons.. a few were so to the point of anger, which pissed me
    off. As far as I know, nobody was happy about it -- at least I hope not.

 Q: How long did you consider leaving the scene?

 A: Seriously?  Well, probably since the idea of a musicdisk came to me.

 Q: Did anyone else know before you made the announcement?

 A: No, surprisingly.. I knew Andy (Necros) wouldn't be happy about it, so I
    didn't say anything until I told everyone else.. I thought he would
    leave before me, honestly, a few months ago.

 Q: There was a rumor that people wondered if your decision was related to
    you breaking up with your girlfriend?

 A: Well. this is a strange topic.. First of all, that's not true.. let me
    address this. It's nobody's business really whether or not we did break
    up, or what changes that brought about.. I'm neither confirming nor
    denying that we have. Problems yes, but everyone has problems. If I told
    someone that definitively, it was because as usual, I was tired of
    explaining myself. Leaving has nothing to do with her.

 Q: What plans do you have for the future?

 A: Well, for one thing, music is still in my future. I plan to release
    under a major underground label (not a specific one, just in general I
    mean).. and I still plan to do music for games far into the future.

    Maybe I will also release a scene S3M or two in the future, but I doubt
    it. I also will be doing the music for Kosmic's next demo.. since I was
    considering it before I left anyway.

 Q: Where will this demo compete?

 A: Hmm.. if we can get it done in time, it will compete at TP5 hopefully..
    I may be going to TP5, and if not, IOR would enter it anyway. =)

 Q: Will you still be working with Straylight?

 A: Of course.. that's what I implied by doing game music. Also, Siren
    (formerly Chromatic Dragon), known to me as Alex.. is now a part of
    Straylight. NO, there are not more openings... and no you can't APPLY,
    so don't email me about it. =)
 
 Q: How did you and Necros get in contact with Origin?

 A: We got recommended by a certain person (who will remain nameless) who
    knew them already, and he also showed them some of our work.

 Q: How much time did you put into Origin's "Crusader"?

 A: Hahaha... not much. I did 9 songs, and spent about 20-25 hours total.
    But for future projects, I will spend a lot more time.... especially if
    we end up doing the music for *censored* =)

 Q: Are you currently working with any other game companies at the moment?

 A: No comment =) Well, yes... and their names are *censored* *censored* and
    *censored*. We hope that the Crusader series music will be noticed and
    game companies will decide that tracked music is the future for game
    development.. not FM/GM, and not redbook/cd-audio.

 Q: So what made you decide to leave the scene?

 A: Oh man.. =) Well, even though I've only been tracking for 3 years, I've
    been in and around the demo scene for 8-9 years. And I've basically seen
    it spiral into an abyss of lameness.. especially in the last year or so.

    Also, I am sorta just plain TIRED of it.. so much more is to be done
    outside of the scene. It's a good starting place, but I'm just getting
    too old.. and I think I've made my mark.

    Plus, college is coming soon.. I've been slacking off for too long from
    higher education, and concentrating on the scene for 2 years straight..
    it's time to move on.
 
 Q: What are your plans for college?

 A: Well, 90% chance of me going to Berklee in the Fall '96 semester... 10%
    I will either switch to NYU, or wait another year. =)

 Q: If you could pick one specific thing that helped you "make your mark" in
    the scene, what would it be?

 A: I think working up to some sort of level before I started giving things
    out was a big part of being successful. By that I mean.. if you give out
    every piece of crap you've ever done from day 1, it's going to be hard
    to convince someone that you've improved: most people will give anyone a
    chance at impressing them with their music, but if they hear something
    terrible, chances are they won't pick up something with that label again.

    Also, let the work speak for itself.. don't go around parading what
    you've done. If the work deserves popularity and success in the eyes of
    the scene, then it will get it regardless of how you promote it.

 Q: Have you ever made MIDI music?

 A: Yeah.. i used to live 5 minutes away from Majesty (an oldschool #trax
    person too), who had quite a bit of midi gear.. and computer-based
    sequencing software too. I've done a lot of tracks, they're all lying
    around his new apartment on otari studio reels I guess.. maybe they will
    be priceless someday.. (yeah right) =) But he moved... he's about an
    hour away now. I didn't talk to him for like a 3 month period, and I
    haven't seen him since march.. its a real bitch.

 Q: What instruments or sound equipment do you own?

 A: I have a big black yamaha grand piano (mega-$$$), a shitty yamaha psr
    funstation, and a martin 12-string guitar from 1973 that they haven't
    made for 15 years =) (it's awesome) But that's it..

 Q: What other instruments or equipment do you have access to?

 A: Well, I have access to a great yamaha pro tenor sax, a 15 piece drum
    kit, a roland jv880, s330, akai s1000 and s3200cd, yamaha dx7-iifd, and
    lots of guitars and basses.

 Q: What's your favorite synth and why?

 A: Although the kurzweil k2000 is probably the best, I think the dx7 gets
    my vote because it just rocks the oldschool world.. it was so far ahead
    of it's time. A classic, sorta like the ensoniq mirage sampler.

 Q: What music theory education do you have?

 A: I have about 12 years of piano performance/theory.. I played drums for 6
    years, sax for 7, and guitar and bass on and off for 12 years also. As
    for straight theory, well it's been on and off since I started. I
    learned a lot on my own, and have had the last few years as solely
    composition/ theory study. I sorta "surpassed" my original teacher, and
    her teacher is my mentor now.

 Q: Were you involved with music in school?

 A: Yeah, from 4th-8th grade.. never in high school (9-12) because the guy
    there was a dick. He had his little piano player teacher's pet who was
    also in my grade.. she did everything, even jazz band.. and she SUCKED.
    She couldn't improvise at all and had NO rhythm skills.. he would just
    write out the whole part note for note, and she would learn it. He was a
    complete dick to me, anyway... I'm not sorry I wasn't involved. Our
    bands sucked.

 Q: What kinds of real music do you listen to?

 A: Everything from trance, to ambient dub, to acid jazz, classical, uhmm I
    love 80's new wave.. Some of my favorite groups are the cure, depeche
    mode, the orb, the fixx, frankie goes to hollywood, herbie hancock, eat
    static, sun electric, new order, etc..

 Q: Do you have any favorite tracker musicians?

 A: Hmm, if you consider everyone, active and non.. my top 3 are probably
    Audiomonster, Dizzy, and Vinnie (all amiga dudes). They all personify
    creativity. As for now, I think Dune and Necros are really great..

 Q: What was your first step when tracking a song?

 A: Generally, I would come up with a set of samples that I thought would
    fit the mood of the song that I wanted to do.. and then I would just go
    crazy for a few hours. =)

 Q: What role did theory play when you were tracking?

 A: Theory sort of played a subconscious part, because it came naturally
    after being in my head for so long.. definitely when I would be figuring
    out the melody and general chord structure.

 Q: Did you compose a lot on an instrument then transfer it to a tracker?

 A: Never.. not a single time have i played on the keyboard first. =) Except
    for a piano intro that I turned into a rather cheesy full song (loss),
    and an idea (nostalgic).. both are nothing interesting though.

 Q: What demo parties are you planing to attend at this point?

 A: Well, I will hopefully be at Naid'96, Mini Impulse 2 if it happens, and
    hopefully TP5 and maybe TG'96.

 Q: What do you have to say to people who think you have an ego or a bad
    attitude?

 A: Well, I just don't think they know me at all.. just because I'm almost
    the only person in the channel (#trax) who will say what their real
    opinion of something is, I'm considered arrogant. Just because I'm hard
    to please doesn't mean I'm egotistical.

    Also, it's partly that I make it known that I think most of the scene is
    a joke.. and I'm not particularly generous toward the "newbie" mob. I
    only really truly help out people who I think have a lot of potential..
    and I don't even do that anymore because I'm too busy.

 Q: How much does others' opinion of your music matter to you?

 A: Well, I'm not going to bullshit like most people do, and say "all that
    matters is if *I* like it, and if other people do too, then that's okay.
    But I do music for me!! *wank wank* *nose gets longer*".. I mean to a
    certain extent you do it for fun, but there's also the idea of wanting
    other people to like it, and you always are trying to impress someone in
    some way.

    It affects it more if the person is being closed-minded and saying
    things that are just plain WRONG.. if they say "I didn't like it cuz it
    wasn't really my style," then that's fine.. everyone is entitled to
    their own opinion.

 Q: Do you have any predictions for the scene?

 A: Hmm, I guess it all depends on what happens with telecommunications in
    the future. If it gets to the point soon that cd-audio can be
    transferred by normal everyday net users at a reasonable speed, then I
    think a lot more people will be getting into cd-audio.

    Honestly, I think there will always be a place for the scene -- because
    no matter how commercial something ends up, there are always the real
    people -- the hobbyists and enthusiasts who don't care about the money.
    The demo scene is the last bastion of enthusiast-only
    programming/multimedia left.. and whatever comes up, I hope it is always
    there.

 Q: Would you like to send out any messages to anyone?

 A: Yeah actually:

    To all of FM: It's been great, I hope you guys continue the greatness...

    Kosmic: Thanks for some great grooves, and a lot of fun at NAID...

    Not to be cheesy, but to all fans and listeners of mine around the
    globe. Thanks for being there.. I wouldn't have gotten nearly as much
    out of it had I not had any following. Some of these people who have
    been really dedicated fans/listeners that I've gotten to know really
    well are: Leviathan, Epeius, Heatwave, Ryan Cramer, Floss, Lord Pegasus,
    and Khyron. (and of course FM people! =)

    To the rest of the scene: It has been a blast, I hope you guys continue
    to have a great time like I have.

    To people in general: I will still be at bh@axs.net for the foreseeable
    future, and at the same snail mail address as I've given in the past in
    my sample texts.. but the phone number has changed (I'd rather not give
    it out).

    Also, I will be hanging around #trax for awhile too.. so I'm not totally
    out of it. Once I *do* have to leave IRC though, I will still drop my
    head in once in awhile to see how things are going.. I want #trax, and
    the tracking scene to continue and prosper, just as other people who
    have built it do.

 Q: Thanks for your time, and best of luck to you in the future.

 A: Thanks for the interview, and goodbye to the rest of the scene.

=---------------------------------------------------[Just a Thought]--[Rimbo]-=

 [taken from comp.sys.ibm.pc.demos]

 I'm sittin' here, staying up way later than I ought to be, and I just had
 this thought I'd like to share with y'all.

 Nobody wants to watch shaded 3D vector objects float around for 60 seconds
 each.

 If you've got a neat 3D effect, show it, and move on, OK?  You realize how
 much better Mighty would have been if they'd just left their
 Phong/Gouraud-shading routines OUT?  By the time you've sat through ten
 minutes of seeing simple phong-shaded/gouraud-shaded/texturemapped objects,
 you've forgotten totally about the awesome maze effect in the beginning,
 and you're just bored silly.

 Also, have you ever noticed that in ...just a random example... FC's demos,
 NO effect stays on-screen for any length of time at all?  Take 2nd Reality.
 The longest effect is the vector world, but even that is brief compared to
 how long NoooN or Complex or just about every other demo will force you to
 stare at a phong-shaded env-mapped torus.

 You know what else I miss about the demos of 3-4 years ago?  The sense of
 humor.  Or poetry, in the case of Renaissance.  Little bits and pieces
 which made the demos fun to watch...or whatever...things which had nothing
 to do with graphics or music or art.  The scrolly needs to come back, if
 only for the sake of the text that came with it.  And I ain't talkin'
 GREETS here, either.  Greets should go...they're dull.

 And why all of these black backgrounds? There's no reason why black should
 be the default color.  Why not a nice, rich, charcoal gray?  Blue is always
 a big hit.  Grif's Catchup! doesn't have a single black screen in it, and
 is all the better for it.  Come to think of it, why didn't Catchup! do any
 better at Assembly '94?  I only watch three demos nowadays from that compo;
 Verses, Heartquake, and Catchup!.

 This all reminds me of Assembly '93, when everybody was arguing about which
 great sequel should have won...CD2 or 2dR.  (Gee, the same groups that make
 the leading trackers for the PC trax scene.)  Many argued that CD2 had
 better coding; but 2dR won because it was MORE FUN TO WATCH.

 Hey, I got an idea.  Why doesn't someone make a trippin' demo that uses my
 486/100 to the MAX and doesn't have one stinkin' vector object in the whole
 thing?  Now THAT would be cool.

 So cut it out with the 3D objects spinning around for God-knows how long,
 okay?

 God bless.

=---------------------------[The Death of Data Connection BBS]--[Ryan Cramer]-=

 This is a short article to let you know that Data Connection BBS will no
 longer be a major demo BBS.

 Data Connection has been running since 1989, and for three years has been
 one of the largest Demo BBSs in the United States. Unfortunately, I no
 longer have the time to maintain the BBS as a great resource of demos, and
 have decided that the BBS will slowly be reducing its focus on the scene.

 In this day and age of the Internet, BBSs no longer are the place to obtain
 the latest releases. Now Internet ftp sites (such as cdrom.com), IRC, and
 newsgroups (comp.sys.ibm.pc.demos) are the major hangouts of scene people.
 I will be focusing my time more on these avenues.

 Data Connection will still continue to carry demo releases, but will no
 longer be a an exhaustive resource of scene material that it once was.
 Unfortunately, this is a result of a lack of time. Between school and a
 full time job, I have to place my priorities elsewhere.

 I would like to thank everybody that has supported the BBS through the
 years, and I hope that you will continue to call and say hi even though you
 may not find the latest demo releases there.

 Thanks.
