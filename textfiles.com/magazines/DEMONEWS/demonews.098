 Sorry about the lack of articles in this week's issue of DemoNews.  Next
 week we should have some very provocative information.

 Here are some little infobits I thought I'd mention.

 -All demos under /alpha are being moved to directories by year (like
   /alpha/1994, /alpha/1995, etc.)
 -TraxWeekly is now produced by Hornet.
 -From now on, most BBS intros uploaded to our site will be deleted.

 [This was supposed to be included last week but I forgot.. doh!]

 Hi there demonews readers...
 
 Well, this won't be a 10kb killer article,  I don't have much time to play
 with words right now as I'm again busy with another exams session...

 I just, like most of you, received that generic mail from Snowman today
 explaining the return of Demonews and i just wanted to write a little note
 on the issue. I've been reading demonews since issue 71 or so, at that time
 i didn't had any internet account yet so i leeched it from bbs'es and every
 Sunday I called Genesis bbs several times a day to check if demonews had
 been uploaded.

 As soon as I've been reading demonews, I've been surprised by it's good
 quality,  DemoNews had that special atmosphere you cannot find on many
 newsletters/diskmags and I didn't found that atmosphere back with that
 HornetNews/o1 method.

 By writing this little note I just want to say a "welcome back" to DemoNews
 and wants to encourage *YOU* the readers to take the opportunity to believe
 in DemoNews and to make of it the DemoNews it has been before...
 
 Regards,
 
 Darkness / Imphobia - jeff.van.audenhove@infoboard.be

 _____Introduction

 Hello folks.  Its been a long time since I've been able to just kick back
 and write a general editorial for DemoNews.  Over time, I've learned that
 you can ENGAGE your readers with ZIPPIE BLOWIE action pizazy words in
 random case, or you can cultivate their blossoming ids with grandiose and
 superfluous words that know one seems to understand anyway.  I opt for a
 ka-BOOM! compromise.  On to this article's topic...

   "Daddy, I wanna play on #trax but none of big kids will let me! :("
   "Well son, without hurting your feelings, its probably because you SUCK!"

 Class warfare.  We all know and feel it.  Maybe you (like me) were a wimp
 back in high school, admiring the football jockeys as they swept the
 cheerleaders off their feet, oblivious to your crafty new TI-81 program.
 Maybe you could barely afford a 2400 while your nerdy peers sported their
 shiny 28.8k's.

 You were different.  But somehow, some way, you found that small niche of
 friends who you could just be yourself with and not get teased.

 [abrupt transition]

 The demo scene is a rapidly changing place.  I shudder to think what even
 this newsletter will look like by issue 314.  The scene's music gets
 better, the demo effects become more complex, the graphicians use higher
 color resolutions... where does it end?  It does not my friend and _this_
 is the key.  The only constant in the scene is that it continues to evolve
 beyond our wildest expectations.

 "Scene Evolution" is not constrained to the hardware we work our magic on.
 As the ability to communicate increases, so does our ability to express
 ourselves and our desires.  With IRC, easy e-mail, and even budding audio
 over the 'net, people we used to know only by their nicknames suddenly have
 character and personality.

 Inspired by a #trax-junkie, I thought I'd take a minute to write about some
 trends I see forming.  Before you read on, go back up to the file listings
 above and just skim over the music section.  No, I mean it! Look at all
 those pretty uploads.  Over 100 songs, music disks, trackers, and players
 reviewed in one week alone.  Now go take a look at DemoNews #60 or
 something.  Quite a difference, eh?

 _____The Point

 What is my point in telling you all this?  Well, couple the ever-increasing
 number of new musicians in the scene together with better communication.
 What do you end up with?  Class.

 There are just so many people in the music scene that some sort of division
 will inevitably take place.  We can't see each other, so segregation based
 on skin color is out.  We don't transact money (at least that much), so
 class based on financial well-being is also not possible.  When you get
 down to it, there are actually very few things we all have in common.

 So we only have two elements left that are universally accepted. Ability
 and friends.  If you're a talented musician, you're k3wL.  If you have
 friends who are talented, you're k3wL.

 Thus we divvy up the music scene into 3 general blanket classes:

   1. The k3wL People
   2. The OK People
   3. The Lamer People

 _____How Does it Work?

 Let us assume we have a new musician named Garf (if there is actually
 anyone out there with this handle, forgive me).  Garf discovers the demo
 scene, Scream Tracker 3, and IRC.  Now Garf tries his to make his first
 song.  For practical purposes Garf is in pergatory, awaiting (dis)approval
 from his peers that will decide his standing in the scene.

 Let's say Garf's tune is horrible.  He's immature and annoying on IRC.  His
 destiny is decided: he's a lamer.

 Let's say Garf's tune (while unpolished) is _very_ good.  Garf befriends
 Necros and Jak on IRC.  Shooting toward stardom, Garf is now k3wL.

 Like it or not, each of us is undergoing this same process of selection.
 Many decide to sidestep this stepping up of upper and lower class
 classification by just ignoring the whole thing.  I'm one of these
 people. :)

 _____Conclusion (this is the good stuff)

 Here's some food for thought.

 I mentioned how the k3wL people and Suck people are chosen, but what about
 all those in between?  Those people, those great many people, can adopt a
 more neutral standpoint of the whole thing.  They can hate the upper class,
 and still feel good that they're not in the lower class. Its the kind of
 balance only a society can take.

 And my friend, the music scene is becoming a society.

=-----------------------------------[Music Contest 3 Thoughts]--[Ryan Cramer]-=

 _____Introduction

 Last week, the results for Music Contest III finally came out. The evening
 that they came out, there were more people on #trax then I have ever seen.
 It was amazing. It was a huge angry mob of angry #traxers waiting for the
 results. I thought that someone would go insane and start doing
 mass-flashes or something, but it never happened. Eventually the results
 did come out, and then everybody calmed down (apparently!).

 Now that the results have come out, I think that everybody is pretty much
 satisfied. But, I think that there was a small but unavoidable margin of
 error in the contest. Everything that follows are my own opinions and
 observations only...

 _____Observations

 Lets start out with the first and second song. I'd say that Jase's first
 place song and Necros's second place song were right in line with each
 other. If fact, I'm surprised we didn't see a head to head tie between
 those two songs. They were the obvious winners. I think that Jase's song
 has better initial impact, as a result, this helped him to take the lead.
 However, Necros's song had much better samples then Jase's song did. Both
 songs were outstanding.

 I was kind of surprised at some of the other songs that placed so high.
 They were all great songs, but most of the songs in the top 10 were all on
 equal quality (excluding the top 2 which were the obvious winners). One
 thing though, Markell Moss's 6th place song should have placed better. It
 was an excellent song that was up there with Jase's and Necros's song. The
 MC3 voting system did not do Markell Moss's song justice, it was really an
 excellent piece of work.

 I myself really thought that I'd place better then 8th, but such is life. I
 felt that I should have been in the top five, but then again, I did not get
 to judge my own song. :) Forget about me though, lets try to figure this
 one out. Stalker placed 29th!!! Stalker's song should have been in the top
 five, *easily*. I don't know how to explain why Stalker placed so bad. Go
 back and listen to his song, and compare it to some of the other songs in
 the top 10. Make your own judgments. I guess that I'd question the judgment
 ability of some of the MC3 judges. Stalker got ripped off.

 _____Analysis

 As I said before, I think that the voting system worked out quite well, and
 the results were fairly accurate. However, there is a problem in the voting
 system, and there is no way to get around it. The MC3 voting system did
 what it was supposed to, and it worked as well as it could have, but let me
 explain where the margin of error comes in:

 As an example, lets take Necros, and lets take MuzikMan. By some freak of
 nature, MuzikMan has managed to get his music and tracking abilities up to
 the quality of NiteWynd.

 Lets also take two MC3 CORE judges, lets say they are Basehead, and
 Popcorn. Each judge has 15 different songs to vote on. In Basehead's group
 of songs, MuzikMan's song happens to be the best in his group of songs
 (Base ended up with a really shitty group of songs, as many of the MC3 CORE
 judges actually did). Popcorn on the other hand ended up judging some of
 the best songs in the contest.

 While this may not be the case for all judges, this sort of situation does
 happen. Because MuzikMan's song is the best in Basehead's group of songs,
 he gives it a fairly high score like an overall score of 8. Well, Popcorn
 on the other hand has a bunch of great songs, he hears Jase's song and
 gives him a 10! Wow what a song! Then he hears the other songs which are
 also quite good, so he gives them scores like 9s and 8s and stuff. Of
 course, he's got a few bad songs too which get like 3s and 4s. Lets say
 that he heard Stalker's song and gave him an 8.

 Well, do you see what happens here? Two very unequal songs get equal
 ratings! MuzikMan's song is a piece of shit, but it was one of the better
 ones in Basehead's group of songs, as a result, it was placed pretty high.
 It was placed on the same equal plane as Stalker's song.

 [NOTE: The judges & musicians used here are for fictional purposes only
        and are being used for example purposes only. Don't send me no
        steenkin' email's about this! =]

 _____Conclusion

 Is there a better way to do the judging system? Unfortunately not, at least
 not realistically. The only truly accurate way to avoid the margin of error
 would be to have every judge vote on every single song. Because of the
 sheer amount of songs in the contest, this is not possible. As a result, I
 would have to conclude that despite the margin of error, the current voting
 system is really the best way to do it.

 Maybe in the future, it would be possible to have a few very dedicated and
 qualified judges vote on all of the songs, and have their votes count
 double or something. ...But who wants to do this? =]

 _____Closing

 MC3 is actually the largest scene music competition ever. There were
 almost two hundred total songs in the contest. Stop and think about
 that! I'd like to send congrats to everybody that was involved in the
 contest, no matter how well you placed. You should be proud that you
 competed in this event.

 Special thanks especially to Snowman and Floss that brought you this
 contest and put countless hours into managing the huge number of songs.
 Send them a thanx when you get the chance..
