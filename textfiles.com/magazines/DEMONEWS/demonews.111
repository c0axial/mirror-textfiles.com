 Hello all, and welcome to DemoNews issue 111.

 This will be my last DemoNews introduction in the year 1995.  I will be
 moving in one week, and Diablo will bring you DemoNews issue 112.  This
 issue should come out around 30 December 1995.

 If you would like to us to post information about an upcoming party,
 diskmag voting, or job offer, please write a 3-5 paragraph summary
 of the event and send it to us.  It is beyond our current ability now
 to post entire .nfo files in this newsletter.

 For reference, we are _intentionally_ keeping the size of this newsletter
 between 40k and 50k.  The reason for this is two-fold.  First, some mailers
 bomb on mail larger than 50k.  Yes, there are those out there who can not
 even handle a full 64k.  :(  Second, keeping our newsletter at a consistent
 size seems to provide a more stable image.

 Mercator of Illicit wanted me to mention that a new Austrian diskmag called
 "Inside" is starting up.  Please write to e9225889@fbma.tuwien.ac.at for
 more information and a voting charts form.

 We have added a new section to DemoNews this week called "Calendar."  Feel
 free to send us information about your own party so that we can post it.

 If you are an organizer of a new demo party, please take a second to fill
 out the form /demos/incoming/forms/newparty.frm so that we can better
 handle your party's uploads.

 Last but not least, I would like to take a moment to recognize one of the
 most dedicated members of Hornet: Diablo.  Each and every week, Diablo
 must deal with all the hassles associated with /music on our site.  He
 coordinates a team of music reviewers (not an easy task) and is responsible
 for assembling the pretty lists of music uploads (see above).  I look
 forward to having him produce an issue of DemoNews while I'm gone.

 See you all in 1996!

=----------------------------------[VGA Hardware Tricks, Part 3/6]--[Trixter]-=

 _____Preface

 Welcome to VGA Hardware Tricks, a six-part series written by
 Trixter/Hornet.  In this series, I'll be exploring ways you can push VGA
 harder to achieve new effects.  The emphasis of this series is twofold:

 The techniques discussed will work on any *standard* VGA card. (No SVGA or
 VESA video cards are necessary, but these techniques will work on those
 cards as well.)

 The techniques discussed require very little calculation, so they will work
 on slower computers.  (Some techniques, however, requires a lot of CPU
 *attention*, which means that while the effects are happening, they can't
 be disturbed by other calculations, etc.  Good Assembler programmers might
 be able to get around this, however.)

 This series is for intermediate to advanced coders, so there are a couple
 of prerequisites you should meet:  Example code will be given in assembler
 and Pascal, so familiarity with those languages will be helpful when
 looking at the example code; also, a familiarity with Mode X (unchained
 VGA) is required, as procedures like changing video resolutions will be
 discussed.

 This series covers six topics:

 1. Crossfading 16-color pictures
 2. Crossfading 256-color pictures
 3. More than 256 colors: 12-bit color  (this article)
 4. More than 256 colors: 18-bit color
 5. Copper effects in text mode
 6. Displaying graphics in text mode

 _____Introduction

 Displaying more than 256 colors on a standard VGA card isn't technically
 possible, and yet it has been achieved in such productions as Xography's
 Party 93 report and Orange's X14 demo.  But how?  The answer, oddly enough,
 is through our own human weaknesses--our brain.

 Our eyes, retina, and optic nerves are not as fast as a computer monitor.
 While this fact is obvious, think of the implications:  Images happen in
 our real world much faster than our eyes can process the information.  If
 this is so, why don't we see black areas all the time where our eyes are
 failing to see things?  The answer is a phenomenon called "persistence of
 vision."

 Persistence of Vision is our brain's ability to "fill-in" missing
 information that the eyes aren't providing.  Without it, we'd see black
 areas all the time.  :-)  In attempting to display more than 256 colors at
 a time, we're going to take advantage of persistence of vision to fool us
 into seeing more colors than are actually displayed.

 _____Overview

 This week, we'll discuss "12-bit" color.  (That term is slightly
 misleading; the number of colors that we'll actually be displaying is 3840
 colors.  256 colors isn't much of a difference, though, so we'll be calling
 it 12-bit color anyway.)  This mode is achieved by quickly changing the
 color of all the pixels in a picture between two different colors very
 quickly.  If they change quickly enough, persistence of vision "blends" the
 two colors into a single color.

 If you stopped reading right now to try this, you'd quickly find that only
 Pentiums are fast enough to change every single pixel in a picture once per
 frame.  Obviously there's an easier way to do this, and it works on slower
 386's as well:

 - Switch into Mode X (we need two video pages)
 - Set up the palette in a special way
 - Draw two slightly different versions of the same picture onto
   two different video pages
 - Quickly flip between both video pages

 Yaka / Xography first used this particular technique in Xography's The
 Party '93 report.  Later, he released an explanation of how he achieved the
 mode.  Excerpts of his excellent documentation in FAKEMODE.ZIP illustrate
 what's involved in making it work:

 (Documentation excerpt begins------------------------------)

 FakeMode is achieved by combination of several means:

 - Use Y-mode (320x400 at 256 colors and 2 pages)
 - Flip between the 2 pages at every vertical retrace
 - select the palette colors wisely
 - set pixel data in a special way.

 *** 2.1 Y-Mode

 Y-Mode (similar to X-mode) is a video mode for register compatible VGA
 cards, that pushes resolution up to 320x400 at still 256 colors and 2
 pages! The disadvantage compared to standard mode 13h (320x200, 256col, 1
 page) is that memory access is not so easy anymore (the pixels are split up
 in bitplanes). Here's the code I use to setup Y-Mode for FakedMode (in TASM
 3.1) [1]:

    pop di                      ;//restore value of di
    ret
  _F_initgraph ENDP
 ************************************

 That's it. I modified the original routine a bit as I keep WordMode; it's
 because it is easier to write FakeMode pixels in WordMode.  You can return
 to textmode or other graphics modes by normal BIOS function call (int 10h,
 Fkt 0).  The calls to 'initpalette' and 'inittimer' are necessary to
 install FakeMode and are not part of Y-Mode installation.

 *** 2.2 Page Flipping

 This is best done (I think) by synchronizing the timer interrupt with the
 screen. Just before the vertical retrace appears, the interrupt is called.
 The interrupt handler routine should now set the screen offset address to
 its new value and wait for the vertical retrace. Then it should reprogram
 the timer and return to the main program. When the vertical retrace occurs,
 the new offset address is loaded in the internal registers of the VGA card
 and invokes the next screen update. See [1], ([2]), [3].

 So we'll just have to:

 - hook the timer interrupt
 - write our own interrupt handler
 - synchronize the timer interrupt with the screen
 - still call system timer routine at 18.2 Hz from interrupt handler
 - program the timer chip to achieve MonoFlop mode.

 What could be simpler? :)

 *** 2.2.1 Hooking/Dehooking the timer interrupt,
           Synchronization with the screen

 Hooking an interrupt is quite easy; DOS interupt 21h has got functions to
 handle interrupt hooking (see below, routine inittimer).  To synchronize
 the timer int with the screen, I first set the interrupt speed much faster
 than the screen (256 Hz) and use a handler that counts up a variable
 'count'. Then I wait for a vertical retrace and let the timer run.

 When 'count' has changed at next vertical retrace, the timer still is too
 fast. I lower speed and try again, until 'count' doesn't change between
 start of timer and next vertical retrace. Then I know that with this speed,
 I'm just below the minimal speed. I increase it a little and now I know how
 long I have to wait aproximately between 2 timer int calls.

 Of course the value isn't exact, so I have to synchronize every interrupt
 call for new; that's done by the interrupt handler discussed below.  The
 routine 'closetimer' should be called when you leave FakeMode; it stops the
 timer int and puts everything back to normal.

 *** 2.2.2 The interrupt Handler routine

 This is the main timer interrupt routine which is called after every screen
 update and performs the page flipping.  There are three necessary things
 when you write a hardware interrupt handler:

 1. be sure to preserve ALL registers you use (push them and pop them later)!
 2. don't forget to acknowledge the hardware interrupt controller
    (mov al,20h   out 20h,al)!
 3. return from Interrupt with IRET, not with RET!

 Read the comments; they should explain everything.
 Literature used for this: [2], [3]

 There may be timing problems when you use your own hardware interrupt
 handler.  Especially the INT 13h calls are very time-sensitive, if a timer
 interrupt routine is called just when the processor is in INT13 handler,
 and the computing of the timer int takes too long, the computer may
 crash.  In such cases it may help to check if the computer is just in the
 INT13 handler when the timer interrupt is called (You have to hook int 13
 and set a variable; then continue with int13 handler.

 After the handler has finished, reset the variable. So the timer int can
 check this variable to see if INT13 handler is active or not.)  Well, I
 never had problems with INT13 and FakeMode, so I didn't implement this. :)

 *** 2.3 Palette Setup

 The palette is static; that means I don't change it when I flip pages. To
 achieve the 3840 color mode, I split up the colors to green and red/blue.
 The palette contains 16*15 values red/blue and 16 values green
 (16*15+16=256).  (16 colors red * 16 colors green * 15 colors blue = 3840
 different colors)

 To get harmonic greys, I set blue to the same values as red and green, but
 just leave out the darkest blue value (you can't see that one, anyway).  So
 when you set pixels later, you have to decrement the blue value if it isn't
 zero to get the right color. (The H_setsmallpixel routine of the example
 file included does that, for example.) The palette values are stored
 directly to DAC, but are also buffered in 'palette' to make later changes
 possible (fadein/out, setluminance).

 Here comes the palette setup routine:

 ************************************
  palette db 768 dup (?)          ;//buffer for palette

  initpalette PROC
    push di
    push cs
    pop es
    mov di, offset palette
    cld
    mov dx,3c8h
    xor ax,ax
    xor bx,bx
    out dx,al
    inc dx                ;//ah=red, bh=green, bl=blue
    mov cx,15
  initpal_outer:          ;//setup red/blue part of palette (0..239)
    push cx
    mov cx,16
    initpal_inner:
        mov al,ah
        out dx,al
        stosb
        mov al,bh
        out dx,al
        stosb
        mov al,bl
        out dx,al
        stosb

        add ah,4
      loop initpal_inner
      mov ah,0
      add bl,4
      cmp bl,4
      jne goon
        add bl,4
    goon:
      pop cx
    loop initpal_outer

    mov cx,16
    xor ax,ax
    xor bx,bx
  initpal_second:                 ;//setup green part of palette (240..255)
      mov al,ah
      out dx,al
      stosb
      mov al,bh
      out dx,al
      stosb
      mov al,bl
      out dx,al
      stosb
      add bh,4
    loop initpal_second
    pop di
    ret
  initpalette ENDP

 *** How to set pixels in FakeMode

 The main purpose of the way I set pixels is to minimize the flicker. One
 pixel on the screen consists of 2 pixels, one on page 1 and one on page 2.
 On one of the pages the green value is displayed, on the other the red/blue
 value.  Imagine I would set all pixels green values on page 1 and all
 red/blue values on page 2. I would get horrible flicker. To prevent this, I
 set the values like follows:

 if xpos+ypos=odd, then set red/blue on page 1 and green on page 2
   else set green on page 1 and red/blue on page 2.

 So I get a 1/1 raster, and each of the 2 pages contain both red/blue and
 green values.

 Look at the following routine to see how it is done exactly:

 ************************************
  _F_putsmallpixel PROC
  ;//values:  x=0..319, y=0..399, red=0..15, green=0..15, blue=0..15
    ARG x:word, y:word, red:byte, green:byte, blue:byte
    push bp
    mov bp,sp
    push di
    mov bx,x
    mov cx,bx
    and cl,00000011b      ;//calculate bitplane...
    mov dx,3c4h
    mov ax,0102h
    shl ah,cl
    out dx,ax             ;//...and set it
    mov ax,0a000h         ;//set destination segment
    mov es,ax
    mov ax,160            ;//set destination offset
    mov dx,y
    mul dx
    shr bx,1
    and bl,11111110b
    add bx,ax             ;//bx contains basic offset
    mov di,bx
    mov al,blue           ;//calculate red-blue value
    mov ah,16
    mul ah
    cmp ax,0
    je short smallpixgoon
      sub ax,16           ;// perform blue adjustment
  smallpixgoon:
    add al,red
    add cx,y
    and cl,00000001b      ;// select if green value on page 1 or 2
    jz short stypetwo
      mov ah,al
      mov al,green
      add al,240
      mov es:[di],ax      ;// set both pixels (on page 1 & 2)
      jmp short send
  stypetwo:
      mov ah,green
      add ah,240
      mov es:[di],ax      ;// set both pixels (on page 1 & 2)
  send:
    pop di
    pop bp
    ret
  _F_putsmallpixel ENDP
 ************************************

 In FakeMode the video memory is built up like this:

 Bitplane 0|  rb 0 | g  0 | g  4 | rb 4 | ...
 Bitplane 1|  g  1 | rb 1 | rb 5 | g  5 | ...
 Bitplane 2|  rb 2 | g  2 | g  6 | rb 6 | ...
 Bitplane 3|  g  3 | rb 3 | rb 7 | g  7 | ...
 Offset    |    0  |   1  |   2  |   3  | ...

 So one line on the screen uses 160 bytes of data in each Bitplane. The
 colors values for one pixel are stored besides each other (this is because
 I use wordmode).

 _____Code

 Code that achieves this effect in both C and Pascal is available on
 ftp.cdrom.com in the directory /pub/demos/hornet/demonews/vgahard in the
 file vgahard3.zip.  This article is stored there as well.  To compile the
 code directly, you'll need Turbo Pascal 7.0 or Borland C 3.1 or later.
 (The code can be compiled on earlier compilers as well, but some slight
 modification might be necessary.)

 _____Notes

 Mr. Data was kind enough to point out that Atari coders have known about
 these kind of tricks for years, because the Atari had more limited graphics
 hardware than the Amiga.  Unfortunately, many of the techniques he
 described to me that were used on the Atari can't really be applied to
 today's VGA hardware, because some of the techniques oscillated between
 video pages and colors too slowly.

 The older monitors of the time had slow phosphors, so the *monitor itself*
 "blended" the colors, but today's monitors have very fast phosphors, which
 results in terrible flickering if trying to use an Atari technique.

 _____Conclusion

 12-bit color displays very solid results, but you've probably noticed its
 major weakness by now:  It requires so much CPU time ensuring that the
 video pages keep flipping that it's not really useful for animation. Next
 week, we'll tackle a different solution to this--and gain over 250,000 more
 colors in the process!  Have fun until then!

=------------------------------------[Australian Demo Party (OZ96)]--[Random]-=

 The idea for Oz96 was formed around mid-year 1995 on Bloodnet, one of
 Australia's demoscene networks.  It seemed that the Australian demoscene
 has flourished enough to a point where a party could be held with great
 attendance - this seems to mirror the circumstances around NAID, North
 America's demoparty (except that Oz96 will hopefully have better
 organization :-).

 Oz96 is not *truly* the first Australian demo party. There have been some
 other small gatherings, such as Coven'95, but Oz96 will be the first party
 involving the majority of the Australian Scene.

 Oz96 is a party for the demoscene, a gathering of all those demofreaks out
 there as well as other demo-related occults such as the underground music
 and art scenes.  As such, in the spirit of the scene, it is a friendly and
 most importantly non-profit venture.

 The party will start at about 5:00pm on Wednesday the 17th of January 1996,
 and finishes around midday on Friday the 19th of January. Of course, if you
 want to leave earlier, FINE! ;) We were originally planning a weekend, but
 well, you can't have everything!
