GENERAL STUFF
*************

Anyone know when "Composers contest" results will be released?  
I'm ready to sixth (or move) that compo directory.  "Epic Fallacy" was 
the best out of the dozen or so I downloaded. Certainly a top five within
the contest.

HAVING problems uploading?  Have you tried ftp.eng.ufl.edu instead of
wasp.eng.ufl.edu or eng.ufl.edu?  I believe the "WASP" ftp site has
moved to "HORNET."  Same location just a different machine.  The
"ftp.eng.ufl.edu" should automatically route you to this new address.

I noticed a few corrupt files this week:  gsn0606.zip dg15nfo?.zip, a
few other ANSI's and some music.  Be sure to use BINARY when transferring
files of compressed nature.

AS USUAL:

The TOP25DL does not work properly.  Until the "ftp.syslog" is enabled
(I am working on it) it will still keep sending you old or no stats.

Dear Demo Creator/Group/Enthusiast:

TO THE POINT

I am creating a demo CD-ROM and would like your permission to include any
and/or all of your productions on this CD.

SNOWMAN AND THE PROJECT

Snowman and I are collaborating on this CD project.  Snowman is the organizer
of the Music Contest ][ (MC][) and will be taking care of the Digital Audio
portion of this CD.  I am a maintainer of the internet demo site
(ftp.eng.ufl.edu) and will be gathering all the demos for the CD ROM portion
as well as funding all or most of the project.

SPECIFIC INFORMATION

The Digital Audio (or "Red Book audio" = 44.1kHz) portion of the CD will
consist mainly of songs entered in Snowman's MC][ contest.  I highly recommend
musicians/composers as individuals or groups to enter.  If you do not want to
enter MC][ but feel you have a great contribution (composed whenever and for
whatever) then certainly submit that (to Snowman or me) because there will be
some space for non MC][ music--anywhere from one to seven songs will be non
MC][ related.  We anticipate having 40-50 minutes (i.e. 450 megs) worth of CD
music (10-15 songs) mastered using a Gravis Ultrasound (unless someone
recommends/donates something better) and DAT recorder.

The data portion of this disk will consist of MC][ related material, demos,
and possible other demo related items (i.e. music disks, disk mags, source
code).  I anticipate this taking up between 120 to 200 megs of space.  I will
be gathering most of my demos from the internet and relying on you people for
the rest--those hard to find demos that no one uploads to the internet demo
site.  You can help me acquire these files by a) Uploading what we don't have
to ftp.eng.ufl.edu, b) Sending them to me via mail using floppies or QIC-80
formatted tapes that I will return, or c) Calling my data/fax/voice line and
uploading directly to me.  The people who really need to help me with this are
typically those with BBS's or big collectors.  Hey, look at the benefit--would
you rather have demos on your hard drive, floppy disk, or CD ROM?

WHEN AND HOW MUCH

Due to MC][ ending late August we will not be able to release this CD till mid
October.  Our plans at the present time are to have 200-300 of these CD's
pressed and sell them for approximately $13 ppd. for people in the US and $15
to people elsewhere (the final price depends on the overall cost but these
estimated figures will be pretty close).  The reason for the small pressing is
twofold:  1) We do not know the demand and 2) We do not have the funds to
press more.  If interested in helping with distributing/funding then contact
us so we can increase our run and decrease our price.

Just so you know we are not doing this project to make a profit or exploit any
person/group--that has already been done.  The CD cost formula goes something
like this:

CD COST = AT cost CD manufacturing + misc. + postage.

For people who buy a lot (i.e. distributors) we will knock off the "misc."
charge but require you to not mark up the CD more than 10%. Remember that the
idea of this project is to create a unique product available to the masses,
not to line ANYONE'S pocket.

ORDERING

Thirteen bucks gets you get a quality CD in a jewel box with 40 minutes of
Digital Audio you can play on your regular CD player and 200 megs of demos.
Want one?  You may want to reserve a copy by contacting me (info listed above)
and providing me with a way to reach you when the CD comes out.

ANYTHING ELSE WE SHOULD KNOW

We welcome contributions/ideas on a name for this CD as well as ART for the
insert and cover (front/back)--which will most likely be two colors (four if
we get a decent picture and cheap printing quotation).

If interested you may submit a TEXT file to me about your group/demo/whatever
and I will include it on the CD.  There is no deadline for submitting demos or
TEXT but the sooner you get it to me the better--I prefer to have it by
August.

FINALLY

I do not expect to hear from everybody I send this to and will be surprised if
I heard from half the people who see this. On that note if I do not hear from
you I understand that it is okay to include your "freeware" demo production
meant for "mass distribution" on this CD I have been talking about.

Be sure your friends and other demo groups see this so it gets widely
distributed.  This CD will be a winner if we have actual contributions from
the scene--music, art, stories, comments/suggestions, etc. so be sure to
contact us.

Out there,

Dan Wright
Pallbearer/Toxic Zombies

This newsletter reaches many people. IF YOU have anything you want to
say feel free to drop me a line.  We are especially interested in upcoming
releases and demo group info.

INTERESTING TIDBIT:  Today I saw a GIRL wearing a SOUND BLASTER shirt.  
Anybody know where I can get a cool SOUND BLASTER T-shirt.  And while
your at it how about a GUS shirt--but better then the ones worn but the
Future Crew at Assembly '94.  We will gladly accept donations.  Maybe
they can become part of the prizes for the Music Contest ][.  Yea, with winners
getting a cool SB shirt and those who don't place getting a nice purple
GUS shirt.  Anyone have connections.
