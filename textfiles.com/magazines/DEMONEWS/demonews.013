BAD NEWS/GOOD NEWS
##################

I couldn't help the temptation so I've decided to include some bad news 
for this 13th DEMO.NEWS edition.  I have done my best to start and maintain
this demosite since September.  Unfortuantely I will be graduating in MAY 
pending all goes smoothly this semester.  This means I shall have to pass
the "organization" on to someone else since I will no longer have internet
access.  So, it is my hopes that someone will step forward and accept the
task of commenting, updating, organizing, and continuing the progress I
have begun.  It does require some "time" but then again, so does everything.

STATS BACK
==========

--Hamell created a program to take the WASP ftp.syslog and make a TOP
  25 DEMOS downloaded file called TOP25DL.  This will be updated WEEKLY
  when the ftp.syslog is completed early Saturday.  This way you can see
  what demos are being downloaded the most.  ONLY found on the WASP site.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
PROPOSED CHANGES
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

--As you may have noticed the "source.code" directory has been renamed to
  "source" because of a suggestion a user made.

--Some proposed changes include 2 possibilities:
  1)  Moving the TEXT files to a subdirectory.
  2)  Create subdirectories for each demo group.

  If you have any comments or suggestions on the above changes let me know.

================
CLOSING COMMENTS
================

--We have made it to the SHOW!  Both Future Crew and Twilight Zone
  have listed this internet site (ftp.uwp.edu) in their demos.

--Avoid shooting of oneself in the foot--new demostie motto.

--I added a "text" subdirectory withing the demos directory on the
  WASP site.  It has old DEMO.NEWS text files.

--Zax (of The Phoney Coders) plans on putting together a list of 
  coders and demo groups you can reach via "netmail."
