* WHATS UP! *
*-----------*

I am sure some people out there wonder what the hell is going on
with these demo sites as of late. Well, a bit of unorganization
and trying to clean up the mess is what the last few months have
been about. With luck, our three/four man crew (which is more like
one person--Mike--as of late) will have this site in order--including
the incoming directory cleaned out--by the time the PARTY'93 demos
come out.

If you have any comments/suggestions about files in the wrong place
then let us know!

WHAT WE NEED
------------

Anyone who likes to write! If you want to comment on demos and fill in
the gaps--about 1/2 the programs have not been reviewed/listed in our
extensive text files--then we need you. With four people trying to help
out it seems there are always a couple people who seem to drift off into
neverland and are seldom heard from again. So, again, all we really need
is someone who would like to comment on the demos and add to the text
file lists around this site.

******
MIRROR
******

ftp.uwp.edu will soon be mirroring this site again--now that it is more
organized. If you can not upload (put) to the /pub/incoming/demos dir
on ftp.uwp.edu then upload the file here.

SPACE
-----

We are actually running out of space on this site. Some directory may
end up getting deleted...possibly the ANSI directory. Any comments?
