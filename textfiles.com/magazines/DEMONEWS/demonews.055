((Section 1...Standard Info))
==============================================================================
    DemoNews is a weekly publication dedicated to the demo scene.  It is
produced at the Internet FTP site ftp.eng.ufl.edu (aka WASP or HORNET).  
This newsletter focuses on all aspects of demos and demo-making  (including 
music, art, and coding).

There are currently three active demo-operators at this site:
     
     Dan Wright (Pallbearer) - dmw@eng.ufl.edu
     Christopher G. Mann (Snowman) - r3cgm@dax.cc.uakron.edu
     Mike - weis@elf.stuba.sk

    This site is mirrored by the following ftps:
         ftp.uwp.edu
         ftp.luth.se
         ftp.sun.ac.za
         ftp.uni-erlangen.de
         ftp.uni-paderborn.de

If you would like to receive a new copy of Demo News every Sunday in your
mailbox write to dmw@eng.ufl.edu.  We delete all bounced mail from this
service, so if you SHOULD BE getting Demo News and ARE NOT, please re-request
this newsletter.

==============================================================================
((Section 2...General))
==============================================================================

If you are interested in reviewing demos please WRITE me.  We have two 
people doing some reviews now.  Directoies A-H will be updated with what
was in the /alpha/NEW directory shortly.

Also, please do not create your own directories within the incoming directory.
We sometimes have problems with deleting directories.

UNITY is a world wide demo competition.  Get the info files inside the
/incoming/UNITY directory to find out how you can compete.

IIC is happening this weekend.  Maybe we will see some interesting intros
coming out of Italy in the next few days.

A few ANSI files were uploaded CORRUPT.  If you want others to see it try
uploading again.  Someone also mentioned that DAMN0894.ZIP contained a
file "damnview.exe" which was infected with a VIRUS.  I scaned it with
F-PROT and SCAN but did not find a thing.  We may delete the suspious file.

Some older demos were uploaded by Daredevil (thanks) to the /democd directory
this week.  They will be moved to the alpha/NEW directory but not mentioned
in the "files" section.  One quite funny demo I noticed (tphdemo.zip) is
about Leisure suit larry shooting James Brown.

SOON to be RELEASED:

Echoes of the Past won the BIZARRE demo comp earlier this year but has
yet to be released.  Here is some info I was told about the demo:

 - It's about 1.3 meg uncompressed.
 - It needs a 386 for best result.
 - Only music for Gravis owners.
 - Music (which was made by me) consists out of 3 tunes (of which two glued to
   one piece and one tune for the end part. 
   Two tunes use 15 channels.  
 - The main part of the demo is a very fast wolfenstein-like 3d vector world 
   with texture-mapped floors and ceilings. 
 - The run-length is about 10 minutes. 
 - It's our first production.
 - We don't have a graphics artist, so don't expect great graphics! :)

 GENERAL
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Nothing too unusual this week.  I finally deleted and backed up the
remainder of the Composers Competition and Music Contest 1 entries.  This is
to make room for all of the Assembly 94 stuff that should come pouring in next
weekend.  There were over 20 megs of files that I had to download today!  This
week, my work has gone into the Assembly 94 article, so this section will be a
bit short this week. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 DID YOU KNOW?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        In the United States, a trend has started recently.  I am not sure
how to inturpret it yet.  In the past 2 months, the following BBS's have gone
down:
    Digital Oxygene
    End of Time
    Programmers Oasis
    Sound Barrier
        I am not sure, but this may signify evolution in the demo community.
With the advent of cheap access to Internet, it seems that activity has been
shifted to this medium of communication.  This would be no surprise, as
Internet allows easy access to files and mail.  If you have any thoughts on
the matter, please write me.

 ASSEMBLY 94' RULES ANALYSIS BY SNOWMAN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  (the following is taken from ASM-94_2.TXT found in the second ASM94 intro)

>> Hello, this is Snowman.  There are a few things about ASM94 rules that I'd
>> like to highlight this week.  You may have already read these, but here are
>> my thoughts on them.  You can get a copy of these rules in Future Crew's
>> second ASM94 intro.  I am not going to ASM94 (financial reasons), but I
>> envy any of you who are.

        Assembly '94 will be held in the main Ice Hockey Hall in Helsinki,
  Finland. The party will start at 9:00am on the 5th of August (Friday) and
  end at around 12:00pm on the 7th of August (Sunday).

> Hmm, 9AM?  Looks like not too many people will be waiting outside to get in
> at the opening.  ;)

        The organizers reserve the right to make any changes to the
  competition rules, and to disqualify any entry if it is not suitable to
  attend the competitions for some reason.

> I fully support this.  From personal experience, I know that when hosting
> something with entries, you can NOT plan for all contingencies, and this
> gives the organizers of ASM94 the ability to disqualify someone if their
> entry is improper in some way.

        In the graphics competition and also in the 4kb intro competition
  on PC, the competition version of the entry must not display the author's
  name or group in any way.  This is to prevent the author's name from
  affecting the vote...In the music competitions, we will not show the
  author's name while we play the song in the competition.

> Another good idea.  I think that if people saw the name "Purple Motion",
> "Skaven", or the like, it would almost gaurentee them Top 10.  This elimin-
> ates bias for the author of the song, and gives a chance for unrecognized
> people to do well.  Does this mean that the author's name can't be in the
> song text too?

        All intros (4kb, 40kb and 64kb), pictures, songs and Amiga demos
  will be distributed at the party place after the competitions.

> YIPPIE!  This makes me very happy.  I won't have to wait months just to get
> the party songs and art. 

  In the demo competition we will give exactly ONE MONTH of time for
  the demo groups to finish and release their demos, otherwise we will
  release the competition version of the demo.

> Well, I guess I can wait a month for the demos.  Better than the months it
> took some groups to get demos out last year.

  Note that you can now enter more than one demo or 64kb intro to the
  competitions, if you so desire.

> This might make things more difficult.  I don't know, I still think you
> should only be allowed to enter one.  This leaves the door open for a coder
> to release his best 5 intros in the hopes that one of them will win.

  After a lot of discussion, we have deciced to merge the PC and Amiga
  graphics competitions together. This way also the prizes will be fair...  
  Since there is no real reason to have separate Amiga and PC music
  competitions, we decided to just have a 4 channel music competition and a
  multi-channel music competition.

> This is a BIG change, but with the easy portability of art from platform to
> platform, a sensible one.  Also, some music is portable (though not as much
> as I would like) so this is cool.  I anticipate ONE music competition next
> year (no 4channel and multi-channel seperation).

  Scanned, ripped and raytraced pictures will be disqualified.

> Well, I agree with the scanned and ripped part, but I'd like to see a
> seperate competition for raytraced pictures.  I'm trying to get into ray-
> tracing myself, and I think its a pretty cool mathematical/graphical form
> of creativity.

  You will have to submit three earlier versions of your picture each from a
  different phase of the drawing process (from almost the beginning, from the
  middle and then almost when the picture was finished, and ofcoz the final
  picture itself.

> Hmmm.. A good practice, but this rule was announced only 2 months before
> the competition.  What if I had finished the picture already and didn't
> keep around old versions of the picture?

  We will use a disk voting system. Once you enter the party place, you
  will be given the voting disk, which will include the voting program.
  We are going to have separate Amiga and PC compatible voting disks.

> Another good idea.  These would make great souvenier items, but I suppose
> that they'll be kept by the organizers.  (mabey they could sell them later)

  The competition machine we will use - i486DX2/66 with 4 MB of RAM

> Last year it was only a 486/33.  I guess next year will probably be a
> Pentium 60 or 90 (not a joke).

  COMMODORE 64 COMPETITIONS...

> This game has taken the world by storm.  ASM94 is the perfect environment to
> have a competition.  Though I'd hate to be the parents of the kids who are
> spending all of their time practicing. ;)

  SPECIAL COMPETITIONS...disk-throwing, modem-throwing...

> :) This is a really cool idea.  I wonder if our ancestors ever imagined
> such an event.

  All stuff released during the party are also found in FTP server
  "nic.funet.fi" and those will be uploaded there as soon as possible.

> Looks like I'll be doing a lot of transfers from nic.funet.fi to eng.ufl.edu

  All the participating pieces of art from the competitions will be assembled
  to a single ASSEMBLY '94 CD-ROM.

> These would make wonderful x-mas gifts for your parents (and you may even

  Assembly '94, the MOVIE...In the length of 30 minutes, the video "movie"
  will show the party place, the most important events (including all
  competitions), interviews of famous scene people, etc.
                                                        
> This might be going a little far, but I'm game.  Save me a copy.

  To all girls: sorry, but we can't let you in for free after all.  If we
  would, it would only create problems (= coders and other kinky dudes trying
  to get in as girls <grin>).

> Awww...  I'd love to see Psi/FC dressed up as a woman to get in free.  ;)

  If you are arranging a BUSTRIP to our party, please, contact us for details
  on entrance fee discounts, etc.
 
> As I said earlier, I tried to organize a bus trip from the USA to Finland,
> but there wasn't enough interest...

  Around 20000 watts of music power, 4 big screens (4-5 meters wide), space 
  for sleeping (not too quiet) + showers, 24H food service (yes, we have
  Coke!!), cool raytrace movies will be shown on the big screen, Ultra Cool 
  Party T-Shirts ($15 US) and posters (A1 size).

More ASM '94 stuff

INTRO:

We, the -Elastik-, will release our first intro there.
It won't be in the competitions due to the lack of proper
class, but released anyway.

The intro's name is Impressions. (Oh well, I'll ask the coder.
He might have changed the name...) Why can't it participate
in Asm'94 compos? It's big, a lot more than 64k, but it
has few, if any, demo effects and so. Main thing is the
music and the impression. :-)

We'll also release the MusicHARDdisk. What's that?
A musicdisk so big it resembles a hard disk. :-)

From peersber@kulak.ac.be Fri Jul 29 18:58:47 1994

Ok :  I'm Bert Peers, alias Pointer, from the Belgian group
Digital House.  We exist for a year and a half, and we plan to release
our fourth demo ever at Asm94.  It's quite a good demo with excellent
gfx, but I think it's too small to make it to the top.  We'll be 
delighted if we make it to the big screen:).  It will be called
'The Attic' and it features 4 routines or so, from which at least
one is totally NEW (as far as I know, I never saw any amiga demo).
Coding is by me, Graphics by MeAgain, music by The Freak and, eh...,
'Design' by me too.

SIGGRAPH:

I was luckly enough to get one day off to vist SIGGRAPH this past week after
hearing it was "definitly" worth the vist from various people.  The total 
drive (7 1/2 hours round trip) lasted longer then me at the conference which
was in ORLANDO.  For those who do not know SIGGRAPH is a [more or less]
computer GRAPHICS gathering.  There was tons of Virtual Reality, SGI machines,
animated movies, and video games.  DOOM was being played on SGI workstations!
Some of the more interesting aspects of the show were the COMPUTER ANIMATION
(maybe we could call some of these FUTURE CREW demos times ten) going on
throughout the convention center and in a small theater.  If you liked those
computer animation movies or stuff like "The Minds Eye" then this show would
have blown your socks off.  Simply amazing. 

Got anything to say about demos?  Let us know.
