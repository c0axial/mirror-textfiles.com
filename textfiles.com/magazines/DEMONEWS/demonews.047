GENERAL STUFF
*************

WASP is now using wuarchives "ftpd" so we can display ".messages" within
each directory.  Most of you probably noticed that this week.

This newsletter reaches over 250 people. IF YOU have anything you want to
say feel free to drop me a line.  However, try to keep it demo related.
We would especially like to know when "demos/intros" are going to be 
released.  I like HYPE.  Rumors are okay as well but we don't want to
sink too low.

AS USUAL:

The TOP25DL does not work properly.  Until the "ftp.syslog" is enabled
(I am working on it) it will still keep sending you old stats.

        Well, 'its summertime, summertime, sum-sum-summertime' (what
creative lyrics to songs they used to come up with) and little Snow
dudes find it increasingly difficult to stay indoors.  Despite a bit
of melting, my white color is slowly turning to a nice healthy copper
tone.  My message for this week is: put down your copy of Scream
Tracker 3.0, wipe the cheese out of the corners of your eyes, put on
some shorts, and go shoot some hoops with the dudes down the street.
The weather has been beautiful in Ohio lately, and I'm trying to take
advantage of it.
        I had a rather interesting week these past 7 days.  I was able
to re-start up relations with someone who I had been at odds with for
a LOOOONG time.  I'm glad we're now on speaking terms, and thanks for
uploading the Crystal Dreams mods dude!  :)  Times change.
        We had a lot of cool uploads this week!  There were a few mods
uploaded by a dude from the Atari scene.  Two new monthly music disks
have hit the scene.  VangeliSteam/Iguana released a new version of their
source code for music drivers (or mabey its the old one, I havn't
checked yet), and a wierd Lava Lamp program was uploaded.  It seems that
the MAJORITY of new songs uploaded are in S3M format.  Its very uncommon
anymore to see a standard 4-channel MOD come from the PC scene.
        All Music Contest ][ files are mirrored in the directories:
/pub/msdos/demos/incoming/mc2 and /pub/msdos/demos/music/MC2.  When we
start getting some entries, the incoming directory will only contain the
most recent songs.  Not much new is happening with Music Contest ][.  In
the next day, I will release MC2UPD1.ZIP which has updated information
on different things.  I would have uploaded it earlier (like on the 1st
when I was supposed to) but my server is spitting CRC errors back at me
like crazy (both upload and download).  Because of this, not only do I
have to upload stuff to a friend in Texas and have him uuencode it to me
if I want to send it to someone, but I can't download any new files
without driving to the university.  :(
        This better change soon, or Snowman 'll be rolling some heads
down at the computer center.  :)
