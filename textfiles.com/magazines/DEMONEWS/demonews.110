=-------------------------------------------------[Bitmap Resampling]--[JsNO]-=

 _____Preface

 Just recently, I've wanted to resample some large 256 color indexed images
 to be used in my oz96 entry.  Normally I use Animator Pro 1.3a to do this,
 but Animator will not accept bitmap images greater than the actual display
 area (namely 640x480, 800x600 and 1024x768).

 So there was a problem for me... I had to resample these images, but didn't
 have the software available.  I looked around the net for a day or so
 before I decided to write my own.  I've used no formal method to make this
 as I didn't know of any when writing it (until Trixter pointed this out to
 me afterwards).  So this is the "nunny method" I guess.

 For the purposes of this program/article, "resampling" means reducing the
 actual colors present in a given bitmap.  You can do lots of other stuff
 with these algorithms I have provided, like changing the RGB ratio or
 changing the intensity etc... but i won't be covering that here.

 _____Introduction

 The problem any demo coder faces when making a demo is that the 256 colour
 boundary is never enough.  Your graphics artist, or your scanner may
 produce a set of pictures that you would want displayed on the screen at
 any one time, but can't due to this "256 boundary".

 Bitmap A will total 200 colors, bitmap B will total 80 colors and bitmap
 C may contain 100 colors... so how can we make it possible for all these
 bitmaps to be displayed at once?. - Simple, we shrink the colors for each
 bitmap, and the program I have written goes about it in the following way
 (refer to my PRESAMP.ASM program, found at ftp.cdrom.com under
 /demos/incoming/code/presamp.zip):

 1. The palette RGB values are first copied to what I call a the "palette
    statistic table."  Each R G B colour is "resampled."

    R resampled value = (R * factor) > 8
    G resampled value = (G * factor) > 8
    B resampled value = (B * factor) > 8

    You will see later why we do this.

 2. The computer adds up the frequencies of each RGB index (i.e. how many
    times they occur in the bitmap) in the palette stat table.

 3. This stat table is then sorted in descending order (i.e. in an order of
    most occurring to least occurring).  It uses the above frequencies as a
    basis for sorting.

 4. Now we go through the palette statistic table and try to reduce the RGB
    values, as the above RGB values have been resampled (i.e. reduced).  We
    will have a lot of indexes that will be of the same RGB value.  We then
    simply go through and kill identical RGB values so that we have only
    unique RGB values in our table.

    The color will start from the top of the list and compare "the most used
    indices" with the least used indices.  The most used colors are the
    colors we want to actually have "left over".  This is because a user
    will see these given color values on the screen the most.

    If one, two, or more of the same RGB value are found, the algorithm will
    trade the most popular or for the least popular, so that only the most
    popular have been substituted.  When each unique colour is reduced or a
    single/unique value is found, it is stored to a new palette statistic
    table.  We then link the index values of these two tables so we know how
    to translate the new index for each pixel.

    BTW: Sorry if I'm not explaining this very well.. I'm not a very good
    columnist.  :)

 5. Once we have reduced (simplified - a better word) our statistic palette,
    we can now begin to "translate" the actual bitmap values from our old
    palette statistic table and newly compiled palette statistic table.

    The computer will go through each pixel, and translate its index value
    and respective RGB value according to the old palette.  This value is
    then resampled...

    R resampled value = (R * factor) > 8
    G resampled value = (G * factor) > 8
    B resampled value = (B * factor) > 8

    ...and compared with the resampled values in our palette statistic
    table.  Once a match is found, we can now translate the palette index
    value found in the old palette statistic table to a palette index value
    found in our new palette statistic table.

    The RGB colour value found in this entry is the color that will be used,
    and the position index of this entry within the table is the translated
    pixel value of our new pixel.  We do this for every pixel until the
    entire bitmap has been converted.

    I didn't explain that very well did I?  Here is a better way of
    explaining it, with an extract of my code:

      mov    ah,[edi+tpal_stat_table.index_pal]
      mov    edi,offset new_pal_stat_table
      xor    dl,dl
    @@f_match_newrbg:
      cmp    ah,[edi+tpal_stat_table.index_pal]
      jne    @@f_no_newrgb
      mov    [esi],dl
      jmp    @@index_xlated
    @@f_no_newrgb:
      add    edi,size tpal_stat_table
      add    dl,1
      jnc    @@f_match_newrbg
    @@f_no_match:
      add    edi,size tpal_stat_table
      add    dh,1
      jnc    @@f_match_rgbl

 Here is an entity relationship diagram that may aid your understanding:

    `-- Old Bitmap                               Translated Bitmap --'

 The program is ready made, but if you need to modify it you will need TASM
 and DOS32V32.

 To run the program type in:

 PRESAMP -sXX -cXX <filein>.VGA <fileout>.VGA

 -sXX being a decimal number from 00 to FF.  This is the position in the
 palette table of the bitmap where you want colors to start from.

 -sXX being a decimal number from 00 to FF is the total number of colors you
 want in the resampled bitmap.

 For example:

 PRESAMP -s00 -c80 in.vga out.vga

 _____Other Issues

 You could expand this program to except a number of bitmaps at once, to
 pool all their palettes to together.  As the possible number of colors will
 increase, better quality pictures will be achieved than simply reducing
 each one separately.  This is because bitmaps will be "borrowing" colors
 from other bitmaps that fit more closely with the old bitmap color.  Also,
 you could make it "protect" certain regions of the palette, so that those
 colors will always be considered first. You can do this by forcing these
 colors to be sorted first in the palette statistic table.

 This program will consider ALL color indices whether they are used or not
 used in the source bitmap.  This means that if you ask it to reduce the
 bitmap to 50 colors and it only used 128 of these colors, the resultant
 color total will be less than 50.  Although it is poor coding on my part,
 it greatly simplifies things.. it's ok for what I want it to do anyway.  :)

 Hand on, now I come to think of it, an easy way to get around this is to
 simply extrapolate the target colors with the number of actual colors:

 target_colors       modified_target_colors
 ----------------- = -----------------------
 no_source_colors    256

 You can modify the RGB ratio of the bitmaps by playing around with the
 resample code:

 R resampled value = (R * factor) > 8
 G resampled value = (G * factor) > 8
 B resampled value = (B * factor) > 8

 Hence you can make am image a little bit more red, or a little bit more
 green etc. NB/ Only bias the values either at palette statistic
 construction or the translation stage only..not both.  If you do, it won't
 have any effect.

 _____Conclusion

 Lastly, this program is a hack (ie - rough as guts).  Therefore, once it
 worked, I stopped coding.  Improvements in speed can be made in the
 translation process by changing all the exhaustive searches to binary
 searches etc.  This would greatly improve speed.

 See ya.

=--------------------------------[VGA Hardware Tricks, Part 2.5/6]--[Trixter]-=

 _____Preface

 Welcome to VGA Hardware Tricks, a six-part series written by
 Trixter/Hornet.  In this special insert into the series (contributed by
 Trouls of TnT), we'll take one last look at crossfading; this time, with
 128-color pictures.  (Next week we'll resume our original schedule.)

 _____Introduction

 By now you're probably wondering where the multi-color techniques that I
 wrote about last time are.  Well, Trouls of TnT (alias Alex Wenger) wrote
 me right after I did my article on crossfading 16 and 256-color pictures
 and pointed out something that I forgot to describe: Crossfading 128-color
 pictures.  He even went so far as to write source code and a small article,
 so I'm pleased to reprint that information here.

 Crossfading 128-color pictures is extremely simple.  Since the total number
 of combined colors is 256, we can effectively plot both pictures to the
 screen, make one picture's palette all black, and then fade that palette
 from black to colors as we fade the other to black. Simple, eh?

 _____Overview

 How you decide to *arrange* all those pixels, however, is a different
 story.  Alex writes of two possible solutions:

 1. Set the video mode to 320x400.

 2. Load the first picture, put the 1st line of image data in the 1st line
    of VGA memory, the 2nd image line in the 3th VGA line, and the 3th line
    in the 5th line and so on (hence putting each line of picture data on
    every _other_ line of VGA memory).

 Like this:

   Picture1:      VGA-Ram:         Picture2:

   xxxxxx ------> xxxxxx      ____ yyyyyy

 3. Load the second picture in the lines that are still free.  Convert the
    colors that picture 1 uses pallette entries 0-127, and the colors
    that picture 2 uses to entries 128-255.

 4. Prepare the palette for picture 1 by setting colors 128-255 black.

 5. Fade the pallette from picture 1's pallette to picture 2's pallette.

 If you want to, you can try this pattern:

   VGA-Ram:

   xyxyxyxy
   yxyxyxyx
   xyxyxyxy
   yxyxyxyx

 It's simple to program.  It's also possible to reserve a few palette
 entries for a logo or something.

 _____Code

 Code that achieves this effect is available on ftp.cdrom.com in the
 directory /pub/demos/hornet/demonews/vgahard in the file vgahar25.zip.  To
 compile the code directly, you'll need Turbo Pascal 7.0 or later.  The code
 can be compiled on earlier compilers as well, but some slight modification
 might be necessary.

 _____Notes

 This technique has been used extensively before; most recently, in the end
 credits part of Orange's X14 demo.  They used the pixel-interleaving to
 overlay text on a twisting column; it's the same idea.

 Alex also wrote of one other thing, and while it's not a VGA hardware
 effect, it's something that beginners might not have thought of:  Pixel
 crossfading.  In this technique, all you have to do is make sure both
 pictures have the same palette, no matter how many colors; then,
 *gradually* overwrite the onscreen's picture with the other picture's
 pixels.

 - Change every 7 (or whatever you want) pixels until the whole picture
   is done and you have a nice crossfading effect.

 - Change the pixels along lines or change whole blocks of pixels for a
   slide show effect.

 _____Conclusion

 With the addition of this special "insert" in this series, I'm pretty sure
 we've exhausted crossfading.  :-)  Next week, we'll be delving into fun
 stuff: How to make your standard VGA card display more than 256 colors at
 once.  Have fun until then!
