INCOMING
========

-TSCI     = The Square (new group) enters the demo scene with this ok "intro"
-ACEDEMO  = Graphic picture rotating in and around with .VOC music. Par.

=============
NEW DIRECTORY
=============

The new directory is called "source.code" and it will hold soure code to
demos and routines that people contribute.  I also expect it to house
various utilities to help a coder do a demo--assembler, font editors, music
editors, and any other useful item.  Like this demo site, contributions will
make or break this directory.

======================
WHAT ABOUT OTHER DEMOS
======================

Where are all the new demos?  If not new demos then what about old demos?
Anybody out there local to the MUSIC CONNECTION or the MUSIC CHANNEL BBS?

Be sure to UPLOAD new demos to the /pub/incoming/demos DIRECTORY.
Please try to include a short text file on what it is.
(Remember that files in the incoming directory usually have yet to be scanned
so be careful.)

=====================
IMPORTANT INFORMATION
=====================

1) The RATING system has a GOOD chance of being OVERHAULED.  See the 
   ABOUT.DEMOS file for more information on what the new system will
   probably be like.  Send feedback if you WANT a new system.  Thus far
   I have heard from three or four people.

2) The demos will continue to be compressed with .LZH using LHA213.EXE

3) Anyone who would like to join/create a demo group but do not know where
   to go let me know and I will attempt to put you in contact with others
   wishing to do the same.

4) Is there any chance of someone out there attempting to get a DEMO
   NEWSGROUP on the NEWSREADER?  How about trying?  They have an amiga demo
   group, what about an IBM/PC demo group on the newsreader.  I have a whole
   article on how to GET a NEWSGROUP on the NEWSREADER.  Anyone got the time?
 
=============
ANSI TACK-ONS
=============

Silence is deadly!  Silence is worse than a NO.  Is there anyone out there
willing to make a ANSI tack ON?  "Death comes silently" you know. :^)
