GENERAL STUFF
*************

Hey, how come no one has been uploading those BIZARRE '94 party demos,
intros and stuff?

We are back up over 100 megs again (of free space) with nothing missing
in the /demos directory.  

The ANSI directory is growing by leaps and BOUNDS.  Soon (month or two)
we WILL have to delete some of the older stuff.  I searched ARCHIE for
an ANSI ftp site but could not find any.  Does anyone know if there is
such a site?  

The TOP25DL may not work properly this week--it used the previous weeks
ftp.syslog to compute the stats and will probably do the same this week.
As soon as I "find" where the ftp.syslog files are kept I will correct the
mistake.

Does anyone know if there is going to be a big TCC party this year in
Sweden?  I recall rumors/postings of it being canceled and have not seen
any intro as of late.  Please send info my way and I will let everyone
else know what is going on.

MAIL LIST

Hi there,

I am like many people who follow the demo scene. I always like to get new 
demos, music etc., but often dont have the time to continually wade through 
newsgroups and ftp sites in an attempt to find new items.

In comes demuan - The Demo and Music Announce Mailing List. I hope for this 
to become a list where new releases of the following items are posted:

	- Demos
	- Demo Results
	- Party Details
	- Soundcards
	- Music Players
	- Music Disks
	- Other information deemed suitable by the moderator (aka me :))

Think of it, if you like, as a comp.sys.ibm.pc.demos.announce and 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.soundcard.announce rolled into one. 

I do *not* want it to become a list that floods your mailbox with chat, or 
irrelevant information, but a place where demo groups and music player 
coders can post new release details. For this reason, I do not want new mods 
to be posted to this list, unless they are subject to a demo party, 
but music-disks are welcome to be posted.

* HOW TO SUBSCRIBE *
Simple. Send mail to "listserver@oliver.sun.ac.za" with a message body of
"subscribe demuan-list Your Name", Your Name being you *name* not email 
address. For example, mine would be 'Kim Davies'. You will receive a 
confirmation or error message after this procedure.

* HOW TO POST *
To send an announcement to the list, post to "demuan-list@oliver.sun.ac.za" 
with your announcement. Alternately, if that fails, post to 
"kimba@it.com.au". The announcement will be posted ASAP to the list if it 
fills the criteria.

I am hoping the mailing list to become immensely popular so subscribe :-) 
Please note, this is *NOT* a binaries list, ftp sites will be given on most 
cases when applicable as to where to obtain the release. 

Happy Demoing, Coding, Music Playing etc.,

MUSIC CONTEST ][
****************

     Music Contest ][.  Its here, and its alive!  If you haven't
already seen it on your local BBS or FTP, be sure and pick up a copy
of MC2RULES.ZIP.
     Music Contest ][ is an international contest putting many songs in
direct competition.  The concept is simple: the song that gets the
highest votes wins.  The contest is divided into two classes, VETERAN
and ROOKIE, so that both experienced and beginning computer musician
alike can compete.  There is public voting so that the final results of
the contest will reflect the opinions of the individual musician.  The
voting system itself is very complex in order to prevent any cheating
that might occur.  All final totals will be checked and verified by
several people to insure that they are correct.  The best prize that can
be offered is the pride you feel in doing well in the contest.  However,
for those of you who would like something a little more, there will be
prizes such as a sample library, books on music theory, and trophies,
all of which will be conveniently shipped right to your home.  In
addition, several of the best songs will be put onto audio CD and sold
for about $10 each.  The theme of this contest is "efficiency."  Despite
its complexity, Music Contest II has been streamlined to provide you the
best contest possible.  Friendly competition seems to bring out the best
in everyone, and it is my personal hope that you have a lot of fun in
this contest.
     MC2RULES.ZIP is the actual heart of Music Contest ][.  In this zip
file, you will find everything you need to get you started on composing
your entry to the contest, and also the rules on how to become a MC][
voter.  This archive also contains a song by yours truly that is an
example of how entries should be named, formatted, etc.
     Both Amiga and PC platforms are encouraged to enter.  However,
there will be some restrictions on Amiga voters since they can't run the
voting software.  Despite this fact, I believe that there is enough
incentive to make Amiga entries plentiful.
     In summary, this contest promises to shape the computer music
scene, at least in some part, and I hope that you all decide to become a
part of the experience.
 
    -Snowman/Binary Puppets  (April 26th, 1994)

[The CD ROM project Snowman mentions is a little bigger then just AUDIO
music.  That SAME CD will also consist of DEMOS and MC][ related files.
I will include a text file about 100+ meg DEMO side of things in a future

 Mike
 ++++

Hello there, it is Mike here again (and several notes :))

  * BATOBA (Back to Basic) - there are several mod-files (8chn), but I didn't
    notice *any* music during the demo. Does anybody know how to activate it?
    I didn't find ANY player in unpacked files.
    Btw: Did you see the file batoba.017 - it's a windows executable (NE - new
        exe file format), but it doesn't run under Windows 3.1). A little
        question to authors: what does this file do? (or is it simply a data
        file :)))
  * JUKEBOX (old music disk) - approx a year ago my friend noticed a hidden
    file in this music-disk (there is a note about this written in my
    calculator since ages, but there has been no free time to write about it
    yet :))
    -> so, here it is: at offset 630903 in jukebox.exe, there is a uuencoded
      message, so if you know what I'm talking about - decode and read it :))
