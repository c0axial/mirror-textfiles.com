PARTY93 STUFF:
Expect it to be moved shortly.  If in doubt check the compos/party93 
directory for links to the files--hopefully this gets done. :)

MUSIC:
The music like sp_beast, night4, and others will be moved to the
/music directory--somewhere.

===========
COMPRESSION
===========

LZH is favored, then ZIP, then UNIX compress, then ARJ.  Don't even think 
about using ZOO!  We don't want to see gnuzip either.  I perfer multi-
disk stuff to be PKZIPed (& something).  Please try to keep files within
disk copiable range.

=======
FINALLY
=======

Expect everything to be fully organized soon.

We can mail you the TOP25DL every week if you wish.  We can probably also
mail a directory listing and other crap.
