 _____Introduction

 Those long-time readers of DemoNews may have noticed my introductions
 gradually shortening.  Well, not tonight.  Tonight I feel like sharing my
 honest thoughts, observations, and feelings.  Why the sudden change?   Well,
 I don't really know.  I could try to think of something important and say
 that it inspired me, but that wouldn't be quite accurate.  Let's just say
 that I've filled my personal memory cache and now it needs to flush.

 _____Assembly 1996

 A couple weeks ago I flew to Helsinki for Assembly '96.  After all the
 problems The Party Organizing had last year, I was guessing that attendance
 would be very low at TP96.  Following this logic, Assembly '96 would be
 largest scene event of the year (and it probably will be).

 I was greeted at the airport by IOR / Hornet.  He gave me a brief tour of
 Helsinki before our mutual host (Mellow-D / Hornet) arrive home from work.
 Since I got to Finland a couple of days before the party began, IOR, Mellow-D
 and I were able to spend time visiting local bars and getting drunk. :)

 Before the party began, I went to both Assembly Organizing Offices and the
 Party Place.  The offices were about as I expected; messy with lots of people
 running around making last-minute plans and confirmations.  I was impressed
 with the organizers (Pehu and Moku), for they seemed relaxed despite the
 upcoming event.  To them, Assembly was an event they were used to planning
 for.

 Jesse was my guide the whole time (he had spent about two months in Europe
 before I got there, and had also been to Assembly before).  He took me to
 Gore / Future Crew's house.  There I got to see FC's new Pyramid 3D chip and
 the two games they were working on.  I was more than a little impressed with
 everyone's skill and knowledge of their respective tools.  One friendly
 graphician was busy trying to tweak some textures... later I would find out
 that he was Marvel of Future Crew.  Other notables at Gore's house that day:
 Reward / Complex, Zodiak / Cascada, Stone / Dust.

 Throughout the party, I hung out mostly with: IOR, Mellow-D, Zodiak, Alpha /
 KLF (formerly Legend Design), Howler / Fobia Design, Screamager / Radical
 Rhythms, Likit, Axl / Daskmig, Weed / Coral, Abyss / FC, Stinger, some
 Norwegian guy whose name I can't recall, and a few whose names I flat out
 forgot. :)

 Being a veteran in the scene, I have learned the value of sleep at parties.
 :)  As with NAID, I got 7-8 hours each night and was able to enjoy the
 daytime more as a result.  Meanwhile, a group of a dozen jurors or so was
 desperately trying to screen 250 songs for the multi-channel compo.
 Fortunately, I couldn't hear them from the sleeping quarters (a huge
 auditorium nearby).

 I did get a chance to be on the demo prescreening jury.  We went through
 about 45 demos and weren't very impressed.  Our job was to select 15 demos to
 play on the big screen.  For each demo, we all went around the room and
 shouted out a score from 1-5.  Some guy wrote these all down and chose the
 top ranked ones for big-screen showing.  Other than IOR, the only other
 person I knew on the demo jury was Prism / EMF.  IOR and I both went nuts
 when Babylon wouldn't run (Babylon was the demo by Psychic Monks that they
 couldn't get linked and entered at NAID this year).  We even tried calling
 Trixter to see if he had any ideas.  As it was, having EMS loaded on the
 compo machine (which _was_ in the rules) made the demo crash.  :(

 And now a few random things I remember about the party:

   - Something happened to the lights in the mens bathroom.  For a while, you
     sort of had to wander in and piss around until you found a toilet.  :)
     That obviously must have seemed like the perfect time for someone to set
     up a strobe light and boom-boom techno music right in front of the
     restroom door.  Piss piss boom boom!  For some reason, I found this
     hilarious at the time.

   - I saw absolutely no alcohol or drugs inside the party place itself.
     Notice I say "inside".  :)

   - For the most part, Assembly ran smoothly.  I'm not going to do what
     always seems socially popular after a party (trash the organizers).
     Assembly organizing did a good job this year.  What problems occurred
     were, for the most part, minor and corrected quickly.

   - I did something I swore I'd never do at a demo party; play network games.
     It was 4:30AM Sunday and I had just woken up from an 8 hour nap.  I
     looked around for someone or something exciting to do.  Failing that, I
     sobered outside for a smoke.  There I ran into Screamager and relayed
     critical top secret demo jury information to him.  I went back inside,
     plopped myself down at Howler's table, and proceeded to kick some
     bonafied Assembly ass at Quake.  And I'll admit, there is something to be
     said for playing network Quake with scene people.  It's one thing to say
     you beat a friend or coworker, but it's quite another to gloat over
     famous coders and musicians.  :)

   - Zodiak spent a lot of time at the party trying to finish up his compo
     tune.  I got to hear it in progress and actually got the distinction of
     naming it Replicator.  I should also mention that Zodiak is one of the
     coolest dudes I met at Assembly.  An easy going yet whacky Swede with a
     knack for picking up the most inappropriate Finnish phrases ("Pee-koo kee
     kahlee!").

   - After the demos had played on the big screen, Groo and Dizzy had a live
     jam outside the party place.  That was pretty cool!

   - I just realized now that I have never seen a complete intro compo at a
     party (missed NAID '95, NAID '96, and now Assembly).

 The final results were given, the party wrapped up, the people packed up, and
 IOR and I stood in the control center with unwatched access to the vacant big
 screen and sound system.  So what did we do?  We played Babylon!  And boy did
 we play it loud.  The little techno boom-boom kiddies down below in the main
 hall keep glancing up at the screen while they tried to pack everything up.
 Even though Psychic Monks were unable to compete, I felt this public showing
 helped make up for the fate which befell the groovy little production.

 That night, we went out drinking: Jake / FC, IOR, Mellow-D, Alpha, that
 Norwegian guy, Screamager, and the Cubic Team.  I got plenty drunk and found
 out the next morning that we got home by taxi.  :)  Two days later I flew
 back home... tired but happy.

 That's my little mini-Assembly report.

 _____Music Contest IV

 For those who haven't already heard, Music Contest IV finished up this past
 week... on time!  We weren't able to get the invitation or results intros
 out, but I'll be damned if we didn't keep on schedule well this year.

 Overall, I felt that the quality of the entries was slightly below MC3.  Many
 people chose to enter the veteran division who really should have entered
 rookie.  In any case, I feel very positive about how this competition went.
 We had fewer problems and less negative feedback this year than ever before.
 Most of that is due in no small part to GD.

 Last Sunday, GD and I spent the day preparing the final results.  Starting
 with a 350k raw ASCII file full of comments and a few unformatted statistics,
 we were able to produce mc4final.zip by the end of the night.

 All of the songs entered have replaced song-text that says "This song is
 called Blah Blah by Blah Blah and entered Music Contest 4."  This was made
 possible by Phoenix's "Putinst" utility.

 The contest wrapped up without much celebration or mourning.  I am content
 with that.  The people enjoyed it and we'll do it again next year.

 _____Party at God's House

 Last Monday I went with Brian (you don't know him) and K8to to God's house
 for a small demo gathering.  About a dozen of us watched old demos for about
 an hour and played network Quake for another 6.  Such is the modern demo
 scene I guess.  I got a chance to meet and talk to Nemesis (who I used to
 email with semi-regularly about three years ago).  I'm glad to see someone on
 the USA west-coast take the initiative and organize a gathering like this.  I
 hope it encourages others to do the same.

 _____What CD?

 About a week before I left to go to Assembly, we had a big shakedown at the
 company.  Half the employees were let go (including the VP).  Frankly, the
 CDROM market just isn't what it used to be.  About a third of all projects
 in-progress were canceled, including: The NAID CD, The Music Contest 4 CD,
 and The Demos Video.  The Hornet Underground CD is also under reconsideration
 but may survive the transition.  I used to feel really depressed about all of
 this.  Now I have adopted a more care-free attitude.  Shit happens.  I deal
 with it.  It's either a sign of stupidity or maturity, I'm not quite sure
 yet.

 _____The NAID Report

 The NAID CD may be canceled, but the report is not.  Far from it.  I actually
 beta-tested it a few days ago.  Trixter's got the image engine down tight,
 and is selectively eliminating some images to make the report smaller.  He
 has working descriptions for all of the pictures which I am in the process of
 replacing.  :)

 I'd guess that we have this report (Hornet slideshow) out the door by next
 weekend.

 _____/STTiNGoming

 I am Captain Picard.  You are the borg.

 We can't keep up.  The scene has grown so big that we just can't do it
 anymore.  Once heralded as the best-organized demo resource on the 'net, the
 Hornet Archive has fallen into /incoming.  You know it and I know it.  We're
 behind with almost no hope of catching up.

 But the good news is that we've recognized the fact and are doing something
 about it.  Several proposed ideas:

   1. Deleting all files starting with "s", "t", and "r" (since those seem
      to be the three most commonly uploaded filenames).
   2. Rotating the /incoming directories.  This week have /incoming/music be
      where you put new demos and /incoming/news be where new songs go.
   3. Write a script that randomly deletes 100 files a week.  This makes it
      fair for everyone.

 But seriously... we can't even mention the _real_ ideas because they are top
 secret (i.e. might be so stupid that we get publicly embarrassed).  Rest
 assured, Hornet is talking about what we can do to save the archive.  The
 solution might not be a pretty one, but it should prove effective.

 _____Conclusion

 There.  Now _that's_ a proper introduction.  Hope you all enjoyed it.  See
 ya'll again next week!

 :: Shaithis / Psychic Monks, Immortal Coil - shaithis@dreamscape.com

 _____Introduction

 This is it, the last Dpaint article.  Are you excited?  Do you care?

 Hello...

 Ah well.  Anyway, before I go on, I have numerous corrections to make, just
 so I can illustrate my degree of ignorance when it comes to actual numbers,
 statistics, etc... (I just use the damn programs, I don't know how they work
 :)

   1. Because Dpaint is only a 6-bit program, this means that my stating that
      you could achieve 256 shades of grey for the palette is incorrect.  The
      most you can achieve is 64 shades.  Therefore, you can get full
      greyscale shading depth, and still have room for color too.  Whee.  The
      following people caught me on that one: Jim Paris and Joe Lee

   2. Before I could even send out my letter of query to EA about the status
      of Dpaint, I received words of reply from Robin Greene, Technical
      specialist at Electronic Arts UK.  The good news is, game companies are
      indeed reading DemoNews.  The bad news, DP is long since obsolete.  The
      best I can do for you folks is to tell you to look into old software
      warehouses and the like.

   3. I just want to extend my thanks to those of you who are writing in,
      either to tell me what you like, what you don't like, or what I screwed
      up. :)  Let me assuage some common fears.  I am not going to talk about
      Dpaint solely.  My next section is going to deal with a bunch of 32-bit
      apps like photoshop and FDP.  I've had enough requests to convince me
      that I should compile these four articles into one large text (perhaps
      with some additions), and make it available.  Look for more info on
      that.

 On with the show.

 In this article, I have about fifty lines to tell you about the billions of
 other commands that Dpaint employs.  Clearly, that isn't possible, so I'm
 going to concentrate on three main ones: Smooth, Transparent, and Shade.

 _____Palette Trick

 Before I go into them, however, let me finally tell you about my little trick
 with the palette for ensuring good effects on the above commands.  First,
 black out the entire palette except for the first and last boxes (otherwise
 you can't see your screen).  Next, create whatever gradients you're going to
 need.  After that, copy the gradients but darken them down a shade (just
 re-adjust the first and last color of the gradient, and re-spread them).

 Now you have a dark and light set of gradients.  When you use the afore-
 mentioned commands, they'll work much better.  Some tweaking of this trick
 may be necessary in order to achieve optimum results.  Now, on to the
 commands.

 _____Smooth

 The smooth command allows you to designate an area of your picture and move
 all of the colors closer in hue, saturation, and intensity to each other.
 This has the effect of blurring them slightly.  _This_ is the command you
 should use to anti-alias your work, rather than the anti-alias command.  It
 works much better.  I generally use the line brush, and run it around any
 edges that seem to need anti-aliasing.

 _____Transparent

 This command allows you to create transparency effects with varying degrees
 of efficiency.  I generally use it to create 3-d effects.  By picking up a
 section of your artwork (say the letter 'm'), and turning on transparency,
 you can then click once and have part of your background show up through the
 M.  I usually use this over black backgrounds to create font effects.  You
 can put down a transparent M, and then an opaque M over it (slightly moved)
 to achieve the look of a 3-d, shaded letter.  To get a better idea, look at
 the ending screen to the MC4 results intro.

 _____Shade

 This command will, in essence, shade your drawing.  It will darken whatever
 pixels you run your brush over.  This has some interesting uses, but one
 little trick (my personal favorite Dpaint trick) stands out from the rest.

 Create yourself a gradient.  Now, select the first color of that gradient and
 fill your entire screen with it.  Next, select the gradient itself as your
 color, and select Shade.  Pick the spray-paint option, and adjust the brush
 and spray size to your liking.  Give it a shot.  This is an excellent way to
 create textures ranging from dirt, to marble, to lightning.

 Note: This trick was not originally discovered by myself, nor even the person
 who initially taught it to me, Rhythm Greene.  It's been used by many artists
 over the course of the past ten years or so.

 _____Conclusion

 That brings me to the end of this column, the end of the Dpaint series, and
 the end of my line limit. :)  I'm moving to buffalo next week, so I'll have a
 new email address then.  I'll be sure to post it in my next article.  Until
 then, catcha.

 :: "Top 10 Reasons HA4 is better than ID4 (Independence Day)"
 :: Dennisc - dennisc@community.net

 10. Jeff Goldblum may be able to act in sci-fi movies, but does HE support
     regular expressions?

 9.  Cost to see ID4: anywhere from free (if you aren't caught) to around $6,
     or about $3 an hour.  Cost to see HA4: anywhere from free to perhaps
     maybe $20/month for inet access, working out to anywhere from free to
     .278 cents per hour.  It doesn't take Alan Greenspan to figure this one
     out: if HA4 was the blockbuster of the summer and had an ad campaign
     behind IT, the savings on the opening weekend alone would pull the entire
     world out of debt, forever.

 8.  ID4 may have aliens, but HA4 can serve up second reality-exploding
     starships and little green men.  Ain't no sci-fi bullshit that NASA comes
     up with about dead organic compounds on Mars that can compare with that
     sweet action, baby.

 7.  HA4 doesn't have that annoying leading guy, what's his name, the fresh
     prince or whatever, I mean, wasn't he a rapper or something?  I can't
     even begin to say how wrong that is.

 6.  Though the special effects budget for ID4 ran into the millions, not a
     SINGLE toneball can be sighted in the final release version.

 5.  The ID4 computers were 100% macintosh.  HA4 can be accessed by the lowly
     TRS-80 with appropriate (albeit nonexistent) software.

 4.  Let's compare site activity statistics.  Wait, let's not, comparing
     www.id4.com to ftp.cdrom.com is like pitting the african pygmies utilized
     in the first "deep forest" album against the Dream Team for a friendly
     game of "hoops" as they call it in the b-ball "biz."

 3.  With ID4, you've got to put up with whatever musical score they put with
     the film originally.  With HA4 you can play any music in the background--
     including John Tesh, especially that one, you know, the one he did that
     was inspired by the barcelona olympic games?

 2.  HA4 is by *FAR* more underground.  I mean any idiot can go "hey d00dz did
     u catch that id4 flick?" but if you show up at a party and suave your way
     around dropping "HA4" everywhere, people think you've got elite
     connections, possibly in foreign resistance movements or the department
     of motor vehicles.  The eliteness of the somewhat unknown acronym is
     limited only by the imagination of the people you tell it to.

 1.  HA4 is run by HORNET!

 Smooch!

 :: "Advertisement - The Dreams CDROM"
 :: Darkness / Imphobia - darkness@genesis.be

 _____Introduction

 Dreams is a so-called "Scene" CD-ROM.  It has been a project we wanted to
 work on for quite a time but never ended doing it until now.  Some other
 scene CDs have been produced before but they mainly were party CDs or CDs
 which contained the very latest stuff only.  We wanted to do something
 different, something that had not been done before and which (in our opinion)
 had to be done.

 Dreams is the result of about seven months of hard work, from collecting all
 the needed materials to contacting sceners in order to have the greatest
 collection of productions on the CD.

 Dreams is not another of those high profit CDs.  "Dreams" is not the
 beginning of a collection of several scene CDs and moreover it is unlikely
 that we will produce such CDs in the future.  Our ambitions were to make a
 high quality CD made for the scene and by the scene available at a low price.

 _____The Contents

 Dreams isn't a party CD or a CD containing all the new stuff released within
 the last few months.  Dreams is what we like to call a real "scene CD" which
 means it contains all the best stuff released in the scene until now,
 regardless of when the productions were actually released or at which party
 they have been presented.  The selection of the productions which have been
 included on Dreams has been mainly based on the _complete_ charts of the
 latest Imphobia diskmags (which can be considered the most accurate charts in
 the PC scene).

 The CD contains about 640 megs of data, including:

   - The ~100 best ever released demos.

   - The ~100 best ever released intros.

   - The largest collection ever of _all_ the best hand-draw graphics of all
     the best graphic artists on PC and Amiga, classified by author/theme.
     (about 2000 selected high quality pictures, some never released before!)

   - A collection of Slideshows.

   - A complete collection of all the tunes from all the 24 best charted
     musicians.

   - The 30 best ever released musicdisks.

   - A great collection of chiptunes.

   - A collection of all the best diskmagazines (including all issues of
     Imphobia)

   - A collection of the greatest scene reports.

 One can say that Dreams is the ultimate collection of all the best stuff
 released on the scene to date (end July 96).

 All the productions are unpacked and can be, for the most part, run directly
 off the CD (when the production needs to write a config on the disk, the most
 common config has then been chosen).

 The CD comes in a jewel case with a high quality color insert, back cover,
 and art on the CD, all designed by PL / Imphobia.

 :: "The Dreams CDROM Review"
 :: Dan Wright - dmw@gate.net

 Dreams is not your ordinary demo CD with lots of various quality packed
 files; Dreams is a "best of" compilation with most files in their unpacked
 (or unzipped) form.  This "best of" makes the Dreams CD perfect for showing
 your friends/family/workers excellent productions-from intros to art to music
 and beyond-directly off the CD-ROM drive.

 The Dream CD art and design was done by the in house Imphobia artist PL.  You
 will find lots of bluish/purple art with a burning face for cover art.
 Perhaps to give the impression of the "mind burning" experience you are about
 to partake.  The inside CD booklet has a blue steel look to it with a minimal
 amount of text.  The minimal graphics are excellent but a little dark in
 color.

 My scan of the CD turned up around 88 intros, 90 demos, 100+ megs of amazing
 graphics by many top scene artist, 66 megs of diskmags with WorldCharts
 missing, party results (text), party reports including several really good
 "video" reports of Wired from Subnormals, music by the 24 best charted
 musicians, chiptunes, and musicdisks.  All of this with some stuff as recent
 as July of 1996.

 To create the "best of" Darkness used the Imphobia charts to determine what
 to include on the CD.  There were some intros-like pisstro and soppa-and
 demos-like some by LIVE!--I felt didn't belong in the "best of" category.  I,
 like many will, feel there are some great productions like Crystal Dreams and
 Amnesia missing from the +/-100 "all time best."

 The most impressive part of Dreams is probably the Graphics included.  This
 is broken down into artist (100+), theme, and slide show (hitting J F will
 get you the game in the HIDDEN TALENT slide show).  It is indeed a very
 impressive collection.

 I tested several files and was able to get a majority of the productions to
 run directly off the CD while using QEMM.  I occasionally had to reboot
 without a memory manager and more often then not the demo/intro would then
 run or tell me I did not have enough free memory.

 Sure, you could have all these greats taking up valuable hard drive space, a
 couple $15 ZIP floppies, or you could buy the CD for $12-$13 (US).  Do the
 right thing and support the scene especially if you enjoy demos. Darkness
 (aka Jeff) can be reached at: darkness@genesis.be.

 Simply an opinion.

                    4-CD-Rom Collection by Gryzor in May '96

 _____Introduction

 This is, as far as I know, the biggest Mods' Collection to date!  This is
 also the cheapest around!

 My only motive in doing this collection was: PASSION!

 This has led to a high-quality production made, above all, for YOU!  Not to
 make money, like it was the case too often for the previously released Mods'
 Collections.

 It is a tribute to all the composers, from the old legendary ones till the
 newest appeared in "the scene" of computer music and demos.

 I have only one thing in mind when it comes to mods: RESPECT the composers.

 That's why (to repeat some of the characteristics) I made my very best to
 contact a maximum of composers and ask for their permission to include their
 works in this collection.  It was OBLIGATORY for me!

 And I'm glad to see that so many agreed, so happy that, finally, someone
 asked them their permission before releasing their work!  Yes, many of them
 told me so.  Thanks to all of you, guys! :)

 Well, "18000+" modules... Maybe you think "Gosh!  How will I be able to
 listen to this all!?"  Hehe... Yes, you will need SOME months if you plan to
 listen to ALL the mods one after the other ;-)

 But the most important is to own this set.  Now take your time, listen
 carefully to the mods, you will discover some masterpieces!

 _____The Breakdown

 And about the total number of mods, there are exactly 18096 modules!

 Here is the repartition over the 4 CD-ROMs:

   CD #1: Mods/Authors(A-F) :  2719 modules (438MB)

   CD #2: Mods/Authors(G-Q) :  3417 modules (574MB)

   CD #3: Mods/Authors(R-Z) :  2263 modules (371MB)
          Mods/Groups       :  1458 modules (194MB)

   CD #4: Mods/Misc (Kinds) :  2857 modules (497MB)
          Mods/Synth        :  5382 modules (74MB)
                              _____

          Total             : 18096 modules (2148MB)

 _____Ready-to-Play

 As stated in the characteristics, all these mods are _uncompressed_.  This is
 why they take more than 2 Gigabytes of disk-space.  But this choice allows
 you to listen to the mods with nearly all kinds of computers, and accessing
 to the mods will also be faster; no need to depack any file.

 Indeed, talking about the 'multi-platform' aspect of the collection, it is of
 course readable on Amiga (I'm an Amiga user! :) but it's also readable under
 MS-DOS, Windows, OS/2, Unix, Mac-OS, etc...

 BUT! - Important "but!" - It was out of question for me to truncate all the
 filenames to this archaic "8+3" limitation!  Absolutely not... But don't
 worry, MS-DOS users, your DOS is able to read the files anyway, it will
 truncate the filenames itself... or just upgrade to Win or something. =)

 _____Short and Long Filenames

 MS-DOS is able to truncate _unique_ long-filenames, but doesn't manage to
 differentiate long-filenames which have the same 8 first characters!  Only
 Win95/OS2 do this right... So I had to find a solution to allow MS-DOS users
 to read/play these specific filenames.  Thanks to my friend Snes/Playmobil
 (Hi Alex!) we decided to copy these files twice, but this time pre-truncated
 for MS-DOS.

 That's why in some musician's directories you will find a "MS-DOS" directory
 (it contains the truncated filenames).

 Here is an example with Mods-3:Modules/Authors.R-Z/Ramon directory.
 You will find the 3 files:

   Clockwiser-Demo.mod
   Clockwiser-End.mod
   Clockwiser-Game.mod

 You can see that the 8 first chars are identical, so MS-DOS will truncate the
 files as:

   Clockwis.mod
   Clockwis.mod
   Clockwis.mod

 And thus, when you try to read the second or third file, MS-DOS will always
 take the FIRST ONE (Clockwiser-Demo.mod, actually).  So, you will find a
 sub-directory called "MS-DOS" in which I have copied the second and third
 files specially truncated for MS-DOS:

   Cwiser-End.mod
   Cwiser-Game.mod

 You can notice this is not "8+3" but here only the 7 first chars are
 identical, the 8th will differentiate the files! i.e. MS-DOS will call them:

   Cwiser-E.mod
   CWiser-G.mod

 Then, MS-DOS users will be able to read and play them... Happy? :)

 I hope you, MS-DOS users, are happy, yes, because this gave me some more
 work, at the final stage of this project, to detect all these long-filenames,
 to copy them twice, truncated, in each 'MS-DOS' dir and all this was possible
 because there remained some free Megabytes on each CD, fortunately!

 I must thank Snes and all PMB's as well as Dr.Yes for their support
 during the Garden Party 6 (18/19-May-96), when we made this choice.

 Note: The truncated files have been ZIPped in the "Groups" dirs because of a
 lack of disk-space.  Thanks again to Dr. Yes for the operation (Zipping files
 on his PC) ;-)
