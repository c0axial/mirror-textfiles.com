GENERAL STUFF
*************

I am still waiting for those guys who did the Super Unknown demo to add
an escape KEY into their demo so I (and other 386 users) and watch their
demo.  How about it?  

Remember there are other sites to download these demos from--a few are
in Europe.  Of course, I don't think they mirror the incoming directory.

Rob B. of Sound & Vision BBS has a CD out of demos and other "multimedia"
stuff (like FLI's, MODS, etc.).  Info about the CD is in the /news dir
under the name "multimedia_cd."

More info coming very soon.  We plan on having an article in the newest
PULSE magazine explaing more about this project.

        Well, nothing really unusual this month.  Be sure to check out
Scream Tracker 3 tracker by Future Crew in the /pub/msdos/demos/incoming
directory.  Also, thanks go out to whoever uploaded all 16.5 MEGs of
Gathering 94' MODs.  (I listened to them all)  Don't forget to upload
songs by Skaven, Purple Motion, C.C.Catch, Zodiak, and Leinad.
        If anyone has "1 step further" by Jogeir Liljedahl, or "Anus",
by DJ Horse (Duck), please upload them.  They are the 7th, and 8th place
winners at the Gathering, and I can't seem to find them.
