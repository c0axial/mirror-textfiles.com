 :: Snowman / Hornet - r3cgm@cdrom.com

 _____The End Of An Era

 Diablo (music archive maintainer) is leaving.  With work and scholastic
 duties, he is no longer able to work on the ever-growing music archive.
 We are actively looking for a replacement.  There are a few people in the
 scene that we've thought about asking, but we wanted to give everyone the
 news in case someone really qualified wanted to volunteer.

 Position recommendations (not necessarily requirements): background in Perl,
 familiarity with our archive, a firm understanding of the overwhelming and
 continuous work that must be done.  :)  Please contact us if you feel
 qualified and are interested.

 _____Massive Improvements in /pub/demos/music

 Over the past two weeks, I've fixed and cataloged every stray file that was
 in /pub/demos/music.  That's right!  Every single song, music disk,
 program, sample pack, etc. is now in the HA4 database just waiting to be
 searched.

 There are now 8145 cataloged files on our site (5480 in /music alone). Those
 numbers are about double what they were two weeks ago.  This is a mixed
 blessing.  Yes, the database is more complete.  However, the allmusic.html
 file has grown to 2.2 megs (ouch!).  Search time has gone up noticeably.  I'm
 going to have to redesign a couple critical sections of the archiving
 software and make things easier for you guys to get to.

 Note that our /music files listings this week are a bit incomplete.  Since I
 was cataloging old files while Diablo was cataloging new, I had a difficult
 time separating the two when it came time to print this issue.  This should
 never happen again.

 _____The Good, tHe bAd, a/\/> +)-(<- *%_a49!&

 As I was fixing up descriptions in the /music tree, I came across a lot of
 things I wanted to mention to musicians before they upload to our site:

 1. Pick a 2 or 3 character prefix for all of your releases.  For me, it might
    be sno-lame.zip, sno-mann.zip, sno-bird.zip, etc.  This guarantees that all
    of your releases will be kept in the same directory.

 2. Try to avoid profanity.  It doesn't really bother me anymore, but it can
    be embarrassing as you grow older in the scene.  Imagine doing a search for
    Necros songs and seeing a tune he wrote in 1992 called "Fuckhead
    Assmuncher".  That wouldn't seem very professional, would it? :)

 3. Properly capitalized words rule!  If you have numbers or whacky case
    changes in your handle or song title, chances are they won't get
    cataloged correctly (and won't show up when someone wants to search for
    your stuff).

 4. Include a file_id.diz in each release.  Make it 25 characters or less. Use
    no high-ascii characters.  Be sure to say, at minimum "Song Title by
    Author".  And don't assume that anyone knows who you are.  For example,
    "Proud Mary Music Disk by Taco".  Is "Taco" a group or an individual?  How
    the heck do I know?  The group/individual distinction is important to the
    database.

 5. Only have 3 or 4 files in the .zip file: the file_id.diz, the song, maybe
    a group.nfo thing and maybe one other file.  When you start getting past
    that, people have to delete a lot of crap when they listen to your songs.

 6. Put your song title in the "song title" field within the song.  This might
    sound obvious but you have no idea how many people don't do this.

 7. If you get three consistent ratings of ** or less, maybe it's time for a
    break.  Take a month off, read some TraxWeekly, talk to some people on
    IRC, get their feedback.  Then give it another go.  If you keep uploading
    poorly written songs, people will download them less and less.  In the
    modern music scene, there is enough help out there to help you avoid a lot
    of newbie mistakes.

 8. Don't upload more than one song per week, tops (unless you consistently
    get ***+ or higher).  Imagine if I sent out 4 issues of DemoNews a week.
    At first you might think "cool, look at all those files and articles!" But
    after a while you wouldn't read them.  They would sit in your inbox. Make
    each song a "production"... special and important, not just another line
    to stick in your "Songs I've Done" list.

 9. Use small samples if possible.  These files aren't being sent to everyone's
    door on CD.  The public is downloading your songs with a 14.4 or 28.8 and
    crappy bandwidth to ftp.cdrom.com.  200-400k is a nice range for a song.

 10. Have one song per zip file.

 11. Music packs are ok.  Music disks are cool.  Distinction?  An interface.

 12. Tune your samples.

 13. Stick to song formats that are playable in Cubic Player.

 14. MOD files are generally outdated unless they entered a 4-channel compo.

 15. Don't rip overused samples.

 16. Music reviewers all have different tastes.  This does not mean they are
     bias.  A techno-lover reviewer will still give a high rating to a jazz
     song if done well.  Remember this when you're trying to find "reasonable"
     excuses why you got a low rating.  :)

 Give me 20 songs.  Let me rate them with a blindfold on.  Then let me see
 just the contents of the .zip files.  I'll bet you I can can come within * on
 each file, just based on how it "looks".  How you package your song is very
 revealing.  It's obvious who actually cares about their songs and takes the
 time to make them a polished production.

 And remember, just because we keep all songs on our site does not mean we
 encourage poorly tracked songs to be uploaded.

 _____Assembly Pics

 Howler's got some Assembly '96 pics online... check 'em out at:

 _____DemoNews Anniversary

 24 Sep 1996 is the 4th anniversary of DemoNews.  As we enter our fifth year,
 I promise to bring the /incoming directory back under control.

 _____Conclusion

 3 out of every 5 files prefer the /music directory over all others COMBINED!

 :: "Standards"
 :: GD / Hornet - gd@ftp.cdrom.com

 _____Introduction

 Recently, I took a rare trip through usenet.  While sifting through the large
 volume of posts in the comp.sys.ibm.pc.demos newsgroup, I read one message
 that claimed, "Coders usually don't care about standards."

 Standards have as much importance to the demoscene as they do to new
 professional software packages.  How so?  Often, the effect of a standard
 isn't noticeable without some explanation.  To present my case, I am going to
 refer to software user interfaces.

 _____User Interface - The Non-Scene Example

 A standardized user interface has many advantages.  For a new software
 package, it encourages users to skip most or all of the "how to" which is
 often necessary, and overconsuming of time and energy.  Skipping this step
 allows the user to get a jump start and find out what features they could
 benefit from in a particular software package.

 For our non-scene example, let's refer to word processors.

 To me, WordPerfect 5.1 for Dos has one of the worst user interfaces I've ever
 been forced to use.  When I need to use a word processor, I prefer Microsoft
 Word.  For the sake of argument, let's say that WordPerfect gets completely
 redesigned and has an interface similar to that of MS Word.  I can load up
 this new WordPerfect and, hey!  The same menu options!  The same hotkeys!
 This is great.  Let's see what else it has.

 However, if a user interface is something totally foreign, a user may
 struggle for hours just trying to learn how to open a file on their hard
 drive that they won't notice the new Advanced Grammar Correction System.

 By using a tried-and-true user interface, one barrier between the user and
 the full potential of the software is eliminated.

 _____User Interface - The Scene Example

 I've done my best to keep up with the new issues of the Imphobia diskmag over
 the last couple years.  Imphobia has high quality graphics, an impressive
 selection of music, lots of articles, and a simple yet effective interface.

 Recently, I downloaded a different diskmag that I hadn't heard of before.  It
 had a hard-to-read font and a very awkward keyboard interface.  I struggled
 with these two things so much that I almost completely failed to notice the
 nice background song.  Besides that, I didn't even get through reading one
 complete article in the whole thing.  And I bet I wasn't the only one.

 What's the result of this?  I probably won't download the next issue of this
 diskmag (no names).  First impressions are lasting impressions.

 _____Pass the PIIDI test

 Any new product which requires interaction is vulnerable to the "poor
 interface, I'm deleting it" (PIIDI) test.  Products which fail this test
 limit their potential for success.

 In the case of the demoscene where productions are free anyway, everything is
 much more vulnerable to this test.  The user tries it, doesn't like it,
 deletes it, and has lost only their time investment.

 Diskmags, tracker programs, graphics editors, and simple text editors are all
 subject to this test.  But many programmers and designers might neglect this
 consideration.

 If one wants to gain acceptance of a certain group of individuals, one needs
 to appeal to the group's desires.  Computer users don't want to struggle with
 confusing keys to gain a minimal advantage over their previous software.
 They want to dive right in and spend their time learning how to take
 advantage of "the good stuff."

 _____Conclusion

 In some cases, design and originality must be sacrificed in the name of using
 an accepted standard.  Providing the user with familiarity is one way to give
 a product a better chance.  To be truly successful, one must make the desires
 of the audience top priority, even if this means making alterations to the
 desires of the creators.

 :: "Text Mode Demo Competition (TMDC)"
 :: Sol / DEE - jari.komppa@pcb.compart.fi

 _____Introduction

 One day last summer I and The Joker/Crusaders got an idea. We both like
 textmode demos, and while they seem to be increasing, we need something to
 promote them. We'd like to see textmode demos in at least good position as 4k
 intros are today - ie. competitions in all major parties etc. Only way to
 make this happen is to get people to make some _good_ textmode demos.

 _____Why should I consider this?

 Textmode is not just for newbies who haven't gotten into 13h yet.  You can do
 everything in textmode that you can do in other modes; the resolution is
 worse, but that means it doesn't require as much processing power.

 Although you may not change palette in this competition, you still can have
 easily over 500 colors on screen at one time, by using back- and foreground
 colors.

 Please note that this is not a joke competition. While most of the textmode
 demos have been just curiosities or simply crap, you can do good things in
 it. We have already heard that someone is making a realtime raytracing demo
 for this competition. That is completely possible due to the low resolution
 and high processing power.

 _____When?

 The deadline (due to numerous requests) has moved to 11.11.96. This
 doesn't mean that you should hold on to your productions to the last
 day; please send them AS SOON AS POSSIBLE to make sure we get them.
 Results should be available before the end of November.

 _____Where?

 The competition is held in the Internet, but you don't have to have internet
 access to contribute a demo. You may send your contributions to:

   email: joker@crusaders.no or jari.komppa@pcb.compart.fi
 irc/dcc: _TJ_  (#CODERS)
     bbs: TRK +358-0-874-2789 28.8k (Dubius/DEE/Hysteria HQ)
   snail: Sol/DEE                 The Joker
          Laurintie 116           Stationsveien 56
          Vantaa 01400            2010 STROMMEN
          Finland,Europe          Norway, Europe

          Please include Self Addressed Envelope and International Reply
          Coupons if you want to have your disk(s) back.

 _____Basic Rules?

 Please get the complete rules before contributing a demo.

 - The organizers reserve the right to disqualify any demo, and the
   right to change the rules at any time.
 - The demos must be previosly unpublished.
 - Maximum file size is 1447424 bytes in a ZIP file, and 10 megs
   uncompressed.
   If you use DOS4GW, you don't need to include it in the ZIP.
 - Maximum demo length (in time) is not limited, but you should remember
   that too long demos are boring.
 - The complete demo must run in some textmode. Valid textmode screen
   modes are:
   40x12, 40x14, 40x21, 40x25, 40x27, 40x43, 40x50,
   80x12, 80x14, 80x21, 80x25, 80x27, 80x43, 80x50.
   If you want to use nonstandard text modes with these resolutions (for
   instance Liket's 60hz or 50hz modes) please make them optional.
 - Font and palette changes are not allowed; neither are other hardware
   tricks like splitscreen or startaddress. Light backgrounds may be
   enabled.
 - User must be able to quit the demo at any moment by pressing ESC.
 - Sound support: At least GUS (either native, MEGAEM (midi) or
   (IW/MAX)SBOS (SB/adlib)).

 that you can do anything in textmode.

 The Joker(TJ)/Crusaders has released full code to his textmode demo that won
 the Distortion'96, and the demo consists of 3d-vectors, texture-mapping,
 gouraud shading, zoom/rotate, good music and plasma-routines.  It's coded in
 pascal/asm.  Get if from: ftp.cdrom.com/pub/demos/incoming/code/ringnes.arj

 _____Other?

 If you have any questions, send them to either joker@crusaders.no or
 jari.komppa@pcb.compart.fi, or use the other contribution addresses mentioned
 above.  Sol/DEE also reads GSN, DGI and comp.sys.ibm.pc.demos.

 New infofiles (with complete rules etc) will be posted to c.s.i.p.demos and
 we will release an invitation intro later with 'final' infofile.

 Infofile version 0.9 (with slightly old info) can be found withing txtfli.zip
 (see resources, above).

 :: "Outdated Code, Modern Hardware"
 :: Unreal / Pulse - podgorsk@alpha.ok.ae.wroc.pl

 Some days ago I and 2418 other subscribers received the 127th issue of
 Demonews.  I thought this particular issue was pretty boring (or rather of no
 interest for me this time), but I managed to get myself reading the "Jim vs.
 Jim" article.  Usually I'd comment about this in Bad News, Imphobia, or
 Scenial, of which I am editor/writer, but I thought this time the thing could
 get outdated too quickly.  So, I'd like to comment on a few things here in
 DemoNews.

 One thing is the really hot subject among coders nowadays: "Will new gfx
 cards' features replace today's coders work?"  The "work" here is meant that
 done by polyfillers, for example.  Representing the opinion that it WILL
 replace coders is well-known coder (anyone here never seen Imphobia?) Wizard
 / Imphobia.  He claims that there's no sense to put much brainwork into whole
 3D stuff, because soon it will be replaced by the flash-speed features of new
 gfx cards, where things like z-buffer, gouraud, phong and probably few more
 will be a standard.

 The person that thinks about it in different way is Tremor, coder of Dubius &
 Dee, whose 3d system is very impressive.  In the not-yet-published interview
 for Bad News, Tremor says:

   T: As far as I know those gfx cards will replace some polyfillers...
   there's much more to do in good vector engines than just fillers.  All the
   3d-math, data structuring, shadow-engines, reflection effects + all the
   3d-effects etc. and much more will stay.  So there's as much sense in
   developing engines as there has been till this day.

 I think it shows more truth than other comments about it - technically, no
 card can absolutely replace coders' 3D work.  There are always N ways to do
 some stuff.  Today's fillers feature things like: gouraud, texturing, phong
 (few _real_ phong, though), bump, z-buffer, plus some more _plus_ all
 possible and reasonable combinations of those.  Who knows who'll invent
 something new soon?

 There are other aspects of this--surely, we'll see much, much more 3d stuff
 because that is what many consider magic.  3D-routines (concerning things
 like fillers and data transfer) will become a STANDARD function of your
 video-card! but more on that a bit later.

 Another thing - Trixter and Rimbo look at 3D-accelerators just like they were
 only the future AND they even forgot (IMHO) what it was they were talking
 about: Graphics-ACCELERATOR cards.  [In fact, J&J were talking about hardware
 advancements in general, they just used Accelerator cards as one example.
 -Ed.] Accelerator cards will speed things up, but you won't be forced to
 abandon your fingerwork (you will always be able to do gfx stuff on your
 own). Surely things like phong and z-buffering will be done faster with the
 new cards, but code optimization and technique are still the most important
 things in demos.

 YES.  Demos.  First of all, the introduction says: "or will doing that end
 the art of using programming tricks?".  They consider doing tricks an art.
 Tricks are nice, but they're a TOOL.  Of course, there are a number of
 competitions like 8086 and Imphobia Coding Compo that are trick-showoff
 competitions, but the main idea of demos is ART.

 The fillers and 3D stuff will get more popular, as I said before, by using
 the video-cards of tomorrow. This will somewhat reduce need for present-day
 coders (who must usually do things by hand and have to know HOW things work).
 These coders will be replaced by people who might not be as technically adept
 but who have more of a flare for design or REAL art!

 Imagine if someone could invent a brain-picture-to-paper-dumper, something
 that would dump what you imagine in your head onto paper.  Who knows who'd be
 better - guys like Dali, Shyshkin, Rembrandt OR an unknown guy with great
 imagination but no drawing skills?  It's the same with demos - there are
 surely guys with fantastic ideas, but lack of knowledge restrains them from
 doing really great stuff.

 Now, about the so-called end of "today's" scene.  They seem to say that the
 introduction of new cards and hardware will destroy demos as they are today.
 It will be the end.  Oh really?  Just think about all those C-64 guys
 compared to PC dudes - the Commodore 64 had very little memory and a simple
 music processor.  On the modern PC, we now have (by standard) 8 megs RAM,
 special music soundcards, gfx cards able to display up to 16 million colors,
 etc.

 What do those C64 veterans think?  Some of them say it "sucks", but a lot of
 them just moved on to the PC or Amiga scene.  Yes, people cry that "there are
 no more demos like on the good ole' C64," but everyone admits that what we
 can do now is far better.  The solution might be to realize how to use
 available resources wisely, and it was a much more life-or-death question to
 optimize things on the C64 than on a PC.  Nowadays we just say "buy a better
 PC".  It's kind of a sign of the times - the better computer you have, the
 less you have to optimize.

 What have technological advances brought us?  Take "Control" by Coma, a
 fantastic original video demo, until yesterday possible only on videotapes.
 Take "Contrast" by Oxygene, where the winners of the 2nd prize in the AMIGA
 contest at THE PARTY 1995 kick ass so hard.  Many say the demo is slow, but
 hey--only half a year after The Party 5 they release a visually FANTASTIC PC
 production.  The reason they can do that so fast (though I'm not of course
 sure that they were not working on PC before), is that they (Oxbab?) DON'T
 have to care about speed as much as they'd have to some time ago. Wanna see a
 good show? Buy a pentium; that's life.

 "Buy a pentium?"  Interesting, eh?  I could buy a 386 processor with
 mainboard for 0.4$ in many stores in Poland, which is half of the price of
 hamburger.  I can buy a 486 cheaply, and I'm talking about POLAND!  What is
 the next important fact is that when one buys a Pentium which he considers
 fast, one wants to see powerful things.

 Show me a non-scene man that would say, "Ah ok, no prob" when he asks "why
 are all those demos here you show me so poor, I've seen it in standard
 presentation in TP3 in 198x year" being told "Because people care that even
 XT owners have their fun." That's just life, and do you really want to stop
 people from doing things for hi-tech equipment, because YOUR vision of the
 scene is, in your opinion, going to die?

 They won't care, especially if the vision they see is far more beautiful,
 with "power for the masses". The future is that they'll be able to use
 today's tough utilities more easily to produce things much closer to their
 visions than they could ever do before.

 I said so many things about the benefits of new hardware, but I know there
 are of course some things that can be called drawbacks, too.

 As I said a few times before, coding either will not be so absolutely elite,
 or the I-coded-it-from-scratch coders will become really famous living
 legends.  Probably some average math-heads with no sense of style will be
 forced by reality to stop acting like gods.

 Another thing is that with massive size increases in media transfer products,
 and with being able to replace disk drives and/or HDD / CD, we can expect
 that everyone will do animation in 3DS (for example) real or imaginary and
 use it in demos.  Let's think, when will we see the first scene demo on CD?
 Not soon?  I would not bet.  The whole scene will probably get bigger, too,
 and there are many, many people who'd like to see it small, elite (in the
 positive sense) and cameral like it was 1992, for example.  But we, the human
 beings, always were and most probably always will be afraid of change.

 Those are my opinions. If anyone would like to know, I'm more or less
 involved with the inter-machine scene for 7 or more years now, plus a
 computer user for 12 years now, and I surely can remember the times of the
 Atari 800XL, C64, A500, 286, because I had all of those computers.

 Regards.

 :: "Coven 1996 Information"
 :: Red Haze - redhaze@student.adelaide.edu.au

 Coven 96 is a demo party being held in Adelaide, South Australia, from Monday
 September 30th to Wednesday October 2nd.  That's right, its less than two
 weeks from now!  It will be 55+ hours of demo viewing, module playing,
 network game playing, and competitions.

 If you live in Australia and go to university or school, Coven will be during
 your next holidays, unless you happen to live in Tasmania, and I'm unsure of
 the Queensland uni term dates.  If you work, then get some time off and come
 too! :) If you can make it, we'd love you to come along and join the party.
 (oh yeah, the party has nothing to do with witches except the name.)

 Last year, Coven 95 was pretty good, with an attendance of 50 people from the
 little ol' city of adelaide. If you came along last year and you're reading
 this, make sure you get along to Coven 96! Ditto if you didn't! If you went
 to OZ'96 in January, expect Coven 96 to be better! :P

 If you live in Melbourne, contact Black Artist and come along with him. (his
 contact details are in the info file that will be on ftp.cdrom.com in the
 Coven 96 directory in /pub/demos/incoming, presumably!)

 We're expecting 100-150 people (local and interstate) this year, and there
 are lots more competitions than last year. There will be a digital projector
 for the whole 3 days, hopefully a taste of the Amiga scene and Quake/network
 game compos, and in general HEAPS of fun!
