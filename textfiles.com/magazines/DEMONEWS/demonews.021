A 3D gfx person is looking for a demo group to lend his talents to--

CHANGES
!!!!!!!

What about:  /source/util and /source/misc
With utilities (i.e. mod players, intro makers) in the /util directory
and stuff like diskmags and other crap in the /misc dir.

OR, would you rather have /source /util and /misc all off the root?
Let me know which you like-->dmw@sioux.ee.ufl.edu

CLOSING COMMENTS
================

--I will be doing an EXTRA big DEMO.NEWS next week.  It will basically 
  contain the why, how, and what about me and the demo site.  I suggest
  you get it if you are interested in history.

--The quote of the week comes from me:
  "Even in perfection there are mistakes."

--The joke of the week comes from Funny Pages;
  "ANNOUNCEMENT:  The Miami HEAT will be changing their name to the 
   Possums because they DIE on the road and they play dead at home."
