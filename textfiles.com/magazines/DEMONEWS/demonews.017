SPRING BREAK
\\\\\\\\\\\\\

I invite anyone who will be visiting Florida for vacation (Spring Break/
whatever) to drop by.  I live in Gainesville which is located in the NORTH
Central location of the state.  A major highway runs 5 miles from the 
campus.  

My Spring Break is from now (March 6) till March 14th.  I have limited
access to mail so if I do not respond quickly don't fret.

-------------------------
CONSUMER ELECTRONICS SHOW
-------------------------

The CES is open to the PUBLIC one day only--June 6th (sunday).  It is held
in CHICAGO, IL.  I am going to try and go to this however I am now looking
for lodging.  Does anyone live in CHICAGO?

-----------
DEMO COURSE
-----------

A user proposed to setup a course on programming demo's. Item's
could be explained like basic graphics programming in assembler, making
simple scrolls, colour cycling, simple vector graphics, making your own
fonts, recommended literature, standard assembler procedures for
playing music files (mod, voc, 669).

If you're interested he's willing to try to set this up. But first he would
like to know how many people are interested and if the demogroups are
willing to supply him with information and assembler procedures.

If you are interested in such a course or if you and your DEMOGROUP
are willing cooperate please send a mail to GBRINK@NKI.NL

--Perhaps a BOOK can be written in the future as a result of something
  like this.

================
CLOSING COMMENTS
================

--I hope to mail out a "Contact letter" to about 20 demo groups in
  EUROPE.  There are currently 4 people acting as contacts.  Anyone
  else want to be a contact.  Hopefully a demo from the group I'm in
  will be released when I mail these letters out in a couple weeks.

--This weeks DEMOSITE quote comes from a meeting I had:
  "Welcome to the world of Bureaucracy."
