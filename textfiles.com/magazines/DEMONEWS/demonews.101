=---------------------------------------------------[Introduction]--[Snowman]-=

 Hello all.  Welcome to the 101st issue of DemoNews.  This week, I was
 interviewed by Darkness for the 11th edition of Imphobia.  Since we rely on
 Imphobia for deciding which /groups directories we have, I'm doubly looking
 forward to seeing it.

 Our site is making serious headway in moving from the old .txt based file
 system to the newer 00index.txt format.  In essence, all of the files on
 our site used to have a .txt description that described what each was.
 The new format has one file (called 00index.txt) residing in each directory.
 This file contains the file names, sizes, ratings, and descriptions.

 Since this system is relatively new and untested, there are still several
 errors in the file descriptions.  If you have time, please mail us with
 corrected versions of the descriptions.

 In other news, 01 File Section, 01 Article Section, and Hornet News never
 existed.  Some of you may remember newsletters by these names, but I assure
 you it's mass delusion.  :)  That 3-newsletter deal was a bad idea, and did
 not work out.  As of last weekend, all issues of those newsletters were
 converted over to the standard DemoNews format.  Issues 86 to the present
 now adhere to our current format.

 This serves 4 purposes:

 1. Allow people to write utilities and neato programs to read DemoNews
    offline (Phoenix's DemoNews Reader) and coolio programs to make DemoNews
    in colour (Gerd Troeger's DN2ANSI converter).
 2. Make it easier to convert the "New Uploads" sections to the 00index.txt
    based format we have online.
 3. Have a more friendly collection of back-issues for those who want them.
 4. Do what we can to erase a cold prickly point in Hornet history.

 Well, this issue took long enough to get out.  In the future, I'm probably
 going to start putting this thing out each Sunday night.  This will mean
 less articles, but more frequent upload listings.  That's _really_ why you
 get this newsletter anyway.  :)

 Until next weekend, take care and check out the new 00index.txt system.

=----------------------------------[Assembly '95 Report (Part 2 of 2)]--[Ior]-=

 _____Introduction

 Okay, well, I'll try to pick up from where I left off on the last article
 ... It's been weeks since I wrote the last one ... So wish me luck :)

 _____Saturday, 12 August 1995

 Okay ... The few hours after the 64k Intro Jury are pretty much a blur,
 probably because I was so tired at that time :) But I seem to recall
 talking to quite a few people :) including Skaven, Gore, Otto Chrons (of
 DMP fame), Sandman, Xtoto, etc.

 Finally, I happened to run into an old friend of mine (from last year :) -
 a Norwegian named Flie. It was just my luck, because he had a computer
 hooked up to the Asm Network... He graciously let me use it, and I had my
 first chance in a few days to check my mail.  I'm sure that sounds more
 than a little self-centered, and not the type of thing people want to read
 about.  But after all, if you are reading this, you know what it's like to
 have an email address and not be able to check your mail for a few days ...
 It's a very traumatic experience :)

 I think I also managed to take a short hop onto IRC at this time. Sitting
 right next to Flie were Axl and Calvin, from Daskmig. I had been looking
 forward to meeting them, after several conversations on IRC. Some time
 later, I met Gore again, and he told me about the new Gamehouse that he
 belongs to. In fact, he was handing out little fliers for it: Remedy
 Entertainment. It looks like a big project, because it has members of
 Future Crew, Complex, Aggression, The Movement, TET, Orange, and Accession,
 to name a few.

 I turned the corner around the table, and ran right into JCAB, from Iguana.
 He was delighted to see someone else who could speak spanish, and we talked
 for a long time about Iguana demos, and the spanish scene (among other
 things ;).

 Again, I turned around a different corner, and ran into Sandman of
 Valhalla. Just my luck, because he was the first other native english
 speaker that I had seen there. Although, his english WAS a little warped =)

 After walking around with him for a while, and finally getting to see the
 view from the upper seating balcony (quite a sight!), I ran into Zodiak
 from Cascada. Wow. :) All these people :) We ended up talking for a long
 time too (why not, after all?), and then went separate ways.

 Shortly afterwards, the compos began. I walked into the organizers booth
 about halfway through the 4th song that they played. They finished that
 compo, and promptly began the graphics competition. I stayed through that
 one, too (I was the only one there that new how to use the scripting
 program for the info screens).

 About halfway through that, Mellow-D walked into the booth, and asked me to
 run the 32-Channel Music Compo for him, because he needed to go to his
 brothers wedding (bad timing on his brothers part :) Naturally, I accepted
 :)

 So, when the time came, I ran that one too (And with all my luck, there
 were no complaints!!!! WOOHOO! =)

 I was about to leave, when the 4k compos started. I was forced to stay yet
 again, because of the scripting program. Well, to make a long story short,
 I stayed in the organizers booth for the entire length of the compos, from
 4-channel mods, to 64k intros.

 At long last, when it was over, I rushed out of that cramped space ... and
 right into Henchman, who asked me to be on the PC Demo Jury. =) So, a few
 hours later (after walking around, talking to more people, and eating
 EXPENSIVE food), I went to the demo jury room. Again, I said hi to Jake and
 Henchman (whom I met last year), and took my seat.

 I watched various people that I had met before pile into that room. Among
 them were Sandman (Valhalla), Avatar (Legend Design), Zodiak (Cascada),
 Lord Cyrix (Surprise! Productions), and Arjan Brussee (Ultraforce, Epic
 Megagames).

 The basics of it were this: We sat in that small room for about 2.5 hours,
 laughing, talking, considering, and then realized that we were only
 half-way done. So we took a 30 minute break :) We went back, and watched
 another 2.5 hours of demos. Finally, we stepped out of the room, and
 cheered :) It was well into Sunday morning at this time (probably around 3
 AM).

 _____Sunday, 13 August 1995

 Right after the Jury, I started talking to Zodiak again. One of the things
 we talked about was why his song wasn't played for the compo. I commented
 that I had no idea, and hadn't heard it, so we went over to Axl's computer
 again, and we borrowed it long enough so that I could hear his song.
 Respirator is an excellent song, and I don't know why it didn't make it
 through the jury, but if you don't have it yet, I recommend you go get it.

 Then we stepped outside for some fresh air. It was still dark (an unusual
 thing for Scandinavia in the summertime :), and we walked over to the
 original area that Boozembly was supposed to be at. Apparently, it had
 moved down a block :) We went down the additional block, and saw the state
 of the people that were there, and turned right around.

 Finns are not known to like Swedes as much as they could, and I wouldn't
 want to see the way a drunken Finn would treat a Swede. Our decision was
 also influenced by the fact that we were stepping on broken glass bottles
 for the block that we walked to get there.

 With nothing else to do, we went back in. We split, and this was fine
 enough with me, because as I went back to the room where the demo jury was
 held, I saw Jake and Henchman getting ready to take a little nap. I decided
 I'd join them. I know, I know ... you can condemn me all you want,
 after all, who sleeps at a demo party? ...but 2 hours out of 4 days is
 really not that much to sleep =)

 We woke up in time for the amiga demo compo to start. I went down to the
 booth (I bet you knew I was going to say that), and went inside (by
 request, they needed me for the scripting program again ... ARGH) ... I
 watched the amiga demos, and although a few were nice, the overall quality
 was not as good as I've come to expect from the Amigas.

 When it was over, I taught someone else how to use the scripting program,
 so that I wouldn't have to stay in that damn booth for the last two compos
 :) I made a bee-line straight for Flie's computer, and made sure that I got
 a spot where I could see the screen, and IRC at the same time. :)

 It was announced that the animation compo had been delayed, and that the PC
 Demo Compo would start first. The PC Demo Compo started, and I (along with
 a few others) described what was shown on the screen to the people in IRC.
 The PC Demo Compo ended, and I stayed on IRC - It's an addicting drug, and
 I hadn't had enough of it lately :) - and stayed through the Animation
 compos too (of course I DID see them all, Pulp is still the funniest :)

 It ended, and people started packing up. Some people left before the awards
 ceremony even started, but most stayed until the very end. The party net
 went down about 1 hour before the awards, so I don't think anyone managed
 to announce the awards over the 'net.

 The awards ceremony was held in the Play '95 area (Play had already ended).
 Everything was announced, and all was fine and dandy, and then, everyone
 left, and ASM was over.

 The fun hadn't stopped yet, though :) Mellow-D and I went back to his
 place, showered (Not together, you perverts) and took a nap (Not together,
 you perverts :)

 Finally, when night fell, we went out to meet Henchman, Flie, Jake, and
 Jake's girlfriend (as I've heard her referred to several times: The
 nice-looking blonde that spoke spanish ... this is a direct reference to a
 post on c.s.i.p.d :)

 We were there for about 30 minutes, when suddenly, who should walk in, but
 Gore's after-Asm party too! :) So, we gained a few more people, like Gore,
 Arjan Brussee, and Avatar (just to name a few) ... Eventually, we all got
 drunk, and staggered home, and slept. And THEN, no matter what happened
 officially, THAT was when Assembly ended. =)

 _____Conclusion

 Well, I hope I've bored you all out of your mind :) All I can say is that
 it wasn't my intention, but I hate writing things in first person, because
 I can never make it sound as vivid and exciting it is in my mind... But the
 memory of it is something I'll never forget. It is my opinion that everyone
 in the scene should see and go to at least one major European scene Party
 before they leave the scene... It's just such a unique experience. So, try
 your best, and see you next year! :)

=-----------------------------------------------------[Freedom at Last]--[GD]-=

 With the hours of sunlight continuing to decrease, leaving the western
 hemisphere in a shadow of cool autumn air, it seems that summer has left
 us. But believe it or not, Freedom is approaching.

 Well, not the same kind of freedom that many associate with summer, but the
 Freedom dual CD. One CD of audio - fifteen top-ranked songs from MC3, as
 well as five previously unreleased songs from some of the scene's finest
 musicians. The second CD for data in CDROM format - demos from the past
 year, all of the Music Contest files from contests 1, 2, and 3, a demo
 book, and much more.

 The two CD's will be distributed in a jewel box and feature some excellent
 artwork. The cost (at press time) is only US$11 for shipping to addresses
 in the United States and Canada, and US$12 for shipping elsewhere.

 Have you reserved your copy? Better do it now! Only 800 copies are being
 made, and there are to be no represses of the Freedom CD. Reserve your copy
 now via email to: dmw@gate.net

=-----------------------------------------------[Interview with GooRoo]--[GD]-=

 GooRoo is a coder and a musician in Kosmic. He joined in September 1994, a
 few months before the name change was made from KLF to KFMF.

 He has coded three demos: GooRoo Nation, Flight (entered at NAID), and
 Little Green Men (entered at ASM95). He coded the interface to Kosmic's
 EGG2 and EGG3 musicdisks, as well as released his own musicdisk which was
 titled, appropriately enough, "Code Break." He also has music on the Kosmic
 musicdisk titled "Half-Baked."

 He has also written a graphics library called "Wordup Graphics Toolkit"
 (WGT) which he uses to assist his demo coding.

 This interview was conducted in three portions: one session on IRC on July
 14 1995 between 6:30 - 7:15pm, one session on IRC on September 13 1995
 between 1:15 - 1:45am, and one questionnaire completed via email between
 those two IRC sessions.

 BN: GraveDigger [Hornet]       Brett Neely                   gd@ftp.cdrom.com
 CE: GooRoo      [Kosmic]       Chris Egerter       chris.egerter@homebase.com

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 BN: Hello GooRoo. Can you guess what I'm going to ask you first?

 CE: Ok... name, age, groups, etc. right?

 BN: Yeah :) Go for it.

 CE: Chris Egerter, 20, KFMF.

 BN: What college are you going to, and what are you studying?

 CE: Oh... I'm in London, Ontario Canada, going to University of Western
     Ontario. I am studying Computer Science (what else). Right now I am in
     my second year of university.

 BN: Of course. :>  Could you share with us the specifics of your PC?

 CE: I've got a 486/66 dx2, Trident 8900C, 1 gig HD, 8mb RAM, 250 meg Tape
     Backup, CD rom, and a GUS.

 BN: Where and when did you come up with the name "GooRoo"?

 CE: Last summer when I was writing my demo, I decided I needed a name like
     the rest of the demo scene. Since I was good at graphics, I first
     thought of Guru, but I think someone else already had that name, so I
     mixed it up a little.

 BN: When did you first get interested in the demo scene?

 CE: The first demo I ever saw must have been Ultraforce's vectdemo which I
     downloaded off a local BBS.

     It was last summer when I wrote my first demo (GooRoo Nation). I have
     been programming games for 8 years before that though. My first game
     ever was a moon patrol clone on a TI99/4A. Since then I've only
     programmed graphics and games.

 BN: Besides the TI99/4A and the PC, have you coded for other platforms?

 CE: I've also coded on the Atari ST for about 5 years.

 BN: Where and when did you first learn to code in C on a PC?

 CE: I first coded on a PC about 5 years ago. I believe C was the only
     language I really used until I learned a bit of assembly.

 BN: Can you code in any other languages on a PC?

 CE: I can code in C, Pascal, and a tiny bit of assembly. I've never written
     a pure assembly program. All of my ASM routines are parts of my C
     routines that need to be optimized.

 BN: Is there anything peculiar about the way you code, i.e. doing something
     that others might not do?

 CE: Haha Interesting question. I can't think of anything unusual about my
     coding though.

 BN: Do you have any coding tips or secrets that you could share?

 CE: 1. A little rusty on optimization? Use Watcom C because it will do a
        lot of it for you.

     2. Use C for most things, then convert it to asm for speed. Most of the
        time you can write C code in preparation for the conversion. For
        example, if you know you're going to eventually write something in
        asm, think about the best way to organize it when you code it in C.
        That way you won't have to drastically change the algorithm.

     3. Learn how to use a debugger. My favorite is running wd (watcom
        debugger) and hitting F5. If the program crashes, it will stop right
        at the line that caused the problem.

     4. Never throw away any code. The more you reuse, the faster you can
        make new programs.

     That's all for now :) I'm sure I could think of a couple dozen more.

 BN: What is your opinion of PMODE/W?

 CE: PMODE/W is the best thing since sliced bread. Expect to see it used in
     all of my future demos.

 BN: What's the best and worst parts about coding a demo?

 CE: The best part is getting to see people's faces when they watch it. I
     always get a small audience of family and friends to watch my demos
     before they are released, and it's nice to see people that don't even
     know what the scene is enjoy the demo.

     The worst part is hearing people complain about requirements, certain
     effects they don't like, etc. Criticism outweighs complements by a
     factor of 1000 :)

 BN: How did you become a member of Kosmic?

 CE: Maelcum was asking around on IRC for coders, and I was eager to leave
     my old group. I showed him GooRoo Nation and he accepted me into the
     group. He didn't know that I also tracked a little at that time.

 BN: Your first project with Kosmic was the EGG2 musicdisk?

 CE: Yes. I joined in September and began working on the EGG2 player, which
     was finished at the end of 1994.

 BN: Do you have any plans for Kosmic Player?

 CE: None. I was going to use it for EGG3 but there was not enough time to
     make some new effects for it, so it only got a test run in my own music
     disk (Code Break).

 BN: Why didn't go to NAID?

 CE: I really didn't think it would be a large number of people attending
     plus my opinion of the demo scene was not very strong at that point. I
     had never entered a demo compo before and didn't take it serious
     enough.

 BN: "Flight" did very well at NAID. Are you happy with the way it turned
     out?

 CE: Personally I think "Flight" should have placed better, but I'm happy
     for the recognition. It's not bad, considering it was the first demo I
     have written for a competition. :)

 BN: How much time was needed on your part to write the demo (excluding time
     used to write WGT)?

 CE: It was coded in two weeks (during exams too) in a mad rush to get
     something to present. A lot of the routines had been designed earlier,
     but only as stand-alone programs.

 BN: The ending which was added to the demo after the compo was a very nice
     touch. It's unfortunate that wasn't in the NAID version.

 CE: The funny thing is I coded the ending before anything else. That part
     was why the demo is named "Flight."

 BN: When did work first begin on the Kosmic ASM95 demo, "Little Green Men?"

 CE: 4 days before the party started :) It was funny because IOR kept
     bugging me to make a demo, but every time I talked to him I hadn't even
     started yet. He didn't expect me to have anything at all. I think he
     was quite surprised when I told him to download it :)

 BN: Phoenix's song was completed before the demo. Was the song meant for
     the demo originally?

 CE: I don't know about Phoenix's song. He gave it to me a day after I
     started the demo. I believe he made it right after I said there would
     be a demo.

 BN: Are you happy with the demo's placing?

 CE: Yes. I didn't expect to place at all, with something as crazy as LGM.

 BN: LGM focused more on design, whereas "Flight" focused on effects. How do
     you think this will affect your next demo?

 CE: The reason for that is I hadn't coded any new effects since "Flight"
     really. :) I HAD to put lots of design in it because my code was
     already seen in "Flight." My next demo will probably be a little of
     both, because I plan on spending more time on it.

 BN: What role did Maelcum play in the production of LGM?

 CE: He thought of the idea of little green men. He didn't really have much
     to do with it. One night we were talking about what we could do for a
     demo, and he mentioned LGM and making it like xfiles. I took the LGM
     idea and went crazy with it :) I don't think he liked the outcome of my
     work, but he didn't have much say in the matter :)
 
 BN: Do you expect to have something to compete with in NAID 96?

 CE: I will try to have something for NAID 96, but this time it will involve
     more Kosmic members and hopefully better graphics and design.

 BN: Does that mean more coders as well?

 CE: It depends on if the other Kosmic coders can use the same development
     system (Watcom C/WGT) as me. Otherwise it is hard to combine little
     pieces into one executable.

 BN: Speaking of WGT, have you received many registrations of it?

 CE: It has been doing very well lately. Perhaps someday I can live off WGT
     sales. :)

 BN: Who are some PC coders who you admire for their work?

 CE: Hmm.. good question. I like Jmagic's 3D engine, Darkshade and The
     Faker/ S!P for their engines as well. You can see I'm getting
     interested in 3D lately. Expect many boring vector demos in the future
     :)

 BN: What do you prefer in terms of music playing routines?

 CE: Music playing routines don't need much... as long as they support many
     cards, many file formats, and sound effects overtop the music. I'm not
     fussy about the quality like some people.

 BN: What is your opinion of groups that only support the GUS?

 CE: I think that is fine, but there's really no excuse for it. There are
     plenty of music libraries available they can use. It's mainly those
     groups who develop their own sound routines and can't support a bunch
     of cards.

     I got the same kind of reaction when I released "Flight" because it
     requires 8 megs. But, I write demos for myself, for fun. If you can't
     run a particular program, too bad... delete it and try another.

 BN: What is your favorite demo, aside from your own?

 CE: I don't have favorites. I used to think "Second Reality" was great, but
     I have not watched it for a long time. I download every demo I can
     find, watch it a few times, and delete it.

 BN: What other productions have you done?

 CE: I also write graphics tutorials and utilities. You can find most of
     them in my directory on x2ftp.oulu.fi (programming/wgt). For a complete
     list, look on my web page: http://kosmic.wit.com/~kosmic/gooroo/main.html

 BN: When did you first begin work on WGT?

 CE: I started work on WGT immediately after I used C language on the PC. My
     only interest was programming games and the tools to do that on a PC
     seemed to be extremely lacking. Here I am 5 years later, still working
     at it, and I have a great set of libraries and tools to offer.

 BN: In what ways has your brother been involved in some of your projects?

 CE: He has really been the person who motivated me from the beginning. He
     always starts something great and then I take the code and finish it
     for him. :)

 BN: What is your opinion of the demoscene as to where it is headed?

 CE: I think people should get over the "3D rotating object" demos and look
     for something new. Obviously 3D effects are going to be a major part of
     the demo scene and there are a lot of groups with good engines. People
     should be looking for design and how the objects are used instead of
     simple demos with rotating objects.

     Take a look at DX Project from ASM95 for example. This demo is nothing
     but 3D objects floating in space. I could have coded a demo like that
     in a couple days, I mean how hard is it to go onto
     avalon.viewpoint.com, grab a nice object, make a background, slap a
     texture on it, and push it through your rendering engine? Coders...
     don't do it! Voters... don't vote for this trash!

     Zweilight Zone was another demo which I am not impressed with which
     placed highly as ASM95. Personally I liked Japotek's "Something to
     Fight For," because they used animated characters. Timing the movements
     and making it look realistic is harder than making an object spin at
     random degrees.

 BN: What are your thoughts on european demoscene members who claim the
     North American demoscene lacks talent?

 CE: I intend to prove them wrong. Besides where you come from has nothing
     to do with it. Your dedication to your work will be the deciding
     factor. Also there seems to be a great difference in taste when it
     comes to demos. North Americans want good design and movie type demos.
     Europeans want surrealistic or just plain good effects. I understand
     they have their own style, but they shouldn't bash ours just because
     it's different.

     I think we'll see more talent emerge with every new North American demo
     party that is held. After all, not many people are going to write a
     demo for no reason. They want to compete! So I think we have the
     talent, it's just that people aren't making many demos because there
     isn't enough incentive.
 
 BN: Can you list some of your other accomplishments?

 CE: Hmm. Just going through school, running a business, and making demos at
     the same time seems to be a big accomplishment. It's a wonder I'm still
     alive :)

 BN: Before we go, can you say anything about your upcoming game?

 CE: Um, be sure to check out my game Scorpion Racer when it comes out
     (within the next year). It will be released by Optik Software Inc., you
     know, the Xixit publisher :)

 BN: Anything else you would like to add.. greets, plugs?

 CE: WGT5.1 is hot!!! Greets go out to Jare, TF, Pelusa, and all the other
     KFMF members. Oh, and SV :) :)

 BN: Thanks for doing the interview!

 CE: Thank you, it was fun.

=-------------------------------------------[The Digital Horizon]--[Thanatos]-=

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The Digital Horizon - The worlds only INET BBS dedicated to the DemoScene!
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------

 I would like to invite all demo scene people, artists, coders, musicians,
 and fans, to come and try our bbs. Its been online for around two months
 now, and many demo people, as well as a handful of commercial programmers
 have been using and enjoying it.

 The BBS itself is running YAWC, which is a heavily modified version of
 unix-Citadel software with many enhancements.  Here's a quick run-down of
 our featured rooms (message bases).

 _____Coding Rooms

 ASM Coding, 3D Engine Coding, Shading, Collision Detection, Clipping /
 Backface Removal, Input Device Programming, VGA/SVGA Programming,
 SoundBlaster Coding, GUS Programming, Demo Routines/Effects, Texture
 Mapping, General C / C++ Forum, General Pascal Forum, Memory Management,
 Unix Programming, Web Programming, Networking Code, Mathematical Concepts..
 etc...

 _____Music Rooms

 Music Theory, Tracking Techniques, Sampling Techniques..etc.

 _____Artist Rooms

 Pixel Art, Ray-Traced Art....

 More forums are added as needed and if they are on topic... we have also
 several miscellaneous rooms for scene discussion also.  A limited number of
 private rooms are still available.  These are rooms that only invited users
 can see and they are hidden from everyone else.  They are very good for
 groups who are wide-spread and need a base of contact and organization.

 Many rooms need RA's (room aides still). Necros has done an excellent job
 maintaining music theory, and between him and basehead, and a handful of
 others, there is lots of info any tracker could benefit from reading.

 _____Comments on YAWC

 For most people who are inexperienced with Citadel it can seem very awkward
 at first. One of its main benefits is its speed of use... once you get the
 swing of things it very easy to use.  Real-time Chat mode is currently not
 in operation, but eXpress messages work just fine, this allows you to chat
 with other users online much like sending a /msg to someone on irc.  Our
 system can handle probably 150 users, and has a T-1 connection straight
 into the MCI backbone.

 _____How to access the Digital Horizon

 Telnet dragon.axs.net or incantations.axs.net and login: bbs, no password
 necessary...

 dragon.axs.net also has a nice music ftp archive under
 /pub/demos/songs/<by-author>. Applications for directories can be obtained
 in /pub/demos/apps/dragon.app

 Hope I see you there!!

=------------------------------------------------[DemoNews Reader]--[Phoenix]-=

 DemoNews Diskmag may not be out yet, but now you can have the next best
 thing.  Last month I came up with the idea of a program that would read in
 DemoNews issues, pick out the article titles, and display the issues in a
 diskmag-style format, like Imphobia.  DemoNews Reader is the result.

 _____Requirements

 - Any IBM PC or compatible, 286 or higher.
 - MS-DOS 3.3 or higher.
 
 _____Features

 - Reads up to 100 issues of DemoNews (#97 and later)
 - Menu-style article selection
 - Four-song music selection. You provide the songs! (GUS required,
   S3M/MOD only)
 - Supports~color~codes within Demonews for extra
   `emphasis`on particular words. (only one color per line, for now)

 DemoNews Reader can be found at~ftp.cdrom.com~
 in /demos/incoming/news/ as~dnrxxx.zip.~ The latest version is 1.03,
 i.e. dnr103.zip.

 Simply pipe the incoming article into `sed -f demonews.2.ansi` and save the
 output into a file of your choice..  For example:

   csh> more demonews.101 | sed -f demonews.2.ansi > demonews.in.color

 Feel free to modify it or to do anything else you want with it :).

 For BBS-sysops I have a special version available, which produces BBS-codes
 instead of their ANSI-equivalents. If you do not have `sed` (who does
 not??), it should be available on any unix system and dos-versions are also
 available, let archie search for "sed.zip" or sth. similar in the archives
 of your near servers..
