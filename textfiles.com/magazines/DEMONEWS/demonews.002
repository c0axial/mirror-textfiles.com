NEW DEMOS
=========

-Realthng = "Even Better Than the Real Thing" was created and distributed
 about a week ago by The Phoney Coders.  It uses the ROLAND sound board so
 if you don't have the ROLAND then expect no music.
-Mantaray has been reuploaded as it was found to have been bad.
-I plan on uploading a copy of OVERLOAD with the sound problem CORRECTED.
 You can thank wwvdw@convex.uovs.ac.za for finding the mistake.

INCOMING
========

I am still waiting on that NEW Twilight Zone demo.  So far there has
been no word with Jeki.  If anyone has any demos not here please, by
all means, UPLOAD IT.
