((Section 4...Music Articles - MC][))
==============================================================================
(!IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT MUSIC FILES ON THIS SITE!)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Once again this week, I had to delete tons of files (including music
disks).  This trend will continue until we get more space, or our new 'helper'
get around to clearing out the ANSI section (which is eating up way too much
space).
        More of the /artists directories can be expected to be deleted unless
more space frees up soon.
        I am now handling all of the /incoming/code and /programming files.
If you have any questions, please write to me.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Music contest ][
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Only a few days left!  The contest ends this Monday, so get your entry
in by then.  I now have the pseudocode down for the MC2VOTE.EXE program.  It's
quite a difficult thing to do when you figure (approximately):
      -----------------------------
        80 songs
       * 3 judges voting on each one
       * 5 characteristics for each song:
                each characteristic has different strengths (i.e. Form might
                be 25%, and Samples might be %20)
      -----------------------------

Also, there are three different strengths for judges!

All in all, this will be a very complex program, and I hope I'm up to the
skills necessary.

Thank you to everyone who entered.  A list will be posted probably on the 7th
or 8th of this month of all known MC][ entries.  If you aren't on this list,
and you entered, GET BACK TO ME ASAP!  I would hate to have a song you worked
on not voted on because of a simple slip up on my part.

Lately, many of you have been making my life very difficult with corrupted
uploads, incorrectly named uploads, or invalid entries.  I will do what I can
to help but my time is limited so your being careful is paramount now.

Assembly 94 music
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Sorry folks.  Because of space restrictions, I am going to have to
delete all Assembly 94 tunes that didn't make it to the top 10.  I'm not even
going to get a chance to listen to them all unfortunately.  Songs with an '*'
next to them mean we have them online.

If you didn't make the top 10, I'm sorry to have to delete your song.
Remember, we will have to make cut-backs like this until the ANSI section is
cleaned up.

((Section 5...ESCAPE Demo/Music CD))
==============================================================================

Check /pub/msdos/demos/incoming/democd for UPDATES and information.
(i.e. More information, cost, how to get the DEMO/MC][ CD)

MUSIC

Enter into MC][ and PLACE...then your tune will be granted one
track on the DEMO/MUSIC CD to be released THIS October.  We plan on
mastering our MUSIC with a DAT player--which rents for about $40-$90
a day in my area.  GUS to DAT mastering.  If you have a DAT and
want to help us out then contact Snowman or myself.

ART

We could still use some ART.  You would not want to see my art on 
the CD....plus it would be in all ONE color.  If we get some cool
art then we use color, no cool art then we go single color (would
cut costs).  If you can draw and would like your art to be included
with "Escape" then get back to me--dmw@eng.ufl.edu.

I plan on moving the ASM94 stuff from /incoming/asm94 to the proper                   
directories very soon.  GRAPHICS will be move to /graphics and the
INTROS\DEMOS will be relocated to the /alpha/NEW/asm94/demos  /intros
directories.  I am not sure what to do about the 4kintros...but I
will probably group them all together in one big file.
