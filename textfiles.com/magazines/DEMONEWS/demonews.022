CHANGES
!!!!!!!

I'm gonna leave these changes up to Rob.

What about:  /source/util and /source/misc
With utilities (i.e. mod players, intro makers) in the /util directory
and stuff like diskmags and other crap in the /misc dir.

OR, would you rather have /source /util and /misc all off the root?

CLOSING COMMENTS

--The new "internet demo site" maintainer from here on out is:
  crt@tiamat.umd.umich.edu (Rob Shady)

Before I go...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As I end my demo site maintaining "career" and pass this site on
over to ROB I want to discuss how this site is now possible, a little
bit of what I went through, some of my problems, and what the future
holds.

Someone once said "If your going to be one--be a good one."  This 
internet system has allowed me the chance to create something "good"
so I did.  I set certain goals and did my best to bring about the most
organized and best (demo) ftp site around.  A few things I wanted to
accomplish were 1) to have a mirror or two, 2) have over 100 demos on
the site, 3) get a demo newsgroup.  All are now a reality though a mirror
in Europe would be nice for those who do have slow transfer rates. I thank
everyone for helping especially David datta and Ron D.  David kept the demo
site alive back in September 1992 when the original site would not allow
the demos--without him there would most likely be no IBM demo site like you
know today.  Ron helped bring about the comp.sys.ibm.pc.demos newsgroup--
without him demo communication would be greatly lessened.

Anyhow, let me know talk a little bit about how these demo sites were born.

HISTORY--The beginning of the IBM demo sites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I only began to learn about the PC when I took a course called
"Intro to Computer Software" or something of the likes during the
SPRING of 1992.  In the class I learned about DOS, Word Perfect 5.1
(DOS version), Lotus, and dBase.  I utilized a regular PC (5.25
drives only) for this class since I was not familiar with the PC. 
From this class I learned to grow and actually like the computer I
have on many occasions blasted--I am a C-128 user/owner.

Then, a good friend of my decided to purchase a computer to allow
him to do most of his electrical work at home rather then at school
where it was not always possible to get a computer.  He ended up
getting a 486 33Mhz, 8 Megs RAM, Diamond Speedstar 1M video card,
and selected other items.  He has since purchased a 14.4 Boca
modem and a HP DeskJet 500 along with a few other odds and ends. 
Since he was my roommate and currently is I have taken the time to
"learn" the PC.  However, not until the Summer of 1992 when I got my
internet account on a UNIX did I really discover what ftp and telnet
is all about.

I was and still am a Commodore 64 demo nut with over 400 demos on 24
disks.  I have even done 1 disk full of demos for a few groups I was
in:  Devastation Incorporated/The Unstoppable Pirating Force, The
USA Team, and Dead On Arrival.  My various handles were: 
Devastating Dan and CyClone.  My Commodore demo years ranged from
1985(6) till 1990.  College hindered my demo years when I was really
starting to learn ML in 1988-89.  So, still having demo fever I
wondered if such programs existed on the PC. 

My roommate downloaded a file called fishtro from a BBS.  This was
the first PC demo I had ever seen!  You can imagine how impressed I
was.  I think this was during the Spring of 1992 (April/May). 
Anyways, after seeing that I wanted more--much more.  I then wrote
to Future Crew and asked them about demos and mentioned how good I
felt theirs was.  Wouldn't you know it, they actually wrote back! 
And a few weeks later they sent their UNREAL demo to me in late
August.  Unfortunately their demo did not work but, there was
internet.

Before receiving the UNREAL demo I believe I had began my
investigation into a demo site (sometime around August 1992).  A
friend mentioned that the SIOUX (the computer I had my account on)
actually had an anonymous FTP server.  Well, I logged on and checked
it out.  I noticed I had write access and could create my own
directory.  I also notices some "obscure" directories.  Like 9
spaces, control characters, and such.  I actually figured out how to
get within these directories and learned what they contained--how
convenient. 

I decided to go ahead and create a directory called "real-demos", put
a few files in it and see what happens for a week or two.  Well,
nothing got deleted and I think a few people offered to uploaded
different demos.  After a couple weeks I noticed no-one was deleting
the 9 space directory and it continued to get new stuff every few
days or so.  I though about getting rid of it but since I set up my
"real-demos" directory without permission that my directory had
about as much right to be on the SIOUX as the other directory did. 
So, what is the worst thing I could have done at this point?  I'll
give you a hint.  How do you reach thousands of people to make more
contacts.  Yes, the newsreader.  I posted the following message on 
Sept 4, 1992:  "I am trying to create a UNIFIED DEMO sight[sic] where
people can PUT and GET DEMOS --and I am not refering to those crap
game demos....[this last statement is probably what nailed me] 
So, if you are interested in demos or have demos you would like others
to see get them from or put them at the following: 128.227.56.139
It is my hopes that this can become THE place where one can go to find 
the newest/best demos!  Spread the word!"
As you can see I never mentioned the directory--bad news--and I posted 
it on the ...pc.games section of the newsreader.

This posting drew many people.  I am also sure lots went within the
9 space directory as well as my real-demos directory.  Somehow,
someway higher people from my university discovered this directory--
the 9 space directory.  They capture the post on the newsreader (how do
you think I have a copy?), and matched up that post with the name in the 
real-demos directory.  Amazingly they were the same.  
Their concern was with the 9 space directory on their computer.  My 
concern was with only my real-demos directory.  Anyways, shit hit the fan, 
I was called into some meeting and sure enough the demos directory and 
the 9 space directory were to be deleted.  You live and you learn and
sometimes others will also learn from your mistakes if you inform them. :)

Luckily, by posting that message on the newsreader I drew someone
who wanted to mirror the site--datta@cs.uwp.edu.  By doing such he
saved the demo site.  I then directed people to this new site and
everything worked out well.  The only problem was the transfer rate
at the site was very slow for me so I (and others) wanted to get a
mirror.  After mailing many messages I tried another local account
(to the University I attend).  I mailed the system operator of
wasp.eng.ufl.edu in November to ask about having a mirror for this
site.  I would maintain the site and all would run smoothly.  Sure
enough, after about a month I had my mirror.  

LIFETIME
~~~~~~~~
Now, with all that said and done there will be a few people that look at
me differently simply because they now know something they never knew before.
Some people, myself included, like to know as much as possible--the how,
when, where, and why--thus I feel it is a good idea to be open about how
the demo site originally came about.  Of course there will be people who
will doubt my reasoning abilities when I placed the demo site right next
to a pirate site BUT had I not done that you most likely would not have
a demo site with over 120 demos like this one.

For me life is a bunch of processes.  I do something I like for awhile and
then when I've learned all I can (peaked) I tend to move on.  Same goes for
this demo site though college graduation is "forcing" me to move on.  It
was definintely an interesting experience--getting demos and talking to the
makers.  The peak happened when the site got PANIC the DAY it was released
and within the text file the internet demo site was mentioned.  This is 
what they mean by success.

Public Relations (PR) is no easy task.  PR is and was so important in getting
a lot of these demos--trying to convince people to upload new/old stuff.
I had or have contacted with people who have at least 100 demos NOT on this 
site.  Some of these people can not upload and others, well they were
local to the BEST U.S. demo bbs's, had internet accounts, but only got a few 
demos upload--if that.  Then, would'nt you know it, a couple weeks later
after them saying they would upload stuff their account expires.  So, I know
or knew people who had or could get lots of demos but quite often had a 
difficult time getting these people to upload.  Perhaps I should have 
included a PLEASE and a THANK YOU in my messages.  Sometimes I wonder--
was it my attitude.  Hopefully Rob will have better luck getting these older
and more obscure demos which I couldn't.  It is not difficult, it just takes
cooperation on both sides--especially patience.

ATTITUDE
~~~~~~~~
I'll be the first to admit--I have an attitude problem.  I like to say I
adapt to the environment in most situations.  Thus under hostile conditions 
I take a "screw-you" attitude.  So if someone comes to me with an attitude 
I will come back with a similar attitude--if not more vicious.  Looking at
things under another light I tend to be cynical (ironic), and want to help
others.  Survival means adapting to every situation.  Just look at the 
ROBOTS society likes to produce--I possess every characteristics and many
conflicting ones.

FUTURE
~~~~~~
By the time you read this the site will be guided by a new maintainer--Rob
Shady.  He may or may not have many changes planned.  From here on out I'll
only be know as X maintainer.  I wish Rob the best of luck.

I will be around--at least until I get a job or late September when my 
accounts expire.  But before I go I plan on sending out a Internet Demo
Site Press Release and our Toxic Zombie demo to about 20 demo groups and
to a few magazines.  Hopefully this will provide some publicity.  Be sure
to get our TZ demo when we upload it to the site!

FINAL COMMENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Well, you are going to make it through 10K of text.  You should be able to
make to through our Toxic Zombies demo which contains >10K of text which
requires over 15 minutes to read. :)

My future consists of getting an Electical related job most likely relating
to information systems/interactive tv/consumer electronics or a combination
of the above.  I "may" also produce a book called "Skool Dazes" "Crash 
Course" "Swimming in the Hate Pool" or something of the like dealing with
my college career, problems, and job hunting.  Nothing really "me" related
but more like stories, problems, happenings, stupidy, hatred, and jobs.
It is a long shot but it is quite possible--I have "published" five 
magazines dealing with "stuff."  Too bad the book will only be an under-
ground publication.

This summer I also plan on attending the CES in Chicago, IL on June 6th
I believe.  Perhaps I can meet a few of you.  But, if not and you are ever
in south florida or have nothing to do then call me at 305/472-2270.

As for writing you will find my address in our Toxic Zombie demo to be 
released this month.

Thanks to all who uploaded and will upload and everyone else who helped
make the demo site what it is today.  May it continue for a long time.

That is all for me.
