NEWSGROUP 
=========
The newsgroup will most likely be created after the voting ends--
March 23.  It will be called comp.sys.ibm.pc.demos.  I'll keep you
informed.

VOTE
====

Remember the PANIC demo by the Future Crew?  Well, it had a VOTING form
with it which FC hopes you fill out if you want to see their DEMO magazine.
They need about 90 or so more VOTING forms filled out before they consider
releasing the DEMO-disk magazine.  So, VOTE and send your VOTES to:
jtheinon@kruuna.helsinki.fi (Future Crew internet contact)
Everyone who votes shall have their name mentioned in the DISK-MAG.

NEW DEMO MAINTAINER

crt@tiamat.umd.umich.edu

SPRING BREAK
\\\\\\\\\\\\\

I invite anyone who will be visiting Florida for vacation (Spring Break/
whatever) to drop by.  I live in Gainesville which is located in the NORTH
Central location of the state.  A major highway runs 5 miles from the 
campus.  

-------------------------
CONSUMER ELECTRONICS SHOW
-------------------------

The CES is open to the PUBLIC one day only--June 6th (Sunday).  
I do plan on going to the CES, held in CHICAGO,IL.
But lodging if of my main concern.  Does anyone live in CHICAGO?

------
TRAVEL
------

I can fly just about anywhere for a minimal fee.  Most likely vists this
summer shall be:  Youngstown OH, Chicago IL, Seattle WA, and Northern CA.
If anyone lives in any of those places or anywhere else for that matter and
provides me transportation and lodging I will probably visit.
I am willing to TRAVEL--anywhere.
BUT, my main concern this summer shall be a JOB (Electrical Engineering) so
my reason for traveling to many of the places I shall will be due to trying
to secure an EE job.  Anyone got any EE job tips for me?

-----------
DEMO COURSE
-----------

A user proposed to setup a course on programming demo's. Item's
could be explained like basic graphics programming in assembler, making
simple scrolls, colour cycling, simple vector graphics, making your own
fonts, recommended literature, standard assembler procedures for
playing music files (mod, voc, 669).

If you're interested he's willing to try to set this up. But first he would
like to know how many people are interested and if the demogroups are
willing to supply him with information and assembler procedures.

If you are interested in such a course or if you and your DEMOGROUP
are willing cooperate please send a mail to GBRINK@NKI.NL

--Perhaps a BOOK can be written in the future as a result of something
  like this.

TOXIC ZOMBIES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We will be releasing our demo sometime REAL soon.  A Project date was
this coming friday the 26th.  However, a more realistic date is April 1st.

I will be mailing about 20 disks out and they will contain our demo and
a CONTACT LETTER.  If your group has a demo it can release at this time
let me know because there will most likey be free disk space.

CLOSING COMMENTS
================

--Has anyone noticed?  ftp.uwp.edu is about 10-1000 times faster.  
  I as well as many other people am happy to hear this.  

--Gopher?  ftp.uwp.edu can be ACCESSED world wide via the GOPHER system
  which many universities have on their LIBRARY computers.  Of course
  getting the files via gopher did not look possible.  Welp, just another
  one of those "look, don't touch" things.

--This weeks DEMOSITE quote comes from Steven Hill (Hearts of Space):
         "Safe journey space fans, where ever you are."
