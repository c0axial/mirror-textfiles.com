 Hello all, and welcome to DemoNews issue 114.

 Look at that.  We dropped by 29 subscribers this week.  The reason?  People
 have lost e-mail addresses and so DemoNews bounces.  Perhaps some of the
 136 people who downloaded DemoNews via ftp would like to consider
 subscribing to counteract that drop?  See the subscription info below.

 I would like to make a formal apology to the fellows of ACiD.  Last week in
 the "Top Downloads" section of this newsletter, I described the top
 download of the week (an ansi pack) in less than overjoyed terms.  About 5
 ACiD members have written me since then and voiced concern that I might be
 representing the ansi scene unfairly.  After looking through the pack, I
 recognize that modern day ansi packs actually contain very little ansi.
 Instead, the ansi scene seems to have flourished with many talented
 graphicians doing high-resolution works of art. Apparently I was behind the
 times and had some misconceptions.

 In order for us to keep the number of music files in /incoming to a
 tolerable limit, we need more music reviewers.  Please contact Diablo at
 diablo@ftp.cdrom.com if you are interested in joining our team.  The only
 way that our site and newsletter can continue to grow and get better is
 with increased help from the public.  Imagine the pride of having your very
 own alpha sub-range of songs to review!

 A few weeks ago, Dennisc on the IRC channel #trax suggested that we rate
 the files under /graphics/people.  This is still under consideration.

 Warning!  Look out for Juhla 96 demo makers on chemical substances! This is
 the only way I can think of to explain some of the odd entries this year
 (not bad at all, just odd).  And while we're on the topic, kudos go to COMA
 for their new productions "Paimem" and "60BR W."  I don't quite understand
 these demos but they are certainly the freshest new things I've seen in
 some time.  The world is already sick of toruses, stupid ducks and faces
 from 3DS, and the 18-bit tunnel plasma... now it's time to just confuse the
 heck out of the viewer!  :)

 My tip this week is to download as many new demos as you possibly can. I've
 reviewed over 50 this week and have noticed some new trends appearing. We
 both know you don't want to get made fun of on IRC.  So kick start that
 ncftp2 in your BSD box because some truly great and memorable demos await.

=------------------------[Introduction to 3D Graphics Programming]--[Kiwidog]-=

 _____Greetings

 Hello everyone,

 As my first code article since joining the Hornet crew, I've decided to
 write an introduction into 3D graphics coding.  Trixter informed me that
 DemoNews has never had a 3D article, so it seemed like a good idea. :-)

 This will not be just one article - far from it.  In fact, it will take
 quite a few articles to cover all the information I want to (after finding
 out about space limitations on article size I'm allowed to write, I've had
 to chop up the series into smaller pieces).  But expect a minimum ten or so
 articles coming your way...

 Most of the articles directly here in DemoNews will be abridged versions of
 the full articles themselves (I will have to remove or shorten a few
 sections to fit them in here).  However, the full article for each issue
 will be available in a supplement file on ftp.cdrom.com, either under
 /pub/demos/incoming/news/ or under /pub/demos/hornet/something_or_other. :)

 The supplements will be DNxxx_3D.ZIP, where xxx is the number of the
 DemoNews issue (in this case, 114), and will include the full article for
 that week as well as some sample C/Pas/Asm source from time to time.

 This series will assume you've never done 3D graphics (or "Vectors" as the
 scene likes to call it) before.  I'm going to try this on a very basic
 level.  If you're already familiar with the essentials, you might want to
 hit PgDn a few times.  Eventually, I'll write about more complicated 3D
 issues in later articles.  But let's take it one step at a time...

 _____What You Need To Know First

 I'm assuming you have a knowledge of basic algebra, i.e. early high school
 level math.  If you've had some Trigonometry already, that will help out,
 but I'll try to cover the basics of what you need from that as well.  But,
 more important than any one particular requirement, you have to like math,
 or at least a willingness to like it.

 MATH IS ONLY BORING IF YOU DON'T HAVE A USE FOR IT.

 Basically, 3D coding is not really about programming... it's almost
 entirely about math.  The amount of time you spend thinking about what
 you're doing is generally a lot longer than the time you actually spend
 pounding the keys writing the code.

 If you don't think you like math, and you're a coder, chances are you
 probably _DO_ like math and just don't know it. :-)  I'm serious... a lot
 of times when you hate a subject in school, you don't really hate it, you
 just think you hate it because you hate the way it's taught.  Once you get
 down to finding a purpose for all that "useless" knowledge.... it becomes a
 heck of a lot of fun.

 So if you like math, and you like coding graphics, you've come to the right
 place.  If you like coding graphics but don't like math... give it a
 chance; you may find out something new about yourself. :-)

 _____What You Don't Need to Know First

 Okay, generally speaking, the chain of math courses taught in high school
 and college (or their European equivalents, which I can't really speak for
 but I can take a guess) goes something like this:

 01. Algebra
 02. Geometry
 03. Analytical Algebra
 04. Trigonometry
 05. Pre-Calculus
 06. Calculus
 07. Linear Algebra
 08. Vector Geometry
 09. Multivariable Calculus
 10. Differential Equations
 11. Even more complicated issues that I haven't gotten to yet...

 You need to know up to #3 to make use of any of this.  #4 would be helpful,
 although I'll cover a few things here in the beginning to get you going, if
 you've never taken Trig before.  The Trig info is *NOT* in this abridged
 version of this article, but is in the full version in the supplement file,
 DN114_3D.ZIP.  So if you don't know any Trig, make sure you grab a copy of
 that supplement file.

 Pre-Calc and Calc aren't directly needed for this series, although you'll
 find it useful later on in life when you want to make really cool movements
 for your vectors.  And if you know through #7, life is a breeze; you can
 forget most of this beginning crap. :) Anything after that I'm not going to
 cover by itself, but you'll find it helpful if you know it, as you try more
 innovative ideas with your vector code.  But still, it's not necessary at
 all for the little I'm going to be able to teach you. :)

 _____What Will Be Covered In This Series

 Whew, it's a whopper.  Here's the series layout as I'm planning it so far.
 As you can tell, the first couple articles are for the _very_ beginners,
 like the kind who know how to code, but have never even touched anything
 with 3D before.  After the first few, it'll get more interesting though, so
 bear with me (if you have some 3D experience already, you can forget
 reading the first few articles; they won't do you any good).

 01. Basic Trig functions, 3D Coordinate to 2D Screen Projection.
 02. 2D and 3D Rotations & Other Transformations.
 03. Dot and Cross Products, Backface Removal and Lightsourcing.
 04. Polygon Fills - Flat and Lambert
 05. Polygon Fills - Gouraud and Phong
 06. Polygon Fills - Affine Texture Mapping
 07. Polygon Fills - Perspective Texture Mapping, Perspective Correction
 08. Spherical and Cylindrical Coordinates
 09. Polygon Fills - Bump Mapping
 10. BSP Trees and Spatial Partitioning
 11. Polygon Fills - Reflection Mapping
 12. Alternative Camera Positioning and Motion
 13. Path Management, Linear and Bezier Curve Movement
 14. Basic Inverse Kinematics
 15. (Unknown - I'm not sure how much further I can take it without risking
      losing the few tricks I have up my sleeve for my future :)

 It's quite likely that the later articles will be split into separate
 articles as well (I doubt I can fit both Gouraud and Phong, for example,
 into one article).  So the numbers are probably going to get higher and
 higher.  It will probably be around the time of NAID or afterward that the
 series ends.

 Get ready for a crash course in 3D... :-)

 _____Section One - Basic Trigonometric Functions

 Well, the majority of you have taken Trig by now, so by space limitations,
 I can't fit this section in here.  But as I mentioned before, the section
 is in the supplement file, so make sure to download that if you need a
 rundown on the Trig you'll need.
 
 _____Section Two - The 3D Cartesian Coordinate System

 Okay, you're undoubtedly already used to doing graphics in 2D using the X
 and Y axes; it's what you've been doing in algebra all along.  Well using X
 and Y is the 2D standard of the Cartesian coordinate system, and likewise,
 we need to add another axis of depth for 3D - The Z axis.  But where does
 this Z axis go?

 Well X and Y are perpendicular to each other in the 2D plane.  It's the
 same as the plane of your screen, for example.  Well in 3D, we can get
 depth by putting the Z axis perpendicular to that entire plane altogether,
 going either into or out of your screen.

 A common term for a line or plane perpendicular to another plane is
 "orthogonal".  That is, we want a Z axis that's orthogonal to the XY screen
 plane.

 But in which direction?  It can either go into or out of the plane, so
 which one is right?  Well this is really entirely by convention... the
 standard way is to use a "right handed" orientation.  What's a right handed
 orientation?  Okay, hold up your right hand in front of your face.  Point
 your thumb toward your nose.  Now look at your fingers... they curl
 counterclockwise.  This is the basis behind a right-handed system.

 When you have the XY plane, the two axes for X and Y are to the right and
 going up, respectively.  So if you start your hand at the first axis, X,
 and curl your right hand's fingers in the direction of the second axis, Y,
 your thumb will point out toward your nose.

 So the Z axis goes out of the screen, toward you, by a right-handed system
 (for the same reason, if you used the YX plane instead of the XY plane, the
 curl would be in the opposite direction and Z would go into the screen
 instead).

 Cheesy ASCII graph....

		| Screen Plane

        /-------X
       /
      /
     /
    Z


 The graph above is the way we're going to do it in this doc.  All 3D
 Cartesian really is, is just the same coordinate system you're used to, but
 with the added dimension so you can locate a point anywhere in space and
 not just on a plane.  End of story (You might find later that other
 coordinate systems, like spherical and cylindrical, can help out with some
 routines... but I'll go over those in time).

 Short section, eh?  There's more, but not much. :-) Well, now with the 3D
 system in your grasp, it's time to put it to use, and get some 3D points to
 show up on-screen.
 
 _____Section Three - Perspective Projection
 
 Now we've got this nice XYZ spatial coordinate system... but how do we take
 advantage of it and get some stuff on-screen from it?  In 2D, it was
 easy... you just used the same X axis as in your coordinates, and the Y
 axis was the same only flipped upside down (since as you know, in coding
 it's easier if the Y axis goes down, for calculation reasons).  But how are
 we going to take this Z thing into account and make things look right?

 The way we do it is by "Perspective Projection".  Perspective is a pretty
 basic idea which you see continuously in your life.... Things further away
 from you look smaller than things closer up.  Pretty obvious fact that
 you've lived with throughout your existence. :)

 Well all we have to do is turn that simple principle into math...

 English way: "Things further away from you look smaller than things
              closer up."

 Math way   : "The projected size of any object in the eye is inversely
              proportional to its distance from the eye".

 It's more "math-like", but still makes sense, right?  They both mean the
 same thing more or less, but the second phrase is more easily turned into
 equation form... the kind we can put into our code.

 Okay, by our ASCII graph of the coordinate system, your eye lies right
 along our Z axis, staring down in the negative direction (the Z axis goes
 out of your screen, and you're looking in).  So an object's, or point's,
 distance from the eye is going to have a lot to do with the Z coordinate of
 that point.

 So the first thing we need to settle is, if our eye (or in our case, the
 video screen) is sitting somewhere along the Z axis.... where along the Z
 axis is it?  In truth, this is entirely up to you... the screen is just a
 "camera", and we're trying to find a convenient place for it to sit. All we
 know is that it goes along the positive Z axis.

 It turns out for calculation reasons that a very effective place to put the
 camera is at Z=256.  You'll see why in a minute... (and no, none of this is
 carved in stone.  Cameras can go anywhere and view in any direction, it's
 just that the math gets more complicated).

 Okay, now we've got the camera at (0,0,256) and pointing in the negative
 direction.  That means that our Cartesian origin is exactly 256 units away
 from us, right along our line of sight.  The next thing we need to make up
 is a frame of reference for X and Y.... How big, visually, is a unit along
 X or Y?  Well we can use any set of values we see fit, but just to make it
 easier on the brain, we want to use something we're already used to...
 something intuitive...

 How about 1 pixel?  It's easy to compute, since it's the same as your
 screen plane.  Okay, so we know _somewhere_ viewable along this axis, X and
 Y are going to mean 1 pixel units.

 But where along the Z axis?  If things get larger as they get closer and
 smaller as they get further away, where's a good distance to say where the
 unit/pixel plane sits?

 Heck, why not just use the Z=0 plane?  After all, we know the origin is
 perfectly visible (256 units down the -Z axis) so the origin is easily in
 reach, and probably will make it easy to calculate our perspective viewing.

 Okay, we've got all we need to set up some perspective equations.  Now
 let's do some simple examples in our heads so we can find out where these
 equations are coming from...

 In 320x200 resolution (you can use any resolution you want, really, but
 this is just for demonstration), the center point of your screen is at
 (160,100). Makes sense, and you're probably very used to this by now.
 Well, we're viewing along the -Z axis, so that's where our axis is going
 down.  Right along the line of that pixel.  No up, no down, no left, no
 right.  That's it.

 Now we know that at Z=0, every X and Y unit means one pixel.  So where
 would (5,5,0) be positioned?  Well, it's the same as our screen plane, so
 there's no distance adjustments to do.  It's 5 to the right of the origin,
 so ScrX=160+5 = 165.  And it's 5 above the origin, which is in the opposite
 direction of our "screen plane" Y, so that's ScrY=100-5 = 95.  You've got
 your projected point.

 So what to do with points not on Z=0?  Howsabout (5,5,128)?  Well if we
 think about it, Z=0 is 256 units distance from the screen.  Well Z=128 is
 256-128 = 128 units distance from the screen.  Exactly half of the distance.

 Half the distance?  That makes it twice the size! :-)  So instead of adding
 5 to X and subtracting 5 from Y, you'd use 10 instead for each axis.  That
 would give us screen coords (170,90) for this point.  Same 3D X and Y as in
 the first example, but the fact that it's so much closer makes it look
 further from the center of the screen... the essence of perspective. :)

 Now in general, our equations go something like this

	ScrX = ( Lens*X / Distance ) + CenterX
	ScrY = CenterY - ( Lens*Y / Distance )

 I'll explain each piece.  First, ScrY _would_ be the same basic equation as
 ScrX, except that we have to do the subtraction instead because Y goes down
 onscreen, not up.  Anyway, we have a few variables here...

 ScrX and ScrY are the screen point of the 3D point we're trying to project.
 I figure you guessed that one already. :-)

 Distance is the distance of the point from the eye.  As we discussed
 before, this has a _direct_ correlation to the Z coordinate of our 3D
 point.  Now since we're on the positive Z axis but viewing in the negative
 direction, and we know that at Z=0 the distance is 256, then any point
 where Z > 0 will have a distance < 256.  Likewise, if Z < 0, the point will
 be further away than the origin, and distance > 256.  This makes distance a
 very simple value:

	Distance = (256-Z)

 Pretty easy, eh? :-)  Now, Lens is a multiplier used to give your
 projection the right "field of view" that you want.  You can manipulate
 Lens to give the projection a very narrow range of vision, or to give it
 the classic "wall-eye" view as well.  But in general, a really messed-up
 field of view will make people want to vomit.  It's not natural.

 So we want to set it to something that will "feel" natural.  Well, from our
 calculations and the fact that we want a unit/pixel relationship at Z=0, we
 can get our Lens factor immediately... 256.  It's also a nice multiplier,
 as you can use bit-shifts to get it, instead of a costly MUL instruction.

 And finally, CenterX and CenterY are positive integers that match to the
 center X and Y point onscreen; 160 and 100 in this case (the Center value
 for any resolution is just the resolution/2, which makes sense).

 So, from there, our equations boil down to

	ScrX = ( 256*X / (256-Z) ) + 160
	ScrY = 100 - ( 256*Y / (256-Z )

 The first thing you should recognize is that we don't need to calculate
 (256-Z) twice.  Also, if you use fixed point, you can calculate the divide
 only once as well, but that's for a later article (I'm not focusing on
 optimizations in this one).  Anyway, let's work out one of our previous
 examples using these equations and see if we get the same result.  How
 about the (5,5,128) one...  let's see...

	Distance = 256-Z = 256-128 = 128

	ScrX = ( 256*X / 128 ) + 160
	     = ( 256*5 / 128 ) + 160
	     = 10 + 160
	     = 170

	ScrY = 100 - ( 256*Y / 128 )
	     = 100 - ( 256*5 / 128 )
	     = 100 - 10
	     = 90

 Yup, same answer!  And these equations go quite easily into code. :-)

 Now you'll find that using straight integer math with these equations will
 work well at first, but there are added advantages to using fixed point
 math as well.  If you're familiar with fixed point, you should have few
 problems trying to adapt this to it, speeding things up in the process. If
 you're not familiar with it, don't sweat it; I'll cover it in an upcoming
 article.

 Well, looks like that's the end of this article... make sure to check out
 the supplement for some sample source in Pascal and C, and try a few
 experiments out on your own!  You'll want to get very familiar with
 projection as we get into more advanced stuff later on... and since it's at
 least a week until the next DemoNews, you've got the time, so take
 advantage of it. :-)

 Next issue, it'll be time to start on our path to not just getting these
 points up there, but getting them to move.  Straight movement left, right,
 up, down, in and out is easy... you just add or subtract from X, Y, or Z.
 But rotation, that's another story.

 Until next time.

=------------------------------------------------[OZ96 Mini-Report]--[Random]-=

 Hello, Random here.  I was one of the organizers of the small demo party
 called Oz96 held here in Australia on the week of the 17th of January! This
 is just a short party report, my full report will be in the Oz96 party
 report (real intro thing :]), or in NWO#9, or in What?!#2 or wherever.. :)

 Unfortunately this article has been inspired by something depressing.
 Unlike some of the other short reports I have written for Oz96, such as the
 TraxWeekly Music compo report, that report was written in a happy mood
 after hearing good comments of Oz96.  But of course some people believe
 that everything is bad, and they must put it down, so that is what has
 inspired this! :(

 Anyway, the party started on the 17th of January ('96), and finished on the
 19th.  There were 'officially' 59 people who attended, but another 5-10
 people decided that they didn't need to pay so they abused our rather
 friendly attitude. :(  That was mainly because they only stayed for a
 couple of hours anyway, so it wasn't that bad.  (Also two people who turned
 up just before the final compo on the last night of the party didn't have
 to pay).

 The organization of the party got off to a bad start. :)  Of the 4
 organizers in Sydney (where the party was held), 2 of them were on Holidays
 in the US up till the 13th of January!!  :)  But just about everything went
 quit well despite that. :)

 On the first day of the party when the organizers were supposed to turn up
 early, all but one (ME!) came late, so it was again weird. :)  We had
 noticeable problems setting things up, the venue was still in a slight mess
 when the actual people started turning up, and we didn't get the network
 fulling running until the next day! :)  But it didn't really matter.

 Once people started turning up the main problem was that even though we had
 locked the front entrance to the party and put a sigh saying that entry was
 at the rear, somehow people managed to get in through there! :) So it made
 selling the tickets slightly more trouble than expected. :) But due to the
 fact that everyone attending was quite honest nobody purposely evaded
 paying.  Well, with some exceptions, but they had their 'reasons' which
 were fair, in some cases (but I wont bother getting into them).

 Once the actual party started, i.e. us organizers started speaking and
 shit, we realized that we didn't have a working microphone! :)  The one we
 had was broken. :(  But it was a small enough venue so that it wasn't
 really necessary!  Due to that and some other things, the first compo, the
 Ansi compo, was delayed slightly.  We also realized that the big screen
 projector we had been promised was not turning up! :(  So instead of having
 use of a AU$20,000 digital projector which we were promised, we had to put
 up with a rather old PAL projector, and a VGA2PAL converter.  Needless to
 say the quality was not the highest. :(

 But once we had everything going, and we started collecting ANSI entries,
 we were suddenly shocked to find only 2 entries entered before the
 'deadline'!! :)  So we extended the 'deadline' slightly to figure out what
 the hell was going on, and in the next 5 minutes, another 9 entries turned
 up. =)  So we were happy! :)

 The ANSI compo went through without any incident and same with the VGA
 compo afterwards!  When we came to the music compo, everything was going
 good, and we had played 15 (of 24) entries, when the neighbors decided to
 complain. :)  It was about midnight by now, so it was understandable. :)

 The lucky entry to be the 'cause' of the complaint was called the "Tired
 Man", and was by Tuksu (sort of in the group Tpolm :]).  That entry did not
 come out 'as expected' on the sound system, and so it was understandable at
 the time why the neighbors got angry. :)  In the end Tuksu ended up placing
 4th, and he won a prize, so it turned out great for him! :)

 Anyway, the remainder of that night was filled with 'Pulp Fiction' Laser
 Disks, and Ren and Stimpy episodes, so it was fun! :)

 The next day we finally got the Network running very well, and despite the
 quite rare blackout it was very stable!  So we got some things like a very
 large Doom2 comp going, in which one of our Sponsors, Spatial Systems, was
 giving away two of their 'SpaceBall' 3D controllers, which we all got
 plenty of time to play around with! :)  Also some Command & Conquer games
 got going, but the best game; Ozone&Random vs. BlackArtist&Friend didn't
 get going.  :( hehehe...

 Once we got back into the competitions again things were delayed again, but
 we eventually got the 16k music compo going well, and everything was fine.
 :)  But, when it came to the 4kb intro and demo compos, things got 'hairy'
 :)  We realized that the compo machine had not arrived (since on the night
 before it experienced 'technical' problems), so we had to find a
 substitute.  That made some people happy, (hiya Gaffer) as it let them
 finnish their entry! :)  In the end we used a 486dx2-66mhz, instead of a
 dx4-100mhz, but there were very few complaints. :)

 Once we got those compos going they went nicely, very few entries crashed,
 and when they did they were re-played with a different setup anyway.. So
 overall things were nice.  Unfortunately due to the mixups before the compo
 one entry was not shown!!  That was 'From Real 2 SuperReal' By Jsno/Hornet,
 which was a great pity that it wasn't shown, but by the time we realized it
 was too late. :(  That demo is one of the best from the party so I suggest
 you get it, it will be released with the rest of the entries.

 After (and during) the demo compo (which was the last event) many people
 started getting intoxicated [hide] :), and so the results of the demo compo
 voting probably were affected by that. ;)  But lots of fun things happened
 at this time, and it was a good end to the party!  (I wont say much of
 this, I'll leave it to one of the other reports, which will include the
 interview with one particular drunken group. :])

 In the end, most people said they were quite happy with the party, and were
 anticipating Oz97! :)  Which it seems will be held same time next year but
 in Queensland, not NSW.  That should be interesting. :)

 From how I see it, the scene is made for fun! And that is the ONLY thing I
 had in mind while doing whatever organizing I was doing.  Unlike some large
 Euro parties which are basically organized by large Companies who sponsor
 the event, Oz96 was all for fun.  And that's what happened in the end.

 I am very happy with how things turned out, and even though we only had
 around 70 people attending, all the costs were totally covered, including
 prize's. So it goes to show how the scene can have fun without the
 'commercialism' that becomes so prominent in the larger parties..

 I guess I can close by saying; "We had no Damn Rave in the sleeping area!"

 Bye then.. =)
