 Three demo-parties took place over the past week: The Meeting in France,
 General Probe in Poland, and Mini-Gathering in Norway.  Here are a few
 productions from them that were uploaded on Hornet.
 
 The rating scale:

    *      Not worth downloading.
    **     It will leave you bland.
    ***    A worthy effort.
    ****   Hope these guys show up at NAID/ASM'95..
    *****  Required for your demo/music collection.

_____"Soap II: Even Cleaner" by Proxima (soap_ii.zip, 81k)

 Party/Place/Category: Mini-Gathering '95 / 1st / 100k intro
 Requires: 386?/VGA/math coprocessor/emulator
 Sound support: GUS/silence 
      (MOD with soundtrack can be heard separately)
 Rating: ***+  (3.5 of 5)

 I remember seeing Proxima's "Soap" intro for The Party '94 and I wasn't
 very impressed.  This sequel is a step up.  It starts out with a warped
 logo, then shaded vectors of the letters S,O,A,P, and II fly out.  This 
 is followed by the credits in front of fast moving textures.  The rest 
 of the intro, which requires you have a math chip, is some nice motion 
 blur, plasma, and the soap pic closes it out.  The music is nice too, 
 nothing fancy.

_____"Larstro" by Larstr (lrstro.zip, )
 
 Party/Place/Category: Mini-Gathering '95 / 3rd / 100k intro
 Requires: ?/VGA/Math coprocessor
 Sound support: GUS/silence
 Rating: *+    (1.5 of 5)

 After seeing this, I would hate to see 4th-10th place Mini-Gathering
 intros!  There are bouncing balls, a winter scene which turns into a 
 dumb Alice-In-Chains pic, and an EGA landscape that takes a long time 
 to generate.  This would have probably gone much better if it was done
 by a group instead of one person.

_____"Ambient" by Antares (aambient.zip, 70k)

 Party/Place/Category: The Meeting '95 / ? / 64k intro
 Requires: 386+/VGA
 Sound support: GUS/silence 
      (must run "ambient /no_snd" w/o GUS)
 Rating: ***   (3 of 5)

 Not much new about this demo.  I can't rate the music, since I don't have
 a GUS.  The intro starts with a scroller (augh! :) which I've seen in a
 4kb intro.  The other effects are familiar too: rotating multi-color
 circles, warped/plasma circles, a textured cube, a fractal-zoom (math 
 chip recommended!), and greetings on a flipping cube.  Impressive in 
 1993 maybe, but with today's intro standards, no.

_____"Plastic" by The Cross (4kbmeet.zip, 10k)

 Party/Place/Category: The Meeting '95 / ? / 4k intro
 Rating: ****+ (4.5 of 5)

 Incredible! This intro has the some of the best graphics I've seen in 4k.  
 Three parts: 1) Rotating landscape,
              2) Plasma with waving scroller, also color-changing, and
              3) Credits with scrolling background design.
 Hopefuly these guys will make another intro; this is their first production.

 (footnote: 4kbmeet.zip also contains the next intro plus one called
 "nigtro", which was so poor I didn't even review it.)

_____"Vier Natte Kaas" by The Natives (4natekas.zip, 5k)

 Party/Place/Category: The Meeting '95 / ? / 4k intro
 Rating: **+   (2.5 of 5)

 Just one screen, but three things at once: a logo, some plasma,
 and a shaded vector polygon.  Decent.

_____"Nitro" by Strerocode (nitro.zip, 26k)

 Requires: 386+/VGA
 Sound support: SB (Adlib may work too) / Silence
 Rating: ***   (3 of 5)
 
 This is a pretty small intro (17k w/o the txt's), so it's creative for
 its size.  There is a nice blurred pattern through most of the intro.
 The best part of Nitro is a zoom-rotation that is _animated_, with what
 I think is called a "shadebob" in Europe.  The midi music is a bit dull.

 For the most part, these intros were not up to par.  We probably won't
 see many good demos/intros until the April parties (The Gathering '95,
 NAID '95, etc..)

_____Escape hath Escaped

 Many thanks to those who have helped make the ESCAPE CD ROM a success. The
 CD project began back in April 1994 with a CD being pressed in November
 1994.  The project officially ended this month with all 400 CD's having
 been distributed--no more represses will be done.

 My total investment for producing 400 CD's was in the neighborhood of
 $2,500.  I did not end up losing any money on the project--thank goodness--
 and actually came out ahead a couple hundred dollars ($300 or so).  I did
 not keep good records on the first 300 sold so I only know a good
 approximated dollar range I made distributing the final 100 CD's.  The way
 I saw the project was--sell all the CD's (300) with no repress and you will
 not lose any money.

 I did not declare Escape as a business so I only felt a need to keep a
 minimal track of what was going on money wise.  As far as LOSSES go 3 CD's
 were declared missing--all mailed on the same day in an over stuffed
 mailbox.  Stealing mail is a felony but I guess some people don't care.
 Wired transfers netted me a loss of $25, and one CD mailed has thus far
 went unpaid.  The wired transfers can be blamed on the banks whom did not
 inform me about those HIDDEN cost beyond the $15 dollar fees.

 I'm still waiting for the other money to come in...maybe someday.  I'm
 pretty happy about being able to keep the losses low.  If anyone did order
 and did not receive their CD or a response I recommend E-mailing/calling
 (getting in touch) so we can work things out.  I kept all the LETTERS and
 noted the date I mailed each CD.  Surprisingly it seems as if all mail with
 cashed reached me--and there was quite a bit (probably close to $400+).

 WHAT IS AFTER ESCAPE

 A few days ago I was sitting back, listening to ESCAPE and thinking what I
 could do with all that extra cash I had netted.  I figured investing it in
 a HD for HORNET--which has been discussed on a few occasions with the sys
 admin--but he told me he was going to attempt to free up some extra space
 so another hard drive really was not necessary.  Also mentioned was the
 fact that the UNIVERSITY could eliminate the FTP site anytime they wanted.
 Save/keep your money was the conclusion.  So, while other people
 (parents/coworkers/friends/etc) feel I should be profiting I shake my head
 and attempt to explain the "freeware" concept and how it is not right to
 profit in this field--no one understands.  Though it is a ton of work I
 figured I would see if Christopher wanted to do a ANOTHER CD that would be
 CHEAPER and BETTER--thus a place to reinvest the "scenes" money :)

 After you ESCAPE you become FREE.  A logical choice for the SEQUEL to
 ESCAPE! Like Escape we will need help for this next production.  We will
 try to use many of the original Escapees for FREE but we can also use the
 help from others.  We promise multiple CD's for those who end up helping
 and a ton of inserts for those who end up helping with graphics/art--free
 of course.

 Graphics & Art:  I am very impressed by the art coming out of Assembly and
 the Party '94.  My likes lean toward hand drawn stuff--bodies, animation,
 graffiti, etc.  Full color and B/W images can be used plus art for the CD
 itself (2 color).  The higher the resolution the better.  If you can help
 or know someone who can please contact us.

 Printing:  We plan on going with another printer.  Anyone know a good place
 that can run 1000 inserts (4/1 and 4/0) for under $500?

 Distribution:  Interested in distributing.  We could use some help.

 Suggestions:  We have a good idea of what will be put on the CD and we
 welcome ideas, comments, and suggestions to make the CD more marketable.

_____DemoWorld Takes Expansion

 The DemoWorld project is going one step ahead and will expand with the
 addition of The Raver, an HTML lounge for DemoFreaks.  You will find on
 this site very special features and some quite interesting services such as
 a homepage list where users can add their own homepage as well as links to
 the hottest demo happenings on the net.

 The first main feature will be a link with the NAID Homepage.

 Expect also an official online Hornet report on NAID to be posted there
 shortly after the party itself.

 The Raver will be online as well as DemoWorld Revision 2 as of Monday, Feb.
 20th.  Check it out via DemoWorld.
	
   ftp://ftp.eng.ufl.edu/demos/dw/dw.html or
   ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/msdos/demos/dw/dw.html

 (the latter is a faster, mirror site.  Actually, we recommend connecting
 through any of Hornet's mirror site, since they are faster and have higher
 user limits.)

_____Administrative Re-organization

 Many of you have noticed that HORNET is staring to become very active.
 With so many projects, there must come a division of labor.  Below, I list
 all individuals working _for_ or _with_ HORNET:

 <Demo Maintainer>

  Christopher G. Mann               I am in charge of producing DemoNews and
  r3cgm@dax.cc.uakron.edu           handling the messy administrative stuff
                                    at HORNET as well as coordinating the
                                    current task forces.

 <SubDemo Maintainers>

  Jeff (White Noise)                Jeff is in charge of all World Wide Web
  jeff@ego.psych.mcgill.ca          related material and the organization of
                                    the DemoWorld project (of which DemoNews
                                    is a part). He also handles public
                                    relations and general mail received at
                                    HORNET.

  GraveDigger                       GraveDigger is in charge of all music
  digger@freeside.scsd.k12.ny.us    files at HORNET.  This includes moving
                                    new uploads and deleting old files.  He
                                    also is heading up the "Reviews" task
                                    force.  All music-related questions
                                    should be directed to him.

_____The Snowman Week in Review

 Many of you have written me and said that a lot of our articles have
 nothing do with the demo scene.  This one is no exception.  But I'm taking
 several hours a week to produce this thing so you're just going to have to
 suffer through some rambling. :)  If you don't care, then just skip to the
 next article.

 This was a mixed week as far as positive and negative things happening.

 One of the things I am most excited about is the interview with Jackie
 (see related article this issue).  Its not often that oppurtunities like
 this come up, so I try to take advantage of them while they last.

 If Jason Nunn is correct, the Music Contest 3 intro is really going to look
 good!  We are still having difficulty sending files to each other, so I
 have not seen a beta yet.

 One thing came out of my discussion with Jason that I feel should
 publically noted.  I feel very strongly about _not_ having any pictures of
 females in HORNET-related productions.  In Europe it may be more acceptable
 than in the USA, but I feel that if we are to gain female participation in
 the demo scene, such pictures only make women uncomfortable and more
 unwilling to be active in the scene.  HORNET, pioneering the politically
 correct and moral development of demos. :)

 I am growing concerned about the Genesis demo.  Tom keeps telling me that
 we are very short on time (which is true).  However, I still think that we
 can pull this project off without a hitch (as they say in the USA).

 The re-organization of HORNET people is something that needed done for a
 long time, and I'm glad to finally have it written down.  The information
 is open to changes, but at least its there for reference now.

 Ryan Cramer has become very attached to school.  This is something I should
 try to do more myself.  However, with Ryan's academics comes a resultant
 loss to DemoNews and HORNET.  GraveDigger is now heading up all
 music-related stuff here and I have full confidence in his ability.
 BTW: I just learned that Ryan won't be coming to NAID. :(

 Mellow-D is cool!  This week, he has several contributions to DemoNews.
 While I don't personally agree with him on everything, he has the guts to
 say what is on his mind and I respect that a lot.  In addition to his
 opinions, he is (IMO) one of the best musicians in the demo scene.  There
 are about 6-7 of his songs that I listen to regularly.  If he keeps this
 up, he will definately be my _favorite_ musician.  Although I havn't told
 him this yet, I am hoping to involve him more in HORNET activities in the
 future.

 Academically, this was a poor week for me.  For the first time in two
 semesters, I could not figure out how to complete one of my computer
 science labs.  In addition, I've spent _way_ too much time with the demo
 scene and my grades suffered.  A lot has been accomplished for HORNET and
 next week, school should go better.

 I am now dating again!  Heather is a very nice woman I met in school, and
 we are starting to see each other regularly.  She has already completed
 Calculus 3 so she's way ahead of me in math.  However, she can't stand
 computers.  This is something I must help her appreciate.  :)  After all,
 you can't have the Demo Maintainer at HORNET with a girlfriend who won't
 sit through Second Reality...

_____Epidemic Eratta

 A little something for everyone who misinterpreted Epidemic - people still
 think I am in Orange.  It was Syntax's simple little mistake, and I am not,
 nor were EVER, a member of Orange, atleast as of now.  The only people from
 ex-Sonic who are in it, are Cybelius and Dune.  (Check out Dune's music in
 Project X-Y-Z).  Sonic is still technically alive, I believe the current
 members are JaZ, FTJ, RanX, Phantom.

_____Interview with Jackie Smith

 Jackie Smith is a musician in the demo scene.  She lives in Baltimore in
 the United States of America, and is in the group Threesome.  What is
 unusual about Jackie is that I have to refer to her with the word "she" as
 opposed to the word "he".

 In the last issue of DemoNews, I announced that I would be giving away free
 Music Contest ]I[ disks at the NAID demo party.  One response was from
 Jackie.  After confirming her gender, I decided that it would be rather
 unprecedented for HORNET to do an interview with one of the few women
 involved in demo making.

 Jackie is on the way up in the music scene.  While she still has yet to
 make a big name for herself, I believe that she has the drive to succeed.
 She was refreshing to talk to, and I think you will enjoy this interview.

 MS = Jackie Smith (Miss Saigon) / Threesome ...... jsmith@UBmail.ubalt.edu
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 [start of interview : 12:01 EST]

 CG : Jackie, just for the record, can you give your name, rank, serial
      number, etc?

 MS : Well, I guess by that you mean my handle, group name, etc.  My handle
      is Miss Saigon, and I'm a member of an extremely little known group
      called Threesome.

 CG : What are the current members of the groups, their roles, and where
      does the group originate from?

 MS : Well, we have two coders, Moby Disk, and Kneebiter.  I do music
      mostly, but I also come up with some ideas for routines.  Kneebiter
      may be doing some music as well.  Except for Kneebiter (who is at
      college in Pittsburgh) we're all from Baltimore, Maryland, USA.

      I'd also like to say hello to a few people:  My mom (who got me
      interested in computers), The Veritech Knight, Moby Disk, Kneebiter
      and Future Crew (I know you guys are still out there somewhere).

 CG : How old are you and what has led you to enter the musical aspect of
      the scene?

 MS : I'm 17.  I guess I got interested in music from hearing lots of mods by
      many talented people.  I thought it was a neat idea and I decided to
      give it a try. My very first attempts at music were pretty pitiful.
      :)

 CG : It is highly unusual for a female to be in the demo scene.  What about
      you has led to your participation?

 MS : Well, it seems like there are very few females in the scene.
      Personally, I took an interest in demos when my ex-boyfriend showed a
      few to me.  I've always been interested in computers, and it was
      amazing to see what could be done with technology.

 CG : Was your ex-boyfriend a member of the demo scene or just someone who
      got ahold of a few demos?

 MS : Well, I'm not sure really.  He and his friend formed a group, but to
      my knowledge, they haven't released anything.  Mostly, he was just a
      demo fan.

 CG : How do you feel that your gender has influenced your music?

 MS : I really don't think gender has much to do with it, really.  Music has
      always been an interest for me, so I wasn't even considering gender
      when I started composing.

 CG : Why do you think there _are_ so very few women in the demo scene?

 MS : I'm not really sure.  The best explanation I've come up with is that
      there are fewer women than men who are interested in computers, math,
      science, etc. And because a majority of females don't spend much time
      around these things,they don't have a chance to become interested in
      things like demos or mods or whatever.

 CG : That certainly sounds plausible.  Do you think that this lack of
      interest in computers is genetic or pressure from society?

 MS : I think it's mostly societal.  I think women are genetically just as
      well adapted to working with computers as men are, but society has the
      attitude that women aren't "supposed" to like computers and math, etc.

 CG : When we talk about society, I have to think we are referring to
      American society.  In my entire experience, I have run into only 2
      women in the demo scene, both from the United States.  Do you feel
      that European countries place even greater social restrictions on
      females not be interested in computers/math?

 MS : No, I don't think so at all.  In fact, I read about several women in
      the European scene. And if I didn't misread the invitation, I think
      The Party ]I[ was organized by women.

 CG : What advantage would The Party 3 gain by having it organized by women?
      Do you think that all of the males in the scene would think "Oh, good
      political correctness." and not "Yeah, women!"?

 MS : Well, I can't speak for any of the males in the scene, but the fact
      that the organizers were female shouldn't make an incredible
      difference in terms of people's attitudes.  I personally think it's
      great to see other women in the scene, but really gender shouldn't be
      a huge issue.

 CG : At many parties (especially the Assembly parties) many of the graphics
      entries have explicit portraits of women in compromising positions.
      How does this make you feel?

 MS : Well, pretty much anything can be justified as art.  There was a big
      discussion on this topic a while back on comp.sys.ibm.pc.demos.  A lot
      of people believed that explicit portrayals of anyone, male or
      female, really had no place in the demo scene.  I tend to agree. There
      is a fine line between art involving nudity (many classical paintings
      involved nude figures) and (for lack of a better work) tacky pictures.
      Personally, I'm not much affected by the artwork, but I would think
      that many women would feel offended and demeaned by it.

 CG : Understandably so.  In the male-dominated scene, there is a large
      portion that are very young.  How do you think this affects their
      outlook on women (and women in the scene)?

 MS : Well, I hate to make generalizations.  In some cases, I guess it would
      really have little effect at all.  In other cases, I guess boys will
      be boys. :)

 CG : :)  The members of the demo scene are a relatively small portion of
      the world population.  Because of this, it would be very difficult to
      have the demo scene change society to encourage women to participate.
      As such, what steps do you think we can make personally to encourage
      more activity from the female gender?

 MS : Well, you're right that society can't be changed.  I'm not really sure
      what we, as individuals, could do to encourage more women to
      participate in the demo scene.  I think the interest in technology has
      to be there to begin with, so I'm not sure how much we could do
      anyway.

 CG : Do you personally feel that you should try to encourage other women to
      participate?

 MS : :)  I try to encourage practically everybody to take an interest in
      the demo scene.  I'm sure all of my friends are sick to death of
      hearing me talk about NAID, and Future Crew, and FastTracker, and
      mods, and Skaven.  :)

 CG : Speaking of NAID, will you and/or your group be attending?

 MS : Yes, we will.

 CG : Speaking of Threesome, could you do a little bit of shameless
      promotion for it?

 MS : Well, right now, we're pretty much unknown, but we're hoping that will
      change at NAID.

 CG : On a very non-demo related point, I have been trying to decide what to
      wear to NAID and what impression I want to give to anyone.  What style
      of clothing do you think you'll wear?

 MS : Well, actually I've already pretty much planned what I'm taking to
      NAID.  :) I'm taking a few fractal tee-shirts, my Assembly 94
      tee-shirt, and jeans/shorts.

 CG : I find that I get uncomfortable when women wear tee-shirts with
      information on them, because I think that they think I'm just finding
      an excuse....

 MS : hehe... yes, when you're actually reading their shirt.  :)

 CG : Exactly.  :)  I would suppose that, given the demo scene audience, you
      will likely attract a lot of attention.  Just for the record (and for
      all the guys out there), is Jackie seeing someone?

 MS : I was wondering if this would be asked.  :)  No, I'm not seeing
      anyone.

 CG : Well, NAID would be a _great_ place to pick up guys, although I
      suppose it would be fairly difficult to continue a relationship from a
      few states away..

 MS : :)  I can just see my mailbox flooded with e-mail.  Hey, who knows.  A
      famous person (don't remember his name) once said that the best love
      affairs are conducted by post.

 CG : That's an odd quote <raised eyebrow>.  If we continue on this topic, I
      have a feeling that the readers of DemoNews will really get a kick out
      of it. Do you object?

 MS : Well... I don't mind.

 CG : Do you think you'll be a flirt at NAID?

 MS : Probably.  :)

 CG : Well, I think that Necros is taken, but I'm sure Hadji would be happy
      to be flirted with.  :)

 MS : Hehe... of course.  Well, I guess we'll see when I get to NAID.  ;)

 CG : NAID is going to be an incredible party!  Is your group planning on
      competing in any of the divisions?

 MS : Well, I'm not allowed to speak for the group (they made me take a vow
      of silence), but I'm planning to enter the music compo, although I
      really don't think I stand a chance if Necros is planning on entering.

 CG : Well, I hear he likes to get drunk on Molsen, so let's hope he does
      some last minute editing to his song.  In your impression, why did I
      ask you to do an interview today?

 MS : Well, actually, I was wondering that myself.  I consider myself pretty
      much a nobody (so far) in the big scheme of things. I guess maybe you
      asked to interview me because a girl in the demo scene is kind of a
      novelty.

 CG : Good word choice.  :)  Do you agree that a female working in a demo
      group is unusual?

 MS : It is right now.

 CG : ...and that a group with a female is a pioneering sort of thing?

 MS : Hmm.... in a way they are.  I never really thought about it, because
      our group got together because we all liked demos, Moby Disk and
      Kneebiter could code, and I could write music.  We didn't really set
      off with the intention of making a breakthrough in the demo scene
      social structure.  :)

 CG : ...and that HORNET qualifies now as a full-fledged demo group?

 MS : Yes, HORNET would qualify as a group.

 CG : ...and that it would be a real feather in our cap to say that we have
      one of the few female members of the scene contributing to DemoNews
      and the group?

 MS : oh boy... *blush*  I think I see where this is going.

 CG : Jackie, would you consider becoming an active member of HORNET (not
      abandoning your Threesome group)?

 MS : um..... could I have some time to think about this?

 CG : Sure, but you'll keep the readers of DemoNews in suspense....

 MS : I just don't know how useful I could be.  I'd love to be a part of
      DemoNews, but when I think about all the work that goes into it, and
      wonder where the information comes from, I feel pretty clueless.  :)

 CG : Until you first wrote me, I think that I have neglected females in the
      demo scene.  With your appearance, I saw the opportunity to have them
      become more active through increased exposure.  DemoNews is a great
      platform for this. I feel that it would be a great means of improving
      the demo community with a respectable female group member in HORNET.
      The job would not be a difficult one, just enough at first to make the
      female presence felt at HORNET.

 MS : Wait, where do you get the idea that I'm respectable?  :)  (kidding) I
      don't know.  I would love to give it a try, but I don't know how
      successful I'd be.

 CG : I know that my mother would be very impressed if I could say that we
      have a female in our group.  Now how can you say no to that?  :)

 MS : Well, I guess it wouldn't hurt to give it a try.

 CG : So this means your answer is "yes", at least on a trial basis?

 MS : Yes.

 CG : I thought you didn't like yes/no answers.  :)

 MS : I don't.  I feel like I'm being cross-examined in court or something.
      :)

 CG : Cool!  At this interview draws to a close, we have a new member of
      HORNET, and perhaps the most novel of all of us. (using your word)

 MS : Well, just as long as I wasn't selected solely on the novelty of being
      a girl in the demo scene.  If I get something, I want it to be based
      on merit, not on the fact that I'm a girl. Would I have been offered a
      position if I were a guy?


 CG : Let me clarify.  Your successful standing in the music aspect of the
      scene still has yet to be determined.  Your standing as a female is
      not in question.  As such, you are different in some way than the
      majority of the scene.  Currently, I feel that the scene has a lot to
      gain through acceptance of females as active and productive members of
      a group. Am I sounding completely out of line?

 MS : No.  That clarifies things a lot.  I guess it's kind of like being a
      representative for the interests of females in the demo scene. I have
      no problem with that.

 CG : Good.  I just feel that for the time being, acceptance of women as
      legitimate scene members is more important than individual female
      success. As Spock would say "The good of the many over the good of the
      few"  :)

 MS : Very logical.  :)

_____Mellow-D's Bi-Weekly Report

 Have you noticed how there's all these new (and old, sure, why not)
 musicgroups?  It seems like no-one can get into anything but a large, brand
 new - lame - musicgroup.  Coders are beginning to dissappear, there are
 less and less graphicians, but yet musicians galore!

 Far as I see it, all this started with Maelcum.  Blame him for everything!
 When KFMF (formerly KLF) got good thru Necros and Basehead, everyone wanted
 to be another Necros, or a new "better" KFMF.

 There is, however, one thing, that all of these groups _are_. - ALL the
 music groups whose files pass through me at mpoli.fi, have a long, "eleet"
 description filled with those oh-so-glorious IBM chars that simply fuck up
 us ISO-users.  They contain stuff from author to music classification as
 precisely as "Electric Danceable Techno Ballad" or something as
 imaginative.  But, when you're eleet, you're really gotta be DAMN eleet.

 Music isn't really enjoyment anymore, but fame.  Yeah, you gotta know - if
 you're a musician and want to be respected for your MUSIC - forget it.  You
 gotta do techno, dance, or guitar music.  You won't only be respected, but
 people will worship you and bow to you (like some Polish people did to
 Purple Motion at Assembly'94)!   Welp, that's the American way of life.
 What else could American demo people contribute to the scene, but their
 culture?

 I must fully agree with Mellow-D on one thing.  The readers of DemoNews
 must do more to contribute.  We can only do so much you know.  :)

 In the future, I will try to increase our coverage of the coding scene. For
 the most part, our magazine caters mostly to general or music-related
 readers.  But as a coder myself, I would like to read more programming
 tips.

 Sorry, no can do.  :)  If we have people that contribute these types of
 articles, I'm gonna print them.  But I appeal to you DemoNews readers out
 there.  You want an issue that's 3k big!? :)

 Now _this_ is an idea I can work with.  In the next few weeks, I'll check
 into setting up a chart system for HORNET.  This would be pretty cool I
 think.

 While your point is a valid and good one, it is beyond my current ability
 to produce two seperate newsletters.  Its all I can do to get this one done.

 It isn't.  :)  We only have 3 people who have direct access to HORNET now.
 Myself, Jeff, and GraveDigger.  The official system administrators at the
 University of Florida have advised against allowing many people to have
 access to the site.

 This probably is the best idea.  GraveDigger?  Jeff?  Either of you want
 to tackle this?

_____Tracking Tips #1 (Adding Echo Effects)

 This is the first in a series of articles on tips for PC music composers. 
 It will be a regular weekly feature for as long as I have something new to
 contribute to it. Right now, I have six sections scratched out, so you can 
 expect to see this feature for at least the next six weeks. After that time, 
 if no new articles have been written, the series will be ended. (Suggestions 
 for future articles would be greatly appreciated!)

 The concepts for this column have been derived from viewing others' tracks,
 along with my personal experimentations. I do not take sole credit for any 
 of the ideas presented here, and would also like to thank the many musicians 
 who have influenced me along the way (it would take forever to name them all).
 
 This first column will cover the aspect of using echo effects to create a 
 more lively tune. Echo can be a very effective way to add depth and dimension 
 to your music, making it more natural-sounding, while removing a dull, two-
 dimensional sound.
 
 In these columns, I will use examples which will be similar to what you would 
 see if you were tracking in FC's Scream Tracker 3. If you are not familiar 
 with ST3, please refer to the basic guide below:

 ... .. .. ...
 123 4^ 5^ 67^

 1 - The note               (A, B, C, D, E, F, G)
 2 - Accidental             (# if sharp, - if natural)
 3 - The octave             (0 - 7)
 4 - The instrument number  (01 - 99)
 5 - The note's volume      (0 - 64, default used if none specified)
 6 - Effect symbol          (See the ST3 docs)
 7 - Effect parameter       (See the ST3 docs)

 An example row for one channel would be:

 C-4 01 32 ...

 This would play instrument 01 at a volume of 32, on the note C in the 4th
 octave, with no effect.

 Now, moving on, what you basically do with echo effects is re-sound the note
 you want echoed, in a lower row in the pattern, and at a reduced volume. 
 Depending on the length of the sample and the speed/tempo of the song, you 
 may want to put the echo notes in a separate channel so it does not cut off 
 the previous note.
 
 If you want the note echoed once, you should sound it at half of its original
 volume. How many rows down into the pattern you place it is basically up to
 you, and you may want to experiment to see what generates the best effect for
 your music. Here is a pair of examples:

 |  Channel 1  |  Channel 2  |                 |  Channel 1  |  Channel 2  |
 |             |             |                 |             |             |
 |C-4 01 64 ...|... .. .. ...|                 |C-4 01 48 ...|... .. .. ...|
 |... .. .. ...|C-4 01 32 ...|                 |... .. .. ...|... .. .. ...|
 |... .. .. ...|... .. .. ...|                 |... .. .. ...|C-4 01 24 ...|

 In both examples, the volume of the intended echo note is half of the 
 original. In the first example, a short delay is created by skipping one row 
 in the pattern. In the second example, a longer delay is created by skipping
 two rows. 

 This is just a basic example, and by experimenting some with it, you will be
 able to create a nice echo effect which will give your tune a bigger sound.

 Next week's column will cover a technique called "Octave Doubling."

 I hope these tips are helpful to you. As I stated above, they are not my
 techniques, I have learned them from others and merely added some of my 
 thoughts in hopes that it would be helpful to some of the readers. Feel free
 to email me if you have any questions or comments!

_____The NAID Convoy!

 Hay there everyone out in Demo Land! I have a proposition to make for
 anyone living on the East coast of the US and plans on driving to NAID..

 I live in Columbia, Maryland in the U.S. Columbia is about 25 minutes South
 of Baltimore and about 50 minutes North of Washington, D.C. Interstate 95
 (which goes all the way up and down the East coast) is about a five minute
 drive from where I live. If I goto NAID, this is the road I plan to take up
 'til about mid-state New York state.

 I HOPE to be going to NAID, if I get some supporters for my scheme, here,
 I'll most *definitely* be going.

 What I'd like to do is to organize a convoy on the East coast going up
 twords Quebec. As we would progress up twords NAID, we would join with
 other people on the way up there. I came up the the "East Coast NAID
 Convoy". I thought it was kinda creative. :-) When taking into account the
 time it takes to get there (which, in my case, is about 12 hrs.) and,
 potentially, the amount of people that might participate, the biggest
 obstacle would be organizing the effort.

 As soon as I get a few supporters/recruits/volunteers, I'll start to make
 advanced plans. If anyone has some ideas feel free to let me know. About
 the only "extra" item I can foresee that everyone would need would be a CB
 radio. Face it, if we're to meet up with people and proceed hundreds of
 miles North to another country, we NEED to be in contact. A basic CB and
 antenna would run you about $60 if you can't borrow one.

 If you are at ALL interested PLEASE E-mail me and LET ME KNOW!! And PLEASE
 HURRY! I'm not sure how big an operation this could become, so we need all
 the time we can get!

_____A New Demo WWW Site

 Hello demo freaks!

 I am putting together a World Wide Web site online that is dedicated to the
 demoscene.  It is still under construction, but most of the links and infos
 are there already.

 It contains:

 * Demogroups:  Links to most, if not all, demogroups on the internet who
   have WWW pages.  I will most likely expand this to include a list of
   email contact addresses for others.  (Note:  If you belong to a group
   that would like to put a page online, I have the space to put one online
   for you, so long as the text/graphics don't take up too much room.)

 * FTP Sites:  Links to demo FTP sites (Hornet of course, plus most (all?)
   of their mirrors.. and a quick guide to the various areas it offers)

 * General:  Links to the various pages on the web I have found that offer
   guides describing what exactly a demo is, what it includes, how it is
   made, where to find them, etc.. These include Trixter's page(s) and
   Abyss/FC's.

 * Music:  Links to music groups (KFMF, previously KLF) online and other
   music pages, FTP sites, musicians' pages, and pages pertaining to regular
   (non-tracked) music groups/bands.

 * Graphics:  Some very cool links to some excellent and *amazing* graphics
   pages I have found.  This includes regular computer art, raytracing, VR,
   humor, and the like.

 * Programming:  Links to programming pages and the best programming FTP
   sites I have come across.  If you are looking for graphics/sound
   programming sources, take a look at these!

 * Newsgroups:  List of newgroups that may be of interest.

 The URL --> http://mind.net/xethyr/demos/

 I am still working on these pages, but I would very much appreciate your
 feedback.  I can be reached at <xethyr@mind.net>; please leave me a note!

_____How to Get 'em

 After reading this issue of DemoNews, you may be wondering how you can get
 previous ones.  Well fear not!  There are two different ways to do so:

 1: FTP to hornet.eng.ufl.edu and go to /pub/msdos/demos/news/OLD_NEWS and
    start downloading anything you see.

 2: Now you can request back issues of DemoNews via e-mail.  Start a letter
    to listserver@oliver.sun.ac.za (any subject line) and in the body of the
    letter include "get demuan-list <index>" where INDEX refers to the
    index number of the issue.

    For example:  get demuan-list 55

    This would retrieve DemoNews #80

    For more recent issues that are split into multiple parts, you must send
    an individual request for each index number.

 The past couple of weeks, I have been trying to help a friend configure
 Display 1.87 (.gif/.jpg viewer).  With all of the different video cards,
 resolutions, remapped mode setting interrupts, etc. it is very difficult to
 get everything fine tuned.

 It reminds me of a quote I am quite fond of:

  "The great thing about standards are that there are so many to choose from"

 And IT became SO,
