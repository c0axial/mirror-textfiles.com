=---------------------------------------------------[Introduction]--[Snowman]-=

 Hello all, and welcome to DemoNews issue 108.

 You know, it's kind of fun getting to write these introductions each week.
 They usually generate about 10 e-mail responses each.  I'd be curious to
 know if anyone out there has noticed any change in my writing style over
 the past year.  Oh well... on to more interesting matters.

 Wired '95 was recently held and most of the productions are online, with
 one notable exception; Valhalla's first place demo.  I was told by Darkness
 of Imphobia that (according to the rules), Valhalla has exactly one month
 to release it or the compo version will be uploaded by the Wired
 organizers.  Let's hope we don't have to wait that long.

 I'd like to take a second and say that the subscriber information at the
 top of this newsletter is a bit misleading.  If you notice, we are at about
 the same number of subscribers that we were last issue.  However, we have
 picked up over 40 new subscribers in the past week.  How can this be?
 Well, we also lost over 40 subscribers.  Whenever one of those notification
 messages comes out saying "This is just to verify that you are subscribed
 to DemoNews", about 30-40 people usually decide to unsubscribe.  Everything
 seems to balance out though.

 There is good news in the ftp.cdrom.com automation department.  I have
 successfully been building a Perl library of functions and variables that
 will help us to review and move files more quickly.  With the help of
 Diablo (who has also written a considerable amount of code) you should see
 files being moved out of /incoming much faster.  :)

 I'd like to take a second to thank Thor Teague.  A couple of weeks ago, he
 sent me an audio CD containing songs he wrote in Scream Tracker 3.  Its
 always nice to see one of our own making a name for him/herself outside the
 scene.

 This week I promised a review of The Party 1994 CD.  Well, you ain't gonna
 get it.  :)  There is simply a large backlog of articles and I can only
 squeeze a finite number of them in each issue.  Hopefully next issue I can
 get in a review of both TP94 and Freedom CDs.

 Not that this has any bearing on the scene, but I am going to start
 co-operative education at the end of the year.  Co-opping is simply a
 work/study system designed by the university to give us computer junkies
 some real-world experience before we get out of college.  The only reason I
 even mention this is because I may be drastically relocating (and perhaps
 changing e-mail addresses).  Stay tuned for exciting developments!  :)

 Can't think of anything else interesting for this introduction, so I'll
 call it a wrap.  Enjoy the articles, enjoy the ratings, and send this poor
 college student some food.

=-------------------------------------------------------------[One Fan]--[GD]-=

 What is the point of writing and releasing music, graphics, or demos? Why do
 people spend countless hours creating something just for the "fun" of it?

 Basehead put this mystery in perspective during a recent interview: "to a
 certain extent you do it for fun, but there's also the idea of wanting other
 people to like it." Thus, there are a vast number of demos and music
 available on the net, either on assorted FTP sites, or through DCC over IRC,
 just waiting to be noticed.

 How do they get there, though? They don't just randomly appear. A fisherman
 is trying to catch you, baiting his hook and casting his line to where you
 will see it. Once he reels you in, you are a victim of his ego construction.

 Do some people push their work too much? For example, perhaps they don't get
 enough satisfaction from just uploading their files to an FTP site and
 waiting for others to find it. True enough, its plenty easy to get one's
 upload lost among the countless others. As a result, they feel the need to
 advertise.

 IRC provides a good way to transfer files, for those that want to engage in
 such a practice. By sending a few commands on IRC, one user can copy a file
 another user. There are even IRC scripts to automate a file request system,
 where a user can enter a command to request a file from another user.

 Sometimes, a person may be especially eager to get their files noticed. They
 may mislabel it, send it to someone who doesn't request it, or constantly let
 others know that their file is available for the taking. Unfortunately, such
 actions break certain generally-observed "netiquette" guidelines, and this
 can cause a disruption between users. Not a good idea when the object of
 one's game is to get some positive recognition.

 Occasionally, someone will put a label on a particular work of art. This
 label may take the form of an adjective, such as "awesome," "mediocre," and
 even "horrible." Depending on how much weight others give to the person's
 opinion who placed this label, the effects of that particular labeling could
 be devastating, or have no effects at all.

 People often deny it, but everyone else's opinion is more important to them
 than their own opinion is. Anyone can be self-biased, but it takes talent to
 impress others.

 Unfortunately, there are some people who fail to see the correct ways to get
 someone's attention. I, nor no one I know, do not have a particular knack for
 taking time out of what I am doing to talk to someone who has been pestering
 about this-and-that. Remember, if you want to sell something, be sure to put
 it in the right package.

=----------------------------------[VGA Hardware Tricks, Part 2/6]--[Trixter]-=

 _____Introduction

 Welcome to VGA Hardware Tricks, a six-part series written by
 Trixter/Hornet.  In this series, I'll be exploring ways you can push VGA
 harder to achieve new effects.  The emphasis of this series is twofold:

   - The techniques discussed will work on any *standard* VGA card.
   (No SVGA or VESA video cards are necessary, but these techniques
   will work on those cards as well.)

   - The techniques discussed require very little calculation, so
   they will work on slower computers.  (Some techniques, however,
   requires a lot of CPU *attention*, which means that while the
   effects are happening, they can't be disturbed by other
   calculations, etc.  Good Assembler programmers might be able to
   get around this, however.)

 This series is for intermediate to advanced coders, so there are a couple
 of prerequisites you should meet:  Example code will be given in assembler
 and Pascal, so familiarity with those languages will be helpful when
 looking at the example code; also, a familiarity with Mode X (unchained
 VGA) is required, as procedures like changing video resolutions will be
 discussed.

 This series covers six topics:

   - Crossfading 16-color pictures
   - Crossfading 256-color pictures    (this article)
   - More than 256 colors: 12-bit color
   - More than 256 colors: 18-bit color
   - Copper effects in text mode
   - Displaying graphics in text mode

 _____Overview

 As covered in the first installment of this series, Crossfading is a clever
 effect that, to my knowledge, was displayed first in an EMF demo in 1991.
 Fading in/out a palette had been used extensively until then, but
 crossfading was much more impressive.  For anyone who's never seen
 crossfading, it works just like crossfades do in movies or television: A
 picture on the screen gradually fades into another picture until only the
 second picture is displayed.

 However, as we discovered last time, there's no easy way to cross-fade
 pictures with more bits that, when combined, exceed 8 (the same amount of
 bits in a single 256-color pixel).  What if you want to crossfade pictures
 with all 256 colors?  You can't fit 16 bits of information into 8!

 One of the solutions (the one we'll be covering in this article) uses
 probably the most timing-dependant of all the tricks we'll be covering:
 Page flipping.  Page flipping itself isn't time dependant, but when you
 have to change the entire palette every page flip, you'll find that you are
 paying very close attention to the state of VGA's vertical retrace.  :-)

 Crossfading 256 color pictures is done in a very brute-force way.  To
 understand it, let's look at first how to display *both* pictures at the
 same time:

   - Switch into ModeX
   - Load one picture onto the first video page
   - Load the second picture onto the second video page
   - Enter a loop:
       - Switch to the first video page
       - Load/Display the first picture's palette
       - Switch to the second video page
       - Load/Display the second picture's palette
   - End loop when key is pressed

 This will display both pictures at the same time (although not very
 nicely).  To crossfade, you can start the second picture's palette at all
 black; then (while flipping pages) lower the first palette to black and the
 second picture's palette from black to itself.  If your programming skills
 are good and you have a fast machine, you can pull this off without any
 assembler programming.  (To make this work on a slow machine, we'll have to
 simulate a vertical-retrace interrupt, which I'll define later).

 If you stopped reading this article right now and did what I just
 described, what do you think you'd see?  Well, unless your monitor is a
 piece of crap, you'd see a great deal of flickering.  This is because your
 refresh rate in 320x200 mode, 70 Hz, is *halved* by trying to display two
 pictures at the same time, bringing it down to 35 Hz (your display is
 displaying a picture, then black, then a picture, then black, etc.)

 If we want to avoid inducing epileptic seizures, we'll have to do something
 different.  For this particular method, we'll try the crossfading with a
 raster.

 Let's look at a pseudocode example:

 1. Set the video mode to 320x400.

 2. Load the first picture into video memory so that the pixels are set
    with raster... like this:

    x x x x
     x x x x
    x x x x
     x x x x

    So every other pixel in picture is "halved".
    Use video page 0.

 3. Load the second picture into the opposite raster, like this:

     x x x x
    x x x x
     x x x x
    x x x x

    Use video page 1.

 4. Set palette correctly for the first picture, and set page 0 as visual.
 5. Wait for vertical retrace.
 6. Set palette to totally black and page 1 as visual.
 7. Wait for vertical retrace.

 8. Repeat from number four until you want to start fading.

 9. a=0
 10. Set palette for first picture faded (100-a)% towards black,
     visual page 0.
 11. Vertical retrace.
 12. Palette for second picture faded a% towards the correct palette,
     visual page 1.
 13. Vertical retrace.
 14. Increase a until it reaches 100.

 15. Voila, you're done.

 This method fools our persistence of vision (how our brain "fills in"
 missing visual information) significantly enough to reduce the flicker that
 we mentioned before, but still has one very bad drawback: the picture's
 colors are dimmed to 25% from the original because half of the time you're
 flipping pages, you're displaying a color pixel, then a totally black one,
 then color, then black, etc.  With bright colors or white, the flicker is
 extremely bad.  So, how to combat that?

 Instead of swapping between a color and a black pixel, swap between a color
 and a "shadow" pixel that tries to resemble the color one. There's not
 enough palette entries to make a color "shadow" picture (it would take
 anywhere from 48-64 palette entries, which steals away from the 256 colors
 in the picture), but since our eyes are more sensitive to light, we can
 create a 16-element grayscale picture and still have 240 colors left over
 for the picture.  Not a bad compromise.  (So, you can see that I lied a
 bit--we're crossfading 240-color pictures, not 256-color pictures.)

 HOWEVER, this adds a third problem:  When flipping between a color and a
 gray pixel, the colors are now *lightened* by about 25%.  The brightness of
 the colors (the "luminance") is back to normal, but it looks like all the
 colors are "washed out".  So, to combat this, we pre-process all the
 pictures in a batch image conversion program like Paint Shop Pro, raising
 the color saturation (the color "strength") by about 75%.

 Implement the above system and you might get an unpleasant surprise: Your
 video card is too slow to switch video pages *and* update all 256 colors of
 the palette every frame.  This is seen as bad flickering.

 If there was only some way we could start our processing *right before* the
 beam goes into vertical retrace... Well, older video cards (notably EGA)
 used IRQ 2 as the vertical-retrace interrupt:  When IRQ 2 "fired", you knew
 you were in vertical retrace, and you could attach any routine to that
 interrupt to run some code.  This was convenient because you could be doing
 other things (like normal game calculations) and you didn't have to worry
 about missing the retrace, and subsequently, screwing up your
 animation/palette/whatever.

 Later video cards (like VGA), sadly, discontinued this interrupt.  In order
 to do the same thing (have code executed automatically when vertical
 retrace happens), we'll have to simulate that interrupt ourself.  Provided
 in the code example (see below) is code to simulate a vertical retrace
 interrupt, the use of which allows us to make our crossfading technique
 work even on slow video cards and slow machines. (The actual method of
 simulating a vertical-retrace interrupt will not be covered here; it is
 beyond the scope of this article; and, admittedly, beyond the scope of this
 programmer.  :-)

 _____Code

 Code that achieves this effect is available on ftp.cdrom.com in the
 directory /pub/demos/hornet/demonews/vgahard in the file vgahard2.zip. To
 compile the code directly, you'll need Turbo Pascal 7.0 or later. (The code
 can be compiled on earlier compilers as well, but some slight modification
 might be necessary).

 _____Notes

 While the idea for crossfading 256-color pictures was mine, none of it
 would have been possible without Jussi Lahdenniemi / Virtual Visions.
 Without his ideas on how to fix the flickering and his vertical retrace
 interrupt code, it would not have become a reality.  Thanks, Jussi!

 _____Conclusion

 I think we've taken crossfading to it's maximum extent without using a ton
 of real-time CPU calculation for the effect.  But we've discovered
 something very interesting, haven't we?  By flipping between pages quickly,
 persistence of vision (how our brain "fills in" missing visual information)
 can be fooled into not seeing flicker--do you think it can be tricked into
 seeing more colors as well?

 Guess what: It can!  The next two installments in VGA Hardware Tricks cover
 displaying pictures with much more than 256 colors--on a *standard* VGA
 card.  Don't miss it!

 _____Introduction

 Hello and welcome back to the 4DOS 4DEMOS training series.  Today we will
 be looking at the SELECT statement, basic-level function calls, and
 reusable directory variables.  I have enough material for at least 11 of
 these tutorials so there still is a lot of neato stuff left to learn.

 _____General Overview

 This article assumes you have read Parts 1 through 4.  Be sure to follow
 all of the steps I listed there.  We will be relying on them now.  Just for
 reference, here is a list of what we have covered so far (and what we will
 cover today):

   Part 1  (DemoNews.091) - Overview of 4DOS
                            How to get started
   Part 2  (DemoNews.093) - Made SET_ENVS.BAT for environmental variables
                            Made SET_COLS.BAT for color-coded files
   Part 3  (DemoNews.095) - Renamed .BAT files to .BTM to speed things up
                            Made SET_PATH.BTM for PATH and CDPATH variables
                            Made ALIAS.LST for basic-level aliases
   Part 4  (DemoNews.103) - Added to SET_ENVS.BTM for executable extensions
                            Added to ALIAS.LST for intermediate-level aliases
   Part 5  (DemoNews.108) - Discussed the basic SELECT statement
                            Discussed basic-level function calls
                            Added to SET_ENVS.BTM for reusable directory vars

 _____The SELECT Statement

 In a nutshell, the SELECT statement lists files on the screen and lets you
 perform a given action on them.  When you run SELECT, you are given a
 highlight bar with which you can tag any number of files.  This could mean
 displaying all .S3Ms (tagging 3 or 4 of them) and running Capamod,
 displaying all .ASM files and running TASM on them, etc.

 You remember in Part 4 how we set up the executable extensions?  Man, they
 come in handy now.  Rather than saying "show me all .S3Ms and run Capamod
 on them", you can just say "show me all .S3Ms and execute them!"  Your
 default player would automatically kick in and start to work.

 Here is an example SELECT statement:

   SELECT C:\DOS\EDIT.COM (*.TXT)

 This would show me a list of all .txt files in the current directory,
 allow me to select one or more (by tagging with the spacebar), and then
 run DOS's edit program on them.

 Let's say I selected the files MYFILE1.TXT and MYFILE2.TXT.  The
 statement would be expanded to:

   C:\DOS\EDIT.COM MYFILE1.TXT
   C:\DOS\EDIT.COM MYFILE2.TXT

 So in this case the edit program is called twice, each with a different
 file name. But what if I wanted to send the names of _both_ text files at
 the same time?

   SELECT C:\DOS\EDIT.COM [*.TXT]

 Notice that the [] brackets are used instead of the () parenthesis. This
 would be expanded to:

   C:\DOS\EDIT.COM MYFILE1.TXT MYFILE2.TXT

 OK, that is it for the basics.  Now it is time for fun!  Let's put this
 baby to work.

 Here are a few personal aliases in my ALIAS.LST file:

   @@Alt-e = SELECT /a:-d /o:en C:\UTILS\Q.EXE [*.*]

   This requires a bit of explanation.  The "/a:-d" simply means that I
   don't want directories displayed along with files.  The "/o:en" means to
   order the files displayed first by extension, then by name. A full list
   of SELECT parameters is available, just type "HELP SELECT".

   So when I type "Alt-e", all of the files in the current directory are
   displayed and I can select one or more and run Qedit (a text editor) on
   them.  Think of it, if the file I wanted to edit was the first in the
   directory, I would need only 3 keystrokes to edit it (Alt-e, enter)! This
   is speed and efficiency!  Just envision the lamers typing out the entire
   command at the dos prompt.

   @@Alt-s = SELECT /o:en (*.*)

   This is a rather simple alias.  When I type "Alt-s", all of the files
   in the current directory are displayed and I can run a whole bunch of
   programs simultaneously.

   Say I wanted to run HELLO.EXE and GOODBYE.EXE right after each other.
   Yes, it might just be easier to use that filename expansion thing with
   the tab, but what if I can't remember the name of the files and they
   scrolled of the screen when I typed dir?  OK, so I'm lazy, but this
   command is quicker than several other alternatives I have tried.

   @@Alt-2 = SELECT (c:\songs\s3m\*.s3m)

   OK, this is a really groovy alias.  I type "Alt-2" and a list of all
   the .S3Ms I have online pops up.  I tag a few, hit enter, and off goes
   Capamod pumping out the tunage.  Since I already defined the executable
   extension for .S3M, I don't even need to specify a calling program in
   this SELECT!  Now that is slick.

 We will be returning to SELECT later on in this edition and showing you how
 to make your statements more portable.

 _____Basic-Level Function Calls

 4DOS provides a wonderful set of built-in function calls.  By calling
 a function, you can obtain information about different parts of your
 computer or a file.

 For example, if you were to type %@DOSMEM[k] at your prompt, you might get
 something back like "Invalid command or filename '596'."  That doesn't look
 very promising, does it?  But notice that the '596' happens to be the exact
 number of k base memory you have.  4DOS can tell a lot about your system,
 so use the information wisely.

 Function calls are a little tricky when it comes to syntax.  However, we
 are only going to going over the basics so this should not be overwhelming.

 Say you were to put this same function call in your prompt.  Blammo!  Now
 your prompt automatically displays how much memory you have free at all
 times.  Here is a neato basic prompt you can put in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

   PROMPT %@DOSMEM[k]k base, %@EMS[k]k ems, %@XMS[k]k xms, $p$g

 Now your prompt might look something like:

   612k base, 0k ems, 7164k xms, c:\demonews\4dos>

 A full list of the function calls available is provided in the 4DOS help.
 We will be returning to this topic much more in future editions of these
 tutorials.  In the meantime, play and experiment.

 _____Reusable Directory Variables

 By now you may notice that we are using directory path names in quite a few
 things (executable extensions, aliases, select statements, etc.).  So what
 happens if I decide to move all of my .S3Ms from C:\SONGS\S3M to
 C:\MUSIC\SONGS\S3M?  Now I have to go back and change everything that
 referred to that old path!  That, my friend, would suck.

 Most of you reading this know a programming language of some sort.  And
 don't your teachers tell you to avoid global variables?  They say it is bad
 programming practice and they are correct (to a certain extent).  However,
 if you want to keep using 4DOS with greater functionality, it is _critical_
 that you set up some global variables for your system.

 This isn't a very difficult thing to do and will allow you to change your
 system quickly and easily.  This is much easier to show than to explain, so
 I'll give some examples.  Let us add another line to SET_ENVS.BTM:

   SET DIRPLAY=C:\MUSIC\PLAYERS

 We have now set up the variable "DIRPLAY".  It contains the directory where
 all of my song players are contained.  This variable is usable just about
 everywhere.

 We can now add two more variables:

   SET DIRCMOD=%DIRPLAY\CMOD225
   SET DIRCP=%DIRPLAY\CP15

 So now we have variables for CapaMod and Cubic Player that are in _terms_
 of our original DIRPLAY variable.  If we decide to change the directory
 where our players are at, we do not have to update either of these new
 variables.  Now let us put these variables to work.

 We can change our executable extension for .S3Ms from:

   SET .S3M=C:\MUSIC\PLAYERS\CMOD225\CS3MTSR.EXE

 to:

   SET .S3M=%DIRCMOD\CS3MTSR.EXE

 Earlier (back when we were talking about the SELECT statement), I said
 that we would be talking about how to make things more portable.  So
 why don't we do a:

   SET DIRS3M=C:\SONGS\S3M

 and change the alias from:

   @@Alt-2 = SELECT (C:\SONGS\S3M\*.S3M)

 to:

   @@Alt-2 = SELECT (%DIRS3M\*.S3M)

 I'm sure that you can see the advantage to this sort of system.  If we
 ever have to change the directory for any type of file, we change _one_
 single variable and the change cascades to all the rest of our system.

 Though it really depends on your own system, I would recommend setting
 up variables for song, player, tracker, compiler, graphic display, and
 utility directories.  Use these new variables whenever you make a new
 alias and your life will be much easier.

 _____Conclusion

 In the next edition of this series, we will talk about how to DESCRIB your
 files, combine all of those yucky SET_XXXX.BTM files into one solid file,
 and discuss substituted drives.

 And remember, 4DOS 4EVER!
