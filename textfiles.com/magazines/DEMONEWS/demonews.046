*************
GENERAL STUFF
*************

I could not be as thorough this week due to the OVERLOAD of files that
were uploaded.  Some, like the /bizarre stuff will stay for a few weeks
while others I could not get to this week will be move next week.

WHERE TO LOOK FOR DEMOS:

If you want a recent demo check the /incoming directory.  If you believe
the demo was uploaded within the last couple weeks check /alpha/NEW and
if you think the demo is kind of old (>month) then go ahead and check
the /alpha/"letter" directory.  Easy enough.  Trust me, if it ain't here
(internet wise) it ain't anywhere.  You can ARCHIE till your fingers turn
blue.  BTW:  All of the demo sites are mirrored off wasp and only "luth.se"
mirrors the incoming directory.

ONCE AGAIN:

The TOP25DL file is currently using stats from the last week of APRIL.
It will continue to do this till the "wasp" site has been fully upgraded
or the sys admins have decided to start creating a "syslog" again.  Maybe
in a week, maybe in a month this will be fixed.

REVIEW DEMOS:

If you are interested in reviewing demos--- ;)  let us know.  Mike is
bogged down doing them and I have enough trouble moving things around and
keeping the .TXT files up to date.  The UTIL directory .TXT file is still
a mess but everything seems to be "up to date."

Hi all, thats me again :)) and again some probs ;) 
so here we go:

  * ICEFEVER by XPOSE - seems it doesn't work with GUS properly. Also, in
    file_id.diz there is written, that this demo req. a 486, but it works
    fine on a 386 (btw: I don't like demos which require powerfull machines
    just because the code is rather slow (I don't mean CD2, there is a great
    code and entertainment)). PS: It hangs without GUS on my computer. ;)
  * OUTTA TIME by SELECT - if you hear a terrible sound from the PC speaker
    on your machine - that's because they have problem with keyboard handler
    (1st bit on port 61 - enable speaker). To disable the sound from speaker
    type and run following sequence in Turbo Debuger:
       mov al, 0F3
       out 43, al
       mov al, 1
       out 42, al
       xor al, al
       out 42, al  ... it sets sound up to 1MHz - unhearable by human ;)
                       (and not playable by pc-speaker ;)
  * SUPER UNKNOWN by FIVE AND THE SOME - in most cases you'll need 486 to run
    it. This demo req. 386 w/copro, but it doesn't run with it either :))
    Seems like there is a problem in their speed-detecting routine (maybe).
    Also, if you want sounds on GUS, you have to install UMB server (like
    Qemm or so), with at least 41kb free for ultramid driver.

        Got to make this quick.  Very rushed on time.  This week, I want
you to all download mc2demo.arj in /pub/msdos/demos/incoming.  This is
the demo for Music Contest ][.  None of the files below have I gotten a
chance to look at.  I'll do that soon.  Until next time, ciao!

Sink or Swim.  If you have anything you want to add just send it to us
and we will try to get it in the following week.  This newsletter reaches
150+ people excluding bounces.  I am not sure how many demo groups this
