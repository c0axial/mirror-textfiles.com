 "HORNET" is the name of an FTP site on the internet.  It is a place where
 people upload and download files.  However, HORNET has grown much larger
 since it was first created 2.5 years ago by Dan Wright.  Now HORNET
 releases a weekly newsletter called DemoNews, and is starting to offer other
 services.  HORNET specializes in the "demo scene", and files that are re-
 lated to demos, coding, music, or graphics are welcome.

Comments by Snowman
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This is just a miscellaneous collection of things I have to say about this
 week:

 - DemoNews subscribers are way up
 - Krystall turned 19 on December 2nd (krystall@biko.llc.org)
 - Trixter's WEDTRO was released this week (I like it, and its unprecented)
 - Lots of cool interviews coming up later (Maxwood, AcmE, Purple Motion)
 - I released updated parts 1 and 2 of Denthor's Demo Coding Tutorial.
      It is my hope to have all 16 parts converted to C++ by mid-February.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
History of HORNET (Dan Wright)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 In order to do a "complete" history of this demo site it is necessary to
 step back in time.  The year...1985, Christmas time.

 I opened my presents Christmas day to discover a C-128, disk drive, printer,
 and monitor amongst some other odds n' ends.  At the time I was in the 10th
 grade and had wanted some kind of computer--a Commodore, Atari, or Apple.  I
 actually preferred the Atari and Apple because I knew people I could get
 software from unlike the unpopular Commodore.  I do not recall discovering
 demos until late 1986 or early 1987 but do remember a demo called "DNC
 Megademo" with all kinds of music and vertical scrolling in the boarders.
 Something clicked...I had discovered a very interesting part of the computer
 scene.  I did a few C-64 demos with a little help and even produced a "demo
 disk" of my demos and my computer history.  Suffice to say it is a long
 story and I won't get into it for this article.

 College came around in 1988 and I actually managed to get a lot of use out
 of my C-128.  Collecting demos and producing demos was quite difficult and
 pretty much ended in 1990 at which time I retired my C-128 at my parents
 house and started using a REAL computer for reports & such--an Apple
 Macintosh.

 I did not start learning the "PC" until I took a class called "Introduction
 to Computer Software" which was still considered a technical credit for my
 major--Electrical Engineering.  The time was January 1992--about the time
 they actually started making a decent PC (386/486).  The "PC" class
 introduced me to some POWERFUL machines--x86 and 286 IBM's with CGA & VGA.
 Considering we only worked with DOS, Word Perfect, Lotus, and dBase it
 really did not matter how bad the machine was...so long as it would boot.
 The "PC" class was quite easy for me considering I did all the work, read
 all the books and enjoyed working with computers.  I ended up with about a
 99.3% (out of 100%) grade in the class--missed about 2 questions on one
 test.  The funny thing about this was I did not have the HIGHEST grade--
 being a little bit arrogant and a very hard worker I could not imagine how
 ANYONE got a better average but a couple people (out of about 200) did.

 That same Spring I saw my first PC intro--Fishtro by Future Crew.  This was
 quite a jump from the C-64 demos I was use to.  Once again I became hooked
 and began a quest to find more productions of this caliber.

 The Summer of 1992 I took a "C" programming class offered for the 1st time
 by the college of Electrical Engineering.  The excellent part about the
 class was not the programming (though fun) but getting a UNIX account which
 had INTERNET access.  So, in 1992 I learned the basics of the PC, C
 programming, and how to navigate the internet among other things.

 So now, we are all caught up.  Well, at least to the Summer of 1992 when the
 first signs of the demosite became a reality.

 My internet, archie, and my quest for demos became quite an undertaking that
 Summer/Fall.  I became so good at archie I could find ANYTHING--including
 software pirate sites--because I knew WHAT to search for and HOW to search.
 Of course the downgrade (there is no such thing as an upgrade) in software
 now gives us no HITS and no CONTROL C for breaking and displaying hits so it
 has made life a little more difficult for those adventurous souls out there.

 Searching for demos lead me to a few productions--ultraforce vectdemo,
 coldcut--but I did noticed most "demo" hits on archie dealt with GAME demos.
 Because there was not central site getting new productions became a matter
 of luck.

 Fall came and a friend of mine told me our ENGINEERING account (sioux.eel.
 ufl.edu) had its own ftp site.  Excellent I figured...and even better when I
 found out I have FULL write/read/delete access--but so did everyone else. On
 this same site under the /pub directory there was the infamous 9 space
 directory which contained pirated software of course.  Funny I thought...a
 pirate site in existence at our university...how convenient.  I wanted a
 central DEMO site BAD and I though about putting it in the /pub directory of
 our site for over a week.  Unfortunately the 9space directory remained and I
 was not going to delete it cause I was not an administrator and it was not
 my problem.  What the hell I figured, no time better then the present; I
 created a directory called "real-demos" off the /pub structure and included
 a few demos--fishtro, unreal, etc.

 I'm not sure how I first got the word out but perhaps the 9 space dir
 brought a few people into the "real-demos" directory to read my message.
 Within a couple weeks the "unofficial demo site" had a few more files and
 nothing, not even the 9 space directory, was being deleted.

 Now all I needed was to get the word out--but how?  Welp, I had recently
 discovered the USENET so, why not post to the "...pc.games"  The message I
 posted on September 4, 1992 is as FOLLOWS:

 "I am trying to create a UNIFIED DEMO sight[sic] where people can PUT and
 GET DEMOS --and I am not referring to those crap game demos....[this last
 statement is probably what nailed me] So, if you are interested in demos or
 have demos you would like others to see get them from or put them at the
 following: 128.227.56.139 It is my hopes that this can become THE place
 where one can go to find the newest/best demos!  Spread the word!"

 As you can see I never mentioned the directory--bad news--and I posted it on
 the ...pc.games section of the newsreader.

 This posting drew many people.  I am also sure lots went within the 9 space
 directory as well as my real-demos directory.  Somehow, someway, higher
 people from my university discovered this directory-- the 9 space directory.
 They captured the post on the newsreader (how do you think I have a copy?),
 and matched up that post with the name in the real-demos directory.
 Amazingly they were the same.

 Their concern was with the 9 space directory on their computer.  My concern
 was with only my real-demos directory.  Anyways, shit hit the fan, I was
 called into some meeting and sure enough the demos directory and the 9 space
 directory were to be deleted.  You live and you learn and sometimes others
 will also learn from your mistakes if you inform them.

 For those interested the meeting discussed the 9 space directory and its
 contents and how I was associated with such.  Words were exchanged and a
 form of "threat" was actually mentioned--i.e. next time the law will be
 involved.  I was lucky enough get out of the meeting without any actions
 taken against me--or anyone else to my knowledge.

 Luckily, by posting the message on the newsreader I drew someone who wanted
 to mirror the site--datta@cs.uwp.edu.  By doing such he saved the demo site.
 I then directed people to this new site and everything worked out well.  The
 only problem was the transfer rate at the site was very slow for me so I
 (and others) wanted to get a mirror.  After mailing many messages I tried
 another local account (to the University I attend).  I mailed the system
 operator of wasp.eng.ufl.edu in November to ask about having a mirror for
 this site.  I would maintain the site and all would run smoothly.  Sure
 enough, after about a month I had my mirror.  And the rest, as they say, is
 history...but not quite.

 I graduated College Spring 1993 and turned the site over to a new
 maintainer--Rob Shady--on Easter Sunday if memory serves me correct. Rob
 held the maintainer position for about 6 months.  He started off really
 aggressive but unfortunately he let the work pile up too much and sure
 enough the site slipped into a piece of shit...mainly unorganized.  I guess
 Rob did not realize the work that had to be put in to keep things up to
 date.  Actually it is not a lot of time unless you let the work pile
 up--which everyone eventually seems to let happen.

 I asked Rob about the site during the FALL and we both agreed that it would
 be best for him to step down.  A few new people came on board along with me
 (again) and helped get the site to a more manageable position. Eventually
 the two new people vanished or dwindled to doing zip and it was back to just
 me again--ugh.  Mike came on board (OCT?) and has helped quite a bit with
 reviewing demos among doing some coding and fixing a few problems.  So, it
 was just Mike and I for awhile.

 In January Snowman (Christopher) expressed an interest in helping with the
 music part of the site.  I agreed and Snowman took over the music section of
 this site which has eventually led to him now being the maintainer.

 ABOVE AND BEYOND

 Those who have been visiting this site and reading this newsletter remember
 the "TOP25DL" list we use to compile each week.  Unfortunately, on the
 switchover for new FTP software, this list--generated from the ftp.syslog--
 stopped.  Mostly because of the ftp.syslog being > than 10Megs and not being
 reset each week.  So, unless they Sysadmin has a say the TOP25 list probably
 won't be back.

 Most of you probably know or knew I was able to form the Toxic Zombies back
 in 1992 because of the people I met being a maintainer.  We produced one
 intro--UNDEAD--and I helped with a diskmag called MAYHEM.  The Toxic Zombies
 are still out there...we are just doing are own thing.

 Snowman's MC2 on CD and my idea of a DEMO CD eventually let to ESCAPE.  We
 discussed and agreed upon the project in April '94 and finished Oct '94 with
 the CD being released on November 18th.  For those that do not know ESCAPE
 is a DEMO (190megs) and MUSIC (MC2 entries and 47mins of Audio) CD.  ESCAPE
 was done by people in the DEMO scene for the DEMO scene and those interested
 in demos.  Less then 450 of these CD's will be pressed--EVER.  To date 300
 CD's have been pressed and approximately 175 have been paid for and
 distributed.  If demand is great enough we can repress up to 150 more,
 however, no promises are being made about doing a repress at this time.

 I rescued this site once--good or bad--but do not plan on doing it again. It
 is my hopes that Snowman along with the crew he hand picked--except for
 maybe a couple--can manage, and continue to manage this site till it goes
 away (taken away) or it is passed along again.

 SOME UNKNOWN PEOPLE

 Most people who have not read back issues of the DEMONEWS have no idea of
 this sites history so I hope this brief article helps.  A few important
 people helped realize this site and the good and bad that surround it.

 David Datta -- Maintainer of ftp.uwp.edu.  Mirrored the original "sioux"
                demo site so there would always be an INTERNET DEMO SITE.
 Ron D.      -- Help bring about the comp.sys.ibm.pc.demos newsgroup.
 esj         -- Allow us to have this eng.ufl.edu demo site.
 Dan Wright  -- Creator/Maintainer of the Demo site 92-94.

 EVERYTHING MUST GO

 I think that does it for this "COMPLETE" history.  I do not want to draw it
 out any longer or get in to to much detail.  Many thanks to all those who
 have helped me and the other maintainers.  See ya around.

 Sometimes I wonder...what if I had never gotten that C-128 that Christmas?

 Wonder why,

Partyline (TP4, NAID, IBM-Warp)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This article wasn't as long or extensive as I would have liked, but here are
a few tidbits from 3 upcoming parties.

[The Party 94]

 "WHERE & WHEN
   The  Party 1994 will be held in Scandinavia's largest conference centre.
   The  centre is of course placed in Herning in the middle of Denmark. The
   Party  will  be  held from Tuesday 27 December at 10:00 CET to Friday 30
   December at 10:00 CET."

 Just today (December 3) I got hold of the official TP4_INV invitation.  The
 coding was done by Dust, and the music by Zodiak.  Its a very nice
 production and encourage all of you to download it.

 There are a couple of comments I have:

 First, I had heard a rumor that the Amiga and PC sections of the party were
 going to be held in seperate locations because of tensions last year.  This
 does not appear to be the case.

 Second, I was surprised at the money offered for prizes.  I won't say more,
 but compare between this party and NAID (a much smaller-scale party):

   PC Demo:     PC Intro:    Gfx Compo:  Music Compo:  Multich. Music Compo:
   -----------  -----------  ----------  ------------  ---------------------
   1. $1000     1. $500      1. $500     1. $500       1. $500 + GUS Max

 "The contributions will be assembled to a CD-ROM. All Prize-winners  will
 get royalties by granting exclusive distribution rights  to  the  CD-ROM
 media."

 Has anyone seen that ASM94 CD-ROM yet?

 "The  demo  will be shown on a standard 486 DX/2-66 MHz, 4 MB RAM, VL-BUS
 VGA card with Soundblaster Pro II or Gravis Ultra Sound  (1 MB)  and  no
 other cards. However the demo should be able to run on a standard 386 DX
 40Mhz PC."

 Well, what if it CAN'T on a 386DX-40?  Is it disqualified?

 "We will not accept any ... spraycans, weapons or firework."

 Wait a second.  I thought this party was supposed to be FUN!?  :)

[NAID - North American International Demo Festival]

 "NAID will be held at Edouard-Montpetit College in Longueuil, 15 minutes
 from the well known city of Montreal, in the province of Quebec, Canada.
 The event will last 2 days, Saturday the 15th of april from 9am
 until 9pm Sunday the 16th."

         Prizes:         Demo    Intro    Music   Graphic

         1st place      1000$     500$     300$      300$
         2nd place       600$     350$     200$      200$
         3rd place       300$     200$     100$      100$
                        =====    =====     ====      ====
                        1900$    1050$     600$      600$   =  4150$

 I (Christopher) will definately be attending this party.  I plan to
 compete in ALL competitions if I can.

[IBM OS/2 Warp(*) Demo Competition]

   "Future Crew & Accession in connection with IBM Finland are proud to
  invite you to participate in a new competition: the IBM OS/2 Warp Demo
  competition."

 Sorry, but I don't have anything else to add to this article, I'm out of
 time.

 May 10, 1992 was an important day.  That afternoon, at 3:03PM to be more
 precise, I paid $239.99 for a Sound Blaster Pro card at Electronics Boutique
 in New Philadelphia, Ohio.

 Now, you may be wondering how I remembered this so precisely.  As it
 happened, I stuck the sales receipt in my pocket, thinking that someday it
 might be nice to look at again.  Just last night I was dusting off some old
 souvenirs and ran across this receipt.  Although its been over two and half
 years ago, I realize now that it was the single most important purchase I
 have made in my adult life.

 That soundcard, in its funny little way, introduced me to the demo scene.

 On January 8, 1994 I contacted Dan Wright at the ftp site ftp.eng.ufl.edu.
 I had been using this site to get the latest demos and music, and it seemed
 that the music section could use some reorganization.  Dan told me that many
 other people had come to him the past and offered to help out.
 Unfortunately, they left soon after when found out how much work it was.

 For the next year, I worked at making HORNET a better site.  With the help
 of the Escape CD and Music Contest ][, HORNET gradually gained interest in
 the demo scene.  Well, MC2 is over, the Escape CD is out, and Dan Wright has
 left.  This was quite disheartening to me and I spent a great deal of time
 contemplating how to keep interest in HORNET.  DemoNews was the answer.

 One of the first decisions I made after becoming coordinator of HORNET was
 to get some other people to contribute articles for DemoNews.  Ryan Cramer
 and Grant Smith were two people I had a lot of confidence in, and they are
 making quite an impact here in their respective areas.  With 14 people
 currently helping out HORNET and DemoNews, things are looking up.

 A few things indicate that DemoNews is doing very well.  First, there are
 some really neat FILE_ID.DIZs that have been created solely for
 the purpose of spreading this newsletter on BBS's.  Second, the number of
 subscribers is way up, having jumped up more than 50 this week alone.
 Third, and most importantly, the readers of DemoNews frequently give me
 positive feedback.

 In the past two weeks, I have received e-mail from Maxwood/Majic 12,
 Zodiak/Cascada, and several large demo groups.  DemoNews is having
 interviews with Skaven, Necros, Purple Motion, and Basehead.  Imphobia has
 even offered to do some work for DemoNews.  A short while ago, I would have
 laughed if you told me that HORNET and DemoNews would receive this much
 attention.

 Well it took a long time, but now I finally have the chance to associate
 with everyone I've admired over the years.  Much of my Saturdays is taken
 up with putting DemoNews together.  When I go to sleep on Saturday nights,
 I have this little grin on my face, thinking about the e-mail I'll get
 come Sunday morn.

 This is my Demo Dream come true!

 _| \_|\___|\___|_|  \___/____/   Interview: Necros [Legend Design/KLF/iCE]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 You may recall from last weeks interview with Skaven of Future Crew that
 the only person he greeted was Necros. He said:  "...and I'd like to greet
 Necros, atleast. He has what it needs. His songs have rhythm, tension,
 perfected structure..." And he's absolutely right! While Necros is fairly
 new to the demo/music scene, he has really taken it by storm. Necros
 probably has more musical knowledge than anybody that I know in the scene,
 and his music really shows it. I think that many people (especially us IRC
 folks) would agree that Necros's music is some of the best stuff ever
 produced in the PC music scene. Currently, Necros's music hasn't been used
 in any large scale demos, but now that he has recently joined Legend Design,
 I can't wait to see what happens!

 I used to see Necros spouting off all sorts of chord progressions and chord
 layering techniques on IRC. The stuff that he was saying is amazing! He
 has really done his homework in music theory. When you see him apply all
 of these concepts into his music, the end result is spectacular. However,
 his music is a LOT more than just a bunch of music theory. Necros's music
 has a lot of feeling and overall power to it. I think the best way to
 describe it would be that its very emotion evoking.

 Awhile back, Necros released a groundbreaking music disk called "Digital
 Psychosis". If you have not already heard it, you will definitly want to
 check it out. Necros also is in charge of "Dissonance", the PC music scene
 magazine. His credits also include music for the Epidemic music disk and a
 number of excellent individual releases. Necros is definitly one of the
 most admired and respected musicians in the scene, I'm very pleased
 that we were able to do this interview!

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 [start of interview: December 1st, 1994, 7:00pm]

 RC: What is your current occupation (student, etc), and how old are
     you? Where are you located?

 NE: Well right now I'm 19 years of age, study at the State University of
     New York at Stony Brook (major in comp sci/philosophy).. I live in
     New York State, and for that reason don't know too many Finnish demo
     people personally. :>

 RC: What is your musical background?

 NE: I've played piano/keyboards for about 10 years or so, but only
     started tracking around March 1993.. so i guess i'm a newcomer to
     tracking, but not to music in general (having a musical theory
     background helps out the tracking a LOT).

 RC: What music would you say your most influenced by? (musicians,
     groups, etc), tracked and recorded...

 NE: Umm well i listen to a lot of diverse styles.. in real life some of
     my favorite groups would have to be REM, Sting (very big influence),
     Rush, the Cure, and also a lot of jazz/classical/techno stuff too.
     It's good to listen to a lot of random styles to get yourself open to
     new ideas. As far as tracker music goes, well it's a bit more
     difficult to pin down specific people but a few of my favorites are
     Skaven (nice nice big sound), Purple Motion (siner ecstasy), Mellow-D
     (k-rad drums), and a lot of other people as well.. I like stuff that
     doesn't stick to formulas (i.e. hard tracker techno and shit like
     that)...

 RC: Sounds like you've really got a lot of influences. I've noticed
     that you can track just about any style of music, which is really a
     good skill. What is your favorite style of music to compose?

 NE: Well originally I loved tracking ANYTHING at all, since I thought
     the tracker was the best thing I'd ever seen on a computer... I love
     demo tunez a lot still, since they boil down to pure songwriting
     (i.e. you can't mask them with fluff). However, nowadays I go for
     more realistic-sounding tunes (i.e. realization and stuff like that).
     The ultimate tune, I think, would be able to convince you that it
     was coming out of a CD player, not out of a sequence of protracker
     commands. :)

 RC: That would be neat, I hope that in the future, tracked music can be
     created with the same quality as commercial music. With technology
     advances, I think that in the future, this will be a reality.

     What ever happened to the Psychic Monks? For awhile, everyone
     thought that PM was going to be the next USA group to take over the
     scene. What happened to the group?

 NE: Ahh PM. Hehe, well the group basically died of side projects.. Likuid
     Krystal is working on his Doom clone, Pelusa is doing DSIK stuff,
     and Oman actually is in Legend Design with me now. :> I regret it
     breaking up, but then again i guess that's the fate of all US groups
     (laugh).

 RC: I know what you mean... :)

     Well, now that you (and Oman) have recently joined Legend Design,
     what plans do you have for the future?

 NE: The future... Well I am VERY busy with school, and only get a couple
     of hours of quality tracking done each week, so it's tough to plan
     anything big. We're trying to get a musicdisk out by the Party 94
     (late December) but my output is shit lately (Quality not Quantity).
     I want to do at least one tune behind a kick-ass demo in my life before
     I quit this scene stuff ... so i guess that's my ultimate aspiration as
     far as the demo scene goes.

 RC: I have no doubt that will be a reality. Legend Design is definitly
     one of the best groups in the scene. Their demo "Warp" I thought
     should have won ASM'94. I can't wait to see what you guys do. There
     is a TON of potential!

     What equipment and software do you use for making music? ...and
     have you gotten yourself a GUS (Gravis Ultrasound) yet? :)
                                ^^^
 NE: Hehehehe I knew you'd ask that. :) No, I am a very very broke guy so
     I haven't spent the 200 bux to get a GUS yet. I've been promised
     ones by many people (ahem) but it never comes through... But anyways
     the equipment I use is mainly leeched. Usually I process/rip samples.
     However when that gets tiring I try to sample a bit on my own. This
     semester I've borrowed some guitars and other equipment from some of my
     friends, so hopefully I can start doing much more original samples...

 RC: One day, about 10 GUSs will show up on your doorstep. All these
     people that have promised you one will finally send 'em, then
     you'll have more then you know what to do with. :) I think its
     amazing what you've done with an SBPro. Now that your in Legend Design
     maybe you could get a GUS from gravis?

 NE: Well I love my sbpro, its static makes me feel warm and fuzzy
     inside. But maybe I'd switch if i got a GUS for free :> I've tried
     to get in touch with John Smith but I've had no luck .. Probably he
     thought i was one of the billion other random people begging for them.

 RC: How do you go about composing a song? What process do you use? I know
     its probably a very complicated process, but give us the simplified
     version.

 NE: Ok the simplified version of how I do a song: start with drums, get a
     beat going, then figure out the major chord changes. Next add
     melody/lead lines... I tend to stick to verse/chorus/verse/chorus/weird
     middle part/chorus/end usually. It's cheesy but it works...

 RC: I know just about everybody has a different way of doing it... :)

 NE: I value a good song structure a lot.. It's not often that I can come
     up with progressions that interest me enough to finish the song..
     well actually it's easier if I use an instrument to play around with
     the changes and such first... It's really hard to get a good riff
     going while working in a tracker..

 RC: That reminds me of what Skaven said last week, about how important
     structure is to him.

 NE: Structure is VERY important... unless you want repetitive mush. :)

 RC: What would you say is your best piece of work (released), and why?

 NE: Ack this is a hard question. My favorite demo-style tunes, I think,
     are the two I released for epidemic (hyper3/introspection), because I
     did those when I was finally feeling fairly proficient with the
     demo-tune style. And they exhibit both nice changes/structure and
     some decent orchestration (and nice transitions too, the chorus in
     hyper still kicks ass). But for realistic-tunes, I've gotta say
     "Realization" is my favorite, even if it is very unfinished. The lead
     guitar and organ just sound SO nice together.. :>

 RC: Yeah, I really liked all of those tunes a lot. The complicated
     melodies with your leads in "Hyper3" just amazed me. I especially
     liked the changes you made for version 3 of that song. :)

     What sort of stuff are you working on now, and how is it different
     from your older work?

 NE: Well all the new stuff is much more realistic-sounding, I'm going
     very 'guitar'-y lately, don't know why (maybe all the alternative
     muzik i listen to these days). The problem though is that all my
     new stuff SCREAMS out for vocals, but it's just not feasible
     because: a) I can't sing, b) The tunez would be like 5 megs :>

 RC: Heheh... well maybe someday... :)

     Whats your favorite beer?

 NE: Umm Molson XXX of course.. But I don't drink beer much lately.. I'm a
     hard liquor kinda guy (look what college does to me).

 RC: Hows your girlfriend doing by the way?

 NE: Well, It's off and on, off and on, she's great but the only problem
     is when you combine a relationship with school with stress with
     finals with other stuff it adds up to no time for tracking (and you
     better believe that I'm not gonna track if I can fool around with my
     girlfriend hehe).

 RC: Is there anybody you'd like to greet or additional things you'd
     like to say?

 NE: Well greets are kinda intrinsically lame but I would like to say
     hi to a few of my good friends in the scene, Peter (Skaven) and
     Jaakko (Mellow-D) and of course my favorite Iguana musician (who
     could that be? :>). And also cheers to all PC musicians... it is
     you who keeps this scene alive. :)

 RC: ...and finally...

 NE: *drum roll*

 RC: Where can we find your music on the net? Whats the best resource?

 NE: Since my hornet dir got deleted (chuckle) you can get stuff
     still from it's old mirror:

     ftp.uwp.edu - /pub/msdos/demos/music/artists/necros/*.*

     Also some of my stuff is floating around on starport and a bunch of
     finnish sites. Eventually I will move all the shit to freedom.wit.com
     but I'm too lazy to upload until I finish this semester. :>

 RC: Thanks for taking the time to do this interview!

 NE: 'Tis no problem... if anyone wants to contact me (please no mailbox
     floods) I can be reached at: asega@libserv1.ic.sunysb.edu

     Until then... keep tracking (or if you can't track, drink) :)

 [end of interview]

 Hope that you enjoyed this weeks interview with Necros. In the future, we
 will be including many interviews with more of the scene's top musicians.
 Stay tuned!

                      Lemmings, Psycho Neurosis - Denthor
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Well, here I am, to deliver the third article for this column.

 Let me begin by telling you the responses of various people to the last two
 articles :

 EzE   : You lucky bastard! How come you always get to do the fun stuff? I
         want to write one!
 Fubar : Shouldn't you be programming right about now?
 GoTH  : I was beginning to doubt it, but maybe you do have a sense of humour
         after all.

 I also got a letter asking me if those conversations I wrote last week
 actually took place. Yep, they did, I wrote them down almost word for word.
 You may blink now.

 So the question remains, what to do this week? Here goes...

 Let me tell you about how we devised the Lemmings section of our demo,
 Psycho Neurosis.

 And so the day came when I was bored. Very, very bored. I was at varsity.
 The varsity had rows and rows of XT's at that time, I was so bored, I
 actually crashed a Physics lecture which GoTH (then Livewire) was taking (a
 doze). Sliding into the seat beside him, I woke him up and tourtured him
 with my presence, and started doodling cartoons on his notepad.

 It was easy to ignore the lecturer.

 We started talking about demo effects (vewy vewy softly), and the
 bored/sadistic part of our minds came to the fore. EzE had told us a few
 weeks before that writing something like lemmings was impossible ... so we
 decided to show him. Firstly we drew pictures of lemmings falling off
 cliffs etc, etc, and I added in the bit where, if they hit the ground they
 splattered and their broken, bleeding corpses were left behind. Physics
 does this to us. We even wrote some psuedocode (our first ever for a demo
 effect!), and wrote the first draft blind on an XT after the lecture. We
 called it the Secret Project and wouldn't let anyone know what we were
 working on.

 A month or so later, when Fubar had joined the group, we got him to draw us
 some lemmings and a background. It turned out rather well, we stuck a
 scrolly at the top, added a bit of an intro and viola! we had a section for
 Psycho Neurosis.

 The way that the code was written was cool, in that we could put in any
 background we wanted and the code would handle it. (Except for the cloud
 ;-)) We could even implement a larger, scrolling background. Eze wrote us
 some happy, lemmingy music for the routine, and we shipped it with
 Neurosis.

 It was quite a hit, people seemed to enjoy it, and we were told more then
 once that we were sick, but in a nice way ;-)

 An important point to note is that the code was not difficult, it was just
 the idea that made it a good effect. The moral of the story? Crash more
 Physics lectures!

 Next week I will be doing an interview with Maxwood / Majic 12, sould be
 fun ;-)

 Byeeee...

       PMODE/W (PMode for Watcom C) review by StarScream of Renaissance
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This is an article about Tran and Daredevil's new PMODE/W (Pmode for
 Watcom C/C++). This new PMODE looks to be a very exciting new product and
 it could be quite groundbreaking for the demoscene! Special thanks to
 StarScream for contributing this article. For more information, be sure
 to check out the advertisement for PMODE/W in the advertisements section
 of DemoNews. -Ryan

 Why Watcom?
 ~~~~~~~~~~~
         Over the past year, a lot of talk has been generated in the demo
 scene about the WATCOM C/C++ compiler.  Almost all of the new games coming
 out for the PC seem to be using it, and with good reason!  WATCOM C has many
 great features to boast; It uses the Protected Mode of the 386 or higher
 processor, and generates highly optimized code which often runs many times
 faster than the code generated by a competing compiler such as Borland.

         The benefits of increased speed are obvious - if one can develop with
 more C and less Assembly but not lose a great deal of speed in the process,
 development time can be greatly reduced.  Many people are even debating
 whether they need to use Assembly anymore!  Although WATCOM C can generate
 fast code, it can not beat an expert Assembly coder, and I have personally
 outwritten it many times with relative ease.  Nevertheless, a lot of game
 authors have been noticing that a slightly slower routine written in WATCOM
 will often do just as well for them as if they had coded the same thing in
 Assembly.  For this reason, many games are being written with WATCOM.

 Protected Mode and Tran's PMODE
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         The Protected Mode of the 386 and higher processors was first put to
 use in the demo scene when Tran wrote the first version of his
 revolutionary DOS extender entitled 'PMODE', and began using it in Renaissance
 productions.  Protected Mode allows programmers a lot more flexibility, ease
 of coding, and lets them access ALL of memory with NO speed loss.  Programs
 which use what is known as Real Mode are limited to the bottom 640k of memory
 and can only access the other x megs on the computer by slowly swapping them
 back and forth.
         Tran's PMODE is probably the standard for DOS extenders in the demo
 scene today.  It has been since its release a few years ago.  Tran has been
 constantly updating it, and from using it I can tell you that it is nearly if
 not 100% bug free now.  In fact, the only drawbacks to using PMODE up until
 now had been that you usually had to code in all Assembly with it because the
 libraries in C didn't work, and that all of the DOS Interrupts had been
 remapped, making it take a little time to learn how to use.  However,
 Daredevil & Tran's new PMODE/W (PMODE for WATCOM!) completely removes these
 drawbacks and adds great new advantages as well as we will see later in the
 review.

 What ISN'T cool about WATCOM C
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         Actually, WATCOM C is VERY cool.  However, it is packaged with an
 extender called DOS4GW, which you may recognize because it pops up an
 annoying little thing telling you that's its name every time you run
 something coded in WATCOM C.  The DOS4GW extender leaves many things to be
 desired, but it also has some nice features.  Together with WATCOM C it's
 allright.
         DOS4GW has two great things about the way it works with WATCOM C.
 First of all, memory is considered as being TOTALLY linear in most cases.
 If you want to access the address 0a0000h, you can without having to change
 that number in any way.  All of the pointers correctly point to their
 respective addresses with no change needed.  The other nice thing is the
 support DOS4GW has for DOS and BIOS Interrupts.  All of these are mapped
 directly to their normal Interrupts, so you can access the Interrupts just
 as if you were coding in Real Mode.  That's nice because you don't have to
 learn anything new!
         Unfortunately, DOS4GW can NOT be used in the demo scene for a few
 reasons which are totally annoying. One of these reasons is its size. DOS4GW
 takes up about 250K on disk!  That's not so cool for an intro or something.
 Another is that it HORDES memory when your program is running - it takes
 about 300k (more i think) of memory AWAY from your program for its own
 personal use!  Finally, it has slow Real Mode/Protected Mode transitions. For
 a timing critical routine, it is totally not accurate enough for use.  These
 are all major problems with the extender that don't seem like they will ever
 be resolved - they are just fundamental flaws in the way it was programmed.

 PMODE/W
 ~~~~~~~
         For the good part of a year now, I have been wishing that I could use
 WATCOM C in things we at Renaissance do for the demo scene.  It would make my
 life much easier and really help me out a lot. Daredevil and I have discussed
 the idea of a using PMODE with a C compiler any times in the past, and at one
 point Tran tried adding partial PMODE support to Borland C.  However, Borland
 turns out to be an extremely buggy compiler (as Tran found out :) and, due to
 the nature of the compiler, the support was not even good enough for it to be
 a useful tool for me.
         Wonderfully, Daredevil and Tran decided to really get down to work a
 couple of months ago and made the decision to make a full blooded PMODE for
 use with WATCOM C.  All that needed to be done was to replace the DOS4GW
 extender with their own new version of PMODE.  However, this proved not to be
 such a simple task.  In fact, at least two other people who I know have tried
 to do the same thing - their versions, although technically they 'work', do
 not allow the same flexibility of coding styles (i.e. the ability to add your
 old Real Mode code/libs into your Protected Mode program) and do not emulate
 many of the features necessary to WATCOM C well enough or at all.

         Tran and Daredevil have written a new and updated version of PMODE
 especially for their system with WATCOM C.  This new version has a bundle of
 great things, one of which is the size!  PMODE/W IS UNDER 8K!  Compare than
 to DOS4GW's whopping almost 300K!  PMODE/W also adds a lot of speed to the
 switching done between Real and Protected Modes.  These are great features,
 but the best feature of all I find to be the fact that it is TOTALLY
 COMPATIBLE with DOS4GW and WATCOM C!  That means that you can add it to your
 code later on even if you decide to develop with DOS4GW to begin with and not
 have to change ANYTHING!  I hear it even runs DOOM and Epic Megagames' ONE
 MUST FALL with no differences except for lots more free memory and that the
 two games run a bit better.

         Here are some of the features listed in the PMODE/W docs:

 ) No external extender required (everything needed to execute is in the EXE).
 ) Small size (less than 8k for the entire extender program).
 ) Low memory overhead.
 ) Does not require ANY extended memory to load OR execute.
 ) No annoying initialization messages.
 ) Fast execution time.
 ) Free for non-commercial use.


        PMODE/W costs $500 USD for use in a commercial or shareware program.
 The professional version of DOS4/G costs around $1000.  I would opt to buy
 PMODE/W in a second because it runs better, gives you memory and will most
 likely pay for itself in disk duplication costs!  It's use is free if you
 want to code any kind of public domain (freeware) software with it, making it
 ideal for demo use.  In fact, this is one place where it really shines - if
 you are thinking of writing a demo I suggest that you use PMODE/W.  It makes
 life so much easier and allows so much flexibility that I've come to see it
 as an indispensible tool.

         There are a few features which I have found in PMODE/W which are not
 listed in the documentation, but I have come to know about both by using it
 and talking to Daredevil.  I will list them here:

 > Full Interrupt support
 > You can STILL use the Watcom debugger!  (yes, a debugger for PMODE!:)
 > You don't need to worry about developing with it in mind.. you can add it
   or take it away at any time
 > Zip sizes become much smaller (great for commercial OR bbs distribution)
 > Speeds up floating point emulation many 100s of percent
 > You can use your old Real Mode code!
 > Code can be loaded into extended/expanded memory!
 > Full setup program which allows configuration of memory usage etc

 There are doubtless many more features I haven't thought of or seen yet, so
 I suggest you try it for yourself and see what else you can come up with. :)
 Anyway, PMODE/W has been like a godsend for me, so I REALLY suggest you try
 it.. it's WELL worth the 50k download! :)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 Using Assembly - Part I - By JsNO   CODING
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I've sent code to a many people around the place.  Unfortunately, many of
 the people I've sent code to do not have the facilities or the knowledge to
 use, understand assembly.  I remember one particular person who told me that
 he badly wanted to switch to assembly coding, but couldn't because he didn't
 know how to implement certain mathematical and logic inferences like he
 could in C.  Well, this section, which will be split over several issues
 will be dedicated to this very topic, but before I jump right into the guts
 of the discussion, I would like to talk about obtaining an assembly compiler
 and the basic structure of the programming model that I use - "TASM ideal
 mode".

 There are many Public Domain assembly compilers available on the net.  I
 haven't used all of them, nor have I investigated most of the modern
 up-to-dated projects. Out of the ones I have used, all of them (and I mean
 all of them), are not even worth my concentration span. In the commercial
 side of things, there are two stable, well founded assembly products.
 MicroSoft Macro Assembler (aka MASM) and Borland Turbo Assembler (aka TASM).

 I've used both of this products. From my personal experience, MASM is an
 absolute piece of shit. I would go as far to say that a brain damaged
 departmental programmer I could have done a better job. The version I
 purchased was MASM 6.1 (Compilation date: January 1993). A duel platform
 compiler, with 32 bit support. When it didn't totally trash my harddisk, the
 compilation time would be between 15 minutes to 2 hours...

 Now, you might think that I'm being crazy here, I don't blame you, so did
 the MicroSoft tech support people, but it was obviously a bugged to the eye
 balls.

 Now, I really don't want this to be a Microsoft bashing session, as it is
 beyond the scope of this text. All I can say here is that Microsoft have a
 big habit of crash testing their low priority, low demand products (this
 isn't the first time I have purchased defective Microsoft software) and as
 result, release bugged, extremely crappy, over rated and overpriced
 software.

 Why do they do this? you may ask. It's probably due to the introduction of
 SDLC development, but quite simply, they are the only ones that can do it
 and get away with it!. I don't know about you, but when you pay $300 for a
 software produce, you expect it to faultlessly work. (BTW/ Microsoft don't
 offer refunds, as I have found out. After 3 disk resends, I demanded my
 money back. I eventually did get a refund from the local suppler, but they
 have yet to get their return.)

 A much better alternative (or rather, the only alternative!) is Borland's
 TASM V4.0. At $125, it can do everything that MASM can do. It has a number
 of modes of operation, which supports both MASM and Ideal mode. It like MASM
 is also a duel platform compiler. The only problem with this product, is
 that it is VERY hard to get.....VERY hard!!!!. If there wasn't any such
 thing as a little entity called ABSA, I most lightly would give you all a
 copy :), because I don't like your chances of getting it. Infact, if you
 rang up the sales personnel at Borland Pacific, they probably wouldn't know
 what it is!!.

 The choice of mode, will be based on your taste. The only difference between
 the three modes supported by TASM is the syntax of directives and precision
 definitions. The reason why I use Ideal mode is because it compiles quicker
 that any other mode, and it is similar to inline assembler of 3GL compilers.
 The directives are also very logical and consistent.

 Now, I will say this here, when you buy the TASM product, chuck the manuals
 in the bin. All they talk about is how good TASM is and how
 similar/dissimilar it is to MASM...pull, pull, pull, tug, tug, tug. With the
 exception of pages 2&3, the TASM manuals tell you absolutely nothing about
 ideal mode or ideal mode programming. There is even no ideal mode examples
 in the distribution. I had to rely on example code on the net and trial and
 error experimentation on how the directives are arranged.

 To an amoeba, the first thing your going to have to know, is the basic
 fundamental components you need to make an assembly program. If you want to
 make a program to run in real mode, then the following essential components
 are needed:

              ; LAME MODE
              ideal
              p386
              model small
              stack 100h

              segment I_am_a_tasmanian 'data'
              ends

              segment i_am_a_newzealander 'code'
              assume cs:i_am_a_newzealander, ds:I_am_a_tasmanian


              start:
                cld
                mov   ax,I_am_a_tasmanian
                mov   ds,ax

              ;  mov   ax,es
              ;  mov   bx,shrink_seg
              ;  sub   bx,ax
              ;  add   bx,2
              ;  mov   ah,4ah
              ;  int   21h

                mov   ax,4c00h
                int   21h
              ends

              ;segment shrink_seg
              ;  db 16 dup(?)
              ;ends

              end start

 Basically, I'm not going to waffle on about this too much, as will go on
 forever. A glance at the above simple program will answer a lot of your
 questions. The header is made up of compiler directives. The "ideal" tells
 the compiler to enter into ideal mode. The "P386", tells the compiler that
 you are using 386 processor instructions.

 To my knowledge, there are certain sub-modes of ideal mode that are case
 sensitive. I Haven't explored this too much, as I have no desire for my code
 to be case dependant. But, if you happen to accidentally enter this mode in
 compile time (say, a procedure or reference is unexplainably unrecognised),
 then it's probably due to this. There are also other funny modes like
 "PxxxP" that allow you to use privileged protected mode instructions. Unless
 your first name is "Tran" or "Adam", the use and understanding of this modes
 is irrelevant.

 A lot of C programmers get confused about the "model" directive. In
 assembly, all it does is set the defaults for the procedure calls. All any
 case, use "small", as you have no problem linking this type in model with
 other code.

 In "small" mode, the compiler assumes all procedures to be "near" called.
 Note that if you intend to link a real-mode module into a Turbo pascal
 program, then your code segment must be called "_TEXT", not "code". Also,
 the model type has no bearing when linking ideal mode code to 3GL's. As long
 as the interface routines are public (which are defined anyway). The stack
 directive just sets the stack size. For nearly all assembly programs in real
 mode, 256 bytes is ample. Note also that even though the "assume" directive
 indicates the main code segment, having the 'code' and 'data' labels missing
 from the segment labels will cause the compiler to trap syntaxes in a sort
 of semi P386-P286 mode.  This is most likely a bug with the compiler, as
 this is totally illogical. Examples of this are the following instructions
 to be legal:

              shl     eax,1
              movzx   eax,[byte ebx+hello]   etc

 and the following instructions to be illegal:

              movzx   eax,[byte eax+hello]
              mov     al,[byte ecx+hello]        etc

 ...where as, all the above instructions are legal under P386 mode, and are
 accepted if the main data and code segments are assigned the "flat" names
 'data' and 'code' respectively.

 The code that has been commented out does the job of shrinking the allocated
 memory by the program to that equalling the size of the code, data and
 stack. This is because MSDOS allocates all available memory when a program
 is EXEC'ed. Therefore, if you use any of the memory management functions,
 these functions will return an error when attempting to allocate memory.
 Doing this releases any unneeded memory that you won't use.

 If you're intending to write a Protected mode program, then *ADVERTISEMENT*
 you're going to have to use *Adam Seychell's * DOS32 * product* number
 10001110011b. And with every DOS32 you buy, you will get a free set of COBOL
 books to the value of 1 cent, and if you ring in the next 2 minutes, you
 will get a ......FREE TEDDY BEAR!! ..ring now, but don't send us any money,
 we'll bill you!, ring now!!!..... ...But seriously (sorry Adam, I couldn't
 help it ;)) , ...I have chosen to use Adam's Dos extender, because I believe
 it's the best. If it was a commercial product, I would buy it. But it isn't
 commercial, it's for free, which should give people an even bigger incentive
 to use it. The construct for a P-mode program in ideal mode is as follows.

              ; P-MODE
              ideal
              p386
              model small

              segment code32 public 'code' use32
              assume cs:code32, ds:code32, fs:code32, gs:code32,
              ss:code32, es:code32
              include "dos32.inc"

              start32:
              ;  call   debug
                cld
                mov    ax,4c00h
                int    21h
              ends
              end

 Don't worry too much about the segment (or rather - "Selector") initiation
 directives. All it does is tell the compiler to generate 32 bit instructions
 and make the segment pubic for linking with Adam's routines. The dos32.inc
 companion file just defines pointers to data and procedures into his code.
 The start pointer is actually located in Adam's code. This code switches the
 computer into protected mode, modifies the DOS system functions. Once all
 this is done, His code then jumps to start32 where our code begins.

 The commented out debug code pointer is an initiation entry point into his
 debugger, which does the job of plugging his debugging code into the
 Interrupt 03. This code kicks in when ever an INT-3 is executed or when the
 user hits ctrl-break... The run-of-the-mill 4c00h is terminates the code.
 This basically switches the CPU back into real-mode and puts everything back
 how it was before your program executed.

 In my personal opinion, I don't really see why you would want to use real
 mode. The only advantage I can see in using it  is if you wanted to debug
 your programs with existing commercial tools.....But, anyhow, for those die
 hard lame-mode freaks, I'll continue to discuss both.

 So now we are ready to actually put code and data into our segments. In next
 issue I will be discussing how we model mathematical algorithm's in
 assembler. I will also be discussing efficiency factors of instructions
 across CPU's. This will aid you in producing to most efficient set of
 instructions you possibly can across 386/486 based machines.

 Well, Until next time...

  PMODE/W v1.01 - Finally A Replacement For DOS/4GW
 ---------------------------------------------------

 PMODE/W is a replacement for DOS/4GW and is fully compatible with
 Watcom C/C+. PMODE/W provides you with a number of advantages over
 DOS/4GW. The following is just a small list of what you can expect:

 - Small Size (Less than 8Kbytes!)
 - Fast Execution Time
 - Low Memory Overhead
 - No Annoying Initialization Messages
 - Self Contained Extender Requires Nothing External To Your EXE
 - Does Not Require ANY Extended Memory To Load OR Execute
 - Minimal Interrupt Latency
 - PMODE/W Programs Can Be Run Under DOS/4GW Without ANY Modifications
 - Free For Non-Commercial Use

 Simply put, PMODE/W has been designed with two things in mind: size and
 speed. PMODE/W undergone rigorous optimization, making it the smallest and
 fastest extender available for Watcom C/C++. PMODE/W does not provide many of
 the frills found in other extenders. It does not provide virtual memory,
 exception trapping, or anything else that could possibly slow down the
 execution of your code. For this reason, we have designed PMODE/W
 specifically with the developer in mind. You can perform all of your
 development and debugging using DOS/4GW if necessary, and then plug PMODE/W
 in for the release version of your program. If at any time you are
 dissatisfied with PMODE/W, you can switch back to DOS/4GW with absolutely no
 hassle whatsoever. PMODE/W has been thoroughly tested with popular programs
 like Doom, Doom ][, and One Must Fall 2097 in order to insure compatibility.
 But don't take our word for it, try it out for yourself today!

 The current version of PMODE/W as of this writing can be found in PMW101.xxx,
 where xxx is some archive extension (ZIP, ARJ, etc.)

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 PMODE/W Is Currently Available From The Following Sources:

 I have had a lot of compliants lately about the removal of ANSI from HORNET.
 Rather than suffer a massive uprising, I would like someone to PLEASE TELL
 ME AN ALTERNATE SITE WHERE ANSI CAN BE FOUND.  If you have any information,
 please send it to r3cgm@dax.cc.uakron.edu.

 The quote for this week comes from "Verses on the Death of Dr. Swift"
 lines 27-34.

                     Dear honest Ned is in the gout,
                  Lies racked with pain, and you without:
                  How patiently you hear him groan!
                  How glad the case is not your own!
                     What poet would not grieve to see
                  His brethren write as well as he?
                  But rather than they should excel,
                  He'd wish his rivals all in hell.
                                    - Jonathan Swift (1667-1745)
