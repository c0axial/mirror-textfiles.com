 <<Reviews>>

''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

 By popular demand, we present some reviews of uploads on HORNET.  This
 section should grow as future issues of DemoNews come out.

 Look for more new upload reviews in the future! Unless I'm busy studying,
 programming, composing, etc..

 The rating scale:

    *      Not worth downloading.
    **     It will leave you bland.
    ***    A worthy effort.
    ****   Hope these guys show up at NAID/ASM'95..
    *****  Required for your demo/music collection.

_____Imphobia #9

 /demos/diskmags/imphob#9.zip (1391k)
 Rating: ****+ (4.5 of 5)

   The Imphobia Diskmag crew has released another issue of their world-
   famous demo-mag as promised, and it's bigger than ever before!  Bigger to
   the tune of 2.8 Mb!  Although most of the graphics the make up the mag
   are identical to issue #8, there are many more articles than the previous
   issue.
 
     - What's New?

       This issue covers the last few parties like The Party IV, Juhla '95,
       and Wired '94, all in Europe.  The Party '94 articles are thorough,
       but then again, so were those in DemoNews :).  They're worth reading
       anyway. A "Music Corner" section has been added to the articles, in
       light of the booming music scene.  It features articles like
       Scream Tracker 3 vs. FastTracker 2, tips and tricks, and reviews of
       TP94 music, MC2, and the Epidemic musicdisk.

       The music selections in the mag are excellent as always.  Artists
       included are Basehead of KFMF/ImpCda, Zodiak of ImpCda, and Scorpik
       of S!P. Two of the tracks are eight channels, a first in this issue,
       but they can only be heard if you have a GUS.

     - What's Old?

       For those of you who have not seen any issues of the Imphobia
       Diskmag, this is what you are missing.  The mag is basically split up
       into five parts: editorial, charts, interviews, articles, and
       credits.  The first and last are self-explanatory; the other three go
       as follows:

        Charts: Top 15 Groups, Demos, Intros, Coders, Artists, Musicians,
        Music- Disks (Egg 2 made it, woohoo!), and Overall.  The voting is
        conducted through anyone who submits a voting form.

        Interviews: one-on-one's with various members of demo groups, mainly
        from Europe.

        Articles: The articles are almost countless.  Categories include:
        Front News, Coding/Graphics/Music Corner, Partyline, Weird Stories,
        Poetry, Messages, and Advertisements.

     - What's Wrong?

       I have but two peeves about the mag: One, I can't play the 8-channel
       music due to my "lame" SB-Pro, and two, when you scroll forward
       through the articles, they will sometimes scroll back!  I hope this
       gets fixed, it gets annoying.

     - Overall Rating

       If there's one diskmag you have to get until NAID or ASM '95, let it
       be this one.  Although it caters more to the European demo scene than
       the American, it offers a wealth of information to anyone interested
       in demos.

_____Infused Bytes #2

 /demos/diskmags/ibytes02.zip (929k)
 Rating: **    (2 of 5)

   A few days after the release of Imphobia 9, this diskmag comes out. It
   was put together by a group from _Russia_.  The English is choppy, but
   it's understandable.  The mag covers the "demo and hacker scenes" in
   Russia and the rest of the world, for the IBM, Amiga, and (gasp) C-64.
   Included are articles, charts, a couple interviews (one with Daredevil/
   Ren), _lots_ of rumors/opinions, and some pictures.  Infused Bytes uses
   VGA (320x400) and DSMI, which means if DMP works with your sounds card,
   this will too.

     - What's New?

       New to this issue are graphics and sound.  Apparently it is a big
       improvement over issue #1.

     - What's Old?

       Everything.  Start reading the articles and you'll swear it's 1993
       again.  All the reviews and charts are outdated (Maelcum made top 10
       musicians, though!).  The newest articles cover ST3.01 and ASM94.

     - What's Wrong?

       I got the mag to run with no problems on my 486/TS4000/SBPro.  So I
       have no complaints about bugs or getting the diskmag to work, just
       the lack of effort involved in filling it.

     - Overall Rating

   If you want more up-to-date information on demos and such, download
   Imphobia # 7 (not a typo (: ).  The Russian scene at present seems like
   the American scene pre-Renaissance (group, not era), which wasn't pretty.
   Unless you are curious about demo-life in the former Soviet Union, there
   are better ways to use 1.6 megs diskspace.

 <<HORNET News>>

''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

 This week, without a doubt, has been the busiest for me in months.
 Academics and work aside, HORNET was aglow with activity.

_____Music Contest ]I[ (general)

 You probably didn't enter Music Contest I.  Mabey you entered Music Contest
 ][.  Well, Music Contest ]I[ is something you definitely _will not_ want to
 miss.

 By tradition, the Music Contests are international music competitions that
 are not held at any specific location (like a demo party is).  Instead,
 musicians track their tunes, then upload them to HORNET.  From there, a
 large group of judges rate the songs and the results are posted indicating
 the winners.

 This week, I completed the alpha version of the text for MC3.  At this
 point, no information will be given about specifics of the contest until I
 get some feedback from others.  Before you ask, the contest will be
 officially announced at the NAID demo party on April 15, 1995.

_____Music Contest ]I[ (Intro)

 Jason Nunn, Stony, myself, and a few others are working very hard to
 produce a respectable invitation "intro" to announce this contest.

 !!WE NEED YOUR HELP!!

 Jason is our main coder for this intro, and he lives in Australia.  This is
 long way from the United States of America (where I reside).  Jason has
 only limited 'net access, and we are desperately seeking an Australian
 courier to help us get files to each other.

 If you know _anyone_ who can help with this, please write me at
 r3cgm@dax.cc.uakron.edu.  I can not stress enough how much we need a
 courier.  By the way, we _really_ need a courier.  Did I mention we need a
 courier?  The point is, if we can't find someone, then the invitation (and
 possibly Music Contest ]I[) will be delayed.

 Jason is also looking for some public source code for .lzh compression
 routines.  If you know of any, please write me about it.

_____Music Contest ]I[ (Player)

 The HORNET staff is working on a player program for judging the MC3
 entries. This is being coded by MikMak/Hardcode and the interface is being
 done by Rao and Air Richter.  This player supports XM, S3M, and MOD formats
 on both GUS and the Sound Blaster family of cards.

 To my knowledge, this will be the first player to fully and accurately
 support the XM (Fast Tracker ][) format.  Trust me, I use this player
 instead of FT2 to listen to all the XMs I have here.

 After MC3 is over, this player's interface will probably be changed
 slightly and it will become a wonderful stand alone player just like DMP,
 CapaMod, or Inertia Player.  From my personal listening, it already whomps
 all three of those in raw sound quality!

_____Music Contest ]I[ (Free Disks!)

 I have about 100 low and high density disks lying around here that are
 doing nothing but collect dust.  Recently, I thought of a good way to put
 these to use.

 A local company (Kinkos) produces nice color disk labels at low prices.
 If possible, I will be putting the MC3 Intro and Player on these disks,
 slapping on a nice label, and _giving_ them away for _free_ at the NAID
 demo party.

_____DemoNews for DOS Plus

 The staff at HORNET is going to tackle a new project.  DemoNews for DOS
 Plus (DNDP) is destined to be a fantastic disk magazine complete with
 graphics and music.

 Three issues are currently being planned:
    Issue #1 : The Best of DemoNews (interviews, editorials, articles, etc.)
    Issue #2 : The NAID Party Report (reviews, on-site reports, etc.)
    Issue #3 : The Music Contest ]I[ Report (clips of music and reviews)

 I am still waiting on a beta version of this from our developers, but stay
 tuned for more details.

 These diskmags will be a wonderful complement for every faithful DemoNews
 reader!

_____Genesis (HORNET's first demo)

 HORNET is putting together a demo for the NAID demo party to be held this
 April 15th in Quebec, Canada.  Tom V., Stony, and myself are working full
 steam to make this demo one that will guarantee HORNET a spot in the demo
 scene (i.e. you better greet us in all your demos from now on).  :)

 Tom will probably be upset with me for promoting the demo in here (he isn't
 quite as confident as I am that it will turn out great).  Regardless, I
 just thought I'd let you all know that it is coming, and it will be good.

_____HORNET at NAID

 Plans have been made for 3 members of the HORNET crew to attend the NAID
 party.  Coincidentally, Jeff/HORNET lives only a few minutes from the party
 place itself.  I will be arriving at his house the night before the party
 begins, and will accompany Jeff to the party.

 On my journey, I will have the chance to drive through New York and several
 cites in the US that I've never seen before.  If all goes as planned, this
 will be a real exciting time for me and the staff of HORNET.

 Ryan Cramer will also be attending (last I heard) but I do not know how or
 when he will be getting there.

_____In Summary

 As you might have picked up from all of this, HORNET is a little busy at
 the moment.

 With my trusty coffee in one hand, my pack of cigars in the other, and a
 bowl of macaroni and cheese in the other, I will do my best to have all of
 these projects done _on time_ and done _well_.  (hey wait a second, that's
 three hands I have things in!)  Well, how do you think I type so fast?  :)

 For those of you attending NAID, I'll be the guy in the corner of the room
 with a shaky hand holding a cigar, pulling out my hair, muttering the words
 "I can't believe we got it done" over and over and over...

 By the way, did I mention that I'm not really human?  I'm actually a very
 advanced and automated script file on some computer in Akron Ohio.  You
 don't honestly think that its humanly possible for one person to tackle
 this much do you?

_____Imphobia 9 (Bogus Bug Fix)

 Hi there...

 Well, we don't like to make such reports, but I guess this time it had to
 be done.  Two days after the recent release of the Imphobia #9 diskmag, a
 file called IMP9BFIX.ZIP was released by a certain group called TEMPLAR.
 This file has been found at that Pointbreak BBS.  As stated in the
 file_id.diz, this file is supposed to be a fix for Imphobia #9 pretending
 to correct some errors with the cursors and IRQs.

 Well, let's makes some things clear.  This 'fix' doesn't fix anything (and
 we don't know about any cursor/IRQ errors in the mag).  The only things it
 does is changing some stupid things like renaming our coder's name "WIZARD"
 into "LIZARD" and some other craps like that.  It might also change some
 other things in the code and maybe some virus or trojans might have been
 put in there: who knows what those loosers might have invented.  So we
 encourage you all _not_ to run that modified version and encourage all
 sysops to DELETE that file from their BBS file base.

 Our first intention was just to write a little text about this in the next
 issue of the Imphobia diskmag.  But, as we don't know what those people
 might have included in that .exe and want to prevent our readers from any
 damages or problems this file might bring, we decided to release this
 little text to the public.

 A modified version of ZEBIG/SPEED's Imphobia #9 cover picture was also
 included with that pseudo fix.  It's really evident that those people just
 want to bring some shit in the scene by releasing that kind of thing. It's
 really sad that those kind of things appear in the scene.

 Well, I guess some people do not yet understand the real meaning of the
 word 'scene'.

 Regards, Darkness [Imphobia]
   In the name of the whole Imphobia team.

_____Changes

 Hello, everyone! Here we are, another week has come to an end, and another
 DemoNews is out. What you are reading now is just a general "What's going on" 
 statement.

 First, I made a mistake in DemoNews 82 when I announced that Necros would
 not be at NAID. He is going, and he sent email to Snowman (which was later
 forwarded to me) to confirm this. At the time of writing that article, I had
 heard that he was not going, but this has changed. So, apologies to Necros, 
 and the rest of you be cautious if you intend to enter the music compo! =)

 Next, the new "Help Wanted" section has some bulletins in it from people who
 might be looking for people like you, so be sure to check that out. If you 
 are interested in posting a bulletin to the "Help Wanted" section, please 
 refer to DemoNews 83 for complete details.
 
 Starting this week, myself, Phoenix, and PeriSoft will be writing reviews on
 uploaded material to HORNET. PeriSoft and myself will be reviewing the new 
 music (in the form of individual releases, mostly), and Phoenix will provide 
 reviews of Mags, MusicDisks, and Demos. This is in response to reader demand,
 so we hope it will be beneficial to you, and will encourage downloading from
 HORNET (or its _faster_ mirror: ftp.cdrom.com /demos) We may not be able to 
 review everything that is uploaded, but we will try to provide you with as 
 much information as time will allow for us to do.
 
 I got a response to my "What's in/What's out" feature in DemoNews 83, and 
 the person wrote that he disagreed with some of the opinions presented. I 
 appreciate any response I get to my articles, good or bad, and I would like 
 to ask all of you to write me if you have a strong opinion of anything that 
 I write. It is important that there is communication between the writers and
 the readers, for many reasons. I need to know how I am doing, and what I
 should change about what I do. 

 I'm open to any type of criticism, of course, as long as you will defend your 
 opinion. I am willing to adapt to any changes that you may suggest, and would
 like to know what you would like to read about in future DemoNews issues. It
 is my hopes that I can continue to write articles for this newsletter which
 are of interest to you, the readers. Your comments and ideas would be very 
 helpful! 

 Thank you for those who have mailed me already, and I hope to hear from more 
 of you in the future!

_____Time for Reviews

 And it became SO (that's my new motto).  Everyone, check out our review
 section in this brand spanking new issue of DemoNews.

 > These reviews wouldn't have to be too long (god knows that DemoNews is
 > long enuf already:) ), just a short blurb on new demos, and maybe some

 >
 > Nettwerk

 This sounds like a good idea for when things get slow around here (not
 likely until after NAID).  Also, we _are_ making attempts to keep DemoNews
 smaller.  :)

_____Necros is 'Da Man

 > Do me like a favor.  In the next demonews tell people that I _am_ going
 > to NAID unlike the rumors section you printed in DemoNews #80 :>
 >
 > Necros

 OK DemoNews people, Necros _is_ going to NAID.  GraveDigger, you're gonna
 get it now for feeding me false information.

_____I Used to Be a Subscriber

 If at all possible, we will keep the size of DemoNews down in the future.

_____Where's the ROMs?

 Anyone with information should contact mc007c@uhura.cc.rochester.edu

  The /groups directory contains many invalid links to files.  This problem
  will become more pronounced in the coming months.  I am still unable to
  devise a plan to handle changes to this directory quickly and accurately.

  Unless someone sends me a really good suggestion on this, the entire
  directory will probably deleted inside of a month.

  This also means that no more /groups directories will be given out until
  the situtation is resolved or removed.

''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

_____Denthor Uncovers a Secret Plot

 Well, here I am for another Demuan article.

 I am going to do something different today. Last week Snowman wrote that
 article saying that we seem to be straying a bit from focusing on demo type
 stuff. I don't want to get Snowman angry, he alters my tuts before
 releasing them (just see tut10new to see what I mean).

 So, just to show you that I actually _do_ code, and there is a reason I am
 here in the code section, I will give you a tip.

 When you declare a variable as a constant in a Borland compiler, it puts
 that variable on the stack.

 So...

 CONST   bob : word = 50;

 mov   ax,bob
 is actually
 mov  ax,ss:[bob]

 What does this mean? It means that if you really really need an extra
 register, you can forgo local variables, make all your locals constants and
 use BP, also you can access globals while DS is pointing to something else.
 Cool huh?

 Whew, that should get me off the coding hook for a while.

 I am beginning to wonder if the internet actually exists. I think it may
 just be one big coverup, and all the people I think I am talking to are
 just typed in by Snowman. I must admit, he sure is a fast typist. Every
 time there is a net split on IRC, he has just decided that he doesn't feel
 like keeping up so many conversations with himself (and me!)

 I must admit though, he is thorough. He must write all those programs and
 stuff for the "hornet" incoming directory. He probably only does stuff for
 half of them though, knowing that I will never ftp some of the rubbish that
 is put there.

 How did I find out about his evil scheme? Easy. comp.sys.ibm.pc.demos .
 Nothing so utterly awful, so devoid of intelligence yet having such a large
 quantity, could be the product of a normal society. He must have written a
 little "GUS vs SB" macro, which he alters slightly whenever either company
 releases a new soundcard. He is clever though! Every now and then he writes
 something with a really cool header, such as "Trying to optimize gouraud
 code", but the body is always "Give me your optimized gouraud code, I don't
 know how."

 And here we have found the reason for his intricate plot. He wants all my
 source. Hahaha Snowman, you didn't think I would figure it out, did you!
 But I'm too clever, yes too clever, it's mine, mine you hear! nyahahaha!

 Wait. I have just figured out another thing. If the internet is a massive
 Snowman-hoax type thing, then only Snowman will read this article! I'm on
 to you, Snowman! I'll bet this whole "America" thing is just a product of
 your twisted imagination too. You almost had me there. You never convinced
 anyone with that "MTV" thing though.

 Wow, deducting is hard work. So long Snowman, see you next week! I'm off to
 buy another barrel of Jelly Tots.

 Byeeeee...   - Denthor

 PS. Snowman, tell me truthfully, does the GUS exist? It doesn't, does it.
     That's why no one (you!) has sent me one.

_____Snowman's Response

 As I stated in the "HORNET News" section, I am not actually human.  I am
 an automated script file.  However, this requires a bit of clarification.

 Denthor, not only is there no one else in the demo scene besides you and
 me, but you are the _only_ person subscribed to DemoNews.  All that stuff
 about 1250+ readers is pure garbage.  Since I'm a script file, it only
 takes me about 3.5 minutes to create an issue of DemoNews (not much work).
 My creator decided that it would be great fun to waste several years of
 your life on this fantasy called "the demo scene".

 However, you have now uncovered my secret plan. :(  I guess I better come
 clean about that little World War ][ hoax too...

 And BTW: The GUS does not actually exist.  It is a front by Gravis/Forte
 because they wanted some attention.  All of the coders who claim to support
 the GUS are just making up code because they are embarrassed to admit that
 they have never seen a GUS.

 (It sure feels good to be honest every once in a while)

_____Control Looking for Musicians

 A group named CONTROL, based in Toronto, is seeking musicians. The group
 currently has a coder, and an ANSI artist. They are seeking no more than
 four "pretty good composers" for their group. They have coded their own
 music player, and seek to release a musicdisk. Any interested musicians
 should send a sample of their music to this ftp site/directory:

 compulink.com /control/applicants_work

 [ed: You should also include a text file with your song containing your
 email address, so they can contact you]

_____Musician Needed

 We really need a good mod-composer for our demo productions. But we don't 
 want the ordinary techno/disco music! IT'S BORING!!!!

 The best would be a musician that's inspired by Sisters of Mercy!

 Who are we?? Well, the Swedish demogroup DPS of course.
  
 [ed: the group did not give any contact info]

_____In Summary

 I'm glad to see that this area is receiving some bulletins. I hope this new
 feature is helpful to everyone, and would like to hear your comments on it.
 
 Send articles to the email address at the end of this article. Please write
 "DemoNews Help Wanted" as the subject of your message.

 For a complete reference to the guidelines for submitting to this section,
 refer to DemoNews 83.

 Please, when submitting an article for the "Help Wanted" section, include
 your email address in the BODY of the message. This would be a great help
 to both of us. Thanks!

_____How to Get 'em

 After reading this issue of DemoNews, you may be wondering how you can get
 previous ones.  Well fear not!  There are two different ways to do so:

 1: FTP to hornet.eng.ufl.edu and go to /pub/msdos/demos/news/OLD_NEWS and
    start downloading anything you see.

 2: Now you can request back issues of DemoNews via e-mail.  Start a letter
    to listserver@oliver.sun.ac.za (any subject line) and in the body of the
    letter include "get demuan-list <index>" where INDEX refers to the
    index number of the issue.

    For example:  get demuan-list 55

    This would retrieve DemoNews #80

    For more recent issues that are split into multiple parts, you must send
    an individual request for each index number.

 Just today, two interesting things happened:

 A very nice woman that I was studying with got a flat tire and I spent a
 couple of hours trying to get her home.  This time could probably have been
 cut in half, but I wasn't in any particular hurry.  :)

 Ulrik Henriksen sent me three CD-ROMs, including the Assembly 94' party
 CD.  I'll review this one for the next issue of DemoNews.

 You thought that we had a lot of projects going on here at HORNET?  Well,
 next week I will announce the biggest project HORNET has undertaken in
 months.  Its going to be big, its going to be important, and you are going
 to be impressed!  (you might even wet your cyber-pants)

 Remember, we _need_ an Australian courier for Jason Nunn!  Please help.

 See you in CyberSpace,
