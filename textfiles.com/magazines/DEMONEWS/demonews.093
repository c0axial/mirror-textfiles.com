=------------[Introduction]--[Snowman, GraveDigger, Trixter, and White Noise]-=

 SM: Hello all, and welcome to the 93rd issue of DemoNews.
 WN: 93rd?  Geez, won't be able to use my fingers to count them
     shortly anymore... :)
 TX: You could always use your toes... but then again, that's the lazy 
     coder perspective.  You should really own more arms.
 GD: This week in the the "Uploads" section, we have reviews of Naid, The
     Gathering, and x95 party music. Be sure to check it out!
 WN: GraveDigger... is that reviews of the whole 50 something of 'em?
 GD: Jeff, only the files that were uploaded to the site, of course. :)
     Hey, what do we have for articles, Snow?
 SM: Well, this week we start it off with the second in my series of
     "4DOS 4DEMOS" tutorials.
 GD: Will there be more articles in this series to follow?    
 SM: Heck yeah!  Probably at least 8 or 10.  Of course, these articles
     will do little good for WN since he's such a Windows FREAK! :)
 WN: I admit.  I just joined Windoze Anonymous last week... :)  The
     first class was "I hate Bill Gates 101".
 GD: You better do well in that class.. Win95 is on the way!  Oh, next 
     is another of my Tracking Tips columns.
 SM: Isn't this Tracking Tips about bloody notes?
 GD: Something like that.. tracking gore!  Say, Jeff, have you ever
     experienced physical harm when writing a song?
 WN: Well... aside from bashing my head on the keyboard when my chords
     don't sound right, not really...    
 TX: Sounds like coding a certain sound system.  Using a mallet works
     better.
 SM: Anyway, our next article is an interview done by GD.  Brett, would
     you care to give a summary?
 GD: Sure.. I interviewed Jugi/Complex about a month ago and learned some
     interesting things about one of the scene's older members.
 WN: <whiny voice> So, I'm an old member too, how come I don't get
     interviewed?
 GD: dope.mod :)
 SM: Next article comes to us from Tom Verbeure.  Its been a while since 
     he last wrote for Hornet, but this article is very good.
 GD: Indeed, I'm glad to see him back in the newsletter.
 WN: I should really start writing something for this newsletter other
     than inane comments to fill up the intros... :)
 SM: How about a basic tutorial on how to get started with making your
     own Home Page?
 GD: That's a neat idea! And Jeff would be the perfect one to write it.
     Jeff, what do you think?    
 WN: hmmm... Why not... some style tips wouldn't be bad...
 TX: I think that would be a great idea, but make sure you emphasize proper
     style:  eLiTe sTufF doesn't look good under HTML.  ;) Not to mention
     that no one really wants to see a 1 MB GIF of their dog. :)
 SM: Well folks, this has been Snowman...
 GD: ...and this has been GraveDigger...
 WN: ...not to forget White Noise...
 TX: ...and we all love Trixter...
 <>: And we are OUTTA HERE.


=--------------------------------------------[4DOS 4DEMOS: Part 2]--[Snowman]-=

 _____Preparation

 This article assumes you have read Part 1 of this series.  Be sure to
 follow all of the steps I listed there.  We will be relying on them now.
 Today we are going to talk about Environmental Variables and Color-Coded
 Directories.

 During the past two weeks, I went out and collected a lot of utilities for
 ya'll.  I also reorganized the directories.  Instead of the files being
 located under /pub/demos/utils/dos/4dos, they are now just under
 /pub/demos/utils/4dos.  You can also get files talked about in these
 articles in /pub/demos/utils/4dos/tutor.

 Here is what you need to do for today's lesson:

   1.  Create a directory somewhere off the root directory on your hard
       drive called \STARTUP.  We will be putting many cool files in here.
   2.  Get your favorite ascii editor ready (I prefer QEdit).
       By the way, QEdit is made from the same people who bring you 4DOS:
       JP Software.

 [Environmental Variables]

 _____Overview

 Beware, the first few articles in this series are relatively simple.  Don't 
 get caught off guard.  Here is an excerpt from an upcoming article:

   "...=$e[2D$e[0;34m(%%@DOSMEM[k]base) $e[0;32m(%%@XMS[k]xms) 
    $e[0;33m(%%@EMS[k]ems) $e[0;36m(%%@DISKFREE[c:,m]hard) 
    %%@IF[%@CDROM[d:] == 1,$e[1;33m(CD-ROM) ,]%%@IF[%%_MOUSE
    == 1,$e[0;31m(mouse) ,]$e[0;35m(shell $z) $e[0;37m $_$p$g..."

 So as you can see, there's a lot to be covered before we get to that point.
 Anyway, on to the lesson for today...

 Many programs require environmental variables.  Common examples would
 include "ULTRASND=240,1,1,11,7" and "BLASTER=A220 I7 D1 T2".  We do not
 want to have these cluttering up your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  Its time for
 them to grow up and leave.  Its time for SET_ENVS.BAT!

 _____Make It So

 OK, we know that we want a file called SET_ENVS.BAT and we want it to
 be located under \STARTUP.  But what does SET_ENVS.BAT look like?

 For starters, you need to make a standard header block.  This is just a bit
 of text that you stick at the top of each file explaining what it is.

 Here is my personal header block:

   : File Name         : SET_ENVS.BAT
   : Title             : Set Environmental Variables
   : Author            : Christopher G. Mann
   : Last Modification : May 30, 1995
   : Purpose           : Configure environment for different applications.

 All of my batch files follow this format.  Notice that each line begins
 with a ":".  This is the same thing as a REM, but its much cleaner in my
 opinion.

 Next we want to list the environmental variables.  However, when we run
 this file, we don't want everything to be displayed to the screen.  We
 want to just type SET_ENVS and go!  So the next two lines are:

   : Don't echo anything
   @echo off

 The ": Don't echo anything" is just a comment.  I suggest you use them
 often.  Trust me, in a few months you'll go back to modify a file and not
 have any idea why you did something.

 Last, but not least, we list our environmental variables.  Open up both
 your AUTOEXEC.BAT and SET_ENVS.BAT files and start cutting and pasting.
 When you are done, your AUTOEXEC.BAT file should contain _no_ "SET"
 statements.

 Here are a few of my variables:

   SET BLASTER=A220 I7 D1 T2
   SET CAPAMOD=/pan33 /fde0 /lop0 /md01 /rnd /clr1
   SET NU=C:\NU
   SET TEMP=C:\TMP
   SET ULTRADIR=C:\US
   SET ULTRASND=240,1,1,11,7

 The last step is to have SET_ENVS.BAT called every time you start your
 machine.  We can do this by adding one line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

   CALL C:\STARTUP\SET_ENVS.BAT

 Now your system is cleaner and more organized.  Please do not skip over
 making this file.  We will be adding a lot to it later (when we start
 working on aliases).

 [Color-Coded Directories]

 _____Overview

 Wouldn't it be nice to have all of your GIF and JPG files appear in blue
 and your MOD and S3M files in green?  With a quick glance, you can easily
 identify any type of file.  Color-coded directories will save time and make
 your system look a lot more groovy! :)

 _____Make It So

 We need to make a new file.  What is it called?  It's SET_COLS.BAT!  And
 where are we going to put it?  Yippers, in \STARTUP.

 At this point, you might be noticing a trend.  Right now, I have 5
 SET_XXXX.BAT files in my \STARTUP directory.  By the time I'm done writing
 this series there might have a couple more.

 Here is my header block for this file:

   : File Name         : SET_COLS.BAT
   : Title             : Color Directory Configuration for 4DOS
   : Author            : Christopher G. Mann
   : Last Modification : May 30, 1995
   : Purpose           : This file contains a list of common file extensions
   :                   : and the colors those files should be displayed as
   :                   : when a "dir" is requested.

 And we don't want this file to echo either so add:

   : Don't echo anything
   @echo off

 Here is a list of my own color-coded files (slightly condensed):

   : Archive
   set colordir=arj zip lzh lha a0?: cyan;
   : Batch Files
   set colordir=%colordir%bat btm: red;
   : Code
   set colordir=%colordir%c h asm hpp cpp pas bas scr:bright cyan;
   set colordir=%colordir%obj tms: white;
   : Directories
   set colordir=%colordir%dirs:blue;
   : Executables
   set colordir=%colordir%com exe: bright red;
   : Graphics
   set colordir=%colordir%gif jpg lbm pcx tga wpg: bright magenta;
   : Music
   set colordir=%colordir%669 amf far mod mtm ptm s3m xm:bright blue;
   : System
   set colordir=%colordir%drv sys: bright green;
   : Text
   set colordir=%colordir%1st doc me nfo txt:green;

 For a list of color names, just type "HELP COLORS" at your 4DOS prompt.

 You'll notice that my first set is "set colordir=arj zip..." and the second
 one is "set colordir=%colordir%bat btm...".  Why do we have that
 "%colordir%" thingie in there?  Well, we are working with 1 variable here,
 the "colordir" variable.  If you were to type:

   set colordir=Snowman
   set colordir=can't track music.

 then the value of colordir would be "can't track music" because you
 reset the variable when you entered a new value.  We get around this by
 typing:

   set colordir=Snowman
   set colordir=%colordir% can't track music.

 That little "%colordir%" means 'take the original value of colordir and
 put it before the rest of this line'.  So after typing the above two lines,
 the value of colordir is "Snowman can't track music."

 Just like with SET_ENVS.BAT, we want this file to be called automatically
 every time we boot our machine.  So add the following line to your
 AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

   CALL C:\STARTUP\SET_COLS.BAT

 You might be thinking "Hey, we are using 'set colordir'.  Why didn't that
 go in our SET_ENVS.BAT file?"  Well, I'm not going to tell you.  Its a

 [Wrapping Up]

 OK, now your system has Color-Coded directories and Environmental Variables
 all organized and tidy.  But wait!  All of that stuff eats up memory.  Are
 you going to run out?  Well, last week I told you to add the line:

   SHELL=C:\4DOS\4DOS.COM C:\4DOS /P /E:1024

 to your CONFIG.SYS file.  The "/E:1024" means 'allocate 1024 bytes for
 environmental memory'.  You can check to see how much you have left simply
 by typing MEMORY from your 4DOS prompt.

 Here is what mine looks like:

       655,360 bytes total DOS RAM
       635,280 bytes free  <--- and I'm not even using QEMM!

     1,843,200 bytes free XMS memory  (HMA in use)

         2,048 bytes total environment
           575 bytes free  <--- I still have 575 bytes left

         2,048 bytes total alias
           873 bytes free

         1,024 bytes total history

 If you notice that your environment space is running low, then simply
 increase the "/E:xxxx" parameter above to accommodate.  Mine is currently
 set to 2048, but its unlikely at this point that you will need more than
 that.
 
 Well, now you have fancy colors and your environmental variables all set.
 Next issue, we'll talk about ALIASES, PATH, and CDPATH.  This will bring
 the number of SET_XXXX.BAT files up to four.  The fifth file will be
 SET_PROM.BAT, entitled "The Ultimate Prompt".  This will utilize a lot of
 internal 4DOS calls so we'll put it off until the forth installment of this
 series.  Until then, take care everyone.

 And remember, 4DOS 4EVER!

=----------------------------[Tracking Tips IV: Note Bleeding]--[GraveDigger]-=

 "Note Bleeding" is just a fancy name I came up with for fading one note out
 while fading another in, causing the two notes to "bleed" into each other.
 I find it to be most effective on looped string instruments, but it can be
 useful for other sounds as well.

 What this does is change the current note value without the bumpy transition
 of simply re-sounding the note.   Doing that can even be dangerous if your
 sample does not have a fast attack and no offset command is used. So, using
 this "bleeding" technique provides a gentle note change with a nice smooth
 transition.  Below is the tracker example:

 Before:                                       After:
 
 |  Channel 1  |  Channel 2  |                 |  Channel 1  |  Channel 2  | 
 |C-4 01 64 ...|... .. .. ...|                 |C-4 01 64 ...|... .. .. ...|
 |... .. .. ...|... .. .. ...|                 |... .. .. ...|... .. .. ...|
 |G-4 01 64 ...|... .. .. ...|                 |... .. 48 ...|G-4 01 16 ...|
 |... .. .. ...|... .. .. ...|                 |... .. 32 ...|... .. 32 ...|
 |... .. .. ...|... .. .. ...|                 |... .. 00 ...|... .. 64 ...|

 In the first example, you have a standard note change. In the second
 example, the first note fades out as the second note fades in. Tip: use
 more rows to gradually change the volumes. This will create a much smoother
 effect. I just used five rows to save space. :)

 Also take note that the sum of the volumes between the two "bleeding"
 channels is always the same, from the initial note attack all the way
 through the crossover. This will create a very smooth "bleed."

=-----------------------------[Interview with Jugi of Complex]--[GraveDigger]-=

 Jugi is a musician in the group Complex. Complex recently won first place at
 The Gathering '95 with their demo entitled "Dope." Other popular Complex PC
 releases include "Cyboman" and "Cyboman 2", two awesome intros.

 In our last issue of o1art, Reward and Jmagic of Complex were interviewed.
 If you haven't seen it yet, be sure to get a copy and read it.

 Complex also promises to present a demo at Assembly '95. I'm sure it will be
 another fascinating presentation. 

 Since Jugi and myself live on different continents, our time differences
 prevented an interview on IRC for some time. Eventually we met up, and the
 conversation that took place follows. The interview took place on Monday,
 May 8, 1995 from approximately 8:00am to 8:30am EDT.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 JG  -  Jukka Kaartinen   of   Complex    jusaka@tarzan.math.jyu.fi
 GD  -  Brett Neely       of   Hornet     gd@ftp.cdrom.com
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 GD: Hello! Could you tell us your name, age, where you live, where you go
     to school, and work?

 JG: My real name is Jukka Kaartinen. I'm 22-years-old. I study in the
     University of Jyvaskyla... I study computer science, physics and
     multimedia. I also do some freelancer gfx work for one company... :)

 GD: Do you wear glasses or contacts?

 JG: I wear glasses. :) I'm too lazy for contacts.
 
 GD: When did you attend your first demoparty?

 JG: I was at my first party in '88. It was a small party in the middle of
     the woods... in an old school house. It was held by Byterapers.

 GD: How many people were there?

 JG: About 30... There were lotsa c64s and some Amigas...

 GD: Any PC's?

 JG: Nope...

     I had already made a game on the c64, and I had a preview of that at the
     party... and I think I released one picture there too. Made with a c64.
     It was 320x200, 2 colors.

 GD: What kind of game had you made?
 
 JG: The game was an Uridium clone type of shootemup... we sold it to this
     English budget game company called CRL, but it went bankrupt before we
     got the money from it. But it was a really cool game... I did gfx and
     music for it, and my friend coded it. We worked on it for about 1.5
     years.

 GD: That's too bad you didn't get money for it. :( I also used to have a
     c64 - wish I could have seen the game. :>

     When did you first come in contact with Complex?

 JG: Well.. I'm gonna tell ya older stories now! :)

 GD: Ok :)

 JG: Back in 1990 I was at one lame party... I needed a ride back home, so
     I got it from Mic Dair (leader/organizer of Complex) and Cable (old
     amiga coder) and I joined Complex then :) I think Reward joined Complex
     in 1992, since he wanted to get in free for Assembly '92 which we were
     "organizing" as a name only...

 GD: Hehe, now there's a good reason to join a demo group. :)

 JG: That was the way he could get in drunk & free. :)

 GD: When did Jmagic join?

 JG: Hm.. I try to remember. It was after he won at The Party '93... I knew
     him thru Trav (of Complex maybe) :) and Trav is an old friend of
     Saviour / Complex (famous elfmania coder). Anyway, I thought... lets
     have a PC section, and that was ok with Mic Dair, so we did it.

     So Jmagic started to work with us. Since Jmagic is from this town
     (Jyvaskyla city; the place where I study) we could work very closely.

 GD: It's important to be able to get together for this kind of thing; you
     are lucky to be near each other.

     At The Gathering 95, "Dope" won first place.. congratulations to all
     of Complex for that. :)

 JG: Err. Thank you :)

 GD: How long did the entire "Dope" process take?
  
 JG: Well... we put it together in little over a week. I mean... the routines
     were ready for about two months or so.. Jmagic had worked on them little
     by little, then we thought... "now we are gonna make a demo." First we
     just talked and bullshitted about it... and then we realized that there
     was only 1 week to go!

 GD: Why is it that the greatest demoparty entries are made in such a short
     amount of time? :) How long did it take to write the music?

 JG: I had been working on the tune for about a week then.. and it was nothing
     yet. So, a little over 2 weeks, but its hard to tell.. cuz I can't
     remember how many hours i used on it. I might have worked 5 hours one
     day... 0 hours the next... etc.

 GD: Which came first.. dope.mod or onward.xm?

 JG: I did onward.xm at the party place in 20 minutes from the "Dope" tune.

 GD: Oh ;)

 JG: Anyway.. the gfx in dope were done like... ultra fast. I just
     photoshopped/3ds'ed some shit and put it there. We ran out of time so
     badly. I had to send the "routine boxes" to Reward to be dithered.
     They were all 3ds... and the desert at the end was just a fast scan :)

     All the movements of the objects from envmap to the end was made by
     jmagic in about 10 mins. so it wasn't quite what I wanted. The thing
     is... we deliberately made the demo so that it would be lightning fast
     to design. We used the old amiga trick "routine boxes"... routine
     after routine... boasting about them with these "little" annoying
     boxes.

 GD: I like those little annoying boxes :>

 JG: The amiga scene has had its share of those kinda demos, so we thought
     this would be the first to do it with the PC. There's no grand design in
     this demo.... just routines routines routines. That's its purpose.  

     It feels so funny when people make such a big fuss about Dope when I
     know its some routines put together in a little over a week.

     I know that PC doods like those "movie" like demos where some guy jumps
     off of a plane without a reason :)... etc... and spaceships fly and you
     feel like you were in a low budget scifi movie.
  
 GD: In my opinion, a demo doesn't need a story to be good, it just needs
     to be original.

 JG: Anyway this is no movie... its a demo of coding skills in a nice packet.
     We are in the process of making a demo where you couldn't instantly tell
     "this a scene demo". No obscure logos flashing on the screen... no
     routine "boasting"... but  something like a beautiful scenery "movie"
     with something that will awake your "sense of wonder"... lets just hope
     we have time and inspiration to finish it... and then you can Dive with
     us...

 GD: Can't wait to see that!
 
     Complex's two "Cyboman" intros helped get your group into the Imphobia
     charts. How much work went into these intros?

 JG: Cyboman2 was about 1 week. I directed it half the way, with Jmagic in
     Jyvaskyla. But when I saw the final version at the party it wasn't good
     enough so we fixed the rest of it at the party.
 
 GD: Personally, I think the "Dope" music really tops off the demo... the
     music is so original and fitting with the graphics.

 JG: Ok.. lets talk about the music. The tune was actually made to fit the
     demo. :)

 GD: There's only one thing I don't like in dope.mod :) There's a bass note
     that sustains too long, i think.. about 6 minutes through the song.

 JG: Well... heh... at that point I had left for the PARTY! The "envmap"
     part of the song was made at the party and it defiantly suxx
     bigtime... regular loop collection.
 
 GD: But i really like the organ melody...

 JG: I have to say this... the "main" part of the tune which has the melody
     is the _real_ dope music... the beginning... the "tv scifi:)" sounding
     part is just something i put together to fill the beginning of the demo.
     Cliche.

 GD: Right.. the sounds go well with the scrolling "Complex" logo, though.

 JG: Well.. the music syncing is kinda of joke in dope since it depends on how
     fast your HD is. Music is started at the beginning, stopped in the end.
     There's no interaction between the music player and demo code.

     About the mod, 28 channels is nothing. Lets go thru them: 5 channels
     for drums&percussion, 9 channels for the humming sound, 2 channels
     for the bass "guitar", then the organ chords and their echos take 6
     channels, the lead and its echoes takes 4 channels. It goes something
     like that...

     ... Anyway... that's how you can spend channels. Of course I could have
     taken off like 8 channels or so if I had all the chords sampled, etc, but
     it was the "development" version of the mod that was in the demo.
 
 GD: That's true...

 JG: I could fix the tune now that I know what it should sound like. I had no
     time to "optimize"... besides... I had no need to. :) One more thing. It
     doesn't say in your favorite music CD how many channels were used. :)
     Music is music, technique is technique.

 GD: Good answer. :)

     Do you use any other tracker besides FT2?

 JG: Ok.. trackers. I only use FT2 and Protracker on Amiga.

 GD: Do you have any music theory training?

 JG: Well... I've played keyboards for 13 years now. I've never received
     classical training... but I do play a lot and compose. My piano playing
     style is like.. Tori Amos/Bruce Horsby with a touch of Chick Corea in it.

 GD: Ah.. how often do you play the piano?

 JG: I play everyday. The piano is my favorite instrument (of the ones I can
     play :)...

 GD: What kind of instruments do you have? Any keyboards/synths?

 JG: Well, my midi setup is poor and small :) I have a u-20 & 03r/w. I have
     a Korg 16 channel mixer... and I have a dx-100 too! :) But luckily my
     flatmate has a piano.

 GD: You have a dx100 computer?

 JG: Nope, Yamaha dx-100. Little thingie fm-synthesizer... and I have access
     to a piano. My flatmates(hello Anita:)) piano is in the kitchen.
 
 GD: A piano in the kitchen? :)

 JG: Yes. :)

 GD: What kind of computer setup do you have?

 JG: HEHEH... Don't ask. :)

 GD: C'mon, I'm sure my setup is far worse than yours. :)

 JG: Well.. i have an Amiga 1200 and a 486dx - 33 true IBM valuepoint. :)
 
 GD: Ah. (See, I was right =)

 JG: But i will have a new Pentium 100 reaaally soon.. so :)

 GD: Have you had any art training?

 JG: Hmm.. its been like 4 or 5 years since i've last drawn on paper. I mean
     really trained... I do sketches sometimes... but thats rare too. I've
     been doing computer gfx actively since early '87 so I'm very familiar
     working the whole gfx process within computers.

 GD: What do you hope to be doing in 5 years from now?

 JG: Making my own music.. thats my dream :) but a more realistic thing
     for me is to be working in all different kinds of multimedia projects.
     I'll be a master of science in electronic media when (and if;)) I
     graduate.

 GD: That sounds interesting... good luck with it!

 JG: There would be a zillion things to tell about the scene since I've
     been watching it for so long, but lets not bore our readers  :)

 GD: Good point... let's get going... is there anyone you want to greet?

 JG: Greetings... well... um... everybody on the net :) btw... if anyone
     wants to check out some stuff I've made during my sceneyears, check
     out my homepage which is: http://www.math.jyu.fi/~jusaka/

 GD: Anything else you want to say before we go?

 JG: Yes... Dope was nothing... there's more to come. Much more. :)

 GD: Can't wait to see it. :)

 JG: Ok.. I think that's it.
 
 GD: Thanks for taking the time to do this interview!

 JG: 'tis ok. Later.


=------------------------------[Palette Fading and Animation]--[Tom Verbeure]-=

 After my last article about Pentium floating-point optimization, a lot of
 people told me it was too difficult, so this time something easier.

 A standard VGA card can display only 256 colors at once. Each of these 256
 colors can be chosen individually out of 262,144 colors. You all know this,
 and most of the time, it is being regarded as a severe restriction, which
 is why 15-bit or 24-bit SVGA card are so popular. Paletted screenmodes have
 some advantages over their true-color brothers that are especially
 interesting in demos:

 * they require less memory for the same number of pixels.
 * one can change pixels with the same color to another color by
   just changing the palette value.

 Both features are a major plus for high-speed effects.

 The last feature is especially useful during fading of images, probably one
 of the most used 'effects' in demos. Instead of having to change the RGB
 values for every pixel, one has to change only the palette. Again, nothing
 new here.

 Less known is the fact that relatively complex looking animations can be
 made by simply changing the palette. The worm-hole in Unreal and the
 background of the 'Scrollers Suck' part in Panic, both demos of Future Crew
 are a nice example of this. Another one is a part in The Good, the Bad and
 the Ugly of Surprise!Productions where a logo of S!P is scrolling up-right
 in the background while some 2D signs are constantly transforming into each
 other. (Of course, everybody has seen DejaVu from Synergy Design with a
 rip-off of the wormhole :-) ).

 All these effects share some common characteristics:

   - They have very few colors
   - Repetitive animations
   - frequency of repetition is fast.

 How is this being done? They just change the palette, sometimes with a
 small action on the foreground (like the transforming 2D's in TGTB&TU).

 Suppose you have 2 pictures with different colors and you would want to
 change between them by just changing the palette (of 256 color-entries).
 Suppose we are in a worst case situation where every color combination
 exists. Let N and M be the number of different colors in images A and B.
 Then N*M must be smaller than 256! So, in a worst case, one can show 2
 different images by only changing palette when both images have 16 colors.

 This worst case happens most when using scanned pictures, because there are
 no large areas with the same color. Not being in the worst case, means that
 there are less color combinations (e.g. one never has to change from a
 color X in image A to a color Y in image B). An extreme example of an
 optimal case is... standard fading of an image: in this case, EVERY pixel
 with color X is mapped to color Y (with color Y being a color X multiplied
 by a certain factor) and never to another color !

 An example will make this clear: Suppose we want to combine two images A
 and B into one bitmap with two palettes.

   image A       image B

   .....=        *.....
   ....=.        .*....
   ...=..        ..*...
   ..=...        ...*..
   .=....        ....*.
   =.....        .....*

 Then one possible solution is this:

   image C

   100002      Palette to show image A:    Palette to show image B:
   010020              color 0 = '.'               color 0 = '.'
   001200              color 1 = '.'               color 1 = '*'
   002100              color 2 = '='               color 2 = '.'
   020010
   200001

 Notice that we need only 3 colors in our palette because the combination
 '=' -> '*' doesn't exist. We are not in a worst case situation.

 Now comes the question of how to create the palettes and the bitmap to
 change between the images. Actually, this is very easy: here is the
 algorithm in pseudo-language:

   P[256]      : array of color combinations (C1,C2)
   Pal1[256]   : resulting palette to show image A
   Pal2[256]   : resulting palette to show image B
   Image C     : resulting image, containing both image A and image B
   I           : intermediate value

   Empty P
   Load Image A
   Load Image B
   For every pixelposition (x,y)
       Get colornumber A at (x,y) of image A
       Get colornumber B at (x,y) of image B
       Search colorcombination (A,B) in P.
       if (A,B) already in P
           I = position of (A,B) in P
       else
           Add colorcombination (A,B) to P
           if P is full (more than 256 color combinations)
               print "Oops. Too many combinations..."
               abort
           I = position of (A,B) in P
       end if
       Put I at position (x,y) of destination image C
   end for

   Load Palette A
   Load Palette B

   For every combination C in P
       Get A-part of the combination C
       Get (R,G,B) triple from Palette A at position of C
       Put (R,G,B) triple in Pal1 at position of C

       Get B-part of the combination C
       Get (R,G,B) triple from Palette B at position C
       Put (R,G,B) triple in Pal2 at position C
   end for

   Write Image C
   Write Palette 1
   Write Palette 2

 Voila. That's it!

 The pseudo-code to show both images it too simple, here it is anyway:

   Load Image C
   Load Palette 1
   Load Palette 2

   Black Palette

   Put Image C on screen
   Set Palette 1
           -- Image A is now visible
   Set Palette 2
           -- Image B is now visible

 Until now, nothing exciting... Just putting the right image and palette
 would result in the same 'effect', but with much more colors possible and
 much easier, only not as fast. We haven't gained almost anything, yes? But
 wait, other things are possible: perfect cross fades between two images can
 be done by interpolating between colors of Palette 1 and 2:

   Load Image C
   Load Palette 1
   Load Palette 2

   Palette I   : intermediate cross-fade palette
   TI          : intermediate color

   Black Palette

   Put Image C on screen

   For t = 0.0 to 1.0 step 0.1
       For C = 0 to 256
           Get RGB triple T1 at position C in palette 1
           Get RGB triple T2 at position C in palette 2
           TI.R = (1.0-t)*T1.R + t*T2.R
           TI.G = (1.0-t)*T1.G + t*T2.G
           TI.B = (1.0-t)*T1.B + t*T2.B
           Put RGB triple TI at position C in palette I
       end for
       Set Palette I
   end for

 Result: a perfect cross-fade between image A and B in 10 steps. Please use
 fixed integers for the multiplication (even on a Pentium :) ) or a
 multiplication table and rework the equations to T=A-t*(A+B), eliminating
 one multiplication.

 This technique doesn't have to be restricted to two images: as long as the
 number of color combinations stays below 256, extra frames can be added.
 Unfortunately, this number increases rapidly in animations.

 Let's show this with a worst case example of 4 images: Let N1,...,N4 be the
 number of colors for images 1 to 4, then N1*N2*N3*N4 must be lower than
 256. When N1==N2==N3==N4, this means that N1 is equal to only 4 !!! A
 theoretical maximum number of frames in worse case is 8 frames, with 2
 colors for each frame. To make things worse, as the number of images
 increases, the chance of having a worst case situation increases also.

 For those of you who want it described in mathematical terms:

   C=N^M (worst case) and C<= 256

 with C the number of color combinations, M images and N colors for each
 image.

 Now, we are able to explain the three characteristics of the effects in the
 different demos:

   - They have very few colors

 Logical, it is desirable to have at least 4 frames in the animation,
 giving, worst case, only 4 colors...

   - Repetitive animations

 No repetition means... lot of frames. Out of the question...

   - frequency of repetition is fast.

 I like this one: contrary to most demo-effects, it is just impossible to
 create slowly moving effects, because they need more frames :-) ! One can
 of course create 2 or more images that combine 8 images each.

 Initially, I thought that using this technique would decrease required disk
 storage. For uncompressed cases, this is true indeed: for 8 frames, one
 needs 8 times less space (when using 1 byte for each pixel). When
 compressing, this doesn't hold anymore: even bad compression algorithms
 have a compression factor of more than 8 for 2-color images. The combined
 image however generally has less repetitive sequences AND requires an extra
 786 bytes for each frame to store the palette.

 This is one of the most  ambitious music disk projects to ever be undertaken.
 Our goal with  pHluid is to offer the highest quality music to the scene on a
 reliable monthly basis.  We got tired of never knowing when or where the next
 new release  was  going to  be.   That's why pHluid was formed...  to offer a
 regular supply of quality music in one production.
