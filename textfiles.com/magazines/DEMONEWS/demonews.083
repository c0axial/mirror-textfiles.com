_____IMPORTANT!

 This issue of DemoNews is a rather important one.  It is the first issue in
 over a year that has LOST subscribers, 25 subscribers to be exact.  Several
 months ago, I started posting the number of people who recieve DemoNews at
 the beginning of each issue.  Believe it or not, this number jumped up over
 800 in the past year, until we topped off at 1252 this past week.

 I like to think of this number of subscribers as a kind of indicator
 reflecting how well this newsletter is doing.  Whenever HORNET get lots of
 subscription notifications, I know that we are doing something right.  Con-
 versely, when we loose subscribers as in this past week, I recognize that
 we have veared off course somehow.

 This past week, I received e-mail that helped me zero in on the problem.

 Over time, DemoNews has included more and more articles that have very
 little to do with the demo scene.  I recognized this weeks ago, but was
 reluctant to do much about it until reader feedback pursuaded me to.

 All of you reading this are my friends.  And as my friends, you must do a
 better job of telling me what you want in DemoNews. :)  Without feedback, I
 can only guess what might interest you.  This week, we are introducing two
 new sections which should help with this.

 In the future, I will try to do a better job to provide decent scene
 coverage.  However, I would rather you let me know that we are going astray
 through your feedback in e-mail, rather than your unsubscription
 notifications.

_____Reader Response?

   Hey, I thought of something the other day while I was reading a new
   computer mag I got. You've read some before of course,..well, you know
   how they always have a "public mail" section in the beginning? maybe you
   could do the same. ..print the interesting mail you get every week.

   Just a suggestion ..:)

   -The Veritech Knight (NAID Organizer)

 And it became so.  Starting this week, we will hopefully make "Mailroom" a
 regular column.  The concept is simple: You write me interesting mail, and
 I reply to it in here.  Easy enough?

 So send in your questions or comments and we might print them in here!

_____What's In, What's Out

 Good morning, Good afternoon, Good evening! (Everyone gets their copy of
 DemoNews at a different time in the day. :) Anyways, after reading DN 82, I
 was oddly inspired to attempt to compile a "what's in, what's out" list,
 for some reason. A fashion guide, if you will, for the demo world.

 Last Saturday evening, I was wasting time on IRC on the #trax channel (as I
 often do) and knowing that my views alone should not attempt to describe
 the demo world's opinions, I asked others if they wanted to help with the
 list. I was able to con Musicman and Blackwolf into helping me with it.
 Therefore, the list below is a result of the mismatched personalities of
 the three of us, who came up with the majority of the list, and a few
 others who helped some, but I can't remember anyone else from that evening.
 (Next week, maybe I'll publish my hate mail!)

 We hope this list is informational, helpful, yeah yeah, whatever. At least,
 if you can't stay on IRC through all hours of the night and pick up the hot
 juicy info, we'll find some losers who can and get the info from them.
 Wait, I can speak for myself, but the rest of the guys who helped might be
 a little ticked with that. Anyways! Uh, thanks for reading. :)

_____Bizarre (the untold story)

 a. BIZARRE was originally started by Whistler and Einstein. Later Soundwave
    and Omega joined them. AcmE and Hypnosis produced the intros, but didn't
    do any organizing. Dream Syndicate wasn't involved at all! (The fact
    that Soundwave was in DS, doesn't mean anything at all, and is pure
    coincidence)

 b. AcmE and Hypnosis told everybody they would organize Bizarre'95, or at
    least everybody thought so. But they cancelled their involvement because
    of other plans.

 c. Because of lack of time, Einstein, Whistler and Omega (all three from
    Mega Industries) cancelled their involvement in Bizarre'95. This means
    that Soundwave was the only one left.

    The staff as it is now:
     - Soundwave, Virus and Badvibes. (all individuals, no group!)
     - Spirit

 d. About Bizarre'95: Nothing is 100% sure, but:
     - It WILL be there.
     - It will be 100% PC only
     - It'll be better than Bizarre '94.

_____Virus in Inertia Player

 I saw in the last DemoNews issue that Inertia Player Asm'94 CD edition has
 been uploaded to Hornet. Among many bugfixes, this version contains a very
 nasty bug.

 Basically: the setup program (isetup.exe) is a Tai-Pan virus dropper, which
 means that from running isetup until rebooting all EXE files (smaller than
 64 Kbytes) will be infected with Tai-Pan virus. This is a humble virus,
 doesn't cause any damage, just copies itself to EXE files like crazy.

 Most of viruskillers can't recognize that isetup is infected because the
 virus was Pklited with the original isetup. Fprot 2.16 can eliminate
 Tai-Pan from infected EXE files but can't kick it out from isetup.exe ('coz
 the virus is compressed with the original program as I mentioned above).

 So the safe way to use isetup: run it, save the configuration, and reboot
 the machine immediately before starting any other program.

 Future releases of Assembly'94 CD will have this bug fixed.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 When should You ignore this letter :)

   1. Someone included a similar textfile for the player.
   2. Bug has been fixed already.


 Virus writers will burn in the hell's deepest wells!
	(Ayye, this sounds clerical, but I hope it will be... ;)

_____Introducing GraveDigger

 Greetings! This is GraveDigger, and I thought I should introduce myself a
 bit. Ryan Cramer's been recently preoccupied with schoolwork, so I'm trying
 to cover the music scene for DemoNews in his absence.

 A lot of you don't know who I am, so I thought this would be a good time
 for a brief introduction. Or rather, it would have been a good time a few
 issues ago, but, anyways..
 
 The first issue of DN i saw was 73.. I believe Phoenix sent it to me in DCC
 while on IRC. A few weeks later, KFMF released their musicdisk,
 "Trancescrambled," and wanted a review for it written up in DN. I
 volunteered to do it, and my first article appeared in DN 78. Having
 quickly developed an interest in DN, I asked Snowman about my possibly
 doing more articles for DN. He encouraged me to continue writing, and this
 prompted my NAID survival guide article, as well as an interview with
 Maelcum of KFMF.

 So at last, a personal dream is realized for me. Back in mid 1992, I went
 to a friend's house, where there was a crowd of 10 or so people. I did not
 realize at the time what the night had in store for me. Back then, I was a
 C64 owner and user, and had no real desire or interest in IBM-compatible
 systems. That night, however, through a louder-than-necessary soundsystem,
 and on a friend's 486, I witnessed Future Crew's "Panic" trackdemo. Not
 many days after this event, I was trying to figure out how I could get an
 IBM of my own. I was amazed at the quality of the graphics and music of
 "Panic," compared to the demos I was used to on my C64.

 Around the beginning of 1994, after I had been an IBM user for a few
 months, Future Crew released three musicdisks and their composing program,
 "Scream Tracker." I personally became interested in tracking after a local
 band named "Zadoc" released a MOD of one of their songs, hoping to attract
 a more diverse audience through a different medium. I soon got a copy of
 ModEdit, and my first experiment with it was a bass line with occasional
 bassdrum hits. I played it for a friend once, and he said "It sounds like
 techno." I replied: "Yeah, I guess that's all this is good for, really."

 Frustrated with the interface of ModEdit, I checked out Renaissance's
 MultiTracker, and just couldn't get the hang of it. Then, I got Scream
 Tracker. My first realization was "My samples sound corrupted!" This was
 soon fixed though by Phoenix's SAM-to-SMP conversion program, a program I
 owe my tracking to.

 So there I was, around Spring 1994, interested in the IBM demo scene and
 trying to compose as well. However, I found it difficult to find out what
 was really going on in Finland and Europe as I sat on this side of the
 puddle. What new demos were coming out? Where can I find these demos?

 Then, like a voice from heaven, DemoNews found its way to me. It soon
 became obvious that DemoNews was the link that holds the chain together:
 the latest uploads to the main demo site, Hornet; reviews of releases; news
 on demo competitions; interviews; it was all there.

 DemoNews brought me much closer to the demo world than I thought I would
 ever be. It is my hopes that DN can reach out to others and bring them
 closer, as it did for me. The entire staff of Hornet deserves a great deal
 of appreciation, for all that they do, and of course, Snowman, for making
 it happen every Sunday morning.

_____Help Wanted Advertising Section

 Hello, this is GraveDigger (not again!?) with a new feature for DemoNews.
 This is the "Help Wanted" section, much like a "Classified" section in a
 newspaper. 

 The idea of this section is for groups who are looking for certain talents
 can submit a message asking for such a person, and hopefully, will be able
 to contact someone who can help them out. Here's an example:

 "Hey guys! Can anyone code out there? I'm in this PC music group and we need
 someone who would be interested in coding a musicdisk player for us! We have
 a lot of music we want to release, and would like a player for it. If you
 are interested, please mail me (Zer0/Defiance) at: zero@host.yab.com
 Thanks!"

 What you should do, in submitting such an article, is follow these few basic
 guidelines:

 1 - Identify yourself at some point
 2 - Give an Email address
 3 - Make a request for a specific talent (coder, gfx artist, etc)
 4 - Explain what the person is needed for

 Hopefully, this section will help people find each other more easily. Plus, 
 it will save many students wasted hours on IRC looking for people. :)

 Here are the rules for submitting an article for this section:

 1 - Use 'DemoNews Help Wanted Ad' for your subject line
 2 - Send your article in plain text form
 3 - Mail it to digger@freeside.scsd.k12.ny.us
 4 - To get it in that Sunday's copy of DemoNews, I need to have it no later
     than the preceeding Friday, at 4pm EST. 
 5 - Please only send it once. If you do not see it in that week's issue of
     DemoNews, wait for the next week's. If it's not in there either, then 
     you may send it again.

 Thanks! Hope this section will be helpful to you. The sooner you get your 
 articles in, the better!

_____How to Get 'em

 After reading this issue of DemoNews, you may be wondering how you can get
 previous ones.  Well fear not!  There are two different ways to do so:

 1: FTP to hornet.eng.ufl.edu and go to /pub/msdos/demos/news/OLD_NEWS and
    start downloading anything you see.

 2: Now you can request back issues of DemoNews via e-mail.  Start a letter
    to listserver@oliver.sun.ac.za (any subject line) and in the body of the
    letter include "get demuan-list <index>" where INDEX refers to the
    index number of the issue.

    For example:  get demuan-list 55

    This would retrieve DemoNews #80

    For more recent issues that are split into multiple parts, you must send
    an individual request for each index number.
