GENERAL STUFF
*************

Lots of ANSI stuff was uploaded this past week.  Of course, now that the
ANSI directory takes up 100 MEGS of space on this site we are probably
going to have to sixth (delete) some of the old stuff.  I will try to
make provisions with some/all of the mirrored sites to see if they 
would be willing to keep the older stuff before I delete anything.  But
be warned that the deleting may start soon as we only have 25 Megs of
free space currently.  Maybe someone out there could DONATE a GIG hard
drive for this site and this would not have to happen.  Hey, they cost
less than a grand now.

GUS & SB16:

I recently got a SB16 w/ SCSI for my computer and have been trying to 
configure it for the best results.  So far the best I have come up with is:

SB16  IRQ 7, I/O 220, DMA 1, DMA 5  | MIDI I/O 300 | SCSI I/O 340, IRQ 10
GUS   IRQ 11, I/O 260, DMA 7, DMA 7 | MIDI I/O 330

Problems:  Goldplay seems to hate the SB16 on 240 (demos like JUMP, JUNGLY
KITCHEN failed on port 240).  But maybe it could be a result of the SCSI I/O.
PLUS, most demos like I/O 220, IRQ 7 as if it were the standard.
Some GUS demos aren't coded well enough to detect I/O 260 (all work on 220).

Does anyone have these two sound cards working together with few problems?
If so, please let me know -- dmw@eng.ufl.edu -- what setup you have.

SERIOUS:

2krad4u as most you know is a pretty lame demo--CGA/PC--but it does deliver
a pretty good message.  Are most demo coders too serious?  Well, this guy
believes so and I tend to agree with him.  Wheres TWILIGHT ZONE and those
funny demos to break the ice every now and then...ahhh, lighten up.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION (all information taken from CC1 Rules):
 
          Composers Competition 1 was a competition for computer musi-
     cians to enter their tunes and have them judged.  The contest was
     announced around February 14th of 1994.
 
     Composers Competition was produced by:
 
        Mike Phillips (digoxy@metronet.com)  - Digital Oxygene BBS (WHQ)
        Rob Butler    (musicon@metronet.com) - Music Connection BBS
 
     The winners were promised the following prizes:
 
        A Gravis Ultrasound compliments of Advanced Gravis
        2 free versions of Multi-Track Module Editor, manual and disks.
        2 free versions of Farandole Composer, manual and disks.
        3 free one year subscriptions to Digital Oxygene
        3 free one year subscriptions to The Music Connection
 
     The judges were:
 
        Abyss, Purple Motion, and Skaven of FUTURE CREW
        C.C.Catch, Daredevil, and StarScream of RENAISSANCE
        Mr. Etch and Neon of BLACK DESIGN
        Alexander Poelma and Jendrik Posche of WITAN
        Darkness, NIC, and Zodiak of CASCADA
        Mike Phillips, sysop of Digital Oxygene
        Rob Butler, sysop of Music Connection
 
     Rule #9:
 
        "All entries must be on one of the official drop off sites
        before May 15th, 1994.  Any entries received after this date
        will not be considered"
 
(NOTE)
 
          Before I continue, I think it only fair to advise you of my
     own personal experience with Composers Competition.  I hosted
     Music Contest 1 in late 1993 and Mike Phillips was my right hand
     man.  He secretly planned Composers Competition in early 1994, and
     put me in a very difficult decision.  I could either join him and
     help with CC1, or I could continue with my Music Contest ][.  For
     better or for worse, I decided to go ahead with MC][.
          Because I was upset with Mike for doing Composer Competition,
     shortly before CC1 was announced, I released a lengthy text file
     to the general public stating how I felt about the situation.  I
     now regret some of the words I used, but the sentiment still
     remains.
          I am in NO WAY connected with Composer Competition.  I was
     opposed to it from the start.  I write this article only as a
     service to the demo community.  Another motivation for my writing
     this article is that it has grown tiresome to have to keep
     answering letters about Mike's contest.  I will do my best to
     remain neutral in this issue and just present the FACTS.
 
MAIN ARTICLE:
 
--PROBLEMS--
 
     1. By the time you read this article, Composers Competition will
          have been over just shy of 2 months; and 2 months is an
          unacceptably long period of time to process the voting.
     2. The World Headquarters for CC1 has closed its doors forever on
          June 16th, 1994.  Digital Oxygene BBS has shut down perman-
          ently.
     3. Until the results for CC1 are in, there is a little question
          as to who has the GUS that was offered as 1st prize.
          Further, I wonder if Mike can be held LEGALLY ACCOUNTABLE
          for keeping the GUS since he copyrighted the contest...
 
--INFORMATION--
 
Interview with Mike Phillips:
 
          On Sunday July 3rd, I called Mike Phillips to get to the heart
     of this story.  The conversation is loosely paraphrased below:
 
     SM: Hello this is Snowman, is Mike Phillips there?
     MP: Yes, this is Mike Phillips.  What can I do for you?
     SM: I am calling to inquire as to when we can expect the results
         of Composers Competition to be in.
     MP: Well, we're still waiting on a couple of voting forms.
     SM: May I ask which groups havn't turned them in yet?
     MP: Renaissance and Future Crew.
     SM: So you mean Skaven, Purple Motion, Ryan Cramer, and C.C.Catch?
     MP: That would be correct.
     SM: And when are they supposed to have the forms to you?
     MP: Well, we were trying to get them by the end of this week.
     SM: Thank you.  Goodbye.
     MP: Goodbye.
 
          Now, it did note occur to me until later that Ryan Cramer was
     not one of the judges for CC1, but I figure that both Mike and I
     forgot that fact while we were talking.  However, I still called
     Ryan to discuss the situation.  Ryan did not have much more to add.
 
          Then I called C.C.Catch, but he wasn't home and I have not
     called back...
 
Mike's Mail:
 
          It occured to me that I might check out and see when Mike
     Phillips was last on Internet.  I did what is called a "finger"
     which tells you when someone was last logged on.  The response is
     below:
 
     [Snowman] : > finger digoxy@metronet.com
     [metronet.com]
     Login name: digoxy                      In real life: Mike Phillips
     Directory: /v/digoxy                    Shell: /bin/csh
     Last login Sat Apr 23 15:42 on tty2906
                    ^^^^^^
 
          Then I thought I would do a "date" just show you when I was
     online:
 
     [Snowman] : > date
     Tue Jul  5 23:25:13 EDT 1994
 
          Now, I am not a mathematician, but it seems to me that Mike
     has not checked for mail in over 2.5 months.  Since the last time
     he checked his mail was 3 weeks before the end of the contest, we
     can deduce that he does NOT collect voting forms through Internet.
          If we put this together with the fact that his BBS went down,
     we must wonder how he gets mail (including voting forms) at all.
 
Why did Digital Oxygene BBS Close?:
 
          I have been told by a reliable source that Mike Phillips
     closed Digital Oxygene in order to spend more time with his family.
     Also, through talking to him, it appears that he is very busy with
     his job, and has other obligations attend to.
 
          Much of the hardware from the now-defunct Digital Oxygene has
     been relocated to Music Connection BBS (also in Texas).  This is a
     pity, for it seemed that the old rivalry between Music Connection
     BBS and Digital Oxygene BBS caused the sysops of each board to work
     much harder at providing a better system for the user.  I have con-
     fidence that Rob Butler (sysop of Music Connection) will not rest
     too long on his laurels, but will continue to provide a wonderful
     service to the demo community.
 
--SUMMARY--
 
          You have been presented with a lot of information regarding
     Composers Competition(c).  If you are one of the many persons who
     contributed a song to the competition, you may be feeling a bit
     upset right now.  I can not tell you that the results will never
     come out.  I CAN tell you that it would be reasonable to assume
     they probably won't.  However, I could be mistaken and they might
     appear tomorrow.  (I'm trying to cover my ass so you can't tell
     me I'm wrong :)
          When a contest is poorly organized, things like this will
     happen.
          In the mean time, I would all like you to download MY entry
     into Composers Competition.  Yes, its a little late, but just go
     download it (/pub/msdos/demos/incoming/_1dand.zip).

SHIT TALK
%$%$%$%$%

Well folks, last week we had some pretty serious LIGHTNING and my PHONE
and MODEM got caught in the crossfire (i.e. they both broke).  The sad
part is the computer was off and the phone uses batteries.  I guess it
goes to show ya that the $40 surge supressor is shit without a phone
line protector.  Previous to this experience I have only lost two computers
to LIGHTNING but hey, this is FLORIDA and that is expected.  The moral
of the story is INVEST the $30 - $100 in a GOOD surge protector that works
with the POWER and the TELEPHONE.  I always thought a modem could'nt be
destroyed via the telephone line and if it could it would not happen to me.
Well, now I have PROOF and seeing IS believing.

Regarding the CD ROM that will contain DEMOS and digital audio from MC][ I
would like to know what people think about having all the files using
the same compression.  i.e. would you care if some files used .LZH while
others used .ZIP or do you think it would be better to have ALL the files
in ONE format--namely ZIP.

We are still looking for ART to be included ON or in with the CD ROM.

Woops, some files did not have READ access on this site due to a recent
"chown" command by the sysadm.  I believe I corrected the problem in all
the directorys with the exception of the MUSIC directory. chown - R 644 */*.*
did the trick...at least one level deep.

Hey, can anyone out there get me some chewing gum called "BLACKJACK."  I
am interested in trying something different as all I ever see around here
is the BIG name brands.  I heard the name of the gum in an excellent MOVIE.

SHOWS & STUFF:

SIGGRAPH (ftp siggraph.org for more info) is happening the week of the 
Morrison v. Williams fight (I had to throw that in there).  Oh, that is
the 24th through 29th of July in case you didn't know.  This is a BIG
graphics convention with companies like PIXAR (cool animation movies) and
others showing off VR and graphics.  Location is ORLANDO which is 3.5 hours
north of where I live.  Is anyone out there going?  Can anyone out there
get reduced ticket prices for me or anyone else into the demo scene?

WOODSTOCK '94:  Happening August 13 & 14 somewhere in NEW YORK with about
20+ bands--some cool groups too.  Anyone going to this show?  This may be
worth the plane trip.  

INFO@HOPE.NET:   OF course if you go to WOODSTOCK then you will
miss HOPE--The first US Hacker Congress--which is happening in New York
City on the 13th and 14th also.  Bad timing guys.  HOPE (Hackers On
Planet Earth) makes a great location for a DEMO party.  Maybe it can
be arranged--Anyone, Anyone.

DEAD AT 21 or whatever.  The NEW MTV show appears Wed nights and Sat 
mornings (10pm, 10:30am).  I highly recommend it on the MUSIC alone--
tons of excellent music (depending on your taste though).  The concept
is also pretty hip.  So Check it OUT.

This newsletter reaches many people. IF YOU have anything you want to
say feel free to drop me a line.  We are especially interested in upcoming
releases and demo group info.
