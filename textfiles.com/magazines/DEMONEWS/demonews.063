==============================================================================
(GENERAL)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I had a complete hard drive failure last Thursday.  This was a direct result
of a nasty virus.  I have no tape backup, and I had been using my old 40
MEG drive to store backups on.  Unfortunately, this hard drive was also hit
by the virus.  As a result of this, I have lost all the songs I have ever
written (save the 2 songs for the mc2final intro and the Escape intro).  I
also lost my entire sample library, so it looks like I won't be writing any
new songs for a while.

I will hopefully get some data off of my 40 MEG drive after sending it away
for data recovery.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MUSIC CONTEST 2 UPDATE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The results are in!

By the time you get this newsletter, the final results should be released.
You can find them at /pub/msdos/demos/incoming/mc2 under mc2final.zip.  This
is on ftp.eng.ufl.edu of course.

As a result of my hard drive crash (see GENERAL above), the 1st place rookie
prize will have to be either changed or delayed.  I will contact the winner
and see what to do.

==============================================================================
((Section 5...ESCAPE Demo/Music CD))
==============================================================================

Check /pub/msdos/demos/incoming/democd for UPDATES and information.
(i.e. More information, cost, how to get the DEMO/MC][ CD)

We are down to the final week of work for the CD...we could really use
help in the areas below if we want to get this out mid October.

ART

We could still use art by you talented artist out there.  Too bad not
many of you are willing to donate a little time to help our little CD
project.  The art/text will all get put together this week so if you
do have something to submit get it to me ASAP--dmw@eng.ufl.edu.

LAST CALL

Last call for demos is SEPT 27-28 if you want your production on the
DEMO/MUSIC CD--ESCAPE.  This is mostly a call for newer/rare demos we do
not have which people may not have uploaded.  

MUSIC CONNECTION

Can anyone lone me a username/password as I have the lowest status on
the board with a 25/1 ratio.  I need to capture about 7 megs of files 
including the ones below.  Maybe some of you can help me out since I
could not get ROB B. to raise my access.  Don't expect much (if any)
of the stuff below to appear if I can not get another password.

Mike
++++

some probs while reviewing demos:

 * No Lamers Allowed / Paranoids
   This demo was compressed 6 times(!) and one of the compressors caused crash
   every time I run it. So file called "nolamers.zip" is now changed (I
   uncompressed it and compressed only once ;), now it runs ok.
   + List of compressing programs on NoLamers.EXE:
      PKLITE V1.12, extra compression
      COMPACK 4.4 <------------------- this compression program caused crash
      LZEXE V0.91 or V1.00a
      DIET V1.02b, V1.10a or V1.20
      LZEXE V0.91 or V1.00a
      PKLITE V1.12, extra compression
 * BEATY16 finaly deleted from demo-list
   This demo is not avialable on demo site, so I don't see any reason to keep
   this entry in DEMO-LIST.
