INCOMING
========
-Startrek is a demo with digitized sound and pictures from TNG show.
-Sonic-a is an intro with 640x480 graphics and interesting music.
-tcb-xmas is a Christmas demo with many parts...many not related to x-mas
-Delta1&2 are two small demos that both have rotating objects.  There is
 no music only some PC speaker clicking.

-The new (11) arrivals will be updated in a few days.
============                            
OLD INCOMING
============

-Look at the dates (ls -ld) for the newest files.

======================
WHAT ABOUT OTHER DEMOS
======================

Check out the WANT.LIST for demos to look for and upload.  Hopefully
someone out there is local to THE MUSIC CHANNEL BBS and can up some of
those demos here.

I am looking for the email address of the person--DOGER--who did CHAOS3D.
Does anyone out there know it?  Who is it that seems to be uploading it
everywhere?  The copy out there does not seem to work with music so...

UPLOAD new demos to the /pub/incoming/demos DIRECTORY.

ANSI  CONTEST
=-=-=-=-=-=-=

We now have TWO ANSI files which I can choose between to tack onto the demos
received here.  It would be nice to have a couple more.  So, if anyone
wants to go ahead and design a ANSI .COM file and send it my way.

==================
MIRROR SITE UPDATE
==================

The attempt (or should I say battle) to get a mirror site continues.  No
one every seems to reply to my questions/request so there is not much I can
do but wait.  If YOU run a site perhaps you can do a MIRROR.  Anyways...

There are no mirror sites yet but...  Here are some sites I think would be
nice:  ftp.cis.ksu.edu (7.5Kb/s), archive.umich.edu (8.2Kb/s), 128.36.21.1
(12.7Kb/s), ftp.ulowell.edu (12.? Kb/s).  Of course only ONE is necessary 
for the USofA.  What about Europeans transferring at .5k and below?  
Well, if you want to solve a problem then do something about it!  
If you want to transfer faster (and I know everyone does) then find a site 
that will want to mirror this place, tell me, and we will arrange things.


=========
WHAT'S UP 
=========

-The influx of demos has been slow recently and I am not sure why. 
 However, a few people (I won't name names) will be uploading some
 stuff.  It seems to me a lot of people have demos but just do not want
 to take the time to upload.  Go figure.  I guess thats the way it is.
-The ABOUT.DEMOS file gives a general description of the demos here.  I update
 it when possible--just do a "ls -ld" to see the date the file was updated.
-Remember to type "get DEMO.NEWS_? -" if you want to read these text files
 while on line.  Only and idiot would do that with something like UNREAL--
 please don't try to read a binary (.zip,.exe,.lzh,.arj) file while online!
-For those who can't wait to get a new demo remember you can always go into
 the pub/incoming/demos directory for the newest arrivals.  However, be 
 forewarned that if there is a problem with a demo there (i.e. virus,
 trojan) I will not be held responsible.
