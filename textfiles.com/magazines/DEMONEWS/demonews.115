=---------------------------------------------------[Introduction]--[Snowman]-=

 Hello all, and welcome to DemoNews issue 115.

 This issue was set to go last Sunday.  I was asked to delay it a day which
 unfortunately pushed me past the weekend (the time I can most easily work
 on these things).  Now you are going to get two issues of DemoNews within 3
 days of each other.

 Kiwidog's second article on 3D graphics programming would not fit in this
 issue but will be back in DemoNews.116.

 If anyone wants to help out with the /pub/games archive, just mail
 mikel@cdrom.com.  He is one of my coworkers and doesn't seem to have a
 widely read newsletter of his own to make the advertisement.  :)

 The reviewed demo with the most groovy music this week is definitely
 "Twisted" from the OZ 96 demo party.  Check it out.

 We are now in the process of organizing a demo CD.  This will contain as
 many productions as we can get permissions for and will be sold for the
 first time at NAID. Note that at over 2 gigs, our site would require 4 CD's
 to make a copy.  As such, we will be focusing on a more limited area (the
 demos) as an early project.  Here's the deal simply put: if you give us
 permission to put your demo on the CD, we'll give you a free one.  We sell
 the CD's, I gain nothing extra over my normal paycheck, the scene is happy
 and we can all live on a big happy storage device.  Look for a more
 in-depth article from me in the future about this.

 Our /incoming directory has been under attack!  :)  I personally have
 reviewed and moved 60 of the 300 megs in there this past week.  Our whole
 team is working to bring the size under 50 megs.  Yes folks, the day of
 telling others that your song is in /incoming/music/songs/xm are over.  My
 goal is to (by April) have things efficient enough so no files remain in
 /incoming longer than 2 weeks.

 Take care.

=--------------------------[Editorial: The "Tonbal Tes" Threshold]--[Snowman]-=

 _____Introduction

 3520 music downloads are made on a normal ftp.cdrom.com day, 36 gigs
 grabbed in a normal month.  I've seen directories go from /music, to
 /music/mod, to /music/mod/a, to /music/1996/mod/a.  More than likely we'll
 have something like /music/1997/jan/mod/a if previous growth is any
 indicator.  It's pretty difficult finding resources to maintain and manage
 such a volatile archive, but somehow we get by.

 _____Yesterday

 When the directory was just /music, the year was 1992 and our archive was
 very small.  It was a happy little archive that just chugged along a day at
 a time, growing bit by bit. Sometime around 1994 the demo scene really
 discovered the net as a means of communication and file-sharing.  The happy
 little archive was about ready to bust its pants, being capped by a 400meg
 imposed barrier.

 _____Today

 Boom!  In March of 1995 the archive moves from ftp.eng.ufl.edu to
 ftp.cdrom.com.  Growth is unrestricted. The site is upgraded to a P6-150
 with 256megs of RAM and 72gigs of storage.  Many people (including myself)
 start ordering faster ISDN 128k lines to their homes to increase access
 speed.  The number of people actively maintaining the site jumps from 2 to
 12.  Meanwhile, the happy hungry archive devours file after file,
 increasing from 400meg to 2000meg in about 10 months.

 _____Tomorrow

 Now I want to scare you a little bit.

 Let's look at August of '97, about 20 months from now.  Based on current
 growth, our archive will probably be running a P7-400 with a gig or two of
 RAM.  Don't worry, by 1997 that won't sound sound quite as fast.  There
 will probably be around 300 people actively maintaining our site (a very
 small percentage of the demo scene at that time).  Our site would weigh in
 at about 50gigs.  But don't worry, by 1997 that too won't sound quite as
 impressive.  616000 music files will be downloaded and 1500 uploaded each
 and every week.  Unlike the other statistics mentioned, that last one is
 non-trivial.

 _____Inspiration and Definition

 I don't usually write editorials anymore.  Not much inspires me.  A week or
 so ago, Trixter told me that there had been some article in TraxWeekly #43
 about our ratings.  He wanted to write a response.  Sounded good to me.
 Jim's very good at that sort of thing.

 Then TraxWeekly #44 rolls around a couple of days ago.  I note that about
 half of the articles deal in some way with ratings.  <sigh>  Tonight I
 finally sat down with a big cup of coffee to read over the newsletter. A
 short while later, I was inspired.

 Q: Why is music rated?
 A: To save some of the scene a lot of time.

 How does reviewing songs save the scene time?  Well, with 60 songs uploaded
 a week very few people have the time to download and listen to them all
 (though it is still possible to do).  By 1997, you will have to listen to
 36 new songs every hour of every day if you want to be completely fair to
 everyone.  Unless the average length of a song drops to about 1 minute and
 42 seconds, this will be completely and utterly impossible.  Though these
 statistics are only based on current growth and may be significantly off,
 the "Threshold Of Not Being Able To Listen to Every Song" (Tonbal Tes) will
 come, and it will come soon.

 The "Tonbal Tes Threshold" is very important!  I can't stress that enough.
 When it is reached, everyone must be selective in what they download.

 Let's say that of all songs out there, you only like about 5% of them. By
 August of 1997, that means you would like about 11 songs uploaded to our
 site each day.  But what about the other 200 that you don't like?  By the
 Tonbal Tes Threshold, you already know you can't download all of them and
 find just the ones you like.  Even trying to "quick preview" all songs will
 soon be out of the question.

 _____Options

 Fortunately, you have several options open.

 Option 1: Random Downloading

 Cons - You are downloading a lot of poorly-written music.
 Pros - You can get a warm fuzzy, knowing that you are politically correct
        and being completely fair to all musicians out there.

 Option 2: Downloading by Author

 Cons - You are being unfair to other musicians.  Difficult to find new
        authors you like without doing a lot of extra unpleasant listening.
 Pros - You can consistently get music that you like.

 Option 3: Word of Mouth

 Cons - Other people are not you and won't always guess the type of music
        you like.  There are still about 80 songs a week to get.  How much
        "word of mouth" time are you willing to allocate?
 Pros - A group of people are out there looking for the type of music that
        interests you most.  You can get a fair amount of it.

 Option 4: Reviews

 Cons - Ratings are subjective, and only reflect the opinion of the reviewer
        or reviewers.  Not very accurate at times.
 Pros - Very quick to read and use (capability for automation).

 These four options are not mutually exclusive.  What I mean to say is that
 you can use any combination of the four you like.  In fact, I would
 encourage using the last three.  That would probably yield the highest
 like-to-dislike download ratio.

 I believe however that in the coming years, the last option listed will be
 the most effective and efficient way for people to get the songs they want
 most.

 _____So Who Does the Rating?

 We do, and for several reasons.  First, we have a ready supply of incoming
 files.  Second, we have people dedicated enough to do it.  Third, we have a
 method of cataloging and distributing reviews.  Fourth, all of us view
 ratings as a good thing and are willing to put up with negative response
 from a significant portion of the scene.  And last, we have been reviewing
 for the past three years and have already established a process that has
 the ability to grow, change, and improve.
 
 _____Improving Ratings

 One of the easiest ways to increase the accuracy of ratings is simply to
 have multiple reviewers for every song.  The accuracy of ratings is
 directly proportional to the number of reviewers.  Trust me, I'd love to
 have all songs on our site judged the way songs were in Music Contest 3.
 Lack of manpower and resources prevents that.

 Suggestions have been made by the scene on how to improve our ratings. We
 once tried to categorize music so that people could download the type of
 music that interested them most.  Unfortunately, this system proved too
 difficult to implement correctly, consistently.  After many a complaint,
 categorizing music stopped.

 Automating the reviewing process allows the reviewers to rate more songs in
 less time.  Much work has been done in this area recently, though there is
 still more room for improvement.  Automation has lessened the time it takes
 for a reviewer to figure out: which songs he/she must review, get the
 songs, record the reviews, send them to Diablo, and post them in DemoNews.
 Think of this as trying to increase the throughput of all reviewers.

 There is a trend that distresses me a little bit.  I call it the impossible
 question.  "Why don't you just have five reviewers for each song?"  "Why
 don't you categorize songs based on style of music?"  "Why don't you write
 big paragraph descriptions about each song?"  The bottom line, the stopping
 block for almost all suggestions people make, is lack of workers.  We have
 finite resources and most suggestions that have been made are beyond our
 ability to implement.

 On one point I would like to clear something up.  There seems to be a
 misconception that a rating of ***** is given out frequently.  This is not
 so.  Furthermore, it is doubly hard to get a 5 star because the rating must
 be agreed upon by all members of Hornet.  There are currently 8 productions
 online with a 5-star rating: 4 demos and 4 songs.  We have files on our
 archive dating back to 1987, and so slightly less than 1 file per year is
 given *****.  I do not consider that to be excessive.
 
 As the Tonbal Tes Threshold approaches, we may actually be able to find
 enough people allocate more than one reviewer per song.  But try telling
 that to Diablo with over 200megs of unreviewed music sitting in /incoming
 and you might be inclined to think otherwise.  :)

 _____The Life of a Reviewer

 Reviewing music is difficult, time-consuming, and often tedious.  As a
 reviewer, you get to give up a night or two a week listening to often
 poorly-written songs.  Why not take a break and relax in #trax?  Oh no...
 you'll get into an argument with someone about reviews.  Maybe work on a
 song?  So how would you rate it?  Doh!  As a reviewer I'll bet that gets
 annoying.

 It isn't all bad though.  Each week you get to give Diablo a list of
 reviews.  You see them magically appear in DemoNews, and you know that a
 lot of people look at and rely on those reviews.  You are anonymous; no one
 knows which specific songs you reviewed.

 Something happens frequently that disturbs me: arguments in #trax.  An
 ineffective stress reliever for a music reviewer is going to #trax and
 having everyone argue about how unfair ratings are.  So please don't yell
 at the reviewers.  They didn't design the system.  They only implement it.
 Yell at Diablo and I.  We're the ones who maintain it.  Actually don't yell
 at Diablo (he has enough stress already).

 These reviewers aren't in the "Holy Order of Music Reviewers."  They don't
 sing chants and dance around floor carvings and candles.  They aren't Mr.
 Newbie who just discovered a .MOD file three months ago.  They are normal
 people who care enough about the future of the demo scene to do work that
 isn't always fun.  They are all part of a team working toward a tangible
 and realistic goal; to save some of the scene a lot of time.

 I respect and admire each one of them for their dedication.

 _____The Beauty of It All

 I encourage you to complain about our rating system.  How else are we going
 to find ways to improve it?  We can't very well carry off a project of this
 magnitude without some system of checks and balances.  We aren't very
 likely to stop rating, but we're more than willing to change if the change
 is reasonable and we have enough people to do it.

 For the past two weeks, TraxWeekly has provided an excellent ground on
 which to debate the music rating issue.  I would like to see more of it.

 _____Closing

 The Tonbal Tes Threshold is fast approaching.  Barring a plague, world
 cataclysmic event, or dramatic loss of interest in the demo scene, it will
 come in the next year.  I can only hope that this editorial has influenced
 the scene in some way.  Maybe someone out there now thinks "Well, I still
 don't like the ratings but I sort of see his point."  Maybe someone else
 is thinking "Hey, I think I'd like to be a reviewer."

 I'll be there is some nasty dude out there thinking "I'm going to quote
 parts of this editorial in TraxWeekly and respond to them publicly with
 my less thought-out comments, faulty logic, and incorrect facts.  Then
 everyone will love and respect me because they don't like ratings either.
 Also, I will have stood up to DemoNews and Hornet, meaning that I'll never
 get a good job when I grow up and my cat will hate me and the girl I like
 will talk to her friend about my acne."  Oh well, that's life I guess.
 Maybe Gene (the editor) won't like that guy.

 In his book (The Road Ahead), Bill Gates talked about a "positive feedback
 cycle."  Applied to ratings, it goes something like:

 1. More people like our ratings.
 3. More people become reviewers.
 4. Our ratings get better.
 5. Go back to step 1.

 Step 2 would of course be to contact us at the address below.

=--------------------------------[OS Candy and the Future of Demos]--[Finrod]-=

 _____Introduction

 There was a time when a computer was a computer, and a demo coder could
 rely on any computer of the same brand and model to behave exactly the
 same.  Those were the happy days of the Commodore 64, the Atari ST and the
 Amiga 500, when sound boards, SCSI disks, graphic accelerators and
 protected mode belonged in science fiction movies if anywhere at all.

 In those days you would stuff a tape in your reliable Datasette - the lucky
 ones would insert a floppy into their VIC 1541 or 1543 - load the demo and
 SYS it.  Or you would insert a disk into your Atari or Amiga, turn on the
 power, and watch it load and run.  But even the Commodore 64 had extension
 capabilities, under the cryptic name of IEEE/488 cartridges, and it was not
 unusual for a program to require one of these cartridges to run.

 Then came the era of the IBM compatible.  The original IBM PC had already
 been on the market for a year when the Commodore 64 came out, and to tell
 the truth, on a short term the Commodore was preferable: sixteen text-mode
 colors, high-resolution (320x200) graphics in black and white, multi-color
 bitmapped graphics in 160x200, three programmable FM synthesizers with nine
 full octaves of sound and four different wave types.

 But the IBM PC's power was its upgradability. Not counting the processor,
 how many of you have a hardware configuration which is 100%
 programmatically identical to that of the original PC as shipped in summer
 1981?  Most of you have serial ports with 16500 UARTs as opposed to 8250,
 3.5" floppy drives instead of 5.25" ones, IDE, EIDE or SCSI controllers and
 multi-gigabyte disks where even the luckiest PC owners only had 20 MB MFM
 disks, accelerated SVGA cards instead of the MDA and CGA standards which
 prevailed at that time.

 Not to mention hardware which nobody had even heard of back then, such as
 100 Mbps Fast Ethernet adapters, mice, digital sound cards, MPEG hardware
 CODECs, Hauppage WinTVs, or VR helmets.  Even the keyboards no longer
 behave the same (if your keyboard has an XT/AT selector, try switching it
 to XT mode and see if your AT compatible understands a shit) not to mention
 the 20 to 24 additional keys.

 Though a blessing for the demanding user, and a boost to manufacturers'
 inventivity, this upgradability soon became a curse for programmers.  The
 first symptom of that problem appeared with the coming of faster machines,
 such as 8 MHz XTs or 14 MHz ATs. Games written for PCs (anyone remember
 Lunar Lander, Space Invaders, Snake, Hardhat Mac?) no longer worked on XTs
 or ATs simply because they were too fast. So programmers had to find ways
 to make games independent of processor type and clock rate.

 Next they had to find ways to make games work on different graphics
 adapters (although IBM did their best to make new adapters backward
 compatible), in different memory configurations and from different drive
 configurations: single floppy, twin floppies, single floppy and Winchester
 - sorry, harddisk - or twin floppies and harddisk.  When the PC hit the
 scene three or four years ago there was no way you could boot from a demo
 disk. You had to rely on DOS, and if DOS was inadequate, then too bad.

 This soon became a real problem, because most of the time DOS *was*
 inadequate.  With all due respect to Microsoft, DOS may have been a good
 idea back in 1981 but it is not what I would call the OS of the future.
 DOS' major problem is its pathetic clutch on compatibility.  DOS wishes to
 remain compatible with hardware that is not even worthy to be used in PC
 throwing competitions at demo parties.

 DOS wishes to remain compatible with earlier versions which were written
 for hardware of which not a single chip remains in a modern computer.  DOS
 is the reason why we struggle with XMS, EMS and DOS extenders,
 eight-point-three, and paths which may not exceed 80 characters (yes, check
 your programming references buddies, DOS does not allow the complete drive,
 path and file name to exceed 80 characters).  DOS, my friends, is the OS of
 the past.

 Although many sceners will not agree with me, I believe that Microsoft has
 made a step in the right direction with Windows '95.  Long file names,
 32-bit applications and preemptive multitasking all speak in its favor. But
 Win95 still clutches to older DOS and Windows versions like a drowning ant
 to a straw.  Not that I do not appreciate still being able to run my 16-bit
 programs, but DOS 7.0 is still but the seventh version of DOS 1.0.

 And what are the alternatives?  Linux?  Yes, Linux is an excellent
 operating system, but it requires of its user an inacceptable level of
 technical insight. UNIX has never been nor claimed to be an adequate
 operating system for independent computers.  Linux will remain at best a
 curiosity, widely used amongst specialists and freaks, but unknown to most
 users.

 And Linux has features which consolidate its position as an operting
 system, but reduces its usefulness for the scene: it is safe, crash-proof,
 higly virtualized and compartimented, and therefore unusable for demos.
 Demos require direct, low-level, unrivaled access to the computer's
 hardware. Direct? you must ask the kernel for permission to access the I/O
 ports you need.  Low-level? Linux, like any other UNIX, virtualizes most of
 the hardware.  Unrivaled? try to prevent the user from switching to another
 virtual console while the demo is running.

 What about OS/2?  OS/2 is an excellent operating system, faster and more
 reliable than WinNT or Win95, which even allows applications such as games
 or demos to monopolize resources such as the screen or the sound hardware.
 And OS/2 has been around longer... But OS/2 is ugly, hard to administrate
 and not widely accepted. The graphical user interface looks like something
 the dog left on your doormat, and is hard to configure.  OS/2 is slow too
 boot, poorly documented, awkward of use, and more than a little buggy.
 Last but not least, there is practically no software for it. No wonder
 unopened OS/2 Warp CDs are $20-$30 apiece on the second-hand market.

 There are a few other alternatives which I will mention only shortly.
 386BSD, FreeBSD, AIX and other *NIX have the same disadvantages as Linux,
 and are even less widely used and known.  FreeDOS, DOS/NT (no relation with
 WinNT) and other attempts at creating freeware or PD versions of DOS
 obviously cannot be any better than the original which they are emulating.
 The same thing goes for PC-DOS, DR-DOS, and other commercial DOS clones,
 including network-specific operating systems.

 However, not all sceners and gamers are sitting passively and letting
 things happen.  There are at least three projects for better operating
 systems currently going on: EOS, Grail and DemOS.  EOS and Grail are game-
 oriented, whereas DemOS is scene-oriented.

 EOS, or the Entertainment Operating System, is being developed by a large
 and highly hierarchized team of coders, most of them rec.games.programmer
 subscribers, with the assistance of Scitech Software which provides them
 with an FTP site.

 From what information is available on the net (see the EOS homepage at
 http://205.162.182.160/cleo/eos, maintained by Cleo Saulnier), it seems to
 be a cross-breed of DOS and OS/2. It is single-user like DOS and
 multi-threaded like OS/2, can work on top of a DOS partition, and has the
 capability of allocating all system resources to a single program. It has
 some features which belong to neither DOS nor OS/2 however: 32-character
 file names, an I-node-based file system inspired by *NIX, several privilege
 levels not only for the OS kernel but also for applications, high
 modularity, and that nice little freeware stamp.

 At the time of this writing no preview or alphas have been released, though
 some source was by mistake made public some time ago. However it seems that
 since this incident the EOS team is twice as protective as before, so there
 is little hope of getting a glimpse of EOS in the near future.

 To the best of my knowledge there is no single person directing the EOS
 development effort. Grail however is more of a one-man venture: it is being
 developed by Lewis A. Sellers (lsellers@1stresource.com), who is also a
 member of the EOS team.  Information about Grail is available on the Grail
 homepage, http://www.1stresource.com/l/lsellers/grail.htm, but the site
 seems to be heavily bogged down and I have not been able to read any of
 this information in time for this article.  Even DemoNews has a deadline,
 you know...

 Like EOS, Grail is highly modular, and also highly object-oriented, which
 explains its modularity.  Lewis aims at a totally object-oriented OS where
 all programs, device drivers etc. are implemented as methods belonging to
 their respective data and devices.  Grail is also a multi-user system, or
 rather, as Lewis himself expresses it, "Grail provides for... multiple user
 profiles", a feature which allows you to "Restrict the kiddies from your
 porn subdirectories or your little brother from your asm source code"
 (sic).

 Also like EOS, no source or binaries have been released, though Lewis seems
 to be somewhat less paranoid than the EOS team, and has released some
 technical specifications, such as the Intel Structure Reference which
 details Grail's memory organization, and reveals amongst other things a
 scheme to access the file system with simple memory reads and writes, a
 trick achieved through paging. Grail uses a flat memory model with - as far
 as I can see from the specs - no separate address space for applications.
 The purpose of Grail is not so much to provide a fast OS for games and
 demos as to provide a robust and efficient API for multi-media
 applications, and easy access to all kinds of hardware.

 The DemOS project is the most recent of the three.  It saw the world when,
 after a discussion about OSes on comp.sys.ibm.pc.demos last december, Beren
 of Ewox (beren@infolink.no) gathered the names of the most active
 participants in the debate and, with some assistance from yours truly,
 contacted those people and build up a group of coders interested in the
 concept of a demo OS.

 Currently, about 15-20 people are registered as having joined the project
 in one capacity or another, although at this point less than half a dozen
 are actively involved in coding or planning.  Information about the project
 is available through a monthly newsletter posted on csipd and distributed
 on ftp.cdrom.com and all Hornet mirrors. The DemOS homepage is
 http://www.ifi.uio.no/~dag-erli/demos.

 DemOS (pronounce dem-oss, not demoze) is not UNIX, but it certainly is
 inspired by UNIX.  The file system is UNIX-like, with 255-character file
 names, soft links, index nodes and the works.  The OS itself is based on a
 microkernel architecture.  It boots through an LILO-like loader, OSLO,
 which in the shipping vesrion may, besides loading the kernel, provide a
 multi-boot capability.  The kernel itself does not load modules, but simply
 runs a program, typically a command interpreter.

 Module loading is done following a dynamic request/release scheme which
 allows unused modules to be released from memory.  Applications dynamically
 request or release modules which they do or do not require. Thus an
 intelligent shell can be configured to request a certain set of modules
 which the kernel will load, after which all applications requiring these
 modules will load much faster.

 The DemOS team also plans to define a standard API for graphics adapters
 (including GUI and 3D accelerators), sound boards (including wavetable
 boards such as the GUS series or the AWE32), and a wide range of other
 devices. Module specifications will be released with the first alphas to
 allow independent coders to program drivers which the DemOS team itself
 does not have resources to develop.

 However firmly their developers believe in them, EOS, Grail and DemOS are
 yet but dreams - dreams in the process of being realized, but dreams still.
 However, the people behind all three projects are experienced and
 resourceful programmers, and I believe that all three projects will go far
 beyond the beta stage. Who knows - maybe in five or ten years a majority of
 PC users will be running EOS, Grail or DemOS and not WinXX, OS/2 or Linux.
 A man can dream, can't he?

=-------------------------------------[Proba Generalna ][ Mini-Report]--[Maf]-=

 This party, also known as General Probe ][ was held on 28/29th of January
 1996 in Ostrowiec Sw., Poland.  It was a PC only party but some amiga
 sceners were also present.  Adrar Design were the organizers of this
 meeting.  Around 200 people attended it (there would be more but it was
 cold at that time in Poland)... There were some girls too.  The party place
 was a school.

 Party started in the morning but since I wasn't there at the beginning I
 don't know what was going on.  I heard some fun compos took place but later
 looking at mousepad-throwing (or something) fun-compo I wouldn't call it
 'funny'.  Maybe I didn't get it properly. (?!) The coolest party attraction
 were cakes looking like toruses shaded with castor-sugar for only $0.20.
 Mostly coders liked it... (oponki ruled! :)

 In the evening some compos started.  The first was 4 channel music compo.
 There were pretty good modules but unfortunately most of them were techno
 and additionally it was played loudly as hell so it was hard to survive.
 The same thing goes for multichannel modules.  It sounded pretty bad and
 noisy (too loud).  I'm still having a headache.

 Later on some other compos took place.  Because of the the big screen which
 was pretty lame (were there a party with good bigscreen?) most of gfx
 looked bad.  Raytracing and 4kb intro compo also took place but I won't
 write anything about it cause I was sleeping then.  After some time intro
 compo started.  There were around 6 or 7 entries.  Most of them had some
 standard stuff like phong/texture mapping and the like.  An intro by
 Amnesty ruled the compo (see it!).  Pulse's intro was also good.

 Then the demo compo started.  Around 12 demos were shown.  Most of them
 presented some standard fx like phong and the like.  There was no fancy
 one... A demo by a non-Polish group (Slovakian) - Mist, was also presented
 but unfortunately it  halted in the middle (the beginning was nice).  The
 compo machine was 486dx4-100mhz with GUS and SB.  Nobody complained...

 Yet before the demo and intro compo some other demos and intros were shown.
 In demos Reanimator ruled... in intros : JTX Lame 2 was the most liked.

 In general this party was a good one... Much better than a year ago (PG1).
 Most of people had fun (or at least I hope so).  There were also rumors
 about PG3.  Party releases should be available soon on internet. Check them
 out and have fun...

 That's all...

 Sorry for the shortness (for full results and bigger report have a look at
 Bad News #4 - to be releases pretty soon).
