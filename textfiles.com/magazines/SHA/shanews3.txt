   GERMAN DEFENCE SYSTEMS HIT BY SWEDISH HACKERS
   - Swedish Students Practiced -

      Swedish Students at the university have been trying to "get into" the
    West German secret defence systems. But the students were not out to
    get secret information, they were out to learn and play!
    The young Swedes actions have been looked into by the Swedish and the
    West German police together, as mentioned in the PROTOCOL 89 from 
    I.H.A. and now they are caught. During the last month of 1989, the 
    police managed to track them down to the university where they made the
    calls from (use their own phones = had to pay the phonebills, right?!).
    The students didn't manage to "get in", so it's probably not going
    to be a matter for the court. 
 
      This shows how good the West German defence-computer systems security
    is. They didn't manage to go that far into the system to find secret
    information and at the same time, the German system registred enough
    material on them to finally track them down. The Swedish police and 
    the German police co-operated (more on this in the PROTOCOL89.TXT file)
    with the Swedish police "ekorotel". As early as before christmas the
    Swedish police left their report to the West German police. Now they
    are waiting for the West german police to make suggestions on what to
    do. The back-story of this matter is found in the I.H.A. textfile
    from the yearly meeting (PROTOCOL 89) so I will not go into this here.
 
      It showed that during the practical ADB (Computer) - exercises there
    had developed some kind of sport, to enter computer-systems and try
    different computers security. Through testing how hard or easy it was
    to "get in" they measured their own knowledge. It was soon stated that
    this wasn't a question of illegal entries, but a lesson in computer
    security.
 
      "This case isn't anything that alarms us", says the Chief of the
    Swedish Police, Rolf Nilsson. No crime was made in this case.
