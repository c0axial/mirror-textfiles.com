                #hamsters - The fictional channel this took place on
                hamsters - Fictional term for people that hang 
                           out on #hamsters

        Disklaimer: All characters in this fictional story are 
                    fictional.  Any resemblance to real or other
                    fictional characters is purely unintentional.
                    Fictional (had to say it once more).

        The story:

        IG and Evilster were good friends at a college on the East 
Coast.  Every day they would hang out, messed with their 
computers, drank coffee, gossiped/talked, and had fun.  Since 
they both had computers, and both had net accounts, they both 
developed a sense of curiosity about the internet.  Sometime 
after activating their accounts, IG decided she wanted to get 
on IRC, and Evilster said "I'll get us there".  Two days later, 
they were both IRCing and having a great 'ole time.  
        Weeks passed, and they met a guy that seemed willing 
to help them out with some unix/irc_client problems (Enter 
DamnedHamster).  One night, the three of them sat in a channel and 
worked on the problem of compiling an IRC client for their 
home accounts, so they could easily access IRC without 
telneting.  All I could tell from conversation was, they were 
the only two people who wanted to IRC from their home 
accounts.  Both seemed pretty cool in general, and the 
challenge of getting a client running was quite fun.    
        As time passed, I found out that very few people from 
their college used their net accounts, and that those that did 
only used mail (roughly 15,000 accounts, never more than 100 
people on from their college at once).  I also found out, that 
they were basically the only two people from their college who 
knew of, and used IRC at all.  During these weeks of IRCing, 
IG had problems of all sorts.  Common sense eluded her in many 
cases which frustrated the hell out of her counterpart, which 
caused tension between them.
        The whole time this was going on, Evilster was becoming good
friends with all the people on #hamsters.  Feeling left out, IG
wanted to get in with a similiar group of hamsters.  It was a
matter of days before she became a class one info-whore.  Within
hours of hanging out with other hamsters, she had given her
password out to several of these hamsters in hopes of being
accepted, and learning more about this great hamster cage we
all live in. 
        If you don't know much about the net, and systems, and 
operating systems, let me fill you in on something.  As soon 
as a hamster has a new place to play, they explore their 
surroundings quite well.  They look for 'backdoors' to become 
the Big Hamster of the area, and eventually take 'Root' on a 
system.  Once IgnoGerbil had given her password out, several 
of these wiley hamsters invaded the system.  It took less than 
a day for her entire system to lose its security.  The whole 
time IG was handing her password out, Evilster was 
explaining the consequences of doing so.  Her response, "But I 
change it everyday!@#$".  Of course, we all know that once a 
hamster is in your room, he doesn't have to leave.  He often 
establishes other routes into the room.

        A month passes, Evilster moves away to live with 
DamnedHamster, IG feels left out, gives her password out to more 
hamsters, and things progress...

        During this month that passes, Evilster loses her 
account due to wiley hamsters.  Despite the loss of the 
account, she continues to use DamnedHamster's account to IRC and chat 
with the other hamsters.  During her process of 'learning' the 
ways of the hamster, IG decides to start teaching her sysadmin 
the same thing.  Sysadmin is quite upset at all the holes into 
his room, and spends time patching them up one at a time, only 
to discover(through mail from IgnoGerbil) that there are 
more holes.  IG also decides to inform the sysadmin, that 
Evilster and herself are the reason behind all the wiley 
hamsters invading the system.  By this time, even some warez puppies 
had root at their system.
        
        Current status in our story... Evilster is still out of her 
original account, IG has given her password to over 20 
hamsters, warez pups had taken root at the system, IG was in 
continual contact via email with 'Sysadmin', IG was still 
looking for a group of hamsters to play with.

        Throughout email contact, not only did IG inform the 
sysadmin of her own actions and associations, she also 
informed him of Evilster's habit of talking with hamsters.  Days 
later, IG informed 'Sysadmin' of certain other hamsters and 
their nicknames who were suspected of playing in the system.
The rodents of #hamsters caught wind of this and didn't like 
it.  IgnoGerbil soon found she wasn't liked in #hamsters, 
and became an outcast to their little world.  Word spread of 
her narcing to other hamsters in other channels, and soon, she 
was back chatting with old irc friends.
        The more word spread, the more outraged IG became.  
Here she was, wanting to be a hamster one day, but all the 
other hamsters hated her!@$!  Revenge came to her mind..So she 
mailed Evilster and threatened her several times, in various 
ways.  Everything from leaking her info, to narcing her 
more/again to 'Sysadmin'.  Evilster reminded IG that to do 
that would enrage the other hamsters, and they might get wiley 
in the system, and play rough. 

        And the story continues.. as each day passes, more of 
this story is written.. (ie: a sequel to this story maybe!)

        To sum up what IG narced on:
                Herself
                Her ex-best friend
                Her ex-best friend's boyfriend
                Denizens of #hamsters
                Various other hamsters by name
                Different holes into their realm

        Just for reference, 'Sysadmin' has always hated IRC 
for various reasons.  Because of the troubles IG has brought 
from IRC, he is currently using some wierd thing called 'Dee 
En Are' on indials to their realm.  He is also monitoring all 
mail in and out of various accounts, carefully watching the 
logs, and still staying in touch with his favorite narc.

        I beg you fellow hamsters.. flee to a different realm, 
frolic in other pastures rich with fresh grass and NO FUCKING 
NARKS.
