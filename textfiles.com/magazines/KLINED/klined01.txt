        Welcome to the first, and certainly not the last, of 
an ongoing series of captures from IRC. If you don't know what 
IRC is, delete this file and shoot yourself in the foot. All 
of the releases from this zine will be various IRC captures, 
stories, or whatever else we want to put (irc related). These 
are meant to be fun, amusing, and a great way to spread lamers 
info. :)

        The general theme of this zine will tell people to 'go 
the hell away' and not IRC at all if they haven't. IRC is 
basically a fun waste of time, and a great source of amusement.
If you are an IRCer already, read and be amused. If you have 
never heard of IRc, never used it, and want to know more, let 
this be your argument NOT TO DO IT. IRC is evil. Of course the 
founders of this zine are evil so we hang there quite 
frequently. Do as we say, not as we do dammit. Grrr. Phear Us!@!

        We want you to know that none of us like IRC. We hate 
it. We only do it because we are self destructive elite people 
that want to set a shining example of what not to do. 


The founderz:    DeMoNiKa   <email@evil.hamster.com>
                 DisordeR   <damien@oppression.nsa.gov>
                 Mogelian   <mogel@hoe.org>


        Our objectives: To show you what kind of bizarre shit 
exists on various IRC channels. To show you how lame people 
can be. To show you what experienced users have to put up with 
while they IRC (yes, we suffer). To show you how we (the elite 
people) see you (depending).

        How to read our files: Most will end up as edited IRC 
logs. We will clean them up so they are readable, and take out 
excess crap. Sometimes, we will put our comments in [brackets] 
to voice our opinion on something.

        Where to get new files: Find one of us on IRC and we 
can DCC it to you. If you don't know what DCC is, delete this 
file and shoot yourself in the foot.

        Who can contribute: Anyone who has something neato for 
us to put in this zine. Any interesting log, 'whois info', 
conversation, takeovers, or whatever else. Basically, anything 
funny/neato but IRC related.

        Warning: These files may be- long, rude, insulting, 
boring, stupid, lame, cool, intense, or whatever else word you 
want to put there.
