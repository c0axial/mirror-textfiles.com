ATI. Activist Truth, Incomplete.
  A lot happened this week didn't it? Nevada Jan
gave some speeches, Leonardo Daprichio joined the
world of serious journalism, Carole King felt the
earth move under her 12" monitor, and a cerberus-
looking 3-headed puppet stole the show when nonviolent
protestors got clubbed like baby seals in a far off
land where there isn't much freedom, democracy &
just ice for all. A far off land called Colombia.
The district. Our nation's Crapitol. Where garbage
litters the streets like lawyers, lobbyists, and
lawyers who look like lobbyists sending letters to
presidents of major newzpeeps saying "please turn
your cameras off, we think it would be good for our
country," and other such abuses. 
  Pardon my french people, but thank farking god in
some place called Heaven that doesn't resemble
bipartisanland in any way shape or forking form that
these network newzprezs chose to ignore those letters
printing and showing the news anyhow. Where do these
people get off?
  Is the US Constitution a guideline? Is it
something to wipe my Republican fat white hairy
diaperwearing Quilted-Northern-rubbing butt on?

THE ONE WE FOUGHT TO PRESERVE. THE ONE WE PLEDGE OUR
LILY-WHITE APARTHEID ASSEMBLAGES TO! IT'S FADING FAST.
IT'S TURNING INTO BILL AND GEORGE'S EXCELLENT ADVANTAGE.
THE ONE WHERE MIAMI SECEDES, TEXAS KILLS TWO BLACK PEOPLE
A WEEK AND ARKANSAS KEEPS PUMPING OUT LECHEROUS VERMIN
like a rat factory. This is fear and loathing in the
good-ole-boy-you-S-of-A! Things are happening faster'n
you can say "how many taters can I grow in one fat head's
ear." Sure as flys on tarpaper, our union's falling apart
and the DOW and the NASDAQ just keep gyrating like Elvis
asking Nixon and the FBI if they want him to drum up some
conservatism to offset alla that N-ti-worshington protest.
  Please boycott the New York Times and World Bank bonds.
Get your city, your YMCA, your synagogue and your local
Taco Bell to boycott both too. And for God's sake if you
know anyone with diabetes, tell 'em to stay the heck away
from the new bread at Subway. They've doubled the amount
of sugar, doubled the amount of high fructose corn syrup
and added stuff I not only can't pronounce, but can't 
find explanations for on the entire world wide web. No 
lie, I asked Jeeves, Regis, Kathie Lee Gipper, and I
even called in a lifeline. Nada. Zilch, squelch, belch,
feck! Nothing. Things I can't pronounce. You'll please
to know there's less than 2% of each of THEM though. But
let me tell you, the white sugar is only third to flour
and water. Flour and water, people. The new bread. I'm
serious, now. Better dead, than the new bread. Tell your
self that. Better d... Well, better anything than dead,
I'd say. So don't go near it. Do a salad or something,
or the wheatbread. Maybe put out your hand and ask
for extra pickles, just pour it and moosh it in some
mustard, mayo and tuna-substance or something.
  Jubilee, mon. Joshua fought, them bones is shakin'
and them walls're come tumblin. Sunshine around for 
everyone soon. Revelation, revolution swift comin' to
you and a dogg named Abu. 
  Let me be completely unequivering here. I speak
pure prophecy now. Prayerful words and meditations of
my heart this moment. THERE IS NO STOPPING A CULTURE
OF NON-VIOLENCE.
  You will beat us down, we will keep getting back
up somehow. Stronger, more determined and more creative
than you'll ever expect. To say "you ain't seen nothing
yet," would be the understatement of the millenium.
Prague? LA? Philly? "We'll go where you go," you're
gon' have your hands full. 
  I'll end this rant with two questions.
Why has alt. section of usenet been heavily infiltrated
since April 16th??? I'm not talking two at a time - good
cop - bad cop - like old times. I'm talking the gang's
all here! Why? Why, why why?
  What does it serve you? And do you even know what alt.
stands for? Oh I guess that was more'n two questions, 
huh?
  Peace, love and birdhouse gourds,
Oh, and happy passover shabbot, and happy easter,
can you tell the difference between halloween and
easter candy anymore? Me either!

Keep spreading the good, peaceful message.

Dear Prime
In a recent poll one of the networks said
45% approved; and 44% disapproved. In the
fine print it said +/- 4%
  Doesn't that mean it could go either way?
Maybe if you could discuss this in your
numbers run?
  Thanks
Trish (Stat)

  [well, that's not exactly what #'s run is for
but we could tackle that right here. Eh? Thanks
for bringing this up. Consider what it means on
the surface. It could be as much as 49% approve
when as little as 40 will disapprove. And it can
almost swing exactly as far the other way and
they'd allow themselves to say the exact same
chart!
  Do you get the same feeling I do, Trish, that
this tells us almost nothing?
  Do you think someone's telling us what it is
we're supposed to "feel" like they're telling us???]

Hi.  I'm not a hacker, nor a reader/contributor.
I am, however, for the freedom of the individual,
which I suspect is very much in line with the hacker
credo.  I just wanted to commend those people I saw
joining the A16 protests against the IMF/World Bank
today in D.C., who were wearing "2600 - Hackers for
Freedom" T-shirts.
  Glad to see another group in the fight for freedom.
Lane (202)

HAPPY EASTER!
I hope your doing well. I found this cool site today
and just thought I'd send you a card.

Bye bye!

& Now, Part II of AK's Travel Saga

05.19
I slept in, took a shower, finished packing my bag.   As agreed yesterday I
called Wendell and he gave me a ride to the closest toll road entrance.
The Bristol entrance was around 15 miles away.  I arrived after 1:00pm.  I
had a sign that said 'WEST' made-up of a piece of paper on pizza box, a
little string, in black felt.  I started off trying to get a ride from the
cars coming from the South, before the actual entrance to the toll road
(and safely out  of sight of the toll road employee(s) - N 41 '44.267  W 85
'47.804 taken at 1:30pm).  My visibility and traffic was good and there was
a nice shoulder for cars (or trucks) to pull off, before they made the turn
into the toll road entrance.  The disadvantages of the location were that
most of the traffic (75%+) wasn't going on the toll road, so I was thumbing
a lot of vehicles who wouldn't even consider picking me up.  Also I was
missing all the vehicles (perhaps 1/3 of the total) who were coming from
the North.  Regardless of those factors I was offered a ride within four
minutes of starting!!!  That was extremely encouraging.  However since the
person was going on Michigan 12 (an East-West two laner) I turned them down
and changed my sign to "WEST TOLLROAD". Later on I was offered two other
rides by people going north, who must have not read my sign (?) so I
refused them.  After over an hour and a half of no luck, I wandered over to
the turnpike, but was told by an employee to stay off it.  So I took  up my
courage and hitched a couple hundred feet in front of the entrance (N 41
'44.329 W 85 '47.693 3:33pm).  Visibility was decent (not the best since
drivers were driving at a 90 degree angle), the shoulder was fair (traffic
had to slow anyways for the toll booth), and I'd maximised the number of
drivers that saw me.  After not too long (half an hour or so), a trucker
pulled over.  To my great joy he was going to Wisconsin (!!!), and since he
looked 'ok' I hopped in.  I'd waited about 2 hours and a quarter.

We took the long route (an extra 30 miles or so) to avoid the Chicago rush
hour.  We went West until 39 and then North to Rockford to rejoin 90.  By
8pm we were at N 41 '43.424  W 89 '00.424, stopped at a random truck stop
in nowhere particular.  We stopped once since their was a scales ahead for
the trucker to update his logbook (there's a big fine if they check and you
aren't current), and another time to find something related to paying gas.

The trucker was probably in his early 30s.  He had been driving since Long
Island and was going to near the Twin Cities, right on the Wisconsin /
Minnesota border.  His truck was a bit smaller than the typical semi, and
he said there was more money in driving smaller trucks.  There were six
packs of Marlboros on the dash.  Tapes and papers and pop bottles and more
strewn around.  He said the last trucker had left it a mess.
Self-described as crazy.  He listened to heavy metal and comedy tapes (some
Eddie Murphy and other material that was generally crude with lots of
swearing).  Though interestingly one of the tapes we listened to was by an
alternative Christian band, which he had a friend in who was dying (and in
a wheel chair).  He enjoyed making snide crude remarks on the CB.    Had a
small pin-up calendar (naked women) by the dash.  He was from LA and
half-Mexican (on his mom's side), had been stabbed six times - probably
because as he related, he would go on drinking binges and spend all his
money and get too violent for his friends when he went home.  His main goal
was to drive trucks until he was rich.  He claimed girlfriends in every
state he frequently drove to and used his cellular phone to talk to two
friends and to get a date from a sister of one of his best friend (an
African American - more proof that he was willing to transcend racial
barriers).   He wasn't allowed to drive in California due to a prior
accident and mentioned that some drivers deserved to get hit for their poor
driving (we did have one or two vehicles pull in front of us rather
dangerously).  He'd been driving a couple years and didn't own the rig.  He
had hitch-hiked before and that, combined with a general fearlessness, must
have been why he picked me up.  He offered me what he called a 'speed
pill', from a small container of them.  While cleaning up the truck he got
me to throw out the window some used drug paraphenalia which he said his
brother, a pot-head, had used last week in the truck.   He was generous and
offered me a meal, though I said I wasn't that hungry and had some food (as
I did).  He also tried to get me (and a person he was calling on his
cellular) to take a trucking job, as he or his company had a rig that
needed a driver and he was moderately persuaded that trucking was a good
profession (perhaps the money was the good in it).  He appeared to be a
little nervous agitated, like he was on some kind of substance to stay
awake.  But I never saw him take anything and he did a fine job driving.
Except for the stops (one to fill up with gas) we kept going and did a good
speed (a little over the limit).  It was tempting to stay with him through
Wisconsin, as we  would have arrived around Eau-Claire in the wee hours of
the morning, and it was great luck getting a good ride as my first one, but
I decided to chance it and got let off in Rockford, Illinois to surprise
visit a friend.

At 9:40pm he left me off at the first exit after we rejoined 90/94 (N 42
'16.255  W88 57.829).  Turns out the next exit would have been about a mile
closer.  I walked about 4 miles.  I was in a t-shirt and long pants, but
sweating because it was a lot of work carrying the backpack, especially up
hills.  I didn't have a map, so I used the GPS unit to figure out how far I
was and relied on memory to guess where to turn.  Fortunately I found the
roads where I needed them.  Krista's house was actually 500 feet away from
the predicted geocoded location, but I was able to find it by its address
(reading mailboxes in the dark with the illumination of the Garmin III
unit).  I arrived at her house at 10:55 (N 42 18.392  W 88 55.553).   She
wasn't home, but showed up later.  The most funny thing was that she'd
actually passed me while I was walking to her place, hadn't recognised me
(it was very dark) but had joked to her friends that it might be me since I
was hitching home!

I decided to try the northern route through  Canada, hoping to swing up to
Winnipeg and see a number of large Canadian cities and provinces that I
hadn't seen before.  I slept on a comfortable couch and washed my hair (all
of this time hitching I looked like a pretty "straight" kid - except for
the beard).

CONCERT REVIEW: SORT OF. By Marco

Indigenous played at Earthday. Great to see them again.
They're doing really well for themselves lately, last
year they toured with BB King. Hoo Hah! The bigtime.
Now they've been jamming with Bob Dylan lately. Something
tells me he needs them more than they need him, but that's
fine. I like Bob, I like "the kids." I have one complaint
about their earthday gig though.
  Guild had these acoustic guitars they must have required
the band to use that sounded really crappy. My guess is the
strings were too brand new, and the guitars might have been
shoddy craftsmanship too. Could somebody please let them
play their own instruments? I'll bet they'd like that.
