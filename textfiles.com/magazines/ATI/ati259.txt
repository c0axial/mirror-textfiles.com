  He keeps a paperback copy of Orwell's "1984" in his back pocket.
  "No," he says, "don't worry; I'm not gonna to try and kill the
president. The opposite in fact. It's the new president's dad's 
style to try and shoot dissidents in the ass. I figure I have 
about a 50/50 chance of coming out of a George Bush shooting 
unscathed."

to ati@etext.org:
You're a republican? 
No shit! 
Wow.
ALT/F13

[ed note: uh oh. Correction number two for that zine.
I was a republican at the time of publishing the ATI 
issue which that was reprinted from. Should have
taken that part out and didn't notice. Everything
else seemed pretty durned "apropo." We regret the
error in that we certainly don't wish anyone to think
Prime Anarchist has been EITHER: repug OR dem the
past decade or so. Thanks for pointing this out, F.
I CAN call you  _F_  can't I? I know we haven't been
formally introduced. Is "F" the proper shortening of
a name like ALT/F13? Just curious. You must be one of
those Japanese ha<k3rz.]


to ATI:
I saw on the Biafra NG where the DK catalog was 
withdrawn and is now officially out of print. 
Can you find out more about this?
  [I'll get right on that one...]


Hi Marco. 
  Thanks for the hook-up. I listened to your songs, 
and I really got a kick out of them! You kind of 
remind me of Adam Sandler, if he actually had some 
musical ability. I especially liked 'Guerillas in 
the Lobby' - good stuff!
  btw - what the fuck is frybread?
Thanks again,
 Jameson

OVERHEARD AROUND THE LISTS

From Axenolith:

"Our brands, services and technologies already touch hundreds 
 of millions of people," said Chairman Steve Case, whose 
 company AOL serves 26 million Internet subscribers. "We will 
 embed the AOL Time Warner experience more deeply into their 
 everyday lives." 

Prepare for the embedding!!!!

IS DOT COM REALLY THE DOT BOMB?

  Hola, I'm prime anarchist and this is the column or something.

    NYTimes lays off 60, other companies to follow.
        Who's next, where do we go from there? 
This author just heard that NYTimes is laying off 60-65 of their 
internet people because of all this talk about the web being 
less a great place to make money and more the place for discussion
and hanging out. Between the first draft of this column and the 
second, the author heard that CNN's about to layoff hundreds of 
internet people too, now that another half of the country has FCC 
permission to merger AOL/CNN/Time/Warner.
  This author is quite pleased, yea relieved and happy about
this, but then the author doesn't have a job to fear at the NY
Times or CNN either.
  I heard this at about 4 this morning from the BBC and again
from CBC at a little bit before 6. Then of course as seems to
be the tradition these days, I catch my first "american" sniff 
of this news at about 5pm. 
  The first time I took it merely at face value. Then second 
time I started thinking a little deeper. Let's see. New York 
Times was one of the last major US dailies to even dabble with 
the internet, and when they finally did, they set up a cookie-
intensive system claiming it would forever remain completely 
free. Well, free to sign up. Do you want to look things up 
more than a year and a half back? Break out the wallet, people. 
  But I digress. They sealed up their "online paper" with a 
username and password. Friends of mine got one right away. With 
good reason. NYTimes is still to this day considered the journal 
of record. Ask any librarian hauling around those big huge cloth-
bound index books and the microfiche and etc. Sure, some people 
go to the Post and even the WSJ or say Time and Newsweak [sorry I
couldn't help myself] but we still live under a mythology that's
greatly defined by the New York Times. If it happened in the
times, it happened. 
  Period.
  Well back to the password. I'd gotten a password a year or two
after my friends did. Why for the holding out? Suspicious.
Maybe I was being as slow to respond to the NYTimes as they were
to the rest of us. Vengeance is divine. Digressing again. Passwords.
Yeah, passwords. Have they given up the ghost? Have they admitted 
defeat in laying off I-Net people? Have they realized all of a 
sudden that information is NOT a commodity, contrary to CIA, GOP, 
DNC and ASNE belief?
(I'll save you a quick trip to your AP Stylebook and Libel Manual 
there. That's American Society of Newspaper Editors!) Did it smack 
some high level board member in the face that it's simply not worth 
spending literally millions of dollars a month toward something that 
might not even get them half a billion after all is said and done 
decades from now?
  Ha!
  Then I heard the report a third time and thought of a different 
wrinkle. It involves one of my two local newspapers here. The
non-gannett-corpse paper [oops, sorry again...] A couple superbowls
ago. Yeah, the one that had all the anti-porn proxyserver programmers
up in arms. Yes: Superbowl XXX.
  My local pape has a circulation of about 13K (next to the neighboring 
mcpaper at about 50K) and they jumped right on the net with e-news that 
summer. Road to the super bowl. They got a few hits. The McPaper said 
Bah Humbug. Websites are stupid, they're not going to go online until 
every other big looking paper around them's been online for a year or 
more with great success. 
  Well, the little paper that could, let me tell you. Come Oct/Nov,
the hits were climbing up into the thousands a day. 
  Then it happened, I think it was early November. Not only did they 
get their millionth hit total, they got more than 100,000 hits in a 
month. People in Australia, Jamaica, and Swaziland, yes even Trenton,
New Jersey were writing in signing the guestbook saying things like, 
"I'm a major packer fan, I hope they win the superbowl. Thanks for 
keeping me informed out here."
  I think two superbowls later, the other bigger paper came online.
By then the little paper that could was getting tens of thousands of
hits a month even in the off season. People weren't even cancelling
their subscriptions to the paper paper. They seem to have gotten
themselves addicted to both. A very active bunch, they!
  Now in the early times, there was a couple banners. I think it 
was a car dealership, and some place where you can buy Reggie 
White's smelly old underwear and socks at "lower than eBay prices!" 
Anyhew, these banners were like 50$ up front, forever, or until 
further notice or something. It really wasn't a commercial
endeavor as much as an attempt at keeping people interested and
connected long enough to think up new ideas around circulation 
boost for the actual, honest to goodness, paper paper. 
  Cross the street: major commercial endeavor. Why yesterday 
morning I even saw an ad at the bottom of the FRONT PAGE of
the paper paper for not only their "www . page" but how you can
see more car dealerships listed just like "x car dealer." Yes, a
full blown (ok, really small, but almost the same exact size AND
SHAPE as my zine banner 
    [ref]:[http://www.freespeech.org/kokopeli/pics/ati4.gif]
                        display ad on the front page.
  Money, money money. Love of it is not only a sin, it's a stumbling
block if you ask me. But that didn't get all-evident until about an 
hour after New Years Eve.
  There was BBC and CBC again, spouting off about how they didn't
"think Time's man of the year was going to be a dot com fellow THIS
TIME, that's for sure." And when does United States corporate media
begin embracing the notion that the internet is more free-info-
superhighway, full of anarchy and fun, and cool chats, and less
"get rich quick, send me a buck," perfect ponzi scheme? The mother
of all moneymakers?
  You got it. Todayish. Behind the times, bigtime. So anyhow, internet
jobs are going to start drying up left and right at a newspaper near
you, as people start admitting that what they threw wads of "venture"
at "just ain't gonna happen," and many people are going to be hurt.
  Personally. Except those of us who've been surfing the
"info-supo-hi-way" since it was a matted down walked upon dirt road.
Yeah, since before Al Gore invented it.
  So what will come of NYTimes.com? We'll have to wait and see.
Maybe they'll let information be truly free, and they'll open up 
their archives. Or maybe they'll fold and go back to being the 
CIA's main disseminator just in paper instead of all over anarchy 
land.
  In fact, in honor of all these fools, I'll engineer 
alt.capitalism.is.so.much.fun on usenet. For what does alt 
stand for anyways? Anarchists, Losers and Terrorists. Hmmm. 
Sounds like the New York Times to me.

  And in other shorter stuff:

I bought a brita filter. Why? Because I don't think your tap
is supposed to make a loud pooping noise the first time you
turn it on in the morning. Yeah, a small explosion before the
water starts teeming out. Either they tripled the amount of
chlorine this year, or we're having a little bit of a swamp-
gas problem or something. So now I'm filtering CL2, F2 and
whatever else out of my water before I drink it.
  It has come to that. I'm not happy about it. I guess we
here at the Untied States of Americancorporated are seeming 
to take after France and England, eh? We've ruined our 
groundwater, just about devastated our topsoil, what's 
next, I know, let's destroy outer-space.

The Official George W. Bush Inaugural Song!
(Sing to the tune of "The Beverly Hillbillies"

         G                          D7
Come and listen to my story 'bout a boy named Bush.
                        G
His IQ was zero and his head was up his tush.
                G7            C
He drank like a fish while he drove all about.
    D7                          G
But that didn't matter 'cuz his daddy bailed him out.
[SPOKEN]
DUI, that is. Criminal record. Cover-up.


Well, the first thing you know little Georgie goes to Yale.
He can't spell his name but they never let him fail.
He spends all his time hangin' out with student folk.
And that's when he learns how to snort a line of coke.
Blow, that is. White gold. Nose candy.

The next thing you know there's a war in Vietnam.
Kin folks said, "George, stay at home with Mom!"
"Let the common people get maimed and scarred."
"We'll buy you a spot in the Texas Air Guard."
Cushy, that is. Country clubs. Nose candy.

Twenty years later George gets a little bored.
He trades in the booze, says that Jesus is his Lord.
He said, "Now the White House is the place I wanna be."
So he called his daddy's friends and they called the GOP.
Gun owners, that is. Falwell. Jesse Helms.

Come November 7, the election ran late.
The kin folks said "Jeb, give the boy your state!"
"Don't let those colored folks get into the polls."
So they put up barricades so they couldn't punch their holes.
Chads, that is. Duval County. Miami-Dade.

Before the votes were counted five Supremes stepped in.
Told all the voters "Hey, we want George to win."
"Stop counting votes!" was their solemn invocation.
And that's how George finally got his coronation.
Rigged, that is. Illegitimate. No moral authority.

Y'all come vote, now. Ya hear?
