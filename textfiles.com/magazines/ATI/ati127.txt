     who died in Guatemala last week. May his tireless quest for 
     TRUTH live on.

Dear Gary Trudeau,
   I've a crush on Kim from your cartoon. Yeah, yeah.
I know. That sounds silly, seeing how I'm 34 years old
and all. But it's true.


   Hey, hey hey. I'm Prime Anarchist and this is ATI issue 127.
   Prediction of the week? Full-scale uncontainable war in Mexico
   by 1999's end. Perhaps the beginning.


OPEN LETTER TO CONGRESS:
(You Listen up Too, Senate)

In 1992 the CIA was recruiting 17-year old Hopi kids for immediate
employment. I demand a full accounting of where they went the next
5 years. For, I'm certain I recognized some of them in Chiapas last
August.
   It pains me to say what they were doing in Chiapas.
   So I won't.




       NOTAS MUSICAS!!!
  --- -------- --- ----- -------
  The official ATI music section.
  --- -------- --- ----- -------
  To the tune of "Frito Bandito" commercial:
            Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye.
            Your mother sucks chrome
            off a bumper hitch.

Who remembers the author of THAT parody???

                 ans: John Valby!


To the tune of Locomotion as sung by Little Eva.

Everybody's doing the popular dance now.
Que es eso, es la macarena.
You advisor says they'll like you if you give it a chance now.
Que es eso. es la macarena.

I know it looks so foolish but it's easy for you.
Sure you'll be embarrassed but it's worth a vote or two.
No one cares what you might say it's all what you do.
So come on Tommy, do the macarena with me.

C'mon Tommy, do the macarena
C'mon Tommy W-2 the macarena
How 'bout a cheesehead while you do the macarena
Eso si que es -- es la macarena
Si, es comico no? Es la macarena.
C'mon, how 'bout it ese.

                              (next)

Three Mice With a Tail of Woe to Tell.

Three nice mice, three nice mice, see how they run!
See how they run! They all ran after the farmer's wife
She cried to the farmer, "Oh save my life."
He cut off their tail with a carving knife.
Oh three tail-less mice. Three tail-less but nice mice.

Yeah but... Three tail-less mice. Three tail-less mice.
See how they run! See how they run!
They all ran after the farmer's wife
She gouged out their eyes with a pick of ice.
Did you ever see such a sight in your life.
They never saw it coming, "yikes."

Three blind maimed mice. Three blind...
Wait. That's not all...
    (stop there!)



To the Tune of IT DON'T MEAN A THING 
(IF IT AIN'T GOT THAT SWING)
Your silk panties give, my cotton ones static cling
Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah...
Your silk panties make my cotton ones wanna cling.
Doo wah, doo wah....

Makes no difference if you use cling free.
Fabric softners they don't mean a thing.

Oh, your silk panties give...



       OK last parody and I'll shut up.
       (we know he's getting on your nerves)

       To the Tune of Shooting Star by Bad Co.

   Johhny was a young boy when he heard his first Lawrence Welk song
   "A 1 & a 2" I think it was and before it didn't take too long.
   Got himself a bubble machine n toured across the land.
   Sellin' out old folks homes and the Las Vegas Blue Sands.

   Don't you know that you are a useless star
   Don't you know. 
   Don't you know that you are a useless star 
   Like Axel Rose, like Milli Vanilli, Like Elvis, dontcha know.

   Johhny wasn't 20 til he got himself a piano.
   Then he put the bubble machine on top of it oh nooooooooo.
   Then he started playin' Jerry Lee Lewis songs to a muzak beat.
   SHOUTED --(Imagine a million couch potatoes cheering
              to the censored version of goodness gracious
              great you-know-whats of whole wheeeeeeeeeet)

   Don't you know that you...
   SPOKEN -- (Like Gino Vanilli, Frank Sinatra, Conway Twitty.
              Like Bob Hope and his all-star war monger band.
              Like Tipper "F-ing" Gore.

   Been 50 years now, and Johnny's still selling out shows.
   Geritol commercials -n- hawkin' panty hose.
   Can't hardly hear him, butcha can see him move his mouth.
   Can hardly stand up...
   SPOKEN -- (But he bought himself a condo down south where 
              the lawnmower man is paid yearly and the paper
              comes in the middle of the night.)
    
   Don't you know that you are a useless star... don'tcha know...
   Like Don Ho, and Slim Whitman. Pat "Family Man" Boone.
   Or even Marie Osmond.

 By John Hendrix
 PAWN Business Writer

 NEW YORK (PAWN) -- Early estimates by private industry 
 researcher IMS Health found that 113,134 percent of the 
 51 people who picked up new prescriptions for the 
 impotence drug in the week ending April 17 were sick 
 and tired of their personal problems being front page
 news already last week. 
    Period. End of paragraph.


LEIPZIG, Germany (AP) -- 3,000 or more German skinheads sang 
nationalistic hymns at a rally Friday and cheered speakers who 
railed against foreigners and Chancellor Helmut Kohl, two 
parties they blame for record unemployment.

Thank you, and have a nice day.

We end now with a poem entitled THE PRESIDENT SUCKS.
by Natalie Toast.

     So Emily Dickenson got past the censors.
     I'm surprised your Walt Whitman made it through.
     Langston Hughes. He made it. Wow.
     And William Carlos Williams too.

     And Emily Dickenson got past the censors.
     Hillary talks of how healing paper can be.
     Mrs. Censorship - Tipper's friend.
     Allied admin, bureaucracy.

     While Emily Dickenson got past the censors.
     Many a poet turned Billary down.
     No not Republicans, many they.
     Simply not wishing being summed up: clown.

     Because Emily Dickenson got past the censors.
     C-Span, Sun Microsystems picks allowed and able.
     No John Trudell, James Merrill or Calvin Trillin.
     No Ice-T, Homerics or Bible quotes.

     Yet Emily Dickenson got past the censors.
     Sylvia Plath makes it through too. 
     Whilst we sit sterile studying poetics.
     This month of the less-lived, censored you.
