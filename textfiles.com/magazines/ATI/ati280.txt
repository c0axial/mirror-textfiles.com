Last nite was Violent Femmes at 
Summerfest and I missed it. :(

Specializing in Anarchy, Music and Poetry mostly,
but a little of this and a little of that too. Here 
we have the 280zine for early Monday 0107020848 hrs.


JOURNAL NOTE AS NEWSPAPER COLUMN - 
  by The Prime Anarchist.

FALL INTO THE FOURTH - I'm way behind on my 'zine 
too. I got too caught up in my duties at Indymedia.
  Which is no excuse really. I could've focused on
it WHILE I was doing all that stuff. I just didn't.
Just that I never put more than 5 or 10 minutes at 
a time on the zine during the week, so I got to 
deadline with the actual doom feeling right before
a looming minute. You know the feeling I'm sure, or
at least can empathise, right? 
  But I do have some letters to the editor and a 
full #'s run, so the rest should all come together 
pretty easily.
  So Land O' Lakes just bought out Lake To Lake 
Cheese? Did anyone else hear that? I'm guessing by
all these billboard ads I see in every town I go to.
  I recorded my own version of Hendrix' SSB the 
other night. Just in time to give away for 4July!!!
Classical guitar to Soundforge with lots of reverb,
distortion and noisegate. A couple mistakes that I
chose to "live with" for the usual reasons. (One
take, one track recording Black Sabbath style; and
there were other parts right next to the mistakes
that were so inspired I know I'll never get them
again on any fretboard no matter how hard I try)
  Overall I'm pretty happy with how it came out.
  I thought "disapproval" came through as a tone
poem, especially the four beat tremelo at the very
end.
http://radio.indymedia.org/display.php3?article_id=545
  Did it end on D? B? Octaves I remember that -- so 
much for theory, but then that never mattered much
to me, huh? Maybe I'll TAB it out so people can "see"
it while they hear it. :)
  What next? I'm enjoying the heck out of this
Soundforge thing. It comes at the recommendation of
Dak from Holiday Inn Cambodia BBS, remember him?
  Oh back to the tone poem I built inside of a Jimi
Hendrix rippin' solo. I say "disapproval" because I
tried to leave behind some of the rage that's usually
there and let general dislike or disapproval outweigh
it rather than getting lost in a blaring rapid-fire
Hendrix scream.
  Happy 4th of July. Hope your Charmglow is in order.
Are your rocks clean? And remember, Independence is
NOT just a fake clear plastic graffito on a window 
at the GAP, it's how you live your life.

It was reported today that at a White House staff 
meeting last week there was a heated discussion 
about the health of Vice President Cheney and his
angina problem. President Bush interrupted and 
stated emphatically that "Men do not have anginas."
The president was especially perplexed when a 
staffer said that Cheney has "acute angina."

Sisyphus sent this along:

Say, I've been reading in Thoreau's _Journal - 1851_ 
and found something:  {(he -Thoreau- had been holding 
forth in a rather sentimental tone, typical, I think, 
of the times, then:}  We believe that the possibilitie 
of the future far exceeds the accomplishment of the past.
  We review the past with commonsense-but we anticipate
the future with transcendal senses.
  In our sanest moments we find ourself naturally expecting 
far greater changes than any which we have experienced 
within the period of distinct memory-only to be paralleled 
by experiences which are forgotten-  Perchance there are
revolutions which create an interval impassible to the memore."
The interesting thing about this is that he said it in 1851!
  They didn't even have electricity then!
  STEAM POWER was barely known! There was a railroad nearby.
  It went all of 40MPH.

Since It's Uranium At The Front Of It All

Since it's uranium at the front of it all,
Your cause is mine and mine yours, really.
I mean, even though at first glance we each
Look so different, busied at such differing
Issues.

Issues.
Since Uranium is at the roots of it all,
Your issue is mine, and mine yours, really.
That's what I mean - roots. Look deep.
Cause and effect. Where is it all going -
Rights.

Rights.
Since Uranium is under the surface of it all,
Your life is mine, and mine yours really.
Our meaning is interconnected. Again, look deep.
Humanity. Where are we going with this.
Relocation.

Relocation.
Are you Navajo? Chiapaneco? Timorese? Tibetan?
Why do you suffer? I suffer for Uranium really.
Our plight is the same, you and me. I mean it.
Busy yourself, but think about all this please.
Since it's Uranium at the front of it all.

SUMMARY OF PART OF A WEBPAGE:

In retaliation for the investigative story 
about the finances of the George W. Bush 
campaign, Barrick Gold Mining of Canada 
has sued my paper, the Observer of London, 
for libel.
  The company, which hired the elder Bush 
after his leaving the White House, is charging 
the newspaper with libel for quoting an Amnesty 
International report, which alleged that 50 
miners might have been buried alive in Tanzania 
by a company now owned by Barrick.

WOULD NOW BE AN APROPRIATE TIME TO REPRINT 

To The Editor:
  [previously printed in a November '95 University of
Connecticut newspaper, New London Day and the Hartford
Courant, and then issue 234 of ATI (the more things 
change...)]
  "Psst," I imagine someone whispering to defense chief
William Perry, "Apologize for our raping that little Japanese
girl - maybe they'll get off our back about Nagasaki."
  Our military raped a 12-year old girl??? Japan deserves
an apology and then some. Didn't we demand 300 years ago
that English soldiers stay out of OUR bedrooms?
  Don't Japanese people deserve the same basic human rights?
Or are we still blinded by our imperialistic misbehavior the
whole world over? This just shows me we're getting too big
for our britches.
  If the U.S. government truly wants to have good diplomatic
relationships with Japan, then 47,000 troops should be moved
somewhere else. It's time to stop shoving our soldiers down
peoples' throats. We've gone to decay when our soldiers begin
gang-banging children.
  Let's go beyond the lip service, Washington. Let's get out
of Japan.
