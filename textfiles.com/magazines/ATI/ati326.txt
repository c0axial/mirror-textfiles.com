BOMB THE U.S., GREATEST PURVEYOR OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION 
IN KNOWN UNIVERSE, MEXICO CITY MARXISTS DEMAND

MEXICO CITY (Aug. 21st) - Threats by White House terrorists 
George W. Bush, Richard Cheney, and Donald Rumsfeld to attack 
Iraq because of its suspect - if unproven - fabrication of 
weapons of mass destruction reek of Yanqui hypocrisy, an 
aggregation of Mexico City Marxists grouped together at 
the far end of the counter of the La Blanca Cafe in the 
old quarter of this capital, advised today.
  "The U.S. possesses the most lethal arsenal of chemical, 
biological, and nuclear weapons in the known universe. The 
U.S. terrorists must be stopped by a coalition of the world’s 
peace-loving Marxists."
  The group strongly advocates the bombing of the U.S. as a 
preventative strike against the deployment of the White House’s 
arsenal of weapons of mass destruction.  Bombs should contain 
such materials as corn syrup, molasses, honey, strawberry 
preserves, peanut butter (both crunchy and creamy), and other 
sticky sweeteners designed to gum up and bog down the U.S. war 
machine, prevent air force planes from taking off, and clog big
and small guns.
 At the same time, the Marxists urge that these same bombs be 
dropped on Iraq to feed that nation’s starving children - over 
a half a million young Iraqis have died since 1991 as the result 
of the U.S. terrorist boycott of that third world nation.
*****************************************
This special issue of Mexico Barbaro honors the 25th anniversary 
of the death of Groucho Marx.

From the Bari Family

My family is grateful to the jury and wants to thank them for their
courageous decision. They have reaffirmed our faith in the justice
system. We're only sorry that Judi is no longer alive and able to
share this sweet moment.
  Now that the Oakland Police Department and FBI have been brought
to justice, they owe it to my family to explain what cause they had
to hold my sister's civil rights in such contempt.
  Judi's political message was adamantly nonviolent. Yet for 12 long
years, she has been wrongly connected with terrorism. After September
11 and the threatening of many of our rights in the name of homeland
security, I'm afraid that this scenario will occur more often. My
family has seen up close how much harm can result when rights are
ignored.
  In Judi's case, the authorities stepped outside the law. This
verdict reminds us that protection against terrorism should never
out-weigh the protection of our own civil rights. Otherwise, like my
sister Judi Bari, we will be made to suffer the consequences.

COULTER, HOROWITZ TO WED
Sheepshead Bay (PAWN) -- In what is being billed as the world's
largest corporate merger to date, pundit Ann Coulter and punditer
David Horowitz have announced a humongous party they're having to
consummate their royal wedding.
  After yachting and eating cheese from the head of a poor person,
the couple will wear white and march down the aisle to be wed in
front of 32 and 33 degree Masons from the Scottish Rite, the Irish
Rite, the Jewish Rite and the Klanish Rite.
  


VERY SHORT RECORD REVIEW:

The NORAD "Cavalcade Of Music."
Lt. Col. Mark Azzolina, Conductor.

This record features the NORAD "Pops Concert" Band
and the Norad "Commanders" Orchestra.
  The album actually sucks musically, if you want
my not so humble opinion but it was on sale for 95c,
so I simple could NOT pass it up.
  "Here is one album," says the liner notes, "produced
for public service use only, are the internationally
famous [yadda yadda] 
  The only two-nation military musical organization
composed of carefully selected bandsmen of the US 
Army, Navy, Air Force and Royal Canadian Air Force.
The NORAD band was organized in April 159 to represent
the over 200,000 American and Canadian service men and 
women assigned to the North American Air Defense system.

Office Of Information.
Headquarters North American Air Defense Command
Ent Air Force Base, Colorado


RHETORICAL:

Is West Nile virus really Cholera and the proud
"first world" will refuse to admit the connection?


GOSSIP:

"Sources close to them and to Springsteen tell me 
Tipper tried to get free tickets to the Springsteen 
show for the entire Gore staff," the well-connected 
Friedman wrote. 
  "When that didn't work, and she was told even paid 
admission would be hard to come by, the ex-second 
lady persisted. 'They wound up being offered four, 
but when they were asked to pay $75 apiece, they said forget it. 
And you know, that's why Gore isn't president, in a 
nutshell."

QUOTE:

For those who bear the instruments of war - 
And we are among them, 
Some in practice,
Some by a hug of approval -
Are sucked, 
Mumbling "necessity" and "vengeance,"
Into the domain of war crimes.

Nathan Alterman, 1948


ANOTHER RHETORICAL QUESTION:

Do you call someone from your cellfone just because
the girl across the table from you excused herself
making a call from hers, or because you really need
to talk to them?


TWO EXCERPTS FROM A DENNIS FITZINGER POEM

then the band: Loud! but disciplined,
musicians dressed in basic black,
carrying nothing more dangerous 
than a musical instrument.

...

everything built by trade and commerce,
ripping off the land, destroying forests,
wildlife, everything, just like a plague;
portland looks very much the same.
But is it really?

  [ed note: poem titled "portland." Also note that
   this poem was published in the EFJ prior to the
   Portland police riots last weekend.]

A Poem
  by Kendra

To Be Published by ATI In Three Parts.
Here's Part I. (very long)
((get parts 2 & 3 at:
http://www.etext.org/Zines/ASCII/ATI/trilogy/kendra.txt))

When you open your eyes
To the people who sleep
And sell you their life
As if we can keep going on...
Leading our lives divided
There’s comfort in silence I know
Who says you can’t be alone
With everyone who’s ever known
How full of hollow it’s grown
When we’ve risen up
Rose above
What is hate and what is love
They are the same
So is everything
And find the peace
That’s underneath
Tangled with chaos
And all the grief we feel
When we live our lives
Outside of life
The slumber that is my bride
Because our thoughts intertwined
Is not what you think is right
What is life?
What is life
If you don’t even try
But trying brings nothing in time
All along on the ride
Will you learn or be blind
Both may rip you away from divine
Crawling through life
You may never find what is yours
If you close up or take it all in
Who can ever win
Cut your losses and grin
And live while there’s life to live
Carve your path
Leave life intact
I want to be blind
But those reasons are mine
I don’t want to see outside
And lose the light that resides
In the words we often hide
Cause we have to prove
And have pride
And strive to be alive
 Atop all others
Is when
We fall into death again
Strangers you are my friends
We just haven’t talked yet
We just cancelled debts
That we all know we owe
Our mother said so
They gave us life
But not our free will
Something alive
That never stays still
And who says you’re here forever?
Chasing the youth
We’re born to lose
This "god" is in you
And what’s evil is too
Chasing the laughter that fades
When what’s inside you stays
Till you fall away
What will you think when you lay
Seconds away from change
And relearn what you’ve been played
And interpret in your own way
Why you’re here
What you’ll leave
For those to receive
Will you have nothing to give but
A house full of junk
You didn’t even need
But you worked
But not merely feed
But to feed your greed
And left a monumental funeral plot
A testament to how you bought
Everything that mattered to you
To show others what you could do
With those paper devils
That became all of you
Working for the sake of working
Making money so you can spend
Then make it all over again
Everything that seems flawed
But the beauty gets lost
Don’t love
Assume that you have won
Consume
Be near to
But don’t be close
Inhale like a ghost
Anything beyond your nose
Is something you’ll never know
No
No
Let it glow
The snakes chasing it’s tail
And he’s swallowed it whole
break the cycle
and save your tale
others might tell
pass it on down
procreation well it’s a step on the ladder...

like the sex
or the baby
look what you’re doing it for
is it so you can tell them when they see
they cannot change the world
and you see yourself in them...
or you see what you lost sight of
your child
your beacon of love to the world
not just another
who’ll live in this hole
nurture them
let them cut away
that is the path they will take
if your life turns out to be fake
and the see through the cracks
in all things
Do you
Don’t you
Reel in the coil
How is your filter?
Has it been soiled
You’ve been spoiled
But not right rotten
You write down
"stop it"
but...

Did I tell you this joke already?
  One of Marcos' commandantes was visiting a neice in
Mexico city and he was heard remarking about the 19 inch
monitor on her spiffy new Gateway:
"viva la resolution."
