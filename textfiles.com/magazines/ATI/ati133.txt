Nine Minutes to Midnite. 

And Now a Word From our Editor:
I'm in a bad mood. The mayor of LA just announced the Grammys
are moving back to California. I LIKED IT IN NY!!! Eat Sheep
Mutton, Lionel Ritchie. I NEVER saw it as an LA thing. You're 
delirious.
   Oh well, leaves more room for other awards ceremonies, eh?
Don't fret, I guess. Soon, the recording industry's about to
be turned on its ear anyhow.
   Well here's ATI 133. Short and Sweet. Enjoy, like a succulent
peach. Oops, get a towel.

Based on Census data for 1995, the most recent data available, 
a study reported that three of every five poor renters paid more 
than half of their incomes for rent and utilities. The typical 
poor renter family paid 60 percent of income for these costs.
   Is every single thing we used to tease the Soviet Union for
going to come true here? 


So, where are the Cap'n Crunch whistles? 
You said I could order them here, so where are they? 
I have been looking for one.
Thanx.

   Woops, we pulled a Radio Shack. Fresh out. Remind me to
update our webpages.


YOU wrote that song?!?!?!?!  It is so awesome.  
I got it (dunno how) with Windows or some other software package.  
Funny, actually, I found it one day when I was doing a search 
on my harddrive, and I was doing a report that day on a book that 
took place in Mexico on the beach.  I had to record a synopsis of 
the book, and I included your song and Beetoven's 5th (which I
promptly downloaded and now I have on my sounds page), and it's been 
on my mammals page ever since I knew how to embed MIDIs in.  
In fact, I have that project right here (just found it the other day).  
Hard to believe it was just 2 years ago....  You want the tape?  
It's really good, IMHO.

"Reggae.mid" is what got me into MIDIs.  It so awesome.  
Thank you so much! I'll be sure to visit your site and give you a 
link on my sounds page!  I really do need to do a massive upgrade 
on my webpages, but the problem is that I have no time!  
Arg, I hate high school!

Send me the lyrics, though, so I have them in my E-Mail box.....

Suddenly everyone and his sister is jumping on the internet
bandwagon. I remember watching ostriches along route 66 out
west somewhere. Doesn't matter where. Just the event. One
birdbrain would run up and check me out, the others would 
timidly approach until the first one got scared, then they
would all run back in. Then the same first one would come
out, and repeat the sequence.
   I laugh watching all these newcomers (especially the 
newsmedia) embracing it their own way at their own pace. 
I guess I was online before it existed. (t/i.c.)


Well that's about it for ATI133.
I don't even have a poem to end with.
How about transcript of an old answering machine message.
(ATTN: FBI. if you could tell me the date and time that 
would be quite helpful.)


Marco, this is Abbie, um... you can reach the 
people you want at their initials. The name of
their organization is in Washington DC. Umm...
Sara Becker is the executive director and a friend
of mine. Also in Texas in the hometown where Stockwell
lives. Now, they're gonna be a little freaky tomorrow...
