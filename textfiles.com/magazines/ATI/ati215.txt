Hi there, 
I'm prime anarchist and this is the weekly ATI
thing. Hope you like it. Packaged with care,
just for you. Happy Sunday. Hope you're having a
great weekend.

  "Money does free you," says a guy here in a
coffee shop to a girl who's agreeing with every
single thing he says.
  "The only reason I work," he says.
  Uh; Hmmmm...

How come every time I write http://www.rsub.com
in my notebooks to click on it later I never do???

I missed Moxyfruvous again Feb 27. Aargh!!!

She gave me the "I want one" smile.
You know it, right?

THE FOLK PROCESS
I have a new verse for Kingston Trio's
"Zombie Jamboree." Ready?

One record executive said to me
I can totally make you happy.
If you just sign here on the dotted line
I tol' him maybe that'll be just fine

For somebody else, but not for me,
I say no wanna be your zombie.
Oh no, sweetness of mine.
I don't believe in dotted lines.

  a prime anarchist poem

You sat there rockin
All wrinkled amongst the
Carrots and crumbs

you almost got me in trouble you know,
I was payin more attention to you
Than my driving -

You lookin me up and down -
Me doin likewise...

You rolled down my shirt to my pants
                                    ^^^
I watched you tumble, now
We're rompin like a 
Summer plum and a nectarine
All juicy, wet, and sweet.

Rock -n- roll, I'll just call you
My raisin girl.

Spending it the moment we cash our paycheck?

       ====    ====

I start this ATI with a poem from my friend Nini.

It's called UNDERSTANDING

earths children..
while I sit and watch you slumber..
Another day in your treatment passed..
A program started - a journey to begin -
here in my poetry you will find your
spirituality.. - look and win!

Somewhere in tha' space of my time
I engulf the wisdom of the Elders...
I speak of Ancestors' rhythms that flow
through my soul...i know that they can HEAR
ME...
out here...
Somewhere in the mountain of my dream..
Drifting in silence the beauty of tha' river takes my speech...
Wind races through my fingers as I pull to the sky...
African drums and Native alike ring out a pulsing
Note to my heart...

The ones who were brought here by others
found themselves in them that stood here before...
Stood before..stood here before..

I could go on and on but you... YOU are the only who can
look deep into yourself and live the legacy -
the legacy of PEACE that was meant for you..
Reach out and deal with the reality of a mindset so beautiful
that sunsets shudder at the arrival of your dawn...
Manage your SPIRIT and float endlessly into the MOON..

Eclipse with the might of many thunderstorms...
Take my hand it is a seven fold knowledge grip...
One is to show you the way
two is to provide you with wisdom..knowledge three...
truth of you..four, five
a feeling of love..six the space between
my thumb and forefinger that holds you tight
as you accept peace within your heart....
And seven...the palm of my hand releases opening
and you live life...
Program over.
The completed turn of your beings axis is..

Understanding.

Now a short Guthrism (*of or pertaining to woody guthrie)
and that's it for my rant 2day. Then we got #'s, Letters,
Exclamations, abreviations, and assorted other font-like
materiel.

     WOODIE'S VOICE

(as transcribed from "Will Geer reading Guthrie"
on Folkways: The Original Vision [Folkways CD
SF40001, 1989]) (Research help by Dennis G)
I hate a song that makes you think that
you're not any good. I hate a song that
makes you think that you're just born to
lose, no good to nobody, no good for
nuthin' because you're either too old,
or too young, or too fat, or too slim,
or too ugly, or too this or too that.
Songs that run you down, or songs that
poke fun at you on account of your bad
luck or hard travelin'.

I'm out to fight those kinds of songs to
my very last breath of air and my last
drop of blood.  I'm out to sing songs
that'll prove to you that this is your
world.  That it has hit you pretty hard,
knocked you down for a dozen loops. And
no matter how hard its run you down and
rolled over you. No matter what color,
what size you are, how you're built.

I'm out to sing the songs that make you
take pride in yourself and your work.
And the songs I sing are made up for the
most part by all sorts of folk, just
about like you.

    Hey, in defense of at least waiters/waitresses, when
    there is a "fleeting" (just a brush of their fingertips)
    touch when they give you your change, studies have
    shown that they are are more likely to recieve larger

POEMS BY JOHN CURL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

WHAT COULD BE EASIER THAN ERASING THE FACTS?
startle the old men sit, shaking their heads
startle
afraid to speak, afraid to listen
startle
the attack dogs wag their tails
startle
all the pistons have been shot in the head
the music is burned
the sidewalks are removed
snackfood piled rotting in the gutter
the Treasurer books his flight
trampling boots can be heard from the roof
startle
what you're left with after the passions of
youth fade away
startle
the roses swaying in the breeze
suddenly there are no secrets

   [ed note: there you go, more later.]

To whom it may concern:
Thanks for posting our logo on your site, but why not
make it a link? 
  [note: you got it...]
               We appreciate the exposure and all,

you recommending it to your readers? Or are you

please.
  I can't tell what you're doing with our logo --

PICKING: On a Local News Story With Global Parallels.
  by Marc Frucht

  The new exec dir of DGBI (downtown _____ ___ inc.
Insert your own town-name and see if it works.) believes
that Mall #2 needs to open up to Main ST. to provide a 
better link between the new KI Convention Centers #'s 1
and 2, and the growing Washington Street Entertainment
district.
  ____ ______ said many people now see the mall as a 
barrier, and a way should be found to encourage people
to walk through...
  Wait a minute! "Entertainment district?" Entertainment
district?? Wait. What street? Let's see, I remember a
bar that closed a month ago that used to have bands 
every friday and saturday nite. Now it's some other 
bar that doesn't. I remember a Bootleggy type restaurant
used to do a tuesday nite TV show from there featuring
antiseptic local talent. It got renamed something or 
other, then it got renamed something or other again.
Now it's the Daily Planet or something. Local talent,
doesn't play there anymore. No talent does. I remember
a place where the comedy troupe "Comedy Sports #2" used
to ply their wares. They were a spinoff of a bigger
group from a bigger city. I think they still do things,
but I'm not sure where. Hmmm. I remember the Rhythm
Chicken playing his drums for tips at least twice there
a couple summers ago. When he's local he's usually on
Main Street now instead since they don't hassle him as
much. There's a bar that has a beer garden outside in
the space next to it, (don't remember who they "drove
out" to get that.) yeah, they still have bands pretty
regularly. You know the kind: Rolling Stones song
followed by Eagles song followed by Kiss song followed
by Billy Joel song followed by Stevie Ray Vaugn song
followed by Lynyrd Skynrd song followed by Rolling
Stones song and then of course Billy Ray Cyrus'
Achey Brakey with Chuck Berry's Johnny B AboveAverage -
  Rinse, Repeat...
  Wait a minute, that's the street that hosts whatever
part of the Summer festival doesn't spread east or west
off of it, eh? Yeah. And then I must say there's some 
pretty good restaurants there. They moved the Bus station
from one part to another. I'll betcha there's designs on
that abandoned building. Oh yeah, there's the huge three
floor bar&restaurant on the very next block that used to
be 4 or 5 abandoned buildings, but the new owner/namer
had to wait one month to get a few hundred thousand extra
dollars off on his buying price for letting the city use
it to train their SWAT team on munitions stuff before
formally demoloshing it. (hey, be glad they train that way
instead of practicing on West Afrikan exchange students)
  None of this would catch my attention particularly except
that the following 5 things looked entirely too related.
1-The mall loses it's biggest anchor store this month.
2-The convention center comes on the heels of about 3
rejected gentrification proposals over a 5 or so year
period
3-This reminds me way too much of Atlanta the year before
they started vying so heavily for getting the Olympics to
pick them.
4-Just last year this town took 2nd or 3rd in the very hokey
annual America's City competition where cities with a big
enough population compete locally, regionally and then
nationally and then go to DC to get some award from the
President no matter whether he's a Republican or not, and
then there's 2 or 3 days of Caligula type stuff all over DC
in their honor.
5-IMAX is looking for a place to put their new custom-theatre
idea to play here in this area.
  There is also a failing movie theatre on that street that
used to be a gorgious opera house, and the street is full of
old tin ceiling lofty type places that would be just perfect
for art galleries and places for starving artists (the real
ones, not the ones that go from Holiday Inn to Holiday Inn
please) Do you think some real good can come of this? 
  Yes and no. No one wants to discuss the gentrification 
going on all over the place. It won't seem to matter a hundred
years from now, and it surely doesn't make any noise in DC.
But I've got to say it:
  Why spend so much money lookin like 
  an entertainment district when you
  could, er, um. Uh. How should I say
  it lessee. Didja ever think maybe U
  could spend even 3/4 as much making
  it really BE AN ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT?
  God forbid music art and drama would
  really HAPPEN all of a sudden.

  A marco capelli poem

Coffee and fried bread microwaved 40 seconds.
The morning after a great sweat.
A window opened behind the computer;
Letting the spring air; spring's first light
         In.

Nina Simone's "Live At Newport" album;
On the turntable - Side One.
Do you remember Side One? Liner Notes?
Remember knowing WHO WROTE THE SONGS??
     Who?

Today is the day;
After a great sweat.

And that's always a good day.

PRIME ANARCHIST WORLD NEWS 2NITE

WASHINGTOoN (PAwn) -- President Clinton coined a new phrase Thursday
pledging to work harder at creating a better way of life for American
Indians, saying treaties with the United States have unfairly rendered
them victims of "apart-hood."
  "You gahh bum deal," Clinton said in his southern drawl, which critics
are claiming was heard as "You gottem bum deal." The administration could
not be contacted for comment by press-time.
  In the speech to American Indians who could afford $350,000 a plate to
attend the Democratic congressional candidates forum, Clinton cast them
as victims of a negligent U.S. government that took land and mineral
rights in return for nothing but "those crispy crab cake thingies."
He promised to remedy that.
  "This tha' part o' our histerical legga'see we wanna make fun o',
and iddle neva' be righ' til right makes rite," Clinton said.
"This a cuntree what s'posed ta' be foun' on equal opp'tunity,
equal justice, mootch'l respek, ev'body havin' a chance. Can I getcha
some a those red-n-white peppermints?"


& ALSO IN WASHINGTOoN NEWS - Since the beginning of the year 2000.
There has been an epidemic of unexplained exploding manholes 
throughout Washington DC since January. Actually the first
exploding manhole was caught on video tape. The local authorities
are still baffled. Just 3 manholes have exploded, so far. Will
update in the near future.

  a poem by 
    DC Dave

He studied journalism
And thought he knew the score:
He was on the road
To be a media whore.

All too late he learned
Of a better way:
Ahead of him were those
Who'd joined the CIA.

We end with a poem
  by John Curl

THE WALL BEHIND THE MIRROR
the wall behind the mirror
condors circling Brooklyn
the wind between sleep and waking
sparks spinning from a galaxy
pus dripping from a factory
the hard lump behind the eyes of a cop
the hand slapping your pleasure
broken angels marching lockstep into nightmare
disarming drill sergeant curse
rip off FBI agent's mustache
jump out of crashing car
evacuate corporations
vacuum the floor of congress
recongregate peach orchards
look deep into an old person's eyes
scatter summer showers
