WE'VE GOT A BIGGER BIAFRA NOW...

     Parody by Big Deal
 Reprinted from alt.fan.jello-biafra

I am emperor Jello Biafra,
Born again with lawsuits against me
Still you made me President...
 
Free market will soon go away
When I enact a maximum wage
Six figures and it's payback time

Commander-in-Chief -- Jello Biafra
Jello Biafra -- Commander-in-Chief

Say hello to Parliamentary rule,
Say good-bye to NAFTA
Now you hafta vote for the cops
Still you wear a happy face

Watch the CIA disappear
It's no longer needed here
Neither is the DEA
How would you like your taxes paid?


Commander-in-Chief -- Jello Biafra
Jello Biafra -- Commander-in-Chief

Welcome to the new millennium
No more homeless, no more bums
Now they sell drugs for a living
Out of old abandoned buildings

Old warehouses, factories
Where they use to make SUVs
Take a look at how far we've gone--
People squatting in the Pentagon

We've got a new national anthem,
"Stars and Stripes of Corruption"
This is America , the land I love
Where I can vote, NONE OF THE ABOVE

RANTICLE - by the prime anarchist

Am I the ONLY journalist to ever publish an article
about a CODETALKER on OTHER than an ELECTION YEAR?
  "OK, but you're reprinting it on an election
year," you might say. 
  Sure. And you may end up seeing why when you 
get to the end of this great interview I had with
Forrest Kassanavoid, Comanche Codetalker; from
Mountaineer news where I worked during my army days.
[no, I was NOT a psychological-warfare script writer.
I was a signal soldier, an infantryman, a medic and
a stringer for the newspaper! Oh and a truckdriver,
a legal clerk, a gopher, lackey, a typist and an expert
mopper, buffer and floor-waxer.]
  Basically I'm saying, here is a hero of mine, not
McCain, not Bush, not Gore, not Bradley and certainly
not Keyes. In fact, maybe next week I'll discuss 
Hana Ali's father, the famous boxer - to show you
another huge hero, much more hip and with-it than
"I couldabeen a nintendo" Bradley. No offense, Bill.
Great basketball career. Good platforms and stuff.
Perhaps you could help me get SOA on the bill???
  OK so here you go, the results of my first interview
with a CODE TALKER. First printed July 20, 1990.

SIGNAL-SOLDIER HISTORY REVISITED
    Story and Photos by Marc Frucht
  Comanche Code Talker Forrest Kassanavoid told 
soldiers of 124th Sig BN to be proud of their lineage.
  "You have a special relationship with an Indian Tribe
in Oklahoma," he told them.
  Kassanavoid shared his World War II, 4th infantry div
experiences with the signal soldiers during a battalion
sponsored luncheon at Giuseppe's Depot Restaurant,
Tuesday afternoon.
  The military recruited Comanche, Navajo and Choctaw 
Indians because their native language was harder to crack
than codes they came up with every day. The Germans and
Italians were never able to interpret any of the trans-
missions they'd intercepted which contained the Indian
languages.
  124th SIG BN boasts campaign history from WWII through
Vietnam including the Normandy invasion. Back then it was
called the 4th SIG CO, according to Kassanavoid. Organized
June 1, 1940 in the Harmony Church area of Fort Benning,
GA.; the 4th SIG worked under many commanding officers and
Kassanavoid remembers almost every single one.
  "Let's see," said the code talker, "first there was Capt.
Terrance Tulley. He was a West Point grad, 1920. Then we got
Capt. Arthur McCrarey, then 1st Lt. Seoul Christman. He became
the division signal officer until he was seriously wounded in
an air attack in Normandy. Then came Capt. Phillip Bragen, and
hmmmm, a Capt. Dunaway..." He then went on to share all of his
4th Infantry Division war stories with the signal soldiers.
  As a recruit, the code talker went from Fort Benning, GA.,
to Camp Gordon, now Fort Gordon and home of Army Signal School.
[Coincidently where Colonel Kaddaffy, Agosto Pinochet and Manuel
Noriega all took classes at one time or another.] From there he
went to Fort Dix, NJ; Camp Gordon Johnson for amphibious
training; Camp Jackson, SC and then Camp Joyce Kilmer, NJ
for his portcall.
  Destination?  ...(to be continued next 3 or 4 issues
           (like the unabomber series))

YE MORE OLDE WARRE STORRRRRRRRR------EEEEEZ
 by marco    [reprinted from his postings
     in bbs's the last couple days]

It's making me laugh seeing you rag on Cheyenne Mountain
(NORAD) right after I just read something else in another
room about cb and ham freq's

I'll never forget the day I sat in a Hmvwwv rig pulling
midnite duty downrange on the east slope of norad mountain
with the US harmy signal corps. None of us knew at the time
but we were training for the work that we'd end up NOT doing
in desert storm because of the simple fact that everything
needs to be air-cooled, and the minute all that sand got stuck
in both screens our whole 2.6 million dollar system was going
down for a few hours until someone rated for heating & AC could
come change what friggen looked to me like a simple air filter!
  But anyhow I digress. I learned how to cheat like a pro that
day. 
  If everything you tried about coordinates wasn't working for your
system to meet your partners system a mile away both of you pointing
at the exact space in the sky, either one of you could just face the
damned thing right due west parallel to the ground right AT NORAD!
turn the thing up to 9 out of 10 and blast a couple words to your
partner. Doesn't matter what channel or band you're on even, s/he'll
hear you, so will everyone else. Then he can take the lazyman's
sorry, lazyperson's way of walking in toward you til you can fix
on THEIR rig!
   Works every time.

:)

Of course it backfired once almost getting me demoted bigtime
when some canadian general said these exact words to me that I will
NEVER forget.

"Good Afternoon ___ Command Post ____ General ____ speaking; this line
is unsecure, how may I help you ma'am or sir!"
and then, "soldier, what the fuck are you doing in my telephone???"

I powered that sucker down faster than you could say "capn' midnite, hand
me that fly swatter." Then I called in for a repair insisting that I
heard sunspots.

Very very valid profound point, ________

You know throughout most of Mitnik's sentence
I held back an urge to try and elevate peoples'
view of his plight to one parallelling Leonard Peltier
or Mumia Abu Jamal or Geronimo Pratt.

But, call me spineless, I kept quiet due to statute
of limitations type things where it truly COULD HAVE
been any one of us. I didn't make any waves around
that issue at all except around close personal friends.

Now had Abbie Hoffman still been alive 3 or 4 extra
years, I might have had the "cocciones" to present
some really neat guerrilla theatre events around
every part of that crackdown. Also, if any of you have
friends who fell victim to Phoenix and Sundevil operations,
you'll know what I mean when I say in a sense I was a
gypsy not helping out a jew or a jew not helping an artist,
or a gay or an irishman or something those years.

Whether it's safe now or not, I'll write as many letters
as I can around New England this weekend. Thanks for telling
us about it.

[PAWN] - And in anarchist world news:
  Harry Belafonte quit NetAid saying it's turned into 
a trade show promoting the UN and Cisco Routers. He 
questioned the disbursement of proceeds, asserting they
would be processed through the United Nations and Cisco
before reaching the poor.
  [ -sounds like my decades-old fight with United Way,
AmWay, 501c3 people and basically the general all-around
multi-level network marketing of Jesus Christ ]
  German Briceno, after admitting to killing Ingrid
Washinawatok, Lahe'ena'e Gay and Terence Freitas somewhere
between Venezuela and Colombia, will not have to go 
to Menominee and formally apologize to Ingrid's family
or anywhere else in the US to apologize for his actions.
It seems the Colombian government likes him about as much
as the Greek Government likes PT Veliotis of Subway, er,
uh, I mean submarine fame.
