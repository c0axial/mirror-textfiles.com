Inter-related Obit of the week

Shel Silverstein is dead. 
Long live Shel.
   Was he a great creator or what?
   I bow my head and fold my hands
letting my spirit greet his. Goodbye
old guy. He was 66. I'm told natural
causes. I hope he died happy. He sure
did SEEM like he would - I think the
guy blushed through every one of his
fifteen minutes!
   You're gonna laugh, but the first 
place I ever read one of his poems, or
was near anything "Shel-esque" was
in Playboy magazine. I was 12. 
Shel Silverstein: tucked away under my
bed where mom wouldn't find him.
   Next time I play Pass It On, I'm
gonna phollow it up with Boy Named

ANYMORE: Reasons Other Than Just Plain 
Sucks, Or Boring.
   Can you say 'Censorship?'
   I flinch every time there's a blank
spot where the music didn't get censored
but a word or two did.
   Was I born here?
   Did I serve my country here?
   Did I listen to my first Black Sabbath
album here? Did I hear 'Howl' on the radio
after midnite here???
   Did I memorize the the Pledge of Alleej-enz
hear?!?
   This is NOT my land of the phree -- home
of the brave.
   What happened Amerika?
   Am I the only one who doesn't flinch? Did
this happen subtle, gradual? Is it too late?
I shudder to think,
Prime

Q. When was this written.
A. (see bottom)

"For those who have survived 
the last couple of violent
decades in America's innercities, 
school shootings are nothing new. 
Kids are still killing kids. Only the
context has changed.
   "On the surface, the recent school 
shootings appear to be the start of 
a terrible trend. At their root,
however, they probably have much 
more in common with the inner city 
violence that many of us have come to
expect..."

   "...Young people require our 
respect and attention, and they 
will make sure they get it 
one way or another."

NOT A ZINE REVIEW
-----------------
 by Marco. Publisher. ATI 'Zine.
I just bought Cool Beans #10.
Wow. Good stuff. Cool beans!
  I haven't finished reading
it yet, so won't dare a review
yet. 
   So, look for an official
Cool Beans Zine review and CD
review next week!
      Also, I'm not done with the
CD that comes tucked in. There's
3 really really good songs so 
far. And the pizza comment at
the beginning? Hmmm...



And now for a poem by Raymond!
my ex-brother-in-law.
Fred, the red-headed 
Gartersnake is dead.
He died of old age.
I used to go visit him
Because he was a sage.
Ed loved him and so did I.
Now he is dead.

CENSOR # 9:
U.S. TAX DOLLARS SUPPORT DEATH SQUADS IN CHIAPAS
from the famous annual "top 25 censored stories
article (long) 
http://www.sonoma.edu/ProjectCensored/t2599.html


      On December 22, 1997, in the village 
of Acteal, in the highlands of the
Mexican state of Chiapas, 45 local men, 
women and children were shot as they
were praying. Their bodies were dumped 
into a ravine. Elsewhere throughout the
state of Chiapas, unarmed women face 
down armies "with fists held high in
rebellion and babies slung from their 
shoulder." In Jalisco, more than a dozen
young men were kidnaped and tortured. 
One of them, Salvador Jimenez Lopez,
drowned in his own blood when his tongue 
was cut out. The group responsible for
these and other atrocities are allegedly 
members of the Mexican Army Airborne
Special Forces Groups (GAFE)-a paramilitary 
unit trained by U.S. Army Special Forces.
   Mexican soldiers are being trained with 
U.S. tax dollars to fight an alleged"
War on Drugs, but peasants activists say 
the real motive driving the U.S.-supported 
war is the protection of foreign investment 
rights in Mexico.
   "In Chiapas, U.S. tax money pays for 
weapons and military ... to destroy a
movement for social justice ... . 
The United States transfers aid to the
Mexican military in cash, weapons and 
comterinsurgency training. The 1998
Clinton administration budget earmarked 
more than $21 million dollars for the
Mexican Drug War, including $12 million 
for Pentagon training in "procedures
for fighting drug traffic." Anti-drug 
effort seems to continue to focus on the
Chiapas region where 80 percent of the 
communities are in conflict zones.
According to the Zapatismo Papers (Wood), 
acts of inhumanity by GAFE were led
by Lt. Col. Julian Guerrero Barrios, 
a 1981 graduate of the U.S.-sponsored
School of Americas (SOA). Although it 
remains unknown how many of the 15
soldiers charged in the Acteal incident 
were trained at U.S. bases, the
Pentagon has admitted that some of 
the soldiers arrested were U.S. trained.

AND NOW, A POETICAL ENDING.

    carry any meaning...)
