"Starting from relatively humble beginnings, 
Prime Anarchist gears a crew of Connecticut 
hackers through 5 [sic.] plus years of hacking, 
phreaking, politics, and general spouting 
off. In many cases, they have the weirdest 
idea of time, releasing 10 issues in one 
month and then releasing nothing for 4
more. All in all, a complete grab-bag 
of articles."
