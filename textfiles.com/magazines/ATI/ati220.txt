And let's ask a couple hazbns...
  Clinton? Sweats. You can get out of them quickest.
Bill Bradley is def'ly custom-made khakis. No one makes

I actually wrote to them about it, contemplating just how stupid
they are.  I mean, their filter removes all incoming e-mail other
than those addresses you want.  So you still have to go through
your spam mailbox to check and make sure someone you don't have
on the "it's not spam!" list is someone you really care to talk to.
  I wonder what's next, a filter that deletes all incoming e-mail
before you read it?
  Of course after the nth complaint, they just stopped even
acknowledging I exist.
  Hotmail: check your mail for free! (Unless we got hacked again).

...the only reason to leave home?!?

TRAIN HOPPING : ON THE ROAD
   by Aaron Kreider
  [ed note: will be published in 3 or 4 parts...]

Prologue (On the Tracks)
It all started in May 1997 when, a couple weeks before graduation, a
roommate, Tim, came into my room and asked me if I wanted to hop a train?
A couple hours later, and after numerous rounds of Bridge waiting for a
darn train, we jumped a moving box-car with an open door (not a good idea)
as it slowed down around a curve and after a short, but fun ride, landed in
the Elkhart train yard where our car was detached and shunted (an
"exciting" process which ended in our open box car turning into a closed
box car with a jolting BANG!).  Within two weeks, I hopped three trains,
once travelling for four hours (from Goshen, Indiana to Anderson, Indiana).
 I'd never done it before and have never done it since.  Not getting caught
and not personally getting hurt (jumping off a moving train caused mild
injuries to two of my other co-passengers) has encouraged me to explore
other transportation alternatives.  The only book I know in existence about
train hopping is The Freight-Hoppers Manual for North America by Daniel
Leon (available by special order I think at http://www.amazon.com - not
easy to find!), and I highly recommend it.

In December of 1998, I read Jack Kerouac's On the Road (highly
recommended).  It's a veritable manifesto for packing a bag and hitting the
road.  Before setting out I read two biographical books on folk (or
topical) singer Phil Ochs.  He was one of the most movement-oriented (civil
rights / Vietnam) singers of the sixties and seventies, and extremely
dedicated.  I also read Hitchhiking in America by Dale Carpenter (highly
recommended), so that I'd know what to do.

The university kicked me out of my graduate apartment to put in nice
carpeting (whee!), so I decided to go home and then spend the summer
volunteering for SEAC (Student Environmental Action Coalition) in the
Philadelphia national office.  Never having hitch-hiked (not even a short
five-minute ride), with much trepidation, I set out to travel from Indiana
to my Vancouver home.  It's rather embarrassing, but I should admit that I
sold out my anti-materialist values and bought a GPS unit (so that I
wouldn't get lost and to encourage me to hop trains - it's very easy to get
lost hopping trains).  Garmin III with a built-in-map if you really must
know.  If anyone wants to buy a used Garmin III - email me.  I also bought
a road atlas which was a very good idea.

The Story Starts Here
05.17  (a.k.a. May 17, 1999)
N41 '42
W86 '14
Today I had to move out of my room and clean it (and the house) by 5:00pm.
I got out before 6pm without hassle, though it was extremely stressful
trying to go through all of my possessions, sort, toss, donate, recycle(!),
ship, and find places to store the ones I wanted to keep.  The day before I
drank pineapple juice instead of eating breakfast or lunch and ran off the
excitement energy of moving.  About a week ago I'd emailed Goshen College
(my alma mater) friends Bryce and Thomas saying that I'd show up on this
day, so they kind of expected me but being busy with projects of their own
they didn't know what to think.  I got a ride from my grandparents
(originally I was planning to hitch-hike to give that a trial run before
setting out on a large journey, but I needed to store some stuff with
them), ate supper with them in their apartment in Goshen (N 41 '34.092 W 85
'48.901), talked (they somehow assumed I was flying home, but didn't ask me
the date  -- I thought it was best that they not worry about me so I
remained mute), and then around 10pm got a ride to where Thomas, Bryce, and
Jessica Smucker were staying (house-sitting a 19th century house where a
former GC professor of mine, Jo-Ann Brandt, lived - N 41 '34.764   W 85
'49.773).  Thomas eventually showed up and we talked a bit randomly (as
Thomas normally is) and then I saw Bryce next morning.

05.18
I talked to Bryce and Wendell (N 41 '34.785  W85 '49.745 -- who had
finished his final exam) today.  Since Bryce and Thomas are very busy with
independent term projects (making a film and doing a photography portfolio
respectively), I decided to leave the next morning on the Great Adventure.
Spent a lot of time figuring out how to organise and work my new backpack.
I was very glad to learn that my sleeping bag fits (barely) into the lower
compartment of my backpack.  Talked to Jessica about hitch-hiking as her
brother, Matt (whom I'd last seen throwing blood on the Pentagon), hitched
frequently (and that very next day was going from MN to IA).

SUNDAY NOON - HOOTERS.
How many boat trailers are in the parking lot near
YOUR Hooters? 3 in mine. 5 in the next town over!
  Trend? Co-inkeedink??
  Now : my real question -- how many people return
faithfully from church right now and wait for dad
to come home? You're with the mom, the brother(s)
and sister(s) and may not know it, but "daddy-o"
is at Hooters hopin' 2 hook him a 19-yr-old! Or
at least look like it.
  Will he come home from "fishing" and be present?
I mean really present? Or will he have that Nintendo
look all over his mug? You know those oggled-out eyes
that bugs get once a year when they're in heat?
  Will he watch bowling and then golf and then football?
Will he make you get him a beer and some curly fries
and then tell you to get out of his hair?
  OK I'll shut up now.

ATI! Questioning the whole pair of dimes since February, 1988.

Hmmm. Ever notice paradigm and pair o' dice sound similar?

I'll close ATI with a thought rather than a poem.
You ready?

I dig open mics more than concerts because you're not
here for me, you're here for art, music and drama. If
I can be that for you, fine. If I can't "off with ya..."
  It's bigger than both of us.
