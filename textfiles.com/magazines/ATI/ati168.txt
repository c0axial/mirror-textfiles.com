Hello there, I'm prime anarchist and
I'm your tourguide for this rocky
road ice cream journey to the 
center of the girth.
I this week, turn over my pub's
column to sup Marcos so that he can
say a little bit about what I call 
none other than a total world "be-in."
So, without further dodo, I give 4
"ya basta's!" and three "nunca mas'"
and say, "hit it, sup..."

February 14, 1999
To: "all" [ati's words; not his]
From: SupMarcos
Ladies and Gentlemen:
So here we are once again. I am 
reminded that, in the previous 
letter, I left pending what I 
was telling you about how the 
International Consultation 
and the Campaign for the Excluded 
of the World was going to be
run.  Here it goes:

1.- Well, first I'll tell you about 
the brigades that, in the five
continents, have been accredited and 
have sent us their ideas, reports, and
anxieties...
   [I've taken the liberty of a big
    "snip" here, he lists a gazillion
    placenames, and I'd like to call
    it "just about everywhere." If
    any of you live in an area where
    you have no idea what we're talking
    about here, GET TO WORK.]
...they all know that the struggle that 
is going on here is also their own,
and that is how we understand it as well.  
Therefore, we extend to them a welcome.

2.-  Now, let me tell you that in the 
five continents, two big activities
are being prepared for the coming March.
   One is the International Consultation.  
Since for us (and for many like us), the 
Mexicans who live abroad have rights that 
must be recognized, we have thought that 
the Consultation for the Recognition of 
the Rights of the Indian Peoples and 
For the End to the War of Extermination 
should be open to participation by all 
Mexicans, without it mattering where 
they are found.  Then, what we did was 
to call an International Consultation, 
in a way such that the Mexicans who live 
in other countries, and are older than
12, could also give their opinions about 
the four questions which will be
answered on March 21, 1999.
   Not just that, but for the 
International Consultation we have 
decided to add a fifth question 
which says:
   Do you agree that Mexicans who live 
abroad should be an active part in the
construction of a new Mexico and have 
the right to vote in the elections?
   In this way, the Mexicans who live 
outside of the country will have the
opportunity to give their opinions 
about the recognition of their rights
(which is denied them by the gov.)

3.-  Clearly, here one asks oneself what 
those who are not Mexican, but who are 
interested and pledged to peace and the 
recognition of the rights of all, can do 
or how they can participate. 
   Well, one way they can participate 
is in the Campaign for the Excluded of
the World (of which I will speak later), 
and the other is to promote and spread 
the Consultation in their countries, 
organizing the installation of voting 
tables, and organizing and carrying 
out the computation and communication 
with Mexico so that the results can be 
known. In this task may participate all 
the men and women, young and old of the 
world, with or without organization, 
without mattering their nationality, 
race, color, taste, creed, size, weight, 
sexual preference, or whatever other kind 
of classification the powerful use to 
exclude those who are different.
   So that nationality will not matter, 
the International Consultation will
have many spaces for participation 
beyond casting votes.

4.- Yes, I understand that you're asking 
what the Mexicans living abroad will do 
to give their opinions about the five 
questions and how we are going to know 
your answers.
   Well, we have decided to propose the 
following options:
a).- So that the Mexicans living abroad 
can give their opinions, all those
within a nation who are interested can 
get in contact, and, in common accord, 
organize the installation of tables 
and centers of computation.
b).-These "National Coordinations" are 
accredited in the Oficina de Contacto, 
so that we can know in what countries 
and how the International Consultation 
is being organized.
c).-To send in the vote count that the 
National Coordination will carry out, 
you will have to get in contact with 
the Oficina de Contacto.
d).-If any group of people, organization, 
or group of organizations in a given country 
want to organize in a different way from 
the "National Coordination," there's no 
problem.  We just ask you to as well get
accredited with the Oficina de Contacto.
e).-In addition to going to the tables 
for the Consultation, one can give
one's opinion on the five questions 
by sending the answers via telephone,
fax, internet, email, satellite, boat 
or paper airplane, intercontinental
rocket, carrier pigeon, or by surface, 
water, or air mail.  All this will
be directed to the Oficina de Contacto.
ATTENTION:  ALL THE NATIONAL COORDINATIONS, 
GROUPS, ORGANIZATIONS, AND PEOPLE INTERESTED 
IN ORGANIZAING THE CONSULTATION IN THEIR 
COUNTRY MUST GET ACCREDITED WITH THE...
OFICINA DE CONTACTO PARA LA CONSULTA.

Well, now I'm going to tell you a little 
bit about the INTERNATIONAL CAMPAIGN 
FOR THE EXCLUDED OF THE WORLD.
   This mobilization campaign which we 
have convoked is not only for 21mar99.  
We are calling for principal actions 
to be carried out on that day, when 
the Consultation for the Recognition 
of the Rights of the Indian Peoples 
and the End to the War of Extermination 
is also taking place.
   Clearly, one of the ways to mobilize 
for this international campaign for
the excluded of the world is to participate 
in the promotion and spread of the 
Consultation, in the formation of National 
Coordinations, in the installation of 
tables, in the count and the communication 
of the results (which are not exclusively 
tasks for Mexicans); but it is not the 
only way.
   For that day, people can organize, 
for example, manifestos, letters public
and private, displays, peaceful demonstrations, 
music concerts (of course, following the 
example of the worthy Mexican rockers - who 
are with the Consultation note by note -, 
the rock groups in the whole world will echo
the zapatudo "Ya Basta!"), recitals, 
assemblies, conferences, multimedia
and/or cybernetic events, etcetera.  
Nothing that is civil and peaceful is
excluded, and people's imagination and 
creativity will go beyond, it is sure, 
anything we propose here.  It is to be 
a campaign for all the excluded, not 
just for indigenous peoples or the 
Zapatistas.
   There is an act planned in Strasbourg 
to demand change in the immigration
policies of European countries, and 
the organizers have decided to incorporate 
into their act the demands for the 
recognition of the rights of the 
indigenous peoples and the end 
to the war of extermination.  
There is also, in France, "Feu Faux 
Lait."  This is a theater company that is
preparing to participate in the campaign 
for the excluded of the world by staging 
a play in Paris and the surrounding areas.
   Now you see that there are many ways 
of participating.  You just have to
come to agreement, organize, and act.
  Well, now I'll say goodbye.  
As soon as more is known, 
I'll write again.
Vale.  
We wish you health, 
and let's not let 
neoliberalism succeed in
excluding humanity.

NO #'s section this week.
And little or no prime anarchist
world newz 2nite. I will stick 
these two bullets in however:

1) Royal Carribean Cruze Lines.
   Like Novacaine.

2) Methinks Cokie Robertz is the
   best fascist the US Economy
   has right now. Her rise to
   power using NPR's money
   structure shows her an
   illusion of leftism that 
   could easily make an Adolfo
   or Augusto look wishy-washy!

To:  Musicians of the World.
From: SupMarcos
Ladies and Gentlemen!
Viejo Antonio said (that if he had 
been a musician, he would have played
the blues) that music holds roads 
that only the knowledgeable know how 
to walk and that it, together with 
dance, builds bridges that bring 
closer worlds that otherwise you 
wouldn't even dream about.
   All this is important right now 
because news has come to us of 
concerts and presentations by 
musicians in Mexico and other parts 
of the world.  The reason?  The 
promotion of the Consultation and 
solidarity with indigenous
Mexicans and their worthy fight.
  We wanted to thank all of those who 
have had to do with these roads to
peace that, above all to the rhythm of 
rock but not exclusively, cross the
planet from side to side.
   We're not just thanking those who 
compose, sing, and play.  Also to the
producers, the sound engineers (is that 
how you say it?), the lighting crew, the 
stage hands, the drivers, the ticket 
sellers, the carriers, the artistic 
representatives, the owners and 
administrators of the locations,
and all those who saw to (but were 
nevertheless not seen) the concerts or
musical presentations (often double 
volunteers: they don't receive money 
or credit). Thanks to everyone.
  And since we're in the "1 2 3 4," 
we want to salute all the musicians 
who, in these five years, have played, 
are playing, and will play for peace 
with justice and dignity.
   All have said stop the war.  Some 
have recorded disks, others participated
in concerts, or visited indigenous 
communities, or spoke in favor of a just
and honorable peace, or protested against 
the Acteal massacre, or gave us their 
instruments as presents, or dedicated 
one or more songs to the struggle of 
the indigenous Mexicans.  
  Thanks to all these musicians who, 
in Mexico and all the world, echo the
zapateado "Ya Basta!"
  As soon as we win, we are going to 
organize a super-mega-magna-hyper-concert 
for everyone, without any time limit and
for free!  (Yeah, right!  The Marimba of 
San Jose will end up playing alone).
   Vale.  Health, and dont we reach 
tomorrow also with a tarar'n, tarar'n?
From the mountains of Southeast Mexico,
Subcomandante Insurgente Marcos.

notes.
1. The numbers right next to each other are
   thirty-second notes, but don't fret. Just
   "tremelo" these notes a bit and you'll 
   feel for them by the second time you play
   this song, I'm sure of it.
2. I chose to express this in TAB rather 
   than standard notation (and have little 
   intention of ever publishing this in 
   "s.n.") for the same reason Dante chose
   the language he chose for publishing
   "Inferno." If you have no idea what I'm
   talking about please 
	a) go look it up
	b) or delete this song from your 
	   memory and forget you ever
	   knew me. 
3. I will never tell the name of the person
   I wrote this song for (and about) but a
   clue for people who know me well -- I 
   bought a video-cassette from her in 1997
4. This is part 1 of about 4 parts. I will 
   have to come up with a way to signify
   the repeats before I type the last 
   part. I wish to keep this easily played
   but exactly as I play it in case anyone
   wants to catch the exact same vibe.
5. Please 
   a) distribute this far and wide,
   b) always keep my name with it;
   c) never make money off of it.
6. Each of the chords in part 1 are played
   dragging the three fingernails (m,a and
   the "pinky" from the bass-most note to 
   the treble high in one quick snap. 
7. (v) = vibrato. very demonstrative. No
   other vibratos the first time through
   will make these two notes "hit home" 
   best.
8. The following words are very important
   to this song.
   a) !presente!
   b) basta
   c) nunca mas
