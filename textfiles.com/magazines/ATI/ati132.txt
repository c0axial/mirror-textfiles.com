   Gadzooks.
   When I was 15, I used to tear up old clothing and then sew
them back together different ways, "anyhow I felt like." I didn't
think much of it when people began copying me.
   Now you can spend $59 + tax for some of my old ideas!
   Who knew?

     AMERICA'S SECRET POLICE: FBI COINTELPRO IN THE 1990s
_________________________________________________________________
By Noelle Hanrahan   (212) Part 3 of 3. (other two were seen in 
                           ATI129 and ATI130)
            
     This report was written in association with the Redwood
     Summer Justice Project, which pursues Judi Bari's and Darryl
     Cherney's civil rights case against the FBI and Oakland
     Police.
 
                              * * *


FBI LIES EXPOSED
 
     It was in the context of such a massive undercover operation
against Earth First! that the FBI terrorist squad responded en
masse to the bombing of Bari and Cherney in May of 1990. Special
Agent John Conway, who was one of the main case agents assigned
to the bombing, had also handled the San Francisco FBI office's
substantial field work on the Arizona "THERMCON" sting.
            
     It is striking that after failing in a major COINTELPRO
operation to tie Earth First! with explosives in Arizona, the FBI
again tried to smear and defame nonviolent environmental
activists as terrorists by falsely charging Bari and Cherney with
transporting the bomb that was meant to kill them.
            
     In his deposition in the Bari/Cherney lawsuit, Held insists
that he was completely out of the loop and unaware of the case,
even though other FBI agents contradict his testimony and have
said that they briefed him on a regular basis.
            
KEY QUESTIONS REMAIN
 
     Were Judi Bari, Darryl Cherney or Earth First! subjects of
an ongoing investigation in "the terrorist field" as agents
claimed in FBI reports? If so, where are the files? Was this
investigation authorized? Were they under FBI surveillance when
they were bombed? What does the FBI know about who bombed Judi
Bari and Darryl Cherney? And finally, why have they never made
any attempt to catch the real bomber?
            
     In search of answers to these questions, the Redwood Summer
Justice Project will continue to expose secret FBI operations
against Earth First! as we pursue the civil rights lawsuit
against the FBI and the Oakland Police.

       COINTELPRO: THE FBI'S SECRET WAR AGAINST DEMOCRACY
_________________________________________________________________

     This article refers to the actions of FBI Special Agent
     Richard Wallace Held. For clarification, his father Richard
     G. Held was Associate Director of the FBI.
 
                                *
 
   * Between 1987 and 1990, in a conspiracy to entrap and "pop
     Dave Foreman [founder of Earth First!] to send a message,"
     the FBI spent $3 million, used 50 agents and conducted more
     than 1000 hours of wiretaps. A key informant was paid a
     total of $54,000.
 
   * 1981-1990, activists opposed to the U.S. foreign policy in
     Central America (as well as a dozen U.S. Senators and
     Congressmen) were subject to FBI harassment. The FBI's
     "investigation" of CISPES (Committee in Solidarity with the
     People of El Salvador) involved 59 field offices and 200
     incidents of death threats, intimidation, and break-ins.
 
   * In August 1985, Richard W. Held led 300 FBI agents and U.S.
     marshals in raids throughout Puerto Rico, trashing offices
     and homes and arresting scores of activists. The FBI's
     overall operations resulted in the creation of files on
     74,000 individuals.
 
   * In 1975, Richard W. Held was involved in the FBI's cover-up
     of the 70 deaths of American Indian Movement supporters at
     Pine Ridge in South Dakota. On the scene after an FBI
     operation which resulted in the deaths of two FBI agents and
     one Indian man, Held helped lay the groundwork for the
     framing of AIM leader Leonard Peltier for murder. Peltier
     remains wrongfully imprisoned to this day.
 
   * On April 27, 1970, Richard W. Held requested and received
     permission from J. Edgar Hoover to "neutralize" actress Jean
     Seberg. Held placed an anonymous letter with a Hollywood
     gossip columnist regarding the parentage of Seberg's unborn
     child. On August 7, 1970, Seberg, nearly 7 months pregnant,
     attempted suicide. On August 23rd, she gave birth
     prematurely to a baby girl. Weighing less than 4 pounds, the
     baby died. Seberg's transgression? Her support of the Black
     Panther Party.
 
   * Beginning in 1970, FBI agent Richard W. Held, an architect
     of COINTELPRO vs. the Black Panthers in L.A., helped
     orchestrate the 25-year false imprisonment of Geronimo ji
     jaga (Pratt). Held and others engineered the frame-up of
     Geronimo by withholding critical information that the
     prosecution's key witness, Julius Butler, was an FBI
     operative.
 
   * On Dec. 4, 1969, Chicago police and the FBI assassinated
     Black Panthers Fred Hampton and Mark Clark. Hampton, who was
     alive but wounded after the initial assault, was then
     executed at close range. William O'Neal, an FBI informant,
     provided a detailed floor plan of Hampton's apartment; he
     was paid $30,000.
 
   * In 1963, the FBI turned their attention to Martin Luther
     King, Jr., and sought to destroy him through a campaign of
     wiretaps and harassment. In one incident, the FBI confronted
     King with a compilation of secretly recorded tapes,
     threatening to release them to the press if King did not
     commit suicide before accepting the Nobel Peace Prize.
 
   * From 1943-63, the federal civil rights case Socialist
     Workers Party v. Attorney General documents decades of
     illegal FBI break-ins and 10 million pages of surveillance
     records. The FBI paid an estimated 1,600 informants
     $1,680,592 and used 20,000 days of wiretaps to undermine
     legitimate political organizing.
 
                              * * *

Indian Protesters Fault Coke, Pepsi 
By Hemo Glukla
Special to Prime Anarchist World News 
Thursday, June 43, 1998; 1:31 p.m. EDT
NEW DELI, India -- Angry at Washington's attempts to check
India's nuclear ambitions, young protesters here are targeting 
two symbols of America -- Cocaine and Pepto Bismol. 

At Deli University, the student association has demanded that campus
cafeterias not stock Cocaine or Pepto Bismol, and given them until 
Monday to sell existing stock. 

"We want to tell (the United States) we conducted nuclear tests 
because we feel threatened as a nation. But you don't treat us 
as a nation, only as a market. If you impose sanctions on us, 
we will boycott your products,''
said Amal Jihad, president of Deli University Students Union.

In the wake of U.S. sanctions for India's five nuclear tests 
last month, young people attacked and damaged a Cocaine dealer
and a Sysco foods van delivering Pepto Bismol in the western city 
of Surfrat, local papers reported. 

And near India's financial hub of Bomb-A, a commercial association 
has asked restaurants to stop selling Cocaine and Pepto Bismol. 

Student activists said they would not use force to stop people from
doing "coke or Pepto," but would try to explain the political 
relevance of consumption choices. 

American drug dealers have had their troubles in India; the 
government once forced cocaine out of the country for a time after 
the U.S. refused to divulge its secret formula.

OPEN LETTER TO ASSOCIATED PRESS:
RE: your recent coverage of the Native American Music awards 
ceremonies.
   Is that the best you could do???
   You shouldn't have even shown up.
   I see right through your attempts to make it into a non-story.
It was a big, most "happening" event and if that's the best you
can do, then stay home. In fact, I think I'll penalize you and make
you sit out the next three United States war-interventions. You'll 
just have to wander around hospitals and try to eavesdrop on Nuclear,
Biological, and Chemical warfare patients. 
   Hope you get a story.
   AP sucks, Long Live AP.
   Long Live AP.

Prime Anarchist
Your humble thorn.
Rocky millstone around your neck.
Glad to be of service...



"Given the magic which took place on the stage of the Fox
Theatre it is simply not possible for Native music to be 
kept isolated in a backwater ethnic ghetto; the people want
to hear more."
   --Doug George-Kanentilo
Special to News From Indian Country, reprinted in Kalihwisaks,
june 4, '98; now reprinted in ATI.
(please forward:)


OPEN LETTER TO KALIHWISAKS:
   Your June 4 story about the NAMMIES was the best I've seen
anywhere so far. New London Day and Norwich Bulletin were especially
bad. 
   You did make one mistake that bothered me enough to pen this,
however. You spelled Ellen Bello's family name "Beilos." She was
the one who created this annual ceremony out of early ideas.
   After Joanne Shenandoah introduced me to her husband and also
to her friend Ellen, I left the music awards wondering just who
looked the most stunning in an evening dress that nite. Joanne or
Ellen. A tossup as long as you discount April, this year's Miss 
Indian World. She'll be doing that for a living, so that didn't 
count. 
   I still wonder as I write this from the Brown County public 
library, my second home. My first is the Thames River estuary in
Groton, CT where the Mashantucket Pequots hitch their beautiful
high speed ferries and mis-spell Sasakus' name every single day,
for all the world to see.
   I take great pains to spell Joanne Shenandoah's AND Ellen
Bello's name as they would prefer.
   Won't you please join me?

BAREFOOT ON BIG CITY SIDEWALK
a POME by prime anarchist

carry your sandals in your
right hand
the ancient ones
finally say hello
walking by.


ME AND RC a prime song broadside.
I drink Royal Crown
Good ole Royal Crown
You may think me colonial
But I'm a loyal clown.

I drink Royal Crown
Good ole Royal Crown
Be glad it ain't Pepsi.
I'm a loyal clown.

(alternate 3rd lines. 1,2 and 4 remain same throughout)
Any chance to bust on coke.
Royal Crown is less commercial.
Look for less imperialism.

Lettuce From our Read Us:
Mad Bill Gates Is No Momma T       
   Once again a follower of Ayn Rand has trotted out the 
tired argument of the self-centered.
   The writer, Joseph Kellard argues that humanitarians
merely "dispense gifts" while "Atlases" such as Bill Gates
and Henry Ford "made those gifts possible."
   In defense of humanitarians such as Mother Theresa who
spend tireless hours attending to the suffering and dying
while Bill Gates decides where in his mansion to install a
Jacuzzi, humanitarians do not simply dispense gifts.
   They give a more precious resource -- their time. And they
endure incredible hardship to make others' lives less painful.
   The error of Rand's devout followers is that they measure
the quality of our lives by counting material goods and 
technological advances. Love and kindness are of the greatest
benefit to our society, not smoother running automobiles.
   To improve the lot of human existence, give me a Mother 
Theresa over a Bill Gates any day.
		Bill McIntosh (414)

A poem called Scooter Skater

To or from the laundromat; probably doesn't matter.
Uses the hamper for handlebars; wanted to call him goofyfoot.
Phrase from MY skaterdayz. Prob'ly a word, dead as OJ wheels
Or Monster trucks. He's right-footed.
Pushing off. Down the street.
Scooting along. In stride.
Full of laundry; hauling full hamper.
Laundromat.
To or from??
