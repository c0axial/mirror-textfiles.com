hola,
how's it going? Prime here to tell
you, are you happy about the millenium
or what?
   How many judges do you know? Are 
any of them NOT wearing glasses? Do
you know if THEY'RE wearing contacts?
Is it me, or is justice nearsighted?
   I overheard this in an "uppy" 
restaurant this morning:
   "We're gonna take the boat over.
Pretend we're on a cruise."
   And I'm reprinting this from a magazine
and that's about it for "publisher" stuff.
On to a brand new mag, eh?

locked, while every unlocked door uncovers
another sullen wage earner, frozen to her
till by the manager's posted rules- or 
worse, a face fresh from a weekend of 
corporate workshops, desperate to move 
product and earn enough to buy that dream
home."

listen, just because one of your

ramble on trying to get others to 
hate us. there are some of us who 
believe in what we do you know and 
we just want to be left alone to do 
our work without distracting hackjobs 
like your writer who's obviously got 
some kind of axe to grind. just because
he turned liberal on us, you don't
have to go broadcasting it all over
the net like some evangelist for 
the left.

CABLE WASTE EFFECTS MILLIONS OF LIVES
EACH YEAR <PAWN>
  by Onayate Nion. Special to prime
anarchist world news.
<INLINE>
Every day in America, thousands of
hours of cable TV end up unwatched.
Companies spend millions of dollars
per minute to air this material, yet
sadly, much of it is never seen by a
significant number of US housholds.
Why?
  There are many reasons: lack of time, 
not enough premium channels-even
people who'd rather "do something else"
than watch TV. Perfectly good cable
signals, tragically wasted...
never reaching their intended target
audience.
   Such a sad waste of our nation's
precious cable resources hurts
everyone: producers, performers,
advertisers - and most of all, the
viewing public.
   But you can do something. Leave
your TV on 24 hours a day. Use your
VCR to tape shows you might miss
while watching others. Watch all
channels, not just your favorites.
And, please, talk to your kids 
about cable waste.
   Together we can stop Cable Waste.
Because TV is something nobody should
have to miss out on.
   For more info on how you can get
involved in the fight against Cable
Waste, call (505)TV4U-24-7

SCHWERIN, Germany (PAWN) - German police 
said they were looking for an escaped
iguana, which a man had earlier tried 
using as currency to pay off his hotel bill.
Rostock police said the 36-year-old man 
had released the 5-foot-long lizard after 
a hotel in the northeastern town refused to
accept his unusual alternative to cash.
At another hotel, police located two 
more young iguanas belonging to the man, 
who was now receiving medical attention.
The police said Monday there was no need
for panic. 
Iguanas apparently pose no danger to humans 
unless they swish their tails when they
feel threatened.

A Prime Anarchist Usenet Reprint

Dear Honored Human Being,
   A cyber-friend of mine asked 
me to send you an email.
As I'm sure you know (or could 
easily check my FBI file for reference) 
I've sent you, Hillary and Chelsea each 
over a dozen snailmails over the years 
asking you to free Mr. Peltier. 
I believe my first letter to you included 
a poem "I know why the caged bird sings," 
and it was cc'd to Amy Carter who was the 
first human to inform me about Peltier's 
shitty situation back in '88 when she and 
I were each attending the Rutgers student 
convention in Jersey. Allan Ginsberg read 
poetry while his boyfriend played a 
stratocaster behind him, and Little Steven
discussed "Music, Media and Modem" with 
Abbie Hoffman and the guy from Peacenet BBS. 
You would have loved it.
   But I digress from a point that's very dear 
to my heart. Right before I sent you that first 
letter, I had played guitar in front of Leavenworth 
for 11 hours. I sang, I screamed, I cried, I jumped 
up and down a lot.
At the end of each song, (well, some of the songs) 
lights would blink on and off in one of the 
cells just to the right of the stairs. 
I bowed a few times. Imagine if you played your 
saxophone there one summer afternoon.
   Please do it, you'll see what I mean. 
"Oye como va."
   Bill, how can I say this without balling 
my eyes out and getting my keyboard so soaking 
wet it shorts out and kills me. All I've ever 
gotten back from you, Hillary or Chelsea is 
embossed cards thanking me for my support 
signed with a blue felt tip pen that I swear 
the same secretary must have forged as letters 
I used to get back from Nixon when I was nine. 
He certainly used the same silly picture
of the White House, and the same blue pen.
    Can I say something really spooky Bill? 
I've stood at your gate playing guitar for 
you at 3 am more than once now. And my overall 
impression?
    Your building must have been designed by 
the same team as them that erected Leavenworth. 
It has the same heavy glow. The rocks breath 
the same. The same little black birds seem to 
visit every day at 4pmand fly overhead 'til the
sun goes down.
     How can you sleep in there knowing your 
administration, MY ADMINISTRATION, keeps a man 
locked up for double-life sentences for supporting 
his elders, for his words, for his views. 
This is not the same america I learned about 
in 3rd grade. The america where freedom rings, 
where all people get an equal shot, where the 
Rocketts shake their foxy legs and cannons go 
off, and red white and blue streamers make me
cry crocodile tears about how proud I am to 
be a Lee Greenwood fan. That could be me in 
Leavenworth, Bill. 
That could be you, you shit. Do something, Bill. 
You're about the only one who can. I know I can't. 
No one gives me enough power. 
If I had your power?
Would I?
     You betcha. I would've done it 
the first time I went to Martha's Vinyard, 
and learned that Plymouth Rock truly WAS
what Columbus was after. And learned that 
Passamoquoddy people say the same thing that 
Pequots do, the same thing Lakotas do, 
the same thing Jews do.
    Let my people go.
    Release more political prisoners; 
make us proud. If only as the last thing you 
do in your administration. If you really
want your trip to Wounded Knee 
(where Eagles bite your nose) 
to have meant something, 
why not announce for Peltier?
Peace and Love,
marco capelli frucht

I feel a rumbling.
Or is it just the end 
of the century I hear?
Or do I just need 
an alkaseltzer?
I believe I feel the drum.
Of course, I feel it wherever 
there is  music, 
and since this year I've surrounded 
myself with music, I guess

I must be INSIDE the drum!
