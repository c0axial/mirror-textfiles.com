Hello, to paraphrase Chevy Chase, "I'm Prime Anarchist and you're
not. How are you? It's been a good week. A really good week.

And now let's hear a parody from Fah-Q

TWO DIGITS FOR A DATE
(To the tune of "Gilligan's Island," more or less)

Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale
Of the doom that is our fate.
That started when programmers used
Two digits for a date.
Two digits for a date.

Main memory was smaller then;
Hard disks were smaller, too.
"Four digits are extravagant,
So let's get by with two.
So let's get by with two."

"This works through 1999,"
The programmers did say.
"Unless we rewrite before that
It all will go away.
It all will go away."

But Management had not a clue:
"It works fine now, you bet!
A rewrite is a straight expense;
We won't do it just yet.
We won't do it just yet."

Now when 2000 rolls around
It all goes straight to Hell,
For zero's less than ninety-nine,
As anyone can tell.
As anyone can tell.

The mail won't bring your pension check
It won't be sent to you
When you're no longer sixty-eight,
But minus thirty-two.
But minus thirty-two.

The problems we're about to face
Are frightening, for sure.
And reading every line of code
It's the only certain cure.
It's the only certain cure.

(key change, big finish)

There's not much time,
There's much too code.
(And Cobol-coders, few)
When the century is finished with,
We may be finished, too.
We may be finished, too.

Eight thousand years from now I hope
That things weren't left too late,
And people aren't then lamenting
Four digits for a date.
Four digits for a date.

That was by Fah-Q (217)

Letter to the Editor:
Rubbing out the Indians...Its the American Way.

Few of my nights pass undisturbed by the images of the 46 unarmed 
Tzotzil Indian refugees mostly women and children murdered in 
cold blood, while attending Mass, gunned down by 60 heavily armed 
behemoths who descended upon the quiet mountain village of 
Chenalho in Chiapas Mexico on 11/22/97. Those brown-skinned refugees 
who escaped slaughter in the village fled into the thicket and caves 
along the stream in the valley below only to be hunted down like 
animals, their blood staining the earth to continue till today the
uninterrupted legacy of the European Conquest of the New World.

The founding, development and growing global hegemony of the 
American Empire is predicated upon eradicating pockets of indigenous 
resistance to the New World Order (a system of macroeconomic 
relationships in operation long before Bush used phrase).  Indian 
Killing didn't stop with King George's 1755 proclamation given 
from the Boston Chambers offering up to fifty Pounds for Indian 
Scalps, male and female, children and adults. Nor was the devastating 
Euro-American expansion westward to the Pacific, the "Trail of Tears", 
or Wounded Knee the last of American sponsored indigenous bloodshed. 
The routine virginal sacrifice conducted by the Inca Priesthood to 
protect their empire from the State ravages of the Conquistadors does 
not compare with the indiscriminate native bloodletting that is 
routine in this century on the periphery of the ever-expanding 
globalization of modern economics, where native defense of their 
own lands and autochthonous ways is routinely met with automatic 
gunfire and the sounds of crying children. Our hired guns will finish 
off what's not taken care of by the IMF and World Bank.

President Clinton's call for an outside inquiry into the recent Chiapas
Massacre is a charade. An inquiry of any depth is not in American 
interests! The ruling party in Mexico receives U.S. aid in the 
form of weapons, personnel transport (Hum-Vees), attack and 
surveillance aircraft, Satellite based intelligence reports, and 
training of Mexican "Special Forces" at U.S. military bases 
including Fort. Bragg and Fort. Benning.


Wherever the indigenous are tortured, maimed, imprisoned and 
displaced (East Timor, Burma, West Papua, South Molucca, Nigeria, 
Colombia, Angola, Turkey, Etc!) No self-respecting U.S. news 
reporter will inquire into the role U.S. capital and direct 
military aid plays in this murder and mayhem. Indigenous sacrifice 
to forces of modernization is an American rite.

PAWN - (Birmingham) TRUTH BE KNOWN, CLINTON DIGS BRITISH CHICKS.
   "I think I'm the luckiest girl alive," Marge Potter, 69, told
Prime Anarchist World News reporters friday. "I've spoken to, and
I've had my arm squeezed by, President Clinton."
   It was at her suggestion that Group of Seven become Group of Eight
last night.
   "I told him," said the 69 year old White House poster girl, 
   "'Add Jakarta,' he hadn't heard of Jakarta before I mentioned it.
One look at my brand new panties and my 110 pound hair-do and he
was hooked. Jakarta joined Group of Eight and the rest was history.
Potter said she even got Hillary hooked on Jakarta.
   "If it weren't for that English woman letting my husband squeeze her,"
said the first lady, now known as the Royal Oui, "Our foreign policy
with Jakarta would be unknown."

     AMERICA'S SECRET POLICE: FBI COINTELPRO IN THE 1990s
_________________________________________________________________
By Noelle Hanrahan   (212) Part 1 of 3. (other two will be seen in 
                           ATI130 and ATI131)
            
     This report was written in association with the Redwood
     Summer Justice Project, which pursues Judi Bari's and Darryl
     Cherney's civil rights case against the FBI and Oakland
     Police.
 
                              * * *
            
     On April 22, 1970, as 22 million Americans rallied across
the country on the first Earth Day celebration, FBI agents in
over 40 cities were ordered to spy on and infiltrate these
events. Senator Edwin Muskie, himself a victim, remarked from the 
floor of Congress that this surveillance was "a dangerous threat
to fundamental constitutional rights." The power of the
environmental movement and the challenge it posed to business-as-
usual made it an instant target for FBI suppression.
            
     Twenty years later on May 24, 1990, a shrapnel-wrapped car
bomb went off under noted Earth First! activist Judi Bari's car
seat, nearly killing her and injuring fellow organizer Darryl
Cherney. Even more frightening to Bari, as she woke up in the
hospital intensive care unit under armed guard, was the
realization that a major FBI "counter-intelligence" operation
against Earth First! was underway.
            
     Within minutes of their arrival on the scene of the blast,
the FBI was falsely characterizing nonviolent environmental
organizers Bari and Cherney as "terrorists". Within hours, the
Oakland Police Department had arrested and detained them for
transporting explosives. It was not enough that the two leaders
had been physically blown up; the FBI immediately began to
orchestrate a disinformation campaign designed to discredit and
imprison these activists and destroy Earth First!
            
     What could make nonviolent environmental organizers the
targets of repression? Back in May 1990, Earth First! in the
redwood region was gearing up for "Mississippi Summer in the
California Redwoods," a bold call that would draw thousand of
activists to Mendocino and Humboldt counties. Earth First!'s
fierce, grassroots, pro-labor campaign of mass nonviolent civil
disobedience was determined to stop corporate timber's
liquidation of the old-growth forests. Even in the face of the
attempted assassination of the key organizers and a well-
orchestrated FBI disinformation campaign, thousands came to
Redwood Summer, bringing national attention to the destruction of
the redwood forest ecosystem. It is a testimony to the power of
the movement mobilized by Judi Bari that today, eight years
later, protests to save the old growth forests are more dynamic
than ever.
                              ______
 
     It is absolutely foolish to suggest that the FBI was
     involved in anything that would obstruct justice.
     -- Richard W. Held, FBI
 
     These guys are professional liars, who have raised selective
     memory loss to an art form. 
     -- Judi Bari, Earth First!
                              ______

As per usual these days; and "par for the course" we end
with a poem. Because after all is said and done, all we've
got left is myth:


WALKING BY PFIZER ON ONE FOGGY EVENING, 
I see rust like I've never seen before.
I see and smell mushrooms growing between 
Pavement and sidewalk like I've never seen/smelled
Anywhere else.

I feel/see mist like I've never tongued before.
I hear industrial noises unmatched by anyone;
Probably protected by patent and/or allowed
By Fast Track.

I feel vibes nowhere else matched.
Wait - didn't I walk by a Proctor & Gamble once?
If I have, I've done it a thousand times.

No animals were 
        abused in the 
                making of this 
                        poem.
