And Shephard Smith is back on the air. Umm, wtf???

  Herein Lies the primeanarchist column.
I dub this one "punditry without proper
preface."
  You ready?
  Oh, Don't EVEN get me started on Cheney.
There's a long range missile named after
him in Laramie Wyoming, you know. Trust me, I 
know. I was stationed in colorado springs when 
they named it.
  They friggin' named it after him during
the Panama invasion. I have NO IDEA WHAT
their rationale was, beyond pro-war-propaganda.
What did he do? And more to the point, what's
his wife up to? She's one of the most unamerican
pieces of carbon based flesh God ever created.
I'm not even going to go there.
  And his daughter? Elitist bitch, she. And, I
seldom use that term loosely, people. I was dating
someone at Colorado College who was friends with
her roommate. The year that Desert Shield was 
becoming Desert Storm she was extra venomous 
toward the local riff-raff (all 700 of us) who
were protesting not only that war, but her
father!!! Things got pretty ugly. She was one
of the orchestrators of the local weekly yuppie 
pro-war/anti-protestor protests across the street 
from our seven month vigil. Yeah, every friday
night for a couple months. Our bosses in the army 
would say very very very conflict-of-interest-oriented 
things like, (yes I was active duty army signal corps
awaiting my honorable medical discharge by day, anti-
war protestor sleeping on the Interstate 115 median 
by nite.) those who go can pick a day off the 
following week, or if you need to leave work early
friday to get ready for protests, feel free. Dress
nice, please gently inform the press that you're
not allowed to speak on behalf of the military
while you're there.
  Yeah, they would come out there from 5-6:30 and
then again from 9-10:30 hoping to get lots and
lots of media coverage. Yeah, I wish the media
had the cookies to film Cheney one of those nites
in her mini-skirt getting cold the minute it got 
dark, wrapped tightly in her 5'X 9' US flag, because 
her letter jacket wasn't warm enough to cover her 
goosebumps.
  One corner dragging on the ground!!! 
  The media also didn't film us bringing them thirty
five blankets one January night free, no strings 
attached only suggesting that they consider staying 
the night, if they were so convicted, and sure of
their beliefs.
  There's Dick Cheney's yuppy daughter, half-patriot
she. Paints a pretty picture, huh?

And this just in from Gauntlet 'Zine:
  Rage Against the Machine have already apologized twice to 
fans who were booted off Napster for downloading their new 
album, but on Thursday (December 14) they put their music 
where their mouths are by releasing a batch of free music 
and videos online.
  The band released eight streaming video clips of live 
performances and 15 downloadable MP3 files via their Web site. 
The MP3s include instrumental versions of most of the tracks 
on Renegades, Rage's new covers album.
  "We make music first and foremost for our fans, and we want 
them to have access to it," guitarist Tom Morello said in a 
statement. "We want to apologize to our fans, and it is 
important to us to make it right."
  Perhaps fittingly, in light of the October departure of 
singer Zack de la Rocha, the MP3s include suitable-for-karaoke 
instrumental versions of such songs as Bruce Springsteen's 
"The Ghost of Tom Joad" and Bob Dylan's "Maggie's Farm."
  Other MP3s include live versions of the band's own "Killing 
in the Name," "Guerilla Radio" and "Sleep Now in the Fire," 
as well as the MC5's "Kick Out the Jams." The live MP3s were 
recorded at a June concert in Sweden, while the streaming videos 
on the site document performances from various overseas dates 
this summer.
  Napster banned a number of users trading songs from Rage's 
new album last week at the behest of the band's management and 
its label. But Morello said the bans were a "horrible mistake," 
and that the group's management company failed to consult the 
band before taking action.
  Rage Against the Machine are helping fans regain access to the 
file-trading service by posting a software fix on the Rage Web 
site. They've also asked Sony Music, which is in the midst of 
suing Napster for copyright infringement, to help fans get 
back onto the service.

From NNStuff (tm) typed in by Patrick W who spotted 
it on the web site of New Scientist : 
 
A GOOD story deserves a good airing. What follows was spotted 
in Bike magazine, which had spotted it in Pilot magazine. 
Two members of the Lothian and Borders traffic police were
recently having a pleasant time out on the Scottish moors, 
trapping speeding motorists with a radar gun. Suddenly 
their equipment went crazy, registering a speed of over 
300 miles per hour. It then locked up completely. Seconds 
later the startled boys in blue understood why, as a low-flying 
Harrier jet screamed over their heads. Upset that their radar
gun had been broken, the policemen put in a complaint to the 
Royal Air Force-only to discover that the damage could easily 
have been much worse. The RAF informed them that the Harrier's
target-seeker had locked on to what it had interpreted as enemy 
radar. This immediately triggered an automatic air-to-surface 
missile attack. Fortunately for the two policemen, the Harrier 
was operating unarmed.

TOO MANY W'S MIGHT F IT ALL UP
Bristol, CONN. (PAWN) - World Wildlife Fund and World Wrestling 
Federation Merger spells e-x-t-r-a--w-o-r-k for alliteration 
experts and linguists.
  That's right, the Young Panda has a new buddy. And it's not
Jesse "The Boa" Ventura, but you're close. WWF Global Network
has teamed up in a merger with the WWF for some ESPN powerplugs.
  "We think we can take the US right out of her recession before
it even quite gets there," said Cisco Frisco, a Houston DBase 
programmer for one of the two corporations that are about to
become as one.
  "We'll just tackle all the usual issues like forests, climate 
change, oceans, species, increasingly intensive fishing practices, 
such as long-lining and trawling, and we'll find out who's screwing
it up so we can body slam 'em."
  Things will never be the same, according to a report released 
today by WWWWFF. The corporation will reside in the vacuuous area
between I-95 and the western Mass/Conn border.
Description: WWWWFF is now the world's largest country.
