"Post-Election Angst"
by Dan Seymour
Special to Activist Times.

  [Seymour fills in this week for Prime Anarchist.
   Anarchist will resume columnizing sometime in 
   the near-to-notso-near future.]

   Given the unbearably close nature of this year's 
presidential election, I really hate to throw even 
more excrement into an already clogged toilet, but 
I've got a gripe and I've got it bad. This complaint 
will no doubt delight conspiracy theorists and political 
cynics such as myself; indeed, I expect that the Green 
Party will have a parade. Maybe they'll even have a ball
pit that I can play around in. I love ball pits.
   The truth is that the last thing I want to do is stir 
up even more controversy when all I want is to hear more 
about the Knicks and less about Gore on the news, but I 
feel that it's my civic duty to bitch and moan, even at 
the risk of sounding like a small child who by some unjust 
twist of fate was actually given the right to vote.
   But the fact of the matter is that as a 21 year-old, 
I do (supposedly) have the write to vote, notwithstanding 
my felony convictions (just joking.) 
   The requirement for property ownership to vote, I believe, 
was abolished in the late 1980s. And in this election, my 
right to vote was abridged, not because of the color of my 
skin or because of a confusing butterfly ballot, but because 
of a massive conspiracy against college students. Allow me to
elaborate.
   There is, it may surprise you to know, a clandestine 
conspiracy to keep college students from voting. The motive? 
College students are more likely to vote for hippies and pinkos 
and tree-huggers and libertarians and write-in weirdos and other 
 such also-rans. The last thing the existing government needs is 
  growing support for people like Jesse "The Body" Ventura and
   Ralph Nader, and probably the biggest thorn in the existing 
    government's side in this respect is college students. 
   College students, at least the ones who actually vote, have 
  a tendency to write-in "Mickey Mouse" or "I.P. Freely."
 The first problem for the college students, however, is that 
election day is held on a Tuesday when nearly every school is 
still in session, which means that they can't vote in their 
home county unless they attend school close to home, which is
for lamers, and lamers vote conservative anyway. 
   So, if you're a college student away from home on election day, 
what's the  alternative? In some cases, it's not voting at all, 
which obviously appears to be what the majority of us do. This 
is just fine by the politicians.
   They saw and were deeply frightened by what unified, educated,
and politicallY aware college students who put their heads together 
were capable of when that frat guy swallowed 72 goldfish however 
long ago. (Didn't he die?)
   But for that small percentage of us college students that would 
actually like to exercise our right as citizens and cast our vote, 
the absentee ballot is our only reasonable option. And here's where 
the conspiracy comes in.
   About a month before the presidential election, I sent in my 
application for an absentee ballot. As of right now, about three 
months later, I am still waiting for it. I've talked to many fellow 
college students who have also said that they never got their absentee
ballots. What could be responsible for this? Filing errors? This is 
the government we're talking about here!
   Columbia House doesn't make those kinds of mistakes.
   So I think the most viable explanation is also the simplest one: 

      there is a widespread, underhanded conspiracy 
      to keep college students from voting. 

   Why else would they have asked me on my application if I attended
college? Stupidly I said yes, and consequently did not vote in the 
closest election in history. We're talking about a tremendous 
demographic here. I know you're probably sick of reading about 
Nader by now, but my vote would have been cast for Nader, and 
Ralph Nader needed every vote he could get. This is truly a shame 
since it's obvious he's just about the only man in politics who is 
interested in the common good rather than soft money and Japanese 
hookers. (Well, everyone's interested in Japanese hookers. But the 
soft money part's still true.) 
   Of course, he will never come close to rivaling the support of any 
politician who is fortunate enough to run under the ticket labeled
 "Democrat" or "Republican" because nobody believes that change is 
  possible. Nobody, of course, except young people. 
   Throughout our nation's history, it has been the old farts who 
    backed stale and boring causes like tough-on-crime silliness, 
   and it has traditionally been the young people who backed and 
  energized progressive causes, like consuming dangerous amounts 
 of LSD (a cause still widely supported on college campuses across 
the nation.) Even though it's fun, however, LSD isn't enough 
(although it sure as hell comes close.) It is  nearly impossible 
to engineer a fundamental grass-roots political movement if denied 
the right to vote. All the LSD in the world will not put Ralph Nader 
in charge, although it will greatly enhance the appreciation of 
Credence Clearwater Revival.
   So it's unfortunate that it's the old farts who are in charge, 
and have the authority to tell their secretary, probably a 
sixty-something woman named "Claire" with curly hair who wears 
too much make-up and chews gum, to please disregard all applications 
for absentee ballots from college students.
   That way they can conveniently throw away a large number of the 
votes for Nader and Mickey Mouse and I.P. Freely. But my whole point 
is those are the more  important and interesting votes, the votes 
that tell us what people really think. Those are the votes that 
don't come out of fear, as did so many would-be Nader votes that 
instead went for Gore. Those votes are the voices  of our youth.
   Not that Washington cares about the voice of America's youth. 
This mostly stems from the common myth that the voice of America's 
youth sounds a lot like Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit. So they're all 
getting fatter and don't see a need for change, so what do they do? 
Silence the voices that are difficult to hear.
   This is all to say nothing, of course, of the extraordinary 
difficulty of the absentee ballot process in the first place. 
 From school, I began the process of getting an absentee ballot 
  in September. I had to write to my county clerk to get an 
   application for an absentee ballot, and he sent it to me. 
    Then I sent in the application for the absentee ballot. 
     Assuming he had sent me the ballot, I would have had to 
    send it back. That's five mail crosses for one vote. One 
   dollar and sixty five cents for one vote. While the process 
  is a nuisance and impossibly complex for us, it's really quite 
 convenient for the politicians. They get to keep telling everyone 
that less than half of all people vote, which keeps the public 
disinterested. Public apathy leads to less scrutiny, which leads 
   to more they can get away with. It's a very simple process, and 
   it doesn't appear that young progressive movements have much of 
   a chance of breaking the cycle. How can they, when the absentee 
   ballot process, the only feasible option for the majority of 
   college students who wish to vote, is so impossibly complicated 
   and corrupt?
     I think it's sad, it really is. What else is there for me to do? 
   I can't vote, and politicians certainly aren't going to listen 
   directly to my demands, although if they did I can assure you 
   that we would see a lot more laws forcing people to dress up like 
   Batman. As long as I'm not able to vote, however, I'll just do what 
   the rest of young America does, namely load up on LSD and listen to 
   some Credence to ease the pain.

THE LETTUCE LINE FORMS TO THE RIGHT...



thanks  that  is  sweet  and  the  same  to  u !  :)
amy


congrats everyone!

this summer's webzine event made it into the "GENERATOR"
section of the design, fashion, and culture magazine
called *surface. we're listed alongside RESFest, Betalounge 
and about 25 other new American projects that support
modern creativity. they don't have a web site that I can
locate so you'll just have to run out and pick up a 
copy for yourself. we're listed as number 1. again, I'd
like to say thanks to everyone that contributed to the
event. we've made the world a better place!

also, sorry I've been dormant on the list for awhile... I
have just returned from travelling for the past 2.5 months.
        
anyone want to help out with planning for webzine 2001?
let me know: ryan@webzine2000.com
best,
ryan j.


to ati@etext.org:
It is interesting that Zoran Djindjic had been declared Serbia's 
future prime minister by the western media and pollsters weeks 
before the Dec. 23 election.  And that Djindjic had started to 
make some cabinet appointments also well before the votes had 
been cast (see the NYT story).
  Isn't democracy a wonderful thing?
  Wonder then why the voter turnout dropped form 75% in 
September to 60% in December?
  Happy New Year!
Bob Dj.

     The results are not known
       The will of the people
       was clearly not shown
But let's stop all the quarreling
           Let bitterness pass
      I'll hug your elephant
    You kiss my ass."

December 29, 2000 (first anniversary of victory over eToys)
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMPOSTURE, PREDATION MARK 2000 TONE
The WTO becomes honest, children get "tough love" from corporate 
predators, and the elections really were auctioned off after all
  At RTMark, the rough-and-tumble Year 2000 was dominated by 
significant cultural payoffs, as well as one obvious failure.
  And preparing the way for the year's funniest moment was 
RTMark's first-quarter transfer of Gatt.org 
              (http://rtmark.com/gatt.html) to a group of 
impostors known as The Yes Men (http://www.theyesmen.org/wto/), 
who have maintained the site ever since.

IMPOSTORS MAKE THE WTO HONEST

The transfer paid off in May, when an organizer of a conference for 
lawyers specializing in international trade matters visited Gatt.org and, 
without reading the text very closely, clicked "Contact" to invite WTO 
Director-General Mike Moore to speak. "Moore" declined but offered to send 
a substitute.

A DOWNTURN FOR A DEMOCRACY

Voteauction.com (http://rtmark.com/voteauction.html), the "private-sector 
solution" of which Dr. Bichlbauer spoke, itself formed the largest 
dividend of 2000 for the RTMark investor. Newspaper and TV journalists who 
covered the story often found ways to mention that corporations already 
buy votes--exactly the point founder James Baumgartner had hoped would be 
made. (Baumgartner is currently planning a spring lecture tour to help 
defray legal costs he incurred fighting lawsuits before the ACLU came to 
his rescue. He can be reached at mailto:voteauction@mail.com.)

But 2000 was certainly not all free speech and good luck. And the year's 
biggest disappointment began with 1999's biggest triumph.

ETOYS IS DEAD (NEARLY)! LONG LIVE FERRERO!

One year ago today, eToys capitulated to activist pressure--
which some say had helped drive down its stock price, 
recently sighted at $0.03--and officially gave up its 
attempt to steal an art group's domain name 
(http://rtmark.com/etoy.html). 

ON THE HORIZON
http://www.deportation-alliance.com/lh/english.html
http://rtmark.com/corpoetry.html)

RTMark's primary goal is to publicize corporate subversion 
of the democratic process. To this end it acts as a 
clearinghouse for anti-corporate projects.

        Missy Chimovitz.
