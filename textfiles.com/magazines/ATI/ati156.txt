hola hermanobrothers and hermanasisters,
happy fullmoon. as i say every bigwidemoon, "luna! i take no
responsibility for the things i'm about to say and do. wet, 
tidal forces are upon me and i can't possibly claim to control
any of it... 
i'm prime anarchist and rather than write a column for this week,
i'll paste in a letter i wrote to my friend in Swiss Hell. It has
wider appeal than just his inbox, so i figured i'd share. 
(alright, who sarcastically thanked me for sharing...)

SCHOOL OF AMERICAS NOTES by Prime Anarchist
Hey There,
If they used a wide enough camera to show a guy with a 
fugazi t-shirt and an olive drab kokopeli minnesota hat 
that was me. I saw that the next nite and I think CNN went 
narrow whereas Fox had me in there. So I was probably
just "stage left" of him looking chubby, nervous and excited 
about what came next. 
   That was perhaps one hour before we stormed the gates and
pretty much busted down Jericho, Babylon and Bill Gates' house. 
OK, I exaggerate a bit, but it felt really good to watch them 
cave when we were three times as many people as they 
prepared to contain and ignore.

> What's goin' on with Brian Wilson these days?
> We saw Martin Sheen at the protest on

happy reading,

Dear SOA Watchers,
I will be interviewed on Jean Ferraca tomorrow 11/2/98 (WED) from 
10:00 to 11:00 a.m. NPR on the SOA.  It would be great if you 
could call in to share your experience of the vigil at Ft. Benning, 
why you went, what you learned and felt, and the energy/action 
plans you have returned home with.  This interview is really for 
all of us, and I can use all the help I can get.  Madison has gotten 
some excellent press coverage.

Hi Michael,
Lisa just gave me permission to put the entire poem 
in the 'zine, so I'll have it in this weekend.
I'll type it in here for your enjoyment, and then 
I'll cut and paste it to notepad.
    [ATI. Sharing Freely, Openly of Inner Dynamic since 1888]

I AM NOT THE   K I N G   O F   B E E R S
      a poem by Lisa Martinovic

So I need a little help understanding something
a phenomenon that defies all logic
yet one that's as common as dirt
What am I talking about?
average people - millions of them
working ceaselessly in the employ of major corporations
in addition to their day jobs - and without pay
that's right, they're in our midst
and you still don't know what I'm talking about, do you?
well, maybe you're one of them
maybe you're sitting in the audience at this very moment
unthinkingly wearing a Nike hat or a Budweiser t-shirt
maybe you never thought of yourself as a walking
billboard
doing the dirty work for some corporate ad man who 
makes more money in one year than you'll see in a lifetime
and not only are you not getting paid
you actually put out good money to BUY that cheesy
billboard
from that criminally rich corporation
so you can walk around all day long doing Mr. Nike's job

Beats the fuck out of me

and what glorious benefits do WE receive 
in exchange for our role as foot soldiers
on the front lines of the consumer wars

surely no one is fooled into thinking
maybe I'm one of the lesser known Olympic athletes who
in fact                     DOES
get paid to wear Reboks

dream on, bubba

I think it's a virtual drug for a nation of naked emperors 
trying desperately to find a ready-make image to step into
so they don't have to bother with all the complicated and
tiresome                  work of
character building

do I get that Pepsi feeling when I pull on the windbreaker

am I identifying myself with
rugged pre-cancerous individualism in the old West
as I notch up my Marlboro belt buckle

in my black Harley muscle shirt
do I have the power to intimidate you
letting you think I'm some crazed Hells Angel
who might go off on a methamphetamine rampage
if I caught you staring at my tattos

and maybe I think I'm better than Mr. King of Beers
because
I'm wearing this ultra-hip Grateful Dead tie-died number
cool, man, so, like, uh, I'm a counterculture shill for some 
monolithic record company that's also not paying me to
advertise their product

regarding my stone-washed silk Dallas Cowboys bomber
jacket
I'll leave you guessing
either I am one
or I'm  FRIENDS  with one 
or this purchase is my clever way of tithing to the Cowboy's 
	  cocaine fund
you be the judge

I like to think my Batman sweatshirt imbues me with an aura of
mystery
Will you ascribe to me superhuman powers and righteous
dogoodosity
in the face of a terminally evil world
holy horseshit - you must be bat brain dead, buck-o

surely it's different if I'm wearing a location on my back
I just know I can impress you if
I've ridden a mule on Molokai or skied Everest
you may even fall in love with the spirit of adventure my garb
suggests
why bother with small talk when my t-shirt tells you right away
the most exciting thing you'll ever know about me 
but for god's sake I don't even know Tommy Hilfiger

why would I want him broadcasting from atop my tits?

And for that matter I'm not
the King of Beers, the Marlboro Man, the ghost of Jerry Garcia
Troy Aikman or the Grand Canyon
so, no, I won't advertise your
brew or smoke, sneaker, album, haberdashery or concession
stand
not even if you paid me
because I don't want to be part of any
god damn corporation's master plan for
mass inter-cranial penetration and global domination
it just ain't gonna happen folks

oh, my t-shirt?
the one with the Full Sail Ale logo plastered on the back?
this is from the 1996 national Poetry Slam
you're goddamn right that's different!
I mean, this really  *is*  good beer
besides
any corporation can buy a garden variety
corn fed plumped up consumer unit
It takes a micro-brewerey to buy a poet

Tomorrow isn't here yet, Hughes -
You're still in the kitchen.

Turn of the century,
We're nowhere fast, man.

Gentrification is still a $20 word
I can't afford.

Outa sight, man.

And... not white.

You two are America.

WHEN IS A PATRIOT LIKE A WOMAN TAKING OFF 
ALL HER CLOTHES: And Vice Versa. 
    A Column by Steven Slosberg.

What, precisely, is the difference between the two enterprises?

Football and female exotics, cut from the same cloth, so to speak.

Both feed on fundamental human sensibilities: Voyeurism, fantasy, 
lust and commerce, yet one is embraced and the other shunned.
In one venue, men are paid to use their bodies to maim and crack 
one another and accomplish, in the end, precisely nothing other 
than crossing a line and entertaining a throng of goobers, many 
with painted faces. In the other, women are paid to use their bodies 
to hurt no one, cross the line and entertain a crowd of goobers, many 
with oily complexions.

The ambiance in a football stadium is a red-blooded, boisterous crowd, 
much of it loaded, urging their esteemed 380-pound former 
scholar-athletes to bump and grind. In a strip club, the 
red-blooded audience, most of it loaded, is urgently rapt as 
their fallen aerobics idols bump and grind.

The football crowd gets off watching men in tight pants and 
artificially enhanced upper bodies. The club crowd gets off watching 
women in thongs or less and artificially enhanced upper bodies.
Football does what it can to objectify women as well. Pro cheerleaders, 
among our most prized embodiments of anonymous T & A, are out there 
showing adults and children what meaningful roles women can aspire to.
Lap dancers, as ordinances will allow, do it indoors, out of sight from 
neighboring schools, churches and lottery outlets.
So football gets embraced as an ideal, and gentlemen's clubs -
take a look at just who owns pro football teams, by the way - are bashed.
In both venues, owners make a bundle off the bodies of disposable 
hirelings: Men and women, in their handsome prime and exercising 
God-given (and often surgeon-sanctioned) talent to maximize 
earnings during careers of precarious lengths.

For the social reformers, if nothing is more pathetic than an aging 
stripper with no future and a misspent youth, go to a reunion of 
pro football players and log how many can still walk, how many are 
free of dope, or, to be benign, painkillers, and, in fact, how many 
are on parole.

Good neighbor? Surely the policing around a strip club is as vigilant 
as around any football stadium, all those two-fisted tailgaters included.
Getting to and from the club in Pawcatuck, proposed for the former site 
of Rosalini's, a restaurant and then a nightclub, set back from Route 2 
near the Route 78 connector, has to be more convenient than exiting any 
urban football stadium. The Rosalini's site could not be better situated 
for unobtrusive comings and goings.

People argue how one show enhances a community and the other affronts 
it.  Pro football, always a growth industry for office pools and 
Vegas oddsmakers, survives utterly on the public, desperate 
for something to do on a Sunday, standing around screaming and 
shivering. The strip club in Pawcatuck, or whatever the owners decide 
to have there, is in the shadow of the largest gambling emporium 
in the galaxy. So which one doesn't fit in?

Again, one venue, built on voyeurism, fantasy and bodies in motion and 
pain for no apparent reason, gets sanctioned, while the other, selling 
precisely the same enticements, without the pain and in private, gets 
the bum's rush.

Where's the harm in one and not the other? Where's the exploitation in 
one and not the other? Where's the fantasy fulfillment in one and not 
the other (Alas, the Patriots, as history shows, are not exactly the 
stuff of dreams, are they)?

One gets the sloppy smooch and the other, a sanctimonious shudder.
Both are unabashed primers in meat-marketing, no more, no less.

"THE BAD HARVEST" by alex2051
Video on Hunger in Chiapas Now Available
   [prime anarchist note: I've met some CMP people
    they're way cool, fly and rad.]
A  17 minute video  documenting  hunger conditions in  indigenous 
communities in Chiapas is now available.   "The Bad Harvest" was 
partly shot and edited by youth from indigenous communities who 
are learning video skills through the  Chiapas Media Project.  
The video explains the reasons behind severe food shortages 
in Chiapas, with particular emphasis on the impact of the  
government's low intensity warfare. "The Bad Harvest" 
also traces the impact of near-famine conditions 
on community health. "The Bad Harvest" is 
available for $15 from 
Chiapas Media Project,
