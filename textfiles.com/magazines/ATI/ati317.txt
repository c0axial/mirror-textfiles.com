During one of the evening's most tense moments, 
a line of protesters carrying a fence made of 
chicken wire and PVC pipe advanced toward police 
lines at Bancroft Place and Connecticut Avenue NW 
about 8:30 p.m. Soon, they were face-to-face with 
D.C. police in riot gear, as observers holding up 
video cameras strained to capture the confrontation 
and the crowd chanted, "The whole world is watching."

Goodbye Roberta Blackgoat.
A memorial poem 
written by 
moon_grace
4/24/02 

I bow my head to the woman who would not be relocated and instead of
weaving cloth, at 84, she picked up pliers and unravelled fences.

I bow my head to the woman who would not be relocated and instead of
moving into town, at 84, she drove herself in an old pickup truck 33
miles one-way on unpaved roads for water, for phones, for gas, for
news of the world.

I bow my head to the woman who would not be relocated and instead of
telling stories and bemoaning what used to be, at 84, she took up pen
and paper and drew out petitions to stop what she thought was wrong
with the world around her.

I bow my head to the woman whose great-grandparents
taught her relocation of Fort Sumner, and at 84, she flung open her
doors when history came tapping on her window and she did not hide or falter.

She did not lock her door and pretend she was not home.
She dug in and worked for what she believed
And at 84, 
She kept these words...
"The Creator is the only one that will relocate me."

Goodnight, Roberta Blackgoat.

Schools For Sale
(Note: This originally started life as a persuasive speech in my speech
class at Itawamba Community College. However, the time alloted for each
student's speech made a longer, more detailed speech impossible. But at
the same time, I feel this is a subject worth talking about, and ATI is
the place to do it. For Deborah, Erica, Steve, Marilyn, Jimi, and
Phyllis...this is for you: the "director's cut" of my persuasive
speech.)

Today’s issue is NOT brought to you by Pepsi! We can say that, and make
a joke about it, but there are schools where this is not true.

Faced with shrinking budgets, many Public schools find they have to rely
on corporations for needed funding and materials. But often, companies
that partner with schools put profit over education. As a parent, I feel
that these kinds of relationships are inappropriate in a school setting.
Today, I’m going to tell you about school commercialism, and why it’s
bad for kids.

Perhaps no other name is more closely associated with school
commercialism than Channel One.  Channel One loans TV sets to schools
for an indefinite period, at least 3 years, and most of these schools
are in low-income districts

The show itself is approximately 14 minutes long, provided to grades
7-12. Billed as a way to ‘teach the news", there is very little actual
news, as much as 80% ‘fluff" (a journalistic term for stories that have
little relevance to the audience). In fact, some stories are actually
promotions of events. Super bowl 36 was the "lead story" in one
installment.

Channel One contains 2-4 minutes of commercials. Many advertisers create
ads to be shown only on Channel One. Corporations are charged millions
of dollars for each ad aired, and some companies create ads for the
exclusive use of Channel One. Most, if not all, of the ads shown are for
items that teens can live without, such as Skittles or Nike shoes.

The reason Channel One is so appealing to advertisers is the terms of
the contract Channel one has with participating schools. Under
contractual agreement, the schools must show the program during class
time. Channel One actually promotes this in its own sales literature as
a way to reach even the "lightest" TV viewer, that is, one who doesn’t
watch TV very much at home, therefore beyond an advertiser’s grasp.
However, the school time lost to advertisers can be as much as $300
million per year.

Of course, Channel One is not the only in-school advertiser. YNN, or
Youth News Network, is basically a Canadian version of Channel One, and
it has been under fire from its beginning. ZapMe!, a company that loans
computer equipment and internet access to schools, requires that
students spend at least four hours per day in computer labs, and the
ZapMe! operating system contain ads that cannot be turned off.

Other ways that companies pretend to help schools are what I like to
call Direct and Indirect sponsorships. Indirect sponsorships, for
example, are when companies have gimmick promotions to get people to buy
a company’s product in hopes they’ll help the schools (i.e. "box tops
for education"), as opposed to outright donations. In fact, some
companies use this to obtain demographic profiles of consumers in a
given area. What is not revealed, is that the cost of the prizes is
small in contrast to what is spent. For instance, under Campbell’s
Soup’s "Box Tops For Education" program, a school must save almost
100,000 Campbell’s soup labels in order to receive one iMac computer.
You don’t have to be a mathematical genius to see who’s the real winner
here, considering that a fully loaded iMac costs around $750. Other
incentives offered to winning schools include breakfast with the Trix
Bunny, for example.

Direct sponsorship is where companies like McDonalds and Pepsi pay
millions for the right to advertise on school grounds and equipment. In
some instances, companies like Pizza Hut serve their food in the
cafeteria on selected days. One school district in Colorado Springs
allows Coca-Cola to advertise and set up drink machines in the hallways
and even allow students to bring drinks to class.  However, it can be
carried too far, as proposals in Mississippi and Colorado to paint
school buses with sponsors’ logo in return for donations fail on safety
issues.

Yet, for all this ‘help’, there is a price to be paid, as the students
at the University of Oregon found out. Nike withdrew tens of millions of
dollars in contributions after the student body decided to support an
organization that held overseas garment factories accountable for worker
safety. What’s even more surprising is that Nike CEO Phil Knight is a
graduate of the University of Oregon, and co-founder Bill Bowerman is a
former UO coach. In Evans, Georgia, a student in Georgia got suspended
for wearing a Pepsi shirt on a day honoring school partner Coca- Cola.

A Flat
(To Langston Hughes)
By Jarrett Fulton
I hear evil whisper,
Memories lost, memories broken
Cover in beautiful women and big city slickers
Footsteps, echo with the streetlights that flicker
Wind blowing against my back
As car horns honk, A Flat
The ground that bleeds the loss of innocence
Life, rushes through the streets with Adrenaline
An old man asks me about living, and how I feel about that
I struggle with my answer while an insecure infant cries, A flat
I’m new to this game
Causing me to be offbeat
As an adolescent, and there’s something that I lack
The movement and the sounds of A flat

Sympathy
  a poem by Paul Laurence Dunbar (1872-1906)

I know what the caged bird feels. 
Ah me, when the sun is bright on the upland slopes, 
when the wind blows soft through the springing grass 
and the river floats like a sheet of glass, 
when the first bird sings and the first bud ops, 
and the faint perfume from its chalice steals. 
I know what the caged bird feels. 

I know why the caged bird beats his wing 
till its blood is red on the cruel bars, 
for he must fly back to his perch and cling 
when he fain would be on the bow aswing. 
And the blood still throbs in the old, old scars 
and they pulse again with a keener sting. 
I know why he beats his wing. 

I know why the caged bird sings. 
Ah, me, when its wings are bruised and its bosom sore. 
It beats its bars and would be free. 
It's not a carol of joy or glee, 
but a prayer that it sends from its heart's deep core, 
a plea that upward to heaven it flings. 
I know why the caged bird sings.

A BREATHING CARCASS
  poetry by Jarrett Fulton

Have you ever felt that you were at the bottom of the food chain?
Why did God give us nerves to feel so much pain?
Feeling those rigid jaws chewing,
Nibbling my precious, unstylish body
With claws that slash through my flesh
The only sound is my screaming
Becoming?
A breathing carcass
1/4 of myself is missing
As the Earth lies there and watches
The beast and I are silhouetted like two lovers in the murky shadows
I’m dying
But the pain does not cease
The beast devourers my body and all its wealth
And I chant... I chant death
Can you picture this torment?
My body paralyzed, my mouth glutted with blood
Only to cover my screams
My screams...



FATHER'S DAY
By Jarrett Fulton

9 Months:

They say we don’t spend time with our kids,
(But we put clothes on their backs)

They say we don’t nurture our seed,
(But we provide them a place to live at)

I hear songs of a "Motherless child"
An abandon regiment of a juvenile

And for what does a man gets,

For what is a Man Identity?
To tell his daughter not to lose her virginity
Daughters, yearning for a male’s affectation, desire a broken gift
Living out in the streets or follow into a boyfriend’s mischief

6 Months:
Picture a woman giving her 18-year-old son discipline
Punishing the young men with a belt or a hard-stricken instrument
Without men, the domicile holds bars, but no fear
Only an underrated parent can play it by ear

Answer questions on where and how
Where are we headed?
But I don’t understand; why do mother receive all the credit?

3 Months:

You ask us to be in the household
To cover our kids when temper or cold
Become the substitute, when a child’s mind is badly influence
Accuse us of adultery, but in the bedroom; what are you doing?
Someone told me that, women are being independent
But I hear songs; without men, there’s no reason for living
What do you need us for? To buy or fix your vibrator
So on June 19, we Fathers receive a hug, a card, and a
"I’ll see you later"
Men are tired of these underrated antics
See how our seeds grow, for without us, and take us for granted

Born:
It’s a boy

Ha, you want me now, huh
I’ll be back
I need a cold case of the beer?!

I dedicate the rest of my life 
to the name, 
and all that is called up 
when I say "Roberta Blackgoat."

And that is all I can say for now.
