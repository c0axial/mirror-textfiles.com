An Open Letter To Senator John
"War Hero" McCain.

You sir, having been a prisoner
of war at one time: you stand on
the side of genocide as regards
people of the americas??

Shame and eternal torment I wish
upon you in my moment of rage 
hearing of your correspondence.

Pray that I someday forgive. For
in a sucking swirling eddy of 
despair, you may need me someday.

I am sure to walk on by now.

Believing in more than a 
mere myth of democracy,
I am,

	April 22, 1999

The Honorable Janet Keno
Attorney General
U.S. Department of Justice
Constitution Avenue & 
10th Street, N.W.
Washington. D.C. 20530

The Honorable Bruce Babbitt
Secretary
U.S. Department of Interior
1849 C Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20240

Dear Attorney General Reno and 
Secretary Babbitt

I write to urge the Departments of 
Justice and Interior to proceed carefully 
in the coming months to settle the 
relocation of remaining Navajo families 
in a timely and orderly process. 
My paramount concern is to ensure the 
safety and wall-being of these Navajo 
families and the fair resolution 
to outstanding issues following the 
enactment of the Settlement Agreement 
for the Navajo and Hopi people.

I understand that the Office of Navajo 
and Hopi Indian Relocation sent 
90-day notices on January 25, 1999 
to the remaining Navajo families who 
have not signed the Accommodation 
Agreement. The end of this 90-day 
period is quickly approaching and 
I have not received any further notice 
that the remaining families have 
agreed to sign onto the Settlement Agreement 
or applied far relocation benefits. 
I ask that you submit in writing to 
me the actions that the Department of 
Justice will take in the coming months 
to ensure compliance with P.L. 104 3Q1.

Please keep my office apprised of further 
actions. Thank you for your immediate 
attention to this matter.
					       
Sincerely                                              
John McCain

Freedom of Suppression

Our nation's scribblers are acutely aware
Of things that could end a career,
So we don't see what we ought to see
Or hear what we need to hear.  

In Russia they locked real writers up,
And the stories would make you sick.
Here, there's such a weakness for carrots
There's's not much need for the stick.

Marc,
Thanks bud for the vote of confidence. 
It's kinda wierd but the more I found 
out about the FBI, the more I realized 
that it really was a bunch of 
societorial rejects. 
   Kinda sad if you ask me because, 
to the common person, the FBI, CIA, ATF 
etc all seem like very prestigeous 
organizations. 
   Oh well, just one more dream that will 
never be realized.

I'm swift learning that many 
members of the KLA are major
narcotics trafficers, and that
they might not have been if the
US CIA hadn't gone in a decade
ago and enticed them.

I don't forgive Milesovic, but
as I coin the phrase "bilateral
genocide" I begin to wonder if
it might not be mostly the US
department of justice' fault...

hello all
    Awhile back I remember seeing 
some mention of the School of the
Americas. I have the opportunity 
to discuss this "problem" with high
school students (in an Economics &
Democracy class I am in charge of), 
and plus a few other students 
(who like to discuss Indian issues 
of north and south America with me). 
Can anyone point me in a general 
direction for info on this 'school' 
that might be on the web, or any 
personal info would be even more 
appreciated. Some of the kids seem 
really enthusiastic to find out what 
the deal is, and I would like to provide
some more information, and help 
them investigate it on their own. 
Thanks very much.

Title: Antidrama
Author: Carlos Franklinovich

I need a little antidrama
I'm overstimulated
Take me somewhere where nothing's happening
And let me hear the trees blooming
Let me stick my head in a pool of honey
And sink to the bottom
Untouchable

I need a little antidrama
I am not a child
I don't want to see the accident victims
Let me respond with my own emotions
Don't tell me what to feel
I am not a wooden cow
Go away

Hey buddy,
I just this moment heard on npr or 
bbc, that Marty Sanches the owner 
of Casa Sanchez in San Francisco, 
a restaurant has tattooed about 
40 people with a mariachi that is the 
symbol for their lifelong ad for this 
company.
   In exchange for this, the person 
tattooed, gets lunch free for the 
rest of his or her life.
   What's up with that?

I wonder, do you feel this good?
an essay by SPV

I'm in Boulder Colo. with the flatirons
and I am in North Boulder walking south
with the mountains and flat rocks of
this shear mountains to my right and
a sun and blue sky, but it is sprinkling
and to the right storm clouds and a rainbow
and dark clouds and lightning and thunder.

I am subjected to this and I ponder the
ability I have to appreciate.  You see
you can only work things of the Heart for
the length of your attention span.  If
you can watch the second hand of a clock
and watch it move putting all your attention
on the second hand and when you hear your
self talk, that is a subtle sign you beginning
to sleep.  You will hear "Oh, this is easy"
or "I wonder if I am doing this right!"  This
is fear, insecurity already influencing you.

You see the peas in this, the twenty mattresses
and the pea, this fear, this insecurity will
fuel the mind into it's constant attack in
cutting everything down and begin negative.

So the amount you can appreciate is the length
of your attention span.  Or SIX SECONDS.  So
bill gates goes on vacation and he has this
beautiful appartment overlooking the sea and
all is peaceful and quiet and all he can
enjoy is six seconds, the fear and insecurity
cut in and he is worried about if he let the
cat out at home.

So for fifteen minutes I am appreciating the
sunset, the beautiful sunset that I was
gifted to view.  Choosen to view.  I love
it, and this morning I am driving my bike
down this hill full speed and pumping
for all get out and the cold air is kissing
my cheeks and I am alive, and I wonder, does
my millionaire brother feel this good?

Prime Anarchist Covers the Tri-Annual TechnoDemo
Contrary to popular belief, Seebold Bawstin  
featured strange companies and products Thurs 
at the tri-annual "Polywag Pre-press Party.
(PAWN) - AWSTIN, MASS. 
----http://newsandtech.com
Several shoestring companies showed off new 
versions of their old hats which are featured
below.
   Schnapple Computer LLC is still riding high
off the release of its GPS-3 system, showing
a report released by Bob, that 49 percent of 
the US population prefers either nuking Serbia,
bombing for 135 more days, or sending ground
troops over the other option of simply building
more bombs and sticking them all in the dirt.
   Kinko's, People Magazine, AAA, AOL, Fannie 
Mae, GTE, Nortel, along with Disney have all
opted to feature a brand new Schnapple jpg of
Pamela Anderson Lee's all new product called
"Boob Light," which tastes great and is less
filling. 
   Autologic Informational, International Inc.
featured it's AIEIAIO machine which milks cows,
eradicates crops, bombs Bosnia and designs
web pages. 
   Once trained using a pentium 80186 upgraded
to 43K compatibility the standalone AIEIAIO 
system will also talk to Furbys.
   Barquo Grafix introduced a new New Mooning
device that will once a month render enemy
forces with their pants down so that friendly
troops can win an easy war using devices such
as flyswatters and tickle-me-elmos rather than
the costly M16's or Barbie Dolls.
   Creole Products and Heidelberg FreePress of
Windsor, Conn., have donated computer-to-tin-
foil equipment so that anyone newly released
from Asylum Hospitals can get right on the net.
   Chairnet-Hairnet is the latest from Dusknet.
The system is an automated publishing solution
that connects applications, databases, shares
information, creates product, automates info
flow, supervises the automated publishing
environment, and holds an average sized coffee
mug next to your arm, while it also can set 
your brand new hairstyle.
   Insie,outie inc., released version 3.01
of Dynawontchablo, the company's XML- (extra
medium large) based websurfing device which
features new features, old features and some
other features that can't be featured in a 
family feature-story here.
   Squeem introduced a few new products at
the show. Color Genioux 1.11101 scans and  
processes images just like the HP Bell 
helicopter, Harlekin RIP is a beer, a car
and a microprocessor that translates Polish
documents into Portugese, and finally Squeem
released Duck 6.22 which is great for 
rollercoasters, hayrides and parades giving 
off a bright red blood-like substance 
making any face famous, "even Fabio's" said
Dirk Derk of Duck/Squeem, Inc. 
   Squeem didn't say anything about Goose 4.1
which will be used in non-ethnic Serbia to drop 
brown, grey, green and black gobbledygooks all 
over windshields and streetwalkers from above
14,000 feet.
   SoilInk has launched its new website at
http://www.soyink.com 
The site features info and updates. It also
features new information and updated pages.

The Unsettling Internet
A pome, by DC Dave.

"The unreliable Internet,"
Please spare me that tedium.
By nature it's more credible
Than any other medium.

In spite of everything
That online agents do,
The plain, unvarnished truth
Invariably gets through.

Which is more than you can say
For what prevailed before.
So the Net upsets the "mainstream"?
Let's go upset them more.
