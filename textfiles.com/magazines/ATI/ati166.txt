Please mention in your communications that 
if at all possible, people going out 
should be self contained and able to 
take care of themselves. Many middle class 
anglo have never experienced poverty and 
don't realize that having to provide the 
food and cook it for outsiders puts a burden 
on these people. Some cannot chop wood, have 
never seen a sheep up close and have never 
been in a garden or dryland field. We have to 
remember that the only way outsiders presence 
there is if they can be of actual assistance. 
If they go out simply as witnesses (with 
camera, audio recorders and video maybe it
could be suggested that they camp seperately 
in a group or in some manner that the elders 
don't have to take care of all of their 
survival needs.

Thanks!  ATI is great!  But reviewing 
your singing endorsement list has got
me thinking--You list REM's "Superman" 
with IBM...  REM covered The Clique's
Superman, so...  it's probably the same 
ad--the guy whose post I forwarded
seemed very specific about Lotus, so 
maybe IBM is wrong?  Maybe there's TWO
ads?  And is the music The Clique's 
version (doubtful), REM's (much more
likely) or a cheesy remake of that???  
Thought I'd better write back; I hate
to be involved in disseminating 
misinformation, unless it's on purpose!

A FONE COMPANY THAT NO ONE HATES???
By Betty Beard
Proudly Reprinted From:
The Arizona Republic
Feb. 7, 1999

Nearly a dozen years ago, Emmett White would 
drive about seven miles across the Gila River 
Indian Reservation's desert to a Casa Blanca 
store to make a phone call.
   The Gila River resident couldn't afford to 
pay US West for a phone in his rural home.
   "It was going to cost me $30,000," 
White said.
   The lack of phones was more than an 
inconvenience. During floods, residents
became isolated because they were unable 
to cross the Gila River to get from
one side of the reservation to the other, 
tribal Councilman Harry Cruye said.
   But with persistence and a federal loan, 
the Gila River Community 11 years ago formed 
its own phone company, Gila River 
Telecommunications Inc., which today offers a 
$12-a-month phone service, cellular phones,
business phone systems, pagers, satellite TV 
and Internet connections. Today, the company
serves about 1,400 Gila River families.
   "That's a big jump, considering most 
people didn't have phones 10 years ago.
We're bringing the 21st century into people's 
homes," said Belinda Nelson, the company's 
director of human resources.
   Today, the company stands out for being 
able to better serve its spread-out Native 
American market than competitors and for 
offering advanced features in a community 
in which half the residents still don't 
have phones.
   The Gila River Community was one of 
the first Indian nations in the state to
approach US West about buying out its system, 
said Jim Roof, a US West spokesman. 
The original system included a 1950s-vintage 
switching system.
   The community formed Gila River 
Telecommunications Inc., or GRTI, in 1988.
Two years later, it received a $12.4 million 
Rural Electrification Administration loan to 
replace US West's old system with 
state-of-the-art equipment that today includes 
digital switches and 117 miles of fiber-optic
cables.
   US West had no objections to leaving the 
isolated rural market in some areas, Roof said.
   "There are areas, especially in the West, 
where a company specifically focused on small 
communities has some significant advantages 
that US West can't enjoy," he said.
   In late 1997, the Gila River Community 
bought out the other owner of Gila River 
Telecommunications, National Telecom Cos. Inc. 
of Oklahoma City, and became the sole owner.
   As a company run by and for Native Americans, 
the company can customize its services to what 
the 620-square-mile reservation needs.
   "We are profitable, but because we're owned 
by the community, profits are not as important 
as serving the community well," said Brooks 
Roseman, general manager of GRTI.
   It recently gave the community its first 
comprehensive phone book with maps of the 
reservation. Maps have not been readily 
available before.
   The company also installed advanced pay 
telephones, and residents have to pay only 
25 cents to call anyone on the reservation, 
with no time limit.   
   Along with serving the rural residents, 
the telephone system at the Lone Butte 
industrial park near south Chandler, 
which has 43 businesses, is nearing 
capacity.
   The company uses a Chandler address, 
7065 W. Allison Drive, while other homes
or businesses have Florence, Coolidge or 
Florence addresses.
  There are street names, but sometimes 
no street numbers.
   Roseman said the company will probably 
have to get really state-of-the-art and use 
satellite-based global positioning systems 
instead of addresses to identify 911 callers.
   Ironically, the big telephone company, 
US West, which once decided it would be too 
expensive to serve such a wide-spread community, 
could someday find itself competing with this 
young company in other communities.
   Customers who live outside the community 
have already begun calling to see whether 
they can become a customer. Roseman said 
that although the company could someday 
allow that, for now it won't.
   "We'd like to serve the population of 
the reservation first and do that well," 
he said.

DADDY'S GOT A BRAND NEW GAME
(PAWN) - Tulsa, OK. 
Not happy with doing a Bob Dylan song better
than Bob Dylan, a Willie Nelson movie better
than Willie, and having more lucrative sweat
glands than Clint Black, Garth Brooks has
announced he would like to go to training camp
this summer. He's hoping an Earth First!?! team
might pick him up so he can play semi-pro
activism. At the upcoming Round River Rendezvous,
(undisclosed location of course) he will train on
wearing a bicycle lock around his neck, climbing
mountains, sitting on tripods, eating vegetarian
foods - also free ranging organic meats, all 
things he claims he was good at around the cattle
ranch as a little boy. 
   Brooks said he was disappointed when informed
he will not train on spiking trees, as that is not
an Earth First!?! sanctioned event. 
   "Come to find out," said Pablo Tadpole, speaking
for EF!?! "Spiking doesn't get taught there at all!
One would have to go to US Forest Ranger training
camp in the winter." Tadpole is Garth's new errant
EF!?! name by the way. He will get it officially 
after summer training in a ceremony involving 
bumble bees, rose bushes and Johnny Cash music. 
   "I think I will take Forest Ranger training
either after baseball or EF!?!.
What I've always wanted to do since I was knee
high to a grasshopper poop was spike a tree." 


HIDE: CLINTON A HIPPY.
(PAWN) WASHING.
   "That BillyBoy," Said S. Henry Hide after
beating the pants off him on the raquetball
court. "He's one tough sparring partner."
Hide said he's a real free spirit kissing all
the girls and making almost none of them cry.
S. Henry Hide hinted at free love and hippydom
for the next millenium.
   "Ladies, when he promises you a rose garden,"
said S Henry, or S Hank, but he prefers to not
be called Henry. "You'd better watch out. You
WILL get it. Trouble is you'll have to share him
with his harem.
   This was Hide's first speech in months where
he felt he wasn't restricted by the rule of law.
   "I think I'll grow my hair long like Johnson
did after the war," said S Hide, removing his
tie, he unbuttoned his shirt to his navel
putting both thumbs up quoting Arthur Fonzarelli
and showing off his gold Aquarius medallion.
   "Just call me Shank," he said.
