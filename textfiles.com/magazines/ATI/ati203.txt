I FOUND THE FOUR HORSEMEN
 by Prime Anarchist

Pat Robertson in his peroxide beard and lily white
toupe atop his head.
   Who are the three middle-aged white men he sits
with ramming their fear-oriented cult mind manipulation
down viewers hoary eyeballs? Kenneth Copeland, or should
I leave all names out? Nah! 
   Wait, that's NOT Pat Robertson, or is it? Let's not
libel the guy, eh? 
   I change the channel and TNT's repeating Bill Murray
playing ole Rev. Stockton Thompson in "Where the Buffalo
Roam," Ah, memories.
   So much for my self-imposed twenty minute limit of TV
for the whole day. Hard to hold to, peeps. This is what
happens to me when CNN, MTV, and VH1 (are there ANY networks
that AREN'T trying so diligently to grow into a three-letter-
agency???) are disseminating lies, propaganda or bad ads.
   Or all three, perhaps. 
   How much do I loathe Jim Palmer's Money Store? Let me
count the ways. Take it back to pre-Phil Ruzzuto, huh? Is
there EVER gonna be a "fast forward" for "live" TV ads?
Until then I surf once around everytime Hunter's show breaks.
   Gross Pointe Blank. John Cusack. Minnie Driver. Wow. Did
I miss another good one? Should I have gone to the big screen
yet another time? Oh well. It's just as profound in my little
box I guess. 
   "Riot cops kill protesters, that's indiscriminate; I don't
do that," Cusack tells Driver while bottoming out.
   Hi, I'm Prime and you're not. This is ATI issue 203. 
The moon is somewhere between half and full. Ask your coyote, 
I just don't know, and I'm NOT going to grab a newspaper
just to find out.
   They caught a guy with two jars of nitro and 100 lbs of urine
in his car. Hey, you'd piss yourself too if while holding something 
so volatile you had to have someone official-looking point a 
rocketlauncher at your family jewels and scream "Drop 'em!" 
   But seriously, folk. First I heard o' this a couple hours ago,
one of the "legit" [cough, laugh, giggle, squirm, cough] press
told us it was 200 pounds of nitro, a trunk full or urea, and he was
Lebanese... flip chans -- you hear "nitro and urea and there may be
plutonium..." grab a shortwave, and you find out he's Liberian, and
not Lebanese. If this follows other bombings [& attempts] in the US 
except the UN the last two decades, then within a week we'll find 
out he was some blonde guy from Montana who went to way too much church, 
read way too much Spotlight magazine, listened to way too much Rush 
Limberger, and had way too much time on his hands. Oh and he heard
voices that Clinton was the antichrist and must be stopped by blowing 
up the world.
   Two rockets are trying to launch the past week and a half. There's
been delays. One's a Shuttle, looks like a pregnant Tonka truck, and
the other, well. How DO you describe it? It's either a goofy looking
penis or a snake that ate a rat the size of Laramie, Wyoming. Anyhow
it seems like the monkee god keeps dropping cocanuts on the NASA guys'
heads, because they just can't get 'em up.
   Oh well, their problem, I'm sure they'll work it out. Call Pfizer.
   There was a man who entered a local paper's pun contest. He sent in
ten different puns, in the hopes that at least one of the puns would
win. Unfortunately, no pun in ten did.
   NYC had a full week without a single classical guitar performance.
At least not ones that are "big enough" or "PC" enough to be added in
the New York Slimes.
   I got a letter to the editor published in Gear Magazine this month.
Should I reprint it here? Nah, maybe next month. Get it at a newsstand.
Help out Mr. Bob. (you know, the Guccione guy)
   A journalist WITHOUT a Kachina 
     Is like a paragraph
       Without context.
Not quite a haiku, but there you have it.

Prime Outa...

Julia 'Butterfly' Hill will leave her perch in a

Marco,
Thanks for the visit and the comments.
  Went to your Webpage -- I appreciate all you're doing.  
I'm going to list you among our links

  I first met Martin Sheen (& Fr. Bill O'Donnell) at a small mass 
at the Concord Naval Weapons Station where Brian Willson was run 
over by the munitions train (my folks were there protesting at the 
time.)
  Your article page (very nicely formatted, by the way) features 
Martin.  In that picture, to the right, are Fr. Bill & Dr. Davida 
Cody, a specialist in third-world pediatric medicine and a mutual 
friend of the two.
  Keep up the fine work!
  Peace,

Usenet, usenet usenet.
Some Glossarywork for any new or NITN people. (not in the know...)

1. Technical background

     What is alt?
     Contrary to popular belief, "alt" is not named because it is for 
"alternative" topics. Back during the dawn of the modern Usenet, it 
was decided that newsgroups should be created by following a clearly 
defined set of "Guidelines", involving formal discussions and a voting 
procedure. There was a significant number of people who felt that there
should be a provision for a place where people could create groups 
without having to go through any discussion or votes. 
     Thus alt was born. It is a hierarchy that is "alternative" to the 
"mainstream" (comp,misc,news, rec,soc,sci,talk) hierarchy. 
     "ALT stands for 'Anarchists, Lunatics, and Terrorists'." - 
ziegast@uunet.uu.net (Eric Ziegast)

[ed note: there are some very phunny combos out there in the alt section
 of usenet as I'm sure you can imagine. Each weak I'll mention a couple,
 talvez. But first I must share with you the all-time most peculiar match
 for "usenet alt," alt.military.police - at least in my onion. Either
 way, I'd like to say to the MP's and assorted other freeks who hang out
 in there, welcome a board. Oh, and if anyone out there is planning on
 frequencying their grumble abode, you might keep in mind one of their
 only self-implozed stifulations: mainstream discussion is to be limited
 to Tuesdays, whereas wacked out contributions, whatever they may be can
 be shared the other 6 each week.]

I would say that is a quite obvious connection.
An interesting sideline: the Republican Convention is slated for
Philadelphia next summer and the Philly police sent observers to Seattle
to learn "crowd control" tips. I also heard that "they" are closely
watching an anarchist bookstore in Philly because it is the source of
"pamphlets" concerning the Republ Convention. So, repression/police
state tactics are already being cranked up for the crime of "pamphlets".

THE LAND
  by Delores Skenador
  2nd grade

The land is ours,
We need it back.
If you don't give it back,
My people will get it back.
I like you if you give me back my land.
My land has a wonder name,
It is called The Indians Land.
If you like my land name,
I like it.
The End.

   reprinted from Kalihwisaks Weekly. 2dec99

[commentary in the form of an OPEN LETTER TO ANGLO AMERICA]
 We are going to lose our land to indio america
 We are eventually going to lose our land.
 Almost every law written in the last
 Twenty years reflects that we -
 Are going to lose our land to indio america.
 To be honest with you I would rather rent or mortgage
 From a tribe than the Uncle Sham anyhow,
 As we'll see the police state disappear,
 Usury dry up, and I know deep down in my heart that
 These variances and enviro-impact-statements can all
 Go straight to hell where they obviously came from
 Because we are eventually going to 
 Lose our land to indio america.
 Your attempts to kill it off 23 different ways have all failed,
 And to be sure, in some ways have made your future plight 
 All the worse for it -  We are going to lose our land.
 Generation X has been trying to warn you for all these years.
 You never listen to your children, do you?
 Prepare yourself the way, or suffer your own wrath.
 For Someday fast approaches.
 Had you used it as a steward should,
 Indio america would surely have been yours for the
 Asking, forever, and a day. Free. Respectful. 
 But you're using it wrong!
 You're losing it, anglo america.
 I honor the ride.
