So did anyone do any good deeds today?
Just curious. Happy Valentines Day.
  No Jeffrey Dahmer column today. Hasn't been one
in a week or three, huh? It's just been too cold
to jog there really. And, I'm not gonna just drive
there, ok?
  So it's 2342 pm Saturday, 15feb03. My late father's
birthday. I think about that once in a while. Well,
once a year or so. Miss ya, guy. You know what was 
really weird about having a best friend for a dad?
The difficulty after he dies is every time you're
perplexed, pissed off, hurt or scared, you wanna go
to him and ask his advice. Not anymore. He is no
longer in this world.
  Every time you do something phenomenal you wanna
rush home at like 2 or 3am and wake him up from sleeping
in front of world wide wrestling federation or Night
Flight, and brag, "hey dad, check it out, you ready?"
Nope, gonzo. He's not there anymore. Kinda depressing
until I realize I had 20 really good years with the
old guy. 20 great years that many little boys and girls
never get in this western society we call a life. 20 
awesome years I shoulda taken for value-value instead 
of a little for granted.
  Run a homeless shelter for a year or two, you'll know
what I'm talking about. I had a dad for 20 good years.
I can't begrudge the next 19 without him, can I? He
was there, he was present, and he was "presente." Very
very there. That was my dad. Always there. Gonna miss
ya dad, for another great year. Happy birthday!

May I never forget you. I guess I'll allow others to
remember you too.

Have you ever heard this song?

Whoa, ennit???

The Bell
By Stephan Smith

Oh where are you going?, 
   said the man at his desk
I'm going to a new world, 
   said the child and he stood
And he stood, and he stood, and 
   'twere well that he stood
I'm going to a new world, 
   said the child and he stood 

Oh I'm sounding drums of war,
   said the man at his desk 
Oh, I will not fight your war,
   said the child and he stood 
And he stood, and he stood, and 
   'twere well that he stood 
I will not fight your war,
   said the child and he stood 

Oh, but don't you love your country?,
   said the man at his desk 
Yes, I do but you don't,
   said the child and he stood 
And he stood, and he stood, and 
   'twere well that he stood 
I do but you don't,
   said the child and he stood 

Oh, but do you know the truth?,
   said the man at his desk 
Yes, you lie and call it truth,
   said the child and he stood 
And he stood, and he stood, and 
   'twere well that he stood 
You lie and call it truth,
   said the child and he stood 

Oh, you must be scared to die,
   said the man at his desk 
No, I'm prepared and your scared,
   said the child and he stood 
And he stood, and he stood, and 
   'twere well that he stood 
I'm prepared and your scared
   said the child and he stood 

Oh, I think I hear a bell
   said the man at his desk 
Yes, it's ringing you to hell,
   said the child and he stood 
And he stood, and he stood, and 
   'twere well that he stood 
Yes, it's ringing you to hell,
   said the child and he stood

Well I was so impacted and affected/effected
by it, that I went ahead and devoted my first
ogg vorbis production to it.

I mean it's not the first ogg I've made available,
I converted many wavs and mp3s to ogg the past
couple nights in response to the RIAA's cocky 
boasting that their new mp4 is going to make
mp3s obsolete. But this is the first recording
I've made where I just completed it as an .ogg
rather than mp3 or realaudio. What a fun exercise
too. 

CAVEAT: I did this a capella in 4 voices and I
was all over the place in parts. It sounds kind
of horrid one moment and really great in another.
Go with it. There'll be a better version of this
song sometime in the future, but for now, enjoy
this and check out the different compressions and
stuff. You want my opinion this was an excellent
exercise.

If you goto: 
http://flag.blackened.net/ati/oggs/opm I think 
you'll hear lo, mid and high fidelity recordings
so you can check out and compare the compressions
involved. I think after I've spent a couple/few
days hyping it as an "exclusive" of sorts, I might
go ahead and make an .rm and an .mp3 so you can
compare that equally as well.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE LARGEST "DUH" OF THE MILLENIUM:

The WhiteHouse has just switched from LotusNotes for their
email to Microsoft Outlook. 

Um. Should I even begin to explain this? I don't really
have to, do I? Are these billionaires dumb? Masochistic?
They're claiming their email slowed to a crawl yesterday
and that it took until this morning to get it really 
working full-on again. And they really are having a 
glitch or two here and there that can't be easily
explained.

DUH!

Outlook???

Double Duh!!!

The LA Times had a great story about this in today's 
papes. Look for "sluggish" "causing" "delays" and I
think you'll find the URL.

"...several West Wing staffers, speaking on condition 
of [their usual] anonymity, offered another theory:
that the slowdown could be traced to the system's 
'firewall,' which is designed to protect it from 
hackers by filtering out unwanted incoming missives."

Yeah, right. I really hate to say "you get what you
ask for," but I'll extra-hate saying pretty soon, 
"told ya so."

I know they're trying to tell the world "we're secure,"
etc. but what they're really saying is "try us." And
especially to announce they're using Outlook??? Outlook?!? 
Can you say "virtually unpatchable?"

What's next, telling us every single national secret is
sitting in Norad safe and secure inside gigantic Windows
NT boxen.

Oh, that was the 90's huh?

[last note -- 
I wonder if this wasn't some kind of a sting...]



====================================================

HERE'S AN OPEN SOURCE MOVIE SCRIPT.
Anyone Wanna Run With It? I'll Help.

A movie called "Eugene's Law"

Very John Waynish. I'm playing Hassenfus in this movie.
My plane crashes over enemy territories and of course a
stereotypical beautiful young Jane Fonda-like girl saves 
my life. She asks me about the two different anthropene 
injection containers I carry and I explain that I'm not 
only special forces, delta force and dyncorp but many 
other groups I can't tell anyone about. One injection 
is to save my life from things and the other is to kill 
myself which I was supposed to do AFTER destroying the 
plane.

 I failed both.

Long drawn out drama about failing my mission.

I explain that the plane had two remote controls, one 
for me to destroy it, and another for the gov't to do 
it in if I fail. Which I'm sure will happen soon.

I explain how I'm instructed to  kill myself with the 
tube if needed and she also discovers how they can do 
ME in remotely too if need be, but she ends up figuring 
out how to disable it. She attempts to do this but fails 
after a lot of both of us trying because from all the 
melodramatic leading man, leading lady stuff I now have 
a new desire to live and etc. But alas it's too late, I 
blow up on a beach and she mourns what appears to be my 
death.

She spends most of the rest of her life getting Feingold 
to try and pass the Eugene Hassenfus bill, which will make 
government unwindand roll back, with formal apologies, 
every last detail of denyability and counter-counter in 
stages acceptable to the gov't until some far off day when 
the US gov't operates 100% transparent and human rights 
oriented again like "old times."

Every secret all the way back to 1979, 1948, even 1772 
must be publicly admitted and apologized for, eventually.

The law's wording comes right out of the dialogue in this 
"movie within a movie" that any government worth its salt 
must be truthful and open if it's going to warrant a fight 
as seemingly valient as all my gadgets and rhetoric would 
bring on.

Anyhew, "Jane" and Feingold are working on this bill using 
my movie to propagandize for its passage when all of a sudden 
I reappear, but only the movie viewers know this so far. 
Turns out my work with Taliban as a double agent is really 
as a triple agent and even though Bin Laden doesn't know it, 
Hussein, Dennis Hastert, Thommy Thompson and Walt Disney 
stealthily kidnapped me and killed off a bonified clone of 
me in front of Jane and tucked me away for safe keeping in 
case the bill doesn't seem to be about to pass. At which 
time they might need me to go in and testify. Even Feingold 
wasn't allowed to know, although hewas contacted a few 
times and told to never worry that the bill WILL pass and 
give him his legacy because they have plans B through Z 
and he'll know about them when the time comes.

Then of course I wake up writing this down on notepad as 
quickly as I can. I'm just now typing it in.

Don't poke too much fun of any inconsistancies in here. I 
still have to read it over and make changes before it'll 
become an essay or maybe even a one act play or something.
