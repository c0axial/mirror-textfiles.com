Our humble little farmstead is well-prepared 
with various armaments to fend off attacks by 
nefarious malefactors and lackeys of a government 
that no longer is of, by, and for the people. Our
master-at-arms has determined, though, that if 
required to use the phosgene gas, we absolutely 
require protective equipment. Rubber impregnated 
bodywear and 1970's era or later milspec gas masks 
are sought. As typical, any benefactor receives
several jars of Sarah's yummy home-canned green 
beans!! 
Thanks.

EDUCATE ME
   a poem by Woodie Guthrie

I never sung or made one ballad
Song to entertain you.
I made all my stuff up to
Tell you and to
Educate you.
I'm an educator
Not any entertainer.

confessions of a lonley gentrifier
      a poem by Shayna Plaut

i mean
its not that i don't like taquitos
and let me tell you
lenny kravitz
has always served
as an inspiration
in multicultural literature
its just
emersion is such a
shocking way
to breed familiarity and comfort
grows slowly.

i just don't know quite how to
eat buffulo wings
unless they're served with
paul newmans zesty blue cheese.

ok there are times where i feel
like the "me" in that holocost poem
written by that preacher, " but i wasn't
(blank) so i didn't speak up."
but its on both sides -
i like my double mochas
in the morning with an everything
bagel and too much creamcheese
and i'm sorrythe dominican
liquor store closed down
(they always had my brand of smokes)
but weren't they running drugs out the back
(i think?)

damnit - keep remembering that line -
"everything after but is bullshit"

but i don't know how
to say hello in unbroken spanish
and i don't know how
to sayy "wassup" with a straight face
and this "homes" "vato" "bro" and "sistA"
it's...

DAMNIT i bet they wouldn't even know how to analyze Cesaire's poetry
and that's they're own people.
and how are you supposed to sleep
to the rattling stereo's cranky stutter
of salsa influenced POKAs?

i don't know.
i guess that's the honest answer
overmysourcream saturated guacamole
with navajo grown blue corn tortilla chips
and my virgen de guadelupe
glitter baby tee.

i don't know.
what my last name means
where my great grandparents immigrated from (ireland?)
or how they taught us to live.

i don't need to ALWAYS remember
that cell phones aren't hugs
that momma's late nights at the office
were her late nights away from
a lonley bed.
that my computer doesn't hold me.

Debating Foucault is much more palatable
than solving anonimity -
it keeps the conversation going
without listening to the pauses that are needed to feel.

(sung to fish heads)

rat race
rat race
everyone in a rat
race
rat race
rat race
whats the goal?
none.

MICROSIFT OFFERS $7B LINUX BUYOUT.
(PAWN) REDMOUND, Wash - Microsift offered to buy
Linux for 6.22 billion dollars friday, sending the
trading world into a tizzy.
   "It was the right thing to do," said William P.
Gate, spokeperson for Microsift, Inc.
   Apparently the people at Linux were not amused.
How can you buy something that's supposed to be free
forever, is the sentiment all around their headquarters.
We got the exclusive, and here's some of the results.
   "Not only no, but hells no!" said Richard "Penguin"
Redhat. "I wanted to say 'fuck you,' but that might have
been sending the wrong message to the public.
   The people at Microsift could not be reached a second
time for comment.

...and in shorter newz...

George C Brill has whispered loudly that...
...the pentagon was allowed to choose some of the clothes
that John Travolta wore in Broken Arrow so that the military
would be portrayed positively. As part of the exchange, movie 
producers gained access to expert assistance and expensive
equipment.
...some web search engines, such as Excite and Lycos
point users to their advertisers' websites, rather than
to those that might be most useful.
...a Time magazine article on Flo-Sun Inc., one of the
country's largest sugar growers, was flawed, but the 
authors nonetheless won a coveted journalism award.
...an ad exec digitally altered an Elle magazine cover
photo to include an advertiser's product, which had 
never been worn by the cover model.
...Producers at TV networks hire composers to write
theme music for big news events - so we'll stay tuned
to their network longer.
...Fox News investigative show Fox Files used a young
producer posing as a 13-year-old girl to expose Internet
pedophiles - but also participated in the arrest and
prosecution, perhaps overstepping the bounds of journalism.


TRUCKSTOP PAYPHONES
  a phound poem by Prime Anarchist


             Free pass
You must vote
Men must choose
How are you voting?
Tuit - Cut out and save.
QUIT SMOKING
This pass won't get you to heaven, but 
Where will you spend eternity?
There IS a way that is free 
For just 7 days.
             Guaranteed.
I vote for Hell
I vote for Heaven
After death you face Smoke-Away.
Satisfaction guaranteed.
At long last we have them!
And in sufficient quantity so that you can 
Have this for your very own.
Please cut yours out and save it.
And God shall wipe away all tears from their
             Eyes.
Kick the nicotine habit naturally
Without more nicotine!
Smoke-Away's Formula contains ingredients:
Hyssop to clean the temples
Burdock root to bind you hand and foot.
Goldenseal for adding your name.
And 
             Kelp.
Draw yourself a little phish symbol.
COMING SOON TO A TRUCKSTOP NEAR YOU.
The Round Tuit.
Cut it out.
Cut it out!
Cut it out!!!



We end with a poem by George Samson

It's called LUNCHEON DUETS OR SOLILOQUIES (WAITER)

The waiter brings the check,
Numbers I understand,
Know what to do.

In the kitchen, a cook
Is stirring with a large spoon
Something unseen.

Around, pizzas served
On a platform of nickel;
Apple pie on white unadorned dishes.

I keep concentrating on what has no meaning for my life,
For she, who does have meaning,
Never acted friendly during  her consumption of spaghetti.
