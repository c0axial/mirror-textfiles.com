Greeeeeeetings and saaaaaalivations.
  I just finished watching "Secret of My Succe$s" and "Back 
To The Future;" I'm not proud, I'll admit it: and all I could 
think of was blue cheese dressing. Yes, blue cheese dressing. 
The chunky stuff. Ooey gooey chunks. Slippery slimy chunks. 
No idea what I'm babbling about? Read on.
  When my mom sees MJ Fox she sees what I could have been.
Basically all she'd hoped for me. My late dad used to see in
him drug addiction I guess, and a chip on his shoulder or 
some such. I just remember him always calling him "a hophead
just like those Beatles boys." Don't worry, he didn't care
much for the Rolling Stones either. I look at him however,
I see what I once was for a very brief time. I look back 
with shudders, moans, grunts, and sighs of relief as if 
I'd just squeaked past it all within hairs of my life.
  Yuck. The "me generation." I blame Michael J Fox, but I
ultimately blame   _his_   hero, Ronald Wilson Reagan. You 
can have it now on no money down. Buy it now, pay later, or 
never, or whatever, who cares, let someone else pay.
  What does Michael J. Fox represent to you? That's all I'm
asking. That's as far as I'm going to go with this too, because 
I refuse to kick someone on their way down the Great Wheel. 
He's getting 1.3 trillion come-uppances, and that's his trip. 
I just watch it all going down from the sidelines. And that's 
all I can say for now.
  Anarchy cologne. Unisex. Get it at Gadzooks! Wait. Do you 
even know what a Gadzooks is??? Hip store. Stickers, phat
pants, sparkley shirts and half shirts. If you live on either 
coast you may be more familiar with the Hot Topic stores chain. 
Bingo, it's a lot like that. Cheap clothing and accessories, 
mass produced, sold at high prices abusing teens, young hipsters 
and the parents of teens and young hipsters.
  Have I summed it up right? I sampled some Anarchy yesterday.
What, you thought I was going to buy some? Well, at 15$ for a
2 oz red, white and black bottle with an easily "carved" /A/
symbol it's a pretty low price, but not for something that's
not even worth 99 cents! You want my honest opinion? What do I
look like, a perfume reviewer? A fashion critique??? OK, here 
goes. It's a cross between that yellow and white box of bootleg
Giorgio and a huge bottle of that hideous spray stuff you buy 
in an Avon catalog. That's not anarchy, my friend, that's a 
trip to grammaw's house. Looking back if I had to say someone
who smelled exactly like Anarchy Unisex cologne I can say there's
a teacher I had in 3rd or 4th grade, wait, I was never her student.
I just passed her classroom in the hall sometimes. Don't remember
her name, but I sure do remember baby powder and something else.
Like something burning or something.
  You walk wide but still you smell it. It attacks your throat
like a bee-sting as you cough all the way to your class, sitting
as close to the window as you can get. You regroup your breathing
abilities and your senses. The aftertaste is a cross between 
SkinSoSoft and that DDT can your mom used to keep under the sink
back in the late 60's.
  That's it. If you've never sampled Anarchy cologne, just reread
my column here. You've experienced as much as you need to.
  Trust me.
  Now I looked for them on the net and I found an anarchy cologne
for women alright. From about 10 years ago. It's still popular I 
guess. And durned expensive. Like $58 bucks or something if I 
remember right. But it's NOT THE SAME sniff. Perhaps these two
"corps" don't know anything about each other. I can almost see 
a really neat lawsuit ensuing between the two. "We coined that 
phrase first," "no we did..." "We own the rights," "no we do."
  It's manufactured by some company called Rega International and
I'm told they're in Illinois. But I'm having equal troubles finding
them. No web presence in this day and age? Hmm. Odd. No, not odd
that they have no presence. Odd that they have no presence AND
they're commanding a niche in the import/export business.
Whaddya think. Maybe THAT's where the 1.3 billion to Colombia 
went??? 
  Oh well, won't be the last time we wasted necessary GNP on 
something that smells, eh?
  Michael J. Fox. Blue Cheese chunky stuff. 
  Heroin Chic: the end results. 
  Get it. Got it? Good.

PRESS RELEASE

CA Prison Walk From February 1 -- March 4, 2001, there will be 
an interfaith pilgrimage visiting about 22 prisons in California 
to bring out the many issues related to prison injustices in the 
United States.
  This will be a good opportunity to bring out the many related 
issues such as drug war injustices/corruptions, the death penalty, 
racial disparities in the US "justice" system, Prop215 interference 
by the Feds, etc.
  This walk is being initiated/conducted by a Buddhist nun of the 
Nipponzan Myohoji order which has conducted many prayer walks over 
the past decades in America and around the world.
  The local press on these walks typically offers good coverage of 
them in part due to the "colorful" nature of the event which includes 
the drumming and chanting of their traditional prayer for truthful 
understanding. Depending on the size of local participation en route 
the media coverage could expand to regional and national levels.
  Projections as of now for number of long distance walkers 
(15-17mi/day, total 500mi over a much longer route from Oakland to 
Fresno to Tehachapi to San Bernardino to Los Angeles to Santa Barbara 
ending at Lompoc prison) is a modest 10-15 walkers who will need 
overnight accomodations along the way.
  This walk has the potential to catalyze large events at locales 
along the route depending on how well local organizers/coordinators 
take advantage of this opportunity to participate locally and 
organize events along the way so that local speakers can bring 
out their various prison issue related messages to the participants 
and the public via media coverage along the way.
  Big or small, this walk will take place on schedule and whatever 
"snowball effect" this announcement may have on the eventual size 
and impact of this walk will depend on what the reader does with 
this information in the coming days and weeks.
  Please forward this brief overview message to your networks for 
review of details at the walk website
http://www.stormpages.com/geronimo33/caprisonwalk.html and ask those
interested in helping to organize/coordinate local events along this 
walk route, join a part of the route along the way, provide hospitality, 
etc.

     We end this millenium with a poem reprint.
               You Who Are New

     by Sondra Ball

               You who are new here,
               who name your ancestors
               through ships that sailed from Ireland
               or from Italy;
               who trace your ties with this land
               through a mere two or three centuries;
               how can you possibly understand
               the hold a thousand generations
               have upon me?
               Twenty thousand years ago,
               the blood of my grandmothers
               splashed on the ground of birthing lodges
               on this continent.
               Twenty thousand years ago,
               the bodies of my grandfathers
               crumbled into soil
               on this continent.
               It is not history that holds me here,
               or tradition,
               or wanderlust.
               It is blood-
               the blood of a thousand generations
               running through soil,
               and through time,
               into my veins
