Hello there,
Whereas, whereas, whereas & whereas, Be it hereby
resolved, that I, Prime Anarchist, this week of
Full Moon, September, 1998, turn over my weekly 
column to Subcomdante Insurgente Marcos:

<><><><><><><><>

"I do what I always do in these cases: I put the message
in the bottle, put the top on tightly with some chewing
gum of chamoy which the sea gives me, I plant myself
firmly by the side of the ceiba, with all my strength,
I throw the bottle with the message very far. A trail
of cloud gets it and, navigating, takes it to-wherever-
it-knows-to-take-it. There goes the bottle. Whoever finds
it can, by breaking it, break the silence and find some
answers and many questions. Perhaps he will also be able
to read..."

In the name of the 300

    "The Ballad Of Kevin Mitnick: a parody."
    To the tune of Gilligan's Island
    By Deeply Shrouded And Quiet (206)

"It started when they tracked him down,
and threw him in a cell."
The time he's spent, the years gone by,
It's been a living hell.
He sits in jail, without no bail.
They say he is a threat.....
The whole damned thing's political
On that you can sure bet.....
On that you can sure bet.....

No phone! No 'net! No ISP!
Not a single luxury!
With murderers and psychopaths,
He's locked up as can be....
In Sol-i-tary.....

Now Bernie S. they let him out
yes Bernie S is free....
While Kevin sits and rots in jail
In Sol-i-tary....
In Sol-i-tary....

The movie that they want to make....
It is a bunch of lies....
But Mirimax don't give a damn.....
If Kevin lives or dies.....
If Kevin lives or dies.....

So spread this song throughout the world....
And let the public see....
No speedy trial all three years......
Kevin should be set free....
Kevin should be set free....

"If the shameful acts of the Mexican political class are 
merchandise for the powerful communications media, and
whose successful presentation is measured in "rating"
points, for the immense majority of those who struggle
and die between the Rio Bravo and the Suchiate, they are
only a continuation of the State crime which spans almost
the entire century."

Dear ATI Marco Capelli,
Here is a pretty intresting press release 
we think pertains to your ezine.
For more information please contact Mike Kelum (702) or 
email: admin@vegasgirls2u.com 
You can also preview the site at
http://www.vegasgirls2u.com -- 
Actual outcall girls and guys are available
for interviews or appearances. 
President John Zito is also available for
comment.

Press Release-For Immediate Release
Internet Prostitution?
LAS VEGAS, September 1, 1998 - 
The promotion of outcall girls is online.
The controversial, newly launched website is
the first collection of hundreds of professional 
outcall girls who are available 24 hours a day 
to come direct to your Las Vegas hotel room to
strip totally naked and dance for you in the 
privacy of your own room. With both men and 
women available, nude photos are displayed with a brief
description, including measurements, interests, and phone number. 

The site is run by First Class Incorporated 
(President, John Zito) which has been running outcall 
services in Las Vegas for the last 15 years.
Police allege the site is nothing more than 
a front for prostitution. Zito denies those allegations.

First Class Incorporated has dabbled in the adult 
'online market' but never before were girls accessible 
directly online for in-room service. Zito, who
is not only posting a large collection of girls 
from his agency, has added <...> 
         (Rest Deleted Because Who Cares)

[Editors Note: What on EARTH made your robot think this
release would be "a pretty intresting press release 
we think pertains to your ezine." I published this
just to show you all what kinds of silliness I put up
with week to week. Ay yay, yay, yay...]

Greetings from Swiss exile!
Billy Blythe a/k/a Bill Clinton, was ignorant to have an 
"inappropriate relationship" with the young, intern. 
You have to be ignorant to do something like that in such a 
public place while you're such a public person: the number ONE 
public person and the number ONE public place. He can't keep his 
pants on, just like the doll that's sellin' like hotcakes
all over the world, the "Bubba" doll that you must have seen 
over there.
   He is, among other things, a sex maniac. He's also, 
as a major British newspaper recently pointed out, 
"stupid dumb SOB". Their Swiss counterpart plastered on their 
exceptionally large, boldface headlines: 
"The President Is A Fool!"
   He's pulling the USA even lower in the gutter than it's 
been the past few years that he's been in "office". 
The USA is now thought of as a world dictator, and the dictator 
snorts coke, murders his opponents and can't keep his sex organ 
in his shorts. The Swiss used to adore Herr Clinton and the
country he presides over. No more. Like the rest of the world, 
they are beginning to nurture a hatred of the USA and their 
cokehead "leader" which will take many years to extinguish. 
The cover this week calls the USA the "World Dictator" and 
the extensive article tells how Billy Blythe a/k/a 
Bill Clinton is: 
"...everything from a sex degenerate to a cocaine dealer to
a murderer." This is only one of hundreds of similar 
magazine/newspaper covers that look like this. 
   If you'd travel a bit outside the USA, you'd be absolutely 
ashamed to see what the world thinks of America and Americans 
today. They're a laughing stock, especially El Presidente. 
When an America-loving conservative magazine like "FACTS" 
puts something on the cover like the mentioned picture, 
you know Billy Blythe's damaged the reputation of 
the country more than all the other presidents 
in history combined. 
   He makes Georgey Porgy look like an honourable man, 
and he, too, was a sex pervert, but at least he raped 
and murdered six-year-old boys like "Brandon" 
behind-the-scenes, in a secret lodge in Nebraska, 
not in the Oval Office.
   In Liberty,

Marco,
Thank you very much for visiting our e-zine and leaving a message 
on our guestbook.  We apologize for not responding earlier but 
raising an infant, finishing law school and studying for 
(and then taking) the bar exam left us a bit frazzled.  
We sincerely appreciate your comments about our zine and hope to 
have the next issue out in a couple of weeks.

<PAWN>(Prime Anarchist World News Tonite)
VATICAN CITY--In a historic reversal of its nearly 
2,000-year-old pro-meek stance, the Catholic Church announced 
Tuesday that it is permanently rescinding the traditional "blessed" 
status of the world's meek.
     "Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ once said, 
     'Blessed are the meek,'"said Pope John Paul II in a papal 
     bull read before the College of Cardinals. "However, there 
     has always been a tacit understanding between the Church 
     and the meek that this 'blessed' status was conditional upon 
     their inheritance of the earth, an event which seems
     unlikely to happen anytime in the foreseeable future. 
     Our relationship, therefore, must be terminated."
"Screw the meek," the pope added.
     Citing "two millennia of inaction and non-achievement" 
     by the world's impoverished and downtrodden, the pope 
     contended that the meek's historic inability to improve 
     their worldly status constituted "bad faith" on their part.
"Twenty centuries should have been more than enough time for them to 
inherit the earth," the Supreme Pontiff said. 
"For years, the Catholic Church has made every effort to help them, 
but at some point, enough is enough. We are patient, but we are 
not saints."
     Catholic leaders around the world were vocal in their 
     support of the pope.
"The meek have abused their blessed status for far too long now," 
said Bernard Law, Archbishop of Boston. "From the Renaissance to the
Industrial Revolution to the current Global Information Age, the meek
have always somehow managed to sit back and do nothing while others
worked hard to make advances and improve their lives. They have
collected the Catholic Church's spiritual welfare checks 
for long enough."
     "Everything about the meek, from their simple garments 
     to their quiet demeanors to their utter lack of can-do spirit, 
     goes against Church philosophy," Cardinal Jean-Claude Turcotte 
     of Montreal said. "Sitting back and expecting the Lord 
     to provide is not the type of behavior for which the Church 
     should be rewarding its followers."
The change in policy toward the meek is also rooted in financial
considerations: According to Vatican statistics, though more than 80
percent of the world's Catholics live below the poverty line, the
Catholic Church receives less than 2 percent of its annual earnings of
$395 billion from such people.
     "The meek's blessed status was originally bestowed upon them 
     by Jesus Christ Himself, but there is enough latitude in 
     His gospels and teachings to allow us discretion in this manner," 
     the pope said, "especially in light of the financial goals of 
     the Church as it enters the 21st century. From this day forward, 
     the Church position shall be, 'Blessed are the affluent, 
     for they have indeed inherited the Earth.'"
In an effort to move away from its traditional meek core demographic
and attract more upscale worshipers, Vatican officials announced a
number of changes for the Gospels. Among them: Christ shall be said to
have been born in a rustic-but-spacious birthing suite and not a
manger, with the amount of gold and frankincense bestowed upon Him by
the wise men quadrupled and the amount of myrrh halved; it shall
henceforth be as easy for a rich man to enter Heaven as it is for a
camel to pass through a heated three-car garage; and the episode
between Christ and the moneylenders in the temple shall from now on be
interpreted as an internecine argument over appropriately aggressive
fundraising tactics.
     According to Holy See spokesperson Salvatore Vittorio, 
     a new Catholic Church payment plan has been established, 
     with blessedness and God's everlasting love free of charge 
     once a nominal baptism/membership fee has been paid. 
     For an additional fee, Catholics can become "Gold
     Circle" members of the Church, entitling them to such perks as
     forgiveness, sainthood and special priority seating at the 
     right hand of the Father upon death.
"We do not wish the Church to become completely exclusionary,'
Vittorio said. "If any of the former meek wish to change their ways,
they may certainly do so. But it won't be the free ride they got
before, I can promise you that."

OH! DO ME TOO.
(PAWN)-Georgia.
   Borith Yaltsin admits publicly to an affair with
Raisa Gorbachov.
   "I pointed my missile," said the President, but we 
did NOT, I repeat - did not have sex."
   The president said it's over, he made a mistake;
he's sorry, and his people want him to get right back
to work.
   At the end of the summit, Yaltsin taught Klinton
the Russian tradition of hugging Hilary, Tiper and 
Chelsee.
   "It was awkward at first," said Klinton. "But I
got better at it afterwards."
   Klinton said he's not as good as Yaltsin at putting
his tongue in Hilary's mouth. Once he got better at that
he was able to begin working at traditional family
valves. Klinton blew sax, while Yaltsin wailed on the
3-string guitar.
   Both wore leather pants that show the entire butt.
