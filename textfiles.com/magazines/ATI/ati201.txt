I DID    N O T    APRECIATE LIBERTARIANS USING
THE OLD  "MARCO POLO"  JOKE  TO POKE  FUN  OF
PROTESTERS'  CHANTS THIS  WEEK ON  NATIONAL

Hi, I'm Prime Anarchist and this is Annotated
Time, IzmSkizmWuzzmist. Issue 201. This week's
zine is very short because there just weren't 
many newsworthy things happening around.
  Do you smell a certain "scathe" in my tone
here? 
  I hope so. 
  Making connections. I hope I wan't catalyst
for someone's going postal today; 
  "Would you like any insurance or proof back
of delivery?" my USPS window clerk asks me.
  "No thanks," I tell him recognizing he's not
all that thrilled about having to ask us these
obligatories.
  "But I sure could go for some fries right about
now, or supersize maybe." Big grin I give 'em.
  He didn't reciprocate. Maybe he didn't like
my funny? Have a nice day.
  Happy Chrizmakkah
  Feliz Complicitanos.
  Merry Guadelup,
prime

HEAD LETTUCE:

OPEN LETTER TO FATHER ROY, 
  I attended the action in Georgia two days ago feeling very good
about what I was a part of.  I did not leave with the same feeling.
  Why?
  I believe that if the SOAW is going to use Gandi for non-violence
training, then we must also follow his cocept of transparency.
  Secrets, apart from being potentially dangerous, take away from
the feeling of unity and solidarity of the rest of the group.
They also make it hard for one to prepare to partake in a high-risk
action if they do not know what they are doing until the day before.
I hope you will consider these points when planning your next action.

   great sites. you know of course that gandhi was influenced mostly by
Tolstoy's book "The Kingdom of God is Within You" which is where Gandhi
got the whole idea of non-violent resistance as well as his basic core
beliefs and attitude toward the state.

Dear ATI People,
Who is Billy Speer and why are hundreds of copies
of his Christmas album which he made in Littleton, 
CO selling new in my local Goodwill store?
Dave Letterman (no relation) 
   [you got me. Makes me wonder why Goodwill's even
    selling new things? I thought they were a donated
    products type place. Oh well the word "industries"
    should give it away I guess. Do you think maybe
    they think they're manufacturing goodwill???]

Why I Write  --  Marc Frucht

8th Waffle House from the School of the Americas

When I was born, young american GI's shot and killed Panamanians
who were demanding the canal be returned.
  When I was 1, our young CIA helped kill more than a million
Indonesian people.
  By the time I was 2 or 3 young american soldiers were asked to
kill 43 Afrikan Americans in Detroit. I probably heard Dan Rather's
voice from my crib.
  When I was 8, no one told me we invaded Iran. When I was 9 I used
to doodle the AIM (American Indian Movement) Four Directions symbol
on my homework and sometimes into desks when nobody special was
looking.
  Somebody tried killing my hero, Mark Spitz the following year or
so. When I was almost 17 our proud navy blew two Libyan jets out of
the water. I did not raise my hand, I was too young, I didn't know
enough.
  When I was 19 friends of mine taught little boys in central amerika,
sometimes as young as 12 or 13 yrs old to assemble and disassemble
M16's and AK-47's.
  When I was 20 my taxpaying and voting allowed my country to invade
a country the size of my leg.
  When I was 24 our proud navy blew two Libyan jets out of the water.
I raised my hand half way - I was old already and knew too much.

        ...you read right...
          ...look again...

  Before my 25th birthday I participated in a war on an entire country
who's only crime was telling George Bush they weren't going to help get
crack cocaine into the streets of California anymore.
  Before that year was over friends of mine had to risk their lives in
Oman, Quatar, Bahrain, Egypt, Israel and Colorado Springs.
  Shortly after my 28th birthday, military people I'd left behind to my
new pacifist birth had to occupy Los Angeles for God knows how long.
Will it be decades? I was walking across Nebraska when LA lay under 
siege.
  In Omaha my life was saved by one Crip and two Bloods.
  I fear that I hate my government. I don't wish to.
  Fault me - I'm wrestling with some forgiveness issues right now.

  "that non-violent warrior spirit."

  a kinder gentler overthrow.

172: UNDER THE INTERSTATE
      another marco poetic

Can you walk a mile 
In Reggie White's running shoes?
I ride 5 or 6 every day:
And that many again - 
Home before I wake.

By the water
The yucky, muddy,
Mucky Yuddy Fox River.

Can you say PCBs???

(tho I must confess, cleaner than my home river)

To my right - a wigwam - a short round wooden
     LONNNNNNNNNNGHOUSE
A fence cordons between us - no reading of
            Plaques til next spring.
Behind me?
Prison - a big one.
Bursting...seems...like a college or an 
           ARMY BASE
More will be built near here soon.
To better accomodate than the 
     CURRENT PLAN:
Selling bodies to other states: potential labor?
Or is this "in addition" rather than "Instead of" 
          I wonder?

To my left: bones of a walleye from 
Last summer or fall's run I'm sure.

Above - 
Thousands of cars HUMMING East and West.

Necessitating more jails and dead fish
And wigwams ensconced in
fences and plaques discussing PAST.
Our past - your future - our future - your Past.

I'm wearing Reggie White's sneakers
BUT NOT HIS ATTITUDE.

No, not me.
I've walked more than a mile
I've walked months' worth of miles
In Reggie White's shoes.

I've gotten more mileage out of
Reggie White's Sneakers
Than he ever thought those Cons could give!

I guess I'm the master recycler, reuser
Of Reggie White's black and white
   SHOES.
The Rabbi of re-use.
Perchance I could teach 
Reggie White a thing or two.

SomeBody should.

SPOOFING KIPLINGER

Dear Client:
  The auto industry's screwed.
  Blame the internet.
  Trust me on this one, I can't explain, it's
just true. Major upheaval, get out now. Buy
Nothing Day kicked their butts this year too.
Nail in the coffin you could say. The horse
is already dead.
  Parking problems already.
  Who's going to buy more cars without giving used 
ones to the kids? Basically the AGE is over. We've
sucked all the nectar we can from this tree, people.
We've run out of consumers, we've run out of space,
we've just plum run out.
  Some cities will try hanging cars by their front
bumper, others will try the front tires. Buy extra
damage insurance.
  College tuition will do what it's been doing since
1788. Hurt everyone, make everyone hate each other.
  Surgeons will use computer simulators instead of 
cadavers. Get out of India's dead-body market by the
end of the year. 
  People will spend their y2k safety cash on restaurants
rather than putting it back in banks. Invest heavy in
Taco Bell, McDonalds and ChiChi's about 15Jan.
  Iowa will give free tuition to college dropouts,
hoping to build tourism from "slacker capitol of the
world," philosophy.
  Senator McCain will flog a native american on national
TV in New Hampshire hoping to win away some of the 
mean-people vote, and perhaps nose past Bush in the 
country's most important primary. Almost as big as
the Boston Marathon or the first lady's dress size.
  Mexico will become more like the US. Courses in 
genocide, assassination and cocaine use have become very
popular at Univeristy of Mexico now that NAFTA has 
allowed the US to market its franchise of SCHOOLS OF THE
AMERICAS. 
  Beijing will join WTO. I can't tell you here but you
can find out which American companies make TV sets and 
invest for the long haul.
Truly, Madly Deeply,
Kristoph Kiplinger.
