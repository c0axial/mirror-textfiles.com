Actually, they've been around for a little while now...
These are actual Coke and M'n'M machines connected to the 
Internet, and when fingered, provide you with the amount of 
soft drinks held within.
I doubt you could hack 'em, anyway... and if you could, how 
would you get the product? :)
These are just interesting, so I put them in. Enjoy.

SEWER BACKUP SINKS 700,000-PLUS HOMES.
   Written by Staci Charles
(PAWN) New Fork, NF - In the suburbs around New Fork City
yesterday people in their homes suddenly found themselves 
sinking.
   Reggie Smith came home to find that his house was four
feet underground. 
   "I just left for work in the morning, and when I came
home I couldn't open my door." Rescuers are still trying
to save some 20,000 people still stuck in their houses.
Over 747,747 homes were affected.
   Investigators are blaming the growing use of hoses to
keep lawns green, and the fact that several bears and 
other woodland creatures have been spotted relieving
themselves in the sewers. "We've just taken away too 
many of the trees, their natural toilets," said Nancy
Weildman, forest ranger. Weildman went on to explain 
that trees are naturally better processors of bear
whiz than sewersystems.



WORMS: GIVE US $ FOR OUR WORK!

Normal, ILL - In the first ever suit filed by worms,
the worms claim that they should be compensated for
the work done by them to help humans catch fish and
other such feats. There will be more details on this 
case in the next issue; this trial will be our feature
issue for the next week.

And now, an official Prime Anarchist
Semi-legible rant. 
   Yeah, yeah. I know, usually this is
bedazzling the Publisher's Column. But
I thought I'd mix things up a bit. Get
this here now, and then next week will
be bizz bizz as you zoo wool.
   "Haha, I have one ready," said the first
woman today who sold me a lemonade. She was
holding it just out of site like flowers
behind her back until I held out my buck and
said "large lemonade please."
   I ended up dumping it a little while after
that (which got resolved nicely (topic for 
some other story)) when I sat down in the 
shade under the pavillion during my break from
a hard day of busking. About 50 feet from me
stood a woman with only two teeth staring at me
pointing my way with a ciGarette between the
two finGers she's usinG to point. I Guess you
had to be there. Perfect movie moment. Where's
Super8 when you need it. She's smilinG wide,
never stoppinG. LookinG like a freezeframe 
from hell.
   My third time Glancing her way (believe me -
there's much better things to be looking at here 
at the place I busk every summer) seeing her still
GawkinG made me a little bit bothered. No, 
smitten wouldn't be a Good word here. Pissed? 
Tweeked? Flustered? More like feelinG sorry,
but more toward "Get away!"
   I'll bet I dumped my lemonade like a snake 
makinG potty in your hand so you'll let him
escape.
   OK, doe key. EnouGh psycho-socio-cerebro anal asses,
eh?
   You know what sucks? I got a letter to the
editor from a hacker in Taiwan this week.
He wrote it in Taiwanese!!! I can't read that 
stuff!!!
   I wish I could do commo with the Guy, or 
"Gal," or whatever. I really do. I don't even have 
a way to know what's a word, what's a phrase,
and what's a paGe break, so I can't feed the
thing into a translator or anything either! AT LEAST
NOT ANY ONES I'M FAMILIAR WITH. THIS JUST BITES.
IT REALLY DOES. I TRIED TO WRITE BACK A LETTER
IN ENGLISH THAT WASN'T TOO ETHNOCENTRIC AT LEAST.
   Oh well, I'm just a little flubbercrusted, I 
Guess. And never mind that it was the only actual
letter to the editor ATI    G O T    T H I S 
 W E E K ! ! ! 
   I'm riding the city bus today and this lady
weiGhing almost as little as 30 pounds or so's
wearing an old fashioned Grey basketball wristband
sweatband underneath her watch (yeah, I've seen that
"style" where does that show up from???) would you
know it, she's pullinG the bus-stop-request-cord
with a yellow kleenex.
   Ohp, she's holding each railinG pole with it too!
Careful, lady. I saw some of your skin touch that
metal from the pole there. Just a little bit. Ooh.
Better use peroxide...
   This has been a rant the size of a mendicant
telephant. 




We end with a short poem by Amy Ouzoonian
   [reprinted from a book I 4got the name of
    and DOH! I 4got to write it down...]

(why do we end with poetry?
    BECAUSE IN THE END, ALL U GOT IS MYTH)

Their weddingbands
