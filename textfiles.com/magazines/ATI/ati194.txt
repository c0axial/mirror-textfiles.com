England swings like a pendulum do
Poets on bicycles, two by two
Westminster Abbey, the tower of Big Ben
The rosy red cheeks of the little children

    NOT VERY CLOSE TO GROUNDHOG DAY

    ...---...           ...---...

EVERYONE KNOWS ABOUT THE BLUE PAPER TOWELS:
But I'll Tell You In Case You Don't Remember.

  -=-the prime anarchist publisher column-=-

   I drive up to the truckstop after playing at a small
local bar here called IQ's and three young women are at
the island where you throw away your empty quarts of oil
and your blue paper towels. Two of them are tending to the
cutest of the three as she pukes her guts out into the
island-ash-can.
   I pass them and go in for my late nite snack and the
second thing I notice is that none of my usual friends
are here.
   Secondly, what's playing on muzak satellite but
the Northern Exposure TV theme song. Every trucker in
this country right now - 3am eastern, midnite west of
me - every trucker tapped into muzak.sat as their mobil
ISP is listening to a dag-bloomed overfed moose walking
down a small old-fashioned cityblock main street past
a hardware store.
   The sweetest-sounding guitarist in all of Brown County
just informed us all of two things. 1) their band is
breaking up because he's moving to Chicago for a great
tech support job. 2) Al Gore is still insisting on
claims he coined the phrase INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY.
   Well then, this must have been the scenario: Gore
logs into Infomaniack BBS at either 3, 12 or 2400
[does Al even know what a BAUD is???] and reads one of
about 50 posts using the words "information highway."
     [Of course, he could have gotten this on
      more than 900 other open BBS's, I don't
      mean to elevate my little tenure as a
      SYSOP too much.]
He probably tries marketing INFORMATION AUTOBAHN with
no luck. Infobahn's surely his next try and a great
embarrassment. Hardly anyone will take him seriously now.
   I probably receive an Alliance Teleconference call from
someone and consensus leads to action and I probably
accidentally key his # instead of Al Bell's at about
2am some Sunday catching Gore coming out of a slow
steady funky Ibogaine fog; and he has to hear me tell him
        "INFO... SUPO... HIGH WAY, AL.
'INFO HIGHWAY,' RUN WITH IT, AL. TAKE IT, THEY'LL FORGET
YOUR STIFFNESS, YOUR LACK OF TALENT, YOUR POOR WORD
CHOICE. EVEN THE FACT YOU MARRIED A NAZI. ALL WILL
BE FORGIVEN, AL..."
   "Info-superhighway Al. Take! run! Don't look back.
You'll be adored. People will be speed-dialing
your name."
   Of course Al wrote "bridge to the 20th century too."
   And "a chicken in every pot?"
   Al.
   One small step...? Ask not what your...? Al, I'm telling
you. Homer's Odyssey, Dante's Inferno. Have you ever heard of
ghostwriters? That was all Al. All day, all night. All Al.
   A fourth fellow runs for the blue papertowels wondering
if he doesn't have radiation poisoning from events 4,000
miles away.

     REGRET a poem by amy ballinger

 I took one glimpse then swallowed you whole.
 I really only wanted your soul.
 But you hid it deep inside,
 Farther than even your emotions can hide.
 Truly I savored nothing In the rush,
 Telling my true feelings mainly to hush.
 So here I lie next to you,
 Feeling the lonely, and also the blue.
 Please don't take this the wrong way,
 But I won't stay here another day.
 Because no matter how much we shape and mold
 Our hearts will never be more than cold,
 And pain has taught me all that I know,
 And your kisses can only soften the blow.

MICHIGAN SEEMS LIKE A DREAM TO ME NOW

I AM NOW IN ANN ARBOR FOR THE FIRST NATIONAL
CONFERENCE ON THE SANCTIONS ON IRAQ BUT I DON'T
DO CONFERNCES, SO I WANDER, MEET PEOPLE AND DRINK
TOO MUCH COFFEE...
     I AM NOW ON THE THIRD FLOOR OF THE
HARLAN HATCHER GRADUATE LIBRARY.  ON THE
SEVENTH FLOOR IS THE LABADIE COLLECTION,
LABADIE WAS AN ANARCHIST AT THE TURN OF
THE CENTURY.
    MY HEART FEELS SURROUNDED BY VIOLENCE.
THE VIOLENCE OF THE RECENTLY SIGNED DEATH
SENTENCE OF MUMIA, THE MILTARY INTERVENTION/SANCTIONS
ON IRAQ, E. TIMOR, YUGOSLAVIA, SO I COME HERE TO REST
IN THE WORDS OF THE PORT HURON STATEMENT...

   (WRITTEN BY STUDENTS FROM ALL OVER THE US BANNED
      FROM MEETING AT THE U. OF MICHIGAN SO THEY
  GATHERED IN A BAR IN NEARBY PORT HURON 1962-1968)

WE ARE PEOPLE OF THIS GENERATION, BRED IN AT LEAST MODEST
COMFORT, HOUSED IN UNIVERSITES, LOOKING UNCOMFORTABLY TO
THE WORLD WE INHERIT...

A WORLD PERMEATING AND VICTIMIZING OF HUMAN DEGRADATION
BY RACIAL BIGOTRY, THE COLD WAR AND AMERICA'S LATEST
MILITARY ADVENTURE IN SOUTH EAST ASIA. OUR WORK IS
GUIDED BY THE SENSE THAT WE MAY BE THE LAST GENERATION
IN THE EXPERIMENT OF LIVING. BUT WE ARE A MINORITY...
AS THE STUDENTS OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY (SDS),
   IF WE APPEAR TO SEEK THE UNATTAINABLE, AS IT HAS
BEEN SAID, THEN LET IT BE KNOWN THAT WE DO SO TO
AVOID THE UNIMAGINABLE.

I LOOK OUT OVER THE HILLS OF ANN ARBOR AND BEGIN
TO CRY OVER ALL I LOVE AND HAVE LOST...

   I BREATH IN THE OILY MUSTY SMELL OF OLD MIMEOGRAPH
PAPER, TAPPED ON THE SHOULDER I AM INFORMED THAT IT IS
NOON AND THAT THE SPECIAL COLLECTIONS LIBRARY WILL BE
         C L O S I N G . . .

SOL (Signal Of Love) just received a 40-foot donated
semi-trailer that will be functioning as a container
for Los Angeles based donations. The container is in
a secured facility but is accessible regular business
hours only. Each month the trailer will be loaded into
a regular semi (also donated) and sped up to Black Mesa.
Already the October run, planned later this month has 12
pallets of goods, mostly food.
   [I am reminded of a time when Abbie Hoffman
    got a couple Teamster friends to fill up an
     18-wheeler with bagels and grapefruits, and
       guess where this "booty" ended up?]

The Bruins are off to their worst

Sorry, love Bill, but that's like

They're done.

MY NAME IS RIVER NOLA
a poem by river
I am a woman of strength and courage and wisdom.
I stand on my own NOT a failure or victim.
The system corrupts and blinds the citizen.
I rise up and discover the higher nutrition
Of solitude and love and respect for the earth.
Our sustenance, our life, our mother of  birth.

An ATI Either/Or Question:
   As much as we hate them - they really do get things
done. They take care of business, and much better than
T/F or multiple guess questionaires; and to top it off
"americans" the world over have come to know and love them.
   "Don't ask me some complex question about how I feel
or what I want, or even what I'd suggest. Boil it down
to an either/or and then let me decide."
   So here it is. Next restaurant your eating in?
Make a note of the sound.
   Kenny G or live music?
   Then get back to us at ati@etext.org
   Now, if your answer doesn't really fit, feel free
to jot down a short note and we'll either moosh it
into the criterion like so many other editors and
publishers, or we may just be different. Watch the
next few issues for results.
   a) Kenny G type stuff.
   b) live or invigorating food for your soul.

Switching Sides
by Taylor Mali

reprinted from "Will Work For Peace"
a Zeropanik press anthology edited by
Brett Axel
http://www.orn.net/~axels

Typed in by prime anarchist productions.
http://www.thepentagon.com/primeanarchist
A subsidiary of ATI, Activist Timor, Indus.

I'm writing the poem that will change the world,
and it's Lily Wilson at my office door.
Lily Wilson, the recovering like addict,
the worst I've ever seen.
So bad the whole eighth grade
used to call her Like Lily Like Wilson.

Until I declared my class a like-free zone
and she could not speak for days.
And when she did, it was to say,

  Mr. Mali, this is ... so hard.
  Now I have to ... think before I ... say anything.

It's for your own good, Lily. Even if you don't, like ...
It.

I'm writing the poem that will change the world
while Lily writes a research paper about how gays
should not be allowed to adopt children.
I'm writing the poem that will change the world,
and it's Lily Wilson at my office door.
She's having trouble finding sources,
or rather ones that back her up:

   They all argue in favor
   of what I thought I was against.

And it took all four years of college,
three years of grad school,
and every incidental teaching experience I ever had
to let out only, So what are you going to do Lily?

  I can't believe I'm saying this,
  but I think I'd like ... to switch sides.

And I want to tell her to do more than just believe it,
but to enjoy it.
And that changing your mind is the best way
to make sure that you still have one.
Or even that minds are like parachutes:
that it doesn't matter how you pack them
so long as they open at the right time.
O God Lily, I want to say
You make me feel like a teacher
and who could ask to feel more than that?
I want to say all this, but only manage,
Lily, I am, like so impressed.

So I finally taught someone something,
namely, how to change their mind.
And I learned in the process that if I ever change the world
It will be one eighth grader at a time.

    ----====----

Mali teaches at Browning school. His poetry slam team won two
nationals. He's pretty well published. He's also kicking Henry
Rollins' butt because the Burger King phrase "It just tastes
right," or "It just tastes better," or whatever was not only
written by him, but he did the first voice over.
