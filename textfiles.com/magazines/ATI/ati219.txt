LETTUCE FROM THIS ISSUE'S EDITOR:

Hi there.

Prime is on a mission. Not just any mission, mind you.

As I type this, he is in Washington, DC protesting the School Of the
Americas. Now, those of you who read ATI regularly will know what the
SOA is. If not, then a brief explanation is in order.

The School of Americas is a school operated by the US Government to
train Latin American soldiers and Government officials in
military/counterrevolutionary tactics.

Over the past few years, evidence has surfaced that the SOA has taught
terrorism tactics to its students. Among the SOA's nearly 60,000
graduates are dictators Manuel Noriega and Omar Torrijos of Panama,
Leopoldo Galtieri and Roberto Viola of Argentina, Juan Velasco Alvarado
of Peru, Guillermo Rodriguez from Ecuador, and Hugo Banzer Suarez of
Bolivia. SOA graduates have also participated in the assassination of
Archbishop Oscar Romero and the El Mozote Massacre of 900 civilians.

Each year, there are protests at the US Capitol and the school's home at
Ft. Benning, GA. The protests call for the closure of the school: an
idea that has recieved some congressional support. "There can be no
mistake that the School of the Americas has trained some of the most
despised and corrupt military officers in Latin America." Rep. Dan
Hamburg, D-CA, debate to close the US Army School of the Americas, US
House of Representatives, May 20,1994.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
(I know it's been in past issues of ATI,
but it's worth another look.)

SOA
(Marc Frucht)

Just got back from the school today, mama.
Didn't learn a thing today, mama.
Stuff you said about the golden rule
Never shows up at that evil school
Ain't goin' to that school no more.

(chorus)
Ain't goin' to that school no more, mama
Ain't goin' to that school no more, mama
Don' worry mama I'll be OK
They got nothin' I can use anyway.
Ain't goin' to that school no more.

Marched right into that school today, mama.
Told them to put their toys away, mama.
All they taught me I don' need.
Glutton, stealin',   corporate greed.
Ain't goin to that school no more.

(Chorus)

This is School of Americas, mama
Hate & Conflict 101, mama
Programmed rage from the butt of a gun
Sold their soul to Channel One.
Ain't goin to that school no more.

BONUS IN THIS ISSUE: Music!

Records The Big P recommends.

"Kristofferson" by Kris Kristofferson
("Blame It On The Stones" and "The Law Is For Protection Of The People"
are worth the price alone.)

"Honky Tonk Heroes" by Waylon Jennings
"Unplugged" before MTV got hold of it.
Great guitar work. Great lyrics too.

Any David Allan Coe Lp.
Coe made a reputation of telling Nashville where to shove it. And he had
the cajones to back it up. Plus a few #1 records didn't hurt.

"Prairie Home Invasion" by Jello Biafra & Mojo Nixon
Biafra and Mojo? It happened. One of the first alt.country records...and
still one of the best.

"The Cold Hard Facts Of Life" by Porter Wagoner. Before Dolly came
along, Porter made some of the most haunting and explicit records in
country music history. "The First Mrs. Jones", "Julie", and "I Just
Can't Let You Say Goodbye" would have likely been banned if released
today.
