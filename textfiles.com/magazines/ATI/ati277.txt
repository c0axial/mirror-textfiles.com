"Livin' on reds, vitamin C and cocaine," 
I sing to myself popping my "morning three": 
one grapefruit pectin, one cat's claw, one 
bayer aspririn.

Way over yonder in the minor key, it's 
Activist Times, Inc. issue 277.
  Wasn't Pudge Fisk's # 27? Or was that 
Larry Czonka? The "Sportcoat and Tie" 
issue.
  101% dressed up and ready to go.
Or was that all dressed up and no
where to throw? Glow? Grow. So Pearl 
Harbor didn't beat Vlassic Park, or 
Fission Impossible, eh?
  What does it mean? It means Drudge
got his butt whooped, that's what it means.
Alright! Issue 277. Love it or turn the page... 
OK, we'll start with our usual numbers run and then on and on...
                   and on to prime anarchist world news tonite.

  Who really owns Snapple?
  Because if you go to four coffee shops and 
they're each trying to be "unlike" the other 
three; how different can they be if each has 
the official Snapple (tm) double-door fridge
placed prominantly? More like "different within 
similar parameters."
  Who really owns Sisco foods?
  Do you frequent three different restaurants?
Do you like them for the similarities or the
differences? What really IS different?
Cooking style? People who hand it to you?? What 
color the tables and wallpaper are???
  There used to be more differences. Maybe the
movie "Repo Man" was right all along? Profound

  Of course I want him to live forever, but don't
we all? I think the most horrendous crime is the
shortened lives of people like him, and maybe people
like me who handled a few of the 100 pound shells
while they were "inert," (is that the right word?)
  I will never forget seeing depleted uranium shells
on the same tanks in colorado springs that had to
retrain constantly both there, and in fort hood, tx.,
because idiots ranking between E-4 and O-5 couldn't
tell the difference between a 4 pound charge, a 
5 pound charge and a 6 pound charge.
  If you've got no idea what I'm talking about I'll
describe it like this. Members of units near me while
I was stationed in the signal corps would give the
fire command for say, a 4 pound charge and a 100 pound
shell. With the angle of the turret and the poundage
of the charge, you can schedule a bomb to hit say, the
very base of a hill in colorado.
  If someone accidentally puts a 6 pound charge in instead
of the scheduled 4, well, lets just say you accidentally
kill a couple forward observers at the top of the hill.
Has that happened a couple times while I was serving in
Colorado? Well, does the fact that those units next to
me had to go to fort hood to practice holding 4 pound 
charges in their hands and shout "four pound charge sir!"
and then a 5 pound charge saying "five pound charge sir..."
and so on, answer your question? OK, if it doesn't, then
yes. Some forward observers were killed a few different
times in the three short years I served.
  And that was "peacetime," imagine what chaos we allowed
during our little wars on Noriega and Hussein?
  And the horror I face every night now as I try to dream
instead of nightmare is as follows:

imagine if some of these same idiots are required to
chant "hundred millimeter shell WITHOUT uranium sir,"
and "hundred millimeter shell WITH uranium, sir!"
four to six hours a day for a few weeks because of
similar prior accidents?

Yikes!

Come together
