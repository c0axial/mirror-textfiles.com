"Bimbo Buys Five U.S. Bakeries"
  That's the headline of the millenium I think.
Bimbo is whitebread in Mexico. Now they're 
branching out. Among other things, they'll be
making and distributing your Orowheat bread, 
Entenmann's pastries, Thomas' English Muffins 
and Boboli pizza kits.

Is it media or mind control, 
Heroic victories or crimes
Who will tell the people 
That we're living in these times"

How come when I get porn spam I have to hit \cancel\ 5 times to keep
my email from opening up a webpage,  but when I get "get rich quick"
or "cheap college diploma" spams I only have to hit \cancel\ 3 times?

So who's Pink's dad? Her date when she accepted a Billboard
award. I'll betcha he's some bigshot record exec.

AND NOW?
  THE KIPLINGER WANNABE REPORT

Do you even want to hear Rob Zombie, Eddie Vedder, Red Hot Chili
Peppers, Green Day, Offspring and Rancid doing Ramones covers??
I don't.
  Why don't the Ramones just hire two or three guys to play Joey
and they can tour as Ramonamania.
  What does Sears have to do with CD's? Just you wait, you'll see.
  "Being a VJ means you have to retain a lot of information on

Japan's going to have an economic crash this Feb or March. You might
want to consider Argentina for your vacation destination or trading
partner instead.
  This is the year. Ask your boss if you can do a couple days a week
from your house. No, ask again. S/he'll finally say yes. I know
these things. Trust me.
  Wait, I'm talking to the upper middle class again. The rest of you
just ignore that last one. There's be a bunch for you soon.
  I have a clue for how Shakira her sound finally.
  S. Mebarak, R and T Mitchell, I. Gotti, L. Perry, and Gloria 
Estefan.
  You know, my dad didn't like me wearing Budweiser and Miller

until many years later.
  Why would I ever want to see a rock concert in Smirnoff music
centre, or Absolut Civic Center. Bertelsmann ampitheatre???
  Clearchannel ent. owns and operates Phil Lesh, Aerosmith, Ozzy,
Rob Zombie, Amy Grant, Vince Gill, Mud Vayne and Madonna. House of
Blues owns and operates Jimmy Buffet, Elton John and Sting.
  Jack Utsick Presents gets to show off Britney Spears and some
other lesser known "commodities" I won't mention until next week
or so.
  When will the circle be unbroken?

  Hey. How come a well honed song gets "Yeah, that's nice."
  While a song about Bush choking on a pretzel written in C just
your basic I IV V (not even an Am or F+ to cloud or muddy the mix)
and people are going "wow, I can see it now," "Yeah, let me send it

According to Jackson's former associate, the NYSE currently contributes 
$400,000 annually to the Wall Street Project, which features a fundraiser 
on the floor of the stock exchange. 
  All expenses for the event are paid for by the stock exchange, 
including the tab for drinks and live music, featuring rapper 
Sean "P Diddy" Combs and Jackson's daughter, singer Santita Jackson. 
  But sources say Jackson has angered some executives on Wall Street 
with his comments about the U.S. government's response to the Sept. 11 
terrorist attacks. 
  "Members of the New York Stock Exchange are appalled and can't understand 
why [Exchange Chairman] Dick Grasso is kowtowing to someone they view as 
anti-American," said the Wall Street banker.
  Jackson has decried the U.S. bombing campaign in Afghanistan and called 
Attorney General John Ashcroft a terrorist "suspect [because] he threatens 
democracy."

>JELLO BIAFRA WARNS OF BAIT-AND-SWITCH TACTICS
>IN FAKE DEAD KENNEDYS TOUR
>
>Due to the high volume of complaints coming our way, Jello Biafra
>again warns of bait-and-switch tactics in his former bandmates use of
>the name Dead Kennedys for their current tour.  Both Biafra and his
>label, Alternative Tentacles Records, have received numerous
>inquiries from promoters, press, and angry fans on the fraudulent
>nature of the tour.
>
>The booking agency which represents Biafra's former bandmates is
>reportedly selling the band as Dead Kennedys, asking $10,000
>guarantees, and "forgetting" to tell promoters that Biafra is not in
>the band, unless specifically questioned. The band photo that the
>agency has circulated features Jello Biafra instead of the scab
>singer Brandon Cruz.  Most of the tour dates have been sold to the
>public as "Dead Kennedys", with at least one advertisement featuring
>the photo which contains Biafra.  Another tactic reported is that
>venues such as the Gothic Theater in Denver (and their sponsor, Twist
>& Shout) start out advertising the show as Dead Kennedys then
>downgrade the ads to "DK Kennedys", with members listed, two or more
>weeks after tickets have gone on sale.
>
>Jello Biafra states, "In my opinion, this is the real great rock and
>roll swindle.  They have a right to play cover versions of Dead
>Kennedys songs. Everyone does.  But I feel really badly for all the
>people paying ticket prices, reported to be as high as $25, thinking
>it's the real Dead Kennedys, and wind up getting stuck with the
>world's greediest karaoke band."
>
>Reports of the overpriced performances have not been altogether
>positive. Witnesses in San Francisco noted that Klaus Fluoride
>bragged on stage that the band had only practiced twice in thirteen
>years, and in some viewers' opinions they sounded like it.  Observers
>reported that Brandon Cruz had forgotten many of the words, if he had
>learned them at all.  An angry journalist in Brazil even tracked down
>Jello Biafra to report picking up a wad of paper that had fallen out
>of Brandon Cruz's pocket onstage, which turned out to be the words to
>"Viva Las Vegas."
>
>In August 2001, Jello received a letter from Decay's lawyer that they
>don't intend to pay Jello  unless he pays them roughly $140,000 -
>which they claim are his share of their legal bills to sue him - and
>they have provided no documentation to back this up.  So, in other
>words, Jello isn't receiving any royalties from sales of the DK
>re-issues currently in circulation via Decay/Manifesto (North
>America) and Decay/PlasticHead (Europe) or MVD Video, none of which
>were authorized by Biafra.
>
>The rogue ex-Dead Kennedys seized control of the catalog through a
>nasty lawsuit against Biafra and Alternative Tentacles stemming from
>a dispute that grew ugly after Biafra opposed the use of "Holiday in
>Cambodia" in a Levi's Dockers TV commercial to be shown worldwide.
>They now do business as Decay Music, even though the Decay Music
>partnership is now officially dissolved by the state of California.
>Biafra and A.T. are appealing the verdict.
>
>The appeal brief was filed in October on behalf of Jello Biafra's
>attorneys. Decay Music asked for a 60-day extension, which was
>granted. The respondent's brief is due on February 4th and it will
>include a cross-appellants brief. After that, more briefs will be
>filed and oral arguments will be heard when all of that is done which
>will be late spring at the earliest.
>
>Many people have asked what they can do to stop or at least expose
>what is going on.  Suggestions include spreading the word in your own
>community, which can certainly help, and continuing to support the
>Alternative Tentacles Legal Defense Fund to cover the cost of the
>appeal on the original court verdict.

FEATURED ARTIST:

I'm DaBitch. That's what I do. I bitch. I bitch about advertising, 
because I'm in it.  Media actually changes the world and I think 
people who actually work in advertising have the responsibility 
to realize that with advertising you can top people. You're getting 
people to buy things they don't want. Spend money they don't have. 
That's a bad thing. You should get them to buy things that are good 
for them. At least, do something useful with it. That's why I don't 
have a job. I started my own ad company. It's going alright. I only 
pick up clients who sell things that are actually useful. 
  Sonox.com, for instance. They pick up musicians or albums or bands 
that don't have representation in any other way and they put them on 
the internet. You could buy a song and it goes straight to the musicians. 

[My last company] made me make a Loreal ad. And I quit. I couldn't do it. 

I produce Ad-rag.com where I bullshit about advertising and say nasty 
things and a lot of internal gossip about advertising people. Which is 
only interesting to people who are in advertising, but they don't want 
it spread, and then I put it on the internet, which just really kills 
them most of the time. So for five years I had to hide the fact that 
it was me doing it because if I was out looking for a job and they 
knew I was the person they would never ever ever hire me. 

I get cease and desist orders about once a week.





FNORD!: OK. the 411 about SOA at an MP3 page. Yay, html.

Over at MP3.com there's a website you might want to check out.
  Of course only if you don't mind all their cookie ideas and
stuff. Lately, I'm thinking as bad as they are with them, at
least they're not quite as bad as CNN's news pages. Yikes. If
you look up "cookie hell" in the dictionary I bet there's a CNN
corporate logo sitting there.
  Anyhew, here it is: 

http://stations.mp3s.com/stations/126/close_the_soa.html

  ...and it's basically songs by artists known to have done 
some work toward shutting down the SOA. Last week (the 17th to
be specific) was the one year anniversary of the SOA having 
pretended to close down but reopen in the exact same buildings
with the same charter and for the same ends and means.




TOPICAL SONG: The Presidential Pretzel Rag

It was a presidential pretzel
Leather brown with a gold leaf trim.
It was a presidential pretzel
The one that almost done the president in

If you eat it too fast
You might choke on it
If something bad happens
You can certainly joke on it


Joke joke, joke joke,
They'll never know
Holy smoke
Joke joke, joke joke,
The one that almost done the president in

It was a presidential pretzel
Leather brown with a gold leaf trim.
It was a presidential pretzel
The one that almost done the president in
