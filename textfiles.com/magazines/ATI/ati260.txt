[about the "W" Hillbillies parody...]
Very, very funny!! Thank you for the laugh!

Love your Beverly Hillbillies breakdown of the 
election. Rather catchy. 
  Found myself singing a few bars around the office.
  And on your Dot.com rant... the short is that they 
are dot.gone. Along with all the cash.

   It has come to that (filtering H2O). I'm not happy about it. 
   I guess we here at the Untied States of Americancorporated 
   are seeming to take after France and England, eh? We've 
   ruined our groundwater, just about devastated our topsoil, 
   what's next, I know, let's destroy outer-space. 

   Hillbilly (Sean D.) chips in--

   they are working on that, you know
   of course you do . . .

   England, France, yes what's next?
   Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease?!

   i always thought you got your water from L. Michigan

   topsoil already devastated, if you are comparing
   it to pre euro-'settlement," that is ~ and most "farm"land
   today is only a facsimile soil-like substance or substrate
   which remains productive only through continous application
   of various chemicals and fertilizers, only some of which
   the plants can use, the rest of course is supplied free of
   charge to the public via the groundwater supply

   .. . . or to the 2000 square mile Dead Zone in the Gulf 
   of Mexico    where the anus of america, the Mississippi 
   Delta    dumps its load of toxic soil-like particles 
   into the sea

   and since much so called organic farming relies even more 
   on mechanical    weed control and tillage, many organic 
   operations <which are getting    bigger all the time> 
   still have unacceptible soil erosion rates and still
   rely on at least one chemical ~ petroleum 

   and yes, water going fast

   i always said if it comes to having to filter the 
   water i drink here in wisconsin then i think we really 
   are doomed . . .

   . . . i bought a filter last year





Tue 3:01 am - Student Council To Give Bush a Bong
    by Mark Weisenheimer. 
    Special to Prime Anarchist World Newz

CHEVY CHASE (PAWN) -- Behind the bleachers in a small ceremony
with just a handful of participants, the CC PS#3 Junior High
Student Council Chamber of MoneyMaking has last nite bestowed
the Honorific George "W" Butsch with his first gift, a priceless,
one-of-a-kind, hand made wood, steel and glass four-hit bong
engraved with a small skull symbol that has two crossed bones
underneath.
  When viewed from one side through the other, the engraving
also serves as a hole you can flit back and forth with your
thumb or finger so that you can keep the thing stoked for the
next person or your own double-hit if no one's looking.
  Made in three classes during woodshop by Emerson Richkid
in between the napkin holder and the tiny square coffeetable, 
the four-hit bong weighs in at about 8 ounces, (or perhaps
a nickle bag if you pack it tight enough) and the bong itself
will stay in the posession of George "W" Butsch for the duration
of his one four year term. At which time a democrat will be allowed
to announce he'd never inhaled such a thing, just before the new
tradition begins of passing it back and forth between democrats
AND republicans.
  Emerson Richkid won't be allowed to market this through QVC and
the Home Shopping network for thirty days, but there will be a 
similar offering after that which is almost as good starting at
$89.95 which will be $39.95 in a year, 19.95 in two, and sitting
on shelves like a Furpy or a Tickle-Me-Barbie not selling well
at $5 after that.


AND WHILE WE'RE ON PARODY;
To the Jetsons TV theme song.


Meet John Ash-Croft! 
Yale, his life. 
Daughter Janet. (or is that his wife??) 
His boy Danforth. 
[spoken:] And the racist remark he made.

Man Charged After Comedy Confession

MACON, Ga. (AP) -- But seriously, folks: A 43-year-old man was
charged with three bank robberies after confessing on stage at 
a comedy club.
  Glenn Matthews, 43, delivered the punchline Friday night after 
joining a performer on stage at the Comedy Cafe.
  "After he got onstage, he said, 'I have something on my mind 
that I want to share with you. ... I'm the one who has been 
robbing all the banks in middle Georgia,'" club owner Mike Smith 
said.
  Smith, a former policeman, said he tried to keep the audience 
calm as he got Matthews off the stage and had staff members call 
police.
  Smith was charged Sunday with three robberies in the Macon area
between December 1999 and last week. In each case, witnesses said 
the robber was armed with a rifle and fled on a bicycle.

IN CASE YOU'RE DOUBTING THE MEDIA COVERAGE YOU'RE CONSUMING OUT THERE
Here's a guy nicknamed [freedom] with a scene report from around and 
about the Pennsylvania Avenue Kinkos this afternoon, Jan 20, 2001 in 
the year of our New President Select. Mr. George "Dubbingself" Bush.

[18:35] *** freedom (____@_________.net) has joined #_______
 hi freedom!
 ________ hey
 you missed it
 you would have loved this
 fv<king insane
 only a few arrests all day
 the black bloc was so solid
 [__] yeah, we heard 15-20
 like
 you should have seen
 the police just beat and cornered all of the bloc
 like 200+
 half of them broke police lines
 and ran
 [__]awesome
 it was amazing
 then this other march (less radical) showed up with thousands 
 of people and surrounded the police who were holding the bloc
 and they had to let everyone go
 it was great
 [__] Like Turtles and Teamsters
 [__] yeah....i heard about that, that was probably the 
 [__] best part 
 totally
 [__] it is about time the less radical people started 
 [__] supporting the radicals
 it was like utter defeat for the cops
 [_ATI_] hehehe the turtles and the teamsters, sounds 
 [_ATI_] like a david rovics song.
 it was crazy
 the bloc held the streets for a while before the police 
 cracked down
 [__] how many blocers were there?
 between 300 and 500
 they were so bold
 [__] imc link says 500
 [18:40] several times they charged the cops trying to 
 [18:40] help the captured
 [__] the mainstream media made a point of only showing 
 [__] tiny groups of protestors
 heh
 it was amazing how many people showed up in support of the 
 black bloc many thousands
 [__] A real rejection of the police's stand.
 and just when things got tense there would be another march 
 of a couple hundred to show up and support the others
 [__] "Protests: Threat to Security? or the Voice of Democracy?"
 someone threw a rock through the window of the army recruitment 
 center
 [__] wooo
 [__] important to counter the mainstream medias claims
 and a paint bomb at the washington post
 [_ATI_] I wanna know more about the "mass unarrests," [freedom]!
 [__] "mass un-arrest" ... gotta luv it.
 there was like this large building with tons of anarchists 
 [__] "We the people hereby declare you to be un-arrested."
 and they were pinned there by lines of riot cops
 [__] cut off?
 but this large march came in right behind the riot cops
 opening up the bloc to leave
 i got it on vide tape :)
 video
 what window?
 what did they say?
 i couldn't figure out who broke it or why it was broken
 but when i video taped it the lady inside 
 the building (maybe a hotel or corporate office) flipped 
 me off
 gave me the middle figer
 finger
 ?
 apparently some bloc went to the city archives
 took down the US flags, burned them
 [__] it wasn't the city archives
 and hoisted the black and black & red flags
 [__] it was the naval something or other
 [__] I heard that they got 9 out of 10 down in one area.
 :)
 i missed that
 someone told me about it
 we got some nice footage of brutal cops today
 how was it?
 did they reclaim the streets?
 cool
 neat
 any arrests?
 dude
 [19:14] this is the best protest i've ever been to
