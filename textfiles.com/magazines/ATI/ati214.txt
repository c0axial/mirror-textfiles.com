He walks two blocks down and one block over.
Says hello AND hola to the grocery clerk.
She rings him up an RC cola. One dollar even
after tax. He gladly pays, even though it 
ought to be 35 cents or so; they've been 
locked out of advertising, competitive pricing
and even new color coordinations by the
two giants for almost a full decade now.
  He's been doing this every week for a couple
years; since issue 94 or so, actually. Why
does he do this? Is it some kind of ritual? It
must be. Otherwise it wouldn't be every single
week without fail, would it? He's even used his
last five quarters some weeks during dry months.
He's paid with a 50 when he's been in cash flow.
The same bottle of RC. He, and his RC. Why? Why
why why???
   Because I'm Prime F'Ing Anarchist that's why,
and I do this every week. Don't ask me any deeper.
I'm preparing a rant. Don't get me started. I'm
really ticked off at one particular corporate
entity right now but you won't get to hear it
here. Not yet, anyhow. I'll tell you who it IS - but
that's ALL you GET for now. I'm going to need to stew
and brew on this'n for a while. Let it foment a bit.
Don't worry, I've taken copious notes. I considered
calling it "down but not out with doctors associates."
Maybe "kicking tai-bo butt, eat eat eat!" I visioned
out a new usenet group alt.subway.sux or maybe
alt.pave.the.wheatbread.die.die.die.die.die and then
it occured to me.
  The next "Cannery Row" is just waiting to be written.
They're looking for the next George Orwell, the next
real Ralph Nader. Scraping the bottom and painting it
between purple pages for your perusal. I'm no George 
Orwell, but I'm up for the challenge. And it's not just
Flubway. They're just the particular pile of spam-corp
I'm pissed at this moment. Their immoral criminality
shows up in many other parts of the seven-dollar-per-hour
sector of the world so it wouldn't be fair to just hamslam
Doctors Associates. Especially because they waited ten 
extra years or so to become lying, chiselling, cheating,
poor-people abusing, scumgrubs. Basically they didn't 
implode until it was already the norm to do this to your
hardest working human slaveforms, carbon based. 
  If you look back, you'll see that Flubway's goal in 1990
or so was 7000 stores total by Y2K. Right before the 2000
roll over? They were looking at something near to 14000 and
climbing in the continental united states alone! Is making
a sandwich for someone who wants to buy it and eat it
important to the engine that drives their movement in
the smallprint pages of the New York Times and the Wall
Street Journal?
  It damned well should.
  It damned well isn't. 
  That's left to the 17-19 year olds that you go through -
dozens at a time - as if they were german shephards
you just live-birthed for instant sale. You've got work to 
do. Real work. You only own 3 or 4 stores. You want 10 by
next year. 20 by the year after that. 40 to sell off when 
you retire by the time you're 40.
  Sandwiches? How do you make sandwiches? Oh wait, maybe
you could send me to Milford, CT "all expenses" one of these
days so I can at least look like I really do know what the
heck I'm doing. Because some of my employees still believe
that's what we're here for. Making sandwiches.
  But you're not going to hear that all here today. Because I
don't feel like developing it yet. I really want to build this
into something scathing, effective and worthwhile. Something I
can run by my attorney to make sure it's just inches within
that fine line of current slander/libel laws (I'm only up on 
everything up to 1998 by the way) And it's going to have little
to do with Flubway, little to do with Taco Hell and even less to
do with fast food. Everything to do with temporary full time
employment. Permanent part time. The whole "we-pay-you-one-extra-
dollar-per-hour-you'll-get-down-there-and-suck-our-toes" industry.
  Corporate slavery. Economic apartheid. Who gets to wear the
cotton clothing, and who has to work their way up polyester
pants and funkycolored shirt combos. Visors versus ballcaps.
Maybe we'll call it Nametag Warz. 
  Anyhow, watch other sections of this 'Zine next week and months
following where we take on the real deal. The whole "works." All
the fixins. All that and a bag of chips. The supersize truth.
  Just one more thing you can count on here. The topics no one 
else dares utter above a whisper, or a grumble to the self.
  Get ready.
I'm prime anarchist, and you'll hear it here, [boom, boom, boom]
first.
  He bows, winks, tips his hat and promises great things.
  Throws his plastic bottle of sugar water with the caramel,
corn syrup, fructose, citric acid, carbonation and the extra
caffeine clear across the room into the target on the wall
behind the wastebasket. 
  Says, prime outa hear.

WTF?

Folks, i give this one to you.
  The only reason i went on the web was because i ultimately
believed that all of us could experience the intimacy of being
across a small table from each other.
  Surking (surfing plus lurking) the list, i've come to feel that
in some bewildering sense we are sharing some rickety table with
our elbows in each others' coat pockets.
  So, pulling all my courage together, I'm going to give you all this...
a song. My idea, when I first conceived of this lyric, was to do a Miles
Davis sort of thing... i.e. walk into the rehersal and say "listen to this
lyric.  Bo, play the beat; you all wait till the singing is done, then
come in with whatever musical idea the lyrics inspire. Doesn't matter
what it is. The beauty of it is that if we can improvise each time we do
this, set the lyrics to whatever beat the percussionist feels in his/her
gut... that each time the song will be a completely organic evolution of
it's own moment and glory."
  But the idea has gotten larger.  Why not, I say to myself, throw this
lyric out on this globe-wide table?? Why not let everyone throw their
ideas in? Why not let this marvellous web bring us as close as it can?
  So...

JONI MITCHELL'S ON THE RADIO
words by saji villoth, feb. 20, 2000

joni mitchell's on the radio
as we leave another bright and naked city
to the sounds of her piano

white fields, deep in the snow
the motion on the road is quiet, i doze
she's singing about a love abandoned
I'm thinking about you
        are you the flame and oil of my yearning?
        and the lamp black only the sounds of the phone
        ringing in an empty hall?

we change the sugar of charity
like we change the words of cruelty
that taste so sweet to the tongue

we change the song on the spinning disc
as if we know we're pinned down on some centerstage
no lines, no cues, no notion when the curtain will fall
        but up on the floorboards for a moment or two
        i was the cue and the caller and the tune
        and you were in the spotlight, timing your moves

Joni's got the voice and the words I want
If I could sound like her, touch the heart like her,
I'd still be with you

But the dial deals death to the prince of mud,
croaking like a bankrupt begging for blood
i'm crawling back into the dark, away from the top 40 trash
        you are the curved lip of the waterfall
        i am faint and falling, tied to a sack full of
stones...
        each one a pardon to be sold

        in other words, i'm no stranger to the devil (she
knows)
-----------------

CAVEATS:  I wanted circumstance to say "Bruce Cockurn's
on the radio.." but Joni was, he wasn't.
I am stealing BC's words here and there.
If you do use this, please send me a tape.
Thanks.

   AND AS THEY SAID DURING THE INQUISITION, (IN SO MANY
WORDS...) LET THE SCAPEGOATING OF HACKERS BEGIN.
[PAWN] New Hampshire - 17 year old Dennis F. Moran denies
that he is being scapegoated in a "let's-get-a-couple-

  MILWAUKEE - (reprinted from AP by PA) - A federal judge
sentenced an Aswaubenon man to six months in prison Wednesday
for hacking into the U.S. Army's Web site.
  US District Judge _______ _________ also ordered _______
_______ , 20, to pay $8,054 in restitution to the army for
the cost of restoring the site.
  The army asked for about $20,000 restitution to pay for
a new computer system and security for the internet site.
  Before hearing his sentence, _______ said he was working
at a sandwich shop in Green Bay and planned to go back to
school. 
  "I haven't touched a computer in nine months," he said
before receiving his sentence.
  Through her tears, ____' mother, ___ told the judge of
her son's potential.
  "____ has great potential in this society," she said.
"And I ask the court to save this young life."

He changed the sig page to say "Global Hell" which is
the hackergroup he belongs to and he's now been ordered
to have no contact with anyone in that group, and he'll
have to gain approval from future employers to use the
internet.]

ABOUT THOSE YAHOO/CNN HACKS
   by |<ondrak  [special to ATI]

 Actually (IMO) the DDOS attack looked rather minor and 
non-noteworthy other than for the names of the players
who were hit. We (users of the Internet) have suffered
such attacks for years, since the software has been
available.
  You MUST realize the media who are reporting this
stuff are clueless when it comes to technology, they
rabidly repeat what the TLA's tell them to say without
question, and thus wind up with "hoof-in-mouth" syndrome
every time they report. Since the majority of us, here,
are light years ahead of the GDP on technology issues,
every time the media swine grunt out this crap, we lean
back, roll our eyes skyward, and say something similar to,
"oh they fucked that one up again." The problem IS, the
lapdog media do NOT want to report the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, not even a balanced
report containing ALL sides of the issues. The media
are not in the business of reporting the news, they insist
that they MAKE the news, when in reality they are a subservient
propaganda machine intended to control the population thru lies
distortion and selective reporting. The obvious leftist/socialist
leanings of the press should be as obvious as daylight by now to
anyone who's blood is above room temperature. This is an OBVIOUS
attempt at public manipulation from the spin the press is putting
on the issue.
  A few worthless e-commerce sites doesn't justify the noise this
one is making. No kiddies, this is the first volley fired in the
Info-War that big brother is about to wage to bring the Internet
under totalitarian-police-state control in the model of SWORM or
Commie China.
  There is simply too much of that gosh-durned freedom going on,
and the jackbooted thugs need someone to beat on to scare the
sheeple back into submission.
  They didn't like Seattle, they don't like people telling the
truth, and they dammed well don't like the idea that the government
propaganda can be so easily defeated by the likes of some kid with
a simple piece of software and some time to poke around the internet.
  Nosiree...you're witness to the first shots fired in the war...things
have got to get worse before people will willingly give up their
freedom to big brother, so I'm sure things will get worse.
  They did talk to people who have a clue. Space Rouge, Winn Schwartu
are 2 that come to mind right away. The problem is not being able
to _write_ a DOS program. The problem is (and I must say its a valid
one) is the ability to protect a multi-node distributed network
system against a distributed DOS attack. If you can come up with
a packaged solution for that, then you're gold, baby. Take it to
the market and watch the cash build!

   THE TWO MONTH OLD STRIPMALL
      a poem by Cow Sumer

Sweep the sidewalk, up comes the top layer
Of concrete in flakes the size of
Half dollars.
Break down boxes to take out "dumpsterward."

The cast iron clasp is holding up fine,
Except it sits on the ground in the
Pallet-wood,
They used instead of 1 by 4's which shredded off.
