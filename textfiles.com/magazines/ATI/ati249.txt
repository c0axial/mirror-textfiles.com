  "You don't need a weather man 
To know which way the wind blows."
  "you can call me timmy, or you can
Call me zimmy." 

[part of rant?] {what's not???}

I'm so glad MTV, GE, NBC et al spent so many hundreds 
of millions putting on their "snooze or blues" campaign 
this year, or we all wouldn't have seen that 1.7 percent
increase in voter turnout.
  I've got it. Let's skip the electoral process 
altogether, and anyone who thinks they're worthy 
can put an attorney on rider and sue for the
position.
  Joan Kennedy pleads guilty to DUI??? It's about time.
Take a note: no longer need to drive Route 1 instead
of I-95.
  Oh, hi. I'm prime anarchist, editor and publisher of
this strange little ranticle we call a 'zine. How're
YOU doin? That's mighty imporant right now, isn't?
For after all, if you've got your health you've got
everything. And if you're an american and your last
name isn't a four-letter word, chances are good that's
about all you've got.
  Anarchy, Music and Poetry is what we're about mostly.
But as you already know, I'm sure, we're completely
reader driven so submissions come first, eh?

to ati:
Great election guys.  
  You play for five days and it ends up a draw.
  We have something like that in England.
It's called cricket. (You didn't really think 
I could let this one go by, now did you?)
--Patrick W

to marco:
I'd love to start a national movement that EVERYONE, 
EVERYONE not vote until 6:30 at night in their prospective 
time zones.  It would be called the ADV, or After Dinner 
Vote, and would become the new voter bloc of the public.
  Pretty funny huh??

Hi,
A. EARN SUBSTANTIAL CASH VIA YOUR WEBSITE OR EZINE
  Our website, www.far2far.com, IS DIFFERENT : it pays 
you substantial cash when you refer users who buy from 
our site - 
and this could become one of the biggest money spinners 
for your site or ezine.

Hi Marc.
Maybe an adition to 249

read and judge yourself.
If you allready saw it before.. then just forget this.

[ed note: Some of the phollowin LETTUCE is late for the 
election, because of our weekly deadline, or is it?]
>  What kind of hairbrained, head-up-his-ass, moron came up with
>this one...
I missed that one.  Sounds like a barn burner.  
And is this issue [ati248.txt] weird or what.

Lets see:
A screaming lactator (whom I don't disagree with),  
a visit from some dead guy in a three cornered hat 
that probably had just killed his fair share of
those red savages to expand his land,  and is 
still daring someone, anyone, to pry that gun 
out of his cold stiff fingers    plus,

a suckup report on Elvis Costello doing "Rock girls 
in Space" for the awesome???? WB?

Whoof!  Double Whoof!!!

Prediction for tommorrow:

George Bush will win and win big.

...other predictions:
  The titanic will rise and be renamed Challenger before it 
heads off on its maiden voyage to the Gulf of Yemen.
  The Hindenberg 2 will float again, only to be destroyed by 
those right wing Nazi bastards over NYC this time as they 
try to take out Clinton's final meeting with any and all 
black leaders at the UN.
  And Vietnam will actually declare that we won the war and 
communism is a failure in exchange for 3 cartons of Marlboro's 
and a years supply of Spagettio's
  Hey - I could be wrong.

Hey,
What's up w/this? Are you really interested in my writing 
a piece for you? If you are, just send me a list of a few 
possible topics & I may or my not write something on or 
off topic for you. 
  I realize that there's most likely not any money in this, 
but that doesn't matter that much to me; I'm just a bored 
kid w/a few minutes to kill, and that's never paid well.
  I'm sorry that I took so long to respond; I was not and 
am not sure whether you were serious in the message to 
which I am responding, but I've decided to find out.
  With bated breath,

   POST ELECTION CANDIDATE'S STATEMENT
   I am reflecting upon last Tuesday's election results, 
   and upon the previous two years of the Hippie for Congress 
   Campaign. I am honored and proud to have been a write-in 
   candidate for election to the 16th U.S. Congressional District.
   I respectfully concede the election to my opponent, Donald
   Manzullo. May he govern with wisdom, compassion, and justice. 
   My heart and mind are spinning with an intense storm of hopeful,
   discouraging, and often confusing and conflicting thoughts and 
   feelings. 
     Surrounded by this emotional tempest, I find myself drawn again 
   and again back to one particular thought: It was worth it.
     The official totals of write-in votes for Martin Hippie are so 
   low as to be profound. Twenty one votes in Jo Daviess county, 
   fourteen in Stephenson, thirty three in the City of Rockford, 
   six in Winnebago, four in Ogle, zero in Boone, and an unknown 
   amount (they're still counting?) in McHenry. 
     Somehow these election results just don't match up with the 
   people I met and the reality I encountered as I walked the 16th 
   District. I'm not claiming ballot fraud, I'm filing a mass 
   missing persons report. Where are those thousands of people 
   honking horns and waving as I walked down the road? Where are 
   the hundreds of indignant, concerned citizens who told me they
   want to take back their government? Where are the disenfranchised,
   the disgruntled, the seriously pissed-off? They weren't at the polls.

PAGE 3 CORRECTION (buried deep like the other papes:)
The parody in ATI 248 was not written by the whole
group which was implied when the byline was left
out of the final broadcast copy of the zine.
Merritt Bussiere wrote it.
  If you keep this issue anywhere, please consider pasting
the correct copy onto the oversight, ok?

YAKMYTH: A Watcher's Guide To C-Span's
Homer-Odyssey Booktalk Session Oct 2000
  by Pomerika

Odyseuss,The king of Ithaka.
Kris Hitchens on hubris and nemesis.
Insists that Homer was a real man
who stood on some of the same rocks
that he did at times.

jeez, CSpan. Asking Hitchens if he thinks
the book is relevant to today, is like
asking him if his car will die in the
next 300,000 miles without an oil-change.

Yes, there are two other people yakking,
but I mostly focus today on Homer, the
C-Span interviewer and Mr. Hitchens.
Why? Because I think K(c)ris is more
(while at the same time less) profound
than he always sees himself.

Dead At Sea. C'mon people. Let's discuss
this year's 23 russian sailors buried alive
in the submersible coffin, ok?

Across the Aegean sea, around the cape.
Real geography as opposed to parageography.

Don't go there please!

"Unacknowleged Legislation," is going to be
Hitchens' newest this January on the VERSO
label.

Stanley Lombardo and his drum. Turn your eye
away. Focus not on him or his drum, just on
the greek.

J. Bottum slams Lombardo's translation a second 
time. Does he dis the book or Lombardo himself?

Oh, telephone questions soon. Thank you, Athena!

booktv@c-span.org

There goes Lombardo again.
English this time, neat. I really wish he'd
use a kickdrum or a foot on a hardwood floor
instead of using his "post modern shamanic" 
drum. The guy truly lacks rhythm.

Bottum with another dis. "It's great stuff,
but..."

ventriloquizing. catharsis. pity. terror.
Christopher Hitchens with a bottle of springwater
between his legs, a parallel translation
on his lap, and 4-inch moptop hair just over
his left eyebrow.

Did you ever wonder why AOL picks the A and the
eye on the pyramid for their mythos? Lombardo,
why did you pick the "world flag" earth.gif for
your coverpic?

Agamemnon praises Penelope. Men will make songs
about her. Alludes to Feminist interpretations
of Odyssey.

 /odysseus - dr suess/
(hmm...)

"Fear, dread, humiliation - a very religious text."
  - Hitchens

How does one live their life when the war is over?
Your father was of great reknown.

Not in combat, but in warzones. [Hitchens] Remember
thinking, well this is what it's like then.

"No one left to lie to: the values of the worst family"
   Hitchen's most recent year, I mean book.

http://www.versobooks.com

"this long hexameter line" Bottum's biggest problem
is he's trying so hard to have Hitchens' hair.

Yeah, Debra Dickerson. Put him back in his place.
Monkeying around. Don't touch Dickens. This new
book helps me want to go back to the original.

So this whole discussion is not to grasp Homer
and whether the Toyota Odyssey has Firestone
tires at all. It's about telling us to buy this
new book! Tele-spam!!! A C-SpanoMercial.

On the way back to Ithaca, why are they fighting?
Just because there's people there. They're "drunk."

Civilians are in as much danger as soldiers as shown
in this book.

Athena and Poseidon. Feminine :  Masculine.
Or at times M:F.

Athena tells Telemakkus don't make your mother
remarry, dowries suck.

Is cunning a virtue? Odysseus is an inveterate lier.
Does he have to tell these lies? Talking to dad in
the pasture. Should I tell him straight out? Or lie?
He seems to be enjoying giving the old man a big
long "line."

Telling a good lie, that's just great. All Cretins are
liars, so saith the people in Crete. Does he have to
kill all 108 of the suitors?

Ruthlessness, cruelty, what about all of that? Does a hero
have to be an entirely virtuous character or can he be
a "real people."

Patience, endurance, intelligence, commitment, you need
all of these to be called virtuous. Always willing to
expose himself courageously. OK, I'll challenge you to
some games. Pushing the envelope.

Nikos Kazantzakos. Finally you mention him. It took
one of Lombardo's living heros to call on the phone
[didn't hear the name - he published another recent
"Iliad and Odyssey."] before he'd whip out Nikos.
I watched his adams apple go up and down when the
caller complained about his rhetoric, and which
version of greek he picked.

Q: What part of the odyssey turns your students on?
Cyclops, The Sirens, the domestic side of the story.
The suitors, the wife, will she recognize him?

Q: You picked D-Day for your Iliad. Why?
Editor and myself both wanted to stay away from
anything "too classical."

"Normandy launched a thousand ships," said hitchens

Hitchens discussed being a tourist in Athens in 1974:
  This crowd was chanting something and I tried to
join in, I didn't know what it was til after.
Catharsis, cathar-sis cathar sis.

12 ships each with a crew of 20 or 30 men during
the trojan war. Tried to bring them all back home
safely. Unable to.

They were destroyed by their own recklessness.

\So many US Marines raping/
 \japanese teens lately? /
  \  my thought again   /

   [a tongue speaking episcopalian
   phone call attacking hitchens
   AND the classics ignored here.]

Debra Dickerson: I went to Greece on my honeymoon.
Like it or not it's part of us. Delphi, dead white
men, who needs it, but you cannot look at the
Parthenon and not be moved. There's no reason you
can't know this and not know other things too.
                
The best poet who ever lived, bottums quoting
lombardo about homer.

If you have to ask, poetry won't mean anything to
you. As soon as you've asked the question, you've
already lost.

\U shoulda mentioned  Clinton/
 \not bringing back his poet/
  \for the second inaug... /

Is Odysseus just to kill all 108? Yes the
suitors were wrong, but was Odysseus right?

the real reason to read a poem is Homer's mind.
Quotes Arnold, "he saw life steadily and he
saw it (hold? whole?)"

the human condition.
the very deep, wide, the clear.

Luck and Virtue - Bottums says they're unrelated
\define hubris\
 \then, d00d.  \
Odysseus doesn't have free will, I (hitchens)
wish you would've touched on this.

Scapegoating, I'm glad Hitchens brings this up.
Funny it would be in defense of Bottums saying
if you aren't Christian, you wouldn't understand
the Prodigal son.

:Try living in Chiapas, Colombia, Australia or  :
:the Hopi reservation, Bottums. There are people:
:behaving 10 times more X-Tian there than you'll:
:ever behave, sorry to say...

homeric - heroic

mysterious woman, mysterious woman.

nostos - home.

winedark sea
rosey fingers

Chapman's Homer as celebrated by Keats

And Pope's.

I thoroughly enjoyed this. I only regret
they never had an exhausting discussion
of Elpinore.

You could view any of the current presidential
candidates in light of Elpinore, couldn't you?
Or any past ones, for that one. Dan Quayle, for
sure.

For more about myth and metaphor, you can check
out the James Merrill school of metaforics, or
read Carl Franklin's treatise on Joseph Campbell.
What you do after that is anyone's guess...

"THERE ARE MANY PROBLEMS WITH OUR CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM"
  The President's veto of legislation to criminalize 
unauthorized disclosures of classified information could 
become the most momentous development in government secrecy 
policy since the 1995 executive order on classified information.  
It is already prompting renewed questions about the workings
of the secrecy system.
  This afternoon, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon bluntly 
acknowledged that the classification system does not function 
satisfactorily.
  "[The President] alluded to the fact that there can be 
over-classification or mis-classification," Mr. Bacon noted.  
  "I don't think anybody disagrees with that. There are many 
problems with our classification system.  And it was that 
realization, in part, that led to his decision to ... veto 
the bill."
