I just wanted to let you know that Jen no longer 
works at the Boston AIDS Consortium. All of her 
mail is now forwarded to me instead. Jen now works
for the Mass. Bar Foundation so you could look her 
up there. Please remove ...@...org from your 
address book. Thank you...

I read this in a newspaper today. It's the funniest shit 
I've heard in awhile, and I don't even smoke pot.
Keep Your Children Safe
In a preaface to the anti drug pamphlet, 
"How Parents Can Help Children Live
Marijuana Free," Senator Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, 
writes that our,"morally deprived society....has chosen 
to embrace, rather than attack, this plague" of marijuana.
    The Pamphlet-written by University of Utah criminologist 
Gerald Smith, cited in the Washington Post-
goes on to list warning signs for parents of children who 
may be using marijuana: A teenager who "avoids the family 
while at home" may be a kid at risk; watch out, too for 
"interest in Ras Tafari religion"; most insidous of all is 
"excessive preoccupation with social causes, race relations, 
environmental issues, etc."

To ATI:
it was interesting, just a little long, 
I was curious because it obviously
wasn't spam but I didn't recognise 
any of the addresses in the headers.
good luck with it all...

   Did you know that the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank
System uses a pyramid scheme (Fractional Reserve
Accounts) that will collapse EVEN IF NO EQUIPMENT
FAILS if many depositors withdraw money as a
precaution?
   Did you know that PRECAUTIONARY STOCKPILING of food,
fuel, MEDICINES, etc., will cause shortages and big

From: Ian G
To: Marco Capelli:
Just got another threatening message from "XTU Project," despite
my silence on TWA 800. In the first XTU-message I was told:
  You've made some people very angry.  It's my job to keep
  watch of people like you... With communications cut and
  ability crippled it's hard to reach out and touch someone.
The address of XTU then was with hotmail.com. They closed that
address after the threat and yet refused to release anything on
his/her identity. The source ISP refused to even respond to my
requests.  The only other link to the identity of this "XTU
Project" is a post made under that name at this page:
http://www.anionline.com/MailBag/3-9-98.html
Despite claims by "antionline.com" to be pro-free-speech, they
also would not respond to my requests for information about the
identity of this person that HAS assisted is the suppression of
my free speech and threats against me. The message at the site
cited indicates that the owners of the site know who XTU is.
There were recently several attempts to lure me into property
owned by a group known as "The Finders," which many claim to
be a CIA front.
The following is the latest threatening email from XTU Project:

Re: Damage Reduction
My Dearest Marco,
        It gives me great pain to tell you that they intercepted
many of our emails, including the hot ones. Please destroy all
the .jpg's of you, me and Johnny Chung doing the nasty.
        I'm more worried honey, about those pictures that display
your finger in my you-know-what and your you-know-what in Mr. Chung's
ear, than I am about even the texts showing Mr. Clinton vetting
with the Chinese. 
        Or even Newt Gingrich vetting his Republican Dairy Aire off.
But Please destroy those as soon as you can, ok?
        And for Yikes-sakes, Marco - stop wearing my panties on
your head during your anti-NAFTA press conferences four to eight
times a week.
        They're dragging all of Bill and Hillary's criminal friends
into court today - and tomorrow they want me to discuss all your hot
emails.
        Marco, my love, I think they know about the times you and
I did the nasty in the west wing of the Oval Office while we let
all those Chinese tourists take photographs. Any idea if Chelsea
was there with her Sony cam-corder? I think that's the only way 
the GOP could've found out.
        This morning Chelsea's going to talk about that time in
LittleRock with you me and her in the bushes when she was 11. Swear
to me Marco, you'll deny it all. You weren't the ONLY one who was
old enough to go to jail for that, I was 21.
        I'm going to testify that Chelsea's a nympho with a humongous
fantasy life in her head and that you and I had nothing to do with it.
        Marco, what if they find out you're not an anarchist? What
if they find out you're Chinese, bald, a Tibetan buddhist nun and
married to me and my mom? Marc, what if they already know about you
me and Mr. Clinton diddling all those Chinese college students in
1989 in the American Embassy??
        What'll we do Marco? I love you.
        I love you, Marco. Please get rid of that stuff right away.
And destroy this email as soon as you've read it. If they find this
we're absolutely screwed.
        "All my lovin',"
        Brookie Wookie.
PS: Oh my god, Marco. It just occurred to me. What if they find out
about Johnny Chung, Connie Chung and the Jello Brand (tm) Chinese
Communist Naval Masturbation defense fund???

              PAGE 3  ---------  CORRECTION:
              ------------------------------
  Since Jean Guisnel, author of "CYBERWARS: Espionage On 
  The Internet." probably won't care enough to update 
  the next printing, we'll print his correction here:
  On page 122 of "Cyber..." regarding Emmanuel Goldstein's
  magazine 2600: ( http://www.2600.com )  "why this
  number?" he writes, "because that was the exact frequency
  that a quarter made while tumbling into a payphone during 
  the hacking ice age. Captain Crunch, a hacker precursor, had
  made that little discovery that..."
     The line about the quarter tumbling SHOULD have read:
  "... that was the approximate frequency which siezed a 
  trunk line; allowing for a phree fone call."
     Were Guisnel a proper historian, perchance he would have 
  done a keyword search for "red box" and "blue box" before     
  clicking a pen.

SAILORS SHIELDING THEIR EYES DURING 
    ATOMIC BOMB TEST, BIKINI, 1947 
               by John Bradley

Light,
unbearable
light

Is what moves 
your head 
into the crook of your arm,
slides your other arm
across your chest
in a tight
half-embrace.

Face buried, eyes 
shut, you can see
someone in white,
years from now,
with a knife too sharp
to feel, slicing 
along your testicles.

Will the seed 
you carry be able to spawn
a child 
impervious to the might 
you witnessed, back
at Bikini?

Or did the flash
bloom a cancer 
there in the darkness 
of your scrotum?

You strain to hear
the words of the doctor --
It's a blessing,
he tells you. Or does he say --
it's for the best?

You press your head
deeper 
into the crook of your arm.
