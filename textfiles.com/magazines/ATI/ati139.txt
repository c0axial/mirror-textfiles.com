   ===========================

    Hello there, and thank you for turning on to ATI, Activist 
Trollopping Illipops. I'm your host Anarchist Prime and you
can bet your bippie we've got some really good store in
stuff 4 U.
    Embassies are getting bombed right and left; ok, right and
right. And Monika Lewinski's overbite is much worse than her
bark. Roadrunner plans his speech at a giganticus roundtable, while
events begin to speak for themselves unfoldingly.
    The world is revolving and so is your credit. Your stock is 
suddenly worth about half a sandwich at a yardsale; and everyone's
singing "Happy Dayz" while the Noble Experiment begins its ascent
into the philosophical toilet of life, just 222 years after it 
was born.
    Some say Los Estados Unidos (the great USA) had only minutes to
spare after USSR collapsed, before it's own likely-demise-hood. I say
the coup began in October of 1979!!! Many say "What year was the
CIA founded???"
    And Hitler got his 17 year old neice pregnant; and because she 
refused to get an abortion, he killed not only her, her baby, 
Hamlet, MacBeth, Romeo AND Raul Julia, but 11 million other humanoids
as well. Has he stopped yet?
    I think he lives in Argentina or CHIAPAS.
    By the way, feel free to forward ATI's to anyone who you think
might like them. We are publicly dominant in our entirely.

Fantasy about a female specialist.
Until she gets right next to me I can't tell if she's male or female;
officer or enlisted.
   She's a lieutenant, oops, snap.
   "Don't you salute officers?" I turn to her, render customs and
courtesies, and say, "I'm terribly sorry sir, I have trouble seeing
in the dark."

We end this missive with poetry as per usual.
Did somebody say McDonalds?

The fries, the fries.
"This could be an ad,"
Says a clerk in an elevator on his way back 
To work from "lunch break."
Is he required to eat what
He buys in the breakroom?
Even if he gets it 
Elsewhere?
He and his friend have 
Bags of "McDonalds." 
You can smell it all over the elevator.
Smelibator.
There's something unique about
Those fries.


GUAC... a poem by the prime anarchist

   Cilantro
I want you the most.
Your green eyes.
Your tangy lips.
The slightly sweet sting.
   Quiero
No not a sting-
A tingle
I kiss your tangy
Tingly lips.
   Tomato
I must be a tomatoe or
An onion.
   Because you and me -
mmm...
