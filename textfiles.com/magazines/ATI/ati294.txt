"Oh Bush said to CheneyPowell, "Kill me a son"...

Hi, I'm Prime Anarchist, and you MUST consider THIS:
  Lately I've heard a lot of reactionary people telling me
that we need to bomb USAma Bin "Heavy" Laden to smithereens
because "That's the only thing these people know."
  No, I beg to differ. There is no large weapon, including
the Kalish 47 that we didn't help them get two decades ago.
You wanna score "these people" with the only thing they know? 
Hmmm. I'm rakkin' my brain here; I know. Let's fill a rented 
Ryder truck with mooshed up fermented fertilizer and slam the
bugger into Bin Laden's mom's house. 
  Volunteer(s)? 
  Raise your hand(s).

  I -- didn't -- think -- so.

       Some of this 'zine was written before "WAR ON TERRORISM"
became "WAR ON HUMANBEINGS" Sunday. We thought about editing,
shortening or content shifting but quickly thought better of it.
You would want honest stuff right from the heart and right from
the head, so we edited for grammar and spelling only. We just 
thought you should know that.
       Oh! One other thing. We considered publishing what we had
of this Sunday night; wrestled with that idea for almost two
full days. That's why we're "running late," in case you're 
curious.
       OK George?

OPEN LETTER TO GENERAL HONORABLE H. SHELTON:

Nice black beret you've got on your cleanshaven head 
there. It goes nice with all your shiny aluminum medals.
  Makes you look awkward as sin though. You appear as if
your wife or your Korean geisha girl coached you in front
of a mirror for four hours on how to cant it and how to
carry yourself wearing it; but you still can't get used
to it on your head yet.
  Do they iron on all your patches and starch your shirts
for you too? Or are you able to do that part on your own?
  I'll bet you think that makes you really elite, don't
you? Truth be told you're still the same incompetent dweeb
of a leftenant-fresh-out-of-collegiate-mini-bootcamp you've
always been, despite the 2, 3, and 4 star pajamas they let 
you gather up as you go along your upper middle class white 
man's gauntlet.

DID THE BLACKLIST NEVER DIE: Ronnie Gilbert On Repression's New Wave

Dear Editor:

I respectfully submit the following opinion for your consideration. 
Thank you for reading it. 

Very truly yours, 
Ronnie Gilbert (with Marcia Freedman)

For the second time in my life - at least - a group that I belong to is
being investigated by the FBI. The first was the Weavers. The Weavers were
a recording industry phenomenon. In 1950 we recorded a couple of songs from
our American/World folk music repertoire, Leadbelly's "Goodnight Irene" and
(ironically) the Israeli "Tzena, Tzena, Tzena" and sold millions of records
for the almost-defunct record label. Folk music entered the mainstream, and
the Weavers were stars. By 1952 it was over. The record company dropped us,
eager television producers stopped knocking on our door. The Weavers were
on a private yet well-publicized roster of suspected entertainment industry
reds. The FBI came a-calling. This week, I just found out that Women in
Black, another group of peace activists I belong to, is the subject of an
FBI investigation.

Women in Black is a loosely knit international network of women who vigil
against violence, often silently, each group autonomous, each group focused
on the particular problems of personal and state violence in its part of
the world. Because my group is composed mostly of Jewish women, we focus on
the Middle East, protesting the cycle of violence and revenge in Israel and
the Palestinian Territories. The FBI is threatening my group with a Grand
jury investigation. Of what? That we publicly call the Israeli military's
occupation of the mandated Palestine lands illegal? So does the World Court
and the United Nations. That destroying hundreds of thousands of the
Palestinians' olive and fruit trees, blocking roads and demolishing homes
promotes hatred and terrorism in the Middle East? Even President Bush and 
Colin Powell have gotten around to saying so. So what is to investigate? 
That some of us are in contact with activist Palestinian peace groups? This 
is bad?

The Jewish Women in Black of Jerusalem have stood vigil every Friday for 13
years in protest against the Occupation; Muslim women from Palestinian peace 
groups stand with them at every opportunity. We praise and honor them, these 
Jewish and Arab women who endure hatred and frequent abuse from extremists 
on both sides for what they do. We are not alone in our admiration. Jerusalem 
Women in Black is a nominee for the 2001 Nobel Peace Prize, along with the 
Bosnia Women in Black, now ten years old.

If the FBI cannot or will not distinguish between groups who collude in
hatred and terrorism, and peace activists who struggle in the full light of
day against all forms of terrorism, we are in serious trouble. I have seen
such trouble before in my lifetime. It was called McCarthyism. In the hysterical 
atmosphere of the early Cold War, anyone who had signed a peace petition, who 
had joined an organization opposing violence or racism or had tried to raise 
money for the refugee children of the Spanish Civil War, in other words who 
had openly advocated what was not popular at the time, was fair game.

In my case, the FBI visited The Weavers' booking agent, the recording
company, my neighbors, my dentist husband's patients, my friends. In the
waning of our career, the Weavers were followed down the street, accosted
onstage by drunken "patriots," warned by friendly hotel employees to keep
the door open if we rehearsed in anyone's room so as not to become targets
for the vice squad. It was nasty. Every two-bit local wannabe G-man joined
the dragnet searching out and identifying "communist spies." In all those
self-debasing years how many spies were pulled in by that dragnet? Nary a
one. Instead it pulled down thousands of teachers, union members, scientists, 
journalists, actors, entertainers like us, who saw our lives disrupted, our 
jobs, careers go down the drain, our standing in the community lost, even 
our children harrassed.  A scared population soon shut their mouths up tight.

Thus came the silence of the 1950s and early 60s, when no notable voice of
reason was heard to say,  "Hey, wait a minute. Look what we're doing to
ourselves, to the land of the free and the home of the brave," when not one
dissenting intelligence was allowed a public voice to warn against zealous
foreign policies we'd later come to regret, would be regretting now, if our
leaders were honest. Today, in the wake of the worst hate crime of the 
millenium, a dragnet is out for "terroriststs" and we are told that certain 
civil liberties may have to be curtailed for our own security. Which ones? 
I'm curious to know.

The First Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech or of the press? The
right of people peaceably to assemble? Suddenly, deja vu - haven't I been
here before? Hysterical neo-McCarthyism does not equal security, never
will. The bitter lesson September 11's horrific tragedy should have taught
us and our government is that only an honest re-evaluation of our foreign
policies and careful, focused and intelligent intelligence work can hope to
combat operations like the one that robbed  all of us and their families of
6,000 decent working people. We owe the dead that, at least. As for Women in
Black, we intend to keep on keeping on.



CONSIDER THIS:

If (and I do mean  " I F " ) the anthraxing in Florida was
in fact, "NBC" (short for military guerrilla style Nuke-Bio-
Chemlawn warfare, let's get in the perpetrators mind for a
second.
  Hmmm. If you've ever cleared a gas mask and worn an NBC
suit for any time, you'll agree "it's easy if you try..."
  "I know," says Ahmed North in focus group, "Let's hit the
L.A. Expressway during rush hour. The people in the diamond
lane will give it to everyone around them."
  "No. Better," says Muhamet Hull, "The Rio Grande. People
swimming back from bean picking season will spread it all
over Mexico and help us by hitting Washington the very next
spring. Double whammy."
  "No way! I've got it. Ready for this?" says Omar Akbar
"Poindexter" Reagan, "let's hit the National Enquirer's
offices. They will tell the entire world and no one will
believe them."



WHAT'S NEXT: "Terrorist Aid???"

I'm borrowing these four paragraphs here for you
from this morning's London Times mostly to show 
how outlandish things have become in the Untied States. 

What's next, Bob Hope, Lorne Michaels, Natalie Portman and 
Britney Spears for a "We Are The Survivors" extravaganza out 
of Madison Square Garden?


NEW YORK CITY officials have told celebrities to stay away from 
the rescue efforts at the World Trade Centre after a parade of 
well-known personalities brought work to a halt while they were 
shown around. 
  Permission to be allowed through the site’s strict security 
to see the devastation has become the hottest ticket in town. 
Those running the recovery effort say that it is time to stop 
the gawping.
  Among the celebrities who have come to Lower Manhattan to 
see the ruins of the Twin Towers are the former boxing champion 
Muhammad Ali, the singer Bette Midler, the Sopranos actor James 
Gandolfini, the boxing promoter Don King, members of the Yankees 
and Mets baseball teams, the new Miss America Katie Harman, the 
comedian Chevy Chase, and the actors Billy and Alec Baldwin and 
Candice Bergen.
  Some celebrities have been invited; others have talked their 
way on to the site. It is a test of a person’s celebrity to see 
how far through the security cordons they can go before being 
turned back.

This is a parody of the first verse to the Star Mangled Spanner.

Oh say can you sing it, If you could I'd be amazed
Because almost no one can, unless they warm up for-an-hour-or-more
When Kate Smith or Garth Brooks, memorized it for a night
And the teleprompters, are so shining so bright...ly
And the people move their lips, and stand tall and pretend
Giving proof to all comers that they're loyal til the end
O say, do you wish that there was a better way
To show how proud you are, to be from the U. S. A.

YSMAEL Y ISAAC VA A ÓPERA

Three things I really liked about last Wednesday night's
West Wing despite their shallow, and seemingly censor-cleared
tele-play.

A review, by marco


"Sorkin's strength is dialogue, not staging. He is 
fascinated not by loud bangs and big booms, but by 
the rhythm of the spoken word."
  --John Levesque, Seattle Post


1) SAT styled analogy. 
Fundamentalist is to Islamic as  _b_l_a_n_k_  is to Christian.

2) Compare and contrast; Martyr to Hero.

3) "Something happening here..." at end of soundtrack.

Overall I thought Wednesday's WestWing-sponsored tele-play
entitled "Isaac and Ishmael" was quite good. They brought up
many more questions (and good ones at that) than answers which
is exactly what we all feel these days, huh?
  But here's what I found could have been much stronger.
  The blank of the brilliant analogy was filled in with simply
"KKK." Now that gets us in the ballpark, but doesn't even come
close to hitting a SammySosa homer. You ready? I can hit the 
top of the fence. It's up to God to do the rest I'm afraid. Or
someone in the stands maybe. If they'd said "KKK plus mafia 
plus Timothy McVeigh divided by three," that would've hit home
the way we need and want it to.
  I know no one in the mainstream ready to hear what I'm about
to say, and it's probably only that which made this comparison
shallow. I somehow doubt this one failed to get through the 
Pentagon censors, but I wouldn't rule that out in a time such
as this. The comparison between a martyr and a hero. Oh boy.
They have President Bartlet saying a martyr dies for his cause
but ramming a plane into a building killing himself and so many
others isn't a martyr it's an [did he say?] idiot. [I forgot all
the invectives he used. Something like "moronic, dweeb loser
dork of a stupid idiot" or something.] Then he took us to where
I think shallowness lay. "A hero will die for his cause and he
will kill for it, but he'd rather live for it."
  Ummm. Talk about watering down Gandhi! A hero will die for 
his or her cause, but s/he will NOT kill for it. But like I said
we're not ready for that one. 
  Hey Martin Sheen, I know you're up on that one, maybe Sorkin
isn't, perhaps Ms. Janney isn't but boyeee. "Say it ain't so,
Joe." That must've hurt compromising THAT one in focus group,
huh?
  OK. Lastly. "...what it is, ain't exactly clear..."
  Using "Buffalo Springfield's "For What It's Worth" as the 
soundtrack's ending was pretty profound. Good. And almost just 
poetical enough for me. But I have to put this out. Dylan's 
"Masters of War," would have been 1000% better. 
  I mean it hits more directly. In fact, it even gets you 
closer to just the whole philosophy "what creates a terrorist"
if you can follow the metaphors to their logical second life
forms you'll see what I mean.

"Powell is a traitor to his own people when he masterminded 
the invasion which bombed so many black Panamanians in the
barrio of El Chorrillo. He will have to live with his 
conscience."

  --Manuel Noriega on Colin Powell as told to Peter Eisner


COKE HOPING FOR MAGIC FROM CCCC
ATLANTA - (PAWN) Harry Cox with a special report 
from Coke Newspapers
  Critics have long said Coke needs to improve its
marketing. Now the company is resorting to magic.
  Coke hopes it can get a much-needed boost through
a massive tie-in with the Cali Family and all their
sister Colombian Coffee cartels. Why? They've a new 
flik coming out sponsored by Mountain Dew, entitled 
"Do Coke," where they will be revamping their old 
highly caffeinated slogan "Do The Dew," and careful 
product placement will have lots of people saying and 
acting out "Do Coke" as well.
  Warner Bros are very excited about this.
  "Do Coke" is generally expected to be a hit when
it debuts Nov. 16. Some observers say the movie is
the kind of escapist fare that might play well in
these troubled times.
  Warner Bros' Coke deal is valued at $150 million.
  In many ways, however, it won't be a typical
promotion. There will be no Coke cans, vials or
spoons in the movie, and Coke isn't allowed to use 
any of the movie's characters in upcoming promotions.
  But red and black "Do Coke" shirts will be forced
upon the next four years worth of public highschool 
grads as prerequisite to getting a diploma.
  "Want that degree?" said high school principle
Vicente Fox, "Wanna graduate? Take a shirt."



WORTH NOTING: 

              The air-dropped foodstuffs will be most
suitable for consumption by ground troops. Not weary,
tired, refugees.



"...to congress loud and clear. It is unacceptable to
share sensitive information while our soldiers are at
risk."
  George "W" Bush. 
  Never mind that we've not in my lifetime seen a single
day where some number of soldiers weren't at risk of either
death or deniability loss! 
  I won't even go there.
  Does he think we all have NO MEMORY???
Is anyone old enough to remember "Loose lips sink ships?"
Well me either, but I can remember what the old people talked
about often!
  Yikes.
  You know, none of this would've happened if "W's" IQ were 99 
or 100 or more.

  a poem

What do you think happens
to our souls after we die?
Will they feel the cold
when it snows? Will they fight
the wind as we do?
When our souls meet after life,
will they run toward eachother?
Will we have forgiven eachother
for transgressions that only matter
to the living and their lives?
Will we be able to tell each other,
without our mouths,
how much more important
love turned out to be
than we ever thought it would?
