   BLOWFISH AND CROW WED
(Oregon) Sherri L. Crow married Hootie A. Blowfish in a closed
ceremony by the ocean last nite.
      Officiating in the wedding was Hugh H. Wavygravy with Mojo
N. Vixon assisting.
      The bride looked funny in leopard-skin tights under a long
coffee chamois gown with a 40-foot onion skin train. ON her head
she wore a heron's nest.
      The groom came bedeckled in a ballcap saying "JUST MARRIED,"
a blue T-shirt and Tommy Hilfiger jeans with holes in the back 
or cheeks to stick out.
      Ringbearing and flowergirling was communally done by
the Handsons.
      Singing at the reception was what's left of Milla and Vanilla.
Many people got too drunk on coke and lipsinc'ed poorly ino the 
morning.
      The couple will be honeymooning at the Presidential Suite

DENVER - Less than one year after mergering Fort Howard and

To ATI:
   You made two mistakes in your last newspaper.
First, it's International Money Fund, not "military" as

Third and finally, it was not New Years. You wished somebody

Subj:    Currents on Dineh Resistance
Date:   98-09-28 13:56:56 EDT
From:   (Bahe Yazzie Katenay)

Greetings Supporters,

Why does such forms of injustices have to continue against the last
traditional tribes in AMERICA? Yes, America --known as the, "Human Rights
Capital of the World."

Just 30 years ago the Dineh and Hopis were so traditionally intacted to
the land and to their ancient intertribalism. Then, 20 years ago they
realized that the ancient homelands were in question for complete Federal
Government regulation, and even partitioning of their Black Mesa/Big
Mountain country. Their movement to defend their sacred country had one of
the greatest impact on federal Indian Policies, since perhaps,in the times
of Captain Jack, Gernimo and Crazy Horse. 

Throughout the late 1970s and into the early 80s, these traditional
resistors have in some ways woken up the World, again, about how fragile
Indigenous cultures are. The traditional Dineh and their allies, the
traditional Hopis, have tried to inform the American public about the
Corporate Greed that threaten to enforced new, 20th Century laws that can
easily terminate these ancient cultures. These Dineh and Hopi elders have
worked hard to further inform what it means to Coexist as Humans, and
they've tried to present to the World what was left of their ancient
bicultural survivals. The obvious truth has always been there before us. 

Who are the Dineh and Hopi traditionals? They are a society of communities
that had wish to live in harmony with the natural world. They are the
descent of all those great Chiefs that have resisted the late 1800s and
early 1900s against Euro-American colonialism. Just 30 years ago, these
people lived a prosperous and healthy life, their ceremonial gatherings
wereone of the largest (real) traditionally conducted events, nearly
two-thirds of them still traveled on horseback or by wagons, and their
intertribal trading were still as active as hundreds of years before.

Just in 30 years the intent of Peabody Western Coal and Major Utility
Companies of the southwest have exterminated most of the ancient ways of
this last, unique and traditionally-intact culture. For the Dineh, once a
healthy and a harmonous pastoral culture are being confined to only six
acres until the last Grazing Permit holder dies. The rest of the prestine
lands of Black Mesa/Big Mountain will go to the beef industry,
recreational areas and to coal strip mines. As the U. S. Government has
ruled that the lands will go to the Hopis, there is no existing plans by
the "progressive" Hopi Government of future construction of settlements
that can reduplicate their ancient villages. 

The last remaining Dineh resistors ask the World Communities to monitor
the US's encroachment upon their sacred grounds.
[by Bahe Y. Katenay, Dineh interpreter from Big Mountain]
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
	The US media is continuing its misinformation 
about the purpose of relocating traditional Hopis and Dineh. 
They claim that "relocation and partitioning of lands" 
is the only solution to "this intertribal conflict." 
Knowing the US's practice of injustices upon the Indigenous
Nations of America, one must ask themselves: Does the federal 
government intend to protect Indian territories or cultures, 
or will it consider business interests over an already 
poverty stricten Indian communities?
Would the Fed. Gov't feel that Indian Nations of America 
is a higher priority over lands laden with aquifers and 
mineral resources? How can it be stated in the media for 
25 years that "the Navajos invaded the defenseless Hopis, 
and occuppied the ancient Hopi lands," when there has
never been any proven evidence of plunder or massacres 
according to the hundreds of existing archaelogical informations? 
Interests of mineral explorations is way more evident today, 
than seeing the Hopis reviving their cultures and creating 
new village sites on their newly awarded lands. Both of these 
traditional Nations have suffered the consequences of losing 
all of the ancient homelands. Peabody Western Coal Co. is the
only thriving industrial commuity on Black Mesa/Big Mtn. 
Citizens of the World need to put a halt to this destruction 
of the sacred Mother Mountain and her ancient children!
  [ed note: Thanks dj, a quick prime anarchist note:
   if there's such a range war going on, then how would a
   jew/swede like me have gone into town (Hotevilla) for mail 
   with a navajo man visiting a hopi man smoking pot with him
   while he makes dinner for his wife off at work, and his baby
   boy in a backpack behind him???]

Dear PrimeAnarchist
I found a tiny black hair in my cigar the other day.

allowed to print whose - but I lit it up and it really 
did taste great. Too bad you can't give credit.

 SOMEONE MAILED US all of these,

Please alert...

 I did a web search on International Paper, and it all 
 came up roses, even with some eco-friendly stuff about 
 them... obviously biased. I even tried doing a search 
 with words like "conspiracy" and "criminal" with their 
 name and nothing then either. Otherwise, I don't know 
 boo about IP.

I've shortened it from what I received, but I must say it was
better uncut. If I only had a larger zine, eh? And cutting 
this into 4 parts just couldn't happen. So I hope my editing
was in good faith to the word... (prime)

October 2, 1998
To the Honorable Generation of 1968
Brothers and sisters:
I write to you in the name of the men, women, children and 
old ones of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation, 
in order to salute you on this date which remembers the 
30 years of the massacre of Tlatelolco, but also the 30
years of a movement which fought for democracy, liberty and 
justice for all Mexicans.

68 is not just October 2 and the painful Plaza of the Three Cultures.
68 is not just Tlatelolco, the killing of children, men, women and old
ones, unarmed and helpless in front of the tanks, the rifles, 
the machine guns, the stupidity of the government.
68 is not just the Plaza, summing up and exuding the blood of three
cultures, under the death decreed by their political system, which
continues today and is repeated with similar deaths.
68 is a window, through which to see and learn from, the open
confrontation between various ways of making politics, between 
different ways of being human.
68 marked the history of this country in a definitive
manner.  
Then, two countries confronted each other:  the one built on
authoritarianism, intolerance, repression and the most brutal
exploitation; and that which wanted, and wants, to build on 
democracy, inclusion, liberty and justice.

Above:
The Mexico of the PRI and the military.  
The Mexico of violence and lies.
The Mexico of those who pretend to govern for all.
The Mexico of those who manage the catastrophe 
for the benefit of a few.
The Mexico of the criminals who order and pull the 
trigger in Tlatelolco, in Acteal, in Chavajeval, 
in Union Progreso, in Aguas Blancas, in El Charco.
The Mexico in the throes of death.

Beneath: 
The Mexicoof those who live and die the rebellion and the 
struggle for justice in the only way possible, that is, 
their entire lives.
The Mexico of those who followed and are following, 
demanding, struggling, organizing, resisting.       
The Mexico of those who did not make 68 a shameful past, a mere
youthful indiscretion, a stairway to the bad government.
The Mexico of those who, in unions, in education centers, in
non-governmental organizations, in the popular neighborhoods, 
in the ejidos and communities, in the underground, in the 
streets and in the countryside and in the mountains, everywhere, 
are carrying on, are continuing, are resisting.
The Mexico of those from below.  The Mexico which will live. 
Mexico of 1968
Mexico of 1998
The Mexico of those who struggled and are struggling to be 
better in the only way it is possible to be better, 
that is, with everyone.
To them, the men and women.  To what follows.  
To those who resist.  To those who continue.  To those who, 
even dead, survived 68 and whom we see today on this side, 
together with us, although distinct and different.
We, the zapatistas, salute those of always.
1968. 1998
Time to demand that the whole truth be known, 
that the crimes of yesterday and today not remain unpunished.
1968. 1998
Then and now the lie from above comes to conceal reality.
The reality of blood staining the plazas.
The reality of authoritarianism raised to crime.
1968. 1998
The reality of the dead and the living 
recollecting and tending the memory.
The reality of the struggle which continues.
The reality of the promised tomorrow, which will come...

Vale.  Salud and it cannot be forgotten:  
30 years later...the struggle continues.
>From the mountains of Southeast Mexico.

Subcomandante Insurgente Marcos.
Mexico,  October 1998
