SAY IT AIN'T SO, JIM. By Prime Anarchist.   11-01-01.
        You know what really sucks? Jim Palmer, yeah
Mr. Late Great.
        He no longer looks like the athlete he was/is.
He looks like the used car dealer from Hell. Yes, I
swear. Allah as my witness. Yawveh strike me dead, I
saw him hawking 35th-mortgage homeowner loan-refinancings
during station ID on the Rosie O'Donnell show.
        You know, if you're in debt up to your teeth
sell us your nuts, we'll keep all your eggs in OUR
basket.
        Yeah, Jim Palmer for the Money Tree Store.
        I think I'll call him Cerberus, the Barking
Man with Three Toupees.

So why DID Perry Farrel thunkup Lollapalooza???
   L- began in July 1991 as the farewell tour for Jane's Addiction. Farrell
wanted to do something special in the group's honor. So, in May of that
year, Farrel and a few others - agents Marc Geiger and Don Muller, Jane's
Addiction's co-manager Ted Gardner, and Stuart Ross - began planning
for the tour, adding seven bands, food, local crafts, art displays - an
extravaganza unlike any ever attempted before. They pulled it off... and
the rest, as they say, is history. The band played twenty-eight shows
that year, and the whole thing was a resounding success. In fact the 
first three years it was the only major festival listed in ALL billboard
"genres" that turned a profit. 
        Spin Magazine called L- "One of the most innovative and successful
concert tours of the decade." Rolling Stone dubbed it the "Tour of the
Decade." Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers admitted it was "The most
fun tour I've ever been on." It all adds up to the fact that the L- 
Festival is acknowledged as THE ANNUAL ALTERNATIVE CULTURE EVENT.
        This is a long overdue rhetorical prime anarchist question:
THAN WHY IS IT SO COMMERCIAL NOW???

SEPARATISTS SAY CONVICTIONS WON'T END THEIR QUEST FOR THE WORLD'S 
LARGEST HAMBURGER.
       by Eduardo "Lacto-Ovo" Montes. Special to PAWN.
Alpine, TEX. - Members of the green separatist Republic of Texas movement
don't expect their dream of a giant beef-burger to suffer since two of
their leaders were found guilty of organized-crime charges.
        They maintain that they've never stopped meeting and working
sausage grinders and slaughterhouses day and nite in 4 states, since
their fearless leader, Richard "shoot-em-up-eat-em-up-yum" McLaren,
was arrested after an armed standoff against 285 longhorn steers and 
14 brahma bulls.
        "We're going to kick Whitecastle NewYork's ass," said Shoot-em
of the world's second largest beefburger's founding spot and the home 
of the first annual summer festival devoted entirely to hamburger.
        "And then we're coming after YOU, Wisconsin."
        This Montes/McLaren interview took place over free 72 oz
steaks in Amarillo Texas Tuesday.

KEIKO HAVING TONSILS REMOVED
        Can a killer whale say ahhhh???
Keiko of "Free Willy" fame will be poked and prodded by
the same marine experts in Newport Ore., what did Reagan's
brain surgery in 1983.
        After the notorious ocean-dwelling nocturnal creature
loses his tonsils he'll be force-fed ice-cream, jello, Kraft
mac-n-cheese (tm) and a liquified substance known as spammaise (tm)
made from ground up chuck, fish, horse tonsils, sawdust (tm), 
watermelon rhinds and egg-whites in an effort to get rid of
his tapeworms at the same time, so as to save US taxpayers
a record $1.35 (that's one dollar, and thirty-five cents.)

TOO MANY POLICE DEPARTMENTS HAVE STOCKED UP ON WHITE PHOSPHORUS GRENADES
Sacramento, CALIF - White Phosphorus has bolstered the arsenals of
police in 23 states as part of a massive flow of surplus military gear.
Now one of the nation's biggest police departments, Los Angeles says
it was a big mistake and it's sending its grenades back to the 
military.
        More than 6,400 surplus grenades - which are by the way, too
heavy to throw far enough so the patrolperson doesn't risk getting
hot burning white speckles on his or her uniform - went to law
enforcement agencies between Oct. 1, 1996 and Sept. 30, 1997 according
to the Federal Defense Logistics Agency in Washington.
        Some question whether military weapons, particular 
White Phosphorus, uranium tipped 100mm howitzer shells, bazukkas,
50 cal. machine guns with tumbler rounds and gold plated silver
Chinese throwing stars have any place in civilian law enforcement.
        "We can imagine no circumstances whatsoever where it would
be appropriate for a local police agency to put an item like the 
white phosphorus grenade on the end of a police officer," said J.
Crew, an ACLU attorney.
        The LAPD had added 42 of these grenades over recent years, but
is giving them all back this week.
        "The main reason we're sending them back," said Cmdr Rick
Dinse, "because (sic) the department has no use for them."
        Dinse, a Harvard graduate himself; also noted that more 
than half his patrolpersons went to public schools and he was very
concerned about where on the body these grenades would be attached.
        "Right there up high on the left breast," said Dinse, "hangin'
next to the tear gas."

Wallingford, CONN. (this one's for real) A parent complained to Parker
Farms School officials last month for using a dictionary which 
contains the word "fuck." 
        School officials reviewed the Merriam-Webster dictionary and 
replaced them with more "appropriate" dictionaries for library and 
classroom use.

You pay just $199.99!!
Yeah, plus 19.98 shipping and handling.
And don't forget 19.99 a month. Oh, and $100
if you want a keyboard to type on. But don't worry,
if you get 6 months right up front (that's $120!!!)
MagnaPhil will give you a hundred dollar rebate.
But don't think about all that, you can just pro-rate
all that just by calling our 1-900 # and pay 58$ a month
for the next year or two.
        Reminded me of General Selectric, er uh, I mean Disney
World when I was a little kid.
        A half hour of televangelo-marketing so powerful 
(Kn u sy mega-info-tainment-mercial???) no one should be able
to leave their television if even to relieve themselves.
        My opinion? The last TV thing more powerful than this
invasion of your living room was HG Wells' fault. That's right
War of the Web-TV. War of the Worlds. Wow.
        Sears is facing bankruptcy court just like Coke and 
Citibank. And guess how they're a-gon' bail the selves out?
        "Do you sell WebTV by Magnapox," I asked the guy on
the other end at Sears technology department.
        "Yeah we sur'nuff do. Got people lookin' at it right now."
Can you say blow out?
I can say the new dark ages is on its way.

       For a living that if I
       Wasn't doing it for money
       I'd do it anyways."  -- Lyle Lovett

Safe and warm.
Fritos and popcorn entrenched
In my couch. Nothing agrees with
Stomach more than peanut butter
And banana on toasted
Whole wheat bread.

Deli & Dawgs Diner -- would you eat there???

Violence impacted to society;
Embedded in life.
No capo, slide, fuzz pedal or 
Delay - no fingerpicks or 
Teleprompter, just play.
Eugene O'Neill wallops the skipper
With words and rocks the boat,
Frank Sinatra "does it [his] way"
Rooted in divine inspiration,
He claims.
Apple falls on head and
Turns lightbulb on jouncing
Thought, slurping coffee
Like a pretentious snit.
Jogging memory with a
Jarful of Jolt cola.
Orange lentils & linguini
Lodged in a sore throat.
Don't sop the heat of hot chili
With cucumber; use bread: good buffer.

Shelter Wagon is hospitality on a horse. 
Running from river to river
Haven't seen hay for 30 miles:
How come I have hayfever??

Run chasing your shadow
All morning; then you can 
Chase it home all afternoon.
