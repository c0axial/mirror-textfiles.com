   Am I imagining it or what? Pomegranite
season - one or two weeks long, and that's
it. I ate one for the whole year??? Oh well.
Fear not, it's prickly pear cactus season now.
Watch your fingers. And have you seen the 
Northern Lights? I haven't, they tell me it's
nice. Cool moon though. Three nites in a row!
   A member of the BoDeans was leaving a local
thrift store here as I was going in. Too bad he
wasn't by LAST WEEK. He would've seen their
"Closer to Free" album in there before I did.
Woulda run 'em 45 cents amerikan!
   I still feel like I have radiation poisoning,
yuppy flu, cancer or something. Off and on since
April or May. And worse every nite, better every
morning. With all the birds and lobsters dying
around us, I'm a little nervous about earth
changes. Just the part of me that's still 
obsessin' over all that is "the flesh."
   Learn all you can about Jacob's Ladder.

yourself.

The reason I ask you about your personal

that a unique cross-cultural laboratory 
has been going on here for the past 30 years. 
On the one hand you have the largest 
unassimilated native community in the US, 
and you have thousands of "outsiders" coming 
here and living. Seems like the stories we 
have to tell may act as a bridge.

  Its me again, the swedish gal!! I just wanted to tell you 
about an amazing thing that happened today; the politicians 
( some of them ) will distribute the SENAA Dineh petition! 
They will send it along with their membership-newspapers 
( i guess its a fair amount of thousands ) So these days 
is filled with surprises!! 
  I have to say its beautiful to LIVE!! 
Finally people are starting to wake up!! Lets hope the good 
things in life come to the Indigenous Nations soon and my 
prayers for that goes up to the Magnificent Grandmothers on 
Big Mtn and all the rest of the Dineh and Hopis, as well as 
ALL of you!!!

New Death Warrant Signed for Mumia Abu-Jamal
by Daughters of Nadia. Special to (PAWN)

Philly - (Prime Anarchist World Newz) - On October 13th, Governor 
Ridge of Pennsylvania signed a new death warrant for African-American 
activist and journalist Mumia Abu-Jamal currently on death row.  
Supporters around the country took to the streets to protest the 
warrant on October 14th and 16th and demand a new trial.
   Mumia was sentenced to death in 1982 in association with the death 
of White police officer Daniel Faulkner.  Abu-Jamal was driving his 
taxi cab in Philadelphia when he saw a man being beaten by Faulkner.  
Mumia stopped and realized the man being beaten was his brother.  
Shots were fired, Mumia was shot in the chest and Faulkner died 
from a bullet wound to the head.
   Mumia’s legal defense cites many injustices concerning his trial 
and the evidence.  Mumia’s fingers were not tested to see if he had 
fired a gun. Mumia did carry a licensed .38 caliber gun after being 
robbed twice during his night shift driving cab.  Abu-Jamal’s gun 
was not smelled to see if it had been fired.  Also, the medical 
examiner’s written report stated Faulkner was shot by a .44 caliber 
bullet.
   The legal defense also points out problems with Mumia’s trial.  
The jury consisted of two African-Americans in a city that is 40% Black.  
Mumia was denied his right to self-representation and was assigned a 
lawyer who was later disbarred for incompetency.  Albert Sabo, the judge 
who sentenced Mumia, was known as "the hanging judge" because Sabo had
sentenced 31 people to death.  All but two were people of color. These
are only some of the legal defense’s allegations and reasons for appeals.
Governor Ridge signed Mumia’s death warrant two days before Mumia’s well
known petition would enter the courts.  Abu-Jamal has filed a writ of
habeas corpus which asks the federal courts to decide whether Mumia has
been legally sentenced by Sabo.  This is Mumia’s first and last chance to
present evidence previously denied by the Pennsylvania courts.  The
petition is also significant because it is the first time an appeal will
be heard by a judge other than Sabo.
   People demanding a new trial for Mumia continue to educate and actively
protest Mumia’s current life-threatening situation.  Tens of thousands of
people around the world protested to demand a fair trial on April 24th,
1999.  Abu-Jamal’s case has also gained much international and celebrity
support.  Some of the supporters include Ossie Davis, Susan Sarandon, Ed
Asner, Rage Against the Machine, Michael Stipe of REM, the Beastie Boys,
the former First Lady of France, and the National Lawyers Guild, the
Japanese Diet, English Parliament, Nelson Mandela, and the Pope.
The intention of Mumia’s appeal is to ask for a new trial, where jurors
can hear both sides and consider all of the evidence.  As Mumia’s
attorney, Leonard Weinglass, states, "What we seek is Mumia's first day
in court, because he has not had one yet."
