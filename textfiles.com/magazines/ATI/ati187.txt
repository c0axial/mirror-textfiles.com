Hello, 
I'm prime anarchist, and have
we
got
some
stuff
   for
  you!!!

Now Tommy Hilfiger's "presenting" Lenny Kravitz
and Smashmouth too???
   Wait.
   Did I awake to a patron system or what?
   I know, rather than wasting my precious time
living my beliefs, I could just raise half a billion
american, (devil-care-how) and spend the rest of
my death throwing money at people who seem to be
living my lives themselves.
   I didn't make any paper this year. Yuck.
   Restroom. Starbucks. Milw. 1st impression.
"PLUNGER LOCATED HERE." Paper sign, black magic
marker block lettering. Arrow down pointing at
a problem solver on a stick.
   Overall, Starbucks are home to the cleanest
nicest most well-tendered bathrooms in the 
world, huh?
   ATU, is that teamsters?? It's recent symbol
(can you say icon?) is a seal in front of two
flags. US -o- Canada. The Amerikan Teamsters
Union!
   Where's Mexico in all this? Need I say the
position OR the oriface?
   I reprint this from Sept '99 Gear and then
that's all I got this week:
   "Patrick (of the band Filter, on his song
"Nice Shot.") Says the song was influenced
primarily by the 1987 suicide of former Penn.
State Treasurer R. Budd Dwyer, who, during a
press conference, pulled a .357 cal. magnum
from a [manila envelope -- I remember that 
from live TV] placed the barrel in his mouth
and pulled the trigger." 
   Wow, I always WANTED the guy's name ever
since I saw that footage. What caliber I never
knew or cared. I wanted his name more.
   Now you know.
   # 
prime
   
ps: here's a quickie poem, then the numbers and 
then the letters, then some stories and stuff,
and then as usual, we end with poetry, cause
after all is said and done, what's the metaphor,
you???

THE EARTH IS MY FIRST MOTHER
   a prime anarchist poem.
I plucked three leaves off an
Indoor ivy plant at work today.
I'm not too concerned for the
Pain
I caused.
Deal with the other pain 
I spared 
For the rest of his life.
And what set me off 
Into
Saviour/surgeon/seer mode?
I got sick and fucking tired of the fact
No one seemed to even notice him 
Crying...
From three-month-old hole-punch marks on
Those leaves.

The North American Registry of Who's Who 
Among Successful African Americans cordially 
invites you for inclusion in the upcoming 
1998-99 edition of our publication.
This invitation has resulted from you being 
featured in some publication, Radio or TV 
appearance or involvement in a community, 
civic or religious activity...
   [ed note: my ability to pass and my
    whole life's thus far dancing as a 
    "white person" leaves me "undesirous"
    of your award, thanks anyways. Does
    the offer stand for others, say if
    Monique hires a black woman or man
    to write sports?]

(...and we prolly shoulda put this in the 
"press release section, but here...)
Scene Magazine, September, 1999:

"DAY TRIPPING: WARP COMBINES A 24 HOUR PLAY 
AND RAVE. PARTY ON!

Is there more to clubbing than whizzing off your 
tits to 'Music Is The Answer' at Gatecrasher?  
The Warp team thinks so.  The Warp marries a 24
hour play about a guy called Neil Oram with a 
24 hour rave featuring every type of music from 
jungle to trance.  Now, a play about some bloke's life
may not sound appealing, but you've never met anyone like 
Oram, a mechanic who was encouraged to write his story after 
he was 'discovered' by '60s theatre director Ken Campbell.  
The marathon play, this time around directed by Campbell's daughter 
Daisy, has been dubbed "the hippy Hamlet" and it's easy to see why.  
Oram claimed to have met angels. a man who could be in two places 
at once and the great god pan, on Princes Street, Edinburgh.  He is
now reputed to be living in master of the occult Alisteir Crowley's 
cottage at Loch Ness.  
  With five wives.
     Still sounds like twaddle?  
       The 1,100 goggle-eyed ravers who turned up to
the opening show in May at the Drome in London beg to differ.  
"There's supposed to be some guy who's lost his name wandering around 
South London, just jabbering about The Warp" laughs promoter Fraser Clark, 
best known for Megatripolis, which dominated Thursday nights in London for 
several years. "The Warp is an incredible play. I've always thought it was 
perfect for clubbing. Because you can just pop in and out. 
There's no other play like it. Today's rave generation don't understand 
what excited the hippies in the '60s. They weren't just running around 
smoking pot."

You Ever Get The Feeling You're 
In James Merrill's Place
   a poem by Marco Capelli

You ever get the feeling you're
In James Merrill's place?
Chopin Mazurkas and Scriabin on an
Upright piano.
A Walden Pond tree-leaf
Framed on the wall behind upright.
"Being Peace" and a picture in a 
Handful of rooms.
Actual plants.
Actual feathers.
ALL OVER THE PLACE.
Mentadent, mustard and blackstrap
Molasses -
One'd think s/he were in
James Merrill's place.

Close, but no.
Close.

Your hosts for the evening are Antler and Jeff.


...One more? Just cut the power if you want me
to jump offstage... (or you could say "one more.")
...that's it...


Fake Cherrywood Starbucks Table.
   a poem by Marco Capelli

"and you're proactive, so..."
she smiles, moving both arms around trying to
get the other patron to understand her meaning.
   Proactive, there's that word again.

They drove the woman next to me away, these 
proactive people -=-
 -=- their complexes 
And their grounding philosophies, their psycho
Job market.
I never got her name, this woman next to me -
Preparing for her MD exam, but she didn't make it
Outa here without us
Sharing a laugh.
She's gathering up her books and 
Belongings, shaking her head, smiling a little
My way, giving out a quiet yiddish "tsch, tsch..."
That I guess I'm the only response for.

I lean her way, smile for her alone, 
And whisper,
   "you know, the word 'proactive's' bugged
the shit out of me from the first day I ever
heard it."
   Giggles and guffaws. I cracked her up. I think
she knows how I mean. Usually the user of a word
Such as
"proactive,"
Isn't going to get a thing done except three 
Levels of paperwork shuffled around, shredded, 
and/or started.

Making a gorgious intern dressed all in black
Laugh here in a Starbucks.
Wow.
For me, a first.

As usual, we end with a pome.
this one's by Shayna Plaut and
it's called "Flipside."
    
    I, gave up, my poetry,
    for revolutionary causes
    I
    gave up
    my poetry
    on
    revolutionary causes
    I thought
    the blood
    of the revolution
    ran too thick for
    my anemic pen
    my hand inadequate
    at drawing the words
    for La Causa
    I gave up
    my revolutionary causes
    for my poetry
    and realized
    the two were the same.
