       Dear marco,

       We must speak with you. I don’t usually take the time
       out to write a personal note, marco, but your name was
       provided by someone you had recently spoken to. We
       believe your vibrations to be so strong that I’ve 
       endorsed a free Tarot reading with one of our 
       elite psychics! It’s urgent, however, that you
       call immediately - I can only reserve this number 
       for a limited time. Call toll-free  1-800-ppp-nnnn,
       now!

       marco, we sensed that your connection is likely to 
       be unusually strong, especially in the very near...

  I can't type much as I have no money for the Internet Cafe and my right hand
  has no feeling at all in it from writing around 100 pages per day by hand
  for 34 days in the worst prison I've ever imagined.

  Urs Mumenthaler is a 38-year-old crazy Swiss-German homosexual who pretends
  to the world that he's poor. The truth is, he inherited over 100,000,000
  from a [man]* he was living with who died several years ago, named
  "Stuker"...a guy who was well-known for owning several top-notch Swiss-
  German art galleries. Urs also inherited a castle worth 60,000,000 and a 
  lot of other property.

  He is a LOUSY musician who tried too many years to be a star. He can hardly
  play and his singing is a joke, so he came to me offering to produce some
  CDs for me with 165,000 dollars which is nothing to a guy like him. I've
  known him and another Swiss-German, Armin Ris (an author of UFO type books)
  for about 10 years. I thought they were my only male Swiss friends.

  Urs entered into a contract with am American corporation called University
  of Creative Arts, Inc., division: Eclipse Music Productions in which he
  agreed to loan that much money to the corporation - not to me. The contract
  states that IF the CDs make a lot of money, Urs is repaid...if not, the loan
  is due in 10 years. My name is nowhere in the contract. I was given power-
  of-attorney to open and maintain bank accounts wherever needed, here,
  Denmark, etc.

  Armin Risi found out about how much money Urs had paid in April and became
  VERY jealous - a typical Swiss characteristic. He told Urs he should tell
  his lover, Rainer Lauer, a former member of a German terrorist organisation
  who lives in Zuerich, about the money. Urs told Rainer, and Rainer went
  berserk, telling Urs he MUST report to the police that I "defrauded" him 
  out of his money, and spent it all on "personal items". I DID NOT!

  I hired a local lawyer and paid him from May till October. He continuously
  assured me that I would "never" be arrested. When I landed in prison on 18
  October, he sent a fax to me at the prison telling me he had "no time" to
  represent me. He sent another lawyer he knew to represent me.

  After a month in the hell-hole in solitary confinement, living on bread, and
  going out of my mind, the lawyer told me if I'd agree to transfer all of the
  money from  all of the accounts I controlled all over the world to a Swiss
  bank account (which would then be blocked by the judge) I could leave the
  prison and wait for my trial at home, but without my Swiss or US passports,
  and of course, flat broke.

  That's it in a nutshell. 

  People can fax letters to my lawyer letting him know 
  what they think of this.

Censored! (by Yahoo)

Yahoo closed my site without any warning.
I can imagine why.
I write political texts, I do not agree with the Afghan War, I do not agree
with the American policy, I am against the greedy American elite. That you
can read on my site.
Not anymore on Yahoo, my site Down with the Elite can now be found on
http://members.ams.chello.nl/jsteenis
Rather a long name but you cannot have it all.

Yahoo did not even give me the possibility to keep a small site on which I
refer to my new provider. They must be very angry about the contents of my
site. And they never heard of freedom of speech. By the way you are only
free to say something when you abide by the rules laid down by the same
people you attack.

Yahoo does not like my opposition to the American Establishment. Though I do
not write that the American government assists a murderous regime in
Afghanistan (and elsewhere) and that it is not capable to solve the problems
it has caused. Too many people write already these negative things. I write
positive, I write about the possibilities to get another kind of society. In
my next article I describe how the masses can cause a revolution, a
catastrophe, after which we enter in a higher stage of human development. So
we can leave the present situation in which our world seems to remain
eternally in a situation in which people are not free because the elite
wants to possess most of the power and the wealth.

The Cast
  reprinted from http://www.annefeeney.com/Pages/jail.html

Jack Irwin played piano and organ with me 14 years ago when he still 
lived in Pittsburgh. Now he’s got those talented hands, his great pair 
of ears, and huge heart invested in a world-class studio in Nashville. 
His creative energy added enormously to the project. he also rounded 
up our old pal Jim Hoke to sprinkle musical magic on the recording, 
as well as Mike McAdam, Sam Bacco and Charlie Chadwick for the rhythm 
tracks.
  But the BEST was getting Jon Fromer, Susan Lewis and Janet Stecher 
(Rebel Voices), and Kim and Reggie Harris in to sing with me. Over 
the years it has been such a joy to work with them at different 
rallies, riots and festivals. To get them all into the studio with 
me for this was a dream come true. Their spirit and love and awesome 
talents lifted me, and the whole project. They are not just treasured 
friends and extraordinary artists, but, like Bertold Brecht, they know 
that:

"Art is not a mirror to reflect reality, 
but a hammer with which to shape it."

A 12 POINT WAR RECOVERY PROGRAM

   by blast furnace radio's Vincent Scotti Eirene 

1) do not watch CNN, read all you can about afganistan, 
   thier history, culture, literature and art.
2) notice the same people upfront going on and on at peace 
   rallies notice...and do something different, creative, 
   and colorful
3) follow the development of the afghany refugees and raise 
   money for the million displaced from afganistan
4) download and read/listen to michael moore's anti-war letters 
   http://www.michaelmoore.com share them with others
5) think, think...would "joe six pack" understand why 
   we are against the war
6) lets look at the connections not conflicts between 
   globalization and the americas new war
7) if someone turns the mike off when pro-war folk want to 
   speak grab a few of yr buddies and turn the power back on, 
   our beliefs can withstand the blows of our critics
8) blow up your tv, move to the country, eat alot of peaches... 
   the peace movement can be a rat race, spend alot of times 
   in the country
9) if you are at at peace rally and people are trying to figure 
   out what rymthes with 1-2-3-4, calmly get on a bus and go home
10) levitate yr local press and military think tanks.
11) get on the revolutionary afghany womens associations emailing 
    list http://www.rawa.org, 
    these women are the key to war and peace
12) download everthing by "firesign theather" from audiogallaxcy 
    and learn, as others have in the past, to laugh in the face of 
    danger. The only thing scarier than the war is a self-serious 
    peace movement.

And now a word from the activist page.

I have lately been receiving emails with no content.  The headers are
there (From:, To:, Subject:, etc.) but there is no message.  Since these
have been sent by several different people, I suspect a problem with the
email system, and not the fault of the message senders.  Therefore, if
any of you have recently sent me a message that you think I should have
answered, and I haven't, please resend it, and use the original subject
header with "RESEND" added (and be sure there is a message there!). 
This may help me diagnose the problem.  Also, I am still receiving
emails containing virus attachments.  My anti-virus program (AVG 6.0 by
grisoft at http://www.grisoft.com, which I consider superior to Norton,
and is free)picks these up, but it shows me that a lot of people don't
use antivirus software and have infected computers.
  While I am at it, I would suggest that, since every email message sent
over the internet is computer-scanned by our government for key words to
tag it for further inspection, I would suggest that any confidential
messages (tactical information about protests, legal strategies, etc.)
be encrypted using PGP software.  There is a link to this software, as
well as my public PGP key, on the front page of my website, The Activist
Page, at http://www.theofficenet.com/~redorman/.
I would also recommend Zone Alarm
(http://www.zonelabs.com/products/index.html) to protect your computer
from unauthorized access while you are connected to the internet.  Have
a nice day.

Newspaper War: 
Conrad Black Backs Conservative N.Y.C. Daily; 
'The New York Sun' Billed as Times 'Alternative'
Tue Nov 27 2001 22:49:33 ET
Watch your right flank, Mr. Murdoch.
  Shore up your media reelvance, Mr. Zuckerman. 
  Conrad Black, the owner of the Chicago Sun-Times and the Jerusalem Post, 
is finally about to get at least a piece of a New York newspaper, it will 
be reported on Wednesday.
  Black and investors intend to spend up to $15 million to launch a new 
daily newspaper -- The New York Sun -- expected to appear sometime early 
next year.
  The New York Observer's Gabriel Snyder and Sridhar Pappu roll out the 
details on the deal in fresh editions.
  The New York Sun was the first successful penny press dailies after it 
was born in 1833, appealing to a working class with lurid crime reporting 
and pro-union, pro-immigrant viwes. Today, its most famous moment is the 
"Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus" letter which ran in 1897. The Sun 
finally folded in 1950.
  The new New York Sun would tilt to the right politically, reports Snyder 
and Pappu.

   a journal note, by Tifferly  [http://www.uncontrollable.net/journal.html]

Today was bring your child to work day at work.
  there were 3 kids in my department.  
they were all so cute but every single one of them 
was shy so we didn't get to have any fun with them.
  i move into the dorms in 20 days.  im getting really 
really excited.  i cant wait to set everything up but 
the thing im most nervous about is walking into all my 
classes for the very first time.  i dont want to be judged 
but i know i will be.  i mean thats natural right?
  when you see someone for the first time, or like meet 
someone for the very first time, of course you're going 
to judge them.  it's not fair.  i wish it wasnt like that.
  im sure no one will think i look like a complete bitch 
or anything like that im more worried about people thinking 
i look too young to be in college.  guess what.  i got a new 
cd today.  alicia keys.  it's pretty good i guess.  i only 
like 2 songs so far.  OH and i got a new curling iron and 
some more face wash.  not that you care that much but i do!
  i finally got to wear my new sweatshirt because it's finally 
cooled down here.  it wasnt really cool enough to wear a sweatshirt 
but i wore it anyway just for fun :)  its really comfortable.
  i want to go on a shopping spree so bad but i have no money.
  im done paying rent now.  in both west virginia and wisconsin 
so thats a plus.  okay well i think its about time to go to bed.
  i have to get up early for work tomorrow.  only 11 more days 
of work (not including the weekends!) and tomorrow is friday so 
im in a good mood.  OH WAIT.  I HAVE A STORY.  oh, nevermind.
  i dont have time.
  ill write later...maybe :)

Dwarf Tossing

A small powergroup started getting nervous ;
For while we thought that they would serve us -
We were learning little by little ...
That our '80's leaders began to diddle --

Sending arms to foreign lands ,
Diverting funds to other hands ,
Bringing drugs back to our streets ,
While our poor people suffer with chronic bare feet .

Then one day we the people got wise ;
And what to our ever questioning eyes -
Did they before us toss to our throats --
None other than a convenient scape goat .

We'll blame it all on one little guy ...
A patriot type! They'll never get why !

To aid the coverup from even its birth -
They burned a Lieutenant ,
      
        Colonel Oliver North .
