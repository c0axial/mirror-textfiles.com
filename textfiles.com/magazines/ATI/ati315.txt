315?

315??

Let's see now, 
Boy Scout Troop 315 is still in Louisville, 
Kentucky whether the Untied Way funds them 
or not.

If your area code is 315 you most likely live
in NY. If you own a BMW 315, well, I won't tell 
you what I'm thinking. So how exactly does the 
GPS 315 differ from the 314 or the 316? If you
were in Teamsters local 315, where would you be?
Don't answer that. Quite near to sanfran, though
huh? And lastly, there are right now 315 shopping
days until the middle of February. Hurry up, you
wouldn't wanna miss that.

OK.

  I welcome you to issue 315 of ati, activist
times israeli. activist times, indian. times, ill
illustrious times. Sick to death of the coverage
of the "other times."

The rest of this week's COLUMN is a poem.
It's called Coppaganda.

If anyone tells you 
I was treated with kindness
Kick 'em in the nuts
Run and kick 'em in the nuts.

If anyone tells you 
They were fair to us
Tell 'em it is bad to lie
Tell 'em it is bad to die.

If anyone tells you 
That nothing has happened lately
Tell 'em it is bad to lie
Tell 'em it is bad to die.

Propa doppa, coppa coppa

RECEIPTS:

Wow, what a great bake recipe.
Leftover brown rice.
Half a package     or any beans. (black beans are my favorite)
Lots of olive oil
garlic
onions
peppers
tomato paste (or spaghetti sauce)
baking chocolate
basil
molasses


rice and beans and olive oil in a pot on 350+

start sauteeing onions in oil (olive my fave, of course)
Add in green peppers, garlic, basil.

Keep that on low while you're preparing the 
spaghetti, baking chocolate and whatever else
you're going to want to add. Here's a good spot
to drop a bay leaf in while you're adding this
stuff. And the molasses too.

Put all the onions and the sauce into the pot
with the rice and beans now and stir it every 
10 minutes or so until it's tasty, smells good
and sizzles a little when you open the door.

YUM!!!

BOOK RECOMMENDATION OF TWO MILLENIA:

THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS LACK AN INTRO; MAKE YOUR OWN.

The only response the US could have which would make
any lasting peaceful effect, I'm afraid is to lead a 
worldwide summit on race; and be ready to address issues 
of class, gender, color and everything any one else thinks 
of along the way.

But guess who pulled out of the last race summit?
And check out the date!!



POEM FOR BABYLON

Royal Scam - Steely Dan
Lookin' at the front of a CD
Carl just handed me.
Makin' me listen for Steely Dan clues
Lookin' at a cover that gives me

 T H E   B L U E S

Homeless fuckin' dude about
To get eaten by high and
Mighty vultures from teh 73rd floor.
They need to EAT each other FIRST.
Look down on the homeless fuckin' dude.
It's your liberal trap.
Why did you eat the soul of his shoes.
He built your fuckin' city.
And now he's nothing to you.
Eat each OTHER.
I'll climb you when there's only 
One story left.

If there weren't so many poor, crippled,
Hurt, lame, needy or shallow --

The word "fuck" would not
Have such healing power.

18jun91 - New Rochelle, NY


         

          Good morning mom. 

             Don’t be ashamed for my behavior. 
LETTER        I’m feeling very sick, I have the impression 
FROM           I’m becoming like a beast. 

A YOUNG       I can’t believe what I’m doing. 
ISRAELI          I obey orders so I don’t look like 
SOLDIER       a sissy in front of my friends. 
                You could never understand what it means 
              to enter a house with ten children inside, 
             woman and old people, pointing the rifle on 
            them, shouting, "freeze!" in Arabic. 
              Only a few months ago I was going to school, 
           a nice sweet boy, now I’m an assassin. 
             My officer orders me to take the kitchen; 
          I throw on the floor pans, flour sacks, sugar, 
         to check if they are hiding guns, or bombs. 
        The noise of things falling makes me throw up. 
          A small child in the corner looks at me with 
       eyes full of hate. I know that I would hate Israeli 
      soldiers all my life if I were in his shoes. 
        I would kill them if I saw my mother (I mean you) 
    forced on the floor, with your face on the carpet, 
   shaking of fear while soldiers storm in the house. 
     I’ll refuse to do it next time they ask me to do it. 
  I’ll go to jail. 
Don’t be ashamed mom. 
  I’m missing dad a lot, he would have told me what to do. 
I know that in open combat I could give my life. 
But I can’t kick down shelfs, break down walls, 
and force old people on the floor. 
  It makes me feel like puke. 
  I hate myself. 
  I’m not myself anymore. 
  I talked with two of my friends that feel the same way. 

  An old woman was spitting in the face of one of them. 
Later he cried in his sleeping bag. 
Only I heard him sobbing like a baby. 
I can defend myself; don’t worry. 
I see too many cigarette butts in your ashtray. 
I’m probably the cause of so much smoking. 
  Hug Yael for me; tell her I’m sorry 
I couldn’t say bye before leaving. 
I wonder how she would feel if soldiers break into her room 
messing up everything and pushing her down on the floor. 
Well, I’m finished 
If I’ll refuse to obey orders and get arrested 
will you understand me, mom?

ANSWER: Gandhiji

WHO MADE THESE DEMANDS?

1. Hindus and Sikhs must forthwith stop all attacks against Muslims
and must reassure Muslims that they would live together as brothers.
2. Hindus and Sikhs would make every effort to ensure that not one
Muslims should leave India because of insecurity of life and property.
3. Attacks which were taking place on Muslims in moving trains must
forthwith stop and Hindus and Sikhs who were taking part in such 
attacks must be prevented from doing so.
4. Muslims who lived near the shrines and Dargahs like Nizamuddin
Aulia, Khwaja Qutubuddin Bakhtiar Kaki and Sasiruddin Chiragh Dehlvi
had left their homes in distress. They must be brought back to their 
own locality and re-settled.
5. The Dargah Qutubuddin Bakhtiar had been damaged. Government could 
of course restore and repair the shrine but this wouldn't satisfy 
Gandhiji. He insisted that the restoration and repairs must be done 
by Hindus and Sikhs as an act of atonement.
6. Most important of all was the need for a change of heart.
Fulfillment of the other conditions was not so important as 
this. Leaders of the Hindu and Sikh communities must reassure
Gandhiji on this point so that he would not have to fast again 
on such an issue.

These demands were met, and he broke his fast. "Let this be my
last fast," he said. He was gunned down shortly afterwards. It
is 2002 and not only is Pakistan and India still an open wound,
so are Afganistan and the US and Israel and Palestine.
