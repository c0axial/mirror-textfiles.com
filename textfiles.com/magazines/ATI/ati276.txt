OVERHEARD AT THE IMC: Not In Context But Very Telling.
  reprinted by Nonym Eyes

Yes too bad - you know 
I started out at 300.bps 
(like a bug crawling across 
the screen)
   My first 14.4 was like 
lighting - my highest speed 
is 33.6 I'm happy with my speed 
thank-you-very-much

And now, here's Ponty Mython with the weekly SPAM (tm) report.
  Received the following:
TED KOPPEL, NIGHTLINE, "IT PROMISES TO BECOME HUGE"
  as the subject header.
  Funny; had I not received this spam at least 25 times in
the past three years, I might have thought it was a real
email. Drats, foiled again. Another one goes into the little
garbage can inside the Windows (tm) icon.
  

GREETINGZ - i'm prime!
Here's the zine. ATI issue 276.
Yup, jumbled up into a different order, a bit, eh?
We'll go back to the same order you're used to
next week.
  Maybe.

laterz,
prime



A L L   N E W    C A R V E D - U P   S P A M

IT'S BEEN MANY MANY WEEKS SINCE WE'VE DONE 
A SPAM CARVING, ARE YOU READY FOR THIS ONE?

  Tired of the 40 X 40 X 40 Plan? You know:
Receive 40 emails from someone you don't know
40 days in a row, then notice 40% of your inbox
is spam! Spam, spam, spam and spam.
  Is receiving spam too annoying for words?
Are you sick of receiving email with no personal 
fulfillingness and even less future?
  If you're determined to retire in the next 2 - 50 
years with no spam in your inbox, and are not afraid 
to work work it, I can help you.
  If you've tried other techniques in the past that 
have failed to live up to their promises, THIS IS 
DIFFERENT THAN ANYTHING ELSE YOU'VE SEEN!
  THIS IS NOT A GET-RICH-QUICK SCHEME! BUT YOU'RE
PROBABLY WONDERING WHY WE'VE SUDDENLY MODULATED INTO
ALL-CAPS.
  WELL I'LL TELL YOU. OUR BLOODPRESSURE JUST INCREASED
BECAUSE WE'RE VERY EXCITED TO TELL YOU THIS.
YOUR INBOX DOES NOT HAVE TO BE THE SMEGMA PIT OF DOOM!
DON'T GO TO SLEEP WITHOUT TRYING THIS!
  DO IT NOW!
  "The moment you commit and quit holding back, all sorts 
of unforseen incidents, meetings and material assistance 
will rise up to help you. The simple act of commitment is 
a powerful magnet for help." -Napoleon  Hill (don't ask, 
I have no friggin' idea who s/he is.)
  Do it now before it's too late! Hold your shift key
down right now, and move your mouse clicker arrow up
until every single email before this one is highlighted.
Then simply touch the key marked "del" ever so gently,
and repeat after me. "I've now rid myself of more spam
than I've ever done before, I've now rid myself of more
spam than... [three or more times])
  After that you will achieve great happiness and much
care-free good vibrations.
  Thank you, and have a nice day.

MR. SANDCASTLE

(ch) Hey Mr. Sandcastle
     Worth all the trouble
     And the hassle
     Hey Mr. Sandcastle
     I hope you last
     G C / G / F / G C / FCG 

You're a working man with a wife and kids
Sleeping in the back of your car
I wonder how you even manage to live
Sleeping in the back of your car
G F C G / F C G - / G F C G / F C G - 

Homeless generation and you know that's true
We're moving fast toward that
All the shelters and the Holiday Inns
You know we can't change that. 

(ch) 

10% of population is rich
Other 90 go poor
Half the ninety think they're middle class
Who they foolin' no more. 

Said 10% of population is rich
Other 90 go poor
Half the ninety think they're middle class
Who they foolin' no more.

We end this week with metaphors:

The Man Who Was Looking Hard 
  by marc frucht

Part IV

One time Jesus was sitting there talking to him.
  "You know what?" he told Christ. "You know what,
I'll tell you.
  "You know what he said?" he said. "I'm searching
for the metaphors of the Christ."

Part V

He coveted the keys to the kingdom.
  He was shown the door.
