"God Bless Us Everyone" 
  This issue of ATI, #305, the special Orlando
Florida area code issue, dedicated to Gerald 
Dickens and not Adolf Giuliani; Carlo Giuliani 
and not you George "W" Bush, you "Dickens," you.
  Hi, I'm prime anarchist and this is the 
Christmas Eve holdup issue. No, I'm not sticking
a gun to your head and making you read it. In
fact, as I'm sure you know by now, if you're not
interested in reading it, I could care less. For
more than 12 years now, I've been writing this
zine straight out of my head with little or no
audience in mind save for who MIGHT come along
and read it later. I could care less that thousands
read this every week. If it were hundreds, or
dozens, or millions, or just 5 personal friends
of mine, I'd write no differently.
  Yup, I can hear you saying, "and that's why
it sucks so much." Well, that's true too. The
point of this? Oh yes, I'm reading back and 
seeing that the point I was starting to make
is that no one's holding you up to read it, it's
called the "holdup issue" because I held up the
presses hoping the people at NORAD mountain might
actually catch Santa Clause this year and announce
they've dropped a daisycutter right smack dab in
the middle of his 8 tiny yaks killing all for a 
30 mile radius so that we can all have a wonderful
CHRIST-MASS once and for all. 
  Yes, at the expense of Ramadan, at the expense of
Kwanzaa, at the expense of (C)hanu(u)k(k)a, and any
other holiday that just better get the HELL out of
here and assimilate into tree-purchasing, menorah-
purchasing, candle-purchasing, present(s)-purchasing,
life-purchasing, favor-purchasing, forgiveness-purchasing,
heaven-purchasing, have I forgotten anything? Oh yeah,
milk/and/cookies-purchasing eve!
  Basically, I decided to move this issue toward 
"X-Mas Eve" rather than the moon or the weekend, so 
that you might have something just a little bit less
consumeristic in your inbox to look at, or across
your screen to have and to hold. You know. Call it
solace in some shiny wrapping paper, or no paper.
A respitous oasis out of the box. A diversion from 
all that other schtuff!
  Enjoy,

   -23-

A short movie review.
  I just watched "Sneakers" for the second time. Nice. How
pertinent can a movie get?? Umm. Information. Yeah, "We are
the US government, we don't do things like that."
  "I think I am going to be sick." 
Ummm. Does anyone own this movie on video? I'd love .wav's of
James Earle Jones saying those two things. Don't ask me why
unless you want me to tell you! :) Anyhow, that would be quite
neat if you could do that. Hint, hint; wink, nudge, nudge.
  Say no more, say no more...




AND NOW - THE MOMENT YOU'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR.
    Egg roll, please.

...


Activist TIMEs' non-traditional announcement of 

    PERSON OF THE YEAR.

We always (yeah right!) do this the day following
TIME INC's announcement. Why? Because we feel like
giving them a really hard time. That's why.

    ELIAN GONZALEZ

Yes, the boy who dominated 2000, captivated 2001 also,
really. Do you know anyone else who you can just type
their first name into any browser (try google and see)
and see a page of him, him and no body else but him,
boop oop a doo? Yup, Elian Gonzalez. Still talked about
all over the US, and unlike with Giuliani, one can
assume all over the world, the following year. Feb 2001,
he was sure being talked about. Again in August and 
November there were places all over Florida, California,
Illinois determined to think about him instead of the
new resident of the united states, old fuddy duddy George 
"Herbert-Walker's-Kid" Bush. 
  Must have sucked to be George really, think about it.
Inauguration day, "what can we do to dominate headlines,
doh," there's that Elian again. 
  "I know, I'll drive my limo down a busy street, doh!"
there he is again, Elian signs everywhere. "Remember
Elian," "Here's to Elian," "Bring Back Elian." And the
funniest Elian sign of all, I think, "Janet who???"
  Yup, that's the one. Americans are too quick to forget
300 days of a year in favor of the last warrious 50 or
so, huh?
  So there you have it. An ACTivist TIMes INcorporated
reminder that some other things happened earlier in the
year that just might be more important this second than
whether AirForceOne is airborne, ontop of the White House
or deepinside Camp David, Fort Meade or NORAD mountain.

Because Elian really IS more profound to the world than
Bush, Giuliani or Bin Laden. Mark my words, 6 months from
now, most people in the world are going to go, "Rudolph
who?"

But say "Elian?" to them and they'll know exactly what
you mean. I'm certain of it.

IT'S ALL ABOUT OIL AGAIN, ISN'T IT??? : Native Americans 
Say It's Time for America to Re-Examine Itself

By Brenda Norrell  |  Independent journalist  |  December, 2001

TUCSON, Ariz. -- Native American poets, filmmakers and spiritual
leaders say America is being deceived by the national media about 
the intent behind the bombing of Afghanistan.
  It reflects the deception and murder of the voiceless that 
Indigenous peoples have long known.
  Simon Ortiz, Acoma Pueblo N.M. poet and professor in Canada, said
images of the bombing of Afghanistan are the nightmares Indigenous
peoples have always lived with.
  Ortiz said it is now carried out in the conquest for oil.
  "When I've seen the few photos of the destruction and killings caused
by U.S. bombs in Afghanistan, I immediately think of what Acoma and the
other Pueblos would look like if the same hellish madness were ever
visited upon them," Ortiz said.
  "People standing amidst the ruins and rubble of their adobe and stone
homes. Children and old men and women stunned, weeping quietly. It is
horrible to envision.
  "This is victory over the enemy?
  "And then I think of January 1599 when Acoma was laid to waste and
hundreds of Acomas died at the hands of Spanish conquistadors under 
Don Juan de Onate.
  "That was victory over the enemy?
  "No, that was an obscenity of death and conquest committed so that
Native land and its resources could be gained, just like what is taking
place now in Afghanistan and the Mideast -- obscenity of death and
conquest committed  so that control over oil resources can be gained."
  Ortiz, internationally-known author of "Woven Stone," and dozens of
other books of poetry and essays, like Navajo filmmaker Arlene Bowman,
relocated to Canada because of professional opportunities for
Indigenous peoples.
  Bowman, independent filmmaker living in Vancouver, British Columbia,
said the war on Afghanistan is an energy war and at home, President
Bush is rapidly undoing the preservations of sacred lands put in place
by the Clinton administration.
  "I observe mostly the drive by the federal government to get to the
energy sources in Canada and the United States fast!"
  "Bush is definitely a redneck of a president."
  Bowman, producer of "Navajo Talking Picture," shown in international
film festivals and "Song Journey," shown on PBS, was born in Fort
Defiance and grew up in Phoenix. She is concerned for Navajos at home
and elsewhere.
  "Probably Bush doesn't care about Aboriginal peoples and is racist.
What else is new?
  "He doesn't care if the Dineh people will not get enough water on
their land and if digging for uranium will affect Dineh people, leaving
them with cancer and radiation.
  "It's not his brain and body or children. Has anything really changed
for us?"
  Bowman said Bush has become an opportunist by way of the tragedies of
others, "ramming through" his energy policy while the mainstream media
has acted with complicity in a crime against humanity.
  "The opposition  voice is censored out literally. The United States is
becoming a 'banana republic,' a police state."
  Bowman said racism towards people of color has not diminished, but
major networks refuse to cover America as it is.
  "Just observe the major television news networks. It's all 'Rah! Rah!'
for the flag and gun-ho flag waving.

"The censorship bothers me a lot. Big Brother is watching and it's
real."
  Meanwhile, at the southern border of the United States, Pascua Yaqui
border rights activist Jose Matus says all of the work done in recent
years to halt abuse of Indigenous at the border was lost after the
attacks in New York.
  "We have lost whatever little ground we gained in our fight and
struggle to stem the tide of law enforcement abuse of authority and
violations of rights," said Matus, a Yaqui ceremonial leader.
  While the militarization of the United States and Mexico border
intensified, Matus said the so-called war on terror has terrorized
Indigenous people crossing the border with an intensified climate of
"racism, hatred, xenophobia and vigilantism."
  Matus and other members of Derechos Humanos in Tucson have documented
assaults and harassment if Indian people by border and immigration
officials. The human rights organization has also pressed for the
easing of visa requirements for ceremonial leaders. With more than
30,000 Yaqui living in Sonora, Mexico, the border has divided families
and is a barrier to cultural and spiritual gatherings.
  Matus said Bush continues to press for legislation, which will endanger
Indian people and result in further abuse of civil and human rights.
  "The September 11 attacks have taken away whatever little civil
liberties we had and have given rise to hatred and xenophobia against
immigrants of color more than ever before."

The profiling of people of color is a violation of rights Indigenous in
the borderzone have long known.
  "Why are people of color always profiled and not whites?" Matus asked.
  American Indians have long warned it is time for America to reexamine
itself and its treatment of Indigenous peoples and Mother Earth.
  In April, a presentation to Lehman Brothers stockholders at the World
Trade Center was censored by the media.
  Following a protest outside, a delegation of Navajo, Hopi and Lakota
elders and spiritual leaders addressed a stockholders meeting of Lehman
Brothers, the parent company of Peabody Coal which mines coal on Navajo
and Hopi lands on Black Mesa, Arizona.

Joe Chasing Horse, Lakota, told stockholders, "You have taken all of
our land, now we have come to show you how to take care of it."
  A traditional Hopi elder told stockholders, "Lehman Brothers, even
though we are just a few here, we speak for the Creator, who is the
majority."
  In comments never publicized by the mainstream media, the Hopi elder
said, "Therefore we demand you to stop the Peabody coal mining and the
slurry. We demand again," said the Hopi elder who asked that his name
not be published.
  "Traditional and priesthood people don't want this mining. The Hopi
prophecies say that we have to protect land and life. If we don't
protect our beautiful Earth -- our Heaven, our Mother, we will suffer
with her."
  "Our ancestors warned that someday this would happen. White men will
say that it is our own people that sold this land. I will not accept
this.
  "Our roots are rooted in our villages and it goes up to the whole
universe. If we break these roots the world will get out of balance.
  "I pray for you and hope that we open your eyes and you find the
majority in your heart."
  Before their deaths, Hopi elders Thomas Banyacya and Dan Evehema warned
that calamities would befall all of humanity if Navajos were forced to
relocate and the Earth was desecrated with further coal and uranium
mining on Black Mesa.

After returning from New York to Big Mountain, Ariz., in the so-called
Navajo-Hopi land dispute area, John Benally said the people have been
struggling for 32 years because of the turmoil created by Hopi and
Navajo tribal leaders intent on making money from the 92 billion tons
of coal beneath the ground at Black Mesa.
  Benally said the resistance actually goes back 500 years to the Spanish
invasion, followed by invasions of Europeans and Kit Carson.
  Benally said the Navajo, Hopi and Lakota delegation moved in solidarity
with the Zapatistas whose caravan through Mexico in the spring gave
them hope.
  "We felt the wind, it came from the South. It is telling the Indigenous
people to rise up for their beliefs, their culture. These things are
not being respected by anyone but the Indigenous people."

THE PHOLLOWING HAPPENED HISTORICALLY ON THIS DAY:

The War of 1812 ended today in 1816 with the Treaty of Ghent.
  Franz Joseph Gruber wrote "Silent Night" in 1818, and sang 
it for the first time tomorrow. Today's the day that the Library 
of Congress blew up in 1851 which destroyed 2/3 of the United
States' past history. I reflect on that as George "W" signs 
into law the bill which includes sealing up all documents to
do with his highly ethical and moral father. Somewhere in Camp
David tonite there's a fireplace being stuffed by the metric
ton, I'm sure.
  This was also the day when in 1889 the back-pedal bicycle brake 
was patented. The first public radio broadcast was today 1906.
And John Muir died in Los Angeles today - 1914, give him some of
your thoughts. The very air you breath would appreciate it, I 
think. 
  Hey, chapter one of "Winnie-the-Pooh" was published in the London 
Evening News in 1925, the rest really IS history, huh?
  1973, Doobie Brothers' Tom Johnson got busted for pot in Visalia, 
California. Name of the album his band was working on at the time?
"What Were Once Vices Are Now Habits."

We almost end this zine with reprinted song lyrics.



Frightened Lady by the Hollies.


Just like a top the world goes spinning round
Nobody knows what's going on I've found
Even from Jerusalem to old Japan
Nobody seems to have a definite, definite plan

Must be a peaceful way for us to go
Even the simplest of man must know
The situation's getting worse and worse
One day the bubble's gonna burst

But don't be frightened lady
We will never let them take your boy to war
No don't be frightened lady
We will never ever go to war no more

Why don't they finish it all
We are only people and we're terribly small
Why don't they finish it all
Do they think that people don't mean nothing, nothing at all

chorus

Students are marching now in every land
They won't be shifted just like grains of sand
If we don't get together pretty soon
We'll do the same thing on the moon
