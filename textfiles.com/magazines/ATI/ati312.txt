(http://www.gwac.net) - a GWU student's little story. he posted 
it to a public list, so i say it's ok, if there's any place/space

On Pickering,

Call your senators and voice full support for stringing 
the bastard up. Right after you throw him out for soiling 
the carpet.  The guy is a good ol' boy network bum.

Bush just shook the sabers.
  Rev up the military industrial complex.
  And if you disagree with us drilling in 
Alaska, violating clear air laws, backing 
Enron and basically doing whatever we want, 
then you're not a patriot.
  The doomsday clock just got closer to midnight.
  God and any other all seeing entity, help us all.

 "being twenty in america sucks." 
  -- moby, topified at zapatistas suggestion



PUBLISHER'S COLUMN      ==    16mar02   2pm (nyc time)

Associated Press Writer Sally Buzbee has written that Dick 
Cheney will tell the Saudis how important their base is to 
U.S. interests. 
  "We are just as dependent on Saudi bases and Saudi military 
facilities today as we were on Sept. 10," she quotes Anthony 
Cordesman saying. He's a Gulf expert at the Center for Strategic 
and International Studies in Washington. "As we face the risks 
of proliferation and asymmetric warfare in the Gulf, that 
partnership will not become less important -- it will become 
more important." 
  What will Cheney be told in response? The same thing Saudi 
Arabia said on the 9th of September. "Get the hell out." 
  OK, not in so many words, but still. Look it up. What was 
Saudi Arabia's policy shift regarding U.S. open ended staging 
grounds for perpetual low intensity conflict over Iraq? Hmm. 
At about the same time the US and Israel were pulling out of 
the famous Race Conferences, too. You know, the ones that were 
far more important to the entire rest of planet earth. But 
not so for Israel and the US. 
  "Doctor Henry Kissinger does not need this!" I imagine 
someone muttering under his breath in the third person.
  Saudi Arabia is going to tell Dick Cheney the same thing 
they said six months ago. They believe the US has gone too 
far with their so-called war against Hussein, neither the 
blockade, nor the war; not the sorti's, and most definitely
not the genocide. None of this has worked in any way that
the Saudis can recognize. 
  Enough is too much, they will say.
  10 years was all you'll get.

OK, different topic.
  Sorta.
  America's biggest problem is not her wars, her genocide, 
her endless red tape, her taxes, or her rude, ethnocentric, 
elitist, holier-than-thou self-defeatest disposition, 
although that's all part of it. No, her biggest problem is...

And lastly,
  In a recent poll (not zogby, and not allowing even a 
.045 coefficient of error, much less .4) people answered 
the following question like so:

 Britney Spears: How Do You Feel About Her?
 
57%  Shallow, brains of a walnut   
14%  Take her or leave her, like Hanson 
29%  Smart cookie, there's hope for her yet

A Parody
by One tough baked good

Sing these lyrics to the Billy Joel song Pressure

You have to learn to feed yourself
Pretzels
You chew like everybody else
Pretzels
You’ve already drank liquids
soft food
But eating whole food is real
Just like judicial voting review
And Enron friends Kenneth Lay
And they want you to eat
Pretzels
You used to stutter more on stage
Pretzels
But now your speaches are the rave
Pretzels
You turned to flag waving
John Wayne and God
Now here’s an Axis you will hate
And nuclear bombs you want to build
People in Kyoto you will forsake
And you still can’t swallow Pretzels
All grown up and no oil to drill
Alaska 1, Wyoming 2
Where is the thrill?
All you’re friends are Texas oil sluts
The world thinks you’re nuts
Maybe a Putz
Pretzels
Pretzels
Don't ask for help
You're all alone
Pretzels
You’ll have to stand 
in the rincon (corner -- Spanish) 
Pretzels
I’m sure you’ll have some Ranch style rationale
But here you are in the spot
Where all greedy plots are hatched
You’ll speak of God and families
But you still can’t swallow
Pretzels
Pretzels
All your life is privilege from birth
Millions net worth
Owning the Earth
Pretzels
I’m sure you’ll have some Ranch style rationale
But here you are with your faith
And your Peter Pan advice
You have no scars on your face
And you cannot handle Pretzels
Pretzels, Pretzels
One, two, three, four
Pretzels



& FOUND IN SOME LIST...

So I was flying out of BWI and I'm waiting to board the plane.  
I'm standing in line with my boarding pass, and surprise surprise, 
they tell me my name was flagged in the computer.  So they pull me 
aside to go through all of my shit. 
  The funny thing though, is that I was standing next to my idiot-
mafioso-fireworks-making congressman, boarding the same flight.  
He was getting searched too.  But it was so obvious that it was
planned because he wasn't in line with everyone else to begin with, 
so that congressmen can show their constituents that they make 
sacrifices for "freedom" too.  So I was chuckling to myself because 
the whole situation was just bizarre, and i turn to him and say "No 
special privileges for congressmen???"  and he responds "NO, NONE!!!"
  And after they finish with him he says to me (and this is my new
favorite quote!):
  "SEE THE SYSTEM WORKS!  THEY CATCH EVERYONE, EVEN CONGRESSMEN."
Which isn't exactly what I was thinking, as I handed over my fourth 
amendment right, so I replied:
  "Yeah, they also catch kids with Nader pins."
  He laughed.
  Dumbass.
  Have a good break

tHE wORld's riCHEST, aNOtHER reaSON not to sHOP at wal-mART

The rich just keep getting ...

(It's like a cybergame, look for your hidden exploiter)

By Brenda Norrell

By far the richest family in the world is the Wal-Mart family. There
are no John Boy's in this Walton family. Five family members have $103
billion, according to Forbes magazine.

The five Waltons of Wal-Mart rank 6-10 in the richest billionaires in
the world. They're much richer this year than last year.

Bill Gates at Microsoft comes in as the richest man in the world, with
$52.8 billion, and those aren't pesos either. But at least he is giving
back a little, with new computers going to each community on the Navajo
Nation and elsewhere on Indian lands. Microsoft's Paul Allen takes the
number four spot.

So, between the toilet paper and computer industries (Wal-Mart and
Microsoft) there's $181 billion, give or take a little pocket change,
more money than you can hide in a jar in the back yard.

The big cheese at Wal-Mart and Microsoft have the biggest chunk of the
world's personal wealth. They are 7 of the top 10 world billionaires.

In fact, nine of the top ten billionaires are from the good ole U.S. of
A. (The crowd cheers here, there's a steady roar...) There are 243 U.S.
billionaires in all.

There's only one out-of-towner on the top 10 list of
who-you-want-to-take-you-to-dinner: Germany's Warren E.
Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway at number 2.

Forbes lists the BIG extended families with the BIG descended
money separately. (They look a little poorer than they are.)

These are the world’s Dynasty billionaires, which means moldy old money
with lots of family members looking for handouts: Rockefeller tops with
$8.5 billion in the U.S. with Chase Manhattan Bank. Then comes Michelin
(France/tires), Mellon (U.S. Alcoa aluminum, Texas oil), Porsche/Piech
families (Austria/cars of course knothead), Bombardier (Canadian
planes, trains and snowmobiles), Rothschild (France and United
Kingdom/Swiss banks), Braun (Germany/Ludwig Georg/pharmaceuticals) and
alas Italy’s Lavazza (coffee and expresso maker.)

The next world dynasty guys have supermarkets, beer and retail stuff.

The other companies probably have their money broken up in small
chunks or hidden. The words "Big Oil and Coal" and LONDON have a
glaring absence on the lists.

Of 497 billionaires, only 7 percent are women, and only one of those is
a self-made billionaire, Doris Fisher of Gap. Forbes has its fingers
crossed for Oprah.

Microsoft’s software rival Oracle hangs in at number five, but the big
media giants are missing from the top, although Cox is still bringing
in big bucks in the top 25. Things should pick up this year for the
media with the war cheerleading and the "Wag the Dog" serial.

Mars bars and Nike make the top 50 list of pulling down profits. Well,
at least they’re fun (if you are a pinhead and live in the United
States.) Prices at Sweden’s funky Ikea house-wear seem too cheap to
make the list, but its number 16.

The largest number of world billionaires are in the lifestyles category
this year, media, travel and gambling. Except for Kerkorian's MGM
Mirage with $5.8 billion, most of the gambling guys from Asia and Trump
in the U.S. have only about $1 billion.

Kmart, AOL and Time Warner are on the bigtime looser list.

By the way, the guys guarding Peabody Coal on Black Mesa, Arizona, are
Wackenhut security, founded by a former CIA official. Forbes reports
the Danish Group 4 Falck plans to buy Wackenhut for $573 million,
marking the company's entry into the $14 billion U.S. security market.
(Peabody's parent company is Lehman Brothers where the media-censored
bold address to stockholders by Navajo, Lakota and Hopi took place last
spring at the World Trade Center.)

On the world billionaire list, the first interesting guy shows up in
the number 11 spot. It's Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Alsaud, Saudi
Arabia, 45, with a measly $20 billion showing from investments. (The
New York mayor gave back his $10 million donation for Trade Center
victims after Alwaleed said America should re-examine itself.)

The rest of the world's top billionaires don't seem to show up in my
address book, maybe you know them, and the amount a sweatshop worker
makes working a 16-hour day in Mexico ... Then of course there’s the
ride home in Juarez ...
