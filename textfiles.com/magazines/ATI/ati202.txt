VICTORY AT SEAttle
    This entire issue dedicated to Mateo

What's the moon look like?

I put in my Badi Assad album and begin marking
up ATI. I realize I didn't watch SNL this week.
What did I miss?

This week's Activist Times 'zine sees Yvonne
Magdaline as Mary. The role of Primanikus will
be played by Morris the Cat.

Hi I'm Prime Anarchist and this is ATI, Activist
Truth, Industries. This is issue 202. The "just
B-4 the y2k edition." MiLKenium. Heaven is truth,
your lies are your own personal hell, huh? Bring
it on peeps, bring it on. I like this transparency
routine. Good stuff. And they say, the truth shall
read you. 12dec99. Like a book.

Some say the activists won in Seattle this year.
Some say Buchanan. No one says the police state
gets the decision. Not even the police state 
himself. WTO? Can you say tail up your butt?
The long dusty whining trail home?

Santa Claus is doing well. Prices are at an
all-time stagnant. There's going to be some
happy kids around this planet. They can breath
a little easier now that, Hey, where are all
the trees? Who shaved all the thneeds???

Can you hear it? There's a message in the air
2nite. It's loud. Generation X is yelling it.
Gen who? What? You're kidding me! Those silly
silent slackers? They said what??? To who? 
You've got to be kidding me. 

Purpose. Hmmm. The world may end 2morrow, and
you will die. Well you will. So will I. Someday.
Not tomorrow, not next week. For now there is
happy. Happy happy, joy joy. I put Badi Assad
on repeat. NA MU MYO HO REN GE KYO!

Marc,
Were you in Seattle for the WTO thing?  
I am looking for somebody who could write 
about it from the anarchopacifist point of 
view for Ahimsa,
We are at:

We are a small network of nonviolent 
anarchists who are working to bring
together peace and freedom.

Thanks for the nice words.
I actually thought the coverage
would improve over the course of
the meetings -- I was wrong.
This is one of the worst 
blackouts I've seen.
Jay.

RUDOLPH, THE HARD-NOSED FASCIST
    By Sananda Dec 4, 1999:
     
    You know Safir, and Cohen, and Kerik, 
    and Turner; Kuriansky, and Goodman, 
    and Osterreich and Hess.
     
    But do you recall, the most famous 
    fascist of all?
     
    Rudolph, the hard-nosed fascist
    Had a very slimy nose
    And if you ever saw it
    You would even say it grows
     
    All of the other fascists
    Used to laugh and call him names
    They would never let poor Rudy
    Play in any fascist games
     
    Then one foggy Christmas Eve
    Satan came to say:
    Rudolph with your nose so mean
    Bust the homeless!
    Make the city clean
     
    Then all of the fascists loved him
    As they shouted out with glee
    Rudolph the hard-nosed fascist
    You'll go down in history!

[PAWN] - Excerpts From A First Person Seattle Account.
         by Prime Anarchist. Special to PAWN World Newz.

     The most worthwhile first person account of Seattle's Tuesday
victory over Multinational Corporations was very long. Rather than 
asking ATI's news board to consider going 50K for the next issue, 
I made a quick editorial decision to cull out excerpts that I 
thought were the most helpful to those of us who wish to know 
what really really went on besides what the no-longer-credible 
(my opinion, I stand by it) "legitimate press" may attempt to 
disseminate.
     The account is titled:
        By a WTO Protestor.
     It begins "I got on a Greyhound bus in Pittsburgh at 3:00am," 
The signature at the end has first and last name. I will only put 
here that his first name is Damon. The rest of this piece is in 
Damon's words. I will leave you with the following thought as you 
read this. "George Orwell lives." I'm sorry if all you know about 
Orwell is his big brother book, because that's not what I'm 
talking about at all. You'll see.
signed,
-=gonz=-

[FIRST PERSON ACCOUNT]
From time to time ambulances would come through and the crowd 
would clear a path immediately. Some protesters said, 
  "What if WTO delegates are sneeking in on the ambulances?" 
But people came to an immediate concensus that, although that 
was a possiblity, it wasn't worth risking people's safety.
Suddenly, a WTO delegate made it unnoticed through our lines. 
But when he made it to police they refused to let him enter. 
They turned back another delegate later.
 ---------------
<excerpts only. >
 ---------------
Against non-violent protesters, they used pepper spray, clubs, 
tear gas, and later fired rubber bullets and marbles at the
people. In every single instance I witnessed first hand, police
violently attacked non-violent protesters with no provocation 
whatsoever. That was the case when I was beaten and sprayed, 
that was the case when downtown was flooded with gas, with 
helicopters flying overhead shining spotlights down into 
the crowd.

The police chased them into a business area and fired tear 
gas into crowds that were now made up of shoppers and people 
getting dinner as well as protesters. Finally, after 12
hours of people being beaten and gased, a small riot broke 
out. A Starbucks coffee store was damaged and looted. 
I'm amazed it took this long to happen, and I say this 
in all honesty from being here first hand, that, by
repeatedly attacking and torturing non-violent protesters, 
the Seattle police sought to incite a riot and finally 
succeeded to a small degree.

One newscaster said, "Come on, get a life. We live in a 
prosperous country." In all honesty, the news is scaring 
me more than the riot police, because what it has done is 
justify further violence against the protesters. They have 
said that "police have been too lenient." The police have 
used teargas, pepper spray, clubs, rubber bullets, and 
marbles against peaceful civilians in downtown Seattle. 
The only thing they haven't done is used live amunition.
And in the event that greater violence occurs against 
protesters, the media will have justified it.

[PASS] a prime anarchist short snippet.
Rally this Sunday, December 12
    Stafford, California (basically if you're reading this
right now, you're missin')
   As another winter of high winds and freezing rain pounds Northern
California, 25-year old Julia Butterfly Hill will reach her second year
sitting 180' high in a giant redwood called Luna on Friday, December 10,
1999. A rally will be held to honor her efforts on Sunday, December 12,
at 10am in Stafford, California in Humboldt County, 240 miles north of San
Francisco on Highway 101. A benefit concert featuring Bonnie Raitt and
Joan Baez is scheduled for Wednesday, December 8 in Redway, CA.
    Julia has been keeping this tree-top vigil on a tarp-covered platform
to stop Maxxam/Pacific Lumber Company from completing a timber harvest
plan that dooms the 1,000-year-old redwood tree she has called home 
since 1997.

Second black mesa memory
   by marco
I pull up to a gas station in hopiland behind
a guy in a nice ride who's honking at the man
with the medium length black hair in the attendants
booth.
   There's a restaurant behind him. I remember having
had a hopi taco or a navajo taco - I never remember the 
difference. And a salad.
   The man's hollaring out his window, "could you hurry up? 
I got places to go."
   "I'll be out in a second." He's looking down concentrating
on something and there's a glow surrounding him. I cut the 
motor and go in and get a soda to go. Somewhere between 
lukewarm and cold.
   "Hurry up" says the man in the shiny car.
   "Hold your horses," man looking down.
   I come out, pop the soda top, wander over to the man 
looking down. Still aglow.
   "Wow," I say, "whatcha makin'?"
   "Kachina."
   "Gotta get to a stopping point for some belagonna."
   "I know whatcha mean," I tell him, and 
"Wow, that's wood? It's beautiful."
   "Thanks," he says. "I'm trying to finish it today." 
He smiles and looks at me for the first time. I smile back.
   I go back in my van and play some guitar. In a little while
he comes out and starts pumping gas for me first so the guy in the
shiny car calls him a "fkkng injn bsstrd, I was here first."
The man in the medium length black hair waves to him and doesn't
look up, just finishes my gas, makes change and goes back in to
put his money away before waiting on the guy in the shiny car.
   I drive off wracking my brain trying to remember who in my
family taught me to hold my horses. I don't remember 'til the
next day I'm herding sheep. It's my swedish boatbuilder grandfather
the carpenter in connecticut. He's about 85 now. Lives in one
of the Masonic Home and Hospitals. We don't agree on very much.
Just taking deep breaths first thing in the morning for a long
time before starting your day.
   I can't wait to visit him this December.
   He's one of my heros.
