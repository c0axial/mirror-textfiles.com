 I bet it still works.

DEAR ATI,
On that Desert Fox Angola thing.
Are you suggesting hundred(s) 
were killed in "Fox" and then 
the plane went down in Angola with 
the bodies?  Or did it go down 
on purpose with the bodies to cover up?  
Or did Muldar really see his sister?  
Sorry, confused on the Fox issue.
What are you saying???!!!!

Hi,
   Look again, at your message[following].
   Sure, quote me, if you like.
   And add, if it suits you, that as a
CIS professional, I recommend that people
set their computers to display in 12, or
14 point fonts, to reduce eyestrain,
and to help 50year old eyes like mine to
read it at all .
     Don't take this as permenant 
permission to quote me, I frequently respond
to newsletters with personal anecdotes,
and the last thing I want to do, is to read
them in distribution .
     I do try to remember to preface 
messages with all caps warnings, when I'm 
sensitive about how they're to be used.
Stay Stronger,
Ken.  (210)

Tone Can Ruin A Good Book
by C.D. Reviewer. Special to ATI 
for Book of the Week Club.

"THE SHADOW UNIVERSITY: The Betrayal
Of Liberty On America's Campuses,"
by Alan Charles Kors and Harvey A.
Silvergate. 
   This was the most boring book I've
ever read I think. The topic was so
compelling I tried to stick with it
from beginning to end, but I must confess.
I put it down many times. To be nice
I shall say it was dry reading.
   It was a brilliant collaboration
between two New Jersey men who met at
Princeton in the 60's and they set out
to tackle such issues as the famous
"Water Buffalo" case, and assaults on
student speech and also faculty speech.
   I couldn't wait to read it, but then  
I was quite let down by their writing
style.
   I think you should try to read it
anyhow. It's a very important book.
But good luck getting past the writing
style.


SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (Reuters) -- 
Mexico has resumed expelling foreigners from 
the embattled state of Chiapas, and in doing 
so has reignited a human rights debate. 
The government has made it clear that it 
considers many foreigners meddlesome activists, 
while human rights groups insist that Mexico is
targeting those seeking to be peaceful 
observers. The U.S. non-governmental organisation 
Global Exchange said on Wednesday one of its 
members was expelled on Monday from the southern 
state, the battleground of a five-year standoff 
between authorities and Zapatistas. 
Two other U.S. citizens were "invited" to leave 
the country while an Italian and a Japanese 
tourist were "interrogated" about their 
activities in Chiapas, Global Exchange 
representative Ernesto Ledesma told Reuters.

PRESS RELEASE:
A benefit concert for the Sovereign 
Dineh Nation is taking place at the
House of BLues in LA 17Jan Doors open: 
8pm, music: 9. Tickets are $25. 
Big names on the bill include Indigenous 
and John Trudell. Rumour has it that 
Stevie Wonder may show up. 
The event is part of the annual MLK/HofB 
Foundation awards. 
  [ed note: I confirmed all this through
   the people at NAMMYS (native american
   music awards) and also that Burning 
   Sky will be playing.=)

Black Mesa Indigenous Support (BMIS) 
will be bringing a van, rented by SOL
Communications and 6-8 Dineh to LA for 
one week. During that week the elders 
will participate in press conferences, 
radio shows, concert and ceremony. 
They may travel on to SF to attend 
the Many Beads court. As you know 
the Many Beads case has been
going on for years. 

I sincerely hope that BMIS finds the tools 
they need to get the elders through the
winter. They go up on the mountain each 
weekend, cutting wood, herding sheep, 
being a taxi or whatever they are asked. 
Please support this group.

      That is NOT a HOE.


THIS FROM THE "DO NOT PUB" BOX:
  Not a week goes by here at ATI we don't
have 2 or 3 stories kikkin 'round we choose
to sit on. Oh, myriad reasons from "still
checking accuracy," to "don't wanna get 
killed," with just about everything one
could imagine in between.
  Rest assured, no one's ever called askin'
the Times to kill a story in our 11-year 
history on the net or even before that on
pape. (sic.)
  We'd laugh if they did, to be honest. Our 
endeavors have been successful thus far with
a news-to-ad ratio of 1:0 for all these years.
  We're surely not wealthy, but solvent.
  So guess what? Mostly we just couldn't care
less. That's a pretty good feeling, actually.
Not to brag, but most other groups of newsies
have had to play that balance like an antique
Stradavarius tuned up to concert 440.
  So today, there's one story from that box
that we suddenly felt better of this morning
or so, so here goes:
  It's an official PAP prediction.
  Larry Flynt will "out" Phil Gramm this week
sometime; then Ted Kennedy will try to have
Flynt shot.
<ducking>
OK. Take it easy. Keep your head down. I must
go now, and put a pop-bottle on my doorknob.

Rehnquist Says He Can Already 
Taste Clinton Trial
---------------
by Lori Associa
Special corres.
---------------
<PAWN>
Washington - Chief Justice William P. Rehnquist 
criticized Kenneth Storr on Thursday for being
perhaps too lenient on the "ex-president-elect."
   "Only four articles??" Rehnquist rhetoricized
in his annual year-end report on Democrat-
bashing and its attempt to get declared an 
Olympic sport by 2008.
   "I think you were a little easy on the Beev,
Wally," the Justice said amid uproarious laughs,
heaves and guffaws.
   During his top-secret one-hour tour of the 
Senate chamber and its anti-rooms Thursday, he
allowed this author to get a quick interview
in under tight security. 
   "I've been just licking my chops," he told
me, "ever since Desert Fox began."
   He offered me a cigar from the pocket of
his half off jacket, then apologized for not 
asking if smoking was OK.
   He explained he was very tired from 57,691
cases in one year and that he just wanted to
relax with a pretty young girl on her way up
over a nice fresh "Cuban seed Cuban."
   He said he'd love to share one with me,
popping Viagra like a fiend.
   I told him I'd gotten all I needed, that
I wasn't offended and that if he didn't mind
I was going to kick him really hard somewhere
and then take my leave.
   The already half-naked old law-subvert
reached down to cover where he thought I
might attack leaving himself completely open
to the idea of my sticking his smelly old
Cuban contraband where he'll never find it
without corrective surgery.

SMURF-STONED MERGER SETS OFF PAPERWARS
<PAWN>
New York - The paper industry will likely 
see more death and carnage in 1999 with
Smurf purchasing Stoned Container Corp.,
Texacold, Amicable and British Far-Troleum
all in one 24-hour period just three days
before 1998's end, an analyst said.
   Despite all the new acquisitions, the
analyst said, the month-old mega-corporation
will keep its current name, Smurf-Stoned.
On the pallet for 1999, according to sources, 
is the purchase of cardboard boxes, heavy
brown paper, hundred dollar bills, and
balance sheets of anyone else who wants to
"just roll over and die."
   Smurf-Stoned is also considering working
with International Scraper and Union Cramp
to market the idea of wrapping dead people
in brown paper instead of the more expensive
and eco-unfriendly caskets.

IT STARTED WITH A SWEAR: An Exercise In Hostility.  
by Monique Nixon
Special To Prime Anarchist World News 
(PAWN) - Seymour, WI.
   Oh, and two Furby dolls.
   Since there were plenty of Furby's left 
at Walkmart, Toes 'R Us, and Wilworth-Wilco 
I bought two at my local retailer. Set me back a
mere 30 bucks. From then 'til yesterday (Jan 1) 
I'd had them in seperate rooms digesting much TV.
   One got its learning entirely from non-stop NBC.
The other was glued to MTV 24-7.
   As I suspected there was a generation gap of
sorts from the very beginning. I faced them 
toward each other in a walk-in closet with a voice-
activated microcassett recorder nearby. I planned
to change a 90-minute tape on slow speed every 4
or 5 hours.
   Neither said a word to each other for twenty
whole minutes, so I altered the experiment,
deciding to get things rolling saying the word, 
"shit."
   I guess the NBC-fed doll had never heard the
word because she, he or it started in with "what
the hell did you just say? Because I don't 
understand you, and it sounded like crap." How
he'd learned Wolf Blitzer's voice perfectly in
both tone and syntax I'll never know.
   Well the MTV Furby must not be used to the
word "crap" because s/h/it broke in with "Oh
my God. That was, like rad, I mean no way, man
take a picture of my butt. Does she go down on
you in a theatre? Scratch your fingernails down
my back, oh nice ass, let's eat at Hooters."
   I swear s/he sounded just like Jesse, the
enviro-retarded heroin-addict wannabe VJ.
   I didn't hear NBC's retort but when I 
returned to change cassettes one of the dolls
was on top of the other doing something
horribly obscene saying "calls are just
35 dollars a minute, order now, operators are
standing by," while the other was just laying
there saying, "it's freezing in here, I don't
think you love me anymore... is there a room
I can darken? I need to perform an autopsy."

And now, Mauro's message:
---------------
I have a 28:30 second "underground" 
cable show called "The Battle of Big
Mountain". I had given Klandiken some 
copies and ISCO in Oregon. This is
not the documentary that we have been 
working on, but it does contain
footage that no doubt is in that piece.
Anyway many people have asked me about 
the cable show. I will send a copy
to any BIg Mountain group that wants it. 
Since I will be paying for the copies and 
mailing I just ask that only groups or 
people that intend on educating with it 
reply. Also, any group working with the 
nuclear issues please contact me as well. 
We made a similar piece during Corbin Harney's
event at the Mercury gate last spring 
and it came out great. Both pieces
have great interviews, The Battle of 
Big Mountain with John Benally,
Roberta Blackgoat, Marsha Monestersky, 
Norman Benally and others. There is
also a music video called Amerika 
that I made as well.
For the record, no exempt monies 
were used in these productions.
