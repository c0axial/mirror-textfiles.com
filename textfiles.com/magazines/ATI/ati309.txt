"The Americans knew that I often spoke to Fidel and that 
any subject at hand would be dealt with seriously and securely. 
For instance, when they wanted to send a secret envoy, as they 
once did in the person of former Deputy CIA Director Vernon Walters, 
I would tell Fidel outright:
  "The Americans want such and such" or "The CIA says such and such."

POEM TO BE DEVELOPED: The Nurse In The Birka

Evans Army Hospital

She taught me the differences between Shiite, 
Sunni, Sikh and even Bahai and American Islamist.

She monitored my morphine.

She told me about her army husband stationed in Kuwait.

I don't remember her name; should have written it down.

You might say she saved my life;
But I'll definitively say she saved my soul.

The Nurse in the Birka
Nurtured my soul.

Thank you!

Hello, and welcome to activist times, the zine with 
the attitude of a thousand something-or-others.

I'm prime anarchist, and this is the zine for Monday,
February 18th, 2002. It's 17 hundred hours my time.
That's like midnite Greenwich Mean Time or something.
Hmmm. I wonder what it is Greenwich Nice Time?

So enjoy this 'zine. You only get one a week or so.

marco

===================

We start with an open letter as a column. I'll be
snailmailing and emailing this to her as well, just
as soon as I find a stamp. And as soon as this zine
has run its course.

OPEN LETTER TO DOTTIE LAMB:

Dear Dottie,
  May I call you Dottie? I remember knowing of you when
I was awaiting my medical discharge from the US Army 
Signal Corps in Colo Sprgs and you were the former first
lady. You and your letters.
  During my military years the Rocky Flats site was 
beginning to show itself on its way out, despite Pat 
Schroeder's years of denial there. 
  I read Workers World pretty regularly, and the Rocky
Mountain News more often than the other Denver Daily or my
local even.
  Bikes Not Bombs, Peace In Space and the local soup kitchens
are really what radicalized me my last year-and-a-half of 
service, you know.
  You're going to laugh, my last 6 or 7 months was spent 
working at Fort Cartoon during the day and changing into
civilian clothes every night at 4:30pm and riding bike to
route 115 as fast as I could to join in the 24/7 protests
against Iraq war by sleeping on the median between Acacia
Park and the USO building. Some days there were 30 of us
sleeping on that little median, other days 300. It seemed
like the colder it was, the more of us would be there. 
  The physical warmth of the men and women sleeping next
to you went along with the emotional warmth as well. It 
really made for such a stark contrast that I can only 
articulate so well on paper.
  30 inches away form four men and women all day 9-5ish
for the army with distinct cold, fear, anger, rage, 
resentment and all else that goes along with marching in 
formation.
  3 inches away from two or three people from dark to
sunrise with peace, love, hopes, fears, anger, rage and
hostility being processed with as much peace and love as
it could be surrounded with.
  Every morning a Baby Ben clock would go off about 5
sleeping bags away from me and John, a Sergent in a 
neighboring unit would wake up, hop on his motorcycle 
and head back to about the same place I was biking back 
to each morning.
  Yes, what a half a year that was. I miss enough of that
with such passion that I almost forget all the horror we
dealt with too. threat of nuclear bombs, paramilitary
death squads, repression all around us, the works.
  Now we're going back into Iraq hot and heavy and even
good ol' boy, Al Gore is saying he hopes "Junior" can
accomplish what his dad couldn't. The destruction of
Saddam Hussein? Boogeymen around every corner, alligators
under every bunkbed.
  I hear the word "Axis" out of Bush's crooked mouth 
and I tremble with the fear of knowing history, guessing 
the future.
  Dottie, I so want to feel patriotic like you, 
nationalistic maybe, proud of my homeland, the place 
I was born. But frankly I feel like I'm sitting in 
some salon in 1930's Germany wondering if I'm the only
one who can't hate jews, gypsies, artists and gays.
  After hearing Bush's word-choices such as "crusade" 
"evil doers" "axis of evil" I wonder if I'll be surprised 
when he announces a new salute to signify that we're the 
"new americans" or something.
  September should be a wakeup call, but one pointing out
something far beyond Bush's axis of evil.
  The true "axis of evil" if there even is such a thing
is likely to look more like England, Italy and the Untied
States, give or take Japan.
  Anyhow, main theme of this entire email should have
been my thanking you for showing yourself a thinking 
person in this month's MonteLibre newspaper. Your dynamic 
mind is what appeals to me most. Were it not for people 
like you, the final extension of my anti-globalism beliefs 
and philosophies would be the automatic hatred of all rich 
people wholesale. 
  Not just the "evil" ones.

There's a neat way to hide your email from robots,

Hey there,

This is just a quick introduction of the small record label 
that I run out of my bedroom in Toronto, Ontario. The label 
is called AntiAntenna Recordings, and you are getting this 
message because I've done some research and found that the 
publication you're working with would be interested in 
getting press releases from the genres of music that I'm 
working with.

So, I'll keep this short. Add "info@antiantenna.com" to 
any mailing lists you might have for people like me. If 
your publication has a section for an indie label showcase 
or spotlight, please feel free to contact me for an interview. 
If your site has a links section, I would gladly trade links 
with you. I've already seen your site, and I think we're both 
on the same track.

contact info for my label is:

AntiAntenna Recordings
4-1528 Queen Street West
Toronto, Ontario
Canada. M6R 1A4

Thanks very much,

Good day
I'm starting a newsletter about poetry and was wondering 
if you or anyone you know would be interested in joining? 
If so please e-mail me at poetrylist@aol.com.
Thanks for your time
Bobby

P.S
If you'd consider placing a line or two about my up and 
coming newsletter I'll return the favor when I can.

OFFICIAL NOTICE: Change Of Voting Location
Your polling location for all future elections is:

  __  _____ _______  ____
   ___ ____________ __

The City Of ______ has completed the redistricting 
efforts that are required after each census and this
time we tried to make things as difficult as possible.
All borders of aldermanic/supervisor districts have
been redrawn resulting in a shift of some voters into
new wards. The redistricting has also made it necessary
to change 12 polling places, so even those voters who
remain in the same ward may now vote at a new location.

Thank you.
Office of the Clerk/Treasurer

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

Side effects with Allegra for seasonal allergies (TM) are 
low and may include headache, cold, back pain, flu, nausea, 
menstrual pain, drowsiness, back pain, sinusitis, dizziness, 
back pain, coughing, accidental injury, back pain, or back 
pain.

Guy walks into his doctor and says, "I have this horrible
back pain." 
  "Didn't we give you pills to clear that up last month?"
The doctor asks.
  "Yeah, I took them and would you know, those painkillers
gave me the munchies? So I ate a whole bag of Baked Lays
(TM) and a bunch of other stuff so I got indigestion, well 
I took a bunch of my leftover Purple Pills (TM), yeah, 
Prilosec (TM), which gave me rectal bleeding and horrible 
gas. I took Mylanta (TM), and had some kind of allergic 
reaction (TM) so I took some of those Allegras (TM) you'd 
given my wife. Next thing I know I have more back pain."
  "But didn't you come in for back pain three days ago?"
  "Yes, but whole different story, Doc. See, I was
taking those Viagras (TM) they sent me in the mail as free
samples? Well, let's just say the wife and I had a really
great day."
  "So you threw your back out having sex?"
  "No! The sex gave me the munchies and shortly after
that I had an allergic reaction (TM) to something I ate, 
so I took more of those Allegras..."
  "Ah, back pain side effect?"
  "No! The lady and I were arguing about who would get up 
and turn off the light for the evening. We were wrestling
a bit and well. I punched myself in the head, fell out of
bed, rolled on the floor, knocked over the half empty bottle 
of Allegras (TM) all over me and in the radiator on the
floor. I was reaching for one of those falling pills and 
hit my head on the table which knocked over the light onto
the floor. I don't know why, when I reached down to pick
up the light my back went out."
  "Accidental injury?"
  "Yeah, accidental injury."
  "Hmmm. That's a common side effect."
  "Yeah, I know. You got any painkillers?"

SOME GUY SAVED AN ENDANGERED SONG.
  My J20 BushHillbillys parody. He's a Cooledit
whiz too. Gave me two tutorials on noise reduxx 
to read as well.
  Anyhew it's a song I wrote in notepad.exe, rehersed
two or three times, and then called DC indymedia web
radio and sang it to them over the phone. I literally
propped the phone up on Dante's "Inferno," Gideon's
"Bible," Random's "Thesaurus" and Orwells "1984."
  So the phone faced right between my mouth and the
guitar somewhere. (note to self: next time right up
to the guitar, just sing toward it) 
  I sang my lungs out and then went about my business.
At some point I closed notepad.exe without saving and
poof. The song was gone for good. Right? No biggie, it
was topical. Probably time-specific, like a shelf-life.
Right?
  J20
  Inauguration
  Bush Hillbillys. Hmm.
  (next note to self: songs about Prescotts, Dulles'
Bushs' have no freshness stamp. They will ALWAYS carry
meaning.)
  So I put the song behind me, spring, summer, fall.
  And then...
  "Didn't you do a J20 song live on the DC stream?" 
this guy asks me in an irc chat. 
  I think so. Don't remember what I sang exactly, but
"yeah. I think so."
  "Want an .MP3? I cleaned up the tinneyness from the
phone in cooledit and it actually sounds pretty good."
  Wow, he sent it to me. It exists again. 
  He saved an endangered song. 
  Cool!

Woah, is "Mellow Yellow" about heroin? I never thought

Part of a poem about the Waldorf Astoria

   Oh Lawd, I done forgot Harlem!
   Say, you colored folks, hungry a long time in
   35th Street they got swell music at the Waldorf-Astoria. It sure
   is a mighty nice place to shake hips in, too. There's dancing
   after supper in a big warm room. It's cold as hell on Lenox
   Avenue. All you've had all day is a cup of coffee. Your
   pawnshop overcoat's a ragged banner on your hungry frame.
   You know, downtown folks are just crazy about Paul Robeson!
   Maybe they'll like you, too, black mob from Harlem. Drop in
   the Waldorf this afternoon for tea. Stay to dinner. Give Park
   Avenue a lot of darkie color--free for nothing! Ask the Junior
   Leaguers to sing a spiritual for you. They probably know 'em
   better than you do--and their lips won't be chapped with cold
   after they step out of their closed cars in the undercover driveways.
   Hallelujah! under-cover driveways!
   Ma Soul's a witness for the Waldorf-Astoria!
