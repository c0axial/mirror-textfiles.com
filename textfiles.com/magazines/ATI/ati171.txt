Next up after numbers, is letters, but
first a word from our publisher, the

The power of poetry is the letter P.
It's sexiness is seen in the letter S.
     Spooning.
The songs I ditched when you left me.
     Oh.
     Or?
The songs I left when you ditched me.

Bill Murray on SNL makes me almost
think this world is mine. Of course
Drew Barrymore makes me almost sure.
Shirley, Garbage were great, you were
2, but what's with that stupid dress
you wore? It looked like a gigantic
neck-tie. Was that some kind of 
message for Monika and Bill?? 
If I had to live through tribulation
I would want you there with me Bill.
Man, you rock my world Bill. I love 
you, man.

Let me stand next to your fire: Jimmy

And now, here's OJ Simpson for the

Dear Marco,
  Sounds like your are having 
a great time and bringing 
pleasure to many.

P.S. I'm trying to publicize the 
Hague Appeal for Peace and the 
need for a Mega Coalition to help 
the U.S. turn around its priorities--
or "grow up" spiritually."  
Could you append this to your 
E-mails, or send it out to your list?

    Are you into helping us publicize 
the Hague Appeal for Peace? We GOTTA 
get people coming to the Hague 
Mega-coalition that hopefully will 
get at the root causes of the

    Many thanks for any help you 
can give.

Hey Governor Ventura,
George The Animal Steele is smarter 
than you.
He would have embraced the Native 
Americans protecting their ancestral 
burial grounds in your state the day 
after he was sworn in, or maybe 
even sooner!!!
Sincerely,

ps:
Please eddikate U-self on the issue 
if you have no idea what I'm talking 
about, ok?
pps: Show me you meant it when you 
wore that frilly buckskin vest 
lookin' all wannabe, or else I may 
have to deal with you the way my dad 
used to deal with Chief Jay 
Strongblow in front of Fred Vlassic 
and everything.


i don't know if you'll get this 
message anytime soon, you seem to 
have a number of different addresses.
at any rate, i did a dejanews 
search for myself (slight paranoia 
attack, you know) and came across a 
message posted in alt.native (i 
believe).
that message, entitled "buffy #3/3" 
included a link to my (now moved)
website.
so, i just wanted to drop a line 
asking how you came across my site, 
what you liked about it, what made 
you link it into your newsletter 
and also to advise you of the address 
change (see the .sig below).
oh, and i looked at some of your 
pages.  
nice stuff....

SCHOOL OF THE AMERICAS WATCH AT
ST. NORBERT COLLEGE
--
By Matthew Reedy
--
For the past three years, St. Norbert
students and a handful of Green Bay
residents have been active members of
the School of the Americas Watch.
The SOA is a military training 
facility located on the campus of Fort
Benning, GA. The SOA has trained over
60,000 Central American soldiers since
1946. The annual budget for the SOA is
over $18 million, funded by our tax
dollars. SOA Watch was founded by Fr.
Roy Bourgeois, a MaryKnoll priest.
Fr. Roy began the SOA Watch upon his
discovery of human rights abuses 
committed by SOA graduates. Fr. Roy
is a Purple Heart veteran of the 
Vietnam [collateral damage capades,
a semi-annual event] and a missionary
to the poor in Central America. He 
witnessed first hand the misery 
caused by U.S. policy in Central
America. For the past nine years,
peace activists have been protesting
the SOA and calling for its closing.
SOA officials claim that the school
promotes democracy, freedom, and 
human rights in Central America.
This stark contrast in viewpoint has
caused the SOA and its existence to
become very controversial at SNC, as
well as in [Wisconsin and] the House 
and Senate.
St. Norbert students will be travelling
to Washington, DC to lobby and protest
the SOA, Friday, April 30 thru Monday,
May 3. Please call Matt Reedy or
visit http://www.soaw.org to learn
more about the School of the Americas.

    SAN FRANCISCO--SATURDAY'S 22nd 
annual presentation of the Bammies 
at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium 
didn't just bridge the north and 
south of California, it spanned 
generations.
  Paul Kantner and Joan Baez were 
joined by a new generation of LA 
flash musicians, including Harvard
educated guitarist Tom Morello 
from Rage Against the Machine, 
Smashmouth's Steve Harwell and 
No Doubt's Gwen Stefani.
   Bob Weir and jam-mates Rob
Wasserman on bass, Merl Saunders 
on keyboards and Dave Ellis on sax
hooked up with the Long Beach Dub 
All-Stars, whose former leader,
Bradley Nowell, died of a drug 
overdose.
  And most importantly, Bonnie Raitt 
won the Arthur M. Sohcot award for 
public service, and in keeping with 
her ways, promised to give the award 
to the woman who has been perched in 
a tree for a year to save the 
redwoods, Julia ``Butterfly'' Hill. 
Always one to go above and beyond, 
Raitt said she will climb up the 
tree to give it to Hill. 
  Is this the same Bonnie Raitt who
donated thirty-five Fender acoustic
guitars to Boys and Girls Clubs in
Green Bay, Wisc? Go Bonnie; go 
Bonnie; go Bonnie, go...

<PAWN>INDIAN GETS OUT OF JAIL
by Alison Lovendowski, a Prime 
Anarchist World News Special
Report. -Dateline 21mar99-
MENOMINEE, WI. - Medical Marijuana
charges against Walkin Refrigerator
were dropped Tuesday when Menominee
County Sheriff Walkin Tonka drove
up and threatened to bust him out
of jail if the entire tribe doesn't
legalize pot.
   "C'mon, Warden," Tonka was heard
pleading, Monday night, "The guy's
got glaucoma in his eyes so thick
it's coming out his ears, his lungs
are bleeding, polyps hanging off 
his butt looking like string cheese
and his left testicle hurts, for 
crying out loud. Give the guy an
aspirin or legalize pot."
   "Let me get this straight," said
Warden Whipper T. Nordistrugle, "you
say Refrigerator's got glaucoma, 
bleeding lungs, polyps, walking 
pneumonia, and blueballs, and you 
want either one aspirin or marijuana
legalized?"
   "I said, the guy's got glaucoma
in his eyes so thick it's bleeding out
his ears, his lungs are shot, tumors
all over his ass, and blueballs. 
Pneumonia would about kill him right
now. Give him an aspirin or legalize
dope!"
   Nordistrugle looked through the
rulebooks for dispensing of aspirin,
and dispensing of herbs legal and 
illicit. The herb book was 29 pages,
yet the aspirin book was 432 pages 
long. Apparently aspirin is not allowed
within 50 miles of any prisons in the
continental united states.
   "Holy Hoohah," were the last words
Nordistugle used that night. The following
morning he marched into Menominee Tribal
Conference Hall and Bingo Mall, shouted
at the top of his lungs, "Medical Pot
Will Be Legal From Here On In. MPL43-102."
   He then took a black and gold oversized
pen with the words Untied States Senate,
and signed the tribal bill into law.
   Refrigerator was released on his own
trust, and Sheriff Walkin Tonka was last
seen in the Purgatory Lounge, (yes, across
from St. Pringles Parish) complaining 
about how he never got to use his 3 inch
thick hemp rope and his shiny new bumper
hitch.

EX-MARINE OFFENDED ABOUT SPORTS TEAM NAME.
(PAWN) - Minneapolis. Erik Larsen is 
offended about the name "Vikings."
  "I know Amerikans never appease people
of colour unless they take care o' the
white people first," said Larsen to our
special War Whore Core Despondent, Walt
Street. "So maybe if they rename the 
Vikings to the Niggers or the Wannabes - 
next up for change may be the Redskins
or the Braves, right?" Larsen is a
former linebacker for the US Marines,
aside from his grandmother's side of
the family who were real live Vikings
"when they were alive," he calls himself
mostly white.
