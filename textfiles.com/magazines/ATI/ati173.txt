Happy Spring Ahead, Happy Fertility,
Happy Easter. And while you're at it
you might as well set your clocks - on
everything you got that counts - to 1971
  See? Voila. Instant y2k compat. 
  Even your toaster!
  As if.
  Who bought a toaster with a timer?
You, id-i-OT! Did, you, not, know,
you can be kicked, out, of Dexter's
La-boooor-atoory, for that?
  Now, I shall have to, disable your
timer, so it will be y,2,k comPATible
for I do NOT, think you will reMEMber
1971 or 1972.

CRACKER: I NAMED IT AFTER A WOMAN
WHO WOULDN'T GO OUT WITH ME.
---------
by Nilda Perella
Prime Anarchist World News

Princeton, NEW SHIRT - One week after
the stunning e-mail virus named 
"Melinda" began stomping out forest
fires all over the world, 
authoritarians said Friday they had
beaten up a man who created the 24
hour bug in his bathroom and named
it after a woman who refused to have
sex with him.
   David S. Long, 6, was arrested 
Thursday night in a gentlemen's 
club restroom.
   "I was going to name the virus
Erpes," said Long, "but it was too
short. The most common charges 
against Long include Coy Interruptus, 
Conspiracy and Theft of Conspiracy,
Phone Sex, Lamerism and Dweebishness.
   Long was released on $35 bond and
told to sit in the corner for a time
out.
   "He had a little willy," said
Melinda S. Tripper, in an exclusive
P.A.W.N. interview on top of a table
in a dark smokey room. "That's all 
I'm going to say, and you can quote
me," she said shaking her you know 
whats, obviously still effected from
yesterday's happenstance. She went
on to say she wouldn't date him if
he were "the last Cracker on earth."
   "Besides," said Melinda, "he's
got pimples. Ew. And he uses AOL;
yuck!"

PAWN - OWA - (obit w/ attitude)
Memphis, TENN. Graceland was in chaos
this morning when Elvis Presley was 
hit by a stray cruise missile.
  "I think Elvis was happy to die," 
said Barry Rustler, chief executive 
officer of Money Worldwide, which
represents the estates of dozens of
the world's biggest celebrities.
   Born in 1869, according to 
Rustler, Elvis was 130 years old.

   DOW MATCHES WAITING LIST AT 
DC SOUP KITCHEN 
Georgetown, - "10,023 people will 
not eat today," said Yahoo A. 
Digital, a worker at the Olive Branch
FoodNotBombs daily feed in Washington
DC's smallest inner city, "unless
more food comes in quick." He was 
heard repeating this to all eleven
postal workers who will begin a 
cropwalk from DC to Bangor, Maine
looking for them that caused their
hunger.
   "Perhaps look at Bath Ironworks,"
said Digital for the dozenth time,
"or Raytheon, Newport News and the
Oval Oriface.

ADDICTED TO COFFEE - Retort : ROBERT PALMER
The lights are on, but you're not home
Your coffee pot, empty, alone          
Your heart sweats, your body shakes
Another cup, is what it takes

You're in deep, you ought to eat
There's no doubt - you're half asleep
Your throat is dry, you're like a seed
Another cup is all you need

Chorus:
You like to think that 
you're imune to the stuff 
Oh yeah

 It's closer to the truth 
 to say you can't get enough
 You know you're gonna have to face it
 You're addicted to coffee

You see the signs - but you can't read
You're running at a different speed
your heart beats in double time
another cup and you'll be fine
   
A one-track mind; you can't be saved
Oblivion is all you crave
If there's some left over for you
You don't mind if you do

Might as well face it: 
you're addicted to coffee
(repeated many times over
the same scheme as the refrains) 

Solo:

The lights are on, but you're not home
Your coffee pot, empty, alone
Your heart sweats your teeth grind
Another cup and you'll be fine

Chorus:

Might as well face it 
you're addicted to love (8x)
