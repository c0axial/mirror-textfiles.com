Beginning TIE DYE
   by TiDi Sushi.
Tie Die is an ancient craft.
Very old fragments of cloth have
been found all over the world.
The first people to do tie dye 
may have discovered it by accident
when they were dying cloth and 
some folds did not dye. Tie dye 
somehow became a way of making 
patterns and designs on 
cloth by a "resist" method.
Traditionally, knots are tied,
the cloth is heated in liquid 
dye, and the knotted areas 
"resist" the color. When the 
cloth is untied, the patterns
show up as white against a
colored background.
People have invented many ways
to make "resist" designs. Fold,
sew, wrap around objects to 
name just a few. 
Play around. 
use imagination.
Have fun.

Hi there.
I found you from the E-Zine List. 
I'd really like a review please.

You've got them scattered

I've seen you've used the mystical 
flute player Kokopeli.
  [ed note: I didn't "use" him;
   we love each other, 
   but yeah...]        I am sure 
you're aware (and I find it quite 
fascinating) that the figure is 
represented in virtually every 
ancient American culture in almost 
the same guise. There are some fine
examples scattered around the 
southwest including the Hopi Flute 
Clan and the Flute Clans of other 
SW peoples.

Dear Mr. Benchley:
	Thank you for taking the 
time to read this letter. I have 
enjoyed you(r) books very much!  
I, in turn, am working on a 
writing project that entails
contacting writers, editors, 
and publishers who have a bit 
more familiarity with the horror 
genre than most others do, and 
asking them to vote for their
own personal choice of the three 
best horror films of all time.   
    I would be most honored if 
you could therefore e-mail your 
response to this thorny question: 
What are the three best horror 
films of all time?
    Best of luck to you in all 
your endeavors!
Yours Sincerely,
William

have mistaken one of us for someone

You're going to have an awards 
ceremony for a genre of music where 
144 whole albums were released?
Can't wait for the Jewish American 
Music Awards (JAMMIES), or more
importantly, the Independent American 
Awards For Music Recorded In Small To
Medium/Large Studios When Initial 
Setup For The Recording Event Began 
On A Tuesday (IAAMRSMLSWISREBT-IES).
Recognition is a good thing.

Do you recall which flavor of

Do you or any member of your

--OP ED--
Recent millions of dollars have 
been spent to stir up controversy 
around Rigoberta Menchu's life. 
Rumor, and rumors of rumors are being 
spread. As campaigns go, it is more 
resembling a war minute by minute.
This is a VERY BAD time for Menchu to 
get smeared.
We're still trying to get to the bottom 
of who killed Bishop Gerardi last year, 
and this is NOT going to help.
The only thing I know negative about 
Rigoberta so far is her inability to 
denounce Mexican president Ernesto
"Cold War" Zedillo, for it's he who 
granted her asylum when her brothers
and sisters were being hunted down 
and killed. She lost two more first 
cousins and another brother after 
"I Rigoberto" was published.
Of course, she's afraid to denounce 
him his oppression of Chiapanecos.

That would be like demanding that
Andres Segovia badmouth Spain!

I don't think whether her book is a 
true autobiography or did she have 
ghostwriters, whether it all happened 
to her, or was it based on many events 
and many people. I don't think any of 
this is nearly as important as finding 
out who assassinated Gerardi the Sunday 
two days after his chilling book about 
10 years of genocide in guatemala
was published last year. It's not 
nearly as important as shutting down
the school of the Americas in Benning 
Georgia where the people who killed 
almost everyone Menchu knows got their 
training. I dont' think it's nearly as 
important as putting an end to death 
squads, especially ones trained here 
in the United States, most especially 
if we are going to prance around saying 
how focused we are on human rights.
The dark cloud over turtle island just 
got 5 shades deeper when people began 
smearing Mylady Menchu. I wonder how 
many dollars US, are being spent on 
THIS mission?????????????
Let's remain focused on justice please. 
I think badmouthing her is harmful 
right now. We can deal with the 
accuracy/inaccuracy of her book AFTER 
amnesty international's done charging 
the US, AFTER the UN's done charging 
the US, AFTER every country who's 
signed on to ban landmines is done 
charging the US.
