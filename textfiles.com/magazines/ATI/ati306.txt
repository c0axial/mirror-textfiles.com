DEATH OF ART: In the Media Mix, What Happens to Music?

My third favorite Melanie Safka song is "What Have They
Done To My Song, Ma." I like it so much I have it on four
albums. "Candles In The Rain," "Best Of," "Beautiful,"
and "The Four Sides Of." We ought to take a look at what
they've done to EVERYONE'S songs!
  
"At the end of November, the day after George Harrison died,"
Norman Solomon reports in FAIR's Media Beat, "the NPR program 
'Fresh Air' treated listeners to reminiscences and tributes to 
his work. The show ended with Harrison's transcendent song 
'All Things Must Pass' -- while a voice-over intoned a slew 
of underwriter credits, closing with a promotional pitch for a 
'wealth management' company. As an interlude, airing on what 
passes for public radio, the incongruous mix was business as 
usual, offering artistic quality while undercutting it with 
routine corporate-driven messages. Guitars gently wept."

(I'll lift one more quote from Solomon's story - if you want 
the rest get it yourself at commondreams.org or fair.org, ok?)

[ref]=[ http://www.fair.org/extra/writers/solomon.html ]

"Economic powerhouses are well-positioned to trivialize music 
by foisting audio schlock onto vast audiences of innocent 
bystanders -- and also by recycling popular music to hook 
people into buying specific products. Large quantities of 
rock songs, ranging from the mediocre to the marvelous, have 
become snippets of soundtracks for TV commercials. It all 
adds up to a concerted assault on meaning, with music very 
functional as a heavy battering ram."

What are my first two favorite Melanie songs? 

  You had to ask. 

  "Close To It All" and her version of "Purple Haze," I think. 

  With dozens of close 4ths I must add.

"NATION SHALL NOT LIFT UP SWORD AGAINST NATION. 
NEITHER SHALL THEY LEARN WAR ANY MORE."

had less time to type in between drinks or something.

Concrete Wishes Within Crystal Dreams

If the original format of Claibie's poem gets altered in the

of the champagne glass.

             This is the shape of things expected,
              sparkling with domestic or imported,
               waiting to wet the lips and whet a
                desire for good luck, health, or
                   happinesses. Sip or gulp the
                      hopes of tomorrows. Ahh,
                      all springs eternal with
                        wishes of peace for

FATWA BLUES
  by Marco May 20, 1995

A fatwa on George Bush
A fatwa on the NRA
A fatwa on Newt Gingrich
GOP, FBI, CIA, NSA, DEA

A fatwa on every 3-letter word in the government.

A fatwa on every 4-letter word out of
Anyone's fatwa mouth.

Neo nazi training camps?
Militant subversive overthrow groups
Whether left, right or center.

And racist magazines?
Fat wa on all of them!

A fatwa on anyone who continues to 
use the words "politically correct." 

20 years for George Bush --
NRA can do his other 30.

GOP, FBI, CIA, NSA, DEA? 2 years each.
All other three letter words get 1
Except for the IRS

They get forever!

A day for each "fuck."
Half a day for each "shit."
All the rest get an hour.

All neo-nazis except Newt Gingrich
Get 6 years and 3 months.
Gingrich? He can rot in hell.
OK. A large toaster.

OK. A tanning salon.

People who use the words "Politically Correct?"
Don't get me started...

A fatwa on everyone who fatwa'd 
Salmon Rushdie.
Fatwa on cops, lawyers congressmen and
Rap singers.

And a fat fucking wa on 
Anyone who ever uses the word
Fatwa
again.





And we end this year, and this zine with a poem.

It's called:

AMERICAN DAYLIGHT

by Minnesota poet Charlton Metcalf



waking up

like a roller coasters first drop

accelerate aware

American daylight



hair of the dog

French maid toast

breakfast in bed

covers hog




stretching,

armpit close...




chewing like a tropical Gauguins best girl,

murmuring a name with the occasional vowel...





I’d like to trade her for a New York slice








That's all for ati306.

Feedback? ati@etext.org

See you next year.
