Due to continuing uncertainty over rights issues related to 
the streaming of radio broadcast programming over the internet, 
including recent issues regarding demands for additional fees 
for the streaming of recorded music and radio commercials, we 
and our advertisers are forced to temporarily disable our 
streaming. We apologize for the inconvenience of this 
interruption. 
  We are working with both our advertisers and the Recording 
Industry Association of America to find a solution to those 
problems as quickly as possible so that we can resume our 
streaming.

DISCLAIMER: 
  I'm going to rage against the machine for a second.
  Oh, wait. I've been doing that since 1989, huh?
  OK, I'm going to lay some more on you then. Tuesday.
July 3. Summerfest, Milwaukee. You already know I 
missed gordon and his fellow Femmes. (I'm listening to
"Violent Femmes" on Slash records as we speak =) ) Last
night was WILCO, Dammit.
  That's OK, I guess. I'll miss Jackson Browne 2morrow
night too. But tonite was Lucky Boys Confusion, the 
Benjamins, Reel Big Fish, Neil Diamond, Bette Midler,
Garth Brooks, Aretha Franklin and who knows to remember
who else??? You know the deal. About 10 medium sized
stages each too close to the other with about as much
Koss headphones and Crafstman tools soundblock as they
could design into the acoustics so as you walk just a
little bit away from "Here come the Boss Man callin' 
callin," you pass the 12 blue and white toilets and 
Channel 65 and suddenly you hear part of "Then I saw
her face, now I'm a believer."
  So it's more like "here come the bossman, now I'm a
believer."
  or 
  "I thought love was only true tell me it's alright."
  The problem is if you walk too far too fast you're 
likely to hear, "Love was out to get me, I said get off
my friggin foot, she should get clothes on or something,
only in america, which way are the bathrooms, R E S P E C T,
I said you're stepping on my frigging foot... the... dance..
aw man, don't pour that there, people have to walk, never
got to be your fred astaire."
  There's not a trace of doubt in my mind. How about yours?
I'm surprised anyone has a nice time at concerts like these,
but I guess you take what you can get, right? And as they
say in show biz, b-b-baby you just ain't seen n-n-nuthin
Joan Jett.
  Good.
  So Neil Diamond impressed the hell outa me. Despite all
his "let's hear it for the vets," bull shit. No I mean it
I'm a vet and that stuff offends me. He's just kissing up
so his phone will get tapped a little less often and his
address book doesn't get ripped off constantly, and so he
doesn't see some of his mail turn up missing, or his kids
or anything. No he can't mean that stuff, I'm serious. 
Support the troops? Die, sucker. What troops are YOU
supporting? Did you ever pick up the cuts in Champus or
GI Bill for some family out there? Last man or woman in
uniform you saw paying for food with stamps, did you pay
his or her grocery bill? Support the troops, gimme a break.
  Men in uniform?
  Only men in uniform you're honoring are ones personally
trained in forgery, disguise and evidence planting by old
Edgar Hoover himself.
  Those are the men in uniform you're helping out, whether
you like it or not, Mr. Neo Praetorian Guard.
  OK, that said, Neil Diamond, wow. That man can sing and
he sure could write a song, huh? I'm glad I saw him. Took 
him for granted all these years. I'm impressed! 
  It WAS hard to get past the red and black polyester
clothing with sparkly shinies, oh and that flat silver 
useless scarf thing around his neck. And the brand new 
Gibson acoustic guitar he doesn't seem to have any feelings 
for or connections to. (yeah, just toss it across the stage 
to a techie for tuning now and then...) But just think, he's
not Garth Brooks, right?  Anyways it was nice hearing him 
after pissing and right before returning to Reel Big Fish. 

   WAIT, THERE'S MORE. BUT FIRST THIS!

Neil Diamond was played by a member of a theatre troupe
devoted entirely to impersonators of stars. I'm not making
any of this up!

There's Neil Diamond impersonators all over the place
apparently:

 This is from Summerfest 95:
 Now, the next bit was kind of wack, took us a few seconds 
 to figure out what the fuck was going on, a little dubious 
 that they would leave us without "Porch" or something.
   Eddie brings out this Neil Diamond impersonator (it 
 WASN'T Neil Diamond, I'm sorry), and they go into "Forever 
 In Blue Jeans".
   Eddie's over on the side of the stage in his Cramps
 t-shirt, clearly highly amused by the proceedings, and 
 then makes things even more ridiculous by taking a few 
 verses himself!
 [ref]=[http://www.drizzle.com/~clr/summer.txt]

So there you have it. This guy was a seance bringing a living
star back to life. At least I think Screech's dad, Neil is
still alive. He is, isn't he? Who's he write for now, that
the Monkees are gone. N Stink? Backwash boyz? 

  OK I'll end with something more real, so you don't have to
feel like you're trying to land from this wack music column 
ok?
  I'm busking for tips on a friday or saturday afternoon,
and some stoner looking guy comes up to me and asks if I'll
let him, "can I play a key on your epiphone?"
  "Excuse me?" He repeats it exactly like that. Not knowing
what the heck he means I say sure, you can play a little.
Then he lowers each string trying to tune it back up, way
off. I'm just a little mad because three songs prior I had
tuned it to a Sabine tuner and then fine tuned it even closer
with my ear. Now I'm going to have to spend the next three
songs making adjustments.
  Then, (I'm NOT making this up!) he plays "Mr Bojangles."
  Then he wants to play the chords to "Leaving On A Jet 
Plane" but he asks me to sing it. OK, whatever. I was as 
patient as I could be. He eventually gave me back my guitar 
shortly after I began trying to decide exactly what words I 
would use to carefully extract my guitar out of the hands of 
just one more person who thinks every where I go is open mic.
  I guess that's the price I pay for a lifetime of pains-
takingly making sure my music is accessible, easy to play 
along to and completely devoid of stand-offishness, eh?

   RELEASE OF KOHL RECORDINGS BLOCKED
     by STEPHANI GRISHOM
  Disassociated Press Writer
Special to Prime Anarchist World News.
(PAWN) NEW BERLIN, WI -- Democrat Senator Herb Kohl won 
a court ruling Wednesday blocking the release of his 
conversations that were secretly recorded by Monica 
Lewdsky at the Senate Gym and Health Spa, a victory 
in the senator's attempts to defend his legacy as the 
leader who reunited DNC and DLC.
  After a one-day hearing, the New Berlin administrative 
court agreed with Kohl's lawyers, who argued he could 
claim protection under provisions shielding the victims 
of surveillance by Washington's pervasive communist-haters 
club, the FBLCIO.

What does WEBZINE mean to you?

"It's nice to get out of my smelly, isolated apartment 
and to a place where people you're not related to tell 
you how cool you are. And some of them are girls."
matthew b. patterson

http://www.ooze.com
-------------------------------------------------------

"Webzine is not only inspirational and exciting--it is 
IMPERATIVE.  I walked into Webzine 2000 with no expectations, 
and I was completely blown away.
  The only disappointment was that there wasn't enough time 
to meet all of the innovators and just plain freaks that 
I've heard about or been admiring for so long. It's an 
amazing opportunity to network and to exchange ideas for 
the enhancement of our endeavors.  This event IS where it 
is at."
amy young

http://www.screechmagazine.com
-------------------------------------------------------

"Webzine reaffirmed my faith in the importance of the Web.
  It was a creative, passionate and cool gathering of people 
whose personal investment in the Web is best gauged by blood-
sweat-and-tears vs. venture capital."
  "Part installation, party party, and all creativity, Webzine 
SF was by far the most inspiring Web-related event I've been 
to. And certainly worthy of my annual pilgrimage from the City 
of Angels."

------------------------------------------------------

"The Webzine series of conferences consistently brings 
together many of the most hard-working people in web 
publishing today.  These are the folks that subvert 
cutting-edge technology tools for rebellion, catharsis 
and vision. There's a lot to be learned when they talk 
to one another - half the best URLs for the next year 
are traded here."

MAKING CONNS: Some People Have Already Done Many For You!

Robert McNamara, the World Bank president who was chairman
of Ford and then secretary of defense, has called the 
population explosion the greatest obstacle to progress in
Latin America; the World Bank, he says, will give priority
in its loans to countries that implement birth control
plans. McNamara notes with regret that the brains of the
poor do 25 percent less thinking, and the World Bank
technocrats (who have already been born) set computers
humming to produce labyrinthine abracadabras on the 
advantages of not being born...

BOLIVIA'S IN THE NEWS A LOT LATELY: I Thought I'd Prepare 
This For You. Some Factoids and Fun Stuff Like That.

Some Things You Can Know About Bolivia

1545 - 1558 Potosi mine in Bolivia provided huge amounts
of silver and the mercury amalgam process was invented
there years later by US interests.

Other countries secretly taking silver out of Bolivia
at an alarming rate besides the US? Phillipines, China
and Spain. 

The Inca empire included Bolivia in its territories.

In 1902 the Bolivian government was given 2 Million 
Lira indemnity and a brand new railway built to give
it access to the Madeira and Amazon rivers after Brasil
lopped off 75,000 square miles of its size in war.

Christmas Eve 1977 General Hugo Banzer said no to amnesty
for prisoners, exiled and fired workers in tin and silver
mines. 

From 1952 til 1969 agrarian reforms throughout latin 
america helped Bolivia greatly but Bolivians still reported
they were only getting 60 percent of the protein and 20
percent of the calcium necessary for a minimal diet. [These
are averages and the book I got this from points out that
rural consumption is even more deficient than these figures
reveal]

Citibank corporation factors in almost everywhere you read
about Bolivia's problems. I'm not even going to begin writing
beyond a simple mention of them. I'll start ranting and frothing
at the mouth and be unable to stop.

Matilde mine in Bolivia contains lead, silver and zinc twelve
times more pure than any mine in the US can claim.

Bat shit and salt peter are some of the other notable exports
from Bolivia.

The Mellons and Rockefellers were all over Bolivia during the
Monopoly days.

Other places besides Laos and Cambodia napalm was used on civilians?
Peru and Bolivia.



Some analysis:

When ever the US economy takes a down turn silver will become more
important than gold. It's half as shiny and half as sought after,
but fluctuates between 1/10th and 1/100th as expensive.

Expect sulfide mines all over Bolivia and be ready to see rocks 
that were once seen as too expensive to extract get popular again
around the minefields.

A Parody That Will Go Unfinished.
  (unless anyone else feels like it...)
I woke up singing it in a dream, and rushed

ANOTHER FINE PRIME ANARCHIST SONG SYNTHESIS

For this one we've combined Sugar Ray's
"When It's Over" with Violent Femmes'

When it's over
That's the time I fall in love again 
And when it's over
That's the time you go go go go again
Life was fun
life was great
til I made my big mistake
oh no it'll never happen to me
life was short
and life was sweet
I was thinking as I hit the street
I could hardly believe
I could scarcely conceive
but I had gone out the window
I had gone out the window
I had gone out the window
All the things that I used to say 
All the words that got in the way
All the things that I used to know
Have gone out the window
All the things that she used to bring
All the songs that she used to sing
All of her favorite TV shows
Have gone out the window
They have gone out the window
Gone out the window.

They have gone out the window
They have gone out the window
They have gone out the window

A Poem from Bhopal, India

Yes,
I am a rabid optimist
For me
Every tree that continues to stand
Every stream that continues to flow
Every child that runs away from home
is an indication
that the battle is not only on
It is being won.
You may tell me about 
the nuclear arms race
And all I can tell you
is that an unknown child
held my hand
with love.
You will try to draw me
into the plateau of practical life
Tell me
that not only god
but all the religious
and irreligious leaders are dead
And all I can tell you 
is that across the forest 
Lives a young man 
who calls the earth
his mother.
You will give me the boring details
of the rise of state power
after every revolution 
And all I can tell you
is that in our tribe
we still share our bread
You will reason with me
And I will talk nonsense like this
And because
the difference between breathing
and living life
is the difference between
reason and poetry
I will read poems to you
Poems full of optimism
Poems full of dreams
And maybe a poem better than this.
