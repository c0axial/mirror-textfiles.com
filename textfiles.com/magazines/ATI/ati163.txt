AVISO -
  On a snowy day you can smell
Proctor&Gamble.
  Thought it was just rainy
daze. Jogging down the street
I smell what I swear must be
the Tide aisle of any super
mercado.
  Methinks I prefer the Pfizer
smell to "eau de PG." But then
I can only vouch for a pre-
fastrac, pre- viagra, pre- barb-
wire-&-armed-guards pfizohex.
  They're prob'ly making things
far worse now than Puffs, Pringles
OR Olestra, eh?
  OK.
  Puffs and Pringles...
  Wait 'til MAI passes.

Hi Marc,
I never wrote anything about the L.A. 
"Crack the CIA" rally for your
webzine, but I just found a site 
that has an article, and photos 
of the event. It was a big rally, 
and got almost zero press coverage. 
It was a lot of fun, being there! 
Hope all is well! 
Take care,
