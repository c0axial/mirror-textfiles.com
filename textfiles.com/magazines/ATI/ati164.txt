Dear Farwell,

Make up your F-ing mind. You've been

You'll have to go it alone. Fat, dumb

just looking in the wrong pulpit.
Pissed at you,

something in there about Pepe's Pizza

I missed the beginning, but I take it 
you're cataloguing the commercial 
exploitation of anti-establishment rock?
In that case, I nearly barfed when I heard

FOR RELEASE "INMEDIATELY"
A Dineh delegation just traveled to 
Los Angeles for a House of Blues 
MLK, Jr. Benefit Concert on Sunday, 
January 17th to honor the Dineh.
The delegation consisted of  
Roberta Blackgoat, Pauline Whitesinger, 
Glenna Begay, Caroline Tohannie, 
Rena Babbitt Lane, John Lane, 
John Benally, Leonard Benally, 
Tom Bedonie, Carlos Begay, 
Lenora Hathalie, and others.  

John Trudell, Jackson Browne,
Indigenous, Medusa, Mauro Olivera,

It was at the House of Blues in Los
Angeles in the presence of over 
1,000 people that Roberta Blackgoat 
received a Martin Luther King Jr. 
Human Rights award 'I Have a Dream' 
on behalf of Sovereign Dineh Nation.  
Liberato Bautista, Assistant General 
Secretary of the General Board of

NEWZ FROM THE NORTHCOAST. UNDER 
JESSE NO-BRAINER VENTURA'S NOSE: 
Or At Least On His Watch Now.
Marc,
You can use what I said about the drum. 
But it's relevant to get it all in 
there, the sweat lodge was taken down. 
The sacred fire was put out with a 
fire extinguisher. Tipis were torn 
apart because they don't know how 
to takedown a lodge. Lodge poles snapped, 
I think some were burned. This non-
violent encampment was set up to 
prevent the breaking of several
federal laws. To prevent a park from 
being cut in half, all to save
motorists 3 minutes to the Mall Of Amerika.
This road is way illegal, but it was 
tied to light-rail, so it must be good, 
right? We're all for light rail but 
wouldn't it make  more sense just to 
put the light rail in and see what 
happens, see if people get out 
of their cars?
Well, I could go on for hours, it has 
been what my life is about for the
past  5 months.
Here's the url, just in case:
      [see #'s run]
Start raising hell in Green Bay, Marc
we need all the help we can get. 
Some of the people at camp are 
going down to Big Mountain in 
the next couple of days and months 
to help out there too. Personally 
I want to go out to Yellowstone 
to protect Buffalo, but I must 
stay to see this through.
The American Indian Movement 
and Earth First! are still 
standing strong as brothers and 
sisters, it's a beautiful thing to see.
In Struggle,
Robert (redbeard)

MOOSE POOP SOUP: Big Wet Hit Or Flop?
<PAWN> - Duluth. Yeah. You heard right.
   Moose Poop Soup.
   Culinary artist, sculptor and cafe
owner Mai Young Blz says she's starting
what's sure to be the biggest fad since
The Beatles and the Hansens invented Ed
Sullivan.
   "Sure, there's stone soup," said Blz
"I've had it, it's great. And birdsnest,
and there's moose poop jewelry sells so
well around Montana and Colorado."
   She claims people have cooked with 
gems and even brass rings for thousands
of years and no one's gotten sick.
   Why there's even a bartender in Gnome,
AK who uses old frostbitten fingers to
replace the olives in martinis.
   Our chef says popular, but "yuk."
   "I'd eat petrified moosepoop in a heart
beat," she said, "before drinking something
near a frostbitten finger."
   "The poop's been clean for years. You
never know WHERE that finger's been!"

  
     "ha!! I Kill me!!"
   --Alf

And now our usual poetical
hermetically sealed, onionpeeled,
crying, lying, spit in the 'toon
car-drivin' go speed racer go
get 'em let 'em bet 'em wet
noodle, strudel and attitudinal
dry dream of an ending.

Because here at ATI, we always
go out with a POEM.
