Hi, welcome to another chapter in ATI history.

I'm prime anarchist and, well. Here we go again...


sifodoh
(sitting in front of dahmer's old house)

My mom sent me news clippings from our home-town paper,
as she often does.
  On the back of a clipping was a complete local police
log. Let me share a snapshot without naming names or
anything. I won't even list the violations. Just the
ages. Ready?

26,18,25,20,19,21,44,24,33,37,21,28,27,47,46,32,
43,23,19,49,33,38,27,30,32,36,33,31,22,35.

  Seven women, all the rest men. (assuming that names
will indicate gender fairly precisely) 
  Now that I'm in my late 30s I OUGHT TO be able to
say let's just criminalize the act of being male between
25-35 years old, right?
  Oh wait. Two things occur to me. 
1) I won't believe in or stand for any kind of profiling
2) We already do that as a nation, don't we?
     ___________

I ought to mention a thing or two about the Klan, Nazis,
National Alliance and World Church of The Creator coming
and going yesterday, huh?
1) they suck.
2) they're silly looking
3) someone should tell them how much they suck.
4) have I mentioned that they suck?

IT'S ALL ABOUT JAZZ!
Q. What is the difference between a pizza and 
a Jazz musician?
A. A pizza can feed a family of four!
What is it about Jazz that makes a Jazz musician 
stick to a form of music that A&R managers have 
scientifically and suspiciously proven to be a 
musician's surest route to death by starvation? 
One good reason would be the fact that Jazz allows 
me to be myself as opposed to Pop that wants me to 
be Madonna. I would rather be me than strut onstage 
wearing conical jocks. I remember a male indipop 
album released by some genius A&R manager, titled 
'mai bhi Madonna' (i'm Madonna too). Jazz as you 
will see, and if you've heard about 'mai bhi Madonna', 
helps me retain my individuality and what's left of my 
sanity in this big mad world of music marketing. Jazz, 
the most open, alive and evolving form of music, is 
the medium i choose to communicate and express myself 
musically. I know a lot of people in the audience may 
not understand my intense shoobee-doo-wop, shoobee-
doobee-doo-wop and emotive twidlee-didlee, didlee-doo-
dah along with some sensitive chaka-chaka, shaka-dish-
boom-thaak. But there's always the few who can 'feel' 
what they can't figure. Most of the time the message i 
communicate may read 'hey brother, how about a loan..
i'm broke again' but when i have someone in the 
audience enjoying my music, i become a millionaire.

AIRPLAY 101
-----------------
By Bryan Farrish
http://www.radio-media.com



Why Clear Channel is Irrelevant for Indies

After endless concerns in the indie community about radio
consolidation and Clear Channel, I'm here to tell you 
that it should be of no concern to you.  Regular rotation 
on large stations (Clear Channel or otherwise) in major 
or medium markets is not available now... nor has it ever 
been... (for over 30 years) to small indie releases and 
artists any more than McDonalds is available to you to 
market your indie toys. 

Remember McDonalds' 10-year marketing agreement with 
Disney?  Before it happened, do you think you had any 
chance at all of getting your indie toy into McDonalds? 
That situation is the equivalent of you trying to get
your indie release into regular rotation on medium and 
major stations.  Consolidation or no consolidation, 
trying to get a product with entry-level marketing onto 
the largest media outlets in the world is a terribly 
misplanned idea.  (This applies, of course, to new 
acts/labels releasing their first or second record 
on their own.)

So why all the hoopla?  Because news outlets know that 
you'll read it.  And when you read it, they get paid.  
News outlets (like the LA Times and salon.com) need to 
print things that you are worried about, so you will 
log on and/or purchase copies, or else they will close 
down.  Since the worst fear of all musicians is not 
having their music heard, if the publications tell you 
how the biggest radio stations are not going to play you, 
they know you will pay attention and read.

But just because you are just now learning how difficult 
the large stations are, does not mean that it used to be 
any easier.  Fact is, if you were trying to release your 
own record (even on AM radio) in the 60's and 70's, you 
would have been going directly up against Capitol, RCA, 
ABC, Atlantic, CBS, and the other major labels at the 
time. So even then (with no Clear Channel), you would 
have had to start off with the smaller stations, just 
like you have to today.   And also back then (20 years 
before the McDonalds-Disney agreement,) you would never 
have been ableto get McDonalds to carry/market your indie 
toy; but you can bet that the toy industry publications 
back then did their best to paint a depressing picture 
for the small toy manufacturers, despite the fact that 
the best way for an indie toy maker to market its toys 
(both then and now) is to work with the mom and pop toy 
stores throughout the country.

What does this mean for your airplay?  The same thing 
we've been trying to get across for years:  Start with 
small market commercial stations (or college stations 
in any market,) and use the results to book more and 
bigger gigs, all the while selling your CDs and merch 
for full price at those gigs.  You'll never have to 
deal with getting distribution (or getting paid from 
distribution), much less have to worry that you won't 
be getting any regular rotation on a Clear Channel 
station.  If you absolutely won't rest until you get 
some Clear Channel spins, however, then consider 
commercial specialty/mix shows... These shows are 
available on Clear Channel stations from New York 
on down, and with good music and a good push, you 
can get a spin or two for a few weeks.

AND MORE SOA MISC STUFF

Fortune Cookie

On the bus going home from SOA this year
we stopped by a Piggly Wiggly for dinner.
 There appeared to be only enough time to
get stuff and eat on the bus, so some of
us got take-out chinese. My friend Michele
offered me the last half of her rice, and
she also said I could have her fortune 
cookie.
  I said sure but we should share the cookie
because I feel it's going to be an important
one. That's just how these things go. She
said I could eat it all because she didn't
want any. I said ok, but it still has to be
our fortune, not just mine. She obliged.
  I opened it.
  You're not going to believe what it said.
  Ready?

AHIMSA: A Glimpse Of Saturday's Peacekeeper Training
  by marco

  Amy Martin sang "I'm on my way" as a call and 
response. Wow, I've only heard it and sang it as 
straight folk-rock performance. Good work Amy! That 
was awesome.
 
She rocks.

Then she announced it was Paddy Inman's birthday. He
looked very embarrassed. We found out rather quickly
it was more a look of surprise than embarrassment.
Paddy's been so busy the past couple weeks and this
weekend, he knew his birthday was somewhere around 
here, but had totally forgotten the specifics.
  Which brought a funny vibe to the whole room. 
Paddy explained. [ in case you don't know, Paddy 
is the facilitator for all the peacekeepers each 
year. A huge job. I don't know anyone else I've 
met in my life so far who could even think about 
raising their hand to take on half of what he does! 
Paddy Inman is one of my biggest heros. ] The first 
year he got arrested at the SOA (was this 6 years 
ago? 7?) he was being processed and a woman typing 
in his drivers license turned to him and said, "Oh, 
and happy birthday."
  "What?" asked Paddy.
  "Happy Birthday."
  "Huh?"
  "Son," said the woman, "it's your birthday."

Musta been really busy that week too.

Wait, it gets heavier. Not only was Paddy Inman
born onbase, he was conceived there too. Right 
there on Fort Benning. Perhaps by a tree where
School-Of-Coups wasn't built yet? Just kidding!
But not about these connections. His dad was a
warden or an MP or something. Stationed there.
So here begins Paddy Inman's path. Each year
speaking truth to power must be an incredible 
homecoming for him. Perhaps he played youth
football with some kids who grew up to be SOA
instructors. Perhaps some of his onbase classmates
went on to work at the Pentagon, or lead Fort
Benning's jump school or something. Not Paddy.
He's staring down a Mayor, a Colonel, a two-star
general, and refusing to blink. Refusing to 
compromise. Only willing to re-state what we all
can live with, and what we can't. What we will
do transparently, and what we're willing to let
them try to do. Paddy is definitely the one you
want standing beside you at the Pearly Gates as
you try to answer to all your "deeds."
  But I digress. Paddy Inman was leading me and
a whole mess of peacekeepers. Once again. Yet
another year. What beautiful energy fills up 
the room, thanks to Amy and Paddy, and each and
every one of us too, I think.
  Blessed are the peacekeepers? No, blessed are the
peaceMAKERS. Remember this. It will serve you well
no matter what faith you walk on. Some peacekeepers
will be peacemakers as well, many of us will fall
short a little here and there. Many of the wider
group of SOA protesters will be peacemakers, and
you know what? There's a woman cop I saw cry last
year. I saw her again this year. I saw emotion from
some MPs too. Not tears, but a certain look in the
eyes. That I never noticed any other years. That is
probably the look of a peacemaker as well. Blessings
toward them. It's because of all these people, we 
all live another day.
  So how it is with this upcoming day. This Sunday 
morning. This funeral, this litany, this ceremony,
this dance. How will it be?
  "This changes things," says Paddy, about the 
injunction we lost, about the new dynamics the 
military and the city police have thrown into the 
equation about a week before the demonstrations began. 
I'd never known the "gub mint" to resort to monkey-
wrenching, methinks they're feeling some little bit of 
desperation, eh? Checkpoints? Electronic wands? 
Barricades? Counter-demos, moving General LeMoyne's 
"friendly" controlled scripted and rehearsed dialogue 
sessions from inside the gate to the gate, and now to 
just outside the checkpoints??? I see where they're 
going with this. They haven't just lost the "InfoWar" 
like Colonel Weidener said a while back, they've begun 
losing their cool as well. Hopefully we can keep THEM 
from too much violence. I'm less worried about "our own 
people." 

So last year we were given the street, this year 
they've barricaded us in and we can't get to that
street without submitting to a search. 

Paddy quoted AJ Muste, "there's no way to peace,
peace is the way."
  He made a very strong point of keeping sure we're 
not complicit in these searches in any way. Let people 
be as random as they would feel comfortable. Other 
years some of us peacekeepers might have been into 
herding ourselves along rows and columns all neat 
and orderly, but Paddy suggested that's not a good 
idea this year. Funeral procession yes, checkpoints 
no.
  If people want to listen to the Police when they keep
pointing and saying "get out of that line and go to
this new one," that's fine, if they don't we won't do
much. Perhaps a few words of "there's a third checkpoint
now, move there if you want to, but only if you want to."
Or some such. Gentle smiles and standing near the crowd
and the police is probably best. Little more than that.
This alone performs magic. (how do you think the woman
cop cried? I smiled at her for a very long time when I
watched her help someone instead of being so verbally
abusive for the moment. She smiled, that's when a tear
gushed out. Magic. I didn't perform it per se, just 
participated in it."
  "The wisdom contained in the following words," says 
this year's 'SOA WATCH PEACEKEEPER GUIDELINES,' "does 
not come from any one individual or organization but 
rather from a multitude of individuals whose consciences 
have compelled them to engage in nonviolent resistance 
to powerful people and institutions that have attempted
to compromise the rights of others in order to promote
their own selfish ends."
  
That's what I'm talking about.

Another roadblock to our goals of setting a good tone, 
and maintaining our "peaceful pissed off people" 
presence came in the form of two absolutely stupid
things said out loud in the courtcase Friday morning
and afternoon.
  An expert witness claiming to know all about 
riots said five different times, (count 'em, 5!) 
it's "bare naked, bare breasted, bare chested 
women" that causes a riot the most. He claimed 
that the four or five naked people last year made 
things so violent that things almost got out of 
hand. Apparently the 3rd or 4th time this expert 
recited this, Paddy yelled out (probably risking 
contempt) "enough already, we've heard you," or 
some words like that. Hmmm. I wonder what this has 
to do with why they must wand us with metal detectors? 
We pretty much all agreed if there was any nudity we
would just do what we always do -- ask for calm,
suggest everyone be mindful of nonviolence, and
keep maintaining a strong gentle presence.

Second absolutely stupid statement?

They trust every single one of our protesters
and peacekeepers. It's those outside radicals
they need to search and protect us from. You
know, the ones who wear red and black and 
carry symbols like A's inside circles, and
such. Yeah, the anarchists. 
  How did we resolve this? We'll stop profiling
of anarchists by passing out red armbands to
anyone who wants one, and they can sharpie an
anarchy symbol on it or any other symbol they
feel like. Wear it on your arm, your leg or
whereever you want. A friend of mine wore one
around her forehead. She rocks too.
  So I'll end this glimpse by lifting a couple
more quotes from the guidelines that struck
me as appropriate to the wider peacemaking
that so many of us would like to move our
entire lives toward.

-- Peacekeepers are responsible for maintaining
the "nonviolent" self-discipline of the action
and act as mediators in confrontations between
authorities and demonstrators. Peacekeepers 
have primary responsibility for participants 
in the action, but they should be fully 
prepared to protect legal authorities and 
other non-participants from demonstrators if 
necessary."

-- Try to engage hecklers in polite conversation
as an intervention technique, but understand
that you are not going to convince or convert
them. If you talk, discuss but do not argue.
Be polite. Smile. Nothing is more disarming.

-- Stay between conflicts or confrontations and
the marchers. Keep the march moving. Your back
should generally be toward the conflict while
quietly urging others to keep moving and not
join the conflict. Let the conflict fizzle out.
You do not need to be a hero and interpose your-
self... Stay calm. It's only a conflict.

-- Urge people to stay back from an arrest. Do 
not try to block civil authorities and urge others
not to also.

-- Maintain contact between yourself and the police
whenever possible by introducing yourself, making
eye contact, smiling, engaging them in conversation
to establish the "human" connection. Inform police
of your intentions in a non-threatening manner. Be
open to their legitimate concerns, such as traffic
flow or any other safety issues.

-- Talk with disrupters if possible. If they are
demonstrators, they may be open to good arguments
and reminders to adhere to our "nonviolence pledge."
Sometimes it's better to distract other demonstrators
from the disrupters. Focus or refocus peoples' 
attention on the vigil and the action itself by 
encouraging them to keep on moving, singing,
chanting, or whatever is appropriate to the 
situation.

Happy Birthday, Paddy Inman.

Just as Adam Shapiro said about International Solidarity
Movement that there is no one Gandhi in the Palestinian 
struggle, rather there are hundreds; there is no one 
Gandhi in the SOAW movement either, hundreds are here 
too. And Paddy is surely a great one of them.

JOURNO-RESEARCH PROJECT OF THE MONTH

Who is Rockwell
What is Allen-Bradley about
Why are they directly connected to the Klan
When did the Klan actually decide to come to Milwaukee
Where besides Peoria are they centering themselves

Preliminary thesis:
The Klan came to Milwaukee because despite five Bush
trips to Wisconsin, and countless millions pumped
into the campaign, McCallum lost to a democrat. 
Not since McCarthy has national socialism lost 
this much foothold in Wisconsin this fast. Brownshirts
everywhere are quivering nervously that their Queen
Bee, their HQ, their braintrust, their "raisin debtor"
is fast dying off.
