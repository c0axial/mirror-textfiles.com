PUBLISHER'S COLUMN

Tuesday, 29 oct, 345pm. I'm in the "historic" third ward.
What better a place to be in Milwaukee exactly one week
before the off-season national elections.
  Yes, George Bush is NOT up for election. Pity, this is
perhaps the lowest his polls are ever going to get. Maybe
not, one can cross their fingers. A lot can happen in two 
years.
  OK, the task at hand. Giving the Fix, Jimmy The Greek
style, on the upcoming elections. I've already predicted
that the GOP is going to lose 5-7 Senate seats unless
they can figure out a way to prove beyond a shadow of 
a doubt they did NOT kill Paul Wellstone. No, I'm NOT 
saying I think they did it. They might have. I don't 
know. I can't know. I'm just saying that conspicionism 
theories are spreading faster'n zuccini squash over all 
the innuendo and coincidence.
  And let's face it. This hurts the Good Obese Party.
Yes, America; all the toupes and male girdles in the
world can't cover up that smell. It's just under the
bulging belly. Just call it oil of consumerism.
  And how do I put that on Wellstone? I don't. How
do I pin it on Bush? I won't. I'm saying that there's
a slowdown brewing. People are making things. They're
buying used, they're dumpster diving. It's 1972 all
over again.
  Nixxon's going down. How long will it take? Certainly
not 8 years like Clinton. NAFTA and failed healthcare
couldn't take Clinton down, and neither could sodomy.
So ok, Fritz Mondale will replace Wellstone. I'm 91%
happy. Where's the other 9% go? I doubt he'll be voting
repeatedly to CLOSE THE SOA, the way Wellstone did. I
maybe be surprised, but I'm not holding out hope. He
served listeningly under James Earl Ray, I mean Carter,
and what do we know about Carter in the SOA? He wants
it open. He wants it operating. Yes, love him to death,
believe he deserves the Noble Peas Prighs, ten times
more than a Kissinger or an Oliver North, and he 
verily was (how can I tell you) the real one who freed
the hostages at the end of his administration, (trumped
as he was by greedy sapsucker soilant greenwashers) 
lastly and thusly I must say he is definitely quite
a peacenik, but there's two things wait three, that
linger smelly about Rosylin's hubby. Ok, four things.
I'll list them.

1) Delta Force
2) FEMA
3) blind obedience to SOA
4) Wife is part owner of Gannett Corporation

  So where was I? Carter wants the SOA to remain open,
I don't expect to ever reach Fritz Mondale on THAT one.
But try I will, you betcha. At any rate, he's going to
kick some Repugnican butt, and there's going to be 
residual affects.
  4-6 other seats. Lemme study the heck outa the roster
and tell you what parts of the midwest and far west are
going to crack. I'll get back to you tonite on that one.
  Now for the house. GOP will lose 10-12, the Demcons 
will gain 8-10. How can I say that? You betcha. Look
for greens, commies, nazis and indys to start clamoring
for a piece of the elitismo pie!
  Two years ago all eyes were on Wisconsin. It was the
McCarthy renaissance. Now everyone's taking their calls
from that big fat muscular baldheaded goatee-lookin
weirdo, Jesse the Brain Ventura. You think he's gonna
lose to a democrat or a republican? Not if he can help
it. He'll usher in another weirdo maybe. Now, that's not 
necessarily a good thing, mind you. If American history 
plods on, "business as usual," either the dems or reps 
will dry up and fold into the older and newer one, and 
you'll be right back to a two-party choice.
  But it is a new Millenium for this nation. Not just
the whole rest of the world. The USA has never HAD a
millenium change before. Europe has, Mecca and Medina
have, and so has mama Afrika. We might surprise ourselves
afterall.
  So my fix so far? GOP loses House and Senate for a 
long long time, and they prepare to lose the Prez in
a couple years. OK, remains to be seen, I know. We'll
cross that bridge when we get there.
  So I'm in the Third Ward, typing on a laptop in a
Starbucks on a Tuesday. (not fairtrade day). I asked
for FT coffee, and here's my neat Odyssey. Ready?
Francisco, the manager tallied it up and to french
press me one, he'd have to charge me 3.95. Yikes.
Gimme, non-FT and I'll complain later. Francisco asked
me to please suggest rather than complain, pointing out
two awfully valid things. It'll get me farther, and it
got the movement this far. Yup, people just like me
asking and asking is what got Starbucks to add some
(yes I acknowlege SOME) FairTrade.
  So after I bought a small coffee, (1.40; if it were
Monday I could get fairtrade for the same price) I sat
here with my laptop and started plugging away.
  Francisco ground me up a pound of fairtrade coffee
after first asking if my coffeemaker had a cone bottom
or a flat one. He GAVE me a pound of fairtrade. THAT'll
hold me over til next Monday eh? "On him." On the house,
so to speak. Then a little while later he poured himself
a small coffee and asked if he could take his first
break of the day right next to me. I obliged, and he 
told me of his life. 
  8 years he lived in Washington (the northwest one) 
He's originally from either Oaxaxa or Chiapas. I asked
him, he smiled and said yes but wouldn't specify. I 
knew better than to push. He got hooked up with Starbucks
out there and has worked within the system ever since.
He's part of the solution my friends, I can feel it,
I can hear it. He's sincere. Way more sincere than I
was when I was managing Subways, and certainly more
than when I was assmanaging RadiosHacks.
  Venceremos. He wants me to harrass Folgers more than
Starbucks, and understands that I still want to push
his HQ for 2X a week fairtrade soon, and then all
weekdays or something. Slow and steady, we're gonna
rock this house. He told me how he's trying to make
heaven on earth. I heard him.
  Thank you, Francisco.

SITTING IN FRONT OF DAHMER'S OLD HOUSE

Michael Moore just helped me unwind a few things.
  I hardly know how to articulate this, but I'll
try. I came out of the Oriental Theater here (the
Violent Femmes' all-time fave venue) having seen
"Bowling For Columbine." I left there feeling just 
a little less anti-social.
  I felt the whole audience breathe that same 
"I'm OK, are you? You'll be alright, we all will."
It was weird given the topic at hand, right?
  Well there were two or three scenes where Michael
Moore stroked the upper back of someone grieving, 
saying "it's ok." 
  It is. He tells them, he tells us. He was telling
me. I felt that.

   [ ed note: this feature was conceived just a
   few weeks ago - shortly after a Milwaukee man
   was beaten to death by children ages 10-14 here
   in Milwaukee. Vigils began out in front of the
   house where the beating happened. Candles and
   prayer. Ummm. About 10 blocks walking distance
   from Dahmer's house? Perhaps an even more
   fitting memorial would be a weekly midnite walk
   from that house to Dahmer's; while addressing
   issues of nonviolence. Are we ready for that?
   How many decades?? ]




THE GREEN CANDIDATE: A Kid Takes On The Machine
  (reprinted from some Chicago freeby shopperpaper)
  
When diners at Wolfgang Puck's ask Jason Farbman about himself,
most expect to hear that the 24-year-old is waiting tables while
attending school or pursuing an acting career.
  They're no doubt surprised when their waiter informs them that
he's running for state representative of the 14th district, and
that he spends his spare time photocopying fliers or designing
campaign buttons or chatting with constituents at the train 
station at 6am.
  A recent transplant from Connecticut, the former political 
science major moved here for the punk scene and wanted to
campaign locally for Ralph Nader's Green Party. When Farbman
realized there were no current party candidates in Rogers
Park, he decided to run himself, campaigning for affordable
housing, accessible healthcare, living wages, and budget
accountability. He learned a hard early lesson about the
nature of Chicago politics when Democratic incumbent Harry 
Osterman petitioned Springfield to get the wildcard candidate 
bumped off the ticket, even though Farbman and his team of 
volunteers had the required signatures. What has played out 
is a sort of David and Goliath story, with the food-server-
cum-political-whiz-kid fighting back on his own turf, using 
a grassroots approach to campaign advertising that he learned 
pasting fliers for music shows, what he calls a door-to-door 
"DIY aesthetic." As a result, there was a large turnout at the 
debate with Osterman last week at the Loyola Park Fieldhouse. 
  "It's drama. You have a kid and a Machine," says Farbman, 
who has recently cut his waiting-tables schedule to only a few 
shifts a week in order to gear up for the November primaries.

Were Senator Herb "Coward" Kohl to Speak Truth in War.

Mr. President, I rise today in defiance of my constituents.
  There is no more grave vote we Senators take than
authorizing war. To do so, we must believe that there
is great cause - a great threat to America. (or at 
least receive a heavy bribe from Pentagon interests)
  I cast my vote today going along with you and your
people because I'm afraid. Afraid of the power elite,
scared of you, and fearful of my own graft and avarice.
  It's not an easy thing going against my constituents.
I do it less than half the time. That I do it that
often even, leaves me feeling very bad. But more 
important than them is this war. War with Iraq, and
the furtherance of war with Iraq is a good thing for
America. Her economy hinges on it.
  I will vote for this authorization because I've been
told that Saddam Hussein's acquisition of weapons of
mass destruction is a good enough threat to justify
war. I believe disarming Saddam Hussein is such a
great cause that we should do it without first 
disarming ourselves. If we had time to think, to
react, to consider alternatives, we might consider
disarming ourselves, but there is no time. This 
tyrant must be stopped now. Or at least ASAP.
  I believe that stopping tyrants is the President's
greatest goal. He read storybooks about tyrants when
he was just a child and also ones about scarey monsters
and for this we must come to the aid of the international
community once again. America will once again be saving
humanity.
  There is no doubt that some people around the world
will call us beligerent, tyranical bullies, imperialists
or something. For them I say we must fight fire with 
fire, beligerence with beligerence and tyranny with 
tyranny. That is why we have armys. These kids will 
get to go over there and kick some serious ass. And 
those who live will get money for college, and retraining 
in fields like blasphemy, junk bonds, stem cell research, 
and upper eschelon prison industry jobs.
  Mr. President it's a win/win situation. We get to
do a little population control, while ridding our
country of some surplus radioactive material, possibly
even the smog will decrease some because dark-skinned 
people will be lowered in numbers. I did a study in 
Green Bay once, and it really is darkly complected 
people who cause smog. No one knows what to do about 
this. I say get rid of the Green Bay Packers and you 
get rid of smog. 
  But getting rid of football players (I always liked 
basketball more anyways) is less important right now 
than getting rid of Saddam Hussein.
  There is no doubt that the threat Saddam Hussein
and his weapons pose to this country and to world
peace is real. More than a decade has passed since
the last time we defeated Hussein, but he has not
died. He is the same smug celebrity we can be sure
will overrun his neighbors and launch weapons of mass
destruction. We know that his regime has bought
and produced, is continuing to produce massive
quantities of Squibb and Warner Lambert products
without a permit.
  We know much less about his current attitude toward
clean nukes and smart bombs. He might even want to buy 
a few some day. We cannot and will not let him acquire 
the skills to make his own. That would be financially
ruinous to our United States. He knows where to get it
if he needs to, let him come to us.
  Mr. President, let me be clear on this point. My
vote today is a vote for voting my conscience. Nothing
else is clear right now in a world filled with gloom
and dreariness. But my conscience is clear, once
muddied by cards and letters, midnight phone calls,
people visiting me telling me what they think I should
do. But hearing from the Pentagon people set me straight.
I now know what we must do, and do it we must. We just
must. That has never been more clear. It is with the
clarity of a thousand panes of glass that I speak
clearly and clarify my point. My point that I must be
very clear on. It is surely never before been more
clear that we must go to war against Iraq. My vote is
a vote for war, sure, but it is surely a vote for
clarity more than that. Clearly you see I am speaking
clearly. Let me be clear when I say that my point is.
  Overthrowing the Iraqi government would be wrong.
But if it happens we must be ready to say we did it
for all the right reasons. For that I am fully prepared
to work hand in hand with the President, the Pentagon
and any other people with the letter "P" at the beginning
of their name.
  The President has vowed to seek the support of the
international community against Iraq, and my vote today
is cast accepting and supporting that position fully.
I have always said we should not commit US troops abroad
without first terrifying the international community
into a frenzy where they demand that we act. This hasn't
happened this time around, but I won't let it get me
down. It's easy enough to psych myself up and see that
people who aren't with us are with the terrorists.
  Mr. President, we must be ready to go this alone if 
we have to. Many famous people went it alone, and won. 
Look at Genghis Khan, or Empress Katherine the Great. 
In fact, look at Jesus the Christ or Dicky Nixon. These 
people had the whole world against them, and they took 
the noble path. Essentially, they kicked some serious 
Muslim ass.
  Mr. President, my vote today is a vote to support
the President in his efforts to disarm Saddam Hussein.
And if you can score his 1961 VW Beetle with the Porsch
pancake engine in the back and it's not too damaged,
I wouldn't mind calling it my own.
  My vote is NOT an endorsement of a preemptive war, 
unless the President sees fit. Then I'll have to say 
I'm for it. Hopefully it won't come to that. My vote 
today is to authorize the President to gather a world 
force against the threat of a dangerous regime who may
or may not have nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, 
and to disarm every regime that has them, even if we
have to use some of our own to do it.
  And finally my vote today is to authorize the President
to go to war in the hope that this strong statement of
our commitment to violence will allow us to do so WITHOUT
war.

  
  
 

Wellstone, a song. 
  by marco

There was a wellstone
by the lower spring
I used to kneel there
Had fallen outa the ring

It was so old
It never died
It's probably still there
Each time the rain subsides


Is there a wellstone
Where you can drink what's pure
You better get there 
Rejuvenate for sure


Wellstone, wellstone
A wellstone can
Invigorate you
And energize you
Like a catalyst do

There was a wellstone
In them US halls
They call it congress
And you can scale the walls

Yeah right...

Don't mourn too long; organize!


God Bless you, Paul Wellstone
