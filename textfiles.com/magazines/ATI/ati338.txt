sifidoh, 

 Sitting
  In
   Front
    Of
     Dahmer's 
      Old
       House


the PUBLISHER'S COLUMN

So we're up to issue 338 of the 'zine. Wow. Has
it been this many? Has this little changed in all
of world history?

todo: compile research on Kit Carson stories 
      that Hitler's knwn to have read.

Iran/Contra happened HOW MANY years ago?

Wow.

I look over the very first issue(s) of this 'zine
and realize there has been "SlimToNone" changes
or improvement(s) in the "StateOfTheUnion" here 
in the EEUU. In fact it seems to've gotten a
hole lot worse. [sic.]

Has there ever been an upcoming year such as this
where hearing someone like baby-bush say "the state 
of the union is strong" was any more downright utterly
laughable?

I'm almost embarrassed.

Negroponte, Abrams, Rumsfeld and Cheney at the helm,
Enron and WorldCom out the bilge and George W sealing
his leathery crack-pipe lips around the rusty scupper.
  This ship's going down, people. And there's nothing
a Popeye, fraid to tell you, or a Batman or Wonder-
Woman can do about it. Pick up some of the pieces. 
But save a sinking ship? Drowning witch? Gasping
swimmer?
  You can place your hand over a sucking chest 
wound, and be there for their sublime moment of 
death but you cannot keep one such as they from
expiring afterall. Baby-bush is an M-16 with tumbler
rounds. He will render this nation unidentifiable
save for a dogtag jammed in our teeth. You cannot
build a bodybag big enough for the hell this man
is about to wreak. 
  Cerberus is pissed off. He'll be working overtime
on this one. Person after person filing through the
not-so-pearly gates.
  "And what did you do?"
  "Followed orders."
  "And you?"
  "I was just doing my job."
  "What about you?"
  "When they came for the..."

So, what's to salvage anyhow? 
  30,000 homes appraised at a QuarterMillion? Brand
new SUVs worth about 1/3 their stickerprice. Temp
full-time jobs at companies swearing-to-god they'll
make a public offering any year now?? Highways under
construction for literally the 30th year in a row.
  Let's face facts now. 
  The "American Dream" is a Bush nightmare. Justice
and liberty for all is a no-knock warrant. And XMas
dinner is A YALE-LOCKED DUMPSTER BEHIND A MCDONALDS
WHICH'LL SOON SEE THE SHERRIF'S-LOCK OUT FRONT AFTER
THE HOLIDAYS.

Is your mall 1/3 full? Is the brand new Borders Books
nearest you doing well this week or just posing?

Did I need to do three years in the US Army Signal
Corps to be able to understand the dread we all
begin feeling whilst the Tigris and Euphrates 
become little more than gigantic drain-pipes
for bloody red sausage guts?

Some will rob you with a six-gun and some with a
fountain pen.

Just focus on this thought: I'm writing this with
a Cipro sample pen (blue and white plastic pieces
all around) (floxacin HCL) which cost me nothing,
given away at some trade-expo hoping I'll buy drugs.
I write on an acid-free black and white blankbook 
journal which cost me what? My own $3.99 plus tax, 
and I'm charging you exactly 0 dollars and 0 cents 
to read this.

IN FACT: IF ANYONE'S CHARGED YOU TO READ THESE 
WORDS, DON'T COMPLAIN TO ME   O R  THEM - FIND 
SOME PERSONAL WAY TO GET EVEN.

This 'zine was free in '88 and it's free in '02. 
Not a penny spent, nor a penny earned.
  Like Ben Franklin on acid. The Peoples' Kiplinger.
Paine's popular present-day pamphlet-from-hell. And
a quadruple AWA!
  An Anecdotal Anarchist Anthem-With-Attitude.

Beholden to no one. 

As I reflect over these holy days (cancelled in 
Bethlehem by the way) I pray for one and only 
one thing for you and yours. That you may find 
yourself equally beholden to no one in each and 
every one of your endeavors. Each and every part 
of your life, and your life's work(s). 

Spend less, make less. 

And read activist times zine as often as you can.

Whenever and wherever you can.

From West Of The Mount Of Olives,
Prime Anarchist

LETTUCE

whether or not this goes to prime anarchist, it doesn't 
bother me much.  so i was reading some old issues of 
activist times, the editor of which you are, and it's 
nice seeing YIPPIEs mentioned, and Abbie Hoffman discussions.  
i'm a big fan of the 60's counterculture, Abbie Hoffman in 
particular (iim actually reading Woodstock Nation and Soon 
To Be A Major Motion Picture right now) and there's really 
no point to this e-mail except yeah, i've been reading ati, 
it's a real yipster, if you drift my catch.

SCHOOL SEIZES STUDENT NEWSPAPERS
[is this becoming a weekly trend??]

WOOSTER, Ohio -- School officials in a district where the policy 
is to allow students freedom of speech confiscated the latest 
edition of the high school newspaper before it could be released.
  Student editors believe the copies of The Wooster Blade were 
seized Thursday because an article quoted the daughter of a school 
board member saying she had consumed alcohol at a party.
  Superintendent David Estrop confirmed the Wooster High School 
newspapers were taken and said it was done on the advice of lawyers 
who said the publication had inaccuracies and was potentially libelous. 
He would not say what was considered libelous.

Might I point out that it's not inaccurate just because the Super's
lawyers say it is, and might I also point out that if it's true, it's
NOT liable, no matter how much it hurts. 

But these important things don't seem to mean much anymore, do they???
I also ought to ask, if this draws ANY kind of parallels to Noelle
Bush trying to hide crack cocaine in her sneaker while being busted
on other drug and alcohol charges.

I ate at my local FNB just now.
Saturday; Noonish. Inside the Rembert Weakland Center,
corner of Kilbourn and what street? Not actually sure.
 
So here's a little bit of a "review."

Crowded. Quite a crowd. Every time I eat with a large
FNB crowd I think of the verse of the Woody Guthrie tune
that goes "by the shadow of steeple," although this weekly
feed is NOT shadowed, in fact you go right in the door,
wave to the secretary who's about my mom's age, take a
left into the dining room, and grab yourself a plate.

There was a rice and barley dish, or maybe two kinds of
rice cooked together, a rice and beans, a spagetti sauce,
a sweetpotato mash that was out of the world, hummus, lots
of breads (I overheard there was garlic bread I'd missed
but I'm trying to stop doing the "seconds" thing lately)
and coffee. Mmmm. Delicious hot coffee. I needed that.

Food Not Bombs.

We all needed that.

TRACKING (AN) OLD PREDICTION(S)

(feb 2000)

   Mark my words.
   Britney Spears will be a Dallas Cowboys
Cheerleader within 2 years. If she doesn't
succeed Garth Brooks will buy them for her.
   If she doesn't want it, Harry Fox and
William Morris will talk her into it.

TAKE NOTE: Britney's contract with Pepsi
expires in 9 days. It was not renewed.
Wonder what old folks home she'll go to
next year? hehehehe.

DISCERNMENT: I think our prediction was off 
by one sport. Rumor has it she's joining 
the Rockettes at Radio City Music Hall. 
Now that's a hefty retirement plan.

EXCERPT: 2600'S "Freedom's Biggest Enemy"
Vol. 19 no. 3. Fall '02

...what has this got to do with us? Apparently, quite
a bit. The FBI, as we've already pointed out, now has
three essential mandates. The first two are tracking
down terrorists and tracking down spies. The third is
tracking down those behind "cyber-based attacks and
high technology crimes." It's nebulous, to say the
least. And if the ignorance we've been subjected to
over the years is any indication, harmless activity
like logging onto an anonymous ftp server on a
government site or port scanning a machine will now
be categorized as something akin to terrorism. Such
demonization is further evidence of the shameless
exploitation of tragic events to gain the kind of
control that otherwise would never be allowed. And
once put into place, this control will never be
rescinded.
  Now imagine if it were to become known that the
hacker spirit is still very much alive. That people
simply refused to back down and stop learning and
sharing information. Or that individuals everywhere
were raising objections to the heavyhanded approach
that will almost certainly victimize innocent people
who are a bit too curious and create an aura of 
suspicion around anybody who knows too much about
computers. It might open up a lot of eyes to the
fact that we're being led into a very unpleasant
place where freedom, curiousity, and independent
thought need to be carefully monitored and controlled.
  ...we intend to prove them wrong -- which is not
to say that the threat isn't very real. After all, 
a growing number of people are willing to accept
limits to their freedoms in exchange for greater
security - according to mass media. If something or
someone is labeled a risk to national security, why
let a little thing like freedom of speech or the 
right to due process get in the way of eliminating
the threat?
  Our response to this line of thinking cannot be
to simply continue to exist. Rather, we need to
STRENGTHEN our resolve, share information, develop
new and innovative tools, create an open dialogue,
and join forces with as many people as we can find
who haven't bought into the whole security through
obscurity line of thinking.
  Truer words were never spoken when we were told 
that there are people actively working to destroy
everything that's truly free about our society.
What we may have missed is the realization of how
close and how familiar these people are.
