PART ii OF "IS THE CATHOLIC CHURCH SCAPEGOATING
S/11 OR ENRON? WHAT ABOUT BOTH, WHAT ABOUT THE
WHOLE NATION? MERRILL LYNCH, IS THAT YOU???"

...the three or four hundred who do it, that's your
business.
  Is he serious? He seems to have meant it.
  Like I said, he had me, and I chose to quit rather
than take the whole place down including him, her,
him and all the others.
  What are their names? What's the corporation? Soon,
soon. Soone on the company, but you're not getting
names, sorry. That part just ain' my job.
  If you've read my columns before, you'll probably
try guessing Subway, Taco Bell, First Investors
Corporation. You're wrong, but very close. Soon,
I promise.
  So listen, corruption above me. That I can handle.
What about systemic defilement, collusion, bribery,
essentially the "caligulaism" below? Mmm. I don't 
think I can stomach that. Not when it's such a 
clearcut indication that the entire ship is made
out of veiny horrendous purple and white petrified
dog shit, OK?
  Army, you're going to guess next. My shortened
but honorable stint in the signal corps? Nope. Wasn't
there, but I can warm you up with a half-way decent
army analogy here as a minute or two digression if
you would like.

  In basic training I was a team-chief (squad leader)
because I had two and a half years college behind me. 
I was fully in charge of 10 or 11 men. The same went
for A School with about the same amount of people but
that was men and women. I think, wait. Did we see
women in A School? Yeah. That's right.
  We'd be given a task to do as a team and there I'd
be telling my entire squad they must help me. I would
work just as hard or harder than all of them for as
much of the same time as I could. I might give myself
regular breaks that they dind't get because afterall
I was the chief, right? But that's it. They were very
short breaks, just long enough really, to keep me 
going for a 10-12 hour day before sleeping for the
next day of the same old, same old. Back at it quick
enough to get in there and lead by example.
  Our squad was in danger of getting things done too
quickly, too efficiently. I came to the attention of
all three drill sergents pretty quickly. The head of
the three would take me aside at least 10 times in 
the last half of the 8 weeks and remind me that my
job was NOT to do the work, but to stand around, be
a little bit meaner, and make sure it all gets done.
IN THE TIME ALLOTTED. NO MORE, NO LESS.
  I pretended to learn and apply this valueable,
important, profound and almighty lesson. Then I
repeated my "errors" in A School. Same results only
this time in Georgia instead of South Carolina. 
Worse results actually. I guess the stakes were a 
little higher. I think I was taken aside there at
least 15 times in those 8 weeks.
  So essentially I waited out my time toward re-up
where I would opt out. Basically quitting the army.
Or the closest you can come to such a thing.
  Fortunately for my world, a medical discharge came
my way, presenting itself when they ruined my right
knee's ligament and cartilage badly enough to become
useless to them. Two operations and I was out in my
three years instead of the four I'd upped for. 9 or
10 months early if I remember right. Thank you, I'll
take it.
  Never looked back. So that points a little to the
NATIONWIDE corruption I wish to discuss here.
  Please stop trying to guess what company. I'll tell
you that soon enough. 
  So corruption below me, wow. You go to your super's
supervisor's super and discuss someone lower "ranking"
than you. 
  "Give her to me, I'll take care of her," she says.
  (TO BE CON'T In 322 and others.)

& NOW HERE'S PRIME ANARCHIST WITH A WEEKLY COLUMN

Clinton Lied; And Bush Swore By It.

So let's see if I've got this right. Decades of
the War On Drugs brought no decrease in the amount
of drugs on the streets, the amount of drugs at
parties, the amount of drugs being done by children.

The war on Terrorism is about 8 months old, and 
there's been no decrease in terrorism that anyone
can point to as "results."

Of course, we're being warned that this will take
a very long time. Hmmm. By people who will be in
office 4-8 years? Ummm. Do they give a shit what
happens on that 9th year? 

Be afraid, be very afraid.

Not only have there been no decreases in drugs OR
terror, there's been increases. Damned near to exponential.
And we'll probably argue for decades to come whether
it was a direct result of the "War On ___," or a 
side effect, or unrelated, or what. But I certainly 
have my own personal credible suspicions. They're 
probably the same as yours. And unfortunately I'm
building up such a lifetime of anecdotal evidence
it's frightening.

Where and when else in the history of humanity do
so many "credible" people ignore so many warning
signs, so much data, so much anecdotal evidence.

We're not addicted are we??

Perhaps we should look into that.

War On Drugs. Hmmm. Who was one of the biggest
recipients of good drugs during the Reagan/Bush
years?

George W Bush. No, I'm serious. He admits that 
part. And is cocky about it, to boot.

Who's probably the biggest recipient of hospital
grade cocaine and field grade heroin right this
minute? 
No, he won't admit it, but are you going to believe
him? If he bites you in your ass will you believe
him that he was only trying for your leg? He's after
your soul, you better wake up quick.

So now we're being warned by Cheney, Bush, Asscroft,
Riddler, everyone that there's soon to come terrorism
on american soil like we've never known before.

Who imported it?

I'll get extra cynical and tell you that one is from
Arkansas and lives in New York, and another is from
Connecticut and purports to live in Texas. Truth be
told they each own land in about 20 states in this
nation.

Yes, Bill Clinton and George W Bush are bigtime drug
addicts. If not up their very own noses, then for the
purpose of moving money around fast while the rest of
us suffer inflation, unemployment, gunfire in the 
streets at night, etc. 

That alone should put the two of them up for international
war crimes trials if you ask me.

Clinton lied. Sure, but George W "I can't count to 21 without
taking off my pants" Bush swears by it.

To ATI,

It's with a heavy heart that I am writing today. It's finally time to
announce the end of an era for the Essential Media Counterculture Catalog.
When I first founded EM six years ago, I was fresh out of college brimming
with passion... and I could afford to be poor. The service I provided to my
eccentric customers encouraged my efforts, as did the acclaim from
countless publications and organizations (mainstream and otherwise).
However, now I have the added responsibility of a family and am forced to
be a bit more practical. As you may have noticed, EM ceased to be my 9-5
job some time ago. I haven't been at the EM office to take your orders in
person, and I certainly have missed that connection to the "Counterculture
Community."

To allay your fears, EM is not going away completely. I'm just not certain
what shape it will take quite yet. In the meantime, it is necessary to
unload most all of the EM inventory. To that end, everything's onsale at
http://www.essentialmedia.com . Also, if you're in the Los Angeles area,
there will be enormous savings of 40% to 80% off on Saturday, June 1st, in
a HUGE PARKING LOT SALE!
Click here for details:

Feel free to drop me a line with any feedback or business development
issues. EssentialMedia.com is still among the most popular alternative
culture sites on the web!

Best,
Kevin Segall

  The phollowing trojans tried getting 
into my system just this past week alone. 
No wonder my utilities packages keep telling 
me 2x / week they need to update themselves.
These misguided (& perhaps disguided) c0derz 
must spend each waking hour trying to outwit 
each other.
  And with you and me caught in the crossfire? 
Yikes. What a world we've recreated!

oops!  a belated FAH-Q 2 column...

----------------------------------------

My son asked me...   

" Why do cats always land on their feet?"

My short answer...   

" Cats always land on their feet because they don't
want to break their necks"

Extended answer...   

" If toast always land butter-side down, and cats
always land on their feet, what happens if you strap 
toast on the back of a cat and drop it? After a great 
deal of experimentation, in which I used up two loaves 
of bread, a tub of butter, and quite a few cats, I can 
say that the results are inconclusive. Eighty percent 
of the time, the cat landed on it's feet. I suspected 
however that this might be due to the disproportion 
in the cat/buttered-toast masses. Increasing the number 
of slices of buttered toast as well as decreasing the 
size of the cat seemed to bear this supposition out. 
The closer the relative weights of cat/buttered-toast 
approached 1:1, the more the initial drop configuration
( i.e. cat up or down ) seemed to influence the landing. 
My conclusion was that buttered-toast didn't work.

  My observations, however, inspired me to try strapping 
two cats back to back and dropping them. I discovered that 
if you work from a sufficient height ( a second-story balcony 
seems to do nicely ), 30% of the time one of the cats lands on 
it's feet; however, in the other 70% of the trials, the two cats 
land on their sides. This confirmed my observations of the cat/
buttered-toast experiments, that the assemblage was capable of 
rotating under its own power as it fell. In other words, angular 
momentum was being generated, and this suggested that, if it could 
be harnessed, it might prove to be a source of relatively clean and 
cheap energy.

  I tested this hypothesis a few times with four cats strapped to a 
4 X 4  beam dropped from a height of 10 meters. Unfortunately the 
muscular energy of just four cats proved to be insufficient to cause 
the mass of the beam to rotate at all. An 8-cp ( eight cat-power ), 
assemblage with a four-cat array strapped at either end of such a beam 
should, in theory, work; but trials have revealed that, with this many 
cats involved, their individual efforts to land feet-first are canceled
out because the cats don't all try to right themselves in the same 
direction or at the same time. Although some angular motion does occur, 
it is erratic at best.

   I intend to continue this research by experimenting with lighter,
composite material beams and also with better ways of timing and
coordinating cat-effort delivery and will be getting on with it just as
soon as the suspicions of the neighborhood's ( former ) cat owners have
been allayed and a new supply of cats is available.

I cannot pronounce his Presidential name.

Still stumble over it
like getting up at night
and groping down the hall
where is the bathroom door?
eyes closed all the while
swaying holding on to the wall
then padding back to bed
pulling the pillow over my head.

As though descending into personal shame.
