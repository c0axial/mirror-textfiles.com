Try typing in the town names where Navajo Elders are
"proposedly" going to have to relocate to, see what you
get. I'm bothered by what I saw; but of course I'm a 
little biased, aren't I?
  Hi. I'm prime anarchist and this is my rant for Monday
the twenty something'th of June. Sorry I'm a little late
getting this out. I've tried to make it worth your while.
I'm in summer mode for sure. "You'll see me get predictibly
intermittant around here," he said grinningly. I was 
planning to get issue 230 out the 23rd of June just for 
the heck of it, but it just didn't happen that way. Oh 
well, stuff happens, right?
  Why do we use toilet paper?
  To me it's like shoving a Christmas tree up my butt.
Wow, that's the ultimate consumeristic climax, ennit? 
Sticking a Christmas (or should I say XMas??) tree in 
your ass.
  I think maybe "taking the powder" should be a two 
person job afterall, because then you can have the
pleasure of shoving a Christmas tree up someone else's 
ass.
  34 cents for a non-organic lemon. Now that's more like
it. Last week I paid 79c for a similar pom in the same
bin of the same store on the same day of the week. When
I went up the next street I was able to find a bag of
organic lemons almost the same size and of course twice
as sweet, (and oh, look - a seed or ten) for a volume
price of 49c each.
  Need opinion from any of our bilingual readers 
living in the americas: 
Which is more pornographic:
      (1) Unavision or 
      (2) MTV?
  Riddle - what do you call a Peruvian pack animal.
  Lima llama
  I finally figured it out. Ready to coin a new phrase?
"Rendered music," like the stuff they used to put in 
Oreo cookies before the vegans pressured them to take
it out.

There will be a walk from Big Mountain to the community of Pinon, 
led by Joseph Chasinghorse, on July 8th. The purpose of this walk 
is to underscore the need for Religious Freedom, protecting the 
upcoming Sun Dance from those who would attempt to block Sundancers 
from participating, and for unification of The People. Those of 
good heart are invited to participate in this walk.
  From July 12th through July 16th, Sun Dance Ceremonies will take 
place at Camp Anna Mae, conducted by Joseph Chasinghorse. Those who 
wish to attend are urged to bring along vegetables, fruit, fruit 
drinks and first-aid supplies. Also needed, are funds to help in 
the hauling of water and shade nets for the tops of the arbors, 
that will protect both Dancers and viewers from the heat of the sun.
  This is a very special time on The Alter, and a time of welcoming 
for all who wish to take part in it.
  For All Our Relations...

GORE TO BE PROBED FOR HECK OF IT
By Pete Yuck
Disociated Press Writer
Thurs, June 22; 5:09 p.m. EDT

CHEVY CHASE (DP) A top Justice Department prosecutor has
recommended a special counsel be appointed to probe Vice
President Al Gore "for the heck of it," government officials
said Thursday. 
  The recommendation came from an anonymous tipper (no relation) 
at Hard Times Cafe in Georgetown because she "hate[s] him for 
his 1996 fund-raising abuses. She claims she'd interviewed
Gore and President Clinton in April. 
  "I have reason to believe that [name deleted at hillary's request]
has made a recommendation that an independent counsel be appointed 
as to matters related to plungers, cigars, and assorted other items
only apropriate for places like the Starr Report," She said in a
telephone interview. 
  Gore, while campaigning for president in Minnetonka, said he didn't
know anything about a recommendation regarding plumbing supplies. 
"You're privy to news I don't have," Gore told reporters. "But if
they can prove it, I still have no comment at this time."
  At the White House, vice presidential spokesman Juan Moore Kennedy
said the office had "received no word from the Department of Plumbing 
about the reported campaign finance development." 
  "As you know, the vice president has cooperated fully with all 
requests for bathroom supplies, health and beauty aids, and small 
vermin. What we have here is a Republican senator who's just plain 
jealous. Let them get their own private taxpayer funded bath-houses," 
he added. 
  Sources familiar with [name deleted at both Hillary and Tipper's 
insistance]'s questioning of Gore in April say that the investigations
did delve into issues of cleanliness. It could not be learned from the
officials whether she wants a special room in the Oval Oriface as a
proper bribe.
  Justice Department spokesman Marlin Marlin had no comment on the
substance of the report about probing Gore. 
  "But there were enough irregularities in my bathroom visits just 
from being near this stuff," Marlin said. "This ongoing investigation 
which has prosecuted 25 people to date, just gives me the heeby 
geebies, that's all I can say at this time. It is inappropriate to 
comment on ongoing matters of plumbing, coverups and conspiracies. 
Especially when they involve internal deliberations." 
  Marlin said Attorney General Janet Weno "has done a great disservice 
to Vice President Gore because he should have been probed a long time 
ago." Apparently Weno twice rejected the notion of probing Gore -- 
once for fear of cooties, the second time because she was worried 
about fund-raising. 
  The recommendations of [] and [] will go to Weno, who ultimately
would make a decision on whether or not to use lubricants such as
fifty dollar bills or the new 700 dollar bills with Agosto Pinochet
on the front looking like Alfred E. Neuman.

PL93-531
  yet another marcopoem

There is no gold in the water.
You'll have to look in your soul.
The earth is only your mother.
You never should cut up your mother.
Look deeper in your soul.
You must find the gold in your heart.

There is no coal under my house.
You'll have to look in your heart.
At least none that I'll let you scrape.
You never should cut up your mother.
Why is your heart so colorless?
You must burn the coal in your heart.
         [for only there will it show color]

There is no uranium for you today.
You'll have to look in your heart.
I'm standing on my mother the way I was told.
You never should cut up our mother.
You need to be hit by lightning.
Only then can you have some uranium for your heart.
         [I'll be happy to give you mine]

There is no water for your slurry.
You'll have to look in your defense budget.
My mother told me to do unto others:
Here, here's half of my sword; help me dig.
I've got corn to plant.
You can't help me eat today's food... 
         [if you don't help me make tomorrow's]

Goldwater
Cold heart
Your cranium
Thrown into a marsh
Mountains of slurry will
Never hold up a house. Economics
Who's been cooking the books? They
Will soon eat books. Live by the rule-of-law
PL93-531 sucks; both figuratively and literally --
Die by the rule-of-law. That's all I can say for now.

PRIME ANARCHIST WORLD NEWZ 2NITE:
I'm typing this in from the the (AP) with horror and great 
dreadful fear for all of the people of the United States:

ALBUQUERQUE

Artist Bob Haozous says he will shave the controversial razor wire that
adorns a sculpture he created on the University of New Mexico campus.
  Haozous has reached a settlement with UNM: He removes the razor wire
that officials don't like and the university pays him the remaining
42,500
they owe him for the 90,000 sculpture.
  The artwork, installed in 1996, depicts American Indians and modern
buildings juxtaposed. It has a strand of concertina wire stretched
across the top of it.
It's entitled "Cultural Crossroads."
  University officials said they approved a concept that did not include
razor
wire. A court ruled in January that Haozous breached his contract by
adding the razor wire to his sculpture.
  State risk management attorney Robert Lohbeck says the state Arts
Division has approved the agreement.
  But Haozous and his lawyer, Barbara Vigil, are not entirely happy
about the deal.
  "It's a satisfactory conclusion, but it's a sad day for New Mexicans
when an artist such as Mr. Haozous cannot create a piece to his fullest
ability. That's my opinion," said Vigil. She added, "The wire made it a
dynamic and interesting
piece, and it was his artistic expression that was relayed thorugh the
razor wire addition."
  Haozous has said the addition of the razor wire was part of the
"maturing" of the art.

Dump Milk?
TILDEN, WI - Many of the 120 dairy farmers who attended a meeting 
on low milk prices plan to participate in a milk-dumping protest 
July 4th according to organizer Steve Siverling, a Bloomer dairy
producer, who estimates that three-quarters of the 120 farmers at
the meeting Monday night had said they would withhold their milk
from market or put it to other use.

....loosely to the tune of "Last Nite I had The

because that was written in C with 
C-FC/G EmAm DmG C/FCGC/ /  as its structure. 
Doing it in D without minors (except as implied 
by the 7th) is easier for many people to sing

I'd ever had before

I dreamed they closed the SOA

And put an end to war.

I awoke this morning to a fantasy
That happened right before my eyes
The pentagon had changed into
A place making rhubarb pies.

 "I Think"
    Cowritten by prime and the alanisbot
  
I Think pepsis are really a huge problem
I Think cokes are too much on my mind
I Think chevys have got a lot to do with why the world sucks
But what can you do?
  
Like a red rain, beating down on me
Like a nin line, which won't let go of my brain
Like keiko's ass, it is in my head
Blame it on corporate rock
Blame it on corporate rock
Blame it on corporate rock
  
I Think dustbunnies are gonna drive us all crazy
And coalmines make me feel like a child
I Think weapons will eventually be the downfall of civilization
But what can you do?  
I said what can you do?
  
Like a red rain, beating down on me
Like a nin line, which won't let go of my brain
Like keiko's ass, it is in my head
Blame it on corporate rock
Blame it on corporate rock
Blame it on corporate rock
  
Like a red rain, beating down on me

Like nin's ass, it is in my head
Blame it on corporate rock
