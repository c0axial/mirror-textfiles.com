Yes! She said that. OK Mariadolt,

I was listening to these, and thought 
you might put these in the next
ATI. These were unusual songs, 
in the fact that when they were 
put out, they very likely would 
have been banned. Country radio 
didn't touch them. So they didn't 
sell well. Talking about war and 
making a stand just wouldn't have 
went over well with the Grand ole 
Opry crowd in 1970.

Jimmy's Road
Written & Recorded 
By Willie Nelson (c)1968

This is Jimmy's road
Where Jimmy liked to play
And this is Jimmy's grass
Where Jimmy liked to lay around.

This is Jimmy's tree
That Jimmy liked to climb
And Jimmy went to war
And something changed his mind around.

This is the battleground
Where Jimmy learned to kill
Now Jimmy has a trade
And Jimmy knows it well, too well.
vc
Where Jimmy's body lies
When a soldier falls
Jimmy's body dies and dies.

(repeat first verse)

Minstrel Man
by Eddie Rager and Stan Haas
Recorded by Willie Nelson, 1970

Oh, wandering minstrel man
Singing songs of strife
How many times have you been busted
For showing signs of life?
Oh, singing minstrel man
Sometimes you get the blues
When people try to stop you 
From singing your songs of truth

(chorus)
And you sing that you're
Tired of seeing your brothers
Killin' one another
there is silver in the hall
But there's no silver in the door
But nobody wants to hear your songs of love
Nobody wants to hear your songs of love.

Oh, singing minstrel man
Trying to do your part
Telling everyone that they're blind
Until they can see with their hearts
Oh, wanderin' minstrel man
You get your clothes from the Goodwill
And your soul will never be owned
By a worthless dollar bill.

(repeat chorus)

Nobody wants to hear your songs of love.

------------------------------------
Where Do You Stand?
Written & Recorded By 
Willie Nelson (c)1970

From somewhere behind you
You come with your suitcase in hand
Hey, what's your plan?
Where do you stand?
The world's still divided
And you're still undecided, 
decide if you can
Hey, what's your plan?
Where do you stand?

(Chorus)
Where do you stand?
Where do you stand?
Hey, what's your plan?
Where do you stand?

It's time for commitments
It's time for a showing of hands
Hey, what's your plan?
Where do you stand?
Surely there's someone with courage
To say where he stands
Hey, what's your plan?
Where do you stand?

(repeat Chorus 2x)

I'm not sure how long ago this 
happened, whether just now, or last
year or what? The editor and 
publisher of an underground newspaper
on the Wisconsin Dells High School 
campus just got expelled 5 years.
Now the ACLU's considering it, and 
the lawyer of the student is on
National Public radio right now.
   I wonder what Nat Hentoff has 
to say about this one?
   "This is so far fetched, I 
just can't even believe we're 
talking about it," said the attorney. 
   Does anyone know the date of the 
expulsion?

Marco- 
I'm looking for someone 
who is  flexible, very easy 
to work with & open to alot 
of different types of music. 
It sounds like you're kind of 
set in your ways & that 
wouldn't work with me. 
Thanks for responding,

Hi Marco,
noooooo it's not REM's version of 
Superman. I froze when I saw the 
ad, but it's my 99.99% right 
guess that after turning down 
$2M from Bill Gates to use 
"It's the End of the World" 
they would never sell their 
music to IBM (and man,I would 
be one disappointed fan of their 
righteous music)...and yup, it is 
a cover of the Clique's song. My 
guess it was the work of some evil 
A&R man :-) 
Cheers,

January, 1999

To the Mexicans living in foreign 
countries:

To the Committees of Solidarity 
with the Zapatista struggle:

To the Men and Women of 
the five continents:

Brothers and Sisters:

For this year of 1999, the EZLN has
launched a new initiative of dialogue 
and peace calling for a mobilization,
both in Mexico and in the rest of the 
world, that aims to achieve the
recognition of the rights of indigenous 
peoples and the end to the war of
extermination.  An important step in 
this mobilization is to carry out a
Consultation among all Mexicans, 
wherever they may live, the 21st of 
March, 1999.

The Mexican government stubbornly 
continues not to fulfill the accords 
that it has signed recognizing 
indigenous rights, and has chosen 
openly to take the path of violence 
to try to settle the conflict, as 
the recent massacres in Acteal and 
El Bosque so clearly demonstrate.

With the goal of masking its war of 
extermination, Zedillo government 
has mounted a propaganda campaign 
abroad to improve its image 
internationally and to decieve
peoples, governments, and human rights 
organizations. 
Zedillo's government is striving to 
convince the world that there is 
no war in Mexico's southeast,
that his government wants to enter 
into dialogue with the EZLN, and 
that it is the EZLN itself that 
refuses to settle the conflict 
peacefully.

<snip>

Therefore, because we know that this 
campaign of lies will fail, today we
convoke the International Consultation
For the Recognition of Indigenous 
Peoples' Rights and the End to the 
War of Extermination.

We call upon all Mexicans over the age 
of 12 who live in foreign countries
to organize themselves and participate 
in the Consultation for the Recognition 
of Indigenous Peoples' Rights and the 
End to the War of Extermination on 
the 21st of March, 1999.

<snip> 
<anyone wanting><the whole letter>
<just ask>

Therefore
In order to stop the war of extermination,
In order to achieve the recognition of 
indigenous rights in Mexico,
In order to stop the persecution of 
which the excluded are the object,
In order to demand respect for difference,
In order to demand a world into which all 
worlds can fit,
We call an International Campaign for 
the Excluded of the World.

21Mar99. 

DEMOCRACY!
LIBERTY!
JUSTICE!

have been made."
   In the strangest contract ryder Sports

When your leaders all disgrace you
Time will come the youth shall lead
Truth prevails slow but surely
Turning you away from greed.
Piecing back the myth together
Look to what your elders taught
Peace can't come when love's perverted
Victory's only in battle not fought.
