Hola, I'm prime anarchist reporting from the 
Anarchic Circle and this is my column for 
ThirstDay, 1-13-00. 
  Overheard on radio. "How come teachers have to
take their skateboards every year?"
  Nepotism Watch: Alex Alda. Alan? Kiernan Culkin.
Macauley?
     CIDER HOUSE RULES: Homer's Odyssey.
  A great metaphor for both sides or neither side.
Your tool to make your choice freely -- without
fear, persecution or reactionary stupidity.
  John Irving may have written the 20th Century's
only real American Classic. - just my opinion. Has
anyone seen the movie yet? I hear Eryka Badu's a
hottie in it. I read the book.
  "TB is spread when a person with active TB 
coughs, sings, or speaks and you breath the 
contaminated air," says a poster on the wall
where I'm waiting to see the doctor. 
  Imagine being told you can't sing anymore? I can't
grasp that on ANY level. Wow, yuck. Inthunkable.
ADBUSTING. You've got two table parts you want to
use sandwiching one or two leaves from last holiday,
but they're sunbleached. It's time to blend them in,
isn't it?
  CUE-TIP#5. Take the peels from a lemonade you just
made from scratch. Boil them with one or two cups of
water for 20-30 minutes. Find a 100% cotton rag, and
dunk it in the hot lemonwater once it's just cool
enough to not scald. Rub and rub and watch the magic.
  Of course, you COULD always buy 2 or 3 rounds of
commercial products - but brace yourself for the 
extra elbow grease, asthma, eczema and allergies.
FOR THE RECORD: Prime Anarchist has never owned or
operated a Mont Blanc pen.
  Prime saying, have an ice day.

PRESS RELEASE:
The following is a press release that NAMA has received 
from Canyon Records regarding TWO GRAMMY AWARD NOMINATIONS 
FOR R. CARLOS NAKAI.
  This marks the second consecutive year a Native American 
artist has received a Grammy nomination (Robbie Robertson 
was last year's Grammy nominee) from NARAS, and the third 
consecutive time R. Carlos Nakai has received a Grammy
nomination:

PHOENIX, AZ (January 6, 2000)  --  R. Carlos Nakai (Navajo-Ute) 
is the first Native American to receive Grammy Award nominations 
for two different albums in the same year.  And in a rare 
occurrence, both fall into the same category "Best New Age Album."
  Recognized as the world’s premier performer of the Native American
flute, the Flagstaff, Arizona, native received the nominations 
for a solo effort, "Inner Voices" 
  http://www.canyonrecords.com/cr7021.htm
and "Inside Monument Valley" 
  http://www.canyonrecords.com/cr7020.htm
a collaboration with one of the pioneers of New Age music, flutist 
Paul Horn. "Inner Voices" features Nakai’s traditional native 
flute accompanied by a 32-piece string orchestra.  The recording 
features arrangements of Nakai’s most popular melodies by two-time 
Grammy Award-winner, Billy Williams, who produces Lyle Lovett’s 
recordings.  Williams produced another of this year’s Grammy 
nominees, "That’s Right (You’re Not From Texas)" by Lovett, 
for Best Male Country Vocal Performance.
  Nakai collaborated with two-time Grammy Award-winner Paul 
Horn on "Inside Monument Valley".  Nakai and Horn traveled 
to Monument Valley in the heart of Navajoland where they 
recorded flute solos and duets live in the canyons to the 
accompaniment of the sounds of nature.
  This is Nakai’s third Grammy nomination.  He garnered 
his first in 1994 in Best Traditional Folk Music category 
for "Ancestral Voices", a collaboration with William Eaton 
and the Black Lodge Singers. These multiple Grammy nominations 
signify a greater acceptance of Native American artists and 
their music in mainstream culture.
  A resident of Tucson, Arizona, Nakai has released over 30 
albums since beginning his career in 1983 with Canyon Records, 
an independent record company based in Phoenix.  Canyon released 
both Inner Voices and Inside Monument Valley and has specialized 
in contemporary and traditional Native American music for 49 
years.

WASHINGTON, Jan 13 (PAWN) - Michael Jackson has cloned the
first primate, a rhesus monkey, according to the latest issue 
of Scientology magazine.
  The baby, dubbed Tetrus, was cloned using a method that 
splits Cher's "G below high C" with it's "fifth" and its 
"third" - the original harmony in a recording studio to 
create multiple identical songs, officials at the Hit 
Factory said.
  "The birth of Tetrus, a healthy female cloned from a 
quarter-note, proves that this approach can result in
live music," says Pamela Anderson, the study's main 
author.

UNLIKELY INTERNET-CABLE DAD EXPOSED
(PAWN) - Wollyhood, CA - Putting a stop to any
further speculation who fathered his 2 children,
America-On-Meth CFO Steven Chase will announce in
Next month's Rolling Home magazine that it was
Jane Fondu. She stole the spermatazoa from two gay
Jesuit Priestesses and brought it in a buffaloskin
sack to Ted Turntable who then called Erich Eisener
who volunteered to insert half into the butt of AOM's 
Chase, and saved the other half in a refrigerator
for the baby's second birthday - so that AOM's 
newest might be concieved in time for DisneyWarner-
LambertSquibb's next official announcement.
  When asked how he kept it a secret for 5 whole
years, Chase said, "Sheer luck."
  "Oh," he added, "and tons of money."
  Chase said he expects to LAY OFF for a while. Then
back to rigorous exercise of perhaps 50-60 former
employees a day.
  "That's a lot of reps," he said "I've still got a
lot of luck and of course, tons of money."

APPEAL TO THE MASS MEDIA
  translated by: Joan Beecher Eichrodt
  As we have learned from reliable sources, as well as 
from secret FSB documents, the Russian leadership planned 
to have an information blockade in place before launching 
full-scale military operations in the Chechen Republic. 
It was to ensure that the Chechen people could be annihilated 
without interference. Unfortunately, the FSB's plan was
realized - but not in full.  Thanks to the courage and the 
valor of foreign journalists, what was hidden was revealed, 
and as a result many of the Chechen people were saved. Now 
that military operations have resumed in Chechnya, and Russia 
is ready to use any means, to pay any price, to get revenge 
for its defeat in the war of 1994-96, foreign journalists are 
again a stumbling block for the Russian leadership...
  ...What has particularly aroused our concern and alarm is 
the fact that the statements of Russian leaders have now been 
echoed by the US Government, which has warned American foreign
correspondents of the danger they are in when they visit Chechnya
in particular, and the North Caucasus in general.  As we know,
even in the past the Chechen Republic and the North Caucasus were
not a great place for foreign correspondents, but we still do not
understand what at this particular time has inspired top officials
in Russia and the United States to intimidate them with warnings
and threats...
  ...The absence of foreign journalists has made it possible 
for the Russian leadership to step up the war again and to 
carry out a mass genocide of the Chechen people. At this 
stage of the war, the absence of foreign journalists makes 
it possible for the Russian leadership to employ, without 
interference, hitherto unused weapons of mass destruction, 
which could lead to the total disappearance of the Chechens 
as an ethnic group.
  Therefore we urge foreign journalists not to leave the 
Chechen Republic or the North Caucasus, under any pretext.
  Journalists!
  Do not let yourselves be small change in politicians'
dirty hands; do not allow anyone to confuse your profession,
that of the truth-teller, with the oldest profession; do not 
sell yourselves.
  On the eve of the new millennium we must declare that the 
courage and truthfulness of journalists will save mankind, 
an inseparable part of which is the Chechen people!
  May the ALMIGHTY preserve you!
  Maeirbek Taramov
  Chairman, Union of Journalists of the Caucasus

  "I saw a video tape that we weren't supposed to see. 
It was prepared for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. By watching 
the tape, we discovered that, at least as of a few years ago
every tactical nuclear weapon in Europe manned by US personnel 
was targeted by an Apple II computer. Now, we didn't sell 
computers to the military; they went out and bought them at 
a dealer's I guess. But it dind't make us feel good to know
that our computers were being used to target nuclear weapons 
in Europe."

This song is about the 4 cereal box states

The closer you get to the cereal box corners
The higher you feel the presence of God

N that's because you're between 4 sacred mountains
Where Hopi and Navajo travel around
The land goes unowned, but def'nit'ly respected
What's down in the ground stays DOWN IN THE GROUND.

When walkin' around all the pottery fields
You might spot some shiny old ancient ones work
Well best thing to do's pick it up and look at it
But please put it back where you found it on the dirt.

OUR MISSION YOUR FUTURE: A Real Look At Taco Bell.
   in 3 parts by the Prime Anarchist

"Most energizing place to work."
   "Up to $7 per hour."
 "Need Motivated people."
   Taco Bell's hiring. They're always hiring, aren't they?
Will they ever not? Not on this growth model, pal. 
   Let's take a look at all that is Taco Bell. I mean a 
real in-depth look. Don't just scratch the surface. Dig some.
What do we find? 
   Most of them are shaped like what? Like a southwestern
mission. 1.3% of the world's population has a job shooting
gooey green guacamole-substance (tm) out of a grouting gun 
at a Taco Bell near you!

(CON'T FROM LAST ISSUE)

Even nations may in this manner be taught their most 
enduring lessons, and precisely at those times when 
they are preening themselves on those great qualities 
before which goes the fall. Some day, when man has 
risen from the status of Homo sap to that of Homo 
sapiens, the worst kinds of individual conflicts 
and wars between nations will be fought not with 
the destructive power of armaments but with the 
constructive power of words, by the force of 
argument rather than by the argument of force. 
To a certain extent this has already been recognized
by many societies. In every society those men are 
most admired who turn the tables upon their adversaries
by the art and virtuosity of their words rather than by 
the resort to violence.

You can play with me, you can hold my hand
We can skip together down to the pretzel man
You can wear my mommy's shoe, wear my daddy's hat
You can even laugh at me, but don't you push me down - No!

You can play with me, we can build a house
You can take my ball & bounce it up & down
You can take my skates & ride them all around 
You can even get mad at me, but don't...

You can play with me, we can play all day
And you can use my dishes if you'll put them away
You can feed me apples & oranges & plums
And you can even wash my face, but don't you...

And in the SCAM WITHIN A SCAM Department:

An email has been circulating from a "Richard Douche" who 
claims to be "president of Cyber Promotions for Columbia 
House." The email offers 10 free CD's if you email back 
to a "cyberpromotions" address, and more if you send it 
to your friends.
  The email is a hoax.  NEITHER RICHARD DOUCHE NOR 
CYBERPROMOTIONS HAS ANY CONNECTION WITH COLUMBIA 
HOUSE, AND THE OFFER HE IS MAKING IS A SCAM. If
you accept the offer it will not bring you any free 
CD's from Columbia House. You will be forwarding your 
email address and your friends' to a known spammer 
who may use them for purposes you would not expect
or approve.
  Please pass this message along to any friends who

We End This Zine With a Poem by
Larry J titled: THE JAZZ HURTS

There’s a moment
Between the notes
Between the keys
Where you have to
Hold your breath
And this ragged sharpness
Digs into diaphragm
And heart
The jazz hurts


ABOUT THE TYPE.
This 'zine was set in Konetiuk, a typeface designed by
the Yiddish poet Kudzu, and cut by the Gannett Corp
between 1928 and 1930. Konetiuk is a contemporary face
of original design, without any prior buyout agreements.
Except AmericaOnTime, 1926. The shapes of exclamation
points are derived from the famous Marilyn Monroe 
pointy evening gown. The larger display sizes are 
extremely elegant and serve a perfect and supple form
lending easily to [font size], [blink] and [img src].
