Rather than include it in the numbers run per se,
we mention that the Depleted Uranium petition is at:
http://www.PetitionOnline.com/3d4b/petition.html
for anyone who would like to sign something like 
that.
  Anyone who doesn't know all the subtle "nuancy"
differences (and sometimes not so subtle) between
uranium, plutonium, depleted uranium and assorted
other slightly volatile substances, (none of these
ought to be in your drinking water) might want to
read up on it. 
  The DU news story as a whole has been brewing 
since ATI zine was about 2 years old, and is sure
to stay a pretty big news story for a very long 
time.
  Anyone who doesn't think this is a news story at
all should have their head examined for substances
far worse than 238's & 239's.

Joe,
I'll try to do even a little better, since his columns tend
to be just a little long for this little 'zine. I bought
"All Things Censored" on vinyl LP yesterday and I'll be
happy to review it like any other record. Plus I am thinking
of making one of his next few columns the top column of
my zine and I'll take that week off. That'll be way cool.
  By the way, I had it on CD and since gave it away. When
I saw it in my favorite used record store as LP I was 
elated. Especially because I was about to hear Noelle and
Ramona's work again. Wow. What else can I say.
  Wow, 
  About as "on a move" as 
this "blanco" can get,
marco




OPEN LETTER TO DOUG BAKER
  Your petition at: 
http://www.PetitionOnline.com/3d4b/petition.html 
                    seems to be taking off nicely.
It's up to a little more than 70 signatures, and
I think that's pretty good considering how much
controversy (and also hush) there is around that
issue. I'll bet a lot of "coworkers" are afraid
to put their real name on the petition, and are
just too "uppical and eth-right" to make up a
pseudonym.
  Nevertheless, I check the thing once a day or
so, and usually I hit refresh once or twice just
before leaving to see if I can happen to get next
to that "moment" the way it happened so often with
that weirdass Nader YellowDawgDemocrats one last
October. Would you know, a couple times now I've
"seen" someone sign the thing? That's neat to know
you're right there and you see their addition the
second it got coded in. Very cool.
  Oh well, this entire letter serves me as a forum
to tell you about a first person account I drew up
regarding depleted uranium. It's at:
http://www.freespeech.org/kokopeli/pu.html 
                                     just so you
know. Or, you can get to it my favorite way and go
to:
    http://www.frucht.org/roberta.html and click on 
the word:
          URANIUM
Venceremos,

Rowan High-Jinks : An account of one person’s time at Hattiesburg High
School, Rowan Campus-by Patrick Moore (special to ATI)

(Dedicated to Mrs. Andrelle Nicholson, who had the unmitigated gall to
reject one of my original compositions and give me an "F" because she
thought it was copied, and Mr. Wally Gregg, who took it upon himself the
task of suspending me from school without so much as the benefit of a
hearing, or even telling me.)

PROLOGUE

For my part, I was one of those that scored unusually high on
achievement tests, but did poorly in classes. There was just not enough
in the HPSD to keep kids like me from looking outside the window,
because the classwork was so goddamned boring.

When I graduated in 1982, I began to discover what the HPSD failed to
offer. I took my ASVAB in 1984, and scored high enough to have my pick
of any job in the military I wanted. I chose communications. In 1987, I
began working as a direct support technician on FM tactical radio
equipment, which was a prize job. I was only one of 5 in the entire
battalion qualified for such work.

Frank Zappa once said, "If you want to get an education, go to the
library." I learned more in the Hattiesburg Public Library than I did in
the classroom. I spent so much time there that the staff allowed me
access to areas normally off limits to normal patrons. I knew the Dewey
Decimal System by heart, and the staff allowed me the unusual privilege
of setting up and running microfiche machines.  On more than one
occasion, I corrected new staff members on the proper way to thread a
microfiche. (I bet I can still thread and run an old microfiche
machine!)

Yet, in the classroom, I felt trapped.

Trapped because I wanted to take a different direction than what the
school board prescribed. The system didn’t take into account wildcards
like me, or offer anything besides the daily drudgery of classwork.

TIMELINES

DATELINE 1970: Hattiesburg High recieves a desegregation order.
Beginning at the start of the 1970-71 school year, Blair High
(Hattiesburg’s white high school) and Rowan High (the Black school) were
ordered to admit students of all races. However, many parents find ways
to skirt the order.

1972: The Justice department looks at the Hattiesburg school system, and
declares that the HPSD hasn’t taken effective steps to enforce the
desegregation order. As a result, Rowan becomes the city’s 10th grade
school, Blair the 11th and 12th.

1979: I begin my 10th grade year at HHS-Rowan, and learn about
schoolhouse politics. I thought the REACH program was off-kilter, giving
preference to children of well-to-do parents. By now it was full-blown
favoritism.

1980: I am given an assignment to write a report. I turn it in, within a
few minutes I get it back with an "F" and the word "COPIED" at the
bottom.

Two months later, I find myself on suspension. Why? I had a habit of
arriving to school early, and decided to grab a smoke before school. How
did I find out? One of my teachers told me, after he saw my name on the
daily absentee report. It seemed that Mr. Wally Gregg had decided to
suspend me for 1 day because I was smoking, and didn’t bother telling
me. (Can you say violation of the 4th amendment?) So, I took a day’s
vacation.

Then, in May 1980, I get news that somebody had torched Rowan School.
Not that it was any big surprise. Tensions had built up over the past
few years over the treatment of students by the faculty. I can only
wonder what pushed someone over the edge to actually do it.  It didn’t
take police long to find a suspect. It turned out the person that did it
had flunked several grades, and was thoroughly fed up with his treatment
by Rowan officials.

The next year, I went to Blair. Things went far better there than at
Rowan. I began getting A’s and B’s, and had teachers who were genuinely
interested in my achievement.

So, if there is to be something taken from this, it is this: just because 
you have a few setbacks in High School does not mean you will do badly 
once you leave.


[In 1982, the editor of ATI zine attended a race riot in the
cafeteria of his high school. He will write it up as a feature
story in next week's zine as a response to Patrick's great
story here. -ed]

A holiday donation in honor of our President

  Pat Morrison of the Times has a fabulous idea. Presidents 
Day is coming up on February 19. Make a donation, however 
small (or large), to a pro-choice organization and have a 
card sent to Bush basically saying:
  "President Bush, a donation has been made in your name 
to [e.g., Planned Parenthood, NARAL]."  

The following was added by Sandy Weil...or send a donation 
in his "honor" to an environmental org. or civil rights org. 
or handgun control... your choice, just do it for George!

We end this issue with a poem by
Lloyd Marbet
called : A Poet of the Environment
for William Stafford on his 80th birthday

 A poet of the environment rhymes forests into trees
whose very health roots soil within your heart.
 A poet of the environment knows naked truth
will never be clothed in robes of a dominant species.
 A poet of the environment echoes words
upon each child of your own becoming.
 A poet of the environment records this sense of place,
in familiar traces, on a timeworn path into yearning.
 A poet of the environment reaches inside the very marrow
of an immune system's poem of great healing.
 A poet of the environment breaths soul's aspirations
like ancient wisdom's awakening acceptance of no substitutes.
 A poet of the environment writes light upon shadows
embracing love to say farewell to these words.
