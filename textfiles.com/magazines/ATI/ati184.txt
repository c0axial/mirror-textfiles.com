Telemarketing: Subtle Form Of Daterape?
"No thanks, I'm not interested."
"Well, Mr. Anarchist, can I call 
you Prime? Before I worked for this
company, I had the same concerns; I'm sure I can..."
   "Do not try to handle any more of my objections. 
I'm not interested, thank you anyways."
Short energetic pause.
   "Well Prime, if you ever are 
interested in MCI hush service feel
free to call me back at 1800-yadayada."
   Does that sound familiar?
   "Oh come on. Just let me nibble a
little NEAR your you-know-what, what
could it hurt?"   
   "No."
   "Do you mean 'no,' no? Or 'no'
maybe and perhaps yes soon?"   
   GO AWAY.
   I might have to play rough, if any
of you think my little "don't handle
any more of my objections" tool doesn't go far 
enough (it works wonders on most fonerapists) 
you might follow me on this next one. 
   "may I interest you in..."
   "How do you expect me to teach your
children nomeansno when hordes of 
vultures like you are making 5 bucks

   -click.   
   Perhaps I'm a dreamer but if
2/3 of these schmucks quit over it,

Welcome to ATI184. Hot enough for you?
Allouez, WI. August 1, 1999. 3am!
We got some groovy submissions this week.
I think you'll really like this issue. 
Something for everyone. 
Icons for nothing and your clicks for free...
Hey Kinko's:
   I hear you're hiring third shift copy
consultants all over this country of mine.
I see it's a great job that enjoys competitive
salaries, medical bennies, 401K, advancement,
and performance incentive pay programs.
   Hmmm. Are we guaranteed a job 120%???
   Well, 2 quick things:
1) If you stop banning sights like 
http://www.freespeech.org perhaps younger people
who share my concerns might actually apply.
2) You're asking for resumes. I trust you're 
offering $13 / hr or more, right? Anything less
warrants an application and an interview.
NOT A RESUME.

I'm not sure if this counts, but I smoke 
winstons.  They claim and I believe that 
there are no additives (besides paper

In case you were wondering, "Packet 
Radio" is the data communications
service of Ham Radio. There are 
PBBS (Packet Bulletin Board Systems) 
on various frequencies in the 2 meter 
(and above) amateur radio bands. you
need a ham radio license to transmit, 
and while anyone can receive ham
radio transmissions, it's rather 
tiresome to spend the money for the gear
to decode the stuff if you can't fire up 
the transmitter and join the fun. 

You can usually hear what it sounds 
like on 144.390 MHz on any "police
scanner". On this frequency, people 
are taking the output of their GPS
recievers, and transmitting their 
location. With software freely
downloaded off the net, you can receive 
the data, and have the fellow show
up on a map generated on your PC screen. 
Even a 386.

The trick is, you can get a ham license 
by simply reading a book, passing
a test your local ham radio club will 
give you for about 5 bucks, and you
no longer need Morse Code to get 
on the air. Anyone who wants more 
info can drop me a line.

On Mythology, Civilization, and Star Wars
By Carl Franklin
Email: carl@franklins.net
July 25, 1999

(continued from last week)

...the fountain that is the soul of the artist 
(however shallow) and the fan. It is both at once
intimate and universal. This is a quality of the 
spiritual experience. Personal and Universal. 
A good Christian's relationship with God is very
personal. There is the one-on-one dialog of prayer, 
or the confessional. And then there is the sensation 
that God is a part of every living thing. That
God is something bigger than ones self.

Here is an excerpt from a favorite song of mine 
by the Grateful Dead, Ripple:

        Reach out your hand if your cup is empty
        If your cup is full may it be again
        Let it be known there is a fountain
        That was not made by the hands of men

        There is a road, one simple highway
        Between the dawn and the dark of night
        And if you go no one may follow
        That path is for your steps alone

        Ripple in still water
        Where there is no pebble tossed
        Or wind to blow

A simple observation really. There is a fountain that was not made by 
the hands of men. This is what I'm referring to. This is the fountain 
from which the wisdom of the past flows forward. It exists. We did not 
create it, or at least, not intentionally.

Choose your own path. No one may follow you. It is for your steps alone.
This is so important. It does not matter how you get to the fountain. Just
get there. You can call it whatever you want. It will always be what it is.

What do you think of when you hear "Ripple in still water where there is no
pebble tossed or wind to blow". The water was undisturbed by humans,
animals, and the forces of nature. Yet, there is a ripple. I don't know, but
it feels like "This wisdom ripples forth whether or not you are there to
observe it."  Or to quote George Harrison of the Beatles, "Life flows on
within you and without you."

I'm sorry if this stuff sounds corny, but the gist of it is that there are
certain essential pieces of knowledge that we all must learn. If we do not
learn them from religion, then we must learn them from our parents, books,
our schools, movies, rock stars, or some other source.

The Hero Story

Every culture has a hero story. The oldest surviving epic in British
Literature is a poem called Beowulf, which was written in Old English about
1100 AD, It describes the adventures of a great Scandinavian warrior of the
sixth century. Basically, a monster attacks the castle and Beowulf comes to
the rescue. He then becomes king and goes on to fight the dragon, a battle
which he loses.

Long before that, there were stories of heroes that stole fire from a deity
or some such thing, Prometheus for example steals the fire and brings it
back. A fundamental aspect of the hero story is the completion of a deed, a
venturing forth and a returning - victorious.

The hero story is still with us in the form of movies like Star Wars and
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. They endure because they are worth
writing about. The wisdom that is imparted just by being in the presence of
a hero is instructional and inspirational. We look up to heroes and identify
with their powers and their shortcomings. We emulate them in our meager
lives. They give us the power to persevere, to always do the right thing,
etc.  We hang all of the virtues we value on our heroes for all to see. This
is essentially a spiritual experience, just as I've described before.

George Lucas' Star Wars is full of this essential diet of wisdom, yet it is
cleverly masked as a shoot-em-up space opera.  This is a classical hero
story. The first movie released was called "Star Wars: A New Hope" although
most everyone just calls it Star Wars. For sake of argument, I like to refer
to it as "The Fourth Episode" because it is the fourth movie in a series of
nine.

In Star Wars, young Luke Skywalker awakens to the idea that he must save the
world from the Empire. He ventures forth on a journey to Alderan with the
Jedi Master, Obi Wan Kenobi. In most of these hero stories (as in life)
there is a mentor, and older wiser one who imparts his or her wisdom on the
young apprentice. Well, we all know what happens. Luke finds himself in the
middle of it. The embodiment of evil turns out to be his father. He must
face him.

There are so many aspects to this movie that warrant attention, but I want
to focus on...
(CON'T next week) Final Part. If you're 
in a hurry to see the rest of this,

A Prime Anarchist Opinion Quickie...

The charge for raping a poor person in the US has
gone up to $90,000.
   We need to consider voting down the $200,000
presidential salary increase for that reason alone.
That would give the Commander-In-Briefs an unfair
advantage over Senators and Congresspersons.

Walk-Mart Targets Everyone.
     ----
     PAWN

BENDERVILLE, Ark - WalkMart Stores Inc, the world's
largest public nuisance, has offered to buy 
Proctor & Gramble, Unilover, Revloon, Fnord, 
Amerika On KLine, Old Naval, and Grrlman Sacks for
an undisclosed item.
   "If P&G lets us buy them," Said Britt BMW, a 
resale acquisitions consultant, "then we can easily
clean up all the others."
   He said if they are successful they could move 
into other household cleaning products too, such as
DOW/Cornea, Hair Force, and General Pneumatics.

Living on the Railroads
a poem by John Labovitz

If I lived here, in the lonely old 
railroad yards, I'd plant lettuce
between rail ties, tomatoes along the
sidings, beans on the roofs of 
switch houses, eggplants in the rusted
hulks of old cars, strawberries in
the roundhouse. 

If I lived here, in the stations long 
abandoned, I'd invite deer into
freight warehouses, skunks into
depots, snakes into mail-rooms, 
crows into signal towers. 

If I lived here, on the railroads 
left for dead, the grades would turn
to rushing streams in the spring,
fish would gather in switchbacks and 
side spurs, and the railroads would
live again.

(times in this zine  this week!  What do )

We end ATI Zine #184 with two poems by
Travis Ray Cole

"Pain of love"
variation without a theme
stealing away my dream
loving just to see
what is left of me
it will never be
theres no nothing for me 
you dont want me
you dont want me
ITS NOT ME
Its not me its you
its not me its you
its not you

Travis Ray Cole


"AND IF THERE IS"

And if there is a you
there is a me
And if there is love I am free
and if there is an end
I will die not me
And if you want me
come get me
and if you know say so
and if we cant make it work 
there is no answer
because no one else is for you
as noone else is for me
and if I was then I am
and only you can make me who I really am
and if theres noone
we are still we
and I do love you
I want to hold you
with every line you put a hold on me
and if there is freedom
there is a lie
only because you are really mine
