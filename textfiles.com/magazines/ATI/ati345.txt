I keep trying to figure out how to make my guitar stop 
Bush in his tracks and otherwise radically transform 
the world as we know it, but all it seems to do is 
produce various melodic notes of one sort or another.

   Oh well. So I'm trying a little gimmick here. 

FOR A LIMITED TIME ONLY, like, say, til the end of March, 
I have EVERY song from my FIVE most recent CDs available 
for free download on http://www.mp3.com/davidrovics. The 
idea is to instigate a flurry of emails that people will 
send to everyone they know, turning new people on to these 
songs with the exciting prospect of being able to download 
EVERYTHING for free, rather than just the usual selection 
of a few songs from each CD.

what you can for him. He totally rocks.

We'll discuss David Rovics a little more later.

So welcome to ATI issue 345. It's Friday, 7 February. 2003.
I guess lots of slow in southern new england, eh? None here.
Just really really really cold. 

Wow, when I think of the number 345, "45" sticks out. 
Besides being a particularly devastating handgun caliber, 
the number 45 represents something else, which at first 
will seem totally unrelated, but quickly become quite 
connected in your minds' eye. 

The 7 inch record. Yup, the 45. 45 RPMs. Now what the 
heck would a .45 gun have to do with a hit single? Well, 
two things to take a quick peek at which should be quickly
representative of everything else.

Jennifer "Puff Daddy" Lopez, and Ronnie "Phil Specter" Ronnettes.

Yup. Guns, guns, guns.

Hey Phil Spector, Ashleigh Banfield and Bill O'Reilly.
Live by the corporate media, die by the corporate media.

to Marco:

      February 4, 2003 
Dear friends: 
I'm currently recording a CD of original songs, and I'm writing 
to ask if you'll help me achieve this goal.  Recording and mass-
producing compact discs, usually involving a minimum order of 500 
units, can be expensive, so I'm asking if you'll "pre-order" your 
CD's to help me cover my costs. 
Each completed CD will sell for $15, and every "pre-order" I 
receive will help me to cover recording and manufacturing costs.  
When the CD's are completed, hopefully in March, you'll receive 
yours "hot off the press" (be sure to blow on them before putting 
them in your CD players). 
Thank you all for being in my life, and thank you for considering 
supporting me in this way. 
Please feel free to contact me via the 
Internet if you have any questions: 
http://www.michaelkrieger.com 
or 
MAKrieger@aol.com. 
                    With love, 
                    Michael Krieger 

[REPLY: Michael, I can't afford a CD right now because of my
current lifestyle, but I'll certainly tell many people about
your project. -- marco ]


LETTUCE FROM THE DEEP SOUTH:

Prezados irmãos e irmãs-em-artes,
 
Que bom ter Marco Capelli como meu irmão-em-artes.
E que bom também apresentar a arte dele a todos voces.
Ele é um cantor e compositor.
Suas canções são poderosas mensagens político-sociais.
 
Vale a pena ouvir:

AND NOW A NOTE FROM THE MIRC PEOPLE:

Join the Global Protest against War. (February 3rd 2003)

IRC has always been about communication, about dialogue. 
We are against any war and violence, as long as talk is 
still possible. On the 15th of February, the day after 
Valentine's day, millions of people around the world 
will take part in anti-war protests. More than half a 
million people are expected to take part in an anti-war 
march in London alone to protest the war against Iraq. 
Be one of them. See the Stop the War website to find 
out about protests in your city.

As Maureen Dowd, writing for the New York Times, wrote, 
"Mr. Powell can't very well seduce the world into bombing 
Iraq surrounded on camera by shrieking and mutilated women, 
men, children, bulls and horses."



Dear   Editor:
I  am   honored    to    submit    the    enclosed    
collection    of   poems    for    your    consideration.

This    work   is   submitted   on   a  free   basis,   
so   no    charges   are    made    for   its   use    
in    your   magazine.  Let    it    serve   the   cause   
of   faith,   democracy,   and    freedom.

Meanwhile, I regret  to  inform  you  that  email  submissions   
are  the  only  real  outlet  for   me.  Sending   snail-mail  
from    Russia   overseas   is   madly   expensive - sending  
a  single  message  may  cost  almost  as  much   as   two  
hours  of internet  connection. More  than  that, as   my   
previous  experience   shows, traditional  mail  messages    
often   either  get  irretrievably   lost  or  arrive  to  
editors  almost  torn  to  pieces. I have  received  numerous  
complaints  to  that   effect. Email  submissions,  provided   
they  contain  no  attachments, are  much  safer  in  this  age  
of  terrorism  and  other   malicious  activities.
 
    Yours    faithfully,
     Vladimir    Orlov.

BLACK   NIGHT.
 
The   arid   fields   of   dusty   silver
lie   fallow   for  years   and  years   that  pass
in   the  farewell   trembling   hues
of   the  night   too  black   and  dazzling
to   look   real.
The  placid   ponds  of  gilded   lilies  ripple
with   the  sinking   shades  of  this  suffocating  
twilight,  the  black  night’s  faithful  employee.
The   corrupted  fates   of  grandeur,
formerly   sparkling,  now  vexed   and  weary,
lie  scattered   on  the  banks  
which  the  nightly  Rider of  Justice  haunts.

THE   MARBLE    TOMB  TO   CROWN   LIFE.
 
It   was   caused   by   nothing,
aimed   at   nothing
but   popular   outrage.
Frustration,  discontent, unrest --
all  these   offsprings
of  the  disabled   single  party  rule
are   now  issuing  their  pervasive  yells
all   around   the   new  
 and  the  same  old  country
caught   up   in  complex   implications
of  its  discarded   but  
 thoroughly   tenacious   past.
 
The    unknown   present  day
breaks   in  upon   the  petrifications
of   what  has  been   sanctified   
by   the   multitudes   of  the  ever-marching
purple,  red,  bloodstained,  bleeding
banners  now  carried  high
by  the  staunch   advocates
of  the  good  old   totalitarian   days.
 
Their   lofty   calls
seem  to  fail  to  chime
with  the  somewhat   less  lofty  
cries   of   those  butchered  
in  Stalin’s   prison  cells,
now   wafted  to  the  marchers’  ears
from  the  cells  
of  their  own  lingering   memories -
The  marching  former  convicts
crave  for  Stalin   whose  much  lamented  death
let  them  out  of  the  prison  cells
but  buried  them   
in   those  of   their  wounded  souls -
Are   these  parading   relics   just  the  guns
Stalin  triggers   off
from   under  his  marble   tomb?
The  marchers  never  question.
They   are  called  up  from  the  past
and   are  here   to  obey.

I  WILL   SEND  MY  MESSAGE    COLLECT.
 
I  will   send   them   all  the  torn-out   copies
of   my   last   message   collect,
as   I  stand   breathing  in  the   sight
of   the  frozen   silver,  its  faulty  light
fettering   the  river’s  glassy   ice.
My  memory,  in  its  inveterate  longing  
to   plunge   into  the  sweet   water  of  hope,
is   being  thrown  to   the  gusty   summit
where   regiments  of  ghastly   ghosts  gather
to  perpetrate   their   ghoulish  parade.
Time   rumbles   down   the  bumpy  street
of  my   crumbling   consciousness, as
I   am  being   effectively  run  down  by  its  heavy  cart
which   used   to  stop   at  my  beck  and  call  before,
but   which  now  will  positively   not,
even   if  I   vociferously   plead   with  it.
Days  are   being  sipped   out  of  me,
with   relish,  by  the  subtle  connoisseurs
of  the   delicious   wine  of  time  and  age.
I  will  send  them  all  the  torn-out  copies
of  my   last  message   collect.

CAGED   RESPITE.
 
Life’s   refugees   used  to   willingly
lock   themselves   in  these   endless  fields
of   the  golden  cages   unfolding   all  around
in   the  menace   of   their   deceptive   splendor
that  the  life’s   loyal   martyrs   eagerly  fall  for,
longing   for   a   minute’s   respite
from   the  uncanny   pain  
of  vulgar  day-to-day   existence.
Anticipating   the  audacity  of  a  departure,
shunning   the   rip-off  of  a  return,
the   poor   convicts   on  the  death  row
of   the  guillotining  golden   cages
are  still  readily   reaching  out  to  them,
to   the  stretching   swampy   fields  of  them
running   far  beyond  the   life’s   horizon,
so   peacefully  and  joyfully   serene
in   their  placating,  inviting, vermilion   green
of   the  countless  time-chariots  of  pastures
affording   the   ready   oblivion   
the   convicts  are  yearning  for.

CAGED    GARDEN  OF   LIFE.
 
In  a  gloomy   garden  of   the  golden  cages
suspended   on    the  golden   chains
at   the   whim    of  a  wistful   gardener,
trees    of  a  quashed   joy   rustle  alive,
alive   to  the  roaring   wind  rudely  stripping   them
of   their   yellow   apparel   of  an  anticipated  slumber.
Lawns   of   gilt  offer   their   own
rampaging    yellow,  lawns  of  a  decaying   life
stifled    to   death  by  the  marauding  weeds.
The  whole   garden  is  an   ungainly  cage
of   rust   which   is  the  gold’s  aftermath.

  6.. Anarchists - are committed to distributing illegal (or at least
morally suspect) information, including but not limited to data on
bombmaking, lockpicking, pornography, drug manufacturing, pirate radio, and
cable and satellite TV piracy. In this parlance of the computer underground,
anarchists are less likely to advocate the overthrow of government than the
simple refusal to obey restrictions on distributing information. They tend
to read Cult of the Dead Cow (CDC) and Activist Times Incorporated (ATI).
  7.. Cyberpunk - usually some combination of the above, plus interest in
technological self-modification, science fiction of the Neuromancer genre,
and interest in hardware hacking and "street tech." A youth subculture in
its own right, with some overlaps with the "modern primitive" and "raver"
subcultures.

====================

There is a place where the culture of text-based zines 
will live again. And you, my friend, when you want to
read zines in the .txt format in the internet, you will
want to visit a site where you can read the most recent
the zine world has to offer. And if you haven't heard 
of http://www.textscene.com by that time, you will sulk 
the night away, wishing that you had some way to get your 
hands on subversive writings by up and coming writers. 
So find out about textscene.com. Find out about it right

Taking The Dump

a public domain poem
by marco

You must to scream
When dumping at the dump
Sure,
You jumped for joy when you received stuff,
You're grunting - 
As you lift it;

Out of your truck

Why not scream while it leaves
Your hand

And sails into the landfill
       Let it go 
       With catharsis
And screaming
Screaming
It can be your
Scapegoat. Sure.

Instead!

Of your best friend
Or lover, or co-worker
Acquaintance (sp?)
Or guest.

Scapegoat.

Even your Charlie Brown Tree
Can go to the dump
In the composting section.

So you'll feel good about yourself;
The world around you,
Filling up with catharsis.

And scapegoating
And screams
And dumps.

Sure,
You must to scream
When dumping at the dump.

AFTRA And SAG Will Merger With AFL And CIO.
(PAWN) - Follywood Fills, CA. - The world's two largest
union conglomerations would merge into one organization
with seperate affiliates for each type of worker under a
proposal to be considered this war.
  The proposal would require 60% of members from both
SAGAFTRA and AFLCIO. 
  Supporters say this maximizes the unions' strength at
the bargaining table with other corporations who mergered
already.
  SAG rejected merger plan in 1999 but many bosses have
retired, resigned or died every other month or so the past
few years. The newer bosses say they are hopeful.
  The new mega-union will be called CIAFASTGLADFRAG.
