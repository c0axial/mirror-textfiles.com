Who Stole The Webby News Award And Why
  by _John Johnson's Son_
    [some names have been changed to protect the anarchist]
"The Webby Awards are a celebration of corporate domination over
the internet. The whole purpose is to take a popularly created
participatory and democratic medium and laude the work of people
who are squeeze profit out of it. Sure there are some categories
such as activism, the arts, and weird, but the focus, in their
rhetoric and during the ceremonies, are the profit hungry dot
com's."
I know the person who stole the webby award in the news category
to protest the corporate domination over the news media both in
the traditional and online mediums. I'm paraphrasing words he's
posted around the net a bit and I've added some of my own
observations.
  Why? Because I don't want him to get in trouble, but I also
don't want to not tell this story because if it doesn't get
told we're all sure to suffer.
  You ready?
When he got up to the stage he placed a copy of Noam Chomsky's
"Manufacturing Consent on the podium, grabbed the news award,
and yelled "Fuck the corporate media!" into the microphone.
Unfortunately they had already turned off the podium microphone
speakers and only the online audience heard his message. Award in
hand he ran back down the stage and tried to leave the opera house.
One of the webby security guards grabbed the award out of his hands
as he pushed through the doors. He said something like "oh no you
don't" and he didn't feel like fighting over, and breaking, the
spring so he gave it back to him. He ran it back down the hall giving
it to winning news people.
"Let me say that it wasn't an official 'stunt' and the webby people
really didn't like my action," he wrote somewhere on the net. "They
apparently do like my website, [     ] as it's been nominated for a
webby award both times [they've had a certain] category."
  Some other higher up in the webby hierarchy came over to chew him out
for "messing up their well planned event" and that they'd had to get the
inside.com guy to fly out at the last minute from New York. After hanging
out in the back of the theater for a while, not thinking it wise to walk
back up to his third row seat, the security guards found him and tried to
kick him out. They said "that was not cool, not cool." He told them he was
a nominee and they let him stay. They said something about how if he was
ANYTHING other than a nominee they'd kick him out. It's pretty doubtful
that if he were a corporate sponsor they'd even threaten to kick him,
but that's what they said.
"I ran in to one of the judges in the hall," he says, "who I'd been
talking to before. He again went off about how hard they worked to pull
off this highly scripted event and I was messing it up for everybody.
When I quipped that Webbies even have a tradition of disruption and I
hadn't even thrown the webby at the audience like ___.org had, he said
that it was a long time ago, implying that things had changed, now at
the webbies."
  ______.org had called them "greedy corporate bastards" back in 1999,
and they still are greedy corporate bastards. Only now they're whining
about the dot bomb deflating their portfolios.
  The webby awards have celebrated sites that pioneer the breaking down the
wall between advertisers and news content such as amazon, inside.com, cnn,
beliefnet, babycenter and many others. This is the wrong direction to take
our collective technological development. We have a choice, either we can
use this amazing new medium to become a truly popular mass medium where
everybody has a voice or we can use it to drive hyper consumerism and
friction free capitalism. For example, the technical achievement award
went to Microsoft Windows Update and not projects that have been both
major technical achievements and fulfill the internet's potential as a
libratory medium.
"I see such projects as FreeNet, Ogg Vorbis, Gnutella, Apache, *BSD,
and Linux itself as all being much more important technical achievements.
MWU is a clever way for Microsoft to send you bug fixes! Bugs they created
and bugs that are a result of their top heavy corporate development model."
  When television, radio, and cable were introduced there was a struggle
between people who wanted to use the medium for the common good and people
who wanted to use the medium for profit and to reproduce the conditions of
inequality and domination. The question was, do we use this new technology
to reduce social, economic, and information inequality, or do we use it to
create a new class of wealthy. This struggle has played out across the
world. In the US we have the most corporate and profit driven society and
our media systems have been shaped to reflect and reproduce those values.
Quickly we saw the rhetoric of the 'information superhighway' be replaced
with the ecommerce gold rush. The internet is a creation our society, like
all communications mediums it is communal property.  We must not let the
internet go the way of the newspaper, radio, television, and cable. The
communications commons must not be partitioned and sold for private
profit.
  Perhaps this collapse of the hyper inflated internet stocks will help
us take the internet back from the VC's, dot commers, marketing spin
meisters, and ecommerce biz dev stiff's. This is a medium that can allow
us to radically change the balance of information power. Foucault said
"Power is not possessed, rather is exercised." We must exercise our power
as creators of technology, consumers of news and culture, people who are
willing to think critically about the world to fight for the liberation
of our internet.
