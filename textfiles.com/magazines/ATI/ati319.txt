PUBLISHER'S COLUMN 

Here you'll find out why we went for a first 
draft which scooped this zine and etc., any
further questions or misunderstandings should
be directed to:

ati@etext.org

issue 319. Hmmm. half of this is already on atlanta imc because 
coyote wanted me to put moebus' part one poem up so he could get
the other two right next to it.
  So what else is there besides this column, hmm more numbers, a
couple letters and stuff? Well, a whole lot of whatever I guess. 
I betcha when I get home the zine finishes itself in about an hour. 
Maybe I'll spend the rest of the weekend marking up html from 5 or 
10 issues like I should have done weeks or months ago. 
  Yeah.
  So you must call this a column. Should I make it column length?
Hmmm. Maybe I should have an intro, a large body and a summary at 
the end that brings you back to the intro for an efficient ending.
Like a traditional column, the kinds you find syndicated all over
the world by middle aged upper middle class white men mostly and
a few assorted others here and there dotted across each hemisphere,
each paid between 40 and 140 bucks a week to write "on deadline."
  Yeah, what am I Miles Davis or something? Bring you back to the
intro for a nice tidy comprehendible ending?? What, ever. You get 
a bonafide rant. You'll know how long it is when you get to the 
end. Me too. That's just how it is. That's how it's always been, 
right? What is and what should never be.
  Listen, I'm sitting in a coffee shop hearing my friend Jon sing 
a Zeppelin song accompanying himself on a 12-string guitar. 
  Now's the time, the time is now... Ramble on. Yeah. 

  ==== 
GRAFITI - Disco Still Sucks.
  ====

  Jon's doing a Radiohead song now.There were many in between, 
but this one really got my attention.  Call that a concert review 
I guess, eh? Ladies and Gendarmes, the world's shortest, sporadickest, 
strangest, spontaneousest show review you're ever seen.

====

  Trivia question:

No, wait. Trivia answer. No question.
World's largest yeast factory ever
was right on the fox river.
  Yup. Green Bay, Wisconsin.  
  No wonder Nixxon condemned that
river!

====
I guess I'll end this column with a quote.
  Yeah, I know you're used to things beginning with a quote. 
So call this the beginning and the beginning the end. Tell 
yourself you're satisfied with that.
  So there.
  "Clothing is not even on Manslow's hierarchy of needs."

"It's unpatriotic not to stand up, look them 
in the eye, and ask the questions they don't 
want to hear - they being those who have the 
responsibility, the ultimate responsibility - 
of sending our sons and daughters, our husbands, 
wives, our blood, to face death." -- Dan Rather




POEM FROM THE 21ST CENTURY'S
SMEDLEY BUTLER   - Jeff Moebus

Please consider for a moment
the following obscene question:

What would be the impact
of a second major terrorist attack
against the United States
in the near future?

Will anyone still care
about what happened
before September 11?
About how much the President knew
and when he knew it?

Will anyone still care
about Enron
and its links to the Oval Office?
Or last year's energy "crisis" in California?

When it is "proven"
than Sadaam
is "responsible,"
who will challenge
the launch
of massive military force
against
(and the "liberation" of )
Iraq?

Will the Democrats
maintain control
of the Senate
in the 2002
Congressional
elections?

What would happen
to the barely renascent
peace, justice, and anti-globalization
movements?

In recent days,
The Agenda
has suffered
a number of annoying setbacks:
a failed coup in Venezuela;
a defeat in the Senate on ANWR;
and another on "fast track".

And now,
allegations and revelations
surface
about who knew what
and what they did and did not
do
prior to September 11.

The media and the Democrats
are starting to get uppity
again.
Apparently forgotten
are the Superstar anchors and
senior Loyal Oppositionists
in the Days of the White Mist
late last September.

Things are getting fuzzy.

The American people are getting unfocused.
Just like they were on September 10.

They are getting just like all those flags
put up in those exciting days way back then.
Put up and left up and out --
in the rain, in the dark,
on car antennae
and out windows
and on roofs.

The Focus of the People
is becoming frazzled and faded,
and ragged and tattered,
and shredded, unraveled,
and tired.

They've even stopped singing
"God Bless America"
at baseball games.

Please consider for a moment
the following obscene question:

What will be the impact
of a second major terrorist attack
against the United States
in the near future?

Short ARA poem: Friends don't let friends become nazis




PLEASE PEEK AT THE PHOLLOWING PWEBSITE.
(yeah, I know; the pee is silent)

http://palestine.indymedia.org/process/about.php 

I'm of the opinion that this page should be listed 
next to canonical classics such as orwell's "why I 
write" and homer's "odyssey"


Poem -
We hate to love each other
We love to hate each other
and we hate to hate each other
but we fear it's just not possible
to love to love each other

That
my friend
Is the matrix
Any who say we are not
in it are lying or unaware.




Is anyone else aware that common courage press just got their 
assets frozen right before publishing a book about enron? 
http://www.commoncouragepress.com/currentpressrelease.cfm 
(I just found out this morning) 

I haven't even had a first cup of coffee yet. 
An acquaintance of mine just found out his newest book 
won't be able to go to a next printing because Bank One 
froze the assets of Common Courage Press. 
This comes at a very unusual moment. Perhaps Common 
Courage didn't know that a different book they were about 
to publish might just in fact be the killing blow for Enron. 
They're also distributing "Merchants of Misery," which mentions 
Bank One. 
Perhaps none of us noticed, but the US GNP seems to be tied 
directly to Enron's caligulaic success. Perhaps a big enough 
devastation at ArthurEnrondersonMicrosoftAOLTimeWestinghaus 
is in danger of dismantling the entire mafia that is the 
Untied States "government." 
I use that term loosely; we are being governed by thugs. 
Of course the thug-in-chief is unabashed about his prior 
cocaine use, and he probably sits smug about the fact that 
Secret Service are always sworn to secrecy about what I'm 
sure is current cocaine use; and you can quote me on that. 
I've yet to see him "in the act," but all the signs are there. 
Did you hear how out of breath he was yesterday? No one said 
he jogged or anything. His heart was racing like he just 
popped three black beauties. And I'm sure bush isn't a speed 
freak. That is "so uncouth" and below him. How long IS his 
pinky fingernail these days? 
But I digress. George W Bush's corruption is very 
unimportant to me at this moment. 
Bank One is a motherfucker. 
I don't use that term lightly. Where's the outrage in 
any of this? I can mention some local flavor about Bank 
One (or Banc One they like to call themselves around 
Switzerland and other parts) that maybe ought to be 
explored a bit. 
Marquette University is pretty vested and invested in 
Arthur Anderson. They've been trying to reposition things 
a bit ever since the whole Enron fiasco started vibrating. 
I wonder how many holdings they might have in Bank One? 
Bank One brokered a silent anonymous donation of $5000 a 
few months ago to a small homeless shelter I volunteer at. 
No strings attached, no relationships. Just that one of 
their customers would like to send us that gift anonymously. 
We accepted it, since no strings were attached. 
Or were there? 
Was it really a customer? Or was someone in the employ 
of Bank One shifting things around a bit? We'll probably 
never find out. But I'd like to know. 
Bank One is somehow entangled in a scandal at one of 
the other shelters around town. I don't know all the ins 
and outs and there's not a lot going around beyond rumor 
and innuendo, so I won't go into any great detail. But 
I will say that last night I went to bed thinking Bank 
One might be one of the "good guys" in this mess; but I 
woke up this morning, before coffee even, wondering if 
maybe Banc One hasn't spent the last year getting fully 
taken over by reactionary right wing lunatic fringe people 
working directly for George W Bush and his Houston, Texas/ 
New Haven, Connecticut criminals. 
I think I'll ask my local mayor to ask all the other 
mayors next month if they realize what a bunch of misfits 
their local Bank One people are.

And now, a word about Bimbo Baked Bread.

Bimbo. Pan Enriquecido.

OK, more than one word. A few words, phrases,
sentences. Paragraphs really.
  Here. Read up on Bimbo:

(no! we're NOT making this up)

Beacause DIVA LAS VEGAS	is about to happen, 
we bring you something we'd cut from ATI two 
years ago. Yeah, didn't make the grade. But
You'll see little has changed in all this time, 
hence this two year old rant is perhaps more
valid than ever before.


There's one reason I watch vh1's 100 greatest 
women in rock, as part of the borrrrrring Divas 
Week III in 3d.

Susan Sarandon.

I can't think of a better voice to host this 
otherwise washed up old tired worn out idea. 
She lives what she believes, and believes what 
she lives.

Hearing her honor women in any way carries 
more weight than anything some middle aged ASCAP 
payola geek could ever do.

I just hope wymyn rokkers can go past this, and 
past "oh, ok, a chick band, we don't have to pay 
'em as much, fine..." and get out there and kick 
some serious "butt." God knows the Republican 
Rock & Roll industry needs it.

Stevie Nicks, now why isn't SHE a "Diva?" And my 
first thought when I heard of Divas 3 in 3d, I 
mean D2000, was where's stevie, where's Dar Williams, 
where's Jess Klein? You're missing something great 
people, it's called inspiration, it's called music, 
it's called art. These wymyn got it, Susan Sarandan's 
got.

But what is "it?" Certainly not...

 Neutrogena, a big bummer.
 Playtex, show them a 14 year old
 girl wearing almost nothing, then
 show them a baby in a diaper, they'll
 drool and buy stuff, and won't even
 know why, you'll see.
 Claritin, use only if you're not
 allergic to cocaine, marijuana, lsd
 or hydrochloric acid. Ask your doctor
 if you are pregnant, underweight, or
 sensitive to light. Most common side
 effects are gear ratio, trugreen chem
 lawn, chills, anal leakage and porn.

ok

 You know, I can't stand Patsy Cline,
 am I alone in this? She's like a Mary
 Ford wannabe. Why is she ahead of
 Debbie Harry? Often I forget this is a  
 popularity contest, not an indication
 of talent, eh?

 Carol King can move my earth anyday.
 She sings her own songs. Now that's
 class. It's pretty clear Cheryl Crow
 wants to be Carole King, huh? Alanis
 too. Can you say photocopy with some
 of the toner used up? Oh, Ronnie
 Spector, I knew I should've lifted
 that barf bag from Midwest Express.

 I wonder what would have happened if
 Alan Freed and Ronnie Spector got married. 
 It wouldn't be Bill Gates we'd be going 
 after right now, would it???

Annie Lennox. No offense. Very talented
but boring me to tears. She's REM, U2 and 
Flock of Seagulls all mooshed up into a 
sausage grinder and fed to me in pizza
dough, really.

Ummm, since when is Henry Rollins some
expert on female musicians? Go back
to your Dodge Ram truck ads, buster.

Chrissie Hynde, now there's about the
3rd best woman musical artist alive.
You're all close on callin her 7.

Billie Holliday. OK. I'll give her
a little credit, but again. Where's
Nina Simone? Where's Odetta? Billie's
pretty good. I'll give her that.
A good victim of her time. He beats
me, but Henry Rollins buys me drinks
now and then. And Tony Bennet? He lets
me tickle his toupe. No David Letterman 
he.

OK, is anyone even doubting who 1-5 are 
going to be? If they weren't listed as 
Diva 98, 99 AND 2000 they're not gonna 
be in this numba are they?

Ready for payola central? Word up.

Sprint, bullshit so thick you can hear a 
pin slurp. Like quicksand for your paycheck.
 
Joni Mitchell, awesome, and talented but 
unlike John Cougar Mellenhead, I'm actually 
going to be mean. She's no Joan Baez. And 
don't get me wrong, Baez is kind of a jerk, 
but give her driven, give her visionary, give 
her talented, Baez has a little something that 
Joni Mitchell has well, just a whole lot less 
of. 

And if I have to hear Janis Joplin's most
embarrassing moment of her entire life
one more time I'm going to barf. Listen
her best rendition of her best song of 
her best decade is simply NOT summertime. 
Get it in your head. Listen to anyone else 
in this world sing summertime. And listen 
to Joplin sing absolutely any song other
than Summertime. She ain't no porgy and she
ain't no bess, but she can sing a hell of a 
lot better than the song we remember her for 
tells. Janis Joplin was a storyteller. Janis 
was a crooner. Janis had soul. Please listen 
to anything else she sang. In fact, even if 
you have to hear Mercedez Benz, her second 
worst song. It'll at least give you an idea 
of what the lady could do. Let me tell you 
right now, Big Brother and the Holding Company
represents everything this country should have 
become, and without all the kings horses and 
all the kings men, Joplin would have been the 
first lady of soul. Yupper. Elvis, Jimi and 
Janis, but I'm not talkin bout what you're 
talking about. 

Body by Victor. Nice psychadelic music next to 
naked women, VS! All you will see is curves, 
and all we will see is dollar signs. Your dollar 
signs.

Aretha Franklin I just never could get into. Of 
course my dad thought the Beatles were just a bunch 
of hop heads. So what did I miss? Queen of Soul, ok. 
OK. But number one female vocalist of all time? 
Hmmmm. Let me get back to you on... no I'm sure of
it. She's good.... she's great, but she's just not 
"all that." I could have put 25 different people 
here in #1. Who do we owe favors to? Once again. 
Where's Jess Klein? Ani Defranco, Dar Williams,
where's Stevie Nicks. 

And what did Nina Simone or Odetta ever do to you?








we end this zine with some of Cynthia McKinney's words.

Ever since I came to Congress in 1992, there are those 
who have been trying to silence my voice. I've been told 
to "sit down and shut up" over and over again. Well, I 
won't sit down and I won't shut up until the full and 
unvarnished truth is placed before the American people.

Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney (D) 
represents Georgia's 4th District.
