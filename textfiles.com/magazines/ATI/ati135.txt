Greetings, and welcome to ATI, Active Televised Ignorance.
Issue 135. The Honorable Judge Frank Mention presiding.
It is currently July 5, 1998. 2am. I'm Prime Anarchist
and this is "the shit."
   First a Parody; and then my column. Then you get lots and lots of
K-rad submissions.

So much life to be lived.
So much to be tried.
And when you share it you get
A special feeling inside.

It's a full time thing
The kind of life that you lead
A little break from it all
Is the break that you need.

You deserve a break today.
So get up and get away.
>From McDonalds.
Eat something else instead.

                  >LETTUCE FROM OUR REEDUHS<


Dear Marco:

Got my copy in the mail.  
Thanks so much for making me a part of ATI.

From: cipher <cipher@mindspring.com>
To: ati@intst.com

You're just crawling along, looking for home. Or cover.
And something big and fast and dangerous whips by on it's patrol.
And you freeze and become the dirt.
And pray it didn't notice.
But it did.  You hear as it turns for you.  It don't miss much.
And the freeze grabs your guts and the crazy seizes your head.

More animal than human now, you scramble.
And for a few moments you seem to be good at the evasion.
Deeper in you go.
Hope springs, good enough to survive?, you wonder.
And you curse yourself for allowing that indulgence,
Relentless has your scent again.  And it's minions.

You have no choice now.
Time to go into the Deep Deep.
Cold and dark, lifeless Deep Deep.
You're at the edge of it now, you hear and feel 
your pursuers closing. But they've lost your trail, 
they patrol wide and fast. They're beating the bush, 
waiting for your mad bolt into the flight of death.

But you hold.
Perhaps they'll sweep too wide.
New prey may catch their attention.
You put one foot in, ready to turn and plunge if neccessary.

And after a century, they're gone.
You've eluded them.  For now.
And so you extract that portion of yourself from the Deep Deep.

Knowing you'll never be warm again.

Cipher               



    REVOLUTION IS JUST AN ALBUM AWAY: When You're Waiting
    For A Home-Made T-Shirt.
         a letter-to-the-editor by lutenman.

Dear ATI,
   Billy Bragg is in the studio as we speak working with all of Woodie
Guthrie's archives. Expected publication date is August. Woodie's daughter
says it's going to be really rockin, but true to Woodie's raw style.
   Also, do you know the address of the microbrew that silkscreens the
organic cotton T-shirts to promote their beer "anarchy ale: no government
can give you freedom or good beer?"
   Lutenman. San Antonio

THIS IN FROM GEORGE. (area code (???))
Yes they let me near a computer again. <Evil Grin>
First off:

  www.interactive.net/~bridget (Black Helicopters No Less!)
  www.kevinmitnick.com (Over 3 years without a trial!)
  
And now.....

It has been said that we are living in the End Times and that
the world as we know it will end. What with the Y2K problems
and traffic problems, pollution problems, weather problems,
mental problems or whatever people seem to be suffering from
these days, sometimes one has to sit back and laugh.
I've heard of people coming back to the Church and trying to
find Jesus and the Lord but this is going a little too far....
On that note, I leave you with the following:

File under the headings of:
    "Snafus Fuckups and sheer idiocy."
 or "People on crack shouldn't use a computer"
 or "I can't believe I missed that..."

American Family Publishers found God in Sumpter County Florida.
And He may be very very rich.
A sweepstakes notice arrived at the Bushnell Assembly of God
announcing God of Bushnell Florida was a finalist for the
$11 million top prize.
"I always thought he lived here but didn't actually know"
said Bill Brack, pastor of the church, about 60 miles north of
Tampa. "Now I do. He's got a PO Box here.

God, we've been searching for you. American Family wrote in the
letter first reported by the local newspaper the Sumpter County 
Times. The message was centered between 2 gold seals requesting
God to "come forward." If God were to win, What an incredible
future there would be for God! Could you imagine the looks you'd
get from your neighbors? But don't just sit there God!
Sweepstakes officials did not return several phone calls for comment
Thursday. Brack said a youth pastor for the church collected the
mail that day and pointed out the addressee.
"I read it in church a couple of weeks ago and everyone got a kick
out of it." he said. "It is funny, everyone seemed to enjoy it.
It lifted everyone's heart.
Brack said his 140 person congregation is considering mailing in the
entry. The church could use the money. If they win, Brack said he'd
settle with American Family for 10% on the dollar and call it even.
"I'm willing to for them to show up here at the church with cameras
and me in my bathrobe as long as they write a check" he quipped.
And if American Family chooses another winner?
"God would be very disappointed" Brack joked.
Until next time.....
Your friend and mine....

WHEN YOU SAY "MANUEL NORIEGA" INTO A RECORDER AND THEN PLAY IT BACK
BACKWARDS IT SAYS "I'D GET YOUR OWN LAWYER WE NEED."
This came in the mail this week to ati@etext.org:
Reverse Speech(TM) is an exciting new discovery with virtually unlimited
application for improving professional and personal life. Reverse Speech
is the underlying subconscious verbal expression behind spoken language.
Through its documentation and analysis, one can extrude covert factual
data as well as grasping concepts from the foundations of personality
and behavior. This provides an unprecedented capacity to achieve rapid,
penetrating insight into the actions, character and motivation of any
individual.

A Reverse Speech investigation involves the analysis of audio recordings
played backwards. Rigorous checkpoints are applied to determine the
validity of statements that appear in reverse. Valid speech reversals
are considered expressions of the conscious or unconscious mind of the
speaker. They are a reliable indication of that individual’s true
feelings and their understanding of the issue being discussed in
forwards speech.

The following transcript is the result of a Reverse Speech investigation
into the statements of Iraqi UN Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon.

Summary: Prohibited weapons exist in the Persian Gulf. Iraq possesses
the will to fight a destructive war. They are playing a game of strategy
with the UN and may be outwitting them. Iraq is not being honest in
revealing their VX capacity. They possess VX and/or other prohibited
weapons.

Square brackets [] indicate the location in forwards speech where a
reversal was discovered.

The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer Transcript 062498
-----------------------------------------------
U.N. weapons inspectors found evidence that Iraq armed some of its
missile warheads with the deadly nerve agent VX. Following a discussion
with the chief U.N. weapons inspector, Ambassador Richard Butler, Iraqi
U.N. Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon responds to the United Nation's Special
Commission's findings.

Iraq's VX supply
-----------------

MARGARET WARNER: And what happened to the VX that Iraq possessed at the
end of the war?

AMBASSADOR HAMDOON: I think the bulk of it was destroyed unilaterally
when Iraq decided to give up all its material that has to be-would be
prohibited items under the council's resolution.

MARGARET WARNER: And when you say the bulk of it, what happened to the
rest of it?

AMBASSADOR HAMDOON:
1) [Whatever that was delivered] to the UNSCOM.
REVERSE: There's germs in the gulf. Have a battle.

MARGARET WARNER: Now, you heard Amb. Butler say that Iraq has-I think a
phrased he used was never told the truth about the VX program and that
your country continually revised its declarations as additional evidence
came out. What is your response to that?
AMBASSADOR HAMDOON:
2) Well, we revised our declaration not only on this weapon [but also on
the other] stuff many times because the UNSCOM has always come back to
us requesting some new form, some additional stuff here and there.
REVERSE: With a mass slaughter.

The problem with the lab's findings
------------------------------------
MARGARET WARNER: Now, you heard Amb. Butler say, when I asked him what
he wanted from Iraq now, he said he wants more details and verifiable
details on the nature and extent of the VX program. Do you foresee a
problem confined with that? What is your position on that?
AMBASSADOR HAMDOON: We have promised that whatever we had, whatever we
could get, because we told him that everything that was in our capacity
we provided to them.
3) [But if there anything else that] we could do in the next few weeks
under . . .
REVERSE: Says lie. Internet. Played with them.
4) . . . the program of action that has [been agreed upon in Baghdad],
REVERSE: Baghdad know. Believe the names.
5) . . . we simp[ly would be doing that]. And he has just admitted that
Baghdad is continuing its cooperation in a satisfactory way.
REVERSE: They already blew it.

MARGARET WARNER: And now your government issued this statement from
Baghdad, saying it would reconsider its relationship with the inspectors
if sanctions weren't lifted immediately. Can you explain that? What do
you mean by that?
AMBASSADOR HAMDOON:
6)  Well, Iraq was trying hard, I mean, to [clear all the files by this
year, by the end of this year]. And if it doesn't look at any point that
the sanctions will be lifted, Iraq will be reconsidering its policy.
REVERSE: They're gonna go with grace. Saddam play. He grabs the
victories.

MARGARET WARNER: All right. Now, Mr. Ambassador, just so I'm absolutely
clear here, are you saying that Iraq now possesses absolutely no VX?
AMBASSADOR HAMDOON:
7) [We possess absolutely no V]X, nor any other prohibited weapon.
REVERSE: This fax says a few.

ALL EASTERN CONN. TOLL FREE
(PAWN) - Moosup, CT. Due to a computer glitch, all long distance calls
to the 860 area code (Connecticut's newest) have not been showing on
bills during the last two pay periods.
   "I guess the machine can't tell 8-0, 8-8, and 8-6 apart," said Justin
O'Plebian, a SNOTCO spokesman.
   He said calls to the new dedicated child porn area code, 876 have not
been affected -- calls are still $39 a minute. SNOTCO officials say they
will have the fix implemented within 6 months.
   "Until then," said O'Plebian, "calls to eastern CT. are the same price
as watching a good sunset."

ATI/UNABOMBER BOOKDEAL FALLS THROUGH.
(PAWN) - Pueblo, CO. - a publishing deal between Thad Kazinskin and 
Prime Anarchist Productions was discussed over Supermax burgers but the
deal did not go thru, according to both parties. 
   It turned sour when Prime Anarchist told the Mad Bomber, "Sure Thad,
I'll publish your life story, uncut, word for word, if you can get it to
me via ascii email under 10K."
   Kazinskin punched him in the mouth and insisted he was worth way more
than 15 minutes fame.
   "No one is worth more than 10K," said Anarchist. "Not even me."

BET YOU DIDN'T KNOW P.A. INVENTED BARBICIDE.
(PAWN) - Rat Poison, NH - In 1957 Prime Anarchist invented Barbicide
Hairtonic; a lotion that salons still use to comb out that ugly obsession
little girls get around age 5 to primp, preen, touch and tickle their 
hair constantly. Main ingredients are cayenne pepper, olean, pickle
juice and flax seed oil.
   Perfectly safe for childrens' scalps; but all dolls in the house will
begin losing limbs.
   Heinz was the only corporation marketing Barbicide at first, but thanks
to a 1997 alliance between Sobe of Norwalk, CT and Proctor and Gamble
of Everywhere-Like-Flies, TX., there is a new body lotion that the 
Kristian Koalition will be using to keep their children from touching   
themselves. 
   Same ingredients, this will be called GOP.(tm)


                       
OFF TO CLINTON: ENOUGH ABOUT RIGHTS
(PAWN) - TinyMan Square. Juan B. Mulder. Special to Prime Anarchist 
World News Tonite. 
   Chinese Chairman Xon Xoff said his citizens are no longer born with 
rights, "please don't make us jealous with your talk of tonsils, appendixes
OR rights."
   Off informed Billiam Clinton that US citizens are born with many things
the Chinese lack; including television sets.
   "Rather than being jealous," said Off, who prefers to be called Xon,
but our stylebook requires us to refer to him as Off, he would rather our
citizens focus on the things "we do have." He listed bicycles, Taco Bell,
and Windows 98 free. 
   "And one year ahead of you."
