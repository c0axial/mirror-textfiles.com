AIN'T IT THE SHORTEST PRIME ANARCHIST 
WEEKLY COLUMN YOU EVER DID SEE?

If you predict anything about Cuomo running for 
Governor, it should be that he will do NOTHING
in this time that might harm his chances of a
credible run for POTUS (president of the US) A
S A P.
  I predicted "cabinet to governor to potus" the
day he married a Kennedy.

Greetings! Get out of bed, wakeup. School's out,
but there's still stuff to do. Two extra hours of
sleep is all you get.

I'm prime anarchist and this is the zine of the 
week. ATI, Activist Time to Invigorate.

Please consider the following original poem

Life's Clock

Life's clock is wound but once
and no man hath the power
to know where the hands
will stop
at late or early hour.
To lose one's wealth is  sad, indeed.
To lose one's health is more.
To lose one's soul is such a loss,
that no man can restore.
Today, only is our own.
So live, love and toil with a will.
Place no faith in tommorrow,
for the clock may soon be still.

  Darlene Virginia Quarles


To Marco:

The three most powerful people in the USA now, 
are named:
  Bush, Dick and Colon.

Hey Prime,
      In honor of the mayhem still ongoing from
sElection2000 I think the pen company in your
homestate. Was it Parker? They're the ones that
did UNTIED STATES SENATE during the impeachment
trials. They went out of business when they lost
the government subcontract, right? 
      Well they should be given restart incentive
cash to bid on pens that really WILL say UNTIED
STATES SENATE.

AND NOW, A POEM: Reprinted from 
Map.   Map of Austion Poetry 
by Jeanne Spicuzza 
(copyright (1999 for this one) 
remains with the author of course)

What is the sound of one hand clapping? 
- Zen Koan 

It defies all reason 
one hand clapping 

the sound of 
a Nazi salute 
(Hitler wasn't the only monster 
to tarnish our history) 

the sound of 
hate 
realizing our fate 
a father losing his son 
a melody done 
a child huddled in fear 
a mother screaming 
in anguish, 
her baby's face 
blown off 

there is no destruction of the enemy 
only destruction of ourselves 

the echo of a race 
the sound of 
once was 
peeling skin color 
religion 
and differences 
drifting away 
out of body 
what is left? 

only one 

the sound of 
death 
a person 
alone 

the sound of 
terror 
the sound of 
injustice 
greed and pride 

it is silence 

one hand clapping 
defies all reason 

the other, 
a clenched fist 
and closed heart 
turning its back 
on humanity.

Which party do *you* belong to?
  A prose-poem
by
  by Aaron Schlosser
  [reprinted from Indymedia Dot Org because of
   how many laughs it got, and especially its
   high humor.]

It was not until I gave this particular post a subject that I was 
eerily reminded of The Party in George Orwell's famous and spine-
tingling book, "1984". But I digress. 
  "I've just joined a wonderful new political party that has been 
around for the past 150 or so years, but has remained almost entirely 
unnoticed by the majority of the American people. I am utterly 
astounded that this political party has been around for so long 
and its agenda has been unknown. 
  The reason this party has been around for such a long time without 
fading away is because it is backed by quite a few of the world's 
most prominent activists, and has been for the past century-and-a-
half. The thing I find most peculiar, however, is that these prominent 
people are very well-known, yet most American people have absolutely 
no idea that they support my party. Without them, my party would never 
be able to campaign in the ferocity that it does, nor would it be able 
to survive. 
  The surprising thing about my party is that it has been a major 
player in the American political scene for every presidency since 
as far back as Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln. Since then, it
has had a key role in the development of the modern political system. 
This astonishes me as few people even know that it exists. 
  I vote for my party every chance I get, because the other party is 
bad. 
  I am a Democratic-Republican. 
  I am for and against the death penalty. I am for and against abortion. 
I am an environmentalist that favours the destruction of the world's most 
valuable ecological resources. I want to raise and lower taxes. I want to 
spend more of less on the military. I am a strong advocate for gay rights 
but I do not believe that gays should have rights. I fight against 
corporations who use sweatshop labour and I wear Nike shoes. I like 
Adidas pants. All my clothes are from Abercrombie & Fitch, those elitist, 
corporate bastards. I am an anti-fascist that votes for my party every 
chance I get. I am the member of a worker's union and I want to expand 
trade to China. 
  I am a Democratic-Republican. 
  I know that the other party is bad because the leader of my party said 
so. I don't need to make my own choices, my own decisions; I elect people 
to make them for me. I have a moral obligation to act immorally. 
  I drive to work every day in my SUV that gets 16 miles to the gallon, 
and I want people do something about global warming. More people should 
use public transportation so that I can drive to work in less traffic. 
I don't have time to think about things, I just vote for my party because 
they care about me and have my best interests in mind. The other party 
wants to destroy everything that I hold dear. Those bastards. They're 
probably Communists, those Nazi bastards. 
  I don't bother to learn much about the government or politics, because 
it makes me feel helpless. I just watch the news at night, even though 
the news is heavily subjective in favour of the other party. Radicals 
are really pesky and annoying. Idealists. Who needs them? God forbid 
anyone should think of anything better. Things are as good as they
could possibly be. 
  Cynicism is bad. Only kooks and loons are cynics. I'm cynical of 
cynics. I've got to be skeptical, because they're always playing dirty 
tricks on me. They're out to get me, you know, those cynical, paranoid, 
Communist, Nazis. 
  I feel secure. I'm a Democratic-Republican. 
  Those radicals are so unrealistic. Welcome to the real world, you idiot! 
The real world is where I buy my Nike shoes and pretend they weren't made 
by little Hun Lee, a fifteen year old Chinese girl that works twelve hours 
a day. That is realistic, you silly extremist. 
  There's nothing I can do about it. It's unstoppable. I make it unstoppable." 
  The above writing is intended to be thought-provoking, although it may just 
seem like babbling gibberish. Take a closer look at it. You might not need to 
look very far. 
  This post is intended to be something to look at and think about. Have fun 
with it. 




A "WHAT IF" By Marc Frucht.
  What If You Read "A Letter To Santa but
hadn't had a ton of prior programming, so
you had no idea what the heck all the 
"ikonnery" and pictographs (yeah, those 
too) meant.

  Dear Bearded White Guy
  I hope everybody at the GIANT CANDYCANE is well
and the SLED and the YAK is ready for christmas eve.
My WOMAN says that I am a good SMILY KID. If you have
CLOCKS to visit my SNOWMAN IN THE YARD I'd like a LITTLE
GIRL and my brother would like a RIDE. Our MISMATCHED SOCKS 
will be hung by the FIREPLACE. Please bring THE WOMAN a new 
IRON and my MAN would like a new red LAB COAT. In case you 
are hungry when you come to my house I will put A PLAIN
DONUT and A HUGE CARTON OF MILK on the EDGE OF THE TABLE 
READY TO FALL IF YOU TOUCH IT... Please give my best to 
the BEARDED WHITE LADY and all the KEEBLER FACTORY helpers.
  You can find my MODEL OF A HOUSE because we have a MELTING
LUMP OF SNOW on the front lawn.
  Merry Christmas from a good child.






We end with a concept as a metaphor: Because 
as always, poetry's "gonna carry us through."

As the movement grows, and as the status quo worsens,
the line between hackers and activists is erased.
