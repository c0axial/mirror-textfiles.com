"My mind raced as I took it all in. I had the clear sense
that this was a personal battle, that all these machinations
were directed by one man against another: George Bush had
unleashed the power of the world's greatest military force,
with one overriding target -- me."
 -Manuel Noriega about the day the US Gov't sent out Bush's
orders for: "Evasion and escape: authorized to kill M.A.N."

November 2, 2001 - The FBI contacted volunteers from the 
Independent Media Center (indymedia) in San Francisco today. 
Agent Chuck Esposito, from the Oakland FBI office, telephoned 
"Espe," a volunteer who has worked with the San Francisco 
Indymedia collective. Agent Esposito asked Espe if he had 
access to server logs, if he administered "indymedia sites," 
and if he had access to the server. Espe only replied that 
he could not answer questions without the presence of an 
attorney. Agent Esposito asked Espe if he knew what the call 
was about or if anyone else had contacted him. Espe said, 
  "No, care to fill me in?" 
  Agent Esposito replied, "not until I'm ready." Agent Esposito 
also mentioned something about "terrorist threats," but Espe 
could not recall the exact context.
  Other IMC volunteers immediately called the Electronic Frontier 
Foundation, who helped Indymedia when Seattle IMC was served with 
an order by the FBI in April. According to information obtained by 
an EFF representative, Agent Esposito was given indymedia contact 
information by the Seattle FBI office, and was instructed to follow 
up on a lead they had received. The lead involved some kind of 
"anthrax threat." Agent Esposito indicated that the FBI is interested 
in reviewing Indymedia server logs. Agent Esposito also indicated that, 
to his knowledge, the "threat" appeared on the Arizona IMC website.
  Following the FBI order in April, the Indymedia tech collective 
decided to stop recording IP addresses of website visitors. The IP 
address is the "key" to identifying website visitors. Without IP 
addresses, most Indymedia web traffic is anonymous. However, this is 
not absolute protection. Use of internet spying and devices like 
Carnivore allow the FBI to obtain this information without going 
through Indymedia. 
  Website users who wish to remain anonymous should utilize "anonymous 
web proxies." These are websites which allow you to surf other websites, 
while protecting your identity. Not all anonymizer services are safe. 
For instance, SafeWeb.com, based in Oakland, is largely funded by the 
CIA. 
  Currently, many people are relying on the anonymizer offered by the 
European Counter Network, at https://proxy1.autistici.org



A very short #'s run and not too much LETTUCE in our harried hurry to get
this out to you.

Please forward as you feel appropriate,

this is just a short note to let you know that I will
be leaving today on another 'round-the-world trip, and 
will be away from the office for several weeks.  We 
cannot guarantee regular access to the Net in some countries, 
so keep checking our web site http://www.truthinmedia.org for 
any updates in the meantime.  We will post the updates to the 
web site before e-mailing them to the TiM list, if at all.

Hi there! 
We run http://www.gatt.org/. Here's what the WTO--that's the
World Trade Organization, of course--has been saying about us 
on their front page at http://www.wto.org/: 

"Warning: Fake WTO website - http://www.gatt.org - deceitful
and a nuisance to serious users" They go on to describe how 
gatt.org interferes with "serious users" looking for "genuine 
information"
(http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news01_e/gattdotorg_e.htm): 

We think the WTO is acting just a little bit paranoid, don't you?
After all, this is less than TEN DAYS before the start of the WTO's
big hooplah in Doha, Qatar. 

Maybe they're nervous--in Qatar, any form of protest is strictly
illegal, and VERY heavily punishable (depending on the King's mood).
How will people react when the first hundred protesters get their
heads chopped clean off? Morocco doesn't like that sort of extremism,
and neither do France or Nepal. 

Lots of beheaded peaceniks is likely to annoy almost everyone! 

Funny thing, the WTO acted this way just before Seattle as well:
http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/pres99_e/pr151_e.htm . 

It probably is just a bad case of nerves. See you on the chopping block!

For Immediate Release 
November 1, 2001 

Media contact: sassyriot@netscape.net 

Protestors to Challenge Suppression of Free Press 
CNN- Half the News All the Time 

ATLANTA, GEORGIA -- The 4910 Collective and an ad hoc alliance of local 
groups and concerned individuals, has scheduled a march and rally to 
condemn the lack of fair and representative media coverage of the US 
response to the September 11th attacks and the US war against the Taliban. 
Scheduled for Saturday, November 10th, the march will begin at 12:00pm at 
Woodruff Park. The march will proceed to the CNN Building where it will 
culminate into a rally featuring street theatre, speakers, music, and 
puppets. 

The 4910 Collective et al. are targeting CNN because free press is 
essential to the functioning of democracy. When the media allows itself 
to be controlled both by complicity with the government and directly by 
corporate interests, it silences the debate necessary to create an aware 
and informed public. Furthermore, we denounce our government's continuing 
efforts to erode our Constitutional rights and civil liberties all in the 
name of protecting freedom. We not only call for opposition to the war, 
but also for solidarity with Arab and Muslim communities and strongly 
object to violence, verbal or otherwise, against the members of these 
communities and the Anti-war supporters.

Armed government agents grabbed Nancy Oden, Green Party USA coordinating 
committee member, Thursday at Bangor International Airport in Bangor Maine, 
as she attempted to board an American Airlines flight to Chicago. 

  "An official told me that my name had been flagged in the computer," a 
shaken Oden said. "I was targeted because the Green Party USA opposes the 
bombing of innocent civilians in Afghanistan." 

  Oden, a long-time organic farmer and peace activist in northern Maine, 
was ordered away from the plane. Military personnel with automatic weapons 
surrounded Oden and instructed all airlines to deny her passage on ANY flight. 
"I was told that the airport was closed to me until further notice and that 
my ticket would not be refunded," Oden said. 

  Oden is scheduled to speak in Chicago Friday night on a panel concerning 
pesticides as weapons of war. She had helped to coordinate the Green Party 
USA's antiwar efforts these past few months, and was to report on these to 
The Greens national committee. "Not only did they stop me at the airport but 
some mysterious party had called the hotel and cancelled my reservation," 
Oden said. 

  The Greens National Committee -- the governing body of the Green Party USA -- 
is meeting in Chicago Nov. 2-4 to hammer out the details of national campaigns 
against bio-chemical warfare, the spraying of toxic pesticides, genetic 
engineering, and the Party's involvement in the burgeoning peace movement. 

  "I am shocked that US military prevented one of our prominent Green Party 
members from attending the meeting in Chicago," said Elizabeth Fattah, a 
GPUSA representative from Pennsylvania who drove to Chicago. "I am outraged 
at the way the Bill of Rights is being trampled upon." 

  Chicago Green activist Lionel Trepanier concluded, "The attack on the right 
of association of an opposition political party is chilling. The harassment 
of peace activists is reprehensible." 

  For further information, please call 1-866-GREENS-2 (toll-free) 

  The GREEN PARTY USA will hold press conference in CHICAGO SATURDAY, 
NOV. 3 to discuss this matter. 10 a.m. at the J. Ira and Nicki Family 
Hostel 24 East Congress Parkway (at Wabash), 2nd floor"
