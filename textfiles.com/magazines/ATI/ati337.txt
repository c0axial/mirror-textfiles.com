& IN PRIME ANARCHIST WORLD NEWS 2NITE:
--------------------------------------

NAZI SS GUARD AND CIA AGENT DIE IN SECRET SUICIDE PACT.

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (PAWN) Theodore "Ted" Shackley,
75, the youngster in the duo, killed his boyfriend
Anton Malloth, 90; but not before letting his victim
kill him too.
  The two both pointed their machine guns monday, each
at the others' private parts just as they'd agreed
decades ago. They counted back from ten in German
and right after 3,2,1, both closed their eyes, and
pulled the triggers on fully automatic.
  Wow. What a mess.
  Shackley, known as "The Blond Ghost" joined the CIA
in its earliest days, 1951. Malloth, a former Nazi SS
guard was sentenced last year to life in prison for
beating a jewish concentration camp inmate to death
in 1944. He'd already been convicted of killing a 
prisoner for hidden cauliflower in her jacket and 
her Reebok pump sneakers.
  Shackley and Malloth tried killing Fidel Castro
twenty years ago and vowed to keep trying once a
year for two decades. If they failed the 20th time,
they agreed they would kill each other. 
  Monday's infamous double murder, suicide, homicide
was listed as the first and only successful joint
mission the CIA and SS ever conducted in human history.



CARDINAL LAW AND DOCTOR KISSINGER SEEN LEAVING TOGETHER.

PAWN - (Vatican City) Henry left first, and then came 
Bernard holding out an open hand like a lady-in-wait 
before hopping on the double-wide escalator.
  Flashbulbs galore burst as a glib Kissinger reached back
an extended arm for Law to grab and the two descended the
escalator walking hand in hand for most of the rest of 
their day. The pair was seen leaving dozens of different
places while they continued on their all-exenses-paid
end-of-career shopping sprees throughout Italy, France,
England and Wales.
  They will settle tomorrow in beautiful Marion County
feeding each other grapes and boiled cauliflour roll-ups
in a condo of their own choosing. The two will summer
at the Broadmoore Estates in Colorado Springs.
  Officiating at the ceremony was of course none other
than Pope John "Wayne" Paul himself. He gave them his
blessing and they're now starting their new life
together.
  Kissinger leaves behind plantations, factories, and
unfinished phase-two time-share apartments all over
the continental United States, while Law leaves behind
just a whole lot of power, authority and young slaves.
Kissinger will keep his blood-sausage-making-facilities
which had made him his first millions, so he can easily
assure himself and the little-vicar a healthy retirement. 
The only thing Law was interested in keeping was a spiffy 
red and white singaporian hand-made festival hat.

OK, After all these fantastical fake stories,

here's a real one that'll simply blow your mind.

Berkley mayor Tom Bates will plead guilty to 
trashing newspapers.
  When the UC Berkley paper printed an endorsement
of the mayor's opponent, he was witnessed by three
unique people removing papers, (is it still called
the Berkley Barb? Or was that a different pape?) 
and throwing them into a trash can on Sproul Plaza,
which is very ironic because it's famous for being
what people called the birthplace of the 1964 Free
Speech Movement.
  Bates apologized at the next City Council meeting
and announced he'll plead guilty and pay a $250 fine.

Middle High German, Or WWRD?: What Would Reagan Do?

Have you ever had someone ask you where you stand
on assassination? 
  Have you ever looked deep into their eyes? Could
you even find their eyes? I've been asked this five
times I remember, and I'm thinking I better discuss
this as a phenomenon rather than avoiding it more.
  OK, I've been running homeless shelters since the
early 90s now, and it seems to show up mostly at
these kinds of places. Only once did I hear it from
a fellow shelter provider, the other four were
people right there in the belly of abject poverty.
  This is where this type of sentiment festers,
boils and takes root. Fanatical religious groups 
seem to recruit heavily around here and the poor 
are so vulnerable, they're ripe for this kind of 
abuse. It's one thing for a clergy to say something 
like "Jesus says you must be firm," it's entirely 
something else when someone stands there surrounded 
by a black and brown aura so thick you can't get near
them, oozing out with violence and aggression, saying 
"don't you believe in assassination?" or "this nation's 
biggest problem is when it went away from allowing 
for assassination."
  Woah!
  What do you say to that?? "I love you," didn't
work, nor did "I feel sorry for you." Logic won't
get you anywhere I guess. And my one time trying
silence felt icky because in a case like this I'm
fearful it was seen as agreement or affirmation.
  Yuck. 
  I just don't know how to respond. Each time I 
think I left behind a feeling of shock from even
knowing there's more than a tiny handful of anti-
social psychopaths acting semi-functional out there 
who feel that way. Unfortunately I must point out
that this energy spreads way to fast - especially
in a time of war (or whatever you must call 13 years 
of military organized genocide).
  Dozens of "terrorists" are now on the CIA's
"kill-if-you-need-to" list. What is this list
anyhow? Where did it come from? Aside from brand
new leaks, it's about as illusory as the domestic
"No-Fly List." Apparently the Anti-Social-Psycopath-
In-Chief himself, but no one will confirm this
beyond the usual Woodward/Bernstein non-commital
commitals.
  You know, "do you still beat your children..."
"no comment..." - you tell your boss he said yes...
  "What list?" "if there is a list we only use it
as last resort... Oh... don't quote me. There is
no list."
  An old executive order still bans assassinations,
and of course Bush keeps trying like hell to get 
"his" congress to overturn it. They went for a lot
of dark dreary things but even a congressionally
complicitous war criminal (if he's not quite a
full-on psycopath himself) won't agree to something
like this, so they voted him down again.
  Bush is not allowed to assassinate ANYONE. The
language is rather clear. But how does he react?
Probably chants the daily mantra: WWRD - What Would 
Reagan Do.
  Bush has provided written legal authority to the
CIA to hunt down and kill the "terrorists" when and
where (and how) they want.
  Jeff Smith, a former general counsel for the CIA
and now just a DC lawyer, said it is important for
the US to keep the assassination ban intact. "The
ban is good policy, and we don't want to create a
situation where assassination becomes an accepted
form of behavior."
  My only question after a truth like that is, but 
will we allow for the regular use of it as an accepted 
form of unaccepted behavior? Did that come out right? 
I think you know what I mean. 
  I'll end this suggesting you look up the etymologies
of two words. 
  Terrorist and Assassin.
  You may want to brush up on origins of the word
Putsch also.

AND IN MKE SPORTS:

Tim Thomas and Ray Allen had great game bringing 
to a 101-79 win over the Portland Trailblazers.
  Portland's Scotty Pippin played really well but 
the Trailblazers seemed a bit off overall. Maybe 
too much hanging around in the Hyatt or carousing
around town before the game. 
  It was not easy to root for my newest hometeam 
this game for two reasons. 
  
1) from Connecticut.
2) REALLY LIKE OPONENT'S COLOR SCHEME!!!

  I landed these tickets late enough to have no 
chance to check with more sports-competent 
friends. Not sure how a Bucks win or loss might 
affect any Celtics outcomes. Red and black is the 
shit, man. I'm telling you. As a youth, I played 
for both soccer teams and baseball companies that 
had red and black "anthems." And besides I just 
plain dig everything red & black stands for. That's 
why my favorite bird in the world is the little
old vulture they call the redwinged blackbird.
  But I digress. I watched Tim Thomas grab two 
three-point plays in a row, and a normal basket 
right after that. Some playing! He had game with 
5 threepointers total, among 25 points and under 
the boards he got himself seven rebounds. Cassell 
did almost as well as Thomas getting himself 19 
points and 10 assists.
  I'll be honest, I'm rooting for the hometeam 
for one reason since my other indicators were 
absent. Ray Allen's my boy, being from UCONN
territory and all.
  This game wasn't a blowout by any stretch. 
The only huge bursts came in the 3rd and 4th
quarters, making for some exciting b-ball.
  So here's some misc. from the recesses of
my brain throughout the game. Who played sax 
at the beginning of the show? That's the first 
National Anthem I've heard in about 11 years I 
didn't find downright boring. It was quite a 
rendition. And the ending was outragious. Twice 
he commanded incredible applause, and never once 
did he bust into those stupid Kenny G stylistic 
triplets that every intermediate level player 
falls into often.
  Who's smoking dope? I smelled some serious
marijuana out there! Seemed to be coming from 
the VIP section. Hmmm. So at 9-9 early on they 
played the Car Wash theme. Quite popular around
here for some reason. My partner says she wishes 
they'd play more than just the snippet though. 
She and I really wanted to show off that not 
only are we old enough to remember the whole 
tune, but good enough to sing it out.
  So you knew the Bucks were going to win when
Portland called the first time-out at 16-9. 
They play a good game of catch-up from that 
moment on. 
  Jose Feliciano's Feliz Navidad plays while 
TV-Landia gets to watch couples all over the 
bleachers get mistletoed. 
  So what member of what team had their 
birthday February 26th? I missed the
answer. Wasn't paying attention really
because I was so bothered and turned off 
by the whole "Verizon sponsors 'Meet The 
Bucks,'" thing.
  At 22-19 Bonzi gets net -- makes me think
Portland has a chance. Here comes that Carwash
theme again. 
  The Bucks cheerleaders make their first
appearance to Jimi Hendrix' "Let Me Stand Next
To Your Fire." Never mind that I know a couple
of them, I have to say that not only are they
much better looking than the Dallas Cowboys
Cheerleaders used to look when I was a teenager,
but they seem to be a heck of a lot more savvy
and intelligent. Something tells me that Cheer
in general is nowhere near as ditzy-dinghy a
field as it used to be when I was coming up. 
  Maybe it's me, call me old-fashioned, but 
when the hometeam makes noise during a free-
throw I get not just annoyed but deeply offended.
Why? That's just rude. Over the top, man. When
I played b-ball (and don't get me wrong. It was
my least accomplished sport behind soccer and
baseball) we were completely disallowed from 
making noise during a freethrow. Some of the
penalties levied for such obnoxious behavior
were things like clearing the bench, single
fouls, or in the case of the crowd doing it
one of the coaches was given a technical.
  Halftime seems to serve about one purpose.
An open floor to place sandwich boards for 
your favorite corporate muckety muck. "Tonite's
game of Dodgeball is sponsored by Midwest
Express and Piggly Wiggly, Klements sausages
and Senator Herb Kohl." No it's not, all that
and Dodge itself. The winner gets a brand new
Dodge car. Gee if that doesn't keep you from
buying Chevy or Ford, I don't know what will.
Or any car, for that matter, right? 
  OK, it's Verizon text messaging time. Get out
your verizon cellfones. (we'll allow other fones
so long as you let us keep saying verizon out 
loud. Verizon) Call the verizon fone number on 
the centercourt teleprompt and whoever's the first
to hear the operator try to sell you fone service
will win a nifty verizon prize. Did I say verizon?
  Verizon.
  Wow, the crowd goes simply wild for snippets of
Ozzy's "Crazy Train." And Tim Thomas has 25 points.
  The "guy" shooting halftime hoops as Bango the 
Bucks mascot has a dirty little secret I should 
tell you about. Yup, even deeper than Victoria, 
of Victoria's Secret fame.
  You ready for this?
  Bango the Bucks' mascot boy is a girl. She's 
30 and she rocks! The woman behind me in the 
bleachers does her hair. This was whispered
to me by her daughter. It turns out the woman's
only done her hair once, but the rest is fact.
Her mom thinks her name was Jennifer.
  So was it a Portland timeout or MKE when the
cheerleaders performed a rendition of Bachman
Turner Overdrive's "Takin' Care Of Business?"
Besides "Crazy Train," this was clearly the
only other song to outdo "Carwash" in pop smash.
First verse and the chorus three times. My 
partner and I showed off bigtime.
  Not only did I smell pot two or three times
throughout the game, but I went to bed last
nite and woke up this a.m. with that grungy
grimy gooey throat I tend to get whenever I
leave the east-coast casinos Foxwoods and 
Mohegan Sun. I don't request they cut out
smoking if that's what it was, but I would
suggest they spend the millions needed to 
ventilate the whole stadium properly.
  Do it fast before people sue you for
second hand smoke damage. The only reason
Foxwoods didn't lose their shirt over that
one is they were making so many billions
per month they could afford the low millions
or high hundred thousands to settle out.
  So I had a really good time at the Bucks
game last night. I want to thank the secret
donors who got me there. In my current
lifestyle, if I had the extra forty-bucks-
a-ticket in cash lying around I'd surely
spend it on something else like breakfast
here in the Hyatt or parafin for my bike
chain or something instead. But I did have 
a great time nonetheless. 
  So yes, there's probably a lot I can say
bad against corporate sports, but one thing
I must point out about the Bucks besides
being owned and operated by one of the WORST
senators the US has ever seen, is that the
stadium donates leftover foods to the shelter
I help run on a fairly regular basis. That is
compassion at its finest. 
  Shit!
  I was gonna end this here and pay out the
damage, but I just met two guys from my favorite
sport. Yup. Soccer. The Force are here to play
the Wave this afternoon. So I was schmoozing
with them a little. They're cool. And to top
it off, I had enough schmoozing, so I ended
saying "Beat Milwaukee, please. I'm from CT,"
and one of them held me back saying, "which
part?" He's from Newtown. Ah, the Newtown Bee
newspaper, and visions of WLAD before it went
easylistening danced in my head. I told them
about Italian soccer showing on bigscreen
tomorrow morning at the best coffeeshop in 
town if they have time before their next road
game, and made my way back to the laptop and
the morning paper.
  So hopefully now I can put this story to
"galley" and "blow this taco stand" before
I bump into some girl from a bus-and-truck
show, or some talkshow host or cheesecake
salesman.
