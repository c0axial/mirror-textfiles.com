 THE GREAT "GAS OUT"
 It's time we did something about 
the price of gasoline in America!  
We are all sick and tired of high 
prices when there are literally 
millions of gallons in storage.  
Know what I found out?  If there 
was just ONE day when no one 
purchased any gasoline, prices 
would drop drastically. The 
so-called oil cartel has decided 
to slow production by some 
2 million barrels per day to 
drive up the price.  I have 
decided to see how many Americans 
we can get to NOT BUY ANY GASOLINE 
on one particular day!  Let's have 
a GAS OUT!  
  Do not buy any  gasoline on 
APRIL 30, 1999!!!!!  
Buy on Thursday before, or Saturday 
after. Do not buy any gasoline on 
FRIDAY, APRIL 30, 1999. 
Wanna help?  
Send this message to everyone you 
know. Ask them to do the same. 
All we need is a few million to 
participate in order to make 
a difference. Let me know how 
many will send out. We CAN make a 
difference.

Thank-you.

Hey Marc, 
I've got a poem for your zine. 
Kelsi
 
    ----<><><><>----

I live in a place called free,
where you do what you do,
and you be what you be.

No one is exiled or 
shunned at first glance,
everyone here
is given a chance.

Too bad you must die 
to be where I've been
to hear what I've heard, 
to see what I've seen.

No longer do I, feel superior to those,
who once had no friends
'cause they had no cool clothes.

In heaven you see, 
we are all equal,
I am to you, 
as you are to me

         KOSOVO VERSION
Yeah, come on all of you, big strong men,
Uncle Sam needs your help again.
He's got himself in a terrible jam
Way down yonder in KOSOVO
So put down your books and pick up a gun,
We're gonna have a whole lotta fun.

And it's one, two, three,
What are we fighting for ?
Don't ask me, I don't give a damn,
Next stop is KOSOVO;
And it's five, six, seven,
Open up the pearly gates,
Well there ain't no time to wonder why,
Whoopee! we're all gonna die.

Well, come on generals, let's move fast;
Your big chance has come at last.
Gotta go out and get those SERB'S
The only good SERBIAN is the one who's dead
And you know that peace can only be won
When we've blown 'em all to kingdom come.

And it's one, two, three,
What are we fighting for ?
Don't ask me, I don't give a damn,
Next stop is KOSOVO;
And it's five, six, seven,
Open up the pearly gates,
Well there ain't no time to wonder why
Whoopee! we're all gonna die.

Huh!

Well, come on Wall Street, don't move slow,
Why man, this is war au-go-go.
There's plenty good money to be made
By supplying the Army with the tools of the trade,
Just hope and pray that if they drop the bomb,
They drop it on the SERBIANS.

And it's one, two, three,
What are we fighting for ?
Don't ask me, I don't give a damn,
Next stop is KOSOVO.
And it's five, six, seven,
Open up the pearly gates,
Well there ain't no time to wonder why
Whoopee! we're all gonna die.

Well, come on mothers throughout the land,
Pack your boys off to KOSOVO.
Come on fathers, don't hesitate,
Send 'em off before it's too late.
Be the first one on your block
To have your boy come home in a box.

And it's one, two, three
What are we fighting for ?
Don't ask me, I don't give a damn,
Next stop is KOSOVO.
And it's five, six, seven,
Open up the pearly gates,
Well there ain't no time to wonder why,
Whoopee! we're all gonna die.

<PAWN> PENTAGON SAYS BLAH, BLAH, BLAH,

BLAH.
[Laundryton, DC.] - For the 432nd time
this year, men with bowties, beady eyes
and malnourished evil faces have spoken
officially on the Pentagon's behalf and
for the 432nd time Jennifer Smith is not
impressed.
   "Sounds like gibberish to me," said
Jenny, the New Jersey teen, a polysigh
major at Georgetown minoring in rhetoric.
   "Blah blah blah! You ask me, I say
same shit different day, you know? I 
can get more up to date news rereading
page 92 of 1984 by George Orwell,
published in 1948 by Bantam Walden Hill,
Donnelly Random World Warner House Brace
Dalton Jovanovich Mather Lynch & Hughes 
Burroughs, inc."
   Jenny said she hates being away from 
home so young in life, she hates the 
phone calls she used to get when at 
seven years of age people used to dial
her up at 867-5309 and ask her "who can
I turn to?" and she really hates liver.
   But asked what she would do given the
choice between joining ROTC or eating
liver, she was seen setting her cellphone
to redial 8675309 and stuffing enough 
cow guts, pig intestines and horse heart
to expire a man twice her age, and 
three times her size.

LEONIA, NJ - For people lined up five city
blocks awaiting their next meal, you
wouldn't know the economy's the best it's
ever been.
   "Happy days are here again..." Longstein
was heard singing to nobody in particular,
complete with perfect harmony, occasional
word salad, and constant facial tics.
   Just yesterday Longstein was worth forty
billion.
   Asked what done him in, Longstein said, 
"I invested in Serbia one year too early!"
He explained that had he waited until 
August or September, he could have trebled
his capitalism on no money down. But for
his poor timing he's now the proud owner
of a failing bodybag and casketmaking
factory in Billings, Mont.
   Lonstein, expecting to fall to his 
death from the Empire Stout building,

Garden of Love
    submitted by someone else.

well there's a rose for the way 
my spirits rose when we met,
a forget-me-not to remind me 
to remember not to forget,
an ash for the way i 
ashed you to be true,
and a pine for the way 
i pined over you.

And the sun and the rain,
fell from up above,
and landed on the earth below 
in my garden of love.

There's a beetroot for the day 
you said that you to be-true to me,
a sweet pea for the sweet way 
you always used to ....smile at me.
but you had friends who needed you,
there was ferdy, there was liza,
so just for them, i put down 
a load of fertilizer

And the sun and the rain,
fell from up above,
and landed on the earth below 
in my garden of love.

now gus the gardener's left now 
and you went with him too,
the fungus here reminds me of 
the fun gus is having with you.
the rockery's a mockery, 
with weeds it's overgrown,
the fuschia's gone ...
i can't stand the fuschia all alone.

and my teardrops fell like rain 
from the skies above
and poisoned all the flowers
in my garden of love.

MEDIA RE-PORT, by rATIug.
Garrison Keillor's telling about 
100 jokes in a row tonite. Shoulda
called it "I've heard about half."
I suspect he's just printed out
every set-up that's been forwarded
or cc'd to him and 562 other people
this week.

I take it back, he had some guests
on next that played some really 
great olde thyme bluze, and then
Paula Poundstone came onstage and
gave great talk.
   
OK I don't take it back. The jokes
he read sucked. Everything else 
about the show was out of this 
world. Splendorific, terrous oxide, 
shag-adellic, baybeee. Oh, beHAVE.

If you hurry, you can catch the
rebroadcast 2morrow (sunday) on a

simply red "holding back the years" 
in my head.

sing a sad lonely song of the bindings 
of time, of the 80s long gone and the
clothing & styles long gone -- 
first time simply red appeared on the 
radio and where it is now, an office 
staple, and all the places in the world 
in constant change. singing about 
looking for when i changed, or when it
