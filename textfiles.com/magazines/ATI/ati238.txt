Hi, I'm prime anarchist and here's my rant
for the weekend of August 17, 2000. The moon was
full. Did you get to enjoy it at all?
  Bob Griese's son is playing for the Denver Broncos
this year. How bizarre. Dale Earnhardt Jr, Muhammad
Ali's daughter, Hank Williams' grandson. What next?
  Does "Pudge" Fisk have any athletic kids?
  Anyone know any big trucking companies besides
Rollins and Ryder? I need a new stage name.

Are you familiar with Nomar Garciaparra's quirky ritual that he performs
every time he comes to the plate? After each pitch he fastens and
unfastens the velcro on his batting gloves. And while the pitcher is
beginning his windup Nomar repeatedly digs first his right toe and then
his left toe into the dirt of the batter's box. He does the same thing
each time. There's a certain rhythm to it. 

Well, my friend Perry tells me his girlfriend April (a serious baseball
fan) noticed that last night Nomar performed his entire ritual before
each pitch .... even though he knew he was receiving an INTENTIONAL BASE
ON BALLS!!! I guess he isn't aware of what his hands and feet are doing
when he is at bat. The man is possessed!

What do you think of Ralph Nader's position on the issues? I agree with
him more so than with any other candidate in this or any other election. 

I hope lots of people vote for Nader. I realize that many people view it
as helping Bush by "robbing" Gore of votes. But in the long run it's wise
to vote for Nader and the Green Party now, because if the Green Party
gets enough votes this year it can be guaranteed federal election funding
in future elections. Then we'll truly have alternatives. But you already
knew that.

Here's an "only in America" ticket: Lieberman (a Jew) and Nader (an
Arab-American, specifically Lebanese). Both from CT, of course.

Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of the 
LAPD's operation Monday night is that the one
way in which police did show a discriminating 
use of force was by targeting the media present 
at the event. One veteran journalist heard 
officers receive express directions to "shoot 
that [expletive] with the camera." He was shot 
six times. Another freelance photographer 
standing by as the protesters were dispersed 
was shot in the head by an officer at point-blank 
range.

Crackdown On Dissent In Cradle Of Liberty 
  By Steven Slosberg 
Whether Los Angeles proves more tolerant than Philadelphia toward
public displays of disaffection will be known imminently. Adam Cook, 
for one, won’t be there to observe the reception on the streets 
surrounding the Democratic National Convention.
  He’s just out on $30,000 bail after being busted in Philadelphia 
at the onset of the Republic National Convention. His offenses? 
Nine misdemeanors, including possessing instruments of crime such 
as duct tape, chicken wire and PVC pipe. He was also charged with 
conspiracy to harm a police officer.
  Cook, the 26-year-old son of state Sen. Cathy Cook, a Groton
Republican, may be angry, but he is not the mad anarchist. He’s 
a puppeteer.
  He lives in New London, works at the Color Outpost, a graphic 
design shop on State Street and studied at the Bread and Puppet 
Theater in Vermont. At 6-foot-5, he’s achieved rather recognizable
standing in puppeteering, including a two-man itinerant street 
theater enterprise, Insurrection Landscapers.
  Credentials notwithstanding, Cook was just another activist 
putting together 20-foot-high puppets for a march protesting 
the death penalty and criminal justice system when scores of 
Philadelphia police knocked on the door of an old trolley 
building in West Philadelphia. This was Aug. 1, a Tuesday 
afternoon, just as the GOP convention, miles away in downtown
Philadelphia, was hitting stride.
  "We asked if they had a warrant, and they responded by spraying 
Mace through the mail slot," said Cook, sitting at his second-floor 
worktable at the Color Outpost on Monday. 
  "There were 30 to 50 cop cars and helicopters. They came through 
skylights and spit down on us. They sawed through the building next 
door."
  Police arrested some 80 people in the puppet making warehouse. 
In all, nearly 400 protestors were booked during the convention.
  Cook, who’d staged protests against the International Monetary 
Fund last spring in Washington, D.C., came to Philadelphia to 
participate in demonstrations organized loosely by the Direct 
Action Network. He said the protests were not as well orchestrated 
as in Seattle and Washington, D.C., and the violent confrontations 
with police on bicycles, motorcycles and horses were more the action 
of individuals. 
  "Those were stupid tactics and we need to work to curb them," 
said Cook. "But you get more property destruction after a hockey 
game and nobody gets treated the way we were."
  Cook says he did not participate in vandalism or violence. He and 
the others arrested with him -- the "Puppetistas" -- made figures out 
of paper and plastic.
  They were handcuffed -- most, including Cook, behind the back --
herded onto buses and spent the next 10 hours being driven around 
the city in 90-degree heat inside vehicles without ventilation or 
water. He wasn’t physically abused, but said the handcuffs were 
tighter than they had to be. Cook was kept 48 hours as a "John Doe"
in a jail cell with five other people. He is due in court in 
Philadelphia in September.
  All for the crime of making puppets. His possessions, including 
tools, were destroyed during the raid.
   He saw protest marches curtailed under the guise of charging 
$10,000 for parade permits. He saw what he calls the pageantry of 
protest -- theater, puppets, parades -- crushed, and confrontations 
reduced precariously to cops against activists. "There is a crackdown 
on political dissent," said Cook. "In Philadelphia, cradle of liberty, 
they shut down the right of free speech."
   As he watches LA from afar, Cook, registered as an independent,
wonders how much his vote, bolstered only by his voice and creativity,
matters. It no longer seems quite as intimidating a force for change 
as, say, duct tape.

Part 2

"A Parent Opposes The PMRC"

I must admt that until the PMRC hearings, I had never heard of Tipper Gore. 
Nor had I heard very much on her husband, Al, except that he was the son of 
a powerful Tennessee senator who served in the 1950's and 1960's. But as I 
watched the news reports of the hearings, I was amazed that records like 
that existed.But at the same time,  I had heard of very few of the groups 
cited for obscene lyrics.

At that time in 1985, I was 21 years old, and living in Hattiesburg, 
Mississippi. At first, my impression of the PMRC was ambivalence. 
"They're not trying to censor, so what?" I thought. This is America. 
We don't censor. Besides, I don't buy those records anyway. 

But as time goes by, your values change. 

I got married for the first time in 1986. My wife was a Catholic. 
The community she was from was very close-knit. Shortly after we 
got married, I was stationed at Fort Carson, Colorado. We lived 
off-post, in Colorado Springs. It was there that she (and I) got 
a heaping taste of religious bigotry. There was a church called 
"Victory Chapel", a non-denominational church in Colorado Springs 
that tried to "save" Catholics. Well, one day, one of the members 
tried to tell her that she was an "idol-worshiper", and this hurt 
her feelings deeply. I confronted the guy that did it, and he said 
her religious beliefs were "wrong". Later, this same person was 
busted on DWI (driving while intoxicated) charges. Nobody from 
Victory Chapel was at his hearing.

One day, I found a copy of Frank Zappa's autobiography. I knew he 
testified against the PMRC, but never read his testimony. It didn't 
take long to realize that I should have paid more attention. 

After my discharge, I returned to Mississippi. I began working at 
the hospital in Itawamba County. One night, I was channel surfing, 
and I caught a John Ankerberg program that dealt with rock music. 
Ankerberg had a rock music "expert" by the name of Eric Holmberg 
who told the TV audience that, in essence, rock music was responsible 
for everything from teen suicide to bad grades. He proceeded to give 
examples of "bad rock" that gave credence to his claims. He showed 
album covers that, in his opinion, were anti-religious or satanic. 
One of them was Dead Kennedys' "In God We Trust, Inc.", which showed 
a crucifix made of dollar bills. And, of course, the Beatles' "butcher 
cover"(which was never made available for retail sale, but some copies
got out with the new cover pasted over the old one).

Being the curious soul I am, I decided to put Ankerberg and company 
to the test. I bought a copy of "In God We Trust, Inc.". After viewing 
the TV program, I realized that Rev. Ankerberg and Co. were twisting 
the truth. One day in Memphis, I spotted a copy of Jello Biafra's 
"No More Cocoons" LP. On a whim, I decided to buy it. I have listened 
many times since. 

Later, I ordered a copy of Tipper Gore's book, "Raising PG Kids In An 
X-Rated Society", the book that was mentioned on "No More Cocoons". 
Jello was more truthful than Tipper. My first impression of the book 
was that Tipper had not the faintest clue what was going on in America. 
In short, she struck me as someone who had little, if any, idea what 
parenting in America was about. 

In 1992, my son Matt was born. Because Cathy had complications during 
birth and gestational diabetes, we decided that one was enough. As a 
parent now, I began to pay closer attention to what was being done in 
the name of "the children". Most often, those who gave the impression 
of "helping" kids were actually furthering their own agendas. And, in 
the long run, these agendas were harmful not just for children, but 
for all of society in general. And, it was up to me, as a parent, to 
guard against such things.

The ORGANIC MAYA GOLD Dark Chocolate candy bar contains cocoa beans 
grown under controlled organic conditions by the indigenous Maya of 
the Maya Mountains of Belize.
  Originally the Maya flavoured their cocoa with allspice and vanilla.
MAYA GOLD recaptures this sweet and spicy flavour with the low sugar 
content you'd expect from the Green & Black's company. 
  This FAIRTRADE - marked product has a direct benefit on the lives
of the Maya producers and their families.

I listen to the men talk, and
I try to keep my mouth shut, because
Everything they say
Pisses me off.
They talk about the old times,
They say that things were better
Before the world was run
By niggers and cunts.
I sit in the corner, and
Listen to their bullshit
While they spread their lies and hate.
As their asses get bigger
>From all the beer they drink,
I watch the minutes tick by,
And wish that I weren't here-
Because in their twisted minds
I know it's all my fault.
