Makes my spine hurt.

FROM THE PUBLISHER

Did anyone do any good april fools jokes?

I forgot to, unless you count asking the lady in the basement
barbershop of the Reyburn building for a straight razor
shave and a haircut, (only cost 10$ American by the way) and
then taking some of those little 2car subways between all those
buildings and the Capitol til I got bored with that.

The drivers were all very nice. 40 years ago HS Thompson might
call them colored chicks, but I'll be more Fonettikly Korekt
with afro-american. If anyone still doubts the "triple a" here
in the US (AAA = All Amerikan Apartheid) just sneak in on one
of these rides and watch how many middle aged white men hop
on and say something to the effect of "onward james," you'll
see what I mean.

YES PEOPLE, I'M TALKING ABOUT OUR NATION'S CAPITOL - WHERE
LOWERCASE THINGS HAPPEN EVERY DAY. They're representing US,
so it'll be like that in YOUR neck of the woods soon. Trust
me and be very afraid. Very afraid.

And I'm sure I'll be vomiting more of this stuff way before
I've developed it, until I recover from my few days there. I
have no idea how these people do it there day in and day out.

For now I'll leave you with this one gonzo thought.

Ready?

I just lived in our nation's capitol for four days again and I
can assure you that...

...Utz potatoe chips still exist
...Mel Gibson is at least five (count 'em, 5!) of the cab drivers
in that town
...the phone book for the northwest sector is still over 2/3 attorneys
at law
...approximately 1/6 at something else
...the samoza at the Indian Delights restaurant in Union Station is
still the same as it ever was, you will poop in four and a half
minutes and you'll feel happy, smily and warm for two full days.
...the stairs in Georgetown where Linda Blair kicked Father Damien
down to his "death" are still there.
...but where's the Starbucks where Bill Clinton's lesbian lover
died?
...George Bush is still not related to anyone of the Dulles family.

and the number one "..." is

...1/3 of our senators and congress"men" do not currently have drug
and/or alcohol problems. Oh and almost all of them are current on
their child support payments.

  LETTUCE

This price increase really bothers me, not only because
it costs more, but in the letter from the publisher it
talks about the price of gas being one of the causes,
and I didn't think that the prime anarchist even owned
a car?

SKANDLE UV DA WEAK
Here's what I sent to Ralph McGehee who quit the CIA a very
long time ago, and now writes a lot about his feelings
regarding US foreign policy in usenet.

Mr McGehee,

That 1.3 billion dollar aid to colombia package
has a scandal waiting to break. I have this one on
my own personal eyes and ears. I was Monday in Mark
Green's office for an hour and a half discussing defunding
the School of the Americas, and a half hour of it was with 
the Congressman himself present. The rest of our time was
with staffers of course, but I digress.

Talk came up of that bill because he has many migrant farmworker
constituants in our homestate and district. The Latino community
here was very disappointed with him since he'd said he would vote
no and then it appeared he "didn't vote no on it."

Mark told us he DID vote /no/ but the electronic equipment
recorded a /yes/ for him. He's also dead set against this
package because Ingrid (1 of 3 killed by FARC) is in his
district and he's gotten to know most of her family now
that she's gone.

He's looking into exactly what the error was, before he sends
out a public apology/clarification/statement etc.

More will follow obviously.


OVERHEARD IN LISTSERVLAND

By the way I was quite upset on that day because while
I was at Western Union, a student came and to send
some money to Cuba - and the employees almost threw
him out because of the American embargo on Cuba and
Western Union being American. Yeah, maybe they are but
they have customers all over the world and live on
international currency!I told them that. If it weren't
for our Dine'h friends I would have left their office,
I felt terrible. I wish I never have to use their
services again. This US imperialism is sickening.
Well I know a lot of people here including my family
and students who boycott coca-cola because in Europe
it's a symbol of US imperialism.

  Kurt Loder: Still Gathering No Moss.
SEPT 2, '99 - A Review
  You know I do a lot of magazines. And they sure pile up.
Sorry, I'm just now getting to this one, but Kurt Loder's
Rolling Stone review of Woodstock '99 was some fine stuff.
  I don't much care for his MTV personality, but his work
at RS is noteworthy, some of his word choice bugs the 
bejeezus out of me, but overall he's a straight up choice
journalist.


PICTURE THIS -- "A baby's hand holding an apple."

  My friend Ryan told me about the most disturbing
factory job he's ever taken. I think he's already quit
this one ['thank God,' muttered under breath.]
  He ran a computer that ran another computer that ran
another computer that ran a computer that ran some robotic
arms that made things.
  When they trusted him he got to run the computer that ran
another computer that ran a computer that ran robotic arms
that made things.
  Then, since he was so competent, they let him run the 
computer that ran another computer which ran those robotic
arms that made things.
  Soon, with a bigger paycheck in hand each month he loyally
ran the computer who makes things with his robotic arms.
  Until he was shown what the robotic arms were making.
  Robotic arms.


JUST A THOUGHT: From The DC Notes
I would say the World Bank takes up the whole block
but it also growth spurted across the street into
three other blocks. 
  If we don't do something about this, will it take
over the whole Potomac? OK, maybe all of Chevy Chase.
I know, let's rename District of Colombia to World
Bank District.

The Doberman The Dirt And The Diet.
  What are you feeding that thing???
Your front, back and side yard is completely
devoid of life! 
  There's not a blade of crab, blue OR hemp
grass inside your fenceline anywhere.

NEED ANOTHER OBSERVATION? HERE:
  Turtle Island has a lot of scars.
I honestly don't know which issue is more
urgent: the environment or racial tension.
  But then they're both poverty issues,
aren't they?

SHOULD THERE BE A MEAT INDUSTRY THIS BIG?
  I watch a cow itch his neck on a fencepost --
faster tempo than I've ever played my guitar,
lemme tell you.
  I'm afraid he looks like in about 20 more
strokes he'll have ringed or decapitated
himself.
  Speed? Antibiotic? Monkey hormones?
Who knows.

You know, if we keep up with these earthmovers,
the planet will no longer be where it was.


& we end with a poetry

WAITING IN POST OFFICE LINE
  by Stazja McFadyen

If you had noticed me
waiting my post office customer turn
caught in suspended animation
you might have mistaken
stoic demeanor for patience.

If you were a curious person
you'd follow my gaze
to government pamphlets

harmlessly inked on innocent paper
white as a baby's baptism gown.

If you were observant,
looking through my eyes
you'd see ugly ominous meanings
disguised as patriotic words of duty:
"Selective Service and You."

If you were being me
you would shiver from chilling draft
stirring lifetimes of memory dust devils
cycloning holocaust ashes.
Mental maternal mutiny
would rage against infernal machine
that swallows young men whole
spitting out soldiers
for sacrifice
to insatiable war minotaur.

And while you were me
recalling the instant of agony
followed by ecstasy
birthing your son
you would commit
private acts of reason
and treason against
war mongering men and their minions -
miniature men writing government pamphlets.

You might have noticed me
stoically step out of line.
