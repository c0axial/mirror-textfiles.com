COLUMN IN THE FORM OF A POME
  By The Prime Anarchist

We clash you and me.
First I thought because you are so different, you see.
But then after all the dust cleared
And the shrapnel was swept up into neat little tins
And all our respective allies' bodies were policed up by loved ones -
Dogs and crows and old men with metal detectors and headphones
Closing the circle in little by little hoping to find a scrap or two,
And the grandmothers all weep over tea, saying 

I Told You So: See? Nothing Was Accomplished Again; 
Who's Gonna Feed The Kids.

For the 432nd time,
It was then I realized:
The reason you and me,
We used up every bullet we had
Not because we're so different, you see.

Because we're mirror images, aren't we?
Like Isaac and Ishmael maybe, 
But who needs analogies when we're each other?
We do kinda look alike, huh? 
Besides all the acting, and talking 
And walking like each other.

But enemy, my friend.
Can I ask you one question?
What kind of Creator lets us miss each other that many times?

LETTER OF ASSURANCE TO PARENTS OF A TEMPORARILY MISSING FAMILY MEMBER.
  Please try not to worry. There are no telephones at the 
gathering. It is probably a half day's journey to the nearest 
payphone. Cell phones don't work at the site.
  Hopefully someone will take a message to the gathering and 
post it at INFO. But please realize that just because a message 
even makes it to the message board, doesn't mean anyone will see it.
  Please try not to worry. If he's at the gathering and you haven't 
heard from him that means he's doing ok. If something bad was wrong 
he would have ended up in police/hospital areas and been able to call 
you. In other words, no news is good news.
  The bulk of the people will be leaving the gathering in the next few 
days.  You should hear from him soon. Please realize that the gathering 
is a totally decentralized disorganized peaceful and calm event. So it's 
very hard to contact people while they are at the gathering.
  If you happened to know what camp he was planning on staying with, it 
would fascilitate getting a message to him. The gathering is spread out 
over a few square miles so it's hard to find folks unless you know where 
they might be.
  Here's a great big hug to hold you over until you hear from Jeremy.
Love,
Karin


OPEN LETTER TO THE HARTFORD COURANT:
  Wow, thank you very much for making my heart
smile this Thursday morning. I went to my news
on the internet and learned that you've formally
apologized for your corporate sponsorship of
slavery all those years, which you so aptly termed 
the buying and selling of human beings.
  I find your penitential reflection almost as 
profound a moment as when the song "Amazing Grace" 
was penned.
  Now if you would help me any way you can, I
believe our nation is still living under some form
of apartheid. Let's at it.

AND NOW A WORD OR THREE FROM POET 
BRETT AXEL: RE: B & Not So Noble
---------------------------------
http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/departments/06_29_00/upfront_%20censorship.html
   "In Germany first they came for the communists and I didn't speak up 
because I wasn't a communist. Then they came for the Jews and I didn't 
speak up because I wasn't a Jew. Then they came for the trade unionists 
and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a trade unionist. Then they came 
for the Catholics and I didn't speak up because I was a Protestant. 
Then they came for me  --- and by that time no one was left to speak up." 
  -- Pastor Martin Niemoller (victim of Nazis) 
   I'd rather not speak up.  My livelihood depends on stores like Barnes 
& Noble selling my books.  Hell, I'm still waiting for checks from 
Barnes & Nobles in San Antonio, Austin, and Waterbury Conn.  I also 
know that things like this have been happening in isolated spots 
around the country.  As long as they are isolated incidents, when the 
new puritanism silences you, there will be no one left to speak up. 
   If it matters to you, gather a few poets and make your statement, 
pass word & Feel free to let your local media in on this National 
statement.

DESTROY ALL PAPERGEEKS: A Short Story 
With Only One Developed Character
  by Marco

Attorneys are ALWAYS asking for funds toward phone calls.
Many of them claim they pay about seven dollars a minute
to talk on the phone. They say they pay 3 dollars a gallon
for gas and they must pay 75 cents per photocopy, more if
it's color and more for both sides, and Judas forbid it be
an odd size!
  No wonder after agreeing to give them 33% when you sue someone
who hurt you s/he goes after 10,000 and your "two-thirds" after paying
extras turns out to be about 4,000!!!
  I joined a class action against a nasty bill collector where I was
assured they were going to get me $2,000 besides erasing my old debt.
  "Only contact us if you don't want to join." Of course I got the
letter after the suit began so I just kept on keeping on. He got me the
2000 alright - we all won fair and square. After expenses I still stood
to gain quite a bit he assured me in a form letter with more cc's than 
I've even seen in spam! I was very excited about the check when it came
in. I'll never forget the day. It came to my mom's house so I had to go 
eat her famous tunafish sandwiches with the perfect little squared off 
cubes of celery in 'em and the Hellmans mayo she swore by. Her mom
insisted on miracle whip, mom was a hellmans girl. Probably television's 
fault, but I digress.
  You got mail, my mom told me. "I think it's good news. It looks like
a check." You know those windows with your name on it? OK I'll cut to
the chase. The suspense is killing you.

   Nineteen bucks and chumpchange. I think 35 cents or something.

  I was pissed. Say it ain't so, Joe. Disillusionment is well...
pretty durned disillusioning.
  My first and last lawsuit I've ever agreed to so far in life.
Not for lack of opportunities, just that, well, to quote Odetta,
  "and before I'll be a slave, I'll be buried in my grave, go
home to my maker and be free."


ONE LITTLE APPLESEED
  by Marco Capelli

  I found a good reason for a capo instead of transposing today.
You learn a song exactly as it's played but it's a key that 
doesn't suit your voice. My example is "I Was Only Joking" by
Rod Stewart. Not too low for me to sing, per se. Too low for
me to sing powerfully. I sing it every day because the lyrics
mean so much to me. I've never noticed anyone singing along to
this one.
  Today I was singing it capo'ed up two frets and a teacher 
about my age with three children around age 9 recognzed it. So
did one of her girls.
  She tried to sing along, but of course now I'm in a key that's
completely odd for her. Noticing this and wishing to respond, I
told her I'll sing it again in the key it's supposed to be as long
as she's willing to lead, because my voice isn't very powerful 
through most of those notes. She was happy to.
  Now, I'll end saying this. Heavily inspired by Pete Seeger, I
walk the following path:
] My only purpose for singing is for the off chance
] every once in a while I can get a whole bunch of
] people around me to all sing
]    T O G E T H E R
] Frankly, if I wanted to sing for you to simply sit there 
] and hear me, I would have run for preacher or president.
  

"Grandfather 
     advised me: 
          Learn a trade 
I learned 
     To sit at a desk 
          and condense 
     No layoff 
          from this 
               condensery"

   --Lorine Niedecker

  "There's something fantastic and moving in the simple
fact that every November we all stop in an elementary
school or firehouse and overthrow the government."
  --Aaron Sorkin having maybe a little too much
    faith? Quoted in a recent George magazine.

FINE PRINT

This e-zine is the result of the most modern typing
techniques in the zinemaking industry.
  In HITECH - the 15 degree cutter slant angle is
utilized, the latest development in the art of
invective, allegory and wit.
  The non-linear setup greatly reduces distortion
and gives the utmost reproduction of the original
thought through its dynamic depth control and 
reliable stylistic wording. To protect your zine,
print it out immediately and get as far away from
your computer as you can.
  In LOTECH - the master typings are transferred
directly through the finest Amp-X (active music
and poetry non-windows-based) 300 series typing
machine to a specially designed VDT which drives
the BBC crazy because of all the state secrets it
can figure out on its own. Because of the simplicity
of our new typing techniques, quality satire, 
cynicism and assorted other humour is assured.
  HI or LO TECH, your e-zine will give you the 
truest possible reproduction of original thought.


Have you seen the movie "HEAD?"
  Produced by Jack Nicholson; choreographed by Toni
Basil. Starring the Monkees. Annette Funicelo, Sonny
Liston and Frank Zappa all have cameos, among many
others. I just saw a rerun thanks to VH-1. I think 
it got lost on people who were not there "in the now,"
back then. 
  You want my opinion it was either a profoundly major
movie, or a majorly profound one. Take your pick.

#1 A re-writable LP record printing press.
#10 Effect pedal to make whatever amp you're using

POLICEMAN'S LOG - CARDATE 9919092109
(PAWN) - Anytown, USA - Police are on the lookout
for a poetical prankster they say is travelling
town to town committing close calls with his 
alliteration, rhyme scheme and armed manic attempted
murders.
  "Nobody dies," said Natalia Derosers," but we all
get such close calls it's so stressful."
  She said he picks a new city every Saturday, but
in a very haphazard way he seeks someone to simulate
a slow motion meditated murder with.
  Take Deroser's husband for instance.
  "He threatened his life with a knife, pressed it
against his chest, and then made it look as if he'd
stabbed him in the abdomen," said she.
  She went on to say he left the knife on the ground
and walked off without a sound, stepping it up to a
run in his Tevas and Levi 501's.
  Police are still searching and have this to say,
  "If he comes to your city, he should be considered
armed, shirtless, and extremely witty."

OPINION - Al Gore will be appearing around Wisconsin
this week with Bill Bradley sharing the stage. Has he
been doing this already, or is this news? 
    [this just in, I found out it IS news. It
    will be their first appearance together.]
  I know a lot of political things start here in WISC
Land. Well, besides cheese! I'm talking LaFollette,
McCarthy, schools that actually teach, Abe Lincoln
stabbing his first Indian, things like that. Are
there precedents for an "incumbered" travelling with
one and picking another? Or would this be some kind
of indication?

Excuse Me
  by Sandy Elia.

Please,
Excuse me for being
myself,
I'm really sorry that I'm
not good enough for you
I'm sorry if
my fat offends you
or if my teeth aren't straight
enough to please you
in your perfect aesthetic world.

I'm sorry that
my ugly face disgusts you,
and my dirty clothes amuse you
because I had to buy them
in a second hand store.

Please excuse me
as I hide my shame,
and cower below you
in fear
of not belonging 
in your world.
