ATI/PAP declares state of emergency.
 
  Activist Times, Incorporated urges all US citizens who consider themselves
dynamic to consider taking an extreme leftist stance to offset this recent
emergency.
  "This is a temprorary attack," says Prime Anarchist. "After this you can go
back to being middle of the road, or moderate right. But you have to see the
graveness of this CIA shit or youre a real dweeb."
  Anarchist says he's a registered republican but sees the need to put a
democrat in office for at least 4 years.
  "If nothing else," says anarchist, "vote on the judicial issue. I hate
Dukakis, but we need him next month!!!"

  Jackie "The Joke Man" Martling, a comedian and radio personality from East
Norwich, New York, has been a pro entertainer since age 14. He started playing
guitar in a rock and roll band before the coming of the Beatles, played all
thru his schooling at Michigan State University (mechanical engineer '71), and
continued in a Long Island-based comedy/original music trio the now infamous
Off Hour Rockers.
  Jackie made the switch to stand-up in '79 and started "Use Your Finger!!
922-WINE!!" the world's only x-rated joke line (516)922-9463, which is still in
operation and gets thousands of calls a day from all over the world.  With the
help of his laugh line, Jackie has been producing and promoting comedy shows
since the recent boom was in its infancy.
  Jackie became "The Joke Man" when his joke line was picked up by Rick Dees
from KIIS-FM in Los Angeles for his daily morning show. "Jackie The Joke Man"
is now a regular feature on Rick's nationally syndicated radio show.
  Jackie is best known in the NY Metro area as a member of FM radio's The
Howard Stern Show, heard daily from 6-10 AM on 92.3 K-Rock.
  He's playing at Governor's Comedy Shop in Long Island this week, and anyone
who might make it should call 516-731-3358 for more info.
  What did they sing at Walt Disney's funeral? Freeze a jolly good fellow.

  What's brown and has holes?  Swiss shit.

In the 5/24/88 issue of USA Today, the editorial page was devoted to discussion
of the FBI's recent practice of demanding records from the Public Library so as
to determine who is borrowing what books.
 
They are doing this under the guise of detecting and discovering Russian spy's
in the United States.  I guess we all expect the FBI to do something this dumb
and to infringe on our freedoms to this degree.  The really surprising part of
all this is that USA Today surveyed seven (7) people and of those seven, 4 said
they didn't care if the FBI inquired about what books they checked out from the
Library and only 3 said they objected to the practice.  The standard reason for
approval revolved around the premise that you shouldn't have to worry if you
weren't doing anything wrong or subversive; and only people with a guilty
conscience would object.  Can you believe that?  The FBI is going beyond their
authority.  Our freedom is again dimished.
 
TO THE EDITORS:
  Why is Manuel Noriega trading drugs to Bush for guns?

A NAZI AMERICA???
  The old lady across the street from me said she thinks America is looking
more and more like nazi Germany every day.
  The lady lived and worked in nazi Germany as a born citizen, just like you
and I would work here in New York or New Jersey.
  She says she watched the whole nazi experience grow right from its early
inception on up thru the actual killing of humans.
  What things can she see as early signs?
1) extreme nationalism
2) symbol worship (flag)
3) overt racism.
4) covert leaders (bush/cia?)
5) material fear (aids?)
6) witch-hunting hysteria (drugs?)
