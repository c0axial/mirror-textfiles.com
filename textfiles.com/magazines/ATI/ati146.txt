 AN OPEN LETTER TO WILLIAM "ACTIVIST" CLINTON:    
About Congressional Medal of Honor recipient
Nelson Mandela.
   HE DESERVED IT AT THE  B E G I N N I N G  OF
YOUR ADMINISTRATION IF NOT SOONER!!!
   And for his activism not his support of NATO,
IMF and CIA.
   And Len Peltier deserves it as much if not more.
   Who's next. The Pope?
   By the way, CIA now stands for Consumerism
Indexing Association and IMF is now the International
Military fund.
Sick of Being Sincere,
Prime Anarchist

     "More and more people these days are ending their
     telephone messages with the word 'Peace.'
     Stop it. Some men enjoy inserting their penises
     into holes in trees. This is a documented 
     psychological fact. Bob Dole lives next door to
     Monica Lewinski, in Watergate, DC."

socket in a wall of the principal's office. They didn't have

DUSTY'S NOTES FROM THE UNDERGROUND.
     BY F. SKI
Imagine being the one typing in:
   Congress Will Vote on $1 Minimum Wage Increase
and watching the DOW climb 60 points in two minutes.

Then imagine being the same one typing in:
   Congress Votes Down $1 Minimum Wage Raise
and watching it go down 50 in the first 30 seconds
after you hit the <send> button...

<journal note. 4pm, thurs>
I didn't know nitro-glycerine and "nitrate" were one
and the same, or at least similar. 
Until reading Celia Farber's "Viagra: One Pill Makes
You..." story in GEAR, (Bob G's newest mag) 
   Good journalism, Celia.
   What a connection that helped me make. The same "grease" 
we're putting into lousy cuts of tobacco -- too poor to 
make the cigarmaker -- because the paper won't stay lit 
without *fuel* ; we're sending "toward" our heart to keep us 
going an extra year or two? Day or two? Climax or two?
   Is the next invention out of Groton, Connecticut going
to be pure spontaneous combustion in a box?

I connected to my gateway today at 2400 for some odd 
reason. I figured "what the heck, it wasn't so bad, 
was it?" Oh my god. Talk about slow response time. 
Reminds me of the VMS system I used to work on in 
the 80's and I would just type way ahead and memorize 
my mistakes as I went along and use backspace to 
correct most of them before I got feedback on the 
screen. Then I would watch about 3 pages at a time, 
all looking like the old (before censorship!!!) AP 
tickertape machines back and forth correcting 
mistakes "live."
Oh well, that's what goes on now this session.
May my modem never again connect so low...

I apreciate your letter. My thinking about Mitnick is
quite simple. Tomorrow it might be me. I got very high 
when i read my ezine was some use for yours. Keep it going.
I'll publish your letter in my next issue, if you don't mind. 
By the way, issue 19 's got an article "Mercadores de Opiniao" 
which was uploaded only yesterday. If you can give a look 
at it.
Good luck and health.

soon forgotten I have but forgot of you, so with 
in my deapest apologies so begins this. I am but a man, 
a simple man to be seen with in the dreams of the nephin 
as a child growing into some thing of...drift. 
drifting silently as art of wich I spill out in short 
screams of love. For this is the soul of wich I have
so far and long forgotten to give. These thoughts come...
Do so love the world as you wish it to love those around 
you and thank you for your time. If you would like me
to E-mail you more writing please E-mail me with a 
subject of "poet", when I do some thing new I will 
E-mail it to every one.... Thank you all  The

Here's a recipe for Toxic Recycled Pizza Crust.
by pawn. (prime anarchist world newz)
   for those days when you don't have real ingredients
   and you're too lazy to go all the way to "la tienda"
   for a boboli.

1 loaf Wonderbread. (tm)
1 cup olive oil.  (not tm)
1 T. garlic powder.
1 cup hot water.  

Mix all ingreds. into a big bowl and moosh it up with 
your fists until it's doughy again. Get a rolling pin 
and work it on a cutting board into a big piece of
frybread-looking stuff. Pour on tomato sauce and etc.
Cook on 400-450 for a bunch of minutes checking it
often enough to look spastic. When it looks like a 
pizza it's done.

    "Our own dystopia, too, can only be detected from
    the outside - by 'outsiders' who did not watch too
    much TV when they were young; who read a few good
    books and then, perhaps, had a Satori-like awakening
    while hiking through Mexico or India; who by some
    lucky twist of fate were not seduced by The Dream
    and recruited into the consumer cult of the insatiables."
       http://www.adbusters.org

    "Eleven corporations control what amounts to the entirety
    of America's mainstram media, and they make efficient use
    of their multiple speaking orifices to promote themselves,
    both explicitly and by omission."
       ibid.



Here's a parody to a coca-cola commercial.
Because they asked for it.


When hangin with my friends at night
We notice something's just not right.

Always coca cola every time.

When looking for the one to blame
Half the companies all look the same.

Always coca-cola all the time.

They've bought up all the companies
Just about got you on your knees

Paid off all the grocery stores.
Pepsi leaves 'em beggin' for more.

always coca cola all the time.

Same old shit but different day
Monopolies are here to stay.

They're trying buying everything
They'll prob'ly steal the songs I sing.

always coca cola EVERY TIME.
