To Whom It May Concern,

I am a son born out of wedlock to George W Bush August 
10th, 1977.
  He impregnated my mum in 1976 when he was still a 
political nobody, running tricks for the Plumbers,
the Teamsters and the Minnesota Vikings. But he 
wanted to be president, and so he begged my mum to 
keep it secrete so that it will not jeopardise his 
political career but promised to take full responsibility 
of my mum and I. That is when he put us up in a stone
castle in Oxford, England for a few years.
  Sometime last week a corruption probe panel was set up
and my father was indicted in the process, so an order 
was passed that his properties be ceased and his accounts 
frozen but because he still had his diplomatic immunity 
as the president, and especially his father was the once-
head of the CIA they could not pull it off. But immediately 
after someone in a terrorist nation killed him and replaced 
him with an exact duplicate, they quickly began impounding 
his cars, ceasing up houses and freezing his accounts.
  But thank God that his will had already been executed by 
his personal lawyer, Charles G. Rebozo Jr., through whom 
I recieved the sum of $6,000,000.00 as willed ! to me by 
my late father. I quickly had to get the money out of the 
country into a security company abroad in the form of a 
consignment since I was not allowed to pass it through 
a normal bank transfer. I am the only person that knows 
the content of the consignment except as I tell you now.
Please, if you can help me do it fast because we presently 
live at the the mercies of some good samaritan who is 
accomodating and providing us some food to eat and a small
humble roof over our heads in Harlem, NYC., since the 
house that was willed to my mum and I has also been ceased.
  If you send me $600 I can take the subway to the airport
and fly right to where the money is immediately after
putting your name on the form.
  If you can help please send me your full name and
correct address so that I can change the beneficiary
to your name and get the airways bill and certificate 
of deposit to you. After this I will have to furnish
you with the detailed information about the security
company.
  Also please, if you know that you cannot help still
let me know in time so that I can look for another
person. Mind you, I will let you keep 20! % of the 
total money if you help me get the consignment from 
the security company as my humble thanks offering.

I await your urgent reply.

Best regards,
Izadore Legitt

PUBLISHER'S COLUMN 


This column is going to be a 3 or 4 part series.
I will try to put the entire thing up at etext.org
as soon as I can for those who want to read the 
entire thing right away instead of let it unfold
like Harry Potter or the StarWars NINilogy.

PART i OF "IS THE CATHOLIC CHURCH SCAPEGOATING
S/11 OR ENRON? WAHT ABOUT BOTH, WHAT ABOUT THE
WHOLE NATION? MERRILL LYNCH, IS THAT YOU???"

I can handle corruption above me. I've done it.
I once chose quitting a corporate job rather than
become a whistle blower like I perhaps should've.
  It cost me a career. A good one, but not my soul
and not any arms, legs, or my physical life or anything
else.
  Do I have regrets? Some. But not often.
  It is time to blow though. If someone has to kill me
over it, oh well. I've risked this kind of stuff before.
I just hope I quickly enough blow such a huge hole in 
the house of cards so big that before its even an option
to kill me, any willing conscripts for my death will be
already dead, retired or vacationing in Tahiti, Trinidad,
Tobago or East Timor. 
  OK, corruption above me, so what?
  You meet with your superiour, she says just go with the
flow. You try, no go. Back to the super. She sends you to
HER super. S/he sends you to his/hers. At some point you're
visiting the person in charge of your entire state, or
region. 
  He tells you, what, you have a new idea??? Listen. ALMOST
everyone else is doing it. Just go with the flow and when
YOU'RE a manager, instead of an AM (assistant manager, or
manager trainee) then if you wish, you can run the place
the way two or three impoverished shops do, instead of...
   (CON'T in issue 321 and some others)

THE NIXXON ENRON CONNECTION: Perhaps The Most Ribald Reply 
To An Indymedia Newswire Article You Ever Will See.

[ref]=[http://www.steelydan.com/lyrroyalscam.html#track9]

Two concept albums for you to listen to immediately
after watching this video. I strongly urge you to.

Pretzel Logic,
then 
Royal Scam.


Both by Steely Dan.

Woah.

Written in the early '70s.

Nothing has changed since then!

Why? 

I'll tell you why. I have one big reason,
and a lot of history rewriters are going to
kick my ass for saying this, because there's
a newfound like of this guy, which I actually
buy into a tiny bit. But overall, it's still
the god's honest truth.

We let Nixxon resign. We should have never done
that. I'm totally into non-violence now, but 
I often wonder if we shouldn't have hanged him
in a courtyard, but after peeling all his skin
off layer by layer in front of everyone who walks
by in Central Park NYC. Catharsis is what we
never gave ourself, and justice is never what we
sought.

When he resigned, people immediately said "the 
system works."

Bullshit.

No, no one noticed, did they? Almost every current 
George W Bush appointment is someone Richard Nixxon 
either molested as a boy, or shared hospital grade 
cocaine with as an adult.

This nation is severely fouled up because we didn't
make a real example out of the second largest crook
to every surface as a pResident. Richard Milhouse
Nixxon. 

You think Clinton was crooked??? I'll agree with you
to a large extent. But Nixxon was soooooo crooked he
had to screw his pants on in the morning. And sometimes
at nite.
