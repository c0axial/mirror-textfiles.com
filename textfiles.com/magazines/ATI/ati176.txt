Let a hundred and seventy six

non-violent overthrow of all
evil, violent, ill-gotten lands:

Welcome to issue 176 of ati. 
April 24th 1999. 
1999 hrs. (or 8:39pm for you weirdos)
Happy Birthday to Mumia Abu Jamal, 
Paul Ryder and David J -
and a belated birthday to Abbie 
Hoffman, Alabama Sturgeon and
Adolf Hitler. May none of you 
ever be forgotten. Even the yucky 
ones.

Hard going down isn't it?
Hi, I'm prime anarchist and 
this is my column for saturday, 
the almostfullmoon of april.
The numbers run is short, we have 
a few short letters, and we've 
pushed back some of the others 
until next week, so that we can 
have room for the entire birthday
present that Marcos sent to Mumia 
Abu-Jamal this afternoon.
I publish the English version 
only for two reasons.
    1) None of us are good enough 
       at "traducciones" yet.
       Give is time! We're working 
       treadmills on it - swear.
    2) Too much more would make our 
       weekly zine much fatter
       than we promised.
    OK there's a 3:
    There is a dream and a vision of 
    this 'zine growing organically into 
    a 100% bona-fide bilingual publication. 
    No lip-service paragraph or two at the 
    back "en espanol," no one or two best
    picture captions hoping that "THEY'LL 
    get at LEAST THAT little BIT out of 
    us..." The vision is that the tongue
    of this 'zine would once a week be 
    translated evenly into two languages: 
    ingles, y espanol; english and 
    spanish. Until then, I (the zine) 
    remain "anglo."
    For all who are "with this vision" 
    I ask one thing.
    KEEP HELPING ME LEARN THE 
    SPANISH IN THE OFF TIME!!!

I'm personally doing OK, but its 
a sad day in Denver.  As I'm sure 
you heard 15 kids were shot at 
a high school yesterday.  
I went to that high school.  
Its right up the street.  
My dad's apartment building was 
evacuated because they found 
several bombs in cars.
It's nice and sunny here.

Dear Marc,
thank you for putting two and two 
together.  This is an immense 
tragedy primarily for Serbian 
people, Kosovar refugees, but 
then also for the whole Europe 
and the world. KLA is a renown 
terrorist organization that
primarily deals with trafficking 
narcotics into Europe, many European
countries that accepted the Albanian 
minorities into their territory will 
soon become aware of this!  
THanks for all of your interest 
and concern

Marco!
in a word - failed.   
the food directors misinformed us 
about some of the details of the 
proposal, and ended up playing it
against us as a wildcard.  
  these are the same guys who 
originally helped us out by finding 
the prices and allegedly investigating 
the legitimacy of the eggs as
"free range".   
  simply, he (mike james) decieved us 
and as a result, we lost. thanks for 
your support and concern. this was a 
learning experience.  next semester we 
will not make the same mistakes and 
will definitely not trust anything they 
tell us unless it is in writing.   
i'll keep you informed.

OPEN LETTER: TO MICHAEL MOORE
Hi Michael,
How goes it?
Two orders of biz, I know you're busy.
1) Ked's sending me results of the egg 
vote at oshkosh in about 6 hours. 
I'll forward them to you from a 
different address.
2) I'll be playing my guitar on the 
capitol steps may 1 thru may 4;
Washington DC protesting School of the 
Americas.
You might already know labor is behind 
shutting this puppy down.
It would be way cool if you could 
bring your guitar (and maybe the
camcorder???) to the steps and jam 
with. (btw: what's your fave chord?)

Oh, I better say a third thing. 
Ready?
You'd asked for some whizzard to help 
you get messages autoforwarded to a new 
.org place. 
hmmm. 
Let's put our heads together, eh?

Newspapers Need to Find Uniqueness.

<PAWN> Milanta, GA - For newspapers

<PAWN>Colorado - The Phollowing...
    ----<><><><>----

I might have just confirmed that 
some of the members of tTCM are 
also western hammerskins.
Plus, guess what? When police 
finally did roll in, there were
in fact 4 trenchcoats lying 
on the floor!

    ----<><><><>----
...was reported in an ATI Midweek 
Crisis this past week. Rather than
let that lie, like so many journalists
will do in this world, in this life; I
Prime Anarchist, have chosen to phollow
thru. 
   Ready?
I spoke with members of the Trenchcoat
Mafia in more than a dozen towns in this
country, and also Western Skins in a few.
The Western Branch of the Hammerskins are
definitely in Denver heavy, and there
headquartered; however I was wrong, thank
god. They had nothing to do with the 
killings this past week in a public school
in Columbine, Colorado. Although three of 
the nine people who planned Tuesday's 
placing of pipebombs and murderous gunfire
were in fact, members of tTCM; TrenchCoat
Mafia organization itself had little or
nothing to do with the conspiracy to 
commit chaos.
   The four empty trench-coats remain a
partially unconfirmed story. I have 
confirmed two missing suspects with
a handful of credible sources, but I
was a little carried away when one 
White-Pride member I interviewed told
me it was not two, but four empty 
trenchcoats on the floor. He seemed
credible. He remains my only source on
that.

         jolly gym-shorts.

 birthday.]

Mister Mumia:
I am writing to you in the name 
of the men, women, children and elderly 
of the Zapatista Army of National 
Liberation in order to congratulate you
on April 24, which is your birthday.
Perhaps you have heard of us. 
We are Mexican, mostly indigenous, 
and we took up arms on January 1 of 1994 
demanding a voice, face and name for the
forgotten of the earth.
Since then, the Mexican government has 
made war on us and pursues us and
harasses us seeking our death, our 
disappearance and our definitive silence.
The reason? These lands are rich with oil, 
uranium and precious lumber. The government 
wants them for the great transnational 
companies. We want them for all the Mexicans. 
The government sees our lands as a business. 
We see our history written in these lands. 
In oder to defend our right (and that of all
Mexicans) to live with liberty, democracy, 
justice and dignity we became an army and 
undertook a name, voice and face that way.
Perhaps you wonder how we know of you, 
about your birthday, and why it is that
we extend this long bridge which goes 
from the mountains of the Mexican
southeast to the prison of Pennsylvania 
which has imprisoned you unjustly.
Many good people from many parts 
of the world have spoken of you, 
through them we have learned how you 
were ambushed by the North American 
police in December of 1981, of the 
lies which they constructed in the 
procedures against you, and of the 
death sentence in 1982. 
We learned about your birthday through 
the international mobilizations which,
under the name of "Millions for Mumia", 
are being prepared this April 24th.
It is harder to explain this bridge 
which this letter extends, it is more
complicated. I could tell you that, 
for the powerful of Mexico and the
government, to be indigenous, or 
to look indigenous, is reason for 
disdain, abhorrence, distrust and 
hatred. The racism which now floods 
the palaces of Power in Mexico goes 
to the extreme of carrying out a war 
of extermination, genocide, against 
millions of indigenous. I am sure 
that you will find similarities 
with what the Power in the United States 
does with the so-called "people of color" 
(African-American, Chicanos, Puerto Ricans, 
Asians, Northamerican Indians and any 
other peoples who do not have the insipid 
color of money.)
We are also "people of color" (the same 
color of our brothers who have Mexican
blood and live and struggle in the American 
Union). We are of the color "brown", 
the color of the earth, the color 
from which we take our history, our
strength, our wisdom and our hope. 
But in order to struggle we add another
color to the brown: black. 
We use black ski-masks to show our faces. 
Only in this way can we be seen and heard. 
We chose this color as a result of the
counsel of an indigenous Mayan elder who 
explained to us what the color black meant.
The name of this wise elder was Old Man 
Antonio. He died in these rebel Zapatista 
lands in March of 1994, victim of 
tuberculosis which ate his lungs and his 
breath. Old Man Antonio used to tell us 
that from black came the light and 
from there came the stars which light 
up the sky around the world. He told
us a story which said that a long time 
ago (in those times when no one measured
it), the first gods were given the task 
of giving birth to the world. In one of
their meetings they saw it was necessary 
that the world have life and movement,
and for this light was necessary. 
Then they thought of making the sun 
in order that the days move and so 
there would be day and night and 
time for struggling and time for making 
love, walking with the days and nights 
the world would go.
The gods had their meeting and made this 
agreement in front of a large fire,
and they knew it was necessary that 
one of them be sacrificed by throwing
himself into the fire in order to become 
fire himself and fly into the sky.
The gods thought that the work of 
the sun was the most important, 
so they chose the most beautiful 
god so that he would fly into the fire 
and become the sun. But he was afraid. 
Then the smallest god, the one who was 
black, said he was not afraid and 
he threw himself into the fire and
became sun. 
Then the world had light and movement, 
and there was time for struggle and
time for love, and in the day the bodies 
worked to make the world and in the night
the bodies made love and sparkles filled 
the darkness.
This is what Old Man Antonio told us and 
that is why we use a black ski mask.
So we are of the color brown and of 
the color black. But we are also of the
color yellow, because the first people 
who walked these lands were made of
corn so they would be true. And we are 
also red because this is the call of blood
which has dignity and we are also blue 
because we are the sky in which we fly,
and green for the mountain which is our 
house and our strength. And we are white 
because we are paper so that tomorrow 
can write its story.
So we are 7 colors because there were 
7 first gods who birthed the world.
This is what Old Man Antonio said 
long ago and now I tell you this 
story so that you may understand 
the reason for this bridge of paper 
and ink which I send to you all the 
way from the mountains of the 
Mexican Southeast. And also so that 
you may understand that with this 
bridge goes pieces of salutes and
hugs for Leonard Peltier (who is in 
the prison at Leavenworth, Kansas), 
and for the more than 100 political 
prisoners in the USA who are the 
victims of injustice, stupidity and 
authoritarianism.
And with this letter-bridge walks 
as well a salute to the Dine (the Navajo),
who, in Big Mountain, Arizona, fight 
against the violations of their traditional 
Dine religious practices. They struggle 
against those who prefer the large 
businesses instead of respect for 
the religious freedom of Indian
peoples, and those who want to 
destroy sacred grounds and 
ceremonial sites (as is the case 
of Peabody Western Coal Company 
which wants to take lands without
reason, history or rights-lands 
which belong to the Dine and their 
future generations.)
But there are not only stories of 
resistance against North American 
injustice in this letter-bridge. 
There are the indigenous, from 
the extreme south of our continent, 
in Chile, the Mapuche women in the 
Pewenche Center of Alto Bio-Bio
who resist against stupidity. 
Two indigenous women, Bertha 
and Nicolasa Quintreman are accused 
of "mistreating" members of the 
armed forces of the Chilean 
government. So there it is. 
An armed military unit with 
rifles, sticks, and tear-gas,
protected by bulletproof vests, 
helmets and shields, accuse two 
indigenous women of "mistreatment". 
But Bertha is 74 years old and 
Nicolasa is 60. How is it possible 
that two elderly people confronted 
a "heroic" group of heavily-armed 
military? 
Because they are Mapuche. The story 
is the same as that of the brothers 
and sisters Dine of Arizona, and 
the same which repeats itself in 
all America: a company (ENDESA) 
wants the lands of the Mapuches, 
and in spite of the law which
protects the indigenous, the 
government is on the side of 
the companies. The Mapuche students 
have pointed out that the government 
and the company made a "study" of 
military intelligence about the 
indigenous Mapuche communities 
and they came to the conclusion 
that the Mapuche could not think, 
defend themselves, resist, or
construct a better future. The 
study was wrong apparently.
Now it occurs to me that, perhaps 
the powerful in North America carried 
out a "military intelligence" study 
(this is frankly a contradiction, 
because those of us who are military 
are not intelligent, if we were we 
would not be military) about the case 
of the Dine in Arizona, about Leonard 
Peltier, about other political 
prisoners, about yourself, mister 
Mumia. Perhaps they made this study 
and came to the conclusion that they 
might be able to violate justice and 
reason, to assault history and lose 
the truth. They thought they could 
do this and no one would say anything. 
The Dine Indians would stand by and 
watch the destruction of the most 
sacred of their history,
Leonard Peltier would be alone, and you, 
Mister Mumia, would be silenced (and I 
remember your own words "They not only 
want my death, they want my silence").
But the studies were wrong. Happy mistake? 
The Dine resist against those who would 
kill their memory, Leonard Peltier is 
accompanied by all those who demand
his liberty, and you sir, speak and 
yell today with all the voices which
celebrate your birthday as all birthdays 
should be celebrated, by struggling.
Mister Mumia:
We have nothing big to give you as a 
gift for your birthday, it is poor and
little, but all of us send you an embrace. 
We hope that when you gain your freedom 
you will come to visit us. 
Then we will give you a birthday party,
even if it isn't April 24th, 
it will be an unbirthday party.
There will be musicians, dancing and 
speaking, which are the means by which
men and women of all colors understand 
and know one another, and build bridges
over which they walk together, towards 
history, towards tomorrow.
Happy Birthday!

Vale. We salute you and may justice 
and truth find their place.
>From the mountains of the 
Mexican Southeast, 
Subcomandante Insurgente Marcos 
Mexico, April of 1999
P.S. I read somewhere that you are 
a father and a grandfather. 
So I am sending you a gift for your 
children and grandchildren. It is a 
little wooden car with Zapatistas 
dressed in black ski-masks. Tell your 
children and grandchildren that it is 
a gift that we send you, the Zapatistas. 
Explain to them places that there are 
people of all colors everywhere, just 
like you, who want justice, liberty 
and democracy for people of all colors.
