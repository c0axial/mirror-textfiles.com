"One time Dennis Eckersly let me tag along with him
and a couple other players for dinner. At the end of
the night, the check came, and I didn't want to let
it seem like I was trying to get a free ride. So I
asked up, "How much do I owe?" Eckersley looked up
at me and said, "Kid, did you just win the lottery??"
I said no. Then he said, "Well, then shut the fuck
up and never insult me like that again." I learned
that, basically, whoever makes the most money or has
had the most years of experience always picks up the
tab - otherwise it's an insult to him."

the June2000 GEAR magazine.

you hear it [bang,][bang,][bang,] here first.


Hi there, I'm prime anarchist and let me start by
saying, Dar Williams, you rokked my world last month.
I'm still not over you. Wow, and we didn't even do
anything. Go figure. Wow. 

Here's my column. I wrote it in one sitting a few
mornings ago. First thoughts upon first light. Wonder
what I was dreaming? Wonder what I ATE the nite before!
Ready?
  SOCIAL SECURITY IS NEITHER
     a column.
     by prime anarchist

Police state communism handed down as myth of capitalist
representative democracy.
  Brilliant.
  I haven't seen a better orchestrated scam since the
thirty dollar sand shark disguised as a scallop disguised
as a maco shark. Or was that a scallop disguised...?
  Sorry, too many decades since. I guess the Energy Crisis
was a doozy too.
  You know, I called this one when Gorbachev and Reagan
were pretending to continue the cold war arguments. But
I never allowed myself to think it through to its logical 
conclusions because I let everyone talk me into thinking
it was nothing more than a hallucinatory flaw-riddled,
hole infested conspiracy theory.
  A globalist communist police state imposed using
democracy as its veil. I'm impressed!
  Gore hides behind gun control while Bush teases him
about "Soilant Green."
  Mark my words, when some dark horse says s/he found a
great way to save paper, taxes, time, the environ AND
lives by having all economic transactions journalized
with a toothbrush looking thing waved over a computer
chip embedded near one of your wisdom teeth, look out.
  If Shrub Bush proposes it, run to the hills.
  And God forbid, if it comes from Tipper's hubby,
shoot yourself. Clip me first though, please. K?

This message is mostly for David Horowitz but really
it's for all of us.
  To what do you owe your grand metamorphosis you keep
harping on no matter what the topic is you're tackling
as TV's expert witness for ex-liberalism? The one you
see as left to right. The one you have so much pride over
and ownership for.
  I'd type the words, but they're already so eloquent in
the last 7 (seven) words to George Orwell's "1984."

> Hmm...]
Australia perhaps?  Spanish?  Do not forget that great
part of the mess we are enduring comes from the silly
belief old Spain had that they were supposed to run the
world... in the name of God, of course.  They got a big
chunk of land in that part of the world.  They claim to
own the Philippines.  Today, lots of very good and
decent Australians use Spanish as their own.

So, How in the heck have you been? 
  Do you remember holding previous conversations regarding
business and money making opportunities. I did not send
this to you in error! 
  You said: "If only I could find an easier way to make
a higher income" 
  And "If I had more money, I could spend more time with
my Family, and less time at work." 
  And [-no...]

Please e-mail me and I will send you a quote.
I will beat any price you have been given.
TRY ME !!!!

Please only send me songs that will make me cry.

Honoring state run communism. It's not just for breakfast

Taiwan. Expect a bloodbath. Expect a good economy for us.

/DREAM/ Faberge gets hired to put on some huge gala
this April 14th for Panamerica day.
  I'm famous for being famous and get asked what I
think. 
  "I hope one of his robots goes haywire and wreaks havoc
all up and down wallstreet. There's be rejoicing every
all around where."
  They want to know why I feel this way.
  "Economically this country has become one gigantically
horrible bootleg of its old self."

A Prime Anarchist Poem

My employment
Gave me no pleasure
A job gives no enjoyment?

My career
Taken under duress
I wonder what's the fear?

My life's work?
Definitely not my job.
Just what you daily do under a jerk.

My calling - from above...
On the other hand is singing
In and out of love.

    -falling





For everything you do,
This Christina Aguilera song's for you.







What sum R sayin' @ ATI

Just watch out at 4am, when you haven't slept in 24
hours, your eyes are 1/2 shut... You look at one of 
the ATi issues... And freak out because you have no
idea what you're reading! You're only aware that
something is making your mind spin at mach 5, and 
everything makes sense, but at the same time it 
doesn't! Am I even making sense?
