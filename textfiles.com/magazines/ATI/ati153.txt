It's Friday the 13th and (932 pm) this is your ATI.
The Annotated Television Index.

Tonite's Fugazi in Milwaukee and I'm missing it.
But that's OK. I get to hang out with my friends
in the factory tonite, where I'll get further tanked
on coffee, sage and tobacco,
and yeah...

   ...I'm Prime Anarchist and I'm your host 4 this

that aims to close down the School of The Americas.
More info is at http://www.soaw.org
If you can't come, keep those who are there 
(which may include me, thus breaking a self-imposed ban on 
activism) in your thoughts that weekend.

Greetings-
  Thought I'd let you know that you have the cherished rite 
to be the only hit on a search for 'www.theworks.org' that 
hotbot.com found.
   Seems from what I read that you have a past tie to some 
reincarnation/other life/misc of theworks.  Might be 
interesting, I volunteer for The Works, a tech center for kids 
in Minnesota.  As their part time weber, I'm a bit disappointed 
in the energy I have given their web presence.  Hope to expand,
then maybe submit it to get a little exposure.  But that might 
take away your claim to fame, which put me in contact with you.
    So just Hi for now, have a grand one- 
Larry (612)


Cool! 
Play it everywhere!!

  THE LIMITED: The Store.
  How "Limited" is it if every *&%$?#( mall in the world 
has one? And farthermore -- if it's in the mall in the first

  Can I paraphrase Fugazi?
  You are NOT what you own.
  You are not what you wear.
  You are not what you PURCHASE.
Wake up.
  I repeat: what you purchase is NOT YOU.

.....school of the americas vigil....
   Sunday, November 22, 1998, 1:30-2:30 
   United States Federal Bldg. Sidewalk,
(around the Mickey Leland Bldg., 1919 Smith)
On the morning of Sunday, Nov 22, 1998 and throughout
the day, thousands of marchers will be gathering in
Ft. Benning, Georgia, to protest the US Army School of 
the Americas. Graduates of the SOA have included some
of the worst human rights abusers and military strongmen 
who have been responsible for the torture, rape and murder
of the poor and oppressed of Latin America, church workers,
human rights workers, and US citizens. The Houston vigil 
is in support of this gathering.

HERITAGE OHMS, INC. UNVEILS Y2K PLAN.
(PAWN) -Alexandria, VA - In a ceremony involving Oliver Nord,
Taco Hell, and their sister company, ABC Strip Mall, Inc., 
Heritage Ohms CEO Richard Laredo displayed the official plan
for HxH2000, and he summed it up quite clearly and concisely
which surprised a crowd of 11,000 bureaucrats at the George
Bush Building auditorium.
   "Ladies and Germs," he began in true Carnegie-Roberts-Rules
form, then he switched style which threw all the forty-dollar-
a-cup-coffee-breakers, saying "a house between every other house  
by the year 2000; and then a house between every house again by
2004. Thank you, I'll now enterprise any questionings you may
have."
   There was a long pause and then a standing ovation.
   There were no questions and the bureaucrats are now returning
to their disrespective states or nations where they will begin
implementing the plan immediately.

FDR OKAYS HALLUCINOGENIC LOLLIPOP FOR TREATMENT OF GRUMPINESS.
by Washington Postal Correspondant, Sally Squares - special to
Prime Anarchist World News.
   Cancer patients and assorted other grumpy people will soon 
have a tastier way to treat bad mood: a raspberry-flavored 
lollipop that delivers a hallucination more potent than morphine.
The FDR, (food & drugs & rock-n-roll) approved Actiq (the shelf-
name for LSD-29) for patients experiencing sudden, "breakthrough"
downers that oral narcotics can't control.
   Actiq contains fentanyl citrate, which is delivered in a 
sugar-flavored lozenge held by an attached handle like a lollipop.
   People pregnant, or allergic to things like rat poison, 
HCL, or U-238 shouldn't touch the sugar cube part, only the handle.
   Because of potential for abuse of Actiq - (nicknamed cid) and its
dangers of appeal to children - the FDR required it's makers, Abbie
Laboratories, a subsidiary of the newly mergered Fizzer-Squibly, to 
give their word of honor they won't use any Mickey Mouse, Grateful
Dead or Ben & Jerry's logos on Actiq.
   The most interesting side effects include dizziness, nausea,
constipation and good vibrations.
   Doctors will be fully briefed and must agree to only dispense
to people who are already on drugs. Patients' families will be 
warned about side effects; which colors are fresh and which are
stale; and one relative must provide a "come-down" tent within two
miles of all Actiq consumption.
   For patients allergic to sugar, Fizzer-Squibly can provide squares
on little light blue sheets of paper, which comes with a free pair 
of FDR scissors with William Benet's picture on the handle.
   See your doctor for details or your pharmacist for the over-the-
counter versions.
   <small> Not to be taken with Viagra, Testosterones 
or Test Free, Fizzer-Squibly not responsible for misuse. 
Calls are just $35 a minute. Operators are standing by. 
Relatives of hippies not allowed to enter. Limit 4 doses 
per customer. Some settling, set and setting may occur. </small>

ELECTROLUCKS RECALL
(PAWN) - Genesis, LX - If you own a Prolucks, Regency, Genesis or
Electrolucks vacuum cleaner, makers are urging you not to turn it
on again until after you've either called 
1-888-877-2959 or hit their web page at
http://www.elux.com
   The company will fix it free, but will not be held responsible
for people who get sucked into the tube; if they didn't call to 
get the power turned down.
   The part that is called a ponytail is also in danger of getting
sucked into the tube and it will peel off all the shielding around
the wires - which completes the circuit and will electrocute 15 
people in the community, reformat your hard drive and scramble any
floppies near your computer. In the event of 15 people dead, 
Electrolucks, L.L.C. will put new rubber shielding on the wiring
at no cost to the consumer. But again, you must call the 800# 
or hit their webpage.

       POOR CRAP MEANS HIGHER PRICES
-- ------- ------
by Malvina Morris   Special to Prime Anarchist World News
-- ------- ------
Houston_____Cocoa Cola Company's Minute Made division, the 
"number two" juice maker, said it will raise prices for its
raisin juices, orange juices and walnut juices an average of
8 to 10 percent early next week because of smaller shipments
of fertilizer.
   "Lousy and less," said Miles Standing, chief executrix in
charge of executing chiefly. "Look at this lousy loam," he said
showing a finger full. "How does one expect us to live on loam
like this?" He said had they known they'd receive so little, so
late and so lousy, they would've put a call in to Luvett Butter
in Luck, Wisconsin.
   "They have the most best fertilizer in the world," he lamented,
we sure could've used their soil this year."
   Not one to look back, Standing said the increase means retail
prices will climb 20 cents for 64-ounce cartons of its top-selling
Minute Made Naranjugo. In the rest of the country retail prices
will level at 30 cents more a liter.
   "The walnut juice and raisin juices will taste simply 
horrible," said Standing. He said they'll likely have to lower
those prices and just live with a loss.
   "Losing means never having to say you're Lipton."

          School of Assassins

     1995 Academy Award Nominee
          (ahora en espan`ol)
          Maryknoll World Productions
     Do you know that a US taxpayer foots 
     the bill for a school on US soil which
     graduated some of the worst human rights 
     violators in the hemisphere? Since it was
     established in 1946, the US Army School of
     The Americas has trained thousands of Latin
     American soldiers. Using rarely seen footage,
     the program shows how officers who studied at
     the school  are responsible  for the deaths of  
     thousands of people.  This award-winning  video 
     has sold over 10,000 copies.

An aside: Pinochet was NOT trained at SOA. 47 of the
51 people directly under him WERE!!! Pinochet did NOT
kill Victor Jara, the famous folksinger and composer
of ballets. Two of his close friends DID!!! Sound like
anyone you know?


As is usual, the case (both upper and lower) we end with
a poetry.

This is called AWAY
     by marco capelli

The wind has a way of 
Putting everyone's weapons
Away.
The disarming wind.
Have you seen it wild enough?
Wonderful.
Weapons waiver.
I see everyone's lawn furniture
Walking up or down
Many a city block.

The wind.
Everyones leaves are shaken loose.
Loose and away.
