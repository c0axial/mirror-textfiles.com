Hi there,
Prime here, so don't go anywhere.
I've got a book recommendation to
pass along to you.
"TRANCE Formation Of America,"
by some guy named Mark.
I haven't read it yet. And it's 
probably 19th or so on my list. Anyone
with time AND money at the same time 
wanna write up a review of the thing
to help me speed things along? I'm told
it's a very "pertinent" one.
   Let's see, what do we have this week?
Some numbers, some letters a couple poems,
and assorted others. Overall a good week.
   Oh yeah, the "george" is in the headlight
to the motorcycle this week. In case any of
you didn't get it.
   On to it, peeps...

Dr. Anarchist, I don't want you to be insulted that
I chose not to read this book. I understand that you
must work within a finite allocation of time. This
will sometimes necessitate schedule changes. I 
realize that you needed to move the quiz date up in
order to facilitate later class hours. I appreciate
the situation and wish only that my schedule was
flexible enough to accomadate that change. It wasn't.
I understand that my grade is the victim and it 
doesn't matter all that much to you whether or not
I read. I just want you to know that I hold no
malice toward you and hope that the next reading
assignment will be more easily fulfillable.

The Uphill Playing Field
  a poem
     By prime anarchist

Judge Sabo's court says,
"We'll GIVE you the KILLing floor."

LW asks for - begs for,
Just a little more.

Sabo says, "What?"
"We've GIVEN you the floor."

Justice, LW says, is all he would demand.
Just Us says Sabo, pre-penned penalty in hand.

Moses dead, Jesus forgotten, Jefferson nowhere to be found,
In walks Elijah saying quietly,"

But ever so firmly,
Let my fucking people go.

to the tune of the Johnny Rivers song.

There's a man who wansa be president.

Thinks his rights as Skull&Bones are heaven sent.

But there's this book that shows
   Am                 (Em)
He stepped on a lotta toes
Em                Am     Em
Odds are he'll be leader anyway.

    Belgium Hacker: Weather Controlled 
          Pepsi Prices Not New.
   "How long are you Amerikans going to have your 
heads in the sand," says Light Knight, a phreaker
who submitted this piece to PAWN Thursday.
ATLANTA -- Soft-drink makers such as Coca-Cola are
studying "smart" vending machines that would allow
them to raise prices by remote control when it's 
hot outside, and cut prices when business is slow.
   Mr. Anarchist, that's complete bullshit. Coke
and Pepsi have had their soda machines online for
three years now out here and let me tell you they've
been controlling more than the weather.
   Our people in general hate it, but of course we
hackers and phreakers love it. We can hack into a
mainframe and tell the thing it's 4 below zero in 
any given town, then go to the machine and buy a 
Pepsi for seventeen-cents.
   Then go back to the laptop and dial it in saying
it's 85 degrees out and watch the next guy pay a
buck-twenty. It's really funny watching the look
on someone's face when they buy two, and their 
first one is a 50c and their second one is a buck-
forty!
   You people have no idea what's going on in 
your own country, never mind the rest of the world.
   Coke has been able to do this for a long time.
Just like the phone company, they're unveilling 
this ever so slow because they're downright 
paranoid they'll lose your slavish support.
   That's why in your papers you have to suffer
Coke "investigating possiblities," and Pepsico
saying "we're not sure if it's a good idea,"
when they know damned well they're going to do
this to you in 5 or 6 months!
   Of course they are. They've been all over the
world like DDT for years. And they're "ontheway-
toyourhouse." I just thought you should know.

Poetical Ending:

JARA OR BAEZ: A Letter "Home."
    by Marc Harry Ehrenfrucht
  dedicated to the Vanguard recording:
  "Farewell, Angelina"

I'm in the city, but the country is near.
Sometimes the river or the rain
Smells like people feces.
They say it's the mill upstream.

I haven't any goats, Joan. But there's 
Plenty of brussels sprouts to last...
Til me and the turtles and the 
deer are done devourin' them.

I root for the same storm you do -
I know it's on it's way,
Just a matter of when...

Lord Buckley's not nearly as profound
As he used to be. Nor relevant!
But it didn't embarrass me much, 
I love him, I love you, I love myself 
And I even love Jesus. I love  

Everyone.

It was hard to get to that space,
You put me there finally, but you had 
Help, didn't you?
You've taken bigger risks than writing
about Jesus, Angelina! Your voice, your
guitar, your life. Wow, what can I say?

I honor you. I adore you. I thank you,
In ways I can't even describe. 

Jesus knows what's happening on earth
these days, let me be the next to assure
you, he sure knows. And sometimes I pray
hard all night long that he'd march
right up here from Chiapas and kick our
Asses.

"Because here we are, waiting on the eve of
Destruction with all the odds against any of us
Living to see the sun rise one day soon."

I'll help you bring up the sun when it's
Tomorrow.

Angelina, would it embarrass you very much
if I were to tell you... that I've loved
you since I was nine years old?
