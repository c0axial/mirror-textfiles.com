   May 19, 2000. The day the kangaroo
   came into the court moon.

Dedication: Michele Baloden, Clara M, Michael,
Roy Rogers trail mix, a dog named Rena, Dave,
Laura N., Karla, Peter T, Bob G., Emily (for
the asparagus in balsamic!) Roy B., Martin E.,
and you!

  Imagine wind blowing like a socket around your
skull.
  It was important that somewhere between age 6 and
16 each child must lose all their creativity, spunk,
basically their humanity.  That's why we worked with
Dell.* 
  Pick your corporate entity. How many big macs do
you have left if you eat 3! TWA 1964 - let's fly to
stereotypeland.
  Greetings,
You might already know by now that every full moon
we here at ATI try to write all or most of this rant
on a Trash-80 model 100 laptop, outside under the
stars. Then we null modem it into a 386 with a 3.5
a drive and then it's ready for markup on bigger
machines. 
  Well today is no exception.
  'cept I can't see the stars because it's 710 pm my
time. Wait, there's Michael Bolton, that yutz. OK,
some of the stars, but definitely the less (or more???)
nebulous ones.
  Well, what else should I write about tonite besides
the full moon? Well, there's the fact that I've been
using the word "well," far too often lately.
Perhaps trying too desperately to sound deep?
  Well, let's see, there's Rudolph and his eight tiny
yaks, stepping down and handing Hillary perhaps her
easiest conquest of her adulthood. Unless of course,
you count bedding the hottest youngest, hippiest law
prof at Yale those many years ago, back when that was
the cool thing to do, why they almost even made her
an honorary she-member of Skull/Bones. Was that her
conquest or Bill's? No one's talking.
  Then there's a bunch of new laws passing in congress
that no one understands yet. Not even the people who
penned them. What's up with that??? Look out. This is
fixin' to be some interesting decades ahead of us.
No more "me"  generation, eh? Should we call this 1 the
yak generation? The Hak? Or the gen hex? Or how about
the lovebug decade?
  There's something sublime about living in a country
where one of our recently assassinated presidents
would have had his 83'd birthday May 29th. He was our
youngest president so far too.
  Well, what were YOU doing last millenium? I was still
in diapers.
  Calgon, take me away! I wanna get my hair conked, I
wanna eat grapes again. I wanna get my kicks before this
whole spitfire grill goes up in flamewarz.
  Can you play Jacobson's Golden Tee '99 Golf in a bar
without forearm smashing or heeling the screen with your
right hand after every drive? Especially the ones that 
hook? Can you? 
  Well can you?
  Five people in a row last nite, couldn't. Betcha can't.
  Leather pants are making another comeback. I don't
remember being bothered by each of the other leather
renaissances, but you know what? This time it just looks
downright strange. Weird? A little contrived? Especially
in the summer time, eh?
  Imagine buying a rottweiler, naming him Satan, teaching
him to guard your house because you've been robbed three
times since a year ago, and coming home from work to find
out someone stole him? Happened in England last week, swear.
  Had I smoked "Thai Stick" many a time in the 80's, would
it really have been hooch laced with opium derivatives? Oh
boy, here we go again. 
  Your two main choices this election are 4 more years,
versus 4 more wars. And what if you want both? Vote.
  I bought Peter Tosh's "Mystic Man" on vinyl in a used
record store the other day, and reaching inside, was given
the strange pleasant surprise of something else instead of
Tosh in there. Dr. Dream's "Don't Mean Maybe." 8 songs on
side 1; 9 songs on side 2. Great, thanks, but where's my
Peter Tosh??  
  Well, I'm prime anarchist, and I wrote that.

#'s? U wan' numbers?

OPEN LETTER TO NINJABOY:
and anyone else within earshot,
you'd asked about other forums for a-16
type stuff, I recommend you go to
http://www.freespeech.org and view one
or all of the three clips about Jenene
Garofolo playing Anita Hoffman in the
  "soon to be a major motion picture"
"Steal this Movie." Then after each movie
it suggests you participate in any of half
a dozen forums. Take your pick. I didn't
see one about that movie, so you'd have to
start your own thread, but there were three
or four pretty charged up a-16 ones. I'll be
of course starting an anti-SOA one
because that issue is so dear to my heart,
but may I rant for a second? Thanks.

IT'S THE SAME FRIGGING ISSUE

BIRMINGHAM AND NASHVILLE,
AND IT'S THE SAME REASON
THERE'S ABOUT TO BE 40
FRIGGIN DAYS IN WASHINGTON
DC ON THE TOPIC OF "A
CULTURE OF NON-VIOLENCE."

Thnx. oh, and did I leave out it's also
the same issue as to why a huge coalition
of old ladies marched on the capitol in
the 1880's or 90's.

Peeps, I want revolution just as much as
the next peep; but I also want it to
all come down in such a way that we
don't harm too many of the plants and
animals around us. There's the rub isn't it?

Here's to non-violence or non-existence.

A DREAM

I had this dream I thought you were there
Jumping from star to star
And sitting on Saturns ring
Is where you'll find this Queen & King
Traveling and sliding down the Milky Way
A sun ray shining on a golden desert
On a sunny summer day

Feeling trapped like a mermaid 
But on earth  from space
Knowing from dreams there is a better place
Dancing with the trees and the bees 
In this RAVEN madness
Trying to deal with things through this 
And keep away from sadness

A butterfly waiting to come out to fly as high  
As it can go and SHOUT
Shout through creativity to open up the doors 
Of time so people wont be blind
And when this puzzles complete by me
I will have the key 
To do and be what i want to be
And than i woke up
was it a dream,was it a dream, was it a dream,was it a
    dream???
    OR IS THIS MY REALITY

ON SOME ROADS
  A Saga
  by Aaron Kreider (Continued from last
  issue. The "Season Finale")
   [ If you wanna read the whole thing
        as one long t-phile goto:
http://www.etext.org/Zines/ASCII/ATI/trilogy ]              

05.22
Next morning (perhaps around 9:30am) I wandered down to the highway and
fairly quickly got a ride (within half an hour or so).   I was very
fortunate to find a truck driver going to Portland!  All the way to the
west coast, though a little south of where I wanted.  He was from England,
had travelled around Australia, Canada, and was now staying in the US.  He
became a truck driver last September when he lost a lucrative power-line
(maintenance?) contract.  Since he needed more money to support his EIGHT
kids, he was training to be a helicopter pilot.  He picked me up because he
was a Christian (relatively morally conservative one) and he said that.
Maybe too because he'd also wandered around.  He wanted to move out from
Wisconsin to North Dakota or Montana and really liked the mountains.
Unlike other drivers, he was athletic and was planning on going on a good
jog once he reached Portland.  He even had a little barbell weight to lift
with one of his arms while driving.  By 2:37 p.m. (or 1:37 as the time
changed somewhere in mid North Dakota) I was at N 46 16.153 W 106 18.349,
part way into Montana.  By 6:57pm (I've now switched to central time) I was
at N 45 45.845  W 111 11.164 a little bit before Butte where we spent the
night.  I ate more snack food (granola, chocolate chip sesame (seed and
oil) chopped walnut applesauce coconut maple sugar clear the fridge special
cookies, dried apricots, raisins, and that was about it!). We both really
enjoyed the mountains and the great views!  We went to sleep just around
sunset.  I had a little trouble getting to sleep (hey it was only 8 or 9pm)
but managed to do so.  We slept at a truck stop where the restrooms were
closed and where for about 20+ minutes a number of young women held a small
dance (several truckers honked at them).  Quite strange.

05.23
Next morning at 8:07am we were at N 46 52.474  W 113 53.299 in Missoula.
By 12:55 (or now 11:55 pacific time) I was in Spokane, WA at N 47 35.676  W
117 29.832.  I decided to get off there since it was a bigger looking town
(on the map) then anything else near the split where my driver was going
south to Portland whereas I wanted to keep on trucking (unintended pun) to
Seattle.  So I got off at the second truck stop on the west side of the
city.  There I hitched near the interstate entrance, by a telephone post
that had a LOT of hitchhiker graffiti.  Mostly complaining about how lousy
the spot was.  Someone had hitched from Kentucky and engraved that.  This
was the only hitch-hiking graffiti I'd seen all trip.  While riding, I saw
a couple hitch-hikers, but never met anyone. There was a nearby police
station and a no-hitch-hiking sign nearby and a cop car or two passed, but
didn't bother me.  It was also right near Spokane's airport, so there was a
LOT of traffic.  The pull-over area was pretty bad.  I think it took me
about two hours to get a ride.  Maybe less.  The surprise was that I got a
ride from a woman about my age (first woman driver and only one of the nine
rides).  She was a little abnormal, but in the good (non-dangerous) sense
(unlike the first driver who seemed like he could be dangerous - perhaps
when drunk).  This was the first hitch-hiker she'd ever picked up, and I
warned her that hitch-hikers were dangerous and that she shouldn't pick us
up!  She was thinking that she'd hitch sometime and would want to get
picked up.  I also persuaded her as to the merits of train hopping.  She'd
just got back from a month or so backpacking around Europe (alone - but had
met people) and showed me pictures of that.  I played a song or three on
the harmonica for general amusement (I'd brought an harmonica which was a
very good idea since you can play it with one hand while you use your other
to thumb a ride - gives you something to do).  She was a moderately
neurotic driver, focussing as she said on the 'big picture'.  As a result
we would often be going the speed limit (or even less) in the left lane and
get passed by a lot of cars on the right.  She didn't like driving alone
(another reason she picked me up).  We stopped off at a grocery store in
Ellensburg to break the monotony of the ride, and because she wanted
strawberries.  I got a grapefruit and two kiwis (Mmm, though the kiwi was
far too sour and eating grapefruit in a moving vehicle is a messy process),
for less than a dollar.  We also stopped off by the Columbia River which
flows in a canyon and the area was very scenic.  She took my picture there
(hope it and the other seven or so pictures turn out!).  And saw some
horses.  I forget their exact name but someone either carved them out of
stone or wood and they can be seen from the highway.  I called my parents
from a gas station to see if they knew anywhere I could stay in Seattle in
case I didn't get a ride that night to Vancouver.  They offered to pick me
up, and I, a bit tired from the vagaries of hitching a couple thousand
miles, accepted and arranged to meet them in Issaquah.  By 6:08 p.m.
Pacific time in N 47 32.323  W 122 02.227, my driver let off by Issaquah,
WA.  I walked around the town (I did this in a couple towns, especially
during the Greyhound return trip when I spent 75 hours going from Vancouver
to Philadelphia!).  A nice place.   Very very green.  I read some of my
"Canadian Revolution" book and eventually got picked up, hit a Denny's on
the way home (I ate curly fries) and then crashed in Vancouver.  End of
story.  Or is it?

Finally I'd reached home.  AKA N 49 14.629  W 123 11.804 (taken from my room)

Conclusion
Having packed all my food before, I spent around $3.50 on the trip (mostly
on cold pop and the dollar for the tramp).  So it's very cheap if you have
the equipment (large backpack, sleeping bag, map).  I hitched about 2300
miles in 4.5 days.  If you got lucky and tried to get rides at night
(instead of sleeping) you could do it in less.  It's more fun and
comfortable than taking Greyhound, though slower as you don't go non-stop
(sometimes Greyhound will let you travel anywhere for $59 one-way - which
is a really good deal if you have a good book and are ok riding buses).
I've heard that hitch-hiking in the South is not a good idea (police), and
that for women it's very easy to get a ride but you should be extremely
selective.  All of the people who gave me rides were very nice, though
perhaps the first guy wasn't the safest person.  It's nice to know that
there are people in America who will go out of there way to help total
strangers (drivers are known to drive out of their way to drop you off -
the first guy did this a bit).

A PAWN PRESS RELEASE
For Immediate Perusal.
1-800-anarchist ext. WRLDNWZ
for more info.

  ==Nasty New Worm Proliferates==  
The CDC (center for distress control)
has issued an advisory that a viral
pneumo-worm has finally been released.
This strain is much more obnoxious
than happy95, unhappy99 and even the
herbalthelovebug virus that attacks
address books.
  Explaining the process is Captain
Dreadnaught, a security analyst at
Computational Computer Computing,
Incorporated, a think-tank in
Alexander, Virginuous.
  "Well, basically what it does is
sets a cookie crumb into your hard
drive if you're using version 48.9
of Winthose2000. And the minute you
open up your Inert Exploder browser,
it changes all your bookmarks to sites
like http://www.softpinkxxxgrlz.com, 
http://www.touchmymonkey.netor 
http://www.havean.org/asmic/time.html
This gets people in a lot of trouble
with spouses, parents, children, local
law enforcement and sometimes even
makes their ISPs mad at them."
  Dreadnaught went on to say this 
virus is not harmful in any other way,
that's why his thinktank is using the
words "obnoxious" rather than "danger"
as you are in no particular danger
other than having your whole mind 
[expletive]'d with.
  CCCI recommends you clean out your
bookmarks file, cache and favorites
after every session if you know anyone
"faint of heart." Floss twice daily,
don't buy Worldbank bonds, and as per
usual, says the CCCI, people with diabetes
should never order the white bread at any
Subway counterfood Sandwich Shops.



HOW DO YOU FEEL
 a prose poem
My job this life is to comfort the afflicted,
and afflict the comfy.
  If you don't notice that my "salary" is bigger
than yours, I'll betcha you're looking through
the wrong set of eyes.
  If you can recognize how fulfilling it is being
the "poorest" in your hood, then those are the
ones. The right set of eyes, how do you feel?
  You work so hard at keeping me from seeing God
in you, but I see through all that and recognize
you anyhow.
  Are they paying you enough for that?
  Can you see me? 


And now, A PRIME ANARCHIST OPINION.
  PAO, RIGHT IN THE "TOOKHUS."
  Clinton's solution to all these dead and dying
police officers is legislation toward 90,000 more
bullet proof vests. A kevlar around every kop.
  You know Bill, you're going about it all wrong.
Missing the point by just a degree or two. If
you're going to keep militarizing every single
thing around you why don't you save all that $$$
and just issue free cocaine, LSD and PCP for every
law enforcement officer, so each can kill a couple
extra people before dying. Bullets forward for ten
more minutes after he himself dies.
  Hell, it worked for German Shephards, Rottweilers,
Dobermans and Pitbulls until they were too inbred
to survive up to capacity.
  So what if it kind of didn't work as well on 
infantrymen. Kind of backfired, turned 'em all into
pacifists, singing "I Saw The Light," "We Shall 
Overcome," and "I Ain't A Marchin' Anymore."
  Well, cops are a different breed of animal entirely.
Well, different from soldiers, Billy. But you wouldn't
know, eh?
  They all look the same, right?



A SHORT NEWS SHORT.
  from Lakota Nation Journal - Late April issue

  The Navajo group sold 2,500 traditional Navajo meals
of coffee, frybread and mutton stew to pay for their
trip to Washington, said member Sarah Benally of Delores,
Colo.
  Benally, whose uranium miner father died of a lung ailment
but could not be compensated under the current law, has
been lobbying Congress on the issue since the 1970's.
