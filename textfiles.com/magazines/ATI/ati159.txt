"The TV business is uglier than most things. It is normally 
perceived as some kind of cruel and shallow money trench 
through the heart of the journalism industry, a long plastic 
hallway where thieves and pimps run free and good men die 
like dogs, for no good reason."
   --Thompson, H.S. from 
     "Generation of Swine," p43

"If the shameful acts of the Mexican political class are 
merchandise for the powerful communications media, and whose
successful presentation is measured in "rating" points, for
the immense majority of those who struggle and die between
the Rio Bravo and the Suchiate, they are only a continuation
of the state crime which spans almost the entire century."

On VH-1 popup videos Tuesday, running in the Debbie Gibson 
segment, rather than say that in '89 Mojo Nixon wrote a song 
about Debbie, the writers chose to say "In 1989, a folksinger 
wrote a song about Debbie called, Debbie Gibson is Pregnant 
with my Two Headed Love-Child."
   It is my opinion that General Electric's MTV 10-year-old 
ban on Mojo Nixon has been taken to a terrible new level 
which is practically an act of war.
   I call on Mojo Nixon and all of his fans and supporters 
to go ahead and begin verbally assaulting MTV/VH-1, NBC 
and thereby Viacom and General Electric as an 
act of self-defense for Mr. Mojo "a folksinger" Nixon.
Signed,
Marco Capelli

Marc,
Well I didn't mean to not respond to your justified 
morale outrage.  But a strange thing happened to me 
when I got up that morning.  I just didn't care.
  It wasn't that bombing the shit out of innocent civilians 
and not so innocent meglomaniacs doesn't impinge on my 
tattered consciousness.  Its just that I don't care.
  I think I'm a victim.  A victim of media overhype 
and underhandedness. Where live shots from the nose 
of a cruise missille are met with the same ho hum that 
I watch the latest Dawn commercial.
  I mean come on.  The special effects are very lacking.  
The resolution in low grade VHS, and the reporters have 
absolutely no blood on them.  Where's my damn Play Station 
anyway.  Get me another donut.
  I don't know.
  Its sad.  It really is.
  I think Saddam is a sadistic creep that wouldn't hesitate 
to rip the arms off my kids while his soldiers raped my wife.  
But all that said it just doesn't matter.  He's there.  
I'm here.  Its a techno war and its more real then 'Nam and 
therefore less real to me.
  When my car blows up on the way to work one day I'll be shocked.  
And if I survive I'll be pissed off.  But then, I'll probably 
care even less if things get back to normal quickly.
  Ever see the movie Brazil and the random acts of terrorism???  
You'll know what I mean.
  Sorry Marco.  I mean't to respond.  
  I just got tired....
...and that's what they're all counting on.

(and about our webpages... wink, wink...)
I look forward to seeing what you've done with this 
in a couple of months, looks good so far.  I will 
definately link to  soaw.org.  I don't usually spend 
so much time examining the links that people put on
their sites. yours I am looking at closely. When I 
put some time into my site I may link to this one. 
Mine became drudgery, I like the aproach you state here.
   Thanks,

Hey, thanks, I'll take these to work with me 
tomorrow and read 'em. I have a web page 
if you wanna check out some of my stuff:

Otherwise send me a snail address and 
I'll send you a sample issue.
Take care,

Everyone's an asshole. Especially me.


You hit it right on the nail there. I always carry around a copy of 
"A Moment for the Dead" by Lance Morrow that appeared in TIME in 1991.
It was the most sensible thing I read about the Gulf War.
I get tired of the news. It's not fair, it's not right...it sickens me.
I always think of that escaped prisoner from Texas, how all we saw was 
the police version of events, and news. And I thought, maybe that guy 
has something to say that no one ever heard. And now the silence is 
forever.

The Other Side of the Mountain
   a song

for staci  11/98

There's a place you can go       C G7
It'll cost you less              C
You can keep your toes           G7
You can slow it down             C  G7

There's a place you can be 
You can always see
To the other side 
For free, it's free, for free.

  ch- Lemme tell you                    C
  It's the other side of the mountain   F G
  Turquoise, silver and a spring        C F G
  Lemme tell you                        C
  Over there you'll find a fountain     F G
  With a pebble and a ring.               C

Musik
Is a man up there
He knows more than you
'Cause he's up there, up there.

Have you been there
I been half way there
And then half way more
I could see there from there.

TERROR IN THE SKIES
[a song]      From: DRovics@aol.com
Date: Fri, 18 Dec 1998 12:23:56 EST
FWD  please post far and wide

Night-time comes and everybody wonders
Will tomorrow bring the light of day
Will our house be rubble blown asunder
In the cellar we will hide ourselves and pray

Will the smoke clear in the morning?
Will the city all go down in flame?
Will the factory be standing?
Will life here ever be the same?

(chorus)
There's terror in the skies of this city
Fear is in the hearts of children, women and men
And you never see the faces of the killers
As the smart bombs fall again

Will there be a job for me to go to?
Will there be food upon my plate?
After many, many years of hungry sanctions
What did my child do to earn this fate?  (chorus)

The Yankees talk of Gaza and of Algiers
They wring their hands when Irish shoppers die
But if you want to know a life of terror
Look up at night into the Baghdad sky  (chorus)

HAPPY NU Y'EAR 2 U!

To Cole Porter's "Don't Fence Me In."

Oh give me land, lots of land under starry skies above,
Don't sell this song.
Let me ride thru the wide open country that I love,
Don't sell this song.

Let me be by myself in the evening breeze
Listen to the murmer of the cottonwood trees
Send me off forever 
But I ask you please
Don't sell this song.

Just leave me 'lone
let me sit in front of TV without havin' t' hear your lies.
On my phone or my modem let me live without 
		    a jingle... teasin' my eyes.
I wanna live life without violence to art
Go about my business without a cold soldout heart
Can't see good music used for verbal farts

Don't fence me in!
