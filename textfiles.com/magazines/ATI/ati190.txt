Greeting2u, and welcome 2 ATI 190.
Heyoka moon is upon us. The half one.
I almost got eaten by a cougar last night.
It was wonderful. I'll tell you about it
some day. Let me stop vibrating first though.
Gimme a week or two. As you see up top, I've
dedicated this entire issue to journalist
Allan Nairn who sits in a jail cell near 
Jakarta, for what? His only crime in this 
world I feel, is upholding his journalistic
ethics and plodding along standing up for
what's right. Umm. Where have we heard this
before? Tune in each week when we list three 
or four new casualties of the war on the
FIrST amMENdMENt of the US Constipation. 
And internationally? Just plain simple!
The war on human rights. The one my 
government is almost as complicitous in, as
all the other bad "evil" "ucky" nation-
states out there.
   I'm prime anarchist and this is the #'s
run for ATI190 this half-moon sunday, 420pm SST,
spentral stranded time.

TO ALL CONCERNED
On Saturday and Sunday, 2-3 October 1999, 
an international demonstration will take 
place in Sweden, England, and the United 
States east and west coasts. Demonstrators 
from other nations are expected to participate, 
as well. This will be a peaceful demonstration 
to protest the ethnic cleansing and human rights 
violations being committed by the United States 
government within its own borders.
   The Southeastern Native American Alliance (SENAA) 
is now organizing a protest demonstration to protest 
the human rights violations and attempted genocide 
of the Dine'h people at Big Mountain, Black Mesa,
Arizona. We will hold simultaneous demonstrations 
in front of the United Nations building in New 
York City; in front of the White House and Capitol 
Building in Washington, DC; and at two locations 
on the U.S. Pacific coast. In England and Sweden, 
at the same time as U.S. demonstrations, protests 
will be held in front of the U.S. embassies in 
those countries. On the nights of the 2nd and 3rd, 
candlelight prayer vigils will be held to invoke 
Creator's power to help the Dine'h--to help us all.
   If you have seen the video, "VANISHING PRAYER 
Genocide of the Dine," that SENAA currently has 
on http://www.freespeech.org/senaa , then you
have some idea why SENAA has organized this 
protest demonstration. If you wish to know more, 
or are unfamiliar with the ordeal that the Dine'h
(Navajo) people are facing and the impact that it 
can have on every living American citizen, 
SENAA urges you to visit its web site
Newsletter at:
http://members.xoom.com/senaa/index2.html
    Thank you for taking the time to read this 
letter. Thank you in advance to those of you 
who decide to join this demonstration. We need
your help in NYC, DC, in Los Angeles, Netherlands,
England, Sweden, or wherever in the world you plan 
to participate in this demonstration.
Sincerely yours
Al Swilling
SENAA President/Founder

I end my ranticle with Guitar Anarchy Tip #10

Muffle the thing for all your nite-time wailing. 
   Cut a strip of suede about five inches long by
half an inch wide. 16th inch thick? I just use
scraps I find. I'm vegetarian. (Not vegan, get
off me!) 
   Put it on a guitar you'd like to use for 3am
scales playing. I guarantee you'll be the only one
who hears it, and you won't need bridgework for 
an extra year of so on that machine! The thinner
the piece of suede (I haven't tried harder cuts
yet, like raw hide, I'll tell you how I fare as
I go) the less you'll "fret" over intonation
changes.

Taxpayer as Restaurant Owner.
   by prime anarchist

Remember last year's election highbrow bruhaha
about honoraria and campaign contributions?
  I don't see any of that as morally wrong per se,
just a major conflict of interest.
  Let's see what we can dredge up for these 
upcoming primaries, huh? How about a slightly new
paradigm?? Politician-hopeful-elect A (we'll call
him or her "pea," the "h" is silent) is given two
choices:
   1) Current wage at taxpayer expense. No extras,
no honoraria, no campaign contributions.
   2) Waitress wage at taxpayer expense. (yes, not
even 3 bucks per hour) pea is allowed to drudge up
all the extras s/he can get of his or her own 
gumption.
   Waddya think?

You turn around and look me

You look at your son;

Back and forth between him and me.
You go back to pee'ing in your own

   SHORT MOVIE REVIEW

Have you seen "White Trash Girl?"
  One factual inconsistr'hood'ncy
I feel I ought mention.
  Prior to urinating all over a
potential rapist, our protagonist
peels off her hat and parka. Throws
them to the pavement.
   The scene after her peeing all
over the putz has her walking down
a different street wearing the same
parka and hat. (looks like she's
pimpin' but we won't go there...)
   Now, this is a cobblestreet
looking like Providence or Paris.
   Would she be able to simply
march on back there pronto and pluck 
up her parka and hat off the pavement?
   Possible, but so highly unlikely
that it slowed down my suspension of
disbelief enough to make me ponder 
the purity of this play.
   Peculiar.
   Other than that? Potent, great,
powerful, thought provoking stuff.
   Wow.

Ode To Pie

    retains all rights.

{Eat pie!}
Sweet and salty, wet and dry.
There's no taste quite as fine as pie.
Fresh at home or on the road,
I'll take my slice a la mode.
Apple, berry, chocolate, cherry,
Bring me pie, and please hurry.
I can't wait to clean my plate
So I can taste that pie, so great!
But what if I'm full,
That would be the worst...
Maybe I'll have my pie first!

OPEN LETTER TO RETAIL STORES

I don't believe you should have a website
on your own domain (especially one you 
advertise on obligatory employee t-shirts

process of offering those employees free
email and perhaps personal webspace.
   Thank you and have a nice day.

Rosa P. 
   Another prime anarchist poem.

Sometimes choosing where you'll be
Is a very big thing.
Can cause so much to happen.
Cause big things to happen.

Often picking where to sit.
Is a very small step.
That sets a wider light aglow.
Sets a bigger light a glow.

Many times a movement
Is a very new thing
Can cause a sitting soul to stir.
Causes a big ol' soul to move.

Sometimes choosing where we'll go
Is bigger than us all.
Sitting, sitting holds us all up to see
Sitting, sitting lights us up, sets us,
Sets us up to see.

WE END THIS 'EZINE WITH ALLAN NAIRN'S
STATEMENT TO HIS INDONESIAN CAPTORS

     I know that the army has put me on the black list. 
They did this because I watched their soldiers murder more
than 271 people at the Santa Cruz cemetery. This 
crime was the responsibility of the Indonesian army
commander, General Try Sutrisno and the Minister of Defense, 
General Benny Murdani.
     The murders were committed with American M-16 rifles. 
The American government also bears some of the responsibility 
because they have armed, trained, and given money to the 
TNI/ABRI, even though they knew the TNI/ABRI is led by 
murderers and is responsible for the deaths of hundreds 
of thousands of Timorese, Acehnese, West Papuan and 
Indonesian civilians.
     Because I survived the massacre and denounced the 
crime to the outside world, the TNI/ABRI and the Suharto
government banned me as a "threat to national security." 
That ban has been reaffirmed by each subsequent TNI/ABRI 
commander, including General Tanjung and General Wiranto.
     I do not think that I am a threat to the Indonesian or 
Timorese people, but I hope that I am a threat to General
Wiranto and General Tanjung, and the other present and 
former leaders of the TNI/ABRI. I believe that they feel 
threatened by anyone who would expose their crimes. General 
Wiranto and Generals Bambang, Zacky, Syafei, Kiki, and many 
others, for example, are responsible for the current militia 
terror in occupied East Timor and for the increase in 
repression against the people of Aceh. This is no secret 
to the people of Timor or to the people of Indonesia or Aceh. 
They have suffered for decades under the repression and 
corruption of TNI/ABRI.vMany brave Indonesians, Timorese, 
Acehnese, and West Papuans have been killed, arrested, 
tortured or raped because they dared to criticize the army 
and demand their right to freedom.
     As a foreigner and a journalist, particularly an 
American journalist, I know that I enjoy a certain de facto
political leeway that enables me to say things that local 
people would be killed for saying. I have tried to use that
privilege to tell the truth about TNI/ABRI. If, because of 
this, the army feels they must arrest or jail me, then I
know that there is nothing I can do to stop them. But they 
know that they cannot arrest or kill all the people of
Indonesia. That is why they are now so fearful, and that 
is why I believe they will lose their desperate struggle 
to retain their hold on power and their police state.
     During my most recent detention, I have been 
interrogated by officials from army Intel, police Intel, 
Kopassus Group 5, and many other units. They have asked 
me many questions about my political motives and opinions. 
I would summarize my opinions this way:
     I am pro human rights, pro democracy, and anti 
TNI/ABRI. I am a supporter of the people of East Timor,
Aceh, West Papua, and Indonesia, and an opponent of the 
officials who have repressed and exploited them.
     As an American citizen who is visiting Indonesia and 
occupied East Timor, I also want to be clear that I believe
in even-handedness. The same political, moral and legal 
standards that are applied to TNI/ABRI officers should
also be applied to the officers and political leaders 
of the United States. So while I support the UN
Secretary-General's call for war crimes and crimes 
against humanity prosecution on East Timor, I think 
that the prosecution should not be limited to Indonesian 
officials. Foreign officials who were accomplices to 
atrocities in East Timor, and provided both murder 
weapons and the logistics of repression should also 
be charged, prosecuted and if convicted, jailed.
     Pragmatically, it is hard to imagine General Wiranto 
sitting in jail. It is even harder to imagine President 
Clinton as his cellmate. But justice should be impartial.
     It is time for the genocide to end. Untold thousands 
of Timorese lie slaughtered. Their families are bereft. The
victims of Santa Cruz, Liquica, and Suai can no longer speak. 
Those of us who can should insist that the killing stop 
right now. And we should also insist that the killers 
face justice, regardless of who they are.
     These same principles apply of course to atrocities 
everywhere. I think that this is a simple idea and that 
most people would agree.
     If General Wiranto or any other officials have further 
questions about my views, I would be glad to answer them
personally at a time and place of their choosing. I would 
also be glad to give details on the crimes referred to
above, and on the complicity in them of General Wiranto 
and other officials.
