different.   You're right.  We're just            1998

   Prime still here. The only other thing I have for you this issue
is some notes from the Chiapas conference last week. I'll type them
in raw here. Discernment will have to come some other (life)time.

3 states most oil, chiapas, tabasco, veracruz
chiapas provides 52% of the electricity for all of mexico

security police, military and paramilitary.
       (looks like stockwell's angola)

uranium near tabasco.
oil and electricity all to the western half of chiapas.
foreign investment all along the southwest coast.
chinese bananas and japanese shrimp and tuna.

grupos platanos (the banana group) a new paramilitary group.
         (sounds like something newt and rush would found...)

22dec97 massacre acteal

2 goals for army to burn down chiapas' mountains
   1) destroy economy
   2) create hunger forcing people to rely on gov't assistance

boycotts of mexican products.
sistering, brothering with people who have gotten death threats 
lately.

reconnecting people expelled from Mexico is "mui importante."
we need an influence on the press in mexico.

paper companies, paper companies. eucalyptus. 72,000 hectares.
cellulose for paper, menthol for medicines and cigs.

tricontinental project.
   rivers and trains.
      a couple new panama canals??

"you are also a divided nation with indigenous,
afrikan-american, and european."
     --chucho alveredez

3 fundamental lies form Zedillo's admin.
           by Tom Hansen.
1) peace accords were stalled. 
          both signed. mexican gov't refuses to implement.
2) indian on indian. old struggle
          military moved in the last few years and orchestrated this.
3) army is there for peacekeeping.
          army trains the paramilitary groups.

building schools in chiapas is now against the law.

there is a larger punishment for stealing a cow in chiapas
than for killing an indigenous person.

11 new prisons have been built in the last 6 months.

"a real citizens education
looking at new ethical values
of respect for each other.
Tolerance, inclusion."
   -onesimo hidalgo

"Mother Earth" was mentioned in excess of 21 times throughout
the conference.

(NEWZ!!!) June 13, 1998. Union Progresso, 
Chiapas.
  The public forces took one dead, and seven wounded
from here, according to the authorities of the Autonomous
Municipality San Juan de la Libertad, last June 10, 1998.
   They "were taken alive and tied up by the federal
soldiers and State Public Security forces. These 
companeros were executed" on orders "of the state and
federal governments."
   Among the list of dead in the community of Chabajeval,
where four were killed, one was "a one year old child 
who was disemboweled."

To understand the continuing massa-
cre and mayhem by governmental for-
ces against  the Native peoples  of
Chiapas, just remember that govern-
ments  in our lands,  are the  ser-
vants  of the corporations, politi-
cians talk of good things, but pur-
sue the wishes of the corporations.
   Remember  Pine Ridge  Territory.
   Study the  Navajo/Hopi Joint Use
Area.

as per usual,
poetics to end.

AMERICAS by marco

How can I help you
Understand that until
Navajo are treated right in
"My Country" I don't care
Whether my president
Slept with him or her or not.

Also, until the people of
Chiapas are allowed to
Control their own Uranium's value
(Which sits under their houses)
I don't care about property values,
Or whether Clinton slept with him or her or not.

Mostly, while people starve in my own country
I don't care how great NAFTA makes
You feel, how property values are 2day
Or whether he slept with him or her
Or not.

I understand that you care immense, about
How things are, now that NAFTA makes 
25% of us feel better, how wonderful it is that
Property values are moving again
Like seasonal-skirt-hem-lines,
And whether he slept with him or her.

                                     Please
                                  at
                            least
                 understand
              my
       hurting
heart
      for 
          this...



KEEPING "US" ALL IN BUSINESS   by Ibid.

   How many people are making 
good money this moment,
   Each designing new and
different ways to keep
restrooms in two rolls of
toilet paper at a time?
   All the time?
   New, new new.
   Old isn't bad...
It's just not new.
   How many new toilet 
dispenser inventions will 
get patented the next 
year alone?
   If I told you
you would (perchance literally)
      poop your pants.
