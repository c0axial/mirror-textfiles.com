DID SOMEONE ORDER             P
A SPAM AND CHEESE PIZZA?     R
   I ordered a thin crust   I   California Pesto delivered today: 
Olive oil, fresh garlic,   M   basil, covered w/ mozzerella. Mmmm.
Sounded splendorifically, E   stupendously scrumptious.
   It came in a flat bag     with that map on it which shows you
which part of Italy     A   is north and which is south.
Almost half as big as  N   that map was the now-all-too familiar 
"REAL" symbol that    A   tells you you'd better do some pushups
when you're done     R   eating because there's probably a little
of that bovine      C   growth hormone mixed in with your cheese.
   But that's OK,  H   The real problem I'm writing about this 
week is much less I   subtle. Perhaps subterranean, subliminal
AND simply self- S   evident.
   Stapled to   T   my receipt was honest to goodness, down to
earth low-tech S   spam.
1) free movie     or game rental coupon. 1 ea.
2) free      C   lighter coupon with any purchase at a
tobacconist.O   2 ea.
3) $50     L   signing bonus and $325 for each referral for
a full-   U   time job at a 3rd shift cleaning company.
Call     M   1-800-WHY-WORK for an application. 1 ea.
        N   
   Listen, I don't mind spam with my JUNO mail -- it's the price
I pay for one of my accounts to remain "totally free, the way email
was meant to be." But keep unsolicited junk mail away from my
lunch; selling me sausage with my supper would suck. Beware of my
disposition around breakfast too. I'm likely browbeating you like 
a mamma brownbear if you try to tuck little blue brochures in my
breadbox.

Most any underground board not
hopelessly lame and out-of-it would feature 
a complete run of Phrack - and, possibly, 
the lesser-known standards of the underground: 
the Legion of Doom Technical Journal, the
obscene and raucous Cult of the Dead Cow files, 
P/HUN magazine, Pirate, the Syndicate Reports, 
and perhaps the highly anarcho-political 
Activist Times Incorporated.

Terror Ferret

     Inspired by reasons that totally escape memory now, 
     Jason bought a pet Ferret in 1986. Ferrets are small, 
     long rodents that resemble minks or weasels, 
     domesticated for possibly thousands of years and
     bred for docility and in many cases albinoism. 
     They are also known to have a very strong vicious streak 
     if not disciplined at an early age. In the case of Jason's 
     ferret, his reticence to hitting the ferret when she bit or 
     attacked him or others (mostly because she was a runt female, 
     and therefore extremely small for a ferret)
     caused her to be a pure ball of anger 24 hours a day. 
     She would attack people, walls, and anything else she 
     percieved as a threat, including her own shadow. 
     For this her original name (Ferrah) became overshadowed 
     by her nickname, "Terror Ferret".

     When The Works was put up, Jason listed Terror Ferret 
     as his co-sysop, and indeed, she lived right next to 
     the machine The Works resided on, in the Computer Half 
     of Jason's Bedroom.  
 
     Sadly, Terror Ferret's overbreeding (she was bought in 
     a pet store) contributed to her catching pneumonia a year 
     and a half after she was purchased and she died 
     at the age of 2.

PAP #'s have been running since Infomaniack BBS days,

got to its 10th year. (by the way, the TAPster is 
still up at the same # 516-922-wine. Anyone know if
mojo's 619-KING is still up? I'll have to call and see.)

ANOTHER MAN'S DONE GONE
  w. woodie guthrie m. billy bragg
Sometimes I think I'm gonna lose my mind | But it
don't look like I ever do | I loved so many people
everywhere I went | Some too much, others not 
enough | I don't know, I may go down or up or any-
where | But I feel like this scribbling might stay |
Maybe if I hadn't of seen so much hard feelings | I
might not could have felt other people's | So when 
you think of me, if and when you do, | just say,
well, another man's done gone | Well, another 
man's done gone

Bikini Buskin
   a poem by the prime anarchist

Tanya and Kerry, come back
From Shawano, your bikinis
Tipped me twice.

Can't get enough; I synthesize
both Bad Company
AND Smashmouth.

Lemo-nemon-ade is free
So long as I'm learning
Raindrops keep falling
On my head.

Dancin flatfoot wearin kokopeli legs.
She tips the busker wearin koko's necklace.
And his shoulderblade tattoo
Too.

Kokopeli stickin out of your
Bikini would about
Kill me.

Is this the Real World or The Way?
Why'd you dunk your cotton candy
In my lemonemonade?

Tanya and Kerry - you were sweet.
Come back.
