And first up, here's Prime Anarchist with his 
publisher's rant. We heard it's pretty short
cause he was running out of room. Or was that
running out of doors? Or steam? Breath? Ideas?
Hmmm. Is the old bugger all washed up? Tune in 
next week when we find out if Prime still has
it in him, or "Don't Let Your Knees Knock Your
Socks Off."

Hola, I'm Prime Anarchist and this is the #'s
run for Sabado, the 11th day of the 9th month
of the 99th year. This issue went long overall,
so I'll keep my rant short.

Hoogie, boogie, noogie noo.

Yacka wacka packa poo,
Youd've felt this wacked out too
If you had this here job to do.

There I feel much better. Now here's the #'s.

   [prime replied - You might try contacting the ARC 
   people in some of the bigger cities in this country. 
   ARC is Association of Retarded Citizens I believe. 
   You can probably get their numbers or emails from 
   chamber of commerces, or travel books or something.
   The one in Colorado Springs used to (at least in 
   the early 90's) package white t-shirts for a really 
   cheap price. I mean so cheap, my friend David who 
   silk screens punk rock stuff used to buy lots of 
   large & xlarge from them because their price was 
   much better than ordering "small-bulk"
   Good luck]

Headset Man and the Cigarette
    by Prime Anarchist

"Hi, welcome to Taco Bell, may I take your order."
 "Hi, welcome to Taco..."
   "Hi, welcome to...
    "Hi, welcome to Taco Bell, may I take your..."
"Hi, May I take,"
 "May I take your order..."
   "Hi, welcome to Taco Bell, may I take..."
"Hi, welcome..."
   
   Ah, yes. I remember it well.
This guy is no mere mortal fast food clerk ready
to pop a pimple in your potato laatke to go. He's
Banquo.
   Yes, de-wax your left ear, you heard me right!
Banquo, from summer stock two years ago, Pharoah in Joseph
the year before, and every other week cameos in "General
Hospital" shaking his booty in a decadent meatmarket bar.
Banquo is rehearsing his lines behind Taco Hell with 
a headset wrapped around his pimply little fastfood head, 
and a cigarette in his first two fingers as he paces back 
and forth and rather than:
  "Upon her skinny lips: you should be women."
  "And yet your beards forbid me to interpret"
  "That you are so..."

   Shit yeah, rather than that, you get to watch him
rehearse "Hello, welcome to Taco Fucking Hell, may I
shove a twisted burrito with cinnamon jalapeno sauce
up your ass???"

   Oh!
   Oh, oh oh!!!
  Say it ain't so, Banquo?!?
  You were so talented. What did we do to forsake you?
Why do you work for one buck more than minimum, slaving
your leisure time away in a place that can't spell "hablamos
espanol" properly on their windows???
  Why aren't you in positive cash flow for your lifelong
devotion to art? Where is your reward? Where's your carrot
on a stick? Where's your "I'm not rich; I'm comfortable..."

   Is the Golden Chihauhua really saying "give me your
weary, your poor, your hard working, we'll shove a carrot
up their ass and keep them mopping the floor with the greens
while they make change, wrap tortillas and talk on the phone
at the same time???"
   In polyester clothing???

             Film's death is
               cause for concern
                 Decision to kill Y2K
                   suggests Washington
                     has millennium fears
        by
  Jonathan Chevreau

                 Hollywood has killed the film Y2K,
                an event that should cause investors
               to question how much they are being 
              permitted to know about the true state 
             of the Year 2000 computer problem.

            Boston Globe reported July 25
             that Warner Brothers cancelled
              plans for its Y2K disaster flick
               partly because, as its producer
                described it, there was a lack of
                 faith in the ability of audiences to
                  discern the difference between
                   fictional and real-world computer
                    disruptions.

                    In the movie, Chris O'Donnell was
                   to play a computer programmer who
                  discovers a Y2K-related bug that
                 could render New York City security 
                systems vulnerable to terrorists.

GAP is apt to cap on 'ya.
(PAWN) by Adam. 
   [ed note: This was filed from deep within TV-Land.]
Three interesting things about the new Gap ad camPAIN.  
First off, the third and final spot will be leather 
and I think it had a cool song but I don't remember.  
Second all those pretty faces ARE singing, they're 
all LALA LAnd based vocalists who answered a 
classified ad.  Third, and most cool, I think, 
the pretty boy who has the line in the first spot: 
"I'll dress u up in my love.  IN MY LOOOVE," is the 
lead singer of the Phantom Surfers.  PS are a LALA 
LAnd based band and their drummer was the star of 
the way-cool movie Rushmore.  Almost makes you want 
to RUSH out and get a PA album, huh?

"809: Ghthnn"
  a y2k poem by marco

Phone rings, I dream about bells.
Churchbells, hell's bells.
The bells from hell;
Somebody turn off that racket.

I'm cozy I'm warm, I'm
Fast asleep.

I'M THE ONE WHO'S S'POSED TO GET THAT.

Oh well, I look at my clock,
It's 8:09. How did I sleep thru
7am??? I wanted to get up at 7.
Give me plenty of time to write
My 909 poem.

Well, I made 909 eastern time.
But I'm the next one over, aren't I?

So now I'm early for my 909,
I call this my 809 poem.
Ghthnn, becase 809.doc
Won't work.

Nor will eightohnine,
Damn these old computers.
Wait, I love these old computers.

Computadora,
I wake up in a funk at 809,
Shove some cookies to get
Ready for coffee.

Old 8bit system,
I wake up in a funk;
Turn on Jewel's boyfriend
On my boombox,
Open two curtains to
Let some light in.

And the zipstrip switch of
my 32bit goes on.
Am I typing on the wrong
Keyboard or what???

Nah, I'm at the 8bit, why?
Not for mail, although I
Hope I got me some.

Hope it didn't crash,
You know - it's 9sep99 today.
9999, anything basic is going to
Crash
They say.

Nah, I'm not worried;
This old machine is so great
It's Y2K compliant simply for
IT DOESN'T USE A DATE FOR ANYTHING

Anyway,
I'm typing this poem
Which was meant to be a
909am poem. I guess I'm
early for a 909poem.
But late for eating a
909 pome unless I hustle.

At 909 today, 090999 I'm going
to write a Y2k poem and
eat a y2k pome at the same time.

Ladies and Gaunlets, not only
Can this guy walk and chew gum
At the same time, he's also adept
At writing and eating pomes in
Two Milleniums.
Millenia.
Minutia.
Inertia.
Mumia.
Let's go.
