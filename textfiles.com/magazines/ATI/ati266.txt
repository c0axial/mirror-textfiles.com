PUBLISHER'S COLUMN IN THE FORM OF AN OPEN 
LETTER TO A UNTIED STATES CONGRESSPERSON
Dear Mark, [Green] (R) - Green Bay
Senator Wellstone says that since Clinton forced passage 
of the Plan Colombia which you and I discussed at Bay Beach 
amusement park last summer, political violence went through 
the roof, and has yet to stop. 
  He says the two major guerilla groups continue making serious 
violations, including mass kidnapings. Colombia's police say 
they registered twenty-three paramilitary massacres in January
alone.
  I remember reading about suspicious murders almost immediately
after Clinton and Albright rushed that horrible plan through in
the middle of the night before you or your collegues could've 
demanded a moratorium.
  Now I know burden of proof's on me and your other constituents
before you'd like to consider closing the SOA. Maybe that's 
fair, maybe it's not.
  Just the past couple weeks there's been heightened paramilitary
activity, despite the new name of the school and the fact that
we're trying to run so many more colombian soldiers through all 
those secret classes. Frankly it reminds me of drinking wine with 
a wino every weekend thinking if you do it in moderation next to 
him maybe he'll slow down someday.
  Make a long story short, I voted for you because of your honesty
about Colombia, and your efforts to slow down Clinton and his police 
state. Besides my mom, you're the first Republican I've voted for
since the 80's.
  Mark, I don't believe our foreign policy is reformable in Chiapas,
Guatemala OR Colombia, and I don't feel it's reformable in Georgia.
I'd like you to consider defunding the SOA, not because of proof 
Kenneth Star, Ron Kuby or Ramsey Clark can come up with for a fee, 
but because it just seems logical. 
  Please don't wait until you're 65 and a sudden fan of decriminalizing
drugs before you help me stop the killing, ok?
Marco

ATI ZINE. We're NOT What's For Lunch!
    ----

& In CorpRatOkRazy nEWz : Subway's sandwich shop 
sued a Grosse Pointe, Michigan landlord telling 
him to drive a vegan cafe out of business three 
doors away in a strip mall.
  John Chetcuti, owner of Atom's Juice Cafe, which
doesn't sell meat or dairy products, says he doesn't
see how his store is in any way competing with Subway.
Chetcuti's clientel tends to be the 5 to 10 percent
of the eating population made up of Buddhists, Sikhs, 
lactose-intolerant, Hare Krishnas, vegans and vegetarians
and not only do these people never frequent Subways but
he doesn't think Subway customers would be interested
in eating at Atom's Juice Cafe.
  He says legal fees have already drained the small 
shop's profits and increased its debt.
  Last October, Subway sued Fisher Road Properties, 
owner of the small shopping area across the street from 
Grosse Pointe South High School, saying that Subway's 
national ad campaign "emphasizes and stresses the healthy 
nature" of submarine sandwiches, and that the landlord 
violated a no-competition clause in the lease by allowing 
a shop to move in that "directly competes with Subway in 
their attempts to market healthy food products." 
  This caused the landlord to sue Atom's for breach of 
contract, and Atom's countersued to stay in business. 
  Les Winograd, spokesman for Subway, said the company
will not comment on pending litigation. Gary Wilson, an 
attorney for Atom's, said a hearing is set for March 12 
to determine if an agreement can be worked out. 
  Chetcuti said the juice bar can't move, otherwise the 
brothers and their families would go bankrupt having spent 
$180,000 of "borrowed and begged" money to open the shop 
and another $7,500 on legal fees.

Blue Boxes now accepting more recyclables
  Toronto residents are being urged to help 
the city get out of the business of burying 
its trash by throwing more items into household 
Blue Boxes.
  Yesterday marked the beginning of the expanded 
Blue Box program, which will help the city reach 
its goal of recycling or composting 80 per cent 
of all Toronto's trash by 2009.

  CD - CD Department - SONIC JOYRIDE: BEhEmoth

Sonic Joyride is the first band to be blessed (or is 
it plagued?) with the honor of recieving Editors' Choice 
since I restarted it back in March of 2001. This issue 
of ATI Zine will contain this short CD review and we'll 
follow it up every other week or so with a plug.
  I'll probably discuss another song at length every 
other week. Why? Well to be honest with you, I can't 
pick one favorite song yet. I like them all. 
  Their sound? Why try to categorize, but if I were tied
up and forced to pick, fear of having my toenails yanked
off by Mike Myers' teeth in a part-four-bad-movie-sequel,
I'd tell you straight ahead good 'n loud rock.
  It starts out sounding like if Lenny Kravitz DIDN'T sign
with Tommy Hilfiger, and moves into this ethereal ballady
Eagles-plus-Prince-divided-by-2 kind of sound that I can't 
quite put my finger on.
  By the time you're too bothered with not being able to
tell why you like it, this CD ends with the wackest Ozzie
Osborne meets Trent Reznor meets Flea kind of sound.
  Which of course leaves you saying, "when's their NEXT one
coming out?
  Shit, I was trying to avoid mentioning a single song 'til
April. "Duplication Man" kicks some serious music industry 
ass.
  OK, they're not quite the Lucky Boys, but then they're not
from Chicago either. And sorry. It's just the truth. No one
can be both a LuckyBoy and from Chicago, except, well, well
except a LuckyBoy from Chicago. Right?
