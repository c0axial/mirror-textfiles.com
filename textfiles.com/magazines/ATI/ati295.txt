Hello, 
Would you be willing to help us raise money for the American Red Cross 
Disaster Relief Fund? My name is Jason Day and I am the Marketing Manager 
with Rankyou.com/Twistedhumor.com.
  I wanted to contact you today in regard to a new online game we just put 
out a little over 3 days ago.  The game is entitled, "Yo Mamma, Osama!"
  In just 3 days of release, it has already generated over 600,000 downloads, 
making it the most downloaded game on the Internet.
  The game was created for charity.  To read more about that, you can check 
out the National Press Release put out by Yahoo.com by clicking here: 
http://biz.yahoo.com/iw/011003/03032598_1.html So far, we have raised over 
$8,000 for the American Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund in just 3 days.
  While that is good, it is nowhere near our goal of $1 million.  Therefore, 
I wanted to contact you today and ask for your help.  We have waived all 
licensing fees for this game and are allowing sites to promoting this free 
of charge so that we can generate the exposure necessary to attain our goal 
of raising $1 million for charity.  The fun, entertaining aspect of the game 
combined with its purpose makes for a perfect fit for all audiences.  I want 
to offer you the opportunity to help us out and promote this game to your 
audience free of charge.  Charity aside, it is also a great marketing tool 
as again; this game gets forwarded around quite a bit.  I understand how 
valuable your subscribers are to you.  Therefore, if it is literally 
impossible for you to justify promoting this game free of charge, I am 
willing to work out something where we will pay for your services.
  To promote the game, you can send you audience straight to our landing 
page, which is http://www.twistedhumor.com/games/osama/mail/ OR, you can 
promote the game yourself and send your audience straight to the download 
link, which is http://www.twistedhumor.com/games/osama/download.php 
  If you have any questions and/or concerns, you may contact us.
  Thanks in advance for helping us achieve our goal of $1 million raised. 
Best, Jason D. Day
Marketing Manager

 [ Sorry, Ever since Elizabeth Dole tucked Red Cross millions  
   away toward her husband's campaign and got away with it
   despite gazillions of journalists trying to prove it, I've 
   found myself unable to help the Red Cross with much of 
   anything. 
      I'd much prefer to work with the local NY groups and
   small agencies like the Catholic Worker, or Anarchist
   Black Cross. I'm not catholic myself per se, but if I 
   was going to trust any large group, really it would be 
   the diocese's offices there on the ground in NYC.
      I certainly won't get in your way, but I won't join 
   in. Thanks for thinking of us ]

PUBLISHER'S COLUMN

If I don't die of anthrax, depleted uranium poisoning or
terrorism before November 16th I will be at Fort Benning
protesting the School of Americas. 
  Why? Because it hasn't closed yet. 
  In 1998 when Guatemala's Bishop Juan Gerardi was killed
by graduates of the assassins-school I vowed to work my
entire life around being in Georgia once a year and DC
once a year to do both lobbying work, and also non-violent
direct action to "pardon my french," but SHUT THAT MOTHER
FUCKER DOWN.
  If you are "american" and wish to know where 90% of the 
world's terror comes from you need only look in your own 
back yard people. Your taxes have been paying for death
squads since SOA got itself kicked out of Panama. We put
it inside Fort Benning, GA and continued our secret mission
of "destabilization" and our real foreign policy of bringing
drugs into this country while we pretend to fight it; and
at the same time, we bring terrorism into this country decade
after decade while we pretend to be fighting it.
  How long will be tolerate this???
  Pardon my "french" again, but if you want to SHUT THAT MOTHER
FUCKER DOWN, won't you join me this 16Nov through 20Nov? That is
if you don't die of terrorism, depleted uranium or anthrax.

I went short with this to bring you some guest columnizing
from Boston Indymedia corresponder Don Ogden


The First of those quaint little Amendments tacked onto the U.S. Constitution 
doesn’t seem to hold much sway among the media moguls in TV-land these days. 
There recent conference call with National Security Advisor, Condoleezza Rice 
sounds like it was a veritable patriotic love fest, that is, what little we 
know of its content. Like the mysterious evidence of Osama bin Laden’s 
culpability in the September 11 massacre that was shared with various 
world leaders, but not with the American public, we are left out of the 
loop of our own allegedly free press. Not to worry. As many have suspected 
for a while now, it’s not so free anyway.
  The network news moguls agreed to censor future tapes made by bin Laden 
and his associates and to, in the words of the New York Times, "remove language 
the government considers inflammatory". Say what?  Is there a copy editor in the 
house? Have these guys just passed a civil service exam?  O, sorry, I forgot: 
there’s a "war" going on. It’s advertised seemingly every minute of every day, 
in spite of the fact wars take place between nations and this one was never 
officially declared. But the definition of "official" is a bit illusive these 
days. We don’t have an official news censor as we did in WW II, but then who 
needs one when you have an amazingly pliable mainstream media. Ever since the 
networks and big dailies caved in to the Pentagon during the Grenada and Panama 
invasions, sheepishly agreeing to limited access, staged briefings, and media 
pools, the U.S. public has been served up a suspiciously filtered brand of...
er... product? 
  But hey, like CBS News’ Andrew Howard says: "This is a new situation."  
  There’s that phrase again. It’s all over the airwaves and in the print like 
a sticky film, maybe a disaster film.  Howard went on to say: "Given the historic 
events we’re enmeshed in, it’s appropriate to explore new ways of fulfilling our 
responsibilities to the public."
  If ever these ears have heard a sound bite of newspeak it must be right there. 
The old ways of fulfilling journalistic responsibility concerned a free press 
doing its job without undue influence from government or corporate power. Now 
that those entities are one in the same the corporate media can explore new ways 
to inform us of how the world works. It’s Dan Rather, I believe, who wrapped up 
his nightly CBS broadcast saying something like "that’s our world tonight", or 
"that’s the way it is". It seems pretty clear whose world he’s talking about and 
what the definition of "is" is. However, in true newspeak tradition, it was Rather 
who stated a few weeks back that he’d gladly get in line when his president told 
him. Today he says: "I’m always wary when the government seeks in any way to have 
a hand in editorial decisions...but this is an extraordinary time."
  I guess the question out here on the other side of the dial is will it be remembered 
by our children or grandchildren as the extraordinary time the First Amendment was 
shredded and sent down the Memory Hole, never to return. 
  Stay tuned.




September was one hell of a month

By Patrick Moore
President & CEO 
Glovaroma, Inc.
Makers of Slurm© 
and Mom's© Motor Oil

September 2001 will go down as a very memorable month. Not just because my son, Matt, 
went to Boston for the first time, but because of the  attacks on the Twin Towers and 
the Pentagon.

But, more specifically, I remember September 11. I slept in, recuperating from a 
5-hour class on Monday nights, and my wife, Cathy, was off  that day. So we thought 
we'd go into town and grab some breakfast. We went to my mom's house to get something, 
and turned on the TV. We saw  the early reports of the tragedy, and the New York 
skyline changed before our very eyes when we saw the second tower collapse. Kennedy's  
assassination may have gotten Four Days In November, but we got a week in September
where virtually no commercial broadcasting took place,  except on cable channels. 
Even QVC suspended operations. Also, that afternoon, we made a mad dash to the gas 
station, under the fear that  gas was going up to $5 per gallon at 5.00pm. For the 
first time since the 70's, I saw long lines at the pumps. Thankfully, the rumor 
turned  out to be false.

September 11, 2001 also turned out to be the release date for the Dead Kennedys 
reissue CD's, plus "Mutiny On The Bay", a live album recorded  in the 1980's. 
However, these CD's are controversial, more because of their origin than their 
contents.

If you haven't heard already, let me recap for you: Former DK's lead singer 
Jello Biafra was sued by the other members claiming that  Alternative Tentacles 
(the DK's original label, owned by Biafra) failed to "properly promote" the Dead 
Kennedys' back catalog. However, many  view this as retaliation because Biafra 
refused to allow "Holiday In Cambodia" to be used in a Levi's commercial. In a 
nutshell, Biafra lost, and the DK's back catalog was now off AT (except for 
"Fresh Fruit For Rotting Vegetables") and out of print for most of 2001. Reports  
were that the unsold AT pressings of Dead Kennedys recordings were confiscated by 
the other members. 

Eventually, Manifesto Records (a  descendant of Frank Zappa's Bizarre/Straight/
DiscReet labels) became the DK's new label.

Yet, for all the reissuing and repackaging, there is a certain illegitimacy on 
those new releases. Biafra has publicly distanced himself  publicly from any new 
Dead Kennedys' project, and won't sell the new CD's from AT's web site. No doubt 
money played a role in the decision  to reissue those CD's on another label; 
certainly there were other labels that under normal circumstances, would have 
welcomed the DK's with  open arms, but instead, shut the door on East Bay Ray 
and Co. Seeing "Frankenchrist" on a label other than Alternative Tentacles seems 
just  plain wrong. As you know, "Frankenchrist" was the album that led to a 1986 
raid on not only Biafra's home, but also AT's and Mordam Records  offices and 
storage space. In 1987, Biafra went to trial and won by acquittal. None of the 
other DK's were present at the raid or the trial.

Speaking of the trial, Jello Biafra has more than once defended not only the DK's 
but also Alternative Tentacles using contributions as well  as funds from his own 
pocket. During the "Frankenchrist" trial, it wasn't just Biafra on trial; it was 
also Alternative Tentacles on trial  too. Michael Guarino, then a Los Angeles city 
prosecutor, admitted publicly that he did not only want to put Biafra in prison, 
but was also  intent on shutting down AT. (Guarino has since apologized.)

Alternative Tentacles is a label that is talent-rich but money poor. It has 
never been the goal of AT to compete with BMG, Warners, or Sony,  who can 
spend more on promoting the newest N*Sync single in one city than AT's annual 
income. For the past 22 years it has eked out an  identity unlike any other 
label in the music business. But looking at the way the other DK's betrayed 
the spirit of Dead Kennedys, one can conclude they won a battle, but lost 
the war.

My City
   a poem by John O'Connor

What if life were long
and eternity short?
In my city innocent people
are killed by a thunderous
terror from above. Vendors
in the street are pummeled
by rubble. Men and women
on their way to work are greeted
with the anonymous hatred
of those they have never met.
Janitors, businessmen, clerks,
cooks, construction workers, the rescue
workers who risk all to help these.
My beloved city showered with death.
We cry up and ask, in the midst
of the screams of loved ones,
why do they hate us so?
Why do they do this to our city,
to our lives?
My stomach turns in on itself.
The people I love, burning, dissolving,
dying. The city I love, attacked
from above. My brothers in agony.
My sisters. Children. Mothers. Dead.
Who would do this?
Why my beautiful city?
How do we survive this
but by  breathing the city's name
over and over like a mantra, a prayer?
Baghdad, Baghdad, Baghdad.
