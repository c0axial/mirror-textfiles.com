"It's a rectangular platform, about one foot by two feet,
with a heating element built into it and foam rubber all around
the outside. You plug the unit into a wall socket, let it heat up
and put a wet blotter on top of it. Right away, the steam begins
to rise from the blotter. By experience, you know just how wet to
get it. Then you place the envelope on top of the blotter, with
the flap side down. In a matter of seconds, any envelope will come
right open. Later you reseal it--the CIA makes a very effective
clear glue. If it's done right, there's no trace that the envelope
has been tampered with."

DR. Abraham Kuti
FEDERAL MINISTRY OF PETROLEUM RESOURCES
FEDERAL SECRETARIAT JALALALAD, IFGHANISTAN
Attn: marco capelli

RE: URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL
I am Dr. Abraham Kuti, the Director and Funds
Co-ordinator of the Finance/Contract Department of the
FEDERAL MINISTRY OF PETROLEUM RESOURCES.

Terms of Reference.

My term of reference involves the financial management
and disbursement of proceeds from petroleum products
and also the award of contracts to multinational
companies.

My office is also saddled with responsibility of
screening categorization and prioritization of
projects embarked upon by this Ministry as well as
feasibility study for selected projects and
Supervising the project consultants involved. A
breakdown of the fiscal expenditure by this office as
at the end of the fourth fiscal quarter of 2000
indicates that this Ministry paid out a whooping sum
of US$736M (Seven hundred and Thirty Six Million
United States Dollars) to successful contract
beneficiaries. The Ministry is now compiling
Beneficiaries to be paid this last quarter of 2001.
The crux of this letter is that the finance/contract
department of this Ministry deliberately over-inflated
the contract value of the various contracts awarded.
In the cause of disbursements, this department has
been able to track down the sum of US$41.5M (Forty One
Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars)as
the over-invoiced sum. This money is now lying and
floating in the Ministry’s domiciliary account with
the Apex Bank, Central Bank of IFGHANISTAN (CBI). My
colleagues and I now want to quickly transfer this
fund to a safe nominated account for possible
investment abroad. We are not allowed as a matter of
Government policy to operate any foreign account
because of our status as Civil/public servants. Hence
the need to solicit for your account to transfer this
fund into.
We have also evolved a sharing formula as follows:
(1) 25% for the foreign account owner
(2) 70% for I and my colleagues
(3) 5% will be set aside to defray all expenses both
locally and internationally during the course of this
transaction. Furthermore, we shall be relying on your
advice as regards investments of part of our share in
any blue-chip Company in your country. Be informed
that
this business is genuinely and 100% safe considering
the high-powered government official involved. Send
your private fax, telephone numbers and your mobile
telephone if any and same of your Bank and Account
number. This is to facilitate easy communication with
you. Contact me strictly by email.
Looking forward to healthy business relationship with
you.
Sincerely,
DR. Abraham Kuti



PRIME ANARCHIST DOES NOT COLUMNIZE THIS WEEK.

To the relatives of Digna Ochoa y Pla'cido:
To the members of the Miguel Agusti'n Pro 
Human Rights Center:

Brothers and sisters:

I am writing you in the name of the old ones, children, men and 
women of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation.

We have just heard of the assassination of Digna Ochoa y Pla'cido, 
so long foretold and so irresponsibly discounted. The crime which 
blotted out this life reaches and is enough to shock any honest 
person into indignation.  When social fighters are eliminated, the 
Powers hold parties, sport their best finery, and let drop a few 
coins so that their charity might purchase indifference.  There is 
no change above other than that dictated by fashion, and, below, 
injustice and poverty are repeated in faces and steps.  There will 
be sadness and anger below, but no longer will there be impotence.

The crime committed against Digna will most certainly cast a shadow 
over the steps of all those men and women who have made the defense 
of human rights their path and goal.

But we must everywhere build that collective light which dispels
that shadow, and which prevents the clock from once again marking 
the yesterdays of impunity, cynicism and indifference, which are 
nothing but the clothing of forgetting.

We cannot find the words which would serve, at the same time, to 
hurt and to relieve the grief which is veiling our, and your, eyes, 
but not our course.  Anyway, our silence goes as timid embrace, 
because you know that you are accompanied in silence as well.

Vale.

Salud and long life to she who carried vocation and destiny in name.

PRESS RELEASE TYPE STUFF:

Saludos:

   Our update in email format.

   For us at the Cafe it is obvious that the events of Sep 11 are not over as
   each day brings in more news that can only be seen as attacks or
   consequences. Having grieved the demise of so many, having comforted the
   afflicted, consoled the survivors, thanked the helpful hands of so many
   unknown heroes (some known to us), we are faced with the aftereffects in
   terms of health (physical & mental), finances (loss of jobs, curtailmaint
   of revenues), political suspended, uncertain primaries), sports (canceled
   games, and we almost don't make it to the World Series, PLEASE) and even
   spiritual concerns (WHY?, beliefs and what is done in the name of
   beliefs). Even as we walk in what should called "Wartime", a call for
   return to normalcy may at moments appear a little bit too much to ask for.
   And Yet there is some comfort left. The same species that begets such
   horrors can express a creative (devine?) side that affirms life. That
   somehow commands us to do better. It is my privilige while I am preparing
   this notice, to hear rehearsals, practices, poets prepping, musicians
   tuning. I thank you! For you help me in keeping the faith (so tested these
   days).

   Over the past weeks, I have received notices from many groups around the
   country that wish to do what comes naturally to them: Poets, Musicians,
   Artists working for Peace. We will keep you updated as space allows.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 

CLAN DYKEN BROTHERS IN CONCERT 

(Please Note: Alice Di Micele will NOT appear as was previously
announced) 

"Straight from the Heart" A Benefit for Dine' (Navajo)
of Big Mountain 

Nov. 10th, 7;30 pm 
Ashland Community Center 
59 Winburn Way 
Ashland, Or. 

Acclaimed singers songwriters Clan Dyken Brothers will be doing a
benefit performance for the Resistance families of Big Mountain, Az. on
November 10th , 8 pm at the Ashland Community Center. As long time
supporters of Indian issues, the Dykens will perform acoustic music
which has been acclaimed by such legends as Wavy Gravy who says "One of
the greatest rock and roll bands in the free world" and Kim Angelis who
explains "The(ir) lyrics cry out for us to care a little more about our
fellow man and our planet, the music lifts the spirit to a state of
joyous celebration...there's just no sitting still when the Clan weaves
its spell." 

Accompanying the Dykens will be Louise Benally, an internationally known
speaker, Dine' human rights activist, and mother of four children and
resident of Big Mountain, Arizona. "Straight from the Heart" will
provide an evening of song and story, politics and heart. Adding to the
mix will be a local Native Drum and Song group as well as some surprise
local artists. 

This event will benefit the Dine', who after over two decades of
battling and losing a freedom of religion lawsuit, are readying for
another winter and a series of trials. These trials are the result of
arrests which took place at Camp Anna Mae Sundance , Big Mountain, Az.
this past July (visit www.blackmesais.org for more info) and make the
necessity for support particularly urgent. 

In these precarious times, the prophecies and prayers of the People of
Big Mountain play an important role in the survival of all people. That
is, helping the families of Big Mountain maintain their traditional
lifestyle, cultural beliefs, and freedom of religion brings the chance
of peace that much closer to all of our lives. A special thanks in
advance to all who support this benefit. 

Tickets are $5-7, sliding scale, elders and children under ten admitted
free. This event is sponsored by Walk in Peace and Melissa Willemth. For

THE ELECTRIC FUNERAL
  an essay.
    Saturday. 27Oct01

Today is the first day after the new "anti-terrorism bill 
got signed.

  [ Worth noting, this bill has been introduced a couple ]
  [ times a year  since 1998  to my knowlege.  Probably  ]
  [ earlier when I wasn't aware.                         ]

  I have the same feeling of dread I had when George Sr won
the pResidency following up 8 years of Reagan.
  I signed up on delayed entry program for the Army Signal
Corps right after George Herbert Walker took his just desserts.
          
                 (storm?)

  I shipped out for basic right after his inauguration. Only 
half alert to the fact that he will be my commander in chief
the entire time of my enlistment.

                 (storm coming?)

It was that feeling.
War was on its way.
It was being ushered in.
On only needed look.
And listen.
And feel.

Libya,
Panama, Iraq.

Dread.

Feeling of dread.

That brings us to now with the decade we'll be spending
in Afghanistan.

Yeah, I know. 
Chronologically, I've left out a lot.

Somalia, Kosovo, Bosnia, Serbia, Indonesia, Colombia, Chiapas,
Peru, Salvador, Nicaragua.

Again.

And again.

And againg.

And always Cuba.

Forever Cuba.

                 (storm coming you better hide.)



                  


     THAT'S ALL WE GOT THIS WEEK...


SEE YA NEXT TIME.
