    ] PUBLISHER'S NOTE: notas publish mas [

Hello there, I'm prime anarchist and this is the 'zine for
the February half-moon when George W. Bush bombed the tar
and nicotene out(side) of the no-fly zone.
  Depleted Uranium is safe, right? Adolf Hitler's birthday
fast approaches, please kids. Please, especially you TCM's.
Please. No violence this year. No weapons. Please. That's
not the answer. Yes. Your government fucked you very very
early in your life. Don't blame me, don't blame God, forgive
your teacher, your 'rents, and for pete's sake, don't waste
all five of the people who sit near you.
  How many orphans are we making while we bomb outside the
no-fly zone? That's all I ask. In 2012 when these 'rentless
kids blow up a cessna, a high-speed rail, mail a bomb to an 
EXXON CEO, or shoot the shit out of the Statue Of Liberty, are 
you going to dismiss them as terrorists? Senseless misdirected
violence? Tax-payer, will you EVER RECOGNIZE YOUR PARAMILITARY
COMPLICITY???
  Who's to blame? Who should you lash out at? Someone made you
an orphan, an outcast, or a just a schmuck. Search desperately
for what orphaned you, killing hundreds of your classmates as
you go, right? NO, THAT'S REALLY FRIGGIN' DUMB.
  Grow up. Snivel the snot out of your nose, and then look for 
better ways to avenge the death of your dreams, kid. Please, 
please, ok. Listen, do me a humongous favor. Waste people 
during next-year's Hitler birthday if you have to. If you hold
off killing people one whole year, I suspect you'll either kill
yourself, or become enlightened in the meantime. But this monday
(President's day this year. MLK day or something last year?
The day that TCM [yeah, trenchcoat mafia] announced that Colorado 
children would die en masse on Hitler's birthday) please, please 
try not killing anyone. Please, you owe it to humanity to try and 
find a better way first.
  OK, I'll try not to rant too much today.
  When I was a deckhand on a Project Oceanology fishing boat 
one summer there was a foggy morning I remember all too well when
we took a couple junior high school classes up the river to finish 
teaching them things we'd been working with a few miles out into
the Atlantic ocean.
[ref]-[http://members.tripod.com/~fasters/ati122.html]
      [ use your  finder  for  the  word  buouy...   ]
  The skipper points out into the channel and says "do you notice 
anything missing there?" I did but couldn't tell what it was. 
  "Green buouy 6 is supposed to be right about there," he said to 
me, "yeah, there," before radioing in to the Coast Guard to tell 
them there was a buouy missing. He seemed amused more than worried, 
although we had a very difficult time ahead of us without that buouy
around, as we tried keeping the thing safe for about 60 kids and 
their various sundry chaperones. 
  Not a half hour went by before we saw where the buouy had been 
disappeared to, further up the "river" (it's not a river at all 
but an estuary, but I digress habitually) "there it is," I remember 
thinking, "how'd it get up here?" Well while we were up in the 
estuary, the radio was humming with explanations from the Coast 
Guard and the navy and then suddenly 












             . . . . . . . nothing . . . . . . . . .













A huge coverup ensued. Well what happened according to both 
radio groups within the Coast Guard and the navy was either 
a submarine of the same exact class as yesterday's Hawaii
mis-hap, or a Seawolf class, I don't remember precisely, 
either way, a nuke-sub got caught on it the same way a skate 
egg might catch on seaweed. 
  Only in this sub's case, you likely pay a huge tax burden 
assuming they will make darned sure they don't do millions 
of dollars worth of damage to these weapons of mass destruction 
every time you turn around. Yes, I say millions because a channel 
buouy weighs between 2 and 6 tons, and is fastened to the bottom 
of the sound with iron chain links that each weigh about as much 
as you or I do. It's not just anyone can go over there and put 
that buouy back where it belongs and repair or replace a few links 
of that iron chain.
  I'm sure the nuke-sub was tore up pretty badly as well, enough 
to hobble all the way home, "don't anyone tell mom." 
  Almost as bad as the Kursk maybe?
  So tore up pretty badly, and no one's gonna tell, which means 
it's bound to happen again, over and over and over, until some 
other day when someone  _I S_  willing to tell, and begin to work 
some of these things out the right way. That's the only way we're 
not going to see more schoolaged teens lost at sea, or killed 
instantly by the United States' weapons of mass destruction.
  By accident? Well, is incompetence an accident? Sure, a first 
time or a third time. Not a fifth time.

  "Whether they’re in Japan or Taiwan or Europe," says Fletcher Newton
in Wyoming Business magazine: 
      [http://wyomingbusiness.cc/wyjuly2000/wyouranium.htm] 
"plant operators need to know that when they contract to buy uranium, 
they’re going to get it and that they don’t have to worry about 
political strife or separatist governments or extreme political 
groups that might prevent that."

  Just an aside, does anyone know if nuke-subs are still tipped with
titanium? Or are they using the stronger, and more popular Depleted
Uranium nowadays?

  So, two things I think need to be given a long hard look right 
away by all the american people, or at least by the congress that
soaks their bucks, is the HORRIBLY RAMPANT INCOMPETENCE IN THE
HIGHEST ESCHELONS OF THE US MILITARY, and recalling this friggin' 
stooooopid phase three arms race no one seems to know how to back 
out of.

About three times a year, Williamson travels to Washington D.C.,
on "fact-finding missions." She is briefed by politicians on 
issues that can be spun into shows. For example, Rep. Frank Wolf 
(R-VA) and Sen. Sam Brownback (R-KS) filled her in on slavery
in Sudan, which became the subject of the 1999 season premiere.
Rep. Ed Markey (D-MA) calls her a "one-woman multinational
crusader for human rights."

Kentucky hemp sent to Oglala Lakota
  "Growers say it's a symbolic effort"
FRANKFORT, Ky. (PArAPhrAsed From AP And UPI
Reports) - Lakota people, who got their entire
year's crop destroyed by US Gov't agents were
able to go to Kentucky and get presented with
a load of donated hemp.
  "They're honorable people," said Louie Nunn,
who used to be the Governor around there, "they
needed help."
  20 bales and 55 large bags of hemp bedding for
livestock - was donated by the Kentucky Hemp
Growers Cooperative Association. The hemp wasn't
grown in Kentucky, it was grown in Canada.
  Oglala's Tribal Council had worked with Tribal,
State AND Federal Governments all year including
during spring planting. They were current with
everything asked of them up to last year's August
morning when Federal Agents came in looking like
commando units and destroyed about 2,000 hemp 
plants.
  Andy Graves, president of the Kentucky cooperative,
said the donation was "a symbolic effort." It makes
up for the product they would have worked with had
Feds not come in and defoliated the region. Oglala
Lakota people say they will try this again every year
until they get an adequate crop for making hemp 
products.

Pipe Bombs Found in Pa. Suburb

LIMERICK, Pa. (PAWN) -- 
There once were small pipe bombs in Phillish
Raising fears that a serial killer was killish
And although criminals lurk,
No one has been hurt.
And Police Chief Weaver was curt,
Because he keeps losing his shirt
On fake drug busts, and bomb hoaxes,
And the ongoing possibility that 
A copycat was at work.




"GOD" IS AT MENTAL HOSPITAL
  

A director of a large network of furniture shops 
in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk, got to a 
mental hospital. He considers himself the Lord. 
  The director ordered employees of his company 
to sprinkle furniture, exhibited for sale, with 
the mixture of "God’s" urine and popular in Russia 
mineral water "Saint Springs." 
  "God," a karate black belt, knocked out an employee 
of the ambulance, which arrived to take him to hospital. 
He also chopped off two fingers with a Samurai sword to 
prove his divine origin and insensibility to pain. 
  Nevertheless, while staying at hospital, he still rules 
the trading network, because he is its sovereign owner.

EVERYTHING HE TOUCHES TURNS TO GOLDY HAWN MOVIES
  by Nat Grudge in the 3rd person. Special to
PAWN - Prime Anarchist World News 2nite.

Norfolk - (PAWN) President Bush was playing commander in 
chief today during high-tech war games at Joint Forces 
Command in Norfolk, Va. at the same time two Blackhawk 
Helicopters collided killing six military and injuring 
eleven. Unnamed sources close to the corporate media 
say there is "no correlation between George Bush playing 
wargames and the planes crashing but Nat Grudge thinks 
differently.
  "He crashed 'em, alright." Grudge said in a press 
conference live in irc chat, "period, end of paragraph. 
And I think Cheney and Powell are behind it." 
  Grudge claims a video link allowed him to confer with 
NATO leaders at sea, which is how Grudge got enough inside
information to be sure in his mind and heart that Bush did
in fact kill these young men in harm's way.
  Yesterday, during a similar appearance at Georgia's Fort 
Benning, Mr. Bush detailed his $5.7 billion "quality of life" 
improvement plan for the military.
