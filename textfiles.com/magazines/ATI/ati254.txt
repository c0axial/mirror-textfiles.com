GR33TINGZ: I'm Prime Anarchist, It's almost midnite,
the 22nd of December; and here's some Activist Times.


PAC-GL: the Prime Anarchist Column Goes Long

  I shopped at Caldor the other day.
  I bought three things; all from different departments.
  I always like giving Caldor my money even though the 
original owners sold it many years ago; back in the 80's I'm told. 
Carl and Deloris Bennet live comfortably somewhere in Connecticut. 
One of the managers at the Norwich store tells me they're doing 
well, and last he knew they had a house in Fairfield.
  Once when I was young I went to the Groton Caldor wearing 
a shirt and tie; and I filled out a job application. Those were 
the days when you didn't need a resume for a minimum wage job. 
But a tie almost always assured you a "shoe in."
  I honestly don't know if it was a manager or an owner 
who took my application, but she directed me into her office 
saying it just happened to be a slow moment and if I was willing 
she could interview me right away. She offered me coffee and I 
obliged. I honestly didn't know how I liked coffee yet, so I 
asked for it "with everything."
  All went well with the interview until she got to the line 
about my date of birth. Yes it was my 14th birthday. She wished 
me a happy birthday and explained to me that by law she couldn't 
hire me for another two years.
  She said I was a very nice charming determined young man, and 
that she was certain I would do quite well for myself in all of 
life. If I came back in a few years, I had her word that she 
would personally find me a job somewhere within the company.
  I thanked her, shook her hand, and held up my face until 
I left the building and then cried all the way home.
  I never took her up on that job offer two years later as 
I'd ended up working at a local Elks Club that paid twice 
the minimum wage.
  A year later I found out at a family reunion while my father 
was picking on me for what I'll always remember as "that Caldor 
moment," that my grandmother used to buy fruit from Deloris 
Bennet back during the depression. Lots of fruit. My grandmother 
supported my grandfather's two failing clothing stores by 
selling apples in front of factories during shift changes and 
breaks. Her philosophy was, "If they can't afford anything else, 
they should buy fruit."
  "You actually knew Carl Bennet?" I asked my grandfather.
  "Knew him?" he said. "I helped him open the clothing 
departments to all his stores years ago. All the Caldor's 
AND all the Bradlees."
  When my grandfather sold his three clothing stores back 
in the 70's, you could say he went on to live and die comfortably 
in Pawtucket and Warwick, Rhode Island. I'll never forget when my 
9th grade prom was coming up and my grandfather looked me up and 
down and said "38 short." No tape measure or anything. My grandfather 
still "had it." That was long after he'd sold off his stores. One 
became a chain of "Gentleman's Wearhouses," and the others are 
still in Warwick and Providence run by children of some of his 
original partners.
  My dad took me to Anderson Little to outfit me for a really 
cool tan cord 3-piece suit. "36 medium," the salesman said measuring 
me with tape. He tried a few suits on me and they looked almost right 
in the mirror, but never felt right. "Let's try a 38 short, the man 
suggested. I smiled politely and waited for the magic to happen. I 
never wore that suit to another prom, but it got me into a whole bunch 
of homecomings, and years later I wore the vest in 3 different rock 
and roll bands as part of my "duds."
  I thought of all these things on my way home from Caldor that day.

Hey, check it out.
  Take something someone's written you and
count how many times they use the following words:
TopWords   : people (63), that's (45), should (40)!
  Count some of the other words and see if these three 
aren't in the top.

             A guard was stationed right in front
             of that cell and was ordered never to 
            take his eyes off me, not for an instant,
           and he didn't - though I swear he must have
         gone cross-eyed looking at me every time I took
         a crap or peed. For a while I tried looking back
        at him the same unflinching way he was looking at
        me until his face grew red, his nose twitched, and 
       he raised a beefy arm with a trembling clenched fist,
     his eyes more fearful and pleading than murderous. I half
   smiled, shrugged, and looked away. We both new that I had him
just as much as he had me. We were both prisoners, that guard and me.
