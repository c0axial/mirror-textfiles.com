Hey Al Gore, this is probably a really bad time
to mention the blank tape tax, huh? Good grief;
we're all alone inside our head.

Wife enters bagelteria, embarrassed look on her face.
  "I just tried to open someone else's car
by mistake."
Meanwhile the husband, holding baby in car-seat,
worried look on his face, maybe more that look of
"I don't know how to diaper-change, get back here
quick," says, "did they have more stuff than us?"

Mother
  a poem
  by Holly Day

Nobody knows. She pulls the collar of her shirt up 
around her neck, hiding the blue bruises 

Nobody knows. She grimaces as she slides the sleeves 
of her light jacket down, over the marks 
like love 
on her flesh, feeling silly 
like a teenager hiding hickeys from Mom. 

Nobody knows. She sweeps the broken glass from the floor 
careful not to cut 
her small white hands. She dumps the remains of an unhappy dinner 
into the waiting trash can, pulls her hair back 
into a ponytail, away from her face, 
ready for work. 

Nobody knows. She listens to gossip, quiet 
at her desk, stories about other women's sane 
and safe lives, about evenings that don't end in screaming and shouting

and cringing against blank walls and watching 
the hands of a man who once 
talked too much of love 
turn into fists 
and sing new songs 
of hate

 

Surma
  a poem
  by Holly Day 

we identify each other 
by our ceremonial tattoos 
ritualistic burnings-in the dark 
I feel the spot where someone dared you 
to put a cigarette out 
your fingers brush 
the jagged "x" that was supposed to 
stop my breath 

anthropologists, we explore 
each other's damaged pasts 
the keloid I got in ninth grade 
making happy faces with my lighter, the circle of blue dots 
a twelve-year-old did with a safety pin and India ink 
the Braille graffiti of your chest 
a warped child, a drunk stepfather-we are never 

completely naked



& NOW AN ATI PHREE "AD."
  [we occasionally choose to put an "ad" here.
   we do this on our own. We never do this when
   asked. We only do it when we feel like it.]

DON'T LOOK FOR ART JUST IN THE PERFORMANCE,
LOOK ALL AROUND YOU.
  a poem by Patti.

It will destroy your self image
There's such things called school
He's dead now, he has a journal book,
Sits by himself. 
He goes off for 20 minutes, 
"What are you reading for?"
"Yup looks like we got ourselves a reader."
That's so true, he's looping.
Both of them did a one-act play.
He repeated the whole play again.
It was the same exact play.
He was billed to do a concert.
He sat down at the piano for 7 minutes.
If I had it accurately he got $80,000 for it.
He was making a point.
Don't look for art in the performance,
Look all around you.
He has a couple chapters on guitarists.
It just touched my heart.
Just shut up, play your part; and get off the stage.
He's capable of playing across the board.
Just constantly doodling -- what constitutes
And what doesn't constitute as a song.
Where was this stated?
This is what shows up in all music.
Music can't be taken too seriously.
It either feels good or it doesn't
Just because it doesn't appeal to one person
It won't to another.
I think we're going to be going soon.

	ENDANGERED SPEECHIES
How hard can it be to help preserve MY mother tongue?
  Let's see, United States english with the Pawtucket,
RI, Fairfield and Groton, Konetiuk dialects.
  Harder than you would at first think, my friend.
English is obviously going to live on as long as there's
an England and so many ex-satellites like the U.S.
  But the nuances and "ikons" that have always kept it so
beautiful are disappearing like so many lizards, bugs,
frogs and assorted other creatures.

Here at ATI we're going to attempt bringing out one new
word a week. An "endangered word." Or a word "in danger"
of "extinction." One that doesn't seem to matter much to
people on Jerry Stringer or Judge Judas shows. 
  Words Jay Lemo and David Letterboy don't seem to care
much about/for. 
  You know, the ones British Spears and Kristina Agribusiness
won't sing. Yeah, those. The ones which carry meaning.

This week's word will be SPLOITS.
etymo-? From the alt.2600 'sploit,
found in cyberspanglish, english,
slang, hackcode and many dialects.
Referring to anything accomplished.
eggs ample: rootshell was just an example,
there are loads of other places to get
sploits http://www.insecure.org or

FORT BENNING: A PERSONAL REFLECTION
  By Laura Birnbaum
  Class of 2003
Originally printed in the St. Norbert College
Peace And Justice Center Newsletter

Eyes bloodshot from lack of sleep, body stiff from excessive
hours of travel, and mind racing with excitement, I stepped
off the bus that had become my temporary home. We had finally
made our arrival nand joined the expected ten thousand outside
the gates of Fort Benning, Georgia, location of the School of
Americas, also knwown as the School of Assassins. This nickname
is given due to its association with the bloody massacres, human
rights atrocities, and graduating officers' history of violations,
war crimes, and assassinations that have occurred thorughout Latin
America.
  I am immediatealy engulfed in the kalaeidosocopic crowd, blended
from all different walks of life; all brought together in peace,
for the same reason - to close the SOA. On the stage a few feet from
the line dividing Fort Benning from Columbus city-limits, music is 
played and voices sing out against violence. Activists and SOA
survivors speak while those risking arrest prepare to cross the
line in a solemn funeral procession, mourning SOA victims. Emotion
and exhaustion overwhelm all.
  Four thousand four hundred people crossed the line that day, many
carrying white crosses bearing the names of SOA victims. Four by four
they marched, as victims' names were individually called aloud followed
in response of "presente," symbolizing the presence of those killed among
us. (Those who crossed the line had previously undergone CD training
based on Gandhi's teachings to fulfill preparation purposes). As soon
as the last crossed, tears of mourning transformed into tears of hope
as "We Shall Overcome" was sang out and the sign of peace was held in
the air.
  It was an incredibly powerful and moving demonstration; one of
non-violent action, one of solidarity, and one of hope.
  Several of those who crossed the line were arrested and are now
facing prosecution, which could result in a maximum of six months 
in prison and up to a five thousand dollar fine. Others were issued
a one to five-year Ban and Bar Order from Fort Benning. the majority
of those who crossed the line were loaded onto buses and taken off
the base. They then proceedded to walk back where they were welcomed
with enthusiasm and appreciation.
  The closing ceremony concluded and it was time to say good-bye and
to depart, to return to the buses and to the real journey ahead. Now
it is a time to reflect, to raise a new awareness of the SOA, and to
broaden the existing one. Also, a time of hope, that the message
"Nunca Mas!-Never Again" can prevail, and the doors to the School
of the Americas are closed.
