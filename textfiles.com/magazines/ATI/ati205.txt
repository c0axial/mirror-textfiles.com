OUR MISSION YOUR FUTURE: A Real Look At Taco Bell.
   in 3 parts by the Prime Anarchist

"Most energizing place to work."
   "Up to $7 per hour."
 "Need Motivated people."
   Taco Bell's hiring. They're always hiring, aren't they?
Will they ever not? Not on this growth model, pal. 
   I was made a Taco Bell manager today. Well sort of.
Just for the day. I don't work for them, likely never will.
Sorry, I can't work for a man who drapes taped job app forms
from the ceiling in hopes to "lure" another fish. For me that
goes hand in hand with having an employee with his resume 
online 24/7 telling the whole world he's "still looking."
   I mean a market where someone offering 5/hr tries to
require a resume as opposed to a job app? Do these people
think an online resume will get them even 30 cents more per
hour??? Well I was a manager for a day because they'd fouled
up my order in a local store. I got two free meals as an 
apology. And the only way to ring it up so I get me a free 
meal in "proper" fashion was to call me a manager and ring 
it in under the manager key. Otherwise the theft involved 
in giving me a free meal would have to be called, well, theft.
   Let's take a look at all that is Taco Bell. I mean a 
real in-depth look. Don't just scratch the surface. Dig some.
What do we find? 
   Most of them are shaped like what? Like a southwestern
mission. And what kind of images does that bring up? 40% of
this planet would have to say genocide, repression, inquisition -
they would cite half a millenium of general bad mood. 
   Another 40% would call it some kind of outreach of something
trustworthy, noble, external, distant, not requiring any further
thought. That leaves 20? 
   Almost 20% (18.7 to be exact) would tell you right away they 
just don't care. Not their world, not their life. Kind of like 
an earthquake that kills 50 million people on some other planet 
or something.
   The other 1.3% of the world's population has a job shooting
gooey green guacamole-substance (tm) out of a grouting gun at a
Taco Bell near you!

  "Fight the power, IWW," says a Taco Bell manager to a young 
black counter person wearing dreadlocks.  
  "In fact I think when we print up new name-tags that's what 
we'll make yours say - 'IWW.'"
  It's nice to see the manager has plenty of time to think up 
nicknames, after all the other Responsibilities she has to pay 
out. Team Chief, I believe they call her. It was written on a 
Taco Bell bulletin board one other time I was able to see from 
the customer side of the counter. They choose to differ in name 
I guess, from the McDonalds managers who are called Crew Chief. 
Team Chief is in charge of telling everyone what to do; and 
passing out nicknames. If she's caught doing anything else, she 
probably gets written up for not following policy.
  IWW (never did get her name) is in charge of squirting guacamole 
from a device that looks like a short fat caulking gun. While 
pushing avocado mush onto burritos that pass her by, she seems 
adept at double-tasking - discussing opression, economic slavery 
and "the man." 
  Taco Bell is owned by PepsiCo who has a reputation for treating 
American employees much better than "those other companies" do.  
But then, so does Microsoft. As do Coors, Gannett and come to think 
of it - so did Henry Ford and Ross Perot. What do all these companies 
have in common? Draw the word UNION inside a circle and put a big 
diagonal red line through it. 
  Can that manager have meant the Wobblies when she called the avocado 
gunner IWW? That's the only reference I can think of for IWW - 
International Workers of the World. No one seems to know out there
how the nickname "Wobbly" came about.
  Do they still even exist? I knew Workers World still puts out a 
newspaper somewhere near Chicago, but they're a whole different 
"animal." As are Catholic Worker, putting out their paper in New 
York City. I know there are Catholic Worker houses all over the 
United States and much of the rest of the world, each doing their 
own version of Dorothy Day's published vision. But besides the 
newspapers and the houses, is there still some semblence of a 
workers movement out there?
  The only two Wobblies I've ever met in person were in their 50's,
white, college educated and well dressed. The only things that might 
stand out about them bringing the word "radical" to mind would be a 
pipe wrench (monkey?) lapel-pin and dread-locked hair. That was New 
Mexico somewhere and many years ago. Was it 1992? 1988?
  Well, just a tiny bit of research shows that IWW is very active in 
Seattle, WA; Ypsilanti, MI; and Philadelphia, PA. In fact, when asked 
why Borders Books fired Miriam Fried, June 15, 1996; the Philadelphia 
model employee (by Borders' own standards) sticks to, "For wearing 
an IWW button to work," as her soundbite. The wider story includes 
that, and also serving on union committees, signing flyers, and 
petitions and raising embarrassing questions about company 
policies. 
  Is it she who moved to my local Taco Bell to get picked on 
by Team Chief? Or does she perhaps have a sister? Body double -
or coincidence?
  "IWW Songs" was published 1991. "Something In Common: An IWW 
Bibliography?" 1986. And "Solidarity Forever: An Oral History Of 
The IWW" was 1985.
  What could all this have to do with giving a new name-tag name to 
a young black woman who works hard caulking burritos with guacamole?
  Let's see what Ashley Montagu had to say about name calling in his 
timeless text, "Anatomy of Swearing." 
  The most cultivated form of swearing is invective, which may be 
defined as polite swearing. The shafts loosed in this form of verbal 
assault are often most skillfully wrought. Though the target may be 
discomfited, the wounds they inflict are seldom serious and upon 
healing frequently leave the victim all the better for having 
suffered them. The social function of ridicule, persiflage,
and invective has not gone altogether unrecognized in its 
effect upon persons and upon institutions.

 Shared Smiles
   by Brooke Soles
   Honduras

   "here's an article i was asked to write for the 
Peace Corps Times Newspaper. I was only allowed the
number of words I have here on this page so that's 
why it may sound simple. Enjoy, brooke"

   In the U.S., women deal with sexism on a daily basis. 
Here in Honduras, we too experience these similar issues. 
As a health volunteer, I find it empowering to work with 
the local women’s groups.  Also, considering I am vegan, 
it isn’t hard to utilize what I’ve learned about health 
and respect for all living beings with my Peace Corps work.
   Over the past year, I have worked with soy cooking classes, 
organic family gardens, medicinal plant making, teaching 
English, HIV/AIDS education, and several other health 
related issues. In my village, most women understand
the benefits of what I am doing.  In fact, two women 
in my village are successfully selling soy enchiladas 
to the public, and the health care workers are selling 
medicinal plants made right in the health center!
   One of the most rewarding experiences I have had 
is teaching a "Como Planear Mi Vida" class to a group 
of young adolescents in my community.  We focus on sexuality, 
gender, self-esteem, and making choices for their future. 
It’s satisfying to see young adults voicing their opinions
especially when others disagree with their opinions.
   Health is not just about healthy eating habits, it’s 
about community, the environment, the animals, women and 
children, and all the facets that are the foundation for 
societies around the world.  Once we and our host country 
nationals begin to see the true interconnectedness of life, 
we will realize that we are not just sharing ideas of health 
but rather sharing ideas on how to make this world a better place.

Dear Marco
Happy New Year from Red & Black Disco.
We're Pete & Jade. Red & Black is a mobile Disco 
working around the North Manchester UK area. We're 
based in Rochdale.
  We offer a full mobile disco service. Something 
for everyone with music from the twenties right 
up to latest club mixes. Over 6,000 tracks all put
through a state of the art digital 600 Watt rig with
full light show. As anarchists by persuasion we do a 
couple of benefits and fundraisers for selected groups, 
working ether for free or for a door split if there's an
admission fee.
  Community groups, unemployed workers colectives, strike 
committees, and gay/bi/trangeneder orgs. We won't work for
'registered' charities or any group where anyone in the
group is on wages paid by the group. I.e. "Professional" 
fundraising organizations such as 'Shelter' definitely not 
'Amnesty' nor 'Greenpeace'.
  We've been up and running for over 15 years Jades 32 I'm 
40 (something). So if any of your readers in our area or 
further afield ( we did the anarchist squat gig in Amsterdam 
a few years back.. if we're flush with cash we like to travel... 
but usually we're pretty skint).. then they can contact us either 
at our e-mail docpete@tinyworld.co.uk
or by 'phone on UK ....(0)1706-358179.
Good luck with the mag, if you've any spare copies we'll put 'em 
out at gigs.
  PS: Politically we're revolutionary anarcho-syndicalsts.. but 
anything anarchist (NOT Libertarian) is a good enough cause for 
us. AGITATE FOR CHAOS wherein shy individualities may bloom & 
grow.
Yours comradely
docpete

Engineering the new WHOIS
by madmullah

Trouble was expressed regarding the new WHOIS now that
Internicky Servmaster is HQ's in Alexandria. (yes Clifford
Stoll, there IS a musty old book or 2 left...)

And this is the best response of the dozens we could gather
up.

 It is not on the client's end, rather it is the server.
 In essence they had a hissy fit, since they are not the 
only ones who can register .com TLD'. In order to look a 
domain up you must do 2 things; 
  1) whois <tld.arpa> this will tell you WHICH registry 
has it and what their whois server is.
  2) do a 'whois -H<server blah>  <tld.arpa> of course, 
without the '<>'s if you have fwhois on linux it is crap 
now, broke so to speak. Get the ripe one or something and 
compile it.
  Yes it is dumb, so are a lot of things that Internic is 
doing. mmm... doughnut...
  .madmullah-
         ~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~
        ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^
NSOL finally relented, kinda, and now allows multiple 
companies to act as domain-name registrars.  Unfortunately 
they decided that rather than maintain a central database 
for whois queries, you have to query the companiy that the
name is registered with.
  Assholes.  
  Quote me on that.
  You can get whois answers for most of the internet by doing:
whois <host.dom>@whois.networksolutions.com
  Yeah, and at least they picked a nice, short, mnemonic domain 
name for themselves.  
  See the above "Assholes" remark.

DATELINE June 31. 2:37 pm.
Someone puts a gold Citizen quartz watch in my guitar
case. I note the time because it's when my high school
used to let out. Just in time to let me get home if
I metalpeddled it to watch Luke and Laura hack into
the Cassadein's mainframe computer by guessing the
IcePrincess' secret password.

DATELINE January 1. 2:37 am. (and 16 seconds to be 
exact.) Battery dies or watch stops.


Well, that's about it for ATI issue 205.
The one that came out after 200, which was
before 204. Go figure.
