ANSWER: Gandhiji

These demands were met, and he broke his fast. "Let this be my
last fast," he said. He was gunned down shortly afterwards. It
is 2002 and not only is Pakistan and India still an open wound,
so are Afganistan and the US and Israel and Palestine.

PUBLISHER'S COLUMN

Rather than a column, this week I turn this section
over to Shell Stern who wrote an article about the 
SOA many years ago. It means as much this moment as
it ever did before.

SCHOOL OF THE AMERICAS  by Shell Stern Feb 6, 1997. 


School of the Americas. When I first heard the phrase I tried 
to imagine what this place could be about. Was it an institution 
of higher education that initiates and encourages dialogue between 
our northern and southern neighbors? Was it a non-profit organization 
that taught the true history of our continents? I was pretty optimistic 
with the fairly inclusive title. This did not leave me fully prepared 
for the hidden truths I was soon to discover. All I had to hear was 
the title of the video "School of the Assassins" and I knew I was in 
for some grim news. Once again I learned how our government is undoubtedly 
responsible for the deaths of thousands of people in Latin America. Our 
tax money is going to support torture, rape and murder. 
   The school of the Americas (SOA) has been in existence for about 50 
years now; first in Panama to ultimately "combat" communism and today 
in Fort Benning, Georgia to essentially crush socialist thought. It 
wasn't some ignorant soul who one day decided that the "School of the 
Assassins" was a better name for the place, but rather a passionate 
reaction to the discovery that graduates from the school were committing 
disgusting acts of violence on their own people. SOA students aren't 
taking Non-violent Conflict Resolution Skills: 101 or even a mediocre 
leadership course like I might have hoped. These people are taught 
"how-can-I-get-away-with-torturing-raping-killing-entire-villages-of-
peasants-who-are-becoming-empowered-by-an-honest-liberation-theology-
driven-church-worker-and-get-away-with-it: 101." Let's face it, with 
former panamanian dictator, Manuel Noriega as an "honored" graduate, 
what more do we need to concur that something is just a little bit 
corrupt with the activities of SOA?
   Oh there are many right-wingers who would want us to believe 
that SOA plays a crucial role in promoting democracy and human 
rights in Latin America (and under their breath mutter something 
about protecting US economic interests.) Hmm, that's odd, why 
then in October, 1996 would Amnesty International launch official 
investigations concerning the training manuals at SOA and urge 
the US government to assume responsibility for human rights 
violations committed by military personell trained there? Is it 
just a fluke that a United Nations Truth Commission report on 
El Salvador stated that over two thirds of the officers cited 
for the worst atrocities were alumni of SOA? These are only two 
examples that aided in the creation of a long list of graduates 
that have taken part in major human rights abuses in many Latin 
American countries. With so many contradictions, can there be 
any legitimate purpose for the School of the America's existance?
   For me this information is completely impossible to ignore. 
In the military's 260 million dollar budget there is 18.4 million 
dollars for SOA. Somewhere in that big stack of 18.4 million worn, 
burnt out dollar bills is at least one that has my name written all 
over it. As tax paying citizens WE are the ones who need to say the 
School of the Americas has to cease operation immediately! Friends, 
I do not believe that five hundred people stormed in on  SOA last 
November because it was a great place for a picnic. I also do not 
believe that grandmothers, priests and nuns were getting arrested 
for civil disobedience because they had nothing better to do that 
day. I met a woman who was one of the sixty arrested. Hearing her 
powerful words and non-violent approach, accompanied with the 
contents of the "School of the Assassins" 18 minute video, I was 
determined to begin my own investigation of SOA.
   Every day I discover a new article on SOA and each time I 
reflect on it I realize that we are all called in some way to 
work for justice. Each time I talk to someone else who has read 
about this scandalous school we become even more determined and 
motivated to spread the word. Won't you please join us in the 
struggle to shutdown this school of assassins? This April (date 
to be announced) we will try...

  Nazi Germany and USA can never be compared, only contrasted.
  The Reichstad building burned to the ground 11sep33. 50 years 
passed and still no one knows if President Hitler blew it up.
  The USA have the WorldTrade Building burning down 27feb01 but
history just may yet give all the answers in under four years.
