PRIME ANARCHIST'S COLUMN

Still speechless. Get to me in a 
week or two. Maybe I'll say something.
  Maybe not.

Three days have passed since the attack that destroyed the World Trade Center
and damaged the Pentagon.  I feel shocked by the attack, and deeply saddened
about the lives that have been taken or ruined.  It has been an emotional
rollercoaster.
I’ve decided that there is one small thing I want to do to help.  I would
like to invite anyone so inclined to write a letter to Ghent magazine about
their experiences during the attack and its aftermath.  Where you were when
the first plane hit? How did you find out about it? Where did you go?  What
did you see?  Who did you talk to?  How did you feel?  What are your thoughts
about the attack in general, its roots, the media coverage and the impact of
that coverage, and where you think we go from here as a city and as a country?
If you have already written on these topics — e-mails, for example — to
friends or relatives, feel free to forward those e-mails to Ghent.  You can
e-mail them to eartheater2000@aol.com.  Feel free to forward this e-mail. 
Why solicit these e-mails or letters?
Two reasons: 
1) A disaster like this can generate a mix of emotions; shock, grief, anger
in turn or simultaneously.  Writing is a useful way to sort through these
feelings.
2) The more space there is in the public sphere for people to describe their
experiences and feelings, the better. 
Not all submissions will be published, but at the very least they will be
read and responded to.
I hope this e-mail finds you all in good health, and I hope this is the worst
disaster any of us will ever experience.
Sincerely,
Stephen Kosloff
Editor
Ghent Magazine

Cut with the threats and unsubscribe yourself.
You will send
UNSUBSCRIBE ATI
to
listserv@franklins.net
It would be unethical for me to sign anyone up for this list
OR unsubscribe them.

just wanted to drop a line to say (1) i really enjoy the mailings and i only
wish i came across ATI sooner, and (2) BAD ASS for listing ozomatli's tour
dates.  i saw them 2 summer's ago when they opened for dave matthew's band and
they were awesome.  great music and totally high energy.  i love the way they
got the crowd so involved.  really nice to see performers who (at least appear)
to really care about their fans.
keep on rockin in the free world.

Is it my imagination or has the spate of mass killings risen dramatically
since "W" set foot in office.
Is it symptomatic of:
a.  A bad economy
b.  A rise in Viagra usage
c.  more blue light specials at KMART
or d.
The antichrist is holding one of the highest offices in the world.

AN ATI MUSIC INDUSTRY OBSERVATION
  I think Janet and Elton are looking
for the same love.
  Maybe they should just do each other
all rough and dirty and different and
leave the rest of us alone to enjoy
music written from hearts and souls
and stuff.

A QUOTE FOR THE END

". . . Returning hate for hate multiplies hate, adding deeper darkness to
a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out hate; only
light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that. Hate
multiplies hate, violence multiplies violence, and toughness multiplies
toughness in a descending spiral of destruction. . . The chain reaction of
evil -- hate begetting hate, wars producing more wars -- must be broken,
or we shall be plunged into the dark abyss of annihilation."
  -- Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
