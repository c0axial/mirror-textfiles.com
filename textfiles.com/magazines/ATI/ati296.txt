Alert! Cover Was Previously Opened

I drummed the balls of my feet on the carpet
about forty times, covered my mouth while laughing
out loud for at least 30 seconds, and then fell
off my chair and rolled around the floor giggling.
  Oh my God, I just finished watching the short
movie Woody Allen made for VH-1's "Concert for
NYC." It was the closest to an orgasmic experience
I've ever had out of bed. OK, closer than that 
place too. Yup, that too. Well, not on there, no.
But all the others. Yeah. That was funny. I laughed
so hard I nearly got goosebumps.
  Listen, Woody is such a genius, it scares me to
say this, but I'll bet I would raise my fist in
the air and yell "heil woody," if he asked me. j/k
Oh wow! That was funny. No I mean really funny. 
  You didn't see it? What are you dumb? Why would
you miss such a thing. Oh my god. Words could never
describe it. First there... No never mind. I'm not
gonna recount it. Let's just say it was a trip.
  Put down your cellphone and set your pager from
'vibrate' to 'off,' and watch it if you ever have
the chance.

Dear J.D. Powers and Assoc:

Here's the $50.
  Please have it say "The best weekly 'zine that comes 
out sometime between Friday and Monday just whenever
the publisher feels like it, going out in electronic
form but only holding to the ASCII character set as 
its "pallet."

  So does John Mayer sound exactly like Wayne Newton
or what?
  You know? Someone should hook all 6 of Matt Lesko's
cassettes to line in and soundforge 'em into .mp3 and
scan his entire 1,100 page book to .jpg's and mark it
up on HTML all copyleft for everyone to share.
  That'll fix 'em.
  "I need a Powerball," I overheard for at least the
seven-dozenth time this weekend at convenience stores
all around the U.S., "a Megabucks and two packs of
Camel Lights 100s."
  Is that all that's left? Tobacco and gaming?
  Ryan Adams - yeah, I know. I'll call myself Ron Lennon
or Benny Kravitz. That'll get me famous whether I'm 
talented or not.
  Oh No! They got Alan Dershwitz too. He's for state-
sponsored assassination and roving wiretaps. Says they're
going to improve human rights. 
  Huh?
  Crouching Tiger, hidden soft drink. 
  George Bush has already used "crusade," and "evil ones." 
How far do you think he'll go? C'mon Georgie, say it. You 
know you wanna. Can you say "unbelievers?" Sure, I knew 
you could. What held you back, afraid to go from 90% 
support to about 9???
  Nazi.
  Usually it takes a citizen about a week to see all the
real reasons his nation wars. This "war on terrorism"
doesn't appear to be that at all when you look at it 
with less a nationalistic and more a world view. Sure,
the "flag" of terrorism is draped all over it with 
enough pomp and circumstance to keep someone from the
likely conclusions for as long as possible so the hawks
can get themselves fully engaged before it's too late.
  This appears to me nothing more than a plain old
ordinary CIA/State Dept/Pentagon attempt to overthrow
one government [Taliban] and install an underdog
Northern Alliance.
  We're elevating a middle-intensity civil-war to 
all-out war for our own perceived potential gain.
  Last August USAma Bin "Heavy" Laden became Commander-
In-Chief instead of his earlier roll of plain old 
ordinary upper brass. We could NOT have that, now could
we?
  All the new Goodwill Industries retail stores seem to
be opening up across or next to Wal-Marts. Yeah, just
outside of each "city proper." Zoning woes? A response
maybe to economic frump.
  I was listening to a Christian PunkRock show on the
low numbers of my car radio the other day for a couple
hours and one of the most wack lyrics sailed out at me.
  "Tender as a booger in the microwave."
  Huh???
  Hey, someone tell Lorne "SNL" Michaels that the Nelly
Furtado impersonation last weekend of the "Oompa Loompa"
song inside Drew Blythe's Willy Wonka skit was his high
point for sure.
  Hmmm. The "fall retooling NBC Neilsons rating" thingie
was pretty good too.
  But let me assure you, none of this can best Woody
Allen last nite on VH-1! That was the bees' knees.

LETTUCE FOR READING


With my own two eyes.  Right before a gig.  Nothing like 
a little Packers spirit to put some bang in the rock and 
roll.  The Green and Gold are looking like contenders.  
Off to the dome for some sweet divisional satisfaction.
  I am digging your writing and the football season.  
How cool is that?
  I am not digging Shrub Jr. and the bombing season.  
Gag me with a flag.
Peace,

PRESS RELEASISH THINGIE -

There is no other place on earth quite like the rolling tundra, rugged
Brooks Range, boreal forests, coastal lagoons and barrier islands of the
19.6 million-acre Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in northeastern Alaska.
Within the refuge, the 1.5-million-acre coastal plain is often referred to
as "America's Serengeti" and like its African counter-part, it sustains an
immense herd of large migratory mammals.

The House of Representatives recently voted on legislation that, if passed,
would open the Arctic Wildlife Refuge in Alaska and other fragile wildlands
in the U.S. to oil development.   To learn more about this issue and what you
can do to help read: Too Wild to Drill, The Wilderness Society's report about
what could be lost if the House bill is enacted:

http://www.wilderness.org/listservs

And, we encourage you to urge Senate to oppose any efforts in opening up these
areas-at-risk for drilling.  The take-action page can be found at:

SCENE REPORT - Wed 17Oct01 - Somewhere in Wisconsin

You ever been in a mall that wasn't even at 10% capacity 
anymore?
  Very spooky. Almost eerie.
  I'm in one right now. I don't think I'll say the name
because suddenly I felt uttering it was tacky and mean-
spirited to all the losers. Yeah, the anchor-store(s) who 
knew they shoulda got while the getting was a go. And the 
smaller stores sticking it out thinking maybe a 5th try
might be the charm.
  Yeah, is there a mall version of "Urban Renewal?" Get
it up in here fast. I've been here two other times in four 
years and it looks like they've already tried all the usual 
tricks. You know, everyone moving into each others' floor-
spaces, using empty windows as display ads, sample-products 
you can purchase from them that remain, etc. They've tried 
it all - two or three times even.
  There's LLC's and LLP's here now like you wouldn't 
believe. 
  Yeah, give it a year or two, no commitment? Good.
  There's escalators in here humming along for hours on
end with no one using them. I took one to the highest
level where a food court used to be. 
  Yes! Like "Planet of the Apes" or something. The only
reason there's no spider webs or iguanas, bats and purple
loosestrife is just because the first payment each month 
probably goes to a janitorial service or two. 
  "Sure, I know nobody goes up there, but keep it shiny
just in case, ok? Maybe someone'll move in. Give it that 
lived-in look."
  There's five or ten CareerDevelopment/HumanResources 
companies making offices in these spaces now. And almost
as many telemarketing companies.
  The only place really happening - buzzing actually - is
across the hall from where I sit writing this scene report.
Creation Station it's called, next to Kids Alley and some
kind of Childrens Museum. A whole row of family oriented
attempts at bringing a little traffic. And it took. Parents
sit outside waiting while little girls and boys take dance,
karate, homemaking and whatever other lessons are going on
in there. Takes up about 5 store-fronts. There is free
babysitting. 
  Muzak of Santana's "OyeComoVa" is blaring out of the
ceiling speakers. I think I'm the only one who notices.
  I think of these things while at the same time letting it
sink in that the DOW went from 60+ (futures at the opening
bell) to 150- at the bell close, 160 of which was after
Merrill Lynch announced they'll be laying off up to 10,000
of their least essential personell soon. 
  (Maybe some of them will be filling this mall's Human
Resources/CareerDevelopment offices getting themselves 
retrained, eh?
  You ever been in a mall that wasn't even 1/10th full?
  What did you tell yourself on the way out?
  What's that song at the end of "Boys In The Hood?"
Something reggaeish about things are gonna get better and
easier.


         ~30~

Check-mate

  Marceline Lasater
  reprinted from Map Of Austion 
  Poetry Cybermagazine

Six children
played chess
at three boards.

Yours at one
Mine at another

The Big Boys
grabbed the globe.

I saw pitiful moves
with paltry pawns

gearing up
for action.

In none of the games
did I ever see
a queen

consult her king
match her stride
to his limitation

spread her legs
or scream

I saw freed Queens
scatter strategy

enjoin advance
with presence.

I saw kings cowered
in corners

safe in squares
wet with fear

and Queens
quietly took over.
