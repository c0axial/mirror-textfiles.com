ATI,
I would like to supply your ezine with a free article

in regards to internet marketing.

Hi Michael,
I'm typing this in from "Cash" Johnny Cash's newest 
autobiography. I think he's written about 3 of them.
    page 189
     I've also been playing with my Tibetan singing bowl, 
which has its own wonderful world of sound. It's made of 
seven different kinds of metals - gold, silver, brass, 
bronze and metals from the meteorites that land intact 
on the mountain peaks of the Himalayas, where there's less
atmosphere than anywhere else on earth to burn them up 
before impact. The bowl produces the most amazing variety 
of sustained, unearthly tones. It comes with an instrument, 
wrapped in chamois leather, resembling the kind of pestle 
you use to crush corn or rock salt in a mortar. You rub that
around the rim - how fast and hard you rub determines the 
pitch and intensity of the tone the bowl produces - and then 
you put your face down into the bowl and listen. It feels 
like hearing a pipe organ in a cathedral. It's a wonderful 
tool for taking me to another, more peaceful place.

South Dakota Peace and Justice Center will be sponsoring a
host drum and an indigenous delegation to the Nov. 21 and 22
national witness action against the US Army School of the 
Americas. 
  Indigenous persons from Indian country throughout South
Dakota are invited to represent their communities during the
two-day event. 
  "Fort Benning will never be the same after experiencing the
power of the drum on the base perimeter," Dr. Paul Robertson,
an Oglala Lakota College faculty member who will accompany
the delegation, said.
  Robertson said it is important for indigenous in the United
States to be in solidarity with indigenous in Latin America
at the November protest. "I think a strong indigenous delegation
from here can enter history as a critical influence toward 
shut-down of the School of Assassins."
  A few bus seats will be available for non-indigenous, who will 
be asked to pay a modest bus fee. For more information, contact
the South Dakota Peace and Justice Center, P.O. Box 405, Watertown,
S.D. 57201

For Hate
   a poem by Marco Capelli
 
There's no room in my
Heart for hate.
I'm a poet here, sure;
Hear the beat?
 
I'm a human not an ist
Have a heart man.
Artist yeah. Fine, whatever
Still gotta eat.
 
Have a heart,
There's no room in my
Art for hate
Hear the music.
 
How sweet - 
There's no hate
In my heart
No room.

Lady Bug, Lady Bug
Hide away here.
You're safe when you're near me.
No need to fear.
 
Can't speak for my neighbors,
But I'll take you in.
I own no fly-swatter.

The spiders fared well here
They managed to thrive.
It's none of my business
If you're dead or alive.
 
Lady Bug Lady Bug:
What do you mean?
What's your metaphor
Aphid or queen?
 
Can't speak for my neighbors
But you're safe near me.
