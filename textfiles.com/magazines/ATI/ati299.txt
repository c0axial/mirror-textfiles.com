This Brings Us Back To United Fruit Days, Doesn't It?

We knew we were getting a war pResident this year.
  We should have known just HOW bad it was going to
be when Bush's only big concern was how much an enlisted
man was getting paid and what benefits were available.
This issue was more important to him as he articulated
it, than anything else brought forward. 
  Of course Bush AND Gore were both scrambling toward
that feeding trough. Clinton had just raised the salary
from 250,000 to 400,000 a year.
  The only difference I think between Gore and Bush would
have been where the war was going to be. With Gore we get
Colombia; with Bush we get the middle east.
  This was going to be a war year whether we liked it or 
not. 
  Now what?
  Who knows. Repression is thicker than its ever been in
the history of humankind. For that should we thank those
Republicans? 
  Somehow I can't tell. Would a democrat have been this 
fascist about things? 
  Perhaps more. Perhaps in more subtle ways. We must never
lose sight of the fact that Bill Clinton elevated the police
state to epic proportions. Perhaps in ways that Reagan/Bush
could never have imagined.
  In fact, if you look at this from a "police state" point 
of view there has been NO pendulum swing. It has just been 
a steady climb from Nixxon's time on up to the present day.
  Oh no, you'll say, I'm also attacking the movement's darling,
Mr. Jimmy Carter. Good ol' Habitat For Humanity Carter. Don't
get me wrong I respect the man. I always have. There are two
sticking points in his career however for me, where I cannot
see him as much more than an agent of the gradually increasing
police state.
  He wants the School Of Americas to continue operating as is.
And when he called Jane Fonda "that commie bitch" in front of
his own camera people and assorted other Habitat volunteers,
I got pissed. Not so much directly at his dislike of Fonda. You
want my honest opinion I think Fonda should be tried right next
to Senator McCain in a world court for human rights violations.
Maybe she's wrong, maybe not. We'd sure find out.
  No, I was mad at his simplistic view. Here's a man who used
to be President of the United States. Spooks and death squad
leaders, advisors and diplomats at his disposal 24/7 he could
ask serious questions of and get serious answers. You'd think
he'd be just a little bit more intelligent than, "that commie
bitch."
  So he's an idiot of the police state. "Just tell me what to
say, tell me where to stick my grin."
  I've seen it climb steady since I was a little kid. Rhenquist
becoming chief justice, Clinton picking Lloyd Bentson as his
oil-baron, er uh, I mean chief economic advisor. 
  Globalism is now finally rearing its big ugly head with the SOA
as the training force of the world police that will be enforcing
this Gatt/Nafta/NewWorldOrder on steroids thing we'll have to 
call the worldominatrix or something. But did it appear overnite?
Does anyone remember Operation Night Train? Does anyone remember
Louis Guiffria running FEMA's California chapter and Reagan making
him head of FEMA for the whole Untied States? FEMA, yes, I remember 
fema, and it's playing hot and heavy in national politics during 
this "War On Terrorism" which I'd prefer to call "War Using 
Terrorism."
  Ah, FEMA. 
  This brings us back to United Fruit.
  Small world; big peanuts.

In this time of national crisis, amid calls for sacrifice, I'm truly
troubled by some of the choices of the Republican party leadership. 
Here's their idea of an economic stimulus package:

  $1.4 billion for IBM
  $833 million for General Motors
  $671 million for General Electric
  $572 million for Chevron Texaco
  $254 million for Enron

This is war profiteering, and it's simply wrong.  Yet the House has
just approved it, on a virtual party line vote, ending the recent
spirit of bipartisan cooperation in Congress. 
Will you please join me in speaking up, before the Senate acts?

Castro says letters being tested for anthrax
By Lucia Newman for prime anarchist world newz 2nite
PAWN Havana Bureau Chief	
HAVANA, Cuba (PAWN) -- In a nationally televised speech Friday, 
Cuban President  Fidel Castro said more than 170 letters containing 
suspicious substances had  been sent to his country, and 24 of them 
were being tested for anthrax.
  The others, he said, were determined not only to be not dangerous,
"but really really tasty."
  Castro said the letters had been sent from all over the world, as 
far away as Pakistan and Sweden, and that most of them bore the blue
and gold US State Dept seal.
  Of the 24 letters, 22 were addressed to Castro, and had yellow stickers
with the little poision yuck faced guy on the front. Notes were in most
of them with the words "assassination attempt # ___" on the top. Castro
said he plans to outlive even this recent barrage from the U.S. Government.
  "You can't kill me," Castro said, "I'm too busy."

Associated Press Thrives Desspite Flunking 4th 5th AND 4th Grade.
By JON NOODLE, PAWN Sports Writer
LOS ANGELES (PAWN) - "Magic Johnson Thrives Desspite HIV" read
the finished copy. My editor didn't find it, nor did the publisher.
The entire Associated Press just got fired by Norman Minetta.
  I'm cleaning out my office as we speak. Thought I'd send you
this story. My last AP filing I guess. I made a typo, I'll have
to remember "I before e, except after ssssssssssssssssseeeeeee."
Only one s in despite, snake and CNN.
  Maybe Reuters'll take me.



"Why me? Why, after being the man the United States
could count on, did I become the enemy? Because I said
no. No to allowing the United States to run a school

to the request that Panama be used as a staging base
for the Salvadoran death squads and the Nicaraguan
Contras. Lots of no's."

Rumors sweeping through the conference halls suggest that 
the world's most famous and feared intelligence operatives 
have been registered as part of the official national 
delegations to the WTO.
  Understandably, the Americans, who have dispatched three 
warships with 2,100 marines to anchor off the Qatari capital 
for the duration of the summit, have shown the most paranoid 
tendencies.

U.S. Sailor Falls Overboard
Updated: Wed, Nov 07 11:20 PM EST

(Greece? Rome? Turkey? No One's Talkin') - A search and rescue 
operation was under way Wednesday night for a U.S. sailor who 
fell overboard from an aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea.
The sailor fell from the USS Kitty Hawk at 7:22 a.m. EST and a
seach was begun immediately, said Navy Lt. Cmdr. Don Sewell, a
Pentagon said. Repeated helicopter searches and several dives 
found no sign of the sailor.
  "We don't know how long the search is going to continue at 
this point," Sewell said late Wednesday night. "But we are still
proceeding as though the sailor is alive."
  It was not known how the sailor fell overboard, Sewell said.
The Kitty Hawk is supporting the U.S. effort in Afghanistan.

I was driving about 65MPH when I heard on 91.9 that he
died. You could say I was going about 66 and it was 92 on
the radio, eh?
