There's a guy typing at a fold-up keyboard on a PDA.
Freaky, it's practically a laptop. 

Freakier still:

In the very next booth two grrls play chess with the 
largest pieces I've ever seen in Milwaukee. 8" tall
each piece. Or the Queens are maybe 10" even. Wood
blocks. 
  Quite a contrast to the guy with the "laptop," eh?

YIKES! dARPA Seems To Have Just Released A Sinister Plan
Which I Don't See How Anyone Could Be Proud Of As A "Life's
Work. 

Jasmine Strong writes the following about it at Global IMC. 

The US defence research agency, DARPA, today announced its 
strategic long-range plan. It made worrying reading. The DARPA 
was required to release a long term plan under Senate Report 
107-151's accountability program.
  In clarifying DARPA's mission there was palpable doubt from 
the management of DARPA over the future of the agency. It points 
out: "None of the most important weapons transforming warfare 
in the 20th century -- the airplane, tank, radar, jet engine, 
helicopter, electronic computer, not even the atomic bomb -- 
owed its initial development to a doctrinal requirement or 
request of the military."
  That's all well and good- excepting that they got the 
history of the computer wrong- but the disturbing part comes 
next. DARPA states that it plans to automate the battlefield, 
developing autonomous 'swarms' of hunter-killer robots, robot 
tanks and killer drone aircraft.
  Perhaps this isn't too surprising; many militaries have 
wanted for quite some time to get their people out of the 
line of fire and telepresence would seem to be a good way 
of doing that. This, however, makes it effectively possible 
to fight a riskless land war, to march robots through the 
chemical and nuclear wastelands of a first strike. Worse, 
an autonomous robot army could present similar problems to 
landmines; how does one track down and deactivate them if 
they lose communication?
  More fundamentally, does the US really need to be any 
better at beating up smaller countries? It seems they're 
quite good enough at that already. If they can eliminate 
the last elements of risk on the battlefield then the only 
thing left to do is to fortify the country against terrorist 
attack and go on the rampage. What's more, it represents an 
escalation in telerobotic warfare. In a war between two robot 
armies, the only people who stand to die are the civilians.
  The "assured use of space" is the next worrying topic. The 
five-pronged approach to the problem of other people having 
satellites includes a new "rapid small-payload launch vehicle", 
which sounds awfully like a missile capable of reaching 
synchronous orbit to me. "Space Mission Protection and 
Denial" is about stopping others from launching things 
towards orbit and "Space-based Engagement" is vaguely 
defined as extending the orbital capabilities already 
available to the military. The militarization of space 
represents another escalation in military capabilities.
  The scary stuff doesn't stop there. The second half of 
the report concerns longer-range research projects intended 
to prevent the human from becoming the "weakest link" in 
warfare, the disturbingly-titled "bio-revolution". They 
define this as "[exploiting] life sciences to make the 
individual warfighter stronger, more alert, more endurant, 
and better able to heal". This does not sound at all good. 
They cite direct neural interfaces to computers and military 
hardware as an example of this, but that doesn't add up; it 
seems more likely that their goals would be achieved through 
genetic modification or advanced pharmaceutical intervention.
  The military of the future doesn't sound like it would be 
much fun to be around.

Is there a new building being brought up to sell

Maybe we're just one purchase away from mass oblivion.
I feel like I'm in a worst episode from a bad sci fi

Let's see if I got this right.
If the war on communism seemed to just draw more
and more "communists" into this country, and the
war on drugs every bit more made drugs rampant
all around the nation, I'm absolutely frightened
over the side effects of this "war on terror."

IN HOLLYWOLLYOLLY NEWS: Britney Spears denies accusations
that she snorted cocaine at a beach nightclub called the
Crobar. Her lawyer is going to slap defamation lawsuits 
onto all 5 or 6 of her accusers including Star magazine 
and E!
  I mean how on earth would a grrl like Hitme Britney get
any, anyhow??? It's not like coke and heroine and stuff 
are readily available to actors and recording artists or 
anything...

N E W S F L A S H : 
NYammys Not Nearly As Boring As They Mighta - 
Film At 11.

Hello Simon my old friend,
I fin'ly sing with you again.
  
OK, I've got a pot of coffee brewing -- it's time to
watch the annual NYammys on TV.
  It's nice to see Garfunkel and Simon not lip synching.
They're singing live AND altering some of the harmonies
and even a couple words to their "Sound of Silence."
  I wonder who you have to pay (and what) to get permit
to do THAT.

Oh. Yeah. I called this year's caligulaic, bombastic, 
plastic, orgyastic, annual-post-superbowl-pre-war event 
NYammys. First I thought of calling it the Dammmys since
it's so damned. But it's also so overly NYC this year.
So NYammys it is. 
  My friend Jasmine, a recording artist in England says
maybe they should call it the Sonys.
  Common side effects are headache, nausea and abdominal
pain.
  Sheryl Crow's guitar strap read "No war" during her duet 
with Kid Rock, but her hair diplomatically obscured the 
"No" portion of her political statement. Really? I never
saw it. Maybe they airbrushed it out for my viewing. Or
used Claritin. Gone like Ashley Judd's nose-ring. They say
she had a peace-sign necklace on too. Maybe her neck-hair
obscured that too, or something.

So let me ask you. Madison Square Garden. What, was Radio
City Music Hall booked??
  Dustin Hoffman says for the first time in the NYammys' 
history it's hosted by no one except the people of New York.
  Hmmm. You mean they've tried to remove the commercial
from the rock? The biz from the muzic? Oh, you mean host
host, not sponsor host. I get it. Along with his announcement
there was a long period of time without ads OR sponsorship
announcements. I really started to think maybe the city
itself'd underwritten the event.

So Gwen Stefani comes out in a tight sportsbra with the
word "LOVE" stamped across it. And the drummer, well, he's
got a bra on too.
  She's got camo shorts. hmmm. And her gogo dancers seem
draped in some camo covering on over their shirts too. So
THAT's where the expression camisole comes from, it's camo
sole. I vote her most likely to do USO tour after USO tour 
after USO tour.
  Are they yelling "Lou," or are they booing Lou Reed? Hard
to tell.
  So Dustin's hosting? Or did he just come on early? Either 
way, how cool is that?
  Faith Hill, umm. Now, tell me how your band tonite can get
construed as "country?" You're like Pat Benatar meets Ozzie
Osbourne. Or Kiss maybe, with all the make-up you got on.
You're starting to get that Tammy Faye Baker look. Maybe
you've been hanging around with the McGraw-Hill Hills too
much, or something.
  Yeah, you can always count on James Taylor not putting on
too much makeup. Just the modest amount. Yeah.
  No offense to YoYoMa, but get bach to the Johann Sebastian
Back playing, dude. [sic.] I really enjoy and appreciate your 
sonatas and allemandes, valses and courantes but that background 
CallAndResponse stuff's gotta go. First of all, I only heard you 
about 3 times and that was only for a vibrato'd note or three 
each time. BB King you're not.
  And was I asleep, or what? Congrats to Johnny Cash for his 
11th career NYammy. I'm not sure what song it's for though, 
I haven't heard a peep from him all year really. 

So Jesse Harris wrote Nora Jones' hit eh? I think she's my 
favorite recipient this year -- the talented AND beautiful 
Norah Jones. She's proof that good things CAN come from 
nepotism every once in a blue moon, eh?
  And one other redeeming thing I must say about her. She
chooses to allow the writers of her songs be known. Too many
insist that their "supply closet" remain little more than 
ghost writers hell.
  Hmmm. I feel a parody coming on. To McCartney and Lennon's
"PaperBack Writer."
  I wanna be, a Beatles ghostwriter. Beatles ghostwriter.
Beatles gho... hey baby, hey baby hey. A Beatles ghostwriter.
  Wait, this just in. Norah Jones won rekkid of the year
AND album of the year. I know, lets top this for next
year, by adding CD of the year, Compact Disc of the 
year, recording of the year, AND TimeInTheStudio of
the year. 

"small signs against the impending war," wrote Newsday, 
"against Iraq throughout the ceremony. Flaming Lips singer 
Wayne Coyne wore a bandage on his face as a silent protest 
to the war. 'We're not supposed to talk about it, so I thought 
I would wear it to get people to think about peace -- no black 
eyes,' said Coyne, whose band won best rock instrumental 
performance for a track from its 'Yoshimi Battles the Pink 
Robots' album."
  "Forget about building a mystery," said Bonnie Raitt, 
"let's start building some peace." Overall there wasn't 
very much talk about the war. In fact it all seemed overly 
subdued and compressed. Limited, enveloped or wahwah peddled
maybe. Something tells me if you planned on saying something
political you were required to run it through a team of special
truth analysts or something. 
  Everyone in the "hip and withit" albeit corporate media is 
mentioning a thing or two about the Neptunes getting slighted 
by NARAS this year so I'll leave it at that. Nothing else from 
me here.

So is everyone going to thank Donnie Iner at Columbia or what?
First time around I thought it was Don Imus they were thanking.
Then it became more clear. But how DO you spell his name?
  Dixie Chicks got to thank Sony AND Columbia. Kewl. And their
dad. So is he Sony or Columbia? Maybe the Oscars and the NYammys
can have a corporate merger soon. We could call them the annual
GrouchPotatoAwardCeremony.

Lemme see if I've got this straight. Survivor is "frikkin
genius," and Justin Timberlake would like to grab Kylie's ass.
"Cop a feel," and "Girls Gone Wild," goes wrestling. Where are
we going with all this besides war, decadence and mass oblivion? 

NYammys sponsored by dnL. Hahaha. Turn it around and that's 7up.
How clever. Now you're thinking. They've turned the cola world
on its ear.

So did the inside of Avril's sportcoat say "No War?" or what?
They refused to let us see it when she opened it up. That was
made demonstratively clear by the camera who stopped moving.
Not an inch. Filming behind her he was, the whole time. We're
censoring truth, can we be more obvious?

Mary Youngblood won the Native American category for "Beneath
the Raven Moon." The one single solitary NDN music award. So
who did she have to compete with, one artist from each different
style of music? Or perhaps. Carlos Nakai, Carlos Nakai, Carlos 
Nakai, Carlos Nakai, and Carlos Nakai...

"I hope we're all in agreeance," said Fred Durst, "this war
should go away."
  P Diddy. What was your name again? I think I'll change my
name each year, to Marc Diddy, then Muff Eddy, then M. Fuddy.

Looks like Target's gonna try and trademark (tm) red (tm).
What the hey. Pepsi's already got blue (tm) who wants white?
Oh yeah, that's Cheney and Ashcroft already.
  I think I'll write an ad with a fireman in it. That'll get
me an Emmy for sure! Like a knife in warm butter. Can you say
pander? Can you say jingoistic?

Star Search is back. Run To The Hills!!! Number of the beast!
So which mafia don will host these ones?

Robin Williams intros Bruce Stringbean and the D Fleet Canned.
Hmm, do you think Robin stopped snorting coke about the same
time George W Bush did? Though it's nice to see Little Steven 
in EStreet again. He's been sorely missed out there thinking 
he's TVLandia all that.
  Am I imagining it or the older Bruce gets the more he looks
like Mojo Nixon? Well, I should tell ya, someone needs to get 
ol' "Stevie V" a mic of his own. He keeps trying to borrow
everyone elses'.
  Ah cool. Erika Badu came out in a Dead Prez t-shirt and
whoa girl. your fro makes me think of Link in the Mod Squad.

Who the heck is Alan Cumming? He looks like Pee Wee Herman. 
OK, from a songwriter's point of view I must complain with no 
disrespect intended. Ashanti's tune about dreaming is very empty. 
Devoid of... well, devoid of everything. She got the operatic 
pronunciation of "dweems" almost as good as a Stevie Nicks or 
a Bob Dylan, but come on. Everything else about the song really 
sucks. It was just so bland. Inspirational my ass. That inspires 
me to go watch paint dry. Drink some geritol or cod liver oil.
Or watch the NYammys.

"Their sold out one night only TOUR." --Ed Bradley about the Bee 
Gee(s) - a one-nite tour - is that like a 4th book in a trilogy?
  NSinc actually made some real melodies into a real medley though,
neat. Good work. Makes me think they're getting less hate-able with
age.

Woah, triple woah. There are at least 4 (count 'em four) grrls
in the first two rows who look exactly like Chelsea Clinton.
That's downright frightening.

"All ahead, as the 45th annual..."

[cut off by something much more urgent, right? A frikkin
Mastercard "priceless" ad.]

I coulda waited, ya know...

--marco

ps: nope. turns out, Avril's jacket flaps said "rock on." 
Maybe the censors were just afraid it was going to say
"raw on" or nowar backwards. That stiff frozen camera
was oh so obvious, wasn't it?
