ATI 340! For the week ending tomorrow or

PUBLISHIARY COLUMNIARY

You prolly noticed something extra "under your
tree" this year.
  Something really neato. Keen. 
  Yeah, that's right. Counting this issue, you
got three (count em 3) editions of ATI. Activist
Tiactivist Iactivist.
  Mumbo jumbo. That's a lot o' rant, ramble, raving
writing and parithmetic. (the PA is silent) Yup.
That's because there's much to say, lots to do. and 
mega bigtime hella lot to share. 
  I've also had six (count em 6) people ghostwriting
this month. A couple will continue on, but the rest 
are done until summer or so, they say. I bet they 
don't come around until next year though.
  Either way, I think that's a record here. Truth
be told, aTi has never been written by more than
three or four people at a time. And in our 13-year
history I must say most weeks have gone by with
this one lonely little old me to write, edit AND
publish, save for the occasional "letted" or #s 
RUN URL submission. 
  At any rate, things welled up so much by mid-Dec
we decided to put out 3-in-a-row as close to the 
day they call "XMas" as possible. So here's the 3rd 
of 3. 
  Enjoy.
  Could we sustain this kind of behavior? 2 or 3 per
week? Hells no. But could this be the sign of a shift
toward a 2X / wk schedule? Wrong again. No way. 
  Nah! Just there's so much coming in -- much needs
to go out, and you know I don't like to edit things 
down too tiny, or very much at all, eh? Brings us back 
to the "weekly" periodicity. About 4-a-month. Fairly
close-tuned to the lunar fazes. I mean phases. Er uh,
er, I mean phrases.
  Word.

HALF-PRICE GIFTWRAP ONLY AT ATI

Yeah, yeah, we know. 
  50% of zero is 0. Sure. Go ahead. You know
you wanna.
  Print out this 'zine, get some scotch tape
and wrap up a belated gift for someone.
Yes, give them homemade ATI "newsprint" giftwrap. 
Washington's economy won't thank you, but worry 
not! Mr. Housekeeping (ekonomos) is an ingrate

  a poem by marco

59 beads is a rosary
33 is the same but anglican
33 or 99 makes muslimism they say
108 is the hindu mala
And it is said that 27,
54 or 108 beads make you a buddhist.

Gee is it any clearer?
That we are each left with 
Just a few pieces of the 
Whole truth.

The Weekly Column On Violence In The Untied States

Yesterday, I saw Bowling For Columbine again.
  My second time. This doesn't mean much to this
column in the grand scheme of things, but I just
thought I'd mention this as the documentary asks
some of the same questions you and I do.
  
QUESTION: Of Child Husbandry

Is four minutes a proper time-out? 
  And is 4+ moving toward being seen as abuse?
  Is time-out in a corner, a bathroom floor or a
currently unoccupied room proper for a timeout? 
But is a closet abuse? Especially if you lock the 
door, right? 
  Where do parents and "careworkers" draw these
lines, and where do children? How about child-advocates
and how about the state? We really need to ask these
questions "aloud" don't we?
  When is an egg-timer therapy, and when is it a subtle
form of torture? What exactly *IS* a timeout anyways,
and how many times a day is still "effective?"
  Did Jack the Ripper have timeouts? And how about
Timothy McVeigh? Did Benjamin Spock do timeouts? Mr.
Rogers? Captain Kangaroo? 
  George W. Bush?
  Baby Bush. I'll leave it at that.

A SHORT NOTE FROM THE GLICK BOOK

In Berkeley, California in the late 1960s, activists used
whistles, noisemakers, and spotlights to ward off FBI and
police harrassment. When law enforcement personnel entered
an area, the first person to spot them would alert other 
activists in the vicinity. Soon dozens of people were 
gethered around the intruders, blowing loud whistles,
shining bright lights on them, and demanding that they
leave. The effect was to ridicule the FBI and police and
undermine their intimidating mystique. Activists had fun
in the process, and gained a sense of their collective
power.

Meeting Daily, US Nerve Center Prepares Terrorists

(PAWN) NORAD, Colorado - At about 8:45 most mornings
in a conference room deep inside a mountain, the CIA,
FBI, and a dozen other 3 & 4-letter agencies meet to
debate how the Pentagram should respond if the whole
ship leaks and sinks too much.
  Four Star General Phillip R Eberhard throws out
doomsday scenarios for a new wave of attacks easily
blamable on Al Queda, or some other GOT (group-of-terror)
such as the Daschle-Feingold Brigade (nicknamed Dirty
Buggers or DFB) or the dreaded Simbiotic Leiberation 
Army.
  For up to an hour each day in what is blandly called
"The Commander's Situational Attitudinal Maintainance
Meeting" (or C-SAMM for short) General Eberhardt asks
representatives of the 14 agencies (that we're allowed
to discuss) a roster that includes DOS, NSA, NASA, NAUSA,
the FAA, the FASA, and the FAUSA, essentially everyone
EXCEPT FEMA (yes, FEMA's never there. Repeat, FEMA's
never there. Do you hear me? FEMA is NOT there every
morning.) for updates from their experts and advice on
what if the worst happens. 
  There are boxes of alka-seltzer in each hallway along
with Pain-Aid (TM) and Aspirin (TM) and the brand new
Eli Lillies (Also TM) and a psychotherapist sits in a
front lobby Info-Booth that strongly resembles Lucy from
the Peanuts cartoon.
  Eberhard says he is sensitive to the concerns of Civil
Liberties and that he would respond to a terrorist attack
ONLY IF the White House and Pentagram tell him it's O.K.
  "We understand Civics101," he said. "I really don't 
think based on those checks and balances, that we're 
going to get into a situation where the military will be
doing something they shouldn't."

DEPART MENT: Store Blues
  A story in three parts. 
1) ati 340
2) ati 341
3) ati 342


  I shopped at Caldor the other day.
  I bought three things; all from different departments.
  I always like giving Caldor my money even though the 
original owners sold it many years ago; back in the 80's 
I'm told. Carl and Deloris Bennet live comfortably now
somewhere in western Connecticut. One of the managers 
at the Norwich store tells me they're doing well. Just
your typical retired old people, I guess.
  Once when I was young I went to the Groton Caldor 
wearing a shirt and tie; and I filled out a job application. 
Those were the days when you didn't need a resume to land
minimum-wage jobs. But a young man was always assured that 
a tie gave him a "shoe in."
  I honestly don't know if it was a manager or an owner 
who took my application, but she directed me into her 
office saying it just happened to be a slow moment and 
if I was willing she could interview me right away. She 
offered me coffee and I obliged. I honestly didn't know 
how I liked coffee yet, so I asked for it "with everything."
  All went well with the interview until she got to the 
line about my date of birth. Yes it was my 14th birthday. 
She wished me a happy birthday and explained to me that 
by law she couldn't hire me for another two years.
  She said I was a very nice charming determined young man, 
and that she was certain I would do quite well for my self 
in all of life. If I came back in a few years, I had her 
word that she would personally find me a job somewhere 
within the company. 
  I thanked her, shook her hand, held up my face until I 
left the building and then cried all the way home.
  I never took her up on that job offer two years later 
as I'd ended up working at a local Elks Club that paid 
twice the minimum wage. Cash! And a year early, but I
won't go there in THIS story.
  A year later I found out at a family reunion while my 
father was picking on me for what I'll always remember 
as "that Caldor moment," that my grandmother used to 
buy fruit from Deloris Bennet back during the depression. 
Lots of fruit. My grandmother supported my grandfather's 
two failing clothing stores by selling apples in front of 
factories during shift changes and breaks. Her philosophy 
was, "If they can't afford anything else, they should at
least buy fruit."
  "You actually knew Carl Bennet?" I asked my grandfather.
  "Knew him?" he said. "I helped him open the clothing 
departments to all his stores years ago."
  When my grandfather sold his three clothing stores back 
in the 70's, you could say he went on to live and die 
comfortably in Pawtucket and Warwick, Rhode Island. I'll 
never forget when my 9th grade prom was coming up and my 
grandfather looked me up and down and said "38 short." 
No tape measure or anything. Grampa still "had it." 
That was long after he'd sold off his stores. One became a 
chain of "Gentleman's Wearhouses," and the others are still 
in Warwick and Providence run by children of some of his 
original partners.
  My dad took me to Anderson Little outfitting me a really 
cool light brown corderoy 3-piece suit. "36 medium," the 
salesman said measuring me with tape. He tried a few suits 
on me and they looked almost right in the mirror, but never 
felt right.  (CON'T Next Issue)


ANALYSIS: Lies Don't Figure; Music Figures Don't...

AP says best-selling albums for '02  *WERE* by 

Eminem
Nelly
Avril Lavigne 
Dixie Chicks
8Mile Soundtrack
Pink
Ashanti
Alan Jackson
O BrotherWhereArtThou
Shania Twain

Hmm. Only four of these sound the least bit familiar
to me, and I listen to, play, write and record music
all day, every day.
  What's wrong with this picture?
  Best selling according to who? Is this dollar returns
for each artist? Some for each corporation? Each major
label?? Or is this perhaps based on how much each 
artist's PR department budgets for a year's worth of
"Product Recognition?"
  Is this how much was bought anywhere in the world,
just the US? One state like NY or L.A.? Or perhaps
only one store?
  And since there's still four days left to the year,
I should ask if this isn't only part of a year, like did
they poll just a coupld stores for a couple days? Weeks?
  And since the album publishing season really only goes
from like mid-Sept til about late Dec, I would have to
ask out loud whether this didn't just reflect Christmas,
Chanuka, Kwanzaa sales?
  So who does AP claim made this year-end "Top 10?"
  Nielsen SoundScan.
  Figures.



VOTER ALERT:

If Hillary runs I might vote (for her).
  If she picks Liebensheizahozen though, I
will definitely not. Frankly, I've no room 
in my heart for fascism, no matter which
ethnic group it eminates from.
  Clinton gave the "radio address" retort
yesterday. Didja hear it? Me either. But I
sure did read about it, thank you very much.
It was big news everywhere. Didn't you notice?
It's her first radio addy, according to the
AP. APparrently you must ask permission of the
democrats to do this. Since when do you need
permit to key a mic? (DON'T ANSWER THAT!) So
she's going to get a lot of mileage out of 
saying she's definitely not running for
pResident the next few months.
  I predict she makes it official March 1.
