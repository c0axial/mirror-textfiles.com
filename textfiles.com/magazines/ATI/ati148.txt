In this issue:
    1) Prime says what Americans are afraid to verbalize.
    2) Noriega disappears
    3) Bob Dylan and Michael Jackson both "leave the building,
          ladies and jennemen..."
    4) Clinton Resigns himself to running the country.
    5) Soto punches Steinbrenner in the nose. (OK no, but don't
          we wish?)
 
Greetings Phellow Peoploids. I'm Prime Anarchist and here you can
reed my weakly collum.
 
Little by little it's coming out that the Guatemalan military might 
have had something to do with Bishop Gerardi's death this spring
  [ed note: see ATI126, and 145)
   Um, what took you so long??? I could've told you the Sunday it
made world news. (hesitate saying "the sunday it happened" because
certain justice officials are TOO STUPID TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER IT
HAPPENED SATURDAY NITE OR SUNDAY MORNING. Perhaps the lowest roots
of the coverup???) 
   Repression has grown thick and swift like so many cancers here 
in the Americas. And I ask this with all my heart. All fear aside,
because there is no time for hesitation.
           What  will  come
          of us when Willie
          Jefferson  Blythe
          Clinton announces 
          that  he  refuses
          to leave  oriface?
   Am I the only one who sees this? Must I always seem like Chick
Little or Wolf Boy right up to each moment I give-away my option 
to Bragg (sic) "I-told-you-so?"
   Let me speak even less equivocally than a George Bush or a Ross
Perot. The parallel face to repression is consumerism and I guess
I'll just have to stay the "ugly prophet" on this once again.
   They go hand in hand and if you don't notice it, you're buying
too much.
   Literally AND figuratively.
   Gerardi was a threat to the powers that be. Yes, but he was more
a threat to the societal movement I will call "Buy-Trash-Repeat."
His liberation theology was that of slowing down, getting right
with the higher power and questioning whether that right-getting 
should involve usury, slavery, rape, murder, or "what-have-you."  
   Like Romero, he went down for talking sanity, simplicity, living
light, needing less.
   Had he been talking violent overthrow, he would've posed less a 
threat; for we can fund that.

"The Best Free Things" by Linda & Bob Kalian, (dewey 011) 
in my local library.
   How's your library doing?
 
[ed note: funny you should ask. read on...]
 
journal note: 1st friday, 
oct. 98 (in the year of our monika)
police are here in 
the library busting truants
and I have that gestapo
feeling.
  do the words jackbooted 
thugs come to mind? did 
you ever skip school and 
go to the library?
  i didn't 
  I have a gut feeling
some people, no most people,
can learn more in their
local libary, than in their
school.
  especially the last two decades,
of dumbness. 
  Can we figure out some way of 
honoring that kind of truancy?
or is our system so 
big ugly and mean now
that we're going to have
to wait until death
shows us it's too late?

Dear Marco Capelli,
I saw your entry in Social Justice E-Zine Guestbook, 
and thought you or a friend might be interested in this site.
"Address Directory of the Worlds' Politicians" at:
http://www.trytel.com/~aberdeen/
Contact info for presidents, prime ministers, & provincial 
governors for all 194 countries. Phone, fax, and e-mail 
for these office holders being included where possible.
You'll find this webpage to be an excellent resource for any 
international letter writing, lobbying/advocacy campaign.
Best regards,
Donald Vermithrax (613)
 
Hey dude-
Thanks for the zines, great stuff. Been pretty busy, as usual. Where 
are you now? Wisconsin again? You sho' do move around a lot. Come out 
and visit in Seattle some time. I'll be spending some time in San 
Fran soon, we open ENTROS SF Nov. 18. I disagree with the woman 
looking for no Clinton zone. I think Clinton deal is totally 
different from MJ or OJ. Plus, I think the shit is funny. Have you 
seen Larry Flynt's letter to Ken Starr, excellent, old junkie's still 
got it. Keep up the good work.
see ya in the funny papers

Subject: A White House Song
         ------------------
Twas the night before crisis,
And behind White House doors,
Not a creature was stirring,
Especially Al Gore.
 
The interns were nestled,
Dressed in their berets,
In hopes that Saint Bubba
Would come out to play.
 
When on the East Lawn,
There arose such a clatter,
Even Sam Donaldson
Lost control of his bladder.
 
Away to our TVs
We flew like a flash,
There's a special report,
And it's pre-empting M*A*S*H!
 
And what to our wondering
Eyes should appear,
But a homely lil' troll,
With tapes for us to hear.
 
With a K-Mart bought blazer,
And a bad frizzy 'do,
And a tale to be told-
To me, and to you.
 
On the chair! On the carpet!
On the Oval Office desk!
with a chubby young intern,
Who was all eyes and chest.
 
The Pres had been careless,
Indeed, dumb and dumber.
Now the whole world knew
Bubba had gotten a hummer.
 
And Monica Lewinsky
Emerged from the rubble,
If she'd just kept her mouth shut,
We'd not have all this trouble.
 
And thus set into motion,
A whole web o' spiders,
With pundits galore,
And White House insiders.
 
You ask, "Who would care
About Bill and his penis?"
Well, Republican Ken Starr,
And he's armed with subpoenas!
 
More rapid than eagles,
Process servers, they flew!
"Here's one for you!
And for you! And you, too!"
 
"Now Jordan! Now Cockell!
Is there anyone else?!?
Let's subpoena the lawyers!
And Bubba himself!!"
 
"We want you to tell us
 About Bill's private life,
 And anyone he sleeps with,
 'cept, of course, his wife."
 
And many months later,
After long we've all suffered,
Let's examine more closely
Just what Starr's uncovered.
 
We've learned "Little Bill"
Has a mind of his own,
And - horror of horrors -
He likes to get blown!
 
A funny fact surfaced,
After 40 million bucks:
Seems most people don't care
Just who Clinton, er, makes love to.
 
The econoy's great,
And shows no signs o slowing.
Hell, we hope Ms. Lewinsky
NEVER stops blowing!
 
Now the public's grown weary.
Will this sleaze never end?
We just want to get back
To "E.R." and to "Friends."
 
Now Monica, Linda-
And Ken Starr, you suck -
Get the hell off my TV,
Your 15 minutes are up.
 
[ed note: methinks it was the 
"get the hell off my TV" that
got my attention and kept it]
 
 
Marco,
Keep 'em coming. It's like Neuromancer, I'll learn the 
language by the end of the book.
Regards,
Null

<press release>
Titletown Brewery --- At this year's "Street Fair," this outstanding
local brew pub, owned by Brent Weycker and John Gustafson, donated
their beer sale proceeds to Clean Water. Brew master Bob Bultman
also donated his time at the tap.
   It was very generous of them, and of course, we enjoyed sampling
and contributing to the donations ourselves.
   The brewery owners said they made the donation because "we can't
make good beer without clean water."

Now for a special announcement:
          (reprinted from ATI43)
 
RC Cola drinkers, unite.
Boycott Pepsi.
 
     Wayne Calloway, Pepsico's Chairman also sits on Exxon's 
Bored of Directors. Exxon and Pepsi are both bad on the 
First Ammendment (not to mention the environment! -GZ). 
Pepsico's address is Purchase, NY 10577; 
fone number is 914-253-2000.
(prime note: haven't verified the # yet, anyone know? 
ok, I'm trying now... please hold...
..
..
..
       <yes>)
 
Suggestions:
1. Light up their switchboard.
2. Tear up your Exxon card.
3. Don't buy Exxon gas or other products.
4. Tape or crazy-glue all Pepsi vending machines.
5. Write "Pepsi Boycott" in the street in front of major 
   sidewalk promotions.
6. Jam Pepsi ads on your local TV station 
   (We're not in the Max Headroom days
   yet! -GZ)
7. Buy your grocer's homemade colas.
8. Get the Coke recipe and brew your own.
9. Start drinking iced tea.
10. Hi-jack a Pepsi truck and and drive it off a cliff 
(dress up like an Indian or a Coke deliveryman).
11. Call your operator and pose this rhetorical question: 
"On your next break will you drink a Pepsi, which stands for 
censorship, or will you participate in the boycott?"
So next time you want to make the choice of a New Generation, 
pop open a Royal Crown.
GZ's note: Don't forget other Pepsi products, like Slice. 
If in doubt, check the can or label.
 
 
While we're at it:
A reprinted letter from the FEB '82 TAP/YIPL magazine:
Dear People of TAP,
  A collegue of mine and I recently recieved all of the TAP(YIPL)
back issues. They are very hard to put down (like a good book).
Even though some of the material is almost a decade old, it is 
still very refreshing. Many of the past issues have some harsh
language directed at subscribers to get them to contribute in some
way. This tactic is justified. Consider the work, time, energy, and
motivation it took (and still does) to produce such material. No
matter what we are charged (within reason) we are getting a bargin.
If it weren't for Abby, Al, Tom, etc., we the consumers of this 
invaluable informational service, would just be sucking our thumbs.
Organization is the key to power, and that is what TAP does. I am
a computer programmer & engineer at a midwestern University. At 
present I am constructing a small computer that will do "everything."
I still have some more reading to do to find out what "everything" is.
It shall be called the "OMNI BOX." Considering what it will do it will
be small. There is a lot of work and debugging that will have to be
done. Be patient, I will have it by Christmas '81; and when I do,
it will be yours.
Thanks for existing
        (This letter was unsigned)
