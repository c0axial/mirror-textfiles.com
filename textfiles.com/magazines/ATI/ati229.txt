Hey there, hi there, ho there.
Prime tellin' ya: I can finally tell the difference between Hitme
Spears and Handme Moore. It's like just getting to know two
identical twins who go to your highschool. Only they don't sound
quite as much like the members of NSync.
  I was checking out a bargain bin for some used computer software,
just a 'cause you never know what you'll find, right? I spy with my
little eye two programs right next to each other. One is Ashton Tate's
dBaseIV still shrink-wrapped for sale, one dollar US takes it. The
other is Paper Clip III for C64/128 for a buck. And in music notes,
I saw Melanie's "Gather Me" for a buck, but I had to pass it up.
Warped. Too much for the roll of masking tape trick even! I walked
all the way home like a disgruntled little boy with his bottom lip
sticking out. Oh well, you shoulda seen the one that got away, as
they say.
  Discussing his book "Gods Go Begging," Alfredo Vea quoted Studs
Terkel calling the US, the "United States of Amnesia." Now that's
news.
  If anyone wants a good deal on Bruce Springsteen albums (we're 
talkin' vinyl here, although I'll bet the CD's aren't too far behind)
go to your nearest Goodwill, St. Vinney's or Sally's! I mean it, man.
I was shopping for other records and there's pile after pile of Boss
stuff. Quite a shift from years past, you couldn't find a used Boss
for 20$ american! Now they're three for a dollar? Hmmm. People are
clearin' out their stash or what??
  [pub note: read the news, you're watching a reactionary moment for
sure. Be glad there's not the sudden 55-gallon drums full of napalm!]
BOOT LEG -=- The new 20's look like foodstamps. It took me 'til
now - June 11, 2000 - 11am to find out what bothered me all this
millenium so far.
  We are remaking the world counterfeit.
  Anti-trust against Visa and Mastercard - I know, let's go after
Coke and Pepsi next - and then while we're still high and strong
from victory we'll hit GOP and DP.
  Have any movies of note found any clever ways to compare and
contrast those metal detectors and headphones that walk around
after a weekend summer festival with turkey-vultures or some
other scavengers?
  If you don't read ATI how are you going to stay cool? Activist
Times, the coolest source, is not in any way affiliated with Arm
Strong -- unless you count recognizing their coolness.
  First thought upon noticing unrest in Fiji, Angola, Sierra Leone,
Vieques, Miami, Chiapas, Indonesia...

  It's a CIA year. Which middle-aged, pro-police-state white man are
YOU going to vote for?
JOURNAL NOTE - Wed 14 JUN - Noon fifteen, is any Salvation Army in
the country this very moment NOT tuned into Paul Harvey?
  Police Academy 7: Mission to Moscow. 7? Seven?!? Why was there even
a 3? 5! 7?? Must be a part they didn't wanna turn six competitors down
for, eh?
  Politically Less Correct: What does an Indian call a dozen "Anglos"
coming closer?
  Hithering Whites.

You have the most scatterbrained columns

are ticklish.
Molly Ringworm - Hax0r Xtra0rd! (206)


Hi Marco,
  I wanted to send out a note to people and organizations
affiliated with the Direct Action Network to say that I 
thought A16 was great, and I hope to participate in anything 
else people are working on that might call for rabble-rousing 
music. At recent events in DC I played a couple songs on the
stage at the permitted rally as well as a Saturday (A15) night
concert at the Wilson Center with other great musicians and
visual artists. Like some of the other artists there, I regularly 
perform at protests, conferences, and related events. On my website
http://www.davidrovics.com
I have links to other activist-oriented musicians from around
North America, as well as more info on me including a bio, a 
couple of essays I wrote, press reviews, and songs to listen to.
  I think there are many qualities of the developing movement that
represent a real advance from previous recent efforts. One is the 
broad, "multi-issue" perspective. Another is the grassroots,
democratic method of organization. Another has been the emphasis
on blending militant direct action with throwing a party. I think 
art, music and food are so important for maintaining and inspiring
the growth of a movement whose participants feel like they're part
of something that's alive. I hope that, in word and in deed, the
movement continues to reflect this perspective.
   Feel free to contact me to talk about incorporating a cultural
element into any event you may be organizing.
   Keep up the great work! Hope to see you on the road and in the
streets.
   All the best,
   David Rovics

Last nite I had the strangest dream
I'd ever dreamed before
I dreamed they'd closed the SOA
And put an end to war

This morning I woke to a fantasy
That happened before my eyes
The pentagon had changed into
A place making rhubarb pies.

I wrote this song at 2:08
When I was weary and tired
I hoped and prayed that one fine day
No more will have to die

I opened up my eyes to see
The tears fall on my guitar

But it's extra curriculum
I'll teach it in them halls inside
Simply put: war is just plain dumb

I opened up my eyes to see
The dream I'd seen before
They'd pulled the plaque sayin' SOA
And put up one sayin' what-re-we-fighting-for

_Stripes_

How come Romero and Gerardi
Had the same stripes across their
Faces upon death.

Romero - stripes across the face,
You can almost see the red 
In the b&w AP foto -
Stripes across his face from a
Bullet.

Gerardi - stripes across the face,
You can almost see the red
Though I've never seen any foto.
Stripes across his face from a
Large piece of cement.

Whose stripes are these really?
If not just a man's?
Why must we keep striping -

Prophets.

I PURCHASE TWO HARDCOVERS A YEAR: "LUNA" Is My First This Millenium
  by Marco Capelli

  Because of my chosen lifestyle I can't afford very many hardcovers.
So I have to devour the NY Times supplements and assorted other media
to help me decide what couple of books to buy each year. Frugal me,
I'm usually seen buying one in June, and one in November or so.
  Well, my first purchase of the year 2000 was Julia Hill's book. I
can't stress how awesome this book is, and my words could never
give it justice in snippet or review form, so I'm just going to clip
two paragraphs for you here: and shut up.

"Mickey Hart, formerly of the Grateful Dead, had hiked up the hill with
his drum and his core gorup of drummers, and he initiated the main
beat. Then everyone else mixed in with bodies and hands and
instruments and voices. There must have been a couple of hundred people
playing on drums and flutes and pots and pans and shakers and 
everything else imaginable. We celebrated the sustainable future
for everyone that we were working toward, and we celebrated our love
for life. It was really windy and quite cold that day, but looking
down on this wondrous scene, I felt wrapped in a warm blanket of love
and commitment.
  "To have Mickey Hart visit Luna, and to feel his energy and support,
was a big deal for me because I've always been a Grateful Dead fan
(though not a "DeadHead"). To say I was deeply honored by him and 
everyone else is an understatement!"
  From Julia Hill's book "The Legacy of Luna."

A QUICK LITTLE REVIEW OF THE BAND 22:9
on my way back from seeing Dar Williams in Duluth, 
I saw posters for this band somewhere. Threw it in 
the back of my mind maybe I'd hear them someday. 
Now thanks to "cyber space," I got to hear them 
sooner than later, eh?

& In Other News:
SONY ABSORBS WARNER-GANNETT
[PAWN]- Portland, ME - The sun was just coming up over the harbor
on a foggy Wednesday morning, when Alvin Neuhard looked out the
2nd of three picture windows in his office and saw a DVD player
roll into town. He didn't think anything of it at first because
it didn't look like much from afar.
  What he didn't know was just how massive this DVD player was
going to be, never mind look like.
  "It just kept coming," said Neuhard, owner of Warner-Gannett, a
small chain of news organs. He said it never stopped until it ate
up almost every newspaper in the nation, every TV and radio station,
every corn and soy field, every cow, goat, horse, llama "and a little
lamb."

CAMEL: Forgiveness Dances Through The Eye
 by marco

I don't point at all Christians
And I certainly can't blame Christ
For the fact:

Every murderer who's ever come to my attention
Calls his or herself "christian."

And I certainly can't pin it on Christ
But the fact remains:

Forgiveness
Like spitting through an eye
Sure is difficult as sin

Evaporation, Condensation, Precipitation

by Carol Snyder Halberstadt

They say
the water inside the Earth
calls the rain down,
and it answers.
They say
the clouds are people gathering.
This is the science of seeing
a way of knowing.
Look around you.
They say if you drain the Earth
and starve the rivers
the clouds will not answer,
and this is drought.
The water rises to feed the sky
that washes it
and returns anew,
like children.
Pay attention.
