Olive harvesting season is upon us. Are you ready?

"29 Year Old College Drop Out, 
On The Brink Of Financial Ruin,
Uncovers Secret Money System That 
Rakes In $55,247.25 In One Month..."







Listen, I feel honored that you feel you must 
to spam so many people with this half-true 
legend (or should I say true half-legend) 
about me from so long ago I get teary-eyed 
each time just reading between the lines.
  But listen, tell the rest of the truisms
along with it dammit.
  Inmediamente, I donated $12,000 to the NY 
Public Library, 15,230.50 to the Met, 25,432 
to the Ade Bethune CW Homeless shelter, and 
finally 280.43 to the Westerlymystonington 
Art Society in Connecticut.
  With what was left I bought a Trek Antelope 
mountain bike, a '76 Volkswagen Microbus, a Gibson 
LGO, an SG, an Epipone Caballero, 23 packs of 
guitar strings, a blank book journal, a hundred 
fifty copies of my album to sell along the way 
and about 6 months worth of gas and oil money.
  At which time I wandered about from Taos New
Mexico clear up to Moorehead, Minnesota for a
couple years singing songs about the broken
heartland to any small collective who would
hear them for about a breakeven price. Sometimes
free.

LETTUCE -

I apologize for the delay in getting back to you., 
but I just returned from a 30 day family vacation 
and found your e-mail waiting for me. I'm not sure 
I can answer all of your questions but they can 
probably be found at this link. As for the female 
version of Viagra it is called Vitacreme and yes 
it is the same stuff that Oprah was raving about. 
Here is their link. For all the free samples, I 
suggest you try this link. I hope I answered all 
of your questions. 

Stay well and God bless -

Sep 30 1970

The Presidential Commission on Obscenity and Pornography 
issues a 646 page report concluding that all sexually 
explicit films, books and magazines aimed at adults 
should be legalized. One publisher, William Hamling, 
sold 100,000 copies of the report with 546 additional 
"illustrations", for which he received four years prison 
time.


ATI Announces 2 new things!

Ready?
Next week, brace yourself. Newest issue will be
composed from a brand new (well, used, but new
to me, eh?) early pentium laptop. Should we use
word? wordpad? notepad? edit? We'll cross that
bridge when we get there.

And secondly, a new feature each week.

Titled "Live From Dahmer's House."
  We'll walk up the street over to where Dahmer
used to live, and sit on the sidewalk in front,
and break out a notebook, and write a few notes
about non-violence.


\DREAM\ 24sep02

...yeah, and how come they closed off port 79?

What do you mean, what's 79?

I got pages to pull down at 79 all the time.

Oh, you mean like 8079 or something?

I just type in 79.

  [keep in mind this is all going on over expensive
   non-fairtrade coffee at a Hyatt with some pimply
   16-year-old kid in a black "got root?" hat angry
   with us because s/he can't hack into indymedia the 
   way s/he wants to. I oughta tell him/her "be glad 
   we're like the only sysadmins left on the planet 
   who won't just drop an email to interpol the
   minute we see ya, U skript kidd33 dorkish dw33b.]

Hmmm. Dunno. Did you get it from port scanning or something?

Nunya. Nunya bizness, hahahaha...

You're talking to a sysadmin there, dork.

Never mind...

Wait, I'll tell you what happened without even lookin' over
logs or anything. I bet I know. You were sitting there hitting
this "port 79" and a techie goes "wtf is this dweeb doing in
port 79???" "what's it even do?" "dunno," "can't be good havin'
him here." "nuke it." But he prolly goes into IRC first and
says "anyone here in port 79?" "not me..." etc., then someone
says, "what's port 79 do anyhow?" "no clue." "can't be good
havin' him there," "that's what I was thinkin," "nuke him..."
But wait there's more, he prolly went to www-tech list and
put out a quick note, "anyone using port 79 for something
necessary, speak up quick or forever hold your winsock"

And then your ip addy was prolly offed to it.

   -----

I wake up from this all-too-real dream in a hurry to jump
on the net long before the obligatory first cup of coffee
and find out what port 79 is.

How ironic. I grew up where I-95 N goes East
and now I live where I-94 E goes South.

Is coffee supposed to taste this bad?? 
  I'm at a Mars Cheese shop along 94 somewhere.
Or was it Cheese World?
Although do I really care what they're called?
Not meaning any rudeness, really.

the political climate. Where do you turn for comfort
and strength at a time like this?

Phil, 52: During a typical work day, I'm in e-mail
contact with so many colleagues around the world that
it's easy to completely miss the people I share my
office with, and to blank out the world situation.
Ironic, isn't it? Just when you're accomplishing
so much by your efforts, you can be "removed from
reality," as Blumhardt puts it. It took my wife to
point out this quote to me.

Perhaps the greatest danger that threatens us comes
from being overly involved in the small, ordinary
happenings of daily life - from becoming so enslaved
by them that they fill our heart and soul. To go about
life in this way is to go about unprotected, unaware,
distracted, and removed from reality. Let us never
allow ourselves to be dragged down by pettiness, or
to take the things of this earth so seriously that
they burden us day after day. Let us live constantly
in the Promise.
--Christoph Friedrich Blumhardt

One of the greatest risks in taking up arms against
evil is to mistake the battle for something that
must be fought on a human level, between opposing
camps of "good" people and "evil" ones.
It is tempting to carry out the fight in others rather
than in ourselves. Horrified at the state of the world
or at other people's lives, we may become filled with
righteous (if not self-righteous) zeal. But rather
than winning others over to a new life, or finding
their hearts, we may end up distancing ourselves from
them. As Gandhi once advised, "If you hate injustice,
tyranny,lust and greed, hate these things in yourself."
The battle must be waged in our own hearts first.
--Johann Christoph Arnold

Tracy, 15: I'm a sophomore in high school. Looking
through my journal, at the pages of anxious scrawl
I wrote on September 11, 2001, I discovered a quote
I'd jotted down from The Brothers Karamazov. That
quote meant everything to me. I didn't know if I'd
ever see another sunrise. I still don't. Tomorrow,
next week, next year don't count. Neither do my
plans for college or the vocation I choose. All that
matters is now, and the people around me today.

"One day is enough for a man to know all happiness."
--Fyodor Dostoevsky

Wanda, 49: The following lines by William Blake
remind me how love can be found in the most unexpected
places - even where there is great suffering and sorrow.

Seek love in the Pity of other's Woe
In the gentle relief of another's care
In the darkness of night and winter's snow,
In the naked and outcast. Seek love there!
--William Blake

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Dana, 48: I can still remember when I first read
this quote, in the public library at Peekskill NY,
in 1976. It was a decisive moment for me: to
recognize that the line between good and evil does
not follow political, social, or economic
classifications; neither is anyone wholly good, or
wholly unregenerate: each of us must contend with
walking the knife edge.

If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously
committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to
separate them from the rest of us and destroy them!
But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the
heart of every human being. And who is willing to de-
stroy a piece of his own heart?
--Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Never burden yourselves by looking far ahead;
always live one day at a time. If you can do this,
you will live like children, birds, and flowers - for
them, each day is a lifetime. Every day, new joy and
hope unfolds, even if every day also brings you new
shadows and new nightfall. Every day you may break
down in guilt and failure; every day may show you a
thousand times over how helpless you are. Yet each
new day brings new sun, new air, and new grace.
--Eberhard Arnold

The Ice Cream Manifesto.
By: Steve S

This is my poor excuse for publicizing my frustration 
in a metaphoric kind of sense. I want to start with 
saying that I am a huge hypocrite and this is just 
an ideal that I think is kind of appealing.

I am finding my self-getting more and more fed up 
with quicker, easier, and more expensive then its 
predecessor way of life. The super sizing, T.V. dinner 
kind of western civilization that is engineering their 
way into making it easier for you to cram more stuff 
into your busy, family forgetting life style.

I saw a commercial for a cell phone the other day. 
It had the coach of the green bay packers promoting 
how he hated to be disturbed when enjoying the great 
outdoors. I thought; oh . . .this is wonderful, what 
a great ad- campaign for a phone company. Expressing 
compassion for the loss of what they stripped away. 
And then I noticed, I quit imagining and realized 
that he was promoting the "text messaging" feature 
on his cellar phone. I was sick. Devastated. 
Acknowledging that it was only going to get worse 
after this. They will only twist the social knife 
till the only time that I can get away from them 
is when I finally move to the moon where sooner 
or later I will be able to enjoy a Starbucks coffee.

It is the natural progression. Vanilla, to chocolate, 
to swirl, there is always a bigger and better, a rocky 
road, a bubble gum, 31 flavors that are all a little too 
over-board but you will be sick of them next week when 
we come out with something new and when you get sick of 
those we will add more nuts, bigger marshmallows, sweeter 
mind wash that will move so quick you won't have time to 
stop and think that . . . Zen is in simplicity, not in an 
extra value meal. That peace of mind isn't going to roam 
into your palm pilot, it is not going to microwave itself 
into your agenda.

I was grocery shopping with my wife and bought some haagan 
daz vanilla ice cream. I thought, man . . .this is phenomenal. 
This is the best ice cream I have ever eaten. This is it. 
Nirvana. The first thing that popped into my mind was how 
fantastic this would be with some stuff in it. And then it 
hit me. How disgusting am I that I can't enjoy the purity 
of the un-carved block. Why would I need to pervert this 
simplistic perfection? Why would I need to manipulate, to 
twist and harness this already ideal thing. Because I think 
like an American. Because I am born and bred by television, 
pop culture and a natural progression that I call the ice 
cream manifesto.
