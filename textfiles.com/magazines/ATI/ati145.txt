Dear ATI
I bookmarked you these years because when Michael Jackson was 
making headlines, you had less or none about MJ. When OJ Simpson 
was overblown you had nothing or little about O... etc.
     Now that Clinton's making headlice <please don't change
this> I came your way for a breath of fresh air. Eek! 144 was
full to the rim -- teeming with Bill Clinton crap. Pardon the
vernacular. 
     I don't think I'll be bookmarking ATI anymore.
Sharon (541)
  [ed note: I sure hope we don't lose you
            for good. I have no one besides
            myself to blame. (unless of course
            caffeine) We simply got carried
            away. I promise: no Clinton the
            next few issues, and if I can help 
            it -- no caffeine. 
              Perhaps rather than bookmarking
            you'd consider hitting 
            http://www.etext.org/Zines/ASCII/ATI
            once a month or so and look back at 
            the past zines?
              Thanks for your feedback - marco]

Dear ati,
I too enjoyed "The Celestine Prophecy" and I thought you 
might really enjoy reading a new and precious book titled 
"12 Secrets for Manifesting your Vision, Inspiration and 
Purpose". You can order it from Amazon.com or ask
for it at your favorite Bookstore. For more information go to
www.dr-d-richard-bellamy.com or www.phi- publishing.com.
Kind regards,
Jamie (address unknown)

Some quotes:
   "From 1984 to 1993 at least 725 Mexican military officers 
were trained by pentagon experts in the states, 150 of those
in 1993 alone, with 94 officers graduating from fort benning
georgia's notorious School of the Americas in '92 and '93 -
a 300% increase over previous years."

GUATAMALAN DISSENTER DEMANDS BISHOP'S BODY INSPECTED
FOR FBI AGENT BITES
Guatemala City, Sept 16. 
(PAWN) - To determine whether an FBI Agent had role in the 
April murder of a Roman Catholic Bishop, officials said 
today that forensic experts would exhume the bishop's body 
on Thursday.
   Bishop Juan Jose Gerardi, 75, was killed in the garage
to his parish, his head smashed with a cement brick. 
Spanish forensic experts who examined autopsy photos said
the head showed FBI agent-bite marks.

HFG PO3TRY FOR Y0U:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
wether you believe it or scoff
we at HFG hate john markoff
to the new writer matt
we say "at least you're not a rat"

for some reason john hates mitnick
even when tsutomu is the real big dick
while shimmy is no beginner to crime
kevin is the one doing his time

hanging here at new york times
is the best place to sling our rhymes
poor journalism these guys have the knack
which explains the good security they lack

we busted root on their women and their suns
next thing you know, we'll be looking for nuns
in our short absence we leave you this thought
at least the good fight was fought!

Poetry


Black Hawk.
A helicopter? Connecticut - War.
"Defense."
Technology - the best of both worlds.

Always the poet, I cannot let
It set there.
I turn a stone, rock.
Roll it around and
Pick off some metaphors.

Myth.

1832. War. Wisconsin.
Abraham Lincoln
In an Illinois militia
Kills a few Indians himself.
Persues them fleeing through
What is now
