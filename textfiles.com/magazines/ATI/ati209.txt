Greeeeeeeeeeetings, and welllllllcome to
ATI. Issue 209. The "special one." 
[yeah, aren't they all???] I'm Anarchist
Prime and I'll be your 23'rd host through
this journey we call a 'zine. And why?
Because we've been surfing the info
super highway since:

0 1983
9 Gilligan's first joint
8 David Letterman's 9am pilot on NBC
7 Mad Magazine's fold-up covers made sense
6 modems were 3/12
5 8Bits!
4 George Bush's last blow
3 SNL didn't suck.
2 it was a dirt road

and the # 1 answer is:

1 Al Gore owned his first roach-clip-feather-earring.

I'll end my column with a poem, but first this:

  It took him 50 albums to do it, but Carlos Nakai 
finally got nominations for grammies. You know, the
awards given out like porridge to Muzak Slaves by
National Ass. of Recording mob-Agencies. You know,
the ones that float back and forth between NY and
LA depending on who's cheaper that year, Hit Factory
or Record Plant. Yeah, that one.
  When your creative output is assayed like so many
chunks of granite that might have more than 26%
gold-ore and assorted other ferrous oxide-type
stuff, it can get pretty spiritually draining,
I know.
   A BIG HUGE CONGRATULATORY PRAISE-BOMBING GOES OUT
TO THE MEGA-PROLIFIC CARLOS NAKAI for sticking in there
all this time and not letting the thuggery, buggery and
drudgery get him down!

Proving once again:
   
APARTHEID AMERIKAN STYLE: It's Not Just For Black Folk Anymore.

  Last week I watched Tibetan Monks and Lamas creating a Mandala.
OK the Lama read The Complete Works of Shakespeare paperback he
bought in Borders, while the Monks made most of the Mandala. I 
stood there for forty minutes or so in full awe. I felt a
flashback of my mom's father cutting wood in Connecticut half
way up a black rock mountain where he'd built two homes, and
me and my sister would haul the wood for 2 cents a log over to
the house where it was piled for the fireplaces. We were those
monks and the sand was those logs. My grampa was that Lama and
his axe was that Shakespeare book. Totally sublime. I can't
"paint" it here at a keyboard, and fotos wouldn't cut it either.
However, I can say with all-knowing grin, you had to be there.
It's surely one of those half-way-up-a-mountain moments.
  Just as soon as it was deemed "there," at it's most beautiful,
beyond words... they carried it a mile or so to a river that 
feeds a lake that feeds a fjord that feeds the Atlantic Ocean. 
I wasn't there to pray with them or be there, I had to go home 
to my consumergasmic harried hurry. But I could almost feel the
Pentagon getting its needed dose of help and health! The CIA
building, and the IRS building. The FBI and the two competing
Masonic Temple headquarters buildings in all their cut-stone
splendor, sharing the same cityblock, the Reagan Building and
the George Bush/Richard Nixxon Library. So, if you heard Baltimore
or Alexandria shaking, now you know why.
   I'd heard that a Lama walked across the Himalayas to his freedom
the other day. Near the Mandala I just learned he was one of the four
highest Lamas under the Dalai Lama. He didn't walk alone, but he
basically got up one morning took only what he might need and walked
24 miles a day or so through the Himalayas until he was beyond the sight
China's tibettan-keeper-inner-there-guarders. Then he found a town where
he could ask to be brought to India where his boss is hanging out.
Now THERE'S A HARRY WOO STORY YOU'RE   N O T   GOING TO BE ABLE TO TURN
INTO MARKET SHARES!
   This Lama was the leader of the second oldest line (total of four I'm
told) of "orders" (for lack of a better anglo word.) 
   Good walk, good life. Good work!

Did your body drink up -
The nutritious nectar like radiator fluid;
Pouring in with your motor running?

the season (we are available in every British home)
although the scheduling of the final six episodes was
a bit erratic -- (we still don't understand how you're
supposed to remember that a show is on at "10:13pm,"
but that's what makes us Americans!).
Also, welcome to our new viewers in Australia who

Hey Marco, 
I finally got hold of your zine from M.B. and it's
great! I knew you did one but I never saw it! As I

I also saw your personal page a week or so back, very
interesting. You would sound to be a most interesting

THE AMAZING RANDI ON CARL SAGAN'S POT SMOKING:
Snippets Reprinted from Jan00 Skeptic Magazine.
  Carl Sagan was one of my heroes, bigtime...
And now I have learned that Carl Sagan regularly
used marijuana... People should be totally free 
to decide what to do with their lives, providing
that their actions don't interfere with others...
I'll never use pot...
  It might, as Carl seemed to think, enlarge my
ability to think and give me great ideas... It was
Carl's choice, and I have to respect that... I have
no right to saddle other persons with my mores.

RATRACE: The Grad, the Dad and the Lives They Each Had.
 An oldie but a goodie. My title. Origin? No idea.

 The American investment banker was at the pier of a
small coastal Mexican village when a small boat with
just one fisherman docked. Inside the small boat
were several large yellow fin tuna. The American
complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish
and asked how long they took to catch. The man
replied it had taken only a little while. He then
asked why didn't he stay out longer and catch more
fish. The man said he had enough to support his
family's immediate needs. He then asked the man,
  "But what do you do with the rest of your time?" 
The fisherman said, "I sleep late, fish a little,
play with my children, take siesta with my wife,
Maria, stroll into the village each evening where
I sip wine and play guitar with my amigos. A full
and busy life I have."
  The American scoffed, "I'm from Harvard and can
help you. You should spend more time fishing and
earn enough to buy a bigger boat. From the bigger
boat's earnings you could buy more boats; eventually
having a whole fleet. Instead of selling your catch
to middlemen you can sell directly to processors,
eventually opening your own cannery. You can control
the product, processing and distribution. Of course 
you'd need to leave this small coastal fishing village
and move to Mexico City, then LA and eventually NYC where
you'll run your expanding enterprise." The father asked,
  "But, how long will this all take?" To which the grad
replied, "15-20 years."
 "But what then?" The grad laughed, "That's the best part.
When the time is right you would announce an IPO and sell
your company publicly becoming rich, you would make millions." 
  "Millions.. Then what?" The grad said, "Then you would retire.
Move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep
late, fish a little, play with your kids, take siesta with your
wife, stroll to the village in the evenings where you'd sip wine
and play guitar with your amigos."

  as i write this, dumb pop song has been on q101
for two days; both times it's been in the top nine
at nine. and it's certainly not because me and adam
and ryan and jason and kaustubh are calling the radio
station fifty times a day. no, it's because we have
one of the coolest bunch of people helping us out.  
you folks rock.
  i know i said this a couple months ago when we tried to
get the q to play fred astaire, but i'm saying it again. 
This is your chance to show corporate radio and corporate
rock that YOU HAVE A VOICE. call them up and say "i want 
my lucky boys". the number is 591-8300, so let's spread
out the calls and see if we can keep dumb pop song in the
top 9 for as long as possible!  
  and remember, still, that there's every possibility this
could all blow over and nothing could happen. we'll still
be making music; hopefully you'll still listen to it. we
started off writing songs for you guys; we're going to
continue writing for you. nothing will change that.

You think a gallon of gasoline is expensive?
This was submitted by a guy named Sam.
He says some prices are way off so it must
be another golden moldy. But it sure packs
meaning, huh?

.Lipton Ice Tea 16oz - $1.19 - $9.52 per gallon
.Gatorade 20oz - $1.59 - $10.17 per gallon
.Ocean Spray 16oz - $1.25 = $10.00 per gallon

And now A POEM.
Sort of anonymous.

It's awfully considerate of you to think of me here
And I'm most obliged to you for making it clear
That I'm not here
And I never knew the moon could be so blue
And I never knew the moon could be so blue
And I'm grateful you took away my old shoes
And brought me here instead dressed in red
And I'm wondering who could be writng this song....

WHOA, NELLIE!!!
NEW YORK (AP) -- An Empire State Building elevator plunged 40 
stories when a cable snapped, but the two inside were saved 
by an emergency braking system. 
  "I was scared, terrified," Shamika Peterson, 20, said Tuesday.
"I thought I was going to die." She and Joe Masoraca, who work
in different offices on the 44th floor, boarded the elevator
Monday afternoon and pressed a button for the lobby. 
  "We were on our way down when all of a sudden the elevator
dropped, like a bungee jump," Peterson said at a news
conference. The elevator dropped about 400 feet before a
safety system stopped it at the fourth floor. Maintenance
workers used another elevator to guide Peterson and Masoraca
to safety. 
  Peterson was treated at a hospital for neck and shoulder
pain and released. Masoraca refused medical treatment. The 
elevator plunge was caused by a sheared compensating cable,
the wire that adjusts the weight of the car, building spokesman
Howard Rubenstein said. The elevator passed inspection May 19,
he said.
[note: emergency braking sys. woe! thank god for backups]

MORE GREEN JELLO
 24Jan00
  \Alternative Tentacles\
    For Immediate Release
Much to his surprise, Jello Biafra was nominated for the 
Green Party candidate in New York. Biafra, former lead
singer/songwriter of the Dead Kennedys, accomplished spoken
word performer, and renowned social commentator, will be an
official candidate in the March 7 election. Also on the ballot
are consumer advocate Ralph Nader, Stephen Gaskin, founder of
The Farm - a commune in Tennessee, and Joel Kovel, a doctor,
peace activist, and college professor.
  Biafra, a registered Green Party member in California
for several years, has chosen award-winning journalist
Mumia Abu-Jamal, as his vice-presidential running mate.
This decision will focus attention on Abu-Jamal's status
as a United States political prisoner.
  Biafra does not plan to actively campaign. For further
info about the Green Party (including volunteer
positions) contact Craig Seeman at cseeman@earthlink.net.

We end with a poem by R.T.

you slum your way through old downtown
what once was hip, now is down
find some time to rock around
in bullet proof ballroom gowns

what kind of world
are we living in ...

shuffle like cards priorities
rearranging the truth with ease
sinking down to the bottom line
internalize the demented mind

scruples are commodities
whenever they exist at all
so keep draining the earth
consume, pollute, so the economy doesn't stall

what kind of world ...

voting for starched good looks
whose lightest deeds embarass crooks
and celebrate the misery
of life in our dependencies

you villify the terrorists
which you can't see, but know exist
so kill the poor if you don't find
what lives inside of your mind

what kind ...
