  We'll see how this goes. I'm using NoteTab Light
for a text editor today. And "why" you might ask
when I'm so endeared to Notepad.exe (tm)? Well,
perhaps the (tm) part. Or just the closed source
part in general. I was using it all these years
until a NoteTab light came along. :)

Here's another piece of poetry maybe to stick in ATI...

"Linger not, stranger; shed no tear;
Go back to those who sent us here.

We are the young they drafted out
To wars their folly brought about.

Go tell those old men, safe in bed,
We took their orders and are dead."

A.D. Hope (I think)

PUBLISHER'S COLUMN

I finally figured out what bothers me so much
about Mozart's compositions. Triplets. Overuse
of triplets. Just like Kenny G.

Well, here's a new issue of ATI 'Zine. Hope you
like it. We've got poetry, music, all kinds of
stuff. The usual letters, numbers. You know the
drill.

Enjoy! OK, you ready?

I was reading an article someone published about 
environmental illnesses, and health issues regarding
the newest version of Capitalism that our United States 
is fast morphing into.
  Since it was in an interactive newspaper, I had the
pleasure of replying with the following. Thought I'd
share it with you. 

For the past two years I've been filtering my tap water.
  Coffee, rice, soups, lemonade. Everything. I have to
filter my water now or I get ill. If I buy artesian spring
water I'm the healthiest for two or three days straight,
but I seldom can afford the $1.20 or so per gallon for 
drinking water.
  So I have found that I'm my most totally ill drinking
from the tap, somewhat ill whenever I need a new filter
but can't afford one yet, much better with a brand new
filter and I'm at my best while drinking water that has 
nothing to do with my own local groundwater.
  Scientists who aren't bought out by the Rand Corporation
or the CIA will tell you that there's much too much 
chlorine in my citywater, and the pesticide runoff from 
the local farms surrounding this city is mixing to provide
chloroform, which apparently commercial filters can only
remove portions of.
  But I'm sure that's only one part of the whole. At any
rate, I filter my water now or I get really sick. And for
your begging question, I'm sure -- I'll tell you -- we're 
talking dizziness, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, stomach ulcers, 
vomiting, chills and other flu symptoms without the fever.
Yeah, and backpain to boot.
  Oh, and four times in the last four years about a 2 inch
patch of hair has fallen off both my wrists overnight and
then grown back over a month or two, left wrist first, 
then the right wrist. Yes, it grows back evenly with all 
the other arm-hair as if it had never fallen out in the 
first place.
  If I sound nonchalant about it, it's only because it's
happened to me three other times before. I am right now
seeing stubble on my right wrist getting bigger and bigger,
wheras my left wrist has all the hair fully grown back.
I was definitely not easy-going the first time! I looked
around my pillow and bed furiously to see where the hair
might have gone. Did it just burn off into the air? I'll
never know.
  So this is some real shit, man. I feel like I'm in the 
middle of a scene from "Jacob's Ladder." 
  I wouldn't complain much, but here's the rub. If I
simply switched my lifestyle a little so I can afford
about $2900 a year in artesian spring water, I'm pretty
sure I'd see every one of these symptoms go away as if
they'd never come. Problem is not only am I unable to 
afford THAT, the reason I get into trouble is that the 
lifestyle I've chosen over the last 14 years or so, 
(simplifying life down to consuming about 80% less than 
I did in my late teens and early 20s for the sake of the 
environment) paying $8 a month for a Brita filter happens 
to be my third largest regular expense.
  I'm definitely the canary in your coalmine. By the time
all of you get out of denial, I'll either be dead, or
will have figured something holistic out that forces
me to become a capitalist slave to just so that I can 
attempt to get it out to all of you sorry-ass louts.
  Oh, and one last thing. You bet your bippy, pResident
George "W" Bush has an environmental illness.

He's environmentally retarded.

PARAPHRASE OF THE WEEK

All it takes for evil to prevail is 
for good [people] to do nothing.

I'm paraphrasing Howard K. Smith quoting
Edmund Burke.

He was canned for making that statement.

 In 1961, he narrated a CBS special about the civil 
 rights movement. Author Stanley Cloud says Smith 
 wanted to end the broadcast with the Edmund Burke 
 quote, "All that is necessary for the triumph of 
 evil is for good men to do nothing." Cloud says 
 then-CBS Chairman William Paley objected, Smith 
 disagreed and Paley fired him.

Maybe a good start for kicking evil's ass is
for corporate media types to risk getting fired
again. Wouldn't that be a fresh and new seeming
idea these days?

(of course you'd risk the wrath of George W Bush's
Patriot act now, wouldn't you? Hmmm. Against all
odds. Like a well paid Davie versus Goliath. Go
for it.)


HOW PEOPLE BEHAVE: THINGS THEY SAY AND DO
One day Henry Kissinger came to the meeting late, and everyone 
had to wait. Now mind you, this is not a meeting of the Supreme 
Court, where law prescribes where everybody sits, according to 
seniority. The National Security Council, at least at that time, 
met in an office in the White House, wit-in an oak table and 
some drapes and some maps, but no electronic flashing boards 
or anything like that. People sat around the great big table, 
with the staffers sitting in an outer ring of chairs so they 
could lean forward to advise their individual masters. Often 
staffers were not present when sensitive decisions were being 
made.
  The Secretary of Defense plopped down in a chair to talk to 
somebody while we waited for Kissinger, and then Kissinger came 
steaming in and he told the Secretary of Defense, "I am here. 
We can go to work. Move down to your chair." 
  To which the Secretary of Defense replied, "Well, I am all 
spread out here. You sit there today." And Kissinger said, "No, 
I am the Secretary of State, this is my chair. You sit down there." 
They proceeded to argue like five-year-olds for about five minutes. 
Eventually the Secretary of Defense would not move, and Kissinger 
had to go sit down at the far end of the table, but he turned his 
back on the briefings and sulked. He wouldn't pay attention to what 
we were saying that day because he couldn't have his chair-and we 
were making decisions that were getting people killed in Angola. 
  I am not exaggerating that incident one bit.

 "Praetorian Guard: The U.S. Role in the New World Order."


AND NOW FOR A FAIRLY UNDERDEVELOPED THOUGHT.

Fundraising together.

"I would say there's been a huge widening of 
the do-it-yourself 'zine culture that may be 
the best gift punk has given the world, even 
more than all the cool music.
  "It widened further when Riot Grrrl happened, 
and now it's caught on to the point where even 
high school students are publishing their own 
'zines about their school, or about the education 
system itself."

A Quotable Quote - 

Things have changed greatly since the days that I, 
and my friends explored the telephone system, and 
discovered some of its many wonders. Security is 
downright _MEAN_, laws have been written, programs 
are better, etc. I would not trade for anything, the 
memories I have, nor the friends I have made over 
the years pursuing my "hobby". Today though, things 
are changing so rapidly that I sadly, cannot even 
hope to keep up with it all. To me at least, the 
telephone system will always remain a most interesting 
beast.

"New and improved" lyrics to the Jello Biafra/Mojo Nixon
version of Phil Ochs' "Love Me I'm A Liberal."

I cried when they shot John Lennon
Tears ran down my spine
And I cried when I saw "JFK"
As though I'd lost a father of mine
But Carlo G and Ice-T had it coming
They'd got what they asked for this time 

So love me, love me, love me
I'm a liberal

I go to pro-choice rallies
Recycle my cans and jars
I'll honk at your dancin' bear stickers
hope those funny grunge bands become stars
But don't talk about revolution
That's going a little too far

(ch)

I cheered when Clinton was chosen
My faith in the system reborn
I'll do anything to save our schools
If my taxes ain't too much more
And I love blacks and gays and latinos
As long as they don't move next door

(ch)

Bush, Cheney, Ridge, Thompson and Ashcroft
Should all hang their heads in shame
I can't understand where their heads at
Perhaps Ooprah should set them all straight
But if neighborhood watch doesn't know you
I hope the cops take down your name

(ch)

Yeah I logon to Indymedia
FreeRepublic and Slashdot too
If I vote it'll be for a democrat
With a sensible economy view
But when it comes to them terrorist A-Rabs
There's no one more red, white and you

(ch)

Once I was a young punk with attitude
Stickers covered the car I drove in
Even went on some direct actions
When there weren't too much riot gear seen
Ah, but now I've grown older and wiser
And that's why I'm turning you in

(ch)so love me, love me, love me
I'm a liberal

"You can't hardly tell the difference between any

  -Arlo Guthrie on 2002's Grammies and how homogenized
music has become these days. 
  (He's telling this to a very homogenized Green Bay 
   Wisconsin audience the night after the Grammies!
   Now I happen to know that while the Grammies were
   on television he was performing in some other part
   of Wisconsin. Did he see this on his tourbus? in a
   hotel? Did someone tape it for him?)

MORE QUOTES:

The most important difference between today and the '60s 
is that now we have an internet music culture that people 
from everywhere can participate in. We can directly communicate 
back and forth around the planet at any emotional depth, and 
really liquidate whatever conflicts and blockages we suffer 
from in a way that was never possible before. Now not only 
can we think globally and act locally, we can feel globally 
and act locally, which in time will make a lovely difference.
