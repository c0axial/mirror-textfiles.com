We Begin With a Poem 
by Ginger Pence

Out in sea that drowns me
Blue as the core from the sky
I thank myself for knowing how to swim
For my unconquered life

In the ocean's tide of destruction
I have cried aloud for help.
under the busy sea floor I try to swim
My arms are tired but not unusable.

Beyond the sun are the cries of my voice
loomed but not afraid of the tides,
And yet I wonder if I'll live
Forget yourself, and forget your soul.

It matters not how I swim away
Hurry to the green filled land
I am lost of all hope,
I am no longer alive.
                              
                              .-.-.-.-.
                               - - - -

"when people who are starving to death come up to you, in
the street and ask you for money and you're deciding whether
you're going to give them a quarter of a cent or a half a 
cent..."
   --Arlo Guthrie between shows in India this year saying it's 
not just corporate greed, or rich fat white americans - it's 
"a fundamental lack of understanding of what it means to be
a human being."

                            =#=

      ...every government is trying to regulate it. But it 
      will come up again in another way, like weeds growing
      up through cracks in cement."
          --A. Guthrie on a)  marijuana? 
                          b)  freedom?
                          c)  internet?

Hello and welcome to ATI issue 155. I'm prime anarchist
and I can't find my column. If I do, I'll stick it in here.
Otherwise, read on with smiles...

          ans: (c)       by the way...

Yes, I was protesting war last weekend. You probably figured 
that out. Of all the people I saw there, I was happiest
to see Anne Archy, I think. My first time seeing her in two 
years. A hug was almost good enough to make up for all the 
distance and time. I sure hope our circles cross many
more times in our lives. She's got a really nice speaking voice
and one of the most tonal singing voices I've ever heard out of
a woman. Ever. Any human actually. Birds yes, Moose yeah, sure. 
But people? Go Anne; go Anne. 
   It was wonderful to see Cal Roberts there too. He took
Amtrak down from konetiuk I'll bet. What a great spirit. If you
live where I come from you probably know him because he's that
Stoningtonian whose temporary illness caused almost every single 
clergy of each denomination from three or four townships
to drop whatever petty issues kept them centuries apart, and stand 
out there keeping his decades-running vigil for him in stodgy old
New London County. They probably jumped in nice warm autos to and
fro  - rather than ride SEATs sucky bus system, but that gets us 
half way there, eh?
   Even my mother, who's Republican treasurer of my hometown (yes I 
forgive her it every day. How do I show her, she's where I get MY
unchanging values???) mailed me news-clippings about "that protest
guy." Cal, God Bless You. You've got the Baptists and the Catholics,
the Unitarians and the Congregationals realizing even if they can't 
agree on lunch, they sure can get that Praxis cooking.
   So call that a prime anarchist column, and move on. "shoot move
communicate, if you will..." I probably ought to name the other
bunches of people I "hung with" who some-ways are bigger honors to
know than Martin Sheen or Amy from the Indigo Girls; but suffice it
to say these two well represent the others. Best durned "be in" I've
been to since the last one! So where and when did it all begin?
Thanks mom, thanks dad, thanks congregational church. Thanks Father
Larry, and I'm not even catholic. 
   Full circle, 1968-1998. Our movement's even bigger than the 
Beatles now.

marco,
A number of my critics, frothing at the mouth, remind me: 
"This is a free country. We have a free press....so how can 
you write the things you do?"
Well, they are right this is a free country (relatively 
speaking). And with that freedom comes a corresponding 
responsibility. I have a responsibility as a "journalist" 
to speak the truth (as best I can tell it) about these
matters.
Thank you and keep up the good fight.

  All well and good, but a couple years ago weren't you
paying about 50K for that job??? Career? Benefits??
  Attention all corporations "handling autistic people:" 
E-mail me and show me what you used to pay and what you

  Oh, and I speak for most average americans responding

  Don't even THINK of requiring a resume for a 5, 6 or 7 "per"

to boot up old WP and convert my resume to Word and print it on

FLASH -=- MARC FRUCHT WITNESSES ABUSE OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLE AT
MILITARY BASE. News From the School Of The Americas Protests.
(SEMINOLE, Georgia) - "You're a liar," --Archbishop Romero
recognizing someone in a Salvadoran Army General.
   This happened last Sunday. It is the truth as I saw it.
   Half our procession was on busses to the park for what we
believed was to be our arrest. The other half, we had marched
past "the line" where we were detained 2 hours awaiting the
maxed-out busses. We were about 500 yards ahead of the people
in wheelchairs who also wished to cross the line and risk 
arrest. We watched a left-tenant colonel verbally assault the
humans in wheelchairs telling them they could not cross a new
line he'd invented and that if they joined us over THAT line
there'd be a worse penalty for them. They were afraid to move.
   We decided thru consensus that his saying they couldn't 
join us, did not cover us joining them. We stretched our line
wide until the last four people, including me, stood right 
next to the people with wheelchairs. Somewhere between 15 and 
thirty of them.
   Two were crying, and they all agreed verbally they were 
quite relieved that we re-included them; for they felt isolated, 
in danger, and scared.
   The left-tenant returned. He began telling them that the  
busses had already taken the first wave of "criminals" to a  
park two miles away, that this second wave (us) would 
not be processed and we'd be taken by bus right off the base
where the gate is, so we can wait for our "buddies." 
   He told the people in wheelchairs they could save him the 
time, money and gas if they would just wheel themselves back
off the base to where the other 5 to 7 thousand were singing,
drumming and cheering us all on.
   I sensed a very dangerous lie had been paid out and the 
people were about to get hurt. It's a burden giving a shit,
but I pressed forward with a skill that if I can say without
bragging, I acquired in greater volume than this "colonel."
   "Sir!" I shouted from next to the people in wheelchairs. 
"Were the people on the first busses processed or NOT??"
   "Son!" he shouted as if I was some dumb GI under his 
command.
   "Are you in a wheelchair?" he barked turning toward me with
the look of venom in his eyes.
   "No sir!" I parried his thrust as fast as I could. I suddenly
realized I'd broken him and he was about to single me out for 
abuse. From my basic training skills and times where I'd lived 
through going beyond broken, I realized that if I said anything
to his screams besides a barrage of "yes sir's" and "no sir's" 
he was going to spend 15 entire minutes hollaring at me while
he built up his "plan b," in his pea-sized mollasses-in-january
brain. My life was possibly in danger and hinged on my attention
to that detail. My silence may have been just as dangerous, 
if not more.
   So I replied "yes sir; no sir," very rapidly to his launch of
5 or 6 verbal assaults including something about my ass, and 
suggesting I get it away from the wheelchairs.
   "You do what you have to," he screamed angrily at the people
in the wheelchairs, wheeled around and left walking tall with 
the self-assuredness of a pompous fool who deserves absolutely
no one's respect outside of his small part of the United States
Army. 
        [nice of him to quote Martin Sheen at the end there.
        Emulation is the best form...]
   We all continued on rather than get tricked by the left 
tenant's attempt at damage reduction. We were bussed 
to the park where we too were processed and the people in 
wheelchairs were escorted off-base by other military people 
who treated them nicely I'm told.
   This good cop/bad cop junk is rapidly getting old.
