that can't play. It's just electronic push-of-the-
button-music. Not Bo Diddley. If the lights go out
and the juice goes down, I can strap on an acoustic
guitar and just kill 'em."

*    Welcome  to  VI  Tutor - Version  1.2  *
*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*

    **************
    * Lesson 1.0 *
    **************

Vim is a very powerful editor that has many 
commands, too many to explain in a tutor such 
as this.  This tutor is designed to describe 
enough of the commands that you will be able 
to easily use Vim as an all-purpose editor. 

The approximate time required to complete the 
tutor is 25-30 minutes, depending upon how much 
time is spent with experimentation.

It is important to remember that this tutor 
is set up to teach by use. That means that the 
student needs to execute the commands to learn 
them properly.  

Now, make sure that your Shift-Lock key is NOT 
depressed and press the j key enough times to 
move the cursor so that Lesson 1.1 completely 
fills the screen.

We clash you and me.
First I thought because you are so different, you see.
But then after all the dust cleared
And the shrapnel was swept up into neat little tins
And all our respective allies' bodies were policed up by loved ones -
Dogs and crows and old men with metal detectors and headphones
Closing the circle in little by little hoping to find a scrap or two,
And the grandmothers all weep over tea, saying 

I Told You So: See? Nothing Was Accomplished Again; 
Who's Gonna Feed The Kids.

For the 432nd time,
It was then I realized:
The reason you and me,
We used up every bullet we had
Not because we're so different, you see.

Because we're mirror images, aren't we?
Like Isaac and Ishmael maybe, 
But who needs analogies when we're each other?
We do kinda look alike, huh? 
Besides all the acting, and talking 
And walking like each other.

But enemy, my friend.
Can I ask you one question?
What kind of Creator lets us miss each other that many times?

        ========
we end with a poem.

When the Secret Service men
Have to follow you around
And you lead 'em into local coffee roasters,

And the only things they can
Order are all cooked that day from scratch
Except the bagels locally bought from pastry toasters;

They will buy some fairtrade coffee
And you can't help catching the sound
Of some federal dollar ACTUALLY going to your local roasters...

You'll know you surely can
Count a coup or two this round
Doubling the support of a local non-chain merchant - 
Instead of McDonalds, IHOP or a donut shop.
