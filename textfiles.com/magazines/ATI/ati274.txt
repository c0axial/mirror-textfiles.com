Hi, I'm Prime Anarchist and this is issue 274 of
the 'zine. Are you C'ing the phull mune? It's

  "Do you think the moon ever overflows?" she
asks me.
  And in the middle of the night you say nothing.
Just, "yeah sure. uh huh." Go back to bed.
  Well, it's Official.
  According to the Boston Globe, McDonalds has been 
using beef extract all along.
  The fast-food giant, who many environmentalists
and vegetarians believe is a menace to society, has 
been saying since 1990 that its fries are cooked in 
pure vegetable oil, using "potatoes, partially
hydrogenated soybean oil and 'natural flavor.'"
  What they conveniently fail to tell anyone is
that the 'natural flavor' comes from beef. The only
way to find that out is to contact a McDonald's
customer-satisfaction representative. If you do, 
they'll tell you honestly what's in it and ask you
to please not make a fuss.
  Many people who've written to the "customer
satisfaction" department for many reasons including
meat issues have just received a form letter and
coupons for meals to come.
  This author once wrote in simply, "your food
just plain sucks, and I don't think I'll ever eat 
at a McRestaurant anymore," and received four 
coupons for a full meal* at any store. 
  *full meal, of course meaning big mac, biggie
fries and biggiewiggie drink with no substitutions
allowed. 
  Not able or willing to use them, the author posted
them up on a bulletin board near a laundromat.
  This morning's Boston Globe article about a Class
Action suit beginning against McDonalds corp., says
that McDonalds believes using "natural flavor" as a 
synonym for beef extract is within federal Food and
Drug Administration guidelines. If that's true, 
vegetarians would be wise to check each and every
processed food they buy.
  I'll end this quoting the Globe a little because
the ending to THEIR article is good. Real good.

Harish Bharti, the Seattle lawyer who filed the suit 
against McDonald's Tuesday, said "McDonald's contention 
that the information was available to people if they had
only asked is insulting. 
  "Not only did they deceive these people," he said. "Now 
they are claiming that all these people were deceived because 
they were stupid. This adds insult to injury."

  "He wanted to know if he would be in the book 
because if so he might have problems. The Deputy
Directorate of Operations had just assigned him
to a course in Latin American studies at the 
University of Wisconsin. He would be starting
next September, the first DDO operations officer
in living memory to be sent for graduate study.
He would have to keep up his State Department 
cover while there, and obviously it would be
blown if I mentioned him."

Subway Sandwich Shop. I'm "assistant manager's assistant."
Higher wages, no benefits. They drop me down to two shifts
a week.
  During my lunch break I call NPR's business department
and help pay for four anti-globalism ads.
  "Hello, Subway," the assistant manager answers the phone.
  "Why?
  "But he's my best worker, and all the lower employees
like and trust him.
  "OK boss. You know what's best for the company. It's as
good as done."
  She removes me from the schedule and doesn't say a word
about it. Tries to be as nice, albeit distant, as she can
to me for the rest of my shift.
  "Bye," she says, "see you tomorrow?"
  "Alright, goodbye," I say, "be a good person," at the
end of my last shift.


Cambridge Confrontation
STRIKE '69 - LIVING WAGE '01

You definitely won't need a weatherman to know which
way this wind blows. In southern new england it's 
going from Boston to NYC. And that's usually a large
storm.

"It's like Berkeley in the '60s where an action can resonate
across the country," said Mark Engler at 27 West 44th St NYC
where Harvard Alum are giving some NY "ground support" to
Boston's Living Wage Campaign. "This is something that could
be one of those signs of the times."
  Engler (Class of '98) has been involved in anti-sweatshop 
and living wage campaigns for the past five years. He hopes 
the current battle at Harvard will have a galvanizing effect 
on campuses across the country. They've been locked down 
inside Massachussetts Hall for a couple weeks now. They
finally rated television and other corporate media coverage
for a couple days now.

Yesterday I traded some records here in Wisconsin at one of
my favorite used record stores. Metro Records. Lots of hip-
hop and house, trance and drums, but lots of folky stuff too.
  Along with my trade I bought a Buddah 2 Record set. Now
you might know Buddah mostly for their highest prophet in
the 60's, Melanie Safka. Yeah, she's the one who told us
we have brand new rollerskates and she's got a brand new
key; and she also asked us to look what they did to her song.
  Well this record has Charles Osgood interviewing Harvard
Corporation officials and offsets that against interviews 
with members of Students for a Democratic Society when, 
on April 9, 1969 they seized University Hall to support 
their demands.
  1969. Nothing's changed since, has it? Well, little.

Here's what Kenneth Jost had to say about it way back
then. He was WHRB's Managing Editor.

 Cries had erupted at Berkeley, at Columbia, San Francisco
 State, but many people felt that it couldn't happen at 
 Harvard. During the winter of 1968-69, however tensions
 rose as the Harvard Administration and the Students for a
 Democratic Society came into repeated conflicts. Then, on
 April 9, the radicals seized University Hall student radio
 station, WHRB-FM. These sounds capture the emotional 
 reaction, the shock that followed the seizure, the outrage 
 that followed the police bust the next day. Emotions played 
 a vital part in determining the actions of all the groups 
 in the crisis: students, faculty, and administration. Yet 
 the striking aspect of that emotionalism was the extent to 
 which it was channeled into constructive discussion about 
 the larger issues which lay behind the crisis: the university's 
 ties with the military, the university's relationship with the 
 community, the distribution of power within the university, 
 and -- most importantly -- the university's role in dealing 
 with such problems as Vietnam, poverty, racism. If Harvard's 
 crisis proved anything, it proved that even in emotional 
 times people can reason together if they try. That fact 
 alone should provide some optimism for the future.

This year's most newsworthy issue is a living wage for 
Harvard Corporation's hourly employees. But that connects
so many other issues also doesn't it? Sweatshops, the war
on drugs, round-up getting into our drinking water, what
else?
  They say they don't plan on directly addressing issues
surrounding Sodexho Marriott's abuse of the new growing 
US prison labor movement until after they've won this 
living wage issue first.

It's gonna be a long storm, and I mostly just want 
to know how many times Crimson students will have 
sung "We Shall Not Be Moved."

GUARDIANS OF THE EMPIRE

big bosomed popstars 
pedaling ultra corporate images of coolness and sex appeal 
for the sole purpose of selling soft drinks 

thirty-second bursts of eye and ear candy 
featuring steroid toned men and anorexic women 
designed to make you feel bad about yourself 
so you will buy the latest fragrance from Calvin Klein 

news gives the straight story 
as long as it doesn't conflict with the corporate
agenda 

lives lived vicariously 
through dramas, sit-coms, soaps 

wanna be like mike 

love, popularity, and personal strength 
now come in disposable containers 

but don't dare challenge this 
the greatest of empires 
our ideas are holy and our intention just 

"we are the hollow men" 

we will disney-fy the world 
and lend it a helping Big Mac 

"we are the stuffed men" 

we will give you the dead things 
in return for the live things 

"our dried voices, when we whisper together" 

we will give you a T.V. 
in return for your culture 

"are quiet and meaningless" 

and if you should disagree 
we have plenty of ways to deal with you 

"the dead land" 

gas, and spin 
and the killers of men 

"violent souls, but only as the hollow men, the
stuffed men" 

don't tell us of your wonderful dream 
if it doesn't fit in with profit 
it is no dream at all 

"this is cactus land" 

Our capital, our possession are dearer to 

"the hollow men" 
"the stuffed men" 

are dearer to us, than your 

"headpiece filled with straw"

the dollar in all its forms 
the tank and the rifle 
are doomed to die

this is the way the world begins 
not with a whimper 
but a shout
