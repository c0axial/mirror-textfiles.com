You'll Be Me Soon Enough
   a poem by NYC poet Brett Axel.

   1963 John Kennedy
   Toasted my birth
   With blood and flashbulbs.
   My nursery peers awoke
   To a generation of carrying the torch
   Our parents lit
   Through the streets of Woodstock,
   New Hope, Big Sur,
   Extinguished before the first hairs
   Sprouted in the cups under our joints
   We raged against Nixon;
   We raged against 'Nam;
   We raged against the white
   Bank of the river
   Demanding red and grey
   And brown and black sand;
   We shook our angry rattles at the system
   And threw off the oppression of cloth diapers forever.

   Rom Doss, I was there then,
   Allen Ginsberg, when America got naked
   We were naked already.
   We spent the summer of love
   Singing the alphabet with Buffy Saint Marie
   And whoever else stepped 
   From our parent's bong parties
   Into Mister Roger's Neighborhood;
   Walked the Sesame Street counting winos sleeping
   On subway grates:
   One wino,
   Two winos,
   Three dirty smelly winos,
   I love to count winos.

   The first word I knew how to spell was friend:
   F R I
   E N D
   Special.
   I thought 'special' 
   Was the last letter of the word, 'friend.'

   If we didn't know,
   At least we suspected 
   That Ernie and Burt were lovers
   And it was O.K.
   Because they cared about each other very deeply
   And they weren't asking us 
   For health coverage
   Or joint tax returns.

   There was no thank you
   For the 'AtomKraft, Nine Danka' bumper sticker
   I put on my first car,
   Or the 'Reagan's an asshole' songs
   I spit on the stages of CBGB's
   Max's Kansas City, The Ritz
   (before Joe Camel took over the place
       started dealing nicotine)
       "Hey kid, 
       the first hit's free."

   We bottled out bags and bagged our bottles;
   Rejected extra packaging on CDs;
   Swung hammers for Habitat;
   Held hands across America...

   Worked, spent, yes,
   Bought a Saturn and installed 
   Windows '95 on a one thirty-three
   Pentium processor clone with sixty-four megs,
   But saved a few dollars
   From every three or four paychecks
   To send a check 
   To the World Wildlife Federation,
   The Elizabeth Morgan Defense Fund,
   Whatever the fuck
   ABC's cause of the week was.

   God Damn it!

   We did our marching
   And pissing
   And fighting
   And fucking
   And killing
   And saving
   And we still do, in a way,
   By sending a check.

   I don't know when I bacame another something
   The youth can rage against.

   It crept up on me like my grey hairs.
   One minute I was making an effort
   To understand Metallica,
   The next I'm walking through Tower Records
   With Nine Penny Nails or some such shit
   Blasting my aging eardrums out of their sockets
   And I hear myself asking the management
   To turn off the God-Awful racket.

   [Brett read this poem while many of us were attending 
    CD classes the day before our big action at Fort Benning
    Georgia where "we won" was felt all around. I think if
    Ghandi came back to life with a foul mouth he IS Brett 
    "throwing off the oppression of cloth diapers. =)]


    
PUBLISHER'S COLUMN:
<prime happy>
We won. Again. We won.
They couldn't build jails fast enough. They didn't have
enough busses, and they dishonored ADA requirements and
couldn't accommodate the 15-30 wheel-chair riding people
who also risked arrest but were not included in the official
number of 2319 peacefully "forcing" their way into the center
of Fort Benning to demand a public forum discussing just how
many Republicans, Democrats, Independents and assorted other
human beings feel so compassionate about shutting down what
has become "on our watch" a place of torture, violence, hatred
and oppression.
   They prepared for 800-1000 of us; we were 4 times as many
as them that showed last year. They were not ready for us -
and they submitted.
   SOA will be shut down soon. We have dominated the public 
forum, we have spoken. Congress will be wise to take heed
and reflect. They WILL represent their people. They won't 
really have any choice, will they?
   We were many!

Dear editor:

Please consider publishing the following 
brief article in your Ezine.
Are You "Ready For Love" ? 
North Americans spend millions, if not billions, of dollars 
every year in pursuit of a satisfying, fulfilling intimate 
relationship.
   Yet many fail repeatedly in their quest because they 
forget the first most important step.
   They do not determine their own "readiness for love."
Whether you are single at present and pursuing...

Prime Anarchist World Real Newz
(PAWRN) - 11th Mesa, AZ. 
Yesterday i [the person who sent this in] received 
a phone call from Bonnie Whitesinger and her husband 
Bob Chaat.  They told me that while Pauline was away, 
Navajo-Hopi relocation commission officials came to 
serve Pauline a 30 day eviction notice. 
Bob said that the families not signing 
the accomodation agreement were all served such notices. 
He said it was creepy because he had never seen these guys 
before and they knew both his first and last names.
   From my perspective as a longtime supporter of 
Dineh resisters, i feel it is crucial for those of 
us who care to be continually cultivating in ourselves 
and in other people of conscience the courage it will require 
to make stands beyond what white people have ever done 
in the sad history of this land to STOP THE GENOCIDE!  
I personally feel that the various lawsuits have been 
distracting from the traditional way of dealing with 
the evil which is the ceremonies.  Traditional Hopi 
who came to offer their support to the resisters in 
March of 1997 emphasized the importance of the spiritual 
position.  Thomas Banyacya said, "No courts, no lawyers, 
no white man's law.  We obey the law of the creator.  
This is our land. This is your land."  The legal system 
has done nothing but drain the hopes and resources of 
the resisters.  I honor the right of those who feel that 
the courts are their only recourse, but i cannot emphasize 
enough the importance of true supporters preparing for 
very serious confrontations if and when these evictions 
are attempted.  Peabody is going forward with expansion 
plans disregarding the rights of Maxine Kesoli who isn't 
even on HPL land!  
Support resistance.  
Shut down Peabody coal mine.
In peaceful struggle,
Swaneagle

Sunday 4:30 pm. Let's see. who's beating the Packers today?
My new team is doing poorly. I put ATI out today. A pretty
good one (imho) I put in a lot of SOA stuff, and tried to
surround it with humorous things so it's easy to "digest."
Thursday I perform at the sendoff, then friday I pack up
and go to Georgia for 2 or 3 days. I can't wait to travel.
Oh, we're winning 17-3. I'm having guacamole & chips at Taco

Wake up from a dream that I'm walking around a mall pouring
food coloring all over my pants from a purple squirtgun
to the tune of Marylin Manson's "Dope Show" and the bus 
driver asks if we wanna eat at Cracker Barrel or Waffle 
House.

You notice professor and professional student have the same

Hey God, Knucklehead.
What are you going to do with all the "recovering

to ask, do I?

Dear Groton Connecticut,
In June of 1988 I was on delayed entry program for the
Signal Corps, US Army.  
Through Olsten temporary service I was given a job sweeping
floors in your midway plant for $6.00 per hour. You got my
drivers licence but I was still looking for my birth certificate
because the last time I'd needed it was Little League all-stars.
   I was such a competant, hard-working "dude" that you let me
take the tunnel under Groton to the other buildings where I had
some interesting new tasks to enjoy and learn from. I was told
to be very careful to put the brown and black garbage bags in the 
dipsey dumpsters for Murphy and other civilian companies to come
haul away; whereas the clear bags were all the secret, top-secret
and eyes-only waste going to be shredded and burned. I was to place
them in clearly marked yellow squares next to the dumpsters so that 
the extra-competant people who AREN'T Murphy corporations can haul
THEM.
   I believe I only screwed that up 2 or 3 times, and I don't think
there was any harm, for the Murphy people probably didn't know what
was what anyhow.
   My favorite job was wiping off all the video display terminals
and emptying wastebaskets in P Takis Veliotis' old office, (oh who
was his replacement I forget) and especially the Newport News Liason
office rooms.
   Naval Investigative people eat all the wrong foods, by the way,
according to the wastebaskets I saw; and if they keep all that porn
on their screens every day from 4:30 til 7am there's going to be
naked people burnt into the glass, you might want to write a memo
about that. I turned most of them off those nites.
   Oh, and speaking about memos, pardon me, but I couldn't help
but notice the angry letter from that guy who replaced Veliotis -
what WAS his name??? - Anyhow, it looked like it was to every
3 letter agency, the president, UN Security Council and if I remember
right, Henry and Nancy Kissinger too. You were mad that to make your
contract deadlines you could only make washers and driers that run
at 1/3 capacity and while you recognize this is perfect for peacetime,
you said you felt it was unacceptable and must be corrected immediately
because during war, you needed full capacity or the sailors will begin
smelling like urine, bad sculptures or a Texas slaughterhouse.
   "Immediately." you said (which is as we know in military terms - 
8 to 10 years) 
   I couldn't help but notice because you used all-caps for the first 
four lines and we in the netizen community call that shouting. The 
letter was face up. I felt like a kid in a candystore and really
wanted to turn the page and read the rest but held to my purest 
ethic.
   I'm telling you this because I believe this qualifies me to 
become an official civilian inspection team member to make sure
we aren't making too many weapons of mass destruction so we'll have
room to talk when we tell Iraq, China, India and Afghanistan they 
have no right. 
   If you don't have a group like that already, can I get 
permission to start one?

Prime Anarchist Interviews Martin Sheen.
  Martin Sheen has been socially just for many years now.
  He was key in bringing Lou Diamond Phillips, Edward James
  Olmos and many other fence-sitters to the UFW boycotts 
  when he "put his body where his mouth was." Cesar Chavez
  always used to say (including to me in 1992) "vote with
  your feet." Sheen, who has most recently played Peter Maurin
  in "Entertaining Angels," and Mitch Schneider in "Samaritan,"
  has been walking ever since.

 Prime Anarchist - (shaking his hand) Thank you, thank you, thank 
you. It's great to meet you. I missed meeting you in 1992 when I
fasted on the capitol steps and I was sweating with Chief Billy
Tayac and you were addressing us with your presence, Susan Shown Harjo's 
and I don't remember who ever else.
 Martin Sheen - (smiles) Nice to meet you. Is Charlie Liteky here?
 PA - I'm not sure. Chance Brian Willson or Scott Rutherford are
here? Maybe Dave Dellinger?
 MS - Haven't seen them yet. You know, it's hard for Brian to
get around these days on his "third world legs."
 PA - Yeah. I know. Do you think doing today will effect your career?
 MS - I hope so.
 PA - Thank you, thank you, thank you.

 [the career question was asked by a man off to the side, and 
 Sheen mistakenly attributed it to the woman next to him. After
 discussion with the man after the event Prime Anarchist decided
 to borrow that question with all due humility.]

What's gonna be the next subtlety.

Dear Diary - watched 2 SOA movies in a row. Paid for by our tax
dollars, created by perhaps the largest propaganda machine the 
world has seen since Hitler's moviefactories.
   I don't focus on their propagandic nature as we are each 
guilty of that. Having worked really hard to get the log out
of my own eye, I believe with all my heart that these two 
movies, (and especially the second one) are deliberate acts 
of terrorism.  

Prime Anarchist Division's offical head count of the SOA action
Sunday, November 22, 1998.
   3478.5 ready, willing, able and acting for arrest. 
   10,500 supporting at the gate. 
      These figures were adjusted from truth the same way the US
DOD has been tallying people since 1861. 2319 crossed the line, so
we multiplied by 3 and divided by 2. Same for the 7,000 responsible
estimate of the total crowd.
<PAPAD> <small> Prime Anarchist Public Affairs Division cites the 
following standard for these figures, in context of other misinformation
campaigns. </small>
   Conflict time official figure of US dead in Iraq excluding Gulf
War Illness Victims - 197
   Official figure 8 years later (assumed to be closer to truth which
will likely get declassified officially on the 10 year anniversary
of the actual deaths - 295.5 [prime anarchist bets it climbs just over
300 less than a year from now]
   While awaiting medical discharge from the United States Harmy, Prime
Anarchist often worked with these kinds of figures for the Public
Affairs Department. Anarchist coined the nickname to that job
"padding." It is finally time for common people to begin using the
2/3-3/2 "rule of thumb" for peace instead of war.
