I stopped doing something last nite because it's wrong.
And not because I got caught.
  I can't say what it is because it falls in way under
statute of limitations difficulties, and all that jazz.
Rest assured it's far less heinous than something a Richard
Nixxon or a Bill Clinton or even a Madeline Albright has done.
But I'd like to point out that since I'm stopping for the
opposite reason; it makes me (at least appear, right? - 'a
'cause who's to judge?) a far better person than Nixxon et al.

US Army School of the Americas Grad Arrested
for Murder of Guatemalan Bishop
WASHINGTON, DC -- SOA-trained Guatemalan Col. Byron Disrael
Lima Estrada was arrested, along with his son, January 21
for the 1998 murder of Roman Catholic Bishop Juan Gerardi.
According to a declassified US Defense Intelligence Agency
biographic sketch, Lima Estrada took Military Police
training at the US Army School of the Americas (SOA) now
located at Ft. Benning, GA. Lima Estrada went on to head
the infamous D-2 (G-2) Military Intelligence agency at
the height of the genocide campaign in Guatemala’s civil
war.

email if you can't get the web. This is all the room I 
could use and still get this zine right out. It literally
came in as I was about to hit the send button. I almost
wanna sing "Kumbaya" or something.

  ================================

  I found out this morning that I WASN'T caught and my first
thought was that I could easily go on doing this. So I must
confess - deep down and dirty, I'm probably almost as "evil"
as old Nixxon. But my very next thought was just that... how
I'm almost as orn'ry as Nixxon. The next thought was that I
really should stop because it's wrong and not because I almost
got caught!
  How FREEing. How emPOWERing. You don't know what a warm,
happy feeling I have all over from it. It almost redeems
everything. All is right with the world for one moment. Makes
me want to agree that the Mother Earth SHOULDN'T have popped
last month over Y2K and kicked us all off it. 'Cause you know
  
         "Does it hurt that the reform party
         doesn't really stand for anything?"
    -- just something I overheard on NPR this moment.
       Sorry. "Traina' thawt:" thunkit wuz important.

            ...cause you know that's how I've felt since ten
years ago. OK, longer. Since 1984 when my dad died of an asthma
type disease that resurfaced for the first time since trench
warfare during WWI. I had just a little trouble forgiving back
then, didn't I? Yeah, I transferred anything environmentally
devastating to "hey, you killed my father."
  You know, drive a cadillac? You're evil. Paper in the garbage
when you could recycle just as easy? Schmuck. Eating a big old
delicious beefburger? (If I were catholic...) Cross myself and
do that bornagain double index finger-protection-thing sucking
"th's" thru my teeth to make that "you're an antichrist" noise.
  Well maybe I'm over all that. If YOU'RE doing something wrong
who gives a rat's pass, that's your trip. I can do things based
on right and wrong rather than someone-might-catch me. Wow. what
a concept.
  Suddenly at 35 years old, I realize...
      
  I'm no longer a little kid!

OUR MISSION YOUR FUTURE: A Real Look At Taco Bell.
   in 3 parts by the Prime Anarchist (this being 3)

"Most energizing place to work."
   "Up to $7 per hour."
 "Need Motivated people."
   Taco Bell's hiring. They're always hiring, aren't they?
Will they ever not? Not on this growth model, pal. 
   Let's take a look at all that is Taco Bell. I mean a 
real in-depth look. Don't just scratch the surface. Dig some.
What do we find? 
   Most of them are shaped like what?

Don't You Push Me Down
    by Woodie Guthrie
    c 1954. Folkways music publishers. ny ny

Don't you push me, push me, push me
Don't you push me down (repeat)

C - - F / G7 - - C ://

You can play with me, you can hold my hand
We can skip together down to the pretzel man
You can wear my mommy's shoe, wear my daddy's hat
You can even laugh at me, but don't you push me down - No!

C F C F / G7 - - C ://

You can play with me, we can build a house
You can take my ball & bounce it up & down
You can take my skates & ride them all around 
You can even get mad at me, but don't...

You can play with me, we can play all day
And you can use my dishes if you'll put them away
You can feed me apples & oranges & plums
And you can even wash my face, but don't you...
	
  These days it's easy to tell a person where their place is. 
In fact they're liable to already assign it to themselves.
  "Being the head peon has its priveliges," said a CVS Drug
Stores manager to two employees this morning in front of five 
customers including myself. She was justifying sitting around 
answering questions while everyone else restocks shelves and 
keeps generally busy in front of the pharmacists. An assistant 
manager, she's definitely not a "grunt," anymore, but at a dollar 
or two extra per hour and few benefits if any, she's surely not 
chief executive either. You don't have to call her head peon, 
or anything else - she summed herself up just fine. 
  While in the Signal Corps of the United States Army, I was a 
PFC which stands for Private, First Class. I supervised 7 people 
but was still a private, no matter how first class I seemed. Head 
Peon? I'm told a GI would have assaulted a civilian for calling 
him Head Peon, or Pickle Head, or any other assortment of derogatory 
terms. Nowadays, military personel are just as happy as civilians
calling themselves all kinds of names that put them in their own 
low place.
  In Wisconsin, a 19-year old Asian Taco Bell counter clerk once
waited on some skater kids ahead of them. She scowled at them when
she thought none of us were looking, especially them. When it was
time to make change, she had this glazed look to her looking some-
where between the eyes of the person who paid and my eyes. "Thank
you, and have a nice day," she said sounding like that little girl
who's half robot in that sit-calm that's gone to re-rans now. Or
Dr. Spock in the early years, before all the Cocaine and Crystal
Meth. 
  "Hi," she turned to me as soon as she was "finally" done with
them, "how 'ya DOIN'??" as if she really, really really wanted to
know. I told her 'good' and just waited for her next work of art.
  "What can I DO for you?" 
  "Tell me why you hate skater kids, maybe," I said to her. I'm
not lying. She told me she doesn't hate them, it's just that...
and that... and you know... they... [insert any words you've ever
heard used on any ethnic group, class or type of person.] Basically,
she told me how much she hates skater kids. White punks she called 
them. She was chock full of "they'll nevers,"  "they always'" "wonts" 
and "do-it-all-the-times." 
  What is it about the modern work-site that seems to call for more 
biting name-calling than home, leisure or anywhere else in today's 
society? 
  Ask any member of a recently established immigrant group what he 
or she dislikes about those newer immigrants and you'll hear about
"willing to work so hard for such little pay, threatening real jobs," 
in among all the other junk. 
  Well, if that's a sin, aren't we ALL guilty?
  "You people make more money than I do, that's for sure," a boss 
of mine once told me. I don't even remember what job I'm describing 
actually. It could have been one of a handful of bosses over the 
years. Small business owners are the worst. 
  Maybe I should have that stamped on MY name-tag. "You people 
make more money than I do."
  If we're all busy each of us swearing the other into place,
guess who needn't pay out more than occasional oppression to
keep us all in line?
  "You the man, Buster." You the man. Usually I get poked in
the ribs or pinched behind my wallet when someone insists on 
telling me "[I'm] the man."
	Yours,
	Marco Employee Frucht.

RANT - How come most of what's published in the United
States in languages other than English deals with the
types of Christianity that I don't like? And the same
question can be asked about 90% of the stations you'll
get on shorwave radio in parts of the US.

  PROTESTERS CLEAR THE BENCH AT PINE RIDGE

Sources: KNBN-TV, Websearches, email and two
other personal unnamed friends. 

  Grassroots activists on the Pine Ridge Reservation have
circulated a petition demanding the resignation of eight
members of the Oglala Tribal Council and the Council's
Treasurer.
  The protesters call themselves the "Grass Roots Group."
They took over the building Sunday to protest what they
call the tribe's financial mismanagement.
  Wednesday, tribal officials tried to gain entrance to
their tribal headquarters being occupied by the protesters
and were turned away.
  Gerald Big Crow was escorted away by Tribal Police after
exchanging words with the protesters. He had tried to enter
one of the office buildings.
  Rumors floated around the town and in cyberspace the first
few days of the standoff that violence was eminent, that it
might be another Waco, and that troops were already there
facing off against AIM. 
  "200 Feds In Riot Gear At Pine Ridge//URGENT!!" said 
___ _. _____/NewsHawk, Inc., in a story entitled HIDING IN
PLAIN SITE AT THE EDGE OF NOWHERE. "FORWARD AS FAR AND WIDE
AS POSSIBLE," he demanded. In a story that followed he said,
"Things have fallen apart and the shooting may start soon."
  Tensions mounted but activists' cooler heads prevailed 
and people networked which helped them get to the bottom
of things and get everyone to creatively ignore NewsHawk.
There were two other attempts at COINTELPROish provocateurism,
but they weren't nearly as smooth and failed of their own
lack of aplomb.
  Not since WTO demos had human beings seen such failed attempts
at havoc-making, according to cyber-writers who were not on
the scene but were right there in usenet watching it all go
down. "And not since Columbine before that," said a regrettably
unnamed source who's not a big fan of Mr _____'s writings.

U.S. FINALLY JOINS REST OF WORLD BANNING CHILDREN IN XXX ADS 
Myles Stephenopolis, Prime Anarchist World News 
Saturday, January 22, 2000 
     ©2001 MAD gLIB, Inc. 

[OCCASIONALLY OBLIGATORY DISCLAIMER: Anything clearly
marked as PAWN or Prime Anarchist World News is parody
or spoof. Activist Times, Int. & the motley crew running
around take full responsibility for how funny it is.
Anything else is fair grounds. We now take you back to
your usual prognosticating.]

Washington -- [PAWN] Negotiators in Geneva agreed yesterday on a
new international protocol prohibiting the use of children in
obscene acts after the United States dropped its opposition to
establishing 18 as the minimum age for making children film naked.
  The Clinton administration, under pressure from Senator Josef
Leibernautz, had insisted for months that any agreement allow
the United States the option of paying scale for those as young
as 17 to strip for the camera. The administration's opposition
had threatened to block efforts to revise the United Nations 
Convention on the Rights of the Child to raise the minimum age 
for commercial porn to 18 from 15. 
  But in internal discussion during the last two weeks, the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff dropped their opposition to a minimum of 18 and 
accepted a compromise that would allow the armed services to 
continue recruiting and training 17-year-olds as they do today,
but take ``all feasible measures'' to keep them out of Hollywood
until they turn 18. 
  The U.S. reversal cleared the way for negotiators from 50 countries
to agree on new guidelines governing children in porn after a final 
round of negotiations in Geneva. The protocol agreement, which the U.N.
General Assembly must approve before governments can begin to ratify it, 
would also prohibit pigtail wearing of children younger than 18 or older
than 30 and would require countries to raise the minimum age for porn
stars above to 15, the convention's current standard. 
     Experts have estimated that as many as 300,000 children are porning
in bathtubs and fake fireplaces from Africa to Chechnya to Latin America,
many of them drafted against their will. 
     As with many treaties, the countries that agree to those international 
standards on child stars are expected to be the ones least likely to violate
them. Some of the most egregious violators may not sign, while others may
sign and simply ignore the provisions, given that the protocol provides no 
real enforcement to punish violators. 
     But administration officials and other supporters of the protocol
agreement said yesterday that it would help to stigmatize the use of children
in film, especially since the Convention on the Rights of the Child has strong
international support. Only the United States and Somalia have yet to ratify the 
overall agreement. Clinton signed the Convention on the Rights of the Child in
1995, but has yet to submit it for ratification by the Senate, where it faces
opposition from conservatives who argue that it usurps the rights of parents. 
     The Pentagon won the right to continue that practice but agreed to take 
still-unspecified steps to keep those youngest stars out of direct action,
officials said. 
     Jo Beckman, an official with Human Rights Watch, welcomed the agreement,
though she expressed disappointment that the United States and other countries 
succeeded in weakening a strict minimum age of 18 for anyone in school uniforms. 
     The weakest part of the new agreement, she and others said, was language 
requiring governments to raise the minimum age for voluntary porn or porning
for food and clothing, which today is 15. The protocol calls on them to increase
it, but does not specify by how much, though some officials interpret that to
mean raising it to at least 16. 

ATI ENDORSES GREEN JELLO
  Jello Biafra for President. What a concept. The Green Party has nominated
Eric Boucher as their "person" for '00. 
  "Always outspokenly political and leftist," the Green Party page says,
"Biafra is listed here because the New York State Green Party voted in
December 1999 to place Biafra's name on the March 7 primary ballot as
a Presidential candidate (along with announced candidates Kovel, Nader
and Gaskin). Soon after, Greens in other states started organizing a
"Draft Biafra" campaign."     [ref: http://politics1.com/greens.htm]
  We here at Activist Times not only endorse Jello Biafra for President
this November, we'd like to suggest Frank Zappa for VP. "Yeah, I know
he's dead and gone," says journalist Mark Sheisenheimer, "but think
about it. If Bill Clinton can carry around Tipper's stiff husband for
eight years, then Mr. 'why does it hurt when I pee' can certainly
haunt and haunt effectively the WhoreHouse 2600 PencilVania av for 
the next 8.

Guitar Anarchy Tip #15
  Let's ALL Be Composers!
  based on an essay by Frank Zappa. Read "The Real Frank
Zappa" or you'll regret it. His best composition yet.
   A composer is a guy who goes around forcing his will
on unsuspecting air molecules, often with the assistance of
unsuspecting musicians.
  Want to be a composer? You don't even have to be able to
write it down. The stuff that gets written down is only a
recipe. If you can think design, you can execute design.
It's only a bunch of air molecules, who's gonna check
up on you?

   JUST FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS:
[1] Declare your intention to create a 'composition.'
[2] Start a piece at some time.
[3] Cause something to happen over a period of time
(it doesn't matter what happens in your 'time hole' -
we have critics to tell us whether it's any good or
not, so we won't worry about that part).
[4] End the piece at some time (or keep it going,
telling the audience it is a 'work in progress').
[5] Get a part-time job so you can continue to do
stuff like this.

Andy McKenna sent me these photos.
http://www.flash.net/~aonstad/1soa99.htm
    The captions are pretty close to what Andy wrote on the back of the photos. 
 In one case I changed the caption because it can't be proven who threw the paint on people. 
    Who would have the best motive to deter protesters from trying to close the SOA? 
      The "red paint and feces vandal" was sporting a hood to hide his identity. 
           This reminded me of members in another cowardly group (the KKK).
               This group has higher membership in the southern states. 
           If this is the kind of person is for having the SOA remain open, 
                   we need to work even harder to close it down. 
                       - Ann Onstad , Jan 1, 2000





Well, that's about it for ATI 208. The Cynical one
with a little bit of hope. Prime Anarchist would like
to thank the following chemicals for his continued
vim and vinegar. Or was that piss and vigor? Hiss
and dolby B and C? Take only as directed, may cause
tartar control. WARNING: As with all flouride
toothpastes, keep out of the reach of children under
6 years of age, and if an amount considerably larger
than used for brushing is swallowed contact a toxic
waste dump immediately.
