  Ah, mint chocolate chip ice cream.
  Won't piss off the vegetarians OR the carnivores.
Wise choice.
  So I wake up at 6am Monday wondering if McVeigh 
is dead or alive.
  It's got that rainy feeling on a day that's not
raining. Very hot, very humid. I'm tuning in NPR
and on the net. I think about something someone
sent me the other day.

I feel like screaming. Not the usual stuff. The new
stuff. "What the fvck's wrong with you? What's wrong
with us? Where are we going?" 
  Why are we fouling our own "living room," comes to
mind. Why are we so bent on revenge and thinking 
NOTHING of conflict resolution. Is anyone still thinking
we must avenge Oh Simma "Heavy" Bin Laden for all this?
I shudder to think there is.

Do you want to just scream? Do you have NO THOUGHTS? Do
you just wish it would all go away? Do you have that
hairy furball feeling in your throat? 
  You're the principal and this kid has come to your
attention. You even try "what punishment would you give
yourself if you were me?" And he tells you peel off all
his skin while he screams, and make him recite the song
"Cockles and Muscles" to a whisper until he's finally
dead.
  How do you punish someone like that? How? Can you? Is
there any punishment valid when he tells you it's just
as much your fault as his? And you know he's right???

"One of Amsterdam's most attractive features, which I noticed
the first day, was its "outdoor" nature. Lots of people in
the parks and streets, sidewalk cafes everywhere, constant 
bicycle traffic, music from organ grinders and buskers, and
more noise from conversation than from cars."
  --Phillip Agee. From his book "On The Run."

 Louder Than Bombs is a non-violent direct action 
 noise brigade that uses mostly (but not only) homemade 
 instruments. 
   We belive in the following: Anti-Racism, Anti-Sexism, 
 Anti-Globalization, Anti-Militarization, Environmental 
 Protection, Human Rights, and Animal Rights. We plan 
 to use noise as a means of protest to fight for these 
 causes. We need help starting this group. If you are 
 interested in working with us and believe in any of 
 our causes, contact us. Please be willing to share 
 any ideas you have. Hope to work with you in the 
 future. 
 No Justice, No Silence!

Name of reflection: I bring you this poem:

June 4, '97. a poem by Punkin. 
Allouez, WI 1997. [reprinted from ATI 84]
    
Emotionless dehumanization,
Slaves to consumerism;
Sweat stings the naked eye,
And your gut wrenches:
As the sickening smell of
Factory fumes invade your lungs-
The unborn remain so,
Robots not capable of childbirth.
Are you the manufacturer,
Or the manufactured?
