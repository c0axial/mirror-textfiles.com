A lot has happened since http://www.etext.org/Zines/ASCII/ATI/ati324.txt
It's sure to take weeks to tell you. So let's start here I guess...



Hey Corporate Media. Your Numbers Are Foul Again

  "Hundreds of blacks rallied in front of the Capitol," says
Associated Press, "on Saturday to demand slavery reparations, 
saying that compensation is long overdue for the ills of that 
institution."

  My local newspaper says "several thousand." If you did some
real ground work you'd likely find that tens or hundreds of
thousands were rallying. And I'm sure you are fully aware.
Unless you just don't care. And if that's the case, tear up
your Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism
diploma [sic.] or use it for the toilet paper it is. Because
all you learned there is how to be a yes man for Central
Intelligence and an economic slave of the Army Corps of
Engineers.

  So I guess what I'm saying mostly, is the only way EITHER
news statements could remain accurate is by allowing for 
hundreds or thousands of hundreds to still mean "hundreds." 
Likewise, tens or hundreds of thousands would have to mean 
"several thousand."

  You've done this before. In fact you always do it.

  You suck.

In June, after the British musical group the Planets introduced 
a 60-second piece of complete silence on its latest album, 
representatives of the estate of composer John Cage, who once 
wrote "4'33"" (273 seconds of silence), threatened to sue the 
group for ripping Cage off (but failed, said the group, to specify 
which 60 of the 273 seconds it thought had been pilfered).
  Said Mike Batt of the Planets: "Mine is a much better silent 
piece. I (am) able to say in one minute what (took Cage) four 
minutes and 33 seconds."

POP GOES THE MUSICIAN
Todays popular sound of music has dealt a knockout
punch to a lot of musicians who play musical
instruments. Well, whatelse do musicians play? Lots!
The scene these days is all about musicians who play
turntables, groove boxes, floppy drives and whatever
it is that creates todays hip sounds of popular music.
Take the case of my talented musician friend Earnie
the songster. He's been hit by himself! Earnie was
amoung the first few guitar players who switched over
to keyboards with automatic bass/drums/chords,
starting a 'one man band' trend that rendered his
fellow band members redundant. The one man band scene
ruled and why not? Earnie had a family to support,
playing in a band could only pay half his bills,
'being' the band paid all his bills. Few years down
the line the popular one man band trend has given way
to the 'no man band'. One does not necessarily have to
be a musician to create todays cool sounds of popular
music. DJ'ing, programing, sequencing, sampling is
where it's at baby. Today a DJ or a computer
programmer creates the cool sounds that spearhead
popular musics evolution. So what does my friend
Earnie do now? You've guessed right! Alright peeps in
the house, please welcome DJ Earnie who's gonna spin
some mean disc while scratching the shit out of them
vinyl frisbees! And by the way, DJ'ing these days pays
even next years bills!

Hey, Marco,

I and some other media folks recently did an interview 
that you might be interested in hearing.  We spoke with 
David Rovics when he played in our town in northeastern
Connecticut.  As I recall, you are also a songwriter who 
pays attention to political and media matters.
  That's why I thought I'd tell you about it.
  The interview can be heard at:

  or at

FYI.

A short "ad-aware" report.

The other day I ran "ad-aware" on a friend's computer,
among the many things I did to help her get her machine
to run faster.
  She shares it with a few other people who all live 
together, and a bunch of us who live elsewhere but 
occasionally visit and/or logon a little.
  She likes to download a lot of music, as do many of
her roomies. This is never a problem from a philosophical
point of view. But I see two areas where it's problematic.

1) Hard Drive defrag in windows environment necessary weekly
2) Doubleclick (TM)

The makeup of a hard drive is changed a LOT when you download
lots of songs and are always deleting about half of the things
you download, including things you listened to half way through
and decided you didn't want it. (the internet is chock full of
things someone called a song leaving you wondering if they even
know what a song is)
  So all those changes will get your harddrive pretty fragmented.
If you don't do it weekly, then when you do finally decide to run
defrag.exe (or dfrg.msc to be precise) it'll cost you about an 
hour and a half.
  The dreaded doubleclick. And all the other spyware, annoyware,
suckyware. I ran ad-aware.exe and it found over 600 different
kinds of spyware to isolate and yank out of her hard drive. Why?
Well, they probably downloaded and reinstalled Audiogalaxy, 
Napster, Limewire and etc., on a regular basis, and I'll bet many
of the people sharing that computer don't know very much about
spyware, cookies, ads, etc. 
  The sleazy corporations deliberately make their installations
look warm and fuzzy, and invite you to click on nice neat things
that will fill up your harddrive with garbage that smells worse
than the bottom of a dumpster at a meat-packing plant. (I've 
smelled one, you don't wanna go there)
  I'm talking really warm and fuzzy. One even has a smiley 
purple furry gorilla you can click on if you want to buy some
of their products or something. Another stores every password
you type in for the next few days in what they insist will only
be one file right there on your harddrive. Hmmm. Is that particular
directory world readable? Are they telling you the truth about it
not being backed up anywhere else online or offline? Hmmm. Ask 
yourself this. They're a corporation who broke into your home
uninvited, or at best coerced under duress. You expect complete
honesty from them??
  Anyhew, each time they installed or reinstalled something it
probably added 2-5 new spywares. No wonder the system was going
so slowly. There's half a thousand programs all trying to do 
the same thing through your COM port. Scream bloody murder things
like "She's typing a letter P!!!" "She's clicking on an ad with
a naked lady!!!" "She's asked in GOOGLE about cheap planefare!!!"
"She just got email from someone private!" "Oh my god, she just
typed the word 'viagra' (TM) in usenet. Quick, sell her all kinds
of things!!!"
  These harmless looking little programs are all studying the hell
out of your purchasing habits. And if half a dozen people use your
computer day in and day out, there's a corporation out there that
thinks you're a big spender and a perfect victim, even if you haven't
bought a single thing online. They see your activity, they don't care
at all what you've done with it. Adding you to their list of spams
is just fine for them; whether you ever buy something or not. Your
worth a LOT to them. 
  But they're not willing to pay you even a penny.
  Take their shit and get it off your system and keep ridding yourself
of them.
  Run programs like ad-aware as often as you can.

Russia Points To Major Nest Of Terror
GEORGIA -- [PAWN] The Russian defense minister said
Friday that Georgia had evolved into the world's 
second major "nest" of international terrorism after
Afghanistan.
  It was the latest salvo in the escalating war of
nerves between the two former world paramilitaries.
  Russia has long accused Georgia of harboring 
deathsquads in its lawless School of Americas near
the border with Fort Benning. Moscow has demanded
that Georgian authorities allow Russian troops to
enter Georgia and flush them out.

When you radicalize almost everyone around you
many of them will radicalize you when you need
it. 
  When you die they will radicalize each other;
and when you are born again it will be some of
them to remind you.

|| |||  ||| ||  ||

I read an interview in the local paper where 
they were asking Michelle Shocked "you've had
a reputation as someone who works completely
independent of commercial considerations. Does
having your own label make you more or less
cognizant of commercial issues?"
  And Michelle says "that reputation isn't
accurate. I don't ignore commercial considerations.
I take them into account, and THEN I completely
ignore them.
