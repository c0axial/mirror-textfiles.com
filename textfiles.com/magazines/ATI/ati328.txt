I REMEMBER YOUR SMILE WHEN I BUSKED TOO
         a poetical journey
              by marco capelli

Long whispy blond(e) hair
Black sweatshirt, no bra
Bluejeans - and red M&Ms
Sticking out of your
Back right pocket

Round Gandhi glasses, 
And a Golden smile

Black Chuck Taylors
And a bouncy walk

Thank you for shuffling
Right past the starbucks
And buying some locally roasted
Coffee to go on a Sunday morning

Milwaukee - 22sep02

Next up, a "publisher's column"
in the form of a letter to a town.

Milwaukee, 
  You're determined to do a high-speed rail between
CHI-MAD-MKE, aren't you??
  Ask the people in NYC-BOS-DC, why don't you? Let
them tell you what a smashing failure it's become.
  Not for the idea, that was great. For the timing.
If you finished it in '98 it'd likely sustain itself
on into the decades or centuries. But beginning even 
moments AFTER '98 was just plain folly.

Now, can I rant?
Thanks:

As soon as "911" is thirteen months old I'm gonna
go ahead and say it out loud. 

"THE PRESS HAS FINALLY OUTDONE OJ SIMPSON."

Time To Start Turning The Stone, 
If the Iraqui "regime" wishes peace
It will urge the sadistic George W
To step down.

Yikes! Bush is on my car radio waxing rationalizingly
why we're either about to, or already have invade(d)
Iraq.
  I can't tell by his rhetoric OR his tone of voice.
He makes too many teleprompt errors AND malapropisms
to get that feel the way you can with past prez's.

Do you object?
Are you conscientious
That you object?
You're probably a
Conscientious objector

I'm looking for a university out there that either
was or will be -- but is not right now -- under
construction. 
  Good luck, eh?

Good day,
  My name is Ron Steele and I am a frequent reader.
  I am originally from St. Lucia, West Indies a tiny 
island in the Caribbean with less than 180,000 residents. 
I am interested in creating a page similar to yours. I like 
the layout.
  Can you provide any thoughts, guidelines? Do you use any 
special software that makes the production easier?
  Thanks in advance for your time and consideration.

Hey Marco,

Need a cool recipe? Corn chip or hard tortilla shell.
Spread some mayo on it, then dash garlic powder, cayenne,
lime, and any other spices you dig. Great for those
restaurants that throw out entire boxes of chips when
they're still quite good.

"I wish the kids with the stickers and stencils could get
the space and credit they need for keeping an artistic
dialogue going. I'd like to see more local artists approach
the powers that be about altering our public spaces. At the
same time, those powers need to be made a little more open
to taking a chance on the changes artists of all disciplines
can offer, and willing to take the responsibility for the
consequences, good or bad."

Midwest Retreat
   a poem by marco

When Malcolm and Martin come together
Do they say "nunca mas?"
Do they give a jive-style handshake,
A high five, 
Or the corporate hand-pump handshake
With the left hand cupping the other's
Right -- so as to say, "I am here."

Presente!

When Malcolm and Martin come together
Do people stop everything?
Do nuns pray.
Do angels sing.
Do birds drop feathers.

I saw more than a dozen different
Young eagles flying
Around near the Mississippi
River last weekend.

Malcolm and Martin
Were together again
For another millisecond
In Sugar Creek Iowa.

Milwaukee -- 19sep02

"I also look for the day when some federal judge in some
federal court in this land of ours joins nonviolent 
peacemakers in not only recognizing the immorality of
these weapons of mass destruction but also sees them as
criminal devices in criminal hands that pose a threat
to all human life."

Italy - Vatican - Side door where the homeless shelter 
and soup kitchen is.
  Taxis everywhere. Everyone's in a big hurry except me.
  I'm enjoying seeing this for the first time having heard
about it for a couple years running now. Gourmet chipped
beef on toast and a split pea soup. Served by a chef in
check pants and cookwhites.

C.O.

by a veteran named Jeff

I’d vowed once 
not to meet the bitch 
under any but the most noble 
of circumstances. 

Ah, to be swept 
up by her, into her, 
womb, truth, being. 
To be sundered awash 

in her crimson gutter, 
the waxen awe of 
someone I’ll never know 
my statement to all. 

A yellow-green sacrifice 
to some such forgotten 
worthy cause as "liberty."

I’ve come now 
to regard that pit 
as a poor attempt, 
and wonder 
whose climax I’ve breached. 

For, a whore is truly worthless, 
and permeates all.

   - PRESS RELEASE -
   =================

What started as a simple anniversary party for a farm 
based on radical nonviolence and sustainable living, 
may be turning into one of the biggest anti war 
organizing events to be seen in the US this year. 

"War is Over if You Want It" is running September 27-29 
at Anathoth Community Farm in Luck, Wisconsin just 90 
minutes northeast of Mpls./St.Paul. The three day event 
includes, an art show, bonfires, concessions, hiking, 
volleyball, a peace fair, teach-ins, and lots and LOTS 
of music. Tickets for the 16 act stage event are $20. 
Free camping will be available. 

"It's a real life Field of Dreams," said Mike Miles, 
one of the organizers of the event. "Many people are 
extremely concerned about the cry for war coming out 
of Washington. We have a farm, the organizing skills, 
and the resources, so we are going to build it and see 
if anyone comes". 

"It" includes a seven acre field that will be home to 
a forty foot long stage and 50,000 watts of sound and 
lights. Thirty acres of hay have been mowed into lawn 
to accommodate camping and parking. 

The activist community, which claims "over 100 years 
of experience in practicing non violent resistance to 
war" as well as, "having spent collectively a dozen 
years in prison for peace", is working with students 
and activists all over the upper Midwest to organize 
the weekend's events in only three months. 

Thousands of flyers and posters are being distributed 
in a five state area. Miles reports that the internet 
is buzzing with a flurry of in and outgoing messages 
that seem to be multiplying out of nowhere. "In twenty 
five years of peace organizing, I have never seen 
anything like it", said Miles. "In six days, something 
is coming up the driveway and if the weather is good, 
it could be big, very very big."
