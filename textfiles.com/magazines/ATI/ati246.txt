Can I rant a little?
  I just watched a minute and a half of
"Jackass" on MTV. Why? Because I didn't
even watch two minutes. That's why.
Now that Click and Clack are more the
mythological icons than Frick and Frack; 
and paintball is more acceptable for a
friday night than splashing paint on a
wall - when you cannot tell the difference
between an ass and an elephant -
and when everything Arthur Miller ever
"said" begins flashing before your eyes 
like a Rocky Horror nightmare from 
"transexual, transylva-a-a-a-a-a-ania... 
it's time for a truly new economy.

more conveniences, but less time; we have more degrees, but 
less sense; more knowledge, but less judgment; more experts, 
but less solutions; more medicine, but less wellness.
  We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values.
We talk too much, love too seldom, and hate too often. We've 
learned how to make a living, but not a life; we've added 
years to life, not life to years.
  We've been all the way to the moon and back, but have 
trouble crossing the street to meet the new neighbour.
We've conquered outer space, but not inner space; we've 
cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul; we've split 
the atom, but not our prejudice. We have higher incomes, 
but lower morals; we've become long on quantity, but short 
on quality.
  These are the times of tall men, and short character; steep 
profits and shallow relationships; these are the times of world 
peace, but domestic warfare; more leisure, but less fun; more 
kinds of food, but less nutrition.
  These are days of two incomes, but more divorce; of fancier

Splitting hairs of eternity
  a poem by Larry Jaffe

In first grade
we learned how
to split hairs
and hate each other.
It was our first dose
of competition
after playing
cowboys and Indians.

As competitive spirits roam
derived from the legacy
of vacuum cleaner salesmen
and the fuller brush man
who came door to door
slacking their valuables
for all to see.

The drying
damp folds of
eternity worried us
like nothing before
our future
stretched out loud
for all to see.

The dying
quick jabs
of eternity
that seemed
to knock us
from the
wheels of progress.

The times we placed
superstition superior
to knowledge.

Not that I know of. The goodly portion of anti-personell mines are
made in Janesville, WI in a factory where the corporation had gone
bankrupt when Vietnam ended. Local historians out here in Wisconsin
know what it was making before WWII and it wasn't war related, but
I forget what they'd said, but they went from many different implements
of war 1930's to 1970's, to just making land mines a decade or so ago.

> And NO.. not >>>all<<< Engineers/Designers work for military projects.

very true, and there's a growing ethic these days to demand that
you be informed what your end product is, and if it's not what you
can live with or they can't tell you, you go find business elsewhere.
Some have taken major paycuts, of course, but others have found out
they can make more than they ever dreamed of doing ONLY WHAT THEY
BELIEVE IN.

I will tell you that the man who designed the "gooksniffer," 
(yes, I'm told it was patented with that name so you can 
see a little of where the horrible old man McCain comes 
from when he insists he can't get it out of his vocab)
knew exactly what he was building. 
  It compared the body temperature between a US soldier 
and a North Vietnamese soldier and toasted "him" and all 
his friends the minute it zeroed in on a NVA. It was used 
for a week and he was paid in full by the US Gov't. But they
recalled it because it turns out Japanese-American soldiers 
and assorted others who ate a mainly rice diet their whole 
life before enlisting had a similar body temperature and 
we were killing some of our own by accident. Also there's
a wild pig out in North Vietnam that carries the same body 
temp; and the US government has had a rule of engagement 
for over 150 years now that you are NOT to kill any of 
the wildlife (expecially University of Connecticut 
students... [sorry that part's not true, I couldn't 
resist.]) unless for survival.

So anyhew it was shitcanned as a bad invention. 

I have a question: who the hell wakes up in the morning 
and says "I know, gooks eat rice, I eat meat. I'll design 
something that will act like a robot and go kill them."  
And then who the hell actually builds it???

And further, who sells it to a military?!?

And lastly, why the hell aren't we attaching with our 
annual tax payments a list of things we know the US is 
up to that we can't live with????

Tuuli are Hotties.
A non-record review.
  by Marco
I bought a signed copy of Tulli's 10" 
from Jenny, Claire and Dawn.
I like it a lot. I'd write up a record
review, and a blurb about meeting them
and having a crush on a couple of them
but I don't feel like it, so I'll have
to do it later. For now I'll just say
they sound a little like that band, oh
what did they call themselves? They 
did that song in the mid 80's called
"Tell That Girl To Shut Up."
  They're kind of punkish, and kind of
poppish. They're from Canada, they're
on the 'Sympathy' record label. What
more can I say? They look really good
in makeup and leopardskin leotards and
stuff.
