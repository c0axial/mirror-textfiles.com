I finally figured out who Miller Williams is/was
Remember when Clinton made him National Poet and
I asked, "What, who? Who what?" I mean I know a
couple of his poems, but where does he suddenly
get picked by a president like a pablo casals
or a picasso painting?
   Well, I'm reading liner notes to a Tom T. 
Hall album I'm working out on this week. "Sub-
division Blues." A hit-kicking country song that
got my attention a little while ago. "Miller
Williams teaches in the creative writing prog.
at U of Ark. He is noted as an editor, antholo-
gist, and translator, most recently in CHILE:
AN ANTHOLOGOY OF NEW WRITING. His critical works
include JOHN CROWE RANSOM, HIS POEMS and THE
ACHIEVEMENTS OF JOHN CIARDI."
   "Listen," says Miller Williams. I think I will.
   Well, there you go.
   So welcome to ATI, Activist Trouble in India;
I'm Prime Anarchist and this is the 'Zine for 
tonite. We've got some really neat things. Rather
than list it all here like most pubbers do, I'll just
say enjoy the heck out of it, ok? "Listen."

Saturday, 1pm - I'm sitting in a fake wigwam inside 
a local museum. There's concrete under my feet
made to look like well swept mud. And the seat I'm
on appears to be made of hardwoods, but it just may
be plastics. Everyone insists on plastic these days.
As if I'm Dustin Hoffman in "The Graduate." 
   I'll bet the people who've constructed the "thatch"
weaves above me have never slept inside a house made
entirely out of cat-tails like I have, have they?
   Oh well, the stuff behind glass, the text and the
5 or 6 recorded noises I keep hearing from other parts
of this museum all go into taking most people half way
to knowlege and 1/10 of the way to experience, eh?
   I won't dis that even though it's certainly not my
trip.

Attention Wal-Mart Lawyers

This website was created by me, Richard L. Hatch. 
I created this page as a direct result of the crude 
and abusive treatment from your Bangor, Maine Wal-Mart. 
I feel it is time someone stood up to the harassment 
consumers and collectors have to put up with in the
past, present and future. I suppose its ok for 
associates and managers to offend the general public, 
but its not ok for the consumer to voice their opinions.
  This page is here to stay. I will have my family 
lawyer review this site and remove all copyright 
violations.   I am sure the publicity will make 
Wal-Mart look like the bullies they really are. 
If you think you can intimidate me into removing 
this page you are mistaken.
The Bangor, Maine Manager(Brian Cabel) said to me 
"I have fried bigger fish than you". 
  My comment  "Maybe so but none nastier".
  To William D. Coston,
  You need to represent more honest retailers, 
unlike WAL-MART.  These stores ruin the little 
business man.  I can see the headlines now:
   WAL-MART SUES HANDICAPPED UNEMPLOYED
     MAN OVER FREEDOM OF SPEECH ISSUES.

Correction (reprinted from Gear, a phine menz mag)
The article "When presidential candidates attack" 
stated that George W. Bush killed an Army recruit 
during a cocaine-fueled rampage in Texas in 1974. 
Apparently this is not true.
We regret the error.

Guitar Anarchy Tip # 14
New Chords for Billie Holiday's "Strange Fruit"

Em
Southern trees bear a strange fruit,
Am                      Em
Blood on the leaves and blood at the root,
Em
Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze,
Am                             (?)     Em
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.


Pastoral scene of the gallant south,
The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth,
Scent of magnolia, sweet and fresh,
Then the sudden smell of burning flesh.

Here is a fruit for the crow to pluck,
For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck,
For the sun to rot, for the tree to drop,
Here is a strange and bitter crop.


notes: The (?) chord I discuss is either
an Em with something under the / or an Am
with "/" I'll tab the two fingerings that
work here. I care much less about theory
and much more about expression of meaning.
Otherwise I'd spend the next week searching
for what its true anglo title is. I'll
probably hear back that it's Am11 or
Am suspended, and again thanks for that, but
the chord itself is much more important
to me than what we arbitrarily call it.
So here it is:

-0-    -7-
-1-    -8-
-0-    -9-
-2(0)  -10-
-2-    -0-
-0-    -0-

After each verse I overlay part of
the famous anonymous piece "Romanza"
which just about every classical guitarist
in this world has beaten to death.
Just a short bit of it. Too much of it
loses you the momentum that this song
posesses as its forte no matter what
form it takes. I don't use it as an
intro because it seemed way too hokey.
I go right into the first words of this
song over a solid Em strum.

Here's TAB for some of the melody.

-3--3-----3----3---2---0------0-
--------------------------------

Southern trees bear a strange fruit    ...pahp-lar trees

And lastly, Guitar Anarchy Tip # 15

Who is/was Carlos Montoya?
   I have one album so far. By far the best Gypsy guitar
album I've got right now. I've surrounded myself with a
lot of great guitar music this past year. Of course some
of the worst too, but I firmly believe that's 95% subjective
 - based entirely on any personal whims and biases we each
carry. Baggage check is over there. [points with chin...]
   For instance, who but me loves Pablo Casals AND Andres
Segovia? One supported Spain after Guernica, after WWII,
while the other denounced Spain AND Hitler right from the 
get go. Why do I love both? Too complicated to tell you here.
   Why do I think the famous understudy, Parkening is a 
yutz and a weenie, and nothing to do with the fact that he's
Christian? See what I mean? It has to be my personal quirkie
whim, huh?
   I really dig Carlos Santana even though he's only half
catholic. 
   Jimmy Page is a fraud. Again, nothing to do with his 
immersion in Church of Satan. There's some really great
Satanist guitarists out there. Witches too. You should hear
them. You should. Page can't do anything more than Em and
Am scales. And not even THAT all the way up and down the
neck. Fraud - I worshipped the guy for 14 years. Defended
his name. Never again.
   Beware false profits.
   Yet another whimsaical quirk?
   You'd think I really respect Jimi Hendrix wouldn't you -
he's 3 times as "native american" as Wayne Newton and Tim 
McGraw put together by most accounts. 
   Wrong, try again. 
   His father is a money-grubbing greed head, tarnishing
anything Jimi could have ever struggled for. Forever. A huge
pock mark on the entire house and lineage of Hendrix.
   Anyhow, I love some flamenco and can't stand some 
"legitimate music," classical guitar, I write both and 
score in both SN (standard notation) and TAB (tablature). 
Should I keep my mouth shut in hopes of scoring $700 an 
hour gigs sometime in the next decade?
   You betcha. I should. I won't.
   I will play for food and travel for the rest of my life, 
teaching some of the cheapest "sliding-scale" guitar lessons
this world has ever known, working whatever odd jobs are necessary
to keep the myth a reality. Or the reality a myth as it were.
   Why?
Because it's the only way I can live with myself.
   Oh, I left out Eddie Van Halen, didn't I?
Don't get me started...

Have you considered the economic impact and importance
of coffee? The coffee industry employs over twenty million
people worldwide. The US imports over four billion dollars 
worth of coffee per year. Coffee is one of the world's most
valuable commodities: only oil ranks higher in terms of 
dollars traded in the international market. Coffee is 
considerably more romantic than oil -- a fact of considerable 
import to coffee lovers around the world.

Can you guess this guitarist's name? 
 Unsatisfied with her home life, she became close
 with several of the local Native American Indians.
 She soon found herself adopted by the tribe. As 
 she explains it, "[They] took me out to a meadow
 and said, 'Your life in the future will call for 
 you to speak honestly to people. You don't know
 how to speak from your heart, and you need to 
 learn how.' I remember going on top of a mountain
 and trying to say anything honest - just to the
 wind. I was crying because I couldn't say anything
 sincere." 
  According to her, she gleaned a lot of her 
  spirituality from the experience. "The American
  Indian thing had a big influence on me," she claims.
  "You adopt the Indian way. Everybody is your uncle
  or aunt."
 Two of her "uncles" were very wise and influential
 members of the Ottawa tribe. Jewel recalls, "One said
 I was going to bring heart to the people."
  Very often, the simple truths of spiritual people,
  like the Ottawa Indians, make more sense, and hold
  more reality than any scientifically measured facts.
  Somehow her Native American "uncle" must have seen
  into the future and read a Billboard magazine album
  chart from the 1990's, because this Jewel in the 
  rough, was destined to do exactly that.

[hint: she yodels well...][the last sentence was a huge
  letdown for me, but I chose to leave it in to show you
  what can be done in our great hurry to box someone up
  and stick all their square pegs into round holes and 
  verse vice-a]

We end this edition of ATI with:

      "Do Without"
A public domain poem/song 
by Chrysalis Aristaeus 11/03/99

So we've come to year 2000, looking over the brink.
Things are pretty nasty when you stop to think.
It's been known for long time what's the root of it all.
Let go o' the purse strings, see the filthy glitter fall.

If I give to you your needs and you give to me what's mine,
we'll watch old Exxon wave bye bye, Coke Cola dry and die.

Chorus:
Money is one thing we can do without!
Money is one thing we can do without!
Join up in the chorus, scream and shout!
Money is the one thing we can do without!

Stick it to your landlord, gone on too long.
We're born here on this planet, it's here that we belong.
Doctors here among us to heal the sick
But when they charge you for their beemers
Time to give them the kick.

When flowers grow on freeways, skies aren't wrecked by jets,
Take a breath of fresh air, it's as good as it gets.

Chorus

Get to know your neighbor when you urge to roam.
Kids'll have their families when you stay at home.
Not to be a wage slave is easy to do.
Give your boss the finger, we'll take good care of you.

Learn to eat the food you grow, share it with your friends.
These are simple means I know. You'll really love the ends.

Chorus

But when they come to shoot you
Where you gonna run?
Just know you did the right thing
Saying farewell to the sun.
