Hello, welcome to ATI. I'm Prime Anarchist
and this is the hackerzine for Sunday. 
We missed a new moon and a full moon, 
didn't we? I guess we vacationed on the
wrong side of the lakebed.
A couple newbiznzz's and then on to
the same old same olds.
 . The telnet party has been moved up 
   from 1/1/2000 to 9/9/99 and it will
   run until about 1/15
 . The final two quarters to be printed/
   minted will be Georgia and Conn. Then
   Massachussetts and Maryland will begin
   the year off.
 . Matt Drudge is not very bright.
 . Elizabeth Dole is about as bright as
   a) Matt Drudge
   b) A 40 watt bulb
   c) The 5th Teletubby
   d) All of the Above 
 . Introducing the all new fire engine red
   episode I Phantom Menace thong syth panty.
   Only at Victoria's Secret.
 . Van Heusen sucks.
Welp, we've got a couple letters, some 
numbers, and then some weird stories. 
The usual bunch of Diderots.
Enjoy.

Am I imagining it, or has Dejanews.com
shifted gears from up-to-the-minute updates to
daily updates?

The last 3 wars, or 5 years, take your pick,
I've watched deja change to updates every
5 or 6 hours and then back to "normal," after
Columbine, the more "crucial" Yugoslavia moments,
drubbings of Iraq, and major protests around the
world.

I guess my question is, "is management going on?"

Slavery


                DEEP MINES

   My mines I slave both days and nights
     dark depths conceal hard hammered bones.

   One hollow cavity I follow
      suckled pulse loud pounding soundly
        gem pleasures dire, mass mother lode.

   Core shaft pursue bright gilded veins
       gleam ruptured passion
       in my minds eye
     you're mine I find dear lover.

CIA Sells Laptop PCs with "Top Secret" files

The WP [Washington Post] reveals that a 
25-year covert CIA operative was faulted 
for "a major lapse of CIA security" when 
he allowed about 25 CIA laptop computers 
to be sold to the public at auction while 
still containing Top Secret information 
on their hard drives. Was the lapse 
discovered by some Tom Cruise-led Impossible 
Mission Force? 
Uh, no--just the private citizen 
who bought some of the computers.

GUITAR ANARCHY TIP #9
 Teach a student diminished and augmented
chords first. Only then begin sight
reading, and fretting major, minor and
seventh chords.
 They'll develop much faster with NO
CODEPENDENCY and won't need lessons after
two or three months because they'll be 
able to teach themselves everything else
they need. They'll become brilliant 
songwriters and will find a voice in this
world rather than sounding like the next
Zeppelin clone or Mariah Carey soundalike.
They'll come to you periodically for real
good questions you can charge honest good
money for rather than weekly crap.
BONUS: For further anarchy, find out where
students are taught in a large factory-like
setting, and just offer as many free 
lessons as you can handle in a week.
Teach them Anarchy Tip #9.
 You'll either be the one who caused MTV to
show up in your town declaring it the next
Motown, Austin or Seattle, or you'll be 
banned from the large chain music store.
 Hopefully both.

SHAREHOLDERS OK CHINA, USA DEAL.
DALLAS - China's plan to create the
world's largest publicly traded country
with an $88 Megabillion buyout of USA
was approved by both sets of couch 
potatoes and armchair warriors.
  The law firm of Milossevic, Gates,
Pinochet and Albright have yet to 
approve the acquisition, and completion
is still months away. China estimates 
the takeover would add billions more
dead trees and purple tomatoes to its
repertoire.
  Only 9,000 jobs will be cut when both
countries move their work to Mexico and
Indonesia.
  Shareholder Manuel P. Noriega said he
only had one regret about the merger.
  "Too bad Exxon and Mobil don't come 
with the package."

PAPRAZZA
<PAWN> A Prime Anarchist Patent Request
And a Ziggy Zig Ah.
WASHINGTON - (lib. of cong.) John Williams
was denied his request to register the 
word "music," and all aspects thereof.
  In a 5-4 landmark decision, Billygoat
Renkist was asked over to Library of 
Congress to break the tie. He said, and
I quote, "THERE ARE STILL A COUPLE OTHER
PEOPLE OUT THERE WRITING SONGS, MUSICALS
AND MOVIE SCORES. UNTIL THE LAST WRITER
BEGINS DECOMPOSING YOU MAY  N O T  
REGISTER THE WORD 'MUSIC.'"
  Renkist went on to say he didn't care
that the computer musician did Amistad,
that he did all the Star Wars, Seven years
in Tibet, Jurassic Park 1, 2 and 3 in 4D,
and Shindler's Lists, Home Alone Again,
JFK The Wonder Years, Jaws, ET, Superman,
Close Encounters, Galywag, Bimbos Beating
Bikers With Baseball Bats, Revenge of the
Noids, Attack of the Killer Gefilte Fish
and Fried Purple Onions. 
  He just wasn't going to stand by "and
watch all of the music besides what Michael
Jackson and Paul McCartney own get bought
up by one middle-aged white man.

And in other Washington DC news...
CHELSEA CLINTON CAUGHT SPAMMING
<PAWN> 25,000 Stanford Students received 
an anonymous one-paragraph message 
accusing the university of giving preference
in housing to non-whites, said Rachel Lotan,
a professor who received the e-mail.
  "It was just signed 'Chelsea!'" said
Lotan, "but everyone knows who THAT is."
  Bill Clinton is running IRS, TRW and FBI
checks on every student to see who would
obviously forge his daughter's name, address
and ISP.

If you're reading this in the car while
talking on the coffee, sipping some 
cellphone and maneuvering JNCO jeans
while putting on some traffic you're
not alone.
  Consider the results of a nationwide

  Or don't.

IN SOMEONE ELSE'S BED
        a pome for the end of ATI
        by Anarchist Prime

Dear Genghis
   While you took yourself a couple 
   Extra hours sleep.
An incompetant man wiped out 
  a whole village of neutrals.
Another one laid off your own boss' son.
Three seperate platoons were destroyed
  by friendly fire.
Your mistress was outed - Royal family?
  she's a wild one.

Dear Genghis
   While you took yourself a couple 
   Extra hours sleep.
Three prisoners of war are now out on the prowl
Twenty bombs were designed to blow off
  before launch
They're lighting the sky with what you promised
  never.
Seven horsemen are haunting you there on your
  haunch.

[spoken deeply] your daughter got raped 
                by your own troops.

Dear Genghis
   While you took yourself a couple 
   Extra hours sleep.
The peace talks were stalled well before
  the great summit
12 angry men think they have won 
  the whole world
Nobody can breath 'cause there's nothing but
  sulphur
And all because each of us wanted your girl.

Dear Genghis
   While you took yourself a couple 
   Extra hours sleep.
Your mother retired and refused to command
Your father was killed off in one final stand.
The hospitals filled up with all of your 
  youth
A third or fourth "hitler" has set forth his
  plan.

[spoken tenderly] and there you set 
                  dreaming
                  avoiding the truth                                                                     
