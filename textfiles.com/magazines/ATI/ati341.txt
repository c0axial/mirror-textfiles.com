My friend Joyce planned a Sunday afternoon service
leading up to a reunion of local SOAW people where
we'd all share discernment, pictures, thoughts, etc.
  One thing I must remark about. There were four
large pictures to my right leaned up against all
the stained glass windows. Front to back it went,
Denise, Cynthia, Carole, and Addie Mae. Along the
left it was Ita, Sr. Dorothy, Maura and Jean.
  Wow!
  OK, I knew most of this in my head all along, 
but seeing them all lined up like that hit me on 
many new levels all at once. Wow. Denise McNair,
Cynthia Wesley, Carole Robertson and Addie Mae
Collins were blown up in the 16th Street Baptist
church. Ita Ford, Sr. Dorothy Kazel, Sr. Maura 
Clarke and Jean Donovan were raped and murdered
in El Salvador.
  I wonder what differences there are between the
Klan and SOA graduates???


GROUND-HOGGISH DAY

7:44 am, 9jan03. Thursday.

My own personal "ground hog day"

Hooray!!! Spring is here.
  Sorta.
 
  This is that first day of the year waking me up
at 6, 7 or 8am where I DON'T try to, want to or 
insist upon going back to sleep until 8, 10 or 12.
  I could either jump right up or do my grampa's
old trick of staring straight away at the ceiling or
sky for 5 or 10 minutes preparing to start my day.
  I call this "Ground-Hoggish" day. This can hit
anywhere from January to May and I can guage my
entire upcoming year by it. 
  Yup, I'm going to have a splendid year, despite
you, George, OR YOUR FATHER H WALKER BUSH..

You and your damned fascism ring.

Date: Saturday, January 04, 2003 2:26 AM
From: T.M.Farnand 

I tried contacting the RIAA through its website 
("Why RIAA Keeps Getting Hacked," Jan. 3, 2002) 
to send this comment: "I hold a B.S. in Economics. 
After reading your many press releases about Internet 
piracy of music, I can't understand why the issue 
hasn't been put in perspective: Less than half of 
American households have Internet access, and less 
than 5 percent have broadband, which is the primary 
means of piracy. You are the little boy crying wolf."

Their website mail server failed to process the message, 
even when I risked sending it on Outlook Express. The 
truth is out there, but the RIAA can't handle it.

DEPART MENT: Store Blues

  (CON'T From 340)

  A story in three parts. 
1) ati 340
2) ati 341
3) ati 342

  "Let's try a 38 short, the man suggested. Polite I smiled  
and waited for the magic to happen. I never wore that suit 
to other proms, but it went with me to a quite a few of the
obligatory homecomings, and years later I used the vest in 
three different rock and roll bands as part of my "duds."
  I thought of all these things on my way home from Caldor 
that day. This story's been edited three times now. One 
publisher suggested I remove from here that I cried all
the way home from Caldors once more, but a more sublime
memorial kind of cry -- while pondering all these things.
It wasn't published with that change, and it was actually
published two other places, once without it, once with.
  I waited til now to recycle it into my weekly 'zine
because I wanted to wait and see if its part of the
"american dream" was really dead, and/or would remain
dead, and sure enough not only is it dead as a doornail
as we go into the worst last week of the year in three
decades, but it's kind of zombified like the walking dead.
  38short. I think I'm a 42reg and sometimes a 42short 
now. We get wider, not taller when we get old, don't we?
But I almost wouldn't know. The only reasons I'll wear 
blazers these days are when I'm playing classical guitar
and perhaps when I'm addressing a judge. Yeah, I put on
my best dumpster-dived suit, and let-me-tell-you, I've
got a few of them. Good lookers too. Amazing what you
find the day after Christmas, and the day after each
final exam, isn't it??? My favorite blazer these days
is actually a tux I bought for $15 at a St Vinneys.
  So as I write this new ending to this very old tale
of shame and degredation, greed and avarice, loathe
and graft, honest hard work, and getting almost nowhere, 
I ponder all these things minus the tears and begin to
think I'm just a little jaded. We all deserve this
economic down-tic don't we? Is this what we get for
building phases I and II at the end of the Clinton
Administration, and continuing on to phase II's and
III's ignoring all the indicators? Isn't this what we
get for letting both Gore AND Bush fool us into thinking
"Happy Days Are Here Again?" Aren't we clear on how
violent each of our comfort(s) at the expense of so 
many thousands of others' suffering(s)? 
  We're not?
  Uh oh.
  Maybe I SHOULD go into detailing my under-table 
Elks Club job when I was 15 afterall. Yeah, sure.
What have I got to lose except my ability to land 
a job at a place like ClearChannel, 3Com, Hooters,
Verio or one of the State Lotteries, right?
  So shortly after turning 15 I really wanted more
in life than what mowing lawns, and slinging papers
could get me. I was already doing both. Trust me,
those years, that just wasn't enough. A teenager
needs things... and lots of them. So my dad had a 
friend with an ever-renewable contract doing foods
at an Elks Club. Totally on the Hush-Hush. The QT.
Like Skull&Bones or something! I would be paid 
double the minimum wage, but cash, so it just may
have been the most I've ever made in my life until
5 or 6 years ago. At least the most per hour, right?
So I washed dishes, set tables, flirted with waitresses
who were much too old for me, and drank way too many
Long Island Ice Teas at the end of each shift, for
free.
  What did I learn there? Way too much. You learn
a lot in the world while cheating and letting others
cheat through you.

  (To Be CON'T In 342)



s.i.f.o.d.o.h.
  standing in front 
   of dahmer's old
    house \\\

Woah. Two things I've noticed shortly after
1jan. And maybe I think they're related. And 
both are to do with NYE. No, not the newyork
stockexchange. New Year's Eve.
  Lessee, how to articulate this. OK. First
thing I saw was an entire street with about
9 cars messed up. I'm talking -- they looked 
like a bulldozer slammed into each car at 
least 3 times to make sure they were totalled.
Yup. 9 cars in a row. All mooshed at least in
half. It was a horrible sight. Creepy in fact.
Visually violent right away. 
  What happened? I can only guess. Someone not
just very drunk, but very enraged. Not just
enraged, but very drunkenly enraged. Not just
drunkenly very enraged, but very drunkenly
enraged to the point of naked aggression. Not
just naked but unbridled, naked aggression. OK
I'm getting carried away here, but that should
illuminate the visual aspect of it. You sensed
right away this was some kind of killing floor,
not just a smashup by some drunk person at 4am.
This was an entire year's frustration taken out
on innocent bystanders. People who parked their
car on the proper side of the street.
  Now this was somewhat unrelated to Dahmer's old 
house, his old street. It was far away from there,
but \ the other side of town in fact \ but the
same town nonetheless. So there's where I start
thinking the next "sight" is related somehow.
  Dahmer's old house has curling ribbons all
over it. All around it. All over the place. Let's
see. First there's little dangly medallion type
ribbons every 5 or 6 feet hanging from the fencing
about eye level. Then there's streamers all over
the place inside. You can tell at least half a
dozen people jumped the fence and streamed this
stuff all over place. There's party hats, noise-
makers, etc., all over the plot of land. There
was obviously a party inside the fencing. 
  First sign of anyone having been inside I've
seen on any of my weekly visits to this place.
Hmmm. What happened here? Again, you can only
guess. There's where it's related. That's about
the only way it was related. Except that it can't
help but be some kind of violent energy no matter
how you witness it. No matter how you take it in.
There was violence here, you know it right away.
It's oozing out all over the place. In both these
places.
  In between these two "witnessings" I've seen
a couple other spots where 4 or 5 cars had been
done in that way the morning after NYE. (call it
new years day if you have to, but that loses the
impact. I stick with the "morning after NYE.)
  But they weren't nearly as evocative as the 
first one I saw. And then I reflect a little bit
about the two events, each in the context of the
other, if I may.
  Can you tell someone in Israel who just smashed
an entire street full of Palestinian cars, s/he's
wrong if you'd just done that new years eve in 
your hometown in the USA?
  And correlated: can a municipal government tell
one of its citizens s/he's wrong to smash up a 
street full of cars, if a huge portion of your 
tax dollars go toward egging on Israel to buy
International Harvesters or Caterpillars???
  So that's all I got this week for sitting (or
standing) in front of dahmer's house. Violence
is violence no matter where it shows up, and no
matter what day or night it's celebrated.

AIRPLAY 101
-----------------
By Bryan Farrish
[ref]=[http://www.radio-media.com]

Payola (part 2 of 5), Legal Definitions

Now let's cover what payola actually is and isn't.  
First of all, there is no such thing as "legal payola", 
just like there is no such thing as "legal theft".  
An activity is either illegal payola, or it is legal. 
The grand rule that governs the whole thing is section 
317 in the Code of Federal Regulations...

40 FCC 317 reads: "All matter broadcast by any radio 
station for which any money, service or other valuable 
consideration is directly or indirectly paid, or 
promised to or charged or accepted by, the station so 
broadcasting, from any person, shall, at the time the 
same is so broadcast, be announced as paid for or 
furnished, as the case may be, by such person: PROVIDED, 
that the 'service or other valuable consideration' shall 
NOT include any service or property furnished without 
charge or at a nominal charge FOR USE ON, or in connection 
with, a broadcast unless it is so furnished in consideration 
for an identification in a broadcast of any person, product, 
service, trademark, or brand name beyond an identification 
which is reasonably related to the use of such service or 
property on the broadcast." (emphasis added)

What this says is that if something of value (say, $500 
cash, or a DVD player, or 100 CDs) is given to a station 
with the UNDERSTANDING that a particular song must be played 
in order for the station to get the valuables, then this 
fact must be announced to the listeners.  If the announcement 
is made, everything is legal; if not, it is payola.  However, 
if something of value (say, $500 cash, or a DVD player, or 
100 CDs) is given to a station for the purpose of GIVING IT 
AWAY ON AIR during regular programming, then NO announcement 
is required, and the situation remains perfectly legal. 
(This is how game shows work.) 

Here are some FCC examples:

40 FCC 3.119 Example A-1 reads: "A record distributor 
furnishes copies of records to a broadcast station or 
a disc jockey for broadcast purpose [i.e., airplay].  
No announcement is required unless the supplier furnished 
more copies of a particular recording than are needed for 
broadcast [airplay] purposes.  Thus, should the record 
supplier furnish 50 or 100 copies of the same release,
with an AGREEMENT by the station, express or implied, 
that the record will be used on a broadcast [i.e., the 
song will get airplay], an announcement would be required 
because consideration BEYOND the matter used on the broadcast 
was received." (emphasis added).  This example points out the 
difference between giving a station something to keep, versus 
giving a station something to giveaway on-air; this is the 
thing that makes the difference.  

Here's more clarification:

Section C reads: "[No announcement is required] where 
service or property is furnished free FOR USE ON or in 
connection with a program, but where there is neither 
payment in consideration for broadcast exposure of the 
service or property, nor an agreement for identification 
of such service or property BEYOND ITS MERE USE ON THE 
PROGRAM" (emphasis added).  Thus, you can give a station 
whatever you want, as long as it is given away on-air, 
i.e., used on the regular programming.  

More:

Example C-10 reads: "Free books or theater tickets are 
furnished to a book or dramatic critic at a station.  
[All] the books or plays are reviewed on the air.  
No announcement is required."  

But:

Example B-7 reads: "A perfume manufacturer gives five 
dozen bottles to the producer of a giveaway show, SOME 
of which are to be identified and awarded to winners on 
the show, the remainder to be RETAINED by the producer.  
An announcement is required since those bottle of perfume 
retained by the producer constitute payment for the 
identification." (emphasis added). 

So, it should be clear that giving a station anything 
for giveaway on air is perfectly legal; giving a station 
anything that will NOT be given away on air (except of 
course your CD for airplay), if there is an understanding 
that you are doing it so they will play your stuff, is 
payola.  

Conclusion:  

Paying stations is not a tool for a small indie to get airplay.
