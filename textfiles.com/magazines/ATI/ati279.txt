So what's this about schoolgirls getting stoned?
Oh, and I suppose you've never smoked marijuana
in your whole life. Yeah, tell me another.

Hi, I'm prime anarchist and this is ATI zine
for Thursday 21 June. Last day of spring, first
day of Mars visible, it's 8:13am my time, and 
the eclipse is reaching totality in Zambia where
hippies and new-agers, aging baby-boomers, and
screaming agists are acting really stupid right
about now, I'm sure.
  Should I rant today, or write a traditional
column? Hmmm. Lemme think about that a little and
I'll get back to you on that. 
  How many schools around this country are named
after Nathan Hale? Does anyone out there realize
that the guy just HAPPENED to be on the winning
team? He was up to the same no good as old Benedict
Arnold. In fact, each of them was doing spookwork
for both sides. Just that at the very millisecond
that the "United States" won against Britain, 
Arnold was doing his paramilitary shit for her
majesty, while his second cousin less than twice
removed Old Nate was doing HIS deathsquad work for
the "colonies." 
  I guess when you're on the winning side, not only
do you get to write the history book, but the CIA
JustForKids webpages too, eh?
  That's all I got, save for a few bogus taglines
and footnotes and stuff.
  Later Days,

"Ask CNN" is brought to you by Akmakanoka 
Censoring the internet one "caller" at a time.

Go Billy Martin Go.
  Does DC police chief's assistant Terence Gainer look 
more and more like Chief Ramsey every day or what?
How come I only see Washington law enforcement on TV
during protests or when interns turn up missing?
  What goes ON in that stateless state, anyhow?

LETTUCE FROM OUR READERS

Say, 
I've been reading in Thoreau's _Journal - 1851_ and found
something:  {(he -Thoreau- had been holding forth in a rather
sentimental tone, typical, I think, of the times, then:}  
  We believe that the possibilities of the future far exceeds 
the accomplishment of the past.
  We review the past with commonsense-but we anticipate the 
future with transcendal senses.
  In our sanest moments we find ourself naturally expecting 
far greater changes than any which we have experienced within 
the period of distinct memory-only to be paralleled by experiences 
which are forgotten-
  Perchance there are revolutions which create an interval 
impassible to the memore."
  The interesting thing about this is that he said it in 1851!
  They didn't even have electricity then!  STEAM POWER was 
barely known! There was a railroad nearby.
  It went all of 40MPH.
  Sisyphus.

Dear Marco,
  We must speak with you. I don’t usually take
the time out to write a personal note, Marco,
but your name was provided by someone you had
recently spoken to. We believe your vibrations
to be so strong that I’ve endorsed a free
Tarot reading with one of our elite psychics!
It’s urgent, however, that you call immediately
I can only reserve this number for a limited time. 
Call now!
  Miss Cleo
  [uh, if your psychicness was as elite as you
   say it is, you would know that I don't want
   or need your Tarot readings.]

Uncle Kracker's "Follow Me" is nothing
more than a song about heroin, plain 
and simple. "Swim through your veins
like a fish in the sea"? What else could
that mean???

When C0INT3LPRO was first uncovered, the FBI and 
the US justice department claimed it was needed to
prevent violence and to defend the "national security"
against totalitarian subversion. Caught running 
similar operations in the 1980s they cited the threat
of "terrorism." We will see, however, that domestic
covert action does not protect against any of this.
It actually does the opposite. It subverts democracy
and promotes violence and terrorism.





  IT'S THE STUPID ECONOMY
  by Clark Transfer
  special to Prime Anarchist World News

TENNEFLY, NJ - (PAWN) What will become of Sam Walton's
old corporation, Dianetrics Industries?
  The company one year ago today opened a chain of pet
stores called WalRusMart. They're failing miserably,
but following in Sam's footsteps they're not letting 
lost billions stop them, or even the laughing people
do at their signs, so of course they won't close down
a single store.
  "We're going to use our foothold in every community
to our advantage," said Wall Street Journal retail
analyst Julia Faber, who spends all of her spare time
as a PR consultant for Sam Walton enterprises and
Dianetrics Industries, LLC. 
  She said adjoining each outlet will soon be a 
catalog showroom called eToys R Us. Like with all 
other monopolistic endeavors, Faber says she'll 
prefer to err on the side of optimism.
  "If we don't fail in eleven months," she said of
the newest chain upstart, "we'll succeed beyond our
wildest dreams."
  Plans are in the works for a joint operation chain
of music stores inside newly remodeled Kenny Rogers
restaurants, called Breast Buy, and a combination
hardware, heavy construction, and wholesale department
stores called Sams Tarpits.
  Ideas they didn't follow through on were a Pub with
dumpsters you can sleep in til you wake up called the
Guzzle 'N Nuzzle, an auto repair shop exclusively for
PT Cruiser limosines called "Long Body Shop," and a
new joint venture prefab prison construction facility
and social worker answering service called "Let The
Inmates Do the Talking."
  Faber says the upstarts are still in the works, just
that "the names need a complete overhaul."


  

  RANCH BOMBED BY BALSAMIC EXTREMISTS
    from combined theonion wires.

HIDDEN VALLEY - CA - (NOT PAWN) A radical balsamic 
fundamentalist group detonated an estimated 800
pounds of TNT at the Hidden Valley Ranch compound
Monday, killing 11 and injuring dozens more. 
  "Let no salad again be foully tainted by the
corrupt regime of Hidden Valley," said Martin
Pulaski, leader of the Nation of Balsam, in a
statement claiming responsibility for the deadly
attack. "We shall not rest until every salad's
flavor is enhanced by a light and tangy vinaigrette,
not buried in a shameful avalanche of buttermilk."

A SMART BOMB
 a poem by Brett Axel
 reprinted from "WWFP" Anthology Of Poetry

Wouldn't want to be dropped. Might get
Together with other smart bombs to discuss
Alternative employment possibilities like

Demolishing old buildings. Debate the virtues
Of restoration, at least taking them down
Carefully to salvage reusable materials.

Several could open doors for all bombs: start
A mentoring project in the armory: old cannon balls
With the latest hollow point bullets
Listening to speeches about social conscience.

Soon bombs are producing art and arguments
Born of a frustration at the lack of opportunity
For smart bombs to make meaningful contributions.

Can you see young people expressing their solidarity
With bombs by exploding themselves in cities and on
Military bases? Or a bomb specialist Joining The View. 

Tommy Hilfiger marketing a new line of
Expensive clip-on fuses for bomb wannabes who
Drink too much and go to lots of bad movies.

Before you know it, parents are giving warnings
To keep away from after hours munition clubs
Worried their babies might get rounded up
By the government and dropped on Kosovo.

We end this week with metaphors:


Can’t Stop Turning 
by stephan colman

   I planned an armed rebellion
   from bed last night 
   but the F.B.I. tapped my dreams
   They heard Wall Street scream

   took notes
   when I stole the crack
   from the liberty bell
   and used it to free Mumia from his cell.

   They followed my sentences
   when I said
   "chains link slaves and fences,"
   like the past leaks tenses.

   Before the past tense there was the pre tense.
   My dreams sensed past tension.
   I passed tension
   on the way to revelation.

   I turned Left.
   Nothing was Right.
   I got caught under the cover of night.
   And the bright light

   in my brain came
   from an interrogation lamp
   stamped "govt. property."
   They rode my mind’s waves for snapshots

   of C.I.A. crackplots,
   while crackpots planned
   jackpots in foreign lands
   from the sands of Iraq

   to the shores of Nicaragua,
   for agua and oil
   gold zinc and soil
   paybacks to fatcats by gatt-pacts

   for economic heirlooms
   while cops jacked Black Kids in backrooms....


   I thought Uprising
   but Dionne Warwick tipped off the D.E.A..
   They probed my nose
   for the welfare lines I sniffed
   found factory lines instead.
   Because only chimney’s smoke in my dreams.
   Only newt gingriches get smoked in my dreams. 

   I planned an armed rebellion from bed
   because I’m tired
   of counter revolutions-store-bought brand-name resistance.
   Cash can not register change,
   only people can.
   Because revolutions
   depend on the gravity of the polar axes
   we have to grind.
   It’s the never mind
   that can’t see the future.
   So now my dreams practice killing
   random acts of senseless silence
   because quite violence
   never met an empty space it did not like.
   And in my dreams I wake up
   and greet the Government Agents
   posted inn my head
   with a smile.
   I keep rising.
   keep rising
   to the bottom,
   because the top holds things down. 


   and the only sound
   You’ll hear from my sleep,
   the only movement
   I make in my sleep
   is Revolutions
   Turning Turning 
   Turning.



feedback?
