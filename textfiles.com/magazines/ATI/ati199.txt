12,000 people from all over the world converged on Fort Benning's
Columbus, GA gate protesting what they say is tax-supported 
training of central american death squads using techniques 
they do not approve of.
   Over 4,400 people risked arrest crossing onto the base
marching to the SOA where latin american "students" were
barricaded in lock-down by the base commander hoping to 
inhibit their awareness.

    NOT VERY CLOSE TO GROUNDHOG DAY

Did you see that full moon? Wow. Too bad it
didn't "fall" on ati day, eh?
I'm prime anarchist and here's my short little
column before a big old fat turkey of a 'zine.
Ack Tiv Imes. Issue 199. Brought to you by
Dr. Du-More's toothbrushes. New! Reduces the danger
of gingivitis, reduces plaque build-up. Du-More,
Inc. Rogers, Ark. 72757. We're not just for 
fornicating governors anymore.
  I just watched a DTV ad telling me I can pay
with VISA, MC OR Western Union. A 4-inch High-
Def TV screaming at me while I pump gas at a
Shell station. How stupid!
   Dear Hotel Guest,
Can you imagine how many tons of towels are 
unnecessarily washed every day in all the hotels all
over the world and the monstrous amount of washing
powder needed which thereby pollutes our water?
PLEASE DECIDE: Towels thrown into the bath or shower
means: PLEASE EXCHANGE. Towels replaced on the towel
rail means: I'LL USE IT AGAIN. 
   Thnx,
the Management.

LETTUCE FOR YOUR HEAD

I recently received an e-mail regarding my 
review at amazon.com from someone who said 
we seemed to think alike. The e-mail recommended 
a book packed with some of the most thought 
provoking concepts I have ever come across. 
I'm passing on the information with the hope 
that you receive some of the same enjoyment 
the book brought me.
The book is entitled An Encounter with a 
Prophet and is located at:

Dear ATI,
  Love the misprint on Bush.  
Something very funny(Ha-ha) about that.
  Do you REALLY THINK  they are going to 
close the SOA?  Yeah, like they shut off 
the contaminated wells outside Clark Air 
Force base in the Phillipines after they 
found out they were malforming the kids... 
and then turned them back on the day after 
some Phillipine senator came by to inspect.
  Watch out.  
  The CIA slush fund will keep that school 
going for years either under this name or another.
  Your sceptical pal in Boston.

given at a conference on global organized crime.
[ed note: glad to see we're globalizing something else besides
fecal choliform...]
"Just in case you think the FBI is not on the job, I have received 
a true intercept (and this is not made up...it is not Saturday Night 
Live) that the FBI made of itself while conducting an investigation 
in San Diego. It was sent to me by a friend of mine who used to be 
with counterintelligence in Washington. It is called "The FBI Pizza 
Call." FBI agents conducted a raid of a San Diego psychiatric hospital 
that was under investigation for medical insurance fraud. After hours 
of reviewing thousands of medical records, the dozens of agents worked 
up quite an appetite. The agent in charge of the investigation called 
a nearby pizza parlor to order a quick dinner for his colleagues. 
The following telephone conversation took place and was recorded by 
the FBI because they were taping the hospital." 

Agent: "Hello. I would like to order 19 large pizzas and 67 cans of soda."
Pizza Man: "And where would you like them delivered?"
Agent: "We're over at the psychiatric hospital."
Pizza Man: "To the psychiatric hospital?"
Agent: "That's right. I'm an FBI agent."
Pizza Man: "You're an FBI agent?"
Agent: "That's correct. Just about everybody here is."
Pizza Man: "And you're at the psychiatric hospital?"
Agent: "That's correct. And make sure you don't go through the front doors. 
We have them locked. You will have to go
around the back to the service entrance to deliver the pizzas."
Pizza Man: "And you say you're all FBI agents?"
Agent: "That's right. How soon can you have them here?"
Pizza Man: "And everyone at the psychiatric hospital is an FBI agent?"
Agent: "That's right. We've been here all day, and we're starving."
Pizza Man: "How are you going to pay for all of this?"
Agent: "I have my checkbook right here."
Pizza Man: "And you're all FBI agents?"
Agent: "That's right. Everyone here is an FBI agent. 
Can you remember to bring the pizzas and sodas to 
the service entrance in the rear? We have the 
front doors locked."
Pizza Man: "I don't think so."

   Did ANY Gannett-owned papers
cover the anti-SOA demonstration or
even reprint a tiny AP non-story blurb?
  I found 3 for 3 Gannett papers near me
who did NOT cover it at all, and none 
even reprinted the AP.
  I don't have the energy or resources
to go much deeper with this on my own,
so if any of our humble readers here, -
or those who get this forwarded - 
would have a Gannett paper near them,
would that they report to: 
ati@etext.org whether they did or
didn't? We'll publish the communal 
rezultz here in the next 'zine.
   It would be 21nov or 22nov unless
any of your "papes" happen to give 110%

PINOCHET-ISH NOTES TYPED IN BY "PAP."

"...meanwhile at home the drama continued." 
   --reprinted from "An Unfinished Song" 
     a book by Joan Jara
"CIA agents were said to be pouring into the
country. [Chile] A plot to assassinate Allende
was uncovered and the police seemed strangely 
slow to act aginst right-wing terrorists."
   --ibid
"Now the corporations began in earnest to plan
revenge and gave backing to the destabilization
plan already launched by the CIA and ITT. In Oct.
1972, the Kennecott Copper..."
   ""
"Little by little we edge forward until it is our
turn to pass the long platform where Allende is
sitting with all the leaders of Popular Unity...they
must have been here for hours already...he looks tired...
  One by one we recognise and salute them, although we
notice that the new Commanders-in-Chief of the Armed
Forces, Merino, Leigh and Pinochet, are not among them.
Everyone is shouting 'Allende, Allende, el pueblo te
defiende!' and 'El pueblo unido jamas sera vencido!'"
   ""  p. 229
"...military orders announcing that Allende had been
given an ultimatum to surrender by the commanders of
the Armed Forces led by General Augusto Pinochet...
that unless he surrendered by midday the Moneda Palace
would be bombed."   --ibid. p. 235
[ed note: I took this book out to prepare my Victor
Jara tribute song "Venceremos." I got it on interlibrary
loan which took me much longer this time than the first
couple times I read this book. I'm typing these notes
in before returning it, fearing it's the last time
I'm going to be able to get a copy of this book...
Can someone scan it in quick?]

SIXTH WAFFLE HOUSE FROM THE SOA
Gonzo Journalism From the Anarchist

Memphis and Birmingham feel a million miles away.
   Gandhi, MLK, Jello Biafra, and Bill Hicks seem like a failure.
I fear life itself at times. I fear my fellow man. I doubt my own
god sometimes. I question karma.
   I have been over that mountain numerous times now, I have seen
it all and I'm just 35 yet I feel like a tired old spirit right
now. A walking dead zombie something worse than "Jacob's Ladder."
   My life is something X-Files is afraid to touch.
   I have climbed up to that beautiful top and I have to say the
next road is paved with the bones of your ancestors, your children
and yourselves.
   Death, carnage, and Amway representatives.
   Used car salesmen disguised as televangelists, televangelists
disguised as used car salesmen - and used car televangelists 
disguised as themselves.
   The road to hell is paved with you and me, my friends. 
You and me. Beware false profits.
   We are not doomed, we are worse than doomed. We are the new dead.
We have been sleeping like lying dogs for decades now. We are puppets
on dental floss acting out the StarWars freakshow-"truckstop"-bar-room-
forced-relaxation scene.
   We are the new dead and they have called us to dance. 
12,000 of us took over a city last weekend. 
Many people thanked us.
   Some are wearing wanted posters on their T-Shirts 
with our pictures on them. Who will tell the people? 
There are no Dostoyevskys, no George Orwells, just people 
telling each other something's horribly foul but 
we just don't know exactly what.

       West Wing Every Wednesday?

  We know what, per se, but we just can't quite 
assemble it into reason, analysis, news or
disseminatable truth.
  There appears to be no balance, just emotion, gut 
feeling -- like the Woodstein and Bernward days. 
There are no Orwells, no Hemmingways, just you 
and me discussing trauma, tragedy, truth-in-
advertising and the multi-level network 
marketing of Jesus.

And now for our climactic ending. A poem.
Poem For Ingrid
by Marco Capelli Frucht

I'm gonna get faceless for a second

I didn't know someone named Ingrid
I knew who she was
I didn't know I had
Hundreds of friends who all knew her
She died last February sometime
She was killed in Columbia
She's an American
She's a Menominee
And she's from Northern Wisconsin
And she grew up in New York

She died with two other people
In Columbia

They dragged her body to Venezuela
And tried to show that it must be
Some leftist guerrillas that killed these
Three outside agitators
Who carried no weapons
And bring milk to little children
Once a day

Ingrid was killed and that is
Falling apart now as it's being
Proven

That paramilitaries killed her
And now I feel very faceless
Because I knew lots of people who knew her

On my way to Washington DC yesterday
I was greeted by her first cousin
Who made this art
As her grieving process the last two months

Because she lost a woman that she loved very much
Who was killed in Columbia and I am guilty

BECAUSE I PAID MY TAXES
HERE IN THE UNITED STATES
AND WE SUPPORT THE SCHOOL OF AMERICAS
And they like to train death squads
And they're going to kill all of you
And they're going to kill me for saying it

Unless we do something about it.

    ----====----

This is a poem I wrote and read in DC last
may during anti SOA demonstrations.
It was in a Unitarian Church and the crowd was
huge because we were basically putting on this
show for people who couldn't afford the 35$
to see Pete Seeger, Odetta and Amy Ray that
nite. Their show was a good cause, as half
the money went to the SOA protest and half
went to Nevada Desert Experience but we were
aware that many of us wouldn't be able to afford
that. I'd raised the 35 dollars and kept it
seperate when I went to that, so that I could
go, but when I was asked to be one of the
performers at the other event, I'm sure you
know how easy it was for me to decide where
to go...
  At any rate, I had Ingrid's cousin's artwork
in front of me, taller than me, and between
me and the microphone. (I was a little worried
I might muffle words but learned later it was fine)
I read that way up to the point of "I am guilty"
where I put the allcaps. What I did was drop the
banner to my feet. And point with my whole hand
rather than a finger when I said they're
"going to kill you."
  Many people said afterwards that I scared
the hell out of them. And one person told
me he thought I was pointing directly at him.
He wasn't in the middle either. What I did was
move my open hand just a little bit in a big
circle so it included everyone, and my eyes scanned
the whole room a couple times in those seconds.
  I remember praying afterwards that creator
never let me use that power for hitleresque
things because I felt that rush, and shook
literally for minutes afterwards. I wonder
how many people catch that power in their life
and DON'T pray or find some other way to process
it? Just knowing how many must be out there scares
the hell out of ME.
  I know exactly what Jim Morrison of the Doors was
talking about, and I thank god at least a couple
times a day I'm not an alcoholic over just that
one issue!

Love,
marco
