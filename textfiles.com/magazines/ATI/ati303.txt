Greetings, it's ATI issue 303. How are you?
I'm fine. What's new? Taliban fighting 
forces have surrendered some of them,
many others have taken off, headed
for the hills with their weapons.
  Yikes.
  That means an awful lot of
new paramilitaries will be
thinking they're really
elite enough to send
in an application
to the School of
Americas, huh? 

Oh yeah, I'm 
prime anarchist, 
how's it going? Yeah, 
I know, I already asked 
you that. But really. How 
ARE you doing?
  I'm pretty good and well, 
surprised at that. I don't expect 
to be doing good/well, feeling good/well, 
and well, you know, nobody on this earth seems 
to be expecting me to be acting well or good. Well 
that's all well and good, but why am I so good? Fate??

LETTUCE SO YOU WON'T 4 GETTUCE

Dear ATI,

Just think.  If George Bush has his way, you'll be dragged off to a secret
military tribunal by this time next year, tried and sequestered for life
for your libelous and seditious acts.  Your friends will be harrassed, your
property stolen by the government, your family in ruins...

I of course will stand quietly by until they also drag me off for sending
this letter to you.

Can anyone say "1964 in South Africa"???

The more things change they more they remain the same.  Of that's only my
opinion.

Dear friends,
  Howdy from the road
  ..wanna let you know we got a hot Sunday coming your way this week 
with the likes of Paul Suntup, Jenny Bate and all the way from Tampa, 
Florida formerly from la la land, Leslie Maryann Neal. That and the 
usual crew of word wielding poets should brighten a Sunday evening 
for everyone. Check out the bios below. I will be updating the web 
site as soon as I get back in town.
  Last Sunday, Frankie Drayus and Neil Aitken brought the house 
down in an amazing poetic duo. We had an exciting open mic with 
newcomer Eva Sippel starting things off, Keith Myers was also in 
the house and he got things rocking, while Wayman LitRave Barnes 
juiced the cosmos with an hysterical reading especially a rather 
daring imitation of feature Frankie.
Much love,
Larry





And a stray "#'s"  to mix it up a bit:

http://homepage.mac.com/alcrespo/PhotoAlbum6.html


to ati@etext.org
She was not a marcher, but she was one of us.
  Many of us were arrested with her or touched by her in some way. 
  Barbara Wiedner, the founder and leader of Grandmothers for Peace 
International died late Sunday night after a 3 month battle with 
pancreatic cancer.  Funeral services will be held on Friday at 11 
am at the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament in Sacramento, CA. 
Barbara was an amazing woman who abandoned her traditional homemaker 
lifestyle late in life to fight the global scourge of nuclear weapons.  
Grandmothers for Peace was born in the early 80's when Barbara's 
granddaughter made her a sign to hold up at a peace rally that said 
"Grandmother for Peace."  She took the group from a small band of 
women in Sacramento to an international organization with chapters, 
official and unofficial, all over the world.  She was a friend to 
Mikhail Gorbachev and other world leaders.  Today my heart is heavy 
with the loss of Barbara but I am heartened to know that she lives 
on forever in the greatest legacy imaginable...fewer nuclear weapons 
and peace in places where there once was none. 
  It was Barbara's hand I was holding the first time ever that I was 
arrested in an act of civil disobedience.  It was one of many times.
  Thank you Barbara.
  You were an inspiration to me. 
Namaste, 
Tracey Brown

Hi Marco

We have been informed by KODA,the danish department of NCB, 
which administrats composerrights and so on - that your songs 
are restricted and  may not be used without accept from and 
payment to NCB/KODA!

Is this correct?

Hi Michael,
Great to hear from you.
 But this is not good news. I think I'm angry but
maybe hurt. I'll have to look into this. They can't
tell you this.
 Could forward the notice they sent you if you still
have it? We may have to find out if there's attorneys
who can help us.
 I wish with all my heart for you to have them free,
(NO CHARGE TO ANYONE. Not you, not me, not someone hitting
your pages.) They can't circumvent that, it's not fair.
 I will fight this if I can. Maybe they will try to
make it so that my songs cannot leave my own country
or something? I don't understand who they are yet, or
exactly what they've tried to restrict. So I'll have to
look it up more.
 But please know that I want you to keep them for free,
and they are free for anyone who wants to have them or
share them. Why else would I pick "folk" genre to live
in the rest of my life?
 Even if this becomes a huge battle, I think I will win
because I'm doing all the right things for all the right
reasons. I know it in my heart.

peace,
marco

ps
I'm in Sheboygan instead of home right now so tomorrow
I'll start looking it all up. Do you know if they've
done that with David Rovics or anyone too?

Hi Marco

Thanks for the swift reply:)

Those bastards from KODA have been on our back for some time now - and
it seems like they're lying - more or less on purpose.
We had to close down the front pages of the MP3site in order to prevent
being prosecuted - now we're working to get it back up....

The mail from KODA (Joern Gullach - jorn.gullach@koda.dk ) in Denmark is
below, here's the part that mentions you - in a pour translation:

"After a preview of the list I'm able to say, that Erik Clausen, Krist
Novoselic, Jello Biafra, Michael Franti, Allan Rørsanger, Grup Yorum,
Hugh Blumenfield, Søren Sidevind, Marco Capelli, Billy Bragg, Bl!nk,
Bleeder and velour are members of KODA or one of KODA's partner
organizations, meaning the music is part of KODA's repertoire.
Use of these numbers therefore demand permission from and payment to
KODA."

KODA in Denmark has agreements with the "music-rights organizations" in
almost all other countries - to check the organizations in US:
http://www.cisac.org/cisac/webcontent.nsf/homepage left menu, select
directory and USA.
They're saying that you're a member of a similar organization in US and
therefore all your music is restricted - and you cannot give it away for
free - they have to be paid.

I've had contact with a Danish musician "Alan Roersanger" today, who
claims that he's got no agreement with KODA - but he's also mention in
the mail...

I'v talked to David about it, when he toured Denmark. He said that he'd
never restricted any of his music or were member of that kind of
organization - except the the traveling musicians union.  But KODA
didn't mention him in the mails - but they always saying that almost
100% of all music is restricted.

Well... nice to hear from you - despite the occasion ;)
The rules and regulations does not seem to be in our favor, so I'm not
really sure if we're preparing to go to court and raise a campaign
against KODA/musicrights or we're on the lookout for a server in a
remote country, where KODA has no say.

All the best
Michael


"In 2000, we finally succeeded in obtaining a tariff approval 
and in collecting 1.7 mill. DKK for the use of music for aerobic, 
dance and exercise in commercial exercise centres. Unfortunately, 
KODA had to go via the bailiff's court that issued an injunction 
against two of the largest aerobic chains of the country."

http://www.koda.dk/usr/koda/kodaweb.nsf/default?OpenForm&URL=sider/home_english


"KODA wishes to a still higher degree to take into account the 
intentions of the legislation on concert halls - an equality of 
the rhythmic music with any other serious art forms and a coherent 
solution for the whole professional music environment including 
the first link of the music food chain - the composers and songwriters.

The other day I watched a few... - thirty seconds of daytime soap.
Thought for sure I saw Denny Tario. Or no, what's that guy from
CHIPS? Yeah. What's his name. Him. The guy with the perfect black
and grey hair. \\\ Brought to you by...
  ...the models busting their hump for Stay Free Ultras and Maxis.
Winona to Jenna to Tori, everyone's gotta hawk the Tampax and the
Kotex. Then and only then, can they try their hand at casting calls.
I don't think there's an equivalent set of hoops to jump through
really. 
  Next subject? OK. I'm a little frustrated tonite. I went on a 
cyberjourney. I had a working calder linux install in my p75 machine,
and I had win95 in a p120 with bigger drive and etc. same 64 in RAM.
The really expensive 72pin slotted stuff. yup. ran me about 20$ each
but I can see the little stickers saying $100 on them. Yikes.
So this is my 4th try in a row installing on the newer machine. If
this one doesn't work, I'll call it a night because I still have to
boot up win95 on the older machine and let windows go through that
massive amounts of "new hardware found, press OK to search for 
drivers..."
  OK, back to the music and the drama.
  It's the hipper "Much Music." Stay with us, we'll train you to
consume, consume and consume. And unless some downer dweeb points 
it out you won't even notice it.
  Neutragena, oil-free sense and sensibility wash.
  So, what's with the BlackBloc icons VH-1 was using along with
their music awards Sunday night??? Brilliant, hip and with it
creepy think-tank people, if you ask me. Frightening.
  So we go right from VH-1 to the Billboard Music Awards at the 
MGM GrandMarquee. Incubus - 5 white males each with different
hairstyles expending a ton of time and energy talking about how
diverse their music is, how they come from such diverse backgrounds
-- which all goes into the overall diversity of the band, [ummm...]
  Don't forget, this year is held in Vegas -- Vegas is definitely
a whiteman'sworld. A woman has a certain slot in Vegas, as does a
black man or woman. And an Indian? Wow. Should I even go there??
  And speaking of NDN -- Wayne Newton. Wayne's brother. Wayne's
nephew, Wayne's other nephew, oh and Wayne's nephew's nephews.
"Mandy Moore, it's always a pleasure to," yeah, back off Wayne. 
Touch one more little girl's ass and I'm gonna tell them all where
you keep your bottle of Viagra.
  --Listerine pocketpacks. Kill the germistans, kill the germistans.
(What serious song is "Kill the Walrus?" No you know, not Ride of the
Valkyries but that one that has the same feel but in a different key.)
  So does Wayne Newton use more makeup than Tammy Faye and Jimmy Bakker
combined or what?
  That's a close call, eh?
  So is Wayne's nephew going to marry Joan Rivers' daughter after a
second baby or before one, or what? And R Kelly - 5 girls screaming
for you. Or was that 4? Not the "tall cotton" this year, eh? None of
us really.
  "I'm tryin' to make more money so my kids can eat."
  Umm, someone remind him you can't consume clothing and limo rides,
would ya?
  MSN is the great alternative to AOL. Umm. Don't get me started.

ATI - We watch an hour or two of TV so you don't have to.

What is helping Afrika really about, can someone tell me? It can't
be solely about easing suffering, or curing AIDS, forgiving the debt?
Not really.
  It's about diamonds, isn't it? It's about Ingrid, isn't it? Pick
an Ingrid. Old or new. Same idea, different time zone. Different
decade really.

   So I'm prime, and you're not.

Here's a test of caldera's basic text editor.

If I can get it to save to floppy properly

I'll move it over to the winDOZE box and

paste it into ati303. Babysteps, but "now

we're getting somewhere."

  :)


(one more test. does this work with user

and root? Or only root.)
  [Managed to do both] -

  OK, so it acts like the old radio shack laptop I used to try
using with the 8bit ataris for the bbs, huh? So that's alright.
Getting the floppy shared from root to the users and etc., may
not sound like much but it was a pretty big step. Well, mostly
just because I'm semi-incompetent right?
  OK, there's about 5 other editors that come with this software
"bundled" (all open source) and I think there's a big pile more
that you can install from other ROMs.
  So I'm sure one of them will be compatible with the rest of
our little Gates-Dominated world, eh?

OK, you ready for this? I wrote that one. 
The one that follows was anonymously posted
at one of the indymedias. It is far superior
to my parody. So I give you, "He's Beginning
to Look a Lot Like Hitler."


Hes beginning to look a lot like Hitler, 
Prisners he regrets;
That rule doesnt apply to us, 
so what is all this fuss?
If we tried them what if one was innocent?

Hes beginning to look a lot like Hitler, 
Exploits us with our fears;
The Taliban are ten feet tall, 
dont want to meet one in the hall,
Or hell have your ears.


Finding Iraq in cahoots and Somolia to boot 
is the wish of Connie and Paul;
Girls in tube tops Giving the finger to cops 
is the hope of Laura the doll;
And Donald R can hardly wait for 
bombs again to fall.


Hes beginning to look a lot like Hitler, 
Arabs are his Jews;
Starving Afghans will have to wait, 
Bush has got too much upon his plate;
What they lack in food we make up with our views.

Hes beginning to look a lot like Hitler, 
Constitution now is gone;
Will Americans brave the tanks, 
while his cronies rob the banks?
Watch next week, - Evryone!


Wehlll, we have outlawed    yyy- you!

The bombing begins in just fiiiiiiiiiiiiive
kwaanzaas,
ramadans,
channuukas.
er  wwwwwwwwwwwwaaaaaaddeva they call those 
fancy things over there.


Nah, I'll end with a poem rather
than a parody. This one's by
