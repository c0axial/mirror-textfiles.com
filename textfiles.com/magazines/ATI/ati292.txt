  Trust me on this one.  It is goofy.
  Stop and pick up your telephone to try this. 
  It only takes 20 seconds, and no matter how 
  bad a day you may be having, if nothing else, 
  it will make you  smile and momentarily 
  forget what's going on.
  1. Call Deutsche Bank/National Discount
  Brokers at 1-800-888-3999.
  2. Listen to ALL of the options 
  (only takes a moment, I promise!)
  3. After hearing the 7th option, press 7 
  and listen.
  Every company should have an Option 7.

World Trade Center's two towers are in flames.
They were each hit by what appears to be commercial
airliners.
  Most corporate media is crippled because their towers
are at the top.
  AP only has one line about the story so far.
  I think we should put up a line or two on our center
page and then take it down in a day or so.
  What's anyone else think?

no shit, roger.
I spent a day and a half trying to confirm that when I read
it Wednesday night.
  It's really hard to keep calling Bin Laden a terrorist as commander
in chief without wanting to ask rhetorically if Bush, Powell or Cheney
are equally terrorists, or are they completely exempt because they're
"commanders in chief" of THE country whereas all the rest are just
CIF's of some other counrties???

PRESS RELEASE PARTS

--------------------------------------------------
3. Legislative Update
   from SOAWatch

Good news!
   We have 80 co-sponsors to HR 1810, the bill to close the
SOA/WHISC.  The SOA Watch legislative committee has set a goal 
for 100 co-sponsors by the end of the year, and we are almost 
there!  Please keep up the pressure.  Contact your member of 
congress now!  You can find a list of co-sponsors and a sample 
letter on our web page.  We are working with members of the 
Senate to shape an effective strategy in that chamber.
   Check our web page for developments.
   Soldiers from Colombia continue to be trained at SOA/WHISC, 
and human rights abuses continue to occur daily in Colombia.  
Millions of our tax dollars support the Colombian army’s effort 
to repress the people and violate their rights.  Our senators 
can change that. Next week, the Senate will take up the foreign 
aid appropriations bill, the annual budget bill which includes 
the funding for Colombia and the Andean region.  Call your 
senator now and urge him/her to speak out about the violence 
in Colombia and to support amendments to cut aid to the 
Colombian military.

AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

OR NOT.

OR MAYBE.

Today's Prime Anarchist Column Gets Taken Over 
By Marco. Well, just for today, right?


New York City Rickshaw Walla, get outa your cab.
  I mean it. Check this out. Get out of your
cab. Or at least a couple hours a day, leave it 
behind and buy yourself one of those bicycle 
rickshaws. Start humping people around the old
fashioned way.
  You have an opportunity to radically change
Amerikan capitalism for the good, for the first
time since even as far back as the first push-cart
days. 
  Think about it. The tips you'll take in will be
yours and yours alone. At least for the first few
months. And the controlls that will be set on it
will have to built one by one over time, while 
you'll have the same amount of time to organize
yourselves and others around making the changes
happen fairly and slowly. And you'll STILL be 
your own boss. 
  Giuliani will NOT be able to criminalize you.
His boyfriend George "W" Bush has courted him about
being kind to people providing a service. He won't
go against that at least until past election day.
And by then it'll be too late.
  You will have radically changed Amerikan capitalism
for the good, yes! For the first time since way back
in the push-cart days. Giuliani will have to notice
you, and give you credit for all the work you're 
doing. Maybe while all this patriotic ferver is
raging, you can say everything to and from lower
manhattan is free or something. You'll probably get
awarded Nobel Prizes or something in front of every
rock star and political idiot at a hundred dollar a
plate dinner, because all Giuliani cares about this
second is pulling off winning the mayorship one
extra time past term-limits.
  For you see, he also has a chance to radically
change politics for the first time, no wait. For the
second time. Since George "W" Bush "won" the US
pResidency on the backs of the Amerikan Citizens'
distractedness.
  Trust me, and at least think about this. I think
you have a great opportunity to work your ass off,
hump a bunch of people on your own back practically
with your own resources for tips or for cheap, without
almost any controls at first, and make your gross
the same as your net for a very long time before
the city toughens up and tries to control you. You
will by then have established something once again
that USED to exist in Amerika. The real Amerikan
dream. Where did it go?
  I'll tell you where it went. Deep underneath
fascism, city, county and state corruption, greed
and Greenspan Economofuckinics. It's still there but
you have to fight for it. You have to scratch the 
earth and dig underneath for it. Grassroots. Look at
your feet. Think about them. Contemplate kicking 
corporate ass. Do it. Don't be shy. Get out there
and be creative. Don't just tie a yellow ribbon
around your old oak tree. Don't just red white and
blue your baby so true. Make it green. Make the
whole friggin city green. Lots is happening all
over this country. Not just in NYC either. Green
mother earth is waking up I think. 
  A full week without crop dusters? Holy shit. 
Mother Earth coughed five times. But she noticed
her breath at the same time. She said, holy wah!!!
I'm alive. They didn't kill me completely. She's 
ready to kick our ass. Check it out. Soon come
rumblings of a different kind. Only the creative
will survive it. Yup. Only the creative. She's 
looking to spare a "few good citizens."
  So scratch the earth and dig underneath for it. 
Grassroots. Look at your feet. Think about them. 
Contemplate kicking capitalist ass. Do it.
  Are you the best cook in this town? Donate your
services one day a week. All of them. And DON'T
try to get money back on your taxes next year. You're
saving lives. People will reward you for just THAT
selfless act in ways you'll not begin to imagine 
even if I tried to show you this moment. Do it. Roll
your sleeves up. Feed someone for free.
  Do you work in a hospital? Go volunteer for someone
besides the Red Cross or Elizabeth Dole. They don't
need your money, they steal enough of their own from
the young and the old. Go find a shelter that can't
afford healthcare for ANY of its people. Or that has
nothing more than a once-a-week clinic written on a
"point five" job where about 30 of the 52 weeks a 
year there's one cancellation after another. Get in
there and volunteer one day a week for preventative
case-work, free. You'll have doubled their cause without
spending a single dollar of anyone else's money OR 
yours. Just your time.
  Take your time, and give some of it away.
  You won't be disappointed. That's the real patriotism,
that's the real Amerikan dream. That's the real way to
go about it. Not this false shadow idol worship shit.
I went to bed last night wrestling with this whole
Amerikan false idol shit, and how this all could have
happened and where we can go from here, INSTEAD of the
path we seem to be taking this second. Because you KNOW
it's a slippery slope. 
  Our economy's down the toilet. It was down the toilet
well before 3 of 4 planes hit our holiest of holy shrines.
The kind of capitalism we know in Amerika today has died
a painful, fire and water death as we know it. And the 
rest is just follow through. 
  Rebuild from the ashes.
  So I write you this "cyber-pamphlet" hoping to inspire
you no matter where your own walk of life takes you. Do
something with it. Copy it and pass it along, change it,
write your own, read it to the person next to you, saying,
"wanna hear the most wack thing you've ever heard? Check
this out..."
  But do something. Something else besides what every
single other person who looks exactly like you is doing
this very moment. Stop mourning and "save" people. Put a
smile on your face and do something different with yourself
for the first time since before you economically enslaved
yourself way back as far as you can remember. 
  Take back your life. It is more revolutionary than
anything else you can do in the next two or three milleniums.
Trust me. No matter who your are, no matter what you're
doing right now. Think this all the way through and hammer
it out with other people in some stupid think-tank. You,
and not you alone, you and everyone who thinks just a little
bit like you, and everyone who thinks completely different.
You all have a chance, we all have a chance right now. We
all have our first chance in a long time to kick some 
serious Allen Greenspan ass. And that "liberal wife" of
hers. 
  AND RADICALLY CHANCE NEO-CAPITALISM FOR THE GOOD FOR THE
FIRST TIME IN WORLD HISTORY SINCE SOMEONE LAY DOWN A BLANKET
ON THE GROUND AND SAID "THAT ONE'S A DOLLAR, OR WHATEVER YOU
CAN AFFORD."

Anti-war Manhattan Kabul

   a poem by Sue

A man going to war
is doing something he hoped never
to do
a man going to war
is losing things he hoped always
to love
a man going to war
is moving against the life
he wants
war on hope
war on love
war on will
nothing left but
kill
kill
to protect what we love
we have to kill,
we have to die?
all missions
on that premise
are suicidal
To go to war
we overcome instincts so profound
we overcome all
but war
and war
overcomes all
I did not carry
my sons for this
Women at war
bare their breasts in the Holy Land
equal and free
to offend Islam
and defend liberty
and sisterhood
Covered faces
Screened eyes
Robed bodies
Shock western values
What we know
is all we know.
We don't know
what we don't know.
We know we wanted homes
laughter children work health
golden lampglow
warming evening.
The dead are entombed in Manhattan;
The living in Kabul dig in underground
or flee;
robed figures on handcarts pushed where?
Where is home?
Usama Bin Laden named now
blamed now
hunted now;
"You are with me
or with terrorism"
immature schoolyard logic passes for diplomacy
four and a half acres of gunboat diplomacy floats
when war comes to town;
Downtown;
Manhattan grieves for reprisal and closure:
My analyst told me the stages of grief
there are four :
Denial, a river in Egypt.
Anger, an army at war
Loss, a night without day
Acceptance, cessation.
Denial cannot anger block
Anger cannot cancel loss
Loss never goes away
There is no night without day
There is loss and there is life
Covert ops and bombs
Missiles in droves
Soldiers
Poppies in Normandy.
What did you do with your life?
I invented a new type of war.
It's not new.
It's old.
Old Testament
Wild West
Schoolyard logic
and wrong,
it's all wrong.
Come back
Come home
Grieve
Wait out the anger.
