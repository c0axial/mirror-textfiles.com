AND NOW A WORD FROM THE ATI PUBLISHER

Ugh!
  
  OK, that was two words, sorry. All Right.
I turn this column over to my close friend
Cygnus (860) who has a few good words for you
all:

Dear Sirs,
Do you ever get replies to your bulk 
emailing that could be considered emotionally 
damaging? If so I have written a program 
that filters out phrases such as "Spam Spewing 
Simpletons" or "Leave me alone you Bastards"
from incoming emails, leaving you undisturbed 
with the untold countless millions that await 
you in your new found effort to get rich without 
ever really producing a product or indeed a 
service that is worth anything.
   I have even made the filter's sensitivity 
level adjustable so that you can set the 
automatic deletion function to activate at 
the familiar phrase "Fuck You" at minimum 
to "I didn't request any of this information", 
or "Unsubscribe" at maximum.
   Obviously you are not someone who is 
interested in such intangibles as demographics 
or anything as complicated as market research. 
You believe that everyone should be interested 
in your new found way of buying houses using 
only used popsicle sticks and husks of Spanish 
onions. I applaud you for your deep under
standing of human nature that everyone wants 
to know these things and will send you $19.95 
to reward you for your philanthropic endeavors. 
And there is no reason why you should have to 
put up with the few ingrates that wish to 
vocalize their misguided frustration by sending
negatively charged email to you , directly 
interfering with your ability to enjoy making 
the untold millions that await you.
   My simple program SCUMRID costs a mere 
$35.00, takes up a mere 50k of disk space, 
and takes seconds to install and works FAST. 
Some even say its over efficient, increasing 
system performance in areas they didn't expect. 
Many companies insist that after using my 
program they found they had increased the 
amount of free hard drive space to a level 
they had enjoyed before they installed their 
bulk emailing program and in some case their 
ENTIRE OPERATING SYSTEM!!!

I've just recieved a disturbing phone 
call from a couple of long time on
the land supporters at Big Mntn.  
Today (Feb 2, '99) the livestock
confiscations may have started in earnest, 
or at the very least they are surveying 
the areas they intend to hit soon.  
There were aparently several confiscation 
crews on the land around what we call 
"Down town Big Mntn" or the area around 
Anna Mae camp.  That's realy all i know 
but it disturbs me enuf to send out this 
posting.  The supporters have asked me 
to send out a request for immeadiate 
supporter presence on the land.  Any who 
can get out there in the next day or two 
are asked to do so.  This is at the 
very least a harrasment and threat of 
confiscation to mess with the elders heads.  
The relocation folks are growing desperate 
to get the last resisters off the land 
before the UN can act.

USPS ANNOUNCES "THIRD PENNY" INCREASE.
<PAWN>-Washington, DC
Unveiling a stamp series devoted to the
Longplaying album (the LP) the United
States Postal Service will be increasing
price April 1, 1999 by 1/3 of a penny
to make the cost of delivering a first
class letter thirty three and one third
cents.
  General Inspector, Sidney Bloomingthal
said the stamps will be really neat.
  "Buddy Holly, Elvis, Marco Capelli,
the Beatles, Little Eva, Harry Fox,
Phil Spector, they're all gonna be on
there," said Bloomingthal at a press
conference yesterday at the Rose Garden.
  He said each stamp will honor someone
who's put out an album. If they don't have
an LP, they won't be on a stamp. That got
around regulations for only honoring dead 
people. Each person's face will be 
emblazoned inside an album. Artists are
being hired from a field of poppies as
we go to press.
  Bloomingthal called for a 24-hour 
moment of silent speculation as to what
other musicians will be honored on the 
33 1/3 cent stamp this April. Rumors are
that Michael B. Williams, Getty "John Paul"
Lee, and KISS will all make an appearance.

   "I'm praying about this [Clinton's peaches
of important articles] and I don't mean that
figuratively, this is a serious matter."

    --Senator Byrd, Politicial, Propagandist,

OPEN LETTER TO SOMETIME SENATOR ROBERT BYRD
   When have you been figurative about praying??
   I REALLY want to know this.
   Tipping your hand, you give me need now to
ask every human who calls the self a Christian
how figuratively they be.

   Do you swear to schpiel the truth, the ruthless
truth, and nothing but the soothsaying sleuthtruth
so help you fig leaf?

   Spring is here, can you hear it?
   Birds. You've been right since 5 or 6 years old.
Don't let them beat it out of you. Or you've got 
"uphill," getting it back the rest of your life!

   While we allow our "clergy" to preach hate, 
what are we doing to God's children all over 
the world???

Do you recognise all the songs you hear
Are the melodies slow to leave your ear
Well I could say the same
Of course I heard them first
They came to me in dreams
Then people stole my work

I'm a ghostwriter
Oh
I'm a ghostwriter
Oh

Did you really believe those clowns compose
Haven't you noticed 
      the playback at their shows
Well they don't want you to hear 
              how they really sound
And they don't want me to be 
                      anywhere around

'Cause I'm their ghostwriter
Oh
I'm a ghostwriter
Oh

Give a little bit of bass
Watch the seventh and the flat
Keep the cello where it's at
No vibrato on the eighth
Have the girls sing in thirds
Have the flautists play like birds.

Now they've hypnotised millions 
                   with their licks
Using all of the high-tech studio tricks
And starving chaps like me
            live in obscurity
While so-called "super-stars"
         fill the phoney charts

I'm a ghostwriter
Oh
I'm a ghost-writer
Oh

Watch the level on the verse
Catch the echo
Change the snare
Put some reverb back in there

Try to punch in if you can
Got to tune before you pan

Load the samples in the box
Try compressing at the gate
Bounce the tracks
It's getting late

Find the humming in the mix
Get the chips off of the board
Now the decibles have soared

Make it analog to DAT
Leave the digital alone
The union freaks are going home

Rapsong In Blue
by Tophat Girthman (212)

Cause a this sound
I got a feelin it'll scream
Up the charts.
This my pseudo
Intellectual alternative song
About Pop Tarts.

Here is a sound 
And I think it'll work.
20 years a music knowlege
For this song, I just shirk.

Everything sucks, everything sucks
Everything sucks, everything
Sucks.

Even my vacuum cleaner.

We'll kick your assess
Kick your asses, kick your
Asses.
Cause even my bedroom is cleaner.

MTV sucks, MTV sucks, MTV sucks,
MTV
Sucks.

Even my vacuum cleaner.
Knows my dog's meaner.
