GUILTY 'TIL PROVEN OOPS: 
Wrongfully Accused in the USA.
     by Prime Anarchist
What do David Keaton, Randall Padgett,
Ronald Keine, Jay Smith, Perry Cobb
and Freddy Pitts have in common?
  All were released from death row
between 1973 and 1997, having served
a combined total of 35 years.
  Wrongfully accused.
  Has anyone looked them in the eye
and said sorry? Not one that I know
of.
  Mumia Abu Jamal would add 17 years 
to that total! 69 other people have
been released since 1972 because the
US justice system had made what we 
should call a big boo boo, for all
intents and purposes.
   I became a tax-payer in this country 
on or about 1986. I stayed that way 
for quite a few years. The more I
learn, the more I say "too many years,
!Ya Basta!"
  OK Lemme get to the point.
  Padgett, Smith, Cobb, Abu-Jamal,
let me be the next to say I'm sorry.
!Lo fucking siento! Me f***ing disculpe.
OR AM I THE FIRST? Anyone care to 
repeat after me? I'm sorry. Where do
we go from here?
Keaton, Keine, Pitts; I'm sorry, but
I don't apologize for your plight. 
That didn't happen during MY cash-flow
citizenship. Didn't happen on my watch.
I empathize, I feel sorry, but I didn't
allow these ones. Not my 'ballofwax.'
Please forgive me, I paid my taxes like
a "good nazi."
   Where do we go from here? I guess 
the Pope's guiltier than me. He started 
to atone earlier, and he's still going at
it. He's pushing harder. Let me nudge the
Pope a little.
   Hey Polish Pontiff. Let my death row
people go. Talk louder, Pope. The prison
industrial complex isn't hearing you yet.
  /prime/
     a side note that may hurt a little:
     if you're white, mostly white, 
     or "passing" and you ever got 
     pulled over for driving the wrong 
     way on a one-way or something and 
     all YOU got was a "let that be a
     warning" rather than handcuffs,
     bruises and your brother on death-
     row, repeat after me:
       "I'm really, really sorry."

To the Editor of ATI:
I only submit this spam in full because 
135 seconds after I posted a "usenet"
blasting Viagra as something that 
sucks, I received this in my box.
I don't have anything but two 
co-incident-al events here to go on, 
so I submit this for ATI's Conspiracy 
of the Month.

Dear Mr. Benchley:
	Thank you for taking the 
time to read this letter. I have 
enjoyed you books very much!  
I, in turn, am working on a 
writing project that entails
contacting writers, editors, 
and publishers who have a bit 
more familiarity with the horror 
genre than most others do, and 
asking them to vote for their
own personal choice of the three 
best horror films of all time.   
    I am tabulating the votes 
as they come in, calculating 
the results, and determining the 
order of approximately the top 50 
or 100 films to receive votes. 
I will of course be happy to 
furnish those results to all 
who have responded. The results 
will form the basis of a magazine 
article I will write on the very 
subject.
    I would be most honored if you 
could therefore e-mail your response 
to this thorny question: What are the 
three best horror films of all time?
    Best of luck to you in all 
your endeavors!
Yours Sincerely,
William Kozy care of

BUSINESSES TELL THEIR CUSTOMERS 
WHICH PRODUCTS TO BOYCOTT.
  "If you worry about peasant
farmers," says a skater-kid-looking-
guy representing a coffee company 
which uses a lot of green marketing
and has a "star" in its name and 
also a "bucks."
   "Don't buy the mocha. If you 
worry about recycling, avoid the
styrofoam cups," he says looking 
so much the automaton a Seattle/
Chicago merger made him.
   "If you worry about exploited
workers," he says in a deliberate
act of sensibility and self-awareness,
"use the self-serve line."

Heads up.
Father Roy will be in Lodi, NJ
March 20-21, and Philly Mar 24-28.
He will be in Boston Apr 9-10,

In memory of Alice Benally 
(Oct 30 1923 - May 21 1997), 
Robert Dorman will be posting a
photograph of her (John Benally's 
mother) to his BM web page later 
today.
Here is John's statement:

MARCH 1999 AD
My name is John Benally and I am 
'Where the water meets together' 
Clan and born for edge water, 
my patrilineal clan is Apache Clan. 
My matrilineal Grandfather is 'Many 
Goat Clan'.
We need all the support we can 
at this time, a pressure on the 
BIA, the Dept of Interior.
We are threatened with losing our way 
of life by relocating to the outside 
world. It is very important that we 
preserve our culture and ways of life. 
We can't live in western world. Our 
choices.. our ways of life.. being on 
land exercising our belief and we don't 
want any U.S. Government interference 
with our life. This is on behalf of all 
the ways on Indian land in this 
hemisphere. We don't like the human 
abuse, natural resource abuse thats 
happening in our nation.
As we are all aware as five fingered 
family... we are ALL aware that we
are losing all the differant 
atmosphere and depletion of our 
ozone, to where we're liable to 
sacrifice under these consequences.
We all know that once everything 
was in balance and pure, now we all
know it's out of balance. Climate, 
global changes are happening, it's
here, greenhouse effect is here.
These are my awareness's and my
concern.. then I think we are all 
in the same boat. So act now, pressure
the United States Government to tell 
them that they're liable for it.
That means industrial nation, fossil 
fuel addiction, and nuclear addict.
And thank you very much.
John Benally.

SHIPWRECK MAY BELONG TO MARCO POLO
<PAWN> Newport, RI - A marinara collegist
has uncovered clues that suggest a wreck
at the bottom of the harbour is that of
the HMS Sparticus, the ship that carried
the Polish Pope, Capt. Marco Polo on his
legendary South Pacific expedition two
years ago. 
   After James Cook didn't want it 
anymore, Marco Polo bought it for an 
undisclosed amount of $5.97; renamed it
and its fate became lost to time.
   But DK Biafra says her reading of 
old Yiddish proverbs indicates that 
Sparticus may be lying in 20 feet of 
jellyfish and Naval Weekend vomit in
Newsport Harbour.
   If she is right, it "would easily
be one of the most important vessels
to be discovered in the history of
international merry time exploration,"
says Cotten "Hot Rod" Mather, an 
underwater skinnydippologist at the
University of Rhode Island.
   "If she's wrong," said John
Ledyard, UConn's department head of
Merry Time Anthropology, Archeology,
and Geological Surveys 7-432, "we'll
stone her in a public den of thieves,
vermin, prostitutes and politicians."
   The Sparticus will be razed up as
soon as the divers can entice Keiko
to get away from it.

ATI FLAGWORD OF THE DAY
If on a resume or at an interview someone
keeps telling you how "proactive" they
are, steer clear. "Don't call us, we'll 
call you." Get away, flee, kick them 
out. 
  They won't get a darned thing done.
  Proactive is a twenty-dollar word.
You can buy it in sheets at temp agencies
and job search companies all over the 
world. Why, I once saw an 8X10 chock
full of these "power words." I was
tempted to apply for a job filling 
out the resume alphabetically just 
to see what comes of the interview. 
   But I didn't need a job.

SWAG ME WITH A SPOONERISM
I've just learned of a neo-new
music industry standard. I do the
"double neo" there because it might
not be so new afterall. <payola>
It's something that probably should
have stopped before it began <payola>
Everyone from the Sex Pistons to
RadioHeard and everyone in between,
it seems, is required to think up a
junk toy <payola> price range $30-80
to attach to promo CD's given or lent
to journalists and DJ's. <payola>
It also parallels something which
greatly disturbs me in the past and
present <payola> 
   Say you're a rear-end admiral in
the US Davy or a Prentagon poop. And
you're trying to decide who gets a
billion dollar contract <payola>
Suddenly your secretary gets a dozen
roses from an anonymous source named
P Takis Veliotis of General Dynamics.
It's got hundred dollar bills poked
onto all the thorns. <payola> Who
Ya Gonna Award?
   I don't know. Am I making too 
much here? Reaching? Am I drawing
a parallel <payola> that's just
not close enough? You decide.



We end with two parodies to the
same song. NSinc's "Your Love is
Like a River."

1.
Your love is like a river
Gettin' me wet
Your soul is like a secret 
That I never forget.
When I look into your eyes
My heart gets all blue.
God must have trust-
Ed me just to lust after you.

2.
You came into my life
Sent from above
When I lost all hope 
You showed me love
I'm checkin for you 
Boy you're right on time
Angel of mine.
