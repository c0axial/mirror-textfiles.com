Hola, I'm prime anarchist, and this is my 'zine
for the weekend of May 11, 2001. Anyone think
to check what day the next "lunar event" is?
I didn't bother. Busy and distracted I guess.
Hope it's close. If not, oh well. Next time.
  Rather than write a column this week, I've
decided to let a former political prisoner 
take it over. One who AI didn't pay an awful 
lot of mind, because they just kinda didn't 
understand the whole thing very well.

MY 1ST RSA CON
By Kevin Mitnick, 
REprinted from SecurityFocus.com

The annual RSA Conference is noted for being the 
largest data security and cryptography conference 
in the world. It's the place the most respected
cryptographers and security professionals in the 
industry gather to share their knowledge and 
experience. But I still found it incomplete.
  The 2001 conference, held earlier this month 
in San Francisco, was my first RSA -- I was there 
as a guest of the fine security vendor Authentify, 
Inc. My first impression of the conference was 
made at the opening session, where rocker Pat 
Benatar (hi Terry) belted out a live parody of 
her hit song "Heartbreaker." The title of the 
new song: "Codebreaker." 

  You're a Codebreaker
  Crash Maker, File Taker
  Don't you mess around with me...

Aside from the entertainment value, I was impressed 
with the sheer size of the conference. It's clear 
that the last six years have seen tremendous growth 
in the information security space. Literally. There 
were over 10,000 registered attendees, and Moscone 
Center's cavernous exhibit halls became a dizzying 
250-ring circus featuring seemingly every security 
act in Creation, from Acotec to ZixIt.
  Having once been banned from the 1991 DECUS CON 
in Las Vegas solely based on my reputation as a 
hacker (and my forays into DEC's Easynet), I know 
the feeling of being unwelcome. So I was pleasantly
surprised to find most of the attendees friendly and 
respectful. It was good to reintegrate myself back 
into the computer security business without much
resistance. No one thought to ask me what I was 
doing there while walking around with no badge. 
  A lot of attendees didn't even recognize me. 
While waiting for a session on computer viruses 
to begin, I was listening to a conversation between 
two men seated next to me. When I glanced down at 
one person's badge, it said "FBI, Special Agent" 
right below the name. It was amusing for me to end 
up eavesdropping on a couple of FBI agents who were 
clueless to my identity. Or were they?
  {--=____The Bold and the Badgeless____=--}
  But when all is said and done, there was something 
missing from the conference. No sessions were offered 
covering physical attacks or social engineering. You 
could spend a fortune purchasing technology and services
from every exhibitor, speaker and sponsor at the RSA 
Conference, and your network infrastructure could still 
remain vulnerable to old-fashioned manipulation.
  The world's largest security conference should have 
offered a session that discussed these types of attacks, 
if nothing more than to raise awareness.
  For the most prestigious security conference in the 
world, I was also surprised by the lack of physical 
security for the exhibit hall itself. While waiting 
for my contact person to arrive, I decided to take a 
stroll to locate Authentify's booth. The hall was 
closed to everyone, with the exception of staff 
setting up the exhibits. Although I was wearing 
no form of identification (such as a exhibitor's 
badge), I managed to gain access into the exhibit 
hall on two occasions without being questioned. I 
walked around for a good half hour before even 
locating the booth. 
  No one thought to ask me what I was doing there 
while walking around with no badge. Anyone else 
could have walked off with an executive's laptop 
or PDA without being noticed. You would think with 
tens of thousands of dollars worth of computer 
equipment and technology lying around, and the 
nature of the conference itself, that the exhibit 
hall wouldn't have been so vulnerable.
  What new security technologies will be marketed 
as the killer-app at next year's RSA Conference? 
This year, deployment of public key infrastructures 
(PKI) dominated the scene. But while PKI technology 
may reduce the risk of hacker attacks, it's not a 
silver bullet. If your goal is to protect your 
network, you can not rely on technology alone.

/prison before getting a trial. If anyone at Amnesty\
\  thought that wasn't political, prime anarchist   /
 \  just says they  really  really  suck.          /

to marco:
Isn't this late?
  And who's the girl in the window?
  Yeah, I've noticed your ATI's contain 
more "reportage".
  [yes it was late, too much to report
   really. More later. film at 11ish]

    |^&*-|

zap: 
you should set up a little e-zine that makes a 
weekly list of links to what's good and interesting 
on the www.indymedia.org newswire, and pub it as a 
feature. 
  that way, people like me can read the newswire, 
and not have to ignore it for lack of time allotted 
to wading :>

 [dru, wading is the understatement of the millenium.]
 [good idea though. I might dabble in that soon.  ]
 [anyone else wanna do one too?  ]

  marco, let's hope, that you're right about this 
movement being indivisible. Because, it definitely 
seems to have a decent chance of effecting some 
positive change.

  0P-3D: Our OP-ED Section. 1 ea.

A Black Male journalist on a commercial television 
news show interviews a white woman from Harvard 
Business School, I think it was discussing the 
new ethic on salaries based on, her book titled 
"Salaries Not Secrets." (I think that's the title, 
I should have had a notepad with me while I watched 
I guess. But this story quickly and suddenly blew my 
mind and then it was over, just like that. I'll try 
to look it all up for you later. Right now I'm too
distracted.)
  With the ability of someone to get in and then 
email a corporation's salaries to each other, what 
could happen.
  She discusses that some companies are building 
an ethic where salaries are given based directly 
on their performance, and they're so proud of the 
salaries, they'll openly display them 
everywhere, "radically honest."
  This, she says undermines any possibility of 
hackers wreaking havoc.
  Other companies aren't so proud, though. She 
says there are companies out there who are paying 
quite, well; "less than equitably" is how she 
describes the paying out of different salaries to 
various employees who are perhaps fulfilling the 
same exact tasks.
  These companies, she says are beginning to see 
the new info-age as a threat to their very essence.
  I must say, I got a lot out of that story. Even 
though I've lost track of even what network ran it 
(I do that a lot these days, they kind of melt 
together like a nitemare.) I enjoyed the interview.
  Now I have to end by adding, though; that I would 
have thought much more highly of the whole thing 
  (to be frank, his color and her gender had me 
distracted in that I kept going back to "statistics
say she gets 3/4 what a white male gets; he gets n/8 
what a white male gets; stats say she gets 3...") 
  Woops, run-on sentence. The TV channel would've had
more credibility with me if at some point during the
interview he'd asked her, "and what's your pay?" to
which she might retort with "n/year or x/hour, and
you?"

Balls
To the little white 8 year olds
Boys and Girls on the red
Little League team;

After they played T-Ball
Balls
On the White House lawn.
Passing out white presidential balls.

The bleachers didn't look the least bit
Segregated.
No, blacks and whites all enjoying a game
Together.

Teams sure did.
I counted one black chile on the white team.
Double-take my head. Did I count one or
Zero? One or zero whites on the black team.

Two parts of town?
Two parts of the world?
A world apart.
Two parts of the Dis-Nited States of
