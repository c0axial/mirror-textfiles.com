Hi Marco,
How goes it?
Have you heard from Ground Zero/Mary at all?
She seems to have disappeared off the net entirely.
If you do happen to touch base with her, can you
pass along a message?
 Just tell her she's missed and pass along my email
address.
......@...net.
Thanks

   *MUZIK RE:VIEW*

Lucky Boys Confusion Made Me Dance Too Much Last Nite.

  Road trip. 3pm. Drive clear across the midwest to see
fave band in the world perform in a club called the
Warehouse. A place that bears quite a few striking 
resemblences to Toads Place, New Haven. 
  Lucky Boys are doing extreme around Chicago. They've 
had a song in heavy rotation at many local stations and
some national ones for 8 or 9 weeks now. And to top it
off they have a new CD coming out this March! And I'm 
not even sick of "Growing Out Of It" yet! Are they going
to be my next Led Zep or what? No, in case you don't
know what I mean by that, I for the most part think
Zeppelin really sucks; but I've NEVER gotten sick of
Stairway, D'yer Maker and Whole Lotta Love, all these
years. What's it been since '71??? Somethin' tells me
that's gonna be the case with this CD too. Get back
with me 2020. And the next CD's bound to follow suit
judging by what they previewed last nite! If you've
never experienced the live energy of an LBC performance,
move to Chicago now; you owe it to yourself. 
  I asked Luckyboys' lead singer about getting "most
requested song" at Q101 and its national affiliates
so many times in a row and check this out...
  He wanted "Fred Astaire" to be their hit, telling me
they'd written Q101's favorite "Dumb Pop Song," in about
fifteen minutes. I want 4080 to be their hit, as it's
practically my life's anthem, but "Dumb Pop Song" as
their hit-to-be, how cool is that??? Poetic, wow! I can
see Staples Theatre or Radio City Music Hall now.
  "And the award for Song Of The Year; Dumb Pop Song,
by the Lucky Boys."
  Stubhy told me he'd go to the mic [motions to cup the
mic up to his mouth for that spooky sound] and say, 
"This is a really dumb song," [fakes stage left] 
[jumps back] "Buy our album, there's better shit on it."
  [exit stage left]
  LBC made me dance too much last nite. Now I'm gonna be
sore all day, huh?

   *MUSIC-AWARD CEREMONY REVIEW*

HAVE YOU TRIED STAPLES?

ATI gives you live-via-television coverage
of the 42nd street YAMMMies.
(Young Americans Making Mature Music awards.) 
  Hey TLC, God is blushing.
  I have to say that if you didn't have secret service support
I just KNOW you wouldn't've climbed those stairs dressed up
all in your booty like that.
  And while I'm on it, J'Lopez! What   _WAS_  that??  Why
bother to wear clothes, then? You might've just come out in a
towel and dropped it in exchange for the envelope you and
David could use to cover your OWN private parts.
  I mean c'mon I know Cher started it and all, way back when,
since you and I were knee high to the tall grass, but ay yay
yay. This is got way out of hand, girl. If music means that
little to you, except as afterthought and so much window
dressing, then why not tell NARA you don't want the thing and
let us humans compete on a level playing field, ok?
  Nice to know the Pixie Sticks have a firm grasp on kinda
country, kinda pop, kinda hip, kinda hop. Not too edge, not too
bland, this one's just right for MH-1 TV.
  Really, I thought I was watching a Stryper video!
  
  I wanna thank Sony for owning 1% of all the minerals pulled out
of the ground to make each and every CD, even indies and blanks.

  Go Christina go. You must be reading on at least a 7th grade
level by now. What year did you graduate? And now it's time to
try really hard to make it look like I'm not reading a
tel-e-prom-p-ter. Quick Christina, act like you just suddenly
found out you won. If you say "My gosh, you guys," one more
time I'm gonna throw a Tickle-Me-Elmo doll at you. I do have
to say your evening dress was much classier than Lopez'.
  Marc Anthony, Ricki Martin, the Iglesias Boys: Yeah, let's
honor latin music for at least ten minutes, eh? If we keep at
it everyone'll sound like Charo meets Herb Alpert. I'm STILL
waiting for Menudo Man to write a song that DOESN'T sound like
a soccer anthem. I don't mean to be too slammish, I like some
of what he does. Just too bad he's bought and paid for; I'd
love to hear him speak his mind someday. 
  "Mi amiga???" "Quiero Taco Bell???" Rosie O'Donnell, pardon
my french, you're an insensitive asshole.
   Nice to see Billy Joel out and about. If you're wondering
what happened to him, he thought the next little thing he might
dabble in would be a little classical piano the way Garth Brooks
can try a little pro ball. Bit off a little more than you can
chew there, Billy, Didja? Maybe some more piano lessons would
help you get over the embarrassment.
  Teach your child about the effects of commercial music.
  You got the right one, baby. Uh uh.
  BSB, you guys are more retro than you'll ever know. What's
with the store-bought classical guitar though. Get real. Call
me.
  7-Up. The Un-Musical. The now-owned-by-coca-cola. 
CDNow.com - where music almost happens. Pay us later,
or pay us now.com. Wherever there's dry skin, more people
undergo lay-offs & corporate buy-outs at Cheesborough Ponds
LLC.
  And the winner of looking like Barbie HasAHissyFit, Faith
Hill. Man, I feel like a french fry.
  No matter where you go the Chevy Tracker'll cost you
around $100 a month to insure. Web without wires - a perfect
fit for music without, er, uh, music. Like fishing without a
net. Just stick in your head and open your mouth.
  And the winner for song of the year - Jon Benet Ramsey.
  Is there a ghostwriter in the house?
  The price for a song these days. $1500
  The look on her face when she can't even tell her spouse or
her mom for another ten years she wrote it? Priceless.
  There are some things money just can't buy.
  For everything else there's ASCAP.

I mean Folgers. I mean CitiCrank.
Sting: I'm not a bass player, but I play one on TV and vinyl.
  Neil Diamond. Saved by the Geritol. (not a major slam, at least
his toupe matched. Elton's was horrid!) Father of at least a handful
of rockstars. Screech! Do you believe in life after TinPanAlley?
  Record of the year: Santana. Well...it's about dang time. Give the
guy some credit. I mean despite "bought and paid for" he still
manages to somehow get the message out. Because, and this is
important to me now, you may have missed this if you blinked,

THE MUSIC IS THE MESSAGE.

  Look out - it's almost Rage Against the Machine. We're an American
Band. Last nite in Little Rock, Tipper Gore looked up Shirley Manson's
skulgrl skirt. Hey she found Kid Rock. Who knew? Be glad it wasn't
Mini Me!
  Music+Economic slavery+Apartheid=YAMMMYs. Need I say more? OK, I
will.
  For 40% less hair, it's Pfizer Corpse, with all new WetChemical
InAPlasticThrowawayBottle. Heinekin, it's all about the Batman.
"When I was 18 I was at the Wynn Dixie saying 'paper or plastic.'"
  Yeah, right Rosie. 2 things. And sorry, they didn't have plastic
yet, and you were being agressively groomed for Broadway and TV I'm
sure. Tell the truth, Rosie. Who went to Wynn Dixie FOR YOU??? Or
did you do that for a whole summer once "to learn the value of a dollar?"
I haven't wanted to call someone a schmuck in 10 years. I won't start now.
  British Spares, what's with those robots? I thought I was watching
"Saving Private Ryan." Gee whiz Hit'ny. I didn't learn how to blow my
lines lipsynching 'til I was at least 22. 
  Music is a magical gift that we must market multi-level on the
internet. Each year I have the great pleasure of owning the exclusive
rights to at least 40 new human beings. Harry Belafonte for World
Activist, humanitarian and all around great guy. Hard medicine. Hard
medicine. Johnny Lee Hooker. Somebody get that man a Pepsi. Mitch
Miller, too cool. Sing along!
  Arlo got his mom's hair, or what? And now that he's finally paid off
his IRS/FBI/USA bill, Willie "Here-hold-this-Dorito-bag-while-we-blue-
screen-a-Bosnian-baby" Nelson. How cool is that? 
  It is my distinct pleasure to get frowned at by Billy Joel and
Michael Bolton at the same time. Seperated at birth or what??? Clive
Davis and Willie too for that matter. Elton John, Disney's part-owner
yet, or not? Lord Elton, Sir. Make me one promise, Sharon. Please say
you'll NEVER write a song for me when I die.
  Yammmys: I could list two or three places where there's a more
controlled environment, but I'd better not.
  Heiney, it's all about the Beerjamins. Death by Chocolate. Moose
with attitude. Sounds like Devil Went Down To A&M Records; He Was
Lookin For a Song To Steal. And now for something culturally different.
Why do I get the same feeling as when I'm in Epcot center? Don't touch
the help. Don't ask them too many questions. "Don't touch that door; 
there's nothin' in there for you... Ummm... Security!"
  George Benson, I hope when I'm about your age I can still jam with
people like Erika Badu. Heck. I hope I can still do an Eb minor scale!
  Lever2000 for all your family's temporary agency jobs. Sorry, I'm
a tad cynical tonite. Meet me at DQ. No lie, the first place that ever
called the police on me for playing my guitar for tips on the sidewalk.
  Carlos and Rob thank you for not lipsyncing.
  I felt it.
  
Music - make it real : Or else forget about it.

Best Metal Performance: No Scrubs by Black Sabbath.

Biggest Expenditure of the Defense Budget: Iron Man by Brit Spearz.

  Hey! Whose waist is smaller, you think; Lauryn Hill or Bob Dylan?
Santana for Clive Davis. Long live John Coltrain. See? Despite
Bought/Paid...

NARAS

If you play Saran Wrap backwards on a turntable you get A Grammy!


 -*=ENDANGERED SPEECHIES=*-
a weekly column

Here at ATI we're going to attempt bringing out one new
word a week. An "endangered word." Or a word "in danger"
of "extinction." One that doesn't seem to matter much to
people on Florence and Normandy or at John Gotti's humble
little house.
  I bought Feb '94's Wired Magazine for 25c at my favorite
used record store today and the woman ringing me out, maybe
my mom's age was asking me to help her remember the expression
in music that's "sort of an antonym to wired."
  "Un-hinged" was the closest she could start with. None of 
what I would consider a straight antonym did it for her.
  "Unplugged, maybe?" I offer, after asking her to think of a
sentence that it fits in. She didn't even get a word out,
moved her hands around a little and I heard her fine.
  "Unplugged," she said. "That's it. Thanks!"
  Have a nice day.

The Apollo since Michael Jackson did that famous
spinning around thing that led to his "Moonwalk."

We end with another ATI Broadside Song.
