Hello, welcome to ATI 301.
  I'm prime anarchist and it's pretty close to the half
moon. Can you feel it? Or half of it?
  It's Friday. Are you enjoying leftovers? I am. Although
if I have another creamy, mushroomy, lachoy noodly green
bean casserole bean, I'm going to puke, I think.
  It was a great Thanksgiving. Wednesday, former residents
at the shelter I help run came by and cooked "mole." Mmmmm.
If you've never had it, I urge you to befriend someone who
knows what it is, or perhaps how to cook it. Because I don't
think it's good cold.
  So it was a deliscioususssssussss week. And last weekend,
wow. Where do I begin? Aight. I danced too much, two days
in a row. Blew out both my calves. We're talking pain, 
agony, and limping for three extra days past the weekend.
It was early thurs - or late wednes, before I could walk
right. But it was a lot of fun. Hey! Quit picking on me.
If I can't dance, then it's your revolution and not mine.

ANNOUNCING
<Seventeen's "Trend Tour" CATTLE CALL and EXTREME MARKDOWN.

We are looking for guys and girls to model in our
<SEVENTEEN Trend Tour Fashion Show! *

What We're Looking For:
  You must be between the ages of 13 and 13 1/2, have a
  lot of energy and move well on stage. If you are very
  shy and don't like to be in front of large crowds saying
  obnoxious things, this show is not for you.
  There are no height or weight requirements and you don't
  have to look like a supermodel to enter - just be yourself!
  Remember that if you are selected to be a model, you will
  be representing <Seventeen. It will be fun, but it is work!

How the CattleCall Will Run:
  - Line up in the designated Cattle Call area
  - Complete the attached application
  - A <Seventeen rep will take your picture and paste it on 
    your application, your forehead, and all over the world
    wide web.
  - When it's your turn, walk across the platform for the
    <Seventeen judges. Turn around a lot. That way they can
    see all your parts.
  - If you are chosen to be a model,* we will announce it
    this evening and give you additional info about the 
    fitting and the rehearsal.
  - Please do not call <Seventeen for the results

  Don't forget...
  Enter to win amazing door prizes at the Cattle Call and 
  Fashion Show. **

** No purchase necessary for door prizes

  Even if you aren't chosen, come to be part of our viewing
  audience and check out each other, be obnoxious, and score
  lots of free goodies! 

  And get ready to rock! Catch a live performance by <Atlantic
  Records' Fray-Jay at the fashion show after the Cattle Call***

*** Performance subject to change.

  And while you're in the mall, please participate in EXTREME
  SHOPPING at EXTREME MARKDOWN Prices for the rest of the 
  EXTREME EVENING.
