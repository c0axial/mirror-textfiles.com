I thought you (and the rest of ATI) might appreciate this. It's especially
funny considering they're sending them to activist listservs.

COLUMNAR COLUMNS COLUMNIZED COLUMNINGLY

part iii


You're starting to realize what they'll do because it's
the third or fourth person of at least nine that this has 
happened to in front of you.
  You find out next that she's been moved to another part
of the same state and like you she's now in charge of half
a dozen people below her. What? Parallel to you? Woah. 
Another similar incident, you go to the same "her:"
  "Lemme have him, I'll take care of him." This time you'd
gotten to know him a little. Kept in touch through the 
years. 
  Lo and behold they moved him to a different state and 
he's no in charge of you really, but way up higher than
you in the "chain of command," so to speak.
  Yes, I said "chain." Years or decades ago, most companies
weren't run like military wannabes. But these days more
and more are.
  A military structure can get rid of bureaucracy but not
corruption. Remember that -- you might need it some day.
  A corporation run this way just might as well be called
a paramilitary like the Boy Scouts or the KKK but I digress.
  Radio Shack had what was called "stealing." Your store's
shrinkage could not be above 6% a third month in a row or
"Texas" would come up and audit the hell out of you. No one
I know had ever suffered one of these audits, but it was 
one of those scenes NO ONE wanted to find out about.
  Hence, stealing. The store I was an A.M. to usually 
hovered between 2% and 4%, so we were seldom on the receiving
end, but often the "giver."
  "You've got a pickemup truck, right Prime?"
  "Yeah."
  "I have some items that need to go to store #432. Load up 
these items from the stockroom and deliver them. Take the
whole day, I'll clock you out."
  He said he'd float me a few small commissions too, from 
batteries and telephones throughout the day so I didn't have
a big hole in my afternoon or evening.
  After a while I was entrusted with the phone call itself.
  "Radio Shack #435, Prime Anarchist speaking, how may I 
help you, sir or ma'am."
  So the voice on the other end is "we're at 5ish for the
month. How're you looking?" 
  "Not sure," I tell him, "I'll check." "Hey boss, how are
we looking this month?" Store #408 is over 5ish again."
  "One or two," my boss tells me, "give 'em whatever the
heck they need."
  This time around it was something like seven Tandy TX
computers, six SX's, five telephones, four shortwave radios,
three discontinued turntables, two microphones and a partridge
family promotional record album.
  Well, something like that. Not precisely, but I assure you,
it was in the low thousands. The lowest I'd ever conspired to
"steal" was high hundreds.   Last I checked, a felony in NY,
CT, RI areas was theft over 300. I'm sure it's higher now, but 
surely not quite into the thousands.
  Anyways this was stealing but not quite that kind of stealing.
Or is it? Yeah. Ask me then, I didn't know. Ask me now? That's
why I'm writing this up.
  So every other month or so a store would steal enough from
our store to bring us nearer to 6% but never over.


         [finish later]

Theirs would go under 6 by stealing from us and/or another
store or two.
  Thousands of dollars every other month or so just floating
around from store to store well by itself in a vacuum it 
probably doesn't look so bad, but lets look at a couple other
things here at Radio Theft. Tandy Corpse. Realistic. Pilferage
'r' Us before we tumble the whole house of cards. Now I know
there's going to be hardly any outrage to speak of from the
mainstream here. Heck, when Oliver North who's at least 500%
more corrupt than Radio Shack could EVER be,

GUITAR AMBASSADOR'S WISHES FINALLY GRANTED

LINARES, Spain -- Andres Segovia died fifteen years ago.
  The master classical guitarist was finally brought back 
to his hometown as he wished. Exhumed from the Madrid cemetery 
where he was first buried, Segovia's remains were brought 
to Linares in Jaen province, the heart of Spain's olive-growing 
region.
  Hailed the world over as the greatest classical guitarist of 
the 20th century, Segovia died at 94 years old in 1987. People
say he elevated the guitar from a lowly bar instrument to one 
played on classical concert stages around the world, garnering 
as much respect as the violin or piano. Segovia once said it 
was always a goal of his to "separate the guitar from mindless, 
folklore-type entertainment."
  Town hall officials said his widow Emilia avoided moving his 
body to Linares, even though it was his wish, until a proper 
resting place was prepared. They refurbished a 16th-century 
palace to house the musician's remains and a museum dedicated 
to his life and work.
  A wake was scheduled for Monday night with a burial on Tuesday. 
Emilia de Segovia led the funeral cortege that left Madrid Monday. 
Awaiting in Linares was 32-year-old Carlos Segovia, the only 
survivor among Segovia's four children.
  The Segovia museum will feature sheet music written by Segovia, 
suits he wore while performing, medals he won and a favorite guitar 
nicknamed "La Nina."
  If anyone finds any old sheetmusic that Segovia was working on
prior to the bombing of Guernica, please just slip it under the 
door. No questions will be asked.

HEY NONI:  Dreaming 'Bout My Baby

[RESTAURANT SCENE]
  "It's about Wynona."
  "Is she ok? Her case started?"
  "No, I'm bringin' news from Manhatten."
  "Oh, her wacky Brechtish 1-act? How's that going?"
  "Yeah, it took a turn. She's giving herself a 'cameo.'"
  "No way, and they agreed to it? Don't tell me she's going
to ruin her case by discussing everything onstage."
  "Sorta. But I think it might've turned out good. Real good."
  [UNISON: From ten other diners] "What? What did she do?"
  "Stole all the evidence back, flew right to the Bowery and
donated it all to the Catholic Worker men's house.
  [UNISON: many affected effeminate voices and overly 
   demonstrative dramatics. "what evidence, your honor?"]
