A few months ago I watched movie footage of indigenous Mayan people
being relocated by military and paramilitary forces in much the same
way Navajo and Hopi people had been abused in the 1940's, 70's and late
90's. From that day until last weekend I've been wondering "what besides
uranium 238 ("entonces" plutonium 239) could be under that land???"
   I've been asking everyone I've encountered who might know if there
could possibly be uranium in Chiapas. No one seemed to know.
   And then it happened last Saturday that a Mayan man gave a lecture
in Madison, Wisconsin describing all the resources under the indigenous
people in Chiapas.
        O N E   O F   T H E    
         T O P   3   W A S  
        U R A N I U M ! ! !
   Perhaps there is enough in the three "veins" he described to repay
the debt to the US Government? Perhaps that is the real reason NAFTA was
passed? Perhaps the Mayan people should be some of the richest humans on
this earth instead of the most abused, hungry, poor and tired...

  I have been living in a state that has tooooooooo damn many phone
companys.
  It is a pain in the ass and the wallet. 
  It seems that now gte is taking over all the small towns in 
the mid west. They are switching us back over to message units.  
I got word in the mail the other day saying they wanted to 
charge me 3 cents per message unit and that a message unit was 1 min   
Well i was happy about this change til i read the fine print.  
That's 3 cents above and beyond all other charges that may apply. 
And seeing how i have a 2 cent a minute charge on my local calls 
already, i was pissed and i gave a call to the 800# that they listed  
and while i was talking to them on the phone i got a message recording 
that i had been on the fone for 45 min and that the message unit charge 
was $$$$  so and so...      
   So i now know that i pay for 1800 calls and incoming calls as well.

LETTER TO ATI@ETEXT.ORG
I think maybe the entire US ought to be condemned.
   Aloud, I was reading the article about scaffolding falling off a
skyscraper in NYC's Times Square to my grandmother and she turned to
me matter of fact and plain; said, "happens all the time. Long as I
can remember in NY. Sometimes entire floors fall off. Dead people
everywhere. And the damage to the avenues, Dear God, takes weeks to
repair sometimes."
   To know that's happened once is bad enough; knowing we're living
with this as a regular thing now is just pretty dumb and disturbing.
   Worse than finding entire families living without plumbing. Is there
a national version of a building and health inspector? Perhaps the
whole Union ought to go the way of the red, white and black warning
sign.

it was the wrong one, and it caused this email to

Hey Marc! 
Here's a little something that you might find of interest 
and would make a rather random and funny submission to ATI.
John D. (860)

On July 20th 1998 while I was at work at the A&P Superfoodmart 
I was called to a meeting. I was unceremoniously marched down 
the wonderful under painted,crack walled, overheated and just 
rather unpleasant hallway to the dreaded "break room." 
Once there we were all seated and handed a "Action Plan" - 
the key word for a paid break where we are told how to improve 
our store a.k.a. Nap time. This weeks plan showed us how we needed 
to improve in order to keep employes from quiting after working for 
one or two weeks. The fascinating part was the chart included that 
showed the most common reasons for quiting. 5% said it was their 
manager that was the problem, 20% said that there were too many 
schedule conflicts, 5% said that the Union fees were not worth it, 
5% were undifined, and a whole 65% said that the 
piped in elevator music was the cause for quiting.



2ATI:
"When we got organized as a country and we wrote a fairly radical
Constitution with a radical Bill of Rights, giving a radical amount 
of individual freedom to Americans, it was assumed that the 
Americans who had that freedom would use it responsibly....  
However, now there's a lot of irresponsibility. And so a lot of 
people say there's too much freedom. When personal freedom's being 
abused, you have to move to limit it."

Prime,
Hey!  It's not ATI, it's me
Okay that was lame
Anyway..  The reason for my writing is this:  Soon 
(probably tomorrow) ATI will be on at least one web page that I 
know of.  Just go to http://www.anglefire.com/co/BlueFireHome  
Then go to alternative writings, that'd be the Geocities cite.  
All of the ATI writings I have recieved should be
there..

MESA, AZ - Despite a complete lack of interest in skin moisturization,
area electrician Drew Shymanski took a complimentary six-ounce bottle
of new Pond's Extra-Soft moisturizing lotion from a company representative
while walking home Monday. "I don't know, it was free," Shymanski
said of the no-obligation sample. Upon returning home, Shymanski put
the lotion in his bathroom cabinet, where it will remain unopened for
seven years.

And now a Parody or two and a poem or 3; because
when there's nothing else left, 
metaphor is k00l.

Does your chewing gum lose its flavor on the bedpost overnite.
When your mother says don't chew it do you swallow it on site.
Do you reach from under the table,
Stick it in your mouth and say yum.
Ooh, ABC gum.

Does your mind get tired of tuning in that propagandic stuff.
When CNN says things around Wall Street are getting tough.
Do you reach for television;
Kick it in the tube and say ooh,
Ooh, ABC sucks.


   ---   ---   ---    ---

So this is capitalism
And a disguised police state
Let's hope that our car payments
Aren't mailed (journalized (2nd verse)) in too late
Some Jordan Marsh credit
To buy lots of clothes.
Tryin to get to the movie rental store
Before it is closed.
And have a good Sunday
Cause the blue laws are gone.
And train a black and brown doberman
To bite people who cross your lawn.

TARA a poem by the Prime Anarchist

Tara you played fair
And that's just not fair.
After my heart Tara,
You know there's no more there.

7 card no peek; and I did.
Checkin' her out on a quarter bid.
She took me for 75, 
A friendship bracelet;
And my ackey brakey heart.

I'm seein her once more
And she's callin out my name.
She took my heart 
Pray she don't ask for a diamond.

In this game they call hearts
Tara, what a way to start.
Methinks I like gofish better.


HUNGRY?
Guatemalan Java, Gazpacho and a garlic bagel.


TALVEZ ALGUNDIA by marco

Someday my hands might die before me.
When if then,
Please surround me with guitarists
That my muse can live longer.

If it is my feet first,
Please to have dancers come constantly.
Mostly girls
So my heart can live longer.
