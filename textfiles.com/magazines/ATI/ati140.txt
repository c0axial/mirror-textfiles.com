   BROUGHT ON BY "BREASTMILKS OF THE WORLD," A NEW SUBSIDIARY OF
BORDERS BOOKS AND TACO BELL.





3:50 pm e.s.t. 14 aug, 1998.
I'm fed up. VM-1 and HTV just played the same song at the same time.
   Less than one full minute off each other. "I Don't Want To Miss A 
Thing," by Aerosmith, George Bush's favorite Rock-n-Roll Republicans.
   Has something like this happened before? Are people going to get 
fired for this, or was this planned, and building up for a long time?
   I'm starting to not care; I'm so ticked off about this.

   Next up, Popup video sponsored by HTV and Popup Toaster Strudels.
   These are always fun to watch, but unlike many of you, I vividly
remember how Popup Video got its start, so I'll inform/remind all of
you.
   Remember when both VM-1 and HTV allowed you to modem in through
Compuserve and they would publish "all" of the typings "live" during
primetime?  Well it got so out of hand we now have Popup Video and
"Yo, I'd like to request my homey's song because he's fly, word up."
   You're in a mondo-controlled environ. Every pixel, every millisecond.
   WHY HAVEN'T YOU RIOTED OVER THIS?!?

(Your government will wish for you to believe it is to fight a

deaths of unarmed civilian indigenous Chiapanecos people. The

the ones who are still living))

the Western Shoshone. You know, Nevada: the place we A-bomb every day

Hello Marco Polo:

I just re-did my web page and want to invite you and all your 
friends to take a look.

Good to hear from you.

Dear Poetry Editor, /ATI/:

Hello!  
Thought I'd send you some of my work to consider for 
possible use in your magazine.  
My poetry, fiction, and nonfiction have most recently
appeared in Mindmares, ProMag Audio, and Storisende Verlag.

I hope some part of this submission finds a place in /ATI/.  
I thank you in advance for your time and 
consideration of these pieces.

	P E O P L E   H A V E   P R O B L E M S
                 a poem by Holly Day

I have to know exactly how
you touch them, your other women
do they like your hands
as much as I do, your long white fingers
tracing sick lies into flesh

I have to know exactly what
you tell them about me, all the bad things
you say about me
to get them into bed, are they as cruel
as the stories you told me




	Getting Away From It All, 11:00 PM
                a poem by Holly Day

There are faces in the trees tonight again
forced conspiracy of nature and memory
faces of people I can't possibly know faces
of people I can't possibly face.

Concrete slopes, concrete vibrates hard under
my feet the world is a flashback, the world
flashes by houselights go on as angry people
wake up to the roar of my skateboard on their
badly-paved roads.

Someday I'll be strong enough to push past
these feelings, this guilt, the damn trees
push hard enough against these Veriflex
wheels to fly by them all, and not even see.



 
Ok ATI. 
You got me.  What event happened in Oct. 79?  
Reagan was elected a month later no?  But what else???  
What am I stupidly missing.  Fill me in.

    (ed note: see October '88 Playboy for starters. 
    I'll have to drudge up some additional sources 
    by next week, as many will question Playboy's 
    illegitimacy (sic))

...news that Larry Spaghetti is now poet laureate
in S.F. Live long enough, and everything is rewarded 
with a float down the mainstream.

Garth Brook's recording of Bob Dylan's "Make You Feel My Love" went to
6th this week from 3rd last week, and 1st the 6 before that. And this
is the Country Chart!!! 14 weeks on the BillyBored so far. Bob
Dylan has never had a song even make the bottom of Billboard's Country
chart before this. 
   Perhaps singing for the Pope was a good gamble afterall. Lee Atwood
would be proud.

The Person  Still Remotely  Attached to  Capitolism  Says:
             a poem by Prime Anarchist

To do:
Take over Colin Prowell's Little Red Wagon Campaign.
   Yes take over leadership in one swift act.
      Why? 
         Because the man is a fascist. And the last
profound result from a fascist given way too much power 
AND freedom? 
   Volkswagons and dead Jews.
      And I aim to stop half of that.

Breakdown
   by Holly Day

when all your friends have disappeared
and all the flowers have faded to gray
should I still be here for you?   give me a sign
and I'll leave right now.

caretaker of your party mausoleum
I brush away the dust your guests have left behind
a million lovers come and go
I will wait for your touch
as long as it takes.

when the rest of the voices have blossomed white noise
until nobody else will take your abuse
will you let me stay?  just give me a sign
and I'll leave right now.
