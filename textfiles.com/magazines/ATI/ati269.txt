There should be a new journalistic ethic evolving
in the US right now.
  For every question a journalist is required to 
ask George W. Bush, he should jump on the telephone
and call Al Gore asking him the exact same Q

Hello, I'm prime anarchist and this is my rant for
Friday, 03/23/01 - beware the 23's of march. New moon
coming up, eh?
  As someone who remembers seeing the DOW go from 2300
to 2600 I've since maintained that this whole "DOW 10K"
phenomenon is rather false.
  I have another half a headline for you. One that whizzed
right by before I could confirm it. Johnny Cochran joined
McCain/Feingold? Ok, then what Cochran was it?
  Kudos to Chris Dodd, just for saying out loud that we're
going in the wrong direction.
  "And Ecstacy's what you prefer." -- Steve Tyler.
  "I wasn't under every bush or rock." -- Linda Tripp.
Hudson? George? Starr?
  KFC is moving the Grizzlies to Louisville? St. Louis?
New Orleans?? Did anyone get the rest of that? Follow us
up, eh?
  Russia's kicking out just as many spooks as we are this
week, we got some Olympics coming up, huh? Oh, and hey
Boing, looks like we're not in Seattle anymore, Toto.
Onward to Wichita.
  Am I the only one who sees the GOP slap at ABA (not
that I feel too much sympathy 4 people charging 5/min.
for fone calls, 50 cents each for fotocopies, and 7/gal.
for their personal BMW's) as payback for their refusal
to beat the tar out of Clinton when Kenneth Starr asked
them to?
  Yesterday I watched a re-run of "All the President's
Men," and then CSpan coverage of a great Bill Moyer's
speach. Good stuff. Are we still trying to "un-lose"
vietnam? Did we EVER come out of Agnew/Ehrlichman/Haig/
Kissinger/Bush, or did they all just hide down in the
rabbit-hole?
  I think 64% of newscasters are white, male millionaires
in their 30's, and 32% are white female millionaires in 
their 30's.
  Anyone out there who watches more telly than me wish 
to help me prove or disprove? I think I'm close just from
mere observation, eh? There may be some 40's out there 
with toupes and boob-jobs or 20's and/or non-millionaires
with loaned or fronted clothing, but Yikes! Add about 40
years to it all and it looks like Congress in there.
  The whopper and the hershey pie. Chocolate and beef,
together at long last. Or was that short schrift?
  Is WBAI being locked out/up/in just so MSNBC can offer
the Mitch Albom show? Which came first, chicken? egg?
Further, what's the Detroit/NYC connection around General
NBC Electric the past 30 years?
  You know what's wrong today with what I call the money-
christ-cult?
  Lori Beth Graham Bakker. Is she a Bakker?? Or a Graham?
A Lori, or just a hair-do?
  OK, I end this rant with some shorthand notes about the
movie "Almost Famous." I was thinking of doing a review,
but changed my mind.
  "What kind of beer?" The "No More Airplanes Tour."
Man - you don't WANNA know who Penny Lane's character is
patterned on...
  Technical consultants: Peter Frampton, Kelly Curtis.
Wait, I thought he was only doing hair??? I mean that's
what he'd amounted to, the award winning hair guy; 
PFrampton.
  Yeah, that's what I thought. Reg was played by Peter 
F... wait! Again, I thought he was just doing hair. Are 
you trying to tell me something? 
  Wait, she goes to Morocco without him?
  Faruza Balk, ooh la la.

Hello!

I would like to say that I like your page - if I could figure out
what it is. ;)

However I would like to know one thing about your page - at the
top of the page, are some pages listed...why are they there and
what do they have to do with your page?  (because one of the
pages I happen to know and visit on a regular basis.)  It's this
link:

Thanks so much.

You mean, there has NEVER been a DEMOCRAT Recount!!!!
Those fuckin' democrats will lie, cheat, stuff ballot boxes, 
and anything else that is dishonest or illegal to win an
election.  The Republicans are not far behind, but a little
more honest.  Of course, it does not matter the Democrats
made all the rules and counted the damn ballots in the
very beginning!!!!

OPEN LETTUCE 2 CHRIS DODD
  Dear Chris,
  You and all your upper middle class nepotistic colleagues
have always seemed too much like all talk ever since they
added TV cameras into your floor-discussions.
  This morning I've seen McCain/Feingold turn even more 
Orwellian than Hillary's healthcare vision right before ITS
death. Hearing you and Daschle actually point at it is a 
breath of fresh air. Hey Ribicoff. 
  Did Sam from Norwich have to lose before you could start
acting nineteen again, or what???

THE HEM-LINE ROLLERCOASTER

  OK, I peeked at the DOW the other day, two days running
actually. You want the rundown? First my take. Keep George
W off the television. The more stuff comes out of his mouth,
the lower that thing plummets.
  Ready?
+15 10:40am Bush addresses female business leaders. The more
they clap, the lower it goes.

  1 LIL, 2 LIL, 3 LIL SOCCER MOMS.
  by marco

As if in formation they park, first one SUV, then 
another, now a last one.
  Out of each gets a mom and two grade-schoolers.
Daughters? None looking like each other. Adopted?
Rented? What is this, a redo of the Brady Bunch pilot?
  "Quick, everyone on the steps smiling together so we
can get pictures when they open the door."
  Who's this "they," in that quote? It could have been
me. Today it's my co-worker. I felt like I should warn
her since I'd heard it out my window but she was already
answering the door before I could blurt it out.
  She opens the door to the shelter I help run.
  "Hello!" they yell in unison. "Happy Easter," picture,
picture, picture. Flash bulbs everywhere. In broad daylight.
The kids are handing over half a dozen Easter baskets.
  "No thank you," they don't wish to come inside for coffee,
milk or snacks. Nope, just - just hand it over, make duplicate
photos, and get the heck out of there.
