You ever eaten Monkey arm?
  Me either. But I'm told it's quite delisch.
"Once you've made your weapons, of course, you have to
go and do some hunting. It takes three or four darts to
kill a monkey, and even a good hunter will hit with only,
say, one shot in five. Once you wound a monkey, and send
it fleeing for its life along the canopy, you have to
somehow keep your eyes on it while hauling your nine-foot,
five-pound blowgun through more or less impenetrable
forest. When, finally, you do kill the monkey, more
likely than not you'll have to climb into the canopy to
retrieve it."
  -- Joe Kane, author of "Savages" 1995 Knopf

Hi there,
I'm prime anarchist and you're not. Yeah, like that
bugs you, right? Well this is my columnar content
for this weekend. If you don't like it, write your
own and paste it over this one.
  "Nader also shared the stage with former TV talk 
show host Phil Donahue, campaign finance activist 
Granny D and video satirist Michael Moore."
  This is from news reports of Nader at Target
stadium last nite in Minneapolis. Most of it'll
be stuff you already know if you watched a couple
minutes of C-Span in the past 24 hours, but the
Granny D part was new to me, so I'm assuming it may
be new to the rest of us too. Who doesn't remember
Granny D? That nice old lady with cookies bigger
than Maggy Thatchroofer even. And definitely more
intestinal fortitude than Raygun, Bushwack and
BoyBlunder Clinton combined.

  "Dynablob," a JWH album about Bob Dylan.
Hmmm. Peculiar...

  MUENSTER-CHEESE CARD: There Are Some Things Just
Too Phunny To Make Phun Of. Nah... For Everything
Else There's Activist Times, Internet.
PRIVELEGE TO shake Cheney's hand publicly.
 ============= $5000
TICKET TO attend a Nader/LaDuke rally indoors.
 ============= $5
SEEING CLINTON on his way out paraphrasing things
Nader's been saying for 30 years (like "fuel-saving
vehicles and energy efficient buildings and [funding]
clean energy technology)
 ============= PRICELESS.

  "You find something that you love and then you
  twist it and torture it - try to find a way to make
  money at it - spend a lifetime doing that - and at the
  end you can't find a trace of what you started out
  lovin'"
    --Harry Connick Jr as Justin Matisse talking about
      the American Dream in "Hope Floats."


  Aargh - An Opinion - Who's buying my RC now???
  British company Cadbury Schweppes is buying RC Cola.
  Who are the people TriArc bought it from before that?
I guess the first thought crossing my mind was "I'm
just glad it's neither Poke-acola or Cepsi, right? Well, 
every other time RC Cola gets bought or sold, they end
up under someone who's under someone who's under someone
who's under coke or pepsi. This time holds promise.
  For now.

I'm prime anarchist and I typed that.

JUST SO'S U KNOW: A Press Release That Missed Deadline.
  The National Association of Broadcasters is the political
arm of the broadcasting industry. It spends millions every 
year lobbying to keep the airwaves out of the hands of the 
public.

(PAWN) - McGraw and Hill Merge and Make Books.
NASHVILLE, Ten - Tom McGraw Corporation announced a
friendless buyout of Faithful Hall Enterprises, LLC.
  The two entertainment industries will now be in charge
of almost all the publishing of "absolutely everything
paper" in the US, Germany, the Balkans and Indonesia.
  Since McGraw owned Downelly, Random Apartment, and
Hoe before the merger and Hall owned Harcourt Brace, Dell
and Gutenberg, the new "family" will forever be called 
Hall-Downelly-Dell-McGraw-Brace-Random-Apartment-Harcourt-
Jovanovich-Gutenberg - or Haddem Bra Jogger for short.
  "Holy hyphonated kids," said Hall.
  McGraw looked at it a little differently. Since both
CEO's are also singers who call themselves artists, now
when four middle-aged white men write and propose songs
to McGraw or Hall they're basically talking publishing
as well as singing, instrumentation, lunchboxes, t-shirts,
beercanopeners, and using the digital equipment that makes
a flat B-flat into a crisp tonal A-Sharp. not to mention
making the word "me" sound more like the pleasingly
popular "maaaaay."
  "Basically," said McGraw trying desperately to shed his
Indian Outlaw nickname, "You can now hand me a piece of
sheet music, and not only can I fake it a capella on the
spot, but then I can honestly say, 'would you like grayscale
or tri-color with that?'"

LULLABIES OF THE ITCH AND SHAMELESS
  Do you remember those singles in the 70's that included
Dickie Goodman's "Energy Crisis '74?" I don't remember all 
the titles but there were a bunch of 'em. The Crisis one
had Dickie Goodman pretending to be a journalist asking
Nixon questions, and instead of Nixon's voice as a response
you heard "Leave Me Alone," or "Why Can't We Be Friends," 
stuff like that.
  Well, honest to that form - we now here "ask" each of
the 4 (count 'em four) prez candidates to name their fave
childhood lullaby.
  Now, since Alvin Bore already admitted that his mom 
invented the lullaby, we'll leave him out of this one.
Look for that union label somewhere else.
  OK. Ralphie Nader, sing us a beddybye song.
  "I'm gonna wash that man right outa my hair."
  How about you, Mr. George Daddy WarBush. 
"Like a Rhinestoned cowboy, gettin' away w' murder,
and a cokespoon up in my nose."
  And Puke Buchanderdanden? Pat said, "Brit Hume, baby
one more time."
  Wait! Another candidate? Could it be? Stepping up to
the plate is none other than Saddam Hussein, the comeback
kid. Overcoming smartbombs, dumb newscasts, lymph cancer,
and counter-counter-counter-counter-intelligence, he's
stepping up for a swing at presidential politics. Wow.
You've got balls the size of Spaulding (tm)(sic.) sweatshops!
  OK. Hit it. But how'd you get 1,000 signatures in Utah???
  "Old Mother Reagan, and her crew. She took away from,
me and you, I seen her go..."

BIRMINGHAM: Who Says There's No US Holy War?
  Written Sept 15, 2000 

     A               E
(ch) 4 little girls, 4 little girls
D          A
you killed 4 little girls
               E
4 little girls 4 little girls
    D      E        A             [DEA: how poetic!]
you KILLED 4 little girls

 D                A
Did you return to your own church
 D                  A
Did you go back and kiss your own mom
     D                  A
Did you do religion in your hometown
      E           D          A
That sunday when Birmingham burned to the ground

(ch)

Did you think someday you might confess
Could you hide your entire life more or less
We wondered for decades just where you might be
When you killed 4 little girls

(ch)

I'd say the same to Pinochet
Or Bush or Hitler or Saddam Hussein
I've shouted out loud at the Pentagon
And hundreds of churches in the pouring rain

(spoken: you hearda the 10 commandments, right?)

  (this came in just in time for "stop the presses..."

I remember when Carmelle, of the British Coalition 
for E Timor, first introduced me to the problems of 
the E Timorese nation.  And how after, try as we 
"may", we could not get Brian May, guitarist of Queen 
to step out of his shell of industrial privilege, wherein 
he also gloried in local "charitable" success. Years
after his band of neocapitalists had, under S African 
apartheid, taken 5million Queen pounds out of Sun 
City within a week. To add his megastar weight to a 
concert in the UK for E Timor.

One imagines that, apart from a number of hostile
Indonesians and a few generals in Rangoon. It was 
wonderful for the whole world to see marathon runner 
Aquida Amaral, even while, due to Olympian red tape 
that has little to do with the harsh realities of 
international sports and politics. And while not fully 
representing her bravest of nations. Pause, and on 
one Buddhist knee, so often the pose of Christian 
athletes from so many richer and more capitalist 
lands. Send a profound message to a mostly 
unconscious world. Her own grateful thanks for her 
nations long awaited Australian backed "UN freedom".

As one certainly wishes that the UN, for reasons
of its own anti racist and anti heroin credibilities, 
had gone "head to head" with the IOC to oust racist
Burma from the games.  But once the Games 
commenced and the Rangoon junta was allowed to 
compete with a provenly apartheid squad.. One also
hopes that not only Jose Ramos-Horta and Xanana 
are at the party.  For of all long distance runners, 
and after the many tribulations of S Africa and its 
so called sporting life, the continued bravery of 
the oppressed people of E Timor must come, 
historically, next in line.
