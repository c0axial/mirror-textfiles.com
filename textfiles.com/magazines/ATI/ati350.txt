Wow, Greg Palast, here in MKE, at the local Schwartz
books! And he even had the same literary escort Michael 
Moore did. 

I recognized her from one of the movies, but I did make 
the faux pas of asking if she's the one he played that 
evil "get me a soda please?" prank on. 

No! But she knows that woman. She's in Chicago.

So Greg's signing his book "Best Democracy Money Can Buy." 
His lecture about and around the book was thrilling. I 
don't know a better word to use that's not too cliche. 

He didn't have me on the edge of my seat. I was half an 
inch off my seat most of the time bouncing around laughing, 
constantly switching hands trying to cover my mouth while
I laughed so they didn't hear me giggling all the way in 
Kenosha.

Needless to say I didn't journal much while I was listening 
to him talk. So this is going to be for the most part a
long drawn out reflection. 

So, ok. Lemme put my mind on autopilot for a couple minutes 
and type in the journal word for word, and THEN I'll begin 
reflecting again.

Barrick Gold, Poppy Bush, Tanzania.

[ Hanson PLC??? ]

Tan (sp?) Diliseu - expert lawyer.

Roger Alton - His majesty's courts always, 
every time one of his reporters decides to
continue on with a story.

Guardian/Observer is a not for profit.

Barred by law in Britain, barred by cowardice
in the United States.

(from getting stories out)

http://www.gregpalast.com

Cynthia McKinney was the only american "MP" taking up 
Tan Dilieu's case. They fabricated her demand for 
investigation that Bush himself brought on the 911 
attack to ruin her career.

 [wow, serves a couple purposes there...]

[hahahah. no, bush didn't bring on the attack to ruin 
her career, I just noticed that wacky run-on sentence. 
They fabricated to ruin her. (read it twice maybe)]

"Yeah, George W figured that out on his own. 25 out
of 100, don't forget."

--referring to a test Bush took to get into the Air
National Guard where he scored not a 50 f, or a 60 d
but a 25!

Palast is drinking a medium or tall Starbucks, and 
each time he takes a swig he goes "ah," kind of 
demonstratively. I can't talk, I'd just finished
a small starbucks to-go myself. Of course my fair-
trade coffee I'm drinking this moment in a local 
eastside cafe where I type this makes up for it, 
right? And please also note, I did get to drop 
off a couple fair-trade flyers around the Starbucks.

Now, he gave some time to the Khobar Towers.
Remember the 5 or 6 times a guy who just signed his
name "Greg" wrote my anarchist zine asking me to keep 
investigating the towers? No way, was it? I don't dare
ask. I was afraid to find out yes, and afraid to find 
out no, to be honest with you.

I'll leave it at that for now. He might have been
the one. At any rate, that's a hard investigation
but all roads do lead to Howland-Steinbeck, don't
they? Or maybe Filene's bargain basement or something
but I digress.

Back to the journal notes!

a "predjudice." He mentions this a couple times. You
know that one paraphrase --  "don't credit conspiracy
what you can attribute to incompetence?" Well, Palast
adds a third possibility of "predjudice." Go to school
on that one too, when you get a chance. Used the word
"poison" a couple times too.

He pointed out that Schwartzkoff (stormin norman) is
a recent dissenter.

Bode technologies will get the 1Billion for DNA research.
Choice Point runs Bode. Codis is the system that will be
operating. 

It's got a lot to do with DARPA - a lot of Brits seem to
know all about darpa, whereas, most "americans" don't 
have a foggiest.

Syntek genoaII (did I spell those close?)

John Poindexter. Yuck. I've got cottonmouth just typing
Oliver North's sidekick's name there.

BBC, by the way, is allowed to show black people talking
eloquently on television rather than getting spread
eagled over their stolen car beaten down and jailed 
like here in the states.

2 shiny CD ROMS from Katherine Harris' office.

Bill Gates. He blamed Bill for his IBM thinkpad
running out of steam half way through showing
everyone some graphics. I gotta hand it to Palast
though, instead of building a PowerPointPres or
anything, he simply holds up the laptop every
once in a while to show the first 5 or 6 rows
what he's talking about. The rest of us just
have to trust they're seeing what he's telling
us he's seeing. And he's warm and welcoming to
the rest of us too. [every seat's taken by the
way. People in the back standing, galore.]

Thomas Cooper 
Jan 30th 2007. You'll remember that's the year 
he was convicted of a crime that disallowed him
from the 2000 election. You saw right. He committed
that crime way back in 2007.

500 people in the future were convicted of crimes
that disallowed them from voting in Florida.

Professional Services was paid $5000 to develop
a voting machine that would be able to do this.
They failed and got fired. 

Choice Point was paid $2M (yes, two million) to
develop a list that had
BLA
BLA
WHI
BLA
BLA
WHI
BLA

along the far right column. 

Clayton Roberts, KHarris' Republican attack dog.

"You almost saw this on CBS."

Jeb's letter about "disallowing" votes, before
the 2000 elections. They re-released it AFTER
the elections saying "helping" people to vote.

Palast managed to put them right next to each
other in his book.

"Your story doesn't stand up," Rather's people
told him when he called to find out why it got
killed in production. 

They called Jeb's office and they denied it.

[wait, isn't that usually what you just put
at the end of a great story??? "contacted the
office, they denied... etc...]

90% of people coming out of prisons vote democrat.

Commerce Clause.

"If you look in today's edition of the Milwaukee,
uh, paper..."

[ha, he's got about as high a regard for the 
Urinal Sentinel as I do.]

Carlisle developed the Crusader weapon anyhow.

Lockheed.

Britain owned Iraq before and they don't want
it back. They know all about empire building
and they're not interested anymore.

People in Britain are scared to death of Bush.
And Blair is getting there too.

Irwin Stelzer (sp?) he's the link between
Bush and Blair.

[Stelzer's also a higherup for Ruper Murdoch,
much the same way I guess, that Condoleeza
Rice is a higherup for Chevron, eh?]

Jack Straw talks directly to Colin Powell.

Blair talks directly to Bush.

What fascinating protocol.


=============

That's it for journal notes.

I was handed two flyers tonite I'll mention here.

Wednesday 19mar, 7pm is a video nite - also 26mar
at 7pm. at Riverwest, locust street, at fratney.
No charge. 

First topic. War and Forced displacement in colombia.
Fr. William Rickle S.J. Ph.D & Jennifer Bailey J.D.

Ongoing Mondays and Wednesdays. For more info call
Peace Action center. 964-5158

It says "tell a friend - please pass this info on."

So do that.

Oh the other one's that moveon.org no link signature
ad campaign you prolly already know about, so I'll
just give the address. http://www.moveon.org

Wow, so Greg Palast. He was fascinating. An incredibly
fun lecturer. He's friends with Michael Moore too.
Brilliant reporter. He's Bill Moyers with just a 
couple extra canine teeth.

He's also willing to help me further investigate
Hanson PLC and Peabody Coal companies for my
Navajo friends. Turns out he used to have direct
contact with them when Blair was part of the
opposition. He worked in Blair's cabinet back 
then. Talked directly with the people at Hanson.
Says he knows a lot of them. Knows all about the
gold mines in Cavenham Forest, and all the 
implications to Navajo and assorted other indigenous
people all over the world.

I have a small confession to give out here. Palast
makes me proud to call myself an "american."

And that my friend is rare these years.

No, VERY rare.

Beware the leader who bangs the drums of war
in order to whip the citizenry into a patriotic
fervor, for patriotism is indeed a double-edged
sword. It both emboldens the blood, just as it
narrows the mind.... And when the drums of war
have reached a fever pitch and the blood boils with
hate and the mind has closed, the leader will have
no need in seizing the rights of the citizenry.
Rather, the citizenry, infused with fear and
blinded with patriotism, will offer up all of their
rights unto the leader, and gladly so. How do I know?
For this is what I have done. And I am Caesar."

Inside the Sandstone Canyon
  a poem by Nathan C

Dry pinenuts blanket the ground.
The black and white sky is bright and bold.
The silent ruins speak loud.
Ghosts of the canyon will posess my love.
The infrared leaves cast their white shadows
upon the earth.

I can see the grandmothers gathering their
wild herbs in the heat. As a massive Black
and White Beast crawls up the narrow rouvine,
like an animation on an old movie screen.
Its wicked teeth looking for human flesh.
The Grandmothers flee to their cliff homes
leaving the herbs to dream.
Soon, a Monster Slayer Boy appears
from the dust of magical legends
and kills the ancient beast.
He is a brave warrior for his people.

I can see the past-times of
the Anceint Ones
that dwelt in this canyon,
weaving in and out of those
adobe cliff homes, now empty.
These people once made
love in family circles
and drank the creek water down below.
The woman grinded corn right here
taught the little ones, over there!
Old medicine men would pray for rain.

Stories about Long-Ago would circle
around campires in the eve of those
ancient nights. Behold the alter of God
was the sacred Earth and Sky.

Those inhabitants still dwell and live,
just not in tangible form.
I know they still live in
in this shady canyon that echos
the cries of the howling wind.
I feel their prayers and visions.

The infrared sky is black like charcoal,
where the angel white clouds travel.
The blood of the monster is
immersed in the dream.
The trance is all over me.
Great big Cottonwoods catch the wind,
and the great narly branches creak.
My feet are happy, My mind and spirit sing.

Are we ready, clocks? 
It's time for ATI 
(Wartime Edition)!

I read an interview of Graham Nash 
(of Crosby, Stills, And Nash and 
The Hollies) conducted 9/15/01. 

In here, he points out two major things:

that bin Laden was trained by US, and that a lot 
of folks in Afghanistan live lives the same as we 
in the US do: provide for our families, teaching 
their children well (pun intended) and just live 
one day at a time.

Another thing to point out is that not all Muslims 
hate Americans. To be sure, some do. But the vast 
majority don't.

Now what is at stake here in this 'war on terrorism'? 
Our credibility as a nation. Ever hear of the "Marshall 
Plan"? Glad you asked! The Marshall Plan was set up by 
General Marshall after World War II to aid countries
ravaged by the war, including France and Germany. 
It seemed that after World War I, the German economy 
went in the toilet, as the costs of war reparations 
and sanctions took its toll. By the mid-1930's, hyper-
inflation took its toll on a greatly demoralized citizenry, 
and Adolf Hitler was able to take power. If you don't know 
what happened afterwards, please visit your local library 
and get an education. Gen. Marshall indicated that by 
helping war-ravaged populations instead of leaving them 
to fend for themselves, then another Hitler could not
happen. Anyway, there are those who say that countries 
that recieved aid under the Marshall Plan have no business 
criticizing the United States, and should be allied with 
us no matter what the situation.

If this train of thought is allowed to continue, then we 
will no longer be thought of as a generous nation, but as 
one who will expect favors in return for our gifts. The 
tragedy will be that if a poor country needs our help, 
then they will decline our gifts on the perception, real 
or percieved, that there will be strings attached, and 
their population will suffer. When this happens, we will 
be a greatly diminished nation.

OSAMA BIN FORGOTTEN
by David Singely
first appeared in a Milwaukee weekly pape

Why has the man who brought down the towers been
forgotten? The man that President Bush solemnly
promised to "find and bring to justice," is still
loose. Why has Mr. Bush shifted our attention 
away to Iraq, a country that did not attack us?
  Even more puzzling, why did President Bush break
the national ban on flying a few days after Sept.
11 in order to fly 11 members of bin Laden's 
immediate family out of the United States?
  Despite the bin Laden oil family's ties to the
Bush oil family, all the bin Ladens should have
been made to stay within the United States. 
Instead, they were wisked back to Saudi Arabia -
away from us and the 3000 families of the Sept.
11 victims before the bodies were even cold.
  Why was this done? I wonder what the republicans
would say if President Gore had been the one to
break the nationally imposed flight ban to fly
out of the country the family of the world's most
wanted man? Cries of "impeach Gore" and "cover up"
would have deafened our ears, and filled that
liberal media of ours to this day.
  Kenneth Starr would have had no end of things 
to do. It would have made peanuts of his Lewinski 
case, with all of Al Gore's oil connections to
follow hither and yon. Yet, we have no special
investigators, no truth seeking task forces, no
Osama and family, and no questions about it all
from the major "news" networks.
  Alice, pass me the looking glass.

And now, another installment of:
 
\  S I F O D O H ! \
 \ Sitting In Front \
  \ Of Dahmer's Old  \
   \ House.           \

I was thinking of starting a new exercise
program that involves pretending to beat
the crap out of people using various street-
fighting techniques. You could do it in group
formation and have high numbers of repetitions
of each motion for some cardio-vascular work-
outs. Pumped!
  But then I realize there already exists 
such a thing. The all-too-popular Tae-Bo.
  We are so swimming in violence, (totally
immersed) that sometimes it's hard to even 
know you're smothered in testosterone until 
someone calls you on it.
  Why do I point this out? No reason really.
Just hoping people will be a little more
"presente" when someone needs to call THEM 
on it. "That was violent, don't you think."
  "No, really? No way. Really? Wow. Really?
Wow, didn't even think of it."
  How many times have you seen a scene like
that go down in front of you? Far too many 
for my liking. 
  Did you know that small coffee farmers in
Central America receive only 30-60 cents per
pound of coffee?
  "Good judgement comes from experience, and
often experience comes from bad judgement."
  --Rita Mae Brown
And if that one didn't surprise you, check
this one out:
"Those who hate you don't win unless you hate
them, and then you destroy yourself."
  --Richard Milhouse Nixon
"I tremble for my country when I reflect that
God is just."
  --Thomas Jefferson
  
OK. One last new thing I need to ask people to 
be "presente" on is what I call hitlerismo.
  "I'm just doing my job."
  "It's procedure, I can't veer from my little
operations manual here..."
  "Sorry, I can't rethink this. I must follow 
procedure."
  People often think I'm overreacting here, but I
have to say it's only a matter of degree - the 
difference between telling me you can't give me
a refund on a defective product I bought 45 minutes
ago, and telling me you won't allow friends and
family an exemption from entering the neighborhood
concentration camp.
  Am I wrong about the logical conclusions I'm
making here seeing the current path our society 
is taking right now? Open-ended war against an 
unknown enemy? Oppressive inflation? Business 
and labor striking backroom agreements about 
everything from airplane flights to broadway 
plays? Extreme nationalism? 
  We're in deep doo doo.
