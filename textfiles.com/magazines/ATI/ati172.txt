their attention. Screaming their
name out louder and louder still
just won't do it. But we try

There's a new ATI flagword of the week.
If a talking head begins every sentence
with the phrase, "well clearly," it's
definitely scripted and it won't be the
least bit clear. S/he's using those
words to stall 'til the teleprompter
catches up.

Pfizer's got a new product to put on
the market. Ready to be a new guinea
pig again? You remember Visene? 
Viagra? How about Tysene? That was
Pfizer's biggest failure of their
history. They soaked a gazillion bucks
into research as to whether the same
addictive substance used to get the
red out in Visene, might work up
your nose so they could kick
Neo Sinefrin's butt. Well, they
sniffed it but never got a kick.
Tyzene failed miserably. 
   Well, now they're trying Tiagra.
It's a nose spray and a wee-willy
hardener all wrapped up in one. 
Tiagra is made up of the same stuff
that Visene and Viagra are made up
of. 100% corporate sleaze. The only
difference in each product is the
amounts of water. Try some in a 
parlour or pharmacy near you.
   If you don't get clear sinuses
and a big willy right away, all your
money back.

Hi Marc,
I checked out your web site. 
I laughed, I cried. I think 
I mostly did the latter. 
Good job.
  I don't know why I decided 
to do Lovin' You at alt.guitar.tab. 
I think it was because of the ultra 
high notes that Minnie Riperton sang. 
It reminded me of early Mariah Carey. 
Its irritating but fascinating at
the same time.
-=MarkAlbert=-

thanks for the e-m.  an ego booster 
to be sure.  also liked the zines
especially the "copyleft" concept.  
i'll use it in future.  may i submit
contributions?
take care, 
saji

Hope this is to your liking...

"Sometimes I Sleep"
(You heard our cries; you knew 
we were in trouble and abused.
Deuteronomy 26:7b)

Sometimes I sleep on my silence and never cry,
sometimes I  wink at the wonder in the atmosphere,
sometimes I pan fool’s gold from the coldwater faucet,
sometimes I eat meatloaf unmannerly without thanking.

sometimes I look at the pink stars in the latte sky
without wonder
without a sigh
and leave my lattice where it leans in easy slumber

sometimes I thresh the grain without joy for rain,
sometimes I cash my check and pocket the cash
leaving the ATM to the next Friday slave
(i remember my PIN number but not my Maker)

sometimes I look at the burnedhole memories
in my roof with
the lost ceiling tiles
and forget the covering of newdawn that
reflected off the dead ashes like diamond dust
and replaced mourning with reflections of day

You brought me here...
past the terror...
past humiliation...
through the loss like a tunnel of smoke,
and terrified the terror,
humbled the humiliation
and wrapped up grief in the spearhole
in Your side

So I bring my bestcrops before You,
I lay my through-the-wringer life at Your hands
and laugh
and cry
and shout Thanks
till the mountains and the stars echo back
and remind me not to sleep in silence
when You answer my troubled sigh

You answered my troubled sigh.

Mark,
I enjoy your ezine. 
Very entertaining.
  I thought you might get 
a kick out of this spam 
(edited for brevity). Note
item #4 on how they "get the 
cleanest email addresses available 
anywhere."
Apparently the only way to get off 
those lists is to become a "terrorist"
or "anti-internet advertising 
extremist."
Keep up the good work,
Jim

MUSIC REVIEW
     by the Prime Anarchist

I think Jonathan Richman was the last 
good show I saw here at Concert Cafe.
That was what, end of last summer?
Have I been crawling through the 
desert without a horse that long?
"Water, water..." 
    Going without good music is 
like eating at Taco Bell. The flavor
is almost present, but your body 
can't taste a thing. Or a bigmac.
   Consume 10 of them, have you eaten 
anything yet? No flavor, no taste -
no nutrients. Unlike watching the 
Hansen Family Three, or Alanis 
Hootiefish, seeing a local indie show
is like eating at a real restaurant -
Seeing Hansonfish Hootiesette is the
bigmac or a gordita.
   Well, Little Blue Crunch Things and
LBC at an indie show is even better,
like having a farmer hand you some 
food (NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH STERILE
MONSANTO FOODSTUFF!) and cooking it up
yourself.
       You know you're in for a "really
big shoe" tonite when the same Jonathan
Richman crowd is there. You walk in and
look for your place to stand and 
maybe rage.
    Let me tell you a little bit about
Wisconsin people. If we like something
we throw all our support behind it and
we just about do it in formation. Not
formally assigned seats, but close, eh?
    There was a lot of dancing going on
in the first four rows, come to think
of it there was a lot of raging back by
where the soundman does his thing too.
Even over where you buy CD's and 
T-Shirts you got some pogo happening
over there.
    I'm going to talk most about LBCT's
bass player and the awesome singer. 
I don't remember any names, so that's 
their nicknames for now. Bass Player 
was Geezer Butler meets Stanley Clarke.
During the last song, which was a long
all-out wailfest, Player's laying down
this blistering wah-wah heavy metal
rock-on "call & response" stuff that
Awesome Singer's copying note for note
on beat box.
     Two things give away that Singer
plays an additional instrument to voice:
1) How lyrical the lyrics are, and how
rhythmic his chants and rants are; and
2) The sax-strap around his neck.
Yes, Singer's an awesome front man in
the traditional band leader sense, and
he's also excellent at improvising solos
on the sax. There are two sax players
soloing throughout a LBCT gig, him and
one other. Makes for a pretty solid 
wall of sound out of this group.
    Lucky Boys Confusion call themselves
reggae-punk-hop. Yeah, I heard all that
and a whole lot more. It's like Dred
Zeppelin meets Jello Biafra and Woodie
Guthrie in an Alliance Teleconfrence
call and sing all the songs they've
each written lately for a megaton
collaboration.
    Wow. They played a lot of stuff
from their new CD, Growing Out of It.
I'm sure this'll change soon, but my
favorite song so far is called 40/80.
    The band consists of Kaustubh
(call him Stubhy if you can't pronounce
it right) Pandar, lead vocals; Ryan
Fergus, drums; Adam Krier, Rhythm Guitar,
vocals; Jason Shullejan, Bass; and Joe
Sill, the lead guitarist.
    Best go to their website and hear
a couple songs and if you don't sign
their guestbook I'm going to be bummed.
LBCT brought LBC here from Chicago for
the first time. 
They BETTER come back.
Soon. 
Often.

Subject: shared opinion? (fwd)
to ati by marco.
A woman who met Jackson Browne backstage
once and still has a crush on him, put
"Lives In The Balance" lyrics up saying
they fit the war we just started. So here's
what I responded with.
/\/\ /\ /^ < ()

-=-=-=-=-

Yes, beautiful women who have crushes
on Jackson Browne. I agree he's a 
very profound songwriter.
The rest I can't really agree OR 
disagree on, I've never seen him 
backstage. Darryl Hannah still 
professes he's a very beautiful man, 
despite a breakup many years ago.

Here's another song with 
same sentiment, that I find
quite "in place" at the moment.
I sing it in Em, but this is the
Pearl Jam version, which knocked
me off my socks when I saw Bob
Dylan's birthday party. I really
wish I could have been there; but
they don't let me in Radio City
Music Hall very often. 
   When I was 5 I tore up three 
velvet seats and scratched a run
in one of the Rockettes' nylons,
and I don't think they've yet
forgiven me.

Am                   Am Am7 Am
Come you masters of war
Am                      Am Am7 Am
You that build the big guns
Am                      Am 7 Am
You that build the death planes
Am                        Am Am7 Am
You that build all the bombs

Am                     Am Am7 Am
You that hide behind walls
Am                      Am Am7 Am
You that hide behind desks
Am     C           G          F    AmAm7 Am
I just want you to know I can see through your masks

You that never have done nothin' 
but build to destroy
You play with my world 
like it's your little toy
You put a gun in my hand 
then you hide from my eyes
Then you turn and run farther 
when the fast bullets fly

Like Judas of old 
you lie and deceive
A world war can't be won, 
and you want me to believe
But I see through your eyes 
and I see through your brain
Like I see through the water 
that runs down my drain

You that fasten all the triggers 
for the others to fire
Then you sit back and watch 
while the death count gets higher
You that hide in your mansions 
while the young people's blood
Flows out of their bodies 
and gets buried in the mud

You've thrown the worst fear 
that can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children 
into the world
For threatening my baby, 
unborn and unnamed
You ain't worth the blood 
that runs in your veins

How much do I know 
to talk out of turn
You might say that I'm young, 
you might say I'm unlearned
But there's one thing I know, 
though I'm younger than you
Even Jesus would never 
forgive what you do
 
Let me ask you one question:  
is your money that good?
Will it buy you forgiveness?  
Do you think that it could?
I think you will find 
when your death takes its toll
All the money you made 
will n'er buy back your soul

And I hope that you die 
and your death will come soon
I'll follow your casket 
through the pale afternoon
And I'll watch while you're 
lowered into your death bed
I'll stand over your grave 
till I'm sure that you're dead


    ----<><><><>----




Need Parity? Try a Parody.

Your love is like a Beetle
Cost me too much
Your soul is like a blind date
Where you're both going dutch
When I check my checkbook yo
I know that it's true
God must have spent 
His last thirty cent 's'on you.

GUITAR ANARCHY TIP # 9 
I heard a Christopher Parkening 
version of Jesu Joy of Man's Desiring
that was different from the 
"Parkening Plays Bach" album I've
got. 
  The NPR station I have access to
at work played it today. Good God!
It's the most inspired thing I've 
ever heard out of a guitar's sound-
hole. Or a human's soul for that
matter. Where can I find it?
  Please tell me there's only 2
Parkening interpretations on 
"vinyl" so I can find it quickly,
eh? Becuase I won't want to buy
any others. I may just never buy
guitar recordings again if I ever
get my hands on that one.
  Wow!

and now, A MICHAEL MOORE MOMENT...
   I just watched my 8th, (count
'em eight) movie where a sub-theme
is that a hacker finds a company
that rounds down a quarter of a
penny times however many transactions
are made and s/he diverts it into 
their private account.
   Well, instead of attacking two
rather obvious flaws in this 
wonderful thrilling adventurous
tall-tale I'll make an off the 
wall suggestion that is more in the
"social engineering" department 
than the "hack/phreak" dept.
   Hmmm. Is there a story title
there? I can see it now. "SOCIAL
ENGINEER: Hacker With Attitude."
   Anywho... has anyone thought
about just walking up to their
boss and saying, "you know boss,
I'm aware that your accounting
prog just leaves a bunch of money
behind that doesn't go to anyone.
Do you think rather than breaking
the law I could just ask you to
get permission to divert it 
right there into my account?"
That way you don't have to do
something nasty, and they don't
have to arrest you!
   Yeah, how many times has 
someone caught someone stealing
and said, "you know, if you'd'a
just asked..."
   Go phind out if they really
mean it!
