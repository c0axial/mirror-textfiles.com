Tourists and Terrorists: Giuliani 2000
By Robert Lederman
reprinted by prime anarchist world news [PAWN]

According to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani Times Square on New
Year’s Eve is the safest place to be in all of New York City
with midtown Manhattan locked down like a giant maximum
security Federal penitentiary.

Aptly named project Archangel, Mayor Darksides’ ominous
security plans include having his imperial troops, eight
thousand uniformed cops, stand guard duty in Times Square
backed up by hundreds of FBI agents, private security guards
and operatives from other Federal agencies. The remainder of
the City’s 40,000 uniformed police officers will take time out
from their Christmas assignment of rounding up and arresting
homeless families to diligently search the subway tunnels and
streets of New York City for potential terrorists and Giuliani
critics.

Roofs in Times Square will be manned by crack teams of
police snipers with night vision scopes mounted on their
high-powered rifles. Every parked car in a mile long three
block wide strip of midtown will be towed to prevent the
deployment of car bombs. The party-going public will be
herded cattle-like through an endless maze of police barricades
and metal detectors and treated to body searches in below zero
temperatures. Many attendees are expected to be arrested on
the way to the event simply for possessing alcohol, a substance
zero-tolerance Giuliani believes often leads to terroristic
anti-social acts such as dancing, solicitation of prostitutes and
public urination.

Manhole covers will be welded shut. Mailboxes will be sealed.
Every garbage can in midtown will be removed. Hundreds of
undercover police officers will be circulating through the
partying crowd disguised as tourists. As they do in Washington
Square Park with marijuana sales officers will run sting
operations, in this case offering to sell high school kids
everything they need to make their own New Year’s bomb and
then busting them as "terrorists". For the past few weeks the
NYPD has been bribing hundreds of informants in order to get
them to report threatening comments they’ve overheard from
drunks bragging in neighborhood bars or the thinly-veiled
threats of community activists.

Are the enormous expenses of this event and it’s
unprecedented and ultimately futile security precautions worth
the economic and social cost to the taxpayers of New York
City? This is not a Presidential inauguration, the signing of an
international peace treaty or anything of genuine public value
that justifies either the cost or the risks involved. This once
stirring celebration of diversity and democracy has been
reduced to nothing more than a slick ad for Disney, the Times
Square Business Improvement District and the Giuliani for
U.S. Senate campaign.

Watching the ball drop on New Year’s Eve was once an
authentic celebration by actual New Yorkers who traveled by
subway from ethnic neighborhoods in all five boroughs. They
came to share a collective experience in the center of a real
city. Giuliani’s ersatz "party" is closer to Hitler’s 1937
Olympics celebration than the New Year’s event which became
a symbolic celebration of freedom renowned throughout the
world.

Giuliani isn’t celebrating a New Year so much as his cleansing
of New Yorkers and authentic New York culture from Times
Square. The hotdog stands, shoeshine parlors, peep shows,
all-night movie theaters, hookers, hustlers and gritty texture of
a flesh and blood city have been replaced by a sterilized
Mickey Mouse mall every square inch of which has been
tagged with mind-boggling fluorescent graffiti.  This corporate
freakshow on steroids is prowled by an army of black
uniformed cops whose sole mission is to protect tourists from
low income New Yorkers and to uphold the real estate values
of Giuliani’s top contributors.

Aside from terrorists, virtually all of the two million
participants expected to be in Times Square this New Years
Eve will be tourists. No sane New Yorker would venture
anywhere near midtown as Giuliani pulls the lever on his
Police State 2000.

The idea that Adolf Giuliani’s army of poorly trained and
underpaid cops, who are known to despise Furhrer Giuliani,
can somehow prevent a genuine attack by determined terrorists
is ludicrous. Not even the real Hitler with his real Gestapo was
able to prevent acts by determined terrorists. If actual terrorists
wanted to make a big splash in Times Square they could have
securely planted their bombs or gas canisters months ago.

Then what’s the point of Project Archangel, Lucifer-Giuliani’s
aptly named contingency plan to thwart a terrorist attack? Like
the event itself the security arrangements are nothing more than
an advertisement for Emperor Giuliani and the police state he
hopes to usher in for the new millennium.

Ironically, the biggest threat to the tourist throngs in Times
Square will probably be the NYPD itself, which Giuli-anus is
fond of calling, "the most restrained police force in the U.S."
Here’s the likeliest disaster scenario. While peering through a
defective nightscope obtained from a supplier/contributor
linked to the Giuliani administration a police sniper on the 30th
floor of a Times Square office building thinks he’s seeing a
drunken tourist make a threatening move, perhaps only
flipping Giuliani the bird. With no time to do anything but act,
he takes the poor sucker out. In a domino effect hundreds of
panicy cops on the street misinterpret the police sniper fire
Diallo style and begin blasting back. After thousands of rounds
of newly distributed exploding bullets are expended and the
Square is littered with dead and wounded tourists,
Commissioner Safir and Hollowpoint Giuliani will cite
"contagious fire", the same explanation they gave for how four
cops fired 41 times at unarmed West African immigrant
Amadou Diallo last February.

The most cost-effective thing a government can do to reduce
the threat of terrorism is to stop pissing off so many people. To
be anything more than an insane act of meaningless violence
politically-motivated terrorism depends on grievances that are
popularly understood and commonly agreed with.

Even though Mayor Giuliani has no influence whatsoever on
foreign policy, the Giuliani administration inordinately fears
terrorists because it specializes in oppressing people. Vast
numbers of those who live in New York City now feel
victimized by the Mayor and his circle of thugs. Like a mob
boss that expects to be cut down at any moment Giuliani is
paranoid because he knows better than anyone the multitude of
people who have a legitimate grievance against him. He went
so far as to invent bogus warnings from the FBI that City Hall
was in imminent danger from terrorists in order to restrict
access to New Yorkers. These imaginary warnings were later
publicly denied by the FBI itself.

We do face a real terrorist threat in New York City but it’s not
from fundamentalists in turbans or bible belt militias. The main
suspect resides in Gracie Mansion, has a taxpayer funded office
in City Hall and lately hides out in his high-tech bunker in the
World Trade Center.  He depicts himself as an advocate of law
and order while actually being the biggest lawbreaker in the
entire City. While mouthing platitudes about the glories of
liberty and free speech and the dignity of work, he uses 680
lawyers to subvert the Constitution, is an outright enemy of
anyone’s free speech but his own and has a view of work
closer to a WWII forced labor camp than an actual job.

As the ball drops in Times Square on New Year’s Eve let’s
hope we will be seeing the final curtain call in the career of
Mayor Rudy Crueliani. If not, we may be seeing the opening
act in what is sure to be the police state future the Malathion
Madman foreshadowed in his most infamous quote:

"Freedom is not a concept in which people can do anything
they want, be anything they can be. Freedom is about authority.
Freedom is about the willingness of every single human being
to cede to lawful authority a great deal of discretion about what
you do and how you do it." Mayor Giuliani, New York
Times, March 17, 1994.

Have a Happy and safe New Year and do yourself a favor by
staying far away from Fooliani’s nightmarish party in Times
Square.

..& now, here's Cygnus with the news.

Snakeskin, Utah -Dec 27,1999 -As the eve of the arguable new Millenium
approaches, millions around the globe prepare for what could be the
biggest celebration in recorded history. But for Church of Eternal
Truth and Life, a different celebration is looming, with completely
different preparations to be considered. They are preparing to meet
their maker, and if needed give him a little hand in the process.
But worries are apparent in Church Leaders. Nationwide stockpiles
of some of the most common items instrumental in committing suicide
are at a historical all time low.

Year 2000 has profound psychological significance to many around this
world. Most are concerned about the dreaded "Y2K" scenarios where
computers will become fouled up, leading to the overnight demolishment
of society and moral fiber which could lead to an unrecoverable collapse
of civilization globally. However to some it marks the return to earth
of Jesus, a popular religious figure and former Pro Wrestling star.
Some fear that because Jesus recently celebrated his birthday that he
may be too tired and hungover to make an appearance on Jan 1, 2000 so
they have planned to meet him halfway.

The National Institute for Mental Health confirmed Monday that some
early cases of celebration have had to resort to braided dental floss
in order to accomplish their goals. Throughout the year the longtime
devoted have purchased the means to make this holy journey. With
preferred suicide techniques such as head trauma caused by handguns,
hanging by rope, asphyxiation, and drug overdose unavailable to the
recently converted, some have suggested new and exciting ways to
welcome Jesus back to his old stomping grounds. Immolation is one
that comes up frequently. As Rev Jonas Pearson of The Church of
the Eternal Truth and Life points out "Materials that are needed
are available just about everywhere. And what better way of showing
your devotion to Jesus than to be one of his Shining Stars in the
night showing him the way to start his new reign on Earth??"

All of this preparation is not all cloaked in gloom, as Squibb
(Maker of the popular sedative Phenobarbital) and Kraft General Foods
(maker of Jello brand pudding) announced on Monday higher than
anticipated earnings for this year.

According to Spokesman Jim McNeilly at Squibb "phenobarb is
selling faster than Champagne and Viagra put together."

Bill Cosby, longtime outspoken advocate of Jello Pudding refused
to comment on the situation and then suddenly said "kids love Jello,
Pudding, yum. And it goes great with anything."

  President guts Boys and Girls Clubs - Gives It New Name
          By Turtle Neck.
  Special to Prime Anarchist World Newz.
     In a recent act of legislation Bill Clinton has made Boys And Girls Clubs
  "offlimits" to boys. He also enacted a name change to just Girls Clubs of
  America.
     "There's plenty of stuff to keep boys occupied these days," Said Clinton
  in today's full court press conference at Madison Rhombuss Garden. We need
  a club where girls can hang out. You know, work their way up to page or
  maybe intern."
     He said each girl will get her own seperate room, with all kinds of things
  in it at Government expense. Sort of a place to hang out, or hide, or invite
  the President. Whatever suits their whim. Boys will now have to move over
  to the Boy Scouts, Elks, the local congressional chapter of NAMBLA or maybe
  their regional FFA club.
     When asked how she felt about it, second lady Hillary took a moment from
  her busy New York stuff to say, "it all just makes me feel young again."
