Yeah right. I was going to make this issue
"superspam III." But instead (and you'll 
thank me I'm sure) I chose to just re-refer
you to issue 94 of ATI. The one dubbed SuperSpam.
  Is it me or has spam all of a sudden gotten
more far-reaching and persistant this month?

PUBLISHERS COLUMN IN THE FORM OF A RANT

Everyone wants to do something to help
Everyone wants to do something big
Everyone wants something permanent
  profound
  beautiful
  Sublime
Everyone wants to do something cathartic
  popular
  unique.

But does anyone want to do all of this 
in one act???

Visit a victim.
Say nothing.
Do nothing.
Just be present.
Does anyone want to do that???

Sincerely,
Prime Anarchist

OPEN LETTER TO A SPAMMER

That was very clever how you tried to get our
heightened attention by starting all this with 
the message, "your email didn't have the attachment,
it was empty," as if there might be something we can 
do by what, resending? Resending what?? Nothing to 
send. Pretend all you want, but I never sent you
anything. 
  I can only begin to feel sorry for you because you 
probably paid good money to acquire a list of emails
that for some reason I can never figure out:

includes me as a potential buyer/sucker/victim/ or mark.


I wonder if there's any psychiatrists out there at Brandeis
or wherever else designing masters theses about how 
much thought process must go into spamming people
you will probably never know.

Linguists ought to get involved too, seeing how
a brand new tongue is evolving over all this.

Heck, if I use teen, school, girl, and tell you that
my shirt size is just between L and XL and that
if you send me XXX clothing it will be too big for
me to wear.


Woops, runon sentence -- if I use words like that
suddenly my writings climb up the search engines
faster than something that really was well thought 
out and well written, huh?

Anyhow, a little more than a decade I went and 
simplified my life so rather than making more money,
I buy less things, and I take good care of what I have
and put the time and education into repairing everything
rather than adding to landfill.

I only mention this to you because since this is all the
case, 

THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN SEND ME THAT I WOULD
BE INTERESTED IN.

Anyhow, remove me or don't remove me. I don't care.
It's your dime, and your karma. I've got a delete finger.
Yes I assigned an actual finger to it because I get so
much in this email address the last few weeks.

Oh well. Take me off your list if that will help your
karma. Otherwise keep sending me stuff that I delete
about as soon as I get it.

This is the last real reply you'll get from me probably.
In fact I'm actually writing this for others more than 
for you. I'm devoting some space in my magazine 
to this email as well.

Cheers,
marco

Who remembers the Iced-Tea commercial right after,
was it the Quebec anti-globalism demonstrations? 
I think so. Might have been right after Gothberg. 
Something like that. Anyhew, I was one of oh so many
who were offended by the ad's theft of the entire
"activism" theme to sell something. Just like it 
was quite offensive to see a myth built around Martin 
Luther King's speech from the Lincoln monument implying 
that if it weren't for Cingular or AOHell or someone, 
no one would be able to hear him. To sell what, internet 
service? And the GAP using the anarchy symbol and 
graffiti'd windows to try and sell jeans and accessories.
Yuck.
  Well I found something this past weekend that makes 
these look downright tame in comparison -- mere kudos, 
or shouts and greets or something than the abusive 
usurption they are. 
  You might want to sit down for this one.
  I was watching 5 minutes of Nickelodeon's "Nick
At Nite" show while I ate a cheese, garlic and ketchup
sandwich on homemade wheatbread. That's the channel that
came on when I powered the TV up, and I was GOING to surf 
to somewhere else of course while I ate before going out
to see some jazz band at my favorite local coffeeshop.
  Did I see and hear right? Holy wah!!! I'm not making
this up. Here's what offended me so.
  A song I'll describe later which was the opening 
theme song to this show, which stars a home-boy about
my age who joins half a dozen or so little white 10 or
11 year old kids on a trip to a candy factory. Kind of
Mister Rogersish. You know, you get to watch all the 
machinery go and the viewing pubic gets to go "ooh," 
and "ah." OK so he's in some grocery store and he's
wearing a black or blue bandana on his head. Normal
street clothes. He's mad because all the foods are
low-fat, and sugar-free. He asks a couple of the kids
who all seem to be shopping alone. "What's with all
this stuff without sugar?" "Are you as mad as me?"
"Aw, c'mon, look at this, sugar-free chocolate. How
can you have chocolate without sugar???" All the kids
follow him to the outside of the store and he's got
them all lined up -- these little roundheaded chubby
little white preteen boys and girls, there's nine or 
ten of them gather up now and he's yelling "what do 
we want?" and they're yelling, "Sugar!" "When do we 
want it?" "Now!!!"
  I swear, I'm not making this up. I didn't do any
channel surfing, just hung on this one because I could
NOT believe my eyes or ears. 
  Here's the kicker. If this doesn't just piss you the
heck off, I don't know what would. There's some serious
outrage over here. Can you feel it?
  The introductory theme song went as follows:
  
AIN' NO NIGGA 
LIKE A NIGGA WID
A SODA
CAUSE A NAGGA WID
A SODA ______

I couldn't make out the rest because the music was
being faded into the show.

NO! I really, really, really wish I had made this up.
This is for real. I'm all over usenet and google trying
to verify this somehow. I don't even know who to call 
on the phone yet.

QUICK LOOK AT
WWW.SALON.COM
=============
I was reading the following Merle Kessler passage
while listening to Patty Smith's "People Have The 
Power." The segue to Paul McCartney's "Freedom" 
was quite anticlimactic, I should say. As were the
next half a dozen Salon articles I surfed around to. 

 I-Zone and "Got Milk?" had partnered up in that 
 irritating new- economy way. They had a booth in 
 which you could be photographed next to a life-
 sized poster of a milk-mustached Britney. You were 
 provided with a milk mustache of your own: a piece 
 of white tape. Walking by, I noticed half a dozen 
 or so unclaimed photographs lying on a table.

HOW DO PEOPLE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD 
SEE US (AMERICANS OF THE U.S. KIND)

Here is a quote from Maulana Abul Kalam Azad,
friend and coworker of Gandhiji and Jawaharlal Nehru.

 I am still convinced that there was no justification 
 for the use of atom bombs on Japan without previous 
 warning. It was a weapon which completely destroyed 
  not only military forces but the civil population 
   and harmed even unborn generations. In fact, it 
  threatened the destruction of man. When, in WWI, 
 the Germans had used poison gas against the Allies, 
 world opinion condemned them in unqualified terms.
 If the Germans had then been guilty of inhumanity, 
  how could one absolve the Americans of the same 
   charge? I felt that the use of the atom bombs 
   exceeded the limits of permissible destrution 
  and did not redound the prestige or heroism of 
  the Allies. I also noted with regret that the 
 Allies hailed this event as a magnificent victory 
     and there was hardly one word of protest.

Shall we end with a poem by Jose de Gouveia?
Almost. Let's.

Subject: Computer Virus Warning

Virus, virus on my hard drive
of my PC with '98 windows
a whole lot of gateways to a soul
infected and infecting
spreading like a cancer
killing my memory of many
long lost and deleted objects
for I too have seen the best
gigabytes of my generation destroyed
by yet another hackers madness as I
shove an aspirin into my disk drive
and double click on Dr. Watson's menu

As the online porn queens moan and groan
RealAudio sound bytes of virtual MichaelAngelo...

Because the information highway ends not
by the blow of a silent horn but the zap
of an opened folder as a new Y2K
era is upon us I'm not sure if
mutations of newly adapted technology
will heal all in some sort of Virtual Second Coming
or kill us all in the rougher electronic slouchings
of a much meaner holographic beast

The computer monitor awaits
with RealVideo and WebTV
just click here for free access
its not 2000 but 1984
much different from grade school
when being hooked on phoenics
felt so much different than
hooked on the internet

I'm with you Bill Gates in the starkness of a new millenium
with you as our on-line Savior with mouse in hand -
awaiting your crucifixion!

I'm with you Bill Gates in the sunny skyless cloudscapes
gleaming super-nova whiteness upon your capitalistic
blandness!

I'm with you Bill Gates in the blue glare of white
flashing screens with no savers in chat rooms and
forums and newsgroups and websites and, and, and...
The New World Order's Age of Reason?

Because the world truly ends with
some sort of sound and whether it be
a bang or a whimper will never be noticed
in the internet zone where I swallow yet
another anti-virus somewhere in Norton

Wasting away again in Cyberspaceville...

While conforming to the net's political correctness
of kind words in chat rooms, sensitive electronic
mutabilities and safe on-line sex at an URL
linked to my homepage wondering if the

Computer has the virus
or do I..

Reprinted from his website at:
http://www.geocities.com/bostonpoet2000/poets/November/gouveia.html


And we double-end this zine with a Michael Moore quote 
from his book "Stupid White Men."

 What I am concerned with is why
 politicians like Senators Joe
 Lieberman of Connecticut and Herbert
 Kohl of Wisconsin want to go after
 MTV when they are the ones responsible
 for the massive failure of American
 education.



feedback?
