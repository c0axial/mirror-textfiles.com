SPECIAL PRE-WAR RETURNS COVERAGE.

Welcome to another ATI, live from Normal, ILL.
We might as well just call it the new "war-again" issue. 
How many has it been? Yikes. (was thinking about dubbing 
it "Midnight Oil." but nah...)

Before our masthead, we give you this:

Steven Funk, "LCCW's Student of the Year."

Steven Funk, a Life West junior intern, was selected by 
the Alumni Association as LCCW's "1996 Student of the 
Year," based on his solid academic standings and the 
numerous contributions he has made to the community, 
chiropractic profession, and the college.
  Steven has previously been given awards for "Chiropractic 
Excellence," and a "Certificate of Merit" from Life West's 
Student Council.
  Steven is an active member and organizer of several campus 
organizations, including the Christian Chiropractic Club, 
which he founded and served as president for four quarters. 
He is also a non-commissioned officer in the California Air 
National Guard, which involves serving 100 days a year. He 
has been a reservist for almost nine years and is stationed

 ANALYSIS  -  THIS  WAR  IS 

NOTHING BUT AN OLD FASHIONED COST OVERRUN

Publisher's Column by marco

Iraq War Will Last Longer = Cost OverRun

Washington - War in Iraq will last longer and 
cost more than they had initially expected.

Are the American people this stupid? We are 
being Sikorski'd. Enron'd, General Dy'd.

Weren't we told it would be over in a day or
two? two weeks max?? Didn't they say 10 or 20 
billion dollars or so? Weren't they only going 
to make a regime change and force the people 
behind Hussein to comply with everything that 
a democratically elected Hussein wouldn't, and 
then get out immediately?

Here we go again.

It happens every couple decades, and we fall for 
it every single time. Now that they're in, they're
asking for a 75 Billion dollar downpayment. And to 
top it off they're saying it's going to take a 
considerable amount of time before there's any 
kind of end in sight.

And now that they're fully inserted, the draft-dodging
warhawks are gambling there isn't a damned thing you 
can do about it, by way of complaining or blocking.

This sounds like a cost overrun to me. And the people
doing it smack reekingly of a mafia or a klan. Pirates
or racketeers.

Maybe we're in this mess because we didn't fully
prosecute the Enron thugs. Or perhaps because we
didn't oust Renquist for appointing Bush. But I
have a feeling it goes back farther than this.

It's probably because we allowed Ford to pardon
Nixon, rather than insisting on going through with
articles of impeachment. 

And lastly, it's because we didn't listen to 
Smedley Butler and Dwight Eisenhower when we 
had the chance. 

SHOULD HAVE.

Well, I have a horrible warning to give here, speaking
as someone who served in the army signal corps for three
years, and worked for people from Kuwait, Saudia Arabia
AND Iraq when GTE agreed to let THOSE soldiers train us 
on phones and radios.

It took 12 years to weaken the Iraqi people to the point
where our state department thought for sure one little
war would kill them off. But they underestimate not only
the military, but the people around them. It will take
only one or two battles to fully empower every soldier 
who isn't killed in the next week or two.

We're going to have years of war in that region now, 
and we're going to lose an awful lot of men and women
between the ages 17 and 23 before we find some way of
saving face pulling out of there with our tails up our
asses.

We've already lost the peace, now we're engaged in losing
the war. Isn't that a little backwards? Well no one said
George W Bush was a straight up kind of human. And he's
certainly not a straight up kind of leader OR puppet.

In fact, isn't he the most misunderestimated, more gooder,
subliminible, nuke-u-lar cowboy we've ever had rammed down
our throats?

I don't mean this as aid and comfort to the enemy. And 
I'm sorry it's going to be taken that way. It's a scolding
of the american people. We suck.

We didn't have to, you know.

PT Barnum was right. 

There are liberals and conservatives born every minute.

THE WORLD IS AT WAR
What Are You Doing about It?

Johann Christoph Arnold

As Baghdad becomes the focus of a fierce war that is gathering 
momentum every day, many around the world are  fearing the worst. 
Just in the last few days, American and British troops have 
experienced serious setbacks,  and unexpected casualties and 
deaths. Even President Bush looked unusually grave as he warned 
the nation (on  March 23) that "this is just the beginning of a 
tough fight."

But fear is the worst emotion we can give into at this time, 
for it is the greatest divider. Fear divides  people from one 
another, and from God. It paralyzes people and drives them over 
the edge. But fear doesn't  have to do all these things. It can 
also drive us to each other in the certainty that we can do 
something about this war. And I am not talking about peace marches...

I have great respect for every person who has recently attended 
a vigil, protest march, or peace rally. I  myself have participated 
in dozens over the last four decades. But I am also concerned about 
the tensions, the divisiveness, and even open violence that is 
sometimes a part of these gatherings.

Yes, war is wrong; yes, killing is wrong. I will never waver from 
that. At the crucifixion of Jesus, after  one of his disciples struck 
off the ear of a soldier, Jesus told him to put away his weapon, 
saying, "He  that takes the sword shall perish by the sword." Jesus 
was clearly no advocate of armed force. But neither  did he condemn 
those who used it-even against him. On the contrary, he prayed for 
them, "Father, forgive  them, for they know not what they do."

How timely Christ's words are for us who claim to follow him! He spoke 
them as a sinless man. What about us,  who contribute to war in so many 
ways, every day of our lives-with our greed and materialism, our 
backbiting and gossip, our unfaithfulness and family feuds, our 
arrogance, our general selfishness and our disregard  for others? 
How do we stand before God, we who stand on the sidelines and 
condemn those who have planned  this war, and those who are now 
fighting it?

The war in Iraq calls each of us who oppose it to make a choice. We can 
criticize the White House and the  Pentagon. We can antagonize those we 
disagree with. We can rub salt into the wounds of families who have  lost 
loved ones (or who fear losing them). We can look on soldiers and sailors 
and airmen as evil-doers.

Or we can show them love, as we have never shown love before. We can listen 
to those who are angry with us.  We can encourage those who are hurt or 
bitter. We can take time for the children around us. Many of them  will 
go to bed tonight with the images of a war that is thousands of miles 
away, but still scares and  confuses them. And we can support the troops 
on both sides of the battle by praying for their safe return,  and for 
a speedy end to hostilities.

By "supporting the troops" I am not talking about waving flags, or calling 
them home and hoping they'll get  over their nightmares. (As someone who 
has counseled veterans of every major war in the last century,  including 
both World Wars, the Korean and Vietnam Wars, and Gulf War I, I have 
learned that no soldier ever "gets over" a war.) I am talking about 
recognizing them for what they really are: the beloved parents, spouses, 
children, brothers, and sisters of families no different from yours and 
mine. Regardless of the choices they once made, which have since landed 
them in the Iraqi desert, they are now cogs in a huge  machine. They are 
leaves in a massive whirlpool of violence that began turning with Cain 
and Abel, and has never stopped since.

Who will support these men and women once the last shot has been fired, 
and they start showing up in AA  meetings and emergency rooms, psych 
wards and funeral homes? At the moment, there's plenty of talk about  
heroism and sacrifice, God and country. But what's going to happen 
once the war is over, and everyone has  moved on to the next big 
thing on the screen? Who's going to be there for "our boys in the 
Gulf" when they  start turning their weapons on themselves?

The time is past when one can simply be "for" or "against" war. 
And as this particular one rages on, each of  us has surely felt 
drawn into it somehow. Only a heart of stone could stand aside. 
In my church community  (the Bruderhof), we have been drawn into 
it through prayer. Senseless as all this violence is, we believe  
that God must have some reason for allowing it to happen. And so, 
just as we pray for peace, we pray for his  will to be done as 
well-even as it remains a mystery to us.

God is a God of judgment, but he is also a God of endless love. 
He is a father, and he sent his only son "not  to condemn the 
world, but to save it." He has a plan for each person who dies 
in this terrible conflict,  from the American paratrooper to 
the Iraqi sniper and the British marine-and all the civilians 
caught in  between. And we believe that every one of them will 
one day end up in his arms. Who knows how powerfully he  is 
already at work amid all the horror? Surely he is there right 
now, waiting and watching; leading (or  holding back); chastising, 
but also comforting and giving courage.

I have never experienced combat, but as a New Yorker who experienced 
9/11 (I lost a friend in the collapse of  the Twin Towers) I know 
what war looks like. Now, as then, I  believe that in the final 
moments of  loneliness and anguish, the dying are not alone. 
Jesus is there with his angels, ready to receive them. He  
knows what it means to be in the "shadow of the valley of 
death." (What else is the Euphrates these days, if  not that?) 
And he will see to it that no one walks through it alone.

Two thousand years ago, Jesus said, "Blessed are the peacemakers, 
for they shall be called the sons of God."  He also said that 
though his harvest is great, the workers are few. As the war 
in Iraq continues, let  us remember his words-and let us be 
worthy peacemakers worthy of his blessing. As we continue to 
work for  end to the violence, let us (to quote Gandhi), be 
the change that we wish to see in the world. Let us not  
condemn any man or woman, or say or do anything that spreads 
division or fear. Let us rather do what we can  to sow seeds 
of peace. And let us never give up hoping in the One who said, 
"Lo, I am with you to the end of  the age." He promises a new 
heaven and new earth for all people, one where every tear shall 
be dried.

by marco

(ch) Your deeds will follow you down
Your deeds will follow you down
Everybody knows except for you and your troops
Your deeds will follow you down

You can live by the sword
And you die just the same
But when you put it all down you get back your life
Not to mention all of that fame

(ch)

You can lead a troop to water
But sometimes you can't make him war
Oftentimes you just get bit in the ass
Like 30, 40 years before.


It is written a youth shall lead you
But not into battle this night
She'll bring you right out of this living hell
As if you never knew what's right.


You can bomb yourself to pieces
But you can't bomb your way to peace
And freedom's not about bombs at all
Or an economic increase.



Warbler Bros. eliminates image from 'What a Girl Does' ads

LOS ANGELES (PAWN) - Print advertisements for the teen comedy 
"What a Girl Does" originally featured a photograph of star 
Amanda Brines wearing a Guernica reprint on her T-shirt and 
flashing the peace sign with her fingers as she stands between 
two Nazi members of parliament.
  With the war in planet earth sparking anti-war protests in 
the Untied States and abroad, however, Warbler Bros. quickly 
changed the ad. The studio said Monday it feared the peace 
sign would be viewed as a political message.
  New versions of the image feature Brines with her right hand 
at her side, although many of the original posters had already 
been placed on billboards and buses before the change was made.
  In the film, Brines plays an American girl who discovers her 
estranged father is Adolf Hitler. 
  "What a Girl Does" is set for release on Friday.
