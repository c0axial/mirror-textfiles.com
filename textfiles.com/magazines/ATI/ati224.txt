SPRING a poem by Ellie Schoenfeld
from her book ISBN: 1-886895-13-9

Earth laughs in flowers
but it takes a long time
for her to crack a smile around here.
And I, desperate for a joke
after nine years of winter,
finally spy a corner of grass and soil,
tangible evidence
of the possibility of Spring.
I want to grab the dirt, 
rub handfuls onto my skin,
fill myself in
grow flowers from every oriface.

Dedication: Ben, Rachel, Tag, Jerry, CJ, Beth, Mike

Hiya,
It's Sunday nite. The other day my friend Shelly
and I drove six and a half hours to see a folksinger
named Dar Williams perform a benefit concert. You
ever heard of her? My friend Melanie turned me on
to her music about a year ago when we were sharing
each others' inspirations. Wilco, Dar, stuff like
that for her...Roger Miller, Pete Seeger, Melanie,
Joan Baez, stuff like that for me. But I'd never
seen her live before. If you get a chance you owe
it to yourself. You owe it to humanity. Go see her.
I have to say her show was worth every mile! I 
think my fave songs so far are "The Babysitter's
Here," and "When I Was a Boy." "If I Wrote You"
was pretty good too, and there's a brand new one
she's working on that pokes fun of Yoko Ono (she 
deserves it!) was great too.
  And now, it's Tori Spelling for Cardio Kung Fu.
What's next. Taco Bell with the big badass, fat
burning gazpacho burritoburger???!?!?!?!
  Aparthood Alert: Should you happen to see a black
man running something, find out who's the white man
who owns the place, (or basically him, huh?) 
  That's how far we've come.
  In all these years.
  That's all of how far we've come.
  OK, I've got a couple poems for you, then some ATI
stuff, you know, #'s, Lettuce, the usual PAWN stuff,
and then we end with reprint of a poem I collected
on the road. U R N 4 tr8s.

WASHINGTON - How quickly will we rationalize and justify Jonny Chung?
  Today China became important enough to Washington's national security
that it feels safe to thumb Taiwan, tackle Tibet and export terror
throughout both hemispheres.
  We are proliferating one thing and it is NOT peace.
  Mark my words, Bubba. We are in for a world of hurt.

EAST ROOM - White House. Be afraid. Be very afraid.
  George Bush and John McCain seeking summit today serves perfect
metaphor for Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China.
  Madeline Halfbright announces Clinton, Carter, Ford, Kissinger et al,
with not a black man or woman in the house. Tuesday, May 9, and
all is as it seems. Al Gore recognizes Warren Christopher, Al Haig, Brent
Skocroft, Zbignew Brznski, Admiral Craft, and Jesse Ventura.
  Where's Mick Jagger?
  Carter recognized everyone, including Kissinger, EXCEPT Albright!
Telling. Not a black man in the house. And only the token woman or
three.
  How does one refute six presidents and two secretaries of state? If
they told you to kill Christ, you would, wouldn't you? Or wouldn't you?
  "Co operative relations with China is in the best interest of the United
States," says Dr. Henry "Death" Kissinger, to mad applause from pink faced,
greasy, fat, primerib-stuffed heads.  Best interest of the who? Of the who??
  AT LEAST BE HONEST, YOU NAZI PUKE!
  Peace and progress in Asia? Who the flakjacket are you fooling? Prepare
for terror, oppression and anarchy of the sort that is NOT good.
  This is NOT good news.
  Final metaphor:
  A morphine, heroin speedball is going to kill you, you know that; but it's
going to feel sooooooooooooo good.
  Look deeper than the happy fleshy crust, Bubba. Look under the surface
and be afraid.
  Be very afraid.

ON THE ROAD SOME MORE
  by Aaron Kreider (Continued from last issue.)
   [If you wanna read the whole thing
       as one long t-phile goto:
http://www.etext.org/Zines/ASCII/ATI/trilogy]


When I wasn't really expecting it, possibly going through my bag for
something or other, I got a ride from a young guy in a car going across
most of North Dakota.  He was on his way from South Dakota up to Williston
(about a ten hour or so drive) to take up a position as a Youth Minister.
He'd become a Christian about three years ago and that's why he picked me
up.  He was easy to talk to since he was my age and we could discuss
religion and like subjects.  I was the third hitch-hiker he'd ever
picked-up.  He offered me some food and I ate of his good oatmeal (somehow
it was moist! - I was travelling on dry oat meal, chocolate chip cookies,
nuts, and dried fruit).  I refused to share his ham-sandwich which he
almost didn't eat when he found out I was a vegetarian (!!!), but then I
assured him that I wouldn't be offended and when he found out I didn't eat
cheese, eggs, milk, etc - he justified it to himself.  I originally thought
I should get off in Bismarck, as that would have been a good place to get a
ride if I had to stand at an entrance to the inter-state - but as we missed
the truck stop turn-off (there was meant to be one on the west side of the
town), I decided to go the extra 90-some miles to Dickinson with him.  We
almost ran out of gas (about half-way into the empty zone) somewhere before
Dickinson.  Some of the exits had 'no services'.  We were in the boons.
The countryside was pretty boring.  Mostly range country with some cows.
Very rural and not too much traffic.

In conversation we actually agreed on the general idea that the Bible
implied Christians should work for social justice.  He believed in all of
the Bible so we disagreed on some things and discussed (mildly arguing)
homosexuality for a while.  He had a very newly found girlfriend who was
studying in South Dakota - and by moving to work they were going to be
separated by quite a bit.  At 4:23pm I was by Dickinson at N 46 53.785  W
102 47.740.  Dickinson was the boonies!   Not completely but getting there.
 I walked out onto the turnpike to get a ride (before I had always
hitch-hiked at entrances as hitch-hiking on the turnpike in many states is
illegal).  There were rains coming from the west and you could see the dark
clouds (and possibly even the rains) in the distance.  After maybe half an
hour or so, I got a ride.  It was a short one but well worth it as we drove
through the rains which could have surprised me (it would have taken me ten
minutes to get to shelter).  The person who picked me up was a local.  We
talked mostly about the geography as I began to admire the countryside
particularly as we entered the Little Missouri National Grassland and
Theodore Roosevelt National Park.  There were nice buttes - or whatever
they are called.  Saw some wild buffalo and horses.  Unfortunately he only
took me 37 miles and dropped me off in the middle of the park, where I just
missed a friend of his who would have picked me up (he saw him drive by).
At 5:21pm I arrived near Medora at N 46 55.895 W 103 33.412 hopped a fence
and walked around for an hour or so.  At 5:58 I sat on top of a hill, the
highest for a couple miles.  At N 46 55.981  W 103 33.613 around 2600 ft
(though my altitude meter fluctuated from 2450-2800).  I ate some food,
drank a little water, and wrote my cousin Kara a letter (she was in
Abidjan, Ivory Coast) as some dark rain clouds approached but fortunately
missed me as they headed north.  I climbed down the hill, walking and
clambering down a gully.  Because it was a gully and it had recently
rained, it was muddy and I got dirt in my shoes and shoes stuck a little in
the mud.  A little bit after getting to the bottom, by the side of the
turnpike it began to rain.  Then the rain mixed with pea sized hail.  I
crouched down and covered myself and my backpack with my jacket as there
was absolutely no cover around.  My ten-year old jacket got very wet in the
process though I mostly stayed dry.  I was rather thirsty so I ate a little
hail (it was nice and cool and good and I was running pretty low on water).
 I then tried to hitch.  Visibility and the shoulder were good, but the
traffic sucked.  I waited over two hours without anyone stopping!
Eventually it got too dark so I stopped trying.  I tried to walk a bit,
thinking I might be able to find a place with a bathroom and some water -
but eventually (after 2 or 3 miles) gave up on that as it was pretty tiring
and around 11:13 p.m. camped on top of a nearby hill (not the tallest one)
at N 46 56.215   W 103 35.736.

I slept pretty well, cocooning in my sleeping bag which was adequately
warm.  The ground was a little lumpy, but it was ok.  It also became very
windy in the wee hours of the morning (and I was on the top of a hill -
which was probably pretty stupid) and I feared that rain was on the way!
But it wasn't.  It probably went down to the 40s.

"SAY IT AIN'T SO: Transcript of DC'S Police Chief brutalizing someone.
CNN footage from A16 demonstrations. Typed in by Marc Frucht.

A grey-haired caucasian patrolman pushes a young woman aside.
Walkie Talkie in hand, Police Chief Ramsey approaches.
Puts radio in his left pocket. (not sure jacket or pants from
the camera angle) Ramsey grabs the young woman the minute she
gets up off the ground from being pushed by the other patrolman.
  Ramsey's right hand is on her left shoulder. He grabs her hair
with his left hand, turns her around and throws her to the ground.
She gets up, he grabs her with both hands again. Lunges at her
throat with his right hand, left hand around the back of her
head and his left leg behind her legs, he grabs her left breast
with his right hand.
Ramsey wrestles her to the ground, not letting go of her breast until
she struggles away behind a journalist in the way of the camera.
  Ramsey slides her along the pavement back into site but now he's
facing away from the camera, hunched over her flat on her back.
  He takes what appears to be either three punches or pulls of her
hair, comes up with her bandana in his hands, ripped right off of
her head.
  Demonstratively, Ramsey throws it on the ground at her as she's
getting back up to try and run back into the crowd away from the
violence.
  DC Police Chief Ramsey pulls his walkie talkie back out of his
pocket and smiles as he talks through very heavy breathing.


PRESS RELEASE
Tue, 09 May 2000 22:35:50 -0400 
  GRAFFITI AT AUCTION
GUERNSEY'S TO CONDUCT FIRST MAJOR SALE
FOCUSED ON THE HISTORY OF UNIQUE URBAN ART FORM

The Graffiti art movement was spawned in New York City in the late
1960's, spread throughout the world and remains a vital genre displayed
in museums and discussed on the pages of leading pop cultural
publications universally. Interestingly, there has never been a major
auction devoted to Graffiti and related urban arts... until now! The
first true auction reflecting on the hip hop generation and inner city
culture will be held on June 14th and 15th at NYC's Puck Building.
Guernsey's will be presenting a comprehensive auction of hundreds of
lots of paintings, drawings, sculpture and constructions, photography
and ephemeral materials (piece books, movie art, etc.) reflecting on the
last thirty years of Graffiti. The renowned Bronx Museum of the Arts is
involved with the project and will be benefiting from a gala preview
held in its honor. In an effort to have the auction match the excitement
of the art, many of the lots will be sold without a minimum reserve.

212-744-3638; email to guernseysny@aol.com.

CHECK YOUR FORKS: For Tube Failure Or Chipped Teeth.
WASHINGTON -- Two companies are recalling about 31,000 bicycle
suspension forks because they can break apart from bicycles, causing
riders to lose control and fall. About a dozen people have already been
injured. 
  Answer Products Inc. is recalling about 17,500 BMX and mountain
bicycle forks because the tube that attaches the fork to the bicycle
can fail, the CPS Commission said Tuesday. 
  Answer Products has received six reports of forks failing, resulting
in two people suffering minor injuries such as cuts, bruises and
chipped teeth. 
  Because of similar problems, By Us International Co. of Taiwan is
recalling about 13,500 Ballistic front suspension forks installed on
certain Brunswick mountain bicycles. 
  By Us and Brunswick received 18 reports of forks on these bicycles
breaking apart resulting in nine riders suffering serious head and bodily
injuries, abrasions, bruises and chipped teeth.

SISYPHUS' CAMPAIGN: If We're Lucky, Maybe Sisyphus
Will Bring Us Something Like This Each and Every Week
  by Sisyphus

My campaign this year is:  "Stay Out Of The Sun!  There's NO
OZONE Up There This Year!"  This is true and can be checked.
Do you want links?  It's in NASA-JPL somewhere.
  There has been damned little media mention of this, so you
watch; this fall, there'll be a rash of reportage on the rising
rates of melanoma in the general populace.
  (Hmmmmmm.... I wonder, I wonder if there'll be a difference in
incidence rates that can be linked to skin color. Stands to reason
there would be, it's the ultra-violet colours that are not being
filtered out.)  And the light looks different.  The yellow is still
there, but there's this hard-edged bluish stuff about.
  Stay Out Of The Sun.  Serious.  All of the northern hemisphere
this year. People in Russia and Northern Europe have the same problem.

      -=Mine Canary=-
a metaforic prose poem by marco

  Did you get the "canary in the mine"
Metaphor when your favorite rock star sang it?
When your fave fictionist wrote it?
When your closest candidate closed with it?
I'll admit I didn't get it at first. Not
Until after Fasttrac passed, after Viagra,
Allegra, Long after Reagan AND Rogaine,
& even prilosec - that purple phascist pill.
  And of course long after Bechtel and Occidental.
  If you must know, I'll say I finally entered the
Myth while reading Marilyn Chin. Long after fat
Free fat and Cortizone.
  I'm a half-dead canary, as I look at the zinc
and copper mine so far away from my life now, I
can take my consolation in the knowing.
  That I can say.
  At the very least.
  Still I'm half alive.

FLUSHING FLUSHING FLUSHING ALL ACROSS AMERICA
  another poem by Ellie Schoenfeld
[ Same book: Screaming Red Gladiolus! ]

...our toilet is really a drag because every time you flush
it the little chain that connects the handle to the plunger
falls off and you have to reach your hand way down into the
tank, way down into the freezing cold water and reconnect 
everything and while I'm reaching and reconnecting I think 
about millions of other people flushing their shit into a
lake and about fish choking on all that shit and about places
where people don't have enough water even to drink and here
we are flushing flushing flushing all across America while
the aquifers are running dry and there is talk of piping water
from Lake Superior to Texas and by the time I have everything
reconnected my fingers are numb from the cold...
