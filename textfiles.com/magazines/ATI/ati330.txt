Woah, network troubles everywhere. You'd think it was the millenium
change or something. 
  Three servers were down to me the past week or so, including one
with a shell so a goodly portion of my mail dumped. And it wasn't 
bouncing so most people didn't know I was losing what they'd just sent, 
yikes. That's a lot of downage. A record maybe. 
  Anyone else out there noticing as much trouble this past week? Maybe 
the worst since right after Enron tanked, eh? Or the time when AOL
slash-n-burned...
  Well, just as it was all going back up, my favorite, and most
robust and stable server took half a dive. http://www.etext.org was down
for a while... almost a full week. You could get to all the pages, but
you couldn't update or add to any. So the first point of receiving new 
ATI's (and most notably the newest - 329) was absent from last Sundayish
'til just now, Saturdayish, Fridayish. Yuck. In 6 years I've seen it
down maybe 15 minutes at a time twice total or so. Oh well, that's
how it goes I guess. 
  We were down, but not out. 
  Well, as promised, here's two new sections. 1) Sitting In Front Of 
Dahmer's Old House each week, and 2) MY LITTLE LAPTOP III in 
3-D. That's right. I'm typing this moment on a brand-new-to-me, adopted
Extensa 510 laptop. It's got just under a gig in HD, 16 in RAM and 
win95. I'll play around a while before putting in freeBSD or mandrake 
or anything eh? Especially because it's ver 4 which I've never 
worked with before. It seems a little better than ver. b or the 
original which I've nursed along manytimes. And now that all the
servers and etc., are working fine, guess what happens right here???
I've got 7 dial-up adapters loaded into this thing and I still can't
get it online. Oh well, no hurry there. I'll use the desktop for that.
Maybe instead of a better modem, I'll save up for a network card, eh?

  That's what I hate about Word (TM).

  You know what I hate the most about Word (TM)? It makes no sense. 2.0
was o.k. I can't speak for 3-5 but 6 sux0red bigtime. And the one with
Office 97? Yuck. Big trucking yuck. Hate it, hate it hate it. No, 
there's not a new one since that's worth even 8 bits. So you're still 
wondering what I hate the most. I'll give you an example to give 
yourself. Write 10K or so into notepad, or edit or something. Paste it 
into your late model of Word (TM.) Now, save it. See what I mean? You 
don't? OK I'll describe it. A dir read shows it as 16K or so. Now, save
it to C: and also save the same exact file to A: One's about 16K and
the other's 14 or 18K, huh? Yikes.
  Now forget that for a second. Type about 1700 words into Word (TM)
How much K does THAT take up? About 14K. FOURTEEN THOUSAND CHARACTERS
TO STORE UP ABOUT EIGHT THOUSAND CHARACTERS?
  WTF??? DOES .DOC STAND FOR DOCUMENT OR dOS-ENCRYPTED-WASTE-OF-TIME-AND-
SPACE-CONTINUEUM-oVERLOAD-cODE??? What a pain. And you thought Word Perfect 
was kludgie??? Yikes. Wait'll .NET finishes trying to take over the world.
  Wow, there's a hand hammered steel shield about 25" in diameter with a
brass centerpiece and it's on the wall above the coffeemaker in this
Chicago Swedish restaurant and I can't stop looking at it. 
  But I digress. Those two columns await us, and I noticed at midweek that
many issues have come and gone without bringing you our favorite feature
column, GATT. Guitar Anarchist Tips and Tactics. So let's start with that
and onto everything else.

////      \\\\
\\\\ GATT ////
  \\\\  ////

f. Guitar anarchy. What can I say? They go 2gether like ramalama and ding
l. dong. Like Art and Garfunkle, I mean art galleries and cheese; or oil
a. and vinegar. 
m.   Yeah, so why? 
i.   Who knows.
n.   I do, sort of. Guitar just gets in your head better. From Phil Ochs
g. to Andres Segovia; Joan Baez to Billy Bragg. You say something with a
.. guitar behind it, and people listen for an extra millisecond. And that
l. makes all the diff- 
i.   Try it for yourself.
p.   Next coffeeshop you're in, turn to someone and say, "George W Bush
s. really friggin' sucks because he stole the election and now he's taking
!. us to war every Christmas."
     See how many (or few) people take note. How many reply, how many shrug
   or react in ANY way.

   Now try the following.

G        Em
George W Bush

C        Am    D
Really friggin sucks

         G                Em
Cause he stole the last election

             C      Am
And now he's taking us

    D          G
To war every Christmas.



   See what I mean?

I wonder what she thought 
As she stood there, strong and tall
She couldn't turn away 
She was forced to watch it all

Did she long to offer comfort
As her country bled?
With her arm forever frozen
High above her head.

She could not shield her eyes 
She could not hide her face
She just stared across the water
Keeping freedom's pace

The smell of smoke and terror
Somehow reduced her size
So small within the harbor
But still we recognized

How dignified and beautiful
On a day so many died
I wonder what she thought
And I know inside she cried.

SITTING IN FRONT OF DAHMER'S OLD HOUSE

I contemplate non-violence. I think about why
it's so important right this very moment. I
think about visioning out conflict resolution.
  Wow, what a place to ponder these things.
I think of cemetary grass, and other grasses
all growing where Dahmer's house used to be.
I think about the big high fence around the
grasses, and the old garbage bags and beer
bottles that blew their way into the grass.
What else is in there? Feelings, vibrations,
smells, noises, I'm sure. But I haven't been
here in the quiet yet. Each time there's still
a buzz. Someday it'll be quiet enough to feel
all that. Then I can seek what I'm finding here.
  Yes, you heard me right. Seek what I'm finding.
I already found it, that's why I keep coming here.
I'm seeking what I found elsewhere in this town.
In the center of canibalism, pedofilia, violence,
death and destruction, there sits something very
American. Something criminal while confusing; insane
yet sensible, something so gruesome, but at the same 
time so very very sublime. 
  It's where we come from and where we're going. 
Do you have the courage to go here? I don't but
I keep trying anyways. Whenever I feel just a
little bit of courageous energy, I go here, and 
then I skate right away skittish the moment I feel 
the fear. It's so tribal, yet so icky. How can that 
be? There is a dance here. I can see it. I cannot
hear or feel it yet but I can see it. In the wind,
when the grass blows back and forth, gentle but
rough at the same time. A wind that can blow you
away, or could carry you home.
  This is some of what Dahmer left behind, and 
what none of us have ever been ready to discuss.
  This column is about all this and none of it at
the same time. It will grow into something that
will hopefully help anyone trying to study violence.
  Timothy McVeigh, Unabomber, George W. Bush, the
DC Sniper, Madeline Albright, Saddam Hussein, Jeff 
Dahmer, the WTC pilots, Harvard and Yale University. 
Besides skulls, what are these people all trying to 
tell the world?

  [ed note: this feature was conceived just a
   few weeks ago - shortly after a Milwaukee man 
   was beaten to death by children ages 10-14 here 
   in Milwaukee. Vigils began out in front of the 
   house where the beating happened. Candles and 
   prayer. Ummm. About 10 blocks walking distance 
   from Dahmer's house? Perhaps an even more 
   fitting memorial would be a weekly midnite walk
   from that house to Dahmer's; while addressing
   issues of nonviolence. Are we ready for that?
   How many decades?? ]

x  Pumped up my front tire this a.m. 
-  It was all the way flat. I'm wondering if it'll
m  hold air now while I'm coffeeshoppin' or not. It
a  held up for the whole ride. (14 minutes all out, 
s  how many miles is that? check someday...) We'll
   see.
i    If it's what I think - it's the weirdest most
n  unexplainable phenomenon in the world. 

t   [ed note: 3 days later - YUP, what you thought.]
h
e    Once or twice a year in the spring and fall, I 
   lose all the air in a car, bike or motorscooter 
g  tire. I've confirmed all three over the years. 
u  And Conn, Colo, Wisc all confirmed too.
l    Is it the temperature and barometric pressure
f  maybe? Does it rise or fall just right and make
   a tire porous for a few minutes and then back to
a  normal right away? No idea. That's my only guess.
g  I've asked many different people in many different
a  cities and states, from many different countries 
i  and cities and that's the best any of them could
n  come up with. So that's MY guess too.

OK. This is about all for ATI330.TXT. I'll leave you with this

               Wars and rumors of war
               Oil and rumors of oil
               
               I've got a girl for you tonite,
               I tell Dennis Rodman;
               After the game,
               You know
               You and her...
               "Is she UGGGGGLY?" is his
               Only question -
               For beauty, is an asset.
               Can be measured, manipulated manhandled
               & capitalized upon.

               Mr. Speaker, I say, Mr. Prez, Mrs. Prez:
               I yield my thyme and beg to reserve
               It back just long enough to 
               Tell you about a 
               New small country.
               Looking for democracy, freedom,
               Help from US, advisors, politicians,
               Maybe help to someday grow big and
               S T R O N G
               Through open, American monitored
               Elections.

               Are they oil-less, you ask me.
               They ask me, she asks me.
               Mrs. Speaker, for oil is an asset.
               Can be sized, sounded for, measured,
               Sucked, raped and capitalized upon.

               'Cause if she ugggggly---
               Won' give her my time no how.

               For if they LACK oil,
               We're JUS' nah INTRIST'D.

               Oil
               And rumors
               Of oil.
