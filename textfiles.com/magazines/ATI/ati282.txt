Source: FBI Missing Children
by Roland Hesse PAWN Writer
WASHINGTON (PAWN)-- Three boys good at song and dance, and some 
audio editing equipment are missing from the FBI, a source with 
knowledge of the situation told the PAWN Tuesday.
  Attorney General John Ashcroft was expected to confirm the
missing children late Tuesday. The youths that are missing are 
Zach, Taylor and Isaac, said a source who described the problem 
on condition of no one saying she's their mom. 
  "They were right there on the tourbus where I left them last,"
this source said. The equipment missing is mostly microphones, 
along with some digital sampling devices and a mix-down unit, 
the source said.
  The Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday will hold oversight
hearings on the FBI, and questions about the missing youths are
expected to come up at that time.

Statement from Corbin Harney, Western Shoshone 
Elder & Spiritual Leader:   (07/13)
I would say that I'm making a statement against what 
the tribal government, the Bureau of Indian Affairs 
have done to the Indian people. This is something that 
we have done for thousands of years before you people 
have made a law. This is something in our tradition, 
this is the way that we, the people survived for probably 
a million years on this earth of ours because that's working 
with the nature. The nature is providing us with all kinds 
of healing from different kinds of sickness.

Then you people have come along and interrupted our traditional 
  way of life.This is what we are going to have to do from now 
  on and before you people would really understand you should 
  be understanding our ways because the law came upon this part 
  of the continent not too many years ago and you took it upon 
  yourself to interrupt our way of life.
Our way of life is very important, just like your life but I 
  wish you people would never interfere in our ceremonies, our
  spiritual ceremonies because this is the way we have healed 
  each other and we are going to have to continue. This is the 
  way our forefathers have taught us, this is what the nature 
  have taught them, not only as a human but all the living 
  things that provide us with all the nature way of life. I 
  hope you understand that you are doing the wrong thing by 
  interfering in our ways. We, the nature people have never 
  interfered with your religion, never have and never will 
  cause that's your way of life, so leave the people alone. 
 
  This is a sad thing that you people have been doing since 
1492. You have put this against us and this is something that 
we don't want to deal with. We have never harassed your people 
in your way of life, that's your religious way of life so I 
would say this is the way it's going to have to be. I hope 
you understand   what you're doing and what I'm trying to 
say to you.

A SPECIAL ATI SONG

You don't know where you met me and you don't know why
You musta mixed me up with some other guy
I make up all these songs as I go along
And people like Unkle Krakka come and steal my songs

Singin,

Follow me and everything is alright
I'll be the one to tuck you in at night
And if you wanna leave I can guarantee
You won't find no body else like me.

When I wrote there was no heroin
And no talk of infidelity from married women
No words about veins, or fish in the sea
Or anything about the ring you wear for me.

(repeat chorus 2 or 3 times)

YOU CAN JAIL THE RESISTER: BUT 
YOU'LL NEVER JAIL THE RESISTANCE

Jay Hughes of the Associated Press published 
a story today entitled "88-Year-Old Nun Begins 
Prison Term" that my favorite "cyber-utne" 
Commondreams.org picked up as one of their
headlines.
  I thought I'd put a couple excerpts to it
here and give a link to it. Even better than
the story is the work Commondreams has done 
along the right column of it which they call
"Also See:"
  There's a bunch of links to other related
stories.
  OK, so Dorothy Hennessey arrived Tuesday at 
the minimum-security Pekin Federal Prison Camp 
along with her sister Gwen Hennessey, 68, also 
a nun from Dubuque, Iowa.
  The sisters were among 26 protesters convicted 
of trespassing during a November protest in which 
some 3,400 people crossed onto the Army base 
without permission. Only those who had been 
arrested for trespassing before but not prosecuted 
were sentenced to prison.
  
OK, that last statement was true, but only half
true. Associated Press fails my Journalism 101
class this first session of summerschool because
they didn't do the extra work to find clarity and
balance.
  The 26 were picked from among about 100 "second
timers" within the group of about 3400 who risked 
arrest by crossing the line entering onto Fort
Benning to protest the SOA. 

Picture of the 26? See:
http://www.soaw.org/Articles/current%2520info/new/soa_26_indicted.html
They seem to have picked these 26 rather arbitrarily.
At least no one in "the movement" can figure out any
rhyme or reason to it. Some were from a group of 
direct action puppeteers who knew they had a fairly
high risk of arrest. They marched the wrong way 
walking most of the time "in through the out road,"
perhaps terrifying the MP's and police given overtime
that day to try and "handle" the protest. Others were 
in the wide body of marchers crossing the line. Some
were singled out right away, others were "found out"
during the long "arrest-processing" that followed the
action, where clearly obvious attempts at disrupting
traditional "jail solidarity" was being conducted.
Besides the direct action people, the others prosecuted
really were only guilty of being on a list of people
who had been prosecuted the last year.
  While waiting for our captured comrades to be returned
to us that night last November I heard it said by one
of the earliest released that it felt more like what
she'd imagined Pinochet's Chile to be not Clinton's
transfer of power to Bush in the Untied States of 
the Americas.

At any rate: the AP story can be found at:

Enjoy your travels through all those other links too
if you get the chance.

An American soldier in a hospital explained how 
he was wounded: He said, "I was told that the 
way to tell a hostile Vietnamese from a friendly
Vietnamese was to shout 'To hell with Ho Chi Minh!' 
If he shoots, he's unfriendly. So I saw this dude 
and yelled 'To hell with Ho Chi Minh!' and he yelled 
back, 'To hell with President Johnson!' We were 
shaking hands when a truck hit us."
