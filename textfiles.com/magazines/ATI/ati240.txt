Hi I'm Prime23 and it's Friday nite. I don't really have
much of a column this weekend. A quote or two maybe
and a poem I've pulled out of thin air. Let's just say
I don't have much of a publishorial or editorial
opinion 2nite. Well I do, but I'll keep that schtuff
to myself for now...

Boyee, it's hot out. When will August end? Certainly not
in September, eh?

If you ask ME, KatsKan is a pretty good band. Not great,
just pretty good. You probably have no idea what I'm
talking about huh? Read on, it gets worse.

OK here's a quote I noticed. Or a notice I quoted. I don't
remember. But I do remember the phollowing:

 "If 1992 was about enlightenment, then we're in the dark
 ages now."
   --Jeff Ayeroff, founder of MTV's "Rock The Vote," non-
   profit corporation. Despite their dog and pony show, less
   than 20% of 18-24 year olds will vote in '00 just the same
   as what happened in 96, 92 and 88.

OK I have a quick book review and I'm out of here. And I mean
real quick.

  ANOTHER SHORT BOOK REVIEW
    Arianna Huffington's "How To Overthrow The Government"
  is what you'd get when you simply remove all things violent
  from the Unabomber's Manifesto.
    My fave quote so far?
  Honestly, I'm only on page 91 of 317.
  Perhaps "The Statue of Liberty should be turned around
  to face this country."

You know, I read in the NYTimes today where ALL the indians did not
profit from the legalization of gambling Casinos.  You could look it
up or...anyway, it compared the Mohegans & Pequots to the Pima Apache 
and some other tribes out there, and they just aren't the same.
  Never were.
  But the real answer to the inequities in income/benefit to The
Tribes is to empower them in some other way.  A different
Enfranchisement for every different Tribe!  I say!

OPEN LETTER TO JELLO BIAFRA

Yo Jello,
When once in a debate you asked Jennifer Norwood who's 
paying the PMRC's bills she blurted out "Occidental and 
Merrill Lynch."
  Do you have any plans of harrassing Al Gore this time
around for making Lieberman, Tipper the movie and TV
industry his newest battleground? I expect him to
publicly attack Buddhist Colombians who fast from
cocaine any day now.
  I'll be asking you this in Q&A at my leg of your
Spitfire Tour this semester if you wanna prepare 
yourself and you happen to see this ahead of time.
  Peace, Love and Praise the Ammunition,
marco

ERIE, Pa. Reprinted from (AP) Oct 23, 1972. (back when they
didn't rely on satellites to bring you the news) -- The Penn
Electric Co. says it's going to attempt to scare gizzard shad
from waters near its facilities by broadcasting rock music on
underwater loudspeakers.
  The utility says the one-foot long fish die from a lack of
oxygen when they are drawn by heated water from the firm's 
water discharge pipes in the East and West Slip Bay waters of
Lake Erie.
  The utility says it's using rock and other contemporary
music because scientists have advised that fish can become 
accustomed to less jarring music.

I walked the floor of the White House night after night until
midnight; and I am not ashamed to tell you gentlemen, that I
went down on my knees and prayed (to) Almighty God for light
and guidance more than one night. And one night late it came
to me this way - I don't know how it was, but it came: (1) 
That we could not give them [the Philippine Islands] back to
Spain - that would be cowardly and dishonorable; (2) that we
could not turn them over to France or Germany - our commercial
rivals in the Orient - that would be bad business and 
discreditable; (3) that we could not leave them to themselves -
they were unfit for self-government - and they would soon have
anarchy and misrule over there worse than Spain's was; and (4)
that there was nothing left for us to do but to take them all,
and to educate the Filipinos, and uplift and civilize and 
Christianize them, and by God's grace do the very best we could
by them, as our fellow-men for whom Christ also died.

In honor of George Bush Jr's president errant
aspirations, and his bottle of ketchup dad,
I bring you these prime anarchist notes while
watching "The Attack of The Killer Tomatoes."
                 
Just finished up zappa's "200 motels."
Now I'm watching the Humble Pie / Peter Frampton
where are they now, or whatever on vh1.
I'm about to watch "attack of the killer tomatoes"
a second time looking for content for my zine.
I know I wanna get the "groton sub base closes
down" footage for sure.


Jerry Moss and Herb Alpert.
The A's and the M's of A&M, hmmm...

Penny McCall.
Everyone's groupie.
Well, til she became the Queen of Frampton.

Dee Anthony, manager.

Frampton and the BeeGees; sgt peppers lonely
hearts club band.
No script. "felt like a monkees episode."

Pretty much the story of his life, huh?

Sting for VH1's Save the Music. Because our
501C3 desperately needs a bunch of junk money!!!

================

Are you ready to rumble?
This is only the second time I've ever watched
"AOTKT"

Johnny Depp and Martin Landau in Tim Burton's
Ed Wood. Nice short preview. I haven't seen that
one yet.

Mothers Boys: preview's too long. Not gonna see THAT one.

The Crow. Another one of those chock full soundtracks I
never got around to catching.

OK, the director's cut of Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.
"16 years ago..."

Constantine J. Dillon.

Was the theme song really played on the shuttle in 90???

In '92; 14 years after the original release.

Present Day. Yeah right. Wearing THAT clothing?

Attack of the killer tomatoes
Attack of the killer tomatoes
They'll beat you bash you squish you mash you
chew you up for brunch
and finish you off for dinner or lunch

They're marching down the halls
They're crawling up the walls
They're gooey gushy squishy mushy
Rotten to the core
They're standing outside your door

Remember Herman Farvage
While taking out his garbage
He turned around and he did see
Tomatoes hiding in his tree
Now he's just a memory

I know I'm going to miss her
A tomato ate my sister
Sacramento fell today
They're marching into San Jose
Tomatoes are on their way

The mayor is on vacation
They've come to shred the nation
The police have gone on strike today
The national guard has run away

[repeat chorus]...lunch, lunch, lunch, lunch...



"1 adam 12"

It's not blood, it's tomato juice.

poor timmy. et him all up.

I'm not talking about that, you weiner.
What about the tomatoes?

I want this thing contained.

All we wanted was a bigger healthier tomato.

What's the poop on pffft?

This will never become a problem that Americans need fear.

Will you can it, you little pud puller.

 [The president signing pieces of paper, one pen
 for each piece of paper, crumbling up every piece
 of paper after signing "Official Presidential
 Signing paper." hehehe]

Ah, the antidote. Ronny Desmond's "Puberty Love."

And today, the President closed the nation's last remaining
submarine base at  Groton, CT.

When asked why he had made the startling decision he said, 
"Those funny little black ships just keep sinking anyway."

I think I'll stop it and leave you with that.

Enjoy the flick.

JUST A HOUSE
  a poem by Marco Capelli

When Jack sleeps on a queen sized bed
Eating food fit for a king
In a 9-room house he remembers
21 year old army buddies
Telling him he's "ate up,"
He sips a 7-Up at 6 pm watching
Channel 5 news wondering what four -
Pushing 30-Something knowing
Credit card debt is maybe the only
Two Aces left up his sleeve,
He throws down a 10-spot for gas
And wonders if his whole essence
Isn't just a house of cards.

!ACHTUNG! [PAWN] - Attention, until further notice, the larger 
percentage of P A World Newz stories will NOT be filed. Most
notably the ones financial in nature. "You know," said Prime
Anarchist, CEO and President of Prime Anarchist Presentations,
"the ones that might cause you to rush out and sell off all your
shares before doing even a quick Jeeves or Google to see if the
story is true or just a bunch of YAHOOie!" Anarchist went on to
say that in the not too distant past there was a story about a
certain corporation purchasing all of Vatican City and in the
time it took their hightech owner to let the world know it was
just not true, he'd somehow lost thirty five (35) dollars.
  "People jumped out of skyscrapers, and some even called the
FBI complaining, but all in all nothing was damaged beyond
repair," said Abe Gill, CEO of Yet Another Company, Inc., who'd
been asked if he would consider major jail time for Anarchist,
as the story may or may not have originated at ATI headquarters
inside of a 286 laptop computer linked up to the net with a
2400 baud modem on a shell account.
  "I mean it's not like he pulled an Emulex or something," Gill
said. The YAC chief went on to say he applauds Anarchist's
quick editorial decision, as it's always best to "rest in the
arms of safety," than to "risk something risky" on the side of
chance or great risk.

And in other PAWN Merger Mania News...

WASH - (PAWN) CDC and CDC Embroil In Friendly Merger.
  Commercial Department of Conservation has mergered with the
Coloured Diversity Committee.
  Yes, it surprised everyone. No one thought these two would be
able to find so much as one laptop or apple workstation to call
redundant between the two major nonprofit corporations, but they
did it. And they managed to get rid of 6,900 employees between
the two of them.
  That is not to say any of them had any difficulty getting 3rd
shift jobs at the fourteen Hardees, twelve Borders Books or
seven Gables In A Partridge-Pear Tree outlets locally for well
above minimum wage either.
  "It was friendly," said Bonnie Ocean, teamchief of one CDC or
another. "You put your hand upon your hip, and when the NASDAQ
dips you dip." She went on to say it's as "easy as ABC. You All
fill out forms, some of you will Be in your cubicle next Monday
and some of you, well we'll C you to the Door." The rest, she
said is history.
  Their new name will be the Common Decency Collective, "or CDC
for short." Companies that used to be Conservation Departments
will focus mostly on Conservative issues; while the coloured
people will take a more progressive style like back in the day
when there were unions or captains to rely on.

Gnome Poem
by anarchist23

When it all hits too close to home
  When the drug is so big it's 
Surrounding you...
As the machine eats 2/3 of your soul
And since everyone except you
Seems so crazily into their
Disconnected sanity,
Insisting that if you'll only
Salute Big Brother all will
Play out as it should.
When the world is ordering up anew,
As well - all of Alexandria begins
Imploding like a gigantic sucking, swirling sinkhole -
  You begin to think that metaphor
Is all that's left.
