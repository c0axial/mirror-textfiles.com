Hello, I'm prime anarchist and this is my rant for
Monday, 04/09/01 - Full moon going out, eh? Ah whoooop!
  Well, today was complete for me at 8am. I watched a
woodpecker working atop a telephone pole about two
blocks from my house. Now I've either "seen it all,"
or "seen all I'll ever need."
  They're talking about SOA in confirmation classes
all over the country. Well, I've "confirmed" three
instances, so I'm thinking we're seeing a trend here.
My thought is:
  Forget Bart Simpson man. Forget Martin Sheen. We need
the Power Puff Girlz.
  Well, once again, many of us gathered on the east 
coast from all over the country, from all over the world
and we attempted to speak truth to power, like fools
before us, St. Francis, Mahatma, Mumia, Martin, William 
Kunstler, Dorothy Day, Angela Davis and Mother Teresa.
  I live just for this.
  I live justly for this.
  OK, I've got a serious question here. What is the Jones
Day building and why is the "handicapped accessible" 
entrance an old cut stone stairway that is most definitely
NOT handicapped accessible??
  Gum-Out the ink on your typewriters, people. The First
George's famous middle initial is NOT (I repeat NOT) a 
letter at all. It's a numeral. III. George III quick 
becomes George W. How? \|/ Hmmm...
  TAGLINES - You try whisc'ing, SOA'ing, Whisc'ing, Benning,
whisc'ing, panamania, and whisc'ing. But you still have,
ring around the collar. WHISC, you're soaking in it. Like a
bad neighbor, SOA's there. When you absolutely, positively
need a massacre overnight. You deserve a break today, so
we'll close the SOA.
  I can't believe we trained the whole bunch!
  Now, I'm serious here. This is no laughing matter. I have
in my hand two pamphlets I received on Friday while I was
wandering around our nation's capitol. Which pamphlet would
you find wackiest? Tell the truth. One that starts out, 
"Welcome To The Pentagon, Please Come Back?" or "MUSIC: 
Musicians United to Stop Involuntary Circumcision?"
  The Pentagon's Metro Cafe "proudly brew[s] Starbucks
Coffee." http://www.freespeech.org/kokopeli/pentagram.html
  http://www.stopinfantcircumsision.org had the Capitol's 
East steps all weekend. I swear. They beat us to a permit 
by 6 months! We had to use the lawn. Oh well.
  "Read my lips, I'm George's son."
  T-Shirt idea: "What Part Of 'CLOSE THE SOA' Don't You 
Understand?"
  Listen, I can't believe they gave us the whole National
Monument Sunday. I mean we were definitely parading without
a permit.
  They wouldn't let us make a straight shot to the Mall and
then when they realized turning us would send us even closer
than they first thought, they tried to tell Paddy to turn us
around, and he told them he'd try but thought it would be 
difficult, they looked for the end of our procession and 
never seeing it, the police sped off away from us, with 
other cars coming in from both sides to stop traffic and 
direct us on past the thing. I mean you could stick out 
your left hand and touch it. 
  If we were willing to climb on top of each other, I bet 
we could have knocked it over. Just a thought...
  hehehe
  OK, I'll end this ranticle-infested columnizing with an
opinion. Ready?
  We are to be called Generation J thru D. We are J-D because
we are the entire year. Yeah. J20, F26, M29 (yeah, pie-ing 
wolfensohn!) A16 and A20 on thru N19 and D20. We are the
year that was, we are the year that will be. 
  Well, J-D sucks, but it's a better nick than anything
anyone else has come up with so far. 
  Vale,
  Prime Outa Hear.

Very nice, Marco.
I know what SOA did for us in Brazil. 
Brazilian military dictatorship sent
many personnel for training on torture 
and stuff. SOA web site seems very
interesting too, putting available some manuals.
Essential for those whom care about human rights.
Thanks for the tip!

Dear Marco Capelli , 
I know this letter will come as a surprise to you. 
I am a director of an N.G.O desperately needing to
transfer over $19.5 million out of my country for the
personal use of my partners and a foreign assistant. 
Please reply me through e-mail if you are interested
so that I can elucidate on the details.

    PORTRAIT OF A PROVOCATEUR OR FOUR

  by Marc Frucht.
  Special to ACTIVIST TIMES.

  OK, here is my new profile of a c0intelpr0
agitator/instigator/punker/blackbloc-wannabe 
presence at a Washington DC demonstration.
  Had I never seen Haskell Wexler's "Medium Cool,"
I might've missed this one.
  As part of my routine PeaceKeeper tasks last 
weekend I snuffed out four feds on the Mall. Or
is neutralized a better word? Nah, why co-opt
violence. I helped display and make four feds
just uncomfy enough to leave as quickly as they
came, "cover blown."
  We'd just marched from the Elipse past the 
Washington Monument onto the Mall to stage a mock
die-in and then a couple hours of mass-leafletting.
  "Kill, kill, kill!" I heard in the distance, fast
getting closer, "Rape a hippy," said one. "Napalm
sticks to little kids' bones," shouted another.
  Four of them they were, marching lock-step up to 
and inside our crowd. Jeans, Nikes, and brand new 
blue hoodies they each wore. I mean so new, none of 
them had even been washed the first time. That's
one of the biggest factors that gave them away, if
you ask me. Some of them had piercings, some didn't,
but they all had identical haircuts. Same Navy or
Army unit probably, and I was guessing they were in
their early 20's each. And they couldn't help walking
in lock-step no matter how hard they tried. That'll
usually tell you how close someone is to basic training.
  Three forced their way into the very center of our
die-in pushing and shoving - the way you'd crash a stage,
or make your way into a mosh pit. The fourth fed followed 
them in and stood just behind. (possibly in charge?)
  I walked up and made my way just to their left, watched
a little, and listened. Looked around, found Bill just
in front of me filming the flute player with Linda, 
another filmographer and still photographer.
  I reached forward tapping Bill's shoulder, whispered in
his ear, "the four blue hoodies to my right are NOT with 
our group, please help me keep an eye on them, ok?"
  He looked them over, whispered "ok" and went back to 
his work. He looked their way a couple times, back and
forth between them and me, and I kept looking between
them, Bill, and the group we protect, and soon enough
they all "about-faced" and marched off to their left.
  I followed loosely behind in case they were planning
on circling. I was afraid they might plan to lose me
and Bill and then bust in and get rowdy, but I lost 
them into a different crowd heading for the metro.
  Another friend nearby confirmed that they did in fact
enter the subway system, and that on their way out they
were shouting more of the same right-wing paramilitary
crap they'd started in with.
  I went back to my routine work thinking to myself they
might have done all this spontaneously, reactionary to
our group's presence; but then I'm trying really hard
here to give them the benefit of the doubt, right? 
Reaching, you know.
  They reminded me way too much of descriptions I'd heard
about Seattle's Black Bloc impersonators who tried so hard
to provoke a riot giving the Bloc a difficult reputation
to live down that they struggle against still to this day.
  I heard it was later exposed that Seattle's BlackBloc
impersonators were Washington State policemen in their 
early thirties and late twenties trying to seem like 
angry rebellious Black Bloc teens. I wonder who was 
paying these kids' bills?
  Thank you Haskell Wexler, 
[ ref ]=[ http://flag.blackened.net/ati/mediumcool.html ]
                            for keeping me knowing that 
this kind of terror has been going on at US tax-payer
expense for so many decades.
  Four of them!

WHAT'S NEXT?: Fantastic - by Marco
  Shame on the US left. I believe the most difficult
thing the Zapata people will have to do is find it in
their heart of hearts to forgive "amerikan" leftists
for leaving them the big task.
  NAFTA. Dropping the ball in THEIR tennis court. (we
could have stopped that here in the US back in '92 or
'93 - maybe earlier...)
  But shame and forgiveness soon comes.
  Because just as the US army rangers chose a brown
beret letting go the black, and Vicente Fox tries for
La Realidad or UNAM each letting the other go, I see
the "International Community" making the New World
Order to give up and repeal NAFTA.

CAMBIO: Friendship Bracelet

Washington DC and back is definitely downhill.
  I borrow this expression from my fargone army days,
when I fancied myself a patriot, much different kind
of patriot back then, I've developed since then.
  You can NOT be a patriot blindly. Blind, you cannot -
will never be a patriot. Blind, a soldier, yes. A 
murderer, yes, a floor mopper, buffer, waxer, and liar,
sure, but not a patriot. You'll see.
  Washington DC is downhill all the way.

  The shit rolls downhill.

A little colder weather,
And we all freeze together,
Wishin' more plants were on the line.

All the things I'm missin',
Like lights and television,
Are waiting 'til we can pay the price.

Turn 'em on, turn 'em off,
Shut 'em down, block 'em out,
Turn 'em on, turn 'em off, statewide!

Brown 'em out, black 'em out,
Charge 'em more, give 'em less,
Let the polls fix the mess, statewide!

Keep movin', movin', movin',
Though they're disapprovin',
Keep them rates a-movin', statewide.

Don't try to understand 'em,
Just raise, charge, and collect 'em.
Soon we'll be livin' high and wide.

My heart's calculatin',
Nuclear plants will be waitin',
Be waitin' at the end of my ride.

Turn 'em on, turn 'em off,

Brown 'em out, black 'em out,
Charge 'em more, give 'em less,
