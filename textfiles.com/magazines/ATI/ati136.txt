PHILLIPINES
-----------

Off-Key Singer Killed By Revelers
  MANILLA - (PAWN) Drunks stabbed a man who sang an off-key rendition
of a popular Phillipine love song at a Manila pub.
  Ely Dignadice, a 29-yr-old seaman, drew jeers from 10 men at a 
nearby table when he took a microphone and belted out a local song 
titled "Remember Me" out of tune, police said Monday.
  Later, the men left the pub and waited with knives, bottles, wooden
clubs and a gun. They allegedly attacked the man when he walked out of the
pub with two friends, killing him and injuring his companions.

CIA Headquarters will likely be named George H. W. Bush Center for Central
Intelligence. It passed the Senate. Am I the only one who thinks this is
a scarey notion? Happy Sunday. Here's another ATI. Plenty of #'s run,
some editorials, and the usual good stuff. We're averaging 1.2 letters to
the editor a week. So it's a typical slow summer. I hope your garden grows
as well as ours. We're seeing eye-high corn, and tears2your eyes habaneros.
Corn's only expected to be knee-high by july. That's some kind of record;
and habaneros are just supposed to make you hurt, not cry. Hmmm. Telling.

How 'bout a phew parodies??
Because Parodies beats a royal flush any day.

I gave my love a Pepsi, she said iced tea.
How could you give me Pepsi, I asked for iced tea.
I gave my love a soda; I thought she'd drink.
She poured all of the Pepsi into the sink.


To: It Don't Mean a Thing.
Your silk panties give my cotton ones static cling.
Doo wah, do wah, doo wah...
Your silk panties make my cotton ones wanna sing.
Doo wah....
Makes no difference if you use cling free
Or fabric softener just won't do a thing.
Oh, your silk panties give...

Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme.
Remember bay leaf serves good in soup.

Then we can go to the kiss (eno)
We can park in the lot far away
And take a shuttle to where we'll play.
And gamble away all our hard earned pay
That we made.  (optional endings to repeat: Saved for our retirement

To: Good Morning America
Ridin on the city bus this morning
Dollar 50 just to ride to work
Smell of diesel fuel just makes me nauseous
There's no bathroom just a window that doesn't work.
All along the trip to work I thought
About the car I never bought
'N I coulda gotten there faster if I jogged.
Making stops at every spot
Picking up every old sot
Maybe I'd a rather just been flogged.

Good morning america how are you. 
Your transportation system really sucks.
If I walked to work I'd probably gotten there faster.
I would rather hitch a ride with an ice cream truck.

<Announcement> Date: 07-11098 
Released by: Skulljkr Explanation: 
In response to the plethora of Pepsi(tm) based attacks 
flooding the Script Kiddie market these days, Skulljkr and his 
band of merry mutants have decided to release their 
oft-heralded personal BSD-based operating system to the public.  
PepBSD is a unix oriented soft drink guaranteed to have at
least %25 less security holes (and almost *no* buffer overflows 
thanks to it's fructose-less design) than the common soft drink.  
Disabled versions of PepBSD 3.2 are available from our 
ftp site which only accepts 3 connections at any given time 
(ftp.pepbsd.org), or you can send $89 and $14.95 postage for the 
complete six-bottle set.  Also included will be PepBSD stickers 
that say: "PepBSD- don't make you fart". 
Closing: We don't hack computers anymore.
