Dear Republican, 
They just can't obstruct enough! 
First it's the economic stimulus package, 
now it's judicial nominees. 
President Bush has nominated Judge Charles 
Pickering to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. 
President Bush has worked hard to find qualified 
candidates like Judge Pickering who will enforce 
the laws on the books and NOT legislate from the bench. 
But the Democrat Senators would rather play politics 
than act responsibly. And Judge Pickering has been 
targeted and attacked not just professionally, but 
also personally. 
These attacks have little to do with the facts of 
Pickering's record as a public servant. 
The real target is President Bush and these left-wing 
extremists will stop at nothing to score political 
points against the President. 
You can make a difference in this battle! 

Please contact the Senators listed below.

And tell them to stop these infantile games and support 
the nomination of Judge Charles Pickering. 

 Senator Joseph Biden (D-DE)     202-224-5042
 Senator Herbert Kohl (D-WI)       202-224-5653
 Senator John Edwards (D-NC)    202-224-3154
 Senator Max Cleland (D-GA)      202-224-3521
 Senator Mary Landrieu (D-LA)    202-224-5824
 Senator Blanch Lincoln (D-AR)   202-224-4843

   [well, whatever. Thanks for contacting us though.]

Koppel, Koppel & Koppel news is our

Request for Research
====================

The most important "no" that Manuel Noriega told the 
US Gov't was that School of Americas could not remain 
in Panama unless it got rid of all aspects of counter-
insurgency training. Shortly after that his country 
was invaded and he was thrown in Dade County where 
he still sits. I recently finished reading his auto-
biography. It left me wondering a lot about Milosovec's 
guilt or innocence!
  And I worry that no one's ready to hear this: but I 
wonder about Bin Laden's guilt or innocence in all this 
as well. It seems unimportant now that there might never 
have been any evidence, huh? I'm certainly not saying I 
respect or admire Bin Laden, what I want to know honestly 
and openly what he might have said publicly the day he 
was appointed Commander In Chief of the Taliban 30Aug01. 
What else might he have said beteen then and mid Sept?
  Did he defy the US Government? Did he say something 
about Henry Kissinger's mistress? Or Bush's manhood? 
Is he pushing the Iran/Contra issue? Maybe he had an 
axe to grind against the Enron people. If I can push 
the Noriega model perhaps more than I should, does he 
have proof that George W Bush is a consumer of Heroin 
and Cocain maybe?

We end with a poem:

OH AMERICA, WHERE ART THOU?
  by Michael o 

In the Beginning...

There was a shrieking sound 
Rising from the plaint of 
The powerless in the face of 
The red-hot Sun burning, 
Terrifying them. 

They fled to caves 
As the moon 
Rose a'glowing 
And the owl screeched 
And nocturnal carnivores ate the 
Stragglers, the lame and 
The young. 

Powerless over birth and death, 
Their Patriarch's cocks 
Shriveled in failure 
To fight the winds and waters, 
Roaring earth and 
Firestorms that tore at them 
And the day creatures 
That stalked and devoured them 
Before being devoured 
By them. 

During the light of day 
They warred against helplessness 
In holy feasts and massacres 
Of dead blood and flesh 
And at night did 
Sacrifices and mad dances 
In the roaring heat of their captured Sun, 
Its light dancing on the 
Stark white of stake mounted skulls. 

They are called barbarians and savages. 

In wars of land and loot conquest, 
In merchandising slavery, 
They became powerful over 
Others who walked like them. 

They proclaimed themselves anew 
In sermon praises of a 
New sunlit day. 

'A God,' they cried out, 
Bowing before an  
Anointed one, 
The strongest one, 
The most weaponed one, 
The richest one, 
For possession of land 
And gold 
Was deification. 

Hindu, Buddhist, Jew, Muslim, 
Christian, Yahweh, Allah, Jehovah, God...
They prayed and chanted out. 

They wrote their myths and 
Grew their religions, 
Until humankind was but 
Servant to them. 

In the White man's world...

They called themselves 
King, Pope Fuhrer and, 
Later, dare I say, 
The Holy Trinity of 
Doctor, Preacher, 
President. 

They garbed themselves in 
The bloodied robes 
Of their risen one, 
Chanting the name 
Of that dark skinned, 
Wooley-haired, Palestinian Jew, 
Jesus Christ of Nazareth, 
Who their predecessors killed 
As quickly as they could, 
Lest he lead the people 
Against them, 
Whom their artists created 
Into a pale and weak blue eyed creature 
For their manhood's sake. 
Soon they costumed themselves 
In the role of Merchant, Banker, 
Mover, Shaker, 
Tithing for yet another 
Missionary seminary 
Of leaders girding their loins 
In their latest, contrived 
World wide, alabaster, 
Holy Christian War, 

One had became one in the same: 
The symbol of the dollar followed 
The warrior's cross into the battle 
Of mercantile. 

Do you doubt? 

Do you not see 
The dying entrails of Enron 
Snaking through the Bushes of Eden? 

Do you doubt: 

As the mammoth machines 
Of Halliburton reconstructed, 
Under Cheney's watchful eyes, 
Vast Asian battle fields 
Of the last war's millions dead. 
As he and Bush pave 
A new and sandy path 
For petroleum's 
Snaking pipeline desert route 
Through Afghanistan? 

Far too many of us 
Chose the High Mass 
Of Denial as our latest opium, 
As Bush the former, 
Nuked the children 
Of the Persian Gulf, 
As the protectorate of oil. 

And our soldiers came 
Home dying of a new rot 
In their bodies, 
Denied by the very 
Corporate government 
Who created it and 
Sent it and them there. 
Just as they did 
The Agents of Orange, 
Green and Blue. 

Then Bubba Bill 
Used the same 
Uranium tipped 
Bombs and bullets 
In the Balkans, 
Lest the Europe be 
Less stable for 
Euro-corporate dollar. 

And we never saw that 
As the Italian, Spanish, 
And German NATO 
Veterans fell sick, 
And dying, 
There was a 
Look of Hiroshima 
In their eyes. 

Far too many us have become 
Blinded by the glistening, 
Rolling, white zealot's eyes of 
The avenging Sword bearer Ashcroft, 
---Who amidst singing the most pale of 
Fundamental nasal-tenor serene hymns, 
---Eerily stayed attuned to 
This new Leader's Serpentine hiss, 
'Terroristsssssssss.' 

It is the hiss heard round the world 
Everywhere the Burning Bush 
Has adopted the fallen flaming Cross 
Of the White Man's conscripted Burden. 

And lest we forget: 
One can hear the 
Echoing of Clinton feet, 
Once stomping the 
Liberal reformist march, 
Skittering like fleeing rat nails 
In the sacred halls of 
Global Crossing and over 
The dead and decaying 
Bank accounts of countless 
Broke and jobless employees. 

And suddenly, 
All our nation has gone silent as 
The steel barred gates of 
Executive fiat crash down like 
Crusader's sword thrusts 

---killing as surely as the murderers of 
Danny Pearl--- 

And the Network Executive hatchet 
For rating knife points 

---Risking as surely the dénouement 
Of Night Line--- 

Our First Amendment Right to know of our 
Elected's documented Wheels and Deals 
And as we now know of the 
Paranoid Nixon-Graham epithets 
Swearing at, and conspiring against, 
The unchristian rabble who they feared 
Would surround and devour them 
As in days of yore. 

It hisses forth now that we are 
Suspects all...'terroristssssss'...

Oh, America, Nation that I love, 
This is not the War to End Terrorism 
But the war of Corporate Capital, 
Masqueraded in 
The Savior's patriot-uniform 
Adorned with plastic-colored, 
Neon crosses, 
Marching to military hymn's 
Sang by every 
TV Sunday morning, 
Gospel weaving 
Bible hawker, 
Out to eat our hearts and minds 
Like sacrifices of old. 

'Terroristssssssssss!' 

The Leader spits the venom every moment. 

'Witches,' his predecessor's screamed. 

Hunting them down. Drowning them, 
Torching them as pyre kindling 
Akin to that what made 
The ashes of Salem and 
St. Joan fills the sky. 

'Heathens, pagans, barbarians, 
rabble-rousers, Devil, Shaman, 
Infidel, Atheist.' 
History records 
The never ending 
Victim litany of these 
Hypocrites.    

Oh, and less we forget, 
The seventy years of 
'Communist Antichrists,' 
Who, they raved, were coming 
To take our young at dinnertime, 
Not with movierola Fava beans, 
But to lure them away from the 
Eucharist of sacrificial blood-grape wine 
And white flesh wafers, 
With gifts of Dixie Cups filled with 
Mixed fruit Jell-O and 
A promise of Heaven on Earth of 
Choc-o-late pudding with 
Sunday desert plates stacked with 
Sugar Icy Crispy Cream donuts, and 
By numbing their little, fragile 
Impressionable minds 
With chlorophyll, and promises 
Of freedom and equality 
This Red Menace would 
Then rape and invade their 
Tender virgin bodies with something 
Known to them as Godless Atheism. 

And even though the threatened marched 
And picketed and protested lock step 
With these Red villains, 
And some of them sexed with 
The Commies 
And joined with them in their 
Pathetic Party, 
They seemed to have survived, 
Minds and souls 
And organs intact, 
To think for themselves another day. 

That is, those that were not tormented 
And driven from their homes and country 
As outcasts and traitors for 
Opposing the predecessors 
Of the Corporate Killing Machine 
That lives today. 

And today, 
The names of the suspects 
Have changed. 
Today it is Militants, Radicals. 
And did I remember to mention, 
'Evil Doers?' 

Next, they will place 
Black and white head shots of 
Revolutionaries Wanted Dead or Alive 
Next to the Ten Commandments 
In every school hallway. 

And as they contaminate again 
Those once hallowed institutions 
You will hear the cries of 
The once heroic, oft immortalized, 
Revolutionary Heroes, 
Jefferson, Franklin, 
Washington and Paine, 
As they flee for sanctuary 
Behind the parchment cloak 
Of their Bill of Rights, 
Only to find it ripped asunder 
And torched with flames from 
The firestorm of torch crosses 
And burning books. 

Like our history, 
We have been stolen, 
Kidnapped, held hostage. 
Our armor of inalienable honor 
Pierced as if by U-238 projectiles. 

We and the citizens of the world 
Are being prepared for rape and murder 
By the rogue Wildcat Agents of 
Wall Street's mean spirited 
White Christendom. 

They are cynical barbarians dressed 
In Brooks Brothers' Khaki camouflage, 
Who, now armed with the omnipotent power 
Of an unthinkable war of nuclear first strike, 
Go on the Crusade of the Righteous One, 
Against the peasants of The World of color, 
Raving in sermon and blood letting. 

They have taken power 
For someone in alarm 
Had screamed: 
'Because of Bill Clinton, 
There will be a Nigger in 
The White House.' 

And a Sentry of the Right said, 
'Not until they pry 
This gun from my 
Cold, dead fingers.' 
"Then Mullahs ruling 
The Temple Mount.' 
Another shouted? 

'Not until this 
Uzi falls empty 
Across my dead 
Child's chest.' 

'Shalom,' he wailed, 
A friend of a 
Hollywood Democrat, 
His head banging 
Against The Wall 
Drowning out 
The gavel sounds 
Of Nuremberg 
And the 
Blinding, stark, 
Reminiscent 
Black and white 
Photographic images 
Of Jews being rounded-up 
In the ghettos of Warsaw. 

Just like Palestinians 
From the Gaza
