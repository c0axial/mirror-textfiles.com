"I die with the conviction, held since 1968 and
Catonsville, that nuclear weapons are the scourge 
of the earth; to mine for them, manufacture them, 
deploy them, use them, is a curse against God, the
human family, and the earth itself."
   -- Philip Berrigan, 1923-2002

Hi, 
  One key aspect to ChristianAnarchy is a ton of
faith that dads and/or moms will TeachTheirChildren
the first 10-20 years of their lives EverySingleThing 
they NeedToKnow leaving them able to function in all
society whether OutsideInterVention is needed and/or
imposed upon them or not.
  What better time to discuss this than just before
Christmas; better place than ATI; better giver than 
a Bruderhof person. Read this, and enjoy the rest
of the 'zine.
  Marco

A SEASON OF HOPE--AND BATTLE
Johann Christoph Arnold

This is the season of hope, of light coming into darkness.
  For years, psychologists, educators and church leaders 
have warned about subversive and decadent influences  
on children in our society--the internet, pornographic 
literature and films, violent video games, raunchy TV, 
and so on. It's an old story: the more sexually perverted 
the entertainment, the more teenagers watch it, and the 
higher the ratings and the profits. 
  In my books on parenting, I have pointed to these dangers 
and suggested that the greatest trap is not anger or abhorrence, 
but indifference. And that indifference increasingly alarms me, 
because public and private morals are no longer merely slipping, 
but plummeting. Values most people once took for granted are 
simply not expected anymore, with catastrophic effects in our 
children and young people. What has happened to honor and respect 
for father and mother, for one's nation, for law enforcement or 
authority of any kind?
  I have often pointed out how big companies, exploiting our 
greed and materialism, are destroying our children. Both 
business and government are now pressuring schools to excel 
in academics, rather than focus on developing character and 
integrity. Apparently, our culture prides itself on producing 
brilliant CEOs, with Ivy League degrees and zero moral values. 
We can see the bitter fruits in the recent spate of corporate 
scandals.
  Faced with these realities, many parents are afraid, and 
with good reason, to send their children to public schools. 
Every week I hear of another family pulling their children 
out of public schools to teach them at home. Naturally this 
solution brings its own problems, since working parents too 
often are forced to give home-schooled children short shrift 
as they valiantly try to earn a living and educate them at the 
same time.
  Further, healthy parent-child relationships are becoming 
rarer and rarer, in part because children are loosing their 
childhood innocence earlier and becoming jaded and worldly-
wise long before they reach adolescence. Most tragic of all, 
many young people are so discouraged (and, because of the adults 
around them, such strangers to the idea of long-term commitment) 
that they have no desire to marry, let alone have children.
  In a way, it seems that the terror of 9/11, far from 
uniting people--as many predicted it would--has divided us. 
Everywhere, fear and mistrust are destroying relationships. 
I am not just talking about a nagging, low- level nervousness 
about terrorism, the sagging stock market, or looming war in 
the Middle East. Those uncertainties have become a fact of life 
for everyone in recent months. I am talking about the very real  
demons of fear, violence, lust, greed, and divisiveness that are 
literally pushing individuals, couples, and even whole families 
over the edge. 
  This is a global crisis--one that demands our full and undivided 
attention. The Roman Empire collapsed not only because of external 
invaders, but because of its own decadence and decay. It pains me 
to see my own country, like the Roman Empire, self-destructing 
from within. We are waging war on terror all over the  world--
and meanwhile neglecting our own homes, neighborhoods, work 
places, and schools.
  These are the real battlefronts we ought to be concentrating 
on. If only more of us realized that what really matters in 
life are healthy relationships between individuals who respect 
and love each other. This is the glue that holds a society 
together, which no amount of prosperity, laws, or security 
measures can replace.
  Over a hundred years ago, the great Russian novelist 
Dostoyevsky wrote:
  "Everywhere in these days men have...ceased to understand 
that the true security is to be found in social solidarity 
rather than in isolated individual effort. But this terrible 
individualism must inevitably have an end, and all will 
suddenly understand how unnaturally they are separated 
from one another. It will be the spirit of the time, and 
people will marvel that they have sat so long in darkness 
without seeing the light."
  Which brings us back to the holiday season.  
The answer--whether we are Christian, Muslim, 
or Jew--is to believe that the God who created 
us has not given up on us. This is the original 
Christmas message: on a dark night 2000 years ago, 
angels announced to the world, "Fear not, I bring 
you good news." And the good news? A little baby 
was born, pure and undefiled, bringing light into 
the darkness.
  Even today, new children are born into the world 
every day, and each one is, to quote the Indian poet 
Tagore, "a renewed message that God has not lost faith 
in humankind." If the creator has no lost faith in 
humanity,  who are we to do so?
  As Jesus taught, we will find peace and happiness when 
we, too, become like children. Our only hope is to once 
again encourage and appreciate wherever we can this 
childlike innocence, which can still be found in small 
children and sometimes in the aging. Fighting to reclaim 
this carefree spirit of childhood will make  life worth 
living. It will take away fear and depression, bring back 
a sense of purpose and security to our youth, and encourage 
parents who are desperately trying to raise their children 
in the face of so much adversity.

A MAGICAL HAIKU MOMENT:
TIMELESS
We love each other 
An indisputable fact
Now and forever

SU LIN, OUR MAGIC PANDA, INTERPRETS
  "This author is a grandfather who has attained great
wisdom. He is expressing the ultimate paradox: we may
not always be on this earth, yet we are always attached
to each other. An ardent passion for living such as this
exudes joy to those around them."

EXPRESS YOURSELF
An Asian form, Haiku is a non-rhyming three line poem of

THINK ABOUT IT:
Especially now, when the generals and pilots have gotten 
their parades and the resisters are getting the brig, 
court-martials, and harsh sentences (including the 
governments threat to give resister Erik Larsen the 
death penalty for desertion!) we know who this war's 
true heroes are. And we must stand with the resisters, 
and continue refusing to "Support The Troops."

We end this zine as we began it,
with a Phil Berrigan quote:

"Because of myopic leadership, of greed for possessions, 
a public chained to corporate media, there has been 
virtually no response to these realities..."
