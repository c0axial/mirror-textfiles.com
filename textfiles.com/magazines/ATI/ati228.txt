Hola,
I'm Prime Anarchist, and this is what I "rant" for Saturnday,
10june2000. It's about 9pm my time. Where am I?

PRIME ANARCHIST COLUMN
   [as if...(this guy thinks he's a columnist??)]
Well, I'll be a mummy's conq shell.
  McRib is back. Month of June only. Remember the New Haven
trip? If you don't I'll tell you about it. I'll betcha don't
unless you're in my Ochsian "small circle of frendz" for that 
year. And I don't even remember what year it was, so there.
Where am i???
  I'm driving from southeastern connecticut to southwestern
connecticut on a daytrip with three friends to shop around in
two stores. Brian's Guitars, and BookWorld, not near the Yale
Green and near the Yale Green respectively. We stop in a McD's
somewhere and there's something new, so we all try it.
  "This McSucks," says friend A about the McRib sandwich.
  "This is McShit," says friend B.
  "This is McHorrible," says I (I was known to be a little
dorky back then.)
  "This isn't half bad," says friend C.
  "What?!?" says we three loudly, turning heads from the whole
room. As if we're four Yak bulls who just stepped into a pasture
full of brown and white milkcows.
  "This is all bad."
---><---
I had an upset stomach the other day. I named it processedfood.
Because it reminded me of McRib meets the new Subway bread!

GUITAR ANARCHY TECHNIQUE TIP (GATT) OF THE WEEK.
GATT # 21

To The Tune Of Surfaris' "WipeOut."

You think this song has no lyrics
Well have I got news for you
You think this song has no lyrics
Well that makes me kind of blue

Because I wrote up some new lyrics
Last millenium or two

And well nobody was into it
So now I am kinda blue

But that's OK
I'll do it my way
The heck with you.
---><---
Can you see out of the white part of your eye?
I've met some women lately who can it seems.
---><---
My recent vinyl scores must be shared.
You ready for this?
Fugazi - Fugazi
Segovia - All Bach Program
        - Plays: Fantasia... Castles
Phil Ochs - Pleasures Of The Harbor
The No WTO Combo - LIVE: From The Battle In Seattle

_& In CD Form_

---><---
Do you know anyone they named food after?
  I do now.
  The "Spicy Jon" at one of my local coffeshops. A
hummus pizza on a pita bread with red peppers, onions,
avocados and who knows what else underneath.
  Very yum.
  Jon's the inventor. Last time I saw Jon he'd just
bought a Marshall half-stack and he was dying to show
me it in the back of his truck.
---><---
OPEN LETTER TO KUCINICH AND WELLSTONE
  Would either of you (or both) be willing to help me
lose on a legislation that'll influence bills to come for
decades? I'd like to put all my life into it for a year
or two and see what comes of it directly besides 
assassination plots.
  I want a 4-year moratorium on any and all mining. If
each and every aspect of the economy can't figure out a
way to continue without acquiring new minerals during
that period, they're welcome to cease existence and let
fresh new "blood" come in who believe they can pull it
off in their stead.
  s/ prime
---><---
Still looking for Lynn Perry.
  Whatever happened to you? What's your "movie" look 
like. Wanna trade stories?
---><---
metaphor : machete - camcorder
---><---
this zine in its entirety is dedicated to aguascalientes
---><---
  I thought of a great band-name for 4-5 middle-aged
male rockstars doing the summer festival circuit.
THE COMBOVERS
---><---
If you go nude to a Wendy's Hot & Juicy, they'll give you
a burger, fries and a biggie drink free.
---><---
  My next classical album's going to be called,
"Not Bolero."

Talking Transit Authority Blues
by Steve Molly

I was walkin to the subway early in the day
  And the sky was turning grey
When I got to the tunnel, I couldn't find a token
  But the cops were looking off the other way
        So I jumped the turnstile, walked along with a smile
          Stopped to tie the laces on my boot
        When I got to the car, standing at the door
          Was a man in a business suit
He had one foot on the platform
  And the other one was on the train...

  [prime anarchist snip..."you'll have to enjoy the rest
   when you get there. :)]

  The Gov knows what's best for you; that is their burden,

POT TIME IN YE OLDE TOWNE 2-NITE

LONDON, Ontoreo - [PAWN] -- Police raided the kitchen of
Buckingham Palace and found a small amount of marijuana,
Scotland Yard said Saturday. No arrests will be forthcoming.
   "A very small quantity of a cannabis plant was discovered
and has been taken away by police for looking over," Yard
spokeswomanman Madeline Albright said on condition of anonymity.
The amount involved was minute, she said, and it "wasn't even
enough to pass around, really."
   The tabloid 'News of the Wild' reported Sunday that ever
since she found out she was part Jewish, Albright has been
"acting rather funny." They claim she's been wearing Rastafari
clothing and saying "Hey Mon," whenever not at work. Between
that and being such an Anglophile these days, she's got all
of the Royal family including Billy Blythe Clinton and Alvin
"Tip Her" Gore befuddled.
   Five Gorillas on the payroll of the British terrorist
organization "Palace Staff" (or "ps" for short) had alerted
police Royalty Protection Squad, saying that the marijuana
was found Saturday morning.
   Buckingham Palace gave no comment, saying only that the
police will be so choosing each on their own whether or not
to inhale.

MAN CONTRACTS SECOND TERMINAL ILLNESS
[PAWN] - WASHING TONS, District of Collusion - 
  Roger That [no relation] had just celebrated his first full year
without any "yuppy flu" symptoms. He came home from an all-nite
dance and couldn't sleep.
  The pain in his stomach and his butt were telling him "you had too
much to drink," as did the fact that the room was spinning madly. He
then spent three hours kissing "the porceline goddess." Trouble was
he'd had nothing alcohol-oriented in years. Helping to bless him
and keep him during his bowing to madame porceline, were three issues
of National Geographic. After he'd read all about it, he decided to
see a doctor to make sure he didn't have cholera.
  "You've gotten the first case of the year of swine flu, son," said
his doctor. The press was there within minutes because not only was 
it the first of the year, it was also that of the millenium.
  Doctors, who'd expected That to die over a decade ago, say they
don't hold out much hope for That to survive this.
  "Swine flu is such," said Doctor Paul P. Hocus, "That That will be
tired but won't be able to keep himself from taking a third or fourth
job because of it." Dr. Hocus suggested he buy a laptop bed assembly so
can do all four jobs from a reclining position, plus file his monthly
taxes and daytrading bills right from the room. Hocus says he surely
won't make the next millenium - "reason being, despite all the new
innovations in life extension which make most upper-middle-class 
workers last 'til their hundredth and sometimes thousandth birthdays,
That'll be lucky if he makes it to a hundred!"
  "No one has survived both yuppy AND swine flu," said Hocus, "no one."
  But That's not completely pessimistic. He's moonlighting as a
standup comedian thanks to REALvideo and his trusty MacIntosh which
he'll "load LINUX into when [he] get[s] around to it."
  "Yuppy swine flu?" he motioned 'go away' and 'whatever - loser' with
his right hand. "I'll get over it. I'll cope. What doesn't kill you,
makes you funny."

GIMME THE TRUTH [paraphrased from MojoWire]
"The John Lennon FBI Files"
by Jon Wiener
  "Remarkable... I know of no keener annotations
to any documents illustrating government surveillance.
Wiener's commentary is as sprightly as the documents
are foolish. He is thorough, appropraitely droll at
times, and rightly focused on the question of whether
the FBI and the CIA were keeping to their lawful
mandates."
  --Todd Gitlin, author of "The Sixties."

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 22nd, 2000
Independent Web Publishers Unite in San Francisco
  SAN FRANCISCO, California --  Allies of independent
publishing on the internet will gather in San Francisco for
an exhibition, forum, and party to celebrate those who create
(or want to) for the new medium.
  "We have waited too long to face the evil, and there is no more
waiting," declared Webzine 2000 organizer Ryan Junell. "We won't
allow dot-com strip malls and passive entertainment the opportunity
to come to power."
  Grassroots organizers created the Webzine event in 1998 to unite
creators from the web and other media in an informal environment to
discuss the meaning of independent publishing in relation to an
ever-growing commercialized internet.
  Audience members at Webzine 99 and Webzine 98 included activists,
designers, journalists, dj's, web workers, educators, artists,
culture jammers, subversive anarchists, slackers, assholes,
academics, and cool kids.
  Speakers at past Webzine events included Burning Man founder Larry
Harvey ("Radical Expression on New Frontiers"), REsearch Publications
founder V. Vale ("If the Web Were Punk"), Factsheet Five Publisher
Seth Friedman, Andi Zeisler from Bitch Magazine, Amy Francescini
of Future Farmers, Mark Pauline from Survival Research Laboratories,
Srini Kumar of Unamerican Activities, and 45 other independent media
creators.
  In spite of two previous Webzine events, e-commerce and consumer
brainwashing has shown no signs of slowing down. "Webzine 2000 will
establish that the web is a democratic medium for personal, creative
and alternative expression." said event organizer Scott Beale.
  Webzine 2000 stands out as the foremost global event for independent
publishing on the internet. The event will be held on July 22nd from
4pm until 2am at 2050 Bryant Street in San Francisco, California.
During the evening party, the audience will be moved by
experimental digital music performances by Kid606, Wobbly,
Lesser, and Crispus. The audience is expected to exceed 700
people throughout the course of the day.

It's A Go! A "NAMMY" In The Grammies
Grammies Announce the Establishment of a Native American Music Category

We, NAMA are ecstatic and elated regarding the recent announcement of a newly
established Native American music category in the Grammies.  This calls for
a time for the entire Native American community to participate in a unified
celebration surrounding this momentous development.
  We wish to thank all of those who directly and indirectly contributed to our
official category proposal and would like to acknowledge the many
organizations and individuals who over the years have contributed to the
mainstream growth and acceptance of Native American music in the national
marketplace.
  We are extremely grateful and indebted to Michael Greene, Diane Theriot and
all those at N.A.R.A.S. (National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences) for
inviting us into this process and making this category possible through their
organization. Ms. Theriot's public comments in the New York Times and Los
Angeles Times citing our proposal efforts as "excellent, and well-documented"
were gracious, encouraging and appreciated. The world renown Grammy Awards
are now truly honoring all of the diverse cultural conditions of music and
its makers.
  We especially would like to thank; Jennifer Warnes, Paul Winter, John
Schonenberger of Album Network, Amazon.com, Borders Books & Music (NYC),
Barnes & Noble (NYC) Joanne Shenandoah, Tom Bee of Soar Records, Cheri Harmes
of Makoche Recordings, Cat Brotzman of Four Winds Trading, James Marienthal
of Silver Wave Records, and Canyon Records for their supporting
documentation. We wish to thank; Robbie Woliver of the NY Times, Steve
Hochman of the LA Times, Jim Adams of the Wall Street Journal and Indian
Country Today, Kim Hall of News From Indian Country, Native Peoples Magazine,
ASCAP, Gathering of Nations, Alecia Cohen of Rhythm Music Magazine, Yahoo
Music Shopping, American Indian Report, Robbie Robertson, Charles Sanders of
the National Music Publishers Association and our entire membership for their
support.
  Most of all we would like to thank the many artists who have shared their
traditions and gift of music with us all. We look forward to their now
receiving proper recognition in a global society. We dedicate this
achievement to all those before us and the future generations to come.
Spread the word - Thank the Creator -  And honor each other for this is a
great accomplishment we have not only witnessed, but all helped make happen.

            NAMA BOARD OF DIRECTORS

  Linda White Wolf, V.P.          Michelle Shenandoah

"The Indian is artistic by nature.  His art is not only a luxury of the
cultured few, but the unconscious striving of the many to make beautiful
the things of daily living. Indian thought presents material absolutely
unique. Here, we may look into the mind of a race utterly unlike any
other in the world. Indeed, perhaps the most ancient of peoples and
their spiritual conceptions should be of interest and value to the
whole human race."
Natalie Curtis, Musicologist  1875-1921

PeaceCar
a poem by swiftrain

i saw some little girls in the car next to the one i was in,
i waved to them & one of them waved back,
the next time i passed them they were all looking out the window,
excited & happy, waving,
i gave them the peace sign
& they gave it back -
i could see their lips say "peace"

i wondered how much they knew
about what that gesture means

but i knew that they were happy
& alive & responding & glad to see me
& that i had made a little change in their lives
just like they made a little change in mine

& i resolved to make a world for them
where people circle & love & smile & wave
we can do it
