ATI/PAP declares state of emergency.









OPEN LETTER TO ERIN BROKOVICH:
  Please drop everything else you're doing and
help litigate Depleted Uranium, (DU) will you?
Be brave.
  The rest of us will wait for our day in court.
We need this one so bad I'm crying over here,
while I listen to the man from the BBC interview
you live as I drive down the street with all the
paper mills.
  Thank you,
marco

  Activist Times, Incorporated urges all US citizens who consider 
themselves dynamic to consider taking an extreme leftist stance 
to offset this recent emergency.
  "This is a temprorary attack," says Prime Anarchist. "After 
this you can go back to being middle of the road, or moderate 
right. But you have to see the graveness of this CIA shit or 
you're a real dweeb."
  Anarchist says he's a registered republican but sees the need 
to put a democrat in office for at least the next election or three.
  "If nothing else," says anarchist, "rally, lobby and vote on the 
appointments and judicial issues. I hated Albert Gore II AND III,"
but we'll need his people in times to come!!!"

& Of Course LETTUCE:

why did you use the name ati?
  K.S.

  [ati is informal spanish meaning "to you," or "for you."
In the context of the 'zine it stands for activist times, 
and then whatever "I" feel the I to stand for at any given 
moment. I've been putting out ATI officially since 1988 and 
messing around with it as an idea since 1985]

Investigation continues over who named town after
TV show.

    Prime Anarchist World News

TRUTH OR CONSEQUENCES, NM - (PAWN) An unoccupied
mobile home crashed into a test pattern when driver
Willy Kerin fell asleep watching a rerun of Sunday
afternoon professional bowling.
  "Or maybe it was roller derby," says William 
Brown, spokesperson for U-OSLO, the United States
Olympic-Strength Leisure Organization in Colorado
Springs, CO.
  The big screen TV had been parked at a gas station
but rolled across the street to a Hollywood style
filming of Chief Jay Strongbow wrestling Tatanka
in his first comeback match since 1986.
  Strongbow, who witnessed the naming of the town,
said "when that TV hit that game show host as he 
was holding out a booby prize [a 20-gal propane tank]
the town lit up "like a late 70's game show where 
someone just won a trip for two to tahiti."

ALCOA'S 4TH-Q EARNINGS INCREASE 48% JUST LIKE W'S
(PAWN) - PITTSBURGH - Like George Bush who went
from being selected by one vote to being elected
by 48% - Alcoa managed to increase their stock an
additional 48%, up from 17% last Q by announcing
within the next five years they plan to pull
enough aluminum foil out of the ground in four
continents to wrap Kathy Bates' body snug as a

NYC - (PAWN) McGraw Hill Faith Tim Corporation Moves
Into Position To Fare Well In Both AMMAs and GRAMMMYs.
  Make sure your investment folio has plenty of McGraw/

  "We're looking to capture Female Artist, Country
Album, Country Female Artist, and Country Male in the
AMMAs," (amerikan muzac maladjustment association) said
McGraw Hill spokesperson Faith Tim, "And even more next 
month in the Grammys."
  Their stockiness is expected to go up meteorically no
matter how many awards they take. Statisticians from the
Julianne Moore Jody Foster Brooks and Dunn, L.L.C. say
it's going to be a surer bet than "that George 'W' Bush
would have won the presidency in '00."

Well here I sit backstage at this weird trendy Port Jefferson, Long Island
night club. We?re (M.D.C.) doing a cancer benefit for our bass player?s
old friend who is putting on the show. We?re playing on the bill with a
bunch of Pat Bennitar cover bands along with a wedding band that does oldies
to ghoulish ska. The crowd is half made of these aging rocker chick and dude
types that I feel terribly self conscious for and the other half look like
they just strolled in from the volunteer firemen?s barbeque. Don?t let me
forget to mention there are ten or so, old school skinheads who tell me/
threaten me that they are there to see us. I go backstage and  I?m sitting
there daydreaming to myself about some other things I?ve done with my life
that I wondered why I ever did. When I was a kid I was totally neurotic
about counting things. Be they cracks in the side walks, steps it took to
get places, how many mail boxes on the way to places and on and on. I?d do
quite crazy stuff like put my tongue on door knobs, wherever I walked, I had
to run my hands against flat surfaces, sometimes I?d kiss strange dogs with
my tongue just as anxious and eager as the dog would. And at my catholic
school right outside my second grade desk window, as if was put there to
tease me, was this long frozen icicle hanging from the drain pipe. I?d stare
at it day after day all through the winter and I knew it was calling me to
lick it. I fought the urge, I kinda knew I was setting myself for something
bad. I had heard that frozen cold things and tongues were not a healthy
combination______________________________________________________________
/                                                                        \
  I couldn?t help myself , during lunch I snuck back into the room opened 
that window , leaned out there and connected my tongue to the forbidden 
icicle and sure enough it stuck and I was stuck till the class and Sister 
Marie came back and eventually the janitor Mr. Dougherty poured some hot 
water onto the icicle and it broke away and eventually freed my tongue.
I remember everyone and I mean everyone asked,? why did you do that for?? 
I remember Roxanne Cafferata looked at me and sighed and never had that
wanderlust again in her charming brown eyes for me ever again. Why had I
done it? God knows, Attention Deficit Disorder, curiosity ? A
combination.....Some burly back stage type dude asks to see my backstage
tag. I hadn?t put it on and offered it to him from my pocket. He suggested
very strongly I put it on to avoid getting thrown out. This is ridiculous,
who the fuck would be sneaking backstage? The wedding singer bands groupies?
Whatever I put it on and drift into my daydreams. I flash back to playing
with rocks in front of the brand new church stain glassed window. I mean
there I was with Steve Hanley and Ritchie Colgan throwing rocks and none of
us ever dreaming what happened would happen and sure enough Steve Hanley
pitched me a rock and though I was never much a hitter I connected and hit
that rock for a homer, right through the stain glassed window. We ran and 
we got back and later our class was spoken to at first and then threatened. 
Our class was never gonna be let out for recess ever again. We held our 
tongues and lived with the guilt and to this day I?ve never ever really 
talked about it. I Start thinking of my many mistakes in life. Not 
taking the sweet Jeannie Kassajenski, who really liked me for me, to 
my prom and instead taking the buxom cheerleader, Terry Kehoe, who 
 ___________________ignored me all night_________________________________
/                                                                        \
__________________________________________I think about other sweet love 
possibilities that I squandered away chasing what I thought were greener 
pastures that ended up only appearing greener. I guess maybe we?ve all been 
there but to me it seems I?ve been there too often. I have been told I am 
a risk taker. I guess that?s right and here I am in some God forsaken hamlet 
on eastern Long Island not playing to my tribe, not making music for the 
C Squatter sisters and brethrens. And soon its time to get up on stage and 
perform, how am I gonna handle it? I think to myself. 
    Well before you know it there I am in front of four hundred old time
rockers, firemen and their ilk and those smattering of skinheads. And it
just came alive for me. I state that I was born around there and that I   
hated the cops . Who the fuck has ever dialed 911 in there life? When I   
heard the silence I said,? thought so.  All these overpaid, lazy ass cops
are good for around here is to hang outside of these bars and write D.W.I.
summons?.Then we broke into Millions Of Dead Cops and it was beautiful, it
was like the scene in the Blues Brothers Movie when they played Rawhide.
People were hooting and hollering, firemen and women with silly skimpy
outfits long necks raised cheering us on. Even the skinheads loved us and
claimed us as there own. We did our short, blast of a set and then tried to
give everybody there bar back but they wouldn?t have it. We played encore
after encore till we played a few Johnny Cash songs and there wasn?t a dry
eye in the house. We exited and claimed Long Island as our own and felt good
and it came back to me why I licked icicles and played with rocks and sticks
in front of church windows and why as well we don?t play all our shows to
our safe crowd of you hipster, bebop, punker, groovers______________________/
