Hello I'm Prime Anarchist and here is my rant for
ThirstDay, October 12, 2000. Day b-4 full moon.
Marco's General Rule of Taco:
  If you didn't grow the corn yourself, or at least
pick it or have some sense of who grew it for you,
then for PepsicoSakes DON'T EAT IT!
  Shall we get out of the habit of buying commerical
tacos ANYWHERE? Lets.
  I'm an old folksinger, are you an oldfolksinger too?
How are you this week? You'll notice ATI didn't come
out last week. Well we got a couple unsubscriptions
and a couple subscribe requests, but our Computer God
was on vacation, and since I'm having trouble unsubscribing
people who can't unsubscribe themself, I skipped a week
so as not to offend.
  We resume to our once a week schedule in a couple hours.
So what's happened this week? Wow, far too much to fit in
here. So all you get is "all the news that fits."
  We lost 4 sailors to an act of terrorism, our corporate
media says. Hmmm. Umm, can I say something about war? No
wait, I'll say two things about war, next up, we just got
some of our oilworkers captured in Ecuador by some people
with not so good intentions.
  OK, now I'll say a couple things about war. When you put
your young people in harm's way, and then someone pushes
a raft near to your ship and your ship hits it and blows
up, you are really stretching to call it "terrorism." Dare
I stretch the other way and call it an act of war? Or maybe
let's take the middle ground and call it what it is. An act
of self defense. Of course historically, we Untied Statesians
don't seem to know how to define "self defense" do we? Let's
see, if I put some troops on your front porch and you get
ticked off and kill one of them, I'll begin bombing because
"how dare you cause me to defend myself..."
  Do I really have to build the analogy here for you?
OK, try raping someone (our military's getting really good
at it lately) and call it self defense when s/he screams,
moves around or kicks you somewhere perhaps you deserve it.
If your new hypothetical definition of self defense doesn't
look 100% authentic real live, new and improved stupid, then
I have an idea. Let's bomb the tar out of Ecuador and call
it self defense. Let's bomb the heck out of Yemen. I know,
let's just get it over with and blow up the entire planet
and announce to the whole world that it's Saddam Hussein's
fault. We'll be happy and Mother Earth can start healing
herself and rebuild without our sorryass police-state
tendencies.
  Or I know what. Let's get some rocks and strips of leather
and stone the hell out of Henry Kissinger.
  Oh wait, I'm a non-violence activist aren't I? Forget I
ever said that.

  - GOOD NEWS - Mexico - 
Fourteen active-duty soldiers of the Mexican Army and a member
of the state Judicial Police were disarmed and imprisoned by
indigenous civilians in the municipal center of Metlatónoc,
Guerrero, on September 25 after one of the soldiers fired his
gun at a Mixteco dancer during a religious festival. The dancer
was not injured in the incident, but the soldiers were quickly
surrounded by more than 500 Mixtecos who disarmed them and
placed them in the municipal jail. The soldiers and policeman
were freed the following day after a commission made up of
representatives of the state government, the Army, and state
deputies of the PRI and PRD signed an accord with the
municipality pledging the withdrawal of troops from the region,
and promised to pay damages to the family of a local police
officer who was killed when federal army troops ambushed a
municipal police truck in April 1998.

TIGGER SUES TWO TIGERS AND TWO ADDITIONAL TANK COMPANIES
  By Anthony Toulouse-Lautrec
  Special to Prime Anarchist Whirld Newz 2nite
Twister, Tenn. (PAWN) "These are the stripes of economic 
Strife."
  Some are titling it "trademark terrorism," others try 
saying it's setting the tone for trouble; but one truism's 
for sure. This is all too telling.
  Tigger is suing Texxon, Killogg, Chevron and Exxaco.
  This is thanks to oily giant Texxon-Mobile losing a bid to
put off a trial over whether tough-guy toon Toni violates
the spiritual tone of Killogg's Tony the tubby tiger, leaving 
both corporate giants and many others vulnerable.
  Killogg contends Texxon retired it's tiger in the 80s when a
recall was eminent as all tigers who run faster than 40 MPH
may spontaneously combust. But they came out with all newer, 
faster tigers in the 90's featuring a revised tubby tiger toon
more true to it's corporate nature - plagiarism, mimicking and
trademark violations.
  In a suit filed fourteen years ago, Killogg claimed the new
tubby tiger promos step on the Tony trademark because Texxon
was now using Toni to sell food, not fuel. Killogg said hungry
people may assume that Killogg is somehow behind soda, coffee
and other items for sale at Texxon's ExxacoChevronAmokomart
TigerSuperStores.
  Shoppers can tell the difference, Tennessee's attorney general
Tom Tirigliano retorted today.
  Yet another wrinkle unfolds - Tigger is suing everyone. Filed
in Twister, Tennessee, Tigger's lawsuit has been terrorizing the
whole town for two weeks now. And it's not expected to finish 
anytime soon. Two hundred acres deep in the Tennessee woods, 
Tigger sits there totally tormented.
  "They've been trippin' for years, man," says a tired Tigger
via teleconference. "Stealing ideas, ripping me off, taking 
all my tunes and trademarkin' 'em!" He doesn't sound happy. 
  "This is terrible," he told, "I never wanted to sue ANYONE,
now I'm so ticked, I've put 5 trial attorneys on ryder and 
I'm simply gonna litigate on anyone that gets in my way. 
Texxon, Killogg, Exxaco, even Tobacco and Macaroni companies. 
Tell everyone. No one's exempt. Totally."
  Tigger is expected to win on at least two or three of the
thousands of trademark suits tried. 
  And this, according to Tennessee's AG, will "turn the industry
upside down on its tuchus."

When you sell a song for 10 years for $2500 you lose all
your control, freedom, power and lifeblood - your name,
your birthright.
  When you GIVE AWAY your song you change the world into
something so much more like you, and you grow ever so much
MORE wealth-ful than any mere millionaire.

RESUSSITATIVE: You Don't Need Electricity To See Light.

Only prints of darkness, oppression and death.
If you wish to see light
Breath your own song
Or new life
Into someone elses.

ANTHROPOLOGY SONG
 a poem by marco

Are you keeping good records?
Or are you missing the key points
Like a needle skipping over a groove
Instead of getting in and staying with?

Get in there and BE good records
Go out there and MAKE good records
Give them away,
Let someone ELSE worry about
KEEPING of the records. 
OWNING of the records.
DISTRO of the records.

Why write ANYTHING down -
Can't you breath song?

The fox and the salamander
  FOR SAL AZAR

There once was a fox.
People were glad he was not 
A fox from the priveleged,
the Right, or the royal
      I.
(Or so they thought)

There is also a
Salamander, he seems to be
Of the people and for the people.

We shall see. 
He'll take our direction
One way or another.

A salamander can lose part of himself 
Give of himself
Say "Creator,"
"Show me how I should become."

A fox cannot.
