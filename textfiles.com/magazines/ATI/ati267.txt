   IT WAS NOT DARKNESS, BUT IT CAME OUT OF 
   DARKNESS, JUST THE SAME
    
   IT WAS GIVEN A NAME AND THAT NAME WAS GIVEN TO SOMEONE ELSE, 
   BELONGED TO SOMEONE ELSE, IT WAS NOT REALLY HIS NAME, THOUGH 
   IT DREW TO ITSELF WHAT IT COULD NOT CONTAIN, AS A FUSE DRAWS 
   A SPARK TOWARD AN ALLNESS, DRAWS A COMPLETENESS TOWARD AN 
   INCOMPLETENESS, TOTALITY TOWARD ITS SEED, THE GAP BETWEEN 
   THE TWO...IMMEASURABLE...
    
   AND IT WAS THE NAME WHICH WAS GIVEN OF OTHER THINGS THAT MOST 
   NEARLY APPROXIMATED HIS NAME, SUCH AS BLUE FOR SKY OR RUN AND 
   LEAP, FOR FREEDOM
    
   AND SO THE NAME HE WAS GIVEN MADE AN INSIDE-OUT, MADE A 
   SOMETHING GOING THROUGH A SOMETHING TO SOME OTHER SIDE AS 
   A COMPLETE CHANGE, AS IN BEING A COMPLETE CHANGE, AS IN 
   FROM NOTHING TO SUNSHINE, A QUICK AWARENESS THAT THEN SEEMED 
   TO HAVE ALWAYS BEEN GIVEN, HIS INITIAL FORGETFULNESS THE 
   ANNIHILATION OF ALL THOUGHT AND MEMORY JUST TO START, JUST 
   TO BEGIN TO GET HERE, AND THE SURROUND OF ALL THAT HAD BEEN 
   AFTER THAT, WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO LEAP, TO BE AND BECOME AND 
   TRANSFORM, WHAT WOULD HAVE ALWAYS THEN BEEN THE ESSENTIAL 
   AGREEMENT, AND THAT BEFORE NOW WAS IMPOSSIBLE DUE TO ALL THE 
   END-GAMES AND DEAD-ENDS, TRAGEDIES AND EVASIONS, AND SIMPLE 
   UNTIMELINESS AS YET, THAT THE SURROUND HAD TAKEN UPON ITSELF, 
   UNSPEAKABLY, AND IN THE ULTIMATE FAITH OF LOSS'S COMPLETE 
   EXPERIENCE, AND THE SOMETHING LEFT OVER FROM THERE, EXPRESSED 
   IN THEIR WISHES, THROUGH THE NAME HE WAS GIVEN, AND NOW WITHIN 
   WHICH WAS LIGHT, OR THE AWARENESS WHICH HAD ALWAYS THUS BEEN,
   THROUGH THE PROOF THAT YOU RENDER
    
   HE MOVED WITHIN AND TOUCHED AND TO BECOME THIS AWARENESS AND 
   WHICH WAS THUS AN INITIAL DIRECTION THE ENACTMENT OF WHICH 
   FUSED BEYOND EXPRESSION WITH AND AS THE ACTUAL DESTINATION
    
   AND THAT IS WHAT IT WAS THAT CONTINUALLY CAME OUT OF THE 
   DARKNESS BUT WAS NOT THE DARKNESS ITSELF
    
   AND THAT WHEN IT HAD BECOME WHAT THE DIRECTION WAS AS PERSON, 
   HIS NAME WAS THE SAME AS THE ACCUMULATION OF ALL THE EVENTS 
   AND DISTANCES TO GET HERE, UNPRONOUNCEABLE THUS, HIS BEING, 
   AND THEN THE OTHER NAME HE WAS GIVEN, THE FOREIGN NAME, THE 
   COMMON ONE NAME, NOT THE INEXPRESSIBLE, WOULD BE SOMETHING 
   ELSE AGAIN, THE NAME WITHOUT THE WOUND OF ARRIVAL, WITHOUT 
   THE EXPERIENCE OF ANNIHILATION IN HAVING LEFT ALL BEHIND
    
   AND ALL THAT HE NOW WAS, WOULD THUS COME INTO AND THROUGH 
   THAT  ONE AND THE SAME INEXPRESSIBLE NAME, IN A WORD THAT 
   HAD ALREADY BEEN AGREED TO, FROM A PLACE THAT WAS YET FUTURE 
   TO NOW, EVEN BEING HERE, THUS, AND TO YOU, A SEED THAT THE 
   EARTH SURROUNDS WITHOUT KNOWING

Good afternoon, didn't that make you feel the same 
way you felt when you watched the opening scenes 
to Phantom Menace Star Wars? All that text moving? 
  Should've. Hi, I'm prime anarchist, and this is the
zine for the second week or so of March, Two Thousand 
and One.
  That was written by my new friend John Lord. He sent 
it to me a little while back, but I thought 267 would 
be the best issue to tuck it in. And after reading it 
a third or fourth time, I decided the very beginning 
was the best place of all to place it. For after all:

  WHAT'S IN A NAME?

Well, "One Robin Don't Mean Spring." But two blizzards
usually do, right? This takes me back to when I was about
9 years old, and May 8 was opening day for my Little League
baseball team. The date sticks out in my mind because it
was either the day I was "born" or/and it was [also] 
Mothers Day. And to top it off, there was not only a 
threat of being rained out, there was the notion that we
were about to be SNOWED in! In May? You got it. I'm glad
this year's blizzard came in February or March, know what 
I mean? Who wants to do "April Showers" and the "May Snow."
  You know that cold, wet feeling and a smell that can't
articulate into english-language words that lingers the
day before? Well I also remember a high fly ball when I
was trying to be left-field instead of catcher. The thing
came down and hit my glove like a bullet out of the chamber
of a Columbine-third-shooter's missing gun. My hand felt
like every bone shattered. It was about 28 degrees out.
I remember the following year, Little League corporation
(LLC?) passed a directive that there was to be no more
practices during temperatures below 34 deg.
  But that was the following year. The damage had already
been done. No, not physically. My uncle (a has-been who
almost played for the Boston RedSox, but his dad made him
go to college instead of wait out full recruitment by
Boston, having only had the chance to play for the 
Pawtucket Red Sox) called me "sissy" and "pussy" because 
I cried that the ball made my hand hurt. C'mon Uncle, I
was eight years old for cryin' out loud.
  I learned one of my most devastating lessons that day,
May 8th. One it took me about 20 years to unlearn. Boys
are(n't) supposed to cry. I guess what this is all about
is me trying to tell people (men AND women, but especially
you hardened, lonely island-of-a-human men out there...)
if you need to cry both outside AND inside. Gush man. Don't
be a fool. Cry your little you-know-what off if you need to.
Get it out so your neck doesn't turn all red and you don't 
end up beating someone nearly to death, or picking up a gun
and wasting someone. Do it now. Tomorrow is too late. Your
rage can easily be your son's school shooting; trust me, it
spreads like a Saturday Reagan radio address, or a Hitler
BeerHall screaming match.
  Cry like a baby, cry like a big fat dweeb, cry like a 
lion who lost his mate. But cry if you need to.
  And this last 'graph of my column is a shoutout and greet
to my new friends at Attic Bookstore. You know who you are.
The Magnificant Seven. Because I'm tellin' ya. If it weren't
for being able to cry, and St. Johns Wort, I'd of been dead
5 years ago.

What I can't stand about VH-1?
  When they say "tonite" and it's 9am.

And since when did Pfizer corp and Warner Lambert merger?

Thank you for emailing President Bush. 
Your ideas and comments are very important 
to him.  
  Unfortunately, because that last sentence 
was a complete lie, the President cannot 
possibly take time for your message. However, 
the White House Staff reviews every email 
message and reports citizen ideas, concerns 
and sometimes even hate mail to the President.
  Again, thank you for your email. Your 
interest in contacting the President by 
email is appreciated.
  Sincerely,
  Autoresponder

George W Bush quite frankly, sucks.

GHOSTWRITER
  A Song Excerpted from a Michael 
  Boren Williams record.

Do you recognise all the songs you hear
Are the melodies slow to leave your ear
Well I could say the same
Of course I heard them first
They came to me in dreams
Then people stole my work
I'm a ghostwriter
Oh I'm a ghostwriter
Oh

Did you really believe those clowns compose
Haven't you noticed the playback at their shows
Well they don't want you to hear how they really sound
And they don't want me to be anywhere around
'Cause I'm their ghostwriter
Oh I'm a ghostwriter
Oh

THEY'RE MICROCHIPPING WHO???
2. Any dog or cat which changes ownership or is 
newly acquired by an owner (by sale or gift) will 
be required to have an identification microchip 
implanted (by an authorised implanter, usually 
a veterinarian) before it can be registered. All 
dogs currently owned and registered will have to 
be microchipped over the next three years.

3. It will not be compulsory for owners to have 
the cats which they already own microchipped, but 
it will be compulsory to register the cat with the 
Council.

NUDE PANTYHOSE ARE BETTER THAN BLACK OR WHITE:
Associated Press, You Are So Busted.
    By the prime anarchist
  Special To Activist Times, Inkling.
  "23 SCHOOLGIRLS DIE IN NIGERIAN FIRE," reads
this morning's headline, in a story about a blaze
consuming an all-girls school in Abuja. They could 
have easily used the expression "youths," or 
"students."
  But the Associated Press is becoming websavvy in 
their old age. They're as aware right now as I was 
years and years ago

                        that overusing words like

legal, eyebrow, licking; ati and fort lauderdale;
cancun and marco island [/i] will have your page 
hovering higher in search engines than any other 
competitors' pages with little or no money down!
  Too late AP. I'm nineteen steps ahead of you,
