Hello there, I'm prime anarchist and that was
the numbers, this is my column and next up we
have lettuce for your head. And then all the
mad usualness follows. I mean the following
usual madness, I mean follows, ah whatever.
You mean what I know!
  This is ati 'zine issue 271. Late for last
week; early for next. Yeah, we staggered it, 
why? Because things were just getting a little
TOO regular around here. It's of utmost importance,
we're dealing with volatile substance, this zine
must come out whenever we feel like it.
  Or else.
  So enjoy the heck out of it.
  And what if you don't? So what.

Hi !

I sent you the message below last week; 
I'm sorry if you visited my website and 
were turned away.  It was shut down by 
the University of Texas - I should have 
known better than to promote energy 
conservation from President Bush's own 
back yard !  I suppose his Administration 
really does hate the environment . . . 
  Be that as it may, I have downloaded 
all the files to a new business web 
hosting server.  
  The new URL is http://www.inviticus.com
  Thank you kindly for your patience.

Subject: Is ati@etext.org feeling under the weather?

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Phone In Sick Day 
   (http://rtmark.com/sick) 
                  has been moved to April 20 in 
Canada, to coincide with the Quebec City Summit 
of the Americas meeting that starts on that date 
   (http://www.a20.org/).
"Quebec has been turned into a fortress, to keep 
public opinion out of the decision-making process," 
explains Duane Dibbley, an RTMark member who will 
attempt to attend the Summit. "Since thousands of 
foreign would-be protesters have already been turned 
away at the border, we're trying the Trojan Horse 
approach: we're encouraging Canadians who might 
ordinarily work on that day to phone in sick and 
go to the protest instead." Previous Phone In Sick 
Days have been held responsible for the "sick-outs" 
of two thousand British Airways employees in 1997, 
and of thousands of Irish policemen in 1998 
  (http://rtmark.com/sick2000.html).

And fifteen months to the day after etoy finally 
won its battle against eToys and Network Solutions 
    (http://rtmark.com/etoynsi.html), 
Project ICAN 
   (http://rtmark.com/fundquick.html#ICAN) 
             shows Internet users how to challenge 
NSI's continued suzerainty over the "root zone" 
(the file that decrees what domain extensions are 
available), an arrangement that overwhelmingly favors 
big business.

RTMark's primary goal is to publicize corporate 
subversion of the democratic process. To this end 
it acts as a clearinghouse for anti-corporate 
projects. Project forums may be found at 
http://rtmark.com/f/get/funds.html, and a list of 
just-added projects is maintained at:
http://rtmark.com/new.html.

or cafe or Algerian low-life dive.

There's the guy, see?
and like he dies, but there ain't no heaven nor hell
no purgatory, nothing but the Underworld.
And it's ruled by Pluto, like
but he has a wife, Penelope?
(Pandora maybe)

But like this guy dies and goes there
and runs onto the wife
And like he's a real charmer
and talks her into letting him go.

So Wow Man!  Like he's reborn, but not really
to be born is to die, once you're here, you're here
but he's got Everlasting Life!
And like he's a young, lusty guy

So he goes on a tour of the Greek and Agean island villages
Having a good time, drinking wine smokin` hash
talking philosophy into the pale lavender dawn mists
Chasing ALL the ladies

Having a good time.

And what the hell?  This can go on forever
'Cause Sisyphus can't die, he's already dead
And every time some stray husband, jealous lover
or just plain brigand
does him in...

It don't work!

And Sisyphus continues on his Greek tour
havin` a GOOD time

But like Zeus and the boys hear about this
And they ain't happy about it
Because Like Man! only the Gods live forever
Who IS this guy?

This Sisyphus disporting himself like a mere mortal
enJOYing life!  Diggin` it grooving on it totally IN it
and never dying so he revels in every microsecond

ONLY GODS DO THIS!
says Zeus and the boys

So they go get Sisyphus
Take him to this Mountain
Give him this big old boulder, tell him
Roll, Daddy, Roll

And keep on doing it, you got eternity, right?
Roll that rock up the hill, all the way
to the top and when it gets there...
well, you follow it down and start again

You got eternity, right?
This'll keep ya busy
You ain't no god
Remember that

And ol` Sisyphus is still doing it
Rolling that rock up the hill
into eternity...

THIS IS THE CONDITION OF US ALL!
Said Albert Camus

You can pick whatever piece of the story
you want to say THAT'S the condition
but remember...
it's only a story

TIME, Ink., gets the big L on their forehead 
this week. 
  They list MIT University in their "winners 
and losers" section for allowing course auditing 
online free. They joke about "can porn sights 
handle the competition?"
  But that's not why they get the "big L."
  No, they're all over Barbara Streisand for her
memo that "W" stole Florida, and they claim the 
latest tally says he won.
  Yeah? 
  Says who?
  "Foot in mouth not just Euro's problem," they
go on to say.
  You're right, Time. If the shoe fits...

THE BLACKBIRD
  a poem by 
Matthew Hewitt
 
A blackbird with eyes of fire sings a song of death,
Creating an image, an image lined with blood, grimy
With blood. Darkness is strong in its sole, hatred
Is burning like a huge fire in its belly, oh black bird,
Beast of the skies, harbinger of death, free us, free us
All show us the way, the way to the devils door,
To be greeted by his crooked smile. And shake his withered
Hand of blistering fire, and at last feel oh so secure,
So secure.

WE end this zine with a poem by J. O'Nym 

William Stafford wrote 
A poem about a car, 
Surely I can do this. 
Of course, his car is Hope 
And mine is just a car, 
Thirty-six years old, rusted out 
And in the shop, and I am 
No mechanic.
