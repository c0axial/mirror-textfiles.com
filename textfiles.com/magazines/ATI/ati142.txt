An Open Letter To Guild Guitars
 
Great pictures of white people building D-55
guitars in your Westerly, RI factory. I saw
them in your summer insert to Guitar Player
Magazine.
  But I'm confused. How come you didn't photograph
any of the Mexican people who work so hard in your
plants?

Sincerely,
Prime Anarchist
e&p ATI since 1988

Hello, and welcome to ATI. The EDLIN issue.
That's right. Portions of this issue have been
brought to you using the EDLIN command from 
(now get ready for this) DOS 3.3
Now if that isn't a blast from the past, eh?
Got some really good stuff for you this week. 
It's late coming out, just because I was busy
making "dinero" at festivals all weekend. So
you probably get this early or late Monday.
Prime.

All the tornados around the continental US that are hitting, yea
devastating hectare after hectare of land that never saw funnels
before might be explained by a 1975 speech that a Hopi man and
a Navajo woman gave at an Arizona college.
   I badly paraphrase but the idea remains intact.
   "Keep pulling Uranium out of the ground and you will throw
off the thunder and lightning and wind."
   That was the woman, the man was more direct.
   "Tornados, where tornados don't belong. People will die at 
the hands and feet of their addiction to technology."

Red Wing Black Bird a song by Marco

Red Wing Black Bird; 
Where are you.
Are you out there,
Beyond the blue.

R W B B
Near or far;
Keep me guessing,
Where you are.

R W B B
There you are;
I can see you,
From my car.

R W B B
Hear you shout,
Cut the motor,
Jump on out.

ADWATCHERS
Subway's running a particularly evil campaign right now. At least
their radio spots seem awfully abusive. 
   If other people's foods make you drowsy after you eat a meal, 
come try their new chicken sandwich. Never mind that it's probably
a poorly genetically engineered Louis Rich product that they 
likely offered to Subway "rather than throwing it all away."
   Excuse me, you don't need a PHD in nutrition sciences to
know that a type of food has almost nothing to do with Subway's
new Gingivita-halitosa-tarter. THAT DROWSINESS PHENOMENON IS 
CAUSED BY TOO MANY CALORIES NO MATTER WHAT YOU ATE.
   Oh well, their myth will work, they'll make a gazillion dollars
and we'll still have just as many of our own people on a never
ending quest searching desperately for something, anything they
can spend money on and eat two-or-more-portions-per-meal-of 
that won't make them _______(fill in the blank -
almost any adjective will work. =)

Why The English Are Superior To Other Races 
(Especially Americans!!!!!)
1. They speak English.
2. When they host a world championship they invite 
other countries.
3. Visitors to the Head of State are only expected 
to go down on one knee.

To The Editor Of ATI:
hey i tried to listen to it but i am on web tv 
and it would not let me hear it..sorry
bob (718)

Sam Nunn is a Bilderberger and is definitely not, 
IMO, a "good guy."  Also notice that in the interview, 
he said "penetrate" three times and used the words 
"Boy Scouts" once after saying "penetrate." This is a 
Freudian slip, IMO.  I will write no more on that particular
subject.  However, I was fascinated that he did seem to say
(hallelujah!) that CIA employees have murdered while 
on the payroll.  At least that much has now been admitted, 
publicly, by a man who has every reason to know the 
details of such operations.
K. Sullivan (404)


To ATI:
"No question that an admission of making false statements 
to government officials and interfering with the FBI is an 
impeachable offense."
Bill Clinton, ARKANSAS GAZETTE, August 8, 1974, page 7-A.

The ARKANSAS DEMOCRAT, two days earlier -- August 6, 1974, 
page 10-A -- quoted Bill Clinton again talking about the need 
for Nixon to leave office:

"Bill Clinton, Democratic candidate for the 3rd Congressional 
District, said, "There is nothing left to say. 
There's no point putting this country through an impeachment 
since [Nixon] isn't making any pretense of innocence now... 
This country has suffered so long."

Thank's in advance.

I gotta say, I hadn't really gone through your ATI letters before 
(from the UA list), but tonight I'm tripping and totally digging 
the whole thing.  A bunch of BBSes got burned in my area when 
I was getting into the whole scene...snif...anyway, I wanted 
to say that this is nifty lil zene you have.  Good stuff, man.  
Much better than some of these backyard highschool
punks on the list.

"I am convinced that those societies (as the Indians) 
which live without government, enjoy in their general mass 
an infinitely greater degree of happiness than those who 
live under the European governments. Among the former, public 
opinion is in the place of law, and restrains morals as
powerfully as laws ever did anywhere. Among the latter, 
under pretense of governing, they have divided their nations 
into two classes, wolves and sheep. I do not exaggerate... 
Experience declares that man is the only animal which devours 
his own kind; for I can apply no milder term to the
governments of Europe, and to the general prey 
of the rich on the poor."
--Thomas Jefferson to Edward Carrington, 1787. 

"The sheep are happier of themselves than under 
the care of the wolves."
--Thomas Jefferson: Notes on Virginia Q.XI, 1782.

Please make a note of it....

Some other thoughts.....
Should CLINTON:(Certified Liar In National Top Office Now) 
be impeached?
I think so. First off, he lied to the American people.
Makes you wonder what ELSE he lied about.
Now he isn't the first President to lie, 
but 4 years and 40 MILLION dollars....
40 million TAX dollars just to prove that Slick Willie 
couldn't keep it in his pants?
Shit, that could feed a lot of hungry people 
and sure help the homeless....
What about Billary? That blonde headed bimbo's face 
must be redder than Bozo the Clown on a bad makeup day. 
And Chelsea? Who gives a rats ass? Probobly getting
drunk at frat parties.
   What the American people need is a President that is 
willing to stand up and let the truth be known about 
all things the Government knows. All the coverups, all
the conspiracies.....
   The American people over the last 30 years have 
watched this country go downhill and downhill its gone.
Enough is enough. Ground Zero should be president. 
A no nonsense president that would get shit done.
Seriously. If you think about it, a woman in 
the White House that would cut the bullshit from
government. Who cares why ketchup comes out of a bottle slow? 
Them $500 toilet seats aren't funny either.
What is needed is a show on prime time showing 
exactly where our tax dollars go.
(Hey GZ! Wanna host that one??) 
I know ABC news does something like this once a week.

HOT NOCTURNAL ANIMAL: Mountain Bikers. (swiped-in * from RS 793)
   The new masters of darkness, night-riding mountain bikers are like
goths with better tans. With major innovations in bike lights thousands
of riders are now jumping on their bikes when the deer and ring-tailed
lemurs play. In warm-weather areas like California, Arizona and Florida,
nocturnal-riding clubs have sprouted like nightshade. Some have bumped
antlers with deer. Others have looked into the crazy green reflection
of a mountain lion's eye.
   Mountain bikers, who have a greater crossover with Rainbow 
Gatherers than with triathlon geeks, have begun to assemble, Woodstock-
fashion, in fields across the country to enter twenty-four-hour races.
Picture tent cities in red-rock canyons, wafts of sage mingling with 
essence of WD-40. There are also divisions for sheer masochists, but
most join 4 or 5 person teams and ride alternate legs like relay 
runners. They spend the hours between excruciating laps sleeping,
inhaling bean burritos, diddling with bikes or chugging beer. Where
there was but one 24-hour race four years ago, there are now around
twenty. The big ones routinely draw 1,500 competitors or more.
But the mother of all night-biking events is still "Twenty-four Hours
of Moab," which takes place in Utah every October.

(PAWN) TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras - Christopher Columbus stands trial as
his accusers say they still suffer from his alleged misdeeds.
   The Genoese navigator is accused of genocide, robbery and slave
trading. 
   The trial opened Monday on a national holiday honoring Lempira,
the Lenca Indian leader who led resistance to the Spanish Conquest
begun in Honduras in 1524.
   Columbus will be defended by former Honduran Culture Minister 
Rodolfo Pastor Fasquelle. If found guilty, Columbus may be exhumed,
tarred, feathered and then flogged.
   His frostbitten toes will be imported to a bar in Canada to be 
mixed into martinis during happy hour.




THE EZLN'S REVOLUTIONARY LAW FOR WOMEN

The EZLN, in their revolutionary struggle for the liberation of its 
people, incorporates women in the revolutionary struggle regardless
of their race, religion, color, or political affiliation, and with
the only purpose of making theirs the demands of an exploited people
and because of their commitment to bring to realization the laws and
rules of the revolution. Further, taking into consideration the
situation of the working woman in Mexico, their fair demands for
equality and justice are incorporated in the following REVOLUTIONARY
LAW FOR WOMEN:

1) Women, regardless of race, religion or political affiliation,
   have the right to participate in the revolutionary struggle 
   in the location and to whatever degree their will and ability
   determine.
2) Women have the right to work and receive a fair salary.
3) Women have the right to decide the number of children they
   want to have and of whom they can take care.
4) Women have the right to participate in the community affairs
   and to hold political offices if they are elected freely and
   democratically.
5) Women and their children have the right to obtain basic health
   and nutrition.
6) Women have a right to education.
7) Women have the right to choose their mate and to not be forced
   into marriage.
8) No woman may be hit or be physically abused neither by her
   relatives nor strangers. Attempts to rape will be severely
   punished.
9) Women may occupy administrative positions in the organization 
   and they may obtain military rankings in the armed revolutionary
   forces.
10)Women will have all the rights and responsibilities that the
   revolutionary laws and rules indicate.
