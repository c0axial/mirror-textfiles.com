IN HONOR OF WILLIAM JEFFERSON CLINTON, THE
MOST REPUBLICAN DEMOCRAT WE'VE YET TO SEE;

Sanford Bishop Jr, Bob Clement, Gary Condit,
Bud Cramer, Bart Gordon, Ralph Hall, Ken Lucas,
Mike McIntyre, Collin Peterson, James Traficant.

If one of these are your's you might wanna have
a little talk with him.


Hello, welcome to ATI Live. 
From "BEER!" capitol of the world.
I'm your roast, prime anarchist.
And this is the 'zine. Hey all you
skankers, half moon, can you hack it?
0113161244 hrs. 
  ATI. 2,6,8. Who do you confabulate?

Ready for some columnizing?

IF I'M EVER REALLY GOOD AT REMOVING ALL PHYSICAL
VIOLENCE; I THINK I'LL START WORKING ON THE VERBAL.

Swearing, cursing and putting someone down can be 
"useful" tools in oppression. Ashley Montague
wrote about this at great length in a book called
"how to swear" or "how to curse," I don't remember
the exact title.
  [wakeup call for mr. prime anarchist - it's "Anatomy
of Swearing. At least, you got the author right!]
  Another author from a century ago with the ironic
last name of Lynch said some of the same exact things
according to Louis Farrakhan. Something to the effect
of "get each of the minority groups cutting each other
down, building pecking orders and each oppressing the
other, and you'll have a lot less work to do yourself."
  I believed that was true long before I knew who Montague, 
Lynch OR Farrakhan were. To read them just left me saying, 
"aha, that's what it is, ok..."
  I believe with all my heart that hurtful mascot names
are at the very roots of our racism. Because generations
later the exact same sentiments become embedded in our
"socially acceptable" language, perhaps even showing up
as dictionary definitions.
  How subtle it has been that we so quickly forget 
"Reds" might be just as devastating a slam as "Redskins" 
or "Braves." And perhaps a double-whammy slam because 
when we say "reds," none can tell if we're slamming a
"communist" like Mother Jones or Hillary Clinton or 
commUNALists like Crazy Horse or Seattle.
  Once, my ex-wife pointed out during a City Council 
or County Supervisors meeting that the expression "Rule
Of Thumb" is so deeply embedded, that almost none of us
think about where it began. If an American husband beat 
his wife even close to death with a stick smaller than 
his thumb, the evidence would be disallowed from court.
  While trying to remove all violence from my life, 
I've been noticing things like this.

to marc:
Translations of over 200 graffiti from 
the May 1968 revolt in France are online at:

A few examples:
No forbidding allowed.
Be realistic, demand the impossible.
It's painful to submit to our bosses; 
it's even more stupid to choose them.
When examined, answer with questions.

I like the way you converted my cartoon essay 
in a page, along additional text.
Congratulations!
:)
I am sending essay to many high schools in US, 
and already get a message from a student in NY 
who lost his cousin in the Columbine Highs Massacre.
All the best,

Finally, a ballplayer who puts today's 
inflated salaries in perspective!
Thank you Todd.
  NY Mets first baseman Todd Zeile said, "I hear a 
player say 'How can I be paid $5 million less than 
Player B?'  My response to this is 'How can you
make $11 million more than Willie Mays?' "

I think the Little League article touched on 
something central to the way this culture works.  
I'm no expert on the subject but I think there 
might be more (academic) stuff in the same area 
under "the social construction of gender" or 
something like that.

Anyhow here's a link to an interesting Quicktime 
lecture by Sut Jhally, a UMass media professor, 
who has some resemblence politically to Chomsky.

Also, he has some interesting articles:

So Mark (the guy I met at the wrap party last week!) 
did, in fact, CALL ME. I listened to his message several 
times to check for signs of nervousness. He sounded a 
little nervous; he beat around the bush for a long time. 
The message was like 45 seconds long, and he gave me five 
ways to get in touch with him. Home, Office, Cell, Pager 
and E-mail. That about covers it.
  I think I'll make him wait a little. I can always say 
I didn't know how to reach him. Maybe I'll send him a 
fax. This is fun!
XOXOXO

AND THIS JUST IN FROM THE CHESHIRE CATALYST:

  There are a lot of folks who can't understand how 
we came to have an oil shortage here in the USA.
  There's a very simple answer ... nobody bothered 
to check the oil. We Just didn't know we were getting 
low.
  The reason for that is purely geographical. All the 
oil is in Texas, Alaska, Canada, Oklahoma, Wyoming, 
Colorado, etc.
  All the dipsticks are in Washington, D.C.

"one guerrilla of ink and Internet"
  Wow, that translated well.
It was "una guerrilla de tinta e 
internet" in Spanish. I must say
I honestly don't know which one I
like better, the english or el
espanol. Both of these are so, 
so, um; 
so cute.

OPEN LETTER TO JOHN ASHCROFT:
I believe you could solve two major Untied 
States problems at the same time. 
  But you'll run the same risk Gorbachev 
faced when he gave USSR people the vote 
and they voted him out.

Problem: Voter Apartheid 
Problem: School Shootings

Solution: Voting Age 13. 
Popular vote by telephone 
is final and immediate.

Reason: They're already voting with their
fathers' guns. Why not let them use the
ballot box instead???!!!???

  So Mr. Ashcroft. Are you ready to take
anyone but yourself seriously? Are you 
ready to take a serious risk? Solve a 
couple problems, I dare you.

Let democracy ring,
marco

SCAREY AS IT'S BECOME: School Violence Is NOT New
  by Marc Frucht.
  Previously published in ATI Midweek Crisis. March '01


MYSTIC, Conn. 1982. RACE RIOT; FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL.

I will use first names only. Jasmine was dating Darryl.
  Darryl's Afrikan Amerikan; Jasmine Puerto Rican. Darryl 
has a twin brother named Deane. On the basketball court
they were given the nickname Heckel and Jeckel. Back then
I never thought there was much harm in it. They didn't seem
troubled by it either. Craig is White (or "Anglo you could 
say...) and he also has a twin brother Carl. I swear I'm 
not making any of this up. I don't have to. All are seniors 
with me that year. Or was Jasmine a Junior? No she was our
age.
  Craig and Carl would taunt Jasmine endlessly without
mercy from fall 81 until early 82. (maybe February? many
details lost to time and cobwebs and all that) Terms like
"niggerlover," and "oreo cookie" were used just about 
every day for months.

  5TH PERIOD.

  Lunch. I ate "second wave" of three and had a studyhall 
first and third. It was "first wave" and I was walking by 
the cafeteria to get to the men's room when it began. I'll 
make a long story medium sized here and write you the rest
some other time. Craig or Carl called Jasmine a "niggerlover" 
again but this time was different. Darryl or Dean was right
near and actually heard it. They'd said they'd kick some
serious ass if they ever heard it. Only it wasn't one of 
the brothers who began to rumble.
  Jasmine grabbed racism by the throat and said, "call 
me that one more time I'll kick your ass." Well she got 
punched in the head and then all hell broke loose. I 
don't remember who hit who, who pulled out what weapons, 
etc., but the thing blew over to a major standoff that 
was far from peaceful, but at least seemed civil within 
10 or 15 minutes. At least it felt like it. Maybe a little
longer.
  Shortly after that, about 40 local uniformed police 
officers filed in looking all like Dudley Dooright asking
a million questions and spreading additional fear all over
the place for another day and a half or so. Thanks a lot
people! Too little and too late, and the WRONG energy, 
but no one's ready to discuss THAT, are we?

  NEXT DAY...

News Of The Totally Wack (we're NOT makin' any of this up...)

LOS ANGELES ("roto" Reuters) - LA County lawmakers, responding 
to last week's shooting rampage by a teenager at a California 
high school, have passed a law forcing students caught with 
guns or making threats to view dead bodies and watch autopsies 
being performed at the coroner's office.
  Young people need to see the results of violent acts," 
LA County Supervisor Mike Antonovich said. "Far too many 
youngsters are desensitized to violence. They need to realize 
it's not a movie or a video game when someone is shot."
  [wait, I follow this. Kids are far too desensitized these
days, let's shock them out of their zombification. So what if
it desensitizes them even more. I know. At all ambulence
scenes, lets accost everyone under 20 and force them to come
up close and stare until they puke their large intestines out
too...]
