(PUBLISHER'S COLUMN)
   HAPPY MIM!
   In an effort to welcome in 1999, I, Prime Anarchist
ask you which Roman Numerals YOU prefer for this year:
   MCMXCIX, MCMXCVIIII, MDCCCCLXXXXVIIII, OR MIM?
   I for one, prefer MCMXCIX, but that's me. It's completely
up to you, for all is arbitrary -- nothing is "set in
stone." 
   "These are the people who died, died..."
   Sonny Bono, Abe Ribicoff, Ray Nitschke, Bella Abzug, Pol
Pot, Sherry Lewis, James Earl Ray, Eldridge Cleaver, Bebe Robozo,
Barry Goldwater, Dick McDonald, Nguyen Ngoc Loan, Alan Shephard,
George Wallace, Jon Postel, Al Gore Sr, Lawton Chiles, Morris 
Udall, Mathew Shephard, Mike McAlary, Anita Hoffman. 
   I attempted to keep them in date-order for when they expired.
My apologies to the other 40 million or so less "famous" human
beings who passed on in 1998.
   Equal prayers to all.
   Excepting you, Anita. You're in my prayers forever, Auntie.

Can I say I don't like Seagram and Polygram mergering? OK. I'll
say it anyhow. 
   The music industry sucks enough already. Does the word sterile
carry meaning? Now it's assured to be run wholesale by 
purveyors of rotted fruit and vegetable matter. And bad ones at
that. I seldom like mergers, friendly or hostile buyouts and 
takeovers to begin with.
   But this one just leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

A 2nd C-130 was shot down this week over Angola. Am I the 
only 1 2 question these things? 2 C-130's down "right after Desert
Fox." Some dead bodies to dispose of? Do we? 
   Huh? 
   Huh?? Huh!!! 
   Theirs? Ours?
   The C-130 that went down in Angola (said't've hit a mountain...)
right after Desert Storm was reputedly carrying a highly secret
CIA cargo and no people. When that was announced no one asked
further questions. I suggested hundreds of dead bodies over ice, 
if you'll remember. I stood alone.
   Let me end this column describing the job of a C-130. 
   If the bodies are alive it will carry about 100 human beings;
for the US government often-times follows the Geneva Convention 
rules of engagement. 
   If the humans are dead a C-130 carries three hundred and change.
   Allow me to end this column vomiting my *&%$ing guts out.

He didn't see me roll my eyes but just about everyone in the 
IHOP did and began laughing. We all shared a laugh, even old 
pinky-in-the-brain-stem; of course not knowing it was at
> his expense. He went back to his coffee, but not without 
sharing another fist in the air and an Airborne RuHah! with, 
I think god, or his dead buddies, or something because he looked 
around the room to see who was with him and they (we) were 
all (each) looking somewhere else.

a Crass is besides maybe a rude comment. I sat down and got 
back to my coffee and my tuna-melt; and the hackerfriends I was 
hanging out with just thought it was the funniest IHOP incident 
since the time Chris Eliot from "Get a Life" and "Something 
About Mary" told me to "...go fuck [yourself]..." (his words, 
not mine.)

Great story, let's hear the Chris Elliot one.
        
        
ALSO RECEIVED AT ATI@ETEXT.ORG :

        Not so funny, but not unexpected either.  
        In America, it just isn't "Christmas" unless we 
        put up a tree, toss the bums a dime, buy tons of
        useless plastic, stuff our fat faces, and have a 
        bunch of "our boys" somewhere overseas, "fighting 
        for peace" (like "fucking for virginity"), so we 
        can all send "daddy" holiday greetings via satellite 
        and cry the big tear while we sing "I'll Be Home For 
        Christmas".  For those of you who haven't figured this 
        out yet, just pay closer attention next year.
        Merry Christmas.

Here is an idea for a political cartoon involving Iraq.  
Feel free to use it without attribution or recompense.
It's a one-panel cartoon.  As I envision it, on the 
right side is a sort of geographical border marked "Iraq".  
Inside this (over it) stands a hoard of emaciated children, 
clutching at a large bone labeled "food, health, education".  
At the left side of the panel stands President Clinton, 
pointing at the bone.  At his feet is a little 
bulldog with the head of Tony Blair.  
The caption is: "Fetch!"

some alternative lyrics
to a well-known Christmas song:
By Some Friend of John Sloan's.
(E)                         
Good King Wenceslaus pigged out, 
(A)
On a feast named Stephen,
(E)                         
When the snow lay 'round a-bout, 
(A)
deep and crisp and even.
(E)                          
Brightly shouted thus the King, 
(A)
(tho' he was quite cru-el),
(E)    (A)  (E)   (B7)    
Then a poor man  came in sight,

We now end with poetry by GirlX0
Here is a poem I've written.  
It's kind of weird.  
I call it 
"Good-bye to a mockery of the heart"

 Dreams of that fruity place,
  Odd bouquets of flowers that frame my face.
 
  A waterfall fantasy that cascades the view,
  A sweet exchange...from me to you.
  
 "A kiss in the dark won't bring any harm",
  I whisper to you, your face becomes alert, but not in alarm.
 
 A fuzzy, serene feeling...a passing of love,
  Like the feel of your hand in a satin glove.
 
  The warmth, the tingle...aaw sweet joyous senses,
  With one little action, all evil for that moment condenses.
  
  You break our lock and begin to utter a word,
  I silence the sounds with another kiss, 
                    some things just must go unheard.
  
  I smile, so sweet and look at the dreamscape.  
               I leave, not turning back,
  That rouge smile on your face...my heart cannot, 
              will not once more take that attack.
  
  I can hear the ground as you begin to follow, a mock protest,
 But as it should be...the masquerade is put arest.
 
  We both know, maybe not in my mind...but in my heart,
 The play of my life, love isn't your part.
  
 You've already cast yourself as evil with your cheats and lies,
  Such evil isn't even forgivable...even if it had soft blue eyes.
  
  Through evil, you've taught me much,
  I know now the part of lead  
            love must have more than a soft touch.

  Walking into reality, out of your illusion,
  How will I ever find who I truly need 
                     amongst this confusion?

From the biography of President John Quincy Adams:
If only mankind could have the leadership it needed. 
Yet Adams found that history showed how unlikely 
this was because so many superior statesmen ultimately 
had been ruined by a passion for women.
This pernicious vice, he claimed, was particularly 
deplorable in persons of high station, where it was 
often uncontrollable, leaving potentially great men 
with no more than the disgrace of a goat.
