SWEDISH FINANCE MINISTER GETS JUST DESSERT! 
        
  EU Finance Ministers were meeting in the 
Swedish city of Malmö for the Informal ECOFIN
Meeting April 20 - 22. 
  Demonstrations, actions and lectures were all 
planned in a mini counter-summit. Leading up to 
the Stockholm events, the Swedish Finance Minister, 
Bosse Ringholm, presented the spring 2001 Swedish 
state budget. Processing on his way to the presentation, 
Ringholm was pied, not only once, but twice. In a press 
release, Stockholms Tårtbrigade (Stockholms Pie Brigade) 
took credit for providing the early dessert. An irritated 
Ringholm told news reporters that "This is the kind of 
thing you do when arguments no longer work!" AFA-Sweden 
commented by saying, "How right you are Mr. Ringholm!"

  Hi, I'm prime anarchist and this is the e-zine for
Saturday, April 28, 2001. Or was it Sunday, Ap... or
Monday the first quarter moon... yeah, whatever.
  First up we got the usual numbers and letters, than
we have some news oriented treats for you. Or was that
treat oriented news? Yeah, what he said. But even before
"first up," (yeah, so early he's taking warmup swings)
I've got:

PREDICTION:
  Earthquake near Quebec on or before May 20 of this year.
  College-Beer-Oriented Riots in Quebec by next Mardi Gras.

Oh, and this seems like the week of the "Open Letter" format. 
You'll see what I mean shortly.

And now to the rest of my column. 
  Wonders never cease. Guess what error message I got today
in my Windows machine? "This is not a bootable floppy. Replace
and press any key when ready." Now I wouldn't bring this up,
because it's the right error for what was wrong. I had a floppy
in the A drive (which is at the top of my set priorities before
booting from the hard-drive.) which only contained txt files.
  But I bring it up because every other time I've ever powered
this machine with a floppy in the A drive that didn't have a
command.com in it, I get any of half a dozen random, arbitrary
erroneous error message and I go, "oh yeah, right. That means
I have a floppy in there that's not bootable."
  You ever worry right after something works RIGHT for the
first time of it's life?
  I have to ask you about P.J. Squares. (t.m.) Made with 
fresh roasted peanuts and fruit juice. 10 slices (1.2 oz. ea.) 
Yes, that's 12 oz of something in a shrink-wrap that makes it 
look exactly like kraft sandwich slices. You know, the kind 
with so much preservative added to the casseinate that you 
won't have to ever refrigerate them. Only THESE slices you 
have to refrigerate. Hmmm. There must be some food in here 
then. 
  Or is there?
  Let's turn over the package for our answer. "What is a
PJ Square?" it asks, or more to the point suggests.
  "Fresh roasted peanuts on one side and Strawberry on
the other. It's the quickest, neatest, easiest way to 
make a P-nutty an' Yummy sandwich!"
  This is apparently a busy parent's dream. Just slap
a piece of wonderbread on a piece of glad-wrap, open
up one of these slices of foodstuff, slap it on the 
bread, take out one more piece of bread, fold up the
plastic, stuff it in one of those brown paper bags,
add apple or pear to taste and voila! Quick, easy lunch.
  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!
  What the fuck are we doing to ourselves? This is a
perfect way to make our children ever so much MORE the
Columbine-leaning; and we don't even notice, do we???
DUMB, PEOPLE, DUMB. BAD MOVE. AN ASSEMBLY LINE FOR OUR
KID'S SCHOOL LUNCHES. YEAH, I KNOW. PERFECT. ALL THE 
REASON TO HAVE 7.9 MORE CHILDREN. YES, THERE'S ALMOST
8 MORE SLICES IN THIS PACKAGE. Or wait, I'll keep the
2.1 I've got and buy one package a week. And yes, the
.1 child'll just have to feel left out once in a while.
I'll instruct that one to make a leftover turkey or
ham sandwich while I'm poppin' out these perfectly
popular PJ Squares.
  But wait, there's an underlying revenge tucked in
this underdog scenario, isn't there?
  "What did your mom make?"
  "Boloney, see?"
  "Oh, yeah, well at least she used Hellmans and 
not that Miracle Whip, stuff."
  "But I like Miracle Whip."
  "Yeah? Then I'll trade you this Roast Beast and
Hellmans for your Baloney and Miracle... wait, what
did your little brother just..."
  "I said, ALL I GOT WAS A FRIGGIN' SLICE OF PEANUT
HONKIN' APPLEJUICE THING ON TWO PIECES OF PROCESSED
FLOUR! MY MOTHER HATES ME, I'M GONNA..."
  "No, put down that rocket launcher, Dylan, it's
not worth it. Don't risk detention, Dylan."
  "Thad, she always loved you more. Who's gonna 
trade me ANYTHING for a PJ Square friggin samwich???"

of the music scene in L.A.

freepress: I asked you before to go somewhere else and 
investigate on your own which 3 government agents

like "all of black block are cia."

/so we can suck  even  MORE /
money out of you all.      /


Congratulations to Phil Collins for finding someone 1/3 his
age to have a baby with. Born today, this kid will likely
inherit about 1/4 of the entire music cartel for the entire
planet. 
  Imagine that you get a record deal and find out that the
person who owns the person who owns the person who owns 
the company who owns the person who owns the company who
owns Bertlesmann who owns Napster, AOL, Warner-Lambert
Bros, Newsweek, Chivas Regal, Chrysler, Taco Bell, Star-

SHARED PERSONAL LETTER TO BOB KERREY

Dear Mr Kerrey,
  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Thank you for your own personal healing.
Thank you for being the next big facilitator
in this vastly ill Nation's healing, and
thank you for finally allowing the families
of some of the people you've harmed that
they may begin healing also.
  Toward the end of my military career,
I was home in Connecticut visiting my mom,
and sister, my girlfriend, etc. I happened
on a man on Route 1 in Mystic with a plate
in his head who was 100% disabled because
of shrapnel he'd taken during Nam. He 
apparently has been holding two signs up
in Mystic and also in New London almost
every day since the late 70's without fail.
One sign says "No More Vietnams," and the
other, Mr. Kerrey, says "What About The 
Children?"
  I talked with him a little and found out
what made him tick, and asked him why he
was doing this. Mr. Kerrey, he handed me
a George Mizo poem.
  This poem changed me so much I've done
two things since. 
  1) carried the poem he gave me in my 
wallet for the rest of my life.
  2) scanned it's tattered remains in as
a .jpg so I have it on the net.

It's at: http://flag.blackened.net/ati/mizo.jpg
in case you'd like to look at it, and I'll type
it in here in case you'd rather just see the 
text.

Sincerely,
marco

    ====
and Kerrey replies:

And my thanks right back to you.

Don't blame ME for this one. I'm just passing it 
along, since the concepts are interesting.

To be a good "Liberal":

1.. You have to believe the AIDS virus is 
not spread by personal behavior choices 
but by a lack of federal funding.

2.. You have to believe that the same teacher 
who can't teach 4th graders how to read is 
somehow qualified to teach those same kids 
about sex.

3.. You have to believe that guns in the hands 
of law-abiding Americans are more of a threat 
than U.S. nuclear weapons technology in the 
hands of Chinese communists.

4.. You have to believe that there was no art 
before Federal funding.

5.. You have to believe that global temperatures 
are less affected by cyclical, documented changes 
in the earth's climate, and more affected by
yuppies driving SUVs.

6.. You have to believe that gender roles are 
artificial, but being homosexual is natural.

7.. You have to be against capital punishment, 
but support abortion on demand.

8.. You have to believe that businesses create 
oppression, and governments create prosperity.

9.. You have to believe that hunters don't care 
about nature, but activists who've never been 
outside of Seattle do.

10.. You have to believe that self-esteem is more 
important than actually doing something to earn it.

11.. You have to believe the military, not corrupt 
politicians, starts wars.

12.. You have to believe the NRA is bad, because it 
supports certain parts of the Constitution, while 
the ACLU is good, because it supports certain
parts of the Constitution.

13.. You have to believe that taxes are too low, 
but ATM fees are too high.

14.. You have to believe that Margaret Sanger and 
Gloria Steinem are more important to American history 
than Thomas Jefferson, General Robert E. Lee, or 
Thomas Edison.

15.. You have to believe that standardized tests are 
racist, but racial quotas and set-asides aren't.

16.. You have to believe that the only reason 
socialism hasn't worked anywhere it's been tried, 
is because the right people haven't been in charge.

17.. You have to believe conservatives telling the 
truth belong in jail, but liars and sex offenders 
belong in the White House.

18.. You have to believe that homosexual parades 
displaying drag queens, transvestites and bestiality 
should be constitutionally protected and manger
scenes at Christmas should be illegal.

19.. You have to believe that illegal Democratic 
party funding by the Chinese is somehow in the best 
interest of the United States.

20.. You have to believe that a crucifix submerged 
in urine is art, while a crucifix in a classroom is 
a threat to our constitutional freedom.

LINER NOTES
  "Most creepy about the Monday hearing [Jaggi Singh] 
was the description of the infiltration of this political 
collective. Police testified they had been surveilling 
the group for several months. Aware that one guy was 
looking for a job, they created a fake company and 
advertised for a delivery person. He was hired and 
found himself driving food between Montreal and Quebec 
City -- with a cop in the same car! The two ended up 
being "friends" and in this way the cop got access to 
the whole group of anarchist militants, and participated 
in the strategizing for the upcoming Summit.

You, my church, told me it was wrong to kill... except in war.
You, my teachers, told me it was wrong to kill... except in war.
You, my father & mother, told me it was wrong to kill... except in war.
you, my friends, told me it was wrong to kill... except in war.
You my country, told me it was wrong to kill... except in war.

You sent me to war to kill...
And when I had no choice...
You told me I was wrong.

But now I know, you were wrong...
And now I will tell you...
