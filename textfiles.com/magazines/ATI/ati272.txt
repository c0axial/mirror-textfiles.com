"In the 1960's the police used to talk about "outside agitators" 
causing problems in otherwise peaceful demonstrations so that 
they could justify riding in on horses clubbing young people
whose only crime was opposing the war in Viet Nam. The
strategy of creating the evil few to repress the many is a very 
old one. Don't buy it."

Hi, I'm Prime Anarchist and this is the news you
need:

Apparently, there is a court order suppressing Idependent
Media Center from broadcasting or posting anything about 
the FBI raiding the Seattle IMC on Saturday evening while 
Quebec is in choas. Hey you constitutional attornies. Get 
out of bed and march over to the fbi or supreme court and 
let em know that these rights will not be suppressed.

I had some other things I wanted to compose for this 
issue but they'll have to wait. Time is of the essence,
they always say.

at the very last minute the management of the 
slipper room has informed us that they have 
canceled this sunday's klong show because they 
had a more lucrative offer to rent out the room 
that evening.
  so, there is no klong show tomorrow, sunday 
april 22.  
  additionally, we are putting the klong show 
on hold until we can find a venue that is a bit 
more supportive.  please stay tuned for the 
imminent re-launch of The Klong Show.

a poem for the corporate media 
by Oak
Warrior Poet Society - Planet Earth

You heard it here first:
  [editor's note: well, second. This
is a reprint from Vermont Indy]
Why allow the mainstream media to set the limits 
of debate or coin our phrases? We say: the light 
at the end of the corporados global tunnel is the 
oncoming train; a train WRECK IN QUEBEC ! 

    WRECK IN QUEBEC 
    a poem for the corporate media 


    the mainstream tabloids 
    must get hemmroids 
    from lifting all that hype, 
    here in the trenches 
    beyond the fences 
    we're compelled to take a swipe, 
    at network boardrooms 
    endless hair grooms 
    and your basic corporate type, 
    so what the heck 
    a wreck in quebec 
    was not the time quite ripe?




BAGHDAD, Iraq (PAWN) -- Iraq has warned Iran that its 
missile attack on eastern Iraq risked a revival of
1980-88 when Reagan and Bush bombarded each other 
with epithets, swears and bad language like, "Voodoo
Economics," and "Damn Yale Bastard," "Nice Toupe,
Rawhide," and "Dumb Yankee Bastard."
  Iran has acknowledged its armed forces attacked 
Iraqi bases of the rebel Mujahedeen Khalq on Wednesday 
morning because they "miss that old Ronnie Reagan guy,
maybe W Bush will respond in kind." The acknowledgment 
came in a letter delivered to the U.N. Security Council 
in New York late Wednesday.
  The attack killed three people and wounded 23 others, 
Iraqi official media and the Mujahedeen Khalq said 
Thursday. All but one of the casualties were Iraqis.
  "His name was Truth," said Ramses Clarkent. 
  Iranian state television reported the attack Thursday, 
but gave no word of casualties.




A Parody Ending To Help Keep You Going.
  by Robert Cox

To the tune your "National" Anthem

And the the teargas canisters, 
Water cannons everywhere,
Gave proof through the night 
Revolution's in the air.
O say, does that red-black banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free
And I mean it this time; free.



We end with a folksong.
[ed note: it's always nice when we 
can get all "broadsidish" on you.]

With Wall Street on our Side
Original words by Bob Dylan
New words by Doug Wheeler

C F C F C  F G F C
C                F Em        F           C
Oh my name it is nothing' my age it mean less
                          F          C
The company I work for is in the  Midwest
                              F           C
I'm forced to agree there the policies to abide
                   F G               F             C
And that company I work for has Wall Street on its side.


Oh the Journal it tells it and it tells it so well
The stockholders sniffled and the workers all fell
Yes, the stockholders sniffled and morale all died
And that company I work for has Wall Street on its side.

Oh the lowliest workers all had thier day
And then middle management was soon laid away
And the names of the CEOs I was made to memorize 
With a bonus in their hands and Wall Street on their side.

The First Quarter came, boys it closed out its fate
The reason for the layoffs I never got straight
But I learned to accept it, accept it in stride
Oh you don't count the missing when Wall Street's on your side.

But now we got workers left standing in the dust
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must
One click of the mouse and emailed the world wide
And you never ask questions when Wall Street's on your side

In a many dark hour I've been thinking' about this
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
Whether Judas Iscariot, had Wall Street on his side.

When the Stock Market Slide comes to an end
We'll forgive the bosses and call them our friends
Though they fired six million, on the dole they all dried.
The new bosses now too have Wall Street on their side.

I've learned to trust no one, all through my work life
If another crash comes, It's them we must fight
To hate them and fear them and in my cube hide
And accept it all bravely with Wall Street on our side. 

So now as I'm leaving', I'm weary as hell
The confusion I'm feelin' ain't no tongue can tell
Who words fill my head and fall to the floor
If the Street's on our side then just shut the door.
