HOW TO ANNOY A CLERK: At 2AM On A
Week Night. 
	     by prime anarchist
  Before shutting the door behind 
you, look at the sticker on the 
door-jam that shows you're 5'7" 
tall in technicolor blue and red. 
  Shout out that you're 5'10" and
insist that their chart is wrong.
(unless of course you ARE 5'10", then
insist you're something else -- your
pick)
  Suggest the person who put it up
must've gotten ahold of some bad crack.
Tell them they'd better have it
corrected by the next time you come 
back or you're going to call the BBB.
  Don't forget to tell them you're just
kidding at some point, or you might 
ruin their trip.
  Remember to thank them and tell them
to have a nice day. Mean it, even if
you get a sense they don't.

Greetings and welcome to ATI179.
Activist Turning-Points International.
SunDay May 23, 1999. It's 4:30 pm. Do 
you know where your politicians are?

Here's the Activist Times Publisher's
Column, then we have the usual letters
and #'s runs. And some PAWN, and etc.
Enjoy,
.ati.

I see and hear my God recognizes yours.
Can you say the same about "your's?"

Just a question.

I'm watching "MOTHER THERESA: In The
Name Of God's Poor."
Can I tell you how weird it is to 
view this, tears rolling down my
cheeks and every time a doorbell or
phone rings at the shelter I live in
and run, I see Ted Kennedy's
fat shiny Oil Of Olay face on C-Span2
discussing Juvenile Crime bills
whenever I hit STOP? Cough, cough, 
tus, tus. Sounds like old Eddie
has TB. Nice glasses by the way. Do
they cost more than my life? How many
meals could I cook with that gorgious
silk tie of yours that attempts to 
colorize your grey face and dark puffy
eyes? How many silk ties do you own, 
Ted. How many coats? 
I don't dare say half of how I feel:
I'm not allowed to judge.
   You point at percentages of mothers
and fathers on an easle, all red, white
and blue looking; looking like Ross
Perot, Ted. Ted, Ted, I wish I could
shake you, you're not hearing, you're
not seeing, you're not asking ANY OF
THE RIGHT QUESTIONS. Shut up and listen.
   Feed the poor Ted. Boston, Hartford,
Providence Ted. Brooklyn, Worcester,
Bridgeport. Feed the hungry Ted. Shut
up and sell your tie. Cook a meal.
You are no help thus far, Ted. 
Represent us! Listen to your heart. 
Feed the poor. If you don't have the 
courage to truly speak for your people,
than at least have the courage to step
down and let someone who can: do.
   That said, that expressed, I change
the channel so I no longer have to 
watch this verbal shit every time I
pause. Yuck, feck, blech. 
   A good juvenile justice bill? Feed
children free. No strings attached.
But you all aren't ready for that yet,
are you? Have a nice meeting you
yuppie pukes!

I can't recommend this movie enough,
by the way, I didn't mean this as a 
movie review but here goes. I've cried
at least 6 times now, and she hasn't even
gone from Sisterhood to Motherhood yet.
Holy wah. What a good movie.

I didn't know she was born in Albania.
She was nine when her dad died. Hmmm.
Attn: NATO, take a letter. 
Dear England,
Dear US. You desecrate Princess Diana
with every smart bomb you insert into
Serbia region. Can't you see this?
Don't you hear? Don't you feel? Your
bi-lateral genocide is not working.
It accomplishes nothing but suffering
and death, destruction and desecration.
How many songs must I sing you before
you face your demons America, England,
Canada. NATO, the people calling you
NAZI are bitter, they are resentful.
I harbor no fear, no bitterness or
resentment. Nothing but love when I
tell you this.
   Name of God, NATO. When will the
bloodshed end? How about show me one
tiny sign?
   How about closing the SOA. How about
searching your heart for a peaceful
solution in Serbia, in Iraq, 
in Somalia, Lebanon, Timor, Tibet;
in Chiapas. On the Navajo reservation. 
I make no distinctions, Amerika.
Shame on your each and every 
seperation. Each bomb. Each
starving human on this planet.
Shame shame. Thank you, thank you,
thank you. Just search, you'll find
it. You're not looking hard enough.
   Oh and Secretary Cohen. 
Take a short note. 
You suck.
   Love,
Prime Anarchist

Greetings,

Since I'm Dineh and this Turtle Island 
(North America) is my ancient country, 
I have every right to state my opinion 
and refer to any government official 
as appropriately as possible. 
No apologies necessary.

First Lady, "Hilter" R. Clinton is no 
different then all the other leaders
of this 'male-dominated' society. 
The Big Mountain Sovereign Dineh Nation
resistors, mostly women elders, have 
written numerous letters to this high
government official. There was several 
personal but official letters that
members of the Weaving for Freedom 
(Dineh weavers collective) sent to 
the First Lady, asking for her 
to visit the weavers homelands and 
witness the situation that 
the resistors are subjected to. 

The First Lady's secretarial office 
have responded but there was no direct
response from the First Lady. However, 
despite all the important letters
brought to her attention she chose 
to "preserve" asphalt-nature trails 
at the Grand Canyon and a rusty 
telescope that sits on a hill in 
Flagstaff, Arizona. She stopped in 
Flagstaff last night just to take 
a look at Mars and at another star. 
Her speech basically stated that 
it is most important to save every 
"treasure" that is endangered throughout 
America. Last night in Flagstaff she said, 
"There are many places, just like in your 
own back yards, that are facing endangerment. 
These very unqiue sites are well-documented, 
many have accumulated archealogical 
information and many of the sites still 
hold hundreds of artifacts. So, I just want 
to make all of you aware that, we should 
not just take this for granted."  
Mrs. "Hilter" R. Clinton obviously doesn't 
think that the last traditional society 
like in Big Mountain is endangered, 
or that it should be considered as 
a treasure. 

As Americans, I would like to suggest 
to you all and others to immediately
write to the First Lady that she missed 
a natural society (that is only an 80 mile 
helicopter ride from Flagstaff) which 
needs their culture and land perserved. 
Tell her that she definitely knew where 
she was at, and her ignorance shows an 
overall "American mentality" of denial at
the 'ethnic cleansing' that is occurring 
in this country. Anyway, just state to
her in a kindly manner then, how I have 
stated my feelings.

Again, thank you to all for your time.

Hey, 
I was looking through my many back 
issues of ATI and I found that #9 
was completely missing. Beatles 
conection, or was I gypped?  
If I was gypped you'll all pay, 
ya hear ($1,000,000,000 in euros, 
or you could just send me #9 your 
choice).  
If I wasn't gypped than forget 
all those stupid threats.

HEALTH TIP #7
  Organic lemons are small and fit
nicely in a front pocket.
  Take one along with you to add to
what they call lemonade these days.
Use a buck knife or a key-chain knife
to cut it in half, squeeze it in and
voila! Real Lemonade.

PAGE 65!
  a 'zine review.
  I'm not going to review Cool Beans
#10 in traditional way. Why? I don't
feel like it. Who do you think I am,
FS5? MR&R? 
  OK, I'll say one thing - awesome!
Fun to read. I more than LOL'd I 
laughed so loud people thought I was
crazy. LOLPTYCAS (laugning out loud;
people thinkin' you're crazy & shit)
  I'll say one more thing. Page 65.
  The recurring theme of that page'd
have to be Hostess Twinkies. 
  I'm not focussing on the rest of the
page, just Elizabeth Karp's word-find.
I usually don't find word-finds to be
very fun. In fact, I've done entire
Dell Books issues full of them before,
usually at the beach in July, when I
was a kid, and I'd finish up thinking
"why'd I just do an entire Dell Book's
issue of them?"
  But this one takes the cake.
  Sugar, hohos, diglycerides, 
leavenings: wow. No way. 
  Whey! I'm in stitches. Cool Beans!
  Metaphorically speaking on a scale
1-10 where would you put Cool Beans
issue 10. Well, where would you? Well?
  Perfect.

Imagine a bagel: fresh, soft, 
satisfying. Now imagine a bagel
sandwich made by McDonald's: hearty,
flavorful, fresh-baked each morning.
If you live near one of the many 
US restaurants testing our new break
fast bagel sandwiches, you don't have
to imagine for long. Created to give
customers tasty new choices for bkfst,
our bagel sandwiches are offered in the
flavorful combinations of steak, egg
and cheese; ham, egg and cheese; and 
Spanish omelet with sausage and cheese.
Bagels as only McDonald's can make
them...white bread with a hole... just
another reason to brighten your 
mornings at the Golden Arches.

ASOA-ALLSTARS: Three Kewl Lists To

to close.)
CT
HI
MA
ME
MN
NJ
NY
OR
RI
WI

  The following is a list of states
which are particularly BAD for shutting
down this archaic old-world cold-war
tool of genocide, repression and all
around bad mood.
  If you know anyone who lives in these
states please express your sympathy,

to bug the bejezus our of 'em?

  Finally, here's a Prime Anarchist
Poop List.
  I don't mean any ill will toward
these human beings, just that they
really suck and they'd better "change
[their] evil ways," as Carlos Santana
would have it.
  A visit by the ghosts of Genocides
past, present and plu-perfect might 
help these dweebs vote to shut down 
SOA. 
  Or they could stay poops. I'll let
them remain spineless but NOT nameless.

<PAWN>-
Baltimore, MD. General "Uncle" Sam
Scheister has retired. Effective Jan
1, 1999 the general announced his last
day on the job will be Dec 31, of the
same year. The 41 year old 
"commissioned" said this is just an
early retirement and he expects little
or no pension.
  "Who cares," said Scheister. "I'll
get mine here and there. I'm a quick
thinker. Basically I just had a change
of heart and decided to misquote Phil
Ochs, my favorite dead poet."
  Scheister's misquote goes "I ain't
workin' anymore."
  Scheister announced his hand picked
successor as Colonel William B. Strike
from the 3rd of the 77th Calvary. He
will pin his rank Dec. 30, at the end
of a traditional 3-day drunken brawl
and General Strike will begin the end
of the year.
  Strike could not be reached for 
comment but his answering machine had 
this to say.
  "Soon to be General Strike. You know
the drill. Hey that's the end of the
millenium too.
  "Leave it at the <beep>."

Well, that's the whole of ATI issue 179.
Thank you, & have a nice day.
