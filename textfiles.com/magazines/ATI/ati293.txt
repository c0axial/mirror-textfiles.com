Breaking news!

No way.

You're not going to believe this.

A couple of planes slammed into the World Trade Center
twin towers and within a couple hours both of them went
straight down into a pile of rubble looking almost like
there never was anything there before.

No, really. I just realized it. Feels like it just happened
a minute or two ago. Or an hour maybe, but a day? Three 
weeks?
  Wow.
  Three full weeks later it finally "hits" me.
  The numbness wears off, while I'm reading page 2 of
Last week's Onion Newspaper out of Madison.

Arab-American Third-Grader Returns From Recess Crying, 
Saying He Didn't Kill Anyone
ROYAL OAK, MI - Eddie Bahri, 8, a Lincoln Elementary School third-grader 
of Iraqi descent, tearfully denied accusations during morning recess 
Tuesday that he was a terrorist who killed a bunch of people. "I did 
not kill anybody," Bahri told classmate Douglas Allenby. "And my dad 
didn't, either, okay?" Also implicated in the Sept. 11 attacks was 
9-year-old Rajesh Soonachian, a Lincoln Elementary fourth-grader 
of Indian descent.

I remember that feeling vividly from my gradeschool years.
5th or 6th grade to be specific.
  My catholic next door neighbors (two brothers) used to hold
me down on the ground and bloody my face really badly each 
day after school telling me I killed Christ because I'm half
jewish.
  Yes, 30-40 times in a row. 5 days a week. Until the older
one beat his dad nearly to death one day and ran away.
  "Where's your brother?" I asked on the way home from
school that next day, my first in a long time not going home
to wash blood away.
  "He ran away," he told me "stole $300 off my dad and took
off on his motor scooter." I just smiled all the way home.
  I went over and knocked on their door right after dinner.
  "Is ______ home, Mrs. ___?"
  "Sure, Markie," she said, "I'll go get hi..."
  "Don't tell him who I am, Mrs. ___, I want it to be a surprise."
The same smile from on the way home on my lips.
  When he came out onto the porch to look I hid behind a
wicker chair until he was just next to the steps almost off
the porch already.
  I punched him really hard in the face about three times. Threw
him down about eight stairs and then kicked at him quite a few
too many times while telling him not only am I NOT a Christ 
killer, but nothing can save him OR his brother after what they 
put me through for a month and a half. They taunted me daily
after that until the day their upper enlisted navy dad got
relocated, but never fought me again. I saw the one my age
about 10 years later, and if I remember right he made either
a pass or an advance at me and was moderately respectful when
I said no, but he never contacted me again.
  Did beating the tar out of him solve much? Not really, but
it sure did feel good at the time.

While that memory was hammering me, I began reading the next
Onion story that went:

 [WARNING]  ]MIDWEEK CRISIS REPRINT[
In the wake of the recent national tragedy, President Bush is urging
Mariah Carey, Michael Jackson, and other singers to resist the urge 
to record mawkish, insipid all-star tribute ballads. 
  "To America's recording artists, I just want to say, please, there
has already been enough suffering," Bush said. "The last thing we need 
right now is a soaring Barbra Streisand-Brian McKnight duet titled 'One 
For All.'" Reports that the FBI had confiscated several notebooks and 
audio tapes from Diane Warren's home could not be confirmed as of press 
time.
 ]/MIDWEEK CRISIS REPRINT[ [/WARNING] 

Diane Warren. Yes. My age. She's already...

   THAT'S WHEN IT HIT ME. FOR THREE WEEKS I ONLY KNEW
WE LOST OUR WORLD TRADE CENTER ON 5 OR 6 LEVELS. MAYBE
50 LEVELS EVEN, BUT IT HADN'T SUNK IN FULLY. JUST THEN
IT DID.

Warren. She's already gotten 110 Top-40 hits. 109 and 
110 are both the same song too! Yup. "I Don't Wanna 
Miss a Thing" by Aerosmith and also by Mark Chestnut.
  What matters anymore?? 
  Since long before the Pentagone - Trapezoid - Twin -
Miscarriages. Long before that. The world had ended
long ago.
  Seriously - it was over years ago. The rest is just
follow through. Walking dead. Thriller. Zombies.
  Michael Jackson is broke, but 2 years ago he took out
a loan the size of most countries' national debts. Lita
Ford is bitter. She's STILL waiting for R&R to come back
to life. Well, ummm. er, hum. Hey, Lita. to quote a song
from my teenage years that might even have been Diane
Warren's first hit, "Dream on."
  Elton John is making a comeback too. That's how you know.
Paul McCartney's kinda broke too. How did THAT happen?
Here's a guy who can spend more per day than Sikorsky,
Hasbro and Colt Firearms combined. How is HE broke???
  And of course you should've known the world ended last
Oct. when Ted Nugent stumped for Bush/Cheney and Jon
Bon Jovi stumped for Gore/Leiberman and Patty Smith 
stumped for Nader/Laduke. I honestly don't know what's
dumber, Nugent stumping for anyone, or just plain
George "W" Bush himself.
  Britney Spears just co-wrote five new songs. Like I 
said, the rest is follow-thru!! I can't wait to get
my hands on next week's Billboard so I can find out
how many middle-aged white men co-wrote each Hitme
song? I think Chrissy Aguilar's newest had a whopping
9 people cowriting it. Remember that? How the heck 
do that many people write a song? Do each people hit
one black key and one white key??
  I could go long here, but I"m ending this with a very
short Lee Greenwood song-rewrite.
  
  I'm proud to be an American
  Where at least I know I'm free
  And no matter what may happen
  I can pick between coke & pepsi.

So there, Rock & Roll died a painful, horrific, gnasing of
teeth, popping sound, sulfur smelling death long before
VOLUNTEERS 2001 (tm), long before NET AID (tm), way before 
FARM AID 3 IN 3D.
  At least as early as when Elvis became an FBI operative,
R&R was dying off. The rest is follow through. No, better
word choice: the rest is republican (pronounced bi-partisan)
politics.

And punk?

Oh, don't get me started.

Next topic?

Yeah, it's just starting to sink in. The WTC is dead. Long 
live the WTC.
  Pundits who wrote ANYTHING (and that goes for me too!) the
last couple three weeks should just pretend they never even
wrote it, because any day now it's gonna sink in for them too.
  Yikes.
  Take my word for it. Most of you are still numb. Don't say
a word. Not even an "I'm sorry," or a "I feel your pain..."
  Just sit there with the dead body, comfort the living. This
is no time for words. Say less. Do even less. Just be there;
let silence save the day. We're going to need as much silence
as we can get these next few decades.
  Silence.

Ah,

Oh,

Mmm,

"..."

Silence. Breath in, breath out.
  Rinse, repeat.


Basically, the Untied States just last month for the first time
in our short history have joined the world community. We can
no longer say we have no way to relate to the death squads and
terrorisms that have been recycling the world over for the past
couple millenia. We can no longer say we've never been attacked
on our own soil. It just may come to pass that we can no longer
salute covering one eye signalling to the rest of the world that
we've "never lost in battle."

That's still to be seen. For now we're an open salted vinegarred
wound with legs and ears. And fists.

I'll end this midweek rant with one last TheOnion (tm) reprint.

]MIDWEEK REPRINT[==][CRISIS REPRINT[==][MIDWEEK CRISIS REPRINT[

GOD ANGRILY CLARIFIES 'DON'T KILL' RULE
  Responding to recent events on Earth, God, the omniscient creator-deity 
worshipped by billions of followers of various faiths for more than 6,000 
years, angrily clarified His longtime stance against humans killing each 
other Monday. 
  "Look, I don't know, maybe I haven't made myself completely clear, so 
for the record, here it is again," said the Lord, His divine face betraying 
visible emotion during a press conference near the site of the fallen Twin 
Towers. "Somehow, people keep coming up with the idea that I want them to 
kill their neighbor. Well, I don't. And to be honest, I'm really getting 
sick and tired of it. Get it straight. Not only do I not want anybody to 
kill anyone, but I specifically commanded you not to, in really simple terms 
that anybody ought to be able to understand."

   "...I tried to put it in the simplest possible terms for you people, so 
you'd get it straight, because I thought it was pretty important," said God, 
called Yahweh and Allah respectively in the Judaic and Muslim traditions. 
"I guess I figured I'd left no real room for confusion after putting it in 
a four-word sentence with one-syllable words, on the tablets I gave to Moses. 
How much more clear can I get?"  ...
  ...praised the overwhelming majority of His Muslim followers as "wonderful, 
pious people," calling the perpetrators of the [attacks] rare exceptions.
  ..."This whole medieval concept of the jihad, or holy war, had all but 
vanished from the Muslim world in, like, the 10th century, and with good reason," 
God said. "There's no such thing as a holy war, only unholy ones. The vast 
majority of Muslims in this world reject the murderous actions of these 
radical extremists, just like the vast majority of Christians in America 
are pissed off over those two bigots on The 700 Club."
  ...Growing increasingly wrathful, God continued: "Can't you people see? 
What are you, morons? There are a ton of different religious traditions 
out there, and different cultures worship Me in different ways. But the 
basic message is always the same: Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, 
Shintoism... every religious belief system under the sun, they all say 
you're supposed to love your neighbors, folks! It's not that hard a concept 
to grasp..."
  "Why would you think I'd want anything else? Humans don't need religion or 
God as an excuse to kill each other... The whole point of believing in God 
is to have a higher standard of behavior. How obvious can you get?"
  "I'm talking to all of you, here!" continued God, His voice rising to a shout. 
"Do you hear Me? I don't want you to kill anybody. I'm against it, across the 
board. How many times do I have to say it? Don't kill each other anymore ever! 
I'm fucking serious!"
  Upon completing His outburst, God fell silent, standing quietly at the podium 
for several moments. Then, witnesses reported, God's shoulders began to shake, 
and He wept.

HAS ANYONE SEEN OUR CROPDUSTER??
WASHINGTON, Oct 2 (PAWN) - A small cropdusting plane owned by the 
US State Department has gone missing near the Bahamas as it was 
returning to the United States from Colombia, the department said 
Tuesday.
  Last contact with the plane was Monday morning after it left the 
Turks and Caicos Islands, where it had stopped overnight Sunday for 
refueling, according to Gas Station attendent Robert "Bob" Roberts.
  Roberts looked left and right, and then up into the sky shrugging
his shoulders and rolling his eyes, just as he said, "you got me."
  Roberts said it could be anywhere by now, but really wonders where
it could have gone.
  "These things don't just get up and walk away you know..."
