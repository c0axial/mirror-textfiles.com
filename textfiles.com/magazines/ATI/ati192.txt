RATHER THAN A RANT
The Prime Anarchist Publisher's column this
week will look like this:

Prime Anarchist's take on Warren Beatty.

Beatty is a thinking man.
This alone could easily be dangerous.

Beatty is a compassionate man.
This by itself could quickly devastate.

He's a talented man.
That, without other things has gotten 
many before him into bigtime trouble.

Finally, he's majorly talented and good looking.
Without other traits on the side, one is in 
danger of being the next Hitler, 
Reagan, Pinochet or Carter.

Beatty is all four, (no! not the people, the
traits, read back...) and that's pure beauty;
worthy of everyone's admiration.

Don't you dare accept the nomination, Beatty, 
or even consider running. Please kick the 
next president's ass daily, after 
dinner, by telephone instead.

Thanks for your very existence.

SOME PEOPLE FIND THEIR VOICE: Others Pretend.
A Subcolumn by Prime Anarchist
   In the Aug/Sep "Civilization" magazine
(LOC's main propaganda arm) Peter Jennings
has a pretty big feature story looking at
"Voice." Basically studies changes in the 
internet from Jenning's point of view and 
that of them that're chose to interview 
therein.
   I must respond saying Jennings lost his
voice a long time ago. Whatever year he 
chose TV over radio simply because "radio
don't pay shit." That's a direct quote by
the way, of Jennings trying to sound like
Will Rogers in a very expensive lunch in
Washington DC many years ago.
   Just like in the song "video killed the
radio star" the net is killing TV off
pretty swiftly. And I'm not sure how good
or bad I feel about that per se. I guess
I could say it doesn't really concern me
much. I've been embracing "the net" since
I was in my early 20's.
   I will say that ABC/NBC/CBS people looking
at jumping ship for "anchorman jobs" on the 
net for no other reason than someone offered
them 1 or 2 million extra dollars per year, 
they're in for a strange surprise. 
   It's a jungle "out there." Has been for
decades, and I don't expect next millenium
to look any different.
   If you have a voice, use it for whatever
you believe in. Use it for good. Remind 
yourself constantly that you joined this mess
to change the world for the better.
   If you sell it out, sorry.
   You never had a voice in the first place.

LETTUCE FROM OUR READERS
    ----====----

Last time I went through Big Mountain, I'd bet the farm that the 
"Relocation is Genocide" sign was gone. It used to be my landmark
to get onto Big Mountain Blvd. I got on it by memory last time.
Whomever risked their necks climbing up that tower and painting 
that sign, will be honored this weekend as various places around
the world resurrect that simple but powerful phrase. This is the
weekend when Big Mountain Blvd. and Main Street USA intersect.

  Em 1971, Abbie Hoffman e os Yippies fundam a primeira revista hacker/
  phreaker, YIPL/TAP (Youth International Party -- Technical Assistance
  Program = Partido Jovem Internacional -- Programa de Assistência
  Técnica). YIPL/TAP essencialmente inventa o phreaking -- o esporte de
  brincar com os sistemas telefônicos de maneiras nunca pensada pelos
  seus criadores. Eles são motivados pelo monopólio da compania
  telefônica Bell com suas taxas altissímas para ligações de longa
  distância, e um pesado imposto que Hoffman e muitos outros recusavam
  a pagar enquanto protestavam contra a Guerra do Vietnã.  Que modo
  melhor de se pagar contas telefônicas do que não pagar conta nenhuma?

  As "blue boxes" entram em cena. Seus osciladores automatizam o som
  que já possibilitaram pessoas como Captain Crunch (John Draper) a se
  tornarem piratas do megamonopólio da Bell. Repentinamente, os 
  phreakers são capazes de conseguirem dinheiro com seus hobbies. Hans
  e Gribble vendem "blue boxes" no campus de Stanford.

"Night/Knight"
    by Aaron

The game was plaid
The egos glittered with the gold
And even the shiny pebbles skipped to the 
Beat
But the day was lost
The food poisoned
And the victory empty
For nothing could stand
On the arguments of a rebel
Whose cause 
Was lost

The chants rang out
The deafening noise was heard
The masses marched on
Into the oblivion of their nightmares
Where swords are swallowed
Entrails pierced
The saint a sinner
And right turns wrong
And the death of the day, but a sad 
 \epilogue to their growing hypocrisy

The heartful glimmer of a child who could
A whistling song of youthful hope
The first ray of the dawning sun
Lay crestfallen
In the ashes
Of the burned heretic
Who died of his own flame
Admist the laughing gaeity of his 
Friends
Who began another game

For the time was right
For the evil to fight
And the world to be betrayed
Through its highest hopes
Which it once had placed
Upon the tounge of a knight
Who often sang and was liked
For whom the bells now tolled
As he stepped out of the light
Drawing tears from the sighing 
   \spectator who gleamed
At the sought prize, now denied, once gained
Shedding a shoe, for his foot gone lame
As the curtains fell and he died.

US OUT OF EAST TIMOR by F.

Dili, East Timor. 
   As opposed to Dili, Indonesia, because it 
never was a part of Indonesia. Only according 
to Indonesia, of course. They invaded. 
   They did not want a self-governing territory
bordering their military dictatorship. Nor has 
the international community recognized the 
illegal invasion to be legitimate. (with the 
exception of Australia.) Therefore all the talk 
about what is acceptable to Indonesia, (ie: allowing 
international forces in, requireing Indonesians on
refugee relief drops, journalists in East Timor) is 
total nonsense. Did the world ask Iraq what was 
acceptable to them in Kuwait? Preposterous of 
course, but exactly the same thing. Country A 
invades country B. So of course Indonesia should 
completely withdraw, immediately.
   Why should we care? The US owes the East Timorese. 
US complicity goes way back to the day before the 
invasion. Gerald Ford and Henry Kissinger met with 
Suharto giving the 'green light' to invade and 
guaranteed arms sales would continue.  The day 
after Ford and Kissinger left, Indonesia invaded.
   The US then made the United Nations "utterly 
ineffective in whatever measures it undertook" 
on resolutions demanding Indonesia withdraw.
Or so says former US ambassador to the UN Daniel 
Patrick Monihan as he bragged about it in his memoirs.
   Arms sales did increase, during the Carter 
administration, during the height of the massacre 
of a third of the population, thus making it the
largest percentage of a population killed since 
WWII. Arms sales continued under both Democrat 
and Republican administrations.
   Growing awareness since the 1991 massacre 
helped pass legislation to end training of Indonesian 
forces, but the Pentagon found a loophole and bypassing
congressional intent, continued training under a 
different program.
   If that isn't enough, according to award-winning 
journalist Allan Nairn in an article in "The Nation," 
Admiral Dennis Blair, was ordered twice last spring 
to tell the Inonesian General Waranto to shut down 
the militias. He did not. Twice.
   Only after the election results were in, only after 
the militias continued their rampage, only after 
grassroots pressure did President Clinton suspend 
military aid to Indonesian military. Suspend. Meaning 
it could be continued at any time, unless we, through 
congress make it illegal for us to support the murderers 
that run Indonesia, ie: the military.  
   Contact your local representative today and urge him 
or her to co-sponsor and vote for HR2809. This would 
block US-Indonesian military relations until Indonesia 
is out of East Timor.

WHENEVER

             RIGHT?

"And, to prove me right, a walnut ice cream did not 
turn up on my desk (which is what I would have wanted, 
and which, in that instance, nature does indeed surpass 
art), but rather a book which is also two books, War
Report, by Julio Scherer Garcia and Carlos Monsivais."

 -- the illustrious sup. Marcos proving once again 
    that writers read and read and read, and if 
    they have ANY time left over they might
    sleep or eat.


1 more? ok.

Less and less frequent among civilians, the
admiration for the military "forgets," after 
the mute epoch, that armies are the most absurd 
structures in existence.  Absolute negation of 
reason, the crushing of the individual and the 
cult of destruction are some of their characteristics 
(and doors through which organized crime extends its
reach).

GUITAR ANARCHY TIPS 11 & 12

*
Does perspiration turn your strings or 
fingers green, brown or black?
  Wash hands every couple songs with nothing
more than baking soda and water. Oh about a 
teaspoon or half a one each time. Wipe down
strings with a clean dry cloth regularly.

*
Write a classical guitar piece about Ceasar.
Kind of a tone poem. Call it Etude Brutus.

AN OFFBEAT RECORD REVIEW
 by marco

No one knows where to put O'Detta.
I bought Odetta's "At Town Hall," the
other day. Perhaps the best recording 
there was in all of 1963.
My store had it in Folk, which is cool
by me. The store up the road from there?
RNB and a dollar more.
It was about 85c less at a different 
store I refused to buy it in for many
reasons. One of which being they had her
in World Music, offending me so "to the 
bone" that I almost burned the place down.
  Of course just in time, I remember I'm a 
pacifist, right?
  Once again I must assert my will for after
I die and cease to compose any more, opting
for decomposing some of the greatest works
known to mankind. If I see one single piece
of my life's recording work in "New Age," 
especially my classical guitar (!) there's
gonna be more than earthquakes and nuke
meltdowns to deal with around here...

RECIPE EXCHANGES TO AVOID

   Peppercorns and cloves look highly
similar. Do not exchange in any recipe.
   Salt and baking soda look the same.
Missing one? Don't use the other. 
Especially with brownies and tollhouse.
   Never mix heroin with your sugar.

We end this week's ati with words about Roberta 
Blackgoat. We talked it over with Prime Anarchist 
and he said it's safe to publish now that he lived 
with Roberta back in the early 90's. Prime vouches that
although Roberta can tell you at great length some scores
of vicious things that members of the Mormon church have
done to Navajo people the past hundred years, she
would never say an unkind word about mormon people in 
general.
