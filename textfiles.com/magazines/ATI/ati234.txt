  This is not a test.
  This is a test of a test. Had it been a real test
you would be listening to a real radio station that
really plays real music.
  Not this washed up rehashed wound up ground up churned
out burned out creepy crud passing for music these days.
  This is a test of a test of the Emergency 911 Wakeup
Call, brought to you by the makers of Your Music Sucks
Inuncorporated, in conjunction with Conjunction Junction
Functions, International.
  By a wider definition than that of the Emergency Broadcast
System, you can consider this a real emergency.
  This test of the Emergency 911 Wakeup Call has really
been a test.
  Hope you passed.

Hey Al Gore, gotta ask you again...
  I suppose now's not a good time to bring up HR2911, huh?


Greeting, I'm prime anarchist, and this is the 'zine for
Sunday: the 23rd of July.
  AND NOW AN ATI RANTICLE -
  James Traficant - nice toupe. I'm tellin' ya - it takes at
LEAST a year and a half off of you. Much better'n McCain's
combover! He really should do what Jessy Ventura does - he
gets 5-10 years shaving his head. I really think McCain can
get down to looking 60 or so, you know?
  Of course he could jump on national TV with barbells and
dumbells like Castro or Reagan. He'd look AND feel better,
but who cares how the guy "feels" - that's what we have 
presidential sections of navy hospitals for. And senate gym
and health spas at taxpayer expense, huh?
  So are you read for the emmys? The New Academy of Television
Arts and Sciences should be a hoot. nATAS, spell it backwards,
tell me what you come up with? Kudos to Michael from the
Hollywood Reporter for calling the ATAS people "boobs."
  Of course, Al Gore wouldn't benefit from using dumbells, he
already is one. 
  C|Net is buying Ziff-Davis. Not just for cleaning products
any more. You might know them for other things besides just
vinegar and chlorine. Have you ever searched the internet?
Have you ever read a 'zine that's a little more commercial
than the one you're "holding in your hands" this moment?
You're probably encountering a Ziff-Davis product. You're
probably sitting on one of their, (oh yeah, that's a different
product. But if you wear hairspray...)
  Consider this fairwarning, and a prediction which 
shall/should leave you adequately forwarned. 
  George bush gives the foreshadowing, that when he announces
his choice of running mate, we are going to say "oh yeah.
Duh!"
  Well, I'll tell you who, and why.
  Are you ready?
  William Cohen. The only US citizen more outspokenly pro
police-state than Cohen is Tipper Gore. And you know he won't 
pick her, right?
  Right?
  Hmmm. There's the ex-prez dad, "George Herbert Walker Texas
Ranger" but how silly would that be?
So we're back to the shortest short list ever, unless you count
Al Gore who's left with only two choices, Bill Bradley or John
McCain. Well, unless you don't rule out Tipper Gore.
  Let the brave new world begin...

LETTUCE 

-=-

  It was about three years ago today that Adam and I were sitting in his 
basement writing "40/80".  A story about getting harassed unjustly on 53 and 
Ogden.  Today at that same intersection we signed a record deal with Elektra.
  Thanks to everyone that has been around and spread the word since the 
purple tape days, the Old School 420 Geeks.  Thanks to Jeremy and everyone at 
WONC who were playing our music before we even had a band name, you guys are 
the shit.  Thanks to Sean at Metro for hooking us up show after show, we 
appreciate it.  Everyone that's on this list deserves a thanks too.
  I know that term "sellout" has been thrown around a lot, we just want to 
make this our lives and actually be professional musicians/songwriters.  To 
do what we love to do and make a living off of it still baffles me.  I 
promise we will continue to keep putting out the same type of music that we 
have been since we started, music from our hearts, shit that stirs up some 
sort of emotion in the 5 of us and hopefully you.  
  If it wasn't for these label reps seeing all you crazy fucking 420 Geeks 
rip up the floors of the HOB and Metro none of this shit would be happening 
for us.  You guys are the shit, I hope you feel as big a part of this as you 
should.  Thanks, speaking for Joe, Adam, Ryan, Jason, our managers Thaddeus 
and Doug (ThugDaddy), Willie, Steve Busse, Rajiv, our trusty roadies, King 
our hairy traveling hippy, Nendick our traveling prankster, and of course 
Cockboy..............
420 Geekin with a permagrin,
Kaustubh

   [Stubhy, I can't see this happening to a nicer person. Congrats.]

To Marco:
Ian and I spent our day off sleeping. I woke up in the middle 
of the afternoon, and for the first time in weeks, I really 
felt like fooling around, so I woke Ian up, and he was so mad, 
   "What!" and I flinched back, and then he said sorry, and we 
made up. We hadn't messed around for so long, it's like it was 
new or something, but very weird, and I don't know why, but 
kind of sad. I don't think he loves me anymore, and I don't 
know, I love the guy, but he's still figuring out who he is.

Courant. (the more things change...)]
  "Psst," I imagine someone whispering to defense chief
William Perry, "Apologize for our raping that little Japanese
girl - maybe they'll get off our back about Nagasaki."
  Our military raped a 12-year old girl??? Japan deserves
an apology and then some. Didn't we demand 300 years ago
that English soldiers stay out of OUR bedrooms?
  Don't Japanese people deserve the same basic human rights?
Or are we still blinded by our imperialistic misbehavior the
whole world over? This just shows me we're getting too big
for our britches.
  If the U.S. government truly wants to have good diplomatic
relationships with Japan, then 47,000 troops should be moved
somewhere else. It's time to stop shoving our soldiers down
peoples' throats. We've gone to decay when our soldiers begin
gang-banging children.
  Let's go beyond the lip service, Washington. Let's get out
of Japan.

0007190500 - Something really really weird just happened.
I fell asleep with NPR on, and Al Gore was talking this last
hour. The whole speech I dreamed it was Secretary Cohen talking
using the same exact Harvard/Pentagon mannerisms and eyebrow
twitches.

So of course I woke up writing the following poem.

Two Faces of the Same Batman Movie
  a poem
  by Marc Frucht

Two wings of the same chicken
Two cheeks of the same ass
Two apples of the same threat
Two threads of the same washcloth
Two windmills of the same tilt
Two treasons of the same charter
Two chickens of the same roost
Two redcoats of the same enemy
Two engines of the same fraud
Two Face.

JUNIOR HIGH STUDENT ARRESTED WITH WEAPONS OF PROTEST
[PAWN] - Lost Angels - Fifteen year old Angela Acuff was
arrested Thursday for traficking what Calipornia Highway
Underpass Motor Patrol charged were tools of terrorism which 
were going to be used in the upcoming demonstrations against 
Demopublican conventions.
  "She was riding in a Ford Escort," said CHUmps spokesperson
Jeff Ramsey, "that had Dancing Bear decals on the rear windshield."
He said CHUmps followed the car Acuff was riding in for an hour
and a half before deciding their muffler was just a little too
loud.
  Ramsey pulled them over and after generally beating the shit
out of Acuff and driver Malissa Hubbard 16, they searched the
vehicle and confiscated a dark blue Dickeys hoodie, two Krypto
(tm) bike locks, a bandana and a water bottle that had what 
appeared to be "bleach and urine, bleach and urine, urine, 
maybe some water, and bleach and urine" in it [Ramsey's words.]
  Acuff was released after an hour where on the front steps of
city hall she held a press conference announcing that prior to 
the arrest she was not a protestor, but now thanks to LA's finest, 
she and Hubbard will stay on and join the ranks at this year's 
conventions.
  "We were arrested by a police state gone way the hell out of
control," said Acuff. 
  "Let's see," she said pulling out a yellow Midas Muffler 
appointment slip which she'll have to reschedule now to make
her upcoming court case. "CHUmps told us they didn't care about
the appointment, if our muffler's too loud our persons and car
gets searched and we're going to get detained. That's all there
is to it.
  "What they found was a sweatshirt they insisted was a trenchcoat.
I was wearing it because the temperature dropped to 60 degrees."
She said the bandana was because she hadn't washed her hair in a 
day and a half "for pete's sake." 
  "Let's see," she said, "The bike locks. They didn't seem to care
that they were each on a bike in the back of our car either. And
the water bottle? Oh, my, god, you'd think they'd never seen blue
green algae before.
  To huge cheers Acuff told press and protest planners that what
started out as just a trip to an L.A. bike trail will now be "full
fledged activist relocation to exercise [their] First Ammendment
rights to peacefully assemble in parks, forests and city street
corners this end of summer."
  Hubbard will join her as soon as she too is released from prison.
She's being held on suspicion of being a known environmentalist.
Her crime?
  Spending $3400 last year to convert her Ford Escort to electric
power.
  Spokespersons claim they still have no idea how they're going to
make the original charge of "loud muffler" stick since there isn't
a muffler on an electric car. Hubbard's appointment with Midas stems
from an earlier written warning on the other side of LA where they
will be required to prove they don't in fact use a muffler. Both 
charges are expected to be dropped this December if a peaceful
lucritive settlement can't be reached between both parties, people
versus city of L.A.

Why The Dove Is The Perfect Symbol Of Peace For Our Time
  by Richard Beban
  reprinted from "Will Work For Peace," 
  [ed note: an anthology my friend Brett edited]
Truth is, it's so skittish that it flees
whistling at the slightest footfall.
Ring your camp with doves 
& they'll hear your enemies
at a thousand paces. Better
than a watchdog. There's a difference 
between true peace & being warned in time
to repel aggression; but our leaders,
timorous birds, 
haven't figured that out yet.
