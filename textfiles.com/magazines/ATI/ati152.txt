Dear ATI,

was the new wave suburban kids making their clockwork 
punk newstand while cashing in. . .err. . .out on
webaritous.
Don't get me wrong, marc didn't fill etext.org with 147-151 
and I was having activism withdrawl, at least until my boy 
ric told him that I locked myself into a room and would not 
come out until I got some ATI- 
  Future wishes, no more hippy stuff (weak poems and crap), 
60's are over- 
peace. . .(is) out.

     I've also been playing with my Tibetan singing bowl, 
which has its own wonderful world of sound. It's made of 
seven different kinds of metals - gold, silver, brass, 
bronze and metals from the meteorites that land intact 
on the mountain peaks of the Himalayas, where there's less
atmosphere than anywhere else on earth to burn them up before 
impact. The bowl produces the most amazing variety of sustained, 
unearthly tones. It comes with an instrument, wrapped in chamois 
leather, resembling the kind of pestle you use to crush corn or 
rock salt in a mortar. You rub that around the rim - how fast 
and hard you rub determines the pitch and intensity of the tone 
the bowl produces - and then you put your face down into the 
bowl and listen. It feels like hearing a pipe organ in a
cathedral. It's a wonderful tool for taking me to another, 
more peaceful place.

PRESS RELEASE PRESS RELEASE PRESS RELEASE PRESS RELEASE PRESS RELEASE
		COLUMBUS ARRESTED AND DEPORTED
		Eugene, Oregon USA October 12, 1998 
 Admiral Christopher Columbus, infamous explorer and pillager of 
already occupied continents, was arrested Monday at the University 
of Oregon in Eugene.  He was charged with aggravated murder, 
first degree rape, first degree sodomy, kidnapping, theft, fraud, 
assault with deadly intent, trespass, and criminal mischief when 
a bystander witnessed the Admiral accosting students, yelling 
"Happy Genocide Day!" demanding gold and threatening to cut off 
their hands or abduct and sell them into slavery.
  "Get outta here with your rotten attitude!"  Heckled University 
students, who tried to chase him away, throwing rocks and beer bottles.
  Travelling with fencing "Conquistadores", Spanish soldiers in heavy
armament, Columbus roared defiantly when confronted by students.  
  "What!? It's MY holiday.  Happy Genocide!"  Fleeing citizens 
arrest and assaulting a bus dirver, he was pepper-sprayed by Eugene 
Police and subdued. 
  King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain were arrested by Customs 
Agents at the Madrid Airport trying to transport stolen property- 
gold from Jews and Indians, and could not be reached for comment.
  Witnesses said Columbus cowered and waived his Miranda rights while 
taken into custody, muttering about "liberal plots" against him.  
A search warrant was served on his ship, which was towed by a 
mountain bike.  When searched by EPD several dredlocked EarthFirst!ers 
were found in the hull and released.  "Discovered" in Columbus' ship 
were ten dozen bars of Black Hills gold, several hundred million board 
feet of timber stolen from the Willamette National Forest, and a card 
from a Florence-area developer.
  Suspicious the Admiral was hording other contraband, the EPD strip
searched him and held him at the Lane County Corrections Facility until
Friday.  Determining that the nefarious colonist suffers from paranoid
schizophrenia with delusions of grandeur, Health Officers forcibly
administered Halizon, Lane County Corrections officials said.
  The Conquistadores were arrested at the California-Mexican border 
by the Mexican Army.  Extradited to Mexico City they face similar 
charges and if convicted, the death penalty by a Mexican Firing Squad, 
according to an Amnesty International press release.
  Christopher Columbus was deported by the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service Friday to Geneva and charged for violating 
international laws against slavery, torture, genocide and ecocide.  
He, Ferdinand and Isabella face a United Nations tribunal comprised 
of Pagans, Jews, Moors, African-Americans and Indigenous Americans.

I Want A Loan
	  --by Humor Break (494)

  An old native American  wanted a loan for $500. 
The banker pulled out the loan application, "What are 
you going to do with the money?" 
  "Take jewlery to city and sell it," was the response. 
  "What have you got for collateral?" 
  "Don't know collateral." 
  "Well that's something of value that would cover the 
cost of the loan. Have you got any vehicles?" 
  "Yes, 1949 Chevy pickup." 
The banker shook his head, "How about livestock?" 
  "Yes, I have a horse." 
  "How old is it?" 
   "Don't know, has no teeth." 
Finally the banker decided to make the $500 loan. 
Several weeks later the old man was back in the bank. 
He pulled out a roll of bills, "Here to pay." he said. 
He then handed the banker the money to pay his loan
off.
  "What are you going to do with the rest of that money?" 
  "Put in teepee." 
  "Why don't you deposit it in my bank," he asked. 
  "Don't know deposit." 
  "You put the money in our bank and we take care of it for you. 
When you want to use it you can withdraw it." 
The old Indian leaned across the desk, 
"What you got for collateral?"

House SPEAKer Leaves SandBOX.
(PAWN) Newport, RI - For the first time in 113 years Brutus
"Newt" GangReich will step down as BoxSpeaker, saying "I'm
not playing any more."
   Accused of whining, vetting, six of the 7 deadly sins,
and now being a quitter, GangReich had this to say.
   "If we can't play by my rules, the way I want to, with
me winning all the time, then I don't want to play," he
snivelled snot on his sleeve loudly. He said he's going
home to live with his sister.
   "My sister has a bigger sandbox," said GangReich at an
open press conference in Newport, the first in his career.
   "Anyways, we can make our own rules, and play all day,"
he said. GangReich will be sorely remembered.

(SPAWN) Sporty Anarchy Whirled News.
[Sporty Anarchy will be writing occasional sports
 columns for ATI whenever the mood is right (and
 whenever Ginger is indisposed)]
    Local newscaster, Heather Hayes, will be dating
the single Green Bay Packagers, leaving speculation
as to who will service the married ones.
    Beginning Sunday, Hayes, Green Bay's resident
gorgious older babe anchorwoman will broadcast 
live via webcam from a not-yet-disclosed hotel-room
in Pittsburgh. Which single Packager she will date is
also as yet undisclosed. Hayes says she will date a
different Packager each week as part of her Eligible
Bachelors series, and will give live reports of her
dating via the webcam as well as day old feeds of 
play-by-play complete with slow motion and bad 
70's wah-wah peddle music.
    "I'll be the sports version of Anais Nine," said
Hayes.
    Chris Eliot volunteered to interview the married
Packagers saying that since the movie "Something About
Mary," he's got more access to Brett Fave than even his 
wife, but NBC26 is just not telling.
    As soon as this columnist knows which hotel, which
Green Bay Packager, and which webpage: you'll hear it
here first.

GOOD SUGGESTION: A Valued Lesson.
    a poem by marco
Atticus,
   Thanks for the -
   Thanks a lot.

   Thanks for the 
   Twelve dollar and
   Ninety-five cent

6 Month Lease
    another poem by marco

My dad was the Apollo of Angio-plasty
They do a lot of them now
He was number 71 or so in the
Country
Maybe the world
Yale wanted him to write a position paper
What it's like to get a new lease on life
Thanks to a balloon that ripped through his veins
Like a friendlier kind of clot.
He declined.
He died a week or two later. Waiting for the doctor's
OK
To begin jogging instead of walking the miles each day.

Did we lose our sensibility when we lost Apollo?



MORE PARODY:
Welcome back my friends

Hear me,
See me,
Cheer me,
Be me.
