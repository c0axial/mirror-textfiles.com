It was the saddest trip to Big Mountain I've ever made, 
due to the senseless, violent death of a young man with 
a good heart. Arrick Crittenden  was being sent on his 
spiritual journey. Arrick's father, George is from the 
Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma, his mother, Louise Benally 
is at the heart of the traditional Dineh resistance to 
relocation. Arrick was raised and still lived on land 
in the center of the Navajo reservation known as Hopi 
Partitioned Land (HPL). He was connected to the place 
his mother's family has lived on for generations. Even 
though the US government had drawn lines on maps before 
he was born and given this place to the Hopi tribe (and 
the energy corporations) he knew he belonged there. 
  He grew up in the shadow of the sacred Sundance arbor, 
with his grandmother, uncles, aunts, cousins and extended 
family. Arrick was the big brother to two sisters, Della 
and Waleesa, and one brother, little George. His mother 
says he was the backbone of the family, the one who held 
them together. In fact he died standing up for his sisters 
and some friends who were working on a sheep corral for 
an elder. 
  He took a 12 gage shotgun blast to the chest at 
point blank range from an angry young man looking 
for trouble. It hurts even more because the young 
man who killed him is the eldest son of his mother's 
cousin. Arrick's life and death are a kind of microcosm 
of the bigger picture at Big Mountain. He lived his 
days on disputed land, officially a trespasser in his 
native country, surrounded by the isolation and difficult 

[big]  
"Dignified sorrow and grief have a special kind of beauty."
[/big]

circumstances of oppression. Just a year and a half 
ago he was arrested for taking pictures of BIA agents 
and Hopi Rangers as they bull-dozed the arbor, sacred 
tree and sweat lodges of the Sundance grounds that his 
grandfather, Joe Benally had established on the family 
homestead just before he was born.  In the late 1970s 
Joe traveled to South Dakota and asked Lakota Sundance 
Chief Joe Chasing Horse to bring the pipe and ceremony 
to Big Mountain to pray for the land. An annual all 
nations Sundance was established and continued until 
the agents desecrated the sacred site in August of 2001, 
saying it was a dangerous, illegal, activity with out a 
permit. Arrick's grandmother, Alice Benally was a true 
traditionalist. She spoke only in her native tongue, 
loved her dirt floor hogan, wove incredible blankets 
from the wool of her sheep, and moved with the grace 
of a queen. She was a part of the land and the land 
part of her. In her later years, she was compelled 
to travel and defend that land through public speaking 
(with a translator), attending hearings and meetings 
and of course with ceremony and prayer. 
  This is the kind of tension and struggle Arrick knew 
his entire life. So did the young man who killed him, 
and the two teen boys from the rez who died in a drunk 
driving wreck that weekend, as well as the three who 
died together in a suicide pact. Six teenagers in one 
weekend.
  That he remained a gentle, soft-spoken man despite 
the hardships and unfairness of his situation is a 
testimony to his beauty. In the same way his culture 
is being attacked and blown apart by forces from afar, 
with aid from within, Arrick paid the price for someone 
else's bad decisions and violent actions.
  One of Arricks uncles, Jean Paul Roy from the Lakota 
Nation reminded us often as he led ceremony, that his 
nephew had moved on to a better place, where there is 
no pain or suffering. It is those of us who are left 
behind that are sad and hurt. If the corporations and 
government drive the traditional people from the land 
(or kill them, the Dineh say to leave the land is to 
die), they too may move on to a better place and those 
of us left behind will be the sufferers.
  Dignified sorrow and grief have a special kind of 
beauty. The sadness becomes part of who we are, gives 
us empathy and understanding for others when they go 
through the worst of times. No life of any length is 
untouched by sorrow or hard times. It's not the absence 
of hard times that make a good life, but how you deal 
with the suffering you have. Arrick's family honored 
him and came together to send him off in a most beautiful 
way. They are facing this tragedy in a way that will help 
them make the best of what remains. 

   [ed note: I'm listening to Blackfire's "Lying" while 
    I read this and cry. (http://www.blackfire.net) ]

  I traveled to the ceremonies with my brother, Bear and 
his daughter Rose. We were honored to be treated like 
family. Bear and I prayed in the men's sweat lodge with 
George and several others, as Jean Roy poured the water 
of life on the hot rocks to help us all purify and purge. 
We helped with chores, visited with the family and friends, 
cried, hugged, laughed and reflected on Arrick's life. On 
Friday night Arrick's body was returned to the land. He 
had told Jean Roy he liked to stay in a tipi, so Jean 
brought one from South Dakota and set it up next to the 
small hogan Arrick lived in. Arrick was dressed by his 
parents and laid out with beautiful blankets covering 
him for a last night on the land, in a beautiful lodge. 
We sat up all night in his cleaned out hogan as Jean Roy 
led the special Native American Church funeral meeting 
with Louise, George, Della, Waleesa, little George, 
uncles, aunts, cousins, the boys who were with Arrick 
when he died and other friends. So much emotion, such 
sadness and confusion. As the drum and the medicine 
made their way around the fire, songs and prayers 
filled the night and the ceremony pulled us through 
the dark hours. The healing was starting. As the sun 
lit the sky red and poured through the open east-facing 
door, Jean Roy's young daughter Mazzie brought in the 
morning water and we all knew life would go on.
  We exited the hogan a couple hours after dawn and 
everyone made one last pass through the tipi to say 
good-bye to Arrick.  The casket was closed and loaded 
into the back of a pickup with a camper shell on it 
for the trip across the wash to the cemetery, where 
he was laid to rest near his grandmother, Alice. Again 
there were songs and prayers, tears and laughter. 
  We made it back to the big feast and for a few 
moments here and there, some things felt normal again. 
But between those moments the grief and questioning 
came rushing back. There is no sorrow like that of a 
parent that buries a child and I hurt even now to 
think about Louise and George and all the parents 
through time that have ever gone through this. It 
made me want to see and hold my children, it made 
me happy and proud to see my niece, Rose be there 
in support, it made me want to do something to stop 
the killing.
  It made me think George W. Bush doesn't go to child 
funerals, how else could you be willing to be responsible 
for starting a war that will have this effect on millions 
of people?

[!--- ED NOTE: wow. heavy. I pause here just ---]
[!---  to ask,  how are you?  You doin' ok?  ---]

  After sharing the meal and a few good-byes, we were 
back on the road, heading south west in the afternoon sun. 
It was a tiring five days, including staying up all night, 
so we stopped in Flagstaff for the night. The next morning 
as we were leaving the land of the Navajo a bald eagle 
flew right in front of the car, then swept across the 
highway and dipped it's wing back at us. I think Arrick 
was letting us know he's all right. I pray everyone else 
will be too.

/=================================

You are watching ATI zine. This is an issue dealing with
loss. Many different kinds of loss. For that there will 
be no fancy ascii art in this issue. Just text. OK? Hope 
so. If not, then forgive me, or don't.

Those funeral words at the top of the page were written 
by my friend Mark Dyken. They came in about 5 hours before 
deadline for this zine, even though I know he wasn't writing 
it for any kind of deadline. And nor am I then. I worked on 
this zine for almost 3 full extra days. Hope you like it. 
Or at least get something out of it. So, ever aware that 
zine deadlines mean little to me these days, I began reading 
that first part and wondering in my head and heart, "should 
I include this in my zine tonite? Maybe, maybe not. Very 
quickly I began weeping openly. 
  I knew Arrick, the young man from that piece, but I'll get 
into that some other time. I suspect even if I didn't Know 
him these words whould've affected me in this sort of sublime 
way. Beyond the tears, below the tears, and despite the tears 
I find myself needing to tell the world of Arrick's death, 
but especially of Arrick's life.
  Arrick was a warrior in the truest, oldest most pure sense.
He was devoted to his mother and father, his siblings, his
distant family members. I'm going to risk an assumption that
he was opposed to George W Bush's diabolical plans to invade
Iraq. I've heard him speak against war before. Way back when
it was simple words, like "war sucks," or "war has never been
right," stuff like that. I imagine the past few years, his 
words have been more complex, but I'm sure the meanings are
all the same. Everything I knew about him was true to warrior
form. 
  To learn that he was taking a bullet so his sisters would
not, just blows my mind. But should it? It sure sounds like
a fitting death for a real warrior, right? But so young? 
Well, truly -- warrior society doesn't know age, huh? 
  When I got arrested for taking pictures of surveillance cops
here in Milwaukee at an anti-bush protest last summer I remember
serving my 6 or 7 hours in jail and thinking of many heros of
mine who withstood longer jailtimes before being given release.
People such as Arrick, who if I remember right spent more than 
5 days jail without recognizance, during the devastation at the
Sundance ceremony the year before that. I remember thinking for
a brief moment that I was doing some of the same things Arrick
was doing when I got arrested. I was sharing the truth. I was
illuminating the darkness, I was exposing a machine that is
spawning right in front of our very eyes this millenium. 
  But I digress. This is issue 344 of ATI, Activist Times
Intentional; I'm marco and we are celebrating the loss of what
little liberties we have left as citizens of the Untied States.
It's quite a dance this ceremony. Participating in it is very
frightening, while at the same time very exciting.
  Have you done any keyword searches where there are 3 or 4
words the US government might disapprove of? I don't know if
you've noticed, but unlike in China, Germany and Switzerland,
you'll get the pages you need through Google. 
  So far.
  It usually takes a second or third try when you search for
something like "george bush raped someone while governor" or
"noelle really did hide crack in her sneaker." Is the software
already in place? Just that GooglePeople are trying desperately
to restrain the USGovt from doing domestically what they 
insist upon making Google do abroad. Will it last? Tune in 
tomorrow, eh?
  But again, I digress. Loss of our liberties.
  Here we go. Enjoy the rest of this zine, it's Monday,
midnite my time, 3/4feb03. Can you believe this year
is already 1/12th flown by?

From Sam Hamill, Cofounder of Copper Canyon Press:
Dear Friends and Fellow Poets: 

When I picked up my mail and saw the letter marked 
"The White House," I felt no joy. Rather I was overcome 
by a kind nausea as I read the card enclosed: 

Laura Bush 

requests the pleasure of your company 
at a reception and 
White House Symposium on 
"Poetry and the American Voice" 
on Wednesday, February 12, 2003 
at one o'clock

Only the day before I had read a lengthy report on 
the President's proposed "Shock and Awe" attack on 
Iraq, calling for saturation bombing that would be 
like the firebombing of Dresden or Tokyo, killing 
countless innocent civilians. 

I believe the only legitimate response to such a 
morally bankrupt and unconscionable idea is to 
reconstitute a Poets Against the War movement like 
the one organized to speak out against the war in 
Vietnam. 

I am asking every poet to speak up for the conscience 
of our country and lend his or her name to our petition 
against this war, and to make February 12 a day of Poetry 
Against the War. We will compile an anthology of protest 
to be presented to the White House on that afternoon. 

Please submit your name and a poem or statement of 
conscience to:  kokua@olympus.net

There is little time to organize and compile. I urge 
you to pass along this letter to any poets you know. 
Please join me in making February 12 a day when the 
White House can truly hear the voices of American poets. 

Sam Hamill

   F L A M I N G   L I P S  



Thinking back on your day, your week, or your life,

        bring to mind a "Sacred Moment".

Sacred in whatever way you wish to define the term.

            A moment that resonates.

Can you remember a sound, a smell, perhaps a touch

          associated with that moment?

               Try to visualize it.



PESTO RECEIPT

LOTS fresh basil 
LOTS fresh garlic
MANY pinon pine nuts
TONS olive oil

Chop up garlic and pine nuts very
fine. Cut basil into fairly tiny
shapes. 

Pour olive oil in a blender and then
keep adding other ingredients a little
at a time until it's very pasty.

Refrigerate until ready to serve or use.

[NOTE make sure you chop up the garlic
finer than the pine nuts and basil no
matter what. There are LOTS of people who
absolutely hate garlic, yet they absolutely
love pesto. They have no idea! Lets keep it
that way.]



AIRPLAY 101
-----------------
By Bryan Farrish
http://www.radio-media.com

Payola (part 3 of 5), How Stations React If You Try To Pay Them.

Let's say you are a grassroots artist, or a small indie, or even a
small-medium label, and up until now you've done no radio (or, you've
always had someone else take care of it for you.)  Now, you've decided
that since you understand payola, you are going to spend some money and
try to handle the promotion yourself, legally.  You tell yourself that
you are going to contact the PD at three or four major-market stations
near you, and set up your own "contract" to play your record.  You have
enough money, and so you are finally going to get your exposure. 
Here's what will happen...

First of all, most every beginner wants the major stations, so here is
how it will go down in markets #1 to #20 (small markets would be
different, of course).  You make your phone call to the PD, but he/she
is not available, so the secretary directs you to the MD.  Since the MD
has not heard of you, you will probably get the MD's voicemail.  Or,
you ask for someone who WILL talk with you... a jock, or even an
assistant.  You tell the person (or the MD if they answer) that you
have some marketing money for airplay, and that you want to set up one
of those "legal indie contracts". 

Without further thought on their part, you will be transferred or
directed to the sales department, where you will get the newest
entry-level account executive.  This account executive will be confused
by your "indie contract" request, but will say that if you are looking
to get exposure for your release, you should start out with an
advertising campaign (i.e., a spot schedule) on the station, and he/she
will also say "if it's good, the PD may indeed start playing it,
because I've seen it happen before."  You think about it, and realize
you've been sidetracked.  You want airplay, not commercials.  You try
again for the PD, to no avail, and now the original MD or jock you
talked to doesn't want to hear from you, except for maybe saying "send
me the record."  You have now been taken completely out of the airplay
loop, and you would not have even realized it had you not read this
first.

You start rationalizing that you could indeed use some commercials
anyway.  Plus, the PD will certainly hear the spots, so this may
actually be the way to go.  But you want to make certain this will
result in airplay, so you tell the AE (account executive) that you
don't mind spending the $10,000 or $20,000 for a heavy three week spot
schedule, but you want to get some kind of guarantee or promise from
the PD that the record will go into rotation soon after you start;
after all, the reason you called the station in the first place was to
set up your "legal indie contract".  You'll spend the money, if you get
the spins.

The PD and sales staff now have you where they want you.  They have
done their job of making you think that your pseudo "indie contract"
starts out with an ad (not "add") schedule, and that it will "maybe
probably" evolve into airplay.  It's the most attention you've ever
gotten from a station.

But you keep prodding the AE for that "promise" that you seem to not be
getting... that they WILL play your record if you buy the schedule. 
The AE says almost everything on the planet, except "yes, we promise". 
You do not feel so great about this.  It must be easier than this...
there is no way they'd treat Warner Brothers this way, you say.  But
you have no other choice... the major-market PD will not talk to you
(again, small market would be different), and it looks as if there is
nothing left to do but run the spots and hope for spins.

Congratulations... you have now completed your dead-end trip.  The
spots will run, and finish; the station will have your money (legally),
and you will have NO regular rotation on this major-market station. 
The system has worked again.

Conclusion:  Paying stations is not a tool for a small indie to get
airplay.

STATION SHUT DOWN FOR NATION VIOLATION

by Prime Anarchist World News Tonite 
Correspondent Dirk Derthbed 

[PAWN] - South Bronx, NY; Fairfax Station, Virginia;
and Harlem, NY. A corporation owning many radio stations 
was shut down for 6 hours because three of their stations 
were caught playing Russian classical, Latvian folk and
Iraqi punkrock, when their section of the FM dial was only 
designated for country&western music. Spokespersons would 
not disclose the name of the company, or even the station 
names.
  They were apparently warned once and then shut down 35 
seconds later. FCC chairperson Michael K. Trowell said this 
has nothing to do with politics, that those musical styles 
have their own sections on the radio dial, somewhere between 
AM and FM, but definitely not where the country&western 
should go. 
  ClearChannel, oops, we mean the corporation, which
will remain unnamed, was back up in 6 hours save for
the three channels in question, which are still closed
down until they can be sold at auction to vodka companies. 
  When asked whether this has anything to do with 
Homeland Security, the Patriot Act or Kazaa offering
free downloads of commercial music, FCC Chief of Staff
Marsha J. McBride said, "absolutely no comment."
