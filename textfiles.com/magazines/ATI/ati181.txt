I'm prime anarchist, and here's something
funky for you. Then of course, our #'s run
and our letters to the editor. We'll end
with loose stuff and poetry, or was that
much stuff, and loose poetry? Er, uh, we'll
get loose and send you some poetry...

HOOT MON
   penned by prime anarchist productions

   "I'm going to die by my schedule, in case
you can tell."
   A woman wearing an olive drab polo-shirt
white khaki's and the nice looking brown
steel-toes has made a weekly planner to
give the new summer intern, a Japanese
international student who's wearing an olive
drab polo shirt, white khaki's and the nice
steel-toe shoes. She's thumbing through HER
planner, and training him on how to be a
floor manager.
   There's at least 4 meetings he'll be 
required to attend every day. 4 or 5 others
are optional.
   She's telling him he'll make a fine 
manager. Of course if he keeps dressing the
part; soon he may be president.

   Well, Hole may have killed this year's
Lilith Fair, but Jerry Falwell probably
just gave it mouth to mouth. He's declared
it sinful and satanic. Expect record sales.

SNIGLET:  recessitation. The false economy
that's been operating for decades now so
the middle and upper class can thrive/survive
without too much sacrifice - devil may care
for that urine and feces smell on just about 
every sidewalk in this country nowadays.

Give it up for Anya Lasagna.
   Don't get any lasagna on 'ya.

How does Burger King get the fish to grow
square like that?

I am going to buy a bumper stick that 
says "I Support Hackers" because of 
the recent FBI harrassement of the 
hacker community. The hackers retaliated, 
something our government has never delt 
with - someone with a backbone, and 
consequently the FBI hasen't got a clue 
as to what to do. The more I think about 
it the more I realize that I'm never going 
to go into the FBI. Anyways, enjoy your
day everyone, expecially all you working 
in hot, sweaty, physical, menial labor, 
demeaning, low paying jobs - right here 
from the guy at a desk, with a computer, 
in a shirt and NO tie, air conditioning, 
making more money than you, with security 
clearence to national documents, and of 
course no physical work neccessary. 
Love ya all!

ONION'S "Stain-Removal Guide"
Here's a handy guide to getting out those
pesky fabric stains:
    :reprinted from:
    :Onion Vol. 35.:
    : Number 24    :

BLOOD
Spill more blood around area of stain
so it won't stand out as much.
INK
Fall to knees and plead, "Why God,
why? Why dost thou test me so?"
GRASS
Write the name of your liquid detergent
on stain. Wash. Hold up to camera, and
show off the unbelievable results.
MUD
Place large iron-on NASCAR patch over
stain. Apply heat for 60 seconds.
GRAPE JUICE
Rub stain vigorously with wet paper
towel from restroom while saying,  
"expletive, expletive, expletive."
TOMATO SAUCE
Take out the mook responsible for 
your tomato-sauce stain by executing
him gangland-style in the back of the 
head. Capeche?
COFFEE
Rub cream and sugar into stain. Apply
oral suction. Enjoy rich, robust coffee-
stain flavor.
CHEWING GUM 
Using permanent marker, draw dotted line
around stain. Cut carefully on dotted
line.
NAIL POLISH
Nail-polish stains are actually quite 
lovely. Why not leave them in for a
pleasing "homecrafted" look.
BLEACH
Insoluble. Burn down house.


USGC Declares Virus Yucky.
<PAWN>Menom - Press Release from US Gambling
Commission. Do not gamble Dec 31.
   If you do, you MUST stop by 11. Between
noon and midnite everyone gambling is 
vulnerable to the Y2K body clock virus.
   "BodyClock causes patrons to weep," says
Commissioner Gordon, "it's horrible. The last
time this happened was 9/9/89. It'll happen
again the end of the year because there's 
nothing we can do about it. We were able to
stop it for 9/9/99 though."
   Gordon says the most common side effect
to BodyClock was causing people to experience
shirt-loss.

PRIME ANARCHIST CALLED SCRUFFY
   by Jason and his Ferret

<disclaimer: The phollowing story you>  
<are about to read  is only partially> 
<true................................>
<Much is based on the delusions of a,>
<well never mind.  Cygnus and Prime..>
<Anarchist have each  contacted Jason> 
<...about this story's being  but 30%>
<accurate or so......................>
<Jason says  he stands by  his story.> 
<Nothing more  by way of  response...> 
<Because legend is almost truth......> 
<Prime Anarchist Productions made the> 
<editorial decision  to let  sleeping>
<ferrets lie.........................>

...Enter Prime Anarchist. 
I had made acquaintance with him and his 
friends some time previous on The Works, 
and we had talked on the phone a few 
times. At some point, I mentioned that I was 
experiencing this extreme harassment, 
and they got very serious. They
offered to help. And the way they offered 
to help was to trace back the call.

They came over and visited me. 
Scruffy fellows, but I still remember the 
eagerness to help me. They explained to me 
they had a friend in the phone company, 
someone who could look at the special records 
they had, the records where they see what 
numbers called a house (as opposed to the phone 
bills we see, where all the numbers the house 
called are listed). In this way, if I gave 
them some times that YOUR MOTHER had called 
and left some messages, we could clear up 
this little problem. To sweeten the deal, 
they asked me if I could give them something 
to give to the friend in the phone company, 
something like twenty bucks. I paid up gladly.

A little later, somehow, someone broke into 
the Works machine with a remote sysop password, 
a password only I knew, that I'd not written 
down or given to anyone. After breaking in, 
this person had tried to delete my entire 
hard drive, but was typing in Apple computer 
commands to do so, and the system was on a PC. 
On at least one occasion, I'd used this remote 
password to use my machine. 
More on that in a moment.

Well, Prime and his buddy came back and told me 
their friend had done his work. They'd traced 
back the guy who did it, but they couldn't tell me! 
Apparently he ALSO worked for the phone company! 
According to my new friends, this fellow was 
TAPPING MY PHONE, and picking up all this 
information to hack into my system and harass 
me and the whole deal. So, they said, they'd 
go in and straighten things out.

Later, they called me, and proudly said that 
they'd gone to the guy's workplace, and found 
him at his desk, where they'd presented the 
evidence they had and told him to lay the hell 
off me, to never go near the Works BBS again, 
or he'd lose his job. The guy supposedly freaked 
out, and swore up and down he'd never go near 
my lines again.

I never found out who the guy was, and I never 
understood everything that went down in that 
event, but I can say that I was honestly 
freaked enough that I didn't really talk 
to Prime Anarchist and his friend Cygnus ever 
again, and to be honest, the whole situation 
was creepy. And to be fair, the harassment 
did stop after they claimed they'd talked 
about it. But either way, if you look at it 
from any angle, is it any wonder I'm a little 
paranoid?

==== MUSIC NEWS OBIT ====
DENNIS BROWN, hailed as the "Crown Prince 
of Reggae" in deference to Bob Marley's 
kingly rating, died at the University 
Hospital in Kingston this morning. 
    A spokesman for Brown's camp said 
the 42-year-old entertainer had been
ailing for several weeks, and his condition 
worsened last night so he was rushed to 
the hospital.


And our usual pome at the end.

CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE:
Or Am I That Which Should Do
    by Marc Frucht

I am the generation that could have been:
Our parents are bombing the shit out of-
Arbitrary peoples;
Our children are lashing out against-
Arbitrary peoples;
And we're just crying inside-
Victims and conspirators often not even aware-
Arbitrary peoples.

            Wake up.
          Name of God.
      Where does this end?

Do something,
Or just look like someone who will.
