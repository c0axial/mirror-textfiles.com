Will "xmas" decorations go up in stores this
Columbus Day? 911? Labor Day?

Tune in a couple weeks from now to find out.


Hi, welcome to ATI issue 327. What's new with you?
The other night I sang "Solidarity Forever" with
a couple hundred flight attendants. That was neat.

The Native American Music Awards are coming up.
That's very cool. The MTV awards were stupid this
year. Just kind of dumb. 

Midwest Express stock ended the week down .04 and
Boeing was -.36 How did you do?

http://flag.blackened.net is down. Should go back
up pretty soon. 

Check out this 'zine. Hope you like it.

Preaching Ignorance
  a poem
  by KAT

What new morals do you have 
That my own mother don't? 
Do you know something great 
That I can't, or I won't? 
Without stolen prestige 
Tell me what have you earned, 
Behind false integrity 
It seems you have not learned. 
Preached to me on my life 
Yet you live without conscience 
Claimed status with God 
In mindless alliance 
You tell me I'm godless 
And therefore I'm lifeless 
While your peers chase me down 
With Church Souvenir Pricelists 
You tell me I'm making 
A dangerous dance 
Yet your whole argument's founded< 
On close-minded ignorance.

REMEMBER ANYTHING YOUR ELDERS TAUGHT YOU?

Yes, we do this every year or so. New readers will
appreciate this more, but maybe people who've already
seen this idea will get something new out of it too.

GRAMPA: (mom's dad) If you want a long healthy life,
every morning the moment you wake up you should stare 
up at the ceiling or sky and daydream, meditate, wander 
in your thoughts for a minute or two, hour or two - as 
much as you can, really. No matter how busy your day is 
going to be, give yourself this.

BUBBE: (dad's mom) If you have access to soap and clean
water, wash your hands really well at least once a day.
If you only have access to water, wash them at least once
each day. If you don't even have access to water, at least
wipe them really well on something fairly clean.

POPPOP: (father's father) Gather up your first hundred
thousand dollars and then relax.

NANA: (mom's mom) Learn Spanish.

      VERY SHORT REVIEW OF NYTIMES.com

Monday 3+ good stories. I think I'll start reading
it every Monday and scrap the rest of the week.
Someone in there on Mondays is doing a splendid
job.
  "Web's real money is in the gutter," gives mention
to Project Gutenberg as well as interviewing Bruce
Sterling. Hmmm.

   -=-o0O=-=o0O-=-o0O=-=O0o-=-O0o=-=O0o-=-


How to Leave the Planet 

1) Phone NASA. Their phone number is (713) 483-3111. 
Explain that it's very important that you get away 
as soon as possible. 

2) If they do not cooperate, phone any friend you 
may have in the White House - (202) 456-1414 - to 
have a word on your behalf with the guys at NASA. 

3) If you don't have any friends in the White House, 
phone the Kremlin (ask the overseas operator for 
0107-095-295-9051). They don't have any friends 
there either (at least, none to speak of), but 
they do seem to have a little influence, so you 
might as well try. 

4) If that also fails, phone the Pope for guidance. 
His telephone number is 011-39-6-6982, and I gather 
his switchboard is infallible. 

5) If all these attempts fail, flag down a passing 
flying saucer and explain that it's vitally important 
you get away before your phone bill arrives.

SCHOOL'S IN. DRIVE RESPONSIBLY

Have you opened your "For Him" or your "For Her" bag
at college yet?

Did it have the smelliest Sure Advantage sample in it?
Yikes! I thought I lived near Proctor & Gamble again...
WAKE ME UP FROM THIS NIGHTMARE!!!...

How about Davidoff's Cool Water Eau De Toilette? I'll
try that and get back to you. If it's as bad as the
Polo Sport last year, I'll go right back to the Polo
green bottle.

How about the handy (not really!) disc organizer that
was nothing more than a psychodelic-looking cardboard
book with a huge ad on each page? Tide, Old Spice, 
Pantene. WHAT IS THIS, MT FUCKING V??? Olay? Sure?
Hold still, I think I'm going to vomit in your handbag.

OK. 3M's got this Command Adhesive thing going on. 
I'll try these too. The claims are:

 holds on strongly
 comes off cleanly
 no damage to walls or posters
 no staining walls.

The best thing since sliced bread.

Or fun-tak

Oh wow. A $5 off coupon for Nad's For Men. Lemme guess.
The regular price is like $20 bucks, right? Stop lying
to me! Tell me it's 25% off, not some vague number!!!
I'm a human, not a lab rat! Oh I am? Hmmm. What else
you got over there you can sell me on???

:NOTAS JOURNOS:
 -------------

Methinks this'll be a wild "Xmas" shopping season, eh?
  Labor Day, Columbus, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christ-
mas. All attached to shopping days of increasing 
importance, revenue-wise.
  I expect each to miss the mark miserably. And that's
going to make for some serious grumpiness among the
men-in-suits.
  Oh, I left out the newest big shopping day. 9-11.
It's sure to fall right into line too. Not quite as
lucrative as Columbus, but a little better'n Labor.

HOLLYWOOD NEPOTISM ALERT - 
  (and I mean nothing racist here...)
  Nastassja Kinski and Lisa Bonet look like black and
white duplicates of each other. 
  Frat twins mayhaps???

 \non\violence\difficult\y\a\lert\

  If I have to hear the name Skakel OR Norwalk one
more time I think I might just seek out a midwest
Kennedy to throttle for a couple hours before going
back to my non-violence vow.

  Do you not find it the least bit ironic that Jimmy
Hoffa is generally considered by most people to be 
buried underneath a football stadium and the people
of Guatemala just unearthed about 800 of their friends
and relatives underneath a soccer field? They vanished
about the same years.
  Victims of downright wrong US foreign and domestic
policies, perhaps?

MAKE-NO-BONEZ-ABOUT-IT

The real reason Colorado College is likely to reject
Palestinian moderate Hanan Ashrawi as a key-speaker
Sept 12th is that Dick Cheney and his eldest daughter
are both alumni of that place of "higher learning."

Have you ever watched two Wes Anderson fliks back
to back in one nite?

Wow.

AM/ERICAN/NUT/RITION/NO/TE/(OR/L/ACK/THERE/OF)

A hundred years ago you saw 90-year-old farmers
looking forward to many more seasons.
  And they lived on salty, fatty, butter, big
old healthy beef cows slaughtered local, by hand,
thanksgiving eve you chopped a turkey's head off
and cooked him all night.
  WHY ARE WE BUYING PACKAGED HAMBURGER FROM 1,000 
MILES AWAY, AND WHY OH WHY DO WE PAY PROCTOR&GAMBLE 
TO RESEARCH&DEVELOP FFF??? (fat free fat...)

TWO 'GRAFS FROM MUMIA

What phollows is from a recent column MAJ wrote. I
won't trouble you here with the entire article. If
you want it, just keyword search any three unique
words from the excerpts, you'll find it all over
the net. (at least you can as of publication here)
  
 As for the American insistence on the establishment
 of a state that doesn't have roots in terrorism,
 Americans are insisting on a purity that it did not
 possess at its inception. The ruthless and monstrous
 genocide waged against indigenous "Indian" nations,
 from Wounded Knee to Sand Creek, is a history of
 terrorism that has few parallels in the world. The
 same could be said for the racist exploitation of
 millions of Africans for centuries.

 Neither the U.S., nor Israel, wants "peace." They
 want the silence and acquiescence of the oppressed
 and the occupied. They want a Palestine that is but
 a state in name, a client state of the Americans,
 and a satrap of Israel.

WHY I HAVE LITTLE OR NO TIME FOR FIGHTING 
THE UPCOMING WAR IN IRAQ

  by Marc Harry Ehrenfrucht

I'm up to my neck resisting the war at home.
  Please do what you can. I don't know about
others, but the Bush/Dulles/Prescott family
has left me completely overwhelmed.

A  LETTER  TO  A  G.I.

(poem from an ex-soldier)

If I were a soldier
   I would complain about D.U.
   I would speak out against war.
   I would insist upon non-violent direct action first.
   I would maintain "force last."
   I would call for the recall of George "Wimp Jr" Bush.
           Point out Dick Cheney's fascist roots.
I would tread lightly on Powell's MANY and varied
transgressions as he may be about the only strand
left holding this planet together.
        (hate every minute of THAT)
        scold the DEA for putting Americans on both 
        sides of the "Scar" border in harm's way.
I would dismantle NORAD AND the Pentagone with my
own bare hands.
        shove an MRE up Ashcroft's nostril.
        prove the FBI and CIA merged back in October, 1979.
        prove Bill Clinton is just as harmful as the Bushs.
        prove as quickly as I can that Lieberman is an anti-christ
        remind all that Tipper is never to be tusted
                        Liddy Dole is much worse!

        Dismantle the USA Patriot Act with my bare hands.
        (or an antique fountain pen)

But I am not a soldier.
Why?
Because I quit about 23 wars ago.
So I shall have to aspire to all this and more 
as a civilian.
Please help me all you can.

 YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY ME FOR THIS LAUGH:

 One of about 3 Quaker jokes in existence 
 (ask the Pope if you don't believe me): 
 Scene is a Friend's Memorial Meeting, a 
 Quaker funeral, which is held just like 
 any other Meeting for Worship. Basically 
 silent, with people standing and speaking 
 as moved by the spirit. So one elderly 
 Friend stands up, remains standing in 
 silence for several minutes, concludes, 
 "as our late Friend so eloquently said," 
 and sits down.
