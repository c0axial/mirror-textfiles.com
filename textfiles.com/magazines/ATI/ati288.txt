Hello, to paraphrase Chevy Chase, "I'm Prime Anarchist 
and you're not. How are you? It's been a good week. A 
really good week. Unless you are central amerikan. But 
we won't go there. This moment anyhow.
  Of course, that's no real reason for ATI coming out
2-5 days late this week is it? Oh well. Deal with it.
Better late than never, right? OK, please don't ask for
your money back, I can't afford it.
  "Da doo doo doo, da da da da - that's all I want to 
say to you."
  How is John Foster Dulles related to the Dulles side
of George W's family? I just learned that he "proposed
using the ultimate weapon to aid the French at Dienbienphu."
[ref]=[Tom Hayden's "The Trial."]
  DOUBLETAKE: Why the _ _ _ _ were we trying to restore
the French to power in Nam in the first place??? Were
we stupid? No wonder we lost even worse than the French
did.
  Where are all the RedWinged Blackbirds???
\DREAM\ Cover charge for a benefit concert. 2 ballot boxes.
Instructions to put $5 in one or the other.
  The first one is marked "DEATH SQUADS" with explanation
that the $$$ WILL be brought to SOA's commandante along
with a picture of how empty or full both boxes were.
  Second box is marked SHUTTING DOWN THE SOA and that
money goes to the annual protests.
  Hope you like this issue. It was a lot of fun to make. 
Right now I'm finishing it up and I've been at it since 
like well, like 8 this morning. And why? A little bit 
about there being lots to do, but mostly the only real
excuse I have is I'm trying to triple-task. The main
thing "distracting me" really is reading through MAN 
files in my new linux, and I'm having the best, most 
grueling, fun, hectic, but enjoyable adventurous time 
with it.
  I'm going to be SO NOT USING the new MS OS on this
machine when it comes out this October. Yeah, scheduled 
for almost the same week the delayed SirCam worm's 
supposed to hit all the older windows machines.

LETTUCE

Marco: 
Thanks for the email.
All the army here was trained in the 
School of the Aremicas here. You  know 
that the last army goverment here was 
with "pupils" of there.
  Well, they kill 30.000 people here 
and still free and working. In all  
the repression here there are leaders 
from there.
  It's terrible, but it's a common thing 
here.

Note:  this in no way is a justification of either one 
of the following  acts
who's more of a humanitarian?
Timothy McVeigh  or
Madeline Albright?
consider this:
when the armed forces accidently (or not) kill civilians
this is called "colateral damage"
Timothy McVeigh having called
the children in the daycare he killed colateral damage
later sayed he wished they wern't there.
Madeline Albright, when asked if what she thought
about killing about one million Iraqi civilians,
mostly children (I presuming also collateral damage),
responded, in saying,
(I or we?) "think it is worth it"

A usufruct does not amount to actual ownership of property. 
Whatever language lawmakers and lawyers choose to employ 
is not my concern so long as the spirit of divine ownership 
is maintained.
  I do not dispute the fundamental importance of morality to 
society, but this is something to be learned from our parents
and teachers and then put into practice on both an individual 
and, to some extent, a social plane. Morality may or may not 
be reflected directly in law...

  North himself had been on a flight to Frankfurt when
Hasenfus went down. He was on his way to a meeting with
the Relative, carrying a Bible inscribed by Reagan. When
he returned he went to work trying to repair the unraveling
situation. On October 12 he wrote to McFarlane, the very
active former national security advisor, on how the tide
might be turned: "We urgently need to find a highpowered
lawyer and benefactor who can raise a legal defense for
Hassenfus [sic] in Managua. If we can find such persons
we can not only hold Gene and Sally Hassenfus together
(i.e., on our side, not pawns of the Sandinista propaganda
machine) but can make some headway of our own in counter-
attacking in the media."

BRINGING THE POWER OF THE PHONE BACK TO YOU

reprinted from textfiles.com

...anyway, to try my hand at this, I've created the TEXTFILES.COM 
Phone Information Center, a little developer project hanging off 
of the Tellme Networks main demonstration line. The Phone Center 
is essentially a collection of phone boxing "philes" read by a 
professional voice and allowing you to try it out. For example, 
you say the words "Red Box" into the phone, and you start hearing 
about red boxes! Or you press a key on your keypad (like the 3 key) 
and the voice tells you what frequencies the DTMF for that key 
represents.

To check this out, do the following:

1. Call 1-800-555-TELL.
2. Wade through an Ad, wait for "Main Menu".
3. Press 1-26937 (BOXES)
4. Enjoy!

I'm not getting money for this, it's just a lark, 
check it out, hope you like it.

THINK ABOUT IT
How many radio stations are advertising
"Stopless hits?" Would you say it's an
indication that the advertising world is
just getting way out of hand or what?
JMNSHO: just my not so humble opinion -


AND IN UNREAL NEWS TODAY:

POWELL TO VISIT BOGOTA TO APPEASE U.S. 
CONCERN WAR IS NOT ESCALATING FAST ENOUGH.
Colombia - (PAWN)
  Secretary of State Collins Powell will visit Colombia next 
month to discuss US support for making war while pretending
to curtail increased narcotics production amid growing concerns 
they are not working, the State Department announced.
  Powell's September visit will follow an LSD trip this week by a 
large delegation of senior US officials led by Powell's Under, Under
Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Marc Gross Man, who 
will also hold talks with senior Colombian Under-under-under Boris
Yeltzin.
  Though not publicly critical of President Andres Pastrami's 
operation WADPUD, short for war, anti-drug / pro-drug initiative, 
US officials have said they are deeply troubled it doesn't seem to 
be making progress.
  "We've supported his efforts to fan the flames all along," said State 
Department spokesman Richard "Tricky" Boucher."
  "We've also been very disappointed and concerned about the amounts of
choice cocaine and killer bud that makes its way in country by "well, 
gosh - who knows how???" 
  "We'll be looking forward to discussing this situation with President 
Pastrami," he said of the Colombian leader's attempts to encourage war
with the FARC by granting them ownership of many new toys such as guns,
ammo, land mines and even new lands.
  "This has been an important part of his efforts, and we'll want to get 
his thoughts as he faces this situation now."
  Boucher said both Powell and Gross Man would be visiting the country 
"to underscore our continuing support" for the president's war initiative 
but the trips come just ahead of an October deadline for campaign 
contributions from pharmaceutical; oil and gas; and uranium mining 
companies.
  Washington has assessed that 1.4 billion dollars in Pastrami
assistance would be exactly what he would need to destroy the
entire planet, so they've committed just 1.3 billion.
  Sources close to Powell say that the FARC will no longer need to rely 
largely on the illegal cocaine trade for its funding, as soon as the 
territory ceded to them can begin yielding yams, bananas, avocado and 
poppy seeds.
  Pastrami has drawn fierce criticism from senior members of his armed 
forces for giving the FARC almost what they need to wipe out the entire
planet.
  "Jesus, asshole," said one Commandante who insisted on anonymity, 
"you're starting to sound like a friggin' Yankee." He was referring to
the fact that the land Pastrami gave away contains many secret devices
that both Colombian Military and US Military have left behind over the
past two decades of absolute peace.
  In addition, the United States has said it is troubled by the arrest 
two weeks ago of three alleged members of the IRA suspected of training 
FARC rebels in the use of explosives.
  "Now they know our REAL secret weapons," said former president Ronald
Reagan in a recent press conference at the Betty Ford Clinic which 
reporters maintain was nothing more than a random outburst that should 
be ignored, and underscored as completely without context.

Mead, Westvaco Merge in $1.3B Deal; Hope For Georgia Pacific Buyout
By Chris Geoffersen
PAWN Business Writer
Wednesday, Aug. 29, 2001; 9:33 a.m. EDT
STAMFORD, Conn. -- Mead Corp. and Westvaco Corp. are merging in a 
$1.3 billion deal designed to forge two midsize paper companies into 
a better looking global employee of a company like Microsoft, Ford
or hopefully Georgia Pacific.
  The combined company, to be named WestNileMeadViralMarketingCorp., 
will own $8 billion worth of Sam Goody, MusicLand, Strawberry
Records and Best Buy stock options, in addition to coated and 
specialty papers, consumer and office products and specialty 
chemicals, the companies announced Wednesday.
  Top executives expect the combined company will be able to 
receive offers from both Microsoft AND GeorgiaPacificFortJames-
RiverHowardInternationalPaperHarvester3MExxonMobilWarnerTime-
LambertLynch but will pick the Georgia group to compete more 
effectively with global forest products industry heavyweights 
like Seagrams Corp. and AOL Paper Co.
  "I think it is a good combination," said Ana Torka, eleventh
vice president at Merrill Lynch in New York. "I do believe it 
could act as a catalyst for further consolidation in the industry."
  The merger comes just a week after the Swedish business daily 
Dagens Industri reported that Stora Enso, a Swedish-Finnish forest 
products group, was in merger talks with Lord Hanson and the
Cavenham Partners, LLC. But the companies declined to comment on 
the report and some analysts said the chances of that merger were 
unlikely because the companies were focused on laying off 
thousands. 
  Sources close to Raytheon, McDonald Douglas and Gateway2001
spoke off the record saying, "Oots!"

For Unreal News, Bob Donovan.

  Who are the 6 manufacturers we're mentioning??? OK, here
goes. In one helicopter will be HP, Dell and IBM. In the other
is Gateway, Sony and Compaq.
