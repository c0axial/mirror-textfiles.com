Chicago, wILL. (PAWN) - AIR & RAIL LAYOFF 30K IN FRIENDLESS MERGER.
United and Amtrack will become one big transportation company, thanks
to a corporate merger of the two conglomerates. They will each fold
their phone card companies and multi-level network marketing divisions
into one big megacorp. Redundancies will be severed overnight in good
form.
  "Fly and ride the friendly skies and rails," said chief spokesman
and pillow flufferupper Fred Frendly. "Now I can do five jobs for the
wage of 1.5!!! Would you like fries with that?" He went on to say that
this is really good for the US economy. Especially people benefitting
will be people in Plains, GA.
  "Would you like a bag or two of peanut?"

 PUBLISHER's COLUmN...later today, from cspan2 
a discussion of homer's odyssey... Christopher 
Hitchens!
...hi there, I'm prime anarchist and 2day we 
bring U a big phat ati in the middle of the
week. & Y? Because we filled up so much 2 fast, 
and got so many submissions - we simply decided
2 bROADcast 2nite, & again this coming sun or mon.
  Now there's a rumor that ATI will endorse
Nader. That was topic 4 4 different letters 
2 the editor that won't get printed here 2day. 
Y? 2 reasons, each said the same durned thing 
almost the same durn way, and we couldn't get
hold of any1 at the return adDRESSes, so we've 
reason 2 believe the names aren't "pseudo" 4 
ANY of the listed "good reasons." Plus they 
used way 2 many foulmouth words. [and just what 
IS 2 many filthy words 4 an ATI? It's more the 
intent than the word; & the redundancy. If a 
swear keeps the phrase, sentence, paragraph
or even an entire story going, for Christ's
sake keep it. (Or 4 ALL R sakes really...)
But if U'r just trying 2 sound like
Hunter Thompson or Richard Nixxon, give
it up, ok? And PLEEZ!!!
  Conjugate your verbs properly or don't
send me anything. There's nothing worse
than noticing that some1 can't tell the
difference between a verb and a noun.]
  [for eggs ample: in the phollowing
sentence "eat shit and die," a writer is
leaving it completely unclear whether
s/he meant there 2 B 2 verbs or 2 nouns. 
Or perhaps even 3 verbs.]
  Anyhew, I digress horribly here. I haven't
endorsed Ralph Nader. And I won't. Just
because I think Gore "W" Bush and Bilbo
"Baggins" Bore each suck raw eggs worse
than the other 1, doesn't make an endorsment.
Don't B silly.
  I am going 2 VOTE 4 him and his running-
mate Winona LaDuke, but I don't ENDORSE them.
I don't endorse ANYBODY. U'R welcome 2 vote
> 4 whoever the "hello operator" U desire 2
represent you and U'r country. Who do U think 
we R N Eway, Nu Yourk Slimes? WaSHIngTon Toast?
  OK, next story. Y R we coming out twice
this week? A few reasons. There's an election
coming up. And in R effort 2 find plenty of stuff
that has nothing 2 do with voting 2 offset N E thing 
we cover about the elections, so U won't have 2 think 
that all we talk about is voting when there's tons of 
other news out tHERE that's not 2 do with the eLectIONs - 
elections, schmelections, well you get my point.
  A bunch of stuff has come R way, and I made the
decision on my own 2 publish today, and once more
Sunday or Monday night. 
  Buried in this zine and the next will B something
resembling a "special election issue(s)." I've come
2 know that what gets me the most new suBscRIpTiONS
and the least "unsuBscRIBEs," is - whenever the press
beats something 2 death - 4 this 'zine to B out standing 
[sic.] inso meth ingelse [tired.] that ISN'T riddled with 
the haughty, heated hated topic at hand.
  & Y stop now? We provided that service during OJ
Simpson's trial, during Clitnon's imPEACH imPAIRments,
when the Packers went 2 N'Orleans, Desert Swarm and
Panty Shield, Brosnia, Some Allya etc. When Matt BeDrudge 
and Dan RatherNot were beating the drum slowly for 
Israel's jusTIFICATION 2 bomb the tar out of human B-ings
that R only slightly different than them in that their 
economics [etym. def: ykonos - house; miks - keeping : 
housekeeping] R a little different.
  Did we harp on "TOP 10 REASONS 2 BOMB PALACE INDIANS"
or anything like that?
  NO. We did NOT. & Y? Because I'm a journalist and
a reporter and a gonzo musician. NOT A FRIGGIN' SLAVE
OF THE CORPORATE PENTAGON MEDIA. THE LAST TIME I WAS
EVER A SLAVE OF THE SCHMORPORATE PENTAGRAM MEDUSA WAS
1986. AND 2 QUOTE THE ONLY PROFOUND THING THE WHO
EVER SAID I "WON'T BE [sic. AND tired.] FOOLED AGAIN."
  No, we don't harp on the same things the corporate
media harp on. And Y is that? Because of journalistic
ethics, at their tRUEst, that's Y!
  Accuracy, Brevity and Clarity, the abc's of journos!
2 call a plaid a plaid, is accuracy. To call it something
U'R advertisers, & the silent partners, & the people
who own your press, all agree U should call it, is NOT
accuracy. To digest a ton of disinfo, misinfo, jargon, 
slant, rhetoric and propaganda then, using your well-tuned 
BS detector 2 get 2 the bottom of what's really going on &
pay out the truth in 5K of content that any 11th grader can 
understand, now THAT'S brevity. And we already dis-cussed 
clarity at the same time. (something ATI and PAP is always 
willing 2 sacrifice 4 the other 2, whenever needed.)(unlike 
some other press which like 2 sacrifice some of the other 2 
4 the 3rd.) & U'll notice the word "balance" doesn't
come into that equation unless indirectly, eh? Y? B cause 
the word in both connotation and denotation has been soiled 
by the corporate media since about 1891!
That's Y. Here at ATI we SELDOM interview someone about 10X 
farther 2 the right of Atila the Hun & attempt 2 offset him
with some1 just a tiny bit more fascist than Jesse "hangsover
the" Helms in the name of balance. And further, I should 
mention we never have N E desire 2 take some1 like Jesse 
Jackson (another conservative racist bastard in real life - 
I'm talking about his personna) and attempt to offset him 
with someone like Oliver North so there is balance. If U 
want THAT, turn on your teLEviSION or pick up 1 of U'r 
all-2-expensive local papers.
  This rant brought 2 you by the phonebook. 1 of the most 
"yellow," propagandistic, rhetoric-filled print media U'll 
have EVER subSCRIBEd 2.

         -Prime Out-

oh, ps: Our #'s run is phat this week. Enjoy the
heck out of it. U'r in 4 1 fun journey.

& pps: LETTUCE alone, leaf me be. We've got letters,
have we got letters. Anyone wanna keep that fine
thing going? ati@etext.org (hint, hint, hint.)

One more ps: (I promise I'm not a zapatista, really)
Trent Lott. Yuck. oct 29th. (black sunday?) I wonder 
how the DOW will do tomorrow? [ed note: it was up
250 or so. hmmmm. Can you say "more artificial than
a store bought limb?] Drop an eye on THAT...

It's the year 2000, I'm going to watch
Christopher Hitchens discuss Homer's Odyssey
on CSpan with a 286 laptop in front of me.
Should I grab a notepad instead? Or a Tandy
model 100? What's more appropriate?
Two laptops would just look, act and feel
too weird. The null modem cable from hell.
Can you say spaghetti from olden times?

Just glad the laptop's not current. That
would be a horrible bore. The mouse, the
windows, the hum of the kHz. Yuck.

Oh: ppps: No, I don't have source code for WINDslOWS.

Do you know that the "Columbine hs student" part 
is most likely a hoax, as I've seen that text before.  
A good improvement to an urban myth / spam

Quite ironic. I've seen this forward for years and 
suddenly now it's written by a Columbine student. 
I think we should start punishing people that send 
us forwards.  Collect'em all, and when you have a 
substantial amount (say, 2000 of them) forward 
them all to the bloke that sends you one. 
  Maybe he'll get the hint.
  Maybe.

First Public Announcement: 
  Spirit, a new female white buffalo was born approximately 
May 1. No humans were present at her birth, and therefore 
it is assumed to be a natural birth. Spirit is currently 
living with her mother and father, in the same field. 
Both are alive and well, and living with a small group
of other buffalo. 
  "This is a very important sign, to not only our people, 
but all people and all nations everywhere... 
  This is the seventh, and comes in times of great importance. 
I will pray on this for full understanding." 
~ Chief Arvol Looking Horse,
19th Generation Keeper of  
the Sacred White Buffalo Pipe  
"She is approximately 6 months old, now. Very gentle. We thought
she should be shared with people to let them know the legend is 
alive and well. We have seen how the others were marketed, and 
we do not want to make her into circus, but we want her to just 
relax and enjoy her surroundings." 
"She is very far from any road... hardly any one has seen her... 
but maybe 10 people." 
"We have just been enjoying her because she is so very gentle." 
~ A friend of Spirit

All Hallows Eve Eve - Green Bay, WI
I just got Republicrat Al Gore to defend his
mining policy on the land of the U'Wa inside
Colombian borders.
  "SHOW ME YOUR OTHER HAND!" barked the Secret
Service man to Gore's left [my right] when I
chucked Gore's left shoulder with my right hand.
  I showed the SS man my other hand after he
barked his command a second time.
  "The U'Wa, Al," I shouted and I swear to God
a human being somewhere deep inside Al looked
me dead straight in the eyes and told me that
the "environmentalists down there are split on
that issue right now, and that's who I'm taking
my counsel from at this time."
  I told him while I still had a chance, "Ingrid
lived one mile, I mean one hour north of here,
Mr. Gore and I'm not split on this one at all..."
  "Well, good," he told me, shaking his head up
and down giving me his continued undivided-looking
attention. Of course right then I said I believe
that "mining just plain sucks, period end of
paragraph, how about a moratorium?" And that's
when he moved on to the next person, but not
before giving me that one look my republican
mom always gives when you've said something that
sounds completely wacked out, and she'd rather
not have even heard it.

KUDOS TO INDYMEDIA DOT ORG

Yesterday, Ted Koppel said good things about 
http://www.indymedia.org on a Boston NPR call-in 
show.
  "Are you familiar with indymedia org?" asked a 
caller.
  "Yes I am," said Koppel who went on to say he
thinks it's finally shaking up the [I don't remember
if he used to word] ostriches in his field. He
said there's always going to be a market for 
people like him because a lot of viewers and
readers aren't diligent enough to go beyond
corporate media for their information, but now
"any kid can spend less than $500 for a digital
camera and less than $500 for an internet connection
with a computer and start disseminating content.
  He said he was glad to see this change.

Here's program notes from my local station's 
broadcast of it:
6:00pm THE CONNECTION 
After six, THE CONNECTION welcomes Ted Koppel for a 
discussion about the success of Nightline and how it has
become the franchise for serious journalism on television.
