George W Bush is a dirty rotten scum.

  [potentially libellous statement.]

Why?

1) with all the money floating near him, 
he bathes daily; sometimes twicely. And
sometimes while Laura's even looking. So 
don't call this old-money middle-aged fan-
atical right-wing fundamentalist X-tian 
racist whiteman dirty.

2) last time he ever drank something rotted 
was decade(s) ago. At least, far as anyone'll 
prove, living to tell it. So don't call this 
violent, drug addicted, frothing-at-the-mouth 
scum-sucking dirt-bag, "rotten." Don't even
think about it.

3) scum RISES to the top. Bush? placed there!

Wed - Nov 6, the day Maryland people are
supposed to vote instead of yesterday.

[http://dc.indymedia.org/front.php3?article_id=37981]

I'm drinking a $2 cup of coffee at my
favorite Wisconsin kavarna (well, counting
tip) and pondering last night's electoral
orgy. 
  Can I have predicted this? No way. In 
fact, I guessed the opposite. Called for 
GOP to lose half a dozen Senate seats and
a dozen or so in the House. I figured 
they'd lose governorships all over the
country.
  Well, my home state gained a democrat
in the mansion, but it doesn't look good
for the rest of the nation, eh? And trust
me, it's not nearly is "good" here as it
looks. 
  OK, besides being able to say the nation
is clearly divided on partisan, color and
class lines, what can you tell about an
election chock full of races so knife-edge
close that anyone demanding a recount will
get one?
  And one where it was reported that less
than 46% of eligible voters went anywhere
near polling places? 

http://www.nathannewman.org/EDIN/.election/.1994/.1994anal/.nathan.html

  Can you say fraud? Can you say games of
avarice? You can say "Caligula," but what's
it matter any more? What we've got is an
enormously self-empowered republican USAKKK 
Chief Executive OfficerAndOfficer who can 
successfully remain in denial and behave as 
if he has a mandate.

http://www.pir.org/gw/pigs.txt

  People who had a healthy fear and loathing
of Ronald Wilson Reagan, John Hull, Oliver
North and Henry Kissinger would be wise to
stick their finger down their throat, and
once all the insides have spilled out, with
vomit still on their breath, say, "You ain't
seen nothing yet."

  Wow, "Other Side Of The Mountain" is featured 
at one of those MP3.com stations out there. 
  Kind of affirms my faith in my engineering,

a Z studios production or a Carl engineering, 
or a Heid advertising job. And someone still 
considered it for one of their radio stations.
  Neat.

POEM 
received by email from a friend
in konegituk. It was not titled. 
:)

It's Midnight, Virgo has risen
that is the time that is now

Within this moment I am certain
of one thing
only that I am.

Nietche and god are dead
yet I live
Camus has found his rock
Sartre, with Frodo, lives...

and the only thing I am is
me.




++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
%Moderators' comment: ATI is a nice 
antidote to those who see no political 
consciousness amongst the CU. Like 
most e-mail mags, the substance has 
slowly changed and matured over the 
years, and it is becoming a nice mix 
of political, technical, and other 
information of relevance to computerists.
Thanks to Ground Zero and Prime Anarchist 
for putting out a nifty publication.

 \ Sitting In Front \
  \ Of Dahmer's Old  \
   \ House. --feature \

The former AG of Wisconson won governorship
last night. I voted for him, but you know 
what? I didn't want to; I wanted his
assistant, Barbara Lawton. So I was stuck
holding my nose and pencilling him in.
  100,000 Wisconsin police officers chipped
in and bought a full-page ad in the local
daily newspaper endorsing him yesterday
morning. . .  so you see some of why I had
to hold my nose. 
  So we're getting almost as much police-state
with our government as if we'd voted GOP, eh?
Creeeeeeeeeeeeepy.
  Something else happened yesterday and I must
ask this. Rhetorically or outright, I'm not
exactly sure, but I gotta ask. Rumors flew
all over town that Alexie Patterson turned up 
dead at the bottom of a lake or a river. 
  A full day later there's still no confirmation, 
but rumors are still cycling out as we speak. In
case you don't know, Alexie's been missing since 
last spring or so. She's black; and almost as
famous as the little white boy(s) who turned up 
missing at about the same time in 5 or 10 cities
around the U.S. 
  Doesn't this sound a little eerie? Awry? Isn't
this something a politician might use to attempt
a controllable sway of votership? 
  You want my honest opinion? I wouldn't put it
past ANY republican OR democrat these days.
  Yesterday hundreds of prostitutes, mostly
women, some men demonstrated in front of Paris'
Senate demanding their rights to conduct business. 
Which brings me back to the governor and the 
ex-governor and who gets the mansion. Which 
one should I have chosen? WHO CARES, WHEN THEY 
BOTH DO IT ONLY FOR MONEY!
  So what would Dahmer do? Would he have voted
at all? I doubt it. He was too busy. He most 
likely would have found some young boy (most
often poor, usually black) who'd just snuck
into a bar, and invited him over to his place
for some harmless fooling around, and a drink
or two and some cool music. Then he would've
strangled him, ate most of his remains, pickled 
his skull and tucked it away in Arlington National 
Cemetary, er, uh, er, I mean his refrigerator.
  But then isn't that what our government is
doing to us right now as I type???

This zine ends with a poem.

My Poems Are Gone
by Sondra Ball

My poems are gone:
torn by prying fingers
with no respect
for art in any form.

It's only one more loss:
grief following grief
year after year after year.
I am tired of losing:
a daughter's death,
a nephew's death,
a mother's death.

What shall I do with my sorrow?

God, what have you done with your sorrow:
grief following grief
year after year after year
through the long ages of creation.
Even your son was torn
by prying fingers
with no respect
for art in any form.

But you called him back
with a sudden shout,
a brilliant burst of light.

Today, I will write a poem.

Oh, no dedication this week. Rather, this comment
about the national mid-term elections. I find it 
incredibly ironic that in places where there were
sharp voter turnout increases, most places saw a 
Republican win by a certain margin. And likewise, 
wherever there were sharp voter turnout decreases, 
these places saw a Republican win by equal margins!

Reminds me of 10th grade chemistry class when Dr.
Lupien fell asleep during the mid-term exam because
of his narcolepsy, and ___ ____ assigned ten of us
who were best at math and science to each do one of
the questions for the entire class. We each got one
question wrong on purpose, but picked arbitrary ones
to be wrong on. Whoo boyeee, when Dr. Lupien came in
the next week, he had a "messed with" look on his face.
"It seems to me," he said, "that each and every one of
you scored a 90 on your test. You all get A's. Very 
good, there was cheating but there was not cheating.
Let the record show." Before slamming the door behind
him, giving us a study hall the rest of the day, he
said, "I will not be this lenient to cheaters next 
quarter."
