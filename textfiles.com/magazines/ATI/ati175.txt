    \/\/\/\/\/    aren't I? This message
is mostly pointed at men; you women will
have to empathize the best you can.
Have you ever been pee'ing in a urinal
and there's a big huge bug in there?
Maybe a spider, maybe a potatoe bug, 
maybe a beetle, maybe a cockroach,
maybe a member of some ethnic group you
don't like. OK, not so much that, who
would fit in a urinal. But I was pee'ing
many times and there's a legged creature
marching around in there and this is 
what has bugged me all these years.
   Do you play around and aim at him
and see how hot and wet you can get him
before he's completely yucky?
   Do you deliberately miss hoping to 
save him (or her, who knows?) his life?
   Keep peeing right on top 'til he
floats down the drain?
   Flush the urinal or leave it for
the next person hoping the bug will 
find other lodging by then?
   What on earth could I, the prime
anarchist be jabbering about?
   If you guessed "the environment"
all by yourself then you are not dumb.
If not, just think about this the 
next time you walk by a urinal:
(even if you're not a guy) 
 -_-Should I clean up-_-
 -_-the planet myself-_-
 -_- or leave it for -_-
 -_- someone else??? -_-

There's an earth day, and a sunday
but no moon day? And don't give me
this "what's monday" lunes, lunacy,
lunar. I don't buy it.
  That's my fun day; I don't have 
to run day. Gandhi and me, we fast
on Mondays. I think it should be,
er, uh, Well heck with it. Ready?
   I hereby declare Monday to be
national day of phun.
   A high holy day in the Anarcho-
Whirld. Phun For Everyone. Phunday.
Do something phunny, play a phun
prank on sumone. Pray, prey or play -
I always say. But pretty please with
pablum on top. Please pass the pepper.
People, listen up. Sunday may be a 
day of rest, but next phunday, let's
all play.

LETTUCE WE'VE HAD IN OUR 
FRIDGE THIS PAST WEEK:

To: ati@etext.org 
Subject: Re: april fools!
Thanks.  JC

To The Editors -
Subject: beware of this 
         telephone tap!!

I got this yesterday and since 
I'm skeptical of things like 
this I called my phone company 
this morning and talked to their 
Technical Services...(GTE).
The fellow I read this to confirmed 
it is true and can be done!  
So be aware.
   "I received this from another 
party, but have read about it in 
the paper & my consumer report  
magazines.  It IS true & very scary.
Please read on.........
  I received a telephone call last 
evening from an individual identifying
himself as an AT&T Service technician 
who was conducting a test on our
telephone lines.
  He stated that to complete the test 
I should touch nine (9), zero (0), 
the pound sign (#) and then hang up. 
Luckily, I was suspicious and refused.
Upon contacting the telephone company, 
I was informed that by pushing 90#,
you give the requesting individual 
full access to your telephone line, 
which allows them to place long 
distance telephone calls billed 
to your home phone number.  
I have verified this information with 
UCB telecomm, Pacific Bell, MCI,
Bell Atlantic, GTE and NYNEX.
Please beware.
DO NOT press 90# for ANYONE. The GTE 
Security Department requested that I
share this information with EVERYONE 
I KNOW...  
   [this goes on to request many 
    different ways to disseminate
    this information. I won't trouble
    you with all that. I trust the 
    person who sent us this, so haven't
    called GTE or Ameritech myself,
    and I haven't gone to a payphone
    and tried it out or anything. 
    Perhaps journalistic ethics are
    such that I should but I'm tired,
    today so you'll have to phollow
    through. I did check the "CIA Hoaxes"
    website and it didn't show up there
    yet, so there's a great chance this
    is on the up and up. More later...
    Maybe you heard it here, here, here,
    first.]

OPEN LETTER TO CHAD:
I'm swift learning that many 
members of the KLA are major
narcotics trafficers, and that
they might not have been if the
US CIA hadn't gone in a decade
ago and enticed them.

I don't forgive Milesovic, but
as I coin the phrase "bilateral
genocide" I begin to wonder if
it might not be mostly the US
department of justice' fault...

JOHN BENALLY STATEMENT. 1999AD
My name is John Benally and I am 
'Where the water meets together' 
Clan and born for edge water, 
my patrilineal clan is Apache Clan. 
My matrilineal Grandfather is 
'Many Goat Clan'.
We need all the support we can 
at this time, a pressure on the BIA, 
the Dept of Interior.
We are threatened with losing our 
way of life by relocating to the
outside world. It is very important 
that we preserve our culture and
ways of life. We can't live in 
western world. Our choices.. 
our ways of life.. being on land 
excercising our belief and we 
don't want any U.S. Government 
interferance with our life. This 
is on behalf of all the ways
on Indian land in this hemisphere. 
We don't like the human abuse,
natural resource abuse thats happening 
in our nation.
As we are all aware as five fingered 
family... we are ALL aware that we
are losing all the differant 
atmosphere and depletion of our ozone, 
to where we're liable to sacrifice 
under these consequences.
We all know that once everything was 
in balance and pure, now we all know 
it's out of balance. Climate, global 
changes are happening, it's here, 
greenhouse effect is here. These are 
my awareness's and my concern.. 
then I think we are all in the same 
boat. So act now, pressure the United 
States Government to tell them 
that they're liable for it.
That means industrial nation, fossil 
fuel addiction, and nuclear addict.
And thank you very much.

A Poem
[sometimes you just gotta repeat 
something for emphASIS. This was
written by someone who's 
13 years old.]

I live in a place called free,
where you do what you do,
and you be what you be.
No one is exiled or 
shunned at first galnce,
everyone here
is given a chance.

Too bad you must die to 
be where I've been
to hear what I've heard,
to see what I've seen.

No longer do I, feel 
superior to those,
who once had no friends
'cause they had no cool 
clothes.

In heaven you see,
we are all equal,
I am to you, as 
you are to me
