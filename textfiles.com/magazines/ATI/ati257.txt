S    HEY BILL: An Open Letter To President Clinton
U  How's your wrist?
N    Boy howdy! You must have Writers Cramp by now,
D  penning out all them initiatives these days. I
A  got me one of them caveats for you, though.
Y  They-all don't mean diddly squat if you

W  don't release Leonard Peltier, ok?
I    When I stood next to Amy Carter at Rutgers in
L  1988 and signed my first Peltier petition - THAT
L  one going TO Jimmy Carter - I thought it might take

N  another year or two more at the most, Bill. Alls
E  we needed to do now was show how incompetent, 
V  malicious, and zealous about their malice and 
E  inanity the Federal Bureau's been all these years.
R    But then who'd'a thunk up Ruby Ridge, Waco and

B  I'm not even gonna tell you again about Elian!
E    You want my honest opinion I think your FBI

T  (just one of many paramilitary at your disposal)
H  blew up the Murrah building AND the USS Cole too.
E    On your watch, Bill.

S  Free Leonard Peltier.
A    Now.                                    \
M  Before it's too late.                      \

"The media doesn't respond to education. They respond to sales which
respond to hysteria and sensationalism. The audience would have to be
educated. But the audience doesn't understand technology well enough
to judge what is 'good' hacking and what is 'bad' hacking. Most people
don't find the humor and laughter in pranks to be a good thing. Most
people are too old to play pranks themselves and oppose other people
having fun in ways that they can't. The press makes them sure that they
are right and they don't have to ask deep and skeptical questions about
such things to discover the real truths. They would see that most hacking
is akin to parking too long in a 30 minute zone or driving 70 mph in a 65.
But this would be too painful and not as entertaining as how they really
see these things."

LETTUCE

I saw this in ATI 256 and thought you needed to know this:
  GE doesn't own MTV.
  MTV is owned by Viacom, which owns Paramount Pictures. 
Viacom, in turn, is owned by CBS.
  Remember all those "Beverly Hillbillies" reruns in the 
70's? After CBS retired the series in '71, CBS sold the 
distribution rights to Viacom, along with a lot of other 
CBS shows. Why? In '69, the FCC told CBS to sell rights 
to shows that were on the network. Needless to say, that
rule was thrown out not very long ago....

Dear Friend,
Remember the first time you built a web site?
You spent weeks, perhaps months on it.
  It was your masterpiece. You showed it 
to all of your family and friends and everyone 
loved it.

WHO GOT ME INTERESTED IN BAFFLER MAGAZINE.
Published on Thursday, December 14, 2000 in FT
      America's Sucker-in-Chief
    by Thomas Frank 
  After a decade choked with fake populisms - presidents 
munching Big Macs, national leaders emoting at town hall 
meetings, chief executives listening to focus groups and 
online chat rooms, and every billionaire the object of his 
own grass-roots movement - it finally came down to this: 
an election in which the power and righteousness of the 
common people were everywhere celebrated and in which only 
the power and righteousness and almighty millions of the 
corporation mattered...

     What is wrong with it?
     THIS IS A RELIST OF ITEM #428865889. it is a hunk 
     of garbage. i hate nylon strings. this thing has 
     a break at the neck joint, look at the picture. 
     needs your gullible optomistic over-estimation 
     of your own luthier skills. 

     Can I fix it?
