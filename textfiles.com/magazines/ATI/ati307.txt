Aight, who changed my Shakira???
  Why'd you make her look, act and
sound like you added Jewel to Britney
and divided by two? You ruined her!!!
Give her back. She was talented when
she was singing in Spanish and bringing
tones true to Colombia. 
  Now she just seems like a cheap flamenco
dancer singing a couple bars of "Oops I
did it again," or something.
  Do any of you know how to produce something
without ruining it? Can you be true to sound
of a song without refrying it for mainstream
over-consumption?
  I can see it now. "Wow, nice traditional
tones, nice movement, nice wow, it's got
something no other song before it we've ever
heard. 
  Get rid of all that. Have her shake her rump 
and sing 'oo la la' a couple times, yeah. Now 
the breasts, have her cup her breasts and sing 
a couple of those high notes but not too many. 
Nope, too many. Just one and a half of those 
notes. Nah, never mind, we'll dust that out 
with ProTools."
  When can we have Shakira back - was her
contract one year? Or two quarters or what?
Because the world needs her. Not you money
grubbing scum. What do you think you are,
top-of-the-world? 
  Control freaks.

[23:34] <zapATIsta> you know, I own an expensive 
pair of koss headphones, but I also have a pair 
of very old radio shack nova 40s that I bought 
for $5 in a pawn shop that are about 10 times 
better.

LETTUCE:

(i wish i had a blog to post this on)

So my mom got one of those nifty new white iBook for Xmas.  It came with
OS 9 installed, and with the installation CDs for OS X.  We stuck the CD
in, clicked OK, rebooted once, and she was running OS X.

The next day we went to my grandparents house.  Two of my uncles were also
visiting, but we didn't see them much.  It seems they were trying to
install Windows XP on my grandparents PC which was running Windows 98.

Not just any two uncles, but my uncle from Seattle who is a Senior
Researcher at Microsoft, and my uncle from San Francisco who is a very
expensive PC consultant.

Well Seattle uncle spent Wednesday trying to install Windows XP.  After
many hours he managed to install it, but Office stopped working.  The rest
of the day was spent trying to debug Office.

Thursday was spent attempting to re-install Windows 98.  The hard drive
was erased and re-formatted.  3 times!  Between the two of them, total man
hours were about 18.  Early evening they got a fresh, install of Windows
98 running on the many times reformatted hard drive.  However it would
take until 11pm before the modem would work, and lots of downloading
drivers to this or that laptop and freighting them over by floppy. (though
they had never had to install drivers for this modem before)

We left to come home Friday afternoon.  Last I saw they were 2 hours into
a struggle to re-install Front Page.  Grandpa was confused about why his
bookmarks were gone. (hint:  they probably disappeared with one of those 3
disk re-formats)  and Grandma was promising to never, ever complain about
a computer problem again.  (the whole exercise began because she mentioned
that the computer had been crashing a lot lately)

   [ed note: woah. Remember that old slapstick routine where the guy
    can't get his car-door to fully close because it's bent up to much
    and then he un-bends it and gets it closed but the next time opening
    it falls to the ground? Then he picks it up and places it on, hits 
    it once, smiles and the back door falls off? Touches the back door 
    about to pick it up and put it on and one of the wheels falls off, 
    so he kicks the wheel really hard and the trunk pops up?]

Marco, according to my calculations you are number 452,278,001 in line 
to become president of Argentina. At the present rate of presidential 
traffic I suggest that you ask your boss for if you can take the afternoon 
off on Wednesday of next week. I'm sure your boss won't mind -- it won't 
tie you up for very long ... you'll be back at work by Thursday morning.

  OVERTIME
     a poem by BMC

  Getting high, not intentionally,
  I stain, you sprays lacquer - no masks.
  Doors, moldings, pieces I can no longer identify
  circling, singing, surrounding me with work
  for the low low price of life energy.
  Talking, inhaling, breathing,
  finally resting.

  Begging for cigarettes,
  tilting a pinball machine,
  bending a coat hanger 
  up into the chips dispenser.
  This is break time.

  Sitting at a table,
  talking about ambitions
  like owning CD players
  and getting drunk.

  Pete's fucking Kim from accounting,
  But Trent stays late to delay the inevitable.
  His girlfriend waits from him at home,
  So he hides in the back of a truck
  in the shipping bay.

  Rumour is Roger's been showing pictures
  of passed out women on rubber sheets,
  says Roy, whose ears are dripping pus - 
  again, poor fuck
  and half the builders are out back 
  for some secret reason.

  I think
  steel toed shoes don't prevent some things
  like staples in the hand
  120 decibel harmonies spun by an orchestra of machinery
  melamine cuts deeper than you can see through the blood
  miter saws don't discriminate
  clamps pop fingertips plus
  tiredness, depression, anxiety, hopelessness
  brain cells fried on stain
  break's over.

A Prime Anarchist "not necessarily publisher's column" Rant

Alicia Keyes just got called a "piano genius by CNN.
  Hmmm.
  How much is this year's Christiane Amanpour raise? A million
or two? Small peanuts? CNN is trying to train us to have a one-
track mind. All sex aside they're picking one topic at a time
and beating it to death. They've been doing that since long
before OJ Simpson. Remember not knowing whether Michael Jackson
did it or not? We STILL don't know. Settling out of court for
high hundreds of thousand or low millions means almost NOTHING
in his world, right? Nada. Zilch.
  Face it, they're the front lines of the dumbing down of
Amerika. Have they always been like this? Did we just never
notice til this became so obvious? That'd be a study all
to itself. Pre and post Ted Turner; or maybe pre and post
"Chicken Noodle News" or something.

FAVOR: A Note From your not so humble publisher.
  I am an American. I think our international readers here
must know this because they (you) never give me a hard time about
this.
  When my voice and tone are clearly "american," it hasn't even
seemed to bother anyone. Or you're afraid to speak up maybe.
  I know I've worked really hard the last 15 years to get rid of
everything ethnocentric about me, everything "whitebread," or
neo-colonialist. I know I've still got a ways to go, but I'm 
quite satisfied with my success so far. I fell I can tell you 
that, you'll know what I mean.
  A favor I could ask of you maybe, if you notice further ways
I can be less the "bad american" and more the "good american"
without losing the good qualities I've acquired which may or
may not be typically "american" at all, (yeah I know, a shallow
dozen or so. hehehe) please give me a hollar, ok?
  
And in other news...

I saw a moose on CNN. Moose Encounters, they called it. Parents,
you know what? If your daughter comes in having seen a moose and
she says "mommy, there's a donkey in the back yard," school didn't
fail america, clergy hasn't failed, nope -- hollywood did NOT fail
her. The failure is NOT CNN, (at least not this time) Western 
society didn't fail here (again this time) you did.
  For shame -_- are you daft? Have you gotten that disconnected 
from your environment? 
  Holy Shit, this is frightening really, I'm more scared of this
than I am of George Bush's Enron deathsquads. You know the real
definition of intelligence, right? Your ability to adapt to the
dynamics of your environment. 
  NOT YOUR ABILITY TO ALTER THE ENVIRONMENT TO SUIT YOUR NEEDS/
WANTS. And your ability to pass that on to children is something
clost to "intelligence" also. I'm not sure we have a word for
that. A donkey? I'm nervous.

OK, sort of a movie review.         
  Why didn't you tell me they made a love story out of a Moliere
Play??? Nicole Kidman overdoes the "dweem" fonetics (she's singing
"dream" and it comes out "dweem") involved in training a voice even
more overdone than Bob Dylan got his last three CDs, but that is the 
ONLIEST weakness I can find about the production "Moulin Rouge."
  "You kwazy fool, I won't..."
  I never liked Bowie's "Heros" or Elton John's "Your Song," before.
  Listen, to make me like these two songs in a hundred twenty eight
minute soundtrack? Wow. Now that's a brilliant setup.

So there you go. Sort of a movie review.

AFFIRMATION
  A Poem  Written by Assata Shakur
(reprinted from Covert Action Information Bulletin)
[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/096.html]

I believe in living.
I believe in the spectrum
of Beta days and Gamma people.
I believe in sunshine.
In windmills and waterfalls,
tricycles and rocking chairs;
And i believe that seeds grow into sprouts.
And sprouts grow into trees.
I believe in the magic of the hands.
And in the wisdom of the eyes.
I believe in rain and tears.
And in the blood of infinity.

I believe in life.
And i have seen the death parade
march through the torso of the earth,
sculpting mud bodies in its path
I have seen the destruction of the daylight
and seen bloodthirsty maggots
prayed to and saluted

I have seen the kind become the blind
and the blind become the bind
in one easy lesson.
I have walked on cut grass.
I have eaten crow and blunder bread
and breathed the stench of indifference

I have been locked by the lawless.
Handcuffed by the haters.
Gagged by the greedy.
And, if i know anything at all,
it's that a wall is just a wall
and nothing more at all.
It can be broken down.

I believe in living
I believe in birth.
I believe in the sweat of love
and in the fire of truth.

And i believe that a lost ship,
steered by tired, seasick sailors,
can still be guided home to port.
