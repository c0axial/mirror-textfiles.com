to marco:
The following is a brief excerpt from Dr. Timothy Leary's last 
interview in the October 1996 issue of "Magical Blend" magazine:
  "Always put yourself in the best place you can, the best place 
to be. The selection of your location-shot - where you make this 
movie of your life - is tremendously important. Go to a place 
where the people share your interests, yoru aspirations and 
your optimistic point of view. You don't want to go into the 
middle of Bosnia or someplace like that. You have a lot to do 
with the selection of the place you live, your own goals and 
the uniform you wear."

OPEN LETTER TO hARMY CHAPLAIN SGT Paul Van Schie
  When I was training at Fort Gordon, GA to be an army signal
soldier in 1988 I asked every chaplain I encountered about
the part of the 10 commandments where killing another human
being is not a very good idea. I did this in South Carolina
before that, and in Colorado the years that followed while
I awaited my medical discharge from that horrendous job I'd
enlisted for. I think I asked at least thirty different
chaplains in three years. 29 of them came up with some of
the wackiest rationalizations I'd ever heard, until I read:
  "protest against the SOA is built on a foundation
   of lies made by radicals and is in no way supported 
   by the Catholic Church," and "many of who are college 
   students there to get credits because a professor has 
   offered them as an incentive," and "If you truly wish 
   to know what goes on at the SOA ask to come and see,"
   which were sent by SGT Paul Van Schie recently.
  Rather than pick on SGT VanSchie endlessly - which was
my first impulse - I will point out that it were an 
afrikan american southern baptist minister finishing
out his time at Fort Gordon at Signal School as a 
drill sergent, a chaplain and a signal soldier himself
who had the courage and the intestinal fortitude to
answer my question with God's words instead of the
United States hArmy's words. He explained to me that
it is wrong to take a life, period, end of paragraph.
  He wishes his job description were changed to guidance
counsellor rather than chaplain, because in essence
his job was thus:
   After someone trains to kill other people, kills other
   people, or feels good about killing other people, he
   is supposed to give them the spiritual, physical and
   emotional support that will keep them from any suicidal
   tendencies they may harbour, so that they may live out
   their years as a good human being rather than someone
   who felt so horrible about taking lives that they went
   and killed themselves.
  I would suggest that this SGT's job at SOA is on the
same level and he is probably pretty good at it. He 
has probably visited other chaplains, or base psychiatrists
himself in order to be able to continue doing what he
does, and for that I mostly just feel sorry for him.
  But alas, I've got more important things to do, some of
which are writing beautiful songs, running a homeless 
shelter, teaching peace, nonviolence and justice, and 
of course closing down such behemoths as the School of 
Americas.
  I resolved my inner conflict between Christianity and 
practicing murder by choosing to NOT RE-ENLIST. I would
urge the E-5 chaplain to consider the same thing. I don't
want to poke too much fun of him, but the more often he
tries to use the following two things in the same sentence:
1) Christ, 
and 2) military,
he looks all the more foolish.
  May God not only bless us all, but further illuminate.
And the jewish part of me asks Elijah to "hurry up!!!"

ARE YOU? : An OPEN LETTER To Albert Gore, Jr.
OK, let's cut the chase and get the one biggie in 
right from the get go; and I believe this is why 
Nader SHOULD be right in there debating.

Ask Jello Biafra how he feels about the conflict of 
interest with Al Gore championing hr2911, Tipper,
Elizabeth Dole, and Lynn Cheney championing censorship 
and criminal litigation against members of the 
entertainment industry, with Al Gore having control 
of Occidental, while at the same time Occidental was 
one of the three biggest funders of the PMRC nonprofit
organization?

CARWARS: Isn't That A Hoot?
A COLUMNAR COLUMN by the Prime Anarchist

  At the bank this morning I parked next to a Pacer.
No lie. Souped up a little, too. Luggage rack, chrome trim, 
all the rust and body rot is well cared for.
  You know it was an ugly car, that's what it had going 
against it from the beginning.
  No, not ugly. Doofy. That was the best word for it when 
I was, what 17 years old or so? Doofy. Doofus. Yeah, doofy.
  But now it's different. First one I've seen in what,
11 years or more. I don't even think I've seen pictures of 
it very often. Now that the two-party system fanatics have 
killed off all but a few NDNs, er, uh, I mean Pacers, I 
have to say that looking at one this morning -- I'll please
to call it distinctive.

Ozzy Osbourne has once again attacked the Rock and Roll 
Hall of Fame, asking it not to induct his old band Black 
Sabbath. Although the Sabs are on the list of nominees 
for the fourth year running, Osbourne pointed out that
those voting were artists, critics, and people in the 
music business.
  "Why don't they let the fans vote?" he asked in a 
statement released on Monday, September 25. "As it 
stands now, what's the point? It's a joke. It's about 
glad-handing and grandstanding and I don't want any 
part of it."
  Osbourne, who is currently shoring up his rock credentials 
by appearing in Adam Sandler's new film, Little Nicky, made 
the same appeal last year. "Forget about us," he demanded. 
"We're a people's band and that suits us just fine." So 
much for that Black Sabbath/Gerry Rafferty jam session we
were looking forward to.


"I am disappointed the president has resorted to an
overt political Band-Aid 46 days before the election with
his decision to tap into the strategic petroleum

PADERBORN, GERMANY - Overzealous zookeeper Friedrich Riesfeldt 
fed his constipated elephant 'Stefan' 22 doses of animal laxative 
and more than a bushel of berries, figs and prunes before the 
plugged-up elephant finally let fly and suffocated the keeper 
under 200 pounds of poop! Investigators say ill-fated Friedrich, 
46, was attempting to give the ailing elephant an olive oil enema
when the relieved beast unloaded on him like a dump truck full of mud. 
"The sheer force of the elephant's unexpected defecation knocked Mr. 
Riesfeldt to the ground, where he struck his head on a rock and lay 
unconscious as the elephant continued to evacuate his bowels on top 
of him," said flabbergasted Paderborn police detective Erik Dern. 
"With no one there to help him, he lay under all that dung for at 
least an hour before a watchman came along, and during that time 
he suffocated. "It seems to be just one of those freak accidents 
that happen."   


  "I'm going to act incredulous."

WHITEWASHINGTON - (PAWN) Opening scene: Eight pornographers sit
at a witness table facing a committee of diehard fascists on the
Occidental, OPEC, Starbucks and EMI payroll, only hours after
revelations that Peewee Hermit's cartoons had double meanings
imbedded, just like all Disney movies.
  These are HarleyWorld's head honchos, starmakers and star
breakers able to own humans like Hitme Steers, Mandy Less and
McCauley Caulking for under a billion dollars each.
  But now they're pitching a proposal of their own: "buy us a
small island where nothing is ever illegal and we'll give you
free laminates to all our shows and backstage passes to anything
involving Jenifer NoPez, Joe Camel or the King of France."
  There is stirring in the Capitol Hill balcony seats, jammed
with journalists and junior high Dutch girls. Conflict in the
opening scene has grabbed the live studio audience. And 
ratings, through the roof, have never been better.
  Proof that Tipper Gore and the PMRC Review will make it past
a pilot afterall.
  Senator Ron McPain (R) Hanoi, was his usual "I'm agonizing and
taking it out on y'all" self. Then on Wednesday, the NY Rhymes
reported that Peewee Hermit's cartoons contained subliminal
messages that make children as young as six (6 yrs old) smoke
after sex, ask mom and dad which car has more gas in it each
night and stay up way past bed-time watching C-Span.
  Under committee questioning, some studio executives admitted
they're not only "Hair Club For Men" board members, but that
they are also customers.

(PAWN) BALANCE, New Mexico - In a sudden show of journalistic
chutzpah, Monika Lewinski and Oliver North will be squaring off
in a new late nite "news and opinion" show called News Order.
Lewinski, a recovering democrat, will be representing her so
conservative ilk, while North will continue pretending he's
ever the liberal.
  Guests on the pilot show will be David K. Duke, Hal "Burner"
Turner, Bowen Gritz and Brutus Slewa. After that, they will begin
inviting people who are further to the right than these particular
guests.
