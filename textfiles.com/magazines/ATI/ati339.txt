So when is the Untied States going to figure
out that they really CAN send half a million
(500,000) unarmed troops to a hotspot and get
things happening the way they're supposed to?
  When are they going to make the connection
between weapons of mass destruction and terror?
  No, not that people with WOMD might use it, 
but that people without are more (most) likely
to use it against the people with!
  When will they make the direct connection
between Columbine and Clinton; Oklahoma City
and Bush; WTC and other Bush; other WTC and
Reagan!!! 9/11 and Kissinger. All these and 
Kissinger?? Other 9/11 and Kissinger.

I should tell you about a clergydood. His 
name is Father Pete. He spent two years in 
Israel teaching non-violence, aikido and 
non-lethal force to cops. Yes, two years.
He probably reached 150 cops or so. They
all feel a whole new and different kind of
empowerment. 
  Of course, how many young violent men and
women DIDN'T he reach in those couple years??
But you can't focus on things like that when
you've got mustard seeds to plant, can you?
Imagine how many less rubber bullets, live
ammo and concussion grenades will be bought
from Jane's Fighting Weekly, K-Mart and out 
of the back of BoysLife magazine the next 
couple of years. And imagine if you will, how 
many human beings might live one, five, perhaps 
hundreds of "another day(s.)"

Thank you, thank you thank you, Father Pete.

BLAST FROM THE PAST

Hello,

I've browsed the FAQ's offered by such groups
in this heirarchy as anarchism, conservatism and
mental-health but I was wondering if anyone out
there had any information as to the original creation
of the alt.society heirarchy and its original intent.

My point is that a certain Newsgroup in this category
has been 'taken over' by a small group of people
who have written their own FAQ and adopted it as
their motto even though it has nothing to do with the
heirarchy title. Is this legal?

I suppose I should rephrase that.
Consider that someone came to say, alt.society.ati
which has no posters, adopted it as their 'hang out'
and written an FAQ to exclude any who did not
garner their favor. Seeing as how the newsgroup in
question has no regulars, is breaking an FAQ of
an imaginary group grounds for termination?

I am pleased to find discussions around Liberalism
here, I only wish that every newsgroup was as topical
and wonder about the validity of 'making your own group'
under a borrowed heirarchy name and imposing 'rules'.
I suppose in that case, anyone could 'take over' an
abandoned group and call it their own, regardless of its
heirarchy title. Is this correct?

There are plenty of abandoned groups out there,
is there any way to find their originations?
Forgive my ignorance, i'm relatively new to Usenet.

stands a few feet above napalm, torture, exploitation, 
poison gas, A and H bombs, [and] the works. Give a man 
a decent place to stand. He's been wallowing around in 
human blood and vomit and burnt flesh screaming how it’s 
going to bring peace to the world".

DAVID ROVICS SPEAKS FOR ME TOO:
Another Fine Marco Reprint

Statement on copying music: 
FEEL FREE. NO GUILT! 
I certainly appreciate your CD purchases and all that, 
but the main thing is to get the music out there. 
You are hereby encouraged not only to buy CDs, 
but to COPY THEM in part or whole, 
download and distribute MP3's, sing the songs, 
photocopy part or all of the songbooks, etc. 
If you know a radio programmer or other such person 
who you'd like to give a CD to, 
just ask and I'll send you one, 
or feel free to copy one you have and give it to them. 
Have I made my point clear...? 

(Warning: 
I do not speak for other musicians, 
only for myself and my recordings.)

SHORT OBIT OF A FAVORITE PUNK ROCKER

On 21Aug52 John Mellor was born in Ankara, Turkey. 
  Son of a British diplomat, he travelled with his 
parents and had lived in Cyprus, Mexico City and 
Cairo by age of 10.
  He was a straight A student and considered becoming
a cartoonist for a living but instead became a busker 
outside London's Green Park station. 
  He played in bands Vultures, the 101ers, and London SS
before forming The Clash in 1976. In 91 he became lead 
singer of The Pogues for a year after Shane MacGowan left. 
  Most of this was done under the name Joe Strummer.
  Joe had a heart attack last week in his home and died.
  I still haven't decided if "London Calling" was my 
all-time favorite Clash song. I'll have to get back to 
you on that. But I loved all of the songs Joe ever did
that I was aware of.

[In honor of Joe I'm sitting in a coffeeshop with
no instrument in front of me except a notebook, and
drawing out a TAB. I think I'll build you a short
instrumental song right here.]

OVERHEARD IN A PUN FACTORY

A physicist who doesn't celebrate Christmas
was at a parallel ceremony minding his own
business, when he stumbled on a phenomenon.
Well a couple phenomena really. Things just
happened which just weren't very explainable
in terms that would be easily understood. So
he quickly set out to author himself a book.

The title?
