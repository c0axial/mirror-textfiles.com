Hi there,
I'm the prime anarchist, it's saturday nite, 10:33 pm
and I'm ready to rant.
  Do you know anyone owning a black Canondale who's not a 
bicycle cop?
  Many years ago, retired general Smedley Butler said he 
operated in three continents, and then he slammed Al Capone 
saying Al only did three Chicago districts. Yikes.
  October first, last year Gore Vidal told Book TV "7.1
trillion dollars gone for war since 1949. We have had no
enemy that we didn't trump up. Double yikes. I don't even
WANT to tell you what former FBI agent William Webster
(1951-1961) told CSpan2 on 7/1 about his non-lustrius career. 
  Cover your ears, I'm going to scream.
  KNOWING THAT JENNA BUSH DID HER COLLEGE INTERNSHIP AT 
BRILLSTEIN-GREY MAKES ME WANT TO VOMIT NEEDLES OUT OF EVERY
HOLE I'VE GOT.
  UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE: All U.S. hamsters will work four (4)
hours a day on the treadmill generating electricity for the 
U.S. Government before making any for the room, house or 
neighborhood.
  At least until the next war is over.
  Or the next one.
  Please don't take this the wrong way, Osima Bin Laden is
a very beautiful looking man. He reminds me of Cat Stevens.
I have a question. What if ten years from now we find out
that although Bin Laden smiled looking at footage of three
buildings plummetting in NYC and someone taking a bite out
of the Pentagram, he truly did have nothing to do with it?
What if we kill off every single person who looks like
someone who might have done this, and right after that we
lose some other religious icons like the Sears Tower or
Six Flags over Georgia, or Disneyland?
  Does anyone remember the Zodiac killer? I think that was
the mass murderer I'm remembering here. I don't want to 
libel the guy - it may be a different mass murderer I'm
recalling. Gainesville Florida I think. Someone killed like 
2 people a week for a couple years, and suddenly the Florida 
branch of the FBI brings in some guy at a bus-stop and they
ask for the death penalty as his highest potential sentencing, 
and a trial begins. 
  Suddenly the real mass murderer couldn't help himself, he
killed again. Mutilated, etc., whatever else was his trademark.
I'm hard pressed to remember if they apologized to the guy
they'd dragged into a deathpenalty case when they released him 
maybe a week before he was going to be strapped to an electric 
chair and doused with salt-water so he'd conduct enough to 
die instead of suffer.
  I think they eventually found the guy and killed him off
and put a stop to his "terror," but that's not the analogy
I want to draw here. What if he was smart enough or restrained
enough to wait it out? What if Florida killed the mistaken
mark, and the whole society managed to give themselves the
good vibrations they were looking for in the first place.
Yes. The vibrations they were hoping would replace real true 
justice. The kind of feel-good vibrations we're after now
as we collectively rob more billions of dollars from our
old people and our young people so our middle people can all
wear battle dress uniforms and black berets and feel elite
about shipping out looking for the boogieman.
  What if Pakistan or Russia or Iran or Jamaica captures
Osama Bin Laden, we strap him up to a gurney, kill him in
front of Truman Capote, Dan Rather and Jerry Falwell and
we all take turns saying how great it makes us feel?
  What if the real perpetrator waits just one extra 
cross-burning until that feel-good day is over before
lashing out again. What if the real perpetrator is Christian?
What if he's got grand children of his own? What if s/he's
a millionaire or a hundred thousandaire?? What if s/he's
a mayor, a county sherrif or a Sunday School teacher?
  What if he's me?
  I say that lightly because I know it is not. But I want
to bring up a serious point here. These past two weeks I
have the distinct feeling I'm undergoing the least doses
of surveillance I've suffered since well before issue 130 of
this 'zine. Because organizations are looking for some
muslim-amerikan-looking guy, whereas I look like some 
jewish-amerikan guy, or swedish-amerikan guy instead. And
it gives me no certain comfort because I want either 
every U.S. Citizen to be a suspect, or NOT A SINGLE U.S.
CITIZEN to be a suspect. This racial profiling in the name
of justice, roving phone taps "because it's an emergency,"
 overturning Ford's anti-assassination bill, "because it's
the least we could do," etc., has got to be reeled in. It
is NOT something you just close a case on and never use
again. We will NOT survive it. Not with all our arms and 
legs. Fingers and toes, teeth. Can anyone else besides me 
make these historical parallels?? Do I have to be half jewish
to beg the comparison with the Reichstag burning rather
than puny little unilaterally significant Pearl Harbor???
We're going to sick the FBI on "him???" Whoever he is? 
Yeah, he's shaking in his boots! He's probably taking odds
for which innocents will die while he just cheers from the
sidelines. Hell, he's probably calling the Feds every day
or so, or meeting them in a parking garage saying things
like, "check out Sweeney, he's labor," or "check out the
Japanese Red Guard," or "look at Al Gore this week, I 
told you he was growing a beard."
  There's my analogy. We're entrusting the FBI and the
CIA, the NSA and the DIC (defense industrial complex)
to properly pull this off???
  Are we frigging daft?
  Where are we going, people? I'm afraid this will have been
the slimiest slipperiest slope we've ever sunk down along in 
our short history as a nation-state. All three witch-hunts before 
this are likely to pale in comparison to the repression we're 
unleashing this week as we go looking for the "terrorist(s) who 
master minded this." 
  What if we find out we voted against them last november and 
they "won" anyway?

LETTUCE -

 We'll start with something slightly 
 political but somewhat spammish:

 Anyone need to know exactly what human being wrote 
 pResident Bush's "State Of The Terrorism" address?

 This kind of stuff keeps showing up in my inbox and 
 I usually just read it quickly and delete it; but 
 this time I looked and it was quite telling.

Over the past week and a half, we have all seen, heard and felt 
the true spirit of America and Americans.
  While as a nation we mourn the tragic loss of so many innocent 
lives, our character and resolve has not been broken.
   In his speech to a Joint Session of Congress last night, 
President Bush said, "We are a country awakened to danger and 
called to defend freedom." And - as a nation - we will rise to 
the challenge. We will not live in terror.  We will stand united 
by the strongest and deepest of ties - that of being an American. 
With a singleness of purpose, we will persevere.
Sincerely,
Governor Jim Gilmore
Chairman, Republican National Committee

Hola como estas ?
Te mando este archivo para que me des tu punto de vista
Nos vemos pronto, gracias.

  I'm fine, thanks for asking. Everyone I know is fine, 
although that is a relative term these days in this city. 
I'm sorry it took me so long  to get back to you. My email 
still doesn't work quite right, and even if it had been 
working, I haven't really been able to write anything  
until now. What can you say?
  It's very very very strange here in New York. That's 
about all I can think to say. The first four or five days, 
we were all kind of numb, in  shock (people say that all the 
time, but now I know what it means). You operate on pure 
instinct, find your people, the people you love, and  
make sure they're OK, then you try to think about all 
the hows and whys and what-ifs.
  Now, a week later, everyone is becoming more emotional. 
You'll be in the middle of a conversation, and both of you 
will just start crying.  This is happening all over the city.
XOXOXO
Tia (212)

Dineh Activist's Perspective About "Pearl Harbor" In Manhattan 

On August 17th 2001, I was getting ready to take the sheep out at 5 AM,
and I was just having a cup of coffee and absorbing the beautiful
brightness of day just beginning. I heard, in the fresh, cool moisten
air of the Dinnebito Wash basin, the loud rumbling and clabbering of
steel coming up the main dirt road. It was not the early school bus that
normal makes its way up this dirt road which makes its pick up for Rocky
Ridge School students. Finally, this rumbling sound approached over the hill, 
and it turned to a roar as I notice BIA cop cars, Ranger vehicles, horse 
trailers, and a flatbed hauling a heavy equipment. I knew this was evil and 
it was an attack. It was an attack as it was confirmed, later, when I brought 
back the sheep in as the day got hot. These Agents of: the US Justice
Department, the Answers to Energy Needs and Corporate Profits, and the
Interior Department's BIA had just carried out a 'well orchestrated
terrorist' attack on the nerve center of the Sacred Hoop of the Red
Nations. An Elder Dineh Sun Dancers said, "What has been done to this Sacred
Cotton Wood Tree was completely wrong. Such a crime is very likely to go
unpunished. The Great Spirit has seen this crime committed against many
peoples prayers, and the flesh offerings of many have been grinded to
bits. This has been certainly the most serious crime ever committed
against Our People who only wish to stay on their land and maintain a
ceremonial place. It has been a forbidden thing (they) did, and sooner
or later it will come to reality that (they) have done this to
themselves." 
The Trade Center Towers and The Pentagon, September 11, 2001 Just as 
they have sent out their agents into the small and poor community of 
Black Mesa to sever a Sacred Pole and to plow into the circled prayer 
lodges, THEIR globalization towers and THEIR lodges of human-destruction 
has seen its consequences. The Dineh Resistors have been labeled terrorist. 
I feel a real terrorist has the technological capabilities to initiate 
aggression or death upon a peaceful, humanistic culture. A terrorist 
doesn't sleep in the dusty earth in a sleep bag or go hungry. A real 
terrorist doesn't believe in a spiritual creation, a spiritual center 
and a Spiritual Law. Would have this been the consequences of a 
desecration at Big Mountain?
Peabody Western Coal Company's "time of decay will come." My last name 
is Keediniihii. Its a name which came about in the late 1860s when Kit 
Carson was massacring our ancestors around Big Mountain and Blue Canyon. 
In the last 27 years I stood with my people to defy the US Colonial 
aggression, and I've seen many of my people perish to unthinkable 
depression and suicides. Today, I am a landless Dineh and I long for 
my playgrounds, places where I watered the herds, places where I hunted 
and camp out, and places where my parents told me of their childhood. 
Yes, I will always live with deep anger and sadness. I don't condone 
the so-called terrorist attack on Amerika because my country, Big Mountain, 
has always been under attack by the federal government and their Indian 
Agents. 
AHO! 
Thank you, Tunkasula, for allowing me to, at least for one day, see
You clearly. This might be the only time in my life to see Father Sky
without endless, commercial jetliners and the Peabody cargo plane.
