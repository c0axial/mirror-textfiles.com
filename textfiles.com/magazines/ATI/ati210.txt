Prime Anarchist here, with your E-Disney Whirrled Millienius
Super-E-Bowl Y-who-K coverage.

   One full year of Edward James Olmos and Christina Aguilera's
Cher-like synclaviered voice? Did I hear right? Or was that more
like a full year of Walt Chizzly World pageantry, while Olmos and
Aguilera speak on its behalf for 5 minutes tonite.
   Enrique Iglesias. Bringing the lip sync to a whole new height.
Or was that low't?
  A cantata for the birth/death/age-coming of lucifer, let me say!
Let's celebrate with a cross between ballet and JarJar Banks leading
an army of colorful costumes through a regimented nightmare like no
other. "War rehersal" is the only way I can describe this moment!
  Paving the way for the king of fraud himself. Not a Pheonix,
no - a genesis if you will. Beating the drum for a tyrannical
high-tech splendorifically orchestrated sound-orgy, movement
and much pagentry. A parade on a giant stage. The man behind
the curtain comes out - Feck! it's Phil. Gee, Phil. Collins
We bring death to life for good. No, GE! I'll pretend to believe
in all this for the forum. Music? Drama? Don't get me started.
   Ask my opinion it's one big phallic mind-meld.

   & Now a Quick Suspension Of Disbelief:
   If the Dalai Lama put on a HUMONGOUS
   EVENT in Peru it might be the Dilly
   at Lima.

   But dad! I don't WANNA do plastic. I know Uncle Fester believes
in it, but after I graduate I want something real. I wanna dance.
I must dance. Gracefully, dad. I wanna dance like Barishnikof. Make
hundreds of little groupiebabies on every continent in the world.
Drive around in a Ferari. Buy hundred dollar bottles of port. Bright
lights big whoop-ti-do, it's Michael J.A.B.C. for Tupperware. Or was
that Fox? It's Fox Tupperware for E-Disney. Go. Go. Go! Oh noooooo!
  Spin this, Michael!
  OK. Touchy question - who's the token black female vocalist?
Go Disn-e, go Disn-e. "Toni Braxton," she whispers my way. Toni?
She looked terrified, but she wore it well. I guess I gotta get
back into R&B for a while - I been out of it. Didn't even know it
was her. Where's Tyson and his prime rib?
   She really held promise for singing despite teleprompters, ear-
phones, lip sync, masking tape, smoke and mirrors.
  And you know what I got a sense of? Singing. She heard actual
music somewhere. I could feel it. She actually HEARD music. Presented
it to us. Wow. OK, she's no Dar Williams, but still. A voice. Let her
rant. She's onto it. God knows Christina and Riki weren't listening to
each OTHER  a' tall!!! Enrique was busily staring at an unbeknownst
barely legal's breasts; and she? She had that look on her whole face
of "Oh. My. God. A hunk. I'm. Gonna. Faint." If she flits her eyes one
more time:

  I ' M   gonna pass out.

  Mountain Dew, the queen of soft drinks. Scara DEW'ch, Scara
DEW'ch can you do the Dew Dew do. KForce.com for your temporary
full-time needs. Got benefits? We're NOT Kelly Girl! Day labor
meets the world wide web. Information super Buy way.
  I know, let's move the Bears to Alabama and the Patriots to New
Mexico and then next year they can SuperBowl each other after going
through the motions. Oh, and who sang the War-Strangled-Phantom?
  Oh and how much is a minute this year? Did it climb up over
$2M like I predicted??
   Awww, lookie. A new horse for a new beer for a new Superbowl for
a new Millenium. Yup. Justin Morgan had a copyright infringement.

  Sorry Christina - hate 2 break it 2 ya. High E above C is NOT the
note that changed your life.
  Wehh! Wehh! Wrong answer. The note what changed YOUR life was more
like a whole stack of 50's - one each in the palms of our hands.
Nope. Nu uh. Payola didn't die, it just started outreach in
kiddyporn land. Walt Disney World.

Did somebody say "real ad?" I almost believe there IS a God.
It's just that he ain't makin' it in day trading. He's herding
felines from Texas to Chicago along the old folk trail.
Wow. What a concept.

    Cost of 30 seconds at the superbowl. $1.6 million
    5 minutes of fame at halftime? Selling your soul
    Packer Season Tickets? Somebody's gotta die.
    Cher standing or falling on her own without

Hey, who put the supersize colander on the football field.

Would you happen to have her e-mail address?
Thanks!

\\\a prose poem for you\\\
   \\\  BY    Chad F. \\\

If I Could Rip Out a Lung and Stick It On This Page, I Would
8/8/99
(There is a horrible smell in the bus that keeps building on itself).
I am going to northern Serbia to watch a total eclipse. The passenger
bus is driving over a bridge that was bombed, one that spans the Danube.
It must be a half-mile long. The bridge was temporarily patched a couple
of weeks ago.  Milosevic launched his reconstruction campaign from
here.  Two young inductees in fatigues look out the window and say
"jabote bog," roughly translated, "fuck god."  I may remember seeing
this bridge with a hellish orange halo (oh, the dialectics of bombing)
while I stood in front of my television watching CNN broadcast the
Serbian television images. The two television insignias, A?9?G37 and
CNN, were in opposite corners of the screen. I never thought steel and
concrete could hold a flame. Dorijan told me in Belgrade at first they
went to the basement, but after a couple of weeks his family would stand
on the balcony and watch the fireworks of anti-aircraft guns and bombs
battle it out in silver and green scribbles across the sky, drinking
beer and cheering.  Out my window we are gaining on a pick-up truck
hauling the corpse of a busted up decapitated bull with three legs. I
think he is going to be burned.  I want to see the burning, a brilliant,
biting lemon yellow eating the oxygen out of empty night. This leftover
war is eating placentas; I know three women who have miscarried since
July.  In the aura of this scene everything's silent as the perfect
corpse of the dead dog on the sidewalk down Knez Milos, lying like an
abandoned dirty piñata that nobody could break. And we're almost over
the bridge now   (I called over a field in the morning to your blanket
dream).


FOR IMMEDIATE GONZO RELEASE:
Hey all,
January has been an exceedingly lousy month for me for so
many reasons, one of which is that I haven't been able to
update the tekknowledge site and no word back from them in
a week, so I'll have to make a dreaded long distance call.
 However, I'm cleaning up the ralph directory on the mirror,
which is going to be host to http://www.gonzo.org Yup, I
bought the domain :-) now I'm trying to org-a-fy and update
all the pages. The ralph folder has been somewhat neglected,
and all the pages and pix that were unlinked from anywhere
will be available to see! You might be surprised at how I
kind of let the whole section after a bit *g* but it's good
to get these things done once and never have to do them again

   got a very nice looking write up in Yahoo

Xerox Shooting Suspect Fitted for Trial
HONOLULU (APWN) -- A copier repairman accused of killing seven
of his Xerox Corp. co-workers last November is psyched to stand
trial, a state judge ruled Wednesday.
    Both prosecutors and defense attorneys finally agreed that
40-year-old Byran Uyesugi will be allowed to have hair by
Peter Frampton, and "body" by Tommy Hilfiger proceeding toward
a May 15 trial date. Paul Mitchell expressed his displeasure.
   Both sides argued that wearing a long orange or blue jumpsuit
could easily prejudice Uyesugi's right to a fair trial.
   "Oh, that would just look totally disgusting," said Frampton
in his Venice Beach studio. "How can you have a good hair day in
orange, I ask you, I mean totally."
   Uyesugi has pleaded innocent to murder charges in the Nov. 2
shootings. He is being held without gel.

          Code of Ethics?

    I think it's time our journalists
    Should publicly confess
    That they betray the standards
    They so piously profess.

    "News" is everything, they say,
    The public should be told,
    But news of greatest consequence
    These hypocrites withhold.

    I can see no reason why
    This crowd should be exempt
    From censure when their deeds
    Are truly worthy of contempt.

Marc,
This is a fungus that grows on corn similar to what we called... back on
the farm in Ohio. It's aztec (nahuatl) name is cuitlacoche or <B>huitlacoche</B>.
I almost hesitate to translate but cuitlatlcochtli  (....decipherable...)
Don't let that stop you from trying it.
It is almost considered a delicacy and I have even seen it referred to in
French cooking and it is served in some upscale restaurants in Texas.
Hongos or champiñones are the standard translation of &quot;mushrooms&quot;
but for the corn mushrooms the term &quot;<B>huitlacoche</B>&quot; is
generally used in Mexico and Texas.
I did not know that it was available in a can and I never knew it was
being canned and sold stateside as corn mushrooms. 
AL PASTOR means shepherd style.  &quot;Cabrito al pastor&quot;
is a very popular and traditional dish in Northeast Mexico and
Southern Texas where I have lived for past 47 years. Cabrito is
a kid goat, still a suckling. The butchered cabrito is impaled
on a metal rod and placed over hot coals. Generally these are only
available in restaurants that specialize in cabrito but are beginning
to be available at some fairly fancy restaurants.  
¡Ya se me hizo agua la boca!
