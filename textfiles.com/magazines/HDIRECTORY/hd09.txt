MESSAGE SERVICES:

       INFORMATION SERVICES ANNOUNCES IT PLANS TO EXPAND TWO MESSAGE SERVICES
PRODUCTS STARTING JUNE 4 IN NORTHWESTERN BELL'S REGIONAL STATES.

SELECTIVE CLASS OF CALL SCREENING, IS A BELL PRODUCT BEING OFFERED TO BUSINESS
CUSTOMERS.  THIS SERVICE PRNÆIDES THE ABILTIY TO RESTRICT CERTAIN TYPES OF
OPERATOR HANDLED CALLS PLACED FROM THEIR PHONES.
BILLED NUMBER SCREENING, IS AVAILABLE, BUT NOT OFFERED.  FORMED IS A PRODUCT
TEAM: THUS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT IS UNDERWAY.  PRODUCT FEATURES ALLOW USERS
TO PROHIBIT CERTAIN OPERATOR HANDLED CALLS FROM BEING TO TO THEIR PHONES.  I
KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT DO THIS, BUT I SEE THEY WILL HAVE A MUCH TOUGHER
TIME GETTING AWAY WITH IT.

INFORMATION SERVICES' OBJECTIVE HAS BEEN TO EXPAND CUSTOMER BASE AND PROVIDE
ADDITIONAL REVENUE TO LINE OF BUSINESS AND BELL.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
U.S. WEST INFORMATION SYSTEMS SELLS PBX TO GSA:

       U.S. WEST INFOSYSTEMS INC. HAS SOLD AND INTECOM INC. INTEGRATED
BUSINESS EXCHANGE (IBX) S/80 VOICE DATA PBX TO THE U.S. GENERAL SERVICES
ADMINISTRATION.  THE 8,500 LINE SWITHC WILL BE INSTALLED IN THE GSA'S NEW
670,000--SQUARE-FOOT BUILDING IN PORTLAND, ORE., AND THTE U.S.WEST COMPANY
WILL INSTALL, SUPPORT AND MAINTAIN THE SWITCH.  CUTOVER IS SCHEDULED FOR
JULY '86, ACCORDING TO THE BELL.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FCC RESTRICTS MINOR ACCESS TO DIAL-A-PORN:

       THE FCC PASSES NEW REGULATIONS THAT WILL RESTRICT ACCESS BY MINORS TO
DIAL-A-PORN SERVICES.  UNDER THE RULES, USERS OF THE DIAL-A-PORN RECORDED
MESSAGES MUST ARRANGE FOR SPECIAL ACCESS CODES OR MAKE PAYMENT FOR THE CALLS
BY CREDIT CARD.  ACCESS CODES WILL BE ISSUED BY PROVIDERS OF THE SERVICES
AFTER PROOF OF AGE BY APPLICANTS.  NO REAL LOSS.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GALLUP POLL REPORTS MA BELL ISN'T MISSED:

       A NEW GALLUP POLL REPORTS 84 PERCENT OF CONSUMERS SAY LOCAL PHONE
SERVICE IS EQUAL TO OR BETTER THAN TWO YEARS AGO.  ONLY 14 PERCENT SAY IT
IS WORSE, IN A SURVEY CONDUCTED FOR THE U.S.TELEPHONE ASSOCIATION.  BUT THE
RESPONDENTS HAVE MIXED OPINIONS OF LOCAL PHONE COMPANIES SINCE DIVESTITURE.
THERE ARE 46 PERCENT WHO HAVE A LESS FAVORABLE ATTITUDE AND 47 PERCENT WHO
IT'S THE SAME OR BETTER.

       THESE POLLS SHOULD BE GIVEN TO REGULAR USERS OF THE TELEPHONE.  I KNOW
I COULD GIVE THEM A FEW HARSH STORIES ABOUT THEIR BETTER PHONE SYSTEM.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AT&T PROPOSES LONG-DISTANCE RATE DECREASE:

       AT&T PROPOSED STEEP RATE CUTS ON ITS LD SERVICE THAT WILL MOSTLY
BENEFIT BUSINESS USERS AND WILL INCREASE PRESSURE ON SMALLER LD COMPETITORS.
AT&T SAID IT PROPOSED TO THE FCC RATE CUTS AMOUNTING TO MORE THAN 1.5 BILLION
A YEAR.  THE STEEPEST CUT WOULD BE CALLING DURING THE DAY AND EVENING HOURS,
WHEN BUSINESSES MAKE AN ESTIMATE 90% OF THEIR CALLS AND RESIDENTS MAKE ABOUT
TWO-THIRDS OF THEIR CALLS.  AT&T SAID REGULAR LD RATES (AS WILL AS RATES FOR
WATS AND 800 SERVICES) WOULD BE CUT...AT&T SAID IT WAS PASSING ALONG RECENT
LARGER-THEN-EXPECTED RATE CUTS BY THE LOCAL TELEPHONE COMPANIES.
