COMPUTER FRAUD LAW
------------------

This was typed in the day it was released, this is very serious and pertains
to all Hackers and Phreaks.  Taken from The New York Times, Wensday, June 4th.


        HOUSE APPROVES MEASURE TO MAKE COMPUTER FRAUD A FEDERAL CRIME

WASHINGTON, June 3 - Heeding warnings that computer crime "will be the crime
wave of the next decade," the House of Representatives today passed a bill
making the use of computers for some cases of fraud or theft a Federal felony.
  The measure covers the use of a computer in another state or one owned by
the Federal Government, a bank or a securities dealer, even in the same stae.
  The bill also makes it a crime to break into any of those computers and
cause "malicious damage," such as destroying programs or altering passwords
to make the computer unavailable to its legitimate users.
  The bill, sponsored by Representative William J. Hughes, a New Jersey
Democrat, was approved unanimously by voice vote.  The bill is expected to pass
the Senate, where it is sponsored by Senators Paul Laxalto of Nevada and Paul
S. Trible of Virginia, both Republicans.  The Administration also supports
the bill.
  A majority of states now have their own computer crime laws.  The Federal
bill, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986, is intended to supplement state
efforts to prosecute crimes that occur across state lines, for example, are
often hampered by complicated extradition procedures.

                  Legislation pending in Albany (Capital of NY)

  New York has no computer crime laws, but agreement was reached in Albany
last month on broad legislation that is expected to be enacted within the
next few months.
  The House bill is part of a broad, bipartisan effort to deal with new
technology and its implications for crime, personal privacy, and national
security.
  A computer crime bill that became law last year made it a felony to make
unauthorized use of a computer to obtain classified information that might
harm the national intrest.  That law also made it a misdemeanor to make
unauthorized use of a computer to obtain financial or credit records
protected by privacy laws.
  Mr. Hughes, who heads the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, told
the House today, "Computer techonology has left us with a new breed of
technologically sophisticated criminals."  Their tools, he said, "are no
longer Smith & Wesson, but I.B.M. and Apple."
  "Unless we act now, computer crime will be the crime wave of the next
decade," he said.
  The theft or fraud prohibited by the bill need not be of any particular
dollar amount.  But the theft or fraud must be intentional, and someone must
get something of value, like an undeserved tax refund or a fraudulently
enhanced bank account.  Simply obtaining a password or stored information
does not qualify as "theft."
  But in a separate section, the bill takes a new approach to computer
networks used share information about how to break into computers:  The
bill makes it a misdemeanor to display passwords, which in themselves have
no monetary value on these "pirate bulletin boards" for others to gain
unauthorized entry into Governmnt computers or those used in interstate
or foreign commerce.
  The bill also ammends a provision of the computer crime law passed last
year that drew criticism from the American Civil Liberties Union and newspaper
groups.
  The 1985 law made it a crime for Government employees to disclose information
contained in a Federal computer without offical authorization to do so.
Although the intent was to protect the privacy of computerized records,
critics said the law could be used to punish whistle-blowers for disclosing
unclassified but embarrassing information about their agencies.
  The bill passed today removes from the law's coverage Federal employees who
are unauthorized to use Federal computers.


Ok, there it is, bills which relate to BBSs should be passed soon, and I
am afraid that they won't be very favorable.  Probably something which
holds Sysops responsible for "illegal"(haha, I guess the 1st amendment doesn't
apply to hackers) messages on their system.  Or possibly something which
allows feds to bust a board on like zero evidence.  <SIGH>
