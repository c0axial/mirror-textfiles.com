HOW TO BE A PHREAK

IN THE PHONE PHREAK SOCIETY THERE ARE CERTAIN VALUES THAT EXIST IN ORDER TO
BE A TRUE PHREAK, THESE ARE BEST SUMMED UP BY LOGAN-5 "MANY PEOPLE THINK OF
PHONE PHREAKS AS SLIME, OUT TO RIP OFF BELL FOR ALL SHE IS WORTH. 
NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH!  GRANTED, THERE ARE SOME WHO GET
THEIR KICKS BY MAKING FREE CALLS; HOWEVER, THEY ARE NOT TRUE PHONE PHREAKS.
REAL PHONE PHREAKS ARE 'TELECOMMUNICATIONS HOBBYISTS' WHO EXPERIMENT,
PLAY WITH AND LEARN FROM THE PHONE SYSTEM.  OCCASIONALY THIS EXPERIMENTING,
AND A NEED TO COMMUNICATE WITH OTHER PHREAKS ( WITHOUT GOING BROKE), LEADS TO
FREE CALLS. THE FREE CALLS ARE BUT A SMALL SUBSET OF A >TRUE< PHONE PHREAKS
ACTIVITIES.

-----
THE TEN COMMANDMENTS

REPRINTED FROM TAP ISSUE #86.
 

  THE PHONE PHREAK'S TEN COMMANDMENTS
 
   I.  BOX THOU NOT OVER THINE HOME TELEPHONE WIRES, FOR THOSE  WHO
       DOEST MUST SURELY BRING THE WRATH OF THE CHIEF SPECIAL 
       AGENT DOWN UPON THY HEADS.
 
  II.  SPEAKEST THOU NOT OF IMPORTANT MATTERS OVER THINE HOME TELEPHONE
       WIRES, FOR TO DO SO IS TO RISK THINE RIGHT OF FREEDOM.
 
 III.  USE NOT THINE OWN NAME WHEN SPEAKING TO OTHER PHREAKS, FOR
       THAT EVERY THIRD PHREAK IS AN FBI AGENT IS WELL KNOWN.
 
  IV.  LET NOT OVERLY MANY PEOPLE KNOW THAT THY BE A PHREAK, AS TO DO 
       SO IS TO USE THINE OWN SELF AS A SACRIFICIAL LAMB.
 
   V.  IF THOU BE IN SCHOOL, STRIVE TO GET THINE SELF GOOD GRADES, FOR
       THE AUTHORITIES WELL KNOW THAT SCHOLARS NEVER BREAK THE LAW.
 
  VI.  IF THOU WORKEST, TRY TO BE A EMPLOYEE, AND IMPRESSEST THINE
       BOSS WITH THINE ENTHUSIASM, FOR IMPORTANT EMPLOYEES ARE OFTEN
       SAVED BY THEIR OWN BOSSES.
 
 VII.  STOREST THOU NOT THINE STOLEN GOODES IN THINE OWN HOME, FOR
       THOSE WHO DO ARE SURELY NON-BELIEVERS IN THE BELL SYSTEM
       SECURITY FORCES, AND ARE NOT  LONG FOR THIS WORLD.
 
VIII.  ATTRACTEST THOU NOT THE ATTENTION OF THE AUTHORITIES, AS 
       THE LESS NOTICABLE THOU ART, THE BETTER.
 
  IX.  MAKEST SURE THINE FRIENDS ARE INSTANT AMNESIACS AND WILL NOT
       REMEMBER THAT THOU HAVE CALLED ILLEGALLY, FOR THEIR COOPERATION
       WITH THE AUTHORITIES WILL SURELY LESSEN THINE TIME FOR FREEDOM ON
       THIS EARTH.
 
   X.  SUPPORTEST THOU TAP, AS IT IS  THINE NEWSLETTER, AND WITHOUT 
       IT, THY WORK WILL BE FAR MORE LIMITED.

CN/A NUMBERS

CUSTOMER NAME & ADDRESS BUREAUS EXIST SO THAT AUTHORIZED BELL EMPLOYEES MAY
OBTAIN THE NAME & ADDRESS OF ANY CUSTOMER IN THE BELL SYSTEM BY GIVING
THE CN/A OPERATOR THE CUSTOMER'S TEL.# ALL CUSTOMERS ARE MAINTAINED ON FILE
INCLUDING UNLISTED #'S.  THESE BUREAUS HAVE MANY USES FOR PHREAKS.
 
HERE IS HOW AN EMPLOYEE MIGHT GO ABOUT CALLING CN/A:

 "HI, THIS IS JOHN DOE FROM THE MIAMI RESIDENTAL SERVICE CENTER, CAN I HAVE
 THE CUSTOMERS NAME AT (123) 555-1212." THE EMPLOYEES USUALLY USE THESE FOR
 CHECKING WHO BELONGS TO A # THAT SOMEONE CLAIMED THEY DIDN'T CALL.
 
 IF YOU SOUND CHEERY AND NATURAL THE OPERATOR WILL NEVER ASK ANY QUESTIONS.
 IF YOU DON'T SOUND LIKE A MATURE ADULT, DON'T USE IT!  ALWAYS PRACTICE FIRST &  SO YOU DON'T SCREW UP AND MAKE THE OPERATOR SUSPICIOUS.  USE 
 NAME THAT SOUNDS REAL, NOT YOUR PIRATE NAME EITHER!  ALSO SAY THAT YOU ARE FRO
 A CITY THAT IS FAR AWAY FROM THE ONE THAT YOU ARE CALLING.
 
THE CN/A NUMBER FOR THE NY AREA VICINITY (212, 315, 516, 518, 607, 716,
& 914) IS (518) 471-8111 AND IS OPEN DURING BUSINESS HOURS. DON'T ABUSE IT!
 
-----
AT&T NEWSLINES

AT&T NEWSLINES ARE NUMBERS AT AREA PHONE OFFICES THAT TELCO EMPLOYEES CALL
TO FIND OUT THE LATEST INFO ON NEW TECHNOLOGY, STOCKS, ETC.  THE RECORDED
REPORTS RANGE FROM VERY BORING TO VERY INTERESTING.

HERE ARE A FEW OF THE NUMBERS:
 *(201) 483-3800 NJ  (518) 471-2272 NY
  (203) 771-4920 CN  (717) 255-5555 PA
  (212) 393-2151 NY  (717) 787-1031 PA
  (516) 234-9941 NY *(914) 948-8100 NY
 
SOME OF THESE NUMBERS ARE TOLL-FREE, BUT YOU CAN'T ALWAYS COUNT ON IT.
 
* THESE NUMBERS ARE NOT ALWAYS UP!

-----
ANI NUMBERS

ANI NUMBERS IDENTIFY THE PHONE NUMBER THAT YOU ARE CALLING FROM.  IT IS 
USEFUL WHEN PLAYING IN CANS (THOSE BIG SILVER BOXES ON TELEPHONE POLES)
TO FIND OUT THE # OF THE LINE.IT IS ALSO GOOD TO FIND OUT THE # OF A PHONE
THAT DOESN'T HAVE IT PRINTED ON IT.  IN THE 914 AREA CODE THE ANI # IS 990. IF
YOU JUST HAVE TO DIAL THE LAST 4 DIGITS FOR A LOCAL #, IE CONGERS (268), DIAL
1-990-1111, WHERE 1111 .

-----
DIAL LOCKS

HAVE YOU EVER BEEN IN AN OFFICE OR SOMEWHERE AND WANTED TO MAKE A FREE
FONE CALL BUT SOME ASSHOLE PUT A LOCK ON THE FONE TO PREVENT OUT-GOING CALLS?
 
FRET NO MORE PHELLOW PHREAKS, FOR EVERY SYSTEM CAN BE BEATEN WITH A LITTLE 
KNOWLEDGE!
 
THERE ARE TWO WAYS TO BEAT THIS  OBSTACLE, FIRST PICK THE LOCK, I DON'T 
HAVE THE TIME TO TEACH LOCKSMITHING SO WE GO TO THE SECOND METHOD WHICH TAKES
ADVANTAGE OF TELEPHONE ELECTRONICS.
 
TO BE AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE, WHEN YOU  PICK UP THE FONE YOU COMPLETE A CIRCUIT
KNOW AS A LOCAL LOOP.  WHEN YOU HANG-UP YOU BREAK THE CIRCUIT.WHEN YOU DIAL
(PULSE) IT ALSO BREAKS THE CIRCUT BUT NOT LONG ENOUGH TO HANG UP!  SO YOU CAN
"PUSH-DIAL."  TO DO THIS YOU >RAPIDLY< DEPRESS THE SWITCHHOOK.  FOR EXAMPLE, 
TO DIAL AN OPERATOR (AND THEN GIVE HER THE NUMBER YOU WANT CALLED) >RAPIDLY<
& >EVENLY< DEPRESS THE SWITCHHOOK 10 TIMES.TO DIAL 634-1268, DEPRESS 6 X'S
PAUSE, THEN 3 X'S, PAUSE, THEN 4 X'S, ETC.  IT TAKES A LITTLE PRACTICE BUT 
YOU'LL GET THE HANG OF IT.  TRY PRACTICING WITH YOUR OWN # SO YOU'LL 
GET A BUSY TONE WHEN RIGHT.  IT'LL ALSO WORK ON TOUCH-TONE(TM) SINCE A DTMF 
LINE WILL ALSO ACCEPT PULSE.  ALSO, NEVER DEPRESS THE SWITCHHOOK FOR MORE
THAN A SECOND OR IT'LL HANG-UP!
 
FINALLY, REMEMBER THAT YOU HAVE JUST AS MUCH RIGHT TO THAT FONE AS THE ASSHOLE
WHO PUT THE LOCK ON IT!
 
-----
EXCHANGE SCANNING

ALMOST EVERY EXCHANGE IN THE BELL SYSTEM HAS TEST #'S AND OTHER "GOODIES"
SUCH AS LOOPS WITH DIAL-UPS.
 
THESE "GOODIES" ARE USUALLY FOUND BETWEEN 9900 AND 9999 IN YOUR LOCAL
EXCHANGE.  IF YOU HAVE THE TIME AND INITIATIVE, SCAN YOUR EXCHANGE AND YOU
MAY BECOME LUCKY!
 
HERE ARE MY FINDINGS IN THE 914-268 EXCHANGE:
 
 
9900 - ANI (SEE SEPARATE BULLETIN)
9901 - ANI (SEE SEPARATE BULLETIN)
9927 - OSC. TONE (POSSIBLE TONE SIDE OF A LOOP)
9936 - VOICE # TO THE TELCO CENTRAL OFFICE
9937 - VOICE # TO THE TELCO CENTRAL OFFICE
9941 - COMPUTER (DIGITAL VOICE TRANSMISSION?)
9960 - OSC. TONE (TONE SIDE LOOP) - MAY ALSO BE A COMPUTER IN SOME EXCHANGES
9961 - NO RESPONSE (OTHER END OF LOOP?)
9962 - NO RESPONSE (OTHER END OF LOOP?)
9963 - NO RESPONSE (OTHER END OF LOOP?)
9966 - COMPUTER (SEE 9941)
9968 - TONE THAT DISAPPEARS--RESPONDS TO CERTAIN TOUCH-TONE KEYS
 
MOST OF THE NUMBERS BETWEEN 9900 & 9999 WILL RING OR GO TO A "WHAT #, PLEASE?"
OPERATOR.
 
HAVE PHUN AND REMEMBER IT'S ONLY A LOCAL CALL!
 
-----
TOUCH-TONE & FREE CALLS

THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS TO MAKE FREE CALLS (SPRINT, MCI, ETC.) USING A
ROTARY PHONE.  THEY ARE:
 
 1. USE A NUMBER THAT ACCEPTS VOICE AS WELL AS DTMF.  SUCH A # IS (800)
    521-8400.  AS OF WRITING THIS, A CODE WAS 00717865.
     A) IF USING VOICE, WAIT FOR THE COMPUTER TO SAY, "AUTHORIZATION
        #, PLEASE."  THEN SAY EACH DIGIT SLOWLY, IT WILL BEEP
        AFTER EACH DIGIT IS SAID. AFTER EVERY GROUP OF DIGITS, IT
        WILL REPEAT WHAT YOU HAVE SAID, THEN SAY YES IF IT IS CORRECT,
        OTHERWISE SAY NO.  IF THE ACCESS CODE IS CORRECT, IT WILL
        THANK YOU AND ASK FOR THE DESTINATION #, THEN SAY THE
        AREA CODE + NUMBER AS ABOVE.ANOTHER SUCH # IS (800) 245-
        8173, WHICH HAS A 6 DIGIT ACCESS CODE. (NOTE:  IF USING
        TOUCH-TONE ON THIS #, ENTER THE CODE IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE TONE
        STOPS.)

 2.  HOOK UP A TOUCH-TONE FONE INTO YOUR ROTARY FONE.	ATTACH THE RED
     WIRE FROM THE TOUCH-TONE FONE TO THE "R" TERMINAL INSIDE THE FONE
     ON THE NETWORK BOX.  THEN HOOK THE  GREEN WIRE TO THE "B" TERMINAL.
     TO USE THIS DIAL THE # USING  ROTARY & THEN USE THE TOUCH-TONE
     FOR THE CODES. (DON'T HANG UP THE ROTARY FONE WHILE DOING THIS
     THOUGH!)  IF THIS DOESN'T WORK THEN REVERSE THE 2 WIRES.	(NOTE:
     IF YOUR LINE CAN ACCEPT TOUCH-TONE BUT YOU HAVE A ROTARY FONE THEN
     YOU CAN HOOK UP A TONE FONE DIRECTLY FOR ALL CALLS BUT THIS
     USUALLY ISN'T THE CASE.) SUCH AS RADIO SHACK'S 43-138.
 
-----
OTHER ALTERNATIVES
 
 4.  USE A CHARGE-A-CALL FONE.(THESE ALSO MAKE GREAT EXTENTIONS IF YOU
     REMOVE IT USING A HEX WRENCH WITH A HOLE IN THE MIDDLE ON THE CENTER
     SCREW!)--(THESE FONES FOR THE BENEFIT OF THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW
     ARE BLUE WITH NO COIN SLOTS)
 
 5.  USE A PAY FONE THAT WANTS YOUR MONEY BEFORE THE DIAL TONE.  PUT
     IN YOUR DIME, DIAL THE #; IF IT'S AN 800 # THEN YOUR DIME WILL COME
     BACK, IMMEDIATELY PUT A DIME BACK IN (IT'LL COME BACK WHEN YOU HANG
     UP!)  IF IT IS A TONE FIRST FONE AND IT DISCONNECTS THE KEYPAD
     (SOME DON'T) THEN FIND ANOTHER FONE.

TELCO TRACING

THE GOOD 'OL DAYS:
------------------
 
WAY BACK BEFORE I WAS A PHREAK, MA BEL WOULD HAVE TO MANUALLY TRACE A CALL IF
THEY THOUGH SOMETHING WAS FUCKED UP. FIRST THEY WOULD SEND A 2000 HZ
TRACING TONE, THE WOULD BE FOLLOWED BYE ALOT OF NOISE AND CLICKS.  IT TOOK
ABOUT 2-3 MINUTES TO TRACE A CALL AND ALOT OF PEOPLE WERE INVOLVED IN THE
PROCESS.  SO AT 1 IN THE MORNING THEY WOULD HAVE TO WAKE UP PEOPLE FOT THE
TRACEES (PHREAK JARGON FOR A PAY FONE).  BUT NEVER USE THE SAME ONE MORE
THAN ONCE OR TWICE BECAUSE THE GESTAPO(ER..EXCUSE ME MEAN BELL SECURITY)
HAS BEEN KNOW FOR STAKING OUT TROUBLED FORTRESSES.  IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE FOR
TRAVELNET OR SPRINT TO ASK FOR A TROUBLE # BUT THE TELCO IS SLOW IN PROCESSING
STUFF--ESPECIALLY FOR THE COMPETITION--SO DON'T FRET PHELLOW PHREAKS.
 
-----
MODERN TECHNOLOGY:
------------------
THIS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO ESS + CCIS WHICH CAN BE TRACED IN 1 SECOND.

-----
MISCELLANEOUS STUFF

HERE ARE A FEW BITS OF INFO ON TELEPHONE ELECTRONICS.

--
VOLTAGES:
 
WHEN YOUR FONE IS ON-HOOK (IE-HUNG UP) THERE IS A 48 VOLT DC CURRENT FLOWING
THROUGH THE LINE ( I HAVE A GREAT IDEA ABOUT HOOKING A BATTERY CHARGER UP TO
MY FONE ).  WHEN THE FONE IS OFF-HOOK THE VOLTAGE DROPS DOWN TO AROUND 15VDC.
THE BLACK BOX (SEE SEPARATE ARTICLES) EXPLOITS THIS FOR FREE CALLS SINCE BELL
USES THIS VOLTAGE DROP WHEN THE CALLED PARTY PICKS UP TO START BILLING.
BELL MAY ALSO REVERSE THE POLARITY OF THE LINE TO START BILLING--IF YOU HAVE
A TONE FONE THE KEYPAD WON'T WORK IF THE POLARITY IS REVERSED.  USUALLY, THE
RED WIRE IS CALLED THE TIP SINCE IT IS THE MORE (+) OF THE 2 WIRES + THE GREEN
WIRE IS CALLED THE RING (-).

-- 
RING TRIP:
 
WHEN SOMEONE CALLS YOU BELL HAS TO SEND 90 VOLTS AC DOWN YOUR LINE AT ABOUT 60
HZ TO ACTIVATE YOUR BELL (THIS IS WHY DEAF PEOPLE CAN HAVE LIGHT BULBS
FANS GO OFF INSTEAD OF A BELL). THE DEVICE THAT DOES THE RINGING IS
CALLED A RINGING GENERATOR ANDTH PROCESS OF RINGING IS CALLED A RING
TRIP.  THIS COSTS BELL MONEY AND THEY DON'T LIKE USING ALL THAT ELECTRICITY
FROM THE LOCAL RIP-OFF POWER COMPANY SO LET IT RING.  THIS IS ALSO, HOW BELL
CAN CHECK FOR EXTRA FONES FROM THEIR CENTRAL OFFICE BY SEEING HOW MUCH
VOLTAGE THE LINE TAKES WHILE RINGING AND THEY CAN TELL HOW MANY FONES YOUR
NOT SUPPOSE TO HAVE.  SOLUTION:   DISCONNECT THE BELL.
 
MODERN TECHNOLOGY:
------------------
 
THE 2 WORST ENEMIES TO THE PHREAK BESIDES THE FBI + BELL SECURITY,ARE:
ESS + CCIS.  ESS STANDS FOR ELECTRONIC SWITHCING SYSTEM AND IT CAN TRACE A
CALL IN SECONDS, IT ALSO RECORDS ALL CALLS AND CAN EVEN TAP INTO LINES (ER..
I MEAN CHECK FOR LINE QUALITY) AND RECORD CALLS.  CCIS STANDS FOR COMMON
CHANNEL INTER-OFFICE SIGNALING AND IT ALLOWS FOR CONTROL SIGNALS TO BE SENT
VIA SEPARATE DATA LINKS INSTEAD OF TONES OVER THE VOICE CHANNEL--START
KISSING YOUR BLUE BOX GOODBYE.
