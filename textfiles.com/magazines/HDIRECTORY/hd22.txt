This article will deal with Satellite hacking, CB info, and car phone systems.
 
 
Satellite Control
 
     Companies try to build satellites to last for as long a time as possible.
Unfortunately, for the companies, things in space can happen unexpectantly and
suddently.  Take that satellite released by the space shuttle.  It's orbit
carried it way off the correct altitude.  The company's only hope was to fire a
rocket on it in order to bring it to the correct place.
     Now think...how does one on the ground fire a rocket in space?  Radio!
Gee, if the company could change the orbit, maybe we can too.  Sound
interesting?
     Of course we were not the first to think of this.  The satellite companies
have worried about this for a long time.  There are stories about top secret
codes, frequencies, and protocols required to 'nudge' one of those babies.
     The only problem is that-there is little information about this out there.
If you have any info, make a text file, and let others know of your knowledge.
But let me tell you all I know about a simple satellite whose telemetry is
known well.
     OSCAR 6 was a satellite sent up in order to take in amateur signals
between 145.9 and 146.0 MHz, and re-transmit them between 29.45 and 29.55 MHz
using a transponder.  Early in 1976, OSCAR 6 began to have battery problems.
The telemetry allowed the ground command stations to shut the satellite off at
regular intervals to prolong the useful life of the satellite.
     Now we know the satellite sent out telemetry reports at a certain
frequency (OSCAR 7 was 29.502 and 145.972 MHz).  And it sent them out in the
form of Morse code at about 20 wpm.  Information rate of spin, power use, and
temperature were sent out at 20 wpm.  This seems to suggest that the control
might have also used morse code.  Strangely enough, there was never any
information in the American Radio Relay League magazine about just how they
control the OSCAR satellites. (Hams know what's safe and what's crazy also)
 
     Suggestions: Don't overlook RTTY when trying to Satelhack (Satellite
hacking).  Also, chances are the owners will figure out what you did, so
'downing', the ultimate for a satelhack, is pretty difficult.
 
 
Citizen's Band
 
     CB is a very popular communications method.  Again, you need a license
from the FCC to operate legally.  But it's so hard to track down a CB signal 
unless you have a massive amplifier or talk for hours straight, there is little
 use in getting one.
     Here is a list of channel frequencies:
 
Channel                 Frequency
                          (MHz)
   1                     26.965
   2                     26.975
   3                     26.985
   4                     27.005
   5                     27.015
   6                     27.025
   7                     27.035
   8                     27.055
   9-emergency           27.065
  10                     27.075
  11-contact channel     27.085
  12                     27.105
  13                     27.115
  14                     27.125
  15                     27.135
  16                     27.155
  17                     27.165
  18                     27.175
  19-trucker's channel   27.185
  20                     27.205
  21                     27.215
  22                     27.225
  22A (optional)         27.235
  22B (optional)         27.245
  23                     27.255
 (you can figure out the pattern from here to 40.)

 
A Cheap Ghost-Interferance
 
     How can you start a real cheap ghost or interferance station? Well, the
Radio Shack wireless FM microphone (the clip on one) is pretty good for $19
(price may change).  It's range is about 100 ft outside, and 40 ft inside.
However, in the instructions it shows how it can be made stronger, but this
would not be in compliance with the FCC (oh darn!), so it can transmit about 10
00 ft outside.
 
 
Mobile Phones
 
     Radio phones have been around for a while.  The first mobile telephone
call was made September 11, 1946 between a Houston Post and a St. Louis Globe
reporter.  An old mobile phone service in New York city had 700 subscribers,
but could only handle 12 conversations at a time (because it had 12 channels).
There are some 160,000 mobile telephones nationwide.
     The old service was doomed to fail.  Each major city had one or two
powerful transmitters to communicate with all car phones in a 30- to 50-mile
radius.  To make a call from a car, you must find a vacant channel, then call
the operator and supply the number you want to call.  The operator dials the
number and connects you when the party answers.  Only a few companies have dial
it yourself service.  If someone wants to call you, they must first find the
mobile phone operator in your area.  The operator finds a vacant channel and
transmits a series of tones that correspond to your phone and make it ring-sort
of as if it were a pager.  Once you answer, the operator connects you and the
caller.
     Clearly, the system was slow.  Worse, it could only serve a few users at a
time.  During rush hour, there was little hope of making a call.  Few channels
could be added because of the dearth of frequencies for that kind of operation.
So now you can't get a mobile phone of this type unless someone else gives one 
up.
     Enter the cellular mobile radio.  Instead of only 1 or 2 transmitters, an 
area is divided up into many small sections, called 'cells'.  Wach has it's own
low-powered transmitter just strong enough to serve it's cell.  An average cell
covers from one to eight square miles and varies in shape from a circle to a
squashed football.  Each cell touches another, some overlap slightly.
     Adjacent cells use different channels-there are more than 600 in each city
to choose from-and a channel may be reused several times in the city if the
cells are located far enough apart.  All of the cells' transmitters hook into
one network switching office, much like a central office handles calls form lan
d-based telephones.
     Each transmitter constantly sends out a special signal, and as you drive
from cell to cell, your telephone automaticly tunes in the strongest cell. When
a call comes in for you, the network switching office uses the channel to send
a digital pulse signal that corresponds to your ten-digit phone number (NPA+7 d
igits).
     When the phone hears it's number, it in effect says 'Here I am, in this
certain cell'.  That information is sent back to the network switching office,
which scans vacant frequencies, and relays the information to your cell.
Finally, your unit tunes to that voice channel, and the cell site rings you,
and you talk.
     It sounds complicated-and it is.  But it works in seconds.  And it can be
expanded.  As more and more phones are added, cells can be split into smaller
cells with less power.  Cellular radio allready exists in Japan, Denmark,
Norway, and Sweden.  In Denmark, service began in 1981 and grew to 100,000
customers almost overnight.  Within a few years all of Scandinavia will have
compatable cellular systems.  Australia, Canada, and Mexico also plan systems.
     Why has the U.S. lagged behind?  Yep, it's our old freinds, the FCC.  They
studied the system for 12 years before okaying the service in 1982.  The U.S.
may be fullt celled by 1988.  Now is the time to rent your backyard as a
cellular station!
     The Bell companies will operate cellular service as the Cellular Service
Company.  Others such as GTE and MCI plan similar service.  Even the Washington
Post is trying to get into it.  There are allready two systems, one in
Washington/Baltimore, and one in Chicago.  Chicago users pay about $50 rent and
$25 monthly use fee for 120 minutes, and 25 cents/minute hereafter.  Average
bills are $150/month.
     The main unit mounts in the trunk, and just the handset sits up front. The
antennas are very small-about nine inches-and are hidden inside the car.
     Now freaking old car phone systems shoudln't be that hard if you really
try.  The following are the freq's to remember:
 
  158.07-158.49 MHz (mobile)
  152.81-153.03 MHz (base stations)
 
You CAN listen in on these freq's.  What I'm not sure about is whether you can
place a call --I would think so.  So Freq out!
 
COMMING SOON:  Repair trucks, installers, and linesmen, Marine Radio, and
Airplane phones
 
 
What is phreaking? (Quick reminder for the new kids).
------------------
 
Preaking involves ripping off ma bell and other phone companies such as MCI
and GTE.this can be done in a variety of ways.phreaking is almost 100% 
illegal,but has that ever stopped anybody?
 
How do you phreak?
------------------
 
There are 3 basic ways to phuck the phone companies:

1. Colored boxing.(blue,purple,etc.)
2. Using Sprint, Mci without paying.
3. "tricks of the trade"
 
Colored boxing
--------------
 
A pushbutton phone works by emmiting tones of different frequencies.by
changing the frequencies you can do some intresting stuff.phreaks have
realized this and have built devices called boxes.there are many types of
boxes here is a list of a few...
 
Types of boxes
-------------            
 
Color                     function
-----                     --------
Blue - all calls for the price of local
 
Purple- all calls free!
 
Silver- free calls,etc.army uses them!

Red box - makes sound of coin dropped
 
Cheese box-makes calls untracable


What are boxes continued
------------------------
 
Most of the above boxes work by making differnt tones for each key. There are
plans for: blue, silver, green, brown boxes, you just have to look for them.

How do you phreak with sprint?
------------------------------
 
 since the break up of AT&T cheaper phone companies such as:
 
ITT, MCI, GTE SPRINT, METROPHONE, WESTERN UNION.

and many more..

You can get programs that will call MCI, or whatever and try consecutive
numbers until it gets one.to fight against this the companys use 2 things...
 
1.they have dummy numbers that you think work but when you call using it
they trace you!
 
2.they change the numbers randomly every week or less,so you cant use
a number to long!
 
here are some access numbers you can try hacking...
 
access numbers
--------------
 
METROPHONE-(415) 579-6001
ITT-(415) 858-2750
MCI-(415) 495-2640
SPRINT-(415) 348-7700
