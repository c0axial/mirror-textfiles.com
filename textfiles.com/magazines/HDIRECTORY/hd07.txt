OK, HERE IS AN EASY EXTENDER TO HACK (IT IS TMC). THEY HAVE LOCAL DIALUPS TOO.
I SUGGEST HACKING ON THE LOCAL ONE, THEN USING THEM ON THE 800 #.. IT IS:
 1 800/ 527 3390   7 DIGITS.

WHY IS IT SO EASY? BECAUSE IT GIVES A BAD CODE SIREN IMMEDIATELY IF THE CODE 
IS BAD.. SO IF YOU ENTER 1234567 AS SOON AS YOU HIT 7, IT WILL "PLAY" THE 
SIREN. AN APPLECAT PROGRAM CAN EASILY BE WRITTEN TO HACK CODES.. YOU HAVE TO 
MODIFY THE AUDIO DETECT FILTER.

OK PEOPLE HERE IS THE LAST OF MY NEW MCI CODES THAT I HACKED...

HOW ABOUT SOME OPTIONS ON CONFERENCES LIKE

CONTROL TRANSFER
----------------
(FROM WITHIN CONFERENCE)
#61 NPA-EXC-XXXX

AND IT WILL TRANFER THE CONTROL TO THE INDIVIDUAL YOU SPECIFY.

WELL, I USE THE CHICAGO CONFERENCE, AND I ASKED THE OPERATOR WHY I COULDN'T
TRANSFER CONTROLL, SHE SAID IT WAS ABUSED.  AS FOR KICKING SOMEONE OFF,
YOU CAN END THE CONFERENCE #* THEN HANG UP, BUT NOT JUST KILL ONE PARTY.

MANY PBX'S BECOME PABX'S AFTER WORK HOURS, PBX & PABX HAVE COME TO THE 
POINT WHERE YOU CAN USE THEM INTERCHANGABLY AND STILL BE CORRECT. REALLY, MOST
PHREAKS ARE ONLY INTERESTED IN PABX'S, BUT THEY ARE JUST CALLED PBX'S...


INTERESTING LOOP- 212-504-9979/99


WELL, A PBX IS NOT AUTO-MATED, AS IN NO TT'S!!!!!  BUT, THE 
[P]RIVATE [A]UTOMATIC [B]RANCH [E]XCHANGE IS AUTOMATED AND CAN ACCEPT TT'S.
 (TT = TouchTone)

BE CAREFUL WHEN USING THIS ONE, WHILE SCREWING AROUND, A FRIEND OF MINE 
CALLED THE PBX FROM THE PBX. WELL, THAT WAS OVER 24 HOURS AGO AND THE PBX 
*STILL* HASN'T RESET. I GUESS WE'LL  JUST HAVE TO WAIT TILL THEY GET TO WORK 
TUESDAY MORNING. (AND CHANGE THE CODE.) LATER...


HERE IS A LIST OF EVERY PBX THAT I KNOW OF.  THE BEGINNING ONES EITHER
HAVE LOST ALLIANCE CAPABILITIES OR THE ACCESS CODES HAVE DIED.  I WILL
GIVE THE LAST WORKING CODES FOR THEM. THE ENDING ONES ALL HAVE WORKING CODES 
AND ARE ALLIANCE CAPABLE..  I WILL NOT GIVE OUT ALL THE ACCESS CODES, JUST
A FEW WORKING ONES, BUT ENJOY...

JUST GOT ONTO RSTS 9.0 AND THE CHANGES ARE GREAT. YOU CAN CREATE YOUR OWN
LOGIN FILE AND DCL IS A LANGUAGE! YOU CAN ALSO SET THE PROMPT CHARACTER
TO BE ANYTHING YOU WANT AND MUCH MORE.

UNIX'S HAVE HAD LOGIN FILES EVER SINCE SYSTEM V 1.0. MEANING 99% OF THE UNIX SYSTEMS YOU FIND WILL HAVE A LOGIN FILE ALREADY CREATED FOR YOU AND YOU MAY
MODIFY IT AT WILL..

RSTS OS IS A STEP BEHIND..


HERE'S A MCI ACCESS POST AND ACCESS CODE THAT CAN BE USED FOR PLACING
OVERSEAS CALLS.

1 614 224 6122 86218 THEN OF COURSE 011 AND COUNTRY CODE AND SO FORTH.

ALSO, I HAPPENED TO OBSERVE A UNIX SYSTEM OPERATOR IN ACTION GIVING
ME A UNIX SYSTEM ACCESS, IT CAN BE DONE FRO ANY TERMINAL,
BY ANYBODY THE SYSTEM IS A PDP11, 1985.  IT WENT A LITTLE FAST FOR
ME BUT IF ANYONE CAN FILL IN THE VACANCIES, GREAT. USING THE

S/XX/XX/P 
COMMAND(SUBSTITUTE)


I'VE BEEN HAVING SOME FUN WITH PBX'S LATELY..  EXPERIMENTING TO FIND
THEIR DIFFERENCES AND SIMULARITIES TO NORMAL WATS EXTENDERS..

ONE THING I NEVER BOTHERED TRYING WAS 900 NUMBERS..  900 NUMBERS ARE THE
NUMBERS YOU SEE ALL THE TIME WHEN COMPANIES ARE TOO CHEAP TO GET A REAL
FONE NUMBER, SO THEY RENT A 900 NUMBER, AND ANYONE WHO CALLS PAYS 50
CENTS..  (WHADAY BARGEN..)

FIRST OF ALL, THROUGH PBX'S YOU CAN DIAL 900 NUMBERS FOR PHREE.. 
JUST REMEMBER WHEN YOU GET THAT DIAL TONE RIGHT BEFORE 07004561001,
TYPE 1-900-XXX-XXXX...

I'VE ALSO BEEN PLAYING WITH 0900XXXXXXX, BUT HAVEN'T BEEN
GETTING FAR..  I'VE BEEN PLAYING WITH THE 700'S ALSO, THERE HAS TO
BE MORE IN THE 700'S THEN JUST ALLIANCE (QUORUM-P CONFERENCING)

ONE OTHER THING I'VE BEEN PLAYING WITH (IN CASE YOU'RE EVEN CURIOUS)
IS THE 200 NPA..  FOR THOSE THAT DON'T KNOW, IF YOU DIAL 200-YOUR
FONE NUMBER, YOU'LL HEAR A COMPUTER READ BACK YOUR FONE NUMBER..  I'VE
BEEN TRYING TO GET IT TO READ BACK THIS INFO FROM PBX'S WITHOUT MUCH
SUCCESS..  I PLAN ON EXPERIMENTING  WITH SIMPLE MCI/SPRINT/METRO DIALUPS
AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS...

OK, A PHRIEND OF MINE, WAS TELLING ME ABOUT THIS CALL HE GOT THE OTHER NIGHT 
FROM SOME BITCH FROM A COMPANY CALLED "MIC" (NOT MCI).

MESSAGE INVESTIGATION COMPANY
MESSAGE AS IN MESSAGE UNIT-PHONE TIME!)  ANYWAYS, IT SEEMS SOME OLD LADY IN
MEMPHIS (WE'RE IN TENN ALSO) GOT A # BILLED TO HER BILL AND SHE SAYS SHE
DIDN'T MAKE IT.  OK, WELL, HE HAS BEEN PAYING FOR HIS CALLS LATELY AS HE'S
OLDER AND THEY'D PUT HIM UNDER THE JAIL IF HE GOT BUSTED, ANYWAYS, THIS BITCH
CALLS HIM UP AND HAD EVIDENTILY BEEN GOING THROUGH PEOPLES BILLS LOOKING FOR
OTHER PEOPLE WHO CALLED THAT #. (FUNNY, EH?)
IT JUST STRUCK ME DAMN STRANGE THAT THEY WERE GOING THROUGH THE 
BILLS LOOKING FOR OTHERS.  ANYONE FAMILIAR WITH THESE "MIC" PEOPLE?


WHY NOT PREAK FROM 1 PLACE TO THE OTHER?  IT SURE AS HELL WILL SCREW UP 
THE TRACERS. THERE ARE ALOT OF BRANCHES OF AT&T THAT DO NOTHING BUT RANDOMLY
TRACE CALLS, BUT I HAVE THE INFO FROM A GUY NAMED MIKE WHO IS IN ONE OF THOSE 
BRANCHES.  THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING WHEN THEY CATCH SOMEONE PREAKING THAT I 
KNOW. AT LEAST HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.  AS FAR AS I KNOW THEY JUST KEEP 
TABS TO SEE HOW WE DO IT, AND WHO KNOWS
