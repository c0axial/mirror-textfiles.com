[ Custom Calling Phone Tapping        ]
Procedure:
 
[1]  Call up your target person with the phone you have call waiting. When
     they answer their call waiting (he's already on the phone, and you are
     the 2nd caller), then you sit there and say nothong, or as a stupid
     question or say: sorry, I must have the wrong #.
[2]  Next, you wait until he goes back to the other line (puts you on hold).
[3]  Then, pick up your other line and call ->YOUR<- phone with call waiting.
[4]  Answer Your call waiting.
[5]  Then go back to him. (Answer, and then click back..)
[6]  Hang up your second line
[7]  You are now on the line with the person you called and the person he 
     is talking to!
[8]  Listen, but be quiet, they can hear you.

What to use to prevent noise.

If you have call forwarding, turn it on and forward calls somewhere
before you start listening. If a call comes through on your call waiting
circuit, the people talking (your Target and their friend) will not hear
anything, but after you answer call waiting and come back, they will
hear the other call hang up (two clicks). If you don't have call forwarding,
get it if you are going to make a habit of this.
