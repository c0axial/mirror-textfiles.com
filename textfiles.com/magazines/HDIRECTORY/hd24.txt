TRASHING!
---------

  AN INSPECTION OF YOU LOCAL TELCO OFFICE TRASH RECEPTACLES CAN REVEAL A WEALTH
OF DOCUMENTS OF GREAT INTEREST TO A TEL ECOMMUNICATIONS HOBBIEST.  THE FONE
COMPANY DOESN'T EXPECT ANYONE EXCEPT MAYBE BUMS TO PAW THROUGH THEIR REFUGE,
AND THEREFORE OFTEN DISPOSES SOME INTER ESTING MATERIALS.  IN ALL THE
INSTALLATION WE HAVE INVESTIGATED, THE  COMPANY DOESN'T SHRED OR INCINERATE
ANYTHING.  MOST SITES HAVE THEIR GARBAGE IN TRASH BAGS CONVENIENT FOR REMOVAL
AN LEISURELY INSPECTION AT HOME.

  OUR FIRST HIT OF THE NIGHT WAS OF AN AT&T INFORMATION SYSTEMS OFFICE
BUILDING.  WE GATHERED A LARGE MASS OF MANUALS AND BINDERS.  THEN WE MOVED
ONWARD TO HIT AT&T COMMUNCATIONS, THE LOCAL BUSINESS OFFICE, OUR CENTRAL
OFFICE, AND ANOTHER BELL SITE.  AFTER A SUCCESSFUL SESSION, WE DECIDED TO CALL
IT A NIGHT.

  WE SORTED THE PILES OF GARBAGE FOR THINGS OF MERIT. A MAJORITY OF NOTHING,
BUT THERE WAS SOME INTERESTING ITEMS, SO WE SALVAGED SEVERAL THINGS OF WORTH.

  NUMEROUS THINGS OF INTEREST CAN BE FOUND IN BELL TRASH.  ONES THAT ARE OF USE
TO ANYONE ARE BINDERS AND NOTEBOOKS WITH THE BELL LOGO ON THEM, GOOD FOR
IMPRESSING FRIENDS.  ALSO, SUPPLIES OF BELL LETTERHEAD ARE GOOD FOR SCARING
PHRIENDS.  DOCUMENTS OF MORE INTEREST TO PHREAKS CAN ALSO BE FOUND.  COSMOS
PRINTOUTS ABOUND IN ANY CO TRASH.  IN HOUSE TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES LIST
EMPLOYEES OF BELL, GOT TO TRY SOCIAL ENGINEERING ON.  MANUALS ALSO HAVE MERIT
FOR THE PHREAK.  MAINTENANCE REPORTS, TRUNK OUTAGES REPORTS, LINE REPORTS,
NETWORK CONTROL ANALYSIS (NCA), TSPS DOCUMENTS, AND LISTS OF ABBREVIATIONS USED
BY THE FONE COMPANY CAN BE FOUND.  THE LATTER IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE AS IT
ALLOWS ONE TO DECIPHER THE CRYPTIC DOCUMENTS.  BELL SEEMS TO LOVE RIDICULOUS
AND MYSTERIOUS ABBREVIATIONS AND ANACRONYMS.

                            "LOOKING FOR NOTEBOOKS"

  THE EXPERT TRASHER MUST BE WILLING TO PHYSICALLY ENTER THE DUMPSTER.  ONLY
REACHING IN FOR EASILY OBTAINABLE OBJECTS MISSES HEAVY MANUALS THAT TEND TO
SINK TO THE BOTTOM.  HUGE BULKY PRINTOUTS, DIRECTORIES, AND OBESE MANUALS AS
WELL AS BINDERS SETTLE OUT OF REACH.  ALSO, ONCE IN THE DUMPSTER, INQUISITIVE
SECURITY CAN'T SEE YOU.                

  SPEAKING OF SECURITY, WHAT ARE THE DANGERS OF TRASHING?  WELL, WE DON'T KNOW,
HAVING NEVER BEEN CAUGHT AT IT.  THE BASIC FACT WHICH PROTECTS THE TRASHER IS
THE LUDICROUSNESS OF SOMEONE STEALING YOUR GARBAGE.  PROBABLY THE MOST THEY CAN
GET YOU FOR IS TRESPASSING, AND MOST OF THE TIME THEY'LL PROBABLY JUST THROW
YOU OFF OF THE PROPERTY.  GOOD EXCUSES FOR BEING AROUND THE DUMPSTER ARE THAT
YOU ARE PASSING THROUGH ON A SHORTCUT, THAT A BALL OR FRISBEE HAS FLOWN IN, OR
YOU ARE LOOKING FOR NOTEBOOKS FOR SCHOOL.

  A GOOD WAY TO AVOID UNNECESSARY SURVEILLANCE BY TELCO EMPLOYEES IS TO TRASH
LATE AT NIGHT, AFTER MOST HAVE GONE HOME.  WEEKENDS, ESPECIALLY SUNDAY NIGHTS,
LEAVE THE SITES DESERTED, EXCEPT FOR SECURITY OR JANITORIAL STAFF.  BEFORE
STARTING ON A TRASHING RUN, BE SURE TO RECONNOITER THE AREA, AND FIND OUT THE
SCHEDULE OF GARBAGE COLLECTION.  THAT WAY YOU CAN HIT THE TRASH AT THE FULLEST
AOD MOST PROFITABLE TIME.

  ONE THING THAT SIMPLIFIES TRASHING RUNS IS THE USE OF A CAR.  A CAR WILL
ALLOW ONE TO HIT TRASH SITES FARTHER AFIELD, AS WELL AS ASSISTING IN THE
REMOVAL OF BAGS AND BOXES OF TRASH TO SORT AT YOUR LEISURE.  TRASH SORTING
REALLY SHOULDN'T BE DONE ON SITE AS IT INCREASES THE POSSIBLE TIME FOR YOUR
DISCOVERY BY SECURITY.  REMOVING GARBAGE BY FOOT INVITES STARES AND LIMITS THE
AMOUNT THAT CAN BE REMOVED.  THE CAR SHOULD DROP OFF THE TRASHERS AND RETURN
ABOUT A HALF HOUR LATER, DEPENDING ON THE AMOUNT OF TRASH THERE.  BEFORE
DROPPING THEM OFF, BE SURE TO INVESTIGATE IF THERE IS ANY TRASH IN THE FIRST
PLACE FOR, AS PAST EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN, THEY TEND TO GET QUITE ANGERED WHEN
THEY HAVE SPENT THE LAST HOUR STARING AT AN EMPTY TRASH CONTAINER.

  THE ON-SITE TRASHERS SHOULD BE WILLNG TO HOP INTO THE DUMPSTER.  AS WE
MENTIONED, THIS MAXIMIZES THE AMOUNT OF TRASH THAT CAN BE REACHED.  THEY SHOULD
RIP OPEN ANY BAGS, SHOVING THE UNINTERESTING ONES TO THE REAR AND BOTTON OF THE
CONTAINER, WHILE BRINGING NEW ONES TO THE FOREFRONT.  BOXES IN THE TRASH SHOULD
BE USED TO CARRY THE DOCUMENTS INTO THE TRUNK OF THE CAR FOR LEISURELY SORTING.
THIS SHOULD BE DONE WITH A MINIMUM OF NOISE AND LIGHT, IF FLASHLIGHTS ARE TO BE
USED.  THE TRASHER SHOULDN'T ATTEMPT TO TAKE THE BEST STUFF, JUST TO GRAB AS
MUCH AS LOOKS INTERESTING.

  AT THE APPOINTED TIME, THE CAR SHOULD RETURN AND PICK UP THE TRASHERS.  BOXES
SHOULD BE STUFFED IN THE TRUNK AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.  SMELL WON'T BE MUCH OF
A PROBLEM, AS ALL YOU ARE TAKING ARE PAPERS.  OCCASIONALLY A BAG OF COFFEE
GRINDS SMELLS UP THE WORKS, BUT YOU, AT ALL COSTS, SHOULD AVOID CAFETERIA
DUMPSTERS AS THE ROTTING FOOD REALLY REEKS, AND CONTAINS LITTLE OF VALUE TO THE
TELECOMMUNICATIONS HOBBIEST.

  THE CAR SHOULD THEN DRIVE OFF TO A SAFE AND SECLUDED SPOT TO SORT THE TRASH.
THE LOCATION SHOULD BE WELL LIT AND HAVE ANOTHER DUMPSTER HANDY TO THROW THE
REAL TRASH OUT PERMANENTLY.  THE VALUABLE STUFF SHOULD BE TAKE HOME AND SORTED
ACCORDING TO TYPE.  BY KEEPING ALL OF THE SIMILAR STUFF TOGETHER, PATTERNS CAN?

[ FED WATCH! ]
--------------

THE TRAP-LOOKING FOR A FEDERAL AGENT IS BIG NEWS. OBVIOUSLY, THESE PEOPLE
ARE SLIPPERY AND WILL DISAPPEAR IF BEING NOTICED. A PERFECT EXAMPLE IS
RICHARD SANDZA OF NEWSWEEK FAME WHO GOT SNIFFED OUT, AND
THEN SAT DOWN TO COMPOSE HIS STUNNING INSIGHT INTO THE WORLD OF HACKERS,
"NIGHT OF THE HACKERS". ANOTHER WOULD BE CABLE PAIR, WHO IN 1983 CAUSED  THE 
NUMEROUS BUSTS THAT OCCURED BETWEEN THE SUMMER AND WINTER OF THAT YEAR.
BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR?  WHAT IF YOU SUSPECT SOMEONE BUT
ARE NOT SURE...YOU DONT ACCUSE THEM, JUST REFER BACK TO THESE HANDY LITTLE
HINTS.... THIS FILE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY, AND THE SYSOP IS
NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT I HAVE ENTERED.

LESSON 2]: TIPS:

HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THIS ON YOUR FAVE RAVE PHREAK BOARD:
 
  "LEAVE ME A PHONE NUMBER AND I WILL GET IN TOUCH WITH YOU..WE CAN TRADE SOME
   CODEZ..."

THIS PERSON IS OBVIOUSLY BLOTTED OUT OF HIS GOURD, OR HE IS TRYING TO GET SOME
INFO ON YOU!  FEDS WANT TO KNOW PEOPLE AND KNOW AS MUCH ABOUT THEM AS
THEY CAN WITHOUT GETTING FOUND OUT.  SO, DONT MESS WITH THESE KINDS OF PEOPLE.
 
HOW ABOUT THIS COMMON ONE:
 
  "CAN I HAVE A TRW ACCOUNT FOR A SYSTEM? I AM REAL INTERESTED..."

LISTEN. DURING THIS TERRIBLE YEAR OF TERROR REIGNING FROM MONTANA BUTTHACK'S
ARTICLE, YOU DONT TRUST ANYONE WITH YOUR PERSONALLY GOTTEN/HACKED OUT
ACCOUNT UNLESS YOU KNOW THEM. AND, ABOVE ALL, DONT POST THEM ON PUBLIC SYSTEMS
WHERE EVERY FED IN 30 STATES CAN GET THEM AND CHECK THEM OUT.  IF ENOUGH PEOPLE
HAVE YOUR OWN PERSONAL ACCOUNTS, THEN THE DAMN THINGS ARE LIKELY TO BE TURNED 
OFF FROM TOO MANY PEOPLE HAVING A CREDIT CHECK BY THE LENOXX BANK OF MASS.
EVER HEAR--

  "GOT ANY NEW VISA'S OR MASTERCARDS?"
 
 WHAT WAS SAID ABOUT PW'S GOES DOUBLE FOR CREDIT CARDS.  I WOULD BE DOUBLY
CAREFUL ABOUT THE OBTAINING AND/OR USE OF THEM.  I DONT DO THAT STUFF AND NEVER
WILL BECAUSE I DONT WANT TO GIVE THE FEDS THE CHANCE TO SAY,"HEY, THIS KID'S
ST DROPPING HIS PANTS AND BENDING HIM OVER.  LET'S GIVE HIM THE STICK."
 
WHAT ABOUT...
 
   "CAN SOMEONE TELL ME HOW TO PHREAK"

                   OR

   "CAN SOMEONE TEACH ME HOW TO HACK

DONT BE TOO TRUSTING ANY MORE ABOUT NEW PHREAKS/HACKS UNLESS THEY LOOK LIKE
INNOCENT KIDS.   YOU ALL SHOULD KNOW HOW TO TELL IF THERE IS SOME KID THAT
COMES FROM A GOOD JEWISH, UPPER-MIDDLE CLASS FAMILY THAT WANTS TO KNOW THE
HOW-TO STUFF AND THAT IS OKAY. BUT ALWAYS ASK THREE QUESTIONS OF YOUR
APPRENTICES:
 
   1]WHAT IS YOUR NAME
 
   2]WHAT IS YOUR PHONE NUMBER
 
   3]HOW OLD ARE YOU
 

  NUMBER THREE IS CRUCIAL..IF THEY ARE OVER 19 YEARS OF AGE, DONT WASTE YOUR
TIME OR EFFORT UNLESS, THE PERSON ON THE SYSTEM CAN PROVE THAT HE IS SOME
HACKER THAT IS WELL KNOWN.  YOU DONT KNOW THEM AND YOU WANT NOTHING TO DO
WITH THEM. IF THEY DO LIE ABOUT THEIR AGE (YOU CAN TELL IF YOU TALK TO THEM
VOICE DUM DUM) AND THEY ARE UNDER 19, THEN YOU CAN TELL THEM OKAY. JUST STAY
COOL ABOUT IT.
 
  WELL, THAT IS ALL THAT I CAN THINK OF NOW. IF ANYONE HAS ANY ADDITIONS,
YOU CAN COMPOSE A FILE.
