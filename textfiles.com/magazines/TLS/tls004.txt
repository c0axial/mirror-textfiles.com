                  Welcome To The Lawless Society. Issue #4.

    Any upcoming or experienced hacker knows that there comes a time when a 
telephone and a PC will no longer suffice.  There are certain tools of the 
trade that start out as a bit of fun and experimentation but soon become 
necessity.   The following is a list of companies that sell items which will 
help greatly in your quest.  Some of the items are common but not readily 
available and others are just plain hard to find and even thought of as 
illegal even though they are not.  Some companies sell complete items, some 
sell kits, some sell plans, and some sell all three.  We will provide you with 
a listing of the company's name, what they sell, their address, and the phone 
number and price of a catalog if available.

    If one wants cable for free, one has two options.  You can either rig your 
cable box and risk detection and possible prosecution or you can buy a cable 
descrambler from another company.  Aftermarket descramblers ARE legal in most 
states.  The crime is tampering with a box that is owned by the cable company.  
If you own your own box they can say NOTHING!  You only have to pay them for 
the feed which is usually under $5 per month.(Depending on your cable company)
    If you are going to order a descrambler, you must get the same brand that 
your cable company uses.  Most of the companies that follow, supply from 5 to 
10 different brands, so you should have no problem in locating one that will 
work.  All boxes offered from the companies listed in this text file are 
gauranteed to be "bullet" proof.

    Most of these companies will not sell to anyone in the same state in which 
they operate.  I don't know exactly why.  I guess it's illegal or something.  
But, pick one that's not in your state and give them a call.  You should have 
no trouble at all.  Prices range from $45 to about $199 depending on which box 
you need and who you buy from.  So shop around a bit.  And of course, if you 
are half the hacker you think you are, you shouldn't be paying for these 
anyway.

The following company sells information books/booklets.  This company has 
taken my idea (guess I'm too slow to act) and decided to market information 
which has been circulated in many text files.  But, they have compiled and 
reasearched all of the information assuring that it is as accurate as 
possible.  We were going to keep this one for ourselves, but since we are here 
to give out information...we figured we'd "throw you a bone".  This company 
sells books on subjects such as:

Plans for 15 phone "color" boxes.  (Blue Box, Black Box etc...)
How To Hack Voice Mail Systems.    (Discusses ALL Major systems and hacking
                                    methods.)
TV Decoders And Converters
Stopping Home Power Meters         (Fool The Electric Company!)
How To Get Free Gasoline
World's Best Con's And Scams
Computer Phreaking
World's Greatest ATM Scams

These books are NOT stories about great hackers.  These are instructional and 
how-to books!  Prices range from $14.00 to $30.00 depending on the topic you 
want.
