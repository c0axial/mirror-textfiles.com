                  Welcome To The Lawless Society. Issue #6.


    I don't know why, but for some reason I've had drugs on my mind lately.  
Perhaps it's because I haven't gotten high or even really drunk in a few 
months.  It's April here on the Jersey shore and in a few short months the 
streets and especially the boardwalk will come alive with drugs for sale, for 
trade, and possibly for free.
    Anyway, what I plan to discuss are a few good ways of using Marijuana 
which is the most common drug available.  I'll also offer a few suggestions on 
what to do once you've achieved a good high.
    Pot is probably my favorite for recreational use since there's a variety 
of ways to use it and it is usually very easy to hide the fact the you are 
high on it if you have to.

                             Part I: Smoke Up!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

 The first and most obvious way of using pot is smoking it.  Most people smoke 
pot by rolling it in cigarette paper or smoking it in a pipe (bowl).  If 
you're the die-hard joint smoker who loves to roll, let me just suggest that 
you look for papers called "Randy's".  The papers have a wire running through 
the length of each paper.  As you smoke, the wire is exposed and as you get 
down to the end of the joint you hold the wire, thereby eliminating the need 
for a roach clip.  These are by far my favorites.

Now let's move on to bowls.  Myself, I like to make my own bowls.  With a bit 
of imagination you can make a bowl out of quite a few ordinary items you 
probably have around the house.  The easiest is made from the cardboard 
rollers in the center of your toilet paper or paper towels.  Cut about a 1/2 
inch hole in the roller and cover it with tin foil.  Poke several holes in the 
foil with a toothpick or similar object and you're good to go.  Another failry 
common makeshift bowl is made from a soda can.  This one can be a real pain in 
the ass to make if you're out somewhere with no papers and just want a quick 
high.  What you do is crush the can in the center.  Now, find a sharp object 
and poke holes through 1 side of the can where you now have a dent.  Place 
your pot over the holes and ignite.  (Suck through the drinking hole in the 
can if you haven't figured it out by now.)  I've known plenty of people who've 
made some great bowls out of various pipes and other things.  If you manage to 
find some small diameter pipe used for air condintioning or something you may 
want to try your hand at that.  BTW: Unscrew your kitchen faucet for a screen 
to use.  The screens in faucets work great to keep the ash out of your throat.
My favorite home made bowl is the tin foil bowl.  Simply get yourself a 
descent sized sheet of tin foil and a pen.  Roll the foil around the pen so 
that you have a tube, now bend one end of the foil up about 1/2 inch or so 
from the end and you've got the perfect bowl.  No screen is needed since the 
you can simply pinch the bottom of the bowl and no ash will come through. (You 
will still get all the smoke though!)  This bowl is also nice to carry around 
since you can easily flatten it out and then just re-roll it when you want to 
smoke.  It's also easily tossable just in case you have to get rid of it 
quick.

The third way of smoking pot is with a water pipe.  More commonly known as a 
water bong or just plain "bong".  Bongs come in a variety of shapes and sizes.  
I myself have not used a bong on all that many occasions but they do give you 
a GREAT high rather quickly.  Bongs can be bought at most tobacco shops or at 
your local "drug store".  A store bought bong will give you the best results 
but there are ways to make one at home that should do the trick for you.  
Plastic milk or juice jugs work the best.  Simply melt a hole just big enough 
for a pen to fit through in the side of the container.  Next get a BIC pen or 
something similar.  Rip the innards out of the pen, all you need is the shell.  
Stick the point end of the pen into the bottle and position it so that it's 
halfway in.  Next take a lighter and melt the bottle around the pen so that it 
is sealed.  You can also use epoxy or model glue if you like, this usually 
works better.  Now fill the bottle with water so that the half of the pen 
that's in the bottle is submerged.  You will now place your pot in the open 
end of the pen sticking out of the hole in the bottle.  I would recommend 
sticking some crumpled tin foil down into the pen so that you don't  wind up 
sucking your pot down into the pen where you can't re-light it if it should go 
out.  Now light your weed and suck in through the opening on the top of the 
bottle.  You will get nothing but pure smoke.  Adding some ice to the water 
will cool the smoke considerably and allow you to take bigger hits.  Try to be 
careful not to burn the pen.  The plastic will give off some pretty toxic 
fumes.  But hey, you're smoking pot, you can't be too worried about your 
health!

                          Part II:  Eat Your Weed!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

And the final method of using pot, Eat It!  Although it will take a bit longer 
for it to hit you, you can get high from eating pot.  Here's a few short 
recipes for some magical treats.  Just add in about 1/2 cup of ground up weed 
to the following things and start cookin'!

First let's start with everyone's favorite, magic brownies.  Get your favorite 
brownie mix and mix everything it tells you to mix on the box, except for the 
butter.  Put the butter in a pan and heat up to where it's just beginning to 
melt and then mix your pot into it.  Now add that into the rest of your mix 
and bake as usual.  The trick is that THC is fat soluable.  That means it 
dissolves into fat better than anything else.  So use real butter and try not 
to get low cal brownie mix, the more fat in there, the more THC that will be 
absorbed into the mixture.

  I think it's fairly obvious that you shouldn't use your best weed for 
cooking.  You WILL get stoned from eating it, but if it's good weed you're 
better off smoking it.

                         Part III: I'm Stoned! What Now?

 Ok, so now you're really stoned and wondering what to do.  The first and most 
obvious suggestion is to sit back vegetate and watch "The Wall".  But, if 
you've been smoking for a while and need something new to do, here's a few 
simple suggestions.

Take about $20 and hit the local arcade.
Drink the JD Or Beer You Should Have Had In Your Bong.
Shoot Some Pool!  (I love doing it stoned)
Call A Board And Get The Other TLS Files!
Have Some Good Sex. (Did I really have to tell you that one?)
