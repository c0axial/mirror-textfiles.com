        Twisted images are scrolling up and down the walls, weaving their 
threads of artificial joviality into a dynamic insubstantial blur. Fear 
runs through my heart as I pass through the lights into a dark room where 
I must wait until the time is full. Earlier the Man Who Knows called again.

        It was three years ago when it happened, I saw a god, and killed 
him. Killed through ideas, a sharp blade of logic that has since become 
dull and useless. There was no feeling of any kind, just a sort of cold 
rational fugue that took control of my mind. A god is nothing but a 
swirling cloud of irrationality, independant of mere biology. That day 
set me into a spiral of despair and longing that I never thought I would 
escape. When I met the Man Who Knows. 

        I don't know what his name is, or if he even has a name, but it 
is true that he truely Knows everything. I met him in a bar one night
after I got off of work. I was trying to drink myself into oblivion,
emptying glass after glass of cheap tap beer when he sat down on the
stool next to me. The conversation that followed is not important, it was
the aftermath of that night that put me where I am today. 

        He told me that when I killed my god, I had killed my source of 
the chaotic energy that I needed to live. He told me that if I didn't let 
him help me out I'd be a dead man in a very short time. You see, he said, 
without the primal chaos there can be no flux. Without that flux in your 
life, order seeps through your being and you are doomed to the unending 
torture of absolute stagnancy.

        Quite frankly I was scared shitless by the prospect of becoming a 
living statue. So when I went home I couldn't get his words out of my 
mind. Looking back I suppose I was already hooked, and nothing could have 
been different. The next day I met him at the same bar and he reeled me 
in. He had what I needed - a source of chaotic energy. He offered it to 
me, with stipulations, of course. I should have declined his offer, but I 
was in a state of panic. I would have done anything he said. Later on, I 
did.

        I'm not going to go into what exactly I had to do, I'm ashamed of 
myself as it is. For a stretch of time, however, I felt wonderful, back 
to my old self. It was a good time for me, I was mainlining power. Then 
He started asking more and more of me, demanding I do things no sane man 
would ever do. I did what I was told, craving the power I had become used 
to. Today he asked me for the supreme sacrifice, the lump sum of my debt. 
I can't say no, because what he offers in exchange is far too great. 
Still, I fear for myself, and everyone else in the world.

        Now I sit in the dark behind a desk. The only illumination is 
from a small display inset in the top of the desk. I can feel when he 
enters the room, a chill races through my body. He sits down opposite me 
and tells me that I know what I have to do. My hands tremble as they type 
the launch commands. When it is done he tells me to get up from behind 
the desk. When I get near him he takes my hand and we fade away. While 
the rest of the world writhes in the nuclear flames, I watch from beyond.
I see the end, and the beginning, through a curtain of pink noise. When
it is over, He joins me again and leads me toward my destiny.


                                                               -Oi-


                             "I hope you dig it."
