        MISSING, PRESUMED DEAD:  Ashtray Heart, from parts unknown.  Mr.
 Heart was last spotted at the Internet Technology Interface Consortium in
 Belgium, where he was behaving in a bizarre and unpredictable manner after
 apparently having ingested an ergot-infested slice of date nut loaf.  He is
 thought to have died in an extremely cosmic and heavy manner, possibly by
 dereferencing his own null pointer.  No body has been found.

        Heart is survived by seven eyeballs, Norton Zenger, Lorem Ipsum,
 Jahweh W, Rubber Biscuit, and David Lynch.  Heart left behind a notebook
 full of unreleased works, mostly in a bizarre cipher.  They will be
 published as we can decipher them.  We have already managed to translate the
 largest chunk of it, a "Space Ghost" fanfic entitled "Sic Tansit (Sic)
 Gloria Mundi".  However, it will not be published here on the grounds that
 it fails to meet our exacting journalistic standards.

        Funeral donations should be sent to Focus on the Family in lieu of
 flowers.
