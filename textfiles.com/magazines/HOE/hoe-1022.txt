 Chapter One

	Jamie and I were all alone in her apartment, presumably getting
 ready to fuck.  We had been doing this, whenever I felt the need, for
 many years.  Jamie was a hooker.  I was just a guy who couldn't get
 himself a woman in any honorable way.  The fact is, I detest most women
 to a degree that renders me incapable of courting them.  Regardless of my
 misogynist curse, Jamie and I were very close friends.
	I took off my belt and she looked at me, full of lust.  Her eyes
 avoided my face and lingered on my arms.  Jamie adores my arms.  I took
 my belt in both hands and wrapped it around her calf, using it as a
 tourniquet.  After smacking and stroking at the stubborn channels of
 Jamie's ankle, I sunk the needle into a cooperating vein.
	When Jamie feels the prick of the needle, she smiles, but as I
 drive it into her vein, she still feels the pain.  I love seeing her in
 pain.  "Aah!  It hurts," she says.  "Be careful."
	"The needle gets dull with age," I say, reassuring her with the
 truth.  Of course, by the time these words escape my lips, the pain is
 gone.  Jamie watches my hands as I pull the plunger back.  The eager
 blood that fills the chamber assures that I've made a direct hit.  This
 tiny cloud of blood is the first to mix with the heroin solution before I
 send it all back home into Jamie's ankle.
	She always looks at me at first as if it's not going to be enough.  
 It makes me smile to see her like this.  Thoughts of love fill my head as
 I pull her needle out and hold the cotton tight against the hole I've
 made in her skin.  I massage her ankle, helping the drug make its way
 back to her heart, waiting to hear it as it hits her brain.  It happens,
 just as always, just as beautifully.
	"Oh God, oh my God.  Oh!" Jamie cries in an understated and
 orgasmic tone, then grabs my face and presses it against hers.  It makes
 me crazy, every time she does this.  It makes me feel loved.  Despite her
 curse, the hatred she feels for her own job, I know Jamie wants me to
 fuck her.  I take my time placing the cap back on her syringe and rolling
 the latex condom onto my dick.  God, I would do anything to have been
 born in simpler times.
	I push her bare legs apart and we fuck.  It is hard and quick.  I
 spare her the prolonging of the sex act that ordinary women demand of me.  
 Jamie understands the difference between pleasure and suffering.  She
 also understands that the next time that I fuck her, it will be something
 completely different, and it will last much longer.
	Or maybe I'll just tell her to suck my dick.  The thought of it
 almost sends me reeling with laughter.
 
 Chapter Two

	For minutes after I come, my eyes penetrate hers.  She is content
 and distant.  I'm overcome with the urge to join her.  So just like
 always, I throw the condom out the window and cook myself a hit, racing
 against the sadness I feel after fucking this woman.  Remembering that
 I'm paying cash for my time spent with Jamie, I feel filthy.  I detest
 commerce even more than I detest women.  I look in Jamie's eyes and
 wonder if I'm just using her.  Her eyes don't answer.
	Her eyes make me smile.  I can't help it.  I feel loved.  I'm so
 sure that she loves me, even when she's high.  And I love her too.  And
 then I cancel it all with a shot that goes straight to my head.  Ah.
	I feel like I've lost fifty pounds.  Still, I can't stand up, or
 maybe I just don't want to; it's hard to tell.  Jamie kisses my wound
 with pressure and without suction.  She holds her face on my arm for
 god-knows how long before crawling up my chest and joining me in a kiss.
 She grabs my hand and drags it across her body.  When she lets go, I
 continue tracing her figure.  Then she uses her hand to massage my body,
 giving special attention to my dick and balls, trying to summon the
 dormant demons contained therein.
	No rest for the wicked.  I don't mind so much.  As soon as I can
 move again I crawl on top of her and give her what I think she wants.  
 Sex feels great on heroin, but it takes an immense amount of effort and
 an impossible amount of concentration.  When I finish, I feel a little
 sobered by it.  The pleasure is gone, but no matter.  The suffering will
 not be back for a long while.
