        and then i pointed at him with my index finger and said "fucking
 die."  with that he just dropped to the floor, completely motionless.
 as if he was a machine that someone just cut the power feed to.  needless
 to say, the others in the restraunt were quite alarmed.  while i just stood
 there staring at the motionless body on the floor smiling, one of the
 watresses called 911.  in the 4 min it took for the cops and ambulence to
 arrive, most of the people in the ihop left.  most without paying.  some of
 the emploees left also.  i have never seen a place clear out so fast.  the
 cops could not find any grounds to arrest me on.  it made no sence that
 this guy could just drop dead because i told him to.  they told me that
 they were going to watch me closely, and that i shouldn't leave town.
 later i heard that an autopsy showed that the guy died for no reason.  the
 corroners were totally stumped.  for no decernable reason his brain just
 shut off and longer sent any commands to the rest of the dude's body.
 none of this made any sence to me, i don't even know who that guy was
 or why i turned to talk to him...
