        I don't need devushki anyhow.

        No sir, not me.

        But still as I kurit a bit more, I think about that devushka.

        She was the one, I thought for such a long time.  She got me
 started on the kuriting.  As I smoke my pack a day-or-so habit, every
 time I light up, how can I help but think of her.

        Maybe I kurit as an analogy.  Every time I kurit it burns a
 little bit more of that devushka out of golova.  One day I'll be able to
 quit and the devushka will have ushla ot my golova.

        Or not.

        I remember all the times we were vmeste and how they were very
 horosho.  Very very horosho.

        But I also remember all the times when things were ploho.  Very
 very ploho.

        But I don't need devushki.  MNE NE NUZHNI DEVUSHKI!

        But I do.

        I hochu this devushku.  I hochu that devushku.  I hochu every
 devushku.

        Almost.

        There are so many krasivyi devushki.  But most of them are glupi.
 But I find some that are not.  They're smishni, they make me laugh.  The
 sound from my golos: "HA-HA-HA!"

        But they don't want me.  They don't hochet Neko.

        Byednyi me.

        I'm trying too hard to be clever, prostite mne!
