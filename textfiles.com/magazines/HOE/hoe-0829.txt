        Last night I set off on my anxiously awaited trip to the great
 Wizard.  I knew once I found the Wizard I would have to go through a battery
 of tests so that I could receive my bountiful prize.

        After trekking the path end to end I realized the Wizard was located
 only two blocks from my hut.  I could have walked instead of taking my
 trusty steed, oh well.  I enter the front door of the Wizard's castle and I
 am greeted by his little elf servant Mya.  I filled out the necessary
 disclaimers for my tests and was sent deep into the castle to meet with the
 Wizard.  He explained the tests I was about to go through and asked me many
 questions.  I then followed him back to the arena and he said in his great
 and powerful voice,  "Take off all your clothes and put on this gown, lay
 down on the table and I will be back in a second."

        First he did the breast exam, which tickled, but it wasn't so bad.
 Then he tapped all over my abdomen, I guess to make sure I had ovaries or
 something.  AND THEN.. he took out the VAGINA-SCOPE, he said close your eyes
 and relax.  So I closed my eyes and all I could think of was Quarex holding
 up a sign that said PAP SMEAR 3:16.  I almost started laughing.

        Then the tests were over and they weren't so bad.  But the moral of
 the story is, don't think about Quarex at the doctor, it can only lead to no
 good.
