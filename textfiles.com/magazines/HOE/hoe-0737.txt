 > Dear Clyde,
 > Can someone ask clyde for a question?

 > Stephanie

        i suppose so!  so do you want a question!  here is my question!

        why are 1997 dollars worth more than 1995 dollars!

 > Fredrick

        hi fredrick!  happy holidays!

        the most enjoyable way to eat chocolate is slow, and with a spoon!
 don't get your fingers on it!  you will lose a bit of chocolate!  and,
 licking your fingers is unacceptable!  never commit food crime!

        fredrick! also, have you tried eating chocolate with a fork and
 knife!  it is truly sophisticated!

        remember, wrongful chocolate death is a crime!

 > Henrik

        yes!  that is correct!  why do you want to fight crime!

        try this:  keep some lights on at night!  lock your doors!  never be
 alone!  don't talk to strangers!  don't buy drugs in oakland or miami!
 don't wear too much black at one time!  don't use eyeliner or lipstick!
 don't shave your armpits!  don't use "chat rooms"!

        you are experiencing a "head rush"!  it is just a matter of blood
 having to find its way to your head!

        the best thing to do is to drink enough water, and do not make any
 sudden movements!  doing so can cause a head rush, and it will also confuse
 the people who are watching you by remote-viewing and spy-camera!

 > Turnip

        dear turnip! (surely that is not your real name!)

        you have more trouble on your hands than you think!

        this girl is not just an unattractive one!  she is a bona fide crime!
 she wants to take things from you!  money, cars, privacy, house, jewelry,
 and clothing!  and your water supply!  turnip you must guard your water
 supply!  i'm serious!  she's after it!  do you know what happens next! you
 get a letter from her in mexico!  and your water supply is gone!

        this girl is a crime!  free yourself!

 > Ross

        dear ross!

        all vegetables are plus plus good!  they are happy inside!

        to get the most out of your vegetables, remember!  get them fresh and
 eat them fresh!  as time goes on, vegetables lose their happies!  if you eat
 a non happy veggie, you'll be non happy!  get those veggie happies inside
 you!

        also consider!  do not "peel" or "chop off the bad parts"!  eat the
 whole damn thing!  when a man and a woman get married, the man does not
 marry just the leg of the woman!  he marries the whole woman!  so you must
 eat the whole vegetable!

        biology is really a crock of shit!  don't do the report!

        dear sir!

        you have no long-term vision!  where do you want to be in 5 years!
 where do you want to be in 10 years!  think about how to get there!  it will
 be a gradual process!  you can't go from having 1 dollar to 10000000 dollars
 instantly!  first you need 1 dollar!  then you need to have 18 dollars!
 then you will have 43 dollars!  then you will break the 100 dollar mark!
 next you will have 409 dollars!  then you will have 1102 dollars!  next you
 will get to the rank of 6550 dollars!  then you will get up to 10444
 dollars!  next you will achieve the goal of 58662 dollars!  following that,
 you will have 109262 dollars!  after that, you will have 988400 dollars!
 next you will have 3020981 dollars!  then you will have 3440121 dollars!
 then you will have 6245418 dollars!  after that, you will have 8221341
 dollars!  next you will have 9310425 dollars!  from there you can get up to
 10000000 dollars!

        i hope this helps you better plan your life!

        hello!

        i do not know you personally!  so let me guess!

        1)  body odor!
        2)  relationship!
        3)  career!  have you checked the classifieds recently!  how about
            updating your resume!
        4)  get some friends!
        5)  your car is about to be broken into!  do you have an expensive
            car!  start taking the bus to work, or drive the junker!  give
            your expensive car to your kids, who instead will drive it to the
            safe and secure environment of high school!

        sorry, i have to tell it like i see it!

        also, what is this crap with emailing me from hotmail.com!  are you
 doing this just to be anonymous!  i don't think it's very funny!  you're
 just not "ha ha" material! i think this anonymous email service is a crime!

        sports advice: bet on the yankees!
