	I'm not sure exactly what year it happened anymore.  We don't keep
 track of time here on Earth anymore.  Although at one point in time, it
 was necessary, now there is no need.

	The apocalypse--Can I call it that? We were the human race in the
 late 1990's.  Rude.  Sad.  Depressed.  Hopeless.  Faithless.  Chaotic.
 Selfish.  Our skin tones ranged from pale peach flesh to dark chocolate
 flesh, and many reds and yellows in between.  We were colors of the
 earth, and everything we were was explained somehow in philosophical
 reasoning.

	I was in a place which was once known as Windsor, Ontario in
 Canada.  Again, We now have no need for Territories or States.  We, the
 people of the Earth, surpass the need for the institution of government.
 We, the Human Race of the Earth, are perfect.

	I was at the Detroit River with several of my companions, when the
 destruction began.  The crust of the earth began sinking into the mantle,
 and we didn't have any choice but to just let things continue the way
 they were.  We were spectators.

	The crust didn't sink in completely, but just enough to kill many.
 The lava razed buildings to the ground, melted roads, and killed millions
 of people.  People's pets were essentially trapped inside their houses
 and were killed, but many of the animals in their natural state could run
 and escape or avoid the chaos.  Those who were chosen.  Regardless
 though, many animals were killed as well.

	Many people were in airplanes, which all exploded.

	We, the beings who were spared, knew inside of us that Fate was
 killing off those who had no point on Earth: those who weren't completely
 worthy of Life.  It was, if you will, an "ethnic cleansing."

	I remember afterwards looking up at the sky - the colors, orange,
 purple, red, yellow, blue... were very textured looking and very
 appealing to my eyes.  Everything was barren and grey and calm.  I
 remember understanding how many people were gone.  It was at this point
 we, those who were left, began to mutate.  Our physical appearance became
 almost wolf-like.  Walking on all four legs, or just on our hind legs was
 natural for us now.  We became faster, and extremely clairvoyant.  We
 were in touch with our spirituality.  Immediately, I understood I was
 meant to be spared. Andrea was spared.  Cristal was killed.  Natalie was
 spared.  I knew that Eryx, in what was Pennsylvania, was also spared.

	Our skin began to take on new colors as well.  Our natural flesh
 color became almost radioactive with pastel blues and pinks and greens.  
 It was really quite beautiful, but the shock of what happened didn't give
 way to the admiration of beauty.

	Although, I knew that I was meant to be spared, I was still
 careful not to offend Fate.  I was quiet and didn't talk much.  I looked
 into the eyes of the people that were left.  I knew they felt the same as
 I.  Some of their families were killed, as were mine, but that seemed
 irrelevant.  The whole situation was frightening, but we were grateful
 for Fate and for what had just occurred.

	After the slaying, we didn't stay amazed for long.  We began to
 carry on and prosper.  We were a superior new race based on love and
 understanding and Humanity.  Our race was based on comfort.  We genuinely
 understood each other and gave each other space.  We were much more
 animal-like... but had the elite communication of humans.  Fate had
 achieved Perfection.  Perfect Anarchy.  Perfect Peace.  Our super-race
 was ideal.  We were intended to walk the earth in harmony, like the
 animals had attempted since the beginning of time.  We were beautiful and
 great.  We didn't possess any traces of the old human race which existed
 primarily on self-loathing.  There was no need for any of the negativity
 that used to be so eagerly embraced.
