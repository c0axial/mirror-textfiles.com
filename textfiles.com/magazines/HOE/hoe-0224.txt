        dolly hopped into the loud mustang, flipped off the kid next to her
 and pulled on the driver's arm.  "c'mon, jimmy! let's go!"

        jimmy peeled out of the school parking lot, leaving smoke and the
 wretched walls of their high school behind them.  he drove to a nearby park,
 where he stopped the car and turned towards dolly.

        "now that we're alone..." jimmy leered as he leaned in and put his
 armsaround her, clumsily grasping at her clothes fastenings.

        "babe, i gotta tell you somethin'," dolly said meekly to jimmy.

        "okay, sock it to me babe." 

        "jimmy... i'm... uh... pregnant.  i think it was from two weeks ago,
 when we didn't use... well.  i went to the doctor yesterday."

        jimmy didn't say anything. after a minute of silence, he got out of
 the car, walked over to dolly's side, opened the door and dragged her out of
 the car.

        "you fucking slut, what the fuck is wrong with you, getting knocked
 up... what a fucking loser."

        with that, he got back in the car and honked the horn twice
 scornfully in dolly's face as he wheeled out of the park.

        dolly stared at the back of the car as he drove away.  tears streamed
 down her face, and she turned in the direction of her house to start the
 mile-long walk home. fifteen minutes later, she stepped up the few stairs to
 her house, to find her brother billy looking at her.

        "what's wrong, dol?" billy asked, putting his arms around her 
 comfortingly.

        "jimmy... he... he... dumped me!" dolly sobbed.

        "aw, it's okay," billy said as he hugged her closer.  he settled his
 chin on her shoulder and inhaled her scent through his nostrils.

        "don't worry about that freak -- he's not worthy of our family!"
 billy assured her. 

        "oh billy... i was so worried.  he said i was a slut!" dolly sobbed.

        "don't think that for a second, dolly!  you know you're somebody!"

        as billy sat there, holding dolly, he felt a sudden bulge in his
 pants.  he held dolly closer.  she felt it, too, and a slow smile crept over
 her face.

        "it's okay... i'm already pregnant," dolly whispered in his ear.
