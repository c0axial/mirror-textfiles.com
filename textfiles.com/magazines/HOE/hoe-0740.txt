 Flamingd24: he sexy whats cookin
 neko31337: uh, who are you?
 Flamingd24: ur dream come true
 neko31337: oh, i see.
 Flamingd24: u better,,,, i can't believe u dont remember me... i'm hurt :(
 neko31337: um, what's your name?
 Flamingd24: nicole,,, come on jon u know better
 neko31337: nicole who?
 neko31337: i know too many people named nicole
 Flamingd24: we'll talk and u think about it, k?
 Flamingd24: so how've u been lately
 neko31337: i have been pretty ok...uh, did i go to school with you?  or work
            with you? or...?
 neko31337: how've you been (not that i have anything to compare it to, as i
            don't know who you are)
 Flamingd24: ur getting there, i'm great, i've moved on since u broke my
             heart but hey shit happens right?!
 neko31337: i broke your heart? i don't remember anyone named nicole whose
            heart i could've possibly intentionally broken.
 neko31337: of course, i guess there's always the unintentional breaking of
            hearts...like when you crush on someone and you see them talking
            to someone else...you don't even pause to investigate -- your
            heart is already shattered into a million pieces and you're
            scurrying around to pick them up before they're gone forever.
 Flamingd24: just pretend like u realize who i am so i'm no longer aching
 neko31337: oh, HI, nicole, sorry about breaking your heart! glad to hear
            you're doing fine!
 neko31337: now would you be so kind as to tell me who you are and how i know
            you so i don't feel like i'm talking to a complete stranger?
 neko31337: you knoew, i just mispelled hurt as heart. crazy, huh?
 Flamingd24: u did?
 neko31337: yeah, when i was talking to someone in another window.
 Flamingd24: oh i understand
 neko31337: this feels like some silly hoax, since you're not willing to
            reveal how i know you or anything...
 neko31337: i'm sure if i know you as well as you make me out to know you,
            i'll feel super embarassed and will be licking your feet for
            forgiveness when you tell me...so, out with it!
 Flamingd24: didn't u work at hilander
 neko31337: yes
 Flamingd24: and remember me yet?
 neko31337: i remember someone named nicole working at hilander, but i don't
            remember knowing her very well at all. i remember her being quite
            pretty, though.
 neko31337: whether that is you or not, i have no idea...
 Flamingd24: well that wan't me
 neko31337: you didn't work at hilander or you're not pretty?
 neko31337: or none of the above?
 Flamingd24: i'll tell u what i look like and u guess, k?
 Flamingd24: not pretty
 neko31337: whatever works for you
 Flamingd24: i'm tall
 Flamingd24: reddish hair
 Flamingd24: green eyes

 Flamingd24: over xmas was the last time i saw u
 neko31337: you told me that already, silly
 neko31337: i don't suppose you have a picture you could send me to refresh
            my memory, do you?
 neko31337: i only remember working with one person named nicole
 neko31337: and you already said you're not her.
 Flamingd24: yes but my names not nicole

 Flamingd24: is that really the clue that gave it away?

 Flamingd24: my profile does say nicole though sorry if u read that
 neko31337: i don't have aol, i had someone else read it for me.

            be a stranger.
 Flamingd24: i wont, later
