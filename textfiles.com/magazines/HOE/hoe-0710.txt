        [THE SCENE: WOODSTOCK, NEW YORK - BIG PINK - 1968 - BOB DYLAN
 RECOVERS FROM HIS MOTORCYCLE ACCIDENT BY PLAYING NEW SONGS AND OLD FOLK
 MUSIC WITH RICK DANKO, GARTH HUDSON, AND OTHER MEMBERS OF "THE HAWKS", SOON
 TO BE KNOWN TO THE WORLD AS "THE BAND FROM BIG PINK", WHOSE ALBUM "MUSIC
 FROM BIG PINK", PROVED TO BE A HIGHLY INFLUENTIAL MOVEMENT AWAY FROM THE
 HIGH COST STUDIO ANTICS BEST TYPIFIED BY "THE BEATLES" WORLD FAMOUS ALBUM,
 COMMONLY KNOWN AS "SGT. PEPPER", THIS MUSICAL STYLE CAN ALSO BE SEEN IN
 DYLAN'S OWN "JOHN WESLEY HARDING" WHICH AT THE TIME OF RELEASE WAS
 CONSIDERED A RESPONSE TO "THE BEATLES" AND ALSO RECEIVED LUKEWARM REVIEWS,
 COMING AS IT DID, IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SHOCKING CLASSIC ALBUM "BLONDE ON
 BLONDE", WHICH UNLIKE THE QUIET OLD TESTAMENT MEDITATION OF "JOHN WESLEY
 HARDING" CONTAINED A SOUND WHICH DYLAN WOULD LATER CALL "THIN WILD MERCURY"
 AND WAS RIFE WITH OUTRE LYRICS AND MUSICAL STYLES.] 

        (Bob Dylan & The Band play "Odds and Ends", while Sarah Dylan floats
 by and spills juice all over them. The members of the Band look at her with
 aching lust, remembering her days as a Playboy model, and Bob Dylan can't
 help wondering if perhaps she slept with ol' Hugh Hefner, at the Playboy
 Mansion, where it is rumored that Dylan initially met Sarah.  As with all
 such manly woolgathering, he can not help but also compare his treatment
 with the theoretical [and unknown] treatment of Heffy.  Did ever juice
 splatter those famous smoking jackets?  But Dylan then remembers the tragic
 loss of Playboy cartoonist and creator of the character "Plastic-man", Jack
 Cole, who Heff looked with great admiration, and who did end his own life,
 presumably due to marital troubles with his wife, but the coroner, out of 
 good taste, never inquired, and the world would never know.  So, remembering
 his days as Robert Allen Zimmerman, and all those sorrowful nights reading 
 "The Torah", Bbo Dylan decides against this logic, and goes back to
 playing.)
