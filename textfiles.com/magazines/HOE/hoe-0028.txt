        Hi there Campers!  This is a little character reference thing that I
wrote a long time ago.  Way back in time, about 2+ or so  years ago, I was 
into Role-Playing Games.  The best one I found eventually came to be Rifts.
Amazingly I was the GM and I found a very successful game out of the Rifts
world.  I do believe that Kevin Siembieda is a genious!  Anyway, because of
even the mere mention of these characters I will give all rights of this 
text file away to Palladium Books and Mr. Siembieda!  These are their games
and Ideas and characters and nothing here is ours except the group HOE.  
        Anyway, this file was conbobulated when I was at a time in my life
where I had a lot more time on my hands.  It's a general list of all the 
OCCs/RCCs from many of the Rift Books.  I gave it to people that were 
selecting new characters so that they could review it and make the whole 
thing go overall faster instead of them paging and hunting through all the
books.  I have the Rule Book, the Conversion Book, and the first three World 
Books.  I know there are later releases (such as Book 4 "Africa"), but I did 
not include them here because I didn't have the books.  Enjoy.
