        I sit here in front of my computer.  It's late at night.  I seem to
 be on the internet again.  What am I doing here?  Didn't I disconnect five
 hours ago?  It reminds me of the time I surfed "velveeta.com" until the wee
 hours of dawn, as the gold-orange sunrise spilled smoothly over the horizon.

        I can sense the evil Chat Daemons dancing around my head.  They swirl
 around and sing and dance and prance and laugh.  They chant a melodic parody
 of Mary Poppins:

        "I love to chat!  Ha-ha-ha-ha!
        Loud and long and clear!
        I love to chat!  Ha-ha-ha-ha!
        It's getting worse every year!"

        For some reason, this reminds me of all forms and variations of
 cheese, from colby to blue!  I think that it's because "chat" and "cheese"
 both start with a "ch" and are both one-syllable words.

        Glancing at my screen, I see I have ICQ open, as well as 
 "www10.chathouse.com/rave"...and oh yes!  I'm staring right into the face of
 #ezines!  It's an exciting night as always.  I have a lot of logs from
 #ezines.  Ha!  Logs!  That reminds me of the cheese log that Des was
 supposed to send me for my birthday present!  Of course, I never did receive
 one.  It doesn't bother me really, except that for sometimes I can't stop
 thinking about what could've been...

        All this thinking is starting to wear me out.  How late is it?  Oh
 my.  It's almost 4:30 AM.  Well I'm not tired...not really.  I could...aw,
 fuck it...

    .oOo.oOo.oOo.oOo.oOo.oOo.oOo.oOo.oOo.oOo.oOo.oOo.oOo.oOo.oOo.oOo.oOo.

        Soon I am fast asleep.  I begin to dream marvelous dreams.  I am
 walking in a field of wildflowers with TanAdept, Phairgirl, and a dozen
 orange cats.  Since we chat in #ezines, the word "chat" reminds me of
 cheese.  Soon we all have cheese logs and are hitting each other madly with
 them, while the cats leap and bound in harmony.  The orange fur faintly
 resembles the color of cheese, and soon the cats' fur melts into beautiful,
 golden rivers of cheddar.

        All of this hype about cheese and cats makes me think of "An American
 Tail"...

        "There are no CATS in America, and the streets are full of CHEESE!"

        Things begin to spin before my rapidly blinking eyelids.  Everything
 seems to be going in circles!  Why does cheese make me think of cows?  Is
 this why I write so many Hoe articles about cows?  Oh my god!  Bill has a
 cat named Patches that looks like a cow!  Is this why Patches always made me
 think of cheese?  I am living in Wisconsin!  We have cheese!  We have cows!
 Cheese and cows!  That's why they go together.  But cats and cows have
 nothing in common!  Well, actually they both start with the letter "c"...
 and "cheese" also starts with one!  Dude!

        But the set-in-stone thoughts of cheese outweigh any wavering
 thoughts of cows.  I no longer need anything to remind me of cheese.   My
 brain is turning to cheese.  Cheese spread.  Spoon my brains out of my ears
 and put it on a cracker.  You'll be smarter.  You might even start to like
 cheese.  Or what if I were blue?  Would you pour my brains on a salad?  But
 wait, that's dressing.  That strays from the ideal image of cheese.  But
 wait a minute.  Could I be string cheese?  Mozzerella?  I mean really.  If
 you put me on a pizza, am I no longer cheese?  Am I merely part of a pizza?
 
        I like Doctor Seuss.  Why didn't he ever talk about cheese?  It's
 goes so well with green eggs and ham.

        "Would you eat some cheese?
        Would you like it with a sneeze?"

        I live in a house made of Swiss cheese now.  Sometimes my friends
 come visit me, and there are days when they are hungry.  This makes me angry
 because then they eat my fucking walls, and I have to buy extra blankets for
 winter.  I wish they made cheese roll-ups.  I'm going to have to patch those
 holes in the walls with fucking bricks.  Hehehe!  Brick cheese!  Wait!  No!
 No!  Fuck, no!

        I wish I were a Jersey cow.  Why the hell can't I be one?  Do they
 make cheese in New Jersey?  Even if they don't, I bet they still eat it
 there.  I wonder if Jon Bon Jovi likes cheese.  After all, he was a cowboy
 ("I'm a cowboy!  On a steel horse I ride!").  And cows have so much in
 common with cheese.  Obviously they have a lot in common with Jon Bon Jovi.
 So does cheese.  Maybe I'll send Jon Bon Jovi a cheese log for Christmas.
 Logs!  Oh my fucking god!  Where are the Hoes?  What have they done with my
 cheese?  For the love of GOD!  Cheese-Wiz CHRIST Almighty!  Help!  Help!
 HELP!

     .oOo.oOo.oOo.oOo.oOo.oOo.oOo.oOo.oOo.oOo.oOo.oOo.oOo.oOo.oOo.oOo.oOo.

        I awake with a horrendous shudder.  My eyeballs wiggle and curl in a
 disoriented consciousness.

        I am still at my keyboard.  I am still in #ezines.  I sigh with
 relief, because I've found the Hoes, and I have a premonition that all
 cheese, everywhere, is very, very safe.  In a state of peace and accord, I
 reach for my nutty cheese log, and the velvetty smoothness of everyday life
 continues on.
