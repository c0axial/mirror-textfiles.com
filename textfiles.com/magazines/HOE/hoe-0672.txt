        It really doesnt hit you till you turn 21.  Or is it when you go into
 life on your own?  Get your first job.  Or when you bring a new life into
 this world.  After getting into some shit with the cops and fbi and at this
 time i met Tonya the most beutiful girl i had ever seen.  But thats another
 story some other time.  But hell i am here today must have gotten away with
 it huh?  Well now you know a bit bout me so hope your happy.

        But it aint over, On December 6th 1997 i became the father of Jesse
 James my son.  I was so spooked he came out with a pointed head and noone
 told me that was about how when babys pop what they look like.  He had a
 pointed head.  But now Jesse is One and a Half years old no cone head and
 he is big.  I coldnt have asked for more.

        But today i think me and Tonya ended our relationship.  I know i am
 going to lose my girl and my son in the morning.  I thought that as you get
 older it got easyer.  When things get harder you get smarter.  Well shit i
 was wrong no one told me that shit dont change.  Its still hard as hell.
 It kinda drives you insaine.  You do all that you can just to fuck it all
 up.  To end it all.  But you cannot give up but how the hell are yo not
 going to?  Damned if you know tell me.

        Here i am 21 with a kid all alone not knowing what the fuck is going
 on.  I fell as if i am a damn kid what am i supposed to do to take care of
 my kid.  Ya i work but that aint enough i cant be here to watch him all day.
 And im single there isnt anytime in my life for anything.  I AM TRAPPED....

        Well what else can i say this is how my life is in a short story. I
 know i cant write but hell i got it out.....
