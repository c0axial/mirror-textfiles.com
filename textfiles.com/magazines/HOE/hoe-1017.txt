	The human population consists of two types of people: those who
 want to control, and those who want to be controlled. Anarchy is the
 blatant denial of this natural fact. Anarchists use the guise of
 absolute, utopian freedom to sell the idea that you should help them
 overthrow the government. Actual success in such an endeavor would be
 like hitting the reset button while rendering a very complex animation,
 without saving the unrendered version. We would be sent back to square
 one.

	All of nature is divided into leaders and followers; shepherds and
 sheep; dominants and submissives. The majority of people fall into the
 second class. This category can be divided into three sub-categories. The
 first, and purest, are submissives that are aware of, and comfortable
 with, their station in life. These people prefer to give someone else the
 responsibility of representing their ideals, protecting them, and making
 some decisions for them. They realize that they are not well suited to
 doing these things, and are willing to give up some control in order to
 gain freedom from them. The second sub-category is comprised of the
 people who follow blindly, not aware that they are doing so, but also
 content with their station in life. The people in this group support
 their leaders because it is what a good person does. The third
 sub-category consists of people who think they should be in control, but
 because they aren't really meant to be in power, fail at doing so, or do
 so in a dangerous manner. These are the people that become anarchists (as
 well as serial killers, child molesters, and prison guards). These people
 try to compensate for their lack of charisma, leadership, empathy, and
 diplomatic skills by using deception and manipulation to make others do
 their dirty work. Where they lack dominance, they have sadism in spades.

	People that were born to be in power, the true leaders, know what
 they were meant to be, and with proper nurturing of their natural
 talents, succeed in becoming great masters. Unfortunately, the dangerous
 followers, the sadistic breed that refuses to play their dealt hand,
 often are able to corrupt the truly dominant, forcing them to take part
 in their crackpot schemes. Just as the submissives do not lack power,
 their champions do not lack weakness.

	Imagine, if you will, that the anarchists prevailed. At first, you
 would have mass hysteria generated by the third class of submissives
 reveling in lawlessness, breaking every former law in celebration of not
 paying consequences. Deep in the good parts of town you may see some of
 the second class of submissives continuing in their usual manner, until
 it comes time to pay the bills. These people would then seek out
 guidance, first from friends, then from community leaders which existed
 before the anarchy. The pure submissives would have immediately sought
 out leadership from the true masters, and humanity would once again be
 reduced to tribalism. The dangerous, sycophantic anarchists with
 delusions of grandeur would then create their own tribe as they have seen
 that there is strength in numbers. A leader would then be appointed, and
 we would once again be thrust into days of crusades, territorial
 disputes, non-diplomatic war, and segregation. If you don't believe me, 
 read Lord of the Flies. Anarchy is a sure-fire way to destroy society,
 cause panic amongst the majority, and ultimately, inconvenience me in my
 day to day living, as well as my climb to the top.

	Don't fuck with me, anarchists, the meenk shall inherit the earth.
