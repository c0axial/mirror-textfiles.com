        Let me tell you about a customer at my brother's place of
 employment.  The reason Paul knows his name is because he has a nice little
 name tag, which proudly proclaims him "Sea Witch, Seventh Son of a Seventh
 Son".  Apparently he's unrelated to the Sea Hag of Popeye cartoons.

        The Sea Witch's uncle owned the car the little girl landed on in
 "The Omen".  Also, you know how all the double agents are being killed in
 Russia?  That's him doing it.  You see, as the Sea Witch, the Seventh Son
 of a Seventh Son, he can be in seven different dimensions at one time.
 And in fact, a UFO landed in his front yard just last week.  So he took
 himself and President Clinton and President Reagan and put them in a
 dimension with the guy with slicked-back hair and the green turned-up
 collar.  You know the guy with the slicked-back hair and the green
 turned-up collar, don't you?  Of course you do.  And actually, he won the
 election for the Clintons last time, because Bill and Hilary flew in on a
 helicopter and asked for help.  So what he did is he took a bunch of young
 girls and he took 'em out to Ballard High School and he fed 'em to snakes.
 He didn't like doing it, but you know, that's what you gotta do to win an
 election.  Also, you know the character "Bane" from "Batman and Robin",
 played by Jeep Swenson?  Well, he was in the book of Revelations, and he
 came to destroy the world.

        The Sea Witch only rents war movies, and he has this strange way of
 talking.  Like the neighbor on Beavis and Butthead.  Tom, or something.  He
 didn't like the Walking Dead, because it was all about black soldiers.  The
 Seventh Son of a Seventh Son is a white guy.  An old white guy.  He looks
 kind of like your grandfather, if your grandfather is skinny and not dead
 yet.

        That's all we know so far about the Sea Witch, the Seventh Son of a
 Seventh Son.  More updates as we get 'em.
