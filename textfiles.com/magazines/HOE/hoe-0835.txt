 	The seed is listening.

        Planted in a seat of filth, degradation, distrotion of truth,
 exploitation of visions, pungent olfactory irritation, megalomaniacal
 misfits and outspoken self-righteousness, this seed represents the becoming,
 anti-abomination, the awareness, the full-frontal unleashing that Can't
 Fucking Take It Anymore.

	Right-to-lifers TAKING lives in the name of "God."
	(Bullshit)

	Politicians smiling through lying, back-stabbing teeth.
	(Drivel)

        Holier-than-thou's pushing tunnel-visions on uncorrupted minds.
	(Had Enough)

        False prophets (spelled P-R-O-F-I-T-S) in league with the REAL deadly
        sins: Cover-ups, manipulation, strong-arming, intimidation,
        deviation, second-hand smokescreens, and retardation of the BIG
        PICTURE.
	(What the Fuck...)

        Teachers of our young being paid like convenience store clerks.
	(Intolerable)

        The seed is fierce.  The seed listens.

        It hears defenseless children cry out as 9 to 5 calloused knuckles
 beat them because one piece of cereal fell on an already dilapadated floor.
 It hears the anguish that the father feels at snapping at his sons or
 daughters because his outlook is so fucking bleak, he lashes out at his
 family.

        It hears the prayers of teenagers who have no guidance and no
 encouragement, no pyschological tether, because the system doesn't give one
 big, gaping, bleeding, herpes-infested rat's ass about these poor half-full
 cups until they reach "Military ages."  Oil and blood for the wheel which is
 your government.

        Those who defy will fall, those who deny will see the light or see
 stars, those who try to destroy will be destroyed themselves, those who
 demean will be dragged naked through the streets and beaten, those who try
 to dictate will be dealt with, and those who desecrate will be made an
 example of.

        The Monstrosity that is the sad shadow-self of society cannot be
 allowed to ferment and stagnate any longer.  It's safe to say "divine"
 intervention is about a "tooth fairy/santa claus" away from happening, and
 those who sit on their fat asses waiting for that to happen are sloth,
 non-vertebrae, quivering, ignorant parts of the problem in the first place.

        The seed is listening.

        The seed is seething.

        The seed is waiting.

        And the seed is going to rip out the jugular and bleed the bloated
 disenchanted establishment.

        FEED THE SEED.
