        Every young girl spends part of her childhood dreaming.  Some dream
 of their Prince Charming(tm), on a white stallion coming to rescue them from
 a vapid, boring life.  A smattering want to be the "Next Big Thing" in
 Hollywood.  And yes.. a few girls foolishly dance with the idea of having a
 real job.

        But not this little chickadee-dee.  

        This baby has "Barbie Doll" ambitions, something people assume
 everyone else desires, but no one has the balls to actually attempt.  And
 yet, in reality the pretty little slab of "dream house" perfection is
 totally unattainable in real-life proportions.  The majestic piece of
 non-biodegradable plastic is fucked up, freaky and just plain twisted too!

        That doesn't even phase me.

        As soon as I told others of my secret fantasy they scoffed.  They
 told me I had a better chance at being happy and successful!  Their taunts
 fell on deaf ears.  I kept my eyes on the prize.  I practiced my metaphors.

        All you need is a dream.

        After many sleepless nights studying the delicate snowflake-like
 issues of HOE, things started to fall apart.  I lost my job, flunked out of
 school, misplaced my puppy, and forgot about my boyfriend.  It didn't matter
 when they turned off the gas in my apartment, because I had the warm glowing
 words to bask in.

        Cinderella's ready for the ball, just give her some new rags.

        I felt almost ready after 7 years, to make my first attempt at
 writing for my "reason for living".  But alas, I had let myself go.  One can
 not present themselves to their idol without throwing their unkept hair in a
 scrunchie.
     
        It may suck, but it's mine.

        So I did it and submitted it.  Not knowing whether my prayers have
 been answered, or my soul cursed to Hell, or Cleveland.  The waiting and
 hoping were worse than anything I had ever endured.

        Thank god for friends in high places.

        While pacing about I heard a beep at my computer, it was a ICQ from
 Mogel.  "I'm releasing your HOE file tonight!"

        Awwww yeah baby!@
