             for it
 Jalek: pikachu on this!
 I am Mogel: people wanted her to release it last release
 Jalek: well if they were fucking nagging her she could have fucking given
        a set deadline in the beginning and stuck to it
 Jalek: and reported it to NON-twits
 Jalek: instead of listening to anjee and people like that
 I am Mogel: i think she told the ITIC list
