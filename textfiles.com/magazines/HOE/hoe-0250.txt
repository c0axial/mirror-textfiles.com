      a few days ago, i subscribed to alt.irc on USENET for fun.  i was
 curious to see what could possibly be discussed in there.  it wasn't too
 shabby.  a few nifty server lists, recommendations for things, etc.  what
 got on my nerves, though, were the vast amounts of "NE1 NO HOW TO FLOOD???"
 or "HOW CAN I KNOCK SUM1 OFF OF THE IRC??" posts and, even worse, the
 responses of the posts that were made by people just like them.  "I WILL
 SEND YOU A FLOOD SCRIPT IF YOU SEND ME AN MIRC CRACK!"  what the heck?  so
 anyway, given the chance to run my big mouth, i took it and let everyone
 know how annoyed i was.  it was not out of anger.  i just thought maybe i
 could make a difference.  i wanted someone to say "hey, styx is right.  we
 sure are dumb!"

      instead, i got an email from FreakSCeNe.  the regulars of #dto and
 #zines on EFNET will remember him.  he followed mogel around like a puppy.
 it was cute for the first few days.  then it wasn't.  the following is my
 post to alt.irc and the response in email that i received from FreakSCeNe.
 i hope you find this as amusing as i did.  he even cuts on murmur!

      I've subscribed to this newsgroup for a whole 2 days and half of
 the posts are requests for ways to harrass other IRC users (nick
 colliding, flooding, etc.)

      What the hell is wrong with you people?  How old are you?
 Twelve?  When will you realize that flooding does NOT MAKE YOU COOL?
 When will you realize that 99% of the IRC clients and IrcII scripts
 out there protect people from any sort of CTCP/DCC flooding
 automatically anyway, so there's no point?

      Let me tell you something.  If you want to bother somebody via
 computer, IRC is *not the way to do it*.  It's immature, annoying, and
 makes people like me LAG for no good reason.  Grow up.  Read some
 books about computer systems if you want to fuck shit up.

 i read that posting to alt.irc, & you're quite right about most of the
 posters being immature, but it's not like you can talk, "you fucking piece
 of shit". you go on & on with your "fucked in the head" angst
 "bullshit"... i don't know whether you think you're funny, god's dead &
 you don't give a shit, or whatever, & "i don't care, you butt-poking anal
 baby". you're too caught up in the elite-underground-movement & don't
 spend enough time jamming cock up ugly h0z like everyone normal (normal
 meaning not obsessed with computers & trying to appear badass). i even
 think you listen to tool to appear cool. you probably look like murmur &
 have a bat whenever no-one else is home, & sometimes even when they _are_
 home. you think they can't hear your grunts over the stereo playing prison
 sex? anyway, "fuck you", & stop making love to your fist & live a little.
 
 twat.

      after dabbing the tears from my eyes, i decided to sift through
 dejanews.com.  here, you can do a search for old posts on USENET.  i found
 this, posted by FreakSCeNe.  i conclude with it.  i think it speaks for
 itself! :) :) :)
