        I dedicate this piece of writing to Isaac issue of HOE E'zine, after
 reading his "For Kelly 7-9".  Whoever's rambling writing style I'm ripping
 off, I give kudos to you.

        Sinus infections suck.  I've been on antibiotics for almost 2 months
 now and I'm going to be on another round by tonight or tomorrow, depending
 on when I can get the medicine.  I sometimes wonder if those bacteria are
 out to get me.

        "Gee, Granny is almost well.  Let's divide, multiply, and start
 hurting her again!"

        "Ok, let's do it!"

        "Yeah, that way she can miss a bunch of school right before she
 graduates, thus giving her an even lower GPA than she has now!"

        "Yeah, yeah, rah rah!"

        "Then we will make her buy expensive pills, machines, and all sorts
 of quackery, thinking it will help her become well again."

        "heheh, hehehehe, yeah, yeah, quackery, heheheheheehehe"

        <bacteria do their work>

        And I'm getting sick of the credit card offers over the phone.
 Though I keep on getting the free T-shirts and other stuff when I fill out
 the applications.  I'm beginning the free stuff isn't worth the annoying
 calls.

        Does anyone else have problems looking at themselves naked in the
 mirror?  Every once in awhile I can look at myself and try not to repress
 any emotions that come up.  I especially can't look when I'm trying to
 brush my teeth or wash my face.  I'm a bit paranoid about it too -- even
 though I know it's not true, I sometimes think somebody has a hidden camera
 in my bathroom.  Then again, that's kind of vain of me, because there are
 so many other chickies here that have much better naked bodies.

        I sometimes wish I could have the brains and temperament Aristotle
 or Plato.  These guys were two geniuses and I bet they had a lot of
 patience.  I'm smart but not a genius.  Plus I don't have a lot of
 patience.

        I wish I could remember every 80s song I heard on the radio when I
 was younger.  There are a lot of 80s songs I can't place now, even though I
 have bits and pieces of them in my head.  Just the other day I was checking
 out Amazon.com and listened to Terri Gibb's "Somebody's Knocking".  Jeez,
 did that bring back memories.  I remember making my bed and living in
 Mt. Vernon, Virginia.  I also remember making my bed every time I hear
 Noel's Silent Morning:

        Silent morning,
        I wake up and you're not by my side,
        Silent morning,
        You know how hard I try,
        Silent morning,
        They say a man's not supposed to cry.
        Silent morning,
        Why did your love have to be a lie?

        And I can't resist, the heavenly bliss,
        The magic concealed in your kiss,
        And you must realize, what I see in your eyes,
        Takes me to paradise

        I'm tired of the Greek System.  You know, the sorority and
 fraternity people.  The sorority chickies around here seem to be Stepford
 pre-wives:  Wear the same clothes, talk the same, act the same, have the
 same hairdo, etc, etc.  To combat this, I wear clothes that they don't
 wear. So I'm usually in computer geek outfits:  a T-shirt from a computer
 company with a snappy logo, jeans, and Dr. Scholl's black running shoes.
 The fraternity boys are a bunch of poon hounds: their mission in life is
 to get drunk and get laid.  Now, there is inherently wrong with either,
 but as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle say, too much enjoyment of the senses
 can lead one down the wrong path (No, I'm not being a Christian right
 winger or some hardcore, straight-edge person -- try reading Aristotle's
 Nicomachean Ethics).

        I'm also sick of the Campus Crusader's that have infiltrated the
 campus.  They seem to always want to convert me to Christianity.  I'm
 sorry, no matter how much I try, I just cannot believe in Jesus.  I think
 the diversity of the Christian religion is a turn off.  Don't even try to
 send me literature, I got saved at the office, thank you.
