        Santa Claus recently made headlines when he announced his plans
 to stop giving toys away to wide-eyed children around the world.
 Instead, he decided to sell them for a modest fee.

        "You can think of me as the Santa Claus for the 90s.  It happened
 one day when I was building a toy train for little Bobby Morgon.  I
 looked down at the toy I had put all that time and effort into and
 thought, 'Hey, what am I getting out of this deal?' Making a little
 boy's dream come true?  Love and thanks?  Get real, I said to myself.
 Can you buy a new fur coat with love and dreams?  No.  It was truly a
 moment of insight."

        Instead, Santa Claus has opened a chain of toy stores across the
 country which boasts the "lowest prices for the hottest toys." Some
 children have complained that the toys are defective or poorly built.
 One child even choked to death on a plastic piece which fell off her
 dollhouse.  "Sure, we had to cut a few corners. The name of the game is
 profit." said Claus.

        Still, Santa's critics are accusing the jolly fat man of becoming
 just another greedy corporate sell-out that exploits the Christmas
 season.  "Oh please! Christmas hasn't been about peace on Earth, good
 will towards man and all that jazz for quite some time now. Giving?  Get
 real. It's about getting!  Buy, buy, buy!  The stores know it.  Is it so
 horrible that I'm starting to acknowledge it?"

        Continuing his trend of getting 'real', Santa Claus announced
 today his suit against several corporations, most notably the Coca-Cola
 Corp.  "They've been using my name and image to sell their products for
 years. You think I've seen dime one of the money they should be paying
 in royalties?  No!  I just want what is rightfully mine."

        Rumors have even started about elves working under sweat shop
 conditions and getting paid relatively nothing. Santa declined to
 comment on this; but, did offer some final words before getting back to
 one of his many busy stores.  "I use to be young and naive.  I use to
 think that happiness was reward enough; but then I grew up. You can't
 pay the bills with milk and cookies.  You've got to work the system or
 else you're nobody. You've got to turn a profit ... make some cash!
 It's the American way."
