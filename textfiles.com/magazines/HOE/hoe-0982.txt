 HI SUMMER
 HEY HOW'S LIFE
 NOT THE BEST HERE
 MEN ARE DICKHEADS
 Except for Brian
 the Sweetheart.
 I am going with him now.

 Thursday, April 2

 Hi Summer!

	Are you havin' a day?
 I'm not. It's just one of
 those super-idiotic-brain-
 infected-disconected
 things! And I'm sick of
 it.
	Well, I better pay
 attention in math, or else
 I might fail another test!

	Have a day!

	Don't get run over by
 an old granny in high heels
 driving a '69 Mustang
 convertible running a
 red stoplight at a busy
 intersection!

	Hello. I cannot wait
 to get out of Algebra.

	Guess what? I honestly
 started a pan on the
 stove on fire last week!
 It was great-really
 funny. Have you ever
 wondered what ever happened
 to Jason W? We should
 call him or something,
 the year I get
 ungrounded. Listen, my
 brain is still in nuetral
 so I'll write later.

	Summer-
 don't go home with
 your boner on. HA!
 (I mean titty boner!)
 J/K! Have a wonderful
 life you little spineless
 piece of nothing! Psych!

	Summer,
	Play with my brain
 But don't skip to the Skippy.
 I'm lying in a cold dry well
 wasting time. Don't dry up into
 a cold, dry worm. Bugs crawl in
 and the bugs crawl owwwwt.
	My saltwater milkshake spilled
 onto the floor of my brain.
	And in my dream I saw
 me (Jesus Christ) come out
 of the hamburger joint and
 water the shrubbery.

	Love me tender,

	Summer,
	Well, I think

 of your friends that
 seem insane. English

 History with Wulfee has

 Summer,
	Hey how's life?
 upseeting here. But ain't it
 always.
	I am gonna kill
 Jeff Keeter or however
 you spell his last name.
	He is one of
 the Biggest
	ASSHOLES I
 know. I will make a
 list of them for you.
 Should I deck him on the
 bus?
	I will if he bugs me
	I kinda got Bryan Miller MAD
 At me. After lunch I was
 walking out with Emily and
 he told me to relax buy of
 course I was a smart ass
 and said Why should I?
	But I don't see why he
 should care about that. he doesn't
 care about anything else that has
 to do with me.

	Gotta Go Bye
	Big Red.

 I [heart] Bryan Miller
 U [heart] ?

 Thursday, April 3

	Dear Autumn,
 I recently caught up with Mr. Smith.
 He knows not what he thinks. So, Mrs. Smith
 has to tell him. Don't tell Smitty Jr.
 that the time of Jesus Christ is never
 going to draw near upon our slimey little
 Christian skulls, kinda like acid rain.
 When Ms. (Not Mrs.) Smith died she
 remarried to the brain-dead. Forescore and
 25 years ago, Arb brought forth, a Rhythm Nation.

	Lovely Day, 
	ARB

	P.S. Brain Food.

	Hey Summer,
	I am so cool and so
 happy. Brian is going
 to be laughing so hard
 on the bus cause I'm 
 going to be blowing my
 blow pop.
	I love it when he
 says stuff like that.
 Boy if he would
 have seen me
 yesterday he would of
 said something to the
 effect of "I had my
 blowing going" because
 I ate 13 blow pops.
 I was on a sugar
 high man.
	So who do you
 like?
	Me still like Brian
 on my notes I put
       I
    [heart]
      Bri
 This way
 it sounds cuter and it is
 shorter too. I do it
 all the lazy way.
 and don't take that
 the dirty way either.
 that was funny
 friday when my mouth
 was totally blue.
 Theresa said I
 shouldn't have sucked
 man so much.
 God this odyssey is
 dirty
	She heard the blow
	and know who
	gave it.
 God that is
 sick. these books now
 adays.
 Well girl I
 got a whole half of
 an hour to keep
 writing my lovely thoughts
 yes we're almost
 done reading this boy will
 I be glad.
 ooh grusome blood.
 I love it.
 Well I should get
 going now. Bye.

 OK. you asked for it.

 I'm so tired! Math sucks.
 Haven't figured out what though, YET!!

 I'm in a kick ass mood, but I'm NOT
 going to jail (until I deserve it!) J/K!

 French is awesome, I might go there
 sometime in the near future.

 DEEP THOUGHT FOR THE DAY!
 A guy and a girl go out on a date.
 The guy is hoping to get something, like
 sexually. But only the girl knows
 if he's going to get it or not.

 Well, I'll sign off, now!
 Get the hang of that
 math and don't die doing it!

 A Darkened Forest

 A strong wind is howling
	as darkeness grows near,
 In only a moment
	the sun disappears.
 Deep in the forest
	on a restless night,
 Shadows are cast
	by the eerie moonlight.
 The wind picks up
	in a violent storm,
 And this wonderful place
	takes on a different form.
 The rain and the thunder
	continue for hours,
 In this lonesome dark forest
	that nature devours

	Summer,

 Hey Chick!! WHAT'S UP?
 NOT TO MUCH HERE. do
 you know Dennis Dean?
 I started punching him
 before fifth hour. Cause
 him and buttfuck Brian
 were talking about
 me. I still have
 to punch Mr. Buttfuck
 Miller. Don't you love
 the nickname I gave him?
 Do ya love the idea
 of my x-boyfriend being
 my boyfriend again?
 I do and this time
 I'm NOT breaking up
 with him. In about
 the 2nd letter I get
 he will ask me to go
 with him again because
 he did after I first
 broke up with him
 but I never. This time
 when he asks me
 I'm going to say
 yes and I'm NOT
 going to break up with
 him. for anyone.

 If and when I go
 with him again I'm
 going to try and make
 it last for 2 years and
 8 months because that is
 when I plan on moving
 to Oakforest. Then I can
 see him all the time. And
 even before two years I
 will get my ring. and I'll
 jump for joy. Then
 when I move to Oakforest
 I will get to see him for
 the first time in 4 years
 and 8 months. I am
 looking forward to that.
 He probably will be
 too.
	Did you know that
 I liked all of the following
 guys since I broke up
 with Jeff.

	Mike
	Tony
	Rob
	Jeremy
	Tom
	Rick
	John and Brian but
 I did NOT go with
 any of them. No isn't that
 cool. Well gotta go.

 She caught the melting sky/It burned but
 still the winter passes/By & By/2 the
 other side
 A slow parade of wind/That blows thru 3's/
 That wilted with the season's children
 Are we saved by the words/of bastard
 saints/Do we live in fear or faith/Tell
 me now who's behind the rain
 A maze of tangled grace/The symptoms of
 "for real" are/crumbling from embrace/But
 still we chase...the shadows of belief/And new
 religion clouds our visions of/the roots of
 our souls
 Are we ashamed of our own fate/Or play the
 fool 4 our own sake/Tell me who's Behind the rain
 What do we need where do we go/When we get there
 we don't know/Why should we doubt the virgin
 white/Of fallen snow/when faith's our shelter from
 the cold
 Quicksand Jesus I'm so far away/without you/3x
 Quicksand Jesus I believe you
 Quicksand Jesus I'm so far away
