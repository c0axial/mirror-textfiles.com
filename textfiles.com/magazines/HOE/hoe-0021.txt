Ok, Heres the deal. Chapters 1 and 2 are here. You want more? Tell me. If you
don't know me, tell Mogel. If you don't know Mogel, tell some one who knows
me. If I get enough requests, I'll finish up. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                CHAPTER 1
                                -=-===-=-
     
     The assilant sat in the bushes out side the gate. Every day at about
  this time, the governor comes home from her daily drive in her shiny white
  limo. "Ahh, there they are, right on que." thought the masked person.

     The wide gates swung open as the security gateman gave a little nod of
  recognition at the limo driver. The assilent jumped out of the bushes and
  snuck in the gate. He silently snuck up on the gatehouse where the first
  guard sat, watching the oversized fence close. The burgler grabbed the 
  guard in such a way he could make not a squeal, and subdued him with his 
  own shiny new, never used handcuffs. He tied a bandana, with the word 
  'THINK' written in big black letters, around the man's mouth and head.

     The next guard he encountered was an armed security guard walking along,          
  the long drive way. "Their was usually never this many guards, but hell, it  
  is devils night tonight!" He thought as he approched the guard. With a
  quick flash the guard was on the ground. Handcuffed and gaged. This time
  the man's head read "I'm Innocent!" in bright red letters. The word 
  innocent would have never fit if the man wasn't bald.

     Next was the two front door guards. He walked up to the door, and walked
  right between the security guards. They gave him the funniest look. Oh 
  yeah, Some one forgot to take off their mask.. Oh well. He reached for his 
  pepper gas and maced one of the two and then did a roundhouse kick to the 
  other man's temple. He tied them down. Their heads read: "Don't blame us," 
  and the other one: "...We're just guards!". On one man's arm he wrote: You 
  rich bastards don't pay us enough anyway." And of course on the other 
  person's arm: "You deserve to get robbed!"

     He rang the happy little door bell, and heard "dong,Dong,DONG,DING,Ding,
  ding." A person dressed in black and white answered. This must have been 
  the butler. But our masked hero didn't care... He just gently pushed him
  out of the way, and walked in the door like he belonged there. He looked 
  all around, but almost got lost in just the thought of how big the place
  was. His eyes came back and settled on the butler. He spoke calmly, "Where
  is the Mayor, sir?"

     The butler responded, "C-c-c-come wit-wit-with me."  "You sound scared,
  my good sir. Don't be. I am not here to do you any harm. I'm a burgler. 
  Well, to be exact sir, I am a Poetic Terrorist." He stated. "Oh.." said the
  the butler, still not to sure of himself.

     They came to a big double door. Set into it was a sign, A golden plaque
  if you will that said "The Mayors Office". He took a pair of hand cuffs 
  from his pocket and shackled the man to the stair case posts. "Just in 
  case." He burst through the doors and whipped out a gun.   

     "Hello Mrs. Mayor.", His eyes glimmered. "You have fucked over our 
  people.  You made the poor poorer, and the rich richer. You must pay. He 
  put a gun to the mayor's head. "I want five paper clips RIGHT NOW, and 
  don't try any funny stuff damn it. I mean business!!"

     "Your really fucked, you know that?" she bursted out with. "What was 
  that Mrs. Mayor? You swore? This is a police state! Don't you remember you
  passed a bill that there shall be NO SWEARING? My god, you felon. That
  is going to cost you 7 peices of toy leggos!" 

     She reached through her draw and grabbed five paper clips and handed 
  them over to him. "Now the leggos!". She stood up and led him over to her
  sons room. Her son was in school. Where our hero should have been as well.
  She open her sons dresser. "OHHHH MY GOD(S)!!!!" he yelled. "A TOY GUN!"
  "YOUR SON IS IN VIOLATION OF THE BILL YOU PASSED!, You know, The one in
  which you said imitation weapons where illegal. I could turn him in for
  this, and you for disordly conduct. After all, you let him have it, and you
  knew he owned it. You are oblidged to call the police if you know something
  as very important as that!"

     She picked out the 7 leggos almost in tears and handed him them. As she
  was drawing back her arm, she lost her balance for some odd reason and her 
  hand grazed his left breast. "Your molesting me!", "Now your name must be
  posted all across the state, so no one else will be molested by you. You 
  dirty little pervert! Now the whole world will know of your crime!
  You will never be rehabilitated, because you grabbed my breast. I'll see 
  you in hell! (Sarcasticly said of course! <: )"

     He pushed her out the door and hand cuffed her to the railing as well.
  then he took out his cuff keys and put in about 4 inches out of her reach.
  As he walked out the door, he hung a giant poster on the wall over the top 
  of a very expensive picture. On the table right besides the door he left
  all the leggos with a note reading:
                
                " Dear Billy,

                   Hi, You don't know me,
                   but I was playing house
                   and politicains with your
                   mom. I almost forgot to 
                   give back your leggos. It 
                   is a shame you have every
                   thing you want given to
                   you. But that's not your
                   fault, so we will leave 
                   that out of this. Here 
                   are your leggos. 
                    
                        -The poetic Terrorist! "
                   
     He went back up the stairs real quick, and pointed his gun at the 
  woman's head. "What can I do?, LET ME GO!" she pleded. "What you can do
  is pass no more bills of this sort, ever again. And do your best to 
  get rid of the current ones." He pulled the trigger and a little flag
  popped out. "Bang." Not even a "BANG!!", Just a "Bang."

     He left.

     The next week, she passed a bill. It said that police could search any
  one on sight, and any house when ever they wanted to for any reason. And  
  enough... Our hero left his damp and desolate abode. In a few hours, an 
  knock could be heard wrapping on the mayor's front door. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                
                                CHAPTER 2
                                -=-===-=-
     
     Like butter, the great man cut his way through the mayor's defense 
  system. Maybe it was his practice from last time, or maybe it was all 
  the energy of working class kids that guided him so well. Anyhow, he
  did his deed. But now, a little diffrently.

     He found the mayor without the butler's help, The old butler had 
  quit because he knew that the mayor would skrew up agian. The new  
  butler was subdued hiding under a table with his head between his knees.
  The bloody rich bastard refused to leed Mr. HappyDuDah to the mayor.
  So he took it upon him self to find her.
    
     On his exploration, he found Billy. "Billy, do you know who I am?"
  he asked. "No, wait, are you the leggo man?" Billy questioned. "That
  would be me". "Well, I may be young, but I know my mom is doing what 
  is wrong. Take me. I will help you."

     The terrorist stood in shock. Finally, he gasped and decided, "So 
  be it, This may be a trap, so call me a fool."  He took the kid and
  a few toys, some clothes and left.

     Three long days later, the mayor got her long awaited ransom note. The
  post mark was from California.  The investigators found this to be a great
  clue. They figured that since they where in New Jersey, that they took an
  air plane to California. The police went to the only near airport and
  got a log of all the outgoing people with kids. Their where fifteen booked
  flights with kids. These where their only suspects.

     Little did they know, that he had a friend in California and he first
  day air mailed the letter two him and he took a train too a town on the 
  other side of California and mailed it from there.

     A couple days later the mayor got a note from him. It said:

        "Dear Mayor BitchyBag,

                Your son is fine. You can have him back. I don't want
                money. You can save it to by your crack. I want you to
                stop passing bills against the innocent. Stop spending
                money to catch the innocent people, and spend it to
                feed the working class children. You had every thing
                given to you all your life. So has your son. Don't 
                bring him up like you where brought up. It is time 
                for you to tell the world the truth. You are stealing
                our money, passing unconstiutional bills, lieing to our
                people, and you must pay. Don't mess up again, for three
                strikes and you are out.
                                        -PT.   "

     Her son arived in a cab a few days later....

                                             
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
