        Why is it that every bitch in HOE, under their calm veneer of
 mockery and mischief, is actually a wellspring of deep emotional current?
 (PAGANINI, of course, is except by virtue of not being a HOE BITCH, but
 rather an AIM one.)  Why beneath all innocuous surfaces are there fiery
 tempests of rage and neglect?  And why, as one who enjoys all sorts of
 emotion, do I find it reprehensible?  Why are you all so fucking sorry? 

        I think we've got to analyze the nature of this particular emotion 
 against the emotion that drives such things as GREAT ART, CONSTRUCTIVE 
 BEHAVIOR, etc., etc. Why is a self-indulgent file by meenk bemoaning how
 bad her parents were worse than Samuel Butler's _Way of All Flesh_; why is
 a letter from Styx to some dippy broad stupider than _Adolphe_?  Aren't
 they driven by the same types of emotion?  Aren't they fueled by similar
 sorts of injuries?

        What's the difference?  Is there one?  Where is it?  What is it?
 Will I ever write a sentence again?  Who knows?  What's there?  How are
 you?  When did you get here?  That's a very nice bike!  You can ride it if
 you like!  It's got a bell, it rings, and things to make it look nice!
 I'd give it you but I borrowed it.  I've got a mouse named Gerrold. 

        Anyhoo, I think when we look at something like _The Way of All
 Flesh_, by someone who was very cleared wounded, deeply, by his parents,
 we get a sense that, yes, there is the same exhibitionism here that we
 find in HOE files, no question, but that there's something more.  It's as
 if the emotional current that Butler taps into isn't simply /his own/, but
 as if he's tapped into the much deeper waters of the collective human
 experience.

        It's the difference between a shallow pond and the Marinas Trench. 

        Because Butler is abstracted from the text, and here is the
 impartial writer, we are allowed to see the actions of the overbearing
 parents in an objective light.  We are not force fed a perception that
 otherwise could not be commonly shared.  We are allowed to see things in a
 relatively clear light.

        And please, don't mistake me here, I'm not trying to imply that this
 is the case with all good writing.  I just think there's an important
 contrast between this and Meenk's epic work on Mom & Pop, the dynamic
 fucked up duo, two sets of work which say the exact same thing: Isn't it
 god damned terrible how I was raised? 

        In Meenk's HOE files, we find a source of emotion, but it is the 
 emotion of the ego, the self-contained universe.  And worse yet, unlike
 Butler, who was clearly try to undergo a catharsis and PURGE himself of
 these emotions, Meenk seems to be in love with the fact that this excess
 baggage of childhood turmoil allows her to produce such candied prose.
 The words are dripping with this emotion, and such, the prose has a slick
 feel to it, and the subtext is this:  "HERE I AM.  I HAVE BEEN HURT.  I
 HAVE BEEN HURT.  HERE I AM.  BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN HURT, I AM GIVEN LICENSE
 TO BECOME AN EXHIBITIONIST AND WRITE THIS NONSENSE, AND IN TURN HURT YOU.
 ABUSE IS A CYCLE.  TELETYPE DID ME.  I HAVE BEEN HURT.  HERE I AM..."
 All the files blend into one, because they're all broadcasting the same
 message.

        (And please, don't mistake me here, I /like/ Meenk.  This isn't a 
 personal attack on her, just on the general effect of giving someone a 
 workspace in which they can wax poetic about the fucked up shit that has 
 happened to them in life.  Nor is this HOE specific.  It's as if there a 
 satelitte boradcasting this type of emotion on to the earth, and when
 people get in front of vi, joe, jed, Microsoft Word, Wordpad, WordPerfect,
 or notepad their brains immediately tune into it and it forces them to
 produce files like this.  Meenk is no exception.  You are all guilty,
 swine.  All of you are culpable in the eyes of God, and you will all burn
 in Hell.)

        From reading HOE alone, I occasionally wonder if perhaps I am an 
 android or alien, or some equally awful science fiction cliche, because I 
 am lacking this baseline of self-indulgent personal emotion.  Or maybe I'm 
 just an idiot incapable of understanding the softer aspects of humanity, 
 the vulnerability.  Or maybe I'm in denial and need to undergo Janov's
 Primal Scream therapy, or maybe I'm just a perl script that lacks
 self-awareness or modification, and I can't escape this emotionless rut
 that I'm build for myself with arrays and hashes. 

        But whatever it is, I'm glad I can recognize this trash for what
 is.  And I'm glad that my programming doesn't allow me to produce it. 

	Take it for what it's worth.
