 please everybody. - Bill Cosby

        We are here, it is now, beyond that, all human knowledge is
 moonshine. - H. L. Menken (1880 - 1956)

        If you think education is expensive, try ignorance. - Derek Bok

        You did it, live with it. - Tom

        The aim of a joke is not to degrade the human being but to remind hi
 that he is already degraded. - George Oswell

        I have found little that is good about human beings.  In my
 experience most of them are trash. - Sigmund Freud

        Mere poets are as sottish as mere drunkards are, who live in a
 continual mist, without seeing or judging anything clearly.  A man should be
 learned in several sciences, and should have a reasonable, philosophical,
 and in some measure, a mathematical head to be an excellent and complete
 poet. - John Dryden; Notes and Observations on the Empress of Morocco, taken
 from, Carl Sagan's "Dragons of Eden"

        For is not philosophy the study of death? - Socrates

        Pleasure is good, but only when consistent with virtue; it can not be
 a wise man's goal; those who make it their end in life are like the dog that
 snaps at every piece of meat thrown to it, swallows it whole, and stands
 with jaws agape anxiously awaiting more. - Seneca; taken from Will Durants
 "Ceaser and Christ"

        We shall learn more of the nature of man by watching his behavior
 through sixty centuries than by reading Plato and Aristotle, Spinoza and
 Kant.  All philosophy has fallen forfeit to history. - Nietzschie

        Fuck this place, two days so far.
        No food No ride if I die oh well.
        Welcome to the pits of hell, where's theres only rednecks.
        - Sentences scribbled on a pole next to an exit ramp on I-80 in Ohio
 from which I was trying to hitch-hike from.

        The known is finite, the unknown infinite; intellectually we stand on
 an islet in the midst of an illimitable ocean of inexplicability.  Our
 business in every generation is to reclaim a little more land. - T. H.
 Huxley, 1887

        Intellectual capacity is no guarantee against being dead wrong. -

 people. - Jackie Mason

        In the end, everything is a gag. Charlie Chaplin (1889 - 1977)

        When we talk to God we're praying, when God talks back, we're
 schizophrenic. - Lilly Tomlin

        Television has proven that people will look at anything rather than
 each other. - Ann Landers

        I will bring you into my house, I will then lay you down on the
 finest silks from India and China that I have personally hand picked.  I
 will rub you down with the Finest of oils from around the world, that I have
 searched and quested for.  Then, I will make for the finest of breakfasts

 will hit you doggystyle! - Smoove B
