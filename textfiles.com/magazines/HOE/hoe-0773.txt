	welp.  the other day i opened my freezer and found out that
 someone in my family purchased one of the greatest childhood memories for
 me, a kid cuisine meal from the local stop and shop.  my eyes fixated at
 the product, as i was in full awe at the marvel that this was.

	as i opened the product i saw the NEW kid cuisine setup.  still
 the same tray, but instead of the brownie, i had a nice bowl of pudding
 and nacho cheese for the taco tv dinner meal.  even though this was a
 'new' school kid cuisine, it still contained the allmighty serving of our
 favorite vegstable, corn, which keeps us strong and healthy.  it also came
 with a complementary ruler, which i have on my wall.

	i remember the old kid cuisine.

	when i would open my fridge as a little kid, viewing "Super Fun
 KC", kid cuisine's mascot, my eyes would grow large with excitement, and i
 would have to rip the package open.  it would usually be the pizza or
 chicken finger one.  it came with the brownie(standard in all the kid
 cuisines) and somtimes peas, and always corn. 

	if you haven't had a kid cuisine in a while, i suggest that you go
 out and buy one immediately!  it is a fun, great meal, that will keep your
 bones strong and healthy and entertain you with with some great toys (like
 rulers) which come with the great meal.  if you don't like Kid Cuisine,
 then i wish you a fun time in hell.  goodbye.
