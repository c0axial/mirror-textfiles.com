        I have a love and her name is Costochondritis*.  Her very name sends 
 shivers down my spine, and squeezes my heart.
	    
        She tiptoed into my room, late in the evening, and our souls became
 one.  Her short, shallow breaths are now mine; the fierce tension of her
 love aches deep in my breast.

        To be with her, is to be on the brink of death.  She has taken me
 over.  As a measure to exorcise her evil spirit, I was given drugs; Lodine
 XL (an anti-inflammatory), Skelaxin (a muscle relaxant), and Vicodin.

        But, she is a passionate beast and will not give in so easily!  She
 fought hard, using my body as the sweatdrenched battle ground!  For 24 long
 aching hours, every bit of food and drink I used to comfort her was thrown
 back out of me as a sacrifice to the porceline gods.  

        Soon, dehydrated and weary and full of pain, I fled to the emergency
 room, where she started to weaken.  She lost battles against the IV's of
 Anti-nauseadrugs and morphine..

        Now, the cards are more in my favor; I have weapons of Percoset and
 stronger anti-inflammatories.  Her will is beginning to crumple and die, and
 soon, very soon, will I defeat her and reclaim the soul which is rightfully
 mine.
