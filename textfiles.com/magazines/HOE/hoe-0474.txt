        there are some days when i just sit there, waiting for things to
 come to me.  and i wait... wait, just a little longer.  and while i wait
 i ponder about the seemily large pile of god-knows-what that i claim to
 be life.  little girls and little boys walk right passed me, and they
 don't have a clue about anything.  they certainly aren't aware of my
 stares inspecting them from their head to their tiny little toes.  "so
 innocent and pure," i think.   although they may not be so innocent and
 are probably not all that pure -- i don't know, because i am just gazing
 at them.  unfortunately (or fortunately), i do not have the power to see
 into their lives.

        that's when things begin to blur, as i get lost in my stares and
 my thoughts drift to _my_ life and _my_ situations and _my_ problems and
 my everything.  that is, of course, if i have anything at all.  one day
 i have everything, then the next passes by and takes it all away.
 leaving me empty, unfulfilled, unsatisfied, unhappy.  unsane at times.
 i proceed through my train of thought, unaware that my friend or sister
 or brother or mother or father or enemy is desperately trying to free me
 from my thoughts to inform me of something stupid thing that i didn't
 want to know about.

	they pursue their day, unknowing that they so easily led me away
 from my thoughts.  and i try to remember where i was, when another
 struts by, just as i was begining to know what i was thinking of.  i
 acknowledge them with a nod and a forced smile.  they approach me while
 asking the typical conversation starter questions such as "what's up?" or
 "how are you doing?".  somehow i manage to blurt out an answer that
 hopefully will not let them in on my situation.  as instantaneously as
 they appear, i glance at my watch (even if i dont have one), and announce
 my duty of having to go see some random inexistant people.

        i drag my feet and they slowly become little dots surrounded by
 other little dots in a sea of dots.  much further from my previous
 position, i look around and see no one.  sighing of relief, i pull up a
 piece of grass and sit down.  despite the fact that i walked a pretty
 long way -- everything still seems so familiar.  everything that i know,
 that i have once upon a time already analysed is still there.  and it
 puzzles me!  i begin to think that maybe i know my surroundings a little
 too well.

        i quickly look around me and think that perhaps i am still where
 i always was, just a few feet away from that tree i was leaning against
 a few minutes ago.  maybe i did not move more than a few feet. maybe i
 was not the one who looked at my watch (because i dont have one) and
 quickly announced my departure.  maybe those little kids, my sister or
 brother or mother or father or <random person i know> did not come up to
 me.  maybe i went up to them.  and they all walked off, going further in
 life than i have ever went.  maybe as i was stepping away from what
 helped me stand comfortably, they made bigger steps and now are amazingly
 far from what made them feel comfortable and stable.  maybe i am slower
 than the rest.  maybe i just took the time to have a good look around me,
 and as i did that, they pursued their journey in life.

	forgetting about me.
	forgetting about them.
	forgetting their surroundings.

        i lose myself in my un-'s, in-'s and maybe's.  i carefully inspect
 what i have so many times inspected before.  and i feel lost, empty,
 unfulfilled, unstatisfied and unhappy.

	and and and..
	maybe maybe maybe..
		hopefully.
	some other day,
		on a better day.

	think think think! ... where was i?
