        yesterday i was very upset.

        once apon a time there was a little girl named polly.  polly liked
 very much to watch science fiction moving pictures.  so she went to the
 video store.  she went to the science fiction section and closed her eye and
 picked a random movie from the shelf.  the movie that she rented was "DUNE".
 so she went home and put it in her vcr.  then it didn't work. and the tape
 broke. and it would not exit her vcr.

        and then the envelope closed and she was stuck outside in the rain
 again.  and she did not have an unbrella or a flower or a stove or a clover
 or a crayon or a pen or a post it note at all.  so in the tape she went into
 the hole in the wall with the big old sign that said exit here and found
 herself or himself in the oval stairway on the plane. to late for dinner and
 during the movie it ran away.

        red.

        blue.

        hmm.
