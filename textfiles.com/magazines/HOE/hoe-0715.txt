	Whoever said that less is more was seriously delusional, and really
 fucking lazy.  It's like those types of artists that try to pass of a blank
 canvas as a great work of art.  What the fuck is that?  It's total bullshit
 if you ask me.

	I am an old an wise 19 year old, who used to be a not so old and wise
 15 year old.  In school, I used to beleive in that concept when I was
 writing papers.  When I got enough "F's" on my papers, I finally converted.
 I've seen way too many 'paper too short' and 'needs more content' to make my
 head spin.

	It's taken an long time, but I now know that I was one lazy
 motherfucker that never did anything except for taking up space in class.  I
 choose not to think of my HS days, they tend to make me ill.  After this
 illness, I usually end up puking on someones shoes.  And that's about all I
 have to say about that.
