        drugs are queer for many reasons. i will attempt to list some here. 

        The first and foremost is addiction.  some people may claim that pot
 is not addictive, or that they're not.  this is incorrect.

        in my experience, if you tell someone they're addicted, they will
 absolutely deny it.  after this, i usually ask them why they smoke or snort
 or shoot their shit or whatever the fuck it's called, and they reply one of
 3 ways.  the one i hear the most is "it helps me relax."  if not that, i
 hear either "because it trips me out" or "it has herbal properties that are
 good for the body and soul."  i proceed to accuse them again of being an
 addict, but they still deny it.  From this point, i ask them why they won't
 stop.  I have never gotten an excuse besides "because i want to."

        isn't this some form of addiction in itself?  i think so.  if they
 aren't actually physically drawn to it every day, isn't "because i want to"
 just another way that their addiction is portrayed, if more subtle and less
 apparent?

        there are so many reasons _never_ to touch drugs that i cant begin to
 list them all. but i will attempt a few.

        money -- too goddamn fucking expensive. why waste your money on drugs
 when you can buy me cool stuff for less?

        idiocy -- not naming any names, but a certain someone will say that
 drugs not only help you, they make you SMARTER.  (if this is so, if i o.d.,
 will i become a fucking genius?).

        i have to stop writing this now, mogel.  dylans copping a feel on
 laura.
