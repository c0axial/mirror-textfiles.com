   	(Note: This is the resulting product of two hours spent
         unwillingly consuming mass amounts of sugar and caffeine in a
         local coffee house.  My pen started moving, and didn't stop
         until the coffee was gone, and the plate was clean again.)
   
         So now I've got a lofty title for an entity not yet completed,
    considering that I'm just beginning it here... and now I've gone and
   committed myself to lofty purpose having called a non-living thing an
    ENTITY! Damn...I need some kind of inspiration..something to provide
      my thirsty soul with enlightenment..looking all around..peering,
    staring, eyes wandering for inspiration. I've spotted a plant, a few
       worn out comfy chairs and WAIT! Hold the phone, ma..I've found
    inspiration after all! I smell coffee..coffee everywhere! It dances
   and wafts through the air stopping only to tickle my nose...tickle my
        Elmo... makes my mouth want to DROOL (drip drip..where is my
        salivation salvation?) like a d-o-g. I'm not one of those of
   course-but am I not elementally similar? Fido's a carbon-based entity
   ...I'm a carbon-based entity. Hey! We've got something in common! NO!!
   Can't you see? I'm an *individual*...unique, independent, dissimilar.
     I'm not like you or Fido or ANYTHING...or maybe I am. So much for
    that...I go in circles ...round and round..traveling my own mental
   I-440 complete with pot-holes and speed traps and bad driving- proving
   and disproving and proving again the things that I thought I thought I
   knew, but I know not. ...So I'm going now, my time here is over...I'm
   off to deride pop culture delusions and believe my own disillusions as
   I ride off into the sunset on my silver pig. Here I come. There I go.
    The wild blue yonder doesn't look wild or blue or much like a yonder
     at all...from where I sit. Everything looks gray and purple like a
     bruised cheek on a boxer. Damaged goods and damaged people... our
    imperfections clash like a poorly drawn weather map. My front here,
      your front there...our fronts overlap and you frighten my silver
    piggy. *No one* frightens my piggy and lives to...wait a minute. No
     one scares my piggy because he's not really a pig at all. In fact,
     he's quite a non-mammal, and basically an asexual entity(ENTITY!)I
     guess miracles do happen after all, whip. Get your boat out of my
       driveway. I won't allow it on my highway. It's a rainy day in
   Sunnyville, my friend - flies vomit all the time before they eat, you
   know...and you can't catch many flies with vinegar. So call me Vinegar
    and call it a day. Psst...isn't it ironic how people will talk about
   other people as SOON as they're out of earshot? I think Vinegar needs
   more caffeine now. Bye. (Hold on a minute..when was the last time that
        you saw something printed ending in BYE?) So technically, of
   course...always the technicality, it can't end here...it can only just
   begin or beg or be, since begi isn't a word. Sweet tea cures all ills
   and summertime woes. Cappacino steam fills my cavities (all but two,
   and you can thank the deity of your choice *here*)while my mind floats
     down the sugar cane river ...and my imaginary piggy -let's call him
   Beep!-sits at my feet doing his famous chameleon routine. Today, he's
   an executive, he tells me (he's asexual, so I suppose he's more of an
         IT than a he..) and it (he..hahah!)smokes a cigar and says
   "blahblahoinkblahblah" in a louder than normal voice, and it begins to
   do the rrrrrrrrrrrhumba! Sa-cha-cha-cha! He, er...it dances across the
   icy tiles of the floor dropping teeny-weenie (it hates it when I talk
     about weenies)flecks of silver on the ground..and it whirls and it
   twirls...a porcine dervish...disrupting all cellular communication as
         it spins faster and FASTER into a large (HUGE) atmospheric
     disturbance...where it (HE! haha!) clashes with your front and my
   front... and we all begin again (but next time, I'll let you pick out
              the colors). Beep beep! Kinda makes you think..
