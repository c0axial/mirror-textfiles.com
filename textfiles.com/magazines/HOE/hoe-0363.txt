        an elderly man was walking on a brick road, his forehead
 riddled with wrinkles, his blue eyes looking sad. he watched up to the
 sky where the slightly reddish clouds were passing above, grunted, and
 went on. all he could see was the road, and all he could think of was
 the destination. then, suddenly, he decided to observe the surroundings.

        he looked left, and saw a forest. the leaves in the elms were
 getting brown, the winter was definitely coming. the wind rustled the
 leaves and he watched a leaf fall slowly towards the ground, when the
 wind blew it up again. he looked right, and saw a pond. everything
 looked very serene to him. he walked closer to the pond and looked
 around. the night was falling, and all he could hear was the last
 crickets of the fall, and the kids across the pond having some kind of
 a party. he despised the kids. they didnt know how to have real fun,
 and they couldnt take responsibility for themselves. they're probably
 just gonna end up driving around drunk, hitting some poor little woman
 who is on her way to home from work, feeling tired, wanting to see her
 kids, not expecting anything out-of-the-ordinary, and suddenly, seeing
 the headlights of a ford f10 shining from the night, coming straight at
 her, her life ending abruptly, and the kids would probably just walk out
 of the car, without a scratch, and say 'well, wont you look at that' to
 each other. 

        the water of the pond was dark and quite still, but he could
 see a goose sitting near the reeds that were losing their green color,
 and getting ready for the winter. the goose was cleaning itself up,
 left wing raised and the head moving quickly in the feathers.

        and then the wild goose got up on the air, spread his wings like
 an eagle and flew away. end of story.
