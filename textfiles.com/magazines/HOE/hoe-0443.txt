        Purple is my favorite color.  Actually, lavendar is, but that's
 part of the "purple family", so it all works out nicely.  Either way, I
 want everything to be purple.  I have a really pretty purple pen that I
 save just for drawing on the letters I write to people, because, even
 though I'm not very good at it, I like to draw, but that's besides the
 point.  And what's the point?  I have no fucking clue, but I think it
 has something to do with the color purple, which is, as you already
 know, my favorite color.  Purple reminds me of..I think it reminds me
 of preschool, but I didn't like preschool, so then how would purple be
 my favorite color? Maybe it reminds me of some imaginary idea of
 preschool which is all finger painting and eating paste, or something.
 Finger painting using mainly the color purple, I might add.

        But that's not the important part, the important part is that
 I'm slightly color blind, and what is purple to me is blue to everyone
 else.  I think that constitutes as color blind.  Either way, I'm going
 to live my whole life thinking blue is purple, and thinking purple is my
 favorite color.  Then, I'll tell everyone that purple is my favorite
 color, and maybe they will judge me on my favorite color, and judge me
 wrong, because I think blue is purple.  And my grandma was supposed to
 tell me that purple is really blue, but she forgot, and she won't
 remember until she is on her death bed, and by then it will be too late.
 She'll croak and little, with all these veins and needles running into
 her body, and say something like "purple is really blue, tasha."  And to
 her it will be the most innocent comment ever, sort of like a duty, you
 know?  But then she won't realizing that she's ruining my whole world!
 Because my room is purple, and my room is my whole life, as you may very
 well know.  And then I won't have a life anymore, or, rather, I will have
 a life but it won't be the right life because I've been living under this
 misconception of the color purple.
