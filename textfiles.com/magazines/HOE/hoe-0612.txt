        once apon a time, in the land off mook there lived a little big
 called widget.  she was not all there because 5 years ago she left her arm
 in jag when she was on a vacation with her family.  so she only has one
 arm, which makes some things very hard.  and very frustration.  but she
 can beat anyone at anything.

        once someone tried to convince her that they had seen and WRODE a
 hroses, which, of course, is impossible because hroses live with the
 flower people on the the land of monsters and goblins, a place where no
 one can go.  when this person was done talking about his adventure with
 the hroses, widget went on to tell him he was wrong and shoot poison from
 her remaining hand, killing the evil doer.  the evil thing was soon dead
 and fizziling away in the acid poisen.

        when he was entirly gone, widget decided she needed something to
 eat.  so she went down to the local supermarket a baought a giant order of
 nachos.  disgusted at the way they made the awful nachos with liquid nasty
 cheese and yucky mushy salsa, she killed them all with her poison and iron
 fist.  then she went home to her house and made GOOD nachos with chunky
 freash salsa and real chedder cheese in her microwave.  then she realized
 what she had done before slowly melting to the ground, see, microwaves
 running within 50 feet of her caused her to melt.  and she didn't even get
 to eat her nachos!!!!!

        when her brother and good friend got home, he was vary saddened that
 his favorite sister was dead on the kitchen floor.  he went into deep
 depression and decided to only wear black and black make up and black nail
 polish.  then he saw a little rubber ball and started to bat it around the
 room.  thus making him forget the tradgety of his sister.  he went on to
 live a very successful life as a bad, bad docter that killed people.  he
 died three days later having been the oldest big ever to live.  the end.
