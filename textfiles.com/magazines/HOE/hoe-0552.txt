        There's something I've been trying to understand for a hell of a
 long time.  Being a net junkie, I've seen many different writing styles.
 Sure, the Internet has hindered my usage of extensive vocabulary and
 decent grammar of the English language.

        most of the time i just type like this, even though it doesnt
 exactly express how im feeling, it gets the point across

        However, it's still the English language.  I know I look like a fool
 to some for not using capitalization or punctuation,  but there's something
 that disturbs me far more than neglecting grammar:

        1. tewday I went tew the store.  it rawked.  whut did u do 2day?

        and

        2. mah '1337 455 0wnz y0ur 14m3 455 4nyd4y

        In case number 1, you see a general display of what we were taught
 to do as children when learning how to spell:  'Sound it out'.  It rarely
 worked.  Anyhow, people think they're *kewl* when they write like that.

        In case number 2, I'm guessing the 'elite' hackers of the world
 decided that if they spell using some numbers, that the rest of us un-elite
 morons won't be able to decipher what they're saying.  Okay, maybe not.
 But they've alternated some letters with numbers, which in fact, makes
 them c00l.

        Here is a short IRC log of me chatting with a '1337 h4x0r on Efnet:

        <AnonGirl> why d0 y0u h4v3 to typ3 1ik3 this 4ll th3 tim3??
        <r4x0rx0xz> b3c4us3 eye 0wnz y0ur 4ss.  U sux0rz, eye r0x0rz. 

        So, without further research, I completely understand why all the
 elite hackers type in numbers:  Because he owns my ass, and that he roxors,
 and eye suxors.
  
        I totally understand trying to be 'different', but let's take
 something into consideration.  By typing like this, you become different,
 sure, from the people who use the actual English language. And not only
 does typ1ng 1ik3 7hi5 or riting lyke that make look stupid, you become so 
 incredibly NOT DIFFERENT.  You're just a part of another group.  So no, 
 you're not yewneek, nor do you 0wn anything.  Stawp beeing such a r3b3l.

        Hand in your termpaper for geography class like this, next time:

        "The Canaydeeun Sheeld is a big porshun of Canada that is a lawt
 more biggur and rawkiur than uther parts..."

        or

        Th3 R0cky M0unt4inz 4r3 a l33t str3tch 0f m0unt4ins th4t 0wn fr0m 
 Br1t1sh C0lumbi4, C4n4d4, 2 C0l0r4d0, US4..",

        Sorry, but yew w0n't b3 passing N-E-c0ursez N-E-tyme s00n.

        And you'll sound like a 'tard to top it off. 

        But hey, type how you like.
