        Have you ever wondered if you were the unknowing participant of
 some secret experiment?  When I go to work, that is how I feel.  I am
 currently being paid $9 an hour to sit in a cubicle and do absolutely
 nothing.  Recently the idea popped into my mind that maybe the government
 is responsible.  They are trying to see how long I can sit in a box with
 no windows and boring fluorescent lights before I finally crack.  Do you
 get the same feeling when you are at work?  Well, worry no more.  I am
 going to explain how to throw a monkey wrench into their experiment.  I
 will also explain how to recognize the numerous experiments being
 conducted upon you.

                                Games
                                =====

        Believe me that "they" are well aware that you will be playing
 video games on your little Windows machine if you have one.  If they did
 not want you to play the games, they could easily remove them.
 Unfortunately, games such as Solitaire and Minesweeper do not provide
 much escape from the nothing you are working[?] in. This is because these
 games are scientifically designed to keep you bored while successfully
 hiding your boredom from you.

        You must know what I am talking about.  When I have nothing to do,
 I always click into the stupid Windows games.  While I play, it is like
 an extraordinarily weak opiate.  I am not aware of my boredom when I
 play, but I am not entertained either.  Then once my game is over, I
 play it again without hesitation in order to keep the reality of my
 meaningless situation from crashing down on me.

        Now, I told you that the government is involved and you probably
 want proof.  The connection is simple.  I will explain it step by step.
 The first reason the games are present on the machine is because the
 corporate white collars do not want  us to move up along the ladder.
 Think of the main thing that happens when you are playing the game.  You
 never pause to think how to climb out of the boring position you have.
 You  just waste time and let your brain go numb.

        As long as you continue playing the games, the white collars are
 safe.  However, do not think they are not intimidated by us.  The
 corporate world phears those with computer skills because A) it is
 obvious we have enough brain power to do their jobs and B) we could
 actually get things finished quickly.  The white collars do not want to
 lose their jobs where they can be lazy and get paid 100 grand a year.
 Therefore, they needed to find a way to hide our skills from their
 superiors.  Unfortunately, the simple weapons of Mine Sweeper and
 Solitaire have been the most affective against us.

        The next step reaches the government.  As anyone with a pair of
 working eyes can tell you, the government does not represent the common
 interests of the people.  Instead, the government represents the common
 interests of the highest bidder.  The corporate zombies are a large
 source of income for most politicians.  There are lots of kickbacks and
 donations that come in from the corporate world. As a result, the
 government protects itself and the corporate cronies by developing these
 Windows games.

        Now some of you are probably wondering why the government would
 care if we took over the well-paying corporate positions.  The government
 is scared because they could potentially lose their power and money.
 Right now, they already have guaranteed income.  They stand to lose it if
 we take over.  Also, how many of us would give to these clowns after
 knowing what they have put us through for years?  There will be no
 forgiveness for Solitaire.

        Then, it all comes back to the Digital Anti-Christ, Bill Gates.
 Bill has kicked big money into the government in order to make sure that
 the games/brainwashing tools are developed solely for the Windows
 environment.  As a result, we become hooked to the Windows system for
 the games.  The weaker individuals actually start to think that Windows
 is a great "OS" and is necessary to do simple word processing.
 Therefore, you will not find a single corporation that is not using
 Windows 3.1, 95, or NT on their computers.

        By the end, all parties are happy.  The lowly employees are
 content with their worthless, unused, cog-like jobs.  The white collars
 are happy because, as long as asses are kissed, there is no threat of
 them losing their jobs.  The government is happy because the money is
 still rolling in..  Finally, Bill Gates the Wanna-be God is happy
 because his system is being used.

                             Television
                             ==========
     
        Television is the other tool that is used to keep the lowly worker
 down.  What do most of us do when we get out of our boring 8-5 jobs
 during the week?  We go back to our house and click on the TV.  Just like
 the games, the television shows are enough to keep your mind from
 thinking about your worthless situation, but not enough to provide an
 escape.  This keeps the workers in a steady daze throughout the week and
 never lets them realize that they are being screwed.

        But, as if the weekdays were not enough, they have targeted our
 weekends too!  The name of the enemy of our weekends is... The X-files!
 Too many people have become addicted to this show... They come home on
 Friday and watch the show.  Then they discuss the show with their
 friends.  Finally, they start wondering about UFO cover-ups by the
 government and theorize about them.  As a result, they never become
 aware of the real government conspiracy to keep the worker down.

        There are three groups of people who are responsible for the
 X-files Television Conspiracy.  The first group is made up of
 advertisers.  The advertisers fight hard to have slots during this
 show because it is the one time that the workers are actually enjoying
 television.  As a result, the workers are more likely to buy what they
 see advertised during the show because they will associate it with their
 enjoyment.  Unfortunately, this causes the worker to become a slave to
 the new evil-empires [i.e. Taco Bell, the new OB, Hair Club for Men,
 etc.].

        The next level of this conspiracy reaches the heads of the FOX
 network.  They work their hardest in order to preserve the quality of
 this one show so they can keep the advertisers.  The advertisers give
 big money to FOX for the privilege of having an X-files slot.  If the
 worker were to stop watching the X-files, FOX would lose their income
 and power.  Then they would be forced to experiment with a variety of
 flops to take over the slot [i.e. Herman's Head, House of Buggin', etc.].

        Finally, the government can be recognized as the head of this
 conspiracy.  They give the stories of the extra-terrestrials to FOX in
 order to make it easier on their writers.  Whether or not the stories are
 true is irrelevant.  Through spreading these stories, the government has
 created a fascination among the workers.  Therefore, many of us run
 around looking for proof and answers to these stories which we will never
 find.  While we are doing this, we do not think about the more obvious
 conspiracy of keeping us in boring, low-paid, cubicle jobs.  This pleases
 everyone involved in the Game conspiracy as well.

                              Beer
                              ====

        Though beer can also be tied into the advertising group from the
 TV conspiracy, it should be treated as an entirely different conspiracy.
 Aside from water, what beverage would you say that the average worker
 consumes the most?  Beer, of course!  When we get to stressed out at our
 jobs [i.e. the games are not working], we grab a 40 oz, 6 pack, 12pack,
 or 30 pack of our choice.  Then we drink until we are buzzed enough to
 relax  from a day with no stimulation of any kind.  While we are in this
 stupor, we do not think about our situations.  As a result, every
 conspirator is happy because there is no imminent danger to their power.
 In addition, they make a little extra cash on the side.

                             -=Sex=-

        You know how there are those people who love to talk about how
 obsessed we are with sex in America?  Well, they are correct.  This is a
 result of the Big Ol' Conspiracy.  Sex has become almost too important
 for some of the common workers.  This conspiracy somewhat backfired,
 however, because it was so effective that the conspirators themselves
 have fallen a victim to it.  There are roughly 4 groups involved in this
 conspiracy.

        The first group is made up of our lovely prime-time TV networks.
 Though nudity is almost never seen, the main actors/actresses are all
 physically appealing and throw out many sexual innuendoes.  At the same
 time, subliminal messages are displayed in the programming to make us
 feel that sex is more important.  Even pre-adolescents are targeted by
 the Big O Conspiracy.  Are you aware of the frame in "Who Framed Roger
 Rabbit?" where Jessica Rabbit was nude?  What impression would this
 leave on an innocent child?

        The next group of conspirators is, once again, composed of
 advertisers.  They push hard to keep sex seem like the best thing in the
 world because it is a very useful marketing tool.  As a result, they can
 sell their products with only the slightest amount of skin showing in a
 commercial [i.e. The Swedish Bikini Team, That Black-Box Girl, Kate Moss,
 etc.].  We think about buying the product and sex at the same time which,
 consequently, prevents us from noticing the conspiracy.

        The third group of conspirators is made up of the condom
 manufacturers.  These people are ruthless in their quest for power and
 money.  In fact, they do not even need a TV advertising campaign.  Their
 advertising campaign came about when they created AIDS.  Numerous condom
 manufacturers purchased various scientists to create AIDS in order to
 make the purchasing of condoms more necessary.  They then pushed even
 harder to make sex the most important thing to the common man.  This is
 where TV came in.  As a result, in order to have sex without the fear of
 dying, one has to buy condoms.  Therefore, the condom companies have a
 guaranteed income as a result of our overwhelming sexual desires.

        The final group of conspirators is composed of people in the
 government.  Even though the government pushes to keep us having sex,
 they also push us to think it is morally wrong.  Since the conspiracy has
 affected people in government along with the working slob, sex has become
 a useful weapon.  Whenever an enemy of the powers that be rises up, it
 will be possible to make him look bad by pointing out the sexual behavior
 of the individual.  If we are lucky, this will not continue much longer
 because people do not seem to care as much anymore.  But, unfortunately,
 it is still a card that the conspirators can use against us.  The
 government will continue to try and control our thoughts regarding sex
 because it keeps us unaware and pays well.

                              Family Values
                              =============

        This is another great conspiracy.  Of all the people in the world
 who should be talking about morals, it is hard to believe that someone
 running for President is qualified.  Many of us, however, buy into this
 family values crap.  Unfortunately, when we buy into the moral facade
 that the government tells us to follow, it becomes impossible for us to
 better our situation.  Both the people in the government and the white
 collar corporate world have screwed or ass-kissed their way into their
 positions.  When we are led to think it is wrong to do the same things
 they did, they do not have to worry about losing their positions to us.

                         And Much, Much, Much More
                         =========================

        The conspiracy goes on and on.  I have only put a dent into some
 of them.  Yet, fighting conspiracies this large is never easy.  I
 already know what I am doing to fight these blood-suckers and hopefully
 you will have learned a little from this to do the same.  Take a
 breather every once in a while and examine yourself.  Know when you are
 being screwed!  Is it not clear to you that the conspirators are
 everywhere?  Learn, rise  up, fight, and beat them down!  We can not
 allow this to continue any longer.
