	My brethren in anarchy, gather around.  I have some oldschool
 methods for ruining Christmas for the man, for those who try to keep us
 down with their rules for how we should think and act this time of year.
	I know you of the new school want to stick a knife in Santa's ribs
 or leave a time-delay bomb wrapped as a Christmas present under a store
 display tree, but my brethren in chaos, I have this to say, there are
 more subtle ways to shake things up, things that don't get you in prison,
 things that don't cause crack downs and rousting by the pigs.  Here are
 methods from the oldschool which will foul things up for the drones who
 just follow along, these will make people take notice and think for
 themselves.

	First up comes the Christmas choral concert.  This is the number
 one sacred cow of Christmas.  We are supposed to sit and wonder at boring
 music like little angels.  Well if you are an angel you are dead; here's
 how to shake things up with a little coughing fit.
	The trick to this is not too be too obvious.  Before the show
 throw down a few coughs to let the drones think you are really a little
 ill, but then right when the show starts, be quiet, absolutely quiet, and
 stay silent for a good 20 minutes.  This will get the drones thinking you
 are now fine.  This is important, it lulls them into a deeper state of
 self-denial. Your coughing fit must have been temporary, but they still
 listen for tell-tale coughing.
	Then, after this time has passed, let out a few quiet coughs.
 Nothing big, just something to establish that you are there, just often
 enough to keep the drones distracted.  They will be wondering about you,
 waiting for the next cough and not listening to the music if you keep it
 infrequent enough.
	Finally as you come to the end you go for the high-powered cough,
 in fact go for a full fit as the Hallelulia choir is peaking, cough so
 bad that you feel you need to leave the auditorium.  This does two
 things.  First it gets you the heck out of there so you won't be
 confronted after the show.  Second it allows you to cough harder and make
 a racket all the while slowly walking up the aisle.  No one can tell you
 too cool it since you are being a good drone and leaving on your own, but
 in the meantime the true drones are listening to you leave and wishing
 you'd walk faster and they pay no attention to the music.

	The next little trick is so simple that you should have thought of
 it yourself.  Vaseline on the toys.
	Carry a little jar of Vaseline in the pocket of your coat. Dab a
 little on a finger and then pick up a toy and rub it on the back of the
 toy (for example a Gameboy box).  Some kid will pick it up and find it
 slippery and icky and rub it all around him on the store displays or all
 over his clean Christmas clothing.
	Be sure to wipe off your finger before moving on to the next item
 in case the floor walker catches up with you.

	Spray-on snow is a delightful item that seems to be made for the
 old school anarchist.  This is basically spray paint in a can, with the
 side benefit of being washable.  This is important in that if you are
 caught with the stuff the worst thing that happens is you spend ten
 minutes washing off your work, they can't make you do community service
 as you would with permanent spray paint.
	I am sure you can think of plenty of places to write choice
 Christmas greetings anarchy style.  Sides of buildings, car windows,
 busses.  You can reach lots of people quickly with your own style of
 holiday smear.  Plus it makes a great quick hit on elevator buttons, for
 department store elevators, and over the dials of payphones.  Think a
 little and ideas come to you for uses for this chaos-friendly product.

	Buy yourself a string of Christmas lights and, by hand, burn out
 every bulb in the string; carry them with you.  This bit of anarchy works
 good both for family gatherings and store displays.
	The secret here is that if only one bulb is burned out in a string
 of lights on a tree, none of the bulbs in that string will light and
 every bulb has to be tested and the bad one replaced.
	Practice, at home, switching a burned out bulb with a bad one, to
 get your time down to about four seconds.  If you are really good you can
 switch two bulbs in the same strand of a store tree. This takes them 10
 times longer to find what needs to be replaced, they are looking for only
 one bad bulb.

	You don't have to be homeless to wander the streets singing new
 words to Christmas carols.  But you do need to be drunk.  Go buy some $3
 bottle of whiskey and you can easily come up with dirty lyrics to old
 standards.  Nothing gets people out of the shopping mood more than
 hearing their favorite jingle turned foul. This is a gift which keeps on
 giving for next time they think of that song or hear it on the radio,
 they hear your words; they will never enjoy that song again.

	This is the oldest of the oldschool Christmas tricks.  A little
 alcohol in the punch or eggnog.  This works best on children since the
 parents just think the kids are acting weird due to the spirit of the
 season.  And not till the littles ones start puking will they begin to
 suspect anything.

	And lastly comes the old standby of bringing a little anarchy to
 the church on Christmas Eve.  The first is devil horns and a devil's
 tail.  Nothing too obvious, a little subtlety will go a long way here.
 Maybe wear the devil horns under a ski cap, and take the cap off once
 services start.  The tail can be disguised under a suit jacket and
 revealed when you lift up the tail of your jacket to sit or stand.  
 These can be gotten cheaply at costume stores outside of the costume
 season.
	Second is to change the lyrics to hymns.  This is similar to the
 changing the lyrics to Christmas carols but you have a captive audience
 so be careful to not be quite as dirty.  In fact you may get the best
 effect with a few kind words to Satan or other densians of the dark.  The
 good part here is that in Church people can't talk to each other and
 compare notes, so they will leave you alone when you are singing about
 the Dark One, but in the car on the way back home they will ask, "Did you
 hear the same thing I did?"  "Was he singing about Satan?"  "I thought I
 was hearing things."
	Those of you who really need to make a statement in a church can
 make a go for the host.  Hardcore brethren only, this one takes some
 stones.
	Stand up and receive the host from the priest then turn towards
 the congregation and spit out the host on the ground and in a loud voice
 yell, "Yeech!  Christ could at least have taken a shower before he died
 for our sins!"

	No need to limit yourself to these tricks, there are so many more
 like putting dirty books in the kid's section of Christmas book displays.  
 Getting a job as an elf helping Santa and telling children that Santa
 secretly hates them and they will get no gifts; even building a four foot
 tall snow penis then coating it with water to make the penis four feet of
 indestructible ice. All these will keep the drones on their toes and make
 them think instead of just following along like sheep to the house of
 slaughter.

	There you have it brethren, ways to make the season memorable. And
 do it in ways that in a sense go beyond simple havoc in that they are all
 technically legal.  There is not much the cops can do to you if caught.
	Good luck in your anarchy, the oldschool way.  A terror Christmas
 to all and to all a good blight.
