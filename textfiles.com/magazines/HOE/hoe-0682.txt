        Well, it's too late.  If you've ever considered saving the world,
 don't bother.  I've divined this through the magic of AoL Instant Messenger
 and the apparently random chat invitations that it deals out.  And no, it
 hasn't always been like this.  Have you ever gotten a _depressing_ prank
 phone call?

        At least the average AoL user keeps up on current events.
