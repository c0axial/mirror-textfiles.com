 --taPataPAtaptaptappatapataptap"

	"Could you please stop that?  I'm trying to write something here."

	"So?  What does my tapping have to do with your ability to write?"

	"Well", (sigh) "I'm trying to concentrate.  Do you mind?!?"

	"Hmph. You're just lame.  Can't you just /ignore me?"

	"Haahhaha. You geek.  You know you've spent too much time on IRC
 when..."

	"When what?  You should talk.  At least I don't waste my
 time..nevermind."

	"Nevermind what?  Tell me.  Or are you afraid I'll kick your ass
 if you say what you're thinking.  C'mon. Say it."

	"No."

	"SAY it."

	"No."

	"Damn it.  C'mon, I dare you. Say IT!"

	"Fine. It."

	"You are SO dead. I'mma put my foot up yo' ass. I knew you didn't
 have anything to say in the first place.  Beiotch."

	"Whatever."

	"Don't you 'whatever' me. I've killed people for less."

	"Yeah, whatever. With what, your breath? Hahaaa."

	"Bitch.  It only stinks when I kiss you."

	"That's because I kissed you first, assface!"

	"Yeah?  Well you're the one dating an assface. That's part of the
 package, babe."

	"Package?  What package?  Your "package" was returned to sender,
 Tiny Tim."

	"Tiny Tim?  Shugga, please. You know damn well that I've got it
 goin' oooon"

	"Whatever."

	"Whatever."

	"That's no way to start this thing off," Jerry thought.  "Man, I
 need an original idea.  Something that I can really capitalize on.  
 Something that will show them that I am a WRITER!  A serious writer.  A
 writer to be taken seriously.  I will show them all that I, Jerry, am no
 longer content to hang out around the fringes of this scene.  I shall no
 longer be the stereotypical outsider looking in.  Whatever it takes, man,
 I'm gonna fit in. I need to fit in.  They need me like I need them.  
 Yeah.  My wit, my charm, my sarcastic outlook on life, my finesse with
 the ladies; they NEED me, and I'll make them WANT me so bad they can
 taste it. I can slack my way inside that circle and use my skillz to make
 them my bitches.  I want to be known, far and wide, near and far, forever
 and eternally as 'LeetNLow': writersexgodextraordinaire. Yeah, baby,
 grrrr! Hahaa."

	"Ah fuckin' deja-voodoo. Maannnnn, how'm I ever gonna get opz and
 propz if they keep banning me," mumbled Jerry.

	"I've got an idea. Heh, yeah. I know."

	"Maaaaaaaaann. This sucks, dude. Hmm. They know they want me.
 Hahah. I guess I could just finish the file that I started earlier and
 submit that to Mogel.  Maybe he'll let me back in once I've shown him
 what a k-rad writer I am. I'm so leet, man, it hurts. Hehe. Let's get
 this writin' on, Brotha Jerr," he said to no one in particular. Jerry
 went out into the kitchen to get a cold Millie from the fridge, and sat
 back down in front of his smoke-stained ibm color monitor, taking care
 not to disturb the pile of fur otherwise known as Bob that was sleeping
 under his chair.  Bob was more than just a cat to Jerry.  Bob was a
 friend, a good listener, and a fellow player. The only difference really,
 was that Bob had the kind of bodily flexibility that Jerry could only
 dream of someday having.

 -> *mogel* c'mon man, lemme back in. "take a chance on me" ...ahhaha.
    come on, dooud. lemme in.

	"Gerald?  Geeeeerald?  It's dinner time, honey.  Come downstairs
 and eat."

	"In a minute, Ma."

	"Goddamnit, Gerald, get your fat ass up from that chair and away
 from that blasted computer for dinner.  Don't make me send your father up
 there."

	"I'm coming, Ma."

 -> *mogel* l8r, doud. i'll send my mad flava to ya tonite in my file.
            it's almost done. you'll post it, right?

	"NOW, Gerald. Your shepard's pie is getting cold!"

	"I'll be there in just a sec, dad."

 *** Disconnected

	"Daaaad? What the hell?!"

	"Watch that mouf, Boy.  I've got no problem with rearranging that
 ugly ass face of yours.  Now go on down and eat that nice supper that
 your momma done fix for you."

	"Yes sir. I'll be right down, sir."

	"I'll show them all," whispered Jerry under his breath.  He pushed
 in the chair to his desk, making sure that the legs of the chair were now
 pressing tightly against Bob's curled body.  "Meeoww?"  "Shut up, fur
 ass," Jerry hissed as he turned off the lightswitch on the wall and went
 downstairs to pretend to enjoy his shephard's pie dinner.
