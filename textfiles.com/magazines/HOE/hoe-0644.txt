        It was a complicated expression of love, lust, and passion; equally
 sprayed on all the walls of the public bathroom.  It made Theo want to
 vomit.  In fact, it did make him vomit, on the left wall, thus completely
 obliterating the delicate equilibrium previously created in careful, broad
 strokes.  Theo never did like art.

        It began that day as it began every day, a seemingly random bookend
 to another controlled moment in existence.  The concept of Art, in the
 broadest sense, sickened him always, but it was punctuated by his
 breakfast, a carefully metered creation of egg and toast, making its own
 Art, something that the surrealists would have been proud of if they hadn't
 been killed during the war.  He felt suffocated, so much so that he failed
 to breath properly, and he did what was natural.  Such a long bout with
 madness for such a short life, it was quite the delicate crime.

        Order or Entropy, it didn't matter.  Nothing did, except for the
 complex and seemingly ingrained illusion of Art that bled into every aspect
 of a modern life.  Bled like a vein, wrested open by a sort of forced
 attrition, a demand that the world that engulfed him be adorned by the
 subtle patterns of Art.  It surrounded him and he found, even in the most
 mundane, the roots of the sublime.  The sublime caused, within his stomach,
 such pain that he guessed one of these days he might die of shock.  Divine
 Inspiration was akin to the war.  22 million incomprehensible expressions,
 their art sprayed across the ruins of Europe.

        Theo saw it everywhere; in the contours of the box of Wheaties.  In
 the tops of Elmer's Glue.  In the day-glow architecture of the new
 theme-restaurant that had sprung up overnight in his neighborhood.  A
 casual throwback to genius, that kind of genius that stabbed at his heart.
 Theo saw it here, three colors, red, blue, green.  Surrounding the bathroom,
 carefully ordered, delicate balance.  Like an onion, layer on layer.  So he
 puked on it, and moved along.  Just like every other day.  Seemingly random
 actions, themselves accidental bouts of creation.
